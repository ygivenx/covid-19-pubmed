            "text": "Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease with an increasing incidence worldwide (Bianchini et al., 2016). Three markers aberrantly expressed in breast cancer are used for targeted therapy in clinics, including the hormone receptors for estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PgR) and the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2). Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), characterized by tumors lacking ER, PgR, and Her2 expression, represents approximately 15% of all breast cancer cases (Collignon et al., 2016). TNBC belongs to basal-like subtype of breast cancer and is associated with higher genetic instability, which does not have molecules for targeted therapy so far (Alcala-Corona et al., 2017). Chemotherapy is the major treatment for patients with TNBC (Bianchini et al., 2016). Though standard anthracycline and taxane-based chemotherapy can achieve a pathological complete response (pCR) for 30\u201340% of patients with early stage TNBC (von Minckwitz et al., 2012), many patients with TNBC do not respond to chemotherapy and have relatively poor outcomes and prognosis (Bonotto et al., 2014). Moreover, several groups currently investigate chemoresistant pathways in TNBC cells, suggesting chemoresistance is still a challenging problem in more advanced patients with TNBC (Loi et al., 2013; Wein and Loi, 2017).",

Aberrant expression or activation of kinases may promote tumorigenesis, malignancy and drug resistance. Several oncogenic kinases have been discovered in different types of cancer. For example, BCR-ABL plays a role in chronic myeloid leukemia, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in lung cancer, HER2 in breast cancer and the B-Raf mutation in melanoma (Ascierto et al., 2012). Highly selective inhibitors for these kinases have also been developed for cancer treatment as targeted therapies (Knight et al., 2010). Of note, there are approximately 538 kinase genes in the human genome (Cheng et al., 2014). Only a few of the kinases have been well studied in various types of cancer. As such, little is known about the roles of most of the kinases in cancer malignancy and drug resistance, particularly in TNBC cells.",

To examine if any kinases represent potential chemoresistance genes in TNBC cells (Foulkes et al., 2010), we used MDA-MB-231 cells expressing luciferase to monitor cell viability in live cells, and screened MDA-MB-231 with a kinome siRNA library to identify potential drug resistance kinases in TNBC cells treated with chemotherapy. Genetic or pharmacological ablation of the Src kinase diminished the phosphorylation of downstream effectors, AKT and STAT3, and enhanced the sensitivity of TNBC cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. Co-expression of high levels of Src and STAT3 was associated with poor prognosis in patients with TNBC, suggesting that combination therapy with Src inhibitor and chemotherapeutic drugs might be beneficial for Src-expressing patients with TNBC.",

            "text": "MDA-MB-231 is a TNBC cell line and is reportedly resistant to many anti-cancer drugs (Totary-Jain et al., 2012; Yu et al., 2013). To evaluate if any kinases are involved in the chemoresistance of TNBC cells, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with chemotherapeutic drugs camptothecin and doxorubicin in the presence or absence of staurosporine (STS; Figure 1A), a pan kinase inhibitor that wildly suppress many kinases at low dose (Meggio et al., 1995). STS reduced the cell viability and synergized the cytotoxic effects of the chemotherapeutic drugs, particularly of doxorubicin (Figure 1A), suggesting that kinases may play a role in the chemoresistance of MDA-MB-231 cells. To further examine which kinase was involved in the survival of doxorubicin-treated MDA-MB-231 cells, MDA-MB-231 cells expressing luciferase were used to monitor cell viability in live cells and to screen a kinome siRNA library in the presence or absence of doxorubicin (Figure 1B). We selected 15 top-ranked genes due to knockdown of these genes enhanced cytotoxicity of doxorubicin in MDA-MB-231 cells, which were likely responsible for the resistant effects of doxorubicin in TNBC cells (Figure 1C). The knockdown efficiency of these genes was confirmed by real-time PCR (Figure 1C). The 15 genes were further confirmed with parental TNBC cells (MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T), and their cell viability was measured with Cell-Titer Glo (Figures 2A,B). Although knockdown of several genes significantly enhanced doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity in MDA-MB-231 cells, only silencing Src kinase augmented doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity in both MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cells (Figures 2A,B). We also examined the kinome hits in non-TNBC breast cancer cells, which included T47D and MCF-7 cells (Figures 2C,D). The genes involved in chemoresistance varied in different breast cancer cell lines. Nevertheless, knockdown of Src kinase enhanced the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin in both T47D and MCF-7 cells (Figures 2C,D). Furthermore, we knockdowned Src to determine its chemoresistant effects in TNBC cells with tumorsphere culture model, which mimics in vivo condition and a feature of cancer stem cells (Shaheen et al., 2016). Silencing Src decreased the live cells population, while it increased the dead cells populations in TNBC cells when exposed to chemotherapeutic drugs, including camptothecin and doxorubicin (Figures 2E\u2013H).",

Src-silenced cells had significantly increased sensitivity to doxorubicin in both MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cells in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3B). Moreover, clonogenic assay results showed that the number of colonies was decreased in doxorubicin-treated, Src-silenced cells. A combination of siRNA against Src and doxorubicin treatment completely abrogated colony formation in MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cells (Figures 3C,D). To avoid side effects of transient transfection, we generated Src stable knockdown cells with shRNA against Src in MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cells (Figure 4). Similar to the effects of siRNA on cell viability and colony forming ability, stably Src-silenced TNBC cells were more sensitive to doxorubicin treatments than control cells (Figures 4B\u2013D). Further, MDA-MB-468, another Src highly expressed and activated TNBC cell line, was even more resistant to doxorubicin (Figure 4E), suggesting Src might be associated with chemoresistance in TNBC cells.",

            "text": "Src was the first discovered oncogenic tyrosine kinase due to its ability to promote tumor initiation and malignancy. The Src kinase can lead to drug resistance in cancer cells during targeted therapy through the activation of several downstream effectors, particularly of AKT and STAT3 (Zhang and Yu, 2012). In addition, recent studies indicate that Src triggers the ubiquitination and degradation of BH3 only protein Bik through the Ras-Raf-ERK pathway to attenuate apoptosis in cells under stress (Lopez et al., 2012; Ballesta et al., 2013). To identify any potential molecules involved in the chemoresistance of Src, MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cells were transfected with siRNA against Src and treated with doxorubicin (Figure 5). Silencing of Src kinase largely decreased the protein level of total and phosphorylated Src in MDA-MB-231 cells. Additionally, phosphorylation of AKT and STAT-3 was accordingly diminished in cells with and without treatment of doxorubicin (Figure 5A). Likewise, similar results were seen for AKT and STAT3 at the protein level in Src-silenced Hs578T cells (Figure 5B). Nevertheless, Bik protein levels were unexpectedly decreased in Src knockdown MDA-MB-231 cells, while it was slightly increased in Hs578T cells (Figure 5). In addition, dasatinib, a selective Src family kinase inhibitor, attenuated the phosphorylation of AKT and STAT3 in MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cells (Figures 5C,D). Dasatinib further inhibited cell viability and enhanced doxorubicin sensitivity in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 5E). Ectopically expression of STAT3 constitutive active form (CA) was more resistant to doxorubicin than dominant negative form (DN) in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 5F), suggesting that Src-STAT3 signaling may confer to resistance of doxorubicin in TNBC cells.",

Src gene expression in the tumor tissues of patients with TNBC was significantly higher than that in tumor adjacent normal tissues (Figure 6A; p < 0.001, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Moreover, Kaplan\u2013Meier plots were used to analyze the relationship between Src gene expression and overall survival and disease-free survival in patients with TNBC (Figures 6B,C). Although Src expression level had no significant correlation with either overall or disease-free survival in patients with TNBC (Figures 6B,C), stratification analysis showed that high Src expression was nearly significantly associated with shorter overall survival of patients in the early pathological stages (I + II) of disease (Figures 6D,E). To further examine the association of co-expression of Src and STAT3 with survival in patients, the co-expression level of Src and STAT3 was evaluated using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models (Table 1). The tumor tissues with high co-expression of Src and STAT3 were significantly associated with a shorter overall survival in both univariate and multivariate analyses (Table 1; crude hazard ratio [CHR] = 3.92, p = 0.020; adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] = 3.87, p = 0.038), but this co-expression was not statistically significant with disease-free survival (Table 1). Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis of the stratification model indicated that a high co-expression level of Src and STAT3 was associated with poor overall survival in both early (Figure 7; I + II, p = 0.002) and advanced (III + IV, p = 0.029) pathological stages. Although there was a trend for the association of high co-expression of Src and STAT3 with poor disease-free survival, it was not a statistically significant relationship, likely due to the limited sample size in each group.",

Targeting these oncogenic kinases with either monoclonal antibodies or small molecular inhibitors provides promising antitumor effects. However, little is known about the role of kinases on drug resistance in TNBC cells. Herein, we screened kinome siRNA library for chemoresistant kinase in TNBC cells and report the following findings: first, Src kinase is the most resistant kinase in TNBC cells in response to chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin. Second, ablation of Src reduced phosphorylation AKT and STAT3 in TNBC cells. Src and STAT3 highly activated TNBC cells were also more resistant to doxorubicin. Third, Src expression was higher in tumor tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues in patients with TNBC. High co-expression of Src and STAT3 was further associated with poor prognosis, suggesting Src-STAT3 axis might be involved in chemoresistance in TNBC cells.",

            "text": "Genome-wide screening with a siRNA library has been employed to identify many novel regulators associated with diseases, such as the polo-like kinase 1 for cancer (Hu et al., 2009), \u03b22 subunit of the coatomer protein complex for virus infection (de Wilde et al., 2015) and the dual-specificity tyrosine-(Y)-phosphorylation regulated kinase 1A for neurodegenerative diseases (Azorsa et al., 2010). Although the screening system provides a powerful tool for biomedical research, it may have been biased by the primary and validation assays. We used the MDA-MB-231 cells in our primary assay and validated the potential genes in both MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T TNBC cells. Several genes appeared to be involved in the chemoresistance of MDA-MB-231 cells, but these genes did not exert any effects in Hs578T TNBC cells, such as the serine/threonine-protein kinase NIM1, C-terminal Src kinase (CSK) and ROS proto-oncogene 1 (ROS1). These kinases may be overexpressed or activated in MDA-MB-231 cells but not in Hs578T cells. ROS1 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that contains an N-terminal extracellular domain and a C-terminal kinase domain (Acquaviva et al., 2009). Gene rearrangement of the 3\u2032 UTR region of ROS1 with many different genes occurs in several cancer cells and activates downstream effectors to promote tumorigenesis, including ERK, AKT, and STS3 (Davies and Doebele, 2013). These results suggest that ROS1 activation may be involved in doxorubicin resistance in MDA-MB-231 cells but not Hs578T cells. Further study is required to examine the differential roles of ROS1 in these TNBC cells. Moreover, dasatinib suppresses chemoresistance in chondrosarcoma cells, particularly in cells with TP53 mutations (van Oosterwijk et al., 2013). Our current study also showed that Src-silenced breast cancer cells with a TP53 mutation, such as MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, and T47D cells, were relatively more sensitive to doxorubicin than that in MCF-7 cells, which have wild-type TP53. More importantly, most of patients with TNBC have TP53 mutation (\u223c75%) (Liu et al., 2018). Though TP53 mutation may be involved in the resistant mechanisms for DNA damaged drugs, several mechanisms might also confer to chemoresistance in TNBC cells. Thus, investigating chemoresistant targets in TNBC cells with TP53 mutation would be able to reflect the situation in clinical settings. However, the role of TP53 in Src-modulated chemoresistance in breast cancer cells requires more work to be verified.",

Combination treatment with dasatinib and cisplatin has synergistic effects on cancer suppression in TNBC cells (Tryfonopoulos et al., 2011), supporting our notion that Src might be involved in the chemoresistance of TNBC cells. Nevertheless, the results of TCGA data analysis showed that Src mRNA level is not statistically correlated with overall and disease-free survival in patients with TNBC. The phosphorylation of Src at Tyr416, which activates Src, is associated with poor disease-free survival in patients with colorectal cancer and cervical cancer (Hou et al., 2013; Kopetz et al., 2014). These results raise a possibility that Src activation may be a more precise way to determine its correlation with disease in TNBC patients, but further study is required to verify this idea.",

Besides, Src can phosphorylate caspase-8 at tyrosin 397 to suppress apoptosis (Tsang et al., 2016). Src may also inhibit apoptosis via directly phosphorylation at tyrosin 530 of Ku-70, which is a crucial protein to repair DNA double-strand breaks (Morii et al., 2017).

Dasatinib has been shown to inhibit the growth of TNBC cell lines in vitro when used in combination with standard chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, or when used as a single agent (Finn et al., 2007). The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is frequently deregulated in TNBC and inhibitors against this pathway are being developed in preclinical or early phase clinical trials (Massihnia et al., 2016). Rapamycin and its analogs temsirolimus, everolimus, and deforolimus, inhibitors of mTOR, are undergoing clinical evaluation for treatment of a variety of cancers, including breast cancer (Minami et al., 2011), supporting our notion that Src-AKT-STAT3 signaling may be crucial for chemoresistance in TNBC cells. Besides Src-STAT3 in chemoresistance of TNBC, several mechanisms might be involved in the chemoresistance of TNBC as reported previously, including (i) ABC transporters efflux, (ii) NF\u03baB pathway, (iii) increase of anti-apoptosis and detoxification proteins (O\u2019Reilly et al., 2015) and (iv) gene amplification of proto-oncogenes, such as MYC and JAK2 (Wein and Loi, 2017).
