            "text": "A dominant feature of host\u2013parasite interactions is the large variation in infection and infectiousness. Individuals infected with HIV, for example, may either rapidly develop acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or take many years before showing overt symptoms [1]. In a similar manner, individuals exhibit large variation in parasite infection with some remaining chronic while others are rapidly cleared [2]. The significant variation in the establishment and growth of parasites among individuals is such that few individuals are responsible for a large proportion of the transmission events [3,4]. One striking example was illustrated by the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic where 103 of the first 201 cases were infected by just five source cases\u2014individuals termed super-spreaders, i.e. those that infect an unusually large number of secondary cases [5\u20138]. Typically, super-spreaders are those with higher than average contact rates although increased host infectiousness is also implicated in super-spreading events [5,8]. Individuals with the potential to be highly infectious can be referred to as a \u2018super-shedders\u2019; individuals that for a period of time yield many more infective stages than most other infected individuals of the same host species [5]. A major challenge in disease biology is to identify some of the mechanisms that may generate super-shedders. One of the drivers of variation in parasite load and host infectiousness is proposed to be underlying secondary infection, or co-infection, the simultaneous infection of an individual with two or more parasitic species [9\u201311]. We investigate the hypothesis that co-infection alters the likelihood of parasite establishment, growth and shedding of both parasites and may generate super-shedders. Here, we use the term parasite to include both macroparasites (helminths, protozoa) and microparasites (viruses and bacteria).",

            "text": "Co-infection is common across species [12] and so understanding the mechanics of co-infection, i.e. the effect on growth and establishment of one parasite on another is important for host health and effective disease control. When a co-infection consists of helminth and bacteria that infect different organs within an individual the variation in parasite establishment and growth may be expected to be resource or immune-mediated [13\u201319]. In the case of the latter, a broad antagonism in immune mechanisms in response to the two different types of parasite may be expected to generate differential infection dynamics [20]. Helminths typically induce cytokines associated with a T-helper cell type 2 (Th2) immune response, which simultaneously downregulates T-helper cell type 1 (Th1) cytokines, which are involved in fighting intracellular microparasites [20]. As such, this antagonism may alter co-infection dynamics, and this has been shown to be the case using mathematical models [15], whereas meta-analyses of empirical data have identified key cytokines that may be broadly accountable for shaping co-infection dynamics [13]. It is therefore likely that variation in individual parasite species' establishment, growth and ultimately host infectiousness may be a function of co-infection.",

We examined the establishment and growth of the respiratory bacterium Bordetella bronchiseptica lux+ (a self-bioluminescent strain), using bioluminescence imaging (BLI). Simultaneously, we monitored the shedding of eggs of the directly transmitted gastrointestinal helminth Heligmosomoides polygyrus in laboratory mice. Both parasites are well studied immunologically [21\u201324] and inhabit different physical locations in the host and so are unlikely to directly compete for resources or otherwise, therefore we hypothesize that interactions will likely be immune-mediated.",

We used B. bronchiseptica strain RB50, which had been rendered self-bioluminescent by the chromosomal insertion of a plasmid\u2014pSS4266 to produce B. bronchiseptica lux+ [29]. The lux operon is driven by the fha promoter and is constitutively expressed such that bacteria are self-bioluminescent (i.e. do not require addition of a substrate), and the light emitted was quantified in vivo over time using BLI. Bacterial doses were confirmed by plating dilutions and carrying out colony counts prior to inoculation. Mice were intra-nasally inoculated under light anaesthesia (continuous flow 5% isoflurane in oxygen) with a 50 \u03bcl droplet of B. bronchiseptica lux+ in PBS+1 per cent Stainer\u2013Scholte medium (ca 104 bacterial cells). The helminth-only treatment group received an intranasal sham-inoculation of 50 \u03bcl PBS+1 per cent Stainer\u2013Scholte medium. Mice assigned to a co-infection or helminth-only treatment were simultaneously inoculated with 180\u00b130 H. polygyrus infective L3 larvae in 20 \u03bcl distilled water, administered via oral gavage. The mean number of larvae in each inoculum was estimated from 10 direct counts of larvae in 20 \u03bcl of water prior to gavaging. The bacteria only and control treatment groups received a sham-inoculation of 20 \u03bcl distilled water, administered via oral gavage.

Mice were anaesthetized using a continuous flow of 5 per cent isoflurane mixed with oxygen for 5 min to allow acquisition of an image quantifying the light emission in vivo from B. bronchiseptica lux+. Bacterial load measurements were obtained from three regions of the mouse: (i) whole body, within a square of standard size 3.0 cm width and 5.0 cm height, (ii) head, including nose and trachea using an elliptical region of size 2.3 cm width and 2.0 cm height, and (iii) lungs using a standardized square region of 3.0 cm width and 3.0 cm height. Mice were imaged at approximately the same time of day, from day zero (just prior to inoculation) until day 22. An image was acquired over a 5 minute period and the software Living Image (v. 2.6.1, Xenogen Corporation, Almeda, TX, USA) was used to convert the photons emitted from B. bronchiseptica lux+ within the host into relative light units (RLUs). The spatial location of infection in the mouse was overlaid on a photographic image using a pseudo-colour to quantify the RLUs. Previous studies have shown the light output (RLUs) from self-bioluminescent bacteria to correlate positively with viable counts of bacteria in vivo [30\u201333], thereby giving a real-time quantification of bacterial load. To validate the relationship between B. bronchiseptica in vivo and in vitro, comparisons were made between viable counts of bacteria from a parallel experiment where animals were sacrificed at set time points (see \u00a72.1.3.) and related to the RLUs in vivo.",

[34], where a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) using ASReml v. 2.0 was used to determine differences in the number of faecal egg counts of multiple individuals over time. Mixed models allow the user to control for multiple variables at the same time, including both random and fixed effects. One advantage to ASReml is that spline terms are included in the random model where only 1 d.f. is used. Here, we fit this spline to the time course of infection in our data, allowing nonlinear relationships between variables to be modelled. We also included host identification as a random term to control for pseudo-replication (i.e. autocorrelation errors). For the fixed model, we fitted a spline to the bacterial load, over time, of the single and co-infected groups and used this as the response variable with treatment group (single or co-infected) as the explanatory variable. We first log-transformed the data and then carried out a GLMM analysis using ASReml in software R [35].

We monitored helminth egg shedding every 3 days until day 44, thereafter weekly sampling occurred until no eggs were found in an individual for three consecutive time points (last time point collected was day 365). Prior to collecting faeces for egg counts, mouse cages were cleaned at 16.00\u00b12 h, a subsample of faeces was collected approximately 18 h later, and helminth eggs quantified using standard McMaster techniques. To determine whether co-infected mice shed significantly more helminth eggs than single-infected mice, over time, we carried out a GLMM with random terms using ASReml in R (after [34] and [35]). A unique identification number for each animal was included in the model as a random term to remove the variation caused by individuals in order to gain insights into any underlying relationships in the fixed model. For the fixed model, we fitted a spline to the parasitic load, over time, of the single and co-infected groups and used this as the response variable with treatment group as the explanatory variable. To quantify whether co-infection generated super-shedders, we used the distribution of eggs shed from the helminth-only infected animals as a baseline distribution. We defined super-shedders as individuals (from the co-infected treatment group) that were 2 s.d.s above the mean of single-infected individuals.",

While helminth egg shedding can be related to infectiousness, relating the bacterial load in vivo to host infectiousness is, however, more complicated. Shedding of B. bronchiseptica has been shown to be positively affected by the number of bacteria in rabbit hosts [39]. Bordetella bronchiseptica is a natural parasite in mice [40,41], and transmission between female mice and their offspring has been observed in transmission experiments under controlled laboratory conditions (S. Lass 2008, unpublished data), as such, a high bacterial load may translate into higher infectiousness, although further empirical work is required for validation. Thus, we show that co-infection could be a factor contributing to the commonly observed variation in both individual infection load and host infectiousness and may therefore alter the dynamics of epidemics [2\u20137].",

In our experiment, co-infected individuals suffered from higher mortality than individuals infected with the bacteria or helminth only (figures 3 and 4). We observed the proliferation of one parasite (bacteria) to be elevated due to the presence of a secondary infection (helminth), which led to increased parasite-induced host mortality. This has been shown to occur at a population level, whereby co-infecting parasites caused ecological interference thereby strongly affecting parasite dynamics [42]. Given that helminth egg shedding is a good proxy of infectiousness, if co-infections increase the heterogeneity in infection intensities then co-infected individuals may act to increase the basic reproduction number (R0) of a parasite. Alternatively, the cost associated with co-infection could be such that those individuals have little overall contribution to R0 because they are rapidly removed from the epidemic owing to co-infection-induced host mortality. In addition, of the individuals that were co-infected five of seven developed into helminth super-shedders and so the co-infection-induced mortality may act to reduce population-level transmission potential of the helminths. To determine the role of individual hosts in the dynamics of infectious disease, however, we need to know simultaneously the number of contacts and the infectiousness of that individual; data not collected here. To the best of our knowledge, host infectiousness and contact frequency have not been examined simultaneously. However, it has been found that cattle co-penned with super-shedders had significantly greater mean pen E. coli levels than animals that were not co-penned animals [43].",

            "text": "Interestingly, the variance in bacterial loads and egg shedding within treatment groups was high. One helminth-only infected host shed parasite eggs for 320 days while all other single-infected individuals had cleared helminth infection on average by day 79\u00b19 days post-infection (figure 5). This single-infected individual meets our criteria for definition as a super-shedder although mechanisms other than co-infection have generated this extended shedding. In addition, bacterial load in some, but not all co-infected hosts reached higher than average loads by 2 s.d.s (figure 3). Given the homogeneous environmental conditions in the laboratory and the low genetic diversity of the BALB/c mouse strain and the parasites used, this variation within the co-infected and helminth-only treatment group was surprising, but similar patterns have been observed in host\u2013parasite interactions with clonal hosts [44,45]. Exposing different host clones to different doses of parasite isolates in a well-controlled laboratory experiment resulted in considerable variation in infection probability [45]. Non-inherited phenotypic differences such as differences in the immune response or in life-history traits may be the underlying cause for the observed variation among individual hosts [45]. This could also be true for our experiment. The observed variation in shedding helminth eggs and bacterial load may be caused by external factors (e.g. micro-environmental variation between our mouse cages) or by internal factors such as molecular mechanisms of the immune system (e.g. alternative splicing [46]) or within-mouse strain variation, e.g. in life-history traits. Indeed, our observations show that while co-infection certainly seems to generate super-shedders it is not the case that all super-shedders are co-infected.",

Thus, the difference in helminth infection intensity in co-infection versus single infection was likely to be mediated by the host's immune system. While parasites in the same location within a host may interact due to competition for resources, including space and nutrients, interactions between parasites in different physical locations are likely to be mediated by the immune system [13,19], and these interactions may be antagonistic towards parasite defence [13,47\u201349]. Previous work has shown that clearance of B. bronchiseptica from the lungs requires IFN-\u03b3, part of a Th1-mediated response [21], whereas an immune response to H. polygyrus is initiated by Th2 cytokines, such as IL-4 and IL-10 in the murine host [50]. The anticipated antagonism between these immune responses to the bacterial\u2013helminth co-infection may therefore have produced the impaired clearance of B. bronchiseptica and H. polygyrus [13,20]. Alternatively, the immunomodulatory pathways known to be activated by H. polygyrus [51\u201353] could lead to suppression of immune responses to both parasites, thereby producing the helminth super-shedders and the high bacterial loads observed.",
