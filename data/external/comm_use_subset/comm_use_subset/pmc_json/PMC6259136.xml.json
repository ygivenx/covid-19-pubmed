They are aromatic oily liquids, volatile, characterized by a strong odour, rarely coloured, and generally with a lower density than that of water. They can be synthesized by all plant organs (flowers, buds, seeds, leaves, twigs, bark, herbs, wood, fruits and root) and therefore extracted from these parts, where they are stored in secretory cells, cavities, canals, epidermic cells or glandular trichomes [2,3]. Essential oils only represent a small fraction of plant\u2019s composition; nevertheless they confer the characteristics by which aromatic plants are used in the food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries [4].",

Phagocytosis of bacteria, which occurs during inflammation, is accompanied by a dramatic increase in oxygen consumption resulting in the formation of superoxide anion radical (O2\u2022-) which is quickly converted to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), spontaneously, or by the enzyme superoxide dismutase. Hydrogen peroxide can then also be reduced by transition metal ions generating the hydroxyl radical (HO\u00b0), one of the strongest oxidizing agents that can rapidly react with polyunsaturated fatty acids, resulting the production of peroxyl radicals (ROO\u2022). Peroxide hydrogen can also oxidise halide ions (Cl-) to hypochlorous acid (HOCl), which is a strong oxidant that can react with amines producing chloramines, some of them being very toxic [18,19,20,21,22]. These radicals are commonly known as ROS (reactive oxygen species). Nevertheless and during an inflammatory process, there is also the generation of other free radicals named RNS (reactive nitrogen species). Nitric oxide (\u2022NO) and peroxynitrite anion (ONOO-) are two examples of this sort of radicals. Nitric oxide is produced in large quantities by the inducible nitric oxide synthases (iNOS) in activated macrophages and neutrophils during defence and immunological reactions. However this reactive species can also exerts its toxicity by generating the peroxynitrite anion after reacting with the superoxide anion radical [22,23,24,25].",

Therefore, and based on their mode of action, the antioxidants can be classified as primary, secondary or co-antioxidants. Primary antioxidants are able to donate a hydrogen atom rapidly to a lipid radical, forming a new radical, which is more stable. Secondary anti-oxidants react with the initiating radicals (or inhibit the initiating enzymes), or reduce the oxygen level (without generating reactive radical species). Therefore, these secondary antioxidants can retard the rate of radical initiation reaction by elimination of initiators. This can be performed by deactivating high energy species (singlet oxygen); absorbing UV light; scavenging of oxygen; chelating metal that catalyses free radical reaction, or inhibiting enzymes, such as peroxidases, NADPH oxidase, xanthine oxidase, among other oxidative enzymes [28].",

The decrease of hexanal was followed by gas chromatography coupled to a flame ionisation detector.

The antioxidant activity of essential oils of five spice plants used in the Mediterranean diet that was evaluated through the TBARS method [52] was also evaluated through the Rancimat method in which the lipid substrate was lard. The system was heated at 120 \u00baC and an air flow of 20 L/h was constantly blown into the mixture. The end of the induction period was characterized by the sudden increase of water conductivity, due to the dissociation of volatile carboxylic acids. Their results showed that the oils of Thymus vulgaris and Origanum vulgare L. showed the best antioxidant activity index, as determined by the Rancimat method, but less than the activity of BHT (synthetic standard). Carvacrol was the main component of the Origanum vulgare oil. In this case, an oil rich in phenolic components (oregano) and the other one (thyme) without great levels of these components presented similar activities, in contrast to that reported for the TBARS, in which thyme possessed the best activity [52]. This is a good example in which diverse methods of antioxidant evaluation may give rise different results, showing therefore the importance of using several methods to evaluate the enatioxidant activity of samples.",

According to these results along with the chemical composition of the oils, in which phenolic compounds were absent, the authors probably considered it unnecessary to use other methods.

            "text": "Nevertheless, there are other authors that consider it enough to test using only one method (DPPH) when good antioxidant activity values are found [62,66,67,68,70]. For example, the authors in [62] found high antioxidant activities of the essential oils of Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh. growing wild in different localities of Sardinia (Italia). The activities changed according to the chemical composition, neverthless generally constituted by p-cymene, 1,8-cineole, \u03b2-phellandrene, spathulenol and cryptone in different proportions according to the harvesting place and period. The essential oil of Majorana hortensis L. had appreciable antioxidant activity probably ascrible to carvacrol with positive synergism with other components [66]. Citrus maxima Burm. and Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck also had considerable antioxidant activities, despite the chemical differences of their essential oils. Whereas Citrus sinensis oils was predominantly constituted by limonene, in Citrus maxima oil, several components could be identified in significant amounts in the oil (limonene, E-citral, Z-citral and 3,3-dimethyl-1-hexene [67]. Heracleum pastinacifolium and Heracleum persicum were described as possessing moderate antioxidant activity, which main components were myristicin and trans-amethole, respectively [68]. Three Mexican Lippia graveolens Kunth. oils with different chemical compositions as well as their microcapsules were evaluated in terms of antiradical activities. The authors concluded that microencapsulation increased the anti-radical activity from fourfold to eightgold [69]. Diverse oils obtained from Origanum vulgare L. subsp. glandulosum (Desf.) collected at different locations of Tunisia showed different but always good abilities for scavenging DPPH radicals. Such results depended on the percentage of phenolic compounds (thymol) present in the oils [71]. In spite of the fact some authors consider that the flower oils of Retama raetam (Forssk.) Webb cultivated in Tunisia presented good antioxidant activity, as measured through the DPPH method, the sole method used by the authors, whereby the IC50 value was fortyfold superior to that of the reference BHT, nevertheless the apparent relative good activity reported by the authors could be attributed to the relative high percentage of monoterpenes present in the essential oils [72]. A good activity was found by Saei-Dehkordi et al. (2010) [74] for the root oil of Ridolfia segetum (L.) Moris from Tunisia, because the IC50 values were close to that of BHT. Such antiradical activity could be attributed to the high amounts of two phenyl-propanoids, dillapiole and myristicin [60].",

The authors identified 1,8-cineole and methyl eugenol as the components responsible for the moderate antioxidant activity of the essential oils of Myrtus communis L.. The same procedure was followed by other authors [64] for the oils of Aniba panurensis (Meisn.) Mez, Aniba rosaeodora Ducke and Licaria martiniana (Mez) Kostern., from Brazil. The IC50 values were generally >1,000 \u03bcg/mL, substantially superior to that of quercetin, the reference used by the authors.

The essential oils of Ageratum conyzoides or Amomum tsao ko presented better ability to prevent lipid peroxidation than for scavenging free radicals. Ageratum conyzoides methanolic extracts that had low capacity for preventing lipid oxidation, in the DPPH assay were revealed to be more effective than the essential oil [51]. On the other hand Lindera pulcherrima, Dodecadenia grandiflora and Dodecadenia gamblei presented the best inhibition of lipid peroxidation determined through the TBARS method as well as in the \u03b2-carotene bleaching test, but in the DPPH method, only Dodecadenia grandiflora was a powerful DPPH radical scavenger [44]. Another example was that reported [52] for Thymus vulgaris and Eugenia caryophyllus oils. In this assay, the authors found that the Thymus vulgaris oil had the best activity against lipid oxidation, whereas in the DPPH method, the authors found that Eugenia caryophyllus oil was the most potent scavenger of DPPH free radicals, even better than the standards ascorbic acid and BHT. The same authors also used the Rancimat test, and in that ase, the best oil was that of Origanum vulgare, although worse than that of the reference BHT. The non-polar fraction and essential oil of Hymenocrater longiflorus possessed great ability to inhibit the bleaching of \u03b2-carotene, nevertheless the results differed when the DPPH method was used. In this case, the essential oil was the only one that had the worst capacity for scavenging these free radicals [47]. Independent of the plant part of Myrtus communis var. italica L. used and the antioxidant method used, the methanolic fractions were always better antioxidants than the essential oils [46].

The reducing capacity of the essential oil was also higher than that of the volatile aglycone fraction.

There are several ways to ascertain the ability to form hydroxyl radicals. One of them is the deoxyribose test. This method includes a mixture of ferric chloride (FeCl3) and ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), which in the presence of ascorbic acid forms Fe2+-EDTA, and oxidized form of ascorbic acid. After addition of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), Fe3+-EDTA and HO\u2022 are formed. This is the so-called Fenton reaction, which generates the highly reactive hydroxyl radical (Fe2+ + H2O2 \u2192 Fe3+ + HO\u2212 + HO\u2022). Hydroxyl radicals that are not scavenged by any component of the mixture attack the deoxyribose and degrade it into several fragments. Some of these fragments are capable of reacting with thiobarbituric acid after heating and in an acidic pH, originating a pink pigment that can be quantified by spectrophotometry [5]. There are other methods that did not use deoxyribose but other components such as benzoic acid or safranine. Using these methods several authors have evaluated the hydroxyl radical scavenging ability of essential oils [51,53,54,57,83,84].",

On this way, there is a reduction of dioxygen to superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide. Superoxide anion can be generated by this system (the hypoxanthine - xanthine oxidase) or using a non-enzymatic reaction. In this case, superoxide anion is generated through the reaction of phenazine methosulphate in the presence of NADH and dioxygen.

The major source of TNF-\u03b1 is the cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage although T lymphocytes, neutrophils and mast cells also produce this pro-inflammatory cytokine. IL-1\u03b2 is produced by a variety of cells types, including monocytes, macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells [103]. The production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines may be induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that is an endotoxin localised on Gram negative bacteria cell walls capable to activate macrophages, stimulating the production of inflammatory cytokines [104]. However, Gram positive bacteria may also contribute to the stimulation in the production of cytokines. Lipoteichoic acid (LTA) represents a class of amphiphilic molecules anchored to the outer face of the cytoplasmic membrane in Gram positive bacteria that causes cytokine induction in mononuclear phagocytes and a synergism with peptidoglycan (PG) has been described resulting in higher cytokine levels [105].",

Other authors also found that eugenol on human macrophages (U937) under the stimulation of LPS blocked the release of IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 and PGE2 [119]. Whether some essential oils are able to inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, some of them, particularly lemongrass, geranium and spearmint and their main components (citral, geraniol, citronellol, and carvone), can also suppress TNF-\u03b1-induced neutrophil adherence responses [120]. According to these authors, those essential oils or their major components do not affect TNF-\u03b1 but do affect the neutrophil function to suppress their adhesion. Therefore and concerning lemongrass and citral and as reported above, they can also suppress IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 pro-inflammatory cytokines [117]. In other work, Lin et al.

Thyme essential oil, mainly constituted by p-cymene and thymol, only at high concentrations (5,000 mg/L) significantly inhibited total mRNA IL-1\u03b2 expression in the mouse colon in which colitis was induced by TNBS, not inhibiting significantly IL-6 expression [125].",

Upon activation of NF-\u03baB, I\u03baB-\u03b1 is phosphorylated by I\u03baB kinases (IKK) leading to proteasome-dependent degradation of I\u03baB, which allows a rapid translocation of NF-\u03baB into the nucleus where it binds to DNA. The most predominant NF-\u03baB dimmer activated is p65:p50. Translocation of p65:p50 to the nucleus results in the transcription of several proinflammatory genes, such as cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6) and inducible enzymes (iNOS and COX-2) [127,128].",

Citral exhibited an inhibitory activity in LPS-induced iNOS protein expression, not found for COX-2. The authors studied the effect of citral on NF-\u03baB pathway for enlightening the mechanism of the citral-mediated inhibition of iNOS transcription. The authors concluded that citral could prevent the degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 in LPS-induced inflammation and reduce the p50 NF-\u03baB levels in nuclear fractions [121]. In another study, it was reported that in human macrophage-like U937 cells, citral suppressed both LPS-induced COX-2 mRNA and protein expression, dose-dependently. Moreover, citral induced the mRNA expression of the PPAR\u03b1 and the PPAR\u03b3, suggesting that citral activates PPAR\u03b1 and\u03b3, and regulates COX-2 expression [147]. A same behaviour was observed for carvacrol. In human macrophage-like U937 cells, carvacrol suppressed LPS-induced COX-2 mRNA and protein expression, suggesting that carvacrol regulates COX-2 expression through its agonistic effect on PPAR\u03b3 [132]. However, this property of carvacrol was not as remarkable as was that of citral [147].",
