Among the non-coding transcriptome, there is a group of poorly studied transcripts longer than 200 nt and with low coding potential that have been collectively called long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) (1, 3). It has been estimated that there could be as many lncRNA genes as coding genes, but the number of lncRNAs is still growing and some authors consider that it could increase to up to ~200000 (4, 5). Therefore, there is a great need to identify novel lncRNAs and to understand their function and regulation.",

            "text": "Long non-coding RNAs genes are very similar to coding genes at the chromatin, DNA, and RNA level (6). Compared to mRNAs, most lncRNAs are more cell-type specific, less expressed, and less conserved at the nucleotide sequence level (7). Many lncRNAs have been shown to be functional. Some lncRNAs function to regulate the expression of neighboring or antisense genes by transcriptional interference, by recruitment of chromatin modifiers and remodelers, or by regulation of imprinting, editing, splicing or translation, and stability (8\u201312). Enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) and lncRNA-activating RNAs (lncRNA-a) are transcripts that control the expression of neighboring genes in \u201ccis\u201d (13\u201315). However, lncRNAs can also function in \u201ctrans,\u201d away from their site of synthesis. For instance, some pseudogenes regulate the expression of their parental gene, located in a distant genomic location (16\u201319). LncRNAs have especially emerged as regulators of development, pluripotency, and proliferation as some function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors (6, 12, 20\u201323). Therefore, several lncRNAs have been implicated in cancer and in other human diseases (24\u201326).",

            "text": "Proliferation, differentiation, and pluripotency factors regulate the expression of some lncRNAs (27). Besides, several signaling molecules, including those involved in the immune response, have been shown to induce the expression of specific lncRNAs (28\u201331). Induction of TLR2, TLR3, or TLR4 leads to the activation of lncRNAs, including lncRNA-COX2, which regulates the expression of several immune genes or NEAT1, which functions to increase the expression of some antiviral genes such as IL8 (32\u201334). Downregulation of IL1\u03b2-eRNA and IL1\u03b2-RBT46 lncRNAs decreases IL1\u03b2 and the accumulation of LPS-induced RNAs (34). Similarly, downregulation of lnc-IL7R decreases the LPS-induced inflammatory response (35). Treatment of THP1 macrophages with an innate immunity activator also induces the expression of several lncRNAs. One of them, linc1992 (or THRIL) activates the expression of TNF\u03b1 and other genes involved in the immune response (36). In turn, TNF\u03b1 also induces many lncRNAs in fibroblasts, including Lethe, a pseudogene that responds to NF\u03baB and inhibits NF\u03baB DNA-binding activity leading to reduced inflammation (37). Besides, dendritic cells (DCs), CD4+, and CD8+ T-cells express a specific set of lncRNAs that may regulate cell activation and differentiation (6, 38, 39). NEST lncRNA controls the IFN\u03b3 locus in CD8+ T-cells causing decreased Salmonella enterica pathogenesis (40, 41). Downregulation of lnc-DC, expressed in conventional DCs, impairs DC differentiation from monocytes, and reduces the capacity of DCs to activate T-cells (42). LncRNAs also respond to viral infections. Infection with enterovirus, influenza virus, HIV, hepatitis B, and C (HCV) viruses as well as the SARS coronavirus leads to altered levels of lncRNAs (33, 43\u201350) (Carnero et al., in prep). From the collection of infection-altered lncRNAs, it is difficult to distinguish those that respond to the virus from those that respond to the cellular antiviral pathways activated by the infection. Recently, some lncRNAs regulated by infection have also been found to be regulated by IFN\u03b1 in mice (46).",

            "text": "Interferon is a key molecule in the cellular antiviral response (51). Detection of pathogens by the cell triggers transcription of the interferon (IFN) genes. When type I/III IFN is released, it is sensed by the IFN receptors, which induce the JAK/STAT pathway. STAT1 and 2 coupled to IRF9 form a complex that binds IFN-stimulated response elements (ISRE) in the promoters of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and activates their transcription. ISGs induce an antiviral state by several means, including inhibition of viral replication, transcription, and translation. Well-characterized ISGs are Mx1, OAS, GBP1, but also STAT1 and IRF9, which amplify the IFN response. Further, STAT1 induces the expression of pro-inflammatory genes such as IRF1, a transcription factor that also activates ISGs, and whose induction is dependent on de novo protein synthesis (52, 53). Besides, IFN also induces the expression of negative regulators that limit the strength and duration of the IFN response (54\u201356). Finally, IFN activates expression of several miRNAs that contribute to the antiviral state or to the control of the IFN response (57).",

Therefore, we have performed a high-throughput analysis of lncRNAs whose expression is deregulated in response to IFN\u03b1. The conditions we used aimed to identify genes controlled by the IFN pathway directly or by other ISGs. The results show that several lncRNAs are controlled in response to type I IFN in several cell lines tested. The best candidates are lncRNA genes upregulated in response to IFN that are found in the genome adjacent to IFN-related coding genes. They have been called ISR2, 8, and 12. Interestingly, guilt-by-association genome-wide studies predict that the function of these lncRNAs is related to the cellular antiviral response and to viral infections. In fact, ISR2, 8, and their neighboring genes are also increased after infection of cultured cells with HCV. A similar increase is detected in the livers of patients infected with this virus or, in the case of ISR2, in blood cells of patients infected with HIV.",

Some ISGs are transcription factors able to regulate the expression of genes with antiviral potential in a secondary wave of IFN response. Other ISGs are inhibitory factors that function to decrease the response. Therefore, to identify lncRNAs regulated by IFN or by ISGs, one should analyze the transcriptome of cells treated by IFN at different time points. However, to simplify the analysis, we decided to check first whether we could find conditions showing a wide IFN response at a single time point. To this aim, we tested whether high doses of IFN could lead to increased expression of well-known ISGs even at late times post-IFN treatment. HuH7 cells were treated for 6, 24, 48, or 72 h with increasing doses of IFN\u03b12 up to 10,000 units/ml, and the expression levels of GBP1, IRF1, BST2, OAS, IL6, and ISG15 were evaluated by qRT-PCR (Figure 1). The results show that GBP1 and IRF1 are induced to highest levels at 6 h post-treatment, while BST2 and OAS are induced to similar levels at all times tested. In contrast, IL6 is only significantly induced at 3 days post-treatment (Figure 1 and data not shown). However, compared to untreated cells, a significant upregulation of all the genes, including GBP1 and IRF1, can be detected at 3 days post-treatment with 10,000 units/ml of IFN\u03b12 (Figure 1B). In fact, this dose induced the highest levels of these transcripts at most of the time points. Before analyzing the transcriptome of cells treated with 10,000 units/ml of IFN\u03b12 for 3 days, we confirmed that these conditions induced antiviral effects. When HuH7 cells infected with HCV were treated with these conditions, we indeed detected a drastic decrease in viral protein expression by immunofluorescence and a decrease in the levels of HCV viral genomes by qRT-PCR (data not shown).",

Many sequences corresponded to coding genes or seemed to be 3\u2032UTR extensions of coding genes and were discarded for further analysis. The remaining sequences corresponded to 48 genes, including 29 genes annotated as lncRNAs and 19 located in non-annotated areas of the genome (Figure 2D, Table S4 in Supplementary Material). Surprisingly, while 90% of coding genes were upregulated by IFN, only 54% of the lncRNAs were upregulated. Most of the downregulated lncRNAs corresponded to the non-annotated category. This suggests that there could be a relevant IFN-mediated repression of genes that more strongly affects lncRNAs. We named these genes IDRs, for IFN-downregulated RNAs, and accordingly named the IFN-stimulated RNAs ISRs. The fact that almost 40% of the ISRs and IDRs correspond to non-annotated areas of the genome suggests that the percentage of the genome able to react to different stimuli could be even larger than expected.",

Even though we did not observe a strong activation after TNF\u03b1 treatment, transcription factor chIP Seq from ENCODE showed that ISR8 and ISR12 promoters have NF\u03baB binding sites. Interestingly, the ISR8 promoter has sites for STAT1 and 2 as well as IRF1 and 2, suggesting that ISR8 could be a bona fide ISG. Besides the non-coding transcript that we name ISR8, six other transcripts could be expressed from the ISR8 area according to UCSC and Ensembl databases (Figure S2A in Supplementary Material). These transcripts have certain coding capacities and could be translated to proteins of up to 126 amino acids named C5ORF56. The syntenic region in the mouse also comprises non-coding transcripts together with transcripts with certain coding potential that lead to peptides no longer than 32 amino acids (data not shown). Only five amino acids in the N-terminal part of the putative protein predicted in mouse are conserved in human. Given the poor conservation and the short size of the predicted peptides all the transcripts from this mouse region could be classified as non-coding (80, 81). To analyze the expression of ISR8 and all the putative coding transcripts annotated in the human ISR8 area, we used qRT-PCR. The results show that most of the transcripts are poorly detected in HuH7 or HeLa cells treated or not with IFN. The highest expression is observed for the ISR8 lncRNA (Figure S2B in Supplementary Material).",

We compared the expression levels of ISR2, 8, and 12 and coding genes related to cellular antiviral pathways, used as positive controls, with the expression levels of all the genes represented in a SurePrint G3 microarray. We used data obtained from microarray experiments performed with 120 human samples of different origin. The results show a significant positive correlation between ISR8 and IRF1 (corr = 0.41 and p < 10e\u22120.5), indicating that these genes are co-regulated. Significant correlations were not observed for GBP1 and ISR2 or IL6 and ISR12. Furthermore, the correlation analysis of each candidate organized all the microarray genes from the ones with the highest positive correlation to the ones with the highest negative correlation. This matrix was used to search for GO categories with highly significant enrichment in genes that correlate positively (positive z-score) o negatively (negative z-score) with ISR2, 8, or 12. This analysis revealed that ISR2, 8, and 12 clustered very closely but away from other genes related with the IFN pathway and the antiviral response. ISR2, 8, and 12 showed a negative correlation with genes that significantly enriched GO categories related to viral processes including viral life cycle and viral transcription. ISR2 and 12 also shared a negative correlation with response to viral infection and IFN pathway genes. However, ISR8, similar to IRF1 and TLR3, showed a positive correlation with IFN signaling and immune response genes.",

To study this hypothesis, we evaluated the expression of these lncRNAs in cells infected with Ad5, a DNA virus, or RNA viruses such as influenza virus, SFV, or HCV. All of them have developed mechanisms to block the cellular antiviral response. Influenza virus control of IFN is exerted primarily by the influenza NS1 protein (59). Therefore, we also infected cells with an influenza virus mutant that lacks NS1. All the viruses used, with the exception of HCV, lead to a fast lytic infection that initiates cell death at 24 h post-infection in the case of influenza virus and SFV, or at 48 h post-infection in the case of Ad5. Therefore, several time points post-infection were evaluated in each case. The results show that ISR12 expression was not altered by infection (data not shown). ISR2 and ISR8 expression was only induced in cells infected with the influenza virus unable to control IFN at later times post-infection, when the IFN response is strongest (Figure 8). In general, the induction pattern was similar for GBP1 and IRF1.",

In the cells treated with IFN for 3 days, we found, with a very high statistical significance (B > 7), an upregulation of well-characterized ISGs such as Mx1, STAT1, IRF9, ISG15, BST2 and several members of the GBP, OAS, and IFI families (Figure 2).

This suggests that there could be an IFN-mediated repression of genes that affects more strongly lncRNAs. However, even if IDRs showed a generally decreased expression in the presence of IFN (Figure 3B), the downregulation was mild. Validation of downregulated genes showed that only IDR16 was strongly affected by IFN at late times post-treatment (Table S5 in Supplementary Material). Further experiments will be required to determine whether there is a relevant downregulation of lncRNA genes in response to IFN. Notably, the majority of the IDRs match with genomic regions that have not been associated with active transcription in public databases. This is surprising, as some of them such as IDR4, 7, 15, or 16 are expressed at high levels in HuH7 cells according to the qRT-PCR data (Table S5 in Supplementary Material). Therefore, it would be interesting to analyze IFN regulation of lncRNAs using RNASeq, as this may yield a more comprehensive picture of the lncRNA transcriptome and its manipulation by IFN. In fact, during the revision of this paper, another manuscript was accepted showing that transcriptome analysis by RNASeq allowed the identification of several lncRNAs whose expression is altered in response to IFN (82). Similar results have been obtained using RNASeq in our lab (Barriocanal et al., submitted).",

ISR1 was expressed at very low levels. In contrast, ISR2, 8, and 12 were well expressed in all cell lines tested and their expression was strongly induced by IFN at early (ISR2 and 8) or late times (ISR12) (Figure 4A). Furthermore, low doses of type I IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b2 also induced the expression of these ISRs (Figure 5 and data not shown). We did not detect significant induction of these ISRs, GBP1, IRF1, or IL6 with type III IFN\u03bb using doses able to induce other ISGs such as OAS, ISG15, or BST2 (data not shown). Further experiments are required to determine whether these genes could show some specificity for type I IFN, as the repertoire of genes that are induced by type III IFNs is essentially the same as those induced by type I IFNs (83). Finally, ISR12 was also induced after the activation of the NF\u03ba\u03b2 pathway by TNF\u03b1, LPS, or polyI:C (data not shown). This result is in line with the identification of NF\u03ba\u03b2 binding sites in ISR12 promoter by chIP Seq.",

ISR2 is in tandem and downstream of GBP6. It is very unlikely that ISR2 results from run-off transcription from GBP6, as GBP6 expression could not be detected in HuH7 cells (data not shown). ISR12 is in tandem and upstream of IL6 while ISR8 is convergent with IRF1. None of the transcripts annotated for ISR2 or ISR12 overlaps with the transcripts annotated for GBP6 or IL6, respectively (Figure S3 in Supplementary Material). However, the region of ISR8 and IRF1 is more complex. While ISR8 does not overlap with its coding neighbor IRF1, the IRF1 gene also transcribes a longer transcript of poor coding capacity called lncIRF1 (Figure 4B, Figure S2A in Supplementary Material). LncIRF1 expression is induced by IFN\u03b1 to similar levels than ISR8 (Figure S2C in Supplementary Material). As ISR8 is antisense to lncIRF1, they could potentially regulate each other by transcriptional interference or by antisense mechanisms, although only 17 nt of the mature form of ISR8 are antisense to the mature form of lncIRF1 (Figure 4B and Figure S2A in Supplementary Material).",

Instead, the promoters of these ISRs seem to be independent. ISR2 is located within the GBP locus, which could be indicative of a general co-regulation in response to IFN. The ISR8 and ISR12 promoters have NF\u03baB binding sites, although only ISR12 is reproducibly induced in response to TNF\u03b1 under the conditions tested. Furthermore, ISR8 seems a bona fide ISG as the promoter has sites for STAT1 and 2 as well as IRF1 and 2. In spite of this, the possibility exists that IFN activation of a coding ISG could result in an unintended recruitment of transcription factors to the promoter of lncRNAs located nearby. We do not think that this is a general phenomenon, as in the microarray or RNASeq analysis, we do not observe that many lncRNAs located close to ISGs are induced after IFN treatment. Besides, if such unintended transcription occurs, we would expect that the expression of ISR2, 8, and 12 should always correlate with the expression of their neighboring coding genes.

We did not observe significant responses of ISR2, 8, and 12 to other lytic viruses able to block the IFN response. However, both ISR2 and 8 were significantly upregulated in cells infected with HCV compared to controls.

However, the ISG expression profile of some patients with chronic HCV infections indicates that IFN is being produced by the infected cells as well as by neighboring cells (85). This may in turn explain upregulation of ISR2 and ISR8. Upregulation was also observed for the neighboring genes GBP1 and IRF1 but not for other ISGs such as OAS (Figure 8 and data not shown). This raises the question why the infection persist in spite of increased levels of antiviral factors? Different viruses are targeted by unique sets of ISGs (86). In the case of HCV both GBP1 and IRF1 have been shown to have antiviral potential (86\u201388). IRF1 overexpression on its own can activate a similar set of genes as IFN and can lead to a control of the replication of HCV and other viruses (86). Therefore, for infection to persist, the effects of IRF1 and probably other ISGs should be inhibited in infected cells (84). One intriguing hypothesis for future work is that this inhibition is in fact exerted by ISG lncRNA neighbors.",

The only preliminary evidence of an anti-IFN role is the highly significant anti-correlation between ISR2/ISR12 and key factors of the IFN pathway found by genome-wide guilt-by-association studies. Similarly, inhibition of a lncRNA located close to viperin, an ISG that also inhibits HCV replication, has been shown to increase the levels of many IFN-inducible genes (82, 89). Therefore, several lncRNAs could act as negative regulators of the IFN pathway. The guilt-by-association study also shows a positive correlation of ISR8/IRF1 and the IFN response, suggesting that ISR8 could have a positive role in the IFN pathway. One possible approach to further dissect the function of these ISRs in the future will be their inhibition via RNAi. However, resistance to RNAi is a common feature of many lncRNAs that locate in the nucleus away from the RNAi machinery or contain poorly accessible structured sequences. An alternative could be the use of gene editing technologies, provided that the function of the targeted lncRNAs is not essential for the cell, which would prevent their complete deletion. Moreover, it may also be feasible to overexpress selected lncRNAs from plasmids or viral vectors, in order to study gain-of-function phenotypes. In the long run, we are optimistic that these and other approaches will help to further delineate the potential role of lncRNAs in the IFN pathway and in the antiviral response.",
