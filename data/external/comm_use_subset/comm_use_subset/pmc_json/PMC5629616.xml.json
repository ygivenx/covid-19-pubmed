            "text": "Early methods for vaccine development were based on the micro-organisms themselves [1]. In contrast, the promise of successful subunit vaccines (epitope-driven vaccine) comes from antigens [2]. Our ability to design subunit vaccines depends on our ability to find good vaccine targets on the foreign object in question, it depends on our ability to find epitopes. There are numerous experimental techniques for B-cell epitope mapping [3], but doing this search experimentally, searching exhaustively by brute force, is an extremely time consuming endeavour. Thus, computational approaches are employed, and are the primary subject domain of computational vaccinology. Epitope prediction, the ability to predict with some probability whether a particular amino acid belongs to an epitope, can guide our experimental based search and save us a significant amount of time.",

Continuous epitopes, also known as linear epitopes, are formed by continuous sequences of residues. The majority of epitopes (90%) are within the conformational class [4], which are the result of 3D interaction of protein residues in close spatial proximity, but discontinuous on the actual protein sequence. Predicting both of these epitope types is a computationally difficult, and because conformational epitopes can be considered as clusters or spatially joined continuous epitopes, the prediction of continuous eptopes is an essential step for both problems. Finally, because there is a substantially larger amount of epitope sequence based data than there is structural, protein sequence based (as opposed to structure based) prediction is a much more feasible problem at this time.",

            "text": "In this work we present a sequence based continuous epitope predictor called DRREP (Deep Ridge Regressed Epitope Predictor). Our linear B-Cell epitope predictor is based on a deep neural network (DNN) [5], which utilizes a string mismatch function based first hidden layer, a second normalization pooling layer, an analytically computed third hidden layer, followed by another non-linear pooling layer, and a final fifth layer composed of a single threshold neuron. Our intuition is that because there is structure within protein sequences, and because we are dealing with sequences composed of characters, these structures and patterns are based on the k-mers within the sequences. Thus, a way to find and extract them, is through the use of string based activation functions, similar to methods applied in text mining. Because we do not know ahead of time the actual structures, lengths, and patterns of these k-mers, one way to solve the problem of exposing them is to generate a large number of our own random k-mer patterns, tiling the sequence with them, and counting how many, and which of our generated k-mers match the k-mers within the sequence being analysed. This k-mer tiling method extrapolates the protein sequence into a large feature space, which we can then cluster, separate, and classify through regression. In DRREP, we perform this regression step using the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse [6].",

These were built up experimentally, and based on the statistical correlation of a physicochemical property of a residue and it belonging to an epitope. Later systems used multiple propensity scales together, these systems include the likes of PEOPLE [9], PREDITOP [10], BEPITOPE [11], and BcePred [12]. A decade later, these propensity scales were coupled with various predictive algorithms, after it was shown that predictions based purely on propensity scales produce results only slightly better than random [13].",

The input to BepiPred was based on numerous physicochemical properties and protein secondary structure. In 2007 AAP [17] was released, and was the first predictor using a support vector machine based model, and proposed the use of a new type of antigenicity propensity scale.

Training is done in multiple phases. First, N number of 3 layer neural networks, called Sub_DRREPs, are generated and trained independently (each such Sub_DRREP network is composed of the DRREP\u2019s first 3 layers). The N networks are then stacked in parallel, with each network\u2019s output aggregated, and then normalized by the norm-pooling 4th layer. The normalized signals are then passed on to the threshold neuron in the 5th layer. The way this is performed, is by putting these sub-networks in parallel, to form a single, wider, deep network. Then the fourth layer is added, which normalizes and pools the outputs from these sub-networks. The fifth layer is composed of a single thresholding neuron. The scaling factor for each sub-network is based on its relative validation AUC score, which act as weights for the single thresholding neuron in the final 5th layer, which decides whether the input vector belongs to an epitope.

DRREP\u2019s sliding window moves through the long input sequence, and for each sliding window, DRREP\u2019s basic mismatch functions in the first hidden layer output the number of times their k-mer appeared in the window.

After the training and validation phases for the entire DRREP are completed, the synaptic weights for this neuron are set to the validation AUC scores of each Sub_DRREP, so that the voting contribution of each Sub_DRREP is based on its performance on the validation dataset. The neuron calculates its output in the standard linear neuron fashion, through the application of the dot product, resulting in the final output score. This output score can then further be passed through a threshold, so that the output is a classification rather than a score.

We base this hypothesis on the fact that we observed a number of cases where the score transitioned significantly between continuous sequences of epitope and non-epitope sequences, yet still held above the epitope threshold for both cases. Based on this observation, perhaps the system could be further improved by taking into account radical score transitions. This methodology is planned to be explored in our future research. From all the test datasets on which LBtope was tested, it performed the worst on SARS. For the tests performed, the version of LBtope used was based on the one trained on a fixed 20 residue window based dataset, which was used in the original LBtope publication. When using this version, the server does not predict the last residue, hence it was designated with an asterisk. An LBtope trained on flexible window based original dataset was also tested on SARS, because that version does predict the last residue, but it performed much worse than the version shown, and thus was not included. The Epitopia server also did not provide the classification for the 193rd residue in the SARS sequence. Another interesting anomaly in residue prediction results was produced by ABCPred. ABCPred server gives a score for 16 residue slices, with a default epitope score threshold set to 0.5. Based on this, ABCPred classified numerous such 16 residue slices as epitopes, and when combined together, this included all but the first two residues in the SARS sequence.",
