Most studies evaluate risk factors for increased severity in pregnant women [8,9,10,11] and few studies have analyzed the risk factors for death in pregnant women from influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. A systematic review study showed a higher risk of hospitalization in pregnant women with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, with relative risks ranging from 4.3 to 7.2. However, only one study showed a higher risk of death in pregnant women with influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 (RR 10.2) and seven studies presented no significant risks (0.3 to 1.3)[12]. Meta-analysis also showed no higher risk of death in pregnant women with pandemic influenza, OR 0.99 (95% CI 0.67 to 1.46)[8]. A higher risk of fetal abnormalities in pregnant women with both seasonal influenza virus infection and A(H1N1)pdm09 infection was reported. In addition, women with a diagnosis of A(H1N1)pdm09 infection had a higher risk of placental problems, antepartum haemorrhage, and antepartum complications [13].",

For each death (case), four controls were randomly selected from those who recovered. The cases and controls were identified from the SINAN, using the following variables for selection: RT-PCR (positive for influenza A/H1N1pdm09), final classification (confirmed), evolution (recovered or death), hospitalization (yes), date of hospitalization, hospital and residence in the S\u00e3o Paulo State. The controls were matched by epidemiological week of admission date of the case to adjust for possible variations in access to treatment and clinical protocols. All pregnant women had a laboratory confirmation of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 from a sample of respiratory secretions using the RT-PCR method, performed at the Adolfo Lutz Institute, the public health laboratory [15].",

It was possible to evaluate the gestational and neonatal outcomes, including those of pregnant women who delivered after hospital discharge. The main results suggest that an early search for care, the training of physicians for the proper treatment of pregnant women, and early antiviral administration can be protective factors against death. Another noteworthy result was the presence of unfavorable neonatal outcomes, with a significant proportion of stillbirths and miscarriages, low birth weights and lower Apgar scores among pregnant women who died. After hospital discharge, the patients had a favorable neonatal outcome. Pre-eclampsia was present in six percent of women who evolved to death and in less than one percent of those who survived. Despite the fact that all women who died had the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 infection as the main cause of death in their death certificate, we cannot rule out the possibility that pre-eclampsia may have contributed to their unfavourable outcome.",

Similar results were reported in studies that evaluated pregnant women infected with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 compared to women of childbearing age without infection[33], pregnant women with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 with severe disease [9,20] or women who gave birth to live newborns during hospitalization [10,34].

In the control women of the study who gave birth after hospitalization, these proportions were also high (62.5%, 13.2% and 7.7%, respectively).",

The notification of influenza through a new viral subtype associated with SARI was initiated during the pandemic; consequently, the sensitivity may have varied with time. The quality of information from medical records can differ between hospitals. The use of standardized hospital and home questionnaires minimized these difficulties during data collection. Although all hospital reports were reviewed, we were not able to establish the roles of other factors, such as secondary infections or obstetric factors, which could have contributed to death in the cases. The results presented in this study indicate that early treatment can prevent unfavorable outcomes in pregnant women and in their offspring and reinforce the need for the proper training of doctors for the clinical management of pregnant women and early administration of antiviral treatment. These findings also support interventions in situations of future pandemics and seasonal influenza with the goals of preventive measures and the organization of health services for the appropriate clinical management of pregnant women.",
