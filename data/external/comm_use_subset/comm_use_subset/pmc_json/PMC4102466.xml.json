Interestingly, synergistic induction of CXCL10 has been described with IFN \u03b3 in conjunction with HIV-1 in human astrocytes and macrophages and thought to play a role in HIV induced encephalopathy [14], [15]. This marked variety of pro-inflammatory molecules that elicit a synergistic response of CXCL10 in a wide variety of cell types is indicative of a highly conserved and likely biologically important cellular response. However, synergistic induction of CXCL10 in response to influenza and IFN \u03b3 in airway epithelial cells has not been previously reported.",

We further demonstrate that this synergy was mediated by the interaction between dsRNA (an intermediate of viral replication) and IFN \u03b3 in vitro and in vivo. In the follow-up mechanistic study, this synergism was found to be transcriptionally regulated as demonstrated by a chimeric promoter reporter gene assay. In addition, it was not dependent of the IFNAR pathway as neither the neutralizing antibody to IFNAR nor the IFNAR deficiency affected the synergism. Finally, NF\u03baB, but not STAT1, appeared to mediate this synergism.",

No tissues from patients diagnosed with lung-related diseases were used. All those lungs were either autopsy leftovers or were rejected for transplant. They were sent to us with arbitrary numerical code. No identity link to the actual patient can be identified. Protease-dissociated HBE cells were plated on Transwell\u00ae chambers (Corning) and were maintained in immersed culture conditions until they reached confluence when they were transferred to an air-liquid interface (ALI) culture condition [16], [17]. At air-liquid interface, the cells were maintained in a Ham\u2019s F12/DMEM (1\u22361) with the addition of transferrin (5 \u00b5g/ml), insulin (5 \u00b5g/ml), cholera toxin (10 ng/ml), epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml), dexamethasone (0.1 \u00b5M), bovine hypothalamus extract (15 \u00b5g/ml), BSA (0.5 mg/ml) and all-trans-retinoic acid (30 nM). Cells were maintained at ALI for 7 days and were placed in basal media devoid of the additives, with the exception of retinoic acid, overnight prior to the experiments. Recombinant IFN \u03b3 was purchased from R&D Systems and synthetic double stranded (ds) RNA (i.e. poly I:C) from EMD Biosciences. IFN \u03b3 was used at 50 ng/ml and poly I:C at 25 \u00b5g/ml. A neutralizing antibody to IFNAR was obtained from US Biologics and used at 2.5 \u00b5g/ml [18]. Both I\u03baB kinase and JAK inhibitors were purchased from EMD Biosciences and used at 5 \u00b5M.

When the signaling pathway was further examined, the treatment of IFN \u03b3 or dsRNA alone was found to induce robust degradation of I\u03baB, a surrogate of the activation of NF\u03baB pathway which is initiated by the reaction catalyzed by I\u03baB kinase.

In contrast, despite the activation of STAT1A and STAT1B by these treatments, no synergism was observed (Fig. 6B).

In this study, we seek to understand the modulation of an important chemokine-CXCL10 by the combined effects of IFN \u03b3 and viral infection. This is the first report documenting the observation and mechanism underlying the synergism between IFN \u03b3 and viral infection (or dsRNA treatment) in airway epithelial cells. IFN \u03b3 is a type II interferon and oftentimes elevated in the context of viral infection. It is generally accepted that direct innate antiviral defense is mediated by type I IFN. Indeed, we and others have shown that dsRNA (or virus)-induced epithelial derived type I IFN plays critical role in the airway antiviral defense [16], [21], [22]. In the present study, we demonstrate the synergy between dsRNA- and IFN \u03b3-induced signaling in the regulation of CXCL10. Interestingly, although dsRNA-induced CXCL10 depended on type I IFN pathway, the synergy between dsRNA and IFN \u03b3 was completely independent of it in both human and mouse epithelial cells. This lack of dependence was not due to the remaining residue of the IFNAR functionality in the antibody neutralization assay, because the epithelial cells from IFNAR deficient mice used in the Fig. 4A still preserved the synergistic response despite the loss of entire IFNAR expression. Thus, in the presence of IFN \u03b3, dsRNA (or virus)-induced signaling is very likely to be altered, which emphasizes the importance of studying the pathway crosstalk as demonstrated in the present study.",

Several of these studies have demonstrated that the transcription factor, NF-\u03baB, is involved in CXCL10 induction in a variety of systems [7]\u2013[9]. In contrast, very few studies have demonstrated that CXCL10 induction is dependent on an ISRE site in the promoter region. Kanda and co-workers found substance P and IFN \u03b3 induced synergism of CXCL10 in human keratinocytes was dependent on an ISRE site and two NF-\u03baB sites in the CXCL10 promoter located \u2212210 to \u2212221 of the transcription start site [12]. In addition, Majumder and co-workers found evidence that IFN \u03b3 and TNF \u03b1 act in synergy via p48 complexes with STAT-1\u03b1 binding to this same ISRE site in the CXCL10 promoter of human fibrosarcoma lines [23]. Evidence that similar synergism occurs at the transcriptional level in mouse cells has been demonstrated in a small number of in vitro studies [13], [24]. Using the murine fibroblast NIH 3T3 cell line, Ohmoir and co-workers established that an ISRE site and one of two NF-\u03baB sites in a 243 bp fragment flanking the transcription start site of the murine CXCL10 gene were critical for IFN \u03b3 and TNF \u03b1 induced synergy [24]. Our study has further extended these studies to the airway epithelial system in the context of viral infection, and the results apparently support the importance of NF\u03baB.",

CXCL10 secretion by HBE cells appeared to be polarized. The treatment with IFN \u03b3, dsRNA and combined treatments resulted in a progressively enhanced secretion of CXCL10 mainly from apical surface. In contrast, the basal secretions of CXCL10 protein in these cultures were much less. The gradient between the apical and basal compartments may have important implications in vivo leading to enhanced emigration of CXCR3 positive effector cells (primarily CD8+ T cells) to the airway epithelial microenvironment.",

This synergism is likely to be mediated by dsRNA-induced signaling both in vitro and in vivo, which is independent of the type I interferon receptor pathway. Furthermore, we demonstrate the 735 bp proximal region of the CXCL10 promoter plays a critical role in regulating this synergistic induction. This region of the CXCL10 promoter contains punitive ISRE and NFkB transcription factor binding sites. Therefore, further study has been carried out to demonstrate the involvement of NFkB, but not STAT1, in this synergism. This capacity for airway epithelial cells to markedly up-regulate CXCL10 likely has important consequences for CD8+ T cell and NK cell migration to the airway epithelial microenvironment following influenza virus infection.",
