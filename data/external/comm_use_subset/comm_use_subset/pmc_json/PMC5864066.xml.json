EBOV is considered a significant threat to public health and global security due to its potential to be used as a bioweapon [5\u20138]. Currently, no FDA-approved vaccine or therapeutic agents are available, and supportive care remains the standard for Ebola virus disease (EVD) treatment. Therefore, accelerated efforts in the development of therapeutics is a key objective in the EBOV research community, especially since the 2013\u20132016 EVD epidemic in Western Africa.",

However, the development of a screening assay to detect compounds with anti-EBOV activity was previously limited due to the difficulty of developing a suitable high-throughput screening system for a biosafety level-4 viral pathogen. Classical methods evaluate drug efficacy include the reduction of virus yield [15] or a decrease in viral RNA transcription as determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [16\u201318]. Recent therapeutic screening methods have transitioned from the classical methods of measuring viral inhibition to assays with the ability to be automated, resulting in higher-throughput. Assay chemistries have been developed to enable the homogeneous measurement of a variety of different endpoints such as cytopathic effect, viral protein or reporter gene expression, which can serve as markers of viral replication [19]. The growing interest in identifying drugs with activity against EBOV has resulted in a variety of assays and readouts for activity as well as cytotoxicity. The use of cell-based assays for high-throughput screening of compound libraries has increased steadily over recent years [20\u201323]. As cell-based assays monitor specific viral proteins and provide the means to screen for potent viral inhibitors intracellularly, these assays identify drug candidates with desired pharmacological properties in the primary drug-discovery pipeline.",

CD14+ monocytes were differentiated into MDMs by culturing for 6\u20137 days with recombinant human macrophage colony-stimulating factor (Bio-Techne, Minneapolis, MN, 216-MC-005) and conditioned medium from KPB-M15 cells (kind gift from Dr. Atsunobu Hiraoka, SCGF Research Laboratory, Kyoto, JP). Media were replaced every 2\u20133 days during the incubation for a total of 6\u20137 days. The cells were harvested and plated on desired 96-well plates 1 day prior to the drug screen assay. The differentiated MDMs were characterized by flow cytometry before assay initiation. Toremifene citrate (oral solution) tested in this study was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (CAS 89778-27-8; T7204-5MG).",

To generate virus stocks, EBOV/Mak was inoculated at an MOI of 0.01 in Vero C1008 cells (BEI resources, Manassas, VA, catalog NR-596). When the cytopathic effect was visible at day 5\u20137 after infection (51\u201375% of monolayer showing CPE), cell culture supernatants were harvested and clarified by centrifugation. The EBOV/Mak titer was determined by plaque assay in Vero E6 cells. Virus titers were measured using 10-fold serial dilutions of culture supernatant in triplicate infections of Vero E6 cell monolayers in 6-well plates. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 1 h (plates were rocked every 15 minutes), 2 ml of medium containing 2X MEM (Gibco), 1.25% Avicel (FMC Biopolymer), and 1X Antibiotic-Antimycotic (Gibco) were added to each well (2ml/well).

Virus spread effectively at 48 hpi with higher (1 to 3.3) MOI of Vero E6, Huh 7 cells and most of MOIs in MDMs (Fig 2A\u20132F). The infection in MDMs was saturated at 72 hpi at almost all MOIs (Fig 2E and 2F).

The cell layer frequently became fragile, and at later time points, the cell layer would lift off the well surface possibly because of increased exposure to virus, higher MOI, or manipulation of plates during the fixing/staining procedure (Fig 2G).

For reproducible data, we determined that the percentage of EBOV-positive cells should be kept within a range of 10 to 80% and the S/N ratio at 4 to 10. At lower S/N ratios (<4) or lower percentage of infected cells (<10%) distinguishing activity of a drug from non-activity becomes increasingly difficult. On the other hand, at higher S/N ratios (>10), when cell infection rate trends towards 80\u201390% and cells overgrow at later time points, the risk of a disrupted cell layer is greater. Cell layer disruption increases the variability of the assay. Therefore, the optimization of assay conditions (i.e., duration of infection, virus input) was carefully calibrated resulting in a compromise between signal strength and cell viability.",

The CELIA combines the advantage of specificity of an immunoassay with the high sensitivity of a chemiluminescent enzyme detection assay and is a simple and low cost screening assay [34, 35]. The CELIA was compared to the fluorescent assay (detected by regular plate reader or the HCI system) by testing the efficacy of toremifene citrate against EBOV infection in Huh 7 cells with a range of MOIs (0.1, 0.3, 1, and 3) at three different time points (24, 48 and 72 hpi). Assay parameters, signal-to-noise (S/N), and Z' factor, were compared between the assays (Table 3). At the earliest time point (24 hpi), the CELIA had higher sensitivity than the fluorescent detection assay as the Z' were in the acceptable range (>0.2) even at the lowest MOI of 0.1. In contrast, the fluorescent assay required higher MOIs for reliable data sets (Z'>0.2). At the 48 hpi time point, both detection methods generated high quality data sets with the CELIA providing improved Z' factors (>0.8). At 72 hpi, the CELIA and the fluorescent assay also produced excellent data using HCI for detection, while the fluorescent data detection by regular plate reader showed higher variability, maybe due to cytopathic effects. The EC50s and EC90s were determined on those data sets with acceptable Z\u2019 (>0.2) and overall there was good correlation between the different detection methods (Table 4). All detection assays demonstrated that higher MOI and longer times of exposure led to an increase of the EC50 values for toremifene citrate. In contrast, the EC90 values showed considerably lower fluctuations under the different conditions tested.",

Huh 7 cells showed more efficient and more reliable virus replication irrespective of passage number. Immortalized cancer cell lines are in general an easy choice for in vitro drug testing because they are easy to handle, propagate, expand, and plate on a week-by-week basis with relative consistency. In contrast, primary cell types such as human primary macrophages do not proliferate in cell culture and are ideally generated fresh from human blood upon use. For large scale testing, procuring the blood volumes needed for generating MDMs from a cumbersome isolation technique could be a challenge. MDMs demonstrated very efficient spread of virus through cell culture over time. Donor-to-donor variability precludes consistency, and in general, macrophages from different donors are not pooled. Despite of the constraints, testing a selection of drugs that are closer to human clinical studies in human macrophages makes sense to get a better idea on efficacy in a more relevant target cell.",

Readings are quick and conducive to handling large numbers of plates during screening. However, the quality of the cell layer cannot be monitored. HCI provides images of 1 or more fields of each well, and a nuclear stain can be added in parallel to indicate the viability of the cell layer. In the assay development phase, this tool is especially useful in identifying conditions that will ensure a healthy cell layer or identify issues such as plate corner or edge effects for assay quality control. One drawback is that not the whole well is imaged, but only a certain number of fields inside the well. It is important to pick the fields wisely to avoid bias or skewing of data. Scanning at least 8 fields per well is recommended for statistical purposes, but that will increase reading time per plate. The time to read and analyze the HCI data can take considerably longer than the data acquired with the regular plate reader. HCI measures different parameters such as percentage of EBOV-positive cells and mean signal intensity per cell. Both the regular plate reader and HCI have unique applications in a drug testing program.

The data indicate that if the amount of virus present in cells or tissues is high enough, the drug will be less active.

In contrast, the EC90 values were less affected by high MOI or longer time points, which may, therefore, be a more reliable parameter for comparing data sets between laboratories.",

However, our data show that the EC50 of a drug can range over more than a log based on testing conditions (e.g, MOI, time of endpoint, serum). Johanson et. al.[12] reported EC50s of 1.73 and 0.97 \u03bcM for toremifene with two different EBOV strains EBOV/Kik and EBOV/May, respectively, at 48 hpi with 0.4 MOI by CELIA using the 13C6 antibody. These data are comparable to the EC50 of 1.10 \u00b1 0.71 \u03bcM for EBOV/Mak determined in our assay under similar conditions (Table 4; MOI 0.3/ 48 hpi). Understanding how assays are performed and the potential variables is important, and caution should be used when using in vitro data for making decisions to advance a drug to in vivo studies.",
