Iron, as a critical cofactor for many host and bacterial enzymes, has provided the paradigm for our current understanding of nutritional immunity. Since the discovery of iron limitation by egg white ovotransferrin in the 1940s (3), the mechanisms underlying nutritional immunity and bacterial iron scavenging have been the subject of intense study (4). Many vertebrate-associated bacteria harbor high-affinity uptake systems targeting heme, an abundant iron-containing porphyrin cofactor (5).",

The predominant adult hemoglobin consists of a tetramer containing two \u03b1-globin and two \u03b2-globin protein subunits, each of which binds a single heme molecule for the coordination of oxygen. The Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus is well adapted to the human host and is a leading cause of skin and soft tissue infections, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and bacteremia (6). To acquire iron during infection, S. aureus has evolved a high-affinity hemoglobin binding and heme extraction system, termed the iron regulated surface determinant (Isd) system (7). Following the lysis of proximal erythrocytes via secreted bacterial toxins, the released hemoglobin is captured by receptors at the S. aureus cell surface (8, 9). The Isd system of S. aureus in part consists of cell wall-anchored IsdB and IsdH, which bind hemoglobin and haptoglobin-hemoglobin, respectively (9, 10).",

Additionally, IsdB is highly expressed in human blood (14) and a promising vaccine target (15), underscoring its importance in human disease. IsdB extracts heme from hemoglobin, and heme is subsequently passed across the cell wall and into the cytoplasm for degradation by the heme oxygenases IsdG and IsdI, liberating iron (16\u201320). Underscoring the importance of IsdB for pathogenesis, heme is the preferred iron source of S. aureus during murine infection (21). The cell wall-anchored IsdABCH proteins share between one and three NEAT (near transporter) domains for the coordination of hemoglobin or heme. IsdB NEAT1 binds hemoglobin while NEAT2 binds heme, tethered by an intervening linker (22). Consistent with the adaptation of S. aureus to colonize and infect humans, we previously found that S. aureus IsdB binds human hemoglobin more effectively than mouse hemoglobin, the common laboratory animal used to model S. aureus infection (13). These results suggest that hemoglobin variation among mammals dictates effective heme acquisition by S. aureus and other Gram-positive bacteria.",

            "text": "Previous work has demonstrated that pathogens can promote a rapid adaptation of host immunity genes through repeated bouts of positive selection (23\u201325). While adaptation during such evolutionary conflicts can take many forms, theoretical and empirical studies indicate that an elevated rate of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions in protein-coding genes is often indicative of recurrent positive selection (26, 27). To date, most empirical studies of host-pathogen \u201carms races\u201d have focused on viruses (28\u201331). Recently, we showed that the transferrin family of iron-binding proteins has undergone extremely rapid evolution in primates at protein surfaces bound by iron acquisition receptors from Gram-negative bacteria (32, 33). These findings are consistent with the existence of a long-standing evolutionary conflict for nutrient iron, whereby mutations in iron-binding proteins that prevent bacterial scavenging protect the host from infection and are favored by natural selection. While these studies have expanded our understanding of how pathogens shape the evolution of host genomes, they also raise the question of whether other components of nutritional immunity might be subject to similar evolutionary dynamics.",

In total, 27 \u03b1-globin and 30 \u03b2-globin orthologs were assembled for phylogenetic analyses using the PAML and HyPhy software packages (Fig. 1A; see also Materials and Methods), which use nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates to infer signatures of positive selection. Because globin genes have been shown to undergo gene conversion, which can distort inferred phylogenetic relationships (39, 40), all analyses were performed using both a well-supported species tree as well as gene trees generated using PhyML. All tests detected significant evidence of positive selection acting on both \u03b1- and \u03b2-globins using both species and gene phylogenies (see Data Set S1 in the supplemental material). Multiple analyses repeatedly identified two sites in \u03b1- and \u03b2-globins exhibiting strong signatures of positive selection (Fig. 1A). It became apparent that these rapidly evolving sites localized to similar regions of the \u03b1- and \u03b2-globin proteins, specifically, the N-terminal A helix and the hinge region between the E and F helices (Fig. 1B). In fact, the two sites exhibiting signatures of selection in the \u03b1- and \u03b2-globin A helices are at homologous positions. These parallel signatures of selection between \u03b1- and \u03b2-globins might indicate that a similar selective pressure has driven this divergence between primate species. To investigate whether bacterial heme-scavenging receptors are one such selective pressure, rapidly evolving sites were mapped onto a recently solved cocrystal structure between human hemoglobin and the IsdB protein from S. aureus (22). Notably, all four rapidly diverging hemoglobin residues are localized to the IsdB binding interface, in close proximity to the NEAT1 domain (Fig. 1C). Altogether, these findings indicate that primate globins have undergone rapid divergence at specific sites proximal to the binding interface of the S. aureus hemoglobin receptor IsdB.",

An established biochemical assay was used to measure the binding of hemoglobin by S. aureus, in which S. aureus cells recognize recombinant human hemoglobin as well as hemoglobin purified from blood in an IsdB-dependent manner (see Fig. S1). S. aureus exhibited significantly reduced binding of baboon and marmoset hemoglobin to the cell surface (Fig. 2A and S2). It was noted that the binding patterns did not strictly match the predictions based on host phylogeny, suggesting discrete large-effect substitutions in hemoglobin may contribute disproportionately to the recognition by S. aureus. We next determined the ability of primate hemoglobins to support growth of S. aureus as the sole iron source. Consistent with the whole-cell binding data, hemoglobins that were bound by S. aureus with low affinity were unable to support optimal bacterial growth, indicating that the capability to bind hemoglobin is a measure of the ability to utilize hemoglobin as an iron source (Fig. 2B and S3). Altogether, these results demonstrate that variation among primate globins dictates bacterial hemoglobin capture and heme-dependent growth.",

We therefore exploited the enhanced binding of human hemoglobin relative to that from baboon to examine the role of each globin subunit in this biochemical interaction. The ability of S. aureus to bind chimeric hemoglobins was measured, which revealed that both globins contribute to species specificity (Fig. 3A and S4A), as chimeras containing either human \u03b1- or \u03b2-globin were bound more effectively than baboon hemoglobin. However, \u03b1-globin appears to have a greater effect on human-specific capture, as the \u03b1-human \u03b2-baboon chimera bound significantly better than \u03b1-baboon \u03b2-human. Focusing on phylogenetic variation at the protein binding interface, \u03b1-globin T8 and N78 were found to both be proximal to the NEAT1 domain of IsdB (Fig. 3B and C). Mutagenesis of the N-terminal alpha helix of human \u03b1-globin revealed that substituting the Thr residue of human \u03b1-globin with the Lys residue of baboon \u03b1-globin at position 8 reduced binding by S. aureus (Fig. 3D and S4B and C). Additionally, replacing A5D, T8K, and N9H in human \u03b1-globin, which converts this seven-amino-acid region (Fig. 3B), with those of baboon \u03b1-globin leaves S. aureus binding nearly indistinguishable from that of baboon hemoglobin. These results demonstrate that the N-terminal helix of \u03b1-globin makes a major contribution to human-specific hemoglobin recognition by S. aureus. Next, the relative importance of the rapidly evolving N78 residue in \u03b1-globin was assessed, which lies N terminal to the sixth alpha helix (Fig. 3B). The substitution of N78 for a glutamine (present in baboon, talapoin, and other Old World primates) or a histidine reduced the binding of human hemoglobin (Fig. 3E and S4D). Thus, substitutions at multiple residues in \u03b1-globin that exhibit signatures of repeated positive selection are sufficient to disrupt the ability of S. aureus to recognize human hemoglobin.",

Therefore, the contribution of rapidly evolving residues in \u03b2-globin to this binding interaction was investigated (Fig. 4A). Both S9 and A76 interact closely with the NEAT1 domain of IsdB (Fig. 4B). The effect of replacing the human \u03b2-globin S9 and A76 with residues found in other primate species analyzed in this work was systematically tested, which revealed that A76 is particularly important for binding by S. aureus (Fig. 4C and S5). Notably, baboon and human \u03b2-globins differ at both positions 9 and 76, suggesting that these residues contribute to the inability of IsdB to bind baboon hemoglobin. These differences might also explain the different binding affinities between human hemoglobin and the human \u03b1-globin baboon \u03b2-globin chimera, observed in Fig. 3A. As for \u03b1-globin, no single residue substitution improved binding by S. aureus IsdB, consistent with the hypothesis that IsdB has specifically adapted to bind human hemoglobin. Taken together with earlier data, residues at the IsdB interface of both \u03b1-globin and \u03b2-globin contribute to the recognition of hemoglobin by S. aureus. This is consistent with the NEAT1 domain of multiple IsdB monomers engaging in hemoglobin capture by binding both \u03b1- and \u03b2-globins, as observed in the reported cocrystal structure (22).",

Therefore, IsdB variation among congeneric Staphylococcus argenteus and Staphylococcus schweitzeri was assessed. These recently diverged taxa (Fig. 5A) are both primate associated and, unlike most other staphylococci, harbor IsdB. We measured the ability of IsdB from S. argenteus and S. schweitzeri to bind hemoglobin by expressing them ectopically in S. aureus lacking the native isdB gene. Consistent with their overall high sequence identity, S. schweitzeri and S. argenteus IsdB bound primate hemoglobin with a similar pattern of species preference as S. aureus (Fig. 5B and S6). However, both the IsdB of S. schweitzeri and S. argenteus displayed reduced binding of talapoin hemoglobin, and S. argenteus IsdB did not bind marmoset hemoglobin significantly less than human hemoglobin.

Estimations of divergence in the Staphylococcus genus have been lacking; however, the Kloos hypothesis (41) contends that staphylococci have coevolved with their mammalian hosts over long evolutionary timescales. In support of this concept, primate specificity among staphylococci has been reported, including S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. warneri, as well as avian (S. gallinarum), equine (S. equorum), and other taxa. Indeed, it has been proposed that the canine-associated S. pseudintermedius diverged from S. aureus simultaneously with the divergence of Primate and Carnivora orders (42). Most staphylococci are commensal organisms, while S. aureus is uniquely adapted to infect deep tissue and cause disease. As such, the IsdB system is only harbored by S. aureus and closely related primate-associated staphylococci. By narrowing our analysis of hemoglobin evolution to primates, we were thus able to assess specific biological features of primate-associated staphylococci.",

S. aureus asymptomatically colonizes the anterior nares of approximately one-third of the human population yet is capable of causing a wide range of invasive diseases. While some bacterial colonization factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis, many virulence factors have evolved highly specific targets that are not obviously involved in nasal colonization (43). As such, we cannot definitively conclude that IsdB evolution has been driven by selection during invasive disease. It is also likely that variation across IsdB sequences of S. aureus, S. argenteus, and S. schweitzeri may be the results of antigenic variation to evade the immune system. By focusing on the hemoglobin binding pocket of IsdB, we have been able to pinpoint critical variations for hemoglobin specificity.",

In particular, rapidly evolving sites in the \u03b1- and \u03b2-globin A-helices are predicted to be homologous on the basis of the predicted protein alignments. Our results suggest that these correlations reflect selection in response to NEAT domain-containing bacterial receptors like IsdB with conserved globin-binding sites. A well-established body of literature has shown that other selective pressures play important roles in the patterns of hemoglobin polymorphism and divergence across vertebrates, including the adaptation to high altitude and malaria resistance (34, 38). It is therefore possible that the signatures of selection detected in our study were driven by pressures other than nutritional immunity. Nonetheless, our empirical results demonstrate that variation in hemoglobins at discrete sites has important functional consequences for bacterial iron acquisition.",

In addition to aforementioned sickle-cell alleles, dozens of hemoglobin mutations in humans have been reported that contribute to genetic disease, including anemia and thalassemia (46). Thus, despite identifying particular sites that are highly divergent among primates, much of the globin gene content is constrained due to purifying selection.

These findings provide a fundamental new perspective on vertebrate globin evolution, highlighting nutritional immunity as a selective pressure that might strongly impact divergence and natural selection. Future studies will assist in illuminating how these combinations of adaptive mutations contribute to hemoglobin function and host physiology. An understanding of the genetic and molecular determinants of bacterial pathogenicity is critical for developing new antimicrobial treatment strategies, particularly as major pathogens such as S. aureus continue to develop resistance to existing antibiotics. Combining comparative genetics with molecular experimentation in turn provides not only a historical perspective of host-microbe evolutionary conflict but also mechanistic insights on modern human infectious disease.",

The cells were incubated with hemoglobin or PBS for 30 min at 37\u00b0C with shaking, and then the cells were collected by centrifugation at 4\u00b0C at 8,000 \u00d7 g. Cells were washed thrice by pipetting with 1 ml ice-cold PBS and centrifuging at 4\u00b0C at 8,000 \u00d7 g. After the final wash, the cells were resuspended in 30 \u00b5l 0.5 M Tris (pH 8.0; Fisher) containing 4% SDS (Fisher) and heated at 90\u00b0C for 5 min to remove surface-bound proteins. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 8,000 \u00d7 g, and the eluate was added to 6\u00d7 loading buffer and heated at 90\u00b0C for 5 min. The samples were subjected to 12% or 17.5% SDS-PAGE and silver stained (GE, Boston, MA). The gels were imaged using an Alpha Innotech Alpha Imager or Bio-Rad ChemiDoc MP imaging system. Quantification was performed by densitometric analysis with Image J (NIH) according to the software instructions and by quantifying the area under the peak that corresponds to the hemoglobin band, excluding background density. Because of the variation in stain intensity and quantity of nonspecific bands across gels, all comparisons were made within the same gel, and the relative density was calculated for each biological replicate within the same gel; the comparison was either to human hemoglobin or wild-type IsdB, depending on the assay. Additionally, PBS-only samples and S. aureus \u0394isdB::erm were used to verify that hemoglobin binding in this assay is IsdB dependent (Fig. S4C, S5, and S8) as previously observed, and that recombinant human hemoglobin is bound equally as well as hemoglobin purified from human blood (Fig. S1) (11, 13).",
