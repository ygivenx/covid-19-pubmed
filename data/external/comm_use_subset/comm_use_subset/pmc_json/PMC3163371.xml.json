            "text": "African sleeping sickness remains one of the most neglected life threatening diseases that have been left untreated till date. Two forms of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) have been identified that are parasite dependent. The first one Trypanosoma brucei gambiense (T. b. gambiense) causes a human chronic infection, endemic in Western and Central Africa while the other Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (T. b. rhodesiense) has a vast animal reservoir and causes acute illness in people in eastern and Southern African countries. HAT has high occurance in the remote rural areas, where the surveillance is weak or nonexistent, with 50 to 70 thousand estimated cases. According to World Health Organization (WHO) estimation there are half-million cases of HAT or \u201csleeping sickness\u201d resulting from infections with T. brucei rhodesiense and T. brucei gambiense. WHO has attributed 50.000 deaths annually to the disease [1]. By more recent estimates, up to 25.000 new cases occur per year, and 50 million people are at risk [2, 3].",

Because suramin and pentamidine are ionized at physiological pH, they are unable to cross the blood brain barrier in therapeutic concentrations and are thus used for the treatment of hemolymphatic early stage HAT, caused by T. b. rhodesiense and T. b. gambiense infections, respectively. The treatment of the second or neurological stage, when the parasites invade the central nervous system (CNS), relies on the organo-arsenical drug melarsoprol and the more recently registered eflornithine. The latter is ineffective against T. b. rhodesiense sleeping sickness and is used primarily to control CNS-involved HAT caused by T. b. gambiense. All the existing anti-trypanosomal therapies suffer from unacceptable toxicity, poor efficacy, difficulties of administration, and increasing treatment failures due to the development of parasite resistance [4\u20139]. In the last couple of decades, no new drug has been developed for treatment of early-stage HAT, and only one drug has been developed for late-stage HAT [1, 3, 5]. The need is great for new orally active drugs for the control and eradication of this disease.",

            "text": "Large numbers of structurally related congeners of pentamidine were synthesized by Tidwell RR et al [24] by introducing substitutions on the cationic groups, changing the position of dications from 4,4\u2032 to 3,3\u2032 position, changing the length of the aliphatic chain between the two aromatic rings, adding substituent on the aromatic rings at 2,2\u2032 and 3,3\u2032 position and replacing oxygen atoms in the alkyl linker with isosteric sulfur or nitrogen atoms (Figure 2a\u2013g). On comparing the activities of the synthesized compounds with pentamidine and melarsoprol, it was found that few compounds showed activity in the range or better than that of pentamidine and/or melarsoprol. The unsubstituted diamidine compound 64 (Figure 3a) with secondary amino group in place of oxygen atom exhibited subnanomolar activity (<0.001 \u03bcM) against T. b. rhodesiense and was nearly twice as selective against the pathogen as pentamidine. At the same time the diimidazoline compound 66 (Figure 3b) exhibited the second highest anti-trypanosomal activity in the series with the IC50 value of 0.001 \u03bcM and also had the highest parasite selectivity (SIT= 34500), being 63 times more selective against T. b. rhodesiense than pentamidine. The replacement of oxygen atom with sulphur atom as in compound 62 (Figure 3c) also generated active congeners having IC50 (0.005 \u03bcM) value better than that of pentamidine (0.007 \u03bcM). The compounds 20\u201331 (Figure 2c) in which the cationic groups were present in the 3,3\u2032-position of the aromatic rings and the length of the carbon linker was varied from 3\u20136 exhibited lower anti-trypanosomal activity compared to pentamidine whereas among the compounds 12\u201319 (Figure 2b) of the series, in which the amidine groups were present at 4,4\u2032 position and the length of aliphatic chain was varied from three carbon atoms to six carbon atoms, compound 12 (Figure 3d, IC50=0.007 \u03bcM) with three methylene linker between the aromatic rings had same in vitro activity as that of pentamidine (0.007 \u03bcM). Further introduction of 2,2\u2032-dichloro substituent in compound 12 improved the anti-trypanosomal properties as evident from the in vitro activity of compound 32 (Figure 3e, IC50=0.004 \u03bcM).",

            "text": "Increased efficacies of pyridyl analogues of 2,5-bis(4-amidinophenoxy)furan (furamidine) [25\u201327] encouraged Tidwell RR et al [28] to synthesize pentamidine analogues in which the phenyl rings of pentamidine were replaced with pyridyl fragments. This replacement resulted in series of 18 compounds (Figure 4a), most of which had lower cytotoxicity than pentamidine. SAR study pointed out that the antiprotozoal properties of these compounds depended on the placement of cationic moieties on the pyridine rings as well as the nature of substituents on the amidine groups. The N-substituted congeners were lesser cytotoxic than the unsubstituted diamidines whereas the N-alkylation of cationic fragments reduces the activity of compounds against T. brucei rhodesiense compared to pentamidine. A same trend was observed in pentamidine analogues series. The 2, 6-substituted dications (compounds 11\u201313, figure 4a) and 2,4-substituted dications (compounds 14\u201318, figure 4a) displayed lower potencies against T. brucei rhodesiense than the corresponding 2,5-substituted isomers (compounds 1\u201310, figure 4a), while among the 2, 5-substituted dications, the compounds possessing cationic substituents adjacent to nitrogen atoms in pyridine rings displayed superior activities against parasites compared to pentamidine as evident from compound 6 (figure 4b) which showed promising anti-trypanosomal activity (0.001\u03bcM) and lower cytotoxicity (4.90\u03bcM) than pentamidine and melarsoprol, but had poor in vivo activity giving only 1/4 cures in the STIB900 mouse model. However diamidoxime compound 9 (Figure 4c), an oral prodrug of diamidine compound 6 (Figure 4b), exhibited excellent in vivo activity curing four out of four animals upon oral administration in STIB900 mouse model. Although compound 9 did not provide cure in the CNS mouse model of infection but its BBB permeability could potentially be improved by developing prodrug using lipophillic substitutions in place of hydrophilic substitution as used in compound 9. This could provide higher concentration of compound 6 in CNS.",

The replacement of oxygen atoms in alkyl chain with secondary amino group improves the activity against T. b. rhodesiense of pentamidine analogues while in case of pyridyl analogue the compounds with oxygen atoms in the alkyl chain have been the active one. The most potent compound of these two series are compound 6 (Figure 4b) and compound 66 (Figure 3b), which have excellent in vitro activity (0.001\u03bcM) better than pentamidine and melarsoprol and also have high selective against the T. b. rhodesiense parasite as evident from their selectivity index (SI of compound 6 = 4900 and compound 66 = 34500 \u03bcM). Initially it has been believed that the oxygen atom in the aliphatic linker and the amidine groups are important for anti-trypanosomal activity of pentamidine as these groups were part of recognition motif for P2 amino purine transporter in trypanosoma species. Thus the activity of compound 6 can be explained on this basis, but in case of compound 66 the amidine groups have been replaced by imidazoline and the oxygen atom has been replaced by secondary amino groups. Despite these replacements, the compound has shown excellent in vitro and in vivo activity. Thus this is in accordance to recently reported work [29] according to which there is no direct connection between the affinity for P2 carrier and anti-trypanosomal activity.",

As observed in most of the dicationic molecules, the N-substituted congeners were lesser cytotoxic than the unsubstituted diamidines whereas the N-alkylation of cationic fragments reduced the activity of compounds against T. brucei rhodesiense compared to pentamidine. At same time the 5-substituted bisbenzofurans were generally less cytotoxic than compounds bearing substituents in the 4- or 6-positions where as the 4-substituted bisbenzofurans were significantly less active against T. b. rhodesiense than corresponding 5- and 6-substituted isomers. The in vitro activity of the bisbenzofuran series was not so promising and only lead compound 8, (Figure 5b) exhibited in vitro anti-trypanosomal activity (0.008 \u03bcM) comparable to that of pentamidine and melarsoprol. However some compounds from Tidwell series (Figure 7b) showed reduced cytotoxicity profile compared to pentamidine (for example compound 43 has cytotoxicity of 1.85 \u03bcM), but had very poor selectivity profile. Thus was proved that the selectivity of bisbenzofurans against T. b. rhodesiense decreases as number of methylene groups in the alkyl bridge increases.",

Among the three series the 2-phenylbenzofuran derivatives are attractive molecules because of their high activity, low cytotoxicity and high selectivity against the HAT parasite. The introduction of phenoxy fragment into the aromatic ring protects the phenylbenzofuran dervatives from metabolic deactivation. This structural modification retains affinity for the aminopurine P2 transporter. The diamidine and the hydroxy or methoxy group may be involved in binding to the DNA minor groove.

Two other analogues of furamidine (Figure 11b &c) have been evaluated against T. b. rhodesiense mouse model and have shown promising results. One approach to enhance the activity of furamidine has been the replacement of the central furan ring with other heterocyclic systems, including thiophene, pyrrole, oxazole, oxadiazole, thiadiazole, pyridazine, methylpyrimidine, and triazine [37\u201341]. Such structural modification in past has resulted into compound with good anti-parasitic activity.

Among these, six compounds have produced cures in mice at submilligram dosage levels and have been somewhat more active in this screen than stilbamidine, hydroxystilbamidine, and pentamidine. In 1994 Boykin DW et al have reported the synthesis of dicationic diaryltriazines nucleic acid binding agents, while in year 1998 Boykin DW et al have also reported the anti-Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia activity of dicationic diaryl methylprimidines. Dann O et al in the year 1975 have reported that 3,5-bis(4-amidinophenyl)isoxazole (Figure 13b) which is the most structurally similar to furamidine, is reported to have high activity against a murine T. brucei rhodesiense modelc [42]. However most of these compounds have received very little attention since. Recently the optimization of the few of the compounds has been reported and as a result several lead compounds have been synthesized. Here in are listed some of the compounds.",

Among 43 synthesized dications, the compounds with at least one p-amidine moiety (compound 22, Figure 13a and compound 3, Figure 13b), displayed good IC50 values (3.5 nM and 5.1 nM respectively) comparable to that of furamidine (4.3 nM) while loss in potency was observed in compounds with substituted diamidine at m-position (compound 32, IC50=29 nM, Figure 13c). In general, the introduction of nitro, chloro, or methoxy substituents on either aromatic ring resulted in decreased anti-trypanosomal activity. However, the introduction of methoxy group on the aromatic rings of compound 32 resulted into compound 41 (Figure 13b) with comparable anti-trypanosomal activity (4.2 nM) as that of furamidine. Hence these compounds of the isoxazole series that showed good in vitro anti-trypanosomal activity and less cytotoxcity profile relative to furamidine, could be a candidate for further evaluation against animal models of the diseases.",

The 1,2,3-triazole fragment was used because it was a suitable isosteric replacement for the central five-membered ring of furamidine [45\u201355] and also because 1,4-diphenyl-1,2,3-triazoles showed geometrical resemblance to furamidine. It was observed that the cytotoxicities of triazoles were as lower compared to that of pentamidine and were not affected by the alkylation on the amidine groups or the substitution on the aromatic rings. However, the placement of the cationic moiety in the 4-position increased the cytotoxicities of diamidines 46 (Figure 15) with respect to the pentamidine. Except few, majority of unsubstituted diamidines exhibited higher in vitro activities against T. brucei rhodesiense than bis(N-isopropyl)amidines and diimidazolines. The compounds with cationic fragments in the 5,5\u2032-position (compounds 1\u201315, Figure 14a) of the aromatic rings were in most cases less potent against T. brucei rhodesiense than isomers bearing at least one cationic moiety in the 4- or 4\u2032-position (compounds 16\u201360, Figure 14b\u2013d). However compound 46 (Figure 15) with dicationic moiety at 4,4\u2032 position showed excellent in vitro activity (0.004 \u03bcM). The introduction of the hydroxy group in the 2-position of the phenyl ring significantly reduced activities and increased the cytotoxcity against T. brucei rhodesiense because of the formation of the intramolecular hydrogen bond between the hydrogen atom of the 2-hydroxy group and the 2-nitrogen of the triazole ring. The in vivo analysis of compound 46 showed that when administered at 4 \u00d7 5 mg/kg, 4 \u00d7 1 mg/kg and 1 \u00d7 10 mg/kg by the intraperitoneal route it cured all the infected animals in the acute mouse model of African trypanosomiasis.",

Based on this they showed that bisguanidine and especially bis(2-aminoimidazoline)diphenyl compounds displayed potent anti-trypanosomal activity in vitro and vivo against T. b. rhodesiense, the causative agent of acute HAT [58, 59]. Among the 62 compounds screened, compounds1c, 28b, 32b and 41b (Figure 17) showed excellent in vitro activity (49nM, 69 nM, 22 nM and 118 nM respectively) as well as high selectivity (>5294, 3072, 29.5 and 881 respectively) for the parasite. These studies revealed that compounds bearing 2-aminoimidazoline cations had higher selectivity for the parasite and similar activities with respect to their guanidine counterparts. In addition, a correlation between anti-trypanosomal activity and DNA binding affinity was observed, suggesting a possible mechanism of action for these compounds. Those molecules that showed an excellent in vitro activity as well as high selectivity for the parasite represent new anti-trypanosomal lead compounds.",

According to SAR study the replacement of methylfuran with other groups like furan, phenyl, pyridinyl, thiophene led to decrease in activity. Also the replacement of Br with H or F reduced the activity while Cl group retained the activity. At 4th position the NH and NMe groups were equally active. The alkylamines at R1 were active whereas the simple alkyl or aryl groups led to inactive compounds. The second series was based on the pyrimidopyridazine scaffold (Figure 18b), in which the compound 49 (Figure 19b) showed promising inhibitory activity of 2.6 \u03bcM. In case of series 2 replacement of methyl group at R1 position by H led to the decrease in activity. At R2 position methyl and ethyl group showed activity while the H and chain extensions to propyl, butyl and cyclopentane led to decrease in activity. Substituted phenyl and alkenylphenyl group at R3 position gave the most active compound of the series.

In course of this a total of 53 compounds were evaluated in vitro for their anti-trypanosomal activity and cytotoxicity. The compounds with oxygen atom at 6th position were the most active compounds in the series, for example compound 9 (Figure 21) showed better anti-trypanosomal activity (0.007 \u03bcM) and low cytotoxicity (6.8 \u03bcM) than melarsoprol (IC50 = 0.008\u03bcM and cytotoxicity = 7.9\u03bcM). Whereas compounds lacking the 6-oxygen atom or bearing an oxygen atom at the 7-position rather than the 6- position were far less potent than those containing an alcohol or acyloxy group at the 6-position. Compounds carrying aliphatic or a 2-phenylacetyl ester side chains were as potent and selective as their benzoylated or acetylated counterparts. However compound 9a was unstable due to auto-oxidation, so the unstable alcohols were esterified to generate prodrug 10a (Figure 21) having promising activity of 0.014\u03bcM against these parasites and a selectivity index of 1700. The in vivo evaluation of compound 10a in a murine model of African trypanosomiasis showed good results as the prodrug extended the lifespan of mice infected with T. b. brucei.",

The compound also showed good in vivo activity as it delayed parasitemia and extended survival in infected mice. According to structure-activity analysis the compounds with enhanced potency included alkylamino substitutions on N-6, methoxy groups on C-2 and C-3, and a methylenedioxy bridge between C-8 and C-9. Testing of indenoisoquinolines with promising activity on L1210 mouse leukemia cells revealed all the compounds were more effective against trypanosomes than against mammalian cells. The indenoisoquinolines also showed appreciable water solubility indicating that these compounds have good quality for drug development. These compounds showed their anti-trypanosomal action by multiple mechanisms. The study indicated that they stabilize topoisomerase-DNA complexes in situ and may also impede topoisomerase binding to DNA. These agents markedly inhibited DNA synthesis by interfering with topoisomerase and possibly other DNA-metabolizing enzymes.",

The modifications in the quinolone core nucleus (Figure 24) led to characteristic in vitro activity and toxicity. The metal quinolone UL 5 (Figure 25a) with F group at the position 6 and piperazin at R7 position was the most potent compound with IC50 values of 100 ng/ml. DW 271 (Figure 25b), thiazolopyrazine incorporated tetracyclic quinolines Kanebo 8g and Kanebo 8h (Figure 25c), and the two sulphanyl fluoroquinolones N (CH3)2SNx and OCH3SNx (Figure 25d) were also active, with IC50 concentrations in the range of 300 ng/ml up to 900 ng/ml. Some of the DuPont compounds, developed as anti-tumour drugs, were highly active but also showed high cytotoxicity on HT-29 cells. It was observed that the position R1 and position R2 in the quinolone core nucleus was not prerequisite for anti-trypanosomal activity and also substitution at R8 position was not necessary for trypanocidal activity. Thus, based on the result obtained from SAR analysis special attention should be given to R7 position and the tetracyclic derivatives. The in vivo results of these compounds were very poor, as none of the compounds evaluated produced cure of mice in dose escalation experiment up to 100mg/kg i.p. However no signs of toxicity were observed during the experiments. The in vivo ineffectiveness had not been explained and no drug level determination in the plasma of the treated mice was performed.",

Initial clinical study has shown that DFMO + nifurtimox are superior to DFMO + melarsoprol and melarsoprol + nifurtimox. The DFMO + nifurtimox regimen (NECT regimen) allowed reduction in DFMO regimen from 14 to 7 days (56 versus 28 infusions) with a 94% cure rate and are associated with significantly reduced adverse side effects as compared to melarsoprol-based therapy.

Preliminary results indicated that this route might be successful, and lead structure A (Figure 26) was used as a starting point for the synthesis of two series of analogues. In the first series, the influence of structural changes of the central core unit was investigated while in the second series, the effect of additional methyl substituents on the 1,3,5-triazine was studied. The compounds were designed with the intention to selectively target the interior of T. brucei via the P2 amino-purine transporter. In the first series the compound containing the n-dodecyl chain as core unit, showed weak activity against T. b. rhodesiense. The compound with n-nonyl chain was the most promising compound and its various analogues were designed by replacing NH2 groups on the triazine ring with NHMe and NMe2 groups. Introduction of one or two methyl groups per triazine unit resulted in a 10-fold increase in anti-trypanosomal activity. When four methyl groups per triazine unit were introduced, an 80-fold increase in activity was observed. Similarly, replacement of NH2 group in n-dodecyl chain led to 2\u201320-fold higher anti-trypanosomal activity for the methylated derivatives. Monosubstituted compounds showed a slight increase in activity against T. b. rhodesiense as compared to the disubstituted compounds. The methylamino substituted triazines attached to the C9- (compound 8c, Figure 27) or C12-(compound 8f, Figure 27) polyamine precursor via an additional CH2 linker resulted in most active trypanocidal compounds(IC50 of 8c = 0.27\u03bcM and 8f = 0.18 \u03bcM). Beside good activity, the compounds showed poor in vivo activity producing no cure to the infected mice and concentrations greater than 10 mg kg\u22121 induced severe acute toxicity.",

The two compounds, 4-[3-(4-phenoxyphenyl)-1H-pyrazol-5-yl]morpholine (1.0\u03bcM) (Figure 29a) and 1-[3-(4-phenoxyphenyl)-1H-pyrazol-5-yl]piperazine (1.1 \u03bcM) (Figure 29b) with a pyrazol ring, are the most potent anti-trypanosomals of the series and have same cytotoxicity (61.6 \u03bcM), indicating that the pyrazol ring is very important for anti-trypanosomal activity. The substitution of pyrazol ring with isoxazole derivative leads to a six fold reduction in activity as compared to the most potent compound. In addition, substitution with nitrophenyl or aminophenyl also results in strong reduction in activity. The phenoxy ring in the compounds is also important for activity as replacing it by an ethylene group results in nine fold reduction in efficacy. Further substitution with a nitro group or an amino group reduces potency up to 4-fold or 18-fold respectively. The stage specific action of these compounds is unknown. Further optimization of this class of compounds is required in order to lower the cytotoxicity profile of the compound.",

However discovering lead compounds with anti-trypanosomal activity remains a crucial step to sustain the progress achieved till date. The use of Computer-assisted drug design (CADD), since their start, has become increasingly helpful in understanding many aspects of chemical-biological interactions in drug and other scientific research. The latest technological advances (QSAR, structure-based design, ligand-based design, cheminformatics & bioinformatics) are providing a much improved basis for the design of ligands and inhibitors with desired specificity. Recently, computer-assisted drug design approaches based on ligand-based and structure- based drug design have been successfully employed to develop new drugs for the treatment of cancer, AIDS and other diseases [89\u201396]. QSAR [97] has been widely used for years to provide quantitative analysis of structure and activity relationships of compounds. Statistical methods are applied in QSAR modeling to establish correlations between chemical structures and their biological activities. Once validated, the findings can be used to predict activities of untested compounds. Though only countable but sustainable attempts has been made to build molecular model in the field of HAT, exemplified by the work of Prashanth A et al [98] who have performed 3D QSAR analysis on a library of heterocyclic diamidines derivatives with antiparasitic activity and Martin MB et at [99] who have performed CoMFA analysis on bisphosphonates against Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense.",

Surprisingly the endeavors of different research group discussed in this review belong to academic institutions. It is felt by the researchers that the treatment for HAT requires a combined approach by government organization, pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions. The most promising fact is that in the last decade several synthetic approaches have been made in the field of development of anti-trypanosomal therapies. Several compounds are being synthesized that yield new compounds for the treatment of HAT, as a result of these synthetic approaches newer leads have been identified, which are under different phase of drug development.",

In an attempt to synthesise newer compounds with reduced cytotoxicity than pentamidine molecules, several benzofuran derivatives have been synthesized. However the replacement of phenoxy fragement of pentamidine with a benzofuran motif has resulted in poor analogues with lower anti-trypanosomal activity but improved cytotoxic profile. However the strong activity against T. b. rhodesiense isolates indicates that steps should be taken to initiate further studies of compound 66 and compound 32 which can be further evolved as new lead compound. The newer analogues of furamidine also show promising anti-trypanosomal activity along with lower cytotoxicity than furamidine. Thus strong activity against T. b. rhodesiense and lower cytotoxicity of compound 3 (Figure 13b) indicates that these compounds should be further evaluated. Thus the DNA minor grove binders are still the most interesting and potential target for the development of newer anti-trypanosomal agents.",
