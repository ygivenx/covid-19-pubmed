            "text": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is due to an increase in the pulmonary alveolar-capillary membrane permeability causing lung edema rich in protein and consequently acute hypoxemic respiratory failure in genetically susceptible patients exposed to determined risk factors [1\u201314]. A recent study showed that the del/del genotype (patients homozygous for the 4 base pair deletion in the promoter of NFKB1) is associated with an age-dependent increase in odds of developing ARDS (OR 5.21, 95% CI 1.35\u201320.0) and patients with the del/del genotype and ARDS also have increased hazard of 60-day mortality (HR 1.54, 95% CI 1.01\u20132.36) and more organ failure (P < 0.001) [15]. All age groups may be affected, although the syndrome has a higher incidence and mortality in older people [16]. The most common precipitating causes of ARDS are pulmonary infections, nonpulmonary sepsis, shock, gastric aspiration, thoracic trauma, fat embolism, near drowning, inhalational injury, cardiopulmonary bypass, drug overdose, acute pancreatitis, and high-risk trauma (especially traumatic brain injury) [17]. Recent epidemiological studies suggested a variety of intrahospital risk factors for ARDS development such as multiple blood products transfusions, mechanical ventilation with high tidal volumes, excessive fluid resuscitation, and hospital-acquired pneumonia as well as high-risk surgeries (especially aortic vascular, cardiac, and acute abdomen); all risk factors are potentially preventable. Chronic alcohol abuse, chronic liver disease, immunosuppression, hypoalbuminemia, and obesity are also all associated with the development of ARDS, whereas diabetes mellitus appears to be protective [17].",

An overwhelming pulmonary inflammatory process is initiated leading to alveolar epithelial and vascular endothelial injury. Alveolar epithelial injury of type I cells contributes to the pulmonary edema and the breakdown of this epithelial barrier exposes the underlying basement membrane, predisposing to bacteremia and sepsis. Injury to type II alveolar cells leads to an impairment of surfactant function with consequent collapse of the lungs. Histopathologically there is diffuse alveolar damage with neutrophil infiltration, alveolar hemorrhage and hyaline membrane formation [18\u201322]. There are localized destruction and occlusion of the vascular bed of the lungs by intravascular thrombosis and an increment of the anatomical dead space resulting in an increase of arterial carbon dioxide associated with a poor outcome. Fibrosis can be evident histologically as early as one week after the onset of ARDS and procollagen III peptide, a precursor of collagen synthesis, can be elevated in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of ARDS patients at the time of tracheal intubation, its increment being associated with a poor ARDS prognosis. Vascular injury and remodeling may lead to pulmonary arterial hypertension which may compromise right ventricular function associated with a poor clinical outcome [13].",

Implementation of automated ARDS electronic screening in USA hospitals such as \u201cASSIST\u201d (electronic alert from laboratory when the arterial blood gas analysis shows hypoxemia and the radiology department when chest X-ray shows bilateral pulmonary infiltrates) to identify intubated patients with ARDS in medical and surgical ICUs showed a sensitivity of 97.6% (95% CI, 96.8\u201398.4%) and specificity of 96.8% (95% CI, 96.8\u201398.4%) when compared to a manual screening algorithm that had a sensitivity of 57.1% (95% CI, 54.5\u201359.8%) and specificity of 99.7% (95% CI, 99.4\u2013100%) in 1270 ICU patients over a 21-week period during enrollment in ARDSNet trials [23]. The results of this study indicated the advantages of having an in-hospital automated screening of ARDS over manual screening. The automated screening can increase the chances of ARDS diagnosis, alert the clinicians, and elicit the rapid response from the hospital team of intensivists to initiate clinical protocols and ARDS therapeutic interventions [24].",

            "text": "Most hospitals and intensive care units worldwide use the standard criteria for the diagnosis of acute lung injury (ALI)/ARDS: presence of acute hypoxemia (PaO2/FIO2 less than 300 mmHg or 39.99 Kpa for ALI or less than 200 mmHg or 26.66 Kpa for ARDS), bilateral infiltrates seen on a frontal chest radiograph that are consistent with pulmonary edema, and no clinical evidence of left atrial hypertension, or (if it is measured) a pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) of less than 18 mmHg according to the 1994\u20131998 American-European Consensus Conference on ARDS (AECC) [25, 26]. This definition aimed to simplify and standardize the diagnosis of ARDS worldwide. However, in clinical practice, in order to detect and diagnose ALI/ARDS cases, physicians must focus on patients' complaints, physical examination alterations, patients at risk of developing the disease, or patients presenting finger pulse oximeter desaturation. Following the ALI/ARDS clinical suspicion, physicians should order an arterial blood gas analysis and a chest radiograph to be able to confirm the ALI/ARDS diagnosis. Recent updates of ARDS definition such as the 2005 Delphi consensus [8] or the Berlin definition [27] were published in order to improve ARDS diagnosis criteria. The Berlin definition reclassified ARDS as mild (PaO2/FIO2 < 300 or 39.99 Kpa), moderate (PaO2/FIO2 < 200 or 26.66 Kpa), and severe (PaO2/FIO2 < 100 mmHg or 13.33 Kpa) and removed the term ALI and the necessity of a Swan Ganz catheter to access PAWP. Acute time frame was specified as the onset within 1 week of a known clinical insult or new or worsening respiratory symptoms chest radiography criteria were clarified and bilateral opacities consistent with pulmonary edema were maintained as the main radiological criteria of ARDS, but it was recognized that these findings could be demonstrated on CT scan instead of chest radiograph. The recent Berlin definition of ARDS is a decisive step forward in refining the diagnosis of the syndrome, but PaO2/FIO2 is influenced by ventilator settings and this fact should be considered; bilateral pulmonary infiltrates can be the result of a wide variety of acute lung diseases that should be better investigated. Left and right ventricular function, pulmonary artery pressures, and volemic status could be better evaluated by bedside echocardiography and extravascular lung water can be measured using PiCCO catheter, in order to evaluate the degree of pulmonary edema. Predictors of mortality should be calculated at ICU admission. With the information, the ICU team can program a more careful treatment plan according to disease severity. The Berlin definition shows better predictive validity for mortality compared to the AECC definition, but the absolute value of the area under the receiver operating curve is still too small (0.577), suggesting that some factors are still missing. Further discussion and research are needed before we reach a comprehensive definition of ARDS.",

            "text": "The results of stepwise lung recruitment maneuvers as well as positive end-expiratory (PEEP) titration to keep the lungs open with minimal collapse can be assessed by computer tomography analysis [30]. This strategy is aimed at opening up the lungs and keeping the lungs open [31] as quickly and early as possible as postulated by Lachmann [32] in order to have a huge improvement in lung function and avoid potential ventilator-induced lung injury. Recently, our group reported the experience with Maximal Recruitment Strategy (MRS) in 51 patients with ARDS. MRS consisted of 2-minute steps of tidal ventilation with pressure-controlled ventilation, fixed driving pressure of 15 cmH2O, respiratory rate of 10 breaths/minute, inspiratory/expiratory ratio of 1 : 1, and stepwise increments in PEEP levels from 10 to 45 cmH2O (recruitment phase). After that, PEEP was decreased to 25 cmH2O and, then, from 25 to 10 cmH2O (PEEP titration phase) in steps of 5 cmH2O, each one lasting 4 minutes. At each of the steps computer tomography image sequences from the carina to the diaphragm were acquired during an expiratory pause of 6\u201310 seconds. Lung collapse was assessed online by visual inspection, for immediate clinical decision, and offline for quantitative measurements. MRS showed a statistically significant decrease in nonaerated areas of the ARDS lungs that was accompanied by a significant increment in oxygenation. The opening plateau pressure observed during the recruitment protocol was 59.6 (\u00b15.9 cmH2O), and the mean PEEP titrated after MRS was 24.6 (\u00b12.9 cmH2O). Mean PaO2/FiO2 ratio increased from 125 (\u00b143) to 300 (\u00b1103; P < 0.0001) after MRS and was sustained above 300 throughout seven days. Nonaerated parenchyma decreased significantly from 53.6% (interquartile range (IQR): 42.5 to 62.4) to 12.7% (IQR: 4.9 to 24.2) (P < 0.0001) after MRS. The potentially recruitable lung was estimated at 45% (IQR: 25 to 53), (Figure 1). ICU mortality was 28% and hospital mortality was 32%. The independent risk factors associated with mortality were older age and higher driving pressures (or higher delta pressure control). There were no significant clinical complications with MRS or barotrauma [33]. A better evolution of these ARDS patients with less necessity of oxygen supplementation in the recovery phase of the disease and a better quality of life must be tested in prospective, controlled clinical trials. A recent meta-analysis showing beneficial effects on mortality using higher PEEP levels compared with lower PEEP in ARDS patients corroborates the results of our clinical case series of ARDS patients submitted to MRS [33].",

It is crucial to make the diagnosis of ARDS in the acute phase (preferably less than 72 hours) in order to make it possible to open up the lungs with recruitment maneuvers and keep the lungs open with sufficient PEEP levels to enable a more homogenous ventilation, minimizing the possible ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) triggers and allowing the recovery of the lungs [34\u201336]. A recent study analyzing 85 patients with ARDS graded into six findings according to the extent of fibroproliferation at the CT scan showed that higher CT scores were associated with statistically significant decreases in organ-failure free days as well as ventilator free days and were an independent risk factor for mortality (OR = 1.2, 95% CI 1.06\u20131.36, P < 0.005) [37].",

However, most of these studies analyzed mixed causes of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and reported the highest intubation rates for patients with ARDS (51 to 70%) and that the presence of ARDS was one factor independently associated with NIV failure and higher mortalities rates (50 to 70%). Recently, Zhan and colleagues [47] analyzed 40 patients with ARDS randomly allocated to receive either noninvasive ventilation or high-concentration oxygen therapy through a venturi mask. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation decreased the respiratory rate and improved PaO2/FIO2 with time. The proportion of patients requiring intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation was significantly lower in the noninvasive ventilation group (one of 21 versus 7 of 19; P = 0.02). Therefore, noninvasive ventilation can be used as a first ventilatory support technique in selected patients with mild/moderate ARDS and a hemodynamic stable condition to avoid endotracheal intubation. A larger randomized trial, however, is required, with the need for intubation and mortality as the outcome of interest. A close-monitored initial trial of noninvasive ventilation should be considered in most mild/moderate ARDS patients, mainly the immunosuppressed ones with pulmonary infection in order to avoid intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation. However, early detection of NIV failure must be recognized, and a prompt intubation and mechanical ventilation must be provided in order to avoid complications.",

A recent meta-analysis, however, scrutinized the specific role of various ventilatory strategies used in randomized trials on lung protection (like plateau-pressure limitation and higher PEEP use) and showed that tidal volume per se is not exactly the most important parameter to prioritize. The conclusion was that driving pressure (i.e., the difference between plateau pressure and PEEP during controlled mechanical ventilation) was the most important parameter to optimize at the bedside. Patients with high driving pressures (>16 cmH2O) may be at great danger even when using tidal volumes below 6 mL/kg, or even when presenting plateau-pressures below 30 cmH2O [50].",

It is hard to point out which component of such combined strategy was responsible for the benefits. Villar and colleagues [52] found congruent results in a similar protocol. Moreover, Ranieri and colleagues [53] demonstrated decreased lung inflammation with this protective ventilatory strategy. Although these results are encouraging, the physiologic background supporting the use of P-V curves to titrate PEEP lacks consistency nowadays. In many different situations, investigators have reported a large dissociation between closing pressures of the lung and the calculated value for the inflection point obtained from the inspiratory P-V curve. In general, patients with high values of inflection point tend to have a more severe disease, and this may explain the relative success of this strategy. Nevertheless, we will probably use better tools to titrate PEEP in the next few years. A more consistent use of the P-V curve has been demonstrated for the analysis of lung recruitability [54, 55].",

The reason for the improvement in oxygenation obtained with PSV in ARDS has been challenged in the recent years [59, 60]. The apparent improvement in recruitment seems to have been overstated and there is evidence that it is related to an increased perfusion of better ventilated lung areas, but not to decreased lung collapse. Growing concerns related to excessive tidal recruitment or excessive dyssynchrony during this mode of ventilation will have to be better addressed in the next years [61]. The advantages of using assist modes are to keep the respiratory muscles' activity, but sometimes it is difficult to synchronize the patients to the ventilators. Recently, neurally adjust ventilation (NAVA) was used in ARDS experimental models [62] and ARDS patients [63] demonstrating that the ventilation cycle and the magnitude of assist breath in NAVA matched the patients' breath pattern better than in PSV, NAVA improving patient-ventilator synchrony compared to PSV.",

However, to date there are few studies involving a small number of patients comparing HFOV to conventional ventilation. A recent meta-analysis suggested a trend towards mortality benefit and more ventilator free days. However, the results of this analysis should be interpreted cautiously as the main study contributing to its results used high tidal volume in the control group rather than protective lung ventilation strategy [64].",

A recent meta-analyses suggest survival benefits in ARDS patients [65] or, more specifically, in a subgroup of patients with severe ARDS (PaO2/FIO2 < 100 mmHg) [66]. In our experience, the prone position can be an acceptable alternative to improve oxygenation in severe ARDS patients with arterial pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular dysfunction, which associated with the use of inhaled nitric oxide, can minimize intrathoracic pressures to facilitate right ventricular performance.

            "text": "Clinical studies suggested that elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure in ARDS patients was associated with an adverse prognosis [67]. These data have been further supported by a more recent analysis of hemodynamic data from the ARDSNet Fluids and Catheter Therapy Trial (FACTT) [68]. The investigators assessed the transpulmonary gradient (TPG) (mean PA pressure-pulmonary capillary occlusion pressure (PCOP)) and the pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRi) in a group of patients randomized to receive a pulmonary artery catheter to guide their ARDS management. Of note, all patients received a consistent protective ventilator strategy with target tidal volume ~6 mL/kg ideal body weight and plateau pressures maintained <30 cmH2O. The highest recorded daily value of TPG and PVRi was used for the analysis. In the population of 475 patients randomized to receive a pulmonary artery catheter for ARDS management, none of the baseline measures of cardiopulmonary dysfunction, including central venous pressure, PA systolic, or diastolic pressure, pulmonary capillary occlusion pressure (PAOP), or cardiac index distinguished survivors from nonsurvivors. In the pulmonary artery catheter population, 73% demonstrated an elevated transpulmonary gradient (TPG > 12). Patients with a TPG > 12 mmHg had a significantly greater mortality rate than patients with a TPG < 12 mmHg (30% versus 19%; P = 0.02). Patients with a persistently elevated TPG through day 7 of therapy had a significantly greater mortality than patients with an elevated TPG at day 0-1 which subsequently normalized. In multivariate analysis, pulmonary vascular dysfunction as represented by an elevated TPG and PVRi remained an independent predictor of an adverse outcome in the ARDS population. These data further support an important predictive role for pulmonary vascular disease in ARDS outcome [69]. In the largest published echocardiographic series of ARDS, 22% of patients receiving a consistent lung protective ventilation strategy (mean PEEP of 10 cmH2O and mean plateau pressure (Pplat) of 23 cmH2O) had evidence for acute cor pulmonale. In this population, 19% demonstrated evidence of a moderate-to-large patent foramen ovale [70]. The incidence of right to left shunting increased to 34% in patients with echocardiographic evidence of acute cor pulmonale.",

Early clinical trials of ECMO employed primarily an arterial-venous strategy with larger bore catheters for patients with intractable hypoxemia [71]. More modern investigations have used a safer venous-venous access approach [72, 73]. A recent UK prospective, randomized, clinical trial (CESAR) showed a survival advantage in the ECMO group (63% for ECMO versus 47% for controls). Nevertheless, the study was criticized as there was no standardized protocol management for the control group and some patients in the ECMO arm did not receive the proposed treatment [74]. The authors of CESAR trial also recommended transferring adult patients with severe but potentially reversible respiratory failure and a pH less than 7.20 on optimal conventional management, to a center with an ECMO-based management protocol to significantly improve survival without severe disability. The authors demonstrated that this strategy is also likely to be cost effective in settings with similar services to those in the United Kingdom [74]. Another recent approach for application of extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal new devices (ECMO-R) in ARDS patients is the demonstration that in severe ARDS even the low tidal volume ventilation with 6 mL/Kg of predicted body weight can cause tidal hyperdistension in the nondependent regions of the lungs accompanied by plateau airway pressures greater than 28 cmH2O and elevated plasma markers of inflammation. In this group application of ECMO-R could allow the authors to decrease the tidal volume to less than 6 mL/kg with a consequent plateau pressure less than 25 cmH2O that was associated with a lower radiographic index of lung injury and lower levels of lung-derived inflammatory cytokines. However, prognostic implication of this new ECMO-R devices application in clinical practice is still under investigation [75].",

APRV after 24 h appears to enhance improvement in oxygenation in response to prone positioning. Rival and colleagues [79] examined the effects of the prone position associated with a recruitment maneuver consisting of 45 cmH2O extended sigh in pressure control, in 16 ARDS patients. The combination of both ventilatory techniques led to the highest increase in PaO2/FIO2 ratio without significant clinical side effects. Lubnow and colleagues [80] examined the effects of 6 days of the combination of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) and extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal with the interventional lung assist (iLA) in 21 severe ARDS patients who failed conventional ventilation. They observed an increase in PaO2/FIO2 ratio and pH and a decrease in PaCO2. Weaning from HFOV/iLA was successful in 10 patients.

Pulmonary infection has been associated with a higher risk of ARDS progression in comparison to nonpulmonary infection in at risk populations [81]. A wide variety of organisms can invade the respiratory tract and trigger host innate and acquired immune system initiating the inflammatory cascade of ARDS, sepsis, and multiple organ failure [11]. It is particularly pertinent to investigate the etiology of pulmonary infection on the first day assessing a nasal swab for a respiratory virus detection (Influenza, adenovirus) lower respiratory tract secretion or a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) for bacteria (especially multiresistant species), other viruses as herpes and cytomegalovirus, coronavirus, or metapneumonic virus [82]. Opportunistic agents such as Pneumocystis jiroveci must be investigated in immunosuppressed patients. Urinary screening for Legionella species is decisive, because if positive, specific therapy must be introduced [11]. The assessment of BALF on the first as well as on the third day of mechanical ventilation is of the utmost importance not only in terms of assessment of etiology of pulmonary infection but also of the assessment of proinflammatory mediators of ARDS (IL-1, IL6, IL8, IL 10, soluble tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptors (sTNFR), and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1) and mediators of ventilator-induced lung injury (that can also be obtained in the plasma) such as sTNFR, IL6, IL8, and IL-10, indicators of epithelial cell injury (soluble advanced glycation end-product receptors-sRAGE), and surfactant protein-D, components of the coagulation system (protein-C and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1) [11, 83]. Elevated levels of procollagen peptide III in lavage fluid from patients on day 3 of ARDS were independent risk factors for mortality [84].",

In ARDS patients it is of considerable significance to evaluate the source of infection as well all organs and systems affected by the sepsis syndrome in order to map the organism (number of nonpulmonary organ failures), to calculate the prognostic indices (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) and Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS)) and to plan the multiorgan system approach to treat the disease. The higher the number of multiple organ failure associated with ARDS, the higher the hospital mortality. Trauma patients with ARDS are associated with lower mortality and oliguricrenal failure, while septic shock patients are associated with the highest hospital mortality rates, suggesting that during the first day of hospitalization these ARDS patients should be stratified and treated according to the severity of the syndrome and associated comorbidities [91]. In our case series of 51 patients with early severe ARDS the mean APACHE II score was 20.2 \u00b1 6.2 (predicted mortality of 40%), median SOFA score (day 1) was 10 (7 to 12), median nonpulmonary organ failure was 2 (1 to 2), sepsis was present in 71% of our patients, and septic shock in 63%, vasopressors were used in 82.3% of our patients, and continuous renal replacement therapy was used in 56.8% of our patients. APACHE II and day 1 SOFA score were not associated with hospital mortality, but day 3 SOFA score was [33] (Figure 2) showing that a revaluation of the ARDS patients especially the ones with multiple organ failure and maintenance of SOFA score higher than 8 at day 3 has to be considered in order to evaluate hidden sources of infection or to change the antibiotics according to day 1 collected cultures.",
