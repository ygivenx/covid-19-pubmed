Firstly, factors like indoor crowding in winter could lead to an increase of TB transmission (extrinsic infection). Secondly, vitamin D deficiency and high epidemic of other respiratory diseases could cause impaired immunity which would result in TB reactivation (intrinsic reactivation). However, questions arise. Which factor is the dominant reason for seasonality of TB? Are these the only influencing factors in term of extrinsic infection or intrinsic reactivation of TB? To examine those issues, we studied the seasonality of TB in Wuhan, China. Wuhan city with 10 million residents is the fourth largest city in China, and also one of the most important transportation junctions for the whole country.",

It is a very stable and efficient model developed by the bank of Spain. In the TRAMO-SEATS program, the original time series is decomposed into three basic components: trend component, seasonal factor and irregular noise component. The trend component is the long-term and medium-to-long term variation tendency of the time series, including up or down trend and important break points; it reflects the basic and primary trend of a disease in the long-term or medium-to-long term. The seasonal factor is considered as a fluctuation repeatedly occurred in the same month or quarter each year; it shows the seasonal characteristic of the disease, and caused by complex factors. The irregular noise component is the residual component that remains after trend component and seasonal factor are removed from the time series; it represents the noise of the time series.",

If the population had the identifiable seasonality judged by TRAMO-SEATS program, we calculated the mean spring peak month, mean summer peak month, mean trough month, annual spring seasonal amplitude and annual summer seasonal amplitude with 95% confidence interval (CI), and annual spring-summer amplitude difference with median, upper and lower quartile for the years from 2004 to 2013. Annual spring and summer seasonal amplitude were calculated from isolated seasonal factor and defined as the fraction with the numerator being the spring-peak-to-trough or summer-peak-to-trough difference between the months with the highest spring or summer and the lowest case counts and with the denominator being mean case counts for that year. Annual spring-summer amplitude difference was defined as a fraction with the numerator being the spring-peak-to-summer-peak difference between the months with the highest spring and the highest summer case counts and with the denominator being mean case counts for that year.",

During the Spring Festival, congregation for celebrating the coming new year always leads to heath care seeking delay. Thus, the consultation rate during this period is relatively low. This delay in health care seeking contributes to diagnosis delay which may increase the risk of disease transmission (due to the longer communicable period of tuberculosis) in winter.",

The median diagnosis delay of pulmonary TB cases in Wuhan was 35 days in our previous study [29]. After the increase of TB transmission in winter, the peak of TB cases would appear 16.8 months (the sum of incubation and diagnosis delay) later. In other words, the summer peak (July-September) in this study was most likely resulted from the winter transmission. In our study, the 0\u201314 years old age group had the highest summer amplitude which paralleled with the spring amplitude. The summer amplitude of 0\u201314 years old age group was significant higher than older age groups.

The reactivation of tuberculosis is associated with HIV infection, immunosuppressive therapy or complex factors such as poor nutrition and socioeconomic status which can lead to decreased immunity. First, vitamin D deficiency has been hypothesized to be contributed to the reactivation of TB [30]. Prior to the introduction of chemotherapy, the measures (sunlight exposure and fish liver oils supplement) to enhance the level of serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) were included as an integral part of traditional anti-TB therapy. Studies [31], [32] showed that vitamin D deficiency could impair cell mediated immunity and reduce function of macrophages, thus lead to the reactivation of tuberculosis. Synthesis of vitamin D is dependent on the sunlight. Latitude is considered as an important influencing factor of sunlight exposure. The consensus reached in nutrition is that, the serum 25 (OH) D concentration is quite low or absent above latitude of 33\u00b0 N in winter [33]. Although there has been no data of the seasonal variation of serum 25 (OH) D concentrations of residents in Wuhan which is located at 30\u00b0 N, we suppose that the serum 25 (OH) D concentrations are relatively low in winter of Wuhan residents. The result of one study showed that the serum level of 25-hydroxy vitamin D revealed about one month lag after the change of ultraviolet radiation [34], another study showed that the trough of 25-hydroxy vitamin D was in mid-winter [35]. Thus, the trough month of the serum level of 25-hydroxy vitamin D in Wuhan residents is assumed to be in February, one month behind the trough of ultraviolet radiation (January). This would result in the reactivation peak in late winter, considering the diagnosis delay (35 days, about 1.2 month), then would lead to the spring peak (March) of pulmonary TB.",

Several studies showed that after a time of exposure to diesel exhaust inhalation, the expression levels of interleukin (TNF)-\u03b1, IL-12, interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 in marine decreased significantly [36], [37]. IFN-\u03b3 attacks and kills the Mycobacterium tuberculosis by macrophage activation. TNF-\u03b1 is important in the procedure of granuloma formation and the infection localized. Furthermore, the inhibition of TNF-\u03b1 by drugs would lead to TB reactivation [38]. A recent study suggested a potential association between the exposure to particulate matter (PM) and pulmonary TB [39]. Additionally, the frequent haze weather may lead to reduced ultraviolet radiation intensity, thus lower the level of serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D in body. The haze weather is most frequently in winter. Consequently, all of the above factors would cause the winter or early spring peak of TB reactivation. Considering the diagnosis delay of TB, TB reactivation would manifest as TB peak in spring. Thus, we speculated that spring peak (from March to May) in our study was more likely caused by the reactivation of the latent TB than the enhanced winter transmission.",

Ane-Anyangwe's study [13] in the South Western Cameroon showed that the peak month was in winter (rainy season). The author attributed it to the two factors: vitamin D deficiency due to the lack of sunlight exposure, higher risks of indoor infection because of the humid and cold weather. The rainy season in Wuhan is very short, last about 20\u201330 days every year, usually from mid June to early July in summer. The precipitation does not have significant seasonality beyond the rainy season. The ultraviolet radiation is enough for the synthesis of serum 25(OH) D even during the rainfall season period. In rainy season, the temperature is high and the continuous heavy rain is infrequent(the annual mean frequency of continuous heavy rain was 0.41 times between 1959\u20131996, 95% lasted less than 5 days) [40], thus it is not likely to enhance the indoor infection.",

The other reason might be the variation of the influencing factors driving the seasonality of TB, such as the increasing of ground public transport.

As a result, those clinical factors that had been mentioned above were not included in the analysis. Second, all of the explanation of the seasonality was just the speculation, and the conclusions were not definite. Since the study is observational, the temporal association between cause and effect could not be established. There was a need of further study to explore the exact mechanism of the seasonal variation of pulmonary TB in Wuhan. The further research should be focused on the relationship between PM2.5 and serum 25 (OH) D concentration, PM2.5 and pulmonary TB, and so on. Thus the results would provide basis to prevent and control the TB epidemic.",
