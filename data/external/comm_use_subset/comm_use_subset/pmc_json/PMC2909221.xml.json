Methods have been developed to identify conserved nucleic acid regions that are common to larger groupings (lineages, serogroups, genera, or families), thereby minimizing the number of probes required and increasing the chance of detecting novel viruses. The more recent strategies for achieving this include (i) using pairwise sequence comparisons to identify conserved sequences for probes [1-3] as well as (ii) identifying specific regions from a multiple sequence alignment [4-6]. Additionally, our group developed a method for designing probes within conserved protein regions [7]. Finally, oligonucleotide tiling arrays used in viral resequencing have been applied to both virus detection [8-11] and viral transcript profiling [12].",

While low-density microarrays can be analyzed by visual inspection [14], high-density arrays require computational solutions. Correlation of fluorescence to a predicted hybridization signal has been used to infer the presence of a virus [15], while a t-test based method has also been validated with the same datasets [16]. Other methods include semi-supervised classification using the K-nearest neighbor technique [17], an empirical determination of signal cutoffs for tiling arrays [18], and a likelihood metric informed by taxonomic hierarchies [19]. Resequencing arrays are able to leverage redundancy and deep-coverage, thereby helping the scientist to infer what the viral nucleotide sequence is [10], but whether highly divergent strains of viruses can be correctly annotated by this method is unclear.",

Additionally, only a small proportion of probes are likely to hybridize if virus is present in a sample, leading to distributions with high variance. Nonparametric tests transform data into rank order or categories; this has the effect of rescaling variance and simplifying the distribution to one more easily modeled. If data variance is high or the distribution is heavily skewed, nonparametric tests are more conservative than equivalent parametric tests. What is more, nonparametric tests are valid with small sample sizes (less than 20); this is an advantage in cases where the presence of a virus is being investigated by a small number of probes. Nonparametric methods such as the Mann Whitney U test have been applied in detecting differential gene expression of by microarrays [20].",

Along with negative controls, nine viral isolates from different families were hybridized; the isolates had genome sizes ranging from 7 to 156 kilobases.

In contrast, requiring a p value of \u2264 5% for there to be \"significance\" indicates that up to 5% of all truly absent viruses may be identified as present.

While an analysis by Giles and Kipling of Affymetrix arrays based on 25 nt probes indicated that the fluorescence distributions of their log-transformed probe signals were indeed close to normal (Gaussian) [37], our experience with 60 nt probe arrays showed strong deviations from a normal distribution. Increases in RNA input have complex effects on signal distribution: the degree of skew is increased and the upper tail is lengthened (see Figure 1). We tested the normality of these distributions and found strong deviations for all three experiments (using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, where p < 0.05). Sample distributions of fluorescent signals deriving from virus-infected tissue-culture cell hybridizations are available in Additional file 5, Figure S2. The observed signal distributions included Gaussian, highly kurtotic and bimodal; host RNA concentration can only partially explain these differences. Other explanations include: a large proportion homologous probes on the array increasing the upper tail, differences in amplification or labeling efficiency from sample to sample, and differences in hybridization affinity due to guanine/cytosine proportion in viral transcripts. While more complex methods of transformation have been described elsewhere, these have focused on improving the sensitivity of transcript profiling measurements and, we surmised, were unlikely to improve sensitivities in our application. Parametric analysis of microarray data is particularly sensitive to transformations; violations of normality will lead to a loss of power, and may result in invalid p values [38].",

A study using Agilent 60 nt in-situ synthesized arrays found that replicate probes were highly concordant [40], and useful both in improving normalization and in identifying outlier signals [41]. Reverse complements have been used on spotted oligonucleotide arrays for pathogens [1], although no quantitative assessments of their advantages have been reported up to this point. In such studies as are mentioned above, in situ synthesized oligonucleotides are immobilized at the 3' end. Probe-target helix stability near the surface is likely to be reduced due to steric hindrance. Thus, probes that are mismatched to their targets will be strongly affected by the specific mismatch position (e.g., mismatches near the 5' end will reduce the hybridization signal more than those near the 3' end [42]).",

Thus, we measured the success of each statistical method by whether it correctly predicted the presence of a hybridized viral isolate or any other virus within the same genus. The precise number of times that the most statistically significant prediction proved to be correct was also tabulated (see Table 4 for an enumeration of both measures). Statistical analysis was carried out with coding sense probes, antisense probes, or both probe types pooled together, as independent measures of the quantity of viral nucleic acid.

We report on our performance in this instance by relying on a simple metric: the rank of the first correct prediction (see Table 5). The first prediction of the Mann-Whitney U test was correct in 47% of the cases; a correct prediction was present among the first ten predictions in 91% of the cases. The average correct prediction rank for the Mann-Whitney U test was 3.7.

The first prediction of the binomial test was correct in 75% of the cases; a correct prediction was present among the first ten predictions in 98% of the cases. The average correct prediction rank for the binomial test was 1.6. As in the Mann-Whitney U results, the majority of incorrect predictions were for HHV7. Watson et al. reported a similar false-positive result using a t-test method [16]. HHV7 has a seroprevelance of 85% in humans and can be readily detected in blood, saliva and cervical tissue [45].

In a viral microarray experiment, absence of signal from all probes is a plausible result. This may reflect any of the following: (1) that no agent is present; (2) that an agent is present but there are no probes for it because it is either truly new or sufficiently different to confound hybridization; (3) that a known agent is present and that probes are appropriate but that levels are insufficient to enable detection.",

We tested the effect of various probe control strategies on the FPR. A hybridization requirement for both sense and antisense probes was more helpful in reducing the FPR than the use of hybridization to replicate probes.

Of the three methods that we assessed, the binomial test was the most successful, achieving a 91% PPV. A further development of our study might include empirically determining a more optimal threshold by using spike-in controls or by adding more categories to reflect different levels of confidence (e.g., positive, marginal and negative).
