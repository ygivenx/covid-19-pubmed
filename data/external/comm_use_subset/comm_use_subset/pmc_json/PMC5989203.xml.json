            "text": "Detection and characterisation of viruses by metagenomics (VM) is a relatively new technique that takes advantage of the sensitivity of next-generation sequencing (NGS) while being broadly non-specific for any particular virus present in a given sample. Virus communities (viromes) are structurally and functionally diverse and distinct to habitats in hosts and environments, and prior to VM there was limited understanding of the virome present in human and non-human hosts. Now with the growing use of VM, information on eukaryotic viruses, prokaryotic viruses and even viruses that infect other viruses are increasing1\u20135. The objectives of the physical preparation of samples for metagenomic sequencing of viruses are (i) to eliminate as many nucleic acids from the host and other elements like bacteria, fungi, parasites and, (ii) to ensure that as much of the virus nucleic acids are retained during the entire process and (iii) to generate good quality NGS reads.",

Among such proposed protocols, one designated NetoVIR by Concei\u00e7\u00e3o-Neto, N et al.6 was optimised on mock communities and later tested on actual and complex biological samples by the same research group11\u201313. The latter testing was performed without spiking the biological samples with known viruses, which would have served as a useful positive control to validate the protocol. As the overall aim of our project was to detect and characterise viruses in faecal samples from wild birds in Australia, we initially evaluated and compared the existing protocol (NetoVIR), including some additional modifications, and determined the optimum procedure for robust virus detection and characterisation in spiked and non-spiked bird faecal samples. Furthermore, we adopted the protocol downstream of the nucleic acid purification for library preparation and sequencing on the Ion Torrent platform. Using the optimised method, we identified viruses present in selected faecal samples from a Muscovy duck (designated as MUD) and a group of Pacific black ducks (designated as MAD) and from selected human faecal samples to show the broad applicability of the method. Finally, we demonstrate that additional information can be extracted from the sequencing reads, e.g. derived from mitochondrial DNA and ribosomal RNA present in the samples, allowing identification of host species, parasites present, food eaten and faecal bacterial populations present.",

We assembled several areas of good coverage including 459 nucleotides of the polymerase gene (coverage 9\u2013192), 1839 nucleotides covering the complete hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) gene (coverage 5\u2013103) and 651 nucleotides of the fusion (F) gene (coverage 2\u20138). For the polymerase gene, the similarity was 447/459 (97.3%) and 444/459 (96.7%) to AB759118 (APMV-6 red-necked stint-Japan-2008)15 and GQ406232 (APMV-6 duck-Italy-07)16, but only around 75% similar to the other known lineage of APMV-6, the so-called Hong Kong 1977 lineage17 [Fig. 2 and Table 4]. For the HN gene, the similarity was 1787/1839 (97.1%) and 1785/1839 (97.0%) to AB759118 (APMV-6 red-necked stint-Japan-2008) and GQ406232 (APMV-6 duck-Italy-07), but only around 71% similar to the other known lineage of APMV-6 [Fig. 3 and Table 5]. For the fusion gene, the similarity was 631/651 (96.9%) and 630/651 (96.7%) to AB759118 (APMV-6 red-necked stint-Japan-2008) and GQ406232 (APMV-6 duck-Italy-07), but only around 73% similar to the other known lineage of APMV-6 [Fig. 4 and Table 6]. Thus, the APMV-6 present in our sample from the Australian juvenile Pacific black ducks (MAD) was closely related to the red-necked stint-Japan-2008 and duck-Italy-07 lineage of APMV-6 and only distantly related to the other major lineage of APMV-6. Furthermore, our Australian APMV-6 also has an additional basic amino acid around the fusion protein cleavage site, REPR-L rather than PEPR-L, characteristic for the Japan/Italy 2007/2008 lineage of APMV-617. APMV6 sequences covering other regions of the APMV6 genome similarly found that the virus belonged to the Japan-Italy lineage [Figures S1.1\u2013S1.23 and Table S1.1\u2013S1.23 of the Supplementary Material 2].",

The method which maintained a maximum number of viruses and obtained high-quality and a higher number of NGS reads were found to be variation D; equivalent to the NetoVIR method with an added ultracentrifugation step to further concentrate and enrich for particles resistant to nucleases. However, variation C, or NetoVIR6 itself, also produced good quality NGS reads for the viruses, although in lower amounts compared to variation D. Careful homogenization was significant for the homogeneous distribution of virus particles in the samples. Initial centrifugation and filtration using the 0.8 \u00b5m PES filter as described in NetoVIR removed larger particles while virus particles and some small particles such as ribosomes and some mitochondria were not filtered out and were subsequently spun down and concentrated using ultracentrifugation and thus enriching the sample. Harsh nuclease treatment ensured the reduction of free nucleic acids and other less protected nucleic acids. Finally, the nucleic acid extraction method did allow the extraction of genomes of both DNA and RNA viruses from the sample.",

The fusion protein of the paramyxoviruses directs the membrane fusion42 and paramyxoviruses where the fusion protein cleavage site does not possess the furin recognition site (RXK/RR-F) are usually limited to the respiratory tract, and hence the sequence at this site contributes to the virulence of these viruses42,43. The sequences of the fusion protein in our APMV6 from the MAD faecal sample has an additional basic amino acid around the fusion protein cleavage site (REPR-L) characteristic for the Japan/Italy 2007/2008 lineage as compared to the Hong Kong lineage of APMV-617 and hence any further changes at this site could potentially make the virus highly virulent.",

Avian coronaviruses frequently cause severe infections in poultry in many countries45.

The gammacoronavirus detected in the MAD faecal sample was more closely related to the duck gammacoronavirus from China in 201418 than to the other gammacoronavirus sequences available. While we observed more than 96% identity in the Orf1ab polyprotein gene, the Spike gene identity was only 89\u201392% to the duck gammacoronavirus. For the deltacoronavirus detected in the MAD sample, the closest relative was the wigeon deltacoronavirus from Hong Kong collected in 200819. The Spike protein of the coronaviruses mediates the entry of the virus particles into cells, and mutations in or recombination of this region are important for host species specificity and potential cross-species transmissibility of the virus42,43. These are the first wild bird coronaviruses from Australia to have their spike genes sequenced and further analysis to understand the relationship between wild bird coronaviruses is needed. A detailed study of the prevalence of coronaviruses among Australian wild birds (including the MAD sample) using PCR amplification of a small fragment of the Orf1ab gene with a detailed description and phylogenetic analysis of a small fragment of around 300 nucleotides is described elsewhere46. However, while that study did detect both gamma and deltacoronaviruses, the PCRs included were not able to detect coinfections (i.e. birds having both a gamma and a deltacoronavirus) while it is worth mentioning that such coinfection can be readily detected using our metagenomics method as evident from the NGS data generated in the present study.",

The DuA2 (KR135164) was characterised in China in the year 2014 and found to be closely related to the GoA4 (JF510462) isolated from Hungary20. Avian adenoviruses have great variability in their pathogenesis and virulence. The goose adenovirus 4 has been associated with hepatitis and hydropericardium20. The virus related to adeno-associated (parvo) virus from the Pacific black ducks was somewhat related to a duck adeno-associated virus from China in 2015. It is currently unclear whether the adeno-associated (parvo) virus detected in the MAD sample can replicate without helper virus or not, however, we consider it likely that the adenovirus (related to the DuA2 and GoA4 mentioned above) detected in the same sample, may act as a helper virus for enhanced replication as adeno-associated parvoviruses often need a helper virus for its replication47. As both viruses are present simultaneously and possibly enhance replication of the parvovirus present, this co-infection may be associated with disease in the host although this is currently speculative and will require further studies before any conclusion can be reached as to its significance in regards to the health of infected birds.",

Even though rotavirus infections in avian species are associated with diarrhoea, cross-species transmission of the avian rotaviruses is usually very rare49. To the best of our knowledge, our sequences are the first assembled reads of a Rotavirus G from Australia and from a duck sample, which could explain why we had to drop the mapping quality threshold to 10 to get a coverage of 3 and above for the generation of consensus sequences. Nevertheless, even then, we were only able to generate consensus sequences for only segments 1, 3/4 and 8. We believe the sequences for one segment that matched to segment 4 of the NCBI reference (JQ920005) isolated from Germany22 is in reality segment 3 as it encodes for the VP3 protein of the rotavirus, which universally is accepted to be part of segment 3. Nevertheless, it appears that the rotavirus detected in the MAD sample is a new rotavirus and may have included reassortment in its evolutionary history as we were only able to map 3 of the gene segments and they, in turn, mapped most closely to different reference sequences.",

They can severely affect the neuro-system and has high mortality rates49. However, the pathogenicity of avian calicivirus is still unclear although it has been isolated from chickens and turkeys having various diseases like the runting and stunting syndrome and enteric diseases52,53. The actual pathogenicity, if any, of the related viruses here detected at very low levels in the MAD sample is currently unknown.",

For example, for the mosquito viruses detected in our MUD faecal sample, our detection of partial 28 S RNA of Culex mosquito in the sample supports this speculation. Ngewotan virus (Nam Dinh like virus), Hubei chryso-like virus 1, Culex Negev-like virus 3 (Biggie/Goutanap virus-like) and a virus related to Hubei reo-like virus 7 detected and characterised in the MUD sample are recently identified in mosquitoes1,24. All the mosquito viruses, except for the virus related to Hubei reo-like virus 7 (which was first characterised in China1) are nearly 100% identical to the viruses detected in Western Australia24, approximately 3000 km from Geelong, Victoria where the MUD faecal sample was collected. These viruses being RNA viruses, which can have high mutation rates due to the low polymerase fidelity54, a nearly 100% identity is rather interesting. The mode of travel of these viruses could be from birds that have eaten the infected mosquitoes and travel long distances and then could be depositing these viruses in their faeces. We also cannot rule out that the infected mosquitoes may be taken from one region to another by human means such as aircrafts, trains, vehicles or by the wind. Independent of mode, the close identity of these mosquito viruses from distant locations indicate that such viruses may be easily dispersed over great distances.",

Presence of plant viruses such as a virus related to black-grass cryptic like virus 2 and a virus related to Hordeum vulgare endornavirus is also likely to be from the food eaten. Only a single long good quality read with high similarity to the Israeli acute paralysis virus was detected. This virus may cause devastating infection in bees (colony collapse) when associated with varroa mite infestations. This virus has previously been detected in Australian bees, however, as Australia is free of varroa mites, is not thought to cause any disease in bees here56,57. Nevertheless, the finding in the MUD sample likely suggests that it could be from a bee eaten by the Muscovy duck.",

Birds that migrate through the East Asian-Australasian flyway may transmit viruses to and from Australia. The similarity of some of our sequences of the avian and non-avian host associated viruses to the viruses that were characterised in e.g. Japan and China supports this theory. For example, the APMV6 phylogenies suggest that despite Australian ducks not migrating, they still are part of the global circulation of duck viruses, and that migrating shorebirds may likely be the vector for such viruses entering and exiting from Australia. It is also noteworthy to mention that during the BLASTN search, except for the Hubei chryso-like virus 1, Ngewotan virus (Nam Dinh like virus) and Culex Negev-like virus 3 very recently described in Western Australia, none of the top matched sequences were to similar strains or related viruses from Australia.
