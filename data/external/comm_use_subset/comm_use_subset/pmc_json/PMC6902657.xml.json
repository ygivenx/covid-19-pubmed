Effective risk communication during a public health emergency can be difficult, especially in the early stages when many of the facts may be uncertain. Health authorities can be reluctant to proactively communicate as they are apprehensive of saying the wrong thing, creating panic or looking like they do not have all the answers. However, delaying communication can result in the public listening to rumours or relying on less accurate sources of information, (3) or can lead to the very panic authorities were trying to prevent.

Many people confused it with seasonal influenza and therefore thought the risk to their health was low, while others expressed a high level of concern about the virus. (7) Some people also had immense distrust in the vaccine, because of perceived conflicts of interest between pharmaceutical companies and health authorities. (7) Research published following the H1N1 pandemic indicated that countries should be prepared to address rumours and misconceptions about vaccine safety, to carefully communicate the severity of disease and to enlist the support of trusted members of the community. (7) The role of social media also needed to be considered. (8) After the 2009 pandemic, it was recognized that risk communication approaches could be tested and honed during seasonal influenza outbreaks. (9)",
