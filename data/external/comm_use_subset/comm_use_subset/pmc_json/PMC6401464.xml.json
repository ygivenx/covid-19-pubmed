            "text": "Human norovirus is recognized as the most important cause of outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis (1). Currently, there are no available vaccines or antivirals for noroviruses, despite their discovery decades ago (2). Norovirus is a nonenveloped single-stranded RNA virus within the Caliciviridae family. The genome contains three open reading frames (ORFs), where ORF1 encodes nonstructural proteins, ORF2 encodes the major capsid protein (VP1), and ORF3 encodes the minor capsid protein (VP2). Based on the capsid gene sequences, noroviruses can be divided into at least seven genogroups (GI to GVII), with GI, GII, and GIV causing infections in humans. Each human genogroup is further subdivided into numerous genotypes (3).",

            "text": "The norovirus virion comprises 90 VP1 dimers that form an icosahedral particle (T=3) 35 to 45 nm in diameter (2, 4). The capsid protein can be expressed in insect cells and self-assembles into virus-like particles (VLPs) assumed to be morphologically similar to native virions. The X-ray crystal structure of prototype genogroup I genotype 1 (GI.1) norovirus VLPs showed that the capsid is divided into two domains, the shell (S) and protruding (P) domains, which are connected via a flexible hinge (4). The S domain forms the scaffold surrounding the RNA, while the surface-exposed P domains, which are further subdivided in P1 and P2 subdomains, contain the main determinants of antigenicity and host binding epitopes. Norovirus interaction with cofactor histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) is important for infection (e.g., GI.1, GII.4, GII.10, and GII.17), although certain genotypes poorly bind HBGAs (e.g., GII.1) (5\u20138). HBGAs are found as soluble antigens in saliva and are expressed on epithelial cells. Studies have indicated that norovirus may interact with HBGAs prior to cell attachment (9) and/or bind particles on cell surfaces (10).",

In our previous studies, we identified norovirus-specific single-chain variable domains (Nanobodies) that block GII norovirus VLP binding to HBGAs (13, 20). We also showed that human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), e.g., 2-fucosyllactose (2\u2032FL), block the GI.1, GII.4, GII.10, and GII.17 HBGA binding pockets (12, 14\u201316). HMOs are the third most abundant compound of human milk and were shown to protect against various pathogens (17, 18). HMOs structurally resemble HBGAs, both being complex glycans that consist of differently linked monosaccharides. HMOs are thought to act as a receptor decoy by mimicking HBGAs and thus blocking virus attachment (19).",

            "text": "As with many antivirals, insufficient cross-reactivity among the diverse norovirus genotypes appears to be a limiting factor for broad-range therapy (11, 20). For other viruses, enhanced effectivity has been achieved by joint administration of several compounds. Indeed, current state-of-the-art therapies take advantage of drug combination approaches. Through additive or synergistic effects, the administration of a combination of drugs can enhance the effectiveness without increasing the overall dose. The drugs can interact to magnify their effects, or, by independently acting on different target sites, ultimately the compounds can complement each other to maximize the response rate to generate a highly efficient combination therapy. In the current standard treatment guidelines for HIV infections, three synergistically acting drugs are used. These compounds are from different drug classes and target distinct stages of the virus life cycle to suppress virus proliferation (21\u201323). Investigation of synergistic or additive drug effects is common in antiviral research for a variety of viruses, such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) and dengue virus (19, 24, 25). Additionally, several studies have shown synergistic effects for viral inhibitors targeting the stage of viral attachment. Combinations of different neutralizing MAbs exhibited positive effects against a number of different viruses, such as HIV, hepatitis C virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (26\u201329). Furthermore, synergistic inhibition of HIV has been observed for combinations of soluble forms of the receptor CD4 combined with different neutralizing MAbs (30). Combined antiviral activity of drugs was also demonstrated in studies using rotavirus, another common cause of gastroenteritis. In these studies, combinations of plant extracts or plant-derived compounds were shown to synergistically increase the inhibition of rotavirus replication in vitro (31, 32).",

Our data suggest that Nano-7 and Nano-62 might clash with the S domain and neighboring P domains, which would mean that the P domains on particles would need to shift to accommodate Nanobody binding. Interestingly, Nano-7 and Nano-94 also blocked VLPs from binding to HBGAs.

The exothermic binding of Nano-62 was characterized by a large enthalpy change coupled with favorable entropy of the binding reaction (Fig. 2). On the contrary, Nano-94 binding was endothermic and was associated with a positive enthalpy change and large positive entropy.

Nano-7 interacted with P1 and P2 subdomain residues as well as both P domain monomers, which included both main and side chains (Fig. 3B). Seven P2 subdomain and four P1 subdomain residues interacted with Nano-7, forming a vast network of direct hydrogen bonds. In addition to hydrogen bonds, electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions with the P1 and P2 subdomain residues were also observed. Overall, Nano-7 was held with copious P domain residues (21 residues and 33 interactions), the most observed to date for any norovirus-specific Nanobody (12, 13). Indeed, this finding was likely related to the subnanomolar affinity of Nano-7 (Fig. 2). Interestingly, Nano-7 bound in such a way that the end opposite to the complementarity-determining region (CDR) loops of the Nanobody might contact the S domain and neighboring P domains. Superposition of GI.1 P domain\u2013Nano-7 complex onto the GI.1 VLP structure showed that the Nano-7 clashed with the S domain as well as neighboring P domains (Fig. 4).

Surprisingly, this finding was similar to Nano-7 (Fig. 4). Moreover, several GII Nanobodies were shown to bind in occluded regions on the capsid (13, 20).

Consequently, we evaluated whether these GI.1 Nanobodies also blocked VLP attachment to PGM using a similar blocking assay (Fig. 9). We found that Nano-62 weakly blocked VLP attachment to PGM, whereas both Nano-7 and Nano-94 blocked GI.1 VLPs in a dose-dependent manner, with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) of 0.4 \u03bcg/ml and 9.2 \u03bcg/ml, respectively. These results were similar to those with GII Nanobodies, where not all Nanobodies were capable of blocking, despite binding at similar regions on the P domain (20). It is tempting to speculate that the greater number P2 subdomain residues interacting with Nano-7, compared to Nano-62, influenced the ability of Nano-7 to inhibit binding to HBGAs, although direct evidence is lacking. Another mechanism might relate to allosteric inhibition, since a similar finding was observed with several GII-specific Nanobodies (20).",

Therefore, we examined the possibility that a combination of Nanobody and 2\u2032FL might have an enhanced HBGA-blocking potential. For these PGM-blocking assays, the VLPs were preincubated with serially diluted Nano-7 or Nano-94 combined with a constant 2\u2032FL concentration (10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mM 2\u2032FL) (Fig. 11). The combination of Nano-7 or Nano-94 with 2\u2032FL led to enhanced inhibition, indicating that no adverse effects occur between Nanobodies and 2\u2032FL. Moreover, the extent of inhibition enhancement correlated with increasing 2\u2032FL concentrations, suggesting a synergistic effect (Fig. 11A to C). Therefore, the mathematical model of Bliss independence (36) was used to determine if the Nanobodies and 2\u2032FL acted in an additive or synergistic manner. The combination of Nano-94 and 40 mM or 50 mM 2\u2032FL was not defined as synergistic, since 2\u2032FL alone already showed high inhibition, and the calculated values for expected additive effects exceeded full inhibition (Fig. 11D and E). According to our 20% criterion for synergistic effects, our data indicated synergism at various Nano-94 and 2\u2032FL concentrations, for example, at 10 mM 2\u2032FL combined with 25, 12.5, and 6.3 \u03bcg/ml of Nano-94 or at 20 and 30 mM 2\u2032FL combined with 12.5 to 3.1 \u03bcg/ml of Nano-94. The strongest synergistic effect was observed for combinations with 20 mM 2\u2032FL.

The major difference between the GI and GII VLP structures was how the P domains were resting on and raised (\u223c15 \u00c5) off the S domains, respectively. One possible reason might relate to the technique used for preparing the VLPs. During crystallization, the P domain could be compacted on the S domain, whereas for cryo-EM, the vitreous ice layer might allow the P domains to be less compressed. Clearly, a high-resolution cryo-EM structure of GI.1 VLPs would be required to confirm if the sample preparation influenced the VLP structure. Another explanation might simply signify the unique structural difference between the two genogroups.

Nano-62 did not influence the particle structure or inhibit HBGA binding; in contrast, Nano-26 was shown to induce particle disassembly upon binding to GII.10 VLPs, therefore effectively inhibiting HBGA binding (20). These results suggested that the specific interactions, as well as the Nanobody orientation with respect to the P domain, were important in terms of how Nanobodies could influence viral integrity. This was also stressed by the fact that Nano-7, which attached to a similar binding site as Nano-62, was strongly inhibiting HBGA binding, whereas Nano-62 did not inhibit.",

In this case, Nano-32 induced rearrangement of P domain loops, which subsequently led to an alteration in surface hydrophobicity. For Nano-94, only minor rearrangements of the P domain loops were observed, implying that the mode of aggregation here was different. In both cases, the binding was characterized by positive enthalpy change coupled with large positive entropy change as main contributing factor to the free energy change (\u0394G). Since only minor structural rearrangements in the P domain occurred upon Nanobody binding, the structures of the respective complexes could be fitted very well to the X-ray structure of the GI.1 VLP (4). However, fitting of Nanobody-P domain complexes in all possible positions on the VLP structure revealed sterical clashes on the capsid. Likewise, similar steric clashes were observed for Nano-62. Overall, these results suggested that the GI.1 hinge region between the P and S domains might have intrinsic flexibility to allow Nano-7 and Nano-62 to bind to intact particles.",

In the case of 2\u2032FL and Nano-94, the treatment resulted in a synergistic inhibitory effect. This inhibition might occur by different mechanisms. For example, Nano-94 treatment led to fast and severe aggregation of VLPs, and the remaining nonaggregated VLPs were inhibited with 2\u2032FL. Alternatively, the aggregated VLPs had a reduced number of 2\u2032FL binding sites, and the concentration of 2\u2032FL relative to the remaining available binding sites was higher. For 2\u2032FL and Nano-85, our data suggested that Nano-85 inhibited HBGA attachment by compromising the stability of VLPs (13), while 2\u2032FL inhibited the binding to HBGAs. Compared to 2\u2032FL and Nano-94, the combination treatment of 2\u2032FL and Nano-85 caused an additive increase in inhibition. In the case of 2\u2032FL with Nano-7, an additive increase in inhibition also was observed. However, the reasons for the Nano-7 inhibition were not clear, except that Nano-7 bound many more P domain residues than other known Nanobodies (13, 20), which might have indirectly affected HBGA binding. Overall, these new data showed that the positive effect of the addition of 2\u2032FL was not limited to a single mode of action of Nanobodies or to a single norovirus genogroup.",

Nanobodies have already been used for prophylactic treatment of other viruses (39). Treatments with Nanobodies are showing promising results for a number of viral infections, including HIV, influenza virus, human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and rotavirus. One study showed that the oral administration of a rotavirus-specific-Nanobody was effective in treating rotavirus-induced diarrhea in an animal model (40). It also showed that the Nanobodies did not interfere with the host humoral antibody response, whereas IgG antibody treatment developed a response (40). They and others concluded that passive Nanobody treatment was safe and had very high efficacy (41\u201343). One of the best-known examples of using Nanobodies against virus infections is for RSV (44). Researchers showed that intranasal administration of bivalent RSV-specific Nanobodies protected mice from infection. This type of treatment could provide immediate protection for the host and should certainly be further exploited with human noroviruses (13, 20). Further inhibition studies are planned with the human norovirus cell culture system.",

Finally, the reaction was stopped with 3 N HCl, and the absorbance at 490 nm (OD490) was measured.
