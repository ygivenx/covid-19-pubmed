Additionally, patients are registered with primary care providers who maintain highly computerized records with detailed demography, immunization status and clinical information.

Serology can detect both symptomatic and asymptomatic infections, thus estimating the true incidence of influenza infection. This parameter cannot be determined by either disease surveillance programmes or detection of virologically confirmed cases as they would vastly underestimate influenza incidence and overestimate severity.15\u201318",

Elderly people have a significantly higher risk of influenza-associated death compared with non-elderly people.48 Additionally, the 2009 pandemic in NZ revealed that the risk of hospitalization and death was markedly higher for Maori and Pacific people, and those from the most deprived socioeconomic groups.3,42,49 However, it is not clear whether these socio-demographic factors are independent risk factors for influenza. Furthermore, some chronic health conditions (high body mass index, asthma and pregnancy) have been shown to increase the risk of having a poor outcome from influenza infection.50\u201353 In NZ, household crowding has been identified as a risk factor for transmission of meningococcal disease,54rheumatic fever55 and tuberculosis56 and may also be contributing to higher rates of influenza for some populations. The household setting (crowding, housing conditions) may influence transmission of influenza, but these effects remain poorly understood.57\u201359 SHIVERS will provide a multifaceted understanding of influenza risk that considers organism, host and environmental factors and opportunities for intervention. This comprehensive and quantitative approach will include detailed consideration of the independent contributions of host ethnicity, socio-economic position, chronic illness status, obesity, household environment exposures and infecting virus.",

The patients were differentiated into SARI cases (those who met the SARI case definition) and non-SARI patients (those with ARI who did not meet the SARI case definition). A case report form captured information on demography, history of presenting illness, comorbidities, influenza vaccination history, disease outcome and risk factors.60 If a patient met the SARI case definition, a respiratory specimen (nasopharyngeal swab or aspirate) was collected and tested simultaneously for influenza and other respiratory viruses by real-time reverse transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques: influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus types 1\u20133, adenovirus and human metapneumovirus (Figure3).60 A systematic sample of about 50% of non-SARI patients were also interviewed and provided a respiratory sample, in addition to those from whom a specimen was collected for clinical purposes. Some SARI cases and non-SARI patients were also tested for clinical purposes for a range of respiratory bacteria (e.g. Streptococcus pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenza) by blood culture, urinary antigen test and PCR.60",
