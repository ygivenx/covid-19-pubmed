According to the World Health Organization (WHO), these annual epidemics result in 3\u20135 million severe illness cases and 290\u2013650 thousand deaths all around the world. Influenza-like illnesses (ILI), a subset of ARIs, accounted for approximately 1.9 million deaths in children below 5 years of age worldwide in 2000 [1]. In addition to the ILI outpatient surveillance, the WHO recommended the member states to start a monitoring for severe ARIs (SARIs) in hospitalized patients after the 2009 influenza pandemic [2].",

Identifying patients with SARI and sepsis having higher risk of mortality is crucial to anticipate prognosis and follow treatment program. Many severity-scoring systems have been developed to assess the severity of these patients. Current guidelines suggest the use of various severity scores such as CURB-65 and pneumonia severity index (PSI) in order to classify patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) [3]. In 2016, the third international consensus definitions for sepsis and septic shock proposed a new definition and a scoring system based on sequential (sepsis-related) organ failure assessment (SOFA) score instead of systemic inflammatory response (SIRS) criterion [4], which has been used to define sepsis for a long time [5]. In addition, the Sepsis-3 task force proposed the quick SOFA (qSOFA) as a simpler scoring system for the initial screening of patients at high risk for sepsis [5,6]. However, debates about the performances of existing classifications are still ongoing.",

Moreover, the findings of physical examination and laboratory tests (complete blood cell count, biochemical parameters, and blood gas), radiographic findings, and clinical outcomes (intubation, ICU admission) were recorded and the nasal swabs were obtained. The scores of CURB-65, PSI, SIRS criteria, qSOFA, SOFA and APACHE II were calculated for all patients admitted to the ED and those who were admitted to the ED more than once.

The possible reasons include actual epidemiological differences, climate differences, methodological differences (such as study inclusion criteria, study period, patient age, diagnostic methods used, and tested virus panels), and failure in sample collection and recording.

On the other hand, McCartney et al. reported that CURB-65 might be misleading in young adults with some atypical pneumonia [22]. A metaanalysis of 23 prospective studies including patients with radiographically-confirmed CAP revealed that the PSI had the lowest false negative rate, meaning that the test was able to correctly identify patients who had nonsevere pneumonia and were at low risk of death. On the other hand, the CURB-65 was more specific in correctly classifying patients who had a greater likelihood of death [23]. In the present study, the PSI was more sensitive but less specific than CURB-65. Capelastegui et al.
