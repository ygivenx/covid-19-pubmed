ZIKV NS2A protein has been previously\nreported to play a role in the disruption of adherens junction formation, which has\nbeen associated with reduced proliferation, premature differentiation and the\ndepletion of radial glial cells in the mouse cortex.\n19\n A single mutation at ZIKV NS2A (A175V), which has been shown to decrease\nvirus production and RNA synthesis in vitro, was associated with an\nattenuated phenotype in a ZIKV mouse model.\n20\n Based on a study by Xie et al.\n21\n and on the transmembrane helices and protein topology prediction program\nHMMTOP (http://www.enzim.hu/hmmtop/), this mutation (A175V) maps to a transmembrane\ndomain. The NS2A mutation M181V (between ZV BR 2015/15261 and ZV BR 2015/15098 or ZV\nBR 2016/16288 - Table III) maps to this same\ndomain. The nature of the mutation is also similar, resulting in just a small\nincrease in the amino acid side chain. The amino acid polymorphism identified in ZV\nBR 2015/15098 NS2A117 presents the same character as minor variants\npreviously identified at this same position through next-generation sequencing.\n22\n There are five other isolates (KX520666/BR/2015, KY648934/MX/2016,\nKX446951/MX/2016, MH900227/MX/2016 and KX377336/MY/1966) in our datasets that\ncontain this same substitution (A117V). Based on the homology and the in\nsilico prediction, this mutation also maps to a transmembrane domain,\nand the only amino acids identified at this position are either alanine or valine.\nAdditionally, when the UTRs of the three new ZIKV isolates were compared, one single\nnucleotide change downstream of the stop codon of the NS5 gene was detected in the\nZIKV ZV BR 2015/15098 strain. This mutation was mapped to the highly variable\nproximal region 1 of the 3\u02b9UTR sequence (3\u02b9HVR), a region of the Flavivirus genome\nknown for displaying large heterogeneity in both sequence and length.\n23\n The flavivirus 3\u2019UTR contains essential elements that function as important\nmediators to promote viral genome replication and translation. Despite this, the\nnucleotide change at 3\u2019HVR of the ZV BR 2015/15098 does not seem to have any impact\non the secondary structure, as shown in the RNA fold analysis\n(Supplementary\ndata). Nevertheless, previous studies have\ndemonstrated that sequence variability at 3\u2019HVR of DENV-1 and DENV-2 are associated\nwith DENV fitness gain or loss in mammalian and insect cells.\n23\n\n,\n\n24\n\n",

This reinforces the importance of using isolates with low\nnumbers of passages to study viral pathogenesis. The mutations on the flavivirus\ngenome are known to influence the virulence, replication efficiency and\nantigen-antibody interaction with the host. In our study, the viral genomes were\nfully sequenced and revealed some nonsynonymous substitutions, which could have an\nimpact on the viral fitness in mammalian and insect cells. Although there is an\nincreasing amount of data from ZIKV genomic analyses, especially after the 2015/2016\noutbreak, there is still a lack of information linking specific amino acid\nsubstitution(s) to viral biological characteristics and fitness. Further studies\nusing reverse genetics are essential to define the role of the observed mutations in\nthe differential infection phenotypes observed, especially in human mdDCs.
