Compared with these synthetic compounds, natural compounds, such as Diotahedral smecta, tea and pine seed shell extract, cacao pigment, Sophora flavescens extract, and Stevia rebaudiana have been identified as ideal candidates for antirotaviral drugs in developing countries because they are effective and cheaper with minimal or without toxicity and side-effects [9-11]. Also noted were compounds found in human milk and soy infant formulation [12-14] that were effective in inhibiting rotavirus infection. Potential components found in high levels in soy-based infant formulation were isoflavones [14]. In vitro study revealed that genistin and mixtures of isoflavones can inhibit rotavirus infection by modulating virus attachment and post-binding step [14]. High levels of antiviral activity were found to be related with mucin found in the human milk [12]. Both in vitro and in vivo studies showed that variation in milk mucin glycoproteins may be correlated with different levels of protection against infection with gastrointestinal pathogens [12]. Lactadherin, a mucin-associated glycoprotein was also found to specifically inhibit rotavirus replication both in vitro and in vivo[13].",

In addition, licorice extracts have generally been recognized as safe and are used as flavoring and sweetening agents for tobaccos, chewing gums, candies, toothpaste, and beverages [16]. The bioactive constitute of licorice root are saponins, flavonoids, isoflavones, coumarins, stilbenoids, and some miscellaneous compounds [15]. These compounds exert many useful pharmacological properties that include anti-cancer, anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, anti-malaria, anti-bacterial, antioxidant, and estrogenic activities [15,17]. The compounds extracted from Glycyrrhiza species showed antiviral activities via inhibiting virus absorption and replication such as influenza virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, hepatitis A-C viruses (HAV-HCV), Epstein Barr virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and Japanese encephalitis virus [16,18]. Moreover, these compounds are known to modulate virus-induced inflammatory response [17,19]. In our previous study [20], polyphenol compounds from the roots of Glycyrrhiza uralensis (G. uralensis) exerted in vitro anti-RVA activity by inhibiting both viral absorption and viral replication. Another in vitro study also suggests that 18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid, the aglycone product of glycyrrhizin hydrolysis can inhibit rotavirus entry into the cells [21]. However, there is little evidence whether this compound inhibit RVA infection in the animal models.",

Moreover, the similarity in the gastrointestinal physiology and immune system of piglets and human infants [22] makes it a suitable animal model for testing the efficacy of antirotaviral drug candidates. In the present study, colostrums-deprived piglets obtained from sows by hysterectomy and maintained in isolator units were used as a RVA animal model, and this model exactly showed diarrhea at DPI 2 after oral inoculation of a porcine RVA K85 strain. We selected the porcine G5P[7] K85 strain for this study since the genotype constellation of the porcine and human rotaviruses was very similar, suggesting sharing the same ancestor [23]. Among virus-inoculated and GUE treated groups, GUE at a dose of 400 mg/ml administered to the test animals completely cured RVA diarrhea. The anti-RVA effects of GUE were also demonstrated by a significant improvement of the intestinal lesion score and of the fecal virus shedding. These results suggest that this herbal medicine may be a potent medication for curing RVA diarrhea in humans and animals. In recent studies, rotaviruses had been detected in extraintestinal organs and in serum samples of rotavirus-infected animals and humans [24]. In the future study, therefore, the effect of GUE on these points should be addressed.",

Of particular interest is that polyphenol compounds isolated from the roots of G. uralensis had inhibitory effects of RVA activities in cultured cells through blocking viral adsorption to cells and virus replication in the cells [20]. In the present in vivo study, GUE completely cured diarrhea and significantly improved fecal virus shedding and histological lesion changes in the small intestine. Like our in vitro data [20], polyphenol compounds in the GUE may inhibit virus replication in the villous epithelium of small intestine, where RVAs mainly replicate. This inhibitory activity may result in marked reduction of virus excretions from the infected cells into small intestinal lumen. Another interesting finding showed that 18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid, a metabolite of glycyrrhizin reduced the yields of infectious virus and viral protein levels by interfering with rotavirus replication at a step subsequent to virus entry [21]. Another possible in vivo inhibitory mechanism is that polyphenol compounds in the GUE may bind the sialic acid receptor of RVA on the cell surface of the small intestinal villi [20]. Consequently, viruses released from the infected cells could not infect new epithelial cells of the small intestinal villi. Taken together, the data indicate that all these compounds in the GUE cure diarrhea by blocking RVA attachment (polyphenol compounds), entry (18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid) and replication (polyphenol compounds) in the villous epithelium.",

Activation of NF\u03baB, p38, and JNK has been associated with virus replication and virus-induced pro-inflammatory gene expression [27,28]. However, some rotavirus strains are known to down-regulate NF\u03baB activity through the functions of nonstructural protein NSP1 [29]. Inflammatory responses, which are the most important host defense mechanism against pathogens, can be detrimental and are often more harmful to the hosts than the inciting pathogens. In the present experiment, RVA infection increased mRNA expression levels of IL-8, IL-10, IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3 and TNF- \u03b1 in the small intestine and spleen in piglets inoculated with RVA alone, whereas GUE treatment down-regulated the mRNA expression levels of these genes in the piglets after the induction of RVA diarrhea as indicated by polynomial orthogonal contrast. Moreover, NF\u03baB, p38, and JNK genes were inhibited in the GUE-treated piglets after RVA diarrhea, but were activated in the RVA-infected piglets without treatment. These data suggested that GUE treatment modulates proinflammatory reaction, leading alleviating intestinal lesions being exacerbated by host inflammation.",

Notable, however, were reports that showed 18beta-glycyrrhetinic acid can induce NF\u03baB activation and generate IL-8 secretion in RVA-infected MA 104 cells [21,32]. In the present study, proinflammatory cytokines, and its related transcription factor and signaling molecules are inhibited in the GUE-treated piglets after RVA diarrhea, but not in the RVA-inoculated piglets without treatment. Although 18beta-glycyrrhetinic acid can induce NF\u03baB activation and generate IL-8 secretion in vitro and possibly in vivo, in vivo inhibitory effects of these proinflammatory reactions might be predominant by glycyrrhizin and other compounds in the GUE as well as viral nonstructural protein NSP1. The future studies need to address which compound exerts inflammatory or anti-inflammatory effects in animal models. We are currently investigating the roles of several compounds in the GUE in modulating the rotavirus infection in vivo.",

Each group contained three piglets. At 3 days of age, piglets of groups 1-4 were orally inoculated with 3 ml of the K85 strain containing a virus titer of 5 x 105 FFU/ml. After DPI 2, piglets showed signs of diarrhea. Among these groups, three groups were treated four times daily with 100 mg/ml, 200 mg/ml, or 400 mg/ml of GUE for 7 days, respectively. The remaining virus-inoculated group was mock-treated. At 5 days of age, three mock-inoculated groups were treated four times daily with 100 mg/ml, 200 mg/ml, or 400 mg/ml GUE for 7 days, respectively. As the control group, piglets were mock-inoculated and mock-treated. The antiviral effects of GUE were evaluated on the basis of diarrhea score, histopathological lesions in the small intestines, quantitation of fecal virus shedding, and expressions of different transcription factors and cytokines. The results obtained from the groups treated with GUE were compared with those of the mock-inoculated and mock-treated groups. Piglets were also observed for signs of adverse effects during drug administration. The studies performed were approved by the University Animal Care Committee (CNU IACUC-YB-R-2009-15).",

Briefly, total RNA extracted from each fecal sample was processed using a Corbett Research Rotor-Gene Real-Time Amplification System (Corbett Research, Mortlake, Australia) and SensiMix one-step RT-PCR with SYBR Green (Quantace, London, UK). The reaction mixture was composed of 5 \u03bcl RNA, 12.5 \u03bcl SensiMix one-step mixture, 1 \u03bcl each of 0.5 M forward and reverse primer, 0.5 \u03bcl of 50\u00d7SYBR Green solution, 0.5 \u03bcl of RNase inhibitor (final concentration: 10 units), 0.5 \u03bcl of MgCl2 (final concentration: 4.0 mM), and 4 \u03bcl of RNase free water. Reverse transcription was performed at 50\u00b0C for 30 min, followed by 95\u00b0C for 15 min to activate the DNA polymerase and 45 three-step cycles: 95\u00b0C for 15 s, 51\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min. Using the Rotagene 6000\u00ae, the amount of RVA-specific RNA in the fecal samples was quantified based on the standard curve derived from serial 10-fold dilutions of the in vitro transcription of complementary RNA (cRNA). The highest amplification rate was defined automatically in the initial exponential phase. A direct relationship between the cycle number and the log concentration of RNA molecules initially present in the RT-PCR reaction was evident with regard to the crossing points resulting from amplification curves and this threshold. Rotogene 6000\u00ae software was used to set up a standard curve that allowed the determination of concentration of RNA present in the samples using a linear regression analysis of the data.",
