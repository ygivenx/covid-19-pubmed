            "text": "The diagnosis of feline hemotropic mycoplasma infection relies on the detection and differentiation of the infectious agents by sensitive and specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [2,7]. To quantify the humoral immune response to feline hemoplasmas, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) based on a recombinant M. haemofelis DnaK protein have been developed [8,9]. The recombinant M. haemofelis protein recognizes antibodies to M. haemofelis and, to a lesser degree, antibodies to \u201cCand. M. turicensis\u201d and \u201cCand. M. haemominutum\u201d; the observed cross-reactivity of the humoral immune response led to the assumption of a potential cross-protection among the three hemoplasma infections. In a recent study, high levels of antibodies were detected in cats experimentally infected with \u201cCand. M. turicensis\u201d, even months after the infection and bacteremia had cleared [10]. These \u201cCand. M. turicensis\u201d PCR-negative seropositive cats were also protected from subsequent \u201cCand. M. turicensis\u201d challenge [10,11]. Similarly, cats that had overcome M. haemofelis bacteremia and were PCR-negative and serologically positive for M. haemofelis were subsequently protected from a second M. haemofelis bacteremia after re-exposure [12]. Limited information is available concerning potential cross-protection against infections with different feline hemoplasma species. In some naturally infected cats and wildcats, dual or triple infections with M. haemofelis, \u201cCand. M. haemominutum\u201d and \u201cCand. M. turicensis\u201d have been reported [13\u201316]. However, in natural infections, it typically cannot be determined if the infections were simultaneously or sequentially acquired. Cross-protection might be expected only when the infections are sequentially acquired after an efficient immune response had been raised. Experimental co-infection was demonstrated in an early infection study using so-called large and small Haemobartonella felis strains [17]. However, these cats had not cleared the primary infection when superinfected with a second hemoplasma strain, and thus no cross-protection was observed [17].",

Copy number fluctuations throughout the course of M. haemofelis infection were observed in all cats but were more pronounced in the cats in group B; the copy number fluctuations were particularly marked in cat ZKA2 in group B (up to a four-log fluctuation within four days; Figure 1G).",

By contrast, cats previously infected with \u201cCand. M. turicensis\u201d infection exhibited faster onset of the infection and became PCR-positive and anemic significantly earlier than the na\u00efve M. haemofelis-exposed control cats. Moreover, the cats previously infected with \u201cCand. M. turicensis\u201d had persistently high M. haemofelis bacterial loads (\u2265107 copies/mL) and higher total, CD4+, CD8+ and CD4+CD25+ T cells than na\u00efve cats within days after M. haemofelis exposure. There are several possible explanations for the finding that \u201cCand. M. turicensis\u201d-recovered cats became M. haemofelis PCR-positive significantly earlier than na\u00efve cats. Pre-existing antibodies against hemoplasmas might have impacted the kinetics of M. haemofelis infection in cats that had recovered from \u201cCand. M. turicensis\u201d infection, e.g., through antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). ADE can increase the replication and distribution of pathogens, particularly viruses, e.g., feline corona virus [33]. However, ADE has also been suspected in bacterial infection [34] because the specific antibody response against Streptococcus pneumoniae enhances infection. It has been speculated that bacterial enzymes can modify specific IgA1 antibodies so that the binding of bacteria to the target cells is not inhibited but augmented, thereby facilitating the prolonged persistence of the bacteria at the mucosal surfaces of the respiratory tract [34,35]. Because cross-reactivity of antibodies to feline hemoplasmas, at least to the currently available recombinant M. haemofelis antigen DnaK, has been demonstrated [8,9], the occurrence of a similar phenomenon in \u201cCand. M. turicensis\u201d-recovered cats with high antibody levels prior to M. haemofelis exposure cannot be excluded. Alternatively, chronically \u201cCand. M. turicensis\u201d-infected cats may have become M. haemofelis PCR-positive earlier than na\u00efve cats due to modulation or down-regulation of the immune system. The influence of a hemotropic mycoplasma infection on the host immune system has not yet been completely elucidated. For non-hemotropic mycoplasma infections, a multitude of mechanisms have been described that might modulate or down-regulate the cell-mediated and/or humoral immune response of the infected host [36].",

M. turicensis\u201d-M. haemofelis) but not homologous challenge (\u201cCand. M. turicensis\u201d-\u201cCand. M. turicensis\u201d and M. haemofelis-M. haemofelis) [10,12,11]. Based on the immune response after hemoplasma infections, a Th1 response was suspected in primary M. haemofelis infection in na\u00efve cats [12], while primary \u201cCand. M. turicensis\u201d infection in na\u00efve cats might be associated with an early Th1 response, with a subsequent switch to Th2 [11]. In cats that had recovered from \u201cCand. M. turicensis\u201d infection, protection from reinfection was associated with an early and pronounced Th2 response [11]. While these results require further confirmation, the Th1/Th2 response may have at least partially contributed to the lack of cross-protection and the differences in the infection kinetics observed in the present study. If indeed \u201cCand. M. turicensis\u201d infection leads to the stimulation of the humoral immune response (Th2), this effect might be counterproductive during subsequent M. haemofelis exposure, in which protection was observed in the absence of a Th2 response [12]. At the start of the study, in addition to the seropositivity for DnaK, \u201cCand. M. turicensis\u201d-recovered cats had higher total lymphocyte counts, protein, albumin and \u02512-, \u03b2- and \u0263-globulin concentrations than the na\u00efve control cats, indicating immune system stimulation in \u201cCand. M. turicensis\u201d-recovered cats. In particular, the increase in globulin levels may indicate a predominance of the humoral immune response in these cats. Thus, the \u201cCand. M. turicensis\u201d-recovered cats, despite or even due to the observed seropositivity and the status of the immune system, may have been ill-prepared for subsequent M. haemofelis exposure. Consistently, within days after M. haemofelis exposure, \u201cCand. M. turicensis\u201d-recovered cats exhibited higher total, CD4+, CD8+ and reactivated (CD4+CD25+) T-cell counts than the control cats.",

M. turicensis\u201d-recovered cats in that \u201cCand. M. turicensis\u201d-recovered cats but not na\u00efve cats showed a transient decrease in lymphocyte subsets, especially in B cells, during maximal bacteremia. In a previous study, a transient decrease in lymphocytes during M. haemofelis infection was attributed to cell migration from the blood to the draining lymph nodes, where lymphocytes become activated and proliferative [12]. The increase in total protein concentrations suggests B cell activation during high bacteremia. This increase was paralleled by a decrease in albumin, possibly due to the role of albumin as a negative acute phase protein [37]. The increase in total protein at the time of maximal bacteremia is primarily attributable to the increased production of immunoglobulins, as demonstrated by the detection of polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia in the serum protein electrophoresis of samples obtained from nine of ten cats. While the observed hypergammaglobulinemia coincided with the high specific antibodies to M. haemofelis determined by recombinant M. haemofelis DnaK antigen ELISA, a large proportion of the immunoglobulins were probably not hemoplasma-specific, reflecting polyclonal B cell activation. Mitogenicity and the activation of lymphocytes in a non-specific polyclonal manner has been well described for non-hemotropic mycoplasmas [36]. For Mycoplasma suis, a porcine hemoplasma, significant alterations to the RBC surfaces lead to the upregulation of naturally occurring B cells specific for self-antigens and the induction of auto-reactive IgM and IgG, which in turn leads to extra and intravascular hemolysis [38]. A previous study demonstrated that M. haemofelis-infected cats harbor antibodies directed against the erythrocyte surface (Coombs\u2019 test positive) at the nadir of hematocrit values and at times of maximal bacteremia [24]. In the current study, Coombs\u2019 test was negative, but this test was performed at a later time point during infection, when B cell counts and immunoglobulin values had returned to pre-infection values.",

Alterations in lipid metabolism and decreased cholesterol levels have been reported in many infections, including viral, bacterial and parasitic infections [39,40]. The observed decrease in cholesterol concentration in the present study might reflect an increased need for cholesterol for membrane synthesis for either large numbers of RBCs destroyed during the M. haemofelis infection and/or the fast amplification of hemoplasmas. Mycoplasmas depend on cholesterol from the host for membrane synthesis and they incorporate large quantities of cholesterol into the membrane for improved membrane fluidity [36].",

            "text": "The cytokine response observed during M. haemofelis infection in the present study was predominantly of the Th1 type, consistent with previous results for na\u00efve cats infected with M. haemofelis [12]. In the present study, na\u00efve but particularly \u201cCand. M. turicensis\u201d-recovered cats displayed a massive (~1100-fold) increase in IFN-\u03b3 transcription levels approximately coincident with the appearance of high bacterial loads. This effect was paralleled by a pronounced decrease in the IL-4/IFN-\u03b3 ratio (~250-fold). These alterations suggest the predominance of a Th1 response in both groups after the establishment of high bacterial loads in these cats, in contrast to the predominance of a Th2 response with high IL-4 transcription levels, a high IL-4/IL-12 ratio and an increase in eosinophils observed in \u201cCand. M. turicensis\u201d-infected cats during high \u201cCand. M. turicensis\u201d bacteremia [11]. Consistent with the absence of a Th2 response, no eosinophilia was observed in the present study; rather, a decrease in eosinophils was observed at times of maximal bacteremia. The Th1 response postulated in the M. haemofelis-infected cats in the present study might at first glance be contradicted by the major increase in IL-10 levels particularly in na\u00efve cats (~1700-fold) also observed during high bacterial loads. An increase in IL-10 transcription levels was also observed in a previous study in na\u00efve cats infected with M. haemofelis but not in cats protected from M. haemofelis re-infection [12]. IL-10 has multiple effects [41]: it inhibits Th1 cells and may be associated with B cell proliferation and antibody production. Thus, the high IL-10 transcription levels observed at times of high bacteremia would be consistent with the high serum protein, \u03b3-globulin and anti-M. haemofelis DnaK antibody levels observed at the same time. However, IL-10 is also considered a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine that may limit the damage to the host due to exacerbated inflammation while prolonging pathogen clearance [41,42]. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that the high IL-10 levels observed during maximal bacteremia in M. haemofelis-infected cats in a previous study might limit the inflammatory response to M. haemofelis and potentially prevent the clearance of these organisms [12]. Whether such an anti-inflammatory effect is beneficial during bacterial infections and sepsis has been debated. It is unknown if high (anti-inflammatory) IL-10 levels observed in the present study are associated with the decreased leukocyte counts and neutropenia observed during high bacteremia; among other hematological alterations, leukocytosis and neutrophilia are characteristics of inflammation. A reduction in local and systemic inflammation in connection with IL-10 may reflect the inhibition of cell trafficking, particularly the recruitment of neutrophils to the injury site, via inhibition of the production of neutrophil chemoattractants [42].",

Positive saliva and rectal swabs were obtained during high bacteremia, but only infrequently and not persistently. This finding might explain why previous studies were unable to detect M. haemofelis in saliva and salivary gland samples collected at only one time point or late during infection in only a few cats [22,43]. Moreover, the M. haemofelis loads observed in salivary swabs (a few hundred copies/swab) in the present study corresponded to those of \u201cCand. M. turicensis\u201d-infected cats, as reported in previous studies [21,22]. Because \u201cCand. M. turicensis\u201d-infected cats fairly consistently shed \u201cCand. M. turicensis\u201d via saliva during high bacteremia [21,22] but the maximal blood loads were lower than in M. haemofelis-infected cats, factors other than blood load must play a role in whether feline hemoplasmas are shed via saliva. No M. haemofelis transmission studies using PCR-positive saliva or feces have been conducted. Transmission studies have been performed using \u201cCand. M. turicensis\u201d PCR-positive saliva, but na\u00efve cats did not demonstrate infection after oral uptake or subcutaneous inoculation of \u201cCand. M. turicensis\u201d PCR-positive saliva [21]. In the present study, M. haemofelis-positive urine samples were also observed. Because the samples were collected through cystocentesis, we cannot completely exclude a contribution of erythrocyte contamination to the PCR-positive result. However, M. haemofelis PCR-positive results were also detected in urine samples in which no erythrocytes were detectable using urine test strips and sediment analyses. The low M. haemofelis copy numbers in the saliva, feces and urine samples of M. haemofelis-infected cats and the infrequent shedding, even during high bacteremia, suggest a minimal risk of transmission through mutual grooming and the sharing of feeding dishes or litter boxes; however, this should be confirmed in future studies.",
