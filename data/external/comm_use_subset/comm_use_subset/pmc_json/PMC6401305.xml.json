A grave public health concern is when and how the next outbreak will occur1; threats of imminent global outbreaks are real2. The 1917 Spanish influenza, which killed 50 million people, was the worst-ever pandemic on record \u2013 and that was back at a time when travel by ship was the fastest means of transportation around the globe. In today\u2019s tightly connected world, an epidemic can potentially travel at jet-speed. Indeed, Swine flu was first detected in April of 2009 in Mexico and within a week it turned up in London.",

Preventive measures may fall out of fashion when the disease is absent for long periods, only to hit harder when it returns due to the lower level of immunity. A standard recommendation of health organizations in the face of an outbreak is the isolation of infected individuals3\u20135. This control strategy dates back centuries and its usefulness has not diminished with time, as evidenced in the recent outbreaks of SARS in Asia and Ebola in West Africa. Research has progressed in the meantime; mathematical models to understand the impact and effectiveness of isolation and quarantine protocols have been proposed and analyzed6\u20139; it has been shown that the effectiveness of isolation protocols can be increased by contact tracing and isolation of individuals prior to symptoms10,11.",

Among the obstacles are the following: Physical facilities to house the isolated population, and medical personnel to care for them, have to be available11,12. Even then, the identification of infected hosts, a crucial first step in any isolation strategy, can be a formidable task. At early stages of an outbreak, the general population \u2013 even local health authorities \u2013 may fail to recognize the symptoms of an infectious disease (which are often ambiguous), or they may not be cognizant of the potential dangers of runaway exponential growth of infectious diseases9. For reasons of their own, such as distrust of authorities, infected individuals may choose not to seek medical attention. The cost of preparedness and surveillance, and the maintenance of adequate infrastructure and personnel that can be deployed at a moment\u2019s notice, can be prohibitively high13.",

It was not until Oct 2014 that billions of dollars were allocated for training of personnel, construction and maintenance of holding centers and treatment units. Once the response capability improved, and delays in identifying infected individuals were shortened, the spreading of the disease was more effectively curtailed12,14. Detrimental effects of delay were also reported during the SARS outbreak, which became more effectively controlled only when the time between onset of symptoms and isolation was shortened12,15. Though recent studies have used linear analysis6,16 and simulations17 to investigate the role of isolation, a general comprehensive theory of isolation as a means of epidemic control that focuses on consequences of imperfect implementation is lacking, as are studies of the nonlinear effects of isolation protocols.",

First and foremost is the minimum response capability required to contain an outbreak. We determine the isolation probability, the critical fraction of the infected population that must be isolated, and the identification time, how quickly local authorities must act to prevent a full-blown outbreak. Our model predicts the nature of the endemic state that follows should the response be inadequate, and the extent to which a stronger response can ameliorate the severity of an outbreak. It offers crucial information to health authorities such as estimates on the fraction of the population that can be expected to fall ill, and answers theoretical questions such as the potential benefits of longer durations of isolation.",

In the present work, we analyzed the continuum limit of an isolation strategy. Under some assumptions on identification and isolation times, we obtained a system of Delay Differential Equations (DDE) describing the time course of an infection following an outbreak. These equations are amenable to mathematical analysis20,21, enabling us to understand rigorously many of the issues above. Our model is complex enough to capture key ideas, and simple enough to permit the representation of relevant quantities explicitly in terms of disease and control parameters. We view these as among our model\u2019s greatest strengths.",

What is different here is that we have assumed a constant response \u03b5, so that for small I(t), the situation is similar to that discussed in the paragraph on R(0) > 0 in the first part of Results. In particular, if S(t) is such that r(1 \u2212 \u03b5)S(t) < 1, the infection will temporarily abate, to flare up again when S(t) is large enough to bring this quantity above 1. Notice that the x-axis in Fig. 3(a) is in units t/(\u03c4 + \u03c3 + \u03ba), so that the timescales for the cycles of infection are significantly longer than any of these quantities.

Figure 3(c\u2013e) describe how Ipeak and Qpeak vary as we permit \u03b1, \u03c3 and \u03b5 to become positive. From Fig. 3(c), we see that while \u03b1 has a strong effect on Ieq and Qeq, its effect on Ipeak and Qpeak are relatively small, because immunity loss occurs on a much longer timescale than the time it takes to reach Ipeak or Qpeak. Figure 3(d) shows that both Ipeak and Qpeak are smaller for diseases with longer incubation periods. This presumably is due to the fact that a long incubation slows down the rate of infection, while recovery occurs at the same rate. Figure 3(e) shows that Ipeak decreases as the response is stronger as expected. The dependence of Qpeak on \u03b5 is more complicated: In the figure, \u03c4 is fixed and p is increased, i.e., a larger fraction of the infectious is isolated and Qpeak increases with \u03b5 for this interval of \u03b5, but this trend will be reversed as \u03b5 continues to increase and Ipeak continues to drop.",
