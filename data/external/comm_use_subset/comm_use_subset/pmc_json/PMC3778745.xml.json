A glycan moiety of AGP has been shown to be modified in cats subclinically and terminally-infected with FIV (Pocacqua et al., 2005). In the present study lower AGP concentrations were found in FIV-infected compared with non-FIV-infected animals following CMhm infection and higher Hp concentrations occurred in FIV-infected compared with non-FIV-infected cats infected with Mhf. However, while these results were statistically significant, measurements for each group of cats remained within reference intervals and numbers in each group were small. These results are in contrast to those of Duthie et al. (1997), where APPs were measured at a single time-point in six cats with terminal, FIV-associated disease. This study found that 5/6 and 4/6 cats had AGP and Hp concentrations above the reference intervals, respectively.",

Indeed, Tasker et al. (2006a) found that CMhm infection resulted in decreased PCV in all cats, but in only one-third of animals did this decrease to the point of anaemia. The concentration of SAA also correlates with disease severity in feline pancreatitis (Tamamoto et al., 2009), where decreases mirror clinical improvement.

Instead, because there were few data points recorded within this period, statistical analysis was performed on the mean APP concentrations pi for each infecting haemoplasma.
