HCoV-OC43 was first found in a patient with a cold in 1967 [8]. Virologists paid little attention to the virus, however, until SARS-CoV emerged in 2002\u20132003 in China [4]. Outbreaks of HCoV-OC43 occur frequently worldwide and are often associated with acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) [11]\u2013[16]. Such infections might be dangerous to infants, elderly individuals, and immunocompromised patients [17], [18]. HCoV-OC43 is also suspected of causing gastrointestinal and central nervous system diseases [19]\u2013[21].",

The time of divergence was first extensively used for coronaviruses after the SARS epidemic for estimating the date of interspecies jumping of BCoV or HCoV-OC43 ancestor from bovine to humans [22], [23]. HCoV-OC43 has a high frequency of mutation, using both base substitution and homologous RNA recombination [26], [27]. Among the structural viral proteins, the spike (S) protein is used for receptor binding and viral entry and has the most variable sequence within the coronavirus genome [24]\u2013[27]. S protein is cleaved into two subunits, S1 and S2 [2]. The S1 gene has been reported to show the dominant genetic diversity or heterogeneity among circulating HCoV strains [24], [27]. The nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N) gene is another common target for serological assays [28], [29]. In view of the published data and the role of structural proteins, analysis of the S and N genes would be appropriate for determination of the genetic diversity of HCoV variants. In addition, the use of multiple primer sets targeting the S and N genes is recommended for diagnosis of all types of HCoV infection [30]\u2013[36].",

Molecular epidemiology and evolution studies of HCoV-OC43 have recently been conducted in some areas [22]\u2013[25], and the data revealed at least three distinct clusters based on RdRp, S, and N genes and the emergence of a novel genotype, D, arising from natural recombination events between genotypes B and C [25]. However, the molecular epidemiology and genetic diversity of HCoV-OC43 variants among adult patients with ARI in Beijing are not understood fully. To address these issues, this report includes investigation of the prevalence of HCoV-OC43 among 559 respiratory samples collected in Beijing as assessed using two RT-PCR assays targeting the S and N genes, respectively, followed by direct sequencing of PCR products and genetic diversity analysis of partial S and N genes of HCoV-OC43 variants. The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients were also evaluated and their relationships with genetic diversity determined. This is the first report of the molecular prevalence and genetic diversity of HCoV-OC43 variants among adult patients with ARI in Beijing.",

This study is the first report of the molecular epidemiology and genetic diversity of HCoV-OC43 infection in adult patients with ARI from Beijing. We analysed 559 nasopharyngeal swab samples, 70 (12.52%; 95% CI: 9.78\u201315.26%) of which tested positive for detection of HCoV-OC43, which is consistent with a previous report [34]\u2013[36], [40]. In total, 50 amplicons from the S gene and 40 amplicons from the N gene of HCoV-OC43 isolates were sequenced. Phylogenetic tree analysis based on partial S or N gene sequences in this study showed the presence of at least three clusters (A, B, and C/D) among HCoV-OC43 strains from Beijing adult patients with ARI. Interestingly, we are the first to describe three novel HCoV-OC43 clusters or subclusters based on phylogenetic analysis of partial S genes. The UNTI cluster comprised of 4 isolates from Germany and England showed high similarity with BCoV (AF391542); however, no UNTI strain was found in our patients from Beijing. Some cluster-specific markers of amino acid changes were noted among partial S and N protein sequences from the HCoV-OC43 isolates.",

The analytic sensitivity of primers specific for different targets has been described previously [33], [35]. In the current study, we designed two sets of primers to amplify partial S and N gene sequences of HCoV-OC43 based on the bioinformatics literature. The detection limit for each assay was 10 copies/reaction and rate was not significantly different for the two RT-PCR assays (8.94 vs. 7.16%; p>0.05), but the HCoV-OC43 detection rate was enhanced significantly when the results from the two assays were combined (12.52%; 95% CI: 9.78\u201315.26%). This indicates that combining RT-PCR assays with different targets is advantageous for detection of HCoV-OC43 infection with increased sensitivity.",

            "text": "The most commonly used genes used for phylogenetic studies include chymotrypsin-like protease, Pol, helicase, S, and N, because these are present in all coronavirus genomes and are of considerable length [3], [22]\u2013[25]. Two studies from Europe analysing the S1 genes of various HCoV-OC43 strains showed high genetic diversity [26], [27]. In the current study, we constructed phylogenetic trees using the S1 sequence, which encodes the N-terminus domain (spanning amino acids 188\u2013425) of HCoV-OC43 S and contains a hypervariable region (Figure S2 in File S2). Our data showed that there were at least five distinct clusters of HCoV-OC43 strains based on analysis of this partial S gene. We also constructed phylogenetic trees using the partial N sequence (spanning amino acids 288\u2013448 of N), which represents the major diagnostic antigen and more conserved transcripts of the HCoV infection. We found that some of HCoV-OC43 isolates from our patients with ARI showed discrepancies between the S- and N-based phylogenetic trees, which might indicate the emergence of natural recombination events, as suggested in previous reports [25]\u2013[27], since one unique feature of coronavirus replication is the high frequency of RNA recombination [25], [42]\u2013[44]. RNA recombination is an important mechanism for the natural evolution of coronaviruses. The mean evolutionary rate of HCoV-OC43 was calculated to be 6.7\u00d710\u22124 and 3.6\u00d710\u22124 nucleotide substitutions per site per year for the S and N genes, respectively [24], [25]. Hence, it is easy to speculate that the appearance of a novel cluster of HCoV-OC43 strains in the current study was due to natural recombination events within the circulating HCoV-OC43 population in Beijing. To better understand the recombination and evolution of HCoV-OC43, future studies should take into account the complete genome sequences of clinical strains. That being said, the data presented here provide a better understanding of the evolution of HCoV-OC43 in different geographic areas and the role of selective pressures at different regions of the genome.",

Through this analysis, we identified several novel clusters of HCoV-OC43. The most important findings of this study are that we provide substantial evidence for the genetic diversity of HCoV-OC43. At least three distinct clusters (A, B, C/D) of HCoV-OC43 strains are circulating among adults with ARI in Beijing in 2010 and some novel unique clusters (UNT) of HCoV-OC43 was found. Our data also suggest that cluster-specific genetic markers and natural recombinant events in the HCoV-OC43 genome need further investigation.",
