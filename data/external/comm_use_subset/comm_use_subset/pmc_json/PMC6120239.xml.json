Next, EV71\u2010infected mice were utilized to examine miR\u20109 expression in vivo. The EV71 was injected into the abdomen of the mice, which were sacrificed either four or five days following appearance of severe posterior paralysis. Real\u2010time PCR analysis revealed that the virus mainly localized to the lung and muscle (Fig. 1C). There were relatively low titers of EV71 in the spleen, brain, liver, and intestine. The expression level of miR\u20109 in different tissues was then examined. We observed a significant decrease in miR\u20109 expression in muscle, intestine, lung, and brain (Fig. 1D).

To determine whether the RIG\u2010I pathway plays an essential role in the miR\u20109\u2010regulated host innate immune response to EV71 infection, analysis of RIG\u2010I and two key sensors (IRF3 and NF\u03baB) was performed at the transcriptional and translational levels after EV71 infection and/or miR\u20109\u2010mimic treatment (Fig. 5A). Protein expression of both IRF3 and RIG\u2010I in miR\u20109\u2010mimic\u2010expressing cells did not show a significant difference with nontransfected cells. However, NF\u03baB expression decreased after miR\u20109\u2010mimic transfection compared to cells only induced by EV71. Additionally, phosphorylated NF\u03baB, which is an indication of activated NF\u03baB, was reduced, but phosphorylated IRF3 was not. Consistent with these results, real\u2010time PCR data suggested more efficient downregulation of NF\u03baB was observed in RD cells treated with miR\u20109\u2010mimic, while lower NF\u03baB was detected in the miR\u20109\u2010mimic\u2010treated group, compared to the nontreated group (Fig. 5B).

NF\u03baB is a signaling pathway that regulates many genes related to cell differentiation, proliferation, and innate immune response. In addition, via eliciting pro\u2010inflammatory cytokine and type I IFN (IFN\u2010\u03b2 and IFN\u2010\u03b1) expression, NF\u03baB is important in the antiviral reactions of the host 29, 30, 31. However, the 2C protein of EV71 suppresses NF\u03baB activation, which increases the virus replication. Viral protein 2C suppresses the phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2 via binding with their kinase domains, reducing NF\u03baB activation, and promoting viral replication 32. In our study, miR\u20109 administration resulted in deactivation and expression of NF\u03baB while inhibiting EV71 replication. These results could be attributed to the robust pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines, which are believed to contribute to EV71 pathogenicity, which were ameliorated by miR\u20109 expression, indicating that a moderate level of cytokines and interferon was maintained to limit the effect of EV71. However, the molecular mechanisms by which miR\u20109 controls VP1 expression and viral replication during EV71 infection still need further research to investigate the possibility of whether miR\u20109 inhibits inflammation and EV71 propagation separately.",

Although the sequence of miR\u20109 is conserved, its expression profile differs significantly in various species. miR\u20109 is being extensively investigated in various biological processes: NPC proliferation and migration 33, neuronal differentiation 34, apoptotic cell death 35, brain function and neurodegeneration 36, and cancer 37. Moreover, accumulating evidence suggests that miR\u20109 is required for replication of multiple of viruses. Dong et al. 38 indicated a novel function of miR\u20109 in influenza A virus infection and found that the influenza virus might hijack endogenous miR\u20109 for the viral life cycle. Tatro et al. 39 suggested that HIV infection induced elevated expression of miR\u20109, causing suppression of splice variants of KCNMA1, which may affect the release of neurotransmitters. Lai et al. reported that the nucleocapsid protein of human coronavirus OC43 causes activation of NF\u03baB. This activation was the consequence of the nucleocapsid binding to RNA, specifically miR\u20109 (a negative NF\u03baB modulator), as was found in this study 40. Our study suggests that miR\u20109 is a negative mediator for EV71 replication in vitro and in vivo. Ectopic expression of miR\u20109 in cells resulted in inactivation of NF\u03baB and ameliorated the excessive cytokine production, potentially lessening the organ injury induced by the cytokine storm during virus infection.",
