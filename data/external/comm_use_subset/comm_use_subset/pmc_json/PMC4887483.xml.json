            "text": "The renal proximal tubular renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is activated in pathogenic states such as diabetic nephropathy, and enhanced generation of the vasoconstrictor peptide angiotensin (Ang) II contributes to progressive nephron injury. Thus, Ang II causes cell hypertrophy, reactive oxygen species generation, inflammation, and apoptosis in proximal tubule, which promote development of chronic tubulointerstitial fibrosis (Sachse and Wolf, 2007). To counteract RAS activation, the proximal tubule expresses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a type I membrane protein localized primarily to the apical membrane, where it cleaves the carboxy-terminal amino acid of Ang II to form the heptapeptide Ang-(1\u20137) (Warner et al., 2005; Shaltout et al., 2007). Not only does ACE2 reduce local levels of Ang II, but the generation of Ang-(1\u20137) may provide renoprotection via interaction with its Mas receptor (Santos et al., 2003), inducing downstream inhibition of Ang II signaling responses (Su et al., 2006). Thus, gene deletion of ACE2 or pharmacologic ACE2 inhibition worsens albuminuria and promotes loss of renal function in diabetic mouse models (Soler et al., 2007; Wong et al., 2007), while overexpression of ACE2 or exogenous delivery of human recombinant ACE2 to diabetic mice reduces albuminuria and kidney injury (Oudit et al., 2010; Nadarajah et al., 2012). Furthermore, studies in kidney biopsy specimens from humans with diabetic nephropathy reveal diminished expression of ACE2 in glomeruli and tubular components, suggesting that loss of ACE2 may contribute to disease progression (Reich et al., 2008).",

These studies implicate urinary ACE2 as a potential biomarker of early diabetic nephropathy. In this regard, we have demonstrated that ACE2 cleavage in mouse proximal tubular cells in conditions of high glucose involves activation of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17), a zinc-dependent protease also known as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1-converting enzyme (TACE) (Xiao et al., 2014). ADAM17 not only cleaves ACE2, but is also involved as a sheddase enzyme for other target proteins, including tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor ligands (Hinkle et al., 2004). ACE2 cleavage by ADAM17 has also been demonstrated in cultured HEK293, HK-2 proximal tubular, Huh7, COS7, and human respiratory epithelial cells (Lambert et al., 2005; Jia et al., 2009; Salem et al., 2014; Grobe et al., 2015). In diabetic Akita mice, insulin treatment decreases renal ADAM17 protein expression, associated with reduced urinary ACE2 shedding (Salem et al., 2014). In diabetic states therefore, ADAM17 activation may be responsible for increased urinary shedding of ACE2.",

Indeed, ADAM17 is considered to be the major sheddase responsive to PKC stimulation by phorbol esters (Kveiborg et al., 2011). However, in our previous studies we showed that while ADAM17 is involved in the shedding of ACE2 fragments from proximal tubular cells in conditions of high glucose, constitutive (basal) shedding of ACE2 is not affected by inhibition of ADAM17 (Xiao et al., 2014). Therefore the purpose of the present studies was to explore the mechanisms responsible for constitutive shedding of ACE2 from proximal tubule. Our results reveal that the PKC-\u03b4 isoform is a master regulator of both constitutive and high glucose-stimulated shedding of ACE2 fragments from cultured mouse proximal tubular cells.",

Indeed, in young adults with type 1 diabetes, urinary ACE2 levels are significantly elevated before development of albuminuria or other clinical complications, compared to healthy control subjects (Cherney et al., 2014). The presence of increased urinary ACE2 fragments in the absence of albuminuria, coupled with evidence that infusion of recombinant ACE2 in mice with diabetes does not increase urinary ACE2 levels (Wysocki et al., 2013), suggests that ACE2 shedding from the apical surface of tubular epithelial cells accounts for a major component of urinary ACE2 content. Significantly increased urinary ACE2 levels were reported in insulin-resistant subjects with impaired fasting glucose, glucose intolerance, or type 2 diabetes, compared to subjects with normal glucose tolerance, suggesting a close link between ACE2 shedding and glucose control (Park et al., 2013). The mechanism for enhanced urinary ACE2 shedding in diabetes appears to involve activation of the sheddase ADAM17. In cultured proximal tubular cells, ADAM17 activity is increased by exposure to high glucose (Xiao et al., 2014). Renal expression of ADAM17 is enhanced in experimental models of type 1 and 2 diabetes, and restoration of normoglycemia inhibits renal ADAM17 expression and reduces urinary ACE2 shedding (Chodavarapu et al., 2013; Salem et al., 2014). Consistent with these studies, our results indicate that exposure to high D-glucose stimulates ACE2 shedding from proximal tubular cells, an effect blocked by TAPI-1, an inhibitor of ADAM17. The data further suggest the existence of a glucose concentration threshold for activation of ADAM17 and stimulation of ACE2 shedding, since blockade of ADAM17 had no impact on ACE2 shedding under basal glucose conditions.",

            "text": "Proteolytic shedding of cell surface proteins is a well-described phenomenon involved in regulation of protein expression and may result in release of enzymatically active peptide fragments. Ectodomain cleavage of ACE2 was first described in ACE2-transfected HEK293 cells and Huh7 cells, and shedding was stimulated by phorbol esters, an effect blocked by ADAM17 inhibition (Lambert et al., 2005). In agreement with our data, ADAM17 inhibition had no effect on basal ACE2 shedding in that study. However, in cultured human airway epithelial cells, constitutive shedding of soluble ACE2 fragments was significantly decreased by inhibition of ADAM17 (Jia et al., 2009) and in COS7 cells stably expressing silencing RNA constructs against endogenous ADAM17, ACE2 shedding was reduced (Grobe et al., 2015). Gene deletion of ADAM17 in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells and fibroblasts was associated with reduced constitutive shedding of the larger of the two soluble ACE2 fragments, an effect that was rescued by reconstitution of ADAM17 in these cells (Iwata et al., 2009). These studies highlight the complexity of pathways involved in proteolytic cleavage of ACE2, which may be affected by cell-specific regulatory signals, or perhaps ambient glucose concentration.",

            "text": "In our previous studies in mouse proximal tubular cells, we demonstrated the presence of two major shed ACE2 fragments at 90 and 70 kDa, with mass spectrometric identification at amino acid positions 18\u2013706 and 18\u2013577, respectively, (Xiao et al., 2014). The appearance of each ACE2 fragment increased progressively with rising D-glucose concentration in the present studies, and constitutive shedding of both fragments was reduced by a pan-PKC inhibitor, but not by inhibitors of isoforms of PKC-\u03b1, -\u03b21, or -\u03b22, ADAM10, or 3 other MMPs. PKC isoforms are classified into three distinct groups: conventional PKC isoforms (PKC-\u03b1, -\u03b21, -\u03b22, and -\u03b2) are sensitive to diacylglycerol (DAG) and calcium, novel PKC isoforms (PKC-\u03b4, -\u03b5, -\ud835\udf03, and -\u03b7) are sensitive to DAG but insensitive to calcium, and atypical PKC isoforms (PKC-\u03b6, and-\u03b9/\u03bb) are not regulated by DAG or calcium (Parker and Murray-Rust, 2004). In the present studies, siRNA against PKC-\u03b4 caused a modest 30% reduction in its protein expression, but this induced a significant decrease in constitutive ACE2 shedding, while knockdown of PKC-\u03b5 had no effect on shedding. These results support a unique role for PKC-\u03b4 in constitutive ACE2 shedding in these cells, and are consistent with involvement of PKC-\u03b4 in constitutive or phorbol ester-stimulated shedding of the ectodomain of membrane-bound heparin-binding EGF in other studies (Izumi et al., 1998; Uchiyama et al., 2009; Kveiborg et al., 2011). In human myeloma cells, PKC-\u03b4 has also been shown to regulate phorbol ester-induced shedding of the interleukin-6 receptor (Thabard et al., 2001). Although our study did not identify the metalloprotease responsible for PKC-\u03b4-stimulated basal ACE2 shedding in proximal tubular cells, potential candidates include ADAM9 and ADAM12, which have been identified as signaling partners of PKC-\u03b4 (Izumi et al., 1998; Murphy, 2009). Moreover, since inhibition of PKC-\u03b4 also blocked high glucose-induced ACE2 shedding, it is possible that high glucose-stimulated DAG may be involved in activation of PKC-\u03b4, and downstream activation of ADAM17 in these cells. Although we did not detect changes in total cell PKC-\u03b4 expression by immunoblot with high glucose, further studies are necessary to determine if high glucose stimulates translocation of PKC-\u03b4 from the cytosolic to the plasma membrane fraction in proximal tubular cells.",

In this regard, in mice ADAM17-mediated shedding of ACE2 from brain neurons contributes to the development of neurogenic hypertension (Xia et al., 2013), suggesting that preservation of membrane-bound ACE2 may be important in counteracting local activation of the RAS. Thus, targeting PKC-\u03b4 in proximal tubular cells could represent a strategy to prevent urinary ACE2 shedding under basal or high glucose conditions, thereby maintaining membrane-bound ACE2 as a brake on the local RAS. Studies in mouse models of diabetes or proteinuria have shown that genetic deletion of PKC-\u03b4 protects renal tubular cells against apoptosis (Li et al., 2010), and in mice treated with the nephrotoxin cisplatin, gene deletion or pharmacologic blockade of PKC-\u03b4 reduces kidney injury and tubular cell apoptosis (Pabla et al., 2011). Accordingly, the potential role of reduced shedding of ACE2 from proximal tubular cells in these protective responses merits further study.",
