Nosocomial epidemics of Lassa fever are associated with higher case fatality rates up to 36 to 65% (2, 3). A seasonal outbreak of Lassa fever occurred in Nigeria in 2018 and led to more than 100 deaths, reemphasizing the threat of LASV on public health (4). There is no U.S Food and Drug Administration-approved vaccine for LASV, and the only treatment option for Lassa fever is the nucleoside analog drug ribavirin, which is most effective when given in the early stage of the disease (5). Due to its high morbidity and mortality rates, LASV is classified as a biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) agent (6) and a category A priority pathogen (7).",

            "text": "The glycoprotein (GP) of LASV forms spikes on the surface of the virion and is the sole antigen responsible for eliciting a virus-neutralizing antibody response (12). The LASV GP is synthesized as a single glycoprotein precursor (GPC) and is subsequently cleaved into three segments by host signal peptidase (13) and subtilisin-kexin-isozyme-1/site 1 protease (SKI-1/S1P) (14\u201316), producing a stable signal peptide (SSP), a receptor binding subunit (GP1), and a class I membrane fusion subunit (GP2), which together form a trimer of GP heterotrimers on the virion surface through noncovalent interactions (17\u201321). GPs of NW arenaviruses, such as JUNV and MACV, bind to transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) to facilitate entry (22), while OW arenaviruses use alpha-dystroglycan (\u03b1-DG) or neuropilin-2 (NRP2) as their cell surface receptors (23, 24). Upon delivery to the late endosome, the GP of LASV undergoes an acidic pH-induced receptor switch to the intracellular receptor LAMP1, thereby facilitating membrane fusion to release the viral ribonucleoprotein complex into the cytosol (25). Arenavirus GPs also play an important role in the budding of virus progeny by interacting with Z protein, which provides the driving force of budding (26). By recruiting the matrix protein Z and the assembled nucleocapsid to virus budding sites, GP determines the apical release of nascent LASV from polarized epithelial cells (27).",

For example, glycosylation of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) directs the proper folding and trafficking of nascent polypeptides (30) and thus modulates the viral binding ability and regulates viral release (31). Loss of glycans in HIV-1 gp120 significantly reduces virus binding to CD4 (32). LASV GP possesses 11 potential sites for N-glycan modification, 7 of which are necessary for its proteolytic cleavage (33). Despite the lack of cleavage in these latter glycosylation mutants, transport of a single glycosylation site-mutated GPC to the cell surface is not impaired, indicating that a single N-glycosylation site and proteolytic cleavage are not necessary for its intracellular trafficking (33). N-glycans in LASV GP also promote immune evasion in humans by shielding the virus from host neutralizing antibodies (34). This finding is in line with historical reports that passive serum therapy provided to cynomolgus monkeys or patients generated only limited protection efficacy (35, 36).",

            "text": "Novel therapeutic strategies to control arenavirus-induced diseases require a thorough understanding of virus-host interactions. However, little is known about the comprehensive host interactome of LASV GP. In this study, an affinity purification-coupled mass spectrometry (AP-MS) strategy was used to identify host proteins interacting with LASV GP, and the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex was highlighted. The OST complex is responsible for the N-glycosylation process in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen, where it catalytically transfers a preassembled oligosaccharide to the amide group of an asparagine residue within the consensus N-X-T/S motif of a nascent polypeptide (37). Multiple subunits of the mammalian OST complex have been reported, including defender against cell death 1 (DAD1), OST48, OST4, OSTC, ribophorin I (RPN1), ribophorin II (RPN2), TUSC3, MAGT1, STT3A, and STT3B (38\u201340). The STT3 protein is the central enzyme of the OST complex, and two isoforms exist in mammalian cells: STT3A and STT3B (37). MAGT1 and TUSC3 are specific subunits of STT3B with overlapping functions. Either MAGT1 or TUSC3 is incorporated into STT3B complexes and endows STT3B with the capability to posttranslationally glycosylate cysteine-proximal acceptor sites via their oxidoreductase activity (41). Functional studies showed that STT3A and STT3B are essential for the propagation of a recombinant arenavirus rLCMV/LASV GPC. Although most glycoproteins in host cells are efficiently modified by STT3A in a cotranslational manner (42), our study indicated that LASV GP was preferentially modified by the STT3B-OST isoform. Our study provides new insights into the host interactome of LASV GP and extends the potential targets for the development of novel therapeutics in the future.",

            "text": "To identify the host proteins interacting with LASV GP, we adopted a strategy to tag its C terminus with a Twin-Strep-tag, which is advantageous for the one-step purification of protein complexes from cell lysates (43\u201345). No significant changes of the proteolytic cleavage, glycosylation, or cell surface transport were observed between the tagged and untagged LASV GPs (Fig. 1A). Then, plasmids encoding the tagged LASV GP or vector plasmid as a control were transfected into HEK293T cells. At 48 h posttransfection, the cells were harvested, and LASV GP-associated host proteins were purified from the cell lysates by magnetic Sepharose beads coated with Strep-Tactin XT and subjected to Western blot analysis using a GP1-specific serum or anti-Strep antibody. Cleaved GP1 and GP2 were purified simultaneously from the cell lysates, together with a noncleaved form of GPC (Fig. 1B). The retention of cleaved GP1 with purified GP2 suggests that viral GP remained in the prefusion conformation during the purification process since GP1 and GP2 interact with each other through unstable noncovalent interactions, and irreversible conformation changes during the membrane fusion process lead to their disassociation (20, 25). Then, eluted proteins were trypsin digested and subjected to mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. Three independent replicate experiments were performed, and a total of 1,104 host proteins were identified from at least one independent replicate (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). Only proteins meeting the following criteria were considered as interactors of GP: (i) for proteins identified in only the GP group but not the control group, at least two peptides should be identified, or (ii) for proteins identified in both the GP and control groups, the GP versus control group peptide count ratios should be >3 (Fig. 1C). With this standard, 591 proteins were considered as valid interactors of LASV GPs. \u03b1-DG, the host receptor of OW arenaviruses (23), was detected in the GP groups with high abundance but not in the control groups (Table S1).",

We also compared our data set to a previous interactome of LCMV GP and found that 127 proteins were common (Table S1) (49). Interestingly, subunits of the OST complex were also identified in the interactome of LCMV GP, including STT3B, DDOST, RPN1, RPN2, and MAGT1.

Plasmids encoding single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting the exons of the STT3A and STT3B genes were transfected into HEK293T cells to direct genome editing. Knockouts of STT3A and STT3B were confirmed by sequencing (Fig. 4A, frameshift mutations at the corresponding sites) and Western blot analysis (Fig. 4B). To further confirm the loss of STT3A and STT3B catalytic activity, the N-glycosylation of two plasmids expressing progranulin (pGRN) or sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), which were reported to be specific N-glycosylation substrates of STT3A or STT3B, respectively, was examined (54, 55).

As shown in Fig. 5D, viral particles derived from STT3A\u2013 or STT3B\u2013 knockout cells exhibited reduced viral infectivity.

Cells infected with the rLCMV/LASV GPC virus were harvested at the indicated time points and subjected to Western blotting. In STT3A\u2013 cells, the viral GP displayed the same glycosylation pattern as that in WT cells, but the proteolytic cleavage process was hindered in the early stage of infection (24 and 36 hpi). Even so, the viral GP in STT3A\u2013 cells reached a level of maturation similar to that observed in WT cells at the late stage of infection (Fig. 6A). Knockout of STT3A did not significantly affect the glycosylation of LASV GP, which might be explained by the functionally compensatory effect executed by the STT3B isoform of OST in STT3A\u2013 cells. However, we observed an obviously hypoglycosylated form of noncleaved GPC in STT3B\u2013 cells. To exclude the possibility that the reduced molecular weight of viral GPC was caused by other modifications, such as phosphorylation, viral proteins from different cell lines were subjected to cleavage by PNGase F to remove the N-glycans. As shown in Fig. 6B, the migration of the unglycosylated form of noncleaved GPC was identical among these cells, suggesting that the differential migration of the glycosylated form of GPC in STT3B\u2013 cells was due to the distinct glycosylation status of GPC. Taken together, these data showed that LASV GP was a preferential substrate of STT3B-OST and that the full glycosylation of LASV GP requires the STT3B-OST isoform. Although STT3A was not an essential prerequisite for the glycosylation of LASV GP, loss of STT3A delayed its proteolytic cleavage.",

The expression of TUSC3 in several cultured cell lines was reported to be difficult to detect by Western blotting (53). MAGT1 was found to weakly interact with LASV GP in our MS data set, while TUSC3 was not identified (Table S1). This result could be explained by previous reports demonstrating that MAGT1 and TUSC3 easily dissociated from the canine OST during the purification process (52). To confirm that MAGT1 and TUSC3 were host interactors of LASV GP, a pCAGGs plasmid encoding 6\u00d7His-tagged MAGT1 or Flag-tagged TUSC3 was cotransfected with LASV GP into HEK293T cells.

The expression levels of both MAGT1 and TUSC3 were also decreased in STT3B\u2013 cells, indicating that their expression relies on the existence of STT3B. Although virus titers were partly reduced in MAGT1\u2013 and TUSC3\u2013 cells compared to that in WT cells (Fig. 7C, right), glycosylation of LASV GP was not significantly altered in these two cells. The inefficiency of functional knockout might be explained by the functional compensation between the two proteins. The level of TUSC3 in WT cells was almost undetectable by Western blotting, while a deficiency of MAGT1 was accompanied by obviously increased expression of TUSC3 (Fig. 7C, lanes 1 and 5). To confirm this finding, the MAGT1\u2013TUSC3\u2013 cell line was constructed (Fig. 7B). Both MAGT1\u2013\nTUSC3\u2013 cells and STT3B\u2013 cells were then infected with the rLCMV/LASV GPC virus, and we observed the same hypoglycosylation pattern of viral GP in the two cells compared to the glycosylation pattern in WT cells (Fig. 7C), indicating that MAGT1 or TUSC3 was required for full viral GP glycosylation. The virus titer derived from MAGT1\u2013TUSC3\u2013 cells was also dramatically reduced compared to that derived from WT cells (Fig. 7C). Similarly, the viral foci in MAGT1\u2013\nTUSC3\u2013 cells were notably smaller than those in WT cells (Fig. 5D), as in STT3B\u2013 cells.",

MAGT1 and TUSC3 delay the folding of nascent polypeptides by forming mixed disulfide bonds with cysteine-proximal glycosylation sequons via their CXXC site motifs and thereby facilitate access to STT3B (41). Mutation of the active site cysteines of MAGT1 or TUSC3 resulted in the hypoglycosylation of a subset of STT3B-dependent substrates (41). To test whether the glycosylation of LASV GP requires the oxidoreductase activity of MAGT1 and TUSC3, plasmids encoding MAGT1/TUSC3 or MAGT1/TUSC3 with SXXC, CXXS, or SXXS mutations were transfected into MAGT1\u2013\nTUSC3\u2013 cells to restore the glycosylation of LASV GP. As shown in Fig. 8, the expression of WT MAGT1 or WT TUSC3 was able to restore the glycosylation of LASV GPC (lanes 1, 5, and 6), whereas MAGT1 and TUSC3 with mutations of any cysteine in their CXXC site motifs failed to restore glycosylation and virus replication (lanes 2, 3, and 4).

They facilitate viral entry via binding to the virus receptor at the extracellular membrane or promoting membrane fusion in the endosome and participate in virus budding via interacting with the virus matrix protein Z to be incorporated into the envelope of nascent virions. Arenavirus GP is first translated into the ER lumen as a GPC precursor, which is mediated by SSP, and then undergoes a series of folding and modification processes along the secretory pathway to achieve a mature and functional conformation. Among these processes, N-glycosylation in the ER lumen is the most dominant modification of LASV GP. We systematically identified the host interactors of LASV GP using the AP-MS approach. This methodology enables us to gain detailed insights into the host machinery involved in stages of LASV GP synthesis, processing, and transport through the secretory pathway. Proteomic analysis identified multiple proteins of the OST complex as interactors of LASV GP. This was consistent with a previous interactome of LCMV GP (Table S1), although their roles were not examined (49). The congruence between the interactomes of LASV and LCMV GPs highlights the reliability of these observations and prompted us to investigate the conserved roles of the OST complex in arenaviruses.",

Virions released from STT3A\u2013 and STT3B\u2013 cells showed reduced incorporation of GPs into virion particles and a partly reduced binding ability to normal permissive cells (Fig. 6E). NGI-1, a small-molecule OST inhibitor, was able to strongly inhibit virus propagation (Fig. 9A) by affecting virus infectivity (Fig. 9B) without resulting in significant cytotoxicity. Thus, pharmacological inhibition of the host OST complex by NGI-1 may provide a useful treatment option to efficiently inhibit virus spread and reduce the fatality rate caused by Lassa fever in the future.",

            "text": "The relative importance of the STT3B isoform of OST in LASV infection may be related to the distinct enzymatic mechanisms of the two isoforms. In mammalian cells, the OST complex is a hetero-oligomeric complex consisting of a catalytically active subunit with several noncatalytic auxiliary subunits (39). The additional components either play a structural role to support the structural stability and enzymatic activity of the OST complex or modulate the N-glycosylation efficiency for certain precursors (65, 66). STT3A and STT3B arose from the same ancestral STT3 gene during the evolution of multicellular eukaryotes and share a 59% amino acid sequence identity (39). Both STT3A and STT3B are widely expressed in human tissues, and the full glycosylation of polypeptides involves the cooperation of the two isoforms. The STT3A-OST isoform is primarily responsible for the cotranslational modification of sequons as nascent polypeptide chains enter the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) through direct interaction with the Sec61 translocon complex (51, 67, 68). Most acceptor sites in host glycoproteins are modified by the cotranslational pathway, and depletion of STT3A by siRNA upregulates the level of the luminal ER chaperone BiP and induces the unfolded protein response in response to the hypoglycosylation of host proteins. Unlike STT3A-OST, the STT3B-OST isoform is less competent for the cotranslational modification and efficiently mediates posttranslational modification of glycosylation sites that are skipped by STT3A after nascent polypeptides enter the ER lumen (51). Here, no significant changes in GP molecular weight were observed in STT3A\u2013 cells, implying that the glycosylation acceptor sites for STT3A may also be targeted by STT3B, whereas in STT3B\u2013 cells, the glycosylation acceptor site/sites for STT3B may not be fully rescued by STT3A; thus, the reduction in GP molecular weight was observed, and the GP maturation process and virion infectivity were impaired significantly. These results suggested the existence of glycosylation sites in viral GPC that are prone to being skipped by STT3A-OST and designated to be posttranslationally modified by STT3B-OST. MAGT1 and TUSC3 are specific subunits of STT3B-OST that have overlapping functions. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of either MAGTI or TUSC3 did not reduce the glycosylation of LASV GP, whereas knockout of both led to the same hypoglycosylation pattern as that observed in STT3B\u2013 cells, indicating that MAGT1 and TUSC3 exhibit compensatory functions for the glycosylation of LASV GP (Fig. 7B). Site-directed mutagenesis further revealed that the oxidoreductase CXXC active site motif of MAGT1 or TUSC3 was essential for the glycosylation of LASV GP (Fig. 8). This finding provided novel details regarding the virus glycosylation process in the ER lumen.",

Although STT3A and STT3B show tissue-specific expression, this phenomenon likely does not link the preferential requirement for the STT3B-OST isoform with the tissue tropism of virus infection in vivo, since STT3A was also here demonstrated to be a host prerequisite for virus propagation by indirectly influencing the infectivity of progeny viruses.",

            "text": "The OST complex utilizes dolichol-linked oligosaccharides (OS-PP-Dol) as donor substrates for the N-linked glycosylation of asparagine residues in the N-X-T/S consensus sites of newly synthesized proteins (69). The fully assembled OS-PP-Dol is Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-PP-Dol, which is assembled on the cytoplasmic face of the RER by glycosyltransferases that mediate the transfer of single glycosyl residues onto the dolichol phosphate step by step (70). Assembly intermediates of OS-PP-Dol with different lengths (Glc0\u20132Man0\u20139GlcNAc2-PP-Dol) can also serve as the donor substrate for the OST complex in vivo and in vitro (71, 72). It was reported that STT3A and STT3B assembled into different OST complexes with a distinct discrimination ability to select Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-PP-Dol over its assembly intermediate Man9GlcNAc2-PP-Dol, which lacks the terminal glucose residue as the oligosaccharide donor substrate for N-glycosylation (52). The STT3B-OST complex is substantially more active and shows a reduced ability to discriminate different oligosaccharide structures; in contract, the STT3A-OST complex is extremely selective and preferentially glycosylates nascent proteins with the fully assembled Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-PP-Dol (52). It is interesting to associate this distinct substrate-selective characteristic of STT3A and STT3B with the recently reported glycan heterogeneity of LASV GP. Analysis of the LASV glycome composition by hydrophilic interaction chromatography ultraperformance liquid chromatography revealed that the virus possesses an abundance of underprocessed oligomannose-type glycans, which form punctuated clusters to shield the proteinous surface from the humoral immune response (73). It remains unknown whether the site-specific heterogeneity of virion surface glycans has any relevance to the preferential utilization of host OST isoforms by viruses during the glycosylation process. Further studies are needed to deeply elucidate the physiological significance of this host glycosylation strategy utilized by arenaviruses.",

For STT3A and STT3B, two target sequences were selected for each gene (STT3A-target-1, TATATCTCCCGATCTGTGGC; STT3A-target-2, ACAGACATTCCGAATGTCGA; STT3B-target-1, GACGACTTGTGCTTGCTCTC; STT3B-target-2, CGTGGATGATGCTTTCGAAG). For MAGT1 and TUSC3, one target sequence was selected (MAGT1-target-1, ATAACGGAGTAATTTCTCGG; TUSC3-target-1, CGCTCAATCTTCCGAATGAA). A pair of partially cDNA oligonucleotides encoding each sgRNA sequence was synthesized and ligated into a pSpCas9(BB)-2A-Puro plasmid (PX459; Addgene, catalog no. 62988), which bears both the Cas9 gene, and the sgRNA scaffold backbone containing an oligonucleotide cloning site. Construction of the plasmids was performed according to a standard target sequence cloning protocol involving an annealing step and a ligation reaction (75). Briefly, the DNA oligonucleotide pairs encoding the 20-nucleotide sgRNA were 5\u2032 phosphorylated by T4 polynucleotide kinase (NEB) and annealed in a thermocycler with the following parameters: 37\u00b0C for 30 min, 95\u00b0C for 5 min, and cooling to 25\u00b0C at 5\u00b0C min\u22121.

Plasmids encoding Cas9 and each sgRNA were isolated and transfected into HEK293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) to direct genome editing. The transfected cells were selected by incubating with 2 \u03bcg/ml puromycin for 72 h, and then isogenic cell lines were isolated by serial dilutions and allowed to expand for 2 to 3 weeks. Genomic DNA from the isogenic cell lines was extracted by using a TIANamp genomic DNA kit (DP304; Tiangen Biotech). PCR amplification of the modified regions was defined by Sanger sequencing using specific genomic cleavage detection primers, and cell lines exhibiting frameshift mutations at the corresponding sites were selected and further confirmed by Western blotting. MAGT1 and TUSC3 double-knockout cells (MAGT1\u2013\nTUSC3\u2013) were constructed by transfecting the TUSC3-sgRNA plasmid into MAGT1\u2013 cells to direct a second editing event.

(E) Viral foci were observed by fluorescence microscopy at different time points in cells infected with the rLCMV (NP-P2A-GFP)/LASV GPC virus. The foci in STT3A\u2013 and STT3B\u2013 cells were notably smaller than those in WT cells. All of the micrographs displayed here were collected at the same scale (the length of the red bar represents 100 \u03bcm) and are representatives of several images.",

(A) Expression and glycosylation profiles of LASV GP in STT3A\u2013, STT3B\u2013 cells and WT cells. Cells infected with the rLCMV/LASV GPC virus at an MOI of 0.01 were harvested at the indicated time points and subjected to Western blot analysis with GP2-specific serum. Viral NP was also detected by a specific antiserum, serving as an internal control to reflect the replication level of the virus. The cleavage rates of tagged and untagged GP2 are shown above as determined by densitometric quantification. (B) The reduced molecular weight of viral GP in STT3B\u2013 cells was due to a deficiency in glycans. Viral proteins from different cell lines were subjected to cleavage by PNGase F and Western blot analysis with GP2-specific serum. Viral NP was also detected. (C) Quantitation of viral glycoprotein incorporated into viral particles. Viral particles (supernatant) derived from different cell lines at 48 hpi were collected by ultracentrifugation and screened for viral proteins (GP1, GP2, and NP) by Western blotting. (D) The levels of incorporated proteins were determined by the band intensities, and the ratios of viral GP2 versus viral NP were calculated as an indicator of the level of viral glycoproteins incorporated into a single viral particle. SDs are not shown because viral particles were derived from one individual preparation. In panels A to C, GAPDH was also detected as a loading control for each lane. (E) The cell binding ability of RNA-normalized viruses derived from different cell lines to normal BHK-21 cells was measured by qRT-PCR and normalized to the GAPDH mRNA level.
