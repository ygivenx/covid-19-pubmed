Some mass gatherings such as outdoor sporting events may involve limited social mixing and are held in settings with ample ventilation. Other mass gatherings, however, can involve significant social mixing over several days such as professional conferences and music festivals [1\u20134]. Intensely crowded settings can lead to high secondary attack rates even when a circulating pathogen has a relatively low transmission probability [1\u20134]. Travelers to mass gatherings can not only introduce an infectious disease to a previously unaffected area, but can also amplify transmission at the gathering and further disseminate transmission following their return home. This was recently demonstrated by the propagation of the first wave of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic (pdm09H1N1) following a large Easter holiday gathering in Iztapalapa, Mexico [6]. Similar mass gatherings have been linked to the propagation of the Great Pandemic in 1918 and the Asian Flu Pandemic in 1957 [7\u20138].",

We applied this definition in our literature review but also included camp sessions of at least 100 participants because the cumulative aggregation of participants over the camp season can easily exceed 1,000 persons. Because NORS does not include a specific field for mass gatherings, we analyzed data from the NORS database for outbreaks involving person-to-person transmission and transmission at camps, conferences, banquets, sporting events, and religious locations. Information on the setting for outbreaks involving other modes of transmission (e.g. water-borne) is not routinely reported to NORS. For all reported outbreaks, we used the number of persons exposed to approximate size of the mass gathering. We deferred to the author\u2019s definition of outbreak in our literature review. Disease events reported to NORS were assumed to meet CDC\u2019s outbreak definitions [13].",

At a minimum, each article included in our final analysis described the following: 1) purpose of gathering, 2) month and year of gathering, 3) location or venue type (indoor or outdoor), 4) type of syndrome or infectious disease outbreak, 5) number of confirmed or probable cases, 6) information on the index case(s), and 7) possible cause(s) of the outbreak.

All project types were eligible for inclusion including outbreak investigation reports, case series, cross-sectional surveys, case-control studies, and intervention studies. No additional quality criteria for article inclusion were applied due to the variability in the study types [15].

The largest outbreak occurred at an agricultural fair in Indiana and resulted in 73 confirmed and probable cases. In this, as well as other H3N2v outbreaks, the majority of case-patients reported close contact with swine at the agricultural fairs, though additional but limited secondary person-to-person transmission was detected [33\u201336]. Children and adolescents less than 18 years of age represented the largest percentage of case-patients (92%) during these outbreaks [36]. Three outbreaks of Influenza A H1N1 (3SIV) occurred at agricultural fairs in 2007 in Ohio, Illinois, and Michigan [20\u201321]. The swine barn housed 235 pigs belonging to 133 exhibitors and was closed as a result of the outbreak in Ohio [20].

The size of most camp sessions was small, ranging between 100 to 600 campers and staff. Nineteen (76%) of the 25 Influenza A H1N1 (pdm09H1N1) outbreaks were reported from an online survey of 2009 summer camp participants in Maine [25]. In this survey, camp-related outbreaks (defined as having at least three confirmed cases of pdm09H1N1) were statistically associated with having both a larger number of camp participants per session and a larger number of campers per cabin. The six other camp-related pdm09H1N1 outbreaks occurred in North Carolina (n = 3) [22\u201323, 27\u201328], Louisiana (n = 1) [24], Alabama (n = 1) [26], and Washington State (n = 1) [29]. One outbreak involved 119 cases occurring across two clusters in a multi-camp setting at a North Carolina university with more than 7,900 participants [32\u201333]. The authors found that this transmission occurred rapidly during academic camps and was likely due to close and frequent contact during classroom time and social mixing outside of class. Two camps (the university camp in North Carolina [27\u201328] and a camp for children with hematological and oncological conditions in Louisiana [24]) closed early due to the large number of participants presenting influenza-like-illness (ILI).",

The second occurred in 2009 and caused 25 cases among 400 campers and staff [30\u201331]. In both outbreaks, transmission was associated with prolonged close contact in communal housing and camp activities despite a two-dose MMR vaccination coverage > 85% among school-aged campers. A delay in mumps diagnosis also likely contributed to the 2007 outbreak. During the 2007 outbreak, camp activities were either cancelled or postponed [16\u201317]. These outbreaks resulted in substantial community transmission when campers returned home\u2014more than 1,500 community cases (including 19 hospitalizations) occurred in New York and New Jersey in 2009 [30\u201331].",

Compared to other settings, influenza transmission among children and teenagers is more likely to occur within households, school classes, peer groups, and sports teams [42\u201344]\u2014all of these social mixing opportunities are prominent at summer camps. Children and adolescents can easily have more than 20 close contacts with other children lasting 5 minutes of more during a typical school day [45]. Both the number and duration of close contacts could be higher in residential camps. This is supported by the outbreaks reported from Maine where the camp size and the number of campers per cabin were associated with influenza outbreaks [25]. Though respiratory disease transmission can occur at summer camps, influenza transmission during the summer (in the United States) outside a pandemic is uncommon; pdm09HIN1 was circulating since early spring and was involved a number of school-based outbreaks in states reporting camp-related influenza outbreaks in summer 2009. No respiratory illnesses were detected from a syndromic surveillance system implemented at a large school-aged summer camp in Virginia in 2005 [40].",

Prior to 2011\u20132012, human Influenza A (SIV) infections were rare; however, the H3N2v outbreaks resulted from the reassortment of swine Influenza A H3N2 virus and Influenza A pdm09H1N1 in the swine population, raising concerns about sustained human-to-human transmission and increased risk in the pediatric population [46]. Though only minimal human-to-human transmission of H3N2v was detected, close and repeated contact between humans and livestock at the estimated 2,380 agricultural fairs (personal communication: Marla J. Calico, International Association of Fairs and Exhibitions) that take place each year in the United States could create future opportunities for zoonotic transmission of influenza viruses as well as other possible respiratory infections [34, 36]. The syndromic surveillance system using emergency department chief complaint data was analyzed to detect the initial H3N2v outbreak in Indiana (personal communication: Shawn Richards, Indiana State Department of Health). This highlights the usefulness of such systems to rapidly detect temporal or spatial clusters of unusual health events associated with fairs and other mass gatherings.",

As recommended in the articles, camp and sporting event organizers should verify immunization histories of all registered participants and team members [17, 31]. This is particularly important for measles, which is highly contagious through aerosolized viral particles; other control and prevention measures are likely to be ineffective. Organizers should also obtain information on disease transmission in the home countries of participants. These pre-gathering activities can help with the early case detection and outbreak prevention. The 2007 mumps outbreak, for example, was attributed to the international importation of mumps in a staff member followed by the delayed recognition of suspected mumps cases and prolonged and close contact between campers in communal housing [16\u201317].",

This is consistent with previous assessments of international mass gatherings such as the Olympics that detected only marginal increases above baseline in the incidence of all infectious diseases including influenza with infections primarily limited to competitors and staff [5, 47]. Though we assume that all mass gatherings could increase the transmission of respiratory diseases, this may not be the case for diseases transmitted through infectious droplets where the probability of close and adequate contact (i.e., < 6 feet for influenza) with an infectious person may be too low for efficient transmission [49]. Even at large mass gatherings involving out-of-town visitors such as the May 2009 convocation speech in Arizona (during which no respiratory disease outbreaks were detected) [37], most participants likely stayed at hotels or at other low-density accommodations rather than in cabins or at campgrounds [5, 49]. In addition, many of these gatherings have well organized and pre-assigned seating. This could further reduce the \u2018crowdedness\u2019 and likelihood of close and prolonged contact with infectious persons [5]. This can be contrasted to the type of communal housing and social mixing associated with camp outbreaks described here. Variability in susceptibility among attendees as well as in the timing of the gathering in relation to local respiratory disease activity also likely play a role in transmission [9].",

We used a broad database search criteria to minimize this limitation and identify all possible articles describing mass gathering-related respiratory disease outbreaks. Second, some outbreaks may not be identified as outbreaks. Active or passive surveillance likely influences the number of infectious respiratory disease outbreaks identified and reported. For example, active surveillance for variants of influenza viruses at fairs following the initial H3N2v outbreak in 2011 could have increased the number of outbreaks detected from this setting. In addition, while multiday residential-based mass gatherings can facilitate transmission, these settings may also help identify cases and an emerging outbreak through close monitoring of known participants. In non-residential settings, other non-disease related factors including crowd mood, age, weather, and alcohol and drug use could influence the use of illness-related medical services. These factors could further increase the variability of health event reporting [14]. Third, some respiratory diseases with longer incubation periods and many subclinical infections are unlikely to be identified during the mass gathering. Symptoms could appear once the participants have returned home and are then rarely linked or reported to the appropriate surveillance system [9, 49].",

In Brazil, for example, a smart phone application was developed allowing persons attending the 2014 FIFA World Cup to provide information on their daily health status. This information was automatically aggregated into reports that were reviewed daily to identify potential infectious disease clusters or outbreaks [51]. Monitoring social media including Twitter was used to identify potential health issues and communicate accurate information about disease transmission during the 2012 London Olympics [52]. These approaches can complement other surveillance systems such as collection and analysis of syndromic event data from emergency department visits or onsite medical clinics [37]. Integration of these various platforms through a web-based system could allow public health officials to rapidly detect unusual disease activity [10, 53] even at smaller mass gatherings [54\u201355]. Recent research has also focused on the use of radio frequency identification devices [56\u201357] as well as video analysis technology [58] to capture social mixing and contact patterns at mass gatherings. These contact data can be used to simulate or model the transmission of various infectious disease pathogens including pandemic influenza. Simulations or mathematical models can help describe the risk of potential outbreaks and highlight where and when enhanced disease transmission mitigation at mass gatherings should be considered.",
