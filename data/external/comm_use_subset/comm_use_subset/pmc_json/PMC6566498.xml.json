During the course of an EID event, accident and emergency departments (AEDs) take on a wider role by actively participating in the planning for and response to public health threats from EIDs on top of continuing to manage urgent illnesses and injuries. Apart from the distinguishing feature of emergency care in offering prompt intervention to patients in critical condition, the public health function of AEDs in assessing, monitoring and promoting the health of community members is considered a longstanding priority in managing epidemics (Menchine, Zhou, Lotfipour, & Chakravarthy, 2016). The extended nature of emergency services in an EID event requires emergency nurses to demonstrate not only the capability to offer emergency care services to the public but also the capacity to participate in public health responses and combat a large-scale public health emergency.",

They have been shown to be non-compliant with guidelines and protocols intended to prevent the spread of EIDs, such as adherence to hand hygiene practices (Muller, Carter, Siddiqui, & Larson, 2015) and personal protective equipment (PPE) usage (Baduge, Moss, & Morphet, 2017). Studies have revealed that limitations in time and resources were the major cause of non-compliance with recommended practices (Lam, Kwong, Hung, & Pang, 2016; Muller et al., 2015). Interestingly, it has also been reported that the issue of emergency nurses\u2019 non-compliance with guidelines could still occur, regardless of the availability of sufficient resources (Lam & Hung, 2013). This suggests the existence of other contextual factors that affect the decision about whether to conform to a protocol. Studies have also been conducted to identify factors affecting the practices of healthcare workers in the course of outbreak management. These studies showcase the important role of institutions in offering training, guidance and incentives to frontline staff (Craig et al., 2018; Greenberg et al., 2019). What is less clear is which factors in the emergency care setting adversely affect the ability of emergency nurses to engage in an EID outbreak response. This lack of knowledge could lead to difficulties in devising appropriate strategies to address non-compliance and could directly affect the role of emergency nurses in EID management. Understanding emergency nurses\u2019 experiences and perceptions of disease management during epidemic events might help identify and address the barriers to their involvement in EID management. The goal of this study was to identify and explore the contextual factors that inhibited the ability of emergency nurses to perform outbreak-response-related duties according to established protocols (Lam, Kwong, Hung, & Pang, 2016; Muller et al., 2015).",

The goal of a qualitative descriptive study is to obtain knowledge of the experiences, events and interactions of a phenomenon from the viewpoint of the insiders (Bradshaw et al., 2017).

A participant described her understanding of the reasons behind the increased patient attendance as follows:\n\u2018While there was an announcement of an EID or there was an outbreak of a new disease, patient attendance would suddenly increase. People just rushed to the AED for a check-up, for fear they had contracted the new disease. They were so nervous that many of them just showed up with very mild symptoms.\u2019 (P17)",

If there is an infectious patient occupying the room, we would have less resuscitation room for patients in critical condition.

These studies have highlighted the various challenging issues facing nurses during EID outbreaks (Kim, 2018; McMullan, Brown, & O\u2019Sullivan, 2016). The identified issues often pertained to workplace susceptibility and resource constraints, which nurses are used to encountering and handling in their everyday practice. Furthermore, the changes and uncertainties in the emergency care setting during an epidemic worsen those issues and create unique challenges and obstacles to nursing practices. Indeed, change and uncertainty, which are inherent to the nature of the healthcare industry, are inevitable challenges facing nurses and other healthcare workers, and they create hesitation and fear and that affects the performance and quality of care delivery (Arrowsmith, Lau\u2010Walker, Norman, & Maben, 2016). During an epidemic event, the healthcare environment is often intertwined with urgency, uncertainty and change, and this scenario requires marked effort from workers to seamlessly maintain healthcare system operations (Cranley, Doran, Tourangeau, Kushniruk, & Nagle, 2012). Similar results have also been reported in the literature, highlighting the hardships and struggles from bouts of uncertainty and volatility that nurses must endure as the first-line responders under disastrous circumstances (Lam, Kwong, Hung, Pang, & Chiang, 2018). These findings suggest that nurses are situated in an unsettled circumstance during their participation in EID management.",

On the other hand, this sense of crisis has also fostered nurses\u2019 awareness of the severity of the disease situation, which enhanced their vigilance against EIDs. The literature suggests that when healthcare workers underestimate the severity of a public health event, it could result in laxness in handling any issues (Dionne, Desjardins, Lebeau, Messier, & Dascal, 2018). These findings shed light on the importance of maintaining an optimal level of risk perception and crisis awareness among nurses during an EID event to promote their alertness and prudence at work without triggering panic.",

            "text": "During the management of a public health event, assistance and support from hospital administration are some of the most important determinants of the preparedness and competence of the nursing workforce and workers in other healthcare disciplines. The findings show that nurses expected to encounter unanticipated challenges when responding to EID events, such as staffing shortages and inadequate facilities, and that the adverse effects on their practice can only be mitigated by institutional action. In the absence of adequate support and action from hospitals, the quality of healthcare delivery and nurses\u2019 incentives and intentions to work could be hampered (Filice et al., 2013). Because the findings highlighted some major challenges and constraints emergency nurses encountered during epidemic events, hospitals should adapt and accentuate strategies for supporting nurses and other outbreak responders to better equip them to handle pressing needs on the frontline.",

The challenging situations described by the emergency nurses in the findings are largely in line with those of previous studies on nurses from other care settings. To effectively optimise resource allocation during a public health emergency, resource triage can be implemented. Such a triage procedure could ensure the meticulous identification of priorities in maintaining core healthcare services. The cancelation or postponement of elective procedures could be another option for consideration. Through this approach of re-prioritising resource allocation, the surge capacity of hospitals during major EID events could be increased to meet expanded demand for healthcare services by the public. The standard of nursing practice could also be maintained with the sufficient provision of human resources and equipment.",

These contextual barriers in the everyday practices of emergency care delivery were the fundamental antecedents that compelled emergency nurses to engage in suboptimal practices. The findings highlight on the importance of hospitals and emergency departments in addressing the technical problems and adaptive challenges facing emergency nurses amid epidemic events.",
