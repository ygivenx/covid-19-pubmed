Results from bibliometric analysis can not only provide objective information about the quantity and quality of scientific research, but also facilitate health policy decisions, allocation of the health resources and further innovative studies [3,4,5]. MERS has aroused much public concern and become a research focus for scientists throughout the world in recent years [6]. Such a concern warrants bibliometric studies on the MERS research, but none are available so far. To address such a need, we designed and performed this bibliometric study on the PubMed literature concerning MERS to map out research productivity in terms of journals, countries, organizations and individuals.",

The results could also be biased by not exploring databases in other languages, for example Arabic, the official language of Saudi Arabia, where the most cases of MERS were reported. Second, due to the study design and time restriction, the latest articles published after August 2015 have not yet been considered in this study and this may bias the results. Third, the search terms may have missed early articles without the acronym MERS when the virus had not yet been named. However, since there are very few of those articles and most of them are descriptive studies, results could be slightly biased. Fourth, with current methodology, each article carries a single first-corresponding author, but a lot of papers involve cooperation between countries. This may underestimate the number of the articles for some countries. Fifth, the category of basic medical sciences and clinical studies can be further divided up into at least two groups, and this can bias the results to some extent.",
