Malaria constitutes a major health problem and is closely associated with socioeconomic burden in many temperate and most tropical countries. The malaria situation of Korea peninsula is also not different from other countries. It reemerged in the early 1990s after two decade-long absence. Following government intervention, reported cases of malaria decreased over the course of several years. However, it is unlikely that malaria has been completely eradicated from Korea; not only is there a steady influx of travelers and workers from countries where malaria is endemic, but the appearance of failed treatment cases is also possible. Therefore, vaccine development is needed for the eradication of vivax malaria in Korea.",

It is associated with dormant liver stage infections that can reactivate weeks to months after primary infection and symptomatic disease [3-7].",

The MSP-1 gene encodes a 180 to 230 kDa glycoprotein that is a major merozoite surface protein in several Plasmodium species. PvMSP-1 has been thoroughly investigated as a vaccine candidate against the asexual blood stage of malaria [8-11]. PvCSP is a sporozoite stage surface antigen. It consists of 18 to 20 short repeated sequences flanked by pre-repeat and post-repeat areas. Across global isolates, the nine amino acid tandem repeats were primarily GDRA(D/A)GQPA for the VK210 subtype [12] and GNGA(A/G)GQAA for the VK247 subtype [13]. CSPs from Korean P. vivax isolates were also shown to contain the nine amino acid tandem repeat sequences [14-16]. The region containing the tandem repeats was cloned to make a recombinant protein that has subsequently been used for malaria diagnosis in patients, sero-epidemiological investigations, and the production of monoclonal antibodies. Additionally, this recombinant protein was reported to be a viable vaccine candidate when assessed for immunogenicity [17-19].",

To acquire cotyledon explants, seeds were germinated in a culture room at 25\u00b0C in a photoperiod of 16 h light/8 h dark for 4 days with the light supplied by cool-white daylight fluorescent lights. The seeding medium contained 0.2% Murashige and Skoog medium with Gamborg vitamin B5 (MSB5) salts, 1% w/v sucrose, 0.05% 2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid (MES), and 0.6% plant agar. Cotyledon explants excised from in vitro grown seedlings were cut into 0.5 to1 cm pieces, and the apical shoot tip was removed. Agrobacterium tumefaciens used for infection and co-cultivation; it was grown in Yeast Extract Peptone (YEP) media (0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% peptone, and 0.5% sucrose, pH 7.2) with kanamycin overnight to an optical density of 1.0 at 600 nm. Cotyledons were immersed in the infection media (37 ml liquid infection medium consisting of 0.4% MSB5 salts, 2% sucrose, 1 \u03bcg/ml of 2,4-D, 2 ml dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and a 10 ml pellet of Agrobacterium culture) and incubated for 20 min [32]. Excess bacterial culture was removed by blotting with filter paper and the cotyledons were co-cultivated on filter paper-covered co-culture medium (0.05% MES and 0.6% plant agar in infection medium) for two days. Plates were then transferred to dark conditions at 4\u00b0C for 2 days. The cotyledons were placed on a selection medium consisting of 0.4% MSB5 salts, 3% w/v sucrose, 0.05% MES, 2 \u03bcg/ml 6-benzylaminopurine (BA), 0.01 \u03bcg/ml \u03b1-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA), and 0.6% plant agar supplemented with 15 \u03bcg/ml kanamycin for selective pressure, 500 \u03bcg/ml carbenicillin to eliminate the Agrobacterium and 2 \u03bcg/ml silver nitrate to prevent cell necrosis. The calluses in the selection medium were incubated at 25\u00b0C and then transferred to fresh medium every two weeks. The same selection medium was used for shoot regeneration medium. From GUS-positive explants, regenerated shoots that had elongated to 2 to 3 cm in length were transferred to rooting medium. Approximately 6 weeks later, green shoots of approximately 5 to 6 cm in length were isolated and placed in Magenta boxes (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) containing rooting medium and carbenicillin and kanamycin at the same concentrations as shoot regeneration medium. Root initiation was observed within two to three weeks, and roots developed into mature plants within one month.",

The strategy of gene construction was the first challenge in making an MLC chimeric recombinant protein for a multistage combination vaccine directed against both merozoite and sporozoite forms. B. napus was selected for the expression of an MLC chimeric recombinant gene. The expression and purification of recombinant proteins in plants has several advantages compared to other commercial expression systems. First, plant-based vaccines do not contain endotoxin, which is produced during bacterial culture and purification steps. Additionally, the biomass produced in plants is greater than other systems, thereby reducing the cost and allowing rapid industrialization and manufacturing [22,23]. Also, if edible plants are utilized, plant-based vaccines can be eaten raw without modification in factories. Finally, expression of candidate vaccine proteins in plants allows for the complete synthesis of target antigens that are able to induce an active immune response in animals. In light of these advantages, transgenic plants are now being generated and investigated for use in the production of vaccines against various human pathogens [20,21,24,26].",

The modified sequence has 75.6% nucleotide sequence homology and 100% amino acid sequence homology compared to the original ICB10 sequence from the P. vivax Belem isolate; further, it was successfully expressed in B. napus (Figure 4B, lane 2). Purified MLC chimeric recombinant protein reacted well with the sera of vivax malaria patients (Figure 5). Therefore, this reagent could be used to sero-diagnose patient with vivax malaria. Although not all of the mice orally immunized with 1 g MLC chimeric recombinant protein produced antigen-specific antibodies, MLC chimeric recombinant protein-specific IgG1 antibodies were detected in two (40%) of the five mice (Figure 6). These observations indicate that the MLC chimeric recombinant protein has the possibility to trigger Th-2 immune responses. Il-12(p40), TNF, and IFN-\u03b3 were detected in the spleens of BALB/c mice orally immunized with the MLC chimeric recombinant protein (Figure 7).

Additionally, because of the convenience of ingesting this plant, populations can be given the vaccine as part of a routine diet. This strategy will decrease the cost of vaccination against malaria in developing countries. Additionally, trials for developing edible plant vaccines will contribute to a basic understanding of the development of vivax malaria vaccines.
