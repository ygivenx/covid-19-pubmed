            "text": "Influenza virus can cause acute and severe respiratory diseases. According to the WHO, about 3\u20135 million people are severely infected with influenza virus, and among those, 290,000\u2013650,000 people die annually (World Health Organization [WHO], 2017). Compared to most seasonal influenza viruses, pandemic influenza viruses prefer to infect lower respiratory airways and often cause severe lung disease, such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Kim et al., 2002). The lower respiratory tract consists of the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli. Alveoli are the ends of the respiratory tree and act as the basic units of ventilation of the lung. The alveoli consist of an epithelial layer for gas exchange, in which two types of cells, alveolar type-I pneumocytes (AT-I) and type-II pneumocytes (AT-II), are there. AT-I is responsible for gas exchange, whereas AT-II maintains surface tension of alveolus through secretion of surfactant proteins, such as SP-A, SP-B, SP-C, and SP-D (Whitsett and Alenghat, 2015). Previous studies have shown that human AT-I (Chan et al., 2009; Yu et al., 2011), human AT-II (Chan et al., 2005), murine AT-I (Kebaabetswe et al., 2013; Rosenberger et al., 2014), and murine AT-II (Kebaabetswe et al., 2013) can be infected by influenza A viruses. High-level expression of cytokines, such as interferon (IFN)-\u03b2, interleukin (IL)-6, or IL-1\u03b2, and chemokines, like RANTES, IFN-\u03b3-induced protein 10 (IP-10), and macrophage inflammatory protein 1\u03b2 (MIP-1\u03b2), was reported in infected AT-I and AT-II cells. However, little information for the outcomes of lung stem/progenitor cells by the infection of influenza virus A has been reported.",

            "text": "Upon influenza virus infection, the adult stem/precursor cells can proliferate and differentiate into various downstream cells to repair the damage in lung and even function as immune regulators (Park et al., 2010; Maul et al., 2011; Volckaert and De Langhe, 2014; Branchfield et al., 2016). Among the many different pulmonary stem/progenitor cells (PSCs) in the respiratory system, AT-II (Barkauskas et al., 2013) and bronchioalveolar stem cells (BASC) (Kim et al., 2005) have been reported as potential adult lung stem/progenitor cells. Recent studies in the mouse model demonstrated that influenza virus infection could induce the migration and differentiation of the upper respiratory tract\u2019s stem/progenitor epithelial cells to compensate for damage in the lower respiratory tract (Kumar et al., 2011; Zuo et al., 2015). Another study also found that club cells could differentiate into AT-I and AT-II to repair impaired alveolar regions after virus infection (Zheng et al., 2012). To investigate the importance of pulmonary stem/precursor cells in influenza virus infection, adult PSCs have been isolated from different animal models. Chicken lung mesenchymal stromal cells have been shown to be infected by avian H9N5 and H1N1 influenza strain (Khatri et al., 2010). Moreover, the Oct4+ swine stem/progenitor lung epithelial cells could be infected by human, swine, and avian influenza viruses (Khatri et al., 2012). In C57BL/6 mice, influenza virus was identified to block the self-renewal of pulmonary epithelial stem/progenitor cells through blockage of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2b (Fgfr2b) signaling pathway (Quantius et al., 2016). Therefore, via these findings, we hypothesized that pulmonary stem/progenitor epithelial cells may not only be responsible for repair of lung tissues but also be one of the important target cells for influenza virus infection.",

            "text": "In this study, we aimed to demonstrate the infection of influenza virus to PSCs and try to establish the mouse pulmonary stem/progenitor epithelial cell lines to characterize the influences of influenza virus infection in pulmonary stem/progenitor epithelial cells. Previously, we have identified one rare population of mouse pulmonary stem/progenitor cells (named mPSCs) (Ling et al., 2006). The mPSCs could proliferate to form epithelial cell colonies accompanied by stroma cells cocultured in a serum-free culture condition and expressed in low level of pluripotent transcriptional factors (e.g., Oct4, Sox-2, and Nanog) and could differentiate into type-I pneumocytes in vitro (Ling et al., 2006, 2014). Our studies also demonstrated that mPSCs expressed a specific cellular surface marker, coxsackievirus/adenovirus receptor (CAR), which could be applied as a selective marker to isolate mPSCs (CAR+/mPSCs) from the culture for pure population by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) technique (Ling et al., 2014). In this study, we first demonstrated that mPSCs were also susceptible to influenza virus infection and then immortalized CAR+/mPSCs (mPSCsOct4+ cell lines: G2L, E3L, and G4L clones) through overexpression of the pluripotent transcription factor, Oct-4, by retroviruses. The mPSCsOct4+ cell lines were also susceptible to infections of the mouse-adapted influenza virus PR8 strain, seasonal H1N1, pandemic H1N1, and H7N9 influenza A viruses, with a lower efficiency of virus replication, which could be possibly due to impaired vRNA replication in mPSCsOct4+ and irregular distribution of nucleoprotein (NP) proteins during viral replication. Finally, elevated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, IL-12p40p70, monocyte chemotactic protein 5 (MCP5), stem cell factor (SCF), soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor I (sTNFRI), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was detected in PR8-infected cells at 12 h post infection (hpi) compared to mock cells. Our results implicated that mPSCs were susceptible to influenza virus infection and could trigger host defense through pro-inflammatory cytokines releasing. The immortalized mPSCs have the potential to serve as an in vitro model to examine the pathogenesis of influenza virus infection in mouse lungs.",

High-level expression of influenza virus receptors, \u03b12,3-linked sialic acid (\u03b12,3 SA), and \u03b12,6-linked sialic acid (\u03b12,6 SA), was detected on mPSCs (Figure 1A).

As shown in Figure 1B, the change of cell morphology and cytopathic effect (CPE) development were observed in the primary mPSCs upon influenza virus infection at an MOI of 10. Compared to the mock group, CPE was first observed at 12 hpi. The colony became less compact at 24 hpi and finally collapsed at 36 hpi. The infection was specific to mPSCs since the virus-infected cells were also costained with anti-M1 antibody and anti-Oct4 antibody (Figure 1C). Only mild cell morphology change at 24 hpi was observed when a lower virus input was used (Supplementary Figure S1). Infection of mPSCs by influenza virus was also confirmed using TEM (Supplementary Figure S2). Virus budding from influenza virus-infected mPSCs was observed, and the releasing virus particles had similar morphology to those released from MDCK cells. In addition, the susceptibility of mPSC-differentiated AT-I cells and AT-II cell line (MLE15) to influenza virus infection was also investigated. The CPE development and viral NP protein expression in AT-I cells and the AT-II cell line were observed at 24 hpi (Supplementary Figures S3A,B).",

First, the mPSCsOct4+ clones also expressed influenza virus receptors, \u03b12,3 SA and \u03b12,6 SA. The proportion of \u03b12,3 SA- and \u03b12,6 SA-positive cells were 48 and 45.1%, respectively, in the mPSCsOct4+ E3L clone after 20 passages (Figure 3A). The expression of CAR and CD54 was also detected on the mPSCsOct4+ E3L clone (Figure 3A). Sustained expression of sialic acid receptors on the mPSCsOct4+ E3L clone after five to 20 passages was observed (Supplementary Figure S4). Next, the susceptibility of the mPSCsOct4+ E3L clone to influenza virus infection was evaluated. Cells were infected by PR8 at an MOI of 10. A significant CPE induced by PR8 infection was observed at 48 hpi (Figure 3B). The expression of viral M1 proteins was detected in virus-infected cells at 12\u201348 hpi (Figure 3C). The release of virus particles from E3L clone was also confirmed using transmission electron microscope (TEM). The morphology of most virus particles was similar to those from MDCK and mPSCs cells (Supplementary Figure S2). The virus particles in the supernatant from virus-infected mPSCsOct4+ E3L clone and MDCK cells were layered by linear sucrose gradient (30\u201360%) ultracentrifugation. To examine the distribution of virus in the gradients, viral infectivity and the amount of viral hemagglutinin (HA) and NP proteins were analyzed by plaque assay and Western blot, respectively, in all fractional samples. First, the density of viral particles from supernatants of MDCK and mPSCsOct4+ E3L clone was estimated to be 1.20 and 1.18 g/ml, respectively (Supplementary Figure S5A). The distribution of HA and NP proteins was found to be consistent with that of virus titers across the gradient for mPSCsOct4+ E3L clone but not for MDCK cells (Supplementary Figure S5B). More HA proteins were detected in fraction 3 instead of fraction 6 whose virus titer was highest.",

Similar trend of virus replication was observed in mPSCs and MDCK when high virus input was used. Compared to MDCK cells, a reduced virus replication was observed when a lower virus input was used to infect the mPSCsOct4+ E3L clone (Figure 4B). The virus growth kinetics in AT-I and MLE15 cells were also determined (Supplementary Figure S3C). Whereas viruses exhibited similar growth trend in AT-I cells as compared to the mPSCs and mPSCsOct4+ E3L clone, a relatively lower virus growth was observed in MLE15 cells (Supplementary Figure S3C). The susceptibility of E3L clone to infection of other influenza subtypes was also determined. Among the four human influenza viruses, A/California/07/2009 (H1N1), A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1)-like virus, A/Taipei/0056/2016(H1N1)-like virus, and A/Taiwan/S02076/2013 (H7N9), increased virus titers at 12 hpi were observed (Figure 4C). The specific expression of NP proteins in cells infected with these influenza viruses was also confirmed by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) (Supplementary Figure S6).

First, binding and entry assays were performed to determine whether the differential virus replication was attributed to reduced viral entry. Nevertheless, a significant increased binding (38.8 vs. 31.9%, P = 0.007) and penetration (51.8 vs. 39.4%, P < 0.001) were observed in the E3L clone compared to MDCK cells (Supplementary Table S2). There was no difference in entry between these two cells (52.39 vs. 48.76%, P = 0.21). Next, we aimed to characterize the profiles of three viral RNA species in the E3L clones. In the early stage of infection (3 hpi), expression of three viral RNA species was higher in MDCK cells than those in mPSCsOct4+. However, higher mRNA and cRNA expression was observed in mPSCsOct4+ than in MDCK cells at 6 hpi (Figures 5B,C), yet vRNA expression in mPSCsOct4+ remained lower than that of MDCK during the study period (Figure 5A). According to previous studies, unlike mRNA and cRNA whose replication depends on the original polymerase complexes on the imported vRNP, yet vRNA replication requires newly synthesized polymerase complexes (Jorba et al., 2009; York et al., 2013). Therefore, expression of the major vRNP proteins, NP, was determined. Although a higher expression of NP was detected at 4 hpi in MDCK than that in the mPSCsOct4+ E3L clone, no significant difference between the E3L clone and MDCK cells was observed at 8 and 12 hpi (Figure 5D). Next, the distribution of viral proteins PB2, PB1, PA, and NP in infected cells was investigated by IFA. The expression of NP was mainly restricted in the nucleus at 4 hpi in both MDCK cells and the E3L clone. However, at 8 hpi, a unique aggregation of NP proteins was observed in the cytosol of the E3L clone, and such pattern remained at 12 hpi (Figure 6A). Furthermore, aggregation of NP proteins was also observed in the cytosol of the mPSCs at 12 hpi (Supplementary Figure S7). Unlike NP proteins, the distributions of influenza polymerase complex proteins, PB2, PB1, and PA, in both MDCK cells and E3L clones were similar and mainly restricted in the nucleus (Figure 6B).",

In addition, these virus-infected stem/progenitor cells tend to lose their ability to repair damage due to blockage of Fgfr2b-dependent renewal through inhibiting \u03b2-catenin-mediated transcription (Quantius et al., 2016). It was also demonstrated that Oct4+ lung stem/progenitor cells from different species could be infected by human H1N1 influenza, swine H1N1 influenza, and avian H7N2 influenza viruses (Khatri et al., 2012). These findings implicate that lung/progenitor cells could be infected by influenza viruses and might play a role in influenza virus-induced pathogenesis. In this study, Oct4+Sca1+SSEA1+ mPSCs were isolated from newborn ICR mice to examine their susceptibility to influenza virus infection, and these cells were further immortalized by transducing mouse Oct4 for subsequent in vitro analysis. We demonstrated that these mPSCsOct4+ cells are susceptible to influenza virus infection and can release similar profiles of cytokines/chemokines after viral infection. In addition, due to the demonstrated expressions of cytokeratin-7 and peroxiredoxin 2 and 6 and relatively high level of CyP450 activities in previous study (Gu et al., 2016), our mPSCs might be closely associated with the lineage of club cells, which were reported as target cells of influenza virus infection, and a significant loss of such cells in C56BL/6 mouse infected with influenza viruses has been reported (Kumar et al., 2011; Hirano et al., 2016). These results implicate that our mPSCs could serve as in vitro target cells for influenza A viruses to modulate early pro-inflammatory responses to influenza virus infection.",

Previously, increased levels of MCP-1, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-5, IL-4, and IL-9 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from PR8-challenged C57BL/6 mice have been reported (Buchweitz et al., 2007). The increased expression of MCP-1, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, RANTES, KC, and MIP2 was detected in primary airway epithelial cells isolated from C57BL/6 mice (Tate et al., 2011). Similar to previous studies, our study results showed that compared with uninfected cells, increased levels of IL-6 and IFN-\u03b3 as well as IL12p40p70, MCP-5, SCF, sTNFRI, RANTES, and VEGF were observed at 12 hpi. Elevated expression of IFN-\u03b2 was also determined by ELISA at 12 and 24 hpi. Interestingly, increased levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor I (sTNFRI) were detected in PR8-infected mPSCsOct4+. sTNFRI was shown in previous studies to interfere with the interactions between TNF-\u03b1 and its membrane form receptor (mTNFR) and subsequently lead to downregulation of TNF-\u03b1-induced inflammation (Levine, 2008). Such elevated levels of sTNFRI were also found in mouse model (Lowder et al., 2006; Gabriel et al., 2009) or human (Hoffmann et al., 2015) after H1N1 or H7N9 influenza virus infection, respectively. An increased level of VEGF in cultured supernatants of PR8-infected mPSCsOct4+ was also noticed. VEGF, as a vascular permeability factor, plays a crucial role in lung maintenance, inducing proliferation of systemic vasculature, stimulating growth of AT-II, and secreting surfactant protein (Barratt et al., 2014). VEGF also has chemotaxis ability to attract alveolar macrophages, which express VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) (Clauss et al., 1996; Ferrara et al., 2003). The increased expression of cytokines in PR8-infected mPSCsOct4+ might implicate that mPSCs play an important role as immune sensor upon PR8 infection to attract infiltration of immune regulatory cells.",

            "text": "To better characterize virus replication in mPSCsOct4+, series of assays were performed in this study. Compared with the commonly used cell line MDCK, similar trend of virus growth was observed, albeit with a relatively lower virus propagation in PR8-infected mPSCs and mPSCsOct4+ cells. A significantly higher percentage of virus binding (38.82 vs. 31.9%, P = 0.00685) and penetration (51.75 vs. 39.41%, P = 0.00024) was observed in PR8-infected mPSCsOct4+ as compared to MDCK cells. However, the entry percentages were similar (52.39 vs. 48.76%, P = 0.21322) between PR8-infected mPSCsOct4+ and MDCK cells. The inconsistent results of binding/penetration and entry ability might indicate that virus envelope uncoating, vRNP importing into nucleus, or even RNA replication is faster in MDCK cells than mPSCsOct4+. To investigate the difference of viral RNA replication and transcription efficiency between these two cells, expressions of viral vRNA, cRNA, and mRNA were quantified by RT-PCR. A more dramatic difference in viral vRNA replication in mPSCsOct4+ at 6 and 12 hpi was observed (Figure 5A). It was recently reported that viral vRNA and cRNA replication are initiated by soluble polymerase complexes in trans, but mRNA replication is initiated by resident polymerase complexes in cis (Eisfeld et al., 2015). Although vRNA and cRNA both are negative stranded RNA and are synthesized by the same polymerase complexes, different promoter sequences are used to initiate RNA replication (Azzeh et al., 2001). Previous study indicated that p65, one component in the NF-\u03baB, was involved in regulating vRNA synthesis from the cRNA promoter (Kumar et al., 2008). NF-\u03baB signaling can be activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF\u03b1, IL-1, or toll-like receptors (Lawrence, 2009), and plays a role in regulating the expression of cytokines, chemokines, or adhesion molecules. Therefore, high expression of sTNFRI in culture supernatant of PR8-infected mPSCsOct4+ might downregulate TNF-\u03b1, activating NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, and subsequently lead to impairment in vRNA replication.",

In our study, we found that, compared to MDCK, less NP expression in the influenza-infected mPSCsOct4+ E3L clone was detected at early time point (4 hpi), yet similar viral protein expression between two cells was observed later at 8 and 12 hpi. Nevertheless, a unique distribution pattern of NP proteins was observed in the influenza-infected mPSCsOct4+ E3L clone. Compared to MDCK, aggregated NP was observed in the cytosol of the mPSCsOct4+ E3L clone at 8 and 12 hpi. Previous study has shown that drug-induced NP aggregation in cytosol might block migration of NP into nucleus and subsequently impair virus replication (Kao et al., 2010). Host protein phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) (Luo et al., 2018) and moloney leukemia virus 10 (MOV10) (Zhang et al., 2016) also have been reported can interact with importin \u03b1 to inhibit viral vRNP imported into nucleus. Therefore, aggregation of NP in mPSCsOct4+ might block vRNP nuclear import, then interfere with vRNA replication. Otherwise, vRNP imports into nucleus were also controlled by the phosphorylation status of NP (Zheng et al., 2015). In that study, the authors found that phosphorylation of S9 and Y10 on nuclear location signal (NLS) blocked the interaction between NP and importin \u03b1, causing vRNP retention in the cytosol. However, the possible mechanism of NP aggregation in the cytosol of mPSCsOct4+ needs more studies.",
