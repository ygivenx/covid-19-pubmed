            "text": "Many infectious diseases in humans are caused by pathogens originating from a wide variety of animals. More than 60% of emerging diseases are estimated to originate from wildlife [1]\u2013[4]. Public awareness of zoonoses has recently increased because of their public health and economic impacts. Birds are recognized as frequent reservoirs for viruses that are of concern to humans; notably influenza A which is capable of infecting other mammals thereby facilitating genome segment reassortments and changes in tropism and transmission efficiency [5]\u2013[8]. Sporadic human infections of the virulent H5N1 resulting from direct contact with infected poultry or wild birds have been reported in 15 countries, mainly in Asia [9]\u2013[13], and H7N9 has recently emerged as a virus of concern. The prevalence of avian influenza viruses was 12% of oropharyngeal and 20% of cloacal swab specimens collected from urban pigeons in Slovakia [14]. H5N1 was found in a dead feral pigeon in Hong Kong [15] but is generally apathogenic in this host species and the overall risk of H5N1 transmission from pigeons to humans or chickens appears low [16], [17]. West Nile virus (WNV) and Saint Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus, two arboviruses in the Flavivirus genus transmitted by mosquitoes bites, are disseminated by wild birds [18]\u2013[23]. WNV-specific antibody and viremia was found in 25.7% and 11% of rock pigeons, respectively in the United States [24]. WNV was also isolated in pools of brains, kidneys, heart and spleen of feral pigeons and mapgies [25]. Pigeons developed low levels of WNV viremia; insufficient to infect mosquitoes [24], [26]. Avian paramyxoviruses, including Newcastle disease virus, are common domestic and wild bird pathogens [27]\u2013[30]. Paramyxovirus type-1 can be found in pigeons worldwide [31]\u2013[34] but the clinical signs vary depending on the immunity of the host and virulence of the specific isolates [35]. While human infection with Newcastle disease virus is rare, at least two outbreaks of conjunctivitis due to Newcastle disease virus have been reported in poultry workers [28], [36], [37]. Chicken anemia virus (CAV), until recently the only member of the gyrovirus genus, is highly contagious and causes severe anemia, hemorrhage and depletion of lymphoid tissue in chickens [38]\u2013[40]. Related gyroviruses were recently characterized in human feces, blood and on healthy human skin [41]\u2013[44] indicating possible human tropism. Gyrovirus DNA was also detected in three blood samples of solid organ transplant patients and in one HIV-infected person [44] as well as in 0.85% of healthy French blood donations [45].",

Droppings were collected without any physical contact with wild urban pigeons. Procedure therefore did not require animal committee ethical review. The field studies did not involve endangered or protected species. Fresh and well-separated droppings were sampled using sterile swabs which were stored in two ml of viral transport media as described [46]. The fecal sample from P\u00e9cs, Hungary was collected from a nesting 5\u20138 days old, clinically healthy pigeon into Hanks\u2019 buffered saline solution (Gibco BRL). Prior to the shipment on dry ice, samples were heat treated at 74\u00b0C for 50 minutes to inactivate viruses. The suspensions were vigorously vortexed and clarified by 15,000 \u00d7 g centrifugation for 10 minutes. 200 \u00b5l of the supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-\u00b5m filter (Millipore) to remove bacterium-sized particles. The filtrate was then treated with a mixture of DNases (Turbo DNase from Ambion, Baseline-ZERO from Epicentre, and Benzonase from Novagen) and RNase (Fermentas) to digest unprotected nucleic acids [47]. Viral nucleic acids protected from digestion within viral capsids and other small particles were then extracted using a QIAamp spin-column technique according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Qiagen). For the single fecal specimen from Hungary, non-specific RNA and DNA amplification was then performed by random RT-PCR using a primer with randomized 3\u2032 ends [47]. Amplicons were then pooled, 454 libraries generated according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (GS FLX Titanium General Library Preparation Kit, Roche) and pyrosequenced using the 454 Titanium FLX+ sequencer. For the 50 fecal specimens from Hong Kong, pools of nucleic acids from five fecal specimens were generated resulting in ten separate pools. A library was then constructed using ScriptSeq\u2122 v2 RNA-Seq Library Preparation Kit (Epicentre) and then sequenced using the Miseq Illumina platform with 250 bases paired ends with a distinct molecular tag for each pool. Because fecal specimens were analyzed in pools of five, the viruses identified are reported per specimen pool rather than for individual specimens. The 454 and Illumina singleton reads and assembled contigs greater than 100-bp were compared to the GenBank protein databases using BLASTx. An E value of 10\u22125 was used as the cutoff value for significant hits. The sequence data from the MiSeq run is in the short read archive at GenBank accession number SRX263026.",

Phylogenetic analyses were performed using novel virus sequences, their best BLASTx hits, and representative members of related viral species or genera. All alignments and phylogenetic analyses were based on the translated amino acid sequences. Sequence alignment was performed using CLUSTAL X (version 2.0.3) with the default settings [48]. Aligned sequences were trimmed to match the genomic regions of the viral sequences obtained in the study. A phylogenetic tree with 100 bootstrap resamples of the alignment data sets was generated using the neighbor-joining method based on the Jones-Taylor-Thornton matrix-based model in MEGA version 5 [49]. Bootstrap values (based on 100 replicates) for each node are given if >70%. The generated phylogenetic trees were visualized using the program MEGA version 5. Resulting trees were examined for consistency with published phylogenetic trees. Sequence identity was measured using BioEdit [50]. The sequence distance comparison was calculated by using SSE [51]. Conserved amino acid analyses were performed over the alignments produced by CLUSTAL X (version 2.0.3). The hypothetical cleavage map of the picornavirus polyprotein was derived from alignments with other closest picornaviruses and NetPicoRNA prediction. Putative ORFs in the genome were predicted by NCBI ORF finder. The secondary structure of 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTR was predicted using the Mfold program.",

Gaps between short sequence reads were filled by PCR and then directly Sanger-sequenced. The nearly complete genome (5492-bp) of pigeon parvovirus, including a partial 5\u2032 UTR (252-bp), complete NS (631-aa), complete VP (696-aa) and a partial 3\u2032 UTR (54-bp) was acquired (GenBank KC876004). As expected the genome contained two large open reading frames (ORFs) with the left and right ORFs encoding non-structural (NS) and viral capsid protein (VP), respectively (Figure 1A). Distinct from its closest genetic relatives (chicken and turkey parvoviruses), pigeon parvovirus A contained an unusually long middle ORF (477-aa) (Figure 1A). The carboxy termini of this ORF (135-aa; position 343\u2013477) showed best although weak similarity (BLASTx to NR E score: 8.9\u00d710\u22122) to a segment of a 221-aa ORF43 predicted encoded protein from the large dsDNA fowl adenovirus genome [59], sharing 28% amino acid identity (Figure 1A). A smaller middle ORF (155-aa) was also detected, which did not show similarity to any other sequence in GenBank. The start codon of NS was located in a strong Kozak sequence context, CAGCATGGC and contained the ATP or GTP binding Walker loop motif 401GPANTGKT408 [GXXXXGK(T/S)] [60]. Additionally, two conserved replication initiator motifs 118RCHVHIMLI126 and 145ITKYVTEALT154 were also found [61]. Similar to chicken parvovirus, pigeon parvovirus\u2019s VP protein did not possess the phospholipase A2 (PLA2) motif with its highly conserved calcium-binding site (YLGPF) as well as the phospholipase catalytic residues (HD and D). The N-terminus of its VP protein contained glycine rich sequence (GGGGSVGSGGGGGVG) also present in other parvoviral VP proteins. Pair-wise amino acid sequence analysis showed that the NS and VP proteins in pigeon parvovirus shared the highest aa-identities of 41% and 34% to those of chicken parvovirus [62], and less than 20% to the proteins of other parvovirus genera (Table S1). Figure 1B shows that pigeon parvovirus NS and VP proteins shared a monophyletic root with chicken and turkey parvoviruses, indicating a common origin. Based on the NS and VP phylogenetic analysis and genetic distance calculations, parvoviruses from pigeons, chickens and turkeys may be included as members of as a novel genus with a proposed name of Aviparvovirus (for avian parvovirus) in the subfamily Parvovirinae.",

The P1, P2 and P3 regions of GALII-5/2011/HUN showed 74%, 92% and 97% amino acid identity to strain HK-21 indicating a presence of two genotypes of the same picornavirus species. Polyprotein alignments revealed that strain GALII-5/2011/HUN had an alternative upstream start codon MREY instead of the putative start codon of MATF seen in strain HK-21 (Figure S2). A stop codon was found between MREY and MATF in strain HK-21 but none was found in strain GALII-5/2011/HUN. The start codon in the upstream MREY in GALII-5/2011/HUN was also located in a weaker Kozak consensus sequence [GGGGATGCG] which plays a major role in the initiation of the translation process than MATF [GGAGATGGC] (Figure S2). We therefore selected the second methionine codon (MATF) as the start codon for the analysis. The single 2,707/2,711-aa-long (of HK-21/GALII-5/2011/HUN) polyprotein coding region was flanked by the 620/727 nt-long 5\u2032 UTR and the 320/332-nt-long 3\u2032 UTR. By BLASTx, its polyprotein showed the closest identity to the turkey hepatitis virus belonging to Megrivirus genus [52]. Therefore, we provisionally named these piconaviruses as Mesivirus-1 (strain HK-21) and Mesivirus-2 (strain GALII-5/2011/HUN) for Megrivirus sister-clade virus.",

            "text": "The mesivirus 5\u2032 UTR contained a highly conserved, 20 nucleotides long motif and apical \u201c8\u201d-like structure 407GGAGGTGGTGCTGAAATATTGCAAGCCACT437 (with unknown function) that were also seen in avian origin picornaviruses, including turkey hepatitis virus (genus Megrivirus), duck hepatitis A virus-1 (genus Avihepatovirus), quail picornavirus (unassigned genus) and pigeon picornavirus B (unassigned genus) [52], [71], [72]. All these picornaviruses had type IV-like IRES [http://www.picornaviridae.com], however, we could not draw the potential secondary structure of mesivirus IRES. The hypothetical cleavage map of the polyproteins of mesiviruses were derived from alignments with other known picornaviruses and NetPicoRNA prediction [73]. Mesiviruses did not have a putative L protein preceding the capsid region. The P1 regions were 807/809-aa (Mesivirus-1/Mesivirus-2) in length containing rhv-like superfamily domains (Figure 2A) revealed by Conserved Domain Database (CDD) search [74]. The conserved motif GXXXT/S for myristylation was also absent. Similar to the megrivirus, there was no potential VP2/VP4 cleavage site in mesiviruses. The P1 polyproteins of mesivirus-1 and -2 could be theoretically cleaved at VP0/VP3 (Q389\u2013390\u2193Y/T), VP3/VP1 (Q557/558\u2193G) and VP1/2A1 (Q807/809\u2193D/E). BLASTx showed that the P1 region had the highest aa-identity of 43%-41% to the megrivirus (strain 0091.1, HQ189775) (Table S2). The P2 polypeptides (1019/1021-aa) encoded non-structural proteins of mesivirus-1 and -2 cleaved at 2A1/2A2 (G1095/1099\u2193R), 2A2/2B (Q1290/1294\u2193A), 2B/2C (E1480/1484\u2193A) and 2C/3A (E1826/1830\u2193A) (Table S2). Similar to the megrivirus Turkey hepatitis virus, both mesivirus genomes encoded an unusual 2A1 (288/290 aa) at the N-terminal end of the P2 polypeptide. When megrivirus and mesivirus polyproteins where aligned their 2A1 regions showed the weakest homology along their genomes with only the central part of 2A1 (28%) showing 31% identity to that of the megrivirus 2A1 strain 0091.1 (accession number HQ189775) (Figure S1A). The 195-aa-long 2A2 proteins of both mesiviruses contained an HBox/NC domain (H1127/1131 WG and N1188/1192 CT) that was also observed in the 199-aa-long 2A2 of megriviruses [75]. Characteristic features of picornaviruses, including the RNA-helicase superfamily and NTPase motifs, were identified in the mesivirus 2C proteins. The P3 of megriviruses were 881-aa in length encoding proteins 3A, 3B (VPg, small genome-linked protein), 3Cpro (protease) and 3Dpol (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase). The P3 polypeptides were cleaved at 3A/3B (E2008/2012\u2193A), 3B/3C (E2036/2040\u2193G) and 3C/3D (Q2233/2237\u2193G) (Table S2). The 3Cpro contained the H-D-C catalytic triad and conserved GXCG [G2190/2194 FCG] motif known as an active site of protease [76]. The 3Dpol contained conserved RdRp motifs K2398/2402 ELR, Y2567/2571 GDD and F2616/2620 LKR. It also had a conserved motif G2527/2531 GMPSG that was also seen in other picornaviruses [77].",

Although the identities of the P2 and P3 regions qualified mesiviruses as belonging to a novel genus, its P1 region shared more than the 40% aa-identity threshold to megrivirus.

While VP1\u2013VP3 shared 84%-94% aa-identities with group G rotavirus, other structural proteins showed lower aa-identities, ranging from 35% to 67% (Table 2). Classification of rotavirus is based mainly on the inner capsid protein VP6 and according to ICTV definition the members of the same rotavirus species should share >60% nt-identity in VP6 region [82]. The sequence (1176-nt) of the VP6-encoding genome segment shared 68% nt-identity to group G rotavirus (Figure 3A). Direct observation of VP6 alignment between HK18 and its closest relatives revealed numerous mismatches in the group-specific antigenic regions (Figure S3), indicating that HK18 represents a candidate prototype for a novel subgroup within group G. Two structural proteins VP4 (the protease-cleaved polyprotein) and VP7 (the glycoprotein) on the outermost surface of rotavirus are targets for neutralizing antibodies and have also been used to classify rotaviruses into their P and G genotypes, respectively [83]. The nucleotide sequence alignments of HK18 VP4 and VP7 showed low identity to other rotaviruses (Figure 4A). In addition, HK18 and group G rotavirus shared only 35% for VP4 and 51% for VP7 at the amino acid level, suggesting that HK18 should be considered as novel P and G genotypes, tentatively proposed as G2P [2] within group G rotavirus. The VP1 protein of HK18 contained three conserved RNA-dependent RNA polymerase motifs 558AEKIILYTDVSQWDAS\n573, 638\nLKIRYLGVASGEKTTKIGNSFANVALI\n664 and 683MRVDGDDNVVT693\n[84]. Similar to group G rotavirus, the VP3 protein of HK18 did not possess the NTP-binding sequence motif present in group C rotavirus [85]. However, an alignment of VP3 sequences from different rotavirus groups showed that the VP3 protein of HK18 shared a high degree of conservation in ALYXLSN [ALYSLSN] motif, which has unknown function [86]. In order to phylogenetically classify pigeon rotavirus HK18, its six structural proteins were aligned to other group rotavirus representatives. While the VP1\u2013VP3, VP6 and VP7 of HK18 were clustered with those of group G rotavirus (Figure 3B and Figure S4), its VP4 was located on a branch diverging closer to the root (Figure 4B).",

Like group G rotavirus, the NSP1 gene of HK18 had two ORFs encoding two minor and major peptides labeled as NSP1\u20131 (104-aa) and NSP1\u20132 (310-aa), respectively. While NSP1\u20131 had the best identity of 30% to group G rotavirus, NSP1\u20132 shared the closet match to group B rotavirus with 23% identity versus 19% to group G. The NSP1 zinc-binding domain could not be identified in HK18. The NSP2 was found to have a conserved sequence HGXGHXRXV and histidine triad (His-X-His-X-His-XX) located at the RNA binding domain [87]. Phylogenetic analysis of NSP2\u2013NSP5 showed that the group G rotavirus was the closest relative to HK18 (Figure S4) in all fragments except for NSP1 where it appeared basal to both groups G and B.

We investigated viral sequences in 51 wild pigeon droppings followed by viral sequence similarity searches revealing sequences closely or distantly related to viral genomes in GenBank. The eukaryotic viruses detected included insect and plant viruses likely reflecting the pigeon diet as well as viruses already known to infect pigeons such as pigeon circovirus and adenoviruses. Also detected and characterized were novel genomes in viral families known to infect vertebrates.",

The Parvoviridae subfamily has recently undergone a large expansion in the number of know genera and species [58], [62], [102], [103]. Here a novel parvovirus was characterized in pigeon feces that was distantly related to chicken and turkey parvoviruses found in feces of farm animals with signs of enteric diseases [62], [98]. The pigeon parvovirus genome, the first from that host species, possessed an unusually long middle ORF that encoded a protein showing similarity to that encoded by an ORF of unknown function in the fowl adenovirus genome. This observation might reflect past lateral gene exchange between avian DNA viruses replicating in the nucleus. The pigeon, chicken and turkey parvoviruses cluster together phylogenetically, but have not yet been assigned to a Parvovirinae genus. We therefore propose a new genus provisionally called Aviparvovirus containing at least two species, pigeon parvovirus and the closely related turkey/chicken parvoviruses.",
