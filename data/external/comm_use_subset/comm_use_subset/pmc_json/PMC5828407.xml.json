F4+ ETEC has three variants, namely, ab, ac, and ad. A comparative analysis of the gene cluster between these three variants show that their differences mainly involve the faeG gene, thereby causing variations in the adhesive properties and specificities of the F4 fimbriae [2, 3]. The major FaeG subunit is an essential component of F4 fimbriae. For instance, oral administration of F4 fimbriae or the FaeG protein induces a protective mucosal immune response [4, 5]. Moreover, the FaeG deleted strains show a significant reduction in adherence to host epithelial cells [6].",

Thus, interactions between F4ab, F4ac, or F4ad fimbriae and specific receptors on the host intestinal are essential in initiating attachment, colonization, and infection of the three serotypes. A polymorphism within mucin 4 intron 7 has been linked to an importance percentage of F4 ETEC adhesive phenotype and has been used in the primary selection of F4ab/ac-susceptible or -resistant piglets in various breeds [8, 9]. The inheritance pattern for the F4ad receptor is presumably controlled by a new mode; the partially adhesive receptor is dominated by only one gene and the fully adhesive receptor is encoded by more than one epistatic gene [10]. The receptor protein of the three variants also varies, i.e., the 210- and 240-kDa intestinal mucin-type glycoprotein interact with both F4ab and F4ac, whereas a 74-kDa glycoprotein (GP74) and an intestinal neutral glycosphingolipid specifically adheres to F4ab and F4ad, respectively [11].",

APN can activate or inactivate bioactive peptides on the cell surface, and cause cytokine and extracellular matrix degradation to show enzymatic activity. APN plays a role in inflammatory and immunological responses, antigen processing, tumor invasion, and cell\u2013cell contact. Moreover, APN modulates signals in monocytes [13] and is a receptor for several coronaviruses, i.e., canine coronavirus, feline infectious peritonitis virus, and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) [14, 15]. Importantly, APN is also a direct receptor for ETEC F4 fimbriae and is associated with the induction of mucosal immunity [16]. FaeG from all three variants directly mediate the fimbrial binding of F4+\nE. coli to host intestinal epithelial cells by binding to APN, while also modulating APN expression in IPEC-J2 cells that in turn influences ETEC adherence [6, 17].",

We used pGEX-6p-1 and pet28a (+) as negative controls. After washing the plates four times in PBST, we incubated the plates in an anti-F4 monoclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution in PBS) at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h, followed by HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Abcam, USA) for 30 min [21].

Each peptide was 13 amino acids in length and offset from its neighboring peptide by three amino acids. We automatically performed synthesis on an amino-PEG500-grafted cellulose membrane according to standard SPOT synthesis protocols [22, 23]. We activated the membranes with 318 spots for APN and 205 spots for FaeG in ethanol (every 5 min, thrice). Afterwards, we sequentially washed the membranes thrice times in a TBST buffer, blocked the membranes in 5% BSA-TBST, incubated these with bait proteins (1 mg/mL purified soluble proteins), and then blotted these with a monoclonal antibody against F4+ and polyclonal antibodies against APN, respectively, with BSA-TBST as negative control. The resulting chemiluminescent signals were analyzed using TotalLab 1D software (USA). The peptide with the strongest signal intensity was set to 100%, and the other spots were normalized to this value [23]. Signal with intensity values > 30% were considered positive.

Considering that FaeG directly mediates the binding of the three F4 variants to the host intestinal epithelial cells [6, 27], the only difference among the three variants involves in the faeG gene and results in different structural and adhesive properties to host receptors [11]. Previous studies have shown that the fimbriae of the three variants recognized and bound to different receptors, i.e., F4ab and F4ac fimbriae interacted with both sulfatide and galactosylceramide, whereas F4ad did not [28]. Moreover, previous studies have determined that residual AAs 125\u2013163 of FaeG are essential for F4 fimbrial binding, AAs 140\u2013145 and 151\u2013156 are the determinant epitopes for F4ab, and 147\u2013160 dictate the binding capacity of F4ac [29].

The presence of an N-glycosylation sequon between AAs 286\u2013288 in porcine APN, that is absent in human APN, blocked the entry of human coronaviruses 229E. APN glycosylation determines the species specificity of group 1 coronavirus infection [32]. In addition, APN is a recently reported receptor protein for F4 fimbriae. APNs are involved in oral immune responses and clathrin-mediated endocytosis of F4 fimbriae [16]. Previous studies have found that F4 ETEC susceptibility is not associated with the genetic polymorphisms or expression differences in the APN gene, and that the \u03b12\u20133,6,8 sialic acid of APN is sufficient for the binding of F4 fimbriae [16, 33]. In our previous study, we found that changes in APN expression in IPEC-J2 cells could affect F4 ETEC adherence, and the results of yeast two-hybrid and pull-down assays confirmed that APN directly binds to the major fimbrial subunit FaeG in all three variants; however, we did not think that meta-periodate (NaIO4) treatment had a significant impact on APN-FaeG binding in vitro [17]. We also found that the brush border membrane vesicles of F4 susceptible piglets have weaker F4 binding after 10 mM NaIO4 treatment for 30 min; this phenomenon is in accordance with earlier reports that the binding of F4ac to porcine enterocytes depends on glycosylation [16, 34]. However, details on the key glycosylation site in APN protein and whether APN glycosylation in vitro differs from that of in vivo remain unclear. Ultimately, the binding determinant in the interplay between APN and FaeG still needs to be elucidated.",

To test this hypothesis, we used membranes spotted with APN peptides libraries incubated in both fusion FaeG proteins and natural F4 fimbrial proteins. Our data suggests that the primary sequence of APN recognized by FaeG is limited to 13 specific peptides, and that these 13 peptides are located throughout the APN protein and exhibit different binding strengths in F4ab, F4ac, and F4ad.

However, the linear mapping might be not in accordance with the protein structure, considering fusion proteins and peptides not well glycosylated, the critical residues mentioned above might be quite different from three-dimensional (3D) images of the FaeG-APN interactions, we further adopted Modeller version 9.17 as the homology modeling tool to develop 3D structures of APN-FaeG complexes [35]. The potential interacted residues in APN-FaeG interplay were performed with the help of GRAMM-X Protein\u2013Protein Docking Web Server v.1.2.0 [36] based on template structures obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: APN-4FKE [37], F4ab FaeG-4WE2, F4ac FaeG-2J6R, F4ad FaeG-4WEU) (Additional file 4).

After we confirmed the potential interacted residues of these three peptides for the APN-FaeG binding at 4\u00c5 resolution, we constructed a panel of peptides and FaeG proteins with single point mutations and used them to test for direct interplay with APN both in vitro and in vivo.
