Therefore, it is of importance to find optimal intervention and prevention strategies to reduce the risk of calf diseases on farms [3]. Diarrhoea and respiratory tract disease are the most frequent diseases in calves [4, 5]. Several risk factors for calf diseases, particularly diarrhoea, have been identified, including farm size, presence of a calving pen and hygiene in this area, the quality of colostrum and the route of colostrum feeding as well as type of calf housing [4, 6\u20139].",

In Austria, dairy farms are traditionally family-owned and small sized with an average number of 18 dairy cows, predominantly Fleckvieh breed [14]. Therefore, it can be assumed that the calf management on these small farms, similarly to countries with comparable agricultural structures, differs from that of other countries. Also, calves of different breeds might be managed differently as reported by Stanek et al. [13] for Holstein\u2013Friesian and Fleckvieh calves in Czech Republic.",

To identify associations between variables and the outcome variables calf diarrhoea and respiratory tract disease a two-step process was used. First, univariable logistic regression models were applied to determine the associations between the outcome variable and each binary or categorical variable. In the second step, variables with a P value \u22640.2 were included in a final multivariable logistic regression model using calf diarrhoea and calf respiratory tract disease incidence (\u226410 % vs >10 %) as outcome variable.

Similar studies were conducted in countries with greater average herd size [7, 11, 13, 20\u201322]. Data regarding general farm characteristics are presented in Table 1. Distribution of main breeds on registered dairy farms in Austria is 74.5 % Fleckvieh, 13.4 % Brown Swiss, and 10.9 % Holstein Frisian [14] and was similar (P > 0.05) in our study. Significant differences between small and large dairy farms were found for all general farm characteristics evaluated (Table 1). In summary, small farms were more often organic producing farms, on small farms cows had access to pasture, and cows were kept tied-up more often than on large farms. Furthermore, farm animals others than cattle were more often kept on small than on large farms. The question regarding \u201cother farm animals than cattle\u201d was included because in a previous study the presence of additional farm animals was associated with diarrhoea in calves [9]. On 54.6 % of the farms the average milk yield was between 6000 and 8000 kg per cow per year. On all registered farms, the average milk yield in 2013 was 7200 kg [14]. Milk yield (given as a categorical variable, see Table 1) differed significantly (P < 0.01) between small and large farms. Small farms generally had lower milk yields.

Calving management and care of the newborn are important for the calves\u2019 health and were therefore evaluated in detail in the present study. Overall, on 47.0 % of the farms a calving pen was available, which is in accordance with other studies [11, 20]. In a German survey on large farms with more than 100 dairy cows, a calving pen was obviously more common with up to 100 % of the farms having such an area [17]. Significant differences were, however, also present in availability of a calving pen between small and large farms of the present study. The use of a calving pen is recommended to minimize stress for the cow and newborn and ensure best hygiene [3, 4]. Nevertheless, in practice, calving pens are often not cleaned and disinfected regularly, or are used also for diseased animals, and might represent a risk factor for spreading infections [9]. This seems to be the case also on the farms of the present study as on farms with a calving pen univariable logistic regression revealed that the odds that farmers reported a diarrhoea incidence of >10 % was greater on farms with a calving pen than on farms without [odds ratio (OR) 1.57, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.24\u20131.98]. This hypothesis, however, was not confirmed in the multivariable logistic regression model, where the reported incidence of diarrhoea was not affected by the presence of a calving pen. As the calving pen might pose a risk factor for the newborn, it is recommended to separate calves from their dam as soon as possible after birth and to house calves individually in a clean area [3]. The vast majority of the farmers (88.5 %) indicated to separate the calf from its dam within 1 h after parturition. This is similar to the findings of Kehoe et al. [20] in Pennsylvania, whereas in studies from Canada, England and Wales, calves were generally separated later from their dam [11, 23].",

            "text": "Early cow-calf separation is also proposed to ensure an early and targeted colostrum supply [24]. Data concerning colostrum management are summarised in Table 2. Results suggest that farmers are aware of the importance of a timely colostrum supply, as 83.7 % stated to feed first colostrum within 4 h after birth. Although colostrum quality plays an important role in regard to a sufficient immunoglobulin supply to calves, most farmers (97.2 %) did not check first colostrum quality by use of a hydrometer. Regarding time and quantity of first colostrum feeding no difference could be detected between small and large farms. In contrast, frozen colostrum stocks and oesophageal tube feeding of first colostrum were significantly less common on small than on large farms (P < 0.01). Although the definition of small and large herds differ between the present study and the study by Kehoe et al. [20], these authors also found that the use of a hydrometer for colostrum quality estimation and the storage of frozen colostrum stocks was more often performed on large farms. Results concerning colostrum management are in accordance with results of a previous case control study performed in Austria [9]. Results of both studies (the present study and [9]) suggest that first colostrum feeding was performed early post natum by most farmers. Answers regarding this question, however, have to be interpreted with care, as farmers may have stated what they know is correct, but may not necessarily represent the true daily management practice. For adequate passive transfer of immunoglobulins (Ig) not only time, but also Ig quantity fed to the calf plays an important role. Although easy, fast, and cheap methods like hydrometers and Brix-refractometers to estimate colostrum quality on farm are available [25], colostrum quality was solely checked on few farms. A reason for this can only be hypothesized. Maybe, in contrast to the knowledge of importance of timely first colostrum feeding, the knowledge on importance of colostrum quality is not widespread.",

No clear tendency was found with regard to the duration of individual housing. Individually calf housing has been suggested with the aim to avoid transmission of pathogens between animals [27]. In epidemiological studies, however, rather group size than grouping itself was associated with an increased risk for calf diseases [4, 28]. Furthermore, it was suggested that social contact provided by group housing of calves increases performance (feed intake, weight gain) and animal welfare [29\u201331]. Nevertheless, in individually housed calves it is easier to feed calves individually according to their special needs and to control the animals\u2019 health status. The great proportion of farms (84.5 %) housed calves indoors what is similar to studies from Canada and Sweden [11, 19]. Reasons might be exposure to extreme climate conditions in Canada, Sweden, as well as in Austria during winter that prevents farmers from housing calves under outdoor conditions. Furthermore, in Alpine regions large gradients make it often difficult to position outdoor igloos.",

Milk replacer and waste milk were significantly more often fed on large farms (P < 0.01). Reasons for whole milk feeding were not asked, but could be due to the fact that it is easy to handle, consists of good balanced nutrients and that milk produced over the quota, can be fed [11]. Feeding waste milk was a common practice on the majority of the farms similar as reported by other authors [11, 13, 23, 32]. Although in a recent study Al Mawly et al.

This, however, is still not common on dairy farms, neither on farms of the present study nor in other countries that have been surveyed [11, 19]. Weaning took place late (73.7 % of the farmers, answering this question, stated not to wean calves before the 10th week of life) compared with other studies of different countries where calves were usually weaned between week 7 and 10 [11, 13, 19]. Reasons for relatively late weaning on farms were not asked and can only be hypothesised. Advantages of later weaning are higher daily weight gains and a reduced drop in energy intake after weaning [38, 39]. Reported disadvantages, such as higher feeding costs for late weaned calves [38] may be less pronounced in Austria because feeding milk produced over the quota is very common. It will be interesting if late weaning changes with the ending of the milk quota system this year.",

Consequently, the results might rather represent sensation of the farmer regarding disease incidence than true incidence. Furthermore, the predetermined classification of incidence was quite rough but considers that on average farms in Austria each case represents approximately 5 %-points. The prevalence of diseases in calves estimated by the farmers is presented in Table 5. Calf diarrhoea was the most prevalent disease. Approximately half of the farmers, however, estimated that the calf diarrhoea incidence on farm was not more than 10 %. This might be comparable to other studies where the reported median herd level incidence for calf diarrhoea was between 7.8 and 10.5 % [4, 7, 40].",

An explanation for this could be that farmers are more sensitive to calf diarrhoea than to other diseases, particularly as this disease can affect a large number of animals. It can only be speculated whether not answering questions was because farmers were not able to (not knowing) or not wanting to. Not answering questions concerning diseases was not correlated with answers given to any other question (any other dependent variable), but not answering questions to respiratory tract, umbilical, and joint disease, as well as mortality, were correlated with each other (correlation coefficient >0.60). It is probable that certain farmers generally did not want to answer questions on disease prevalence on their farms. Due to the fact that the questionnaires could be answered anonymously and due to the aforementioned knowledge that usually no data on calf disease exist, it is more likely that farmers did not know the incidence of (especially less prevalent) diseases.",

Associations between herd size and disease were also found in other studies and have been explained by increased stocking density and less time for individual care of calves [8, 9]. Another explanation could be that on farms of different sizes the recognition of diseases differs. Furthermore, other management factors that differ between small and large farms may influence this outcome. Therefore, we tested for confounding of evaluated management factors on the association between herd size and diarrhoea, but could not find such an effect in this study.",

Some of these factors have already been described as risk factors in previous studies [4, 7, 9, 22, 24, 40, 42].

Furthermore, results may be influenced by the fact that disease incidence given by the respondents was mainly based on estimations rather than on true numbers. Finally, some of these factors e.g. colostrum management, were very similar on most farms.",

These data may help to further point out areas to be improved on farm, e.g. testing for colostrum quality and prevention strategies for diarrhoea. Furthermore, significant differences could be determined between small and large Austrian farms, suggesting a higher degree of specialisation on large farms. These findings could be important with regard to farm consultancy provided by veterinarians, other specialists and organisations offering advisory services to elaborate prevention strategies to reduce the risk of calf diseases.",
