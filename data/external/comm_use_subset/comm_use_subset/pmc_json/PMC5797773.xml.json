            "text": "Respiratory viral infections, caused by influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs), and coronaviruses, remain a global public health concern (WHO, 2013). WHO has acknowledged the magnitude of this problem and has highlighted the need for research focused on the prevention of respiratory viral infections. However, except for influenza virus, there are no authorized vaccines available for the prevention of emerging/re-emerging respiratory viral infections (Hall, 2001). Vaccination is based on the adaptive immune responses that provide protection against a specific pathogen. Safe and controlled activation of the immune system results in a specific memory in the vaccinated hosts and protects them from secondary infection with the same pathogen (Chang et al., 2014). Recently, several studies have reported non-specific beneficial effects of vaccines on mortality and morbidity; these effects cannot be explained solely by adaptive immunity (Aaby et al., 2014; Goodridge et al., 2016). Growing evidence shows that the innate immune system acquires adaptive characteristics by \u2018trained immunity,\u2019 via epigenetic reprogramming of innate immune cells (Blok et al., 2015). A temporary antiviral response could also be established by the turnover of the cells that survived the initial infection (Hamilton et al., 2016). As such, non-specific effects (NSE) of vaccines usually develop a sufficient duration after the initial vaccination. The possibility remains, however, that NSE may also operate in an immediate manner for short-term protection, especially considering the potent antiviral responses of the innate immune system (Takeuchi and Akira, 2009). Such an effect is expected to be quite significant, especially with live attenuated vaccines that mimic natural infections (Seo et al., 2007). For example, live influenza vaccination was found to be associated with an immediate and indirect protection from respiratory illness among children (Piedra et al., 2007).",

Among the various types of vaccines, the cold-adapted, live attenuated influenza vaccine (CAIV) elicits a strong mucosal immune response in the respiratory tracts, providing effective immunity against infection (Renegar et al., 2004). Distinct from the currently licensed FluMist\u00ae, an alternative and independent CAIV based on the X-31ca backbone has been described (Baez et al., 1980). The genetic basis of attenuation of X-31ca has been characterized (Jang et al., 2016), and various CAIVs against seasonal influenza, H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), and the 2009 pandemic H1N1 have been evaluated (Jang et al., 2012, 2013, 2014). The X-31ca-based CAIVs provide an immediate, broad spectrum of protection against heterosubtypic and heterotypic influenza viruses (Seo et al., 2007; Jang et al., 2012).",

            "text": "Here, we examined whether X-31ca provides non-specific immediate cross-protection against RSV. Despite being classified into distinctive viral families (Latiff et al., 2004), RSV and influenza share common features in term of pathogenesis. Both viruses cause acute respiratory infections, and initial infection triggers innate immunity via pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), including TLR3, TLR7, and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) (Diebold et al., 2004; Guillot et al., 2005; Marr et al., 2013). The activated PRRs induce the production of interferons (IFNs), pro-inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines (Iwasaki and Pillai, 2014). IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 induces robust antiviral and immunomodulatory responses to interfere with virus replication and spread (Gonzalez-Navajas et al., 2012; Durbin et al., 2013), and IFN-\u03b3 is also critical for viral clearance of influenza virus and RSV (Weiss et al., 2010; Eichinger et al., 2015). We found, in a mouse infection model, that early innate immune responses were elicited in the respiratory tracts, restricting RSV replication and ameliorating the rapid increase of the early inflammatory cytokines following RSV challenge. The importance of the TLR3/7-dependent pathway was confirmed by using knockout (KO) mice. Considering previous findings on the long-term effects of influenza infection on subsequent RSV exposure (Walzl et al., 2000), we discuss the immediate NSE of CAIV as an additional benefit of vaccination among infants for the prevention of acute respiratory infections.",

Infection with X-31ca did not result in any appreciable weight loss as a sign of virulence (Figure 1A). Mice were then vaccinated with 106 PFU of X-31ca at various time intervals prior to RSV challenge. Weight changes were observed for 4 days after RSV challenge, and the mice were euthanized at day 4 post-challenge (p.c.) to collect lung tissues. Mice vaccinated with X-31ca 2 days before RSV challenge presented approximately 10% weight loss on day 2 p.c., whereas mice in other groups did not lose body weight (Figure 1B). Other indicative signs of illness, such as reduced activity or ruffled fur, were not noticed in the vaccination group on in the control group without vaccination. The lung viral titers dropped below the threshold level upon immunization with X-31ca, preventing RSV replication in the lung for up to 6 days during the interval between immunization and RSV challenge (Figure 1C). Pulmonary viral titers gradually increased when the interval was more than 14 days. In contrast, the lung viral titers in the mice vaccinated with formalin-inactivated X-31ca 2 days before RSV challenge were similar to those in unvaccinated mice (Figure 1D). RSV titer was measured only in HEp-2 cells, as the lung viral titer from parallel immunization of X-31ca, without RSV challenge, was below the detection level within 4 days of immunization (data not shown). Together, these results demonstrate that X-31ca vaccination could confer early, short-term protection against RSV challenge in mice.",

The levels of IgA derived from BAL fluid, and IgG and IgM derived from serum and were analyzed by ELISA for their specificity to X-31ca (Figures 2A\u2013C). IgA level against X-31ca was below the detection level within 6 days p.v. and increased rapidly after 14 days (Figure 2A). IgG level was detected as early as 6 days and increased rapidly thereafter (Figure 2B). IgM antibodies were rapidly produced and peaked on day 6 p.v. (Figure 2C). Mice were then immunized with X-31ca twice at 2-week intervals to acquire the X-31ca antibodies. In the ELISA, BAL fluids and sera collected from the X-31ca-injected mice (X-31ca \u00d7 2 group) presented OD values similar to those of the control group (PBS \u00d7 2 group) against the RSV G and F proteins as the major protective antigens (Figures 2D\u2013I). In contrast, mice infected with RSV (RSV \u00d7 2 group) on the same schedule showed strong reactivity against RSV G and F proteins. Of note, vaccination with X-31ca prior to infection with RSV did not appreciably change the CD4 and CD8 T cell composition in the lungs (Supplementary Figure S3). The lack of cross-reactivity between X-31ca and RSV even after boost immunization suggests that the immediate protection provided by X-31ca is not antibody-mediated.",

BAL fluids and cells were obtained daily for 6 days from mice infected with 106 PFU of X-31ca. The samples were used to examine the levels of IFNs (IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, and IFN-\u03b3) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6), and the numbers of immune cells (pDCs, NK cells, and eosinophils) as markers for innate immune responses (Figure 3). The concentrations of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 peaked on day 1 p.v. and decreased gradually, whereas the induction of IFN-\u03b3 was delayed, with its level peaking on day 6 p.v. (Figure 3A). Immunization with X-31ca induced lower, but still distinctly elevated, levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6. Populations of various immune cell types were examined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis (Figures 3B,C) for both the number of cells (left side) and the percentage of total immune cells (right side). Vaccinated mice elicited more pDCs (CD11clow PDCA-1+ cells) than the control group throughout the 6 days of examination, with peak values on days 3 and 4 p.v. (Figure 3B). The recruitment of NK cells (CD11b+ CD49b+ cells) and eosinophils (CD11c-Siglec-F+ cells) was slightly delayed, showing a peak level on day 5 p.v. The number of CD45+ immune cells in BAL was greatly increased as compared with the PBS control after day 3 p.v. (Figure 3C). pDCs and NK cells showed similar patterns for both the number and percentage of total immune cells, whereas eosinophils presented a different pattern (Figure 3B). This result probably reflected the highest increase in total immune cells on day 5 and 6 p.v. (Figure 3C). The number and the proportion of AMs (CD11c+Siglec-F+ cells) and neutrophils (CD11cinterGr-1high cells) were also examined (described in Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure S4). However, X-31ca vaccination did not show a significant difference as compared with the control.

BAL fluids and lung samples were collected daily for 4 days after RSV challenge and were examined for lung viral titers, cytokine levels, and immune-cell subsets (Figure 4). As expected, in contrast to the non-vaccinated control mice, which presented extensive viral growth (>3 \u00d7 104 PFU/g), RSV failed to replicate in the lungs of X-31ca-vaccinated mice (Figure 4A). Vaccination induced dramatic changes in the cytokine profiles. Notably, the levels of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1 that were strongly elevated by RSV infection were greatly reduced by vaccination (Figure 4B). In contrast, IFN-\u03b3 levels, which remained extremely low after RSV infection, were strongly elevated by vaccination. Moreover, the IL-6 level was maintained up to 4 days, in contrast to a sharp decrease (\u223c1 day) in the non-vaccinated mice. Thus, vaccination with X-31ca prior to infection with RSV dramatically changed the cytokine profiles and suppressed RSV infection. It should be noted that days 1\u20134 after RSV challenge (Figure 4B) corresponds to days 3\u20136 after X-31ca vaccination (Figure 3A), considering the 2-day interval between vaccination and challenge. Remarkably, the cytokine profiles and levels in X-31ca-vaccinated mice were relatively constant without notable perturbation following infection with RSV.",

The numbers of most immune cells, i.e., pDCs (CD11clow PDCA-1+ cells) and NK cells (CD11b+ CD49b+ cells), were consistently higher in vaccinated mice than in unvaccinated mice, with the exception of eosinophils (CD11c-Siglec-F+ cells) at days 1 and 4 p.c. (Figure 4C). However, NK cells and eosinophils showed different patterns for both the number and proportion of total immune cells, probably reflecting the increase in total immune cells upon vaccination with X-31ca (Figure 4D). The number and proportion of AMs (CD11c+Siglec-F+ cells) and neutrophils (CD11cinterGr-1high cells) were also examined (as described in Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure S5). The number and percentage of AMs were higher in vaccinated mice than in unvaccinated mice, only at day 2 p.c. In vaccinated mice, the number of neutrophils was consistently higher than that in unvaccinated mice, but the proportion did not show a significant difference between two groups. These results show that X-31ca vaccination recruits a large number of immune cells into the respiratory tract, and stabilizes the immune environment sufficiently to overcome immune perturbation by subsequent infection. The maintenance of antiviral status by X-31ca immunization is probably responsible for the successful inhibition of RSV, stabilizing against immune aggravation by RSV infection.",

As a control, wild type (WT) mice were treated under the same conditions (Figure 5B). Whereas X-31ca vaccination caused complete viral clearance in the lung of RSV-infected WT mice, RSV replication persisted in TLR3/7 KO mice despite vaccination with X-31ca. Together, these results suggest that TLR3- and TLR7-mediated innate immunity plays an important role in the early protection against RSV infection using X-31ca.",

Considering the substantial reduction in all-cause mortality with live attenuated vaccines, e.g., oral polio vaccine (OPV) and measles vaccines, the WHO has emphasized the need for more studies on the NSEs of vaccines (Author, 2014; Mina et al., 2015). However, potential short-term effects of vaccination have not been explored to date. In a previous study, immediate and indirect protection from respiratory illness was observed as part of the clinical evaluation of live influenza vaccination among children (Piedra et al., 2007).

X-31ca provided immediate protection against RSV infection in an antibody-independent manner in the mouse model. X-31ca vaccination stimulated the production of marker cytokines over the 6 days of examination, recruiting relevant immune cells. Cytokine profiles and immune cells were relatively unperturbed and were maintained even after RSV challenge. Experiments with KO mice confirmed that the innate immunity mediated by TLR3 and TLR7 was responsible for RSV protection. These results demonstrate that X-31ca administration prior to RSV challenge activated a much milder, but distinct, induction of cytokines and recruited more immune cells, and that these innate immune responses conferred early protection against RSV infection. Previously, influenza infection-mediated protection from RSV was evaluated in mice, and a long-lasting influence on subsequent responses to an additional infection was observed (Walzl et al., 2000). In contrast, the present analyses address the immediate response rather than a prolonged and delayed response upon influenza vaccination rather than infection. The present results in both trained and na\u00efve innate immune arms suggest that an indirect, non-specific protection operates on a wide spectrum.",

Notably, RSV challenge did not significantly alter the cytokine profiles of X-31ca-vaccinated mice (Figures 3A, 4B), suggesting that immunization activates and maintains a mild antiviral state in mice and protects them from acute perturbation of cytokine levels induced by RSV challenge. A proper innate response leads to viral clearance, whereas imbalanced responses can result in acute respiratory distress (Han and Ulevitch, 2005).

The RSV challenge did not significantly alter the cytokine profiles of X-31ca-vaccinated mice (Figures 3A, 4B), and IFN-\u03b3 was highly induced and maintained for several days after X-31ca vaccination (Figure 4C), thereby playing an important role in the short-term viral clearance. Moreover, NK cells are associated with viral clearance in the early phase of RSV infection (Harker et al., 2010), and probably also played a role in immediate protection in this study, as reflected in the increase of NK cells by vaccination (Figure 4C). More detailed studies, e.g., with KO mice or by depletion of specific immune cells, are required to identify the major components involved in these responses.",

We previously demonstrated that a TLR3 agonist alone induced a protective immune response and, in combination with a TLR7 agonist, achieved immediate and complete protection against lethal influenza infection (Seo et al., 2007). Vaccination of TLR3/7 KO mice with X-31ca failed to inhibit RSV replication (Figure 5A), further confirming that innate immune responses linked with the TLR3/7 pathway are responsible for the cross-protection against RSV. Notably, RSV replication was elevated but not fully recovered in vaccinated mice despite TLR3 and TLR7 deficiency (Figure 5A). Other PRRs such as RIG-I (Koyama et al., 2007) may still operate in TLR3/7 KO mice, partially compensating for the impaired innate immunity. Clearly, innate immune responses stimulated by CAIVs can protect the mucosal respiratory tract from RSV infection.",

            "text": "The potential safety issues of vaccination merit further discussion. As reflected in the lung viral titer, RSV replication was significantly inhibited by prior inoculation of X-31ca within 6 days (Figure 1C). The observed inhibition was achieved without significant changes in weight loss over 4\u20136 days. However, noticeable changes in weight loss (up to 10%) were apparent for shorter intervals (2 days) (Figure 1B), despite enhanced inhibition of RSV (Figure 1C). Previously, it was shown that increased recruitment of NK cells is involved in not only viral clearance but also weight loss (Harker et al., 2010). However, the apparent adverse effect of the increase in NK cell population (Figure 4C) could be counter-balanced by the potential beneficial effects associated with the changes in the cytokine profiles. For instance, the decrease in type I IFN by prior vaccination (Figure 4B) may reduce its potential adverse effect of increasing the susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections (Li et al., 2012). Prior vaccination with X-31ca (-2d) before RSV challenge transiently increased the number of eosinophils and neutrophils (Figure 4C and Supplementary Figure S5), which may be responsible for a complex inflammatory response underlying the observed weight loss in the same vaccination/challenge schedule (Figure 1B). The generalizability of these findings are limited, however, by the lack of a relevant animal model for influenza and RSV superinfection.",

It should be noted that, FluMist\u00ae, as a prototype CAIV, has been licensed for vaccination of individuals > 2 years of age. Most of the genetic mutations in CAIVs that attenuate of virulence are in internal genes (Snyder et al., 1988; Klimov et al., 1992; Jang et al., 2016), but CAIVs could be further attenuated by additional mutations either on surface antigens (Lee et al., 2016) or in internal genes (Liedmann et al., 2014), which could improve the safety profile of CAIVs for infants. A major distinction between the two attenuated strains is that FluMist\u00ae is based on the H2N2 strain (Baez et al., 1980; Maassab and DeBorde, 1985), whereas X-31ca is based on the H1N1 backbone (Lee et al., 2006). It would be interesting to determine, therefore, whether similar non-specific protection is provided by the licensed CAIV vaccine. Currently, the possibility of prime-boost-type early childhood vaccination is being debated with a view to implement a universal vaccine program (Krammer and Palese, 2014). With the future prospect of using CAIVs for infants, subject to safety issues associated with live vaccines, additional benefits may be anticipated, especially for non-specific protection from RSV and other respiratory viruses such as HPIVs, for which no licensed vaccines are available (Hall, 2001).",

            "text": "The present studies are based on a mouse model, and present potential limitations such as the lack of a common animal infection model among different virus families. It would be interesting to determine whether the observed non-specific protection could be further extended to a repertoire of respiratory viruses including MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which recently posed a global public threat (Breban et al., 2013; Choi, 2015). Moreover, most of the NSEs of vaccines have been evaluated in the clinical setting and monitored over the long-term (Kandasamy et al., 2016). Independent studies on the short-term NSEs of vaccinations would be impractical in the clinical setting, but could be implemented during the evaluation of the clinical effectiveness of vaccines (Piedra et al., 2007). The significance of NSEs observed in experimental animal infection remains to be explored further.",
