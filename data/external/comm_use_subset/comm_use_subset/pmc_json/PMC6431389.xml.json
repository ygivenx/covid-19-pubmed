ARDS is a multifactorial syndrome characterized by (i) new or worsening symptoms during 1 week, (ii) bilateral opacities (not fully explained by effusions, lobar/lung collapse, or nodules), (iii) the ratio of arterial oxygen tension to fraction of inspired oxygen less than 300 mm Hg with positive end-expiratory pressure or continuous positive airway pressure of 5 cm H2O or more, and (iv) no clinical evidence of heart failure or fluid overload [2]. It causes physiological alterations: alteration of pulmonary thoracic compliance, intra-lung shunt, and alveolar derecruitment responsible for severe hypoxemia, which can be generated or aggravated by invasive mechanical ventilation [3]. The causes of ARDS can be respiratory (infectious or inhalation pneumonitis) or extra respiratory (acute pancreatitis). In addition to etiological treatment, the implementation of a specific ventilation system with a low tidal volume (called protective) is essential for the management of ARDS [4]. The main complication is the progression to chronic pulmonary fibrosis.",

The chest X-ray on admission showed bilateral alveolar-interstitial syndrome with bilateral lower lobe consolidations (Figure 1), prompting spiramycin addition to her antibiotic treatment. Following a rapid deterioration in lung function under high-flow oxygen therapy, the patient was intubated (D+1) and transferred to the intensive care unit. The worsening clinical picture prompted antiviral treatment with oseltamivir (75 mg twice daily) in addition to ceftriaxone (2 g) and spiramycin (1.5 million units daily). Repeated samples were taken for bacteriological (i.e., protected brush sampling of mucus plugs, cytobacteriological examination of urine, blood culture, polymerase chain reaction, and antigenuria) and virological (e.g., polymerase chain reaction for influenza) investigations. The patient was treated with norepinephrine up to 0.5 microgramme.kg\u22121.min\u22121 for 24 hours because of hemodynamic instability.",

She had continued daily physical activity with satisfactory tolerance (30 minutes/day of treadmill walking and 15 minutes/day cycling at moderate intensity). Pulmonary function testing (PFT) revealed impaired alveolar-capillary transfer with a carbon monoxide diffusing capacity reduced to 3.93 mmol/(min\u2217kPa) (60% of the theoretical value).

The cardiopulmonary exercise test indicated normal aerobic fitness with a peak oxygen flow (VO2peak) of 20.4 mL.min\u22121.kg\u22121. The exercise intolerance appeared to be ventilatory in nature with low ventilatory reserve (RV = 6.3%), high respiratory quotient (RQ = 1.32), inappropriate hyperventilation (69 L.min\u22121) with high respiratory equivalents, significant desaturation on exertion, and a high alveolar-arterial gradient (8.1 kPa), consistent with ARDS sequelae.

The progression of histological lesions has been described as resulting in diffuse alveolar damage. During the acute exudative phase, an inflammatory process in the pulmonary alveoli causes the diffuse alveolar damage and generates disturbances in the alveolar-capillary permeability. During the fibroproliferative phase (between D+7 and D+14), a large amount of collagen is secreted by type II pneumocytes, causing remodeling of the interstitium and the alveolar spaces. The chronic phase is characterized by either pulmonary repair or the progression to fibrosis. It should be noted that these phases overlap [12], and the specificity of the syndrome is the loss of a compartmentalized inflammation response with the perpetuation of pulmonary aggression even when the initiating phenomenon has been controlled.",

At each consultation (3 in the first year and once a year thereafter), the patients were clinically examined, underwent a chest X-ray, PFT, a 6-minute walk test, and exercise oximetry, and responded to a quality of life questionnaire. The results indicated significantly low exercise tolerance with little distance covered during the walking test, reduced vital capacity, diffusion limitation in alveolar-capillary transfer capacity, and low quality of life scores. The physical and psychological sequelae persisted at 5 years, with a significant impact on the health-related quality of life. Usually, this long-term substantial reduction in health-related quality of life in surviving ARDS does not differ from findings in patients surviving other critical illness [14].

Thus, cardiopulmonary exercise test has not been repeated. However, it would have been interesting to accurately evaluate exercise tolerance from field tests. Field tests are low-cost, require little equipment, and are considered to be more reflective of daily living than cardiopulmonary exercise test [9]. In numerous respiratory diseases [9] and especially in ARDS [17], the most established is the 6-minute walk test. Nevertheless, it must be performed in an unobstructed 30-metre hallway [18], and such a space is rarely available in the patient's home, in the physician's office, or even in some respiratory medicine departments. Thus, to overcome this spatial limitation, a 6-minute stepper test has recently been proposed [19]. This exercise test requires only a limited amount of space and equipment and is feasible, valid, reproducible, and sensitive in patients with respiratory diseases [19, 20]. Consequently, this field exercise test might be recommended to evaluate tolerance exercise in ARDS survivors, when cardiopulmonary exercise test or 6-minute walk test is unavailable. Nevertheless, further studies are needed.",
