            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is an economically important disease of swine industry worldwide, which is characterized with respiratory illness in piglets and severe reproductive problems in sows and gilts [1,2]. PRRS was first reported in the United States in 1987 and in the Netherlands in 1991 [3]. The etiologic agent, PRRS virus (PRRSV), is an enveloped single-stranded positive sense RNA virus and is classified into the genus Arterivirus, family Arteriviridae, order Nidovirales [4]. The genome is approximately 15.4 kb in length and contains 10 open reading frames (ORFs), designated as ORF1a, ORF1b, and ORFs 2-7. ORFs 2-7 encode structural proteins including GP2a, GP2b, GP3, GP4, GP5, GP5a, M, and N protein, respectively. The replicative enzymes of PRRSV are encoded in ORF1a and ORF1b, which constitute almost 75% of the genome [1]. ORF1a and ORF1b encode polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, and expression of pp1ab depends on a ribosomal frameshift signal in the ORF1a/ORF1b overlap region [5]. At least 14 nonstructural proteins (nsp) are generated as a result of serial cleavages of pp1a and pp1ab, including nsp1a, nsp1\u03b2\uff0cnsp2, nsp2TF, nsp3, nsp4, nsp5, nsp6, nsp7, nsp8\uff0cnsp9\uff0cnsp10\uff0cnsp11\uff0cand nsp12 [1,6]. The processing of pp1a and pp1ab is believed to be mediated by accessory proteases, nsp1 and nsp2, and the main serine protease nsp4 [1]. Nsp4 serine protease is responsible for most of the nonstructural protein processing [7,8], and is a member of a relatively rare group of proteolytic enzymes, 3C-like serine proteases named after the picornavirus 3C protease [4,5,9]. The monomeric enzyme, nsp4, folds into three domains including two chymotrypsin-like \u03b2-barrel domains and an extra C-terminal \u03b1/\u03b2 domain, which are located at 1-69 amino acids (aa) (domains I), 89-153 aa (domains II), and 157-199 aa (domains III), respectively [8]. The active site of nsp4 is located between domains I and II, and contains a canonical catalytic triad of His39, Asp64, and Ser118 [8].",

Both caspase-8 and caspase-9 can activate caspase-3, a crucial effector caspase conducting the final execution steps of apoptosis program [10\u201312]. Besides, activated caspase-8 can also cause the cleavage of Bid to yield a truncated form, tBid [11,12]. tBid translocates to mitochondria to induce the release of cytochrome C, and then activate caspase-9, which is the crosstalk between the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways [11].",

Subsequently, a question has been raised: which viral component contributes to the apoptosis-inducing ability of PRRSV. GP5 has been reported to be an apoptosis inducer [20,21]. However, Lee et al [22] demonstrated that cells stably expressing GP5 did not show any characteristics of apoptosis. Thus, the viral proteins related to the PRRSV apoptosis-inducing ability remain unclear and are of huge interests in the field.",

The three mutant constructs were shown schematically in Figure 5A, and their expressions were confirmed by western blot analysis (Figure 5B). Next, we investigated the abilities of the deletion mutants to induce apoptosis in Hela cells. As shown in Figure 5C and Figure 5D, the apoptosis level declined remarkably in N69, MID, and C157-transfected cells compared to that in wide-type nsp4-transfected cells. In addition, with the double-labeling assay, we observed that wild-type and mutant nsp4 proteins were expressed with no significant differences (Figure 5E).

Nsp4 is a 3C-like serine protease that contains the canonical catalytic triad of His39\u2013Asp64\u2013Ser118. To assess the role of 3C-like serine protease activity in nsp4-triggered apoptosis, three single-point mutants were generated, including His39Ala (H39A), Asp64Ala (D64A), and Ser118Ala (S118A). The mutants were schematically shown in Figure 6A, and the protein expression of each mutant was confirmed using western blot analysis (Figure 6B). Subsequently, the apoptosis rates induced by each mutant were analyzed by flow cytometry using Annexin V/PI staining in Hela cells. As shown in Figure 6C and Figure 6D, the apoptosis rate induced by either H39A, D64A, or S118A mutant was significantly lower compared to that of wild-type nsp4 with a reduction of about 23.1%, 24.5%, and 50.1%, respectively. Double-labeling assay showed similar results (Figure 6E and Figure 6F), implying that His39, Asp64, and Ser118 were critical for nsp4 to induce apoptosis.",

NSP3'4 mutant protein was used as the substrate, which included the last 8 residues of nsp3 and the whole amino acid sequence of nsp4 with Ala substitution for Ser118. If the substrate had been cleaved at the nsp3 and nsp4 junction (E/G) by the active 3C-like protease, nsp3 moiety and nsp4 (Ser118 to Ala) moiety would be expected. As shown in Figure 6G, although NSP3'4 had the 3C-like protease sequence, autocatalytic cleavage did not occur because of the Ser118 to Ala mutation. Furthermore, the substrate was recognized and cleaved by wild-type nsp4, but not by any of the three nsp4 mutants (Figure 6G, lane 2, 3, 4, and 5). The mutation of His39, Asp64, or Ser118 to Ala caused a complete abolishment of nsp4 cleavage activity, demonstrating that His39, Asp64, and Ser118 were essential for nsp4 protease function.",

Like many other positive-strand RNA viruses, PRRSV-infection can induce cell apoptosis both in vivo and in vitro [26]. Evidence of apoptosis has been reported in alveolar macrophages, porcine intravascular monocytes, and lymphocytes in the lungs and lymph nodes of infected pigs, which might be responsible for the dramatic reduction in the number of these cells in PRRSV-infected pigs [19,26,27]. Furthermore, PRRSV could replicate in testicular germ cells and induce germ cell apoptosis in vivo [27]. Recently, apoptotic cells were found in B- and T-cell areas of lymphoid organs of infected pigs, as well as in fetal implantation sites at the late stage of gestation [28,29]. In agreement with these observations, we showed that PAMs infected with HP\u2013PRRSV HV strain exhibited characteristic of apoptosis. In addition, apoptosis was detected both in PRRSV-infected and the neighboring cells, which was consistent with the results published before. Apoptosis in uninfected bystander cells could be induced by the local release of cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 from infected cells [13,27]. An alternative mechanism could be that increased surface expression FasL on surrounding cells is induced by PRRSV infection, and these cells become sensitive to Fas-mediated apoptosis [24].",

In the current study, we presented evidence that PRRSV 3C-like protease nsp4 could induce apoptosis in Marc-145 cells and many other cell lines. Interestingly, apoptosis occurred both in nsp4-expressing cells and the surrounding cells, which is similar to the apoptotic phenomenon induced by PRRSV infection. The possibility that nsp4 induces the local release of cytokines (i.e., TNF-\u03b1), or the high expression of surface TNF receptor superfamily could not be excluded. Further investigation is required to explain the molecular mechanisms under this phenomenon. Of note, PRRSV nsp4-induced apoptosis represents the first report of 3C-like protease-mediated apoptosis in the genus Arterivirus, family Arteriviridae.",

Using deletion analysis, we showed that each of the three domains was essential for nsp4 to induce cell apoptosis. We also demonstrated that when the 3C-like protease activity of nsp4 was abolished by single-point mutation, the ability of nsp4 to induce apoptosis was significantly impaired. These results were in accordance with the previous report that protease activity was necessary for 3C protease of enterovirus 71 to induce apoptosis in human neural cells [31]. Furthermore, apoptosis was nearly absent in S118A-transfected cells, suggesting that Ser118 might be a more important factor for nsp4 to induce apoptosis. However, we need to indicate that separation of domains might destabilize the protein tertiary structure, resulting in loss of function. So it is hard to conclude the involvement of a particular domain of nsp4 in apoptosis.
