It is notifiable to the Office International des Epizooties (OIE). Clinically, the disease is characterized by severe pyrexia, oculonasal discharges, necrotizing and erosive stomatitis, enteritis, and pneumonia. It was first described in the Ivory Coast, West Africa, but has now become wide-spread in sub-Saharan Africa, Arabia, the Middle East, Southwest Asia, India, and other countries[1]. In China, PPR was first reported in Tibetin 2007[2], and in December 2013, a PPR outbreak was reported in Xinjiang Yili; in this outbreak,1236 goats were infected, of which 203 died, and6671 goats in the susceptible population were killed [3]. Thus, PPR outbreaks can cause severe economic losses, because they often result in high morbidity and mortality; therefore, development of an effective vaccine for the prevention and control of PPR is particularly important.",

Proteins N, P, and L are required for reconstituting viral RNA polymerase activity; M protein is required for particle formation and budding, and the two surface glycoproteins, H and F, are required for attachment and entry into the host cell. Structurally, the virions are morphologically pleomorphic particles that are surrounded by a host-derived membrane, modified by the H and F transmembrane glycoproteins, as well as the M protein, which is associated with the inner surface of the viral membrane[5], [6].As in other paramyxoviruses, the C protein of PPRV is expressed from an alternative open reading frame (ORF) within the P gene, whereas the V protein is expressed by RNA editing [7]. These two proteins are thought to be involved in viral evasion of the host's immune responses, specifically by blocking interferon production during infection [8].",

In India, three other live attenuated vaccines are currently licensed for use: Sungri 96, Arasur 87, and Coimbatore 97 [9]. However, a major disadvantage of these attenuated vaccines is that they cannot be used for differentiating infected from vaccinated animals(DIVA).Recently, subunit vaccines have been developed based on the incorporation of PPRV immunogens into various vector systems, such as sheep or goat pox, vaccinia virus, adenovirus, or baculovirus vectors [10], [11], [12], [13].",

As shown in Table 4, at 2 weeks after primary immunization, the titers of VNA in the PPRV-H VLPs- and PPRV-vaccinated goat groups exceeded 10, a number that represents a margin considered to be protective in goats vaccinated with live attenuated PPRV vaccines [22]. Moreover, this value was significantly enhanced after the booster immunization and reached values of 80\u2013160; these high VNA titers were maintained for at least 6 weeks, and decreased gradually from 15 weeks after primary immunization. The titer of the PPRV-F VLPs group was lower compared to that of the PPRV-H VLPs- and PPRV-vaccinated goat groups. However, 2weeks after the booster immunization, all the goats that had been immunized with PPRV-F VLPs showed VNA titers above 10.",

In this study, we found that the major structural genes of PPRV can be efficiently expressed in recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf21 insect cells and that these genes can then support the production of PPRV VLPs. The expression of M protein was necessary and sufficient for the formation of VLPs (data not shown); the additional expression of the H or F glycoproteins allowed formation of budding particles with the typical morphology and size of PPRV and related paramyxoviruses. A recent study demonstrated that PPRV spikeless VLPs could be formed by co-expression of the M and N proteins in insect cells; however, expression of M protein alone in insect cells did not result in VLP formation, as assessed by TEM [24], which was contrary to our results. The finding that M protein alone could be released from cells and generate VLPs has also been observed for some other paramyxoviruses, including human parainfluenza virus type1 [25], Sendai virus [26], Newcastle disease virus [27], and Nipha virus [28], as well as for viruses in other related virus families, including Ebola [29] and vesicular stomatitis virus [30].In addition, some paramyxovirus M proteins, such as parainfluenza virus type5 [31]and mumps virus [32], lack the ability to direct efficient VLP production when expressed alone in cells, but VLP production becomes highly efficient when M proteins are expressed together with other viral proteins. Hence, although the requirements for efficient VLP production differ among paramyxoviruses, it appears as if, in general, M protein is the major requirement for paramyxovirus VLP production, as VLPs cannot be formed in its absence [6], [33].",

However, in this study, the molecular size of the expressed F protein was 70 kDa, but the F protein was cleaved into F1 and F2 protein upon expression in mammalian cells; the results indicated that there are differences in the post-translational modification in the two expression systems. Furthermore, insect cells are able to grow in serum-free medium cultures; this is highly desirable, because serum may be a cause of adventitious viruses. Therefore, its use requires more intensive purification processes to remove serum proteins. Additionally, these cells are perfectly adapted to suspension conditions, allowing for large-scale culture [37], [38].

            "text": "For many viruses, recombinant VLPs have been shown to yield promising vaccines, because of their robust immunogenicity, elicitation of protective neutralizing antibodies (due to the presence of conformational epitopes on VLPs), and their safety profiles (as they do not contain any viral genetic material). In this study, the effectiveness of PPRV VLPs as an immunogen was demonstrated in mice and goats. The results indicated that high specific antibody titers against PPRV could be induced by both PPRV-H VLPs and PPRV-F VLPs, which were as high as those resulting from immunization with PPRVNig75/1. The VNA titers elicited by PPRV-H VLPs were much higher than those induced by PPRV-F VLPs, and the VNA titers of PPRV-H VLPs were as high as the responses to the attenuated virus vaccine. Previous reports have shown that the H protein of PPRV is a more potent inducer of high VNA titers than the F protein[11], while the F protein seems to induce mainly a cellular immune response[43].Our results demonstrated that mice immunized with PPRV-H and PPRV-F VLPs exhibited a similarly high level of cell-mediated immune responses.",

            "text": "We further showed that subcutaneous immunization of mice with PPRV-H VLPs at a dose of 10 \u00b5g, in the absence of adjuvant, induced strong humoral immune responses. This immunogenicity is related to the structural features of the VLPs, which are particulate structures that contain a dense and repetitive pattern of epitopes on their surfaces. In contrast, monovalent, non-particulate antigens do not always reflect the native structure of the protein, and the related antibody responses are not always specific for physiologically relevant epitopes. Consequently, administration of these vaccines often requires use of strong adjuvants, as well as large and frequent doses of the antigen. In contrast, VLP-based vaccines are strongly immunogenic, often reducing or eliminating the need for exogenous adjuvants[44], [45]. An additional benefit of this VLP-vaccination approach is that it may allow improved surveillance through DIVA, as seroconversion to N protein will occur only in animals that have been infected with PPRV, but not in VLP-vaccinated animals that have not been infected. A commercially available N protein-based competitive ELISA kit might strengthen the usefulness of VLP vaccines[46]. We also detected PPRV-specific antibodies in the vaccinated goats, using an N protein-based competitive ELISA established in our laboratory. No N protein-specific antibodies were found in goats vaccinated with PPRV H or PPRV F VLPs; in contrast, seroconversion to N protein was detected in goats vaccinated with the PPRV Nig 75/1 attenuated virus (data not shown).",

Taken together, the results of our study suggested that PPRV VLPs can be generated in insect cells simultaneously expressing the PPRV M protein with H or F protein. The VLPs had a morphology and size similar to those of native virus particles. Humoral and cellular immunity against PPRV were efficiently induced in mice and goats vaccinated with these PPRV VLPs, without the need for adjuvants. Thus, PPRV-H VLPs or PPRV-F VLPs may be promising vaccine candidates for PPR, and DIVA tests may prove of great benefit in future control programs for this disease.",
