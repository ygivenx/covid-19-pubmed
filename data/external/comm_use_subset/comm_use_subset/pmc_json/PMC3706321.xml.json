Clustering of proteins in caveolae provides an environment and a mechanism for controlling probabilities of protein interaction and modulating the efficiency of signal transduction. For example, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been shown to interact with caveolin [9] and changes in receptor clustering may provide a mechanism for regulating EGFR signaling [10]. In addition, caveolae are exploited by some viruses to initiate infection [11], [12], whereas other viruses enter cells without the involvement of caveolae [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]. For example, Damm et al.\n[15] observed that when introduced to cells devoid of caveolae, SV40 exploits an alternative, cav-1\u2013independent pathway in the absence of caveolae. Ewers et al. [18], used transmission electron microscopy to demonstrate that SV40 induced the formation of membrane invaginations in the absence of caveolar coats. It has also been determined that ebola virus can fully infect cell types lacking caveolae [14] and that SARS coronavirus entry was mediated by a clathrin- and caveolae-independent mechanism [16].",

Fluorescence photoactivation localization microscopy (FPALM) (Figure S1) [31], [32] is a novel, super resolution technique that extends the resolution of optical microscopy below the diffraction limit, which is on the order of 250 nm, allowing for spatial resolution on the scale of 20\u201340 nm [31], [32], [33]. Three-dimensional FPALM has achieved a lateral resolution of 30 nm and 75 nm axially [34]. FPALM is well suited for investigation, at the single molecule level, of the highly complex molecular structures and mechanisms underlying biological processes.",

Our results suggest that CRFB1 interacts with caveolae and that caveolae may be critical for maintaining spatial organization and clustering of CRFB1 molecules. The present study demonstrates a novel role for cav-1b-containing membrane domains in the zebrafish response to viral infection. We demonstrate that upon virus infection, cav-1 is downregulated, circumventing the host antiviral IFN response. In vivo knockdown studies showed that disruption of the IFN response by cav-1 depletion renders the host more susceptible to infection. Using FPALM, we show that cav-1b-containing membrane domains corral CRFB1 molecules together and that this clustering of CRFB1 is critical for a robust antiviral immune response. In addition, we determined that the membrane protein Cav-1 is responsible for maintaining the CRFB1 clustering and that the functional consequence of Cav-1 depletion is CRFB1 dispersion and abrogation of downstream signaling. By gaining an understanding of the complex dynamics of membrane domains and the mechanisms through which viruses modulate their function, we will better understand how viruses evade host antiviral mechanisms and can implement this knowledge to develop more targeted therapeutics.",

To test whether CRFB1 localizes to cav-1b-containing membrane domains, FPALM was used to simultaneously image CRFB1-dendra2 and Cav-1b-PAmCherry 24 h after transfection of zebrafish liver (ZFL) cells. ZFL cells express endogenous cav-1b and CRFB1 mRNA (Figure S2a), as do rat liver cells [35], liver sinusoidal cells [36] and primary rat hepatocytes [37]. Figure 1 illustrates that at the surface of a single cell, CRFB1 colocalizes with Cav-1b. Acquisition conditions and more details about FPALM imaging and analysis are described in the Methods section and Figure S1. These data were acquired in the absence of ligand stimulation and show that clusters of Cav-1b molecules are in very close proximity to CRFB1 molecules, and in many instances overlap within the estimated spatial resolution of the technique (\u223c20 nm). To quantitatively explore this result, pair correlation analysis was performed for CRFB1 and Cav-1b (Figure 1c). Pair correlation between the two species had a g(r) value greater than one, which implies that the two molecules are not randomly distributed, and instead, are colocalized. Additionally, when Cav-1b is knocked down in ZFL cells using a previously characterized morpholino oligonucleotide (MO) [2], the clustering of CRFB1 is significantly decreased, with a more random distribution than observed in controls (Figure 1d).",

Further, the presence of caveolae in zebrafish has been confirmed via electron microscopy [2]. Compared to Cav-1a, Cav-1b in the zebrafish is more similar to Cav-1b in human and mouse, and in previous studies the two isoforms have been shown to have non-redundant roles [2]. Our studies revealed that although cav-1a gene expression was also downregulated after SHRV infection (Figure S3a), the effect was not as pronounced, nor was it as long lasting as the downregulation of cav-1b gene expression (Figure 2a). Furthermore, when compared to controls, knockdown of Cav-1b resulted in greater mortality than knockdown of Cav-1a after SHRV infection (Figure S3b), leading us to focus our subsequent studies on Cav-1b.",

In order to confirm that during viral infection general suppression of all host gene expression did not occur, zebrafish \u03b2-actin primers were used to normalize the initial quantity of RNA, as previously described [38]. To confirm these results, the 18S housekeeping gene was also used to normalize the gene expression in the RT-PCR experiments. The 18S gene has been previously characterized in the zebrafish and shown to be stable during development and across tissue types [22], [23], [39]. The 18S gene was selected due to its high, relatively stable expression levels. If viral infection globally affected gene expression, then 18S would also be influenced. However, similar results (data not shown) were obtained when 18S primers were used to normalize the quantity of RNA.",

Figure 2d demonstrates that at 24 hpi in control MO-injected embryos Cav-1 protein was still detected, while in Cav-1b MO-injected embryos no Cav-1 protein was found. Western blot analysis of age-matched SHRV infected embryos detected endogenous Cav-1 protein at lower levels than in Control MO embryos, but greater than in the Cav-1b MO samples. This result shows effective knockdown of Cav-1b protein expression by morpholino injection (Figure 2d). These experiments were performed using whole embryo lysates, and so in order to more thoroughly understand the results, we sought to identify tissues in which Cav-1b is expressed. We examined cell type-specific pools of cDNA from adult zebrafish. Of particular interest, cav1b expression was detected in liver, kidney, lymphocyte, and myeloid lineages (Figure S2c).

Kaplan-Meier curves [41] were constructed showing survival of Cav-1b morphants compared to controls after viral challenge, and revealed that Cav-1b morphant embryos exhibited a significant increase in mortality (p = 0.009) compared to the controls (Figure 2b). Uninfected control morphants had low levels of mortality, similar to that of uninjected controls. Cav-1b morphants showed increased mortality throughout the first three days post infection. After just 24 hpi, over 70% of the Cav-1b morphants had succumbed to the infection compared to \u223c40% of control infected embryos. Controls and Cav-1b morphants that were uninfected both had \u223c90% or greater survival rates. Since the adaptive immune response is not fully developed in zebrafish at the developmental stage selected for these studies [24], [42], [43], the results are due solely to perturbation of the innate immune response.",

From 0\u201312 hpi, no significant increase in viral burden was observed between control and cav-1b MO embryos, which were infected at 48 hpf (and therefore 48 h after MO injection).

            "text": "Type I IFN belongs to a class of cytokines that play a crucial role in the innate immune response to viral infection [47], [48]. Molecular patterns such as viral double stranded RNA are detected by PRR [49], [50], resulting in production of IFN and antiviral proteins. In zebrafish, as in mammals, IFN molecules interact with the IFN-R subunits [50], [51], which exist as heterodimeric complexes [24], [25]. The janus kinase and signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling pathway is highly conserved evolutionarily, and it is believed that in zebrafish, Stat transduces signals through a classical JAK-STAT pathway [52]. Briefly, the JAK-STAT pathway becomes active upon IFN binding to IFN-R, but two discrete IFN pathways activate JAK-STAT: IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3. It is possible to measure components upstream from ISRE or MxA, such as STAT phosphorylation, but nonspecific contributions from the IFN-\u03b3 pathway can occur, making it difficult to discriminate between the JAK-STAT contributions of the two pathways. It has been hypothesized that the IFN-\u03b3 response is attenuated due to reduced levels of Stat1 in the IFN-R knockout [53]. To investigate whether a reduced level of Stat1 gene expression also contributed to a dampened IFN response in our current studies, Stat1 transcripts were measured by qRT-PCR after Cav-1b depletion. A decrease in Stat1 gene expression was observed at 24 hpi (Figure 3a) as a result of Cav-1b depletion. We further demonstrate that CRFB1 is dispersed and that downstream MxA signaling can be restored by maintaining CRFB1 clusters (Figure 6). This indicates that the clustering of CRFB1 is critical for an antiviral response. Cav-1b-containing membrane domains appear to corral the receptor molecules, thus providing an environment conducive to efficient signal transduction.",

In contrast, IFNAR and IFNGR distribution in HeLa cells showed that only IFNGR complexes could be found in DRMs after stimulation [54]. The significance of protein associations with lipid rafts must therefore be re-evaluated and interpreted with caution. In our studies, we use ZFL cells, in which the endogenous expression levels of cav-1b have been confirmed (data not shown). Localization of IFN receptors in cav-1b-containing membrane domains by microscopy is likely to yield less equivocal results than biochemical DRM isolation. Our study yields images through the use of FPALM, which circumvents the resolution limit imposed by optical diffraction in conventional light microscopy.",

            "text": "Membrane structure and organization are important for many signaling processes. In this study, CRFB1 clustering in cells was examined and the results provided insights into the dynamic behavior of this receptor. Super-resolution imaging with FPALM showed that CRFB1 clustering is mediated by cav-1b-containing membrane domains and that disruption of such domains results in dispersal of receptor molecules. The consequence of CRFB1 dispersal was a dampened antiviral response. Studies were performed using either poly(I:C) stimulation or SHRV infection, both of which will induce IFN, the ligand that will bind to CRFB1 and stimulate it. It is important to note that the crosslinking reagent is non-specific and may impact cellular function because it crosslinks everything on the cell surface, not just cav-1 or CRFB1 molecules. We tested for non-specific crosslinking effects by also depleting CRFB1/2/5 and demonstrated that nonspecific induction of MxA due to crosslinking of other cellular components does not occur. We also rescued CRFB1 clustering through exogenous plasmid expression of cav-1b and found that after SHRV infection, expression levels of MxA remained essentially equal to controls (Figure 6b), similar to results seen in Figure 6a. MxA was measured because it is a selective and quantitative indicator of antiviral activity that is produced through induction of the IFN pathway. Taken together our data demonstrate that viral infection is exacerbated due to the reduced ability of Cav-1b morphant embryos to clear the infection resulting from the dispersal of CRFB1 and subsequent decrease in Stat1 gene expression, ISRE activation, and MxA induction.",

            "text": "Our results contrast with the conclusions of many studies demonstrating that viruses use caveolae as a method of entry [55], [56], [57], but not as a means to alter the host immune response. Others have observed virus infections that do not use caveolae as a method of entry [13], [14], [15], [17], but did not necessarily study the role of caveolae in the antiviral immune response. We took a novel approach and discovered that SHRV downregulates Cav-1 expression to disrupt the host antiviral response. Many viruses in a range of species have developed mechanisms to target and evade the IFN system [58], [59], [60]. The studies outlined here reveal that viruses can escape the antiviral immune response by downregulating cav-1b protein levels, leading to a disruption of antiviral signaling through dispersion of IFN-R and abrogation of downstream signal transduction. We assessed the virus induced downregulation of cav-1b compared to the morpholino depletion of cav-1b and found that viral infection alone is enough to decrease cav-1b protein levels and dampen ISRE activity (Figures 2d and 3, respectively). Taken together, these studies support the hypothesis that cav-1b-containing membrane domains provide the local environment for interaction of critical antiviral receptor molecules. Additionally, these studies have demonstrated that Cav-1b is responsible for maintaining CRFB1 clusters and have shown the functional consequences of Cav-1 knockdown. From these observations, it is postulated that cav-1b-containing membrane domains increase CRFB1 signaling efficiency by concentrating receptor molecules so that proteins remain at the site of signaling. There have been several studies of immunity in zebrafish that demonstrate similarities to immune function in higher vertebrates [22], [23], [27], [28], [42], [61]. In addition, a publically available microarray database (European Bioinformatics Institute\u2019s Gene Expression Atlas, part of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory; http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/) was used to identify downregulation of cav-1 in humans after infection with viruses such as HSV and HIV. Our identification of a cav-1 binding domain in human IFN-R, together with the high degree of functional conservation between the immune system of zebrafish and higher vertebrates, suggests that our studies are relevant to immunity in higher vertebrates. FPALM studies provided critical insight into the mechanisms of viral evasion and modulation of membrane domains that are critical to the host immune response to virus infection. Understanding the complex mechanisms through which viruses modulate immune function should provide insight into a range of potential targeted antiviral therapies.",
