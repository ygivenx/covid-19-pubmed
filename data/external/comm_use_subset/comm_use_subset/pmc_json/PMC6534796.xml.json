The use of personal protective equipment by health care workers is one of the most crucial measures to protect them against diseases. In this regard, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) proposed the N95 respirator masks in order to prevent the spread of infection through the air (1, 2). The N95 respirator masks are compressed facial masks, so that they should be fixed on the face to provide respiratory protection (3). A significant concern in the use of these masks is their reliability to impede the contaminant transport to an individual\u2019s breathing tract. This depends upon the degree of adaptation and appropriateness of the respirator mask for the mask wearer (4).",
