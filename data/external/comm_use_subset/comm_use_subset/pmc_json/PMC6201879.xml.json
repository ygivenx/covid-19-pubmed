            "text": "Niclosamide was originally developed and marketed as a molluscicide by Bayer in the late 1950s; it was later found to be an effective anti-helmintic and has been used in the clinic for decades to treat intestinal tapeworm infections in humans [1, 2]. Niclosamide exerts its anti-helmintic effect by uncoupling the electron transport chain from ATP synthase preventing the synthesis of ATP, an essential energy molecule for cell metabolism [3, 4]. Historically, the use of mitochondrial uncouplers in humans has been avoided due to their low therapeutic index [5]. Indeed, the best known mitochondrial uncoupler, 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) increases metabolic rate and stimulates loss of body fat but has been associated with severe toxicity including fatal increases in body temperature [5\u20137]. This side effect may be overcome by liver specific targeting of DNP which has been shown to improve its therapeutic index up to 50-fold [8]. In contrast to DNP, niclosamide has been shown to be relatively safe when delivered as a single 2-gram oral dose to treat intestinal cestode infections. This is largely due to its poor absorption from the gastrointestinal tract and high plasma protein binding that significantly limit its tissue distribution [1]. On the other hand, this also limits the usefulness of niclosamide to treat other diseases where systemic exposure is required. Several other studies have linked niclosamide treatment to genotoxic effects as measured by increased sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and chromosome aberrations (CA) in bone marrow cells or sperm head abnormalities in mice [9, 10]. Niclosamide also generates point mutations in Salmonella sp and clastogenic effects in human lymphocytes [9, 10]. Therefore, while niclosamide has been shown to be relatively safe after a single dose, it is unclear if chronic treatment with niclosamide would lead to adverse effects.",

            "text": "Despite possible concerns over bioavailability and genotoxicity, interest in niclosamide has risen dramatically over recent years, concomitant with the movement towards repurposing approved drugs. Indeed, niclosamide has been identified in several screens as a compound with broad anti-cancer activity. This has been attributed to its ability to regulate multiple cellular signaling pathways frequently dysregulated in cancer biology including nuclear factor-\u03baB, JAK1-STAT3, Wnt/Beta Catenin, Wnt/Frizzeld1, mTORC1/AMPK and NOTCH [11\u201317]. Niclosamide has also been proposed as a treatment of a variety of other indications including neuropathic pain, bacterial and viral infections and metabolic disease [11, 14, 18\u201322]. We also identified niclosamide in a high throughput screen focused on identifying modulators of non-classical peroxisome biogenesis with potential for alleviating the symptoms of dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome [23]. Two salt forms of niclosamide with improved solubility, Niclosamide ethanolamine salt (NEN) and Niclosamide Piperazine (NPP) have been shown to attenuate hepatic steatosis and glucose metabolism in murine models of high fat diet (HFD) induced obesity and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) [3, 23, 24]. However, the mechanism for niclosamide\u2019s beneficial effect on hepatic steatosis and whole-body glucose metabolism remains unclear. Such effects may be mediated by mild mitochondrial uncoupling, increased energy expenditure and increased lipid metabolism, or the ability of niclosamide and NEN to block hepatic glucagon signaling pathway [3, 25]. Regardless of the underlying mechanism, when compared to niclosamide, NEN and NPP have improved oral bioavailability and retain activity in mouse models of T2D and metabolic disease [3, 24]. Moreover, despite their mild mitochondrial uncoupling activity, both are well tolerated in vivo and do not appear to exert any adverse effects on body temperature [3]. To our knowledge, the effect of these salt forms of niclosamide on genotoxicity have not been reported, however, we anticipate that both salts would be similarly genotoxic as niclosamide.",

Cell level data was analyzed in JMP12 (SAS, Cary NC). Hundreds of primary features per cell were generated based on the intensity measurements and morphological characteristics. We employed a Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression analysis method to identify the most important cellular features and reduced the data set to a single scoring system that is tolerant to outliers for hepatic steatosis [29].

Following stimulation and lipid accumulation, cells were fixed and labeled with HCS LipidTOX green neutral lipid stain and the cell-permeant nuclear counterstain Hoechst-33342. Images of labeled cells were captured on a Cellomics/Thermofisher CX5 automated high-content microscope using an Olympus 20X LWD/0.7NA objective. Images of unstimulated and stimulated cells were collected and automated image analysis was performed to tabulate the cellular lipid content (green channel) and total cell count (blue channel).

Therefore, we hypothesized that by removing the nitro group we may disrupt the mitochondrial uncoupling activity of niclosamide.

Compounds were considered active if they exhibited >45% effect in the DNL assay and if they displayed a sigmoidal dose response. Of those tested, 52 compounds were designated as active. Fig 2 shows data from 11 representatives of the N-substituted phenylbenzamide class. The predicted solubility at pH 7.4, clogP and cLogD values and IC50 for each derivative are shown. We compared the IC50 of each of the 11 compounds with that of niclosamide. 500873, 600494 and 600489 were found to be significantly more potent than niclosamide, with IC50 values of 0.005, 0.004 and 0.01\u03bcM respectively. In contrast, 600657 was by far the least potent compound with an IC50 of 1.6mM. Of note, several of the compounds including 500200 and 500873 produced inverse concentration curves.

Verapamil performed as expected as assessed by the percentage of the initial concentration of compound remaining after 1 hour with only 7.5% and 4.5% remaining after 60 min in HLM and MLM preparations respectively. In general, all other compounds exhibited good microsomal stability. As anticipated, compounds were more stable in MLM relative to HLM. 600494 exhibited the greatest metabolic stability with 99.4% and 109.6% of the initial concentration remaining after 60 minutes in HLM and MLM respectively. Similarly, 84.5% and 101.2% of the starting material remained after 60 minutes in HLM and MLM respectively for 500200. On the other hand, 600453 and 500873 were stable in MLM, but in HLM only 58.8% and 64.2% of the initial concentration remained after 60 minutes (Table 1). Of the compounds reported here, only 600489 was found to be completely degraded after 60 min with 3.1% remaining in HLM and 2.7% remaining in MLM.",

In a previous study, a 5mg/kg oral dose of niclosamide in rats leads to a peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of 354ng/ml and half-life of 6.7 hours [45]. Three of the four phenylbenzamide derivatives had significantly improved oral bioavailability compared to niclosamide. Indeed, a single oral dose of 5mg/kg of 600453 formulated in PBS gave a peak plasma concentration of 2050ng/ml in rats with the half-life of 3.9 hours which correlated to 64%F. Similarly, oral administration of 600494 led to a peak plasma concentration of 1850ng/ml and 5.3-hour half-life and 14%F while, 500873 reached a peak of 912ng/ml and 3.3-hour half-life resulting in 10%F (Table 2). Therefore, by selectively modifying the phenylbenzamide functional groups, we were able to significantly improve the bioavailability by up to 30 times that of niclosamide. The half-lives (t1\u22152) of 600453 and 600494 in rats were 3.9 and 4.6 hours respectively and greater than 1.5 hours more than that reported for NEN in mice[3, 46]. These values remain high enough to be suitable for advancement to clinical development.",

Compared to sham animals that had blood glucose levels of 350mg/dL at 60 minutes niclosamide treated animals exhibited statistically significant reduction in glucose levels to 250mg/dL (Fig 6A). Overall niclosamide reduced plasma glucose levels from approximately 400mg/dL to 275mg/dL over the 7-day period (Fig 6B).

Sham animals were administered vehicle on the same schedule. To determine if AMPK is activated in vivo in response to niclosamide we measured p-AMPK Thr-172, as phosphorylation at this site is absolutely required for AMPK activity and widely used in the AMPK field as a surrogate for kinase activity [51, 52]. AMPK was significantly upregulated in vivo by low and high doses of niclosamide (Fig 6C). We also observed a significant reduction in the expression of fatty acid synthase (FAS) at the highest concentration of niclosamide (Fig 6C). It is of interest to note that in previous studies we also identified carbonic anhydrase-III (CAIII) as a hepatic protein altered in HFD fed-DIO mice that was down regulated by niclosamide treatment and positively correlates with the extent of ectopic lipid accumulation [31].",

To compare the ability of the novel benzamides to improve hepatic steatosis, 60%-fat fed DIO mice were treated with niclosamide or one if its derivatives for 12 days and the livers were immediately examined for changes in gross morphology. With the exception of liver from 500832 treated animals, all livers from treated animals showed improvements in morphology within 12 days. The livers of treated animals became darker red in color compared to the sham HFD-fed animals, which were visibly lighter and tan in color due to ectopic fat accumulation. Histological analysis of the lower left lobe from all treated mice showed an improvement in macro- and micro- steatosis within 12 days, with the exception of mice treated with 500832. The pattern of steatosis was also altered, with animals treated with niclosamide and 500199 being almost completely cleared of steatosis. Most notably, clearance of lipids was observed predominately from zone-1 in 500199 treated animals. Representative images of liver tissues from mice fed standard chow (10% fat diet) or HFD\u2013fed animals (60% HFD) treated with niclosamide, 500199 or Sham animals are shown in Fig 7A\u20137D. The steatosis score was used to evaluate the livers, scoring microvesicular or macrovesicular steatosis and fatty infiltration zonality [32]. Niclosamide treated animals had variable degrees of steatosis ranging from 15\u201370% with a mean steatosis of 45% and a steatosis score of 2.0 (Table 4). In contrast, sham animals typically had greater than 70% steatosis resulting in a steatosis score of 3.0 (Table 4). Similar to niclosamide, 600453 and 500199 reduced the mean percentage of steatosis to 38% and 19% respectively resulting in a steatosis score of 1. Other analogs including 600489 (24% steatosis), 500200 (28% steatosis), 500873 (28% steatosis), and 600494 (25% steatosis) also exhibited reduced steatosis with a score of 1.25 (Table 4). In some cases, livers more closely resembled livers from standard chow fed mouse with \u22645% steatosis despite being maintained on the HFD during the 12 days of treatment. 600653 and 500832 had a more modest effect on hepatic steatosis compared to other phenylbenzamides tested and these had a steatosis score of 1.75 and 2.75 respectively.",

While the exact mechanism underlying niclosamide\u2019s therapeutic effect remains unclear, both studies appear to associate the anti-hyperglycemic effect with the ability of niclosamide and its salts to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation. This finding is supported by the observations that sulfonate conjugated niclosamide (SCN), a derivative of NEN containing a sulfonate conjugate at the 2-hydroxyl site essential for mitochondrial uncoupling, failed to improve hyperglycemia in vivo. This finding led the authors to conclude that mitochondrial uncoupling is required for anti-hyperglycemic activity [3]. Unfortunately, the study did not address the effect of SCN on hepatic steatosis and it remains to be determined whether SCN or other niclosamide derivatives that do not uncouple oxidative phosphorylation or stimulate cellular respiration can improve hepatic steatosis through an independent pathway. Consistent with this idea, Mook et. al., recently showed that inhibition of Wnt/B-catenin signaling induced by niclosamide analogs can be separated from uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation and alterations in cellular ATP [54].",

Mechanistically this may lead to increased energy expenditure and lipid oxidation as well as lower levels of cAMP that are required for PKA mediated hepatic glucagon signaling [3, 25]. Interestingly, differences in both energy expenditure and body weight were reported in response to niclosamide and its salts. Tao et. al., reported increased energy expenditure and reduction in body weight while Chowdhury et. al., observed no changes in body weight or energy expenditure but rather, attributed the anti-hyperglycemic effect to decreased hepatic glucose production as a result of the ability of niclosamide to block glucagon signaling in the liver.

While we did not directly test uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation in isolated mitochondria, increased oxygen consumption has been observed with niclosamide, NEN and NPP at sub-micromolar concentrations [3, 24, 25].

Such compounds could provide new options to treat a diverse set of indications, including NAFLD, diabetes and metabolic disease, viral infection and a variety of cancers. Herein we report the bioavailability of several compounds has been improved by achieving a balance between the polar, hydrophilic carboxylic acid group and the non-polar, lipophilic tert-butyl group as exemplified in 500200 and 600453. The half-life of niclosamide is 6.7 hours [56]. Several of the phenylbenzamides reported in this study show both improved oral bioavailability and a half-life of greater than 4 hours suggesting they could be amenable to a once daily oral delivery. Furthermore, a number of the compounds reported herein have greater cLogP values and significantly improved cLogD values as compared to niclosamide. For instance, the introduction of more polar surface area with the methoxy group in 600657 gives a cLogD of -0.33. Niclosamide and NEN accumulate predominately in the liver. Further studies will be needed to explore how these differences affect the tissue distribution and plasma protein binding of the compounds reported in this study. Niclosamide also has a potentially toxic aromatic nitro group and in all of the newly reported compounds, the group has been replaced with a carboxylic acid moiety with retention of activity in our assays.",

It is a highly-conserved serine threonine kinase that regulates cellular metabolism. The most characterized AMPK downstream target, acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC), is a rate-limiting enzyme in energy consumptive de novo fatty acid synthesis, and ACC is directly inhibited by AMPK phosphorylation to conserve cellular energy. Niclosamide and NEN have both been shown to activate AMPK in a dose and time-dependent manner resulting in an increase in ACC phosphorylation and inhibition of mitochondrial beta oxidation. Therefore, it is possible that by activating AMPK the compounds described herein could increase lipid oxidation through downstream phosphorylation and inhibition of ACC and mitochondrial beta oxidation.",

This may suggest that these compounds act primarily through uncoupling mitochondria leading to activation of the AMPK pathway and to increased lipid oxidation, similar to niclosamide and its salt forms. In contrast, we also identified several compounds that attenuated hepatic steatosis (500200, 600657, and 600489) in the absence of changes in the oxygen consumption rate and activation of the AMPK pathway in vitro. It may be possible that these compounds work through a, as yet undetermined but distinct mechanism. Irrespective of the mechanism of action, all of these compounds showed efficacy in the HFD-fed obese mouse model and attenuated hepatic lipid accumulation.",

In an effort to identify novel compounds with better preclinical properties that retain in vivo efficacy for the treatment of hepatic steatosis and NAFLD, we synthesized a series of novel N-substituted phenylbenzamide derivatives of the niclosamide chemotype. This study describes a series of novel phenylbenzamide derivatives with improved physicochemical and pharmacokinetic characteristics that attenuate hepatic steatosis in vitro and in vivo for the treatment of fatty liver and NAFLD. Furthermore, our data suggest that the compounds might be separated into two groups those that increased respiration and stimulated activation of the AMPK pathway and those that do not. Both groups were equally as effective in attenuating hepatic steatosis in vitro and in vivo suggesting the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation is not required for the treatment of hepatic steatosis. In particular, we identified 600453 as a N-substituted phenylbenzamide that has good oral bioavailability and half-life, lacks genotoxicity, and does not stimulate respiration in cells. This suggest that this compound may be a good candidate for further clinical development for fatty liver disease.",
