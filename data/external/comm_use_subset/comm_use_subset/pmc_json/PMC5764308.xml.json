PEVs were originally classified into 13 types (PEV-1 to PEV-13) on the basis of virus neutralization assay results [2\u20133]. After further genomic studies, PEV-1 to -7 and PEV-11 to -13 have been reclassified and assigned to the genus Teschovirus and PEV-8, formally belonging to PEV-A, has been renamed porcine sapelovirus 1 and reclassified into the genus Sapelovirus [1, 4\u20136]. PEV-B, consisting of PEV-9 and -10, was reclassified as enterovirus G (EV-G). PEV-9 and -10, the prototypical EV-Gs isolated in 1973 and 1975 in UK, were renamed as EV-G1 and EV-G2, respectively [1, 7]. Currently, 16 EV-G genotypes are known to exist in Hungary, South Korea, the USA, China, Vietnam, and Belgium [8\u201315].",

Very recently, the unique EV-Gs that have a papain-like cysteine protease sequence (PL-CP) in the 2C\u20133A junction region of their genomes were identified in fecal samples from three independent cases of porcine diarrhea in the USA and Belgium [24\u201326]. The PL-CP has sequence identity to that of toroviruses (which are members of the order Nidovirales), in the ORF1a region. The PL-CP of nidoviruses acts as a protease to cleave peptide bonds and as a deubiquitinase to cleave the isopeptide bonds in polyubiquitin chains [27\u201329]. Viral deubiquitinases can remove the protective effect of attached ubiquitin-like molecules such as the protein encoded by interferon stimulated gene 15. These viral protease and deubiquitinase activities can modulate or block activation of the innate immune response [29\u201331]. EV-G PL-CP also shows strong deubiquitination and deISGylation activities and is thought to influence enteroviral genome plasticity and viral pathogenesis by acting as an innate-immunity antagonist [25].",

Briefly, total RNA was extracted directly from the supernatant of a 10% fecal suspension by means of the TRIzol LS Reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and treated with DNase I (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan). cDNA libraries for next-generation sequencing were built using the NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. Sequencing was carried out on a MiSeq bench-top sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), using 151 pair-end reads. Contigs were generated from trimmed sequence reads by de novo assembly, and the generated contigs were evaluated by means of mapping reads to a reference command in CLC Genomics Workbench with strictest parameter settings (mismatch cost, 2; insertion cost, 3; deletion cost, 3; length function, 0.9; and similarity function, 0.9), and 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 sequences with insufficient read depth (<3) were discarded.",

One strain named Ishi-Ka2 branched independently and did not cluster with any reference strains (Fig 1). Because >25% difference in complete VP1 nt sequences between isolates is a criterion for genotype classification [13\u201314], a pairwise comparison of complete VP1 nt sequences was conducted (Table 3 and S1 Table). Bu6-5, Bu8-2, Bu8-4, and Ishi-Ya4-2 formed one cluster but were found to be slightly related to the G3 group. Although complete VP1 nt sequence identities of these strains to those of other G3 strains (except for Ishi-Ka3, Ishi-Ka3-1, Ishi-Ka4, Ishi-Ka5-1, Ishi-Ka6, and Ishi-Ka7) were <75.0% (69.8%-74.9%), these four strains shared \u226575.0% nt sequence identities with Ishi-Ka3, Ishi-Ka3-1, Ishi-Ka4, Ishi-Ka5-1, and Ishi-Ka6 (S1 Table).

In the present study, according to the criteria, seven genotypes (G1, G2, G4, G6, G9, G10, and G?) were found in the feces samples from Japanese pigs, and the predominant genotypes were G3 (37.3%; 22/59) and G1 (28.8%; 17/59; Table 1, Fig 1). There are few studies on the genotyping of EV-Gs in pigs, and limited information is available from DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank databases. G1 and G6 types are predominant genotypes in Vietnam, whereas G3, G2, and G4 types appear to be common genotypes in Spain (however, that study did not analyze complete VP1 sequence) [40]. To date, G1\u2013G16 genotypes and at least three EV-Gs with an unassigned genotype, including Ishi-Ka2 in this study, have been reported [13\u201314, 25, 41]. Owing to the limited number of reports on a specific geographic area, probably not all genotypes of EV-Gs are known at present. Further studies are needed for a comprehensive understanding of the genetic diversity of EV-Gs in other geographic areas.",

Ishi-Ka2 manifested >25% VP1 nucleotide sequence divergence from other strains; therefore, Ishi-Ka2 can be considered a new serotype of EV-Gs. Nonetheless, Ishi-Ka2 shares high sequence homology with the G3-lineage 1 strain Ishi-Ka7, which was identified in a pig kept on the same farm, except for the P1 region. It is likely that Ishi-Ka2 emerged by possible recombination events; however, the putative recombination points could not be identified, and the origins of these recombination events are unclear because the recombination counterparts of these strains could not be found in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank databases or our dataset. G3-lineage 2 strains have sequence homology to G3-lineage 1 in the P1 region, but they are distantly related to G3-lineage 1 on the basis of regions P2 and P3. Because VP1 induces a host immune response, serological properties can be hypothesized based on sequence homology of the VP1 gene. On the other hand, these results suggest that full genome analysis may be needed in addition to the genotyping approaches based solely on the VP1 gene for precise EV-G classification.",

EV-G strains carrying PL-CP in pigs with diarrhea have been reported in the USA and Belgium [24\u201326]. In these cases, EV-G-PL-CPs were detected solely or with low abundance of PEDV. Shang et al. constructed an infectious clone of the EV-G-PL-CP strain, 08/NC_USA/2015, and compared it with a PL-CP knockout recombinant virus. They found that the PL-CP knockout virus showed impaired growth and induced higher expression levels of innate-immunity genes, suggesting that EV-G-PL-CP strains acquire pathogenesis via a recombination event [25]. Four out of 17 Japanese EV-G-PL-CP strains were detected in diarrheic cases of pigs; however, 13 EV-G-PL-CP strains were isolated from healthy pigs. In all cases of detection of EV-G-PL-CP in Japan, EV-G-PL-CP strains were identified together with other enteric viruses, such as astrovirus, sapelovirus, posavirus, rotavirus, picobirnavirus, sapovirus, teschovirus, torovirus, PEDV, St-Valerien virus, or kobuvirus (Table 1). Mixed infection with EV-G-PL-CP and other enteric viruses may influence the pathogenicity of EV-G-PL-CP strains.",

By recombination analyses, possible recombination events between EV-G-PL-CP strains were uncovered and a recombination breakpoint was identified in the middle of region 2A (Fig 3), in agreement with another report that describes a recombinant event between EV-G8 and EV-G9 [14], suggesting that this point may be a hotspot of recombination events of EV-G. Furthermore, VP1-2A junction is a known recombination hot-spot in human enteroviruses and this was discussed in many papers [51\u201355]. The present recombination profile in EV-G described here apparently mirrors that in human enteroviruses.
