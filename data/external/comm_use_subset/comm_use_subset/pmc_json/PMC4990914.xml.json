Equipped with this small animal model of human MERS-CoV, we investigated the protective efficacy of mAb m336. To accomplish this, each group (n = 6) of mice was treated via the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route with two different doses: 0.1 mg and 1 mg per mouse diluted in 100 \u03bcl PBS, and challenged intranasally (i.n.) at 12 h post treatment with 104 TCID50 (i.e., 1,000 LD50) of MERS-CoV in a volume of 60 \u03bcl38. Challenged mice were monitored daily for clinical manifestations (weight loss)  and mortality. As shown in Fig. 1, the group treated with 1 mg mAb survived viral infection without showing any clinical symptoms. These mice initially showed either no weight loss or recovered from mild weight loss within three days (Fig. 1A). On the other hand, the group treated with 0.1 mg mAb showed a gradual weight loss (15\u201320%) until day 13 just before starting to recover (Fig. 1A). All surviving mice (one died on day 13 in mice treated with 0.1 mg of m336) continued to recover and appeared well up to 21 dpi when the experiment was terminated (Fig. 1B). All MERS-CoV-challenged mice pretreated with a high dose (1 mg) of irrelevant mAb m102.4 exhibited profound weight loss (>15%) and succumbed to infection with 100% mortality by day 8 p.i. (Fig. 1A,B).",

We noted that whereas treatment with 1 mg of m336 antibodies was effective in the protection against the lethality caused by MERS-CoV infection, it failed to protect mice fully from the onset of clinical illness (weight loss). Specifically, all of the challenged mice treated with 1 mg of m336 antibody suffered an attenuated (<10%), and transient weight loss until day 9, and gradually recovered to day 21 when the experiment was terminated (Fig. 2). Similarly, challenged mice treated with a low dose of 0.1 mg of m336 antibodies suffered from attenuated and transient weight loss until day 7 p.i. and gradually recovered. However, we noted a single death at day 9 in this low dose treatment group (Fig. 2). As expected, all mice treated with a single dose of 1 mg of control m102.4 antibody exhibited profound weight loss (>15%) and succumbed to MERS-CoV infection with 100% mortality by day 8 p.i. (Fig. 2). Taken together, these results indicate that this MERS-CoV RBD-specific human m336 antibody can be highly effective as prophylactic or therapeutic modalities in protecting highly permissive transgenic mice against MERS-CoV infection and disease.",

Specifically, we sacrificed two mice (out of 6) in each group, as described above for Figs 1 and 2 and their lung specimens were harvested for determining viral titers by using via Vero E6 cell-based infectivity assay and quantitative PCR (Q-PCR)-based assay targeting the upstream E gene of MERS-CoV. As shown in Fig. 3A we were unable to recover infectious virus from any mouse treated with 1 mg of m336 antibody either before or after challenge with MERS-CoV. However, we were able to detect a barely detectable infectious virus, with the limit of detection (LOD) of 2.3 log TICD50/g, from a single mouse receiving 0.1 mg of m336 prior to viral challenge. These results indicated that mAb m336 most likely confers protection from lethal challenge by restricting viral replication within the lungs, thereby preventing viral infection in the brains and other organs.",

Lungs of infected mice were harvested on day 2 post- and pre-virus challenge group. All groups exhibited detectable viral RNA. Titers were significantly lower than those in the control group in all m336-treated groups. In the pretreatment group, mice treated with 1 mg of m336 showed a 2-log reduction in viral RNA detection, while a ~1 log reduction in viral numbers was seen in mice treated within 0.1 mg m336 when compared to mice receiving control mAb m102.4. In the post-treatment group, a smaller (~1 log) difference in viral RNA copy number (compared to that in the pretreatment group) was observed between mice treated with 1 mg antibody compared with those receiving control antibody, while a more than 1 log reduction in viral RNA number was seen in mice treated with 0.1 mg m336 when compared to mice receiving control mAb (Fig. 3B). These data indicate that m336 confers significant protection to mice when administered pre- or post-viral challenge. Taken together, these results suggest to us that the epitope targeted by this exceptionally potent RBD-specific m336 antibody has a great potential for further development as a potent preventive and therapeutic agent in the future.",

Even though the transmissibility of MERS-CoV among humans remains low at present, as a mutation-prone RNA virus, it could eventually evolve into a highly communicable and more virulent human pathogens. This emphasizes the urgent need for the development of an effective antiviral therapy which could restrict the spread of this deadly disease. In other viral infections, neutralizing antibodies have been shown to protect the host from disease progression and/or reduce the severity of clinical symptoms. Passive immunotherapy for prophylaxis and treatment of infectious viral diseases has been widely used for many decades3940414243. Passive transfer of neutralizing antibodies is also a promising strategy for both prophylaxis and treatment against MERS-CoV infection. To this end, we and others have successfully demonstrated the protective efficacy of specific human neutralizing monoclonal antibodies in animal models of MERS-CoV infection23242628. Among a panel of MERS-CoV-specific mAbs generated by using a vast phage display library23, we identified three mAbs which specifically bind to the MERS-CoV RBD with very high affinity. Among these three identified, we noted that mAb m336 exhibited the highest potency in neutralizing live MERS-CoV. Here, we further characterized this novel human mAb in our Tg mouse model of MERS-CoV infection and showed prophylactic and therapeutic protection of mice treated with m336 before and after a lethal challenge with the virus, respectively. Thus, mAb m336 is highly promising as a potent inhibitor for urgent prophylaxis in adjunctive treatment for patients infected with MERS-CoV.",

These data demonstrate that m336 confers a dose-dependent reduction of MERS-CoV infection, corroborating lower viral RNA levels and live virus isolation determined for these mice when compared to control mice. Our study also confirmed the therapeutic efficacy of m336 in a dose-dependent manner. Similar to the prophylactic studies, administration of a single-dose of m336 antibody at a concentration of either 1 or 0.1 mg per mouse at 12 h after MERS-CoV challenge provided 100% and 75% protection, respectively, against infection-induced lethality, accompanied by reduced viral loads (both infectious virus and viral RNA) within the lungs. However, we also noted the recovery of bodyweight loss and the reduction of viral loads in mice treated with 1 mg of m336 at 12 hrs after infection were slower than those treated with 0.1 mg of m336, as shown in Figs 2A and 3B, respectively. While there is no clear evidence showing an adverse impact on the overall wellbeing of mice imposed upon treatment with 1 mg of m336 antibody before MERS-CoV challenge (Fig. 1), it is difficult to completely rule out the existence of subtle \u201cyet-to-be investigated\u201d high-dose drug toxicity. We speculate that such a subtle high-dose drug toxicity in the phase of acute and dynamic MERS-CoV infection initiated at 12 hrs before treatment with 1 mg of m336 could exacerbate drug toxicity, resulting in reduction of appetite and antiviral capacity. However, such a negative impact imposed upon high-dose treatment of virally infected mice appeared to be transient and did not irreversibly alter the final outcome of infection, as judged by the mortality (Fig. 2B). Additional studies, especially the pharmacokinetics and the dosing frequency of m336 are warranted in the future to optimize preventive and therapeutic strategies with this promising antibody.",

Such a striking ability of this m336 antibody, as a prophylactic or therapeutic agent, to significantly protect these transgenic mice against challenge with 1000 LD50 of MERS-CoV is highly impressive. The RBD of the MERS-CoV, targeted by this m336 antibody, is highly conserved among various clinical isolates and the mutation rate of this RBD appears to be extremely low, compared to that of other RNA viruses2328, thereby making the development of escape mutants to m336 unlikely. However, a combination treatment with multiple neutralizing mAbs targeted at different epitopes or the MERS-CoV-specific HR2P fusion inhibitor targeting the HR1 domain of the S2 subunit of the MERS-CoV S protein3844 could be desirable.",

Using Ad5-hCD26-transduced mouse model33, they demonstrated that intravenous administration of a single dose of 4C2h one day before or after the MERS-CoV challenge resulted in reduction of viral titer by 2 log at 3 dpi. However, intraperitoneal administration of m336 to our hDPP4 Tg mice lead to the reduction of viral titer as high as 4 log at 2 dpi. Since MERS-CoV challenged Ad5-hCD26-transduced mice showed no severe disease, the effect of 4C2h on the weight loss and mortality in these mice is unavailable. Additionally, unlike hDPP4 transgenic mice that we used in this study with well-defined hDPP4 expression as well as 50% lethal dose (LD50) and infectious dose (ID50), the intensities of hCD26 expression among the Ad5-hCD26-transduecd mice are variable, ranging from undetectable to a high level45. Although both 4C2h and m336 bind to the RBD of MERS-CoV S protein, some of the critical amino acid residues recognized by these two mAbs are different2936. The epitope of m336 overlaps extensively with the DPP4-binding site, which is composed of MERS-CoV RBD residues N501-K502, S504, F506, D510, E513, W535-R542, W553, V555, S557 and S55929. The epitope of mAb 4C2, the parental mouse mAb of 4C2h, only overlaps with partial of DPP4-binding site, which is composed of five RBD residues, W535-E536 and D539-R542. Most of other RBD amino acids recognized by 4C2, including Y397-N398, K400, L495-K496, P525 and V527-S532, are not located on the DPP4-binding site, indicating that the neutralization efficacy of 4C2h is largely attributed to the steric hindrance created by its binding with MERS-CoV RBD36.These results suggest that combinational use of 4C2h and m336 may exhibit synergistic antiviral effect against both wild-type strains and escape mutants (if any) of MERS-CoV.",
