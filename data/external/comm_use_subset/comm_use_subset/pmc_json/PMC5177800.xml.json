One is unpredictability because it does not occur through known mechanisms, and the other is that it is difficult to clearly analyze the events because cause and effect are statistically \u201cindependent\u201d of each other (cf. International Organization for Standardization 31000).",

The initial development and spread of MERS have complicated connections to the response of the press and the government, which significantly decreases the possibility of control. This explains one of the reasons the models of medical-sociologists for disaster situations need to be based on \u201cinterdependence models\u201d such as spatial analysis.",

In the event of a disaster or a warning, the general public\u2019s voluntary notification spreads through Social Networking Service and internet communication. While the propagation of disaster information in such private sectors is efficient in that it shows a speed that surpasses the existing alarm system, it can lead to secondary damage from the disaster by causing a paralysis of whole communication with freezing of communication lines, and providing the same propagation speed for false rumors.",

            "text": "There are sociologists who concentrate on the liberating effects of disasters. They argue that new social solidarity is created from a collective reflection on existing institutions and technologies through disasters. However, analysis of our society\u2019s reaction to MERS was more focused on the political gains and losses caused by the disaster instead of coming to an objective understanding of the incident. Thus, focusing on strengthening direct and technical training in response to disaster itself before expecting social understanding of the disaster will bring more practical and positive effects.",
