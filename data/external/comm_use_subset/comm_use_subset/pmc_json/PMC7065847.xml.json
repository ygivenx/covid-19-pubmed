The current paradigm of acute infection is that after an actively infected person aerosolizes infectious Mtb-containing particles, a naive individual inhales the bacteria that then traverse the respiratory tree to ultimately be phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages (Churchyard et al., 2017; Cohen et al., 2018). While this model can account for pulmonary TB, it is insufficient to explain some extrapulmonary forms of TB initiated by oropharyngeal infection and lacking evidence of concurrent pulmonary disease. For example, a disease known as tuberculous cervical lymphadenopathy, or scrofula, represents 10% of all new cases of TB, and frequently manifests without lung involvement (Fontanilla et al., 2011). Because the oropharynx and upper airway lymphatics drain to the cervical lymph nodes, while the lower airway lymphatics drain to the mediastinal lymph nodes, infection of the cervical lymph nodes by Mtb may not involve the lower airways. Indeed, in the infamous \u2018L\u00fcbeck Disaster\u2019 where hundreds of infants and children were accidentally orally administered Mtb instead of the attenuated BCG vaccine, the majority developed lymphatic and oropharyngeal TB rather than pulmonary TB (Fox et al., 2016), highlighting how inoculation via the oropharyngeal route can cause extrapulmonary disease.",

Within the respiratory tract, M cells have been found in the upper and lower airways of both mice and humans (Fujimura, 2000; Kim et al., 2011; Kimura et al., 2019). M cells express a number of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) (Mabbott et al., 2013). The majority of these M cell receptors have been identified on gastrointestinal M cells, while receptor expression by airway microfold cells is less well understood. Some PRRs on gastrointestinal M cells function in bacterial recognition and translocation. For example, the cellular prion protein (PrP(C)), a receptor for Brucella abortus, is necessary for B. abortus translocation (Nakato et al., 2012). Similarly, glycoprotein 2 (GP2) expressed on the apical surface of gastrointestinal M cells recognizes FimH, a component of the type I pili found on both commensal and pathogenic bacteria (Hase et al., 2009). Loss of either the host receptor GP2 or the bacterial ligand FimH diminishes bacterial translocation through M cells, reducing the immune response to these antigens and bacteria within Peyer\u2019s patches (Hase et al., 2009).",

We hypothesized that Mtb may produce a bacterial effector to mediate this process, and that, similar to receptors for gram-negative bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract (Hase et al., 2009), airway M cells may also encode an Mtb receptor. Here, we show that Mtb requires the type VII secretion system for translocation in vitro and in vivo. The type VII secretion system effector EsxA (also known as ESAT-6) is sufficient to mediate this process in vitro through binding to scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-B1). SR-B1 is enriched on mouse and human M cells both in vitro and in vivo. Loss of SR-B1 reduces EsxA and Mtb binding to M cells, and prevents Mtb translocation through M cells in vitro. Using a newly developed explanted human adenoid model, we demonstrate robust expression of SR-B1 on primary human M cells. Finally, we show that Mtb infects primary human M cells on adenoids in a type VII secretion system dependent manner. Taken together, our findings indicate that the interaction of Mtb EsxA with M cell SR-B1 allows Mtb to traverse the airway mucosa to initiate infection.",

            "text": "Mtb encodes several protein secretion systems important for bacterial virulence (Feltcher et al., 2010). One of the type VII secretion systems (T7SS) of Mtb, contained within the region of difference 1 (RD1) locus of Mtb (Behr et al., 1999), secretes virulence factors including EsxA and EsxB (also known as CFP-10) (Stanley et al., 2003; Figure 1A). We hypothesized that the Mtb T7SS might facilitate M cell translocation because the T7SS machine interacts directly with eukaryotic membranes (Augenstreich et al., 2017), EsxA can be identified on the mycobacterial cell surface (Kinhikar et al., 2010), and EsxA may directly bind several cell surface receptors (Kinhikar et al., 2010; Sreejit et al., 2014). To test if the Mtb T7SS was required for bacterial binding to and translocation across M cells, we used a human airway M cell transwell model that we developed previously (Figure 1B; Nair et al., 2016). Such transwells combine 16-HBE cells (Cozens et al., 1994) in the apical compartment of a transwell and Raji B cells in the basolateral compartment in order to mimic the organization of MALT and to enhance M cell formation (Kern\u00e9is et al., 1997; Nair et al., 2016). HBE cells cultured alone form a homogenous, polarized monolayer (hereafter called \u2018control\u2019) while coculture with Raji B cells induces some HBE cells to differentiate into M cells (hereafter called \u2018HBE/Raji B\u2019) (Nair et al., 2016). We used the Mtb eccD1::Tn5370 strain (hereafter designated Mtb eccD1::Tn) (Cox et al., 1999; Stanley et al., 2003), which lacks the inner membrane pore required for assembly of and protein secretion by the T7SS (Figure 1A; Abdallah et al., 2007). To test if the Mtb T7SS was necessary for M cell binding, we incubated transwells with either wild-type Mtb expressing mCherry (WT Mtb) or Mtb eccD1::Tn expressing mCherry at 4\u00b0C to prevent bacterial entry or translocation and analyzed surface binding by confocal microscopy and quantification of colony-forming units (CFU) (Figure 1C\u2013E). Consistent with our prior data (Nair et al., 2016), significantly more WT Mtb bound HBE/Raji B transwells (containing M cells) than control transwells by both microscopy (Figure 1C,D) and CFU (Figure 1E). However, binding was greatly reduced for the Mtb eccD1::Tn strain (Figure 1C\u2013E). To confirm that the Mtb eccD1::Tn strain did not harbor additional mutations other than the expected transposon insertion into eccD1 to potentially explain this result, we performed whole genome sequencing on the Mtb Erdman WT lab strain from our lab, along with the Mtb eccD1::Tn strain. No significant insertions, deletions or mutations were observed in the Mtb eccD1::Tn strain relative to the wild-type strain, although several single-nucleotide polymorphisms were noted when we compared the strains to the reference strain (Miyoshi-Akiyama et al., 2012; Supplementary file 1).",

As we reported previously (Nair et al., 2016), WT Mtb translocated across HBE/Raji B transwells to a greater extent than control transwells, while the translocation of the Mtb eccD1::Tn strain was significantly reduced (Figure 1F). Importantly, the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), a measure of epithelial monolayer integrity (Srinivasan et al., 2015), was stable during the experiment (Figure 1G). To further verify that Mtb T7SS is required for bacterial translocation across M cells in vitro, we also utilized an established model of M cell differentiation where Caco-2 cells, a human colonic epithelial cell line, are cultured with Raji B transwells to induce M cell differentiation (Nair et al., 2016). Similar to HBE/Raji B transwells, we observed that Mtb translocated across Caco-2/Raji B transwells in a T7SS-dependent manner (Figure 1H,I). Taken together, these data show that the Mtb T7SS is necessary for both binding to and translocation across M cells in vitro.",

We expressed EsxA and EsxB as 6-His tagged constructs and purified the proteins from E. coli (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1). We then conjugated recombinant EsxA, EsxB, or glycine (as a control) to fluorescent beads, added the beads to the apical chamber of transwells, and quantified bead translocation to the basal compartment by flow cytometry. EsxA-beads but not control beads translocated across HBE/Raji B transwells (Figure 2A) without disrupting the epithelial monolayer (Figure 2B).

While both groups of transwells had equal number of nuclei per field (Figure 2E), HBE/Raji B transwells had more NKM 16-2-4-positive M cells compared to control transwells (Figure 2F). We detected robust EsxA binding to M cells on HBE/Raji B transwells, in contrast to EsxB, which did not demonstrate significant binding (Figure 2D,G\u2013H). Similar results were observed using an antibody against Sialyl LewisA (SLA), a different M cell marker (Giannasca et al., 1999; Nair et al., 2016; Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2). Taken together, these data demonstrate that EsxA, but not EsxB, directly binds the M cell surface and is sufficient to mediate translocation across M cells when conjugated to inert beads.",

            "text": "Because EsxA bound directly to the surface of M cells, we hypothesized that EsxA may engage a cell surface receptor. To affinity purify cell surface binding proteins, we performed a modified co-immunoprecipitation experiment using either EsxA or transferrin crosslinked to the TriCEPS reagent, a molecule that allows for the covalent cross-linking of a ligand and its receptor (Tremblay and Hill, 2017). We used Caco-2 cells for this experiment as they have been used extensively as a model for M cells in vitro (Tyrer et al., 2006) and because Caco-2/Raji B transwells behaved similarly to HBE/Raji B transwells in Mtb and EsxA translocation (Figure 1E,G and Figure 2A,C). Using this approach, we identified the interaction between transferrin (TRFE) and the transferrin receptor (TFR1) (Figure 3A, blue peptides; Supplementary file 2), proving the validity of this system. When cells were treated with EsxA, peptides for two proteins, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-B1) were enriched (Figure 3A, red peptides; Supplementary file 2). Because ApoE is a soluble protein (Huang and Mahley, 2014) while SR-B1 is a known cell surface molecule, we focused on SR-B1. For further verification, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation/biotin transfer experiment without the TriCEPS reagent. After incubation with biotinylated EsxA, completion of the biotin transfer assay, and subsequent immunoprecipitation with streptavidin-coated beads, western blotting with an anti-SR-B1 antibody detected an approximately 82 kD band consistent with the known observed molecular weight of glycosylated SR-B1 (Acton et al., 1996; Figure 3B).",

HBE/Raji B transwells constructed from these cells had a similar number of M cells comparing NT and SR-B1 shRNA transwells (Figure 4B,C) and SR-B1 shRNA transwells showed a reduction in SR-B1 expression by immunofluorescence microscopy (Figure 4B,D). When we incubated these transwells with recombinant EsxA, absence of SR-B1 reduced the number of EsxA positive cells on HBE/Raji B SR-B1 shRNA transwells (Figure 4B,E). Additionally in HBE/RajiB NT shRNA transwells, the majority of EsxA-positive cells were SR-B1 positive (Figure 4B,F), suggesting that EsxA preferentially bound SR-B1 expressing M cells.

Loss of SR-B1 greatly reduced the number of bacteria bound to the HBE/Raji B transwells as determined by confocal microscopy (Figure 4G,H) and by quantification of CFU (Figure 4I). To determine the role of SR-B1 in Mtb translocation by M cells, we infected HBE/Raji B transwells expressing NT or SR-B1 shRNAs with Mtb in the apical compartment and measured translocation to the basal compartment. As expected from the reduced bacterial binding (Figure 4G\u2013I), loss of SR-B1 also greatly reduced Mtb translocation in the HBE/Raji B transwells at 37\u00b0C (Figure 4J) with no impact on the TEER (Figure 4K). The reduced ability of Mtb to translocate across HBE/Raji B transwells expressing SR-B1 shRNA was not due to any intrinsic defect in translocation caused by SR-B1 deficiency as another airway pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, was able to translocate equally across NT and SR-B1 shRNA HBE/Raji B transwells (Figure 4L). Of note, P. aeruginosa does not encode a T7SS or EsxA homologue, suggesting that its translocation across M cells depends on unique bacterial and host factors. We thus conclude that SR-B1 is essential for the binding and translocation of Mtb via M cells in a process requiring the effector EsxA.",

To determine if the Mtb T7SS is necessary for bacterial translocation in vivo, we performed NALT infections (Nair et al., 2016) with Mtb eccD1::Tn or Mtb\u0394esxA. As described above for Mtb eccD1::Tn, to control for possible mutations outside the known esxA deletion, we performed whole genome sequencing on the Mtb\u2206esxA strain and determined that its sequence is essentially identical to the parental Mtb WT strain (Supplementary file 1). Of note, in both Mtb mutant strains the T7SS machine fails to assemble (Abdallah et al., 2007) thereby preventing T7SS-dependent virulence factor secretion. We infected mice intranasally with WT Mtb, Mtb eccD1::Tn (Figure 5B), or Mtb\u0394esxA (Figure 5C) and enumerated CFU from draining cervical lymph nodes 7 days post-infection (Nair et al., 2016). Both the Mtb eccD1::Tn and Mtb\u2206esxA strains had 1.0\u20131.5 log fewer bacteria compared to WT Mtb in the cervical lymph nodes. This degree of attenuation was not observed when we infected mice intranasally with a Cor-deficient strain of Mtb (Mtbcor::Tn7) that is also attenuated in vivo (Zacharia et al., 2013; Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the lower CFU recovered from cervical lymph nodes of mice infected with T7SS mutant Mtb strains may be due to reduced translocation across M cells.",

We next confirmed the presence of M cells in human adenoids by flow cytometry (Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2 for gating strategy) and observed that approximately 10% of adenoid cells were EpCAM+/NKM- epithelial cells, while about 1% of the cells were EpCAM+/NKM+ double positive M cells (Figure 5E). When we analyzed SR-B1 expression using flow cytometry, we observed that approximately 20% of primary human M cells (marked as EpCAM+/NKM+ cells) were SR-B1 positive as compared to less than 2% of the other epithelial cells (EpCAM+/NKM-) (Figure 5F), verifying our observation that SR-B1 is expressed predominately by M cells in vivo.",

The number of GFP+ Mtb containing EpCAM+/NKM+ M cells ranged from 0.1\u20138% while we were unable to identify any GFP+ Mtb containing EpCAM+/NKM- epithelial cells (Figure 5G), suggesting that M cells were a preferred route of entry for Mtb in adenoids. Finally, we determined the role of the Mtb T7SS in Mtb entry into adenoid M cells. We infected adenoids with GFP+ WT Mtb or GFP+ Mtb eccD1::Tn and observed more GFP+/EpCAM+/NKM+ cells after infection with WT Mtb as compared to Mtb eccD1::Tn (Figure 5H).

EsxA, a protein secreted through the T7SS, bound M cells in vitro, was sufficient to mediate M cell translocation by inert beads and was necessary for Mtb translocation in vitro. Furthermore, the T7SS was necessary for Mtb translocation in a mouse mucosal infection model. Primary human airway M cells internalized Mtb in a T7SS-dependent manner, indicating that this process is relevant for human disease. Finally, SR-B1 was enriched on M cells and served as a receptor for Mtb EsxA to mediate Mtb translocation. Together, our data demonstrate a previously undescribed role for Mtb EsxA in mucosal invasion and identify SR-B1 as the airway M cell receptor for Mtb.",

In our experiments utilizing recombinant EsxA, we also did not observe pore formation or epithelial damage. This could be due to the relatively short amount of time we incubated EsxA with our transwells for binding or translocation experiments. Alternatively, the pore forming properties of EsxA may only occur when the protein is in low pH conditions, such as in the lysosome. Thus, EsxA may directly interact with M cell SR-B1 in a cell contact-dependent manner (Conrad et al., 2017), leading to SR-B1 receptor-mediated internalization similar to its function in both hepatitis C virus and Plasmodium vivax uptake (Heo et al., 2006; Manzoni et al., 2017). Although SR-B1 has not been previously identified as an EsxA receptor, prior studies have found other host proteins that interact with EsxA, including laminin (Kinhikar et al., 2010), \u03b22 microglobulin (Sreejit et al., 2014), and TLR-2 (Pathak et al., 2007). We did not identify these proteins in our affinity purification assay, a discrepancy possibly related to the cell types used for binding experiments. However, it is possible that these or other receptors could partly compensate for loss of SR-B1 on M cells, explaining the low level of binding and translocation observed in the absence of SR-B1. Alternatively, Mtb may encode for factors other than EsxA that also mediate M cell binding and translocation, explaining the low level of binding and translocation observed in the absence of EsxA.",

A possible alternate interpretation for this result centers on the observation that T7SS deficient strains of Mtb are attenuated in vivo and in macrophages (Stanley et al., 2003). Thus, the reduced CFU recovered from draining lymph nodes could represent a macrophage survival defect for the T7SS deficient strains. However, when we used a different attenuated Mtb strain for NALT infection, we observed normal dissemination to the draining lymph nodes. We therefore propose that the reduced CFU recovered from cervical lymph nodes of mice infected with T7SS-deficient Mtb is not simply due to an attenuation defect within macrophages. Consistent with this interpretation, the markedly reduced translocation of T7SS-deficient Mtb across M cells in vitro and into explanted human adenoids ex vivo, in the absence of an innate immune response and over a very short time course, indicates that the T7SS is required for translocation across M cells.",

            "text": "SR-B1 has been well characterized as a high-density lipoprotein receptor involved in cholesterol uptake (Acton et al., 1996). It has also been shown that SR-B1 binds several bacterial molecules, including lipopolysacharide and lipoteicheic acid produced by gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, respectively (Bocharov et al., 2004). Although direct interaction of EsxA and SR-B1 has not previously been shown, SR-B1 has been reported as a receptor for mycobacteria (Philips et al., 2005; Sch\u00e4fer et al., 2009), primarily in macrophages (reviewed in Stamm et al., 2015). However, when SR-B1-/- mice were infected with Mtb via the aerosol route, there was no difference in bacterial replication, granuloma size, cytokine secretion, or survival within the first 4 months post-infection compared to wild-type mice (Sch\u00e4fer et al., 2009). Based on our current data and previous results showing improved mouse survival during aerosol Mtb infection when M cells are reduced (Nair et al., 2016), we predict that loss of M cell SR-B1 should reduce bacterial dissemination from the airway and enhance mouse survival. SR-B1-/- mice experience defective intrauterine and post-natal development and as a result are not born at normal Mendellian ratios (Santander et al., 2013). In addition, they manifest increased serum HDL, cardiovascular defects and altered adrenal hormones (Trigatti et al., 1999), making them incompatible with such a study. Likewise, mice expressing an M-cell specific Cre have not been reported, preventing analysis of SR-B1 function exclusively in M cells.",

Because respiratory MALT is more abundant in children than adults (Tschernig and Pabst, 2000) and M cells are a key component of MALT (Corr et al., 2008), we propose that the increased incidence of extrapulmonary TB in children (Yang et al., 2004) is due to M cell mediated translocation. Interestingly, there was significant variation in M cell entry in human adenoids, which could relate to polymorphisms in SR-B1 or differences in SR-B1 expression by M cells.",

Genomic DNA was then enzymatically fragmented and sequenced using Illumina NextSeq 550 sequencing (Microbial Genome Sequencing Center, https://migscenter.com). To reconstruct the bacterial genomes and identify genetic modifications, the bioinformatics analysis workflow was based on Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK, v3.8\u20130; RRID:SCR_001876) (DePristo et al., 2011; McKenna et al., 2010) best practices. Quality control and adapter trimming were performed using Trim Galore (v0.6.4; RRID:SCR_011847) (https://github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore). Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA, v0.7.17; RRID:SCR_010910) (Li and Durbin, 2009) was employed to map the reads to the genome of the publicly available Mtb Erdman (ATCC35801) strain (NCBI assembly: ASM35020v1). Picard (v2.12.0; RRID:SCR_006525) (https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard) was used to remove PCR indices. Variant calling and genotyping were performed using GATK HaplotypeCaller (RRID:SCR_001876) and the variant calls were filtered by applying the following criteria: DP (Approximate read depth)<10, GQ (Genotype Quality)<20. The variants were annotated using a custom Perl script (https://github.com/jiwoongbio/Annomen). Insertions and deletions were identified using coverage depths and split reads from SAMtools (v0.1.19; RRID:SCR_002105) (Li et al., 2009). SPAdes (v3.13.0; RRID:SCR_000131) (Bankevich et al., 2012) was used to de novo assembly and MUMmer 4 (RRID:SCR_001200) (Kurtz et al., 2004) was used to compare the genome assemblies.
