            "text": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the one of the most prevalent malignant tumors and major causes of cancer-related death worldwide. Curative treatments for patients with HCC include surgical resection, liver transplantation, and radiofrequency ablation-percutaneous ethanol injection (1, 2); however, only patients with early-stage HCC are eligible for curative treatments. Systemic chemotherapy is challenging for patients with compromised liver function, which is present in most HCC patients (3). Sorafenib was the first targeted drug to be clinically approved for use in patients with advanced HCC (4\u20136). The major target of sorafenib is the serine-threonine kinase Raf-1, which is involved in the Ras/Raf/MEK/mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling (MAPK) cascade (7). Although sorafenib efficiently inhibits the activity of Raf-1 at a very low dose (half maximal inhibitory concentration value of 6 nM) (8, 9), an increasing number of reports have shown that sorafenib also inhibits several receptor tyrosine kinases, such as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) 1, 2, and 3, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and fibroblast growth factor receptor (9\u201311). Moreover, sorafenib showed limited survival benefits in large, randomized phase III studies, with a very low response rate (2\u20133%) (12, 13), likely due to molecules involved in epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition, cancer stemness, and the tumor microenvironment for drug resistance (14). Effective therapeutic targets for HCC are currently unavailable, demonstrating an urgent need to identify suitable molecules to overcome this pressing issue.",

            "text": "Kinases are crucial upstream regulators of the signaling pathways required for homeostasis in normal cells. Dysregulation of oncogenic kinases by either overexpression or overactivation is highly associated with tumorigenesis, migration, invasion, and drug resistance (15\u201317). In addition to the involvement of the aforementioned kinases in HCC, many kinases are reportedly associated with tumor progression in HCC. Aurora kinase A (AURKA) is associated with cancer metastasis and stemness in HCC cells, particularly in TP53-mutated HCC cells (18, 19). Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is overexpressed in 50% of HCCs and its expression is correlated with poor differentiation and prognosis (20). Focal adhesion kinase upregulates the proto-oncogenes EZH2 and H3K27me3 for HCC cell growth (21). These genes are concomitantly expressed at a higher level in HCC than in non-tumor liver. Dnajb1\u2013Prkaca gene fusion activates PRKACA kinase to promote the tumorigenesis of fibrolamellar HCC in mice (22). Moreover, annexin A3 activates JNK for the growth of HCC cells, particularly of CD133+ liver cancer stem cells (23). Although many kinases play pivotal roles in signaling pathways that are associated with HCC tumorigenesis, no inhibitor targeting these kinases is largely beneficial for patients with HCC, indicating that little is known about kinases in HCC therapy.",

We found that mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 7 (MAP3K7) appears to be essential for the growth and metastatic characteristics of HCC cells. Genetic and pharmacological targeting of MAP3K7 attenuated tumor cell growth in spheroid cell culture and a xenograft mouse model. Additionally, MAP3K7 expression was positively correlated with mTOR expression, and high co-expression of MAP3K7 and mTOR was associated with poor survival in patients with HCC. Taken together, our results suggest that MAP3K7 might be a potential target for the future development of targeted therapy for HCC.",

Thus, to evaluate if any kinases are required for HCC cell proliferation, two HBV-negative HCC cell lines (SK-HEP-1 and Huh7) (29) were transfected with a kinome siRNA library to determine the effect of each gene on HCC cell proliferation (Figure 1A). The top 11 ranked hits revealed that silencing these genes inhibited cell proliferation in SK-HEP-1 and Huh7 cells. Pooled siRNAs against these genes were transfected into HBV-negative (SK-HEP-1 and Huh7) and -positive (HA22T and Hep3B) HCC cell lines, to validate whether the kinases were essential for cell proliferation in different types of HCC cells (Figure 1B). The suppressive effects of siRNA against the top five genes on cell proliferation were consistent in the various HCC cell lines examined. Stable knockdown of these genes effectively diminished gene expression and colony formation in SK-HEP-1 cells, whereas only gene knockdown of AURKA and MAP3K7 inhibited colony formation in Huh7 cells (Figure 1C). The role of AURKA in HCC has been reported previously (18, 19). However, MAP3K7 can serve as a tumor promoter or suppressor in liver cells, which is still controversial (30). Thus, we selected MAP3K7 for further validation of its effects on colony formation using transient transfection with siRNA (Figure 1D). Transient gene silencing of MAP3K7 significantly suppressed colony formation in SK-HEP-1 and Huh7 cells. Furthermore, knockdown of MAP3K7 had little effect on G1 phase arrest in cell cycle of SK-HEP-1 and Huh7 cells (Figure S1).",

Transient knockdown of MAP3K7 inhibited the invasion ability of Huh7 cells (Figure 2B). Similar to the results of transient knockdown, stable knockdown of MAP3K7 significantly inhibited the migration and invasion of HCC cells (Figures 2D,E). To evaluate further whether kinase activity is involved in cancer malignancy, HCC cells were treated with the MAP3K7 inhibitor (5Z)-7-oxozeaenol to determine its effects on cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion (Figure 3). (5Z)-7-oxozeaenol significantly reduced the growth and mobility of HCC cells. We further inspected if MAP3K7 is required for migration and invasion in HBV-positive HCC cells as well. Interestingly, silencing MAP3K7 had no effects on cell invasion in HBV-positive HA22T and Hep3B cell lines, while it promoted cell migration in Hep3B cells (Figure S2). In addition, treatment of (5Z)-7-oxozeaenol reduced migration and invasion in HA22T, whereas it increased cell invasion in Hep3B cells (Figure S3). These results suggested that MAP3K7 might be important for metastatic characteristics in certain types of HCC cells.",

Indeed, MAP3K7 knockdown attenuated the effects of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 stimulation on the transcriptional activity of NF-\u03baB in SK-HEP-1 and Huh7 cells (data not shown). The correlation between MAP3K7 and TABs expression with the overall survival of patients with HCC was also inspected (Table S1). High co-expression of MAP3K7 and TAB1 was associated with shorter survival (Table S1, adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] = 2.23, p = 0.008). Similar results were observed in patients with high co-expression levels of MAP3K7 and TAB2 or TAB3 (TAB2: AHR = 1.79, p = 0.019; TAB3: AHR = 2.15, p = 0.002). Nevertheless, since these results have been reported previously in cancer cells (31) and MAP3K7 was selected from our screen in regular medium without TNF-\u03b1 stimulation, we set them aside. Moreover, MAP3K7 inactivation induces AMPK activity and diminishes phosphorylation of MTOR in skeletal muscle cells (32). Thus, we inspected the involvement of the potential downstream effector mTOR in MAP3K7-modulated tumor malignancy in HCC cells. Interestingly, knockdown of MAP3K7 decreased mTOR phosphorylation and protein level without affecting AMPK phosphorylation in HCC cells (Figure 6A). The expression of mTOR mRNA was also decreased in MAP3K7-silenced HCC cells (Figure 6B). TCGA data analysis showed that MAP3K7 expression was positively correlated with mTOR levels (Figure 6C). The association of survival with MAP3K7 expression alone or combined with mTOR expression was evaluated by univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models (Table 1). High MAP3K7 expression was associated with poor overall survival in patients with HCC (AHR = 1.78, p = 0.006). Co-expression with either MAP3K7(High)/mTOR(Low) or MAP3K7(Low)/mTOR(High) was associated with shorter overall survival (AHR = 1.52, p = 0.036), while co-expression of MAP3K7(High)/mTOR(High) had much worse overall survival (AHR = 8.26, p < 0.001). However, neither MAP3K7 expression alone nor in combination with mTOR expression correlated with disease-free survival. Similarly, Kaplan-Meier plots showed that high co-expression of MAP3K7 and mTOR was associated with significantly shorter overall survival (Figure 6D), whereas it had no correlation with disease-free survival (Figure 6E), suggesting that the MAP3K7/mTOR axis is involved in tumor malignancy, but not recurrence, in patients with HCC.",

These results indicate that many kinases are associated with tumor development and malignancy in various cancer types (36). Sorafenib inhibits multiple kinases, including Raf, VEGFR, and PDGFR, but it has limited benefit in a few populations of HCC patients (37). Moreover, no single kinase is reported to be an effective target for patients with HCC. Herein, we comprehensively screened two HCC cell lines with a kinome siRNA library for potential therapeutic targets for HCC. Our study reported the following findings. First, genetic and pharmacological ablation of MAP3K7 attenuated HCC cell growth in two-dimensional and spheroid cell culture, as well as in xenografted tumors. Second, deprivation of MAP3K7 inhibited the migration and invasion of HCC cells. Third, MAP3K7 expression was higher in tumor tissues, and high MAP3K7 expression, alone or in combination with its downstream regulator mTOR, was associated with poor survival in patients with HCC.",

Spheroid cell culture results also showed that silencing MAP3K7 inhibited sphere formation in HBV-negative (SK-HEP1, Huh7, and 71T) and HBV-positive (89T) cells. Moreover, SK-HEP-1 cells have wild-type TP53, whereas Huh7 cells have mutant TP53 (38). The TP53 gene was deleted in the other two cell lines, Hep3B and HA22T. Silencing MAP3K7 diminished cell growth in HCC cell lines without or with wild-type or mutant TP53, implying that the effect of MAP3K7 on cell proliferation might be in an HBV- and TP53-independent manner. More interestingly, gene knockdown of some kinases showed stronger inhibitory effects in SK-HEP-1 cells than in TP53 mutant (Huh7) and deleted (Hep3B and HA22T) cells, such as YES, ABL1, and STK17B. The results suggested that TP53 inactivation might be involved in kinase-mediated tumorigenesis, which warrants further investigation. On the other hand, the opposite effects of MAP3K7 in migration and invasion were observed in Hep3B cells, but not HA22T cells. The results suggested that some other factors may interfere MAP3K7 signaling on cell migration and invasion, which require further study to elucidate.",

AURKA and PLK1 expression levels are elevated in tumor tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues in patients with HCC (19, 39). Silencing PLK1 arrests the cell cycle at the G2/M phase and induces apoptosis (39), while knockdown of AURKA reduces the post-radiotherapy invasion of HCC (19). Moreover, PIK3CA is activated by a mutation in 28% of HCC patients (40). PI-103 (an inhibitor of PI3K and mTOR) inhibits cell proliferation and enhances the chemosensitivity of HCC cells to sorafenib (41). These results suggest that our screening platform could be used to find new therapeutic targets for HCC when screening other siRNA libraries. In contrast, NRBP2 expression is lower in tumor tissues, and high NRBP2 expression is associated with better prognosis and chemosensitivity to sorafenib (42), suggesting that it serves as a tumor suppressor. Nevertheless, our current data showed that both transient and stable knockdown of NRBP2 diminished the proliferation of HCC cells, which requires further study to elucidate its role in HCC.",

These cytokines induce the formation of the activated MAP3K7 complex via TNF receptor association factor 2 (TRAF2) and TRAF6 (30). TAB1 and TAB2/3 associate with the N-terminus and C-terminus, respectively, of MAP3K7 for its full activation (43, 44). MAP3K7 interacts with I\u03baB kinase (45) and MAPK to enhance the transcriptional activity of NF-\u03baB and AP-1, which are associated with inflammation and tumorigenesis. Gene silencing of MAP3K7 enhances the sensitivity of cancer cells, but not normal epithelial cells, to chemotherapeutic drugs (46). The MAP3K7 inhibitor LYTAK1 blocks NF-\u03baB activity to increase chemotherapeutic efficacy in pancreatic cancer cells (47). Conversely, MAP3K7 conditional knockout in liver parenchymal cells of mice induces hepatocyte dysplasia and early-onset hepatocarcinogenesis (48). In our present study, MAP3K7 expression was much higher in tumor tissues than in adjacent normal tissues and was associated with poor survival of HCC patients. Gene silencing of MAP3K7 blocked HCC cell growth in cell culture and a tumor xenograft mouse model, suggesting that low levels of MAP3K7 may be essential for the normal physiological function of hepatocytes, but too much MAP3K7 may cause inflammation and promote HCC, particularly in cytokine-elevated conditions.",

The X protein of HBV can activate IKK to activate mTOR and the downstream effector S6K1 (51). HCV infection increases IKK-\u03b1 expression for lipogenesis (52), and its core protein triggers the activation of NF-\u03baB for the gene expression of the inflammatory cytokine IL-1\u03b2 through TRAF2/6 (53), which are crucial factors for activated MAP3K7 complex formation. However, the missing links between HBV/HCV and MAP3K7 activation for HCC development need further study to be elucidated. Moreover, MAP3K7 reportedly phosphorylates mTOR to regulate mitochondrial function (32). mTOR is overexpressed in approximately 50% of HCC patients and is associated with poor differentiation and prognosis (20). mTOR inhibitors are currently being tested in clinical trials for patients with HCC (NCT10687673 and NCT01177397). Our present data showed that silencing MAP3K7 not only reduced the phosphorylation of mTOR but also diminished its protein and mRNA levels. High co-expression levels of MAP3K7 and mTOR were significantly associated with poor overall and disease-free survivals in patients with HCC compared to those with low expression levels. Nevertheless, the patients' number (n = 5) with high co-expression levels of MAP3K7 and MTOR in overall survival is not large enough as shown in Table 1. Our study may need a larger cohort of HCC to verify the association of these genes in overall survival.",

Our current results showed that silencing MAP3K7 reduced MTOR phosphorylation without changing phosphorylation of AMPK and raptor. P38 is involved in MTOR activation in cardiomyocyte (54). It raises a possibility that MAP3K7 may regulate MTOR through p38 activation. Although the molecular mechanisms by which MAP3K7 affects mTOR expression require further study, these results indicate that MAP3K7 might be a potential diagnostic marker or therapeutic target for future drug development in HCC.",
