The main symptoms of intestinal infectious diseases include nausea, vomiting, fever, headache, limb pain, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, systemic poisoning, diarrhoea, and other gastrointestinal symptoms, which may lead to death if not treated promptly. IIDs have posed public health threats and resulted in severe social and economic burdens due to the high incidence and morbidity rates, particularly in young children [1\u20133]. Several large, severe global disease outbreaks have been associated with IIDs, such as the outbreaks of HFMD in east and southeast Asia in the early twenty-first century [4], the constantly high burden of cholera that persists in many African countries, and the cholera outbreaks with active cholera transmission in many sub-Saharan African countries [5]. According to the sustainable development goals (SDG), we should combat hepatitis, water-borne diseases and other communicable diseases. IIDs represent a significant obstacle to achieving SDG [6].",

All reported infectious diseases are divided into Classes A, B and C in terms of severity, which is shown in Additional file 1. In China, IIDs are one of the main types of infectious diseases, presenting the characters of a high morbidity rate and low mortality rate [7]. Eight IIDs are listed in the law, including cholera, poliomyelitis, dysentery, typhoid and paratyphoid (TAP), viral Hepatitis A, viral Hepatitis E, hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) and other infectious intestinal diseases (OIIDs). Among these diseases, cholera and poliomyelitis have been almost completely eradicated. In contrast, according to the data reported by the Chinese CDC in 2017, viral Hepatitis A, viral Hepatitis E, and dysentery are among the top five most severe diseases in Class B. At the same time, HFMD and OIDDs were the most severe diseases in class C. The status of intestinal infectious diseases requires further attention.",

First, temporal analysis of different intestinal infectious diseases was conducted. The initial efforts in conducting a temporal analysis investigated the temporal variations in the incidence rates of different diseases in different age groups and areas. For example, Tian et al. analysed the temporal characteristics of HFMD and the relationship between meteorological factors and the incidence of HFMD in Beijing, China. May to July is the period with peak HFMD incidence each year in Beijing [8]. Xiao et al. compared the temporal trends for two types of HFMD cases, namely, the daily series of disease counts of mild and severe HFMD cases reported in mainland China in the period from 2009 to 2014 [9]. Yang et al. applied the Grey Model First Order One Variable [GM (1, 1)] to predict the trend in the incidence of typhoid using data collected from Wuhan City in China from 2004 to 2015 [10]. Liu et al. forecasted the incidence of bacillary dysentery diseases by applying the seasonal trend model based on the moving average method, which forecast the incidence of Hepatitis A in 2015 [11]. Ming et al. investigated the seasonal signals and long-term trends in a series of 10 IGS sites in China [12]. Xing et al. conducted a study examining the epidemiological characteristics in China from 2008 to 2012, emphasizing seasonal patterns among people at different ages [13]. Temporal analyses of infectious diseases have allowed researchers to develop a wide range of research methods, namely, time series analysis and seasonal analysis. However, temporal analysis failed to reflect the overall circumstances of infectious intestinal diseases.",

Zheng et al. mapped the incidence rate and coefficient of determinants of HFMD to present and identify the most severely affected areas and the most influential determinants [15]. As shown in the study by Wang et al., the typhoid prevalence is spatially clustered and exhibits a gradually decreasing trend [16]. According to Ma et al., bacillary dysentery is not equally distributed across Sichuan Province in China [17]. Nie et al. used a spatial correlation analysis to explore the associations between selected factors and bacillary dysentery in Guangxi Province in China [18]. The spatial analysis visually displayed the discrepancies among different regions, which would be able to present additional results if combined with the temporal analysis.",

            "text": "On one hand, we would like to compare the temporal analyses of the six intestinal infectious diseases. According to the incidence rates recorded from 2006 to 2016, the temporal trends differed. Regarding the absolute incidence of cases, the incidence of HFMD was higher than the other IIDs, and it gradually became a wide-spread disease, which is consistent with the results from the study by Zhang [30]. Then, dysentery and OIDD were less severe diseases. Hepatitis A, Hepatitis E and TAP were the least severe diseases, according to the incidence rates. Regarding the trend, the incidence rates of HFMD and Hepatitis E showed a distinct increasing trend, consistent with the results from the study by Zhu. As the epidemic of Hepatitis A was controlled, the percentage of Hepatitis E cases among patients with viral hepatitis and among patients with IIDs has increased. The mortality rate of Hepatitis E has increased among infectious diseases [31]. The trend in the incidence of OIDD was almost unchangeable. Dysentery and TAP displayed obvious decreasing trends. The analysis of dysentery filled the research gap in the study by Xie et al., which showed a decreasing trend in the incidence of dysentery from 2005 to 2010 [32]. The results for TAP were similar to the findings reported by Liu [33], which showed a decreasing trend. The improvement in sanitation facilities and the reduction in food and water pollution likely contributed to the decreasing trend in the incidence rates of these diseases. Hepatitis A exhibited a slight increasing trend in the first 2 years, followed by a decreasing trend. This result was similar to the findings reported by Zhu [19]. In conclusion, class B diseases were prevented with high efficiency. Class C diseases experienced a higher incidence rate and gradually increasing trend. Regarding the seasonal changes, the incidence of HFMD and dysentery peaked in the summer, Hepatitis E exhibited a high-incidence season in spring, OIDD peaked in summer and a smaller peak in autumn, the peak incidence of Hepatitis A occurred in summer and spring, and a distinct peak for TAP was not observed. Previous studies have revealed an association between the IIDs and seasons [16, 34\u201337]. The occurrence of intestinal infectious diseases is related to climatic factors, such as the sunshine duration, temperature and humidity, as well as the quality of food and drinking water [38]. Due to the high temperature and humidity in summer, which are conducive to bacterial reproduction, food and water are easily contaminated. At the same time, the human immune system is relatively weak due to higher bodily exertion in summer. In conclusion, summer is the season with the highest incidence rates for IIDs and should receive closer attention.",

The former two sites are developed areas with extensive urbanization, which attract larger mobile populations characterized by low immune systems, poor living environments and living conditions, and poor health and knowledge of epidemic prevention measures. The hot spots for HFMD, OIDD, dysentery and Hepatitis E are located in the BTT region and Yangtze River Delta [39]. South China is located closer to the equator with a subtropical monsoon and tropical monsoon climate, which are characterized by high humidity, temperature, rainfall, and wind speed. IIDs are strongly correlated with the climatic character of south China [40], which is a high-risk area for HFMD, OIDD, and TAP. The high-risk areas for TAP were located in southwest China (Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi), which are also the most likely cluster areas and HH cluster areas. The main reasons are that southwest China borders Southeast Asia (Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar), which has a high-risk population due to low sanitation. Moreover, the population of southwest China has a medical history of TAP and very poor climatic, geographical (Karst landform) and sanitation conditions. Finally, personal eating habits contribute to the incidence of TAP [41]. The west area experiences poor sanitation and a lower economy and is a high-incidence area for Hepatitis A and dysentery.",
