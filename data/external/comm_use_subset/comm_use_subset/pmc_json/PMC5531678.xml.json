            "text": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the genus Flavivirus of the family Flaviviridae, which also includes yellow fever (YFV), West Nile (WNV), dengue (DENV) and Japanese encephalitis viruses (JEV) [1]. The genome of ZIKV encodes a large polyprotein precursor that is co- and post-translationally processed by viral and cellular proteases into three structural proteins [capsid (C), precursor of membrane (prM), and envelope (E)] and seven nonstructural proteins [(NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5)] that are involved in virus replication, which takes place in the cytoplasm of the host cell [2]. Like other Flavivirus members, ZIKV relies mainly on arthropods such as mosquitoes or ticks for transmission and thus is classified as an arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus). The main arthropod vectors of ZIKV are Aedes sp. mosquitoes (A. aegypti or A. albopictus) [3]. Along with the vector-borne transmission, other routes of ZIKV transmission have been demonstrated, including sexual transmission, transplacental and perinatal transmission and blood transfusion [4], raising the concern about the global spread of the disease.",

For more than 50 years, ZIKV was rarely reported to cause disease in humans and was commonly associated with mild illness. In 2007, there was an outbreak in the Federated States of Micronesia [6], followed by outbreaks in French Polynesia in 2013\u201314, in which severe neurological complications were reported [7]. Since then, ZIKV is considered to be the most recent emerging arbovirus with pandemic potential [8]. In 2015, autochthonous transmission of ZIKV was confirmed in the northeastern region of Brazil [9]. A dramatic increase in reported cases of microcephaly in the affected Brazilian regions suggested an association between ZIKV infection and fetal malformations [10] and neurological disorders in adults, including Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and meningoencephalitis [11]. In February 2016, the World Health Organization declared a public health emergency of international concern regarding neurological disorders associated with the rapid emergence of ZIKV in Oceania and the Americas [12].",

            "text": "In response to conditions of environmental stress, eukaryotic cells activate kinases (HRI, GCN2, PKR and PERK) that phosphorylate eIF2\u03b1 (eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha) to ease cellular injury or, alternatively, to induce apoptosis. Phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 reduces global translation by impairing the formation of the ternary complex eIF2-GTP-tRNAMet, allowing cells to conserve resources and to initiate a reconfiguration of gene expression to effectively manage stress conditions [13]. Protein synthesis arrest triggers the assembly of stress granules (SG), that are large ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) aggregates formed by stalled translation preinitiation complexes [14, 15]. The major components of SG are untranslated mRNAs, eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIF4E, eIF4G, eIF4A, eIF2), the 40S ribosomal subunit and RNA-binding proteins such as the poly(A) binding protein (PABP), T-cell intracellular antigen 1 (TIA-1), TIA-1-related protein (TIAR), and Ras GTPase activating protein-binding protein 1 (G3BP1) [16]. Distinct cell host processes are interrupted or co-opted during viral infection, leading to the activation of cell stress responses on many levels. SG assembly lowers the cytosolic availability of components of the cellular translation machinery and functions as a platform that connects stress and antiviral innate responses, implying an overall antagonistic relationship between viruses and SGs [17]. In this sense, viruses have evolved a plethora of strategies to guarantee their replication by preventing or blocking SG assembly in infected cells, for example by co-opting RNA granule factors and/or blockage of activation of eIF2\u03b1 kinases, such as PKR [18].",

So far, little is known about how ZIKV modulates stress responses in infected cells. Recently, it was shown that ZIKV infection triggers a potent repression of host cell translation initiation, while viral protein synthesis remains unaffected [19]. The interplay between viral replication and the cellular stress response may contribute to the exacerbated pathogenesis seen in the current epidemic. Elucidation of the interaction of viral components with host factors involved in SG assembly will provide new insight into the pathology of ZIKV infection. In this work, we investigated how ZIKV infection modulates SG assembly.",

Ars is an oxidative agent that rapidly induces SG assembly through phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 [31]. SG assembly was determined by indirect immunofluorescence of TIAR and eIF4G and infected cells were identified by the presence of the viral protein NS1.

            "text": "Many viruses modulate p-eIF2\u03b1 levels during replication to assure viral protein synthesis and avoid cellular stress responses. For example, coronaviruses can induce GADD34 expression to enhance PP1 activity and consequently the dephosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 [34], and herpesviruses encode a viral protein that mimics the function of GADD34 [35]. We examined the phosphorylation status of eIF2\u03b1 in ZIKV infected untreated or Ars treated cells. Protein lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using an antibody specific for eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation at S51. As shown in Fig 4A and 4B, little phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 was detected in mock-infected and untreated Vero cells, with a slight increase in p-eIF2\u03b1 in ZIKV-infected cells. As expected, high levels of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation (40-fold increase) were observed in extracts of mock-infected cells treated with Ars. However, in ZIKV-infected and Ars treated cells, levels of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation were consistently lower (10.5-fold increase). ZIKV replication was confirmed by the detection of the viral protein NS1 in cell extracts. The amount of total eIF2\u03b1 was similar under all conditions tested (Fig 4A), indicating that ZIKV replication does not alter its expression. To further confirm that ZIKV-infected cells exhibit lower levels of p-eIF2\u03b1 under arsenite treatment, phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 was also analyzed by IF/LSCM. As shown in Fig 4C, phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 is strongly induced in the cytoplasm of non-infected cells (blue arrows). In contrast, in ZIKV-infected cells, the phospho-eIF2\u03b1 signal is visibly weaker (red arrow). Upon arsenite treatment, the fluorescence intensity of p-eIF2\u03b1 in infected cells was in average 30% lower in ZIKV-infected cells in comparison to mock-infected cells (Fig 4D). These results indicate that ZIKV infection impairs eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation triggered by oxidative stress.",

To investigate whether this blockage is dependent on the eIF2\u03b1 kinase activated upon stress, Vero cells were mock-infected or infected with ZIKV and at 24 hpi were treated with DTT, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stressor that activates PERK. SG assembly was determined by TIAR puncta and infected cells were identified by the presence of NS1. DTT treatment induced SG assembly in 81.8% of the mock-infected cells (Fig 5A and 5B). In contrast, only 28.6% of ZIKV-infected cells presented SG (Fig 5A and 5B). The blockage of SG assembly correlates with lower levels of p-eIF2\u03b1 upon DTT treated in ZIKV-infected cells (Fig 5C, lane 4) when compared to mock-infected cells (Fig 5C, lane 2). Interestingly, the activation of PERK in DTT-treated cells, demonstrated by an increased PERK mobility, was similar in mock and ZIKV-infected cells (Fig 5C, compare lanes 2 and 4, position 1: activate PERK; position 2: inactive PERK), suggesting that the reduced levels of p-eIF2\u03b1 in infected cells are a result of an interference downstream the activation of the eIF2\u03b1 kinases.",

To test this further, Vero cells were infected with ZIKV and at 24 hpi, the levels of GADD34, a PP1A cofactor, were evaluated. Our results show that are GADD34 levels are significantly higher in ZIKV-infected cells as compared to uninfected cells (Fig 6A and 6B). To evaluate the role of GADD34/PP1A activity on ZIKV-infected cells, we treated cells with salubrinal and its derivative sal003, small molecules that selectively inhibit the PP1/GADD34-mediated dephosphorylation of phospho-eIF2\u03b1 [36, 37]. Vero cells were treated with 75 \u03bcM of salubrinal or 10 \u03bcM of sal003 for 3 h prior to the addition of Ars to the cells. The phosphorylation status of eIF2\u03b1 was evaluated by western blotting analysis (Fig 6C). In cells treated with salubrinal prior to Ars-induced stress, ZIKV-infected cells present higher levels of phospho-eIF2\u03b1 as compared to mock-infected control (Fig 6C, compare lanes 6 and 8). Similar results were obtained with sal003 [37] (S2 Fig). The assembly of SG in the distinct conditions was monitored by indirect immunofluorescence. SGs were induced in 23.1\u00b16.5% of ZIKV-infected cells treated with Ars. This value increased to 47.8\u00b17.0% in cells that were treated with salubrinal prior to Ars-induced stress and was not significantly different from mock-infected cells (Fig 6D and 6E). No significant difference was observed between control or salubrinal pre-treated mock-infected cells (Fig 6E). Hence, inhibiting eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation reduces the ability of ZIKV infection to block Ars-induced SG assembly. These results indicate that eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation is differentially modulated during ZIKV replication and that this feature can contribute to ZIKV-mediated blockage of SG assembly.",

Infection by several types of RNA and DNA viruses results in changes in the cellular environment as viral replication co-opts several cellular pathways, including nutrient, energy and macromolecular synthesis, to produce infectious particles. In this process, viruses trigger the host cell stress response, which can lead to the assembly of SGs [17]. Since viral replication relies on the host translational machinery, most viruses suppress the stress response pathway and SG assembly at some point of their replicative cycle [18]. Interactions between stress proteins and viral components have been described in a large variety of experimental models at different stages of the viral lifecycle, depending on the type of virus and host cell [29, 39].",

            "text": "ZIKV has emerged as a global public health threat over the last decade. Many aspects of the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of this emerging virus remain unclear and require further investigation. In this work, we described that ZIKV replication does not induce SG assembly in Vero cells (Fig 1). This contrasts with the results recently published by Roth and colleagues [19] that describe the assembly of SG-like structures on Huh-7 cells infected with ZIKV. It is possible that those distinct findings are due to the usage of distinct cell lines. In our work, we also show that ZIKV and blocks SG assembly triggered by treatment of cells with Ars (Fig 2) and DTT (Fig 5). These finds are similar to the ones described recently by Roth and colleagues, in which they describe that flaviviruses block SG assembly independently of the eIF2\u03b1 kinase activated by stress [19]. Interestingly, during the review process of this manuscript, Basu and colleagues [40] reported that ZIKV-mediated blockage of SG assembly was specific for oxidative stress induced by arsenite. The reasons why these differences were observed remain to be determined. Several reports have shown that members of the Flaviviridae family modulate SG assembly in infected cells. The 3\u2019 stem loop from the viral minus strand of WNV and DENV captures TIA-1 and TIAR to promote viral genome RNA synthesis and inhibit SG assembly [29, 41]. JEV capsid protein interaction with Caprin-1 leads to the sequestration of several SG components, such as G3BP1 and USP10, in the perinuclear region of infected cells, resulting in impairment of SG assembly [30] and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) blocks Ars-mediated SG assembly [42]. TIA1 and TIAR are recruited to tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) sites of replication [43]. Finally, hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication leads to oscillating SG assembly/disassembly in infected cells through controlling the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 and co-opting TIA-1, TIAR and G3BP1 [44, 45]. More recently, Roth and colleagues [19] demonstrated that DENV and ZIKV uncouple translation suppression from the stress response by a mechanism that is yet to be identified.",

The assembly of SG triggered by both molecules is independent of the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1, suggesting that ZIKV blocks stress granules assembly mainly via eIF2\u03b1 signaling. Interestingly, this does not seem to be a general feature of flaviviral infections, as it has been demonstrated by Roth and colleagues that DENV inhibits SG assembly induced by hippuristanol, an inhibitor of eIF4A RNA binding [19]. The phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 is a key regulator of mRNA translation initiation, and the level of phospho-eIF2\u03b1 is modulated by the activities of kinases and phosphatases [46]. Oxidative stress induced by Ars culminates on eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation by HRI [31], which prevents the recycling of the eIF2-GTP-tRNAMet ternary complex, leading to polysome disassembly and consequent translational arrest and SG assembly [14].",

Our results show that ZIKV attenuates eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation triggered by Ars (Fig 4) and DTT (Fig 5) and this ability is, at least in part, a consequence of modulating its dephosphorylation, as supported by the observation that treatment of cells with salubrinal reverses the ZIKV-mediated blockage of SG assembly induced by Ars (Fig 6). Similar to the finding of Wang and colleagues using coronavirus [34], we demonstrated that ZIKV infection induces a moderate increase in GADD34 expression (Fig 6A and 6B). Recently, Buchman and colleagues [47] described a mechanism by which trehalose modulates p-eIF2\u03b1 levels and stress granule assembly/disassembly by enhancing the expression of GADD34 and CReP. The increase in the cellular levels of the PP1 phosphatase subunits could lead to faster dephosphorylation of p-eIF2\u03b1 and disassembly of SGs, thereby rendering the cells able to recover more quickly from stress. It is possible that the enhanced levels of GADD34 found in ZIKV-infected cells play a similar role in response to stress.",

Modulation of PP1 activity by viral infection was demonstrated for human cytomegalovirus [48], African swine fever virus [49], Newcastle disease virus [50], papillomavirus [51] and herpes simplex virus [52]. ICP34.5 is a protein homologous to GADD34 encoded by HSV that is essential for HSV replication in some cell types. It binds cellular PP1 and promotes eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation, ensuring viral replication despite activation of PKR [35]. Treatment of HSV-infected cells with salubrinal inhibits viral replication in a dose-dependent manner and leads to higher phospho-eIF2\u03b1 levels [36, 52]. Similarly, our results demonstrate that ZIKV replication is severely impaired in salubrinal-treated cells (Fig 7), indicating that ZIKV relies to some extent on eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation for its replication. These findings are distinct from the model proposed by Roth and colleagues [19], in which modulation of SG assembly in ZIKV-infected cells was independent of eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation promoted by elevated GADD34 levels. Cell type-specificities can be responsible for those contrasting results. It remains to be determined whether treatment with salubrinal has secondary effects on the infected cells that could act in synergy with the PP1/GADD34 inhibition and the mechanism by which ZIKV modulates this activity.",
