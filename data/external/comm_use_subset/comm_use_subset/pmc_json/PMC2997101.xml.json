The value of  may or may not be specified and a clustering criterion, typically the squared-error criterion, must be adopted. The -Means algorithm initializes  clusters by arbitrarily selecting one object to represent each cluster. Each of the remaining objects are assigned to a cluster and the clustering criterion is used to calculate the cluster mean. These means are used as the new cluster points and each object is reassigned to the cluster that it is most similar to. This continues until there is no longer a change when the clusters are recalculated. However, it is well-known that depending on the initial centres of the clusters, clustering results can change significantly. We use Gene Cluster \n[4] for comparing our method with -Means.",

To explore the exact origin of SARS, the genomic sequence relationships of  different single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses (both positive and negative strand ssRNA viruses) of various families were studied. Yap et al.\n[16] generate the tetra-nucleotide usage pattern profile for each virus from which a distance matrix based on correlation coefficients is created. We use this distance matrix for the following performance comparison of AH-Cut and Normalized-Cut. See Figure 2 for the dendrogram generated by AH-Cut for this dataset. It is interesting to note that SARS virus is grouped in the same subtree as other corona viruses and is closest to the Feline Corona Virus (FCoV). Notice that these are all positive strand ssRNA viruses. This group of SARS and Corona viruses also contains other viruses (Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PDV), Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGV), Avian infectious bronchitis virus (ABV), Murine hepatitis virus (MHV)). There is also a group of positive strand ssRNA viruses, called \u201cOutliers\u201d, which exhibit differences in their tetra-nucleotide usage pattern from the rest. Yellow Fever Virus (YFV), Avian Encephalomyelitis Virus (AEV), Rabbit Hemorrhagic disease Virus (RHV), Equine arteritis Virus (EV1), Lactate Dehydrogenase-elevating Virus (LDV) were also identified as outliers by Yap et al.\n[16]. This group also includes other ssRNA positive strand viruses - Igbo ora virus (IOV), Bovine viral diarrheoa (BDV), Foot and mouth disease virus C (FMV) and Simina Haemorrhagic fever virus (SFV). The negative strand ssRNA viruses are clustered in two subgroups, one unmixed with the positive strand ssRNA viruses, the remainder in the group \u201cMixed\u201d. The first class (called -ve strand ssRNA viruses in Figure 2) covers Canine Distemper Virus (CDV) and Tioman virus (TV2), Reston Ebola Virus (REV), Bovine Ephemeral Fever Virus (BFV), Hantaan Virus (HV1), Bovine Respiratory syncytial Virus (BRV), Human Respiratory syncytial Virus (HRV) and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV).",

Therefore it is possible that under these conditions the local search component of the memetic algorithm approximates an exhaustive search, or at least has a greater effectiveness.
