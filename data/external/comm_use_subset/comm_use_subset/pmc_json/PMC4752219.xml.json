The main complication of viral respiratory infections is bacterial co-infection and respiratory failure. The synergism between virus and bacteria has been widely discussed in the literature, particularly for respiratory viruses and secondary bacterial pneumonia [2]. Bacteremia rates reported in children with respiratory illness are low, with rates <1.2% in RSV\u2014confirmed cases [3\u20137]. In those requiring mechanical ventilation, bacterial co-infection rates in respiratory samples are consistently higher but may vary, ranging from 21.0% to 43.9% [8,9]. However, the prevalence, clinical phenotype and course of bacteremia with pathogenic bacteria in the setting of acute RSV infection in infants with no other risk factors, are questions that have not been investigated in sufficient detail, even less with the use of molecular diagnostics.",

RSV has been linked to seasonal increases in S. pneumoniae disease [15], as well as to other viruses such as influenza, but the underlying mechanisms between viral and bacterial synergism are complex and remain unclear. Immunization programs with conjugate vaccines against invasive H. influenzae serotype b and Streptococcus pneumoniae have changed the frequency of bacteremia in febrile infants (10,13). In our series, only 14.3% of the PCR positive patients had been vaccinated against pneumococcal disease, as compared to PCR negative ones, with 52.5% having received the vaccine. Animal studies found important mechanism of viral-bacterial synergy between bovine RSV and Histophilus somni and other bacterial pathogens [16]. This could indicate that RSV and H.influenzae have the same infection pattern in human patients.",

Blood culture is considered the gold standard for bacteria detection, but has a low sensitivity and some bacteria are difficult to culture. Blood PCR\u2013much more sensitive\u2013was performed in all the recruited patients but the clinical relevance of its positive result is not clear. Detecting circulating DNA in the blood by PCR has some limitations and it is essential to extrapolate always the results obtained to the clinical grounds to see if both PCR results and the clinical phenotype are consistent [19]. The quantitative PCR and the cycle threshold value are inversely correlated with the bacteria load and could be an indicator to avoid false positive results. In our cohort the cycle threshold was <20, but as we only have seven positive samples we could not establish maximum cutoff levels.",

Bacteremic patients had a more severe course according to PICU admission rates, respiratory support necessity, clinical scales and length of hospitalization. Bloomfield et al. [14] suggest that empirical antibiotics should be considered for any child admitted to PICU with a RSV infection and requiring ventilator. In our series only half the patients who were admitted to PICU and required ventilatory support had a bacteremia revealed by PCR, meaning that antibiotic prescription might be superfluous in up to 50% of the cases. However, PCR was only performed in blood, meaning that we would be only excluding systemic bacterial infection, but not all forms of bacterial superinfection. On the other hand, due to the limited number of bacteremic subjects in our study, further studies are needed to make robust conclusions with regards to the overuse or underuse of antibiotic therapy.",
