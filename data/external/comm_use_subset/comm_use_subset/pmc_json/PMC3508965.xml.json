The mortality rate varies between 20-100%\n[2]. The disease is caused by PHE coronavirus (PHE-CoV), which comprises a single strain and is the only known neurotropic CoV affecting pigs\n[3]. PHE-CoV was isolated for the first time in vivo from breast-feeding pigs suffering from encephalomyelitis in Canada\n[4]. In 1969, an antigenically identical virus was isolated in England from suckling pigs presenting with anorexia, depression, and vomiting, but without clear signs of encephalomyelitis\n[5]. Surviving animals remained stunted in growth, and the condition was therefore called \u2018vomiting and wasting disease\u2019 (VWD). In China, PHE-CoV was first reported in 1986, and it was later described both on the mainland and in the Taiwan Province\n[1,6]. The infection has also been reported in the major pig raising countries of Europe, Asia and North America, where it seemed to be endemic with no clinical outbreaks\n[7-9].",

In 2007, this disease occurred twice in pig farms in the Jilin Province, with incidence rates among 20-day-old piglets as high as 100% and reported mortality rates ranging from 48% and 100%\n[11]. In August 2006, some pig farms in Argentina experienced outbreaks of this disease, leading to 1226 deaths, morbidity rates as high as 52.6% and a mortality rate of 16.9%\n[12].

However, these detection methods are laborious, time-consuming, and require laboratory procedures or special equipment, making them unsuitable for on-site inspection. Current detection strategies are also insufficient to meet the needs of emergent management after PHE outbreaks, thus restricting their application to veterinary clinical diagnosis. Therefore, the development of a sensitive, specific, and easily-performed assay is crucial for the rapid detection and surveillance of PHE-CoV infection and transmission.",

Three days later, their splenic mononuclear cells were isolated and fused with murine myeloma cells (SP2/0) using 50% polyethylene glycol (PEG)-1000 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The hybridomas were generated through the selection of HAT (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) medium and screened using a recombinant S protein-based Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and HI assays. The positive hybridoma cells were cloned by a limiting dilution to obtain four strains of secretory positive antibody hybridoma cells. The stable hybridoma clones of the immunoglobulin G1 MAb 4D4 and 1E2 were injected into Balb/C nude mice and the mouse abdominal dropsy was purified by sequential precipitation with caprylic acid\n[21] and ammonium sulfate and dialyzed against phosphate buffer (0.01 M, pH 7.4) at 4\u00b0C.

Colloidal gold is a negatively charged hydrophobic rubber particle that maintains a stable colloidal system through electrostatic repulsion\n[22]. The key to successful colloidal gold labeling lies in the preparation of a homogeneous mixture of monodispersed colloidal gold particles\n[32]. The microwave oven method was chosen in this experiment because it provides even heating without manual shaking, creating colloidal gold particles that are consistent in size and uniformly distributed, with a mean diameter of about 30 nm under transmission electron microscope. In the preparation of gold markers, proteins and gold glue particles should also be present in an appropriate ratio. If too many antibodies are added, the amount of free antibodies instead of gold-labeled antibodies will increase, which will result in a decreased titer of gold-labeled MAb 4D4, affecting the test\u2019s sensitivity. Conversely, if too few antibodies are added, it is easy for the colloidal particles to aggregate and precipitate, especially during purification by ultracentrifugation. Therefore, it is essential to add sufficient colloidal gold antibodies to maintain stability.",

First, the quality of the MAbs used in the strip test is crucial for the specificity and sensitivity of the strip. In this experiment, both of the MAbs used recognize the HE and S proteins of PHE-CoV and have a high affinity for their respective antigen epitopes. Analysis of the specificity showed the strip to be specific for the detection of PHE-CoV, because it reacted with neither two coronaviruses (TGEV and PEDV) in pigs nor with other group 3 viruses of the Coronaviridae family (BCV, HCV-OC43 and MHV), the common virus HCV, or PRV, to which the clinical symptoms of PHE-CoV are similar. In addition, careful selection of a membrane is critical for high specificity, sensitivity, and rapid detection as the wicking rate and speed of liquid diffusion on the membrane (Millipore Corp SHF135, a liner). The membrane used in this experiment was nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore Corp SHF135, a liner) with a membrane pore size of 0.5-1.0 \u03bcm, IgG binding force constant of 60\u2013100 \u03bcg/cm2, and a chromatography rate of 15\u201320 s/cm. The membrane ensures antibody absorption and the leaching and binding of gold-labeled proteins. These advantages enable the test results to be sensitive and easy to read\n[33].",

PHE-CoV can be isolated from the nasal cavity, trachea, brain, and lungs of diseased or healthy pigs\n[34-36] and the brain had the highest detection rate by nested PCR and RT-PCR\n[15]. Because of RT-PCR and ELISA are also widely applied in clinical practice due to its high sensitivity and specificity\n[37,38]. Thus, a lot of brain tissue samples were collected from deceased piglets with suspected PHE-CoV infection, and using RT-PCR and ELISA as reference test, the relative specificity and sensitivity of the immunochromatographic strip were determined to be 100% and 97.78%, respectively. There was an excellent agreement among the immunochromatographic strip to ELISA and RT-PCR (Kappa = 0.976). The quantifying test result indicated the sensitivity of the strip test to be close to, or slightly less than, that of ELISA and RT-PCR. However, the ELISA and RT-PCR assay each step of the procedure can strongly influence the result if not performed well. The procedure must be strictly followed, with good quality control inside and outside the laboratory, and reagents that ensure the test quality must be selected. Although ELISA and RT-PCR was developed for the detection of PHE-CoV with high specific and sensitivity, it is not suitable for use outside of the research laboratory. In contrast, the procedure for the immunochromatographic strip described in this paper is less laborious and time-consuming than the ELISA and RT-PCR method. Taken together, the results suggested that an immunochromatographic strip was developed with high sensitivity and specificity for detecting PHE-CoV, which could be used for clinical applications.",

Thus, a total of 468 nasal cavity or throat swabs were collected from approximately 1- to 3-week-old piglets, with vomiting and neurological symptoms consistent with PHE-CoV infection, and application of the immunochromatographic strips for diagnosis of PHE-CoV infection in the Jilin province. The positive rate ranged from 61.54% in the Jilin district to 17.95% in the Songyuan district. Notably, the PHE-CoV positive rate was 41.03% in Liaoyuan district in the current study. However, the serum antibody positive rate was only 6.5% in the previous study\n[40]. This may be associated with the samples collected from different herds. These findings suggest that PHE-CoV is commonly transmitted in these districts in the Jilin province. Notably, specific pathogen-free (SPF) pigs, derived from germ-free pigs and given artificial milk, have been introduced extensively in many farms in this area\n[15,41]. Because these animals lack antibodies to certain pathogenic agents, including PHE-CoV, their susceptibility to these agents may be greater. Therefore, reliable testing methods are important for the diagnosis and prevention of PHE-CoV disease, which can cause fatal outbreaks in PHE-CoV seronegative farms.",
