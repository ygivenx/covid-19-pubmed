            "text": "The interferon (IFN) system is the first line of host defenses against pathogen invasion, including viral infections. It protects by producing hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that modulate diverse biological functions. A number of ISGs (such as PKR, RNase L, ISG 15, etc.) have been characterized and shown to suppress viral replication, the mechanisms of which are still poorly defined (reviewed in reference [1]). One exciting development in the last few years has been the discovery of some novel ISGs, also known as cellular restriction factors (such as APOBEC3G, Trim5\u03b1 and Tetherin, etc.), which intrinsically block different steps of retroviral replication [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. It is notable that many viruses, including retroviruses, have evolved to acquire a variety of strategies that evade IFN-mediated restrictions [7], [8], [9]. This type of intrinsic immunity is believed to play crucial roles in virus-host co-evolution and viral pathogenesis [7], [10].",

Originally identified through RNAi genetic screening and shown to inhibit infections by influenza A virus (IAV), West Nile virus and Dengue virus, the IFITM proteins are now known to potently restrict entry and infections by a number of highly pathogenic viruses, including HIV-1, filovirus, and SARS coronavirus [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]. In humans, there are at least 4 functional members of IFITM proteins; IFITM1, 2 and 3 are expressed in a variety of human tissues and cell lines, IFITM5 is limited to the bone and is involved in mineralization [11]. All of these human IFITM proteins have been shown to restrict viral entry and infection, with IFITM3 being generally thought to be the most potent [12], [13], [14], [15], [17], [18]. A recent study demonstrated that the IFITM3 protein significantly restricts the morbidity and mortality associated with influenza, further underscoring the crucial role of IFITM3 in vivo\n[19]. Yount and colleagues recently showed that the mouse IFITM3 protein is not only palmitoylated but also ubiquitinated, and that these posttranslational modifications distinctly regulate the cellular localization of IFITM3 and its anti-influenza activities [20], [21]. While it has been suggested that viral membrane fusion may be blocked by IFITMs [12], [13], [15], direct evidence is still lacking and exactly how IFITM proteins restrict virus entry and infection is currently not known.",

            "text": "Membrane fusion is an essential step for enveloped viruses to enter host cells and initiate infection, a process that is mediated by the viral fusion proteins present on the surface of virions [22]. To prevent premature activation, viral fusion proteins in the mature viral particles are normally metastable and exist at a high-energy state. Once triggered by specific cellular stimuli, such as receptor binding, a low pH, or both, they undergo a series of conformational changes, resulting in the insertion of the fusion peptide of the viral fusion protein into the target cell membrane, leading to hemifusion, pore formation, expansion, and ultimately, complete fusion [23], [24], [25], [26]. While the general principle of viral membrane fusion has been extensively studied, the detailed molecular mechanisms governing this process are still poorly defined [22]. In particular, how viral membrane fusion is modulated by cellular factors other than the specific triggers (such as receptor binding, low pH, cathepsin cleavage, etc.) remains an emerging subject that needs to be explored.",

We chose the Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV) envelope (Env) and IAV hemagglutinin (HA) proteins as the model system of study because of some of their advantages. JSRV is a simple retrovirus, with Env-mediated membrane fusion and entry requiring both receptor-binding and low pH; an initial receptor binding primes the subsequent low pH-dependent conformational changes required for full activation [27], [28], [29], [30]. This unconventional two-step triggering mechanism was originally discovered in the avian sarcoma leukosis virus (ASLV) [31], and has now been suggested to operate in other enveloped viruses, including HCV [32]. Compared to most pH-dependent viruses, JSRV has a relatively high pH threshold (\u223cpH 6.3) for fusion, the process of which likely occurs in a GPI-anchored-protein-enriched endosomal compartment (GEEC) or caveolae [27], [33], [34]. Thus, study of JSRV Env-mediated fusion should lead to new insights into the mechanism of action of the IFITM proteins. IAV is a prototype pH-dependent virus, the entry and infection of which has been shown to be significantly restricted by IFITM proteins, particularly IFITM3, both in vitro and in vivo\n[12], [13], [19]. In addition to JSRV Env and IAV HA, which belong to class I fusion proteins, we also explored the inhibitory effects of IFITM proteins on membrane fusion induced by the Semliki Forest virus (SFV) E1/E2 and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G proteins, which represent class II and III viral fusion proteins, respectively [22]. Hence, the mechanisms uncovered from this study are likely applicable to other viral fusion proteins, and collectively provide critical new insight into our understanding the mechanism by which IFITM proteins restrict viral membrane fusion and entry.",

Here we examined if IFITM proteins also restrict entry of JSRV, whose Env-mediated membrane fusion readily occurs at pH 6.3 or even higher [27], [33]. We did so by creating several stable lines expressing human IFITM1, 2 or 3 and testing their effects on JSRV entry, along with that of several other viruses. We observed that all three IFITM proteins effectively inhibited the infections of MoMLV pseudovirions bearing either IAV HA/NA or VSV-G in HTX cells (a subclone of the HT1080 cell line), with approximately equivalent efficiency (Fig. 1A; p<0.01). Interestingly, the JSRV pseudovirion infection in HTX cells was inhibited by IFITM1 (p<0.01) to a much greater extent than by IFITM2 and 3 (p<0.01 and p<0.05, respectively) (Fig. 1A). IFITM1 also moderately, but consistently, inhibited the infection by amphotropic 10A1 MLV pseudovirions (p<0.05), yet IFITM2 and 3 did not inhibit and even somewhat enhanced entry (Fig. 1A). Similar results were also obtained in 293 cells, where IFITM1 caused the greatest restriction of JSRV entry (p<0.01), although the overall restriction efficiency of these IFITM proteins on VSV and IAV entry was relatively low (Fig. 1B), consistent with a previous report [13]. Immunoblotting revealed that all three IFITM proteins were expressed in both HTX and 293 cells (Figs. 1C and D), with IFITM3 exhibiting a relatively low level of expression in HTX cells (Fig. 1C), which might have contributed to its relatively low antiviral activities in this cell line.",

We observed that IFN-\u03b12b significantly inhibited infection of 293 cells by JSRV, VSV and IAV pseudovirions (Fig. 1E; p<0.01; data not shown for HTX cells). Interestingly, entry of 10A1 MLV was also slightly but consistently blocked by the IFN-\u03b12b treatment (Fig. 1E; p<0.05), similar to previous reports [13], [36]. The greater inhibitory effect of IFN on IAV and VSV entry into 293 cells (Fig. 1E) relative to that of overexpressing individual IFITM proteins (Fig. 1B) was unexpected because IFITM proteins had higher levels when overexpressed than when induced by IFN (Fig. S2). Perhaps IFITMs induced by IFN synergistically cooperated to inhibit viral entry; additionally, ISGs other than IFITMs might have contributed to the observed effects of IFN treatment in 293 cells. No cytotoxicity was observed for the doses of IFN applied during the viral infection period.",

We observed that, indeed, the entry of JSRV and IAV, and to a lesser extent that of VSV, was enhanced in K562 cells stably expressing shRNA against IFITM1 or 3 (kind gifts of Michael Farzan and I-Chueh Huang, Harvard Medical School) [13] as compared to the parental K562 cells (Fig. 1F; p<0.01 or 0.05). The entry of 10A1 MLV was also slightly enhanced by shRNA targeting IFITM1, but the increase was not statistically significant (Fig. 1F; p>0.05). shRNA did not significantly reduce IFITM2 in K562 cells, and thus we could not assess the consequences of reducing of this protein (data not shown).

Given that the JSRV receptor, hyaluronidase 2 (Hyal2), is a GPI-anchored protein that is localized in lipid rafts and that JSRV may use a GPI-anchored-protein-enriched endosomal compartment (GEEC) and/or a caveolar pathway for entry [33], [34], [39], [40], we considered the possibility that IFITM1 could preferentially interfere with the binding of JSRV Env to Hyal2, thereby restricting viral entry. We took advantage of a soluble form of the JSRV SU-human IgG fusion protein (JSU-hFc) we previously created, and performed an in vitro binding assay on HTX cells expressing individual IFITM proteins and functional human Hyal2 [27], [28], [29], [41]. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that the fluorescence shifts in HTX cells expressing IFITM proteins, including that of IFITM1, were similar to those of parental cells (Figs. 2A and B). This indicates that expression of IFITM proteins did not affect the binding of JSRV Env to HTX cells expressing the Hyal2 receptor. We also performed virus binding assays using Gag-YFP-expressing MoMLV (kind gifts of Walter Mothes) pseudoviral particles bearing JSRV Env [28], [42]; again, similar fluorescence intensities were observed among cells expressing IFITM proteins and parental cells (Figs. 2C and D). The expression of IFITM proteins on the surface of HTX cells was also examined by using an anti-FLAG antibody. IFITM1 had a relatively higher level of surface expression as compared to IFITM2 and 3, but overall the fluorescence signals were low and their differences were not statistically different (Figs. 2E and F; data not shown). We conclude that expression of IFITM proteins, including IFITM1, does not affect the binding of JSRV Env to its Hyal2 receptor on the cell surface.",

This unusual feature allowed us to examine if IFITM proteins may affect receptor-mediated priming for fusion. We performed metabolic labeling of 293T cells co-expressing IFITMs and JSRV Env, and determined shedding of JSRV SU in the presence or absence of a soluble form of Hyal2 (sHyal2). In our previous studies, we had established that shedding of JSRV SU into culture media is an important indicator of Hyal2 receptor-mediated triggering for the fusion activation of JSRV Env [28], [29], [30]. Here we observed that the levels of JSRV SU harvested from the culture media of 293T cells expressing IFITM1, 2 or 3 were comparable to those of parental cells, and that they all increased with the presence of sHyal2 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2H). The total levels of JSRV Env expression in these radiolabeled cells were approximately equivalent, as evidenced by the intensities of Env precursors and processed TMs (Fig. 2G). Collectively, we conclude that overexpression of IFITM proteins, including IFITM1, does not affect the expression and trafficking of JSRV Env, nor does it impair receptor-mediated priming for fusion activation.",

We sought to obtain direct evidence that IFITM proteins may restrict viral membrane fusion mediated by JSRV Env and other viral fusion proteins. As JSRV Env requires Hyal2 overexpression for membrane fusion to be detected at low pH [27], we generated stable HTX and 293 cell lines overexpressing Hyal2 and IFITM1, 2 or 3, which served as target cells for the syncytia formation and cell-cell fusion assays described below. For parental 293 cells overexpressing Hyal2 (293/LH2SN, mock), we observed almost complete syncytia formation (\u223c100%) induced by JSRV Env and IAV HA within 5\u201310 min after a pH 5.0 pulse (Fig. 3A). In sharp contrast, very little syncytia formation was detected in 293/LH2SN cells expressing IFITM1, even after a 1 h recovery period (Fig. 3A). Syncytia formation was also substantially reduced in 293/LH2SN cells expressing IFITM2, but the reduction was much less in cells expressing IFITM3, especially in the case of JSRV Env (Fig. 3A). There is much less or no inhibitory effect of these IFITM proteins on entry of 10A1 MLV (a virus that fuses at neutral pH, Fig. 2B) [12], [13]. We therefore measured syncytia formation induced by 10A1 MLV Env (with its R peptide deleted) at neutral pH and found, as predicted, that it was not significantly affected by IFITMs (Fig. 3A). The fusion efficiency of 10A1 MLV Env in IFITM1, 2 and 3-expressing cells, as quantified using fusion index (0.51\u00b10.06, 0.50\u00b10.05 and 0.52\u00b10.04, respectively), was comparable to that in parental cells (0.52\u00b10.06). A similar order of syncytia inhibition by the IFITMs, i.e., IFITM1>IFITM2>IFITM3, on JSRV Env and IAV HA was also obtained in cells expressing WT IFITM proteins (without the N-terminal FLAG tags) (Fig. S3). The differential inhibitory effects of IFITMs on syncytia formation of JSRV Env and IAV HA in 293/LH2SN cells were unlikely due to their levels of IFITM expression, which were examined by Western blots (Fig. 3B). Flow cytometry analysis of 293T cells co-expressing JSRV Env and WT IFITM proteins showed that the levels of JSRV Env on the surface of IFITM-expressing cells were comparable to that of the mock control (Fig. 3C), indicating that the reduced syncytia formation was not due to a change in the Env surface expression.",

Under these pH conditions, IFITM1 consistently exhibited the strongest inhibition on syncytia formation induced by JSRV Env (Fig. S4). Further lowering the pH (pH 4.0) or incubating 293 cells with an increased concentration of sHyal2 (up to 30 \u00b5g/ml) did not overcome the IFITM1-mediated restriction on fusion (data not shown), suggesting that the block by IFITM1 does not occur at the triggering step. It has been previously established for influenza HA that progressively lowering pH causes the activation of more fusion proteins; rather than causing each individual protein to undergo increasingly extensive conformational changes [44], [45]. Based on the results of JSRV Env described here, we conclude that the mechanism of IFITM inhibition is independent of fusion protein density.",

We expressed JSRV Env in 293T effector cells stably expressing GFP, and labeled HTX/LH2SN target cells expressing IFITM proteins with a red-fluorescent dye, CMTMR; cell-cell fusion was measured by a fluorescence microscope and flow cytometry [27]. Similar to the syncytia formation results (Fig. 3A), IFITM1 exhibited the strongest inhibition, reducing the cell-cell fusion efficiency of JSRV Env by \u223c50% (Figs. 4A, B and C; p<0.01). IFITM2 and 3 also suppressed cell-cell fusion, but with much less efficiency (Figs. 4A, B and C; p<0.01). Given that the sizes of fused cells in parental HTX/LH2SN cells were much larger than those of fused cells in IFITM1-expressing cells (Fig. 4A), and that the cell populations with larger size were excluded from flow cytometry analysis, it is likely that the percent of fusion reduction measured by flow cytometry (Figs. 4B and C) underestimates the inhibitory effect of IFITM proteins (see another cell-cell fusion assay below). Nevertheless, these experiments provide clear indication that the content transfer resulting from cell-cell fusion by JSRV Env was inhibited by IFITM proteins.",

Expressing IFITM1 in effector cells (Fig. 4D, column 3; Fig. 4E) was as effective in reducing cell-cell fusion by JSRV Env as expressing IFITM1 in target cells (Fig. 4D, column 2; Fig. 4E), and co-expressing IFITM1 in both effector and target cells enhanced this inhibitory effect (Fig. 4D, column 4; compare columns 2 and 3 with column 4; p<0.05 in both cases; Fig. 4E). Thus, the inhibition of cell-cell fusion by IFITM1 is not specifically related to its expression in effector or target cells. This result suggests that IFITM proteins are unlikely to suppress cell-cell fusion by directly acting on specific viral fusion proteins or their corresponding receptors, but rather through a common physical mechanism(s) (see below).",

To address this question, we took advantage of our previous finding that JSRV pseudovirions are virtually resistant to low pH inactivation and that an extracellular low pH pulse can overcome proton pump inhibitor\u2013mediated block of JSRV entry [27], [33], [34]. We pretreated JSRV pseudovirion-bound HTX or HTX/IFITM1 cells with 20 nM bafilomycin A1 (BafA1), followed by a pH-5.0 pulse for 5\u201310 min; cells were then allowed for infection for 4 h in the presence of BafA1. We observed that, while low pH substantially rescued the BafA1-mediated block in both the parental HTX and HTX/IFITM1 cells, as would be expected [33], [34], the low pH treatment did not increase the JSRV titer in HTX/IFITM1 cells to a level that was similar to that of parental HTX cells (Fig. 4F). This result apparently differed from that of SARS coronavirus, whose fusion inhibition by IFITMs had been previously shown to be bypassed by trypsin [13]. Overall, our data suggest that IFITM1 expressed on the plasma membrane effectively blocks the forced entry of JSRV rendered by the low pH pulse, and this is consistent with the cell-cell fusion data.",

In these experiments, effector cells were the NIH 3T3-derived HAB2 cell line stably expressing IAV HA (kind gift of Judy White) [46] or COS7 transiently transfected with plasmids encoding SFV E1/E2 or VSV-G; we labeled these cells with calcein-AM. We loaded the target 293/LH2SN cells expressing individual IFITM proteins (the same cell lines as used for the syncytia formation assay shown in Fig. 3) with CMAC, allowing aqueous dye transfer during fusion to be monitored by a fluorescence microscope. We found that, somewhat surprisingly, both IFITM1 and 3 strongly inhibited membrane fusion induced by all three classes of viral fusion proteins, and their efficiencies were almost the same. IFITM2 also inhibited viral membrane fusion, but the efficiency was generally low (Figs. 5A, B and C), consistent with the results of syncytia formation (Fig. 3A) and the GFP-transfer cell-cell fusion assay described above (Fig. 4). Even more surprisingly, we observed that when the JSRV Env protein was expressed in COS7 cells as effector, Env-mediated fusion was also markedly suppressed by IFITM3 (Fig. 5D). This was in sharp contrast to the situation in which IFITM3 had essentially no effect on fusion when 293T cells were used as effector cells to express JSRV Env (Fig. 5E).",

Consistent with this notion, COS7 cells expressing human IFITM3 (also engineered to co-express human Hyal2, because COS7 cells are not permissive to JSRV infection) drastically suppressed JSRV entry, with efficiency almost equivalent to that of IFITM1 (Figs. 5F and S5A). This observation was in sharp contrast to the situations in HTX and 293 cells, where IFITM3 had much less effect (Figs. 1A and B). Similarly, the syncytia forming activity of JSRV Env, as well as that of IAV HA, was almost equally inhibited by human IFITM3 and IFITM1 in COS7 cells (Fig. S5B) as compared to that in 293/LH2SN cells (Fig. 3A). This cell type-dependent effect on cell-cell fusion mirrored prior reports showing that the IFITM-mediated restriction on viral entry and infection is also cell type dependent [13], [15]. Collectively, our data demonstrated that these three human IFITM proteins potently suppress cell-cell fusion induced by all three classes of viral fusion proteins.",

            "text": "We next examined which steps of the viral membrane fusion process are inhibited by IFITM proteins. For this purpose, we used conditions that, in the absence of IFITM proteins, allow fusion to proceed up to and through the point of hemifusion while preventing the steps that lead to pore formation. We did so by creating an intermediate of fusion, referred to as a cold arrested state (CAS). It has been previously shown that for viral fusion proteins that induce fusion at low pH, lowering pH at the low temperature of 4\u00b0C yields hemifusion; raising temperature at neutral pH then leads to pore formation and growth [47], [48], [49]. We created CAS for JSRV Env and IAV HA, and found, as expected, that membrane fusion did not occur (Figs. 6A and B, middle panels). Adding CPZ at neutral pH and low temperature to the parental cells (mock) resulted in a significant aqueous dye transfer (Figs. 6A, C, and D). Any further dye transfer upon subsequently raising of temperature to 37\u00b0C was not statistically significant (Figs. 6A, C and D). For target cells expressing IFITM proteins, aqueous dye spread upon CPZ addition at CAS was much less than for the parental cells (Figs. 6B, C and D). In contrast, raising the temperature led to a significant increase in dye spread; but the total dye spread was still less than for the parental cells (Figs. 6B, C and D). The fact that the amount of dye spread induced by CPZ was relatively small showed that little hemifusion occurred for the IFITM-expressing cells. The greater amount of dye spread upon raising temperature indicated that the IFITM proteins in the target cell membrane block the creation of hemifusion. Temperature dependence of protein conformational changes is generally greater than for those of lipids that are not near a phase transition. We therefore assume that the presence of IFITM proteins blocked the conformations changes in JSRV Env and IAV HA needed for hemifusion. But it is possible that the decrease in membrane fluidity caused by IFITM proteins (see below) inhibits lipids from rearranging into a hemifusion configurations.",

Therefore, making the spontaneous curvature more negative should oppose the inhibitory actions of IFITMs and thereby promote hemifusion. We tested this by adding oleic acid (OA) to aqueous solutions for 15 min to allow them to incorporate into plasma membranes. We observed that creating CAS in the presence of OA led to more fusion both when adding CPZ (Fig. 7A, compare second columns with first columns in each cell line) and raising temperature (Fig. 7B, compare second columns with first columns in each cell line). For the parental target cells, the addition of OA resulted in fusion between almost all cell pairs (Figs. 7A and B). For target cells expressing IFITM proteins, OA-addition led to a great increase in the percentage of cells pairs that fused (Figs. 7A and B). In sharp contrast, incorporating OA into membranes subsequent to creating CAS was much less effective in promoting fusion upon either the addition of CPZ or the raising of the temperature (Figs. 7A and B, compare third columns with second columns in each cell line). The almost complete rescue of IFITM-mediated restriction on hemifusion by OA further supports the notion that the major block in fusion caused by ITIFM proteins in target membranes occurs upstream of hemifusion. The presence of IFITMs likely blocks hemifusion by making the spontaneous curvature of outer leaflets of plasma membranes more positive.",

To explore these possibilities, we labeled 293/LH2SN cells expressing IFITM1, 2 or 3 or mock control with Laurdan, a hydrophobic fluorescent probe that is highly sensitive to lipid phases, and measured their generalized polarization (GP) values and florescence lifetimes using 2-photon laser scanning and fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) [52], [53]. Because of its large excited state dipole moment to align surrounding water molecule in the energy dissipation process, Laurdan has been commonly used to report the extent of water penetration into the lipid bilayer, which correlates with lipid packing [52], [54]. In general, higher GP values and longer lifetimes indicate that the membranes are more molecularly ordered, while lower GP values and shorter lifetimes mark membranes as less molecularly ordered [52]. In mock control cells, the GP distribution was characterized by two peaks, one with a lower GP, associated with intracellular membranes, and another with a higher GP, identified with plasma membranes; the less ordered populations were predominant in the mock controls (Figs. 8A\u2013D; first row). In cells treated with methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (M\u03b2CD), a cholesterol-depleting reagent known to make the membrane less ordered [55], we observed dramatically reduced GP signals, resulting in an almost complete loss of the higher GP peak in the histogram (Figs. 8A\u2013D; second row). In sharp contrast, cells expressing IFITM1, 2 or 3 all exhibited marked increases in the GP value, which was particularly evident in the higher GP peak (Fig. 8A\u2013D; third, fourth and fifth rows), suggesting that these cell membranes are more ordered than those of mock controls.",

Unfortunately, we have been unable to distinguish the lipid order of endosomal membranes from that of total intracellular membranes in this analysis. Noticeably, IFITM2 exhibited modest increases in the GP value (p = 0.1388) (Fig. 8E), which correlated its less inhibitory effect on syncytia formation and cell-cell fusion (Figs. 3, 4 and 5). The increased lipid order in cells expressing IFITM proteins was also evidenced by their longer FLIM lifetimes as compared to those of mock controls and M\u03b2CD-treated cells (Fig. S6).

Previous studies have suggested that these proteins, particularly IFITM3, predominantly restrict viruses that fuse in the late endosomal or lysosomal compartments at a lower pH [12], [13], [14], [17], [18]. Here we provide evidence that this family of proteins can also effectively restrict viruses that fuse with a higher pH threshold, such as JSRV (\u223cpH 6.3) which requires both receptor binding and low pH to co-trigger membrane fusion activation. This activation process likely occurs in the GPI-anchored-protein-enriched endosomal compartment or caveolin-associated compartments [27], [29], [33]. Interestingly, we found that, among the three human IFITM proteins examined, IFITM1 was more active than IFITM2 and 3 in restricting JSRV Entry (Figs. 1A and B). This was not because of downregulation of JSRV Env or its Hyal2 receptor, nor due to a perturbation of receptor-mediated priming for fusion activation (Fig. 2). Instead, results of syncytia formation and cell-cell fusion experiments showed that JSRV Env-mediated fusion at low pH was profoundly inhibited by IFITM1 (Figs. 3, 4 and 5). Given that an extracellular low pH pulse cannot bypass the IFITM1-mediated inhibition of endosomal entry of JSRV (Fig. 4F), and that IFITM proteins do not inhibit 10A1 MLV Env-mediated fusion at neutral pH (Fig. 3), we conclude that the syncytia formation and cell-cell fusion assays employed in this study can reflect the situation of viral membrane fusion in endosomes, which is believed to be the predominant site of IFITM-mediated inhibition of viral entry.",

The exact mechanism underlying these observations is currently unknown, but could be related, in part, to the relatively higher levels of IFITM1 expression on the cell surface in 293 cells as compared to that of IFITM2 and 3 (Fig. 1E and F). Quantitative cell-cell fusion analysis confirmed the syncytia formation data (Fig. 5), but also revealed that IFITM3 dramatically inhibited viral membrane fusion when COS7, rather than 293T, was used as effector cells (Figs. 4, 5 and Fig. S5). These results indicate that the effects of IFITM proteins on viral membrane fusion can be cell type dependent, which agrees with previous observations on viral entry [13], [15]. Because all three human IFITM proteins tested exhibited potent restriction of viral membrane fusion induced by all three classes of viral fusion proteins that have different structures (Fig. 5), we suggest that a common physical mechanism, rather than specific interactions with viral fusion proteins, is responsible. Results from our series of experiments support this hypothesis.",

It has been previously established that CAS is a state of hemifusion, and that the addition of CPZ to cells at the CAS intermediate leads to full fusion [47], [57]. It is also known that for cells brought to CAS by fusion proteins that are triggered by acidic conditions, raising the temperature at neutral pH leads to full fusion [47], [48], [58]. We observed that the extent of aqueous dye spread in target cells expressing IFITM proteins was much less upon CPZ addition or upon raising the temperature from CAS than was fusion induced by lowering pH at 37\u00b0C (Fig. 6). These findings provide strong evidence that IFITM proteins inhibit the creation of hemifusion. Because the effects caused by adding CPZ or raising the temperature were qualitatively similar for JSRV Env and IAV HA (Figs. 6C and D), we conclude that the mechanism of inhibition by IFITM proteins is not dependent on the precise fusion protein. Although IFITM proteins may affect pore formation and/or expansion, their primary mechanism appears to be the prevention of hemifusion.",

It has been repeatedly shown that hemifusion is promoted by negative spontaneous curvature and is inhibited by positive spontaneous curvature [51], [57]. Consequently, if IFITM proteins conferred positive spontaneous curvature to membranes that contain them, these proteins would naturally block hemifusion. As OA has a large negative spontaneous curvature [57], we reasoned that it should overcome the inhibitory actions of IFITM proteins if the curvature was at the core of the action of IFITMs. Experimentally, we observed that the addition of OA virtually overcame all of the block of fusion by IFITM proteins (Figs. 7A and B). That is, when hemifusion was induced by the addition of OA, pore formation readily resulted without any inhibition despite the expression of IFITM proteins in the target membrane. The fact that the addition of OA after establishing CAS had no apparent effect on IFITM-mediated inhibition further supports the conclusion that the block occurs at steps prior to the creation of hemifusion (Figs. 7A and B).",

            "text": "How can IFITM proteins block hemifusion? Our Laurdan labeling experiments showed that IFITM-expressing cell membranes were more ordered than those of mock controls, as evidenced by their increased GP values and longer FLIM lifetimes (Figs. 5, 8, and S6). The increase in the lipid order of IFITM-expressing cells, particularly in their plasma membranes, correlates with the potency of IFITMs in suppressing viral membrane fusion (Fig. 8 and Fig. S6). Thus, IFITM proteins may block hemifusion by decreasing the fluidity of the membrane that contains them: a decreased fluidity would reduce the ability of lipids to undergo movements necessary for achieving hemifusion. It is also possible that the increased exclusion of water from the bilayer, as indicated by the higher GP values in the presence of the proteins (Fig. 8) is due to an increased average area occupied by lipid headgroups relative to the area swept out by their acyl chains. This would be equivalent to a greater positive spontaneous curvature. It remains possible that expression of IFITM proteins alters the lipid composition of cell membranes, thereby influencing their fluidities and spontaneous curvatures. We emphasize that while changes in lipid order and membrane fluidity likely account for the general inhibitory effect of IFITMs on viral membrane fusion, they do not fully explain the virus-specific and somewhat cell type-dependent inhibition of IFITMs on viral entry as reported in this and previous studies (Figs. 1, 4 and 5; Fig. S5) [12], [13], [15]. Additional factors are likely to be involved, such as specific IFITM-binding partners and possibly viral elements that modulate IFITM-mediated inhibition of viral entry. In this respect, IFITM proteins may or may not influence cell-cell fusion mediated by developmental and cellular fusogens, depending on the specific cell systems that express IFITMs and cellular fusogens.",

            "text": "The reason IFITM proteins promote greater lipid order remains unclear, but we offer a suggestion. IFITM proteins may directly change membrane curvature by adopting an unconventional membrane topology or topologies that function as a wedge to generate positive spontaneous curvature. There is an increased appreciation that lipid-binding proteins, along with lipids themselves, can influence membrane curvature, which has been shown to be crucial for vesicular trafficking and membrane fusion [59], [60]. Results of continuum membrane mechanics show that the spontaneous curvature of the monolayer of the target membrane proximal to the membrane expressing the fusion proteins (i.e., outer leaflets) affects hemifusion, but the spontaneous curvature of the distal monolayer (i.e., inner leaflets) does not [61]. Given our experimental data showing that IFITM proteins block hemifusion (Figs. 6 and 7), we suggest that IFITM proteins affect the outer monolayer, probably by spanning part or all of the outer monolayer. This suggestion is in line with the predicted membrane topology of IFITM proteins [11], in which N- and C-termini face the lumens of vesicles. It is also supported by prior and our current work showing that both the N and C-terminally tagged epitopes of IFITM3 can be, though not prominently, detected by flow cytometry and immunostaining without permeabilization (Figs. 2E and F) [12], [14].",

            "text": "A recent study suggested that the mouse IFITM3 protein adopt an alternate topology [20]. In this report, the authors provided evidence that the originally predicted transmembrane domains of IFITM3 fold into a hairpin loop and span only the inner leaflets, resulting in an intramembrane topology with both N- and C-termini facing the cytosol [20]. While our data does not unambiguously demonstrate the existence of this alternate topology, it is possible that IFITM proteins adopts multiple and dynamic topologies. In fact, it has been shown that some transmembrane proteins, including those of viral glycoproteins, adopt dual or dynamic topologies because of \u201clipid flip-flop\u201d and/or changes in the net charge of their cytosolic sequences [62], [63], [64]. Dynamic topologies could result from the cleavages of IFITM proteins that have been observed at both the N- and C-termini in mammalian cells [11], [19], [65] (our unpublished data). It is therefore possible that IFITM proteins, including their orthologs in different species which differ significantly at the N- and C-termini [11], adopt distinct topologies in mammalian cells; these sequence and topologic differences may account for, and contribute to, their somewhat distinct phenotypes in suppressing viral membrane fusion and entry into host cells.",

(C) Expression of IFITM proteins does not downregulate the JSRV Env expression on the cell surface. 293T cells were co-transfected with plasmid DNAs encoding FLAG-tagged JSRV Env (at both the N- and C-termini) plus indicated wildtype IFITMs. Cells were incubated with an anti-FLAG antibody on ice, and the surface expression of JSRV SU was determined by flow cytometry. A second antibody alone was used control. (D) 293/LH2SN cells were transfected with plasmids encoding JSRV Env, IAV HA, or 10A1 MLV Env with the R peptide deleted; 6 h after transfection, cells were treated with indicated amounts of IFN-\u03b12b or medium for 24 h. Cells were exposed to a pH 5.0 buffer for 1 min (for JSRV Env and IAV HA) or left untreated and examined for syncytia formation.",

Cells were then switched to 37\u00b0C or treated with CPZ, cell-cell fusion were monitored under a fluorescence microscope. (A) In mock cells (JSRV Env-mediated fusion): Upon raising temperature from the 4\u00b0C of CAS to 37\u00b0C, the two target cells of the image became labeled by calcein-AM (arrows), illustrating that fusion was now extensive. Similarly, adding CPZ to cells at CAS also led two target cells receiving calcein-AM, illustrating that fusion was as extensive upon addition of CPZ as upon raising temperature. (B) In IFITM1-expressing cells (JSRV Env-mediated fusion): Raising temperature led to calcein transfer to only one (arrow) of the four target cells. Addition of CPZ did not lead to calcein-AM transfer to any of the three target cells. (C\u2013D) The quantifications of these phenomena are presented in JSRV Env (C) and for IAV HA (D).
