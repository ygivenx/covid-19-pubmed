A\nlarge number of transgenic animals (TAs) have been produced since for\nscientific purposes, to improve livestock and to produce RPs\n[4\u20139].\nUntil the end of the past century, TAs had been considered to be the most\npromising models for producing human RPs and monoclonal antibodies (mAb). Yet,\nit was mammalian cell cultures (Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) in\nparticular) that played the dominant role in the production of RPs. Thus, 312\ntherapeutic products obtained using living organisms had been introduced to the\nU.S. market by 2012 [10]. A total of 193\nproducts were obtained using mammalian cell cultures, and 42 of them were\nproduced using CHO cell cultures. This has been largely attributed to the fact\nthat it was not until 2006 that the European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA)\napproved antithrombin, the first recombinant protein derived from the milk of\ntransgenic goats [11]. This protein was\nsubsequently approved for commercialization by the United States\u2019 Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA) as a drug that prevents blood clotting in patients with\nhereditary antithrombin deficiency. In 2011, the EMEA approved the use of the\nrecombinant C1-esterase inhibitor produced in rabbits for the treatment of\nhereditary angioedema. The arrival on the market of the first therapeutic\nproducts produced using TAs and their approval for medical use suggest that RPs\ncould carve out a significant niche in biotechnology in the near future. Some\nbiotechnology companies (PPL Therapeutics (England), GTC Biotherapeutics (USA)\n(acquired by LFB Biotechnologies, France, in 2010), Hematech (USA), Genzyme\n(USA), ZymoGenetics (USA), Nexia Biotechnologies (Canada), Pharming\n(Netherlands), BioProtein Technologies (France), Avigenics (USA), Viragen\n(USA), and TranXenoGen (USA)) are actively working on developing this\ntechnology. This review discusses the general concepts behind generating TAs\nfor the production of human RPs and mAb.\n",

Today, DNA microinjection into the\nmale pronucleus of a zygote is the most commonly used method [12]\n(Fig. 1). As it enters\nthe nucleus, linear DNA is capable of integrating into the genome of cell lines\nor living organisms [13]. DNA is usually\nintegrated into transcriptionally inactive gene-poor regions and into\nheterochromatin. From one to several or even hundreds of copies of the injected\nconstruct can integrate into one genomic site. This technology was initially\ntested on mice, and it remains a reliable method for the production of TAs.\nThis method was used to produce the first agricultural TAs. However, MI is now\nused mainly to produce transgenic mice, rabbits and pigs. This is attributed to\nthe insufficient efficiency of the method due to the low frequency of\nincorporation of recombinant DNA into the genome and the availability of\nzygotes at the two pronuclear stages. The result depends on carrying out a\nlarge number of surgical procedures, which entails the need to keep a\nsubstantial number (200\u2013300 heads) of experimental livestock and perform\nskilled animal handling. Furthermore, the only way to determine the expression\nlevel of the integrated transgene is to examine the original TAs and their\noffspring. The reproductive cycle in large animals (including the time before\nthey reach physiological maturity and the need to obtain females producing RPs\nin milk from the original transgenic males) is approximately 0.9/2.3 years for\ngoat females/males, 1.0/2.3 years for pigs, and 2.3/4.5 years for cows. These\nlimitations increase the cost of obtaining the original TAs and the time\nrequired to organize the work.\n",

Insulators are the regulatory elements that block\nthe interaction between an enhancer and a promoter, if located between them\n[40, 41]. Moreover, some insulators can act as a boundary between the\ntranscriptionally active chromatin and heterochromatin. The insulator from a\ncluster of chicken \u03b2-globin genes (HS4 insulator) is one of the most intensely\nstudied vertebrate insulators. It is 1200 bp long and is located at the 5\u2019-end\nof the \u03b2-globin locus [42]. A 250-bp-long core region characterized by full\ninsulator activity has been found in it. This segment contains the binding site\nfor the CTC F protein, which is the only characterized vertebrate insulator\nprotein [43]. The CTC F protein is responsible for the ability of the HS4\ninsulator to block enhancers. It also assists the USF1 and USF2 proteins (which\nform the boundary between active chromatin and heterochromatin) to bind to the\ninsulator [44]. The HS4 insulator sequence also binds to the BGP1/Vezf1 protein\n[45], which protects the GC-rich sequences of an insulator against methylation,\nwhich leads to a disruption of the binding of insulator proteins to DNA and, as\na result, to inactivation of the insulator. According to the existing model,\nBGP1/Vezf1 also terminates the weak transcription initiated in the\nheterochromatic region, which can play an important role in protecting the\n\u03b2-globin locus against the propagation of inactive chromatin [46]. The pBC1\nvector constructed by Invitrogen (USA) for TAs production contains two\n1.2-kb-long copies of the HS4 insulator at the 5\u2019-end of the vector\n(Fig. 2B).\nA thorough analysis of the effect of the HS4\ninsulator on the transcriptional activity of several promoters, including the\ngoat \u03b2-casein promoter and rabbit WAP-promoter, demonstrated that the insulator\nsignificantly increases the level of transgene expression and the number of\ntransgenic lines that are characterized by a significant production of the\ntarget protein [22, 47\u201350]. Meanwhile, the HS4 insulator neither affects the\nvariability of the transgene expression and its ectopic expression in other\ntissues of the organism nor ensures a direct correlation between the number of\ntransgene copies and its level of expression. Thus, the HS4 insulator acts as a\nuniversal transcription regulator that can be used to increase the activity of\nweak promoters. However, it does not allow to achieve efficient transgene\nexpression exclusively in a mammary gland, which is important for the\nproduction of many target proteins that can adversely affect the health of TAs.\n",

Vectors\nbased on bacterial artificial chromosomes (bacmids), which enable cloning of\nsequences up to 400 kb long, can be used to prepare these extended gene\nconstructs [51,\n52]. The regulatory regions of\ntissue-specific genes can occupy large genomic regions and be a part of the\nneighboring genes. For example, several enhancers that stimulate the pig WAP\ngene are found 140 kb away from the gene they regulate and are separated from\nit by the other genes [53]. When large\nDNA fragments are used, it is highly likely that all of the regulatory elements\nof this gene are included in the transgene. It is assumed that the use of this\napproach results in specific transgene expression exclusively in the mammary\ngland and that the influence of the surrounding chromatin on transgene expression\nis minimized. This approach allows one to obtain TAs whose level of transgene\nexpression closely corresponds to the expression of the endogenous counterpart.\nFor instance, transgenic cows expressing the genes of human lactoferrin and human\n\u03b1-lactalbumin have been produced (Table 1).\nIn general, this method allows one to achieve stable transgene expression at a level similar to\nthat of native genes. Thus, the levels of production of lactoferrin and alpha-lactalbumin in\ntransgenic cows were 3.4 and 1.55 mg/ml, respectively\n(Table 1). The problem is\nassociated with the other genes, which are a part of the bacmid structure and whose\nexpression can adversely affect the health of the TAs. It should also be mentioned\nthat the use of a bacmid does not completely suppress the effect of the genomic\nsurrounding: the expression is partially dependent on the genome integration site\n[54, 55].\nIn this case, there is no direct observable relationship between the number of bacmid\ncopies and the expression level. This can be attributed to the fact that the initiated\nRN A interference adversely affects the gene expression in a bacmid.\n",

Albumin is the major blood\nprotein, which is usually isolated from plasma. The production of recombinant\nalbumin is more expensive than its isolation from blood plasma, since a very\nhigh degree of purification is required for its medical application. Nowadays,\nrecombinant albumin is produced mostly in yeasts Saccharomyces\ncerevisiae (RecombuminTM) and Pichia pastoris\n(AlbrecTM). The huge demand for recombinant albumin has\ndetermined the choice of transgenic cows for its production. Thus, GTC\nBiotherapeutics (USA) has recently created transgenic cows whose average level\nof recombinant human albumin (rhAB) production in milk is 1\u20135 mg/ml\n[15] or up to 30 kg per producing cow per year.\nThe same work described a line of transgenic cows whose RHA concentration in\nmilk was as high as 48 mg/ml, which corresponds to the integration of 250\ncopies of the construct. Transgenic cows of this line are characterized by a\nshorter period of lactation and a decrease in the milk yield. Thus, it can be\nassumed that the production of rhAB in the milk of transgenic cows must be\nbelow 48 mg/ml.\n",

            "text": "\nDespite the relatively low cost of mAb production in transgenic goats, there\nare some drawbacks associated with their use in comparison with the use of\nmammalian cell cultures. Firstly, the antibodies must be properly glycosylated\nand sialylated, which is important for their stability, immunogenicity, and\nbiological activity. Sialylation and glycosylation occur in the mammary glands\nof transgenic goats, but it may be incomplete. In addition, an increase in the\nlevel of mAb expression is associated with a decrease in glycosylation\nefficiency. Therefore, 2\u20134 mg/ml is considered to be an optimal level of mAbs\nin milk. The second problem is associated with the fact that sialic acid is\npresent in transgenic goats in the form of N-acetylneuraminic acid (NANA)\n[98], while human antibodies contain\nNglycolylneuraminic acid (NGNA). There is a possibility that antibodies\ncontaining the \u201cwrong\u201d sialic acid could be immunogenic to patients in some\ncases. Recombinant proteins in mammalian cell cultures also undergo\nheterogeneous glycosylation and sialylation. These processes are usually not\ncompletely identical to their native counterparts. In order to overcome this\nhurdle, additional genes encoding transporters and enzymes, which increase the\nlevel of glycosylation and sialylation, and/ or genes whose RN A-product\ninduces inactivation of the genes encoding the proteins that adversely affect\nglycosylation, are introduced into the cell lines producing the recombinant proteins\n[99, 100].\nAn opportunity to inactivate the genes involved in the\nglycosylation of RPs in the cell lines, which is different from glycosylation\nin human cells, recently became available due to the development of the new\ntechnologies of site-directed mutagenesis. Similar approaches cannot be used\nfor producing animals, since the changes in the genome can adversely affect the\nviability of the TAs. The only potential option is to create TAs using a vector\nunder strict control of expression exclusively in the mammary gland. This\nvector must express additional genes which increase/modify glycosylation and\ngenes that encode groups of RN A capable of inactivating the genes whose\nprotein products are responsible for the abnormal glycosylation of RPs.\nFinally, the presence of approximately 0.3\u20130.5 mg/ml of endogenous\nimmunoglobulins in goat milk poses an additional problem during mAb\npurification. Therefore, an efficient chromatographic separation of goat and\nhuman immunoglobulins is required in order to obtain highly purified mAbs\n[86]. Meanwhile, the introduction of\nsynthetic media for the cultivation of cell cultures significantly simplifies\nthe stage of recombinant protein purification, which somewhat reduces the cost\nof obtaining highly purified mAbs.\n",

The main restriction to the widespread distribution of TAs is the\nfear of the wider public regarding the safety of transgenic food products. More\nstringent regulatory requirements are imposed as a result, making it difficult\nto obtain permission to use TAs. In 2009 (the current edition from May 17,\n2011), after more than 10 years of development, the FDA approved a procedure\nfor considering applications for using TAs [114].\nThe procedure for the approval of new products is simpler in developing countries,\nand both the government and the public view TAs as one of the ways to resolve the problem\nof food security and improvement of living standards. As a result, most of the projects on\nthe applications of TAs in agriculture are currently being implemented in countries, such as\nBrazil, Argentina, and China.\n",
