As shown in Fig. 1, the abundant miRNAs in PRRSV-infected cells were further confirmed by qRT-PCR. ssc-miR-30d_R-1 expression was the most consistently and markedly decreased in both PAM cells (Fig. 1A) and MARC-145 cells (Fig. 1B) compared to matched mock controls and UV-PRRSV.

Among the miRNAs tested, the ssc-miR-30d_R-1 mimic significantly reduced progeny PRRSV production as determined by viral titer (PFU, \u00d7106 mL) (Fig. 2A). Conversely, transfection of the ssc-miR-30d_R-1 inhibitor counteracted these effects (Fig. 2B), indicating that ssc-miR-30d_R-1 has antiviral activity against PRRSV replication. All the other microRNA mimics/inhibitors tested in this study had undetectable effects on progeny virus yield in MARC-145 and PAM cells (Fig. 2A,B).

The 3\u2032-UTR of the TLR4 mRNA contains the ssc-miR-30d_R-1-binding site (Fig. 4A). We used the reporter gene system to verify the database predictions. The results indicated that the ssc-miR-30d_R-1 mimic (synthetic miRNAs that mimic the function of endogenous ssc-miR-30d_R-1) significantly inhibited the luciferase activity of the TLR4 3\u2032-UTR reporter but did not affect the luciferase activity of other possible target gene reporters with mutated ssc-miR-30d_R-1-binding sites (Fig. 4B). Although ssc-miR-30d_R-1 was able to significantly suppress luciferase activity after the addition of 50 or 100 ng of ssc-miR-30d_R-1 inhibitor, adding 150 or 200 ng of ssc-miR-30d_R-1 inhibitor did not reverse this suppression trend (Fig. 4C), indicating that the endogenous TLR4 was targeted and regulated by ssc-miR-30d_R-1.",

Four-week-old female SPF piglets were intravenously administered the synthetic ssc-miR-30d_R-1 mimic (0.1 nmol per day) one day before being inoculated with 105 TCID50 PRRSV LS-4 strain. The piglets in the control mimic-infected group showed severe clinical symptoms. At 24 h post infection, all the piglets started to develop elevated body temperatures (>40 \u00b0C) with a peak of 41.9 \u00b0C at 72 h post infection, but a peak of 40.5 \u00b0C at 72 h post infection was observed in piglets from the miRNA mimic-infected group (Fig. 6A). The body weight gain in piglets from the control mimic-infected group was reduced compared with the mock- and miRNA mimic-infected groups (Fig. 6B). The lung wet:dry weight ratio of the control mimic-infected piglets was higher than that of the miRNA-infected pigs, with a significant difference at 168 h post infection (p < 0.01) (Fig. 6C). The histopathological changes in lungs of the infected piglets were observed at 72, 120 and 168 h following inoculation. As shown in Fig. 6, infiltration by predominantly inflammatory cells and interstitial pneumonia with severe hyperemia were observed in the lungs of the control mimic-infected pigs at 72, 120 and 168 h post infection (Fig. 6D1\u2013D3). However, in the miRNA mimic-infected group, no obvious hyperemia in the lungs was observed at 72 h post infection (Fig. 6E1), and light hyperemia at 120 and 168 h post infection was observed (Fig. 6E2,E3). No obvious histopathological changes were observed in non-infected group (Fig. 6F1\u2013F3). In addition, PRRSV was detected in the sera of control mimic-infected pigs from 3 to 14 days post infection but was observed in miRNA mimic-infected pigs from 5 to 10 days post infection by RT-PCR (data not shown). The viral titers in the lungs of control mimic- and miRNA-infected pigs were calculated to be 10\u22122.25 TCID50/ml and 10\u22120.625 TCID50/ml at 168 h post infection, respectively (data not shown).

Although NF-\u03baB has long been considered a key transcription factor for the expression of a variety of antiviral cytokines25, some pathogens redirect the activity of NF-\u03baB into a virus-supportive function2627. For example, influenza viruses replicated to higher titers in cells with pre-activated NF-\u03baB, and conversely, progeny virus production was reduced when NF-\u03baB signaling was impaired2829. Williams et al. reported that sustained induction of NF-\u03baB is required for efficient expression of latent HIV type 130.

Previous studies also showed that PRRSV infection triggered NF-\u03baB activation31, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein of PRRSV could activate NF-\u03baB when ectopically expressed in MARC-145 cells32. However, the activated NF-\u03baB could only be detected after 24 h post infection.

We compared the basal expression levels of ssc-miR-30d_R-1, ssc-miR-27b, ssc-miR-145_R-1, ssc-miR-23a_R + 1, and ssc-miR-199a-5p in PAMs by qPCR and found that ssc-miR-30d_R-1 was among the most highly expressed miRNAs examined (data not shown). Interestingly, we found that PRRSV infection downregulated the expression of ssc-miR-30d_R-1 as the infection progressed. Significant downregulation was first observed at 12 h, and further reductions in ssc-miR-30d_R-1 levels were observed at later time points. It is plausible to speculate that PRRSV infection gradually decreases ssc-miR-30d_R-1 mRNA expression, which in turn, relieves the stabilizing effect on TLR4 mRNA, ultimately leading to subsequent NF-\u03baB activation. In our study, ssc-miR-30d_R-1 can significantly inhibit the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-8, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2) in a time-dependent manner in MARC-145 cells. Furthermore, we explored the effects of ssc-miR-30d_R-1 on PRRSV infection in SPF piglets by evaluating body temperature, body weight, viral titer, and pathological changes, among others. Although there was no significant difference in lung pathological changes between the miRNA mimic-infected group and control mimic-infected group after 168 h post infection, these results showed that treatment with ssc-miR-30d_R-1 mimics can significantly reduce the damage to infected piglets at an early stage. In addition, a previous study showed that the Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling cascade may be involved in PRRSV-induced NF-\u03baB activation35.",

After one hour of incubation, the cells were washed with warm PBS and incubated in DMEM medium supplemented with 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin, 2 \u03bcg/mL TPCK-treated trypsin and 0.2% bovine serum albumin (fraction V). Supernatants were collected after 24 h and stored at \u221270 \u00b0C for the TCID50 assay. To determine whether the virus replicated in a dose-dependent manner in cells, MARC-145 and PAM cells were transfected with ssc-miR-30d_R-1 mimic or a control mimic at the indicated dose (50, 100, 150 and 200 ng), followed by PRRSV infection (MOI = 0.1).",

On day 2, these piglets were inoculated intranasally with a highly pathogenic PRRSV strain (LS-4 strain) at a 2 mL 105 TCID50 dose for each piglet in the mimic-treated group. Eighteen pigs (n = 3 in each time point) were slaughtered at 72, 120 or 168 h post infection. Two portions from each lobe of the left lung were collected immediately and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution. The whole left lung was weighed before and after desiccation at 80 \u00b0C, drying to a constant weight, and then the lung wet:dry weight ratio was determined, which was used as one indicator of lung edema46. Lung histopathological changes at 72, 120 and 168 h post infection were analyzed based on previously described reports47. According to the method of Reed-Muench, virus titration in the lungs was determined, with some modification. Briefly, lung tissues were sampled, frozen in liquid nitrogen and then ground into fine powder using a mortar and pestle, weighted for one milligram and homogenized in 1 mL cold phosphate-buffered saline. Clarified homogenates were titrated for viral infectivity in MARC-145 cells cultured in 96-well plates from initial dilutions of 1:10. Viral titers were expressed as the mean TCID50/mL. The remaining piglets (n = 3) were monitored for 14 days for virus detection in serum.",
