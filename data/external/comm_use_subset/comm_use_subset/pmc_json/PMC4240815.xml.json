Besides regulating innate and adaptive immune responses, TLR signaling plays an important role in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory diseases, and tight regulation is crucial in order to prevent hyperinflammation [1,2]. Immune signaling is regulated at multiple levels, and the release of extracellular domains of immune receptors such as cytokine receptors represents an important regulatory mechanisms [3]. Similar negative regulation accounts for modulation of TLR function [1,2], and soluble forms of TLR2 and TLR4 have been recently described [4,5]. The release of these soluble proteins increases upon cell activation and they exert inhibitory activity on TLR signaling [4,5]. Soluble forms of TLRs have been detected in pleural fluid, amniotic fluid, saliva, breast milk and plasma [4,6-10].",

Furthermore, we hypothesized that sTLR2 and sTLR4, being soluble forms of receptors that play pivotal roles in pathogen recognition by cells of the innate immune system, are differentially released during various inflammatory diseases, with higher levels in inflammatory conditions of infectious origin. As such, we evaluated the ability of sTLR2 and sTLR4 levels to discriminate between infectious and non-infectious inflammatory pathologies.",

Isotype and fluorochrome matched controls from Beckman Coulter were used. Cell buffer solution was used containing 0.5% Bovine Serum Albumin in Phosphate Buffered Saline and 0.1% sodium azide. Rabbit serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for blocking was diluted to 20% with cell buffer solution. Red blood cell lysis was performed using 0.075 M ammonium chloride (NH4Cl, pH7.4), freshly prepared. 1 ml of blood was mixed with 20 ml of NH4Cl lysing solution and was left at room temperature for 10 minutes. After centrifuging for 5 minutes at 500 g the supernatant was discarded. The cell pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of PBS and centrifuged again. After this washing step the cell pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml cell buffer solution. 0.1 ml of this cell suspension was mixed with 0.1 ml 20% rabbit serum and left at room temperature for 10 min. Subsequently, cells were incubated with the appropriate antibody concentration mixture for 15 min in the dark at room temperature. After washing, samples were resuspended in 0.5 ml cell buffer solution and analyzed on a Beckman Coulter FC500 flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL). Monocytes were gated in a Side Scatter vs. CD14 plot. Fluorochrome matched isotype controls, non-stained samples, as well as cells incubated with only a secondary antibody, were used to set the photo multiplier detectors. The TLR2 and TLR4 expression was analyzed within CD14+ monocytes.",

Significantly elevated plasma concentrations of sTLRs are present in the circulation during experimental human endotoxemia, and high circulating concentrations of sTLR4 are found in patients with infections compared to patients with non-infectious inflammation, as well as in patients with bacterial infections compared with viral infections. However, the value of sTLR2 and sTLR4 as additional diagnostic biomarkers is low as both new markers do not surpass CRP in accuracy.",

            "text": "In addition to the release of sTLR2 and sTLR4 from stimulated immune cells [4,5], constitutive release of sTLRs has been demonstrated in various biological fluids such as saliva, breast milk, and amniotic fluid [10,23]. In plasma, sTLR2 represented by several polypeptides, has been found by others [4], although the concentrations are low. To avoid both harmful or insufficient inflammatory responses, inhibition and activation of the immune system needs to be properly balanced. Various negative regulators of TLRs have been described [1] of which sTLR2 and sTLR4 constitute an important first-line negative regulatory mechanism [4-6,23-25]. sTLR2 either interferes with CD14-mediated triggering of membrane-bound TLR2, dimerizes with TLR2 on the cell surface, or competes with cellular TLR2 for microbial ligands [4]. The complex formed by sTLR4 and MD-2 probably blocks the interaction between membrane-bound TLR4 and its ligand [25]. The rapid elevation of sTLR2 and sTLR4 in plasma upon LPS administrations, similar to that of pro-inflammatory cytokines, indicates that this feedback mechanism is rapidly activated. Consistent with our in-vitro data, the release of sTLRs in to the circulation demonstrates that immune modulation mediated by TLRs is not limited to the stimulation of the corresponding receptor on the cell membrane of immune cells. Since both sTLR2 and sTLR4 dampen inflammation by disrupting TLR-mediated pro-inflammatory responses [4-6,23-25], it might be possible that the counter regulatory mechanisms mediated by sTLRs extend to interference with endogenous TLR ligands. Although the kinetics of sTLR2 and sTLR4 concentrations parallel those of anti-inflammatory cytokines, quantitatively they appear to be differentially regulated. Plasma sTLR4 levels did not show any correlation with both IL-10 and IL-1Ra and for sTLR2, a negative correlation with IL-10 was found. Interestingly, while in-vitro release of sTLR2 and sTLR4 by immune cells is comparable, their in-vivo concentrations differ strongly, with much higher concentration in the circulation of sTLR2: this suggests a much more rapid clearance of sTLR4 from circulation. This may imply that these anti-inflammatory mechanisms are regulated at a different level and are potential complementary strategies to reduce inflammation.",

On the contrary, sTLR2 results from posttranslational processing: endocytosis of cell surface receptor is followed by conversion into sTLR2 intracellularly [4]. In previous monocyte stimulation experiments, membrane-bound TLR2 correlated negatively with supernatant sTLR2 [4]. We did not observe the downregulation of cell surface TLR expression on monocytes of individuals during endotoxemia. Possible explanations for this lack of correlation are that (1) monocytes are detected only in very low numbers at 2 hours after LPS injection [27] and this subpopulation may well have a different TLR expression than more active monocytes that have marginated at this time-point; (2) we only examined the expression of TLRs on monocytes (CD14+), however, other circulating cell subsets such as neutrophils or platelets also express TLR2 [28,29], all potentially contributing to the plasma concentrations of sTLRs; (3) the soluble receptors are derived from an intracellular pool, not directly from the cell surface [4]; and finally (4) besides being shed, membrane bound TLR is influenced by TLR trafficking between intracellular compartments and the cell membrane [30].",

Rapid and reliable differentiation of non-infectious inflammatory disorders from infections, and the classification of infections according to their microbiological etiology is essential for optimal treatment of these conditions. So far, only a small number of studies have been published on sTLRs as diagnostic biomarkers. A few studies from the same group reported that intrauterine infections in pregnant women are characterized by elevated levels of sTLR1, sTLR2, sTLR6 and sTLR4 in the amniotic fluid [9,10,13], supporting the concept of sTLR release during infections. We assessed the value of sTLR2 and sTLR4 levels to discriminate between several inflammatory conditions. sTLR2 and sTLR4 were elevated in response to inflammatory insults and particularly sTLR4 showed a good specificity to discriminate between an infection and a non-infectious inflammatory conditions such as gout, Crohn\u2019s disease, rheumatoid arthritis or autoinflammatory syndromes. Moreover, sTLR4 concentrations show a high specificity for discriminating between bacterial and viral infections using high cut-off values, but sensitivity was low. We have to mention however that the overall discriminative value of sTLR levels was not superior to that of CRP in the relatively small group of patients assessed in this study Future larger validation studies should demonstrate the overall value of sTLR2 and sTLR4 levels for the diagnosis of infections and autoinflammatory diseases in relation to that of classic inflammatory markers. Furthermore, besides sTLRs, other soluble pattern recognition receptors such as the soluble mannose receptor that are shed during cell stimulation with \u03b2-glucans are also interesting candidates for new and potentially more specific diagnostic biomarkers [31].",
