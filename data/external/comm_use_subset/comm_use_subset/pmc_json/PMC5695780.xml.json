            "text": "As one of the most frequent infectious diseases, pneumonia causes a tremendous socioeconomic burden in industrialized countries [1] and is the leading infectious cause of death in children worldwide [2]. Numerous classes of pathogens can cause acute pneumonia [3] and the risk of pneumonia is greatly enhanced under conditions of impaired pulmonary host defense, including preceding viral infections [4], mechanical ventilation [5] and sepsis [6]. The leading causative pathogen of community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the Gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus (S.) pneumoniae [7, 8] which accounts for the majority of bacterial upper and lower respiratory tract infections and is responsible for millions of deaths annually [9, 10]. As another cause of CAP influenza A virus (IAV) infection leads to rapid progression of lung failure with limited treatment options and frequent fatal outcome [3, 11, 12]. Moreover, IAV infections are commonly complicated by bacterial superinfection, mostly caused by S. pneumoniae, resulting in severe progressive pneumonia associated with increased mortality [13]. In contrast, the Gram-negative and facultatively intracellular bacterium Legionella (L.) pneumophila is the causative agent of the severe CAP Legionnaires\u2019 disease, and the second most commonly detected pathogen in pneumonia in patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU) in industrialized countries [14, 15]. However, in addition to CAP, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is also a major cause of hospital morbidity and mortality in ICUs [16] and the spectrum of pathogens is shifted in these forms of pneumonia. Here Staphylococcus (S.) aureus, Klebsiella (K.) pneumoniae, Acinetobacter (A.) baumannii, and Escherichia (E.) coli have been isolated with varying prevalences [17\u201319]. More specifically, the Gram-negative K. pneumoniae is a significant opportunistic pathogen causing severe life-threatening hospital-acquired respiratory tract infections [20\u201322] while S. aureus, a Gram-positive bacterium, is one of the most prevalent pathogens of community- and hospital-acquired lower respiratory tract infections in humans and accounts for a significant health and economic burden [23\u201325]. A. baumannii and E. coli are ubiquitous Gram-negative bacteria which have recently emerged as major causes of community-associated, nosocomial [26, 27] and ventilator-associated pneumonia [19, 28] as well as septicemia induced acute lung injury (ALI) [29, 30].",

For a more comparative inclusion of histopathologic information in biomedical research, scoring systems have been widely applied which allow for a first semiquantitative assessment of lesions compared to controls [44, 45]. Moreover, all preclinical models used for the development of novel treatment strategies and acceptance by regulatory agencies need to be assessed histopathologically by board certified pathologists as gold standard for qualitative and semiquantitative evaluation of tissue alterations in experimental animals [46\u201348].",

However, scoring schemes for acute murine pneumonia existing to date are very superficial, addressing only a few, rather unspecific parameters [45, 49, 50]. More importantly, they hardly allow for a differentiating perspective between distinct pathogens or for group comparisons, e.g., infections of wild type versus genetically modified mice. Clearly, there is a strong need for more precise and pathogen- as well as model-specific parameters to allow for an accurate description and semiquantification of the inflammatory phenotype for reliable and reproducible comparisons between experimental groups within each model. Therefore, we have recently adapted more specific scoring criteria for S. pneumoniae and S. aureus-induced pneumonia [38, 42]. However, such pathogen-specific scoring criteria have not been employed for other lung pathogens in mice.",

Specific for this model, lesions widely expanded down to the periphery of the lung lobes (Fig 1A) with inflammation closely surrounding the airways and blood vessels. Pneumococcal spread led to an early immune response which was mainly characterized by predominantly intrabronchial (Fig 1B) and intraalveolar (Fig 1C) infiltrations of neutrophils provoking a lobular, suppurative bronchopneumonia with consolidation of affected lung areas. Large areas of coagulation and liquefaction necrosis (Fig 1D, arrowhead) as indicated by cellular fragmentation, decay, and loss of cellular details, accumulation of cellular and karyorrhectic debris as well as karyorrhexis, karyopyknosis, and karyolysis with consecutive hemorrhage were also present. The perivascular interstitium was widely expanded by edema due to vascular leakage [53] with massive extravasation of neutrophils recruited into perivascular spaces (Fig 1E). Furthermore, suppurative and necrotizing vasculitis accompanied by hyaline thrombi within small-sized blood vessels were occasionally present, indicating early histological evidence of incipient septicemia. Increased pulmonary vascular permeability [53] also led to expanded areas of protein-rich alveolar edema which presented as homogenous, lightly pink material within the alveolar spaces in the HE stain (Fig 1F, asterisk). A distinctive histopathological feature of pneumococcal pneumonia was the occurrence of massive suppurative to necrotizing pleuritis (Fig 1G, arrowhead) and steatitis (Fig 1H) with widespread dispersion of bacteria into the thoracic cavity, likely accounting for the painful and morbid clinical behavior with rapid progression in affected mice. Myriads of pneumococci were clearly visible as bluish to purple dots of approximately 1 \u03bcm in size in the standard HE stain, mostly located on the pleural surface, in the mediastinal adipose tissue or within perivascular spaces in the lungs.",

The character of pneumonia included massive infiltration of neutrophils into alveoli (Fig 9B) and bronchi, typical features of severe, suppurative bronchopneumonia. Bronchial epithelium was almost entirely necrotic and bronchi were filled up with pus (Fig 9C). Perivascular spaces were edematous and infiltrated by neutrophils and lymphocytes (Fig 9D) whereas only mild lymphocytic perivascular cuffing (Fig 9E) was present. A severe protein-rich alveolar edema was seen, similar to that seen in the S. pneumoniae mono-infection (Fig 9F). Pneumococci were difficult to visualize by HE stain, possibly due to the lower infectious dose used here when compared to the mono-infection.",

To obtain representative data from such samples that can be correlated with the histological changes, it is crucial to know about the homogeneity of the distribution of lesions. Also, some experimental protocols recommend to use the left and right halves of the lungs, respectively, for different analytical procedures, again anticipating lesion homogeneity and symmetry. However, when we analyzed the distributions and bilateral symmetry of lung lesions for each of the infection models, we found a wide spectrum of distinct distributions and asymmetries (Fig 10). In principle, lesion distributions followed the route of pathogen entry into the lungs. However, the tendencies to spread towards the periphery of the lobes after aerogenous infection varied between different pathogens despite similar aerogenous infection routes. Mostly centrally focused lesions induced by S. aureus and L. pneumophila remained close to the hilus with no trend towards peripheral expansion. Infection with S. pneumoniae, A. baumannii and MERS-CoV resulted in lesions closely surrounding major airway segments with centrifugal expansion towards the periphery. In contrast, lesions induced by K. pneumoniae were mostly located in the periphery of the lobes and airways and much weaker adjacent to the hilus despite aerogenous infection. Hematogenously-induced sepsis with E. coli was associated with an entirely diffuse distribution of lesions affecting the whole lung with myriads of inflammatory hot spots, commonly surrounding blood vessels. IAV-induced lesions were restricted to individual lung lobes only with a rather homogeneous distribution within affected lobes. Superinfection of S. pneumoniae into an IAV-pneumonia resulted in a pattern virtually identical to that seen after IAV infection alone. Except for blood borne E. coli pneumonia which was consistently and evenly distributed throughout the entire lungs, affected areas in all other models tested here were randomly distributed more or less asymmetrically between the right and left halves of the lungs and also between adjacent lobes (Fig 10).",

The models employed here all represent well established protocols that have been optimized and successfully used in previous studies, with model-specific variations in infection doses, routes of pathogen administration and analyzed time points [37\u201342, 51, 52, 54\u201356]. Our model-specific description parameters (Table 2) provide a rational for the selection of histopathological quantification criteria, in order to best reflect the model-specific lesion and distribution characteristics, which appear to be most relevant.

            "text": "The model-associated characteristics of tissue lesions and immune cell infiltrates are widely consistent with well-established properties of the different pathogens used. For example, the destructive tissue damage with mostly neutrophilic infiltrations as seen in S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and A. baumannii, are typically seen with extracellular bacteria that express cytotoxic virulence factors, such as pneumolysin and hydrogen peroxide [61] from S. pneumoniae or immunogenic cell wall components such as lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from S. aureus [62, 63]. On the other hand, the intracellular pathogen L. pneumophila which primarily infects macrophages [64] resulted in a histiocytic infiltrate at 48 h that developed into granulomatous inflammation at 6 days after infection, typical of a TH1-response [65, 66]. However, several of the pathogens used were associated with additional distinctive features. For example, histology revealed marked pleuritis and steatitis due to pathogen invasion into adjacent extrapulmonary tissues after infections with S. pneumoniae and K. pneumoniae. This massive bacterial spreading throughout the thoracic cavity was exclusively present in these two models and most likely associated with sepsis, responsible for the rapid clinical progression and unfavourable outcome [41, 67]. However, only K. pneumoniae had the tendency of abscess formation which was not seen in pneumococcal pneumonia. Infection with S. aureus and A. baumannii also resulted in similar lesion patterns, except for Acinetobacter-induced lesions widely expanding to the lung periphery while Staphyloccocus-induced pneumonia was restricted to the lung hilus. A second difference between the two was the presence of prominent vascular thrombosis in A. baumannii-induced pneumonia which was absent from Staphylococcus pneumonia. The clinical outcome of mice infected with A. baumannii and S. aureus was more favourable when compared to infection with S. pneumoniae or K. pneumoniae [38] which may be explained by the lack of bacterial spreading throughout the thoracic cavity and adjacent tissues, and possibly sepsis. E. coli infection was included here as a model for sepsis-associated ALI [29, 30, 68] and consequently induced wide spread vascular thrombosis and vasculitis, most likely due to its blood borne entry into the lungs and concurrent septicemia with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and associated vascular lesions. Vascular thrombosis with or without vasculitis was also observed in other models, including S. pneumoniae, A. baumannii and MERS-CoV, however, to a much lesser extent and only within the most strongly affected areas. MERS-CoV and IAV-associated lesions clearly reflected the known cellular tropisms of these viruses with necrosis of alveolar walls or bronchial epithelial cells, respectively, being the most characteristic histopathologic features [69\u201372]. Typical of virally induced lesions, the inflammatory cell infiltrates in MERS-CoV and IAV infections were dominated by lymphocytes with no or only few neutrophils. Nevertheless, the two viral models could be clearly distinguished from each other by additional histological characteristics. Only the MERS-CoV infection led to a marked vascular phenotype with necrosis and degeneration of blood vessels, vasculitis, and consecutive vascular thrombosis as well as pronounced hemorrhages [69, 73]. In contrast, IAV-induced pneumonia did not display any of these features, but was dominated by marked perivascular lymphocytic cuffing and alveolar edema [42, 74]. Subsequent superinfection with low-dose S. pneumoniae potentiated the severity of the IAV-induced lesions and aggravated the course of pneumonia. However, it did not alter the principal histological characteristics of IAV-pneumonia. The patterns seen after single infection with S. pneumonia were not repeated in this superinfection model, likely owing to the much lower inoculation dose which is usually rapidly cleared from virus-naive lungs.",

            "text": "When the distributions of lesions were compared among the 9 models tested, four distinct patterns could be clearly distinguished. The most common pattern, where lesions were focused around central airways and blood vessels close to the lung hilus with the periphery less or not affected can likely be explained by the aerogenous route of infection and pathogen entry. The opposite pattern characteristic of K. pneumoniae infection where the periphery of the lobes was more strongly affected than their hilus areas despite a similar aerogenous route of infection may be due to the aerosolic intratracheal application [75] of these bacteria which is typical of and necessary in this model [41, 57\u201359]. These differences are therefore more likely attributable to the model-specific route of infection rather than pathogen-specific properties. Similarly, the very homogenous distribution of E. coli induced pneumonia likely followed the diffuse blood borne entry of the pathogen into the lungs after intraperitoneal infection. Again unique among the pathogens tested here, the IAV-associated pattern affected entire but only select lung lobes with almost complete sparing of others. This distribution probably followed a random spread of the virus along major airways but why some lobes remained virtually unaffected after transnasal infection remains hard to explain. Apart from helping to understand differences in pathogen spread, the uneven and often quite asymmetrical distributions have a tremendous impact in practical terms when acute mouse pneumonia is sampled for molecular studies. When quantitative data on mRNA or protein expression levels or other biochemical information are to be compared with one another or with tissue lesions, it is imperative that only identically affected areas are compared. Since this is impossible to predict or recognize on the macroscopical level for most models, the practice of sampling different regions of such lungs for different readout systems appears highly problematic.",

            "text": "Another implication of the distinct lesion characteristics, immune cell reactions and distributions among the different models appears highly relevant for histological scoring systems that aim at first quantitative comparisons [45]. To narrow down the list of parameters appropriate for each pathogen and exclude features that are likely irrelevant for some of the models, we selected 23 single histopathologic criteria for the design of semiquantitative scoring systems suitable for each model. These criteria are partly composed of standard parameters such as the determination of the affected lung area, the distribution of lesions or the type of pneumonia induced. However, numerous other and more model-specific parameters were identified which precisely describe particular aspects and allow for a differentiation between the models, such as the presence of perivascular edema, vascular thrombosis, pleuritis or steatitis. Appropriate scoring systems may thus encompass more general parameters when different pathogens are compared to one another or more pathogen-specific parameters in case specific pathogen features are in the focus of an experiment. For example, some of the parameters selected here have proven helpful in the discovery and semiquantification of different phenotypes of mouse pneumonia following genetic engineering of pathogens or mice [38, 51, 76]. However, scoring systems that claim universality for all mouse models of acute pneumonia seem neither generally applicable nor meaningful for all specific experimental goals. Even the list of 23 parameters selected here may become inappropriate or insufficient when genetic changes on the pathogen or host side may result in different types of lesions, immune cell responses, time courses or other relevant features. In those cases, the list selected here may have to be adjusted or extended to better meet the specific challenges of each new study.",

While S. pneumoniae, K. pneumoniae and E. coli were easily visible in HE stained tissue sections in areas with low density of inflammatory cells, e.g., in perivascular spaces, they were very difficult to identify in heavily infiltrated and consolidated lung parenchyma. In contrast, S. aureus, A. baumannii, L. pneumophila and both viruses were entirely invisible by HE staining and thus had to be visualized by appropriate histotechnical stains or immunohistochemistry.

Variations of such factors can be expected to result in different lesion severities, composition of the cellular infiltrates, and for some models in different expansions of lesions within the lung. Still, the conditions used here are all based on observations that have evolved during extensive previous establishment studies of these models [37\u201339, 41, 42, 51, 52, 54, 56\u201358, 60, 77\u201379]. Among the most important reasons, most human pathogens are not pathogenic for mice under non-experimental conditions and the decisive factor for obtaining a useful pneumonia model appears to be the determination of the appropriate infection dose and route of infection. In addition, the exact time points of tissue analysis after infection had to be determined for virtually all models with care to obtain a useful model, including a precise definition of the strain or variant of the pathogen used [51, 53, 80, 81]. Another variable to consider is the mouse strain used. Except for BALB/c mice which were used in the MERS-CoV infection model here for model-specific reasons [60], all models were conducted with C57BL/6 mice which is among the most commonly used mouse strain in infection research and therefore allows for comparisons with similar studies. However, variations of the strain or genetic background may have a dramatic impact on the type, severity and outcome of inflammation, particularly in innate immune responses [82\u201384]. Again, the criteria suggested here for scoring procedures should allow to recognize and quantify such differences related to changes in infection dose and volume, time point of examination, strain and age of mice used, pathogen variant and other variables.",

Infection with S. pneumoniae, A. baumannii and MERS-CoV resulted in lesions closely surrounding the airways and blood vessels close to the central major airway segments with centrifugal expansion towards the periphery. In contrast, lesions induced by K. pneumoniae were mostly located in the periphery of the lobes and airways and much weaker adjacent to the hilus. Hematogenous infection with E. coli was associated with entirely diffuse distribution of lesions affecting the whole lungs with myriads of inflammatory hot spots, commonly surrounding blood vessels. IAV-induced lesions were restricted to individual lung lobes with a rather homogeneous distribution within affected lobes. Which lobes were affected followed a rather random and inconsistent pattern. Superinfection of S. pneumoniae into an IAV-pneumonia resulted in a pattern virtually identical to that seen after IAV infection alone. Except for E. coli induced pneumonia, virtually all lung lesions were distributed asymmetrically between the left and right lung halves with no tendency of either half to be more often or more strongly affected.",
