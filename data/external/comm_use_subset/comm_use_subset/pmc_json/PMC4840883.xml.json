The variations in amino acid sequence likely changed the immunogenicity of the S protein and led to immunization failure of current commercial vaccines. In this study, we successfully isolated the YC2014 PEDV strain from porcine intestinal samples in dead piglets during outbreaks of acute diarrhea. The S gene nucleotides analysis of YC2014 indicated that it was clustered with the PEDV epidemic strains, with 15 nucleotide insertion in three sites and three nucleotide deletion in one site compared to classical PEDV vaccine strains CV777 and DR13. The variations of the S gene sequence and deduced amino acid sequence of the YC2014 strain compared to traditional PEDV vaccine strains may be the reason why some swine farms had well PEDV vaccine immunizations but still had sustained epidemic diarrhea which caused huge economic losses.",

In this study, the nucleocapsid protein specific antibody levels of three different inactivated PEDV strains immunized groups gradually increased at all the testing time points. However, the antibody titers of these three groups are not significantly different. Immunization with inactivated YC2014 could protect piglets from acute diarrhea against homologous strain challenge. Since YC2014 was clustered with the PEDV epidemic strains, with >99 % nucleotide identity to most of these epidemic strains, the inactivated YC2014 may protect other variant strains challenge in some extent. However, it needs further refine animal studies to assess this suppose. The results showed that, great antigenicity variation had occurred to this YC2014 PEDV strain under the selective pressure of vaccines. Therefore, it is important to investigate PEDV variants currently circulating in sow herds to assess their ability to allow for cross-protection against highly virulent PEDV strains and prevent PEDV epidemics.",

Cells were then washed three times with PBST and blocked with 10 % bovine serum albumin (BSA) at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. Preparations were incubated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C with mouse anti-PEDV nucleocapsid protein polyclonal antibody in dilution buffer (1 % BSA in PBST), this mouse anti-PEDV nucleocapsid protein polyclonal antibody, prepared by our laboratory, was collected from serum of ICR mice immunized with purified prokaryotic expressed N protein. After three washes with PBST, cells were treated with a rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Cwbio, China) at a 1:5000 dilution with PBS for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. After a final four washes with PBST, all wells were examined using fluorescence microscopy (Axio Observer Z1, Zeiss, Germany). After ten passages on Vero cells, the one-step growth curve of YC2014 strain in Vero cells was monitored at 8 h interval after infection.",

The 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the genome of YC2014 were validated using the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) cDNA amplification kit (Clontech, Japan). All fragments were sequenced in both directions in triplicate. The complete genomic sequence of YC2014 and the nucleotide sequence of S gene were aligned with sequences of published isolates using MEGA 5.1 software. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the Maximum Likelihood method and supported with a bootstrap test of 1000 replicates. Genomic sequences of the isolated YC2014 PEDV strain were submitted to GenBank under accession no. KU252649.",

Twelve commercial high-health sows (Large White) were randomly divided into four groups (Table 3) and were housed in four separate rooms. These sows were confirmed virologically negative for PEDV, TGEV and porcine deltacoronavirus by RT-PCR and serologically negative for PEDV and TGEV antibody by indirect ELISA. On 28 and 14 days before farrowing, sows in group one were immunized intramuscularly with 2 ml of inactivated CV777 (2.0 \u00d7 107 TCID50) emulsified in equal volume of Gel 01 ST adjuvant (Seppic, France), separately. Group two were immunized intramuscularly with 2 ml of inactivated DR13 (2.0 \u00d7 107 TCID50) emulsified in equal volume of Gel 01 ST adjuvant. Group three were immunized intramuscularly with 2 ml of inactivated YC2014 (2.0 \u00d7 107 TCID50) emulsified in equal volume of Gel 01 ST adjuvant. Group four were treated with 2 ml of saline emulsified in equal volume of Gel 01 ST adjuvant. After immunization, sera samples were collected from sows at 7-day intervals until 35 days after immunization (7 days after farrowing) for detection of nucleocapsid protein specific antibodies with commercial indirect ELISA kits (Biovet, Canada) and PEDV neutralizing antibodies using YC2014 as indicator virus as described previously [20]. Briefly, 50 \u03bcl of PEDV strain YC2014 (2.0 \u00d7 103 TCID50/ml) was added to an equal volume of the sera samples and incubated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. The mixture was then inoculated to a 96-well plate containing confluent Vero cells. 2 h later, the culture plate was washed with D-Hank\u2019s three times, and then added 100 \u03bcl of DMEM containing 2 % fetal bovine serum (FBS). 48 h later, the culture plate was fixed with cold methanol for 10 min at \u221220 \u00b0C, and incubated with mouse anti-PEDV nucleocapsid protein polyclonal antibody for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C, and then stained with FITC-labeled rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The serum titers were determined as the reciprocal of the last serum dilution at 70 % or greater fluorescent focus reduction in the infected cell cultures under a fluorescent microscope. The colostrum and the milk on 7th day after farrowing of each sow were also collected and used for the detection of PEDV neutralizing antibodies.",
