Estimates of influenza-associated severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) incidence have been calculated in some low and lower-middle income countries from population-based surveillance [1],[3],[4],[7],[8],[9],[10]. These estimates are usually limited to the area where the surveillance is performed. However, in many countries there is regional variability in risk factors, epidemiology, and healthcare-seeking practices that can affect hospitalized influenza-associated SARI rates and make it challenging to extrapolate rates from a small area to the whole country. The more country-specific data that are utilized to estimate the total number of influenza cases, the more credible this estimate is likely to be to public health decision makers within the country.",

Our adjustments were made based on the prevalence of these risk factors in each province and their relative risk for childhood pneumonia as defined by Rudan et al. based on their review of the literature (Table 1) [11],[ 20]. Because of the elevated risk for hospitalized SARI in HIV-infected persons, we added an adjustment for HIV prevalence using the same equation [21],[22],[23],[24],[25],[26]. We did not have data on HIV prevalence in children in Kenya, therefore we calculated this prevalence using an algorithm which took into account the prevalence of HIV-infected mothers from antenatal clinics and the expected vertical transmission rate, accounting for penetration of prevention-of-mother-to-child-transmission programs, and transmission through breastfeeding (Appendix S2). For persons \u22655 years old, the risk factors used for adjustment were household air pollution, crowding, and HIV prevalence. Due to a lack of studies found during a literature review of these risk factors for adult pneumonia, we assumed that the relative risk of SARI for each risk factor was the same as for children.",

Since 2007, national Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) have included a standardized question that asks about healthcare-seeking practices for acute respiratory illness (ARI) [11]. The question currently asks caretakers \u2018if their children under age five had been ill in the two weeks preceding the survey with a cough accompanied by short, rapid breathing or difficulty breathing which the mother considered to be chest-related.\u2019 If yes, the caretaker is asked if he or she \u2018sought advice or treatment from a health facility or a provider\u2019, which excludes pharmacies, shops and traditional healers. The percentage of children with ARI in the past two weeks who sought care at a health facility or provider is reported by administrative region in the country (e.g., province). As there was no question in the DHS asking about healthcare-seeking for adults and since the relative rather than absolute healthcare-seeking by province was more important for the adjustment, we used the same proportion for adults who sought care as for children from the DHS. We also assumed that healthcare-seeking for SARI in a province would be proportional to healthcare-seeking for ARI as defined in the DHS, and applied the ratio of these percentages to further adjust the rate of SARI for each province compared to the base rate province.",

In Kenya, for provinces with <25 cases of SARI during a surveillance year, we considered the estimate as unstable due to small numbers or insensitive surveillance, and so used a weighted average of the percentage of hospitalized influenza-associated SARI from provinces with \u226525 cases, weighted by the number of samples taken.

Using data from published healthcare utilization surveys asking about healthcare-seeking practices for pneumonia, we estimated the rate of non-hospitalized SARI [27],[28],[29].

This estimation was based on the assumption that those patients have the same severity of illness, but did not seek care due to lack of access. We felt that compared to the DHS, the healthcare utilization survey healthcare-seeking questions were more relevant for SARI, as the questions focused on pneumonia, rather than the more nonspecific ARI question of the DHS; we expected more healthcare-seeking for more severe episodes like SARI than for all ARI. In addition, the healthcare utilization survey questions were asked for both children and adults. In both countries the healthcare utilization survey defined pneumonia as, \u2018cough or difficulty breathing that lasted more than 2 days or a diagnosis of pneumonia given by a doctor or professional healthcare provider in the last year\u2019. Respondents who reported a pneumonia episode in the past year were asked about healthcare-seeking. For this analysis, we considered the percentage of patients with pneumonia who sought care at a hospital as indicative of the percentage of persons who would have access to a hospital if they were to have an episode of influenza-associated SARI. Because healthcare utilization survey data was only available in one province in Kenya and two departments in Guatemala, we adjusted the healthcare utilization survey-derived percentage of those who sought care at a hospital for pneumonia to each province by applying the same ratio of healthcare-seeking for ARI from the DHS that we used in Step 2b; although in this case the ratio was for each province divided by the province in which the healthcare utilization survey was done (which may or may not have been the same as the province where the base rate of SARI was obtained).",

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in conjunction with the University of the Valley of Guatemala (UVG) and the Guatemalan Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance, conducted population-based surveillance for pneumonia in two departments --in Santa Rosa, a rural lowland department in southeast Guatemala, at the National Hospital of Cuilapa, and in Quetzaltenango, a semi-urban highland department in western Guatemala, at Western National Hospital. During the 2009 influenza pandemic year, immunization for pH1N1 was reasonably high, but coverage for seasonal strains is typically low [32]. At both Guatemalan sites, a case of pneumonia was defined as a hospitalized patient, residing in the hospital's pre-defined catchment area with at least one sign of an acute infection (e.g. fever, abnormal white blood cell count, hypothermia) and at least one sign or symptom of a respiratory tract illness (e.g. cough, rapid breathing, production of phlegm, chest pain, difficulty breathing) [33]. All patients meeting the pneumonia case definition were tested for influenza virus using real-time PCR [34]. Besides Quetzaltenango and Santa Rosa, no other sites had complete influenza sentinel surveillance data available. In Guatemala, there were a few deviations from the methodology described above. In Step 1, the base rate included an adjustment for the proportion of SARI cases hospitalized at non-surveillance hospitals within the catchment area. Also, there was no recent DHS data for Guatemala, but a similar survey (National Survey of Maternal and Child Health [ENSMI]) contained data on healthcare-seeking practices (Step 2b) and risk factor prevalence (Step 2a) [35]. Finally, because prevalence of HIV remains low (<1%), no adjustments were made for HIV in Step 2a.",

In order to make informed policy decisions, countries likely perceive data generated within their own country as more relevant and persuasive [36]. For countries without population-based surveillance, however, base rates of SARI can be used from epidemiologically-similar neighboring countries. Second, our approach emphasizes the use of sentinel laboratory-based surveillance data and reinforces the need to assure high-quality influenza surveillance [13]. Third, the estimate incorporates both hospitalized and non-hospitalized cases. Estimates of hospitalized cases alone can be utilized for planning care and treatment costs. However, in most low and lower-middle income countries, healthcare-seeking practices at hospitals can be low, particularly in rural areas where many persons die at home [12],[27],[29]. The full burden of severe influenza disease in low and lower-middle income countries, and the potential impact of interventions like vaccination, requires quantification of non-hospitalized cases as well.",

Of note, our estimates included the period when pandemic H1N1 appeared in both countries, which might have led to changes in healthcare-seeking practices and influenza incidence that were not representative of normal years [33],[37]. Kenya was unique in having two different sites performing laboratory-based, population-based surveillance for hospitalized influenza in children, which allowed us to further check the accuracy of our methodology [1],[38]. When we used surveillance in Kilifi in Coast Province for the base rate in our method, we estimated a rate of hospitalized influenza-associated SARI of 2.3 per 1,000 (95% CI: 1.6\u20133.4) in Nyanza Province (Table S5), which is similar, with overlapping confidence intervals, to that found from a published report in Nyanza Province (1.4 per 1,000, 95% CI 1.2\u20131.7); the differences could be due to slightly different case definitions, catchment designs, and years of inclusion [1].",

Such models have been used in the U.S., Canada, Hong Kong and South Africa [8],[39],[40],[41],[42],[43]. However, reliable longitudinal administrative data is not available in most low and lower-middle income countries. A second methodology is to perform healthcare utilization surveys at each sentinel surveillance site to define the incidence of both hospitalized and non-hospitalized SARI, since healthcare-seeking practices can differ regionally. This approach has been used in Bangladesh and Thailand [7],[9],[10]. While this approach can succeed in a research-oriented, well-resourced setting, this is not readily applicable to most low and lower-middle income countries with recently established sentinel influenza surveillance. Properly done healthcare utilization surveys are both time- and resource-intensive [27],[28],[29]. A more economical and perhaps more accurate approach would be to use data from one well-executed healthcare utilization survey, and adjust the results for every province using readily available data (e.g. DHS surveys), as done in our method [11].",

            "text": "Our method has several potential limitations. First, the estimates are sensitive to the base rate of SARI used. For example, to calculate incidence fully it is important to capture all the cases within a defined catchment area, which might mean enrolling children from multiple hospitals that serve the catchment area. Also, because healthcare utilization is suboptimal in many low income countries, rates tend to be higher, and perhaps more accurate of the true incidence, when using catchment populations closer to the facilities where cases are captured [18],[38],[44],[45]. We chose to use catchment areas within a 5 kilometers radius from our base rate surveillance hospitals in Kenya. Second, in Kenya, different case definitions were used for SARI among adults in the population-based surveillance and sentinel influenza surveillance, the main difference being that the latter required documented fever [13]. It has been shown that the adult SARI case definition commonly used for sentinel surveillance misses many cases of influenza-associated hospitalization, and we considered it important for a burden estimate to use a broader, more sensitive case definition for the base rate [46]. Even so, we likely missed some non-respiratory influenza-associated hospitalizations in which influenza might have exacerbated underlying chronic illnesses [47]. Third, we assumed that the severity of non-hospitalized SARI was equivalent to hospitalized SARI, which might not have been the case. In addition, because countries may use different case definitions for SARI, care should be taken when comparing incidence estimated by this tool between countries. For example, we used Guatemalan data to validate our method, despite their use of a pneumonia case definition that differed from the SARI case definitions used in Kenya. While this prevents direct comparison of influenza case counts and incidence between Guatemala and Kenya, or other countries with SARI surveillance, the data are internally consistent for each country and demonstrate flexibility of the methodology in being able to use locally available surveillance definitions. Lastly, our methodology did not produce estimates of influenza-associated mortality, which are useful to decision makers.",
