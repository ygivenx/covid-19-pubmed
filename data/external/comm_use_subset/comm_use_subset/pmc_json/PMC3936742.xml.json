In Escherichia coli, they are involved in the modification of the wobble uridine of , , , ,  and , all of which read NNA/G codons of the split codon boxes, with the exception of , which reads codons of the glycine family box (11). MnmE and MnmG are dimeric and form a functional \u03b12\u03b22 heterotetrameric complex (MnmEG) in which both proteins are interdependent (12,13). MnmE is a GTP- and tetrahydrofolate (THF)-binding protein, whereas MnmG is a FAD- and NADH-binding protein (14\u201318). The MnmEG complex catalyzes the addition of the aminomethyl (nm) and carboxymethylaminomethyl (cmnm) groups to position 5 of the wobble uridine using ammonium and glycine, respectively [Figure 1; (13)]. Both reactions require GTP and FAD as well as NADH if FAD is limiting in the in vitro reaction. Moreover, a THF derivative, likely methylene-THF, serves as the donor of the methylene carbon that is directly bonded to the C5 atom of U34. However, the detailed mechanism of the basic reaction has not yet been demonstrated (11,13). According to current models, GTP hydrolysis by the MnmE G-domain, which is located distant from the MnmEG active center, leads to structural rearrangements in the MnmEG complex, which are essential for tRNA modification (11,19).\n",

The structure also reveals that the two catalytic centers of MnmC(o) and MnmC(m) face opposite sides of the protein, thus favoring a model in which the two domains could function in a relatively independent manner. In fact, when two MnmC mutant proteins possessing a catalytically dead MnmC(o) or MnmC(m) domain were mixed, partial recovery of mnm5-group synthesis was observed (25). However, considering the relatively hydrophilic nature of the domain interface, the possibility that conformational changes within the entire MnmC protein may occur in vivo and affect its functioning, cannot be excluded. A previous attempt to separately express both MnmC domains revealed that MnmC(m) was soluble, whereas MnmC(o) produced inclusion bodies, suggesting that MnmC(m) is required for the correct folding or structural stability of MnmC(o) (25).",

Whether tRNAs preferentially utilize one of the two MnmEG pathways, the glycine or the ammonium pathway (Figure 1), in vivo depending on metabolic circumstances has not been investigated. The fact that only cmnm5, but not nm5 or mnm5 has been detected to date at position 5 of U34 in  and  suggests that both tRNAs do not use the ammonium pathway and are not substrates for MnmC(o). Accumulation of the nm5s2U nucleoside which may have a dual origin [Figure 1; (13)], has not been observed in total tRNA purified from wild-type E. coli cells (23). Therefore, the mnm5s2U synthesis in  and  appears to be organized to prevent nm5s2U accumulation. However, the presence or absence of cmnm5s2U as an intermediate in mnm5s2U biosynthesis is difficult to determine from nucleoside analysis of bulk tRNA due to the natural occurrence of cmnm5s2U in . Biosynthetic tuning of mnm5s2U to avoid the accumulation of intermediates could be achieved by either kinetic tuning of the activities of MnmEG and MnmC, which requires that the sequential modifications are performed at similar or increasing rates or selective degradation of partially modified tRNAs. A previous steady-state kinetic analysis of the activities of the full MnmC protein indicated that the MnmC(m)-dependent reaction (nm5\u2192mnm5) occurs faster than the MnmC(o)-dependent reaction (cmnm5\u2192nm5) or at a similar rate at very high substrate (tRNA) concentrations (26). However, this study did not take into account the efficiency of the reactions performed by MnmEG (Figure 1), which is crucial to understand the organization of the mnm5s2U biosynthetic process.",

Our study was facilitated by the cloning and separate expression of the two MnmC domains, MnmC(o) and MnmC(m). In contrast to a previous report (25), we demonstrate that MnmC(o) can fold independently of MnmC(m) and that the separate domains exhibit similar kinetic properties to those of the full protein. We also show that  and  are substrates for MnmC(m), but not for MnmC(o). Our data suggest that MnmEG and MnmC are kinetically tuned to produce only the fully modified nucleoside mnm5U in . We demonstrate that all the tRNA substrates of MnmEG are modified in vitro through the ammonium pathway. However, the net output of the ammonium and glycine pathways of MnmEG in vivo depends on growth conditions and tRNA species. Finally, we demonstrate that the loss of any MnmC activity has a biological cost under specific conditions.",

Transduction with phage P1 was performed as previously described (28). Deletion of the mnmC(o) coding region was performed by targeted homologous recombination (29) using the primers MnmC(o)\u0394-F and MnmC(o)\u0394-R. The MnmC(o)\u0394-F primer introduced a TAA stop codon at the end of the MnmC(m) coding region, which is located in the 5\u2032-terminal region of the mnmC gene. Deletion of the mnmC(o) coding sequence was confirmed by PCR and DNA sequencing. The resulting strain was named IC6629. DNA sequences coding for the MnmC(o) (250\u2013668 a.a.) and MnmC(m) domains (1\u2013250 a.a.) fused to the C-terminal end of a Flag-epitope were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from genomic DNA of E. coli MG1655 using the specific primer pairs Flag-MnmC(o)F/Flag-MnmC(o)R and Flag-MnmC(m)F/Flag-MnmC(m)R, respectively. The amplicons were cloned into pBAD TOPO TA for expression under control of the AraC-PBAD system. The resulting plasmids were transformed into a mnmC::kan strain, unless otherwise specified. A DNA fragment encoding the MnmC(m) domain fused at its N-terminal end to a 6x-His-epitope was cloned into the same vector after PCR amplification with the His-MnmC(m)R/His-MnmC(m)F primer pair. LBT (LB broth containing 40 mg/l thymine) and LAT (LBT containing 20 g of Difco agar per liter) were used for routine cultures and plating of E. coli, respectively, unless otherwise specified. When required, antibiotics were added at the following final concentrations: 100 \u00b5g/ml ampicillin; 12.5 \u00b5g/ml tetracycline; 25 \u00b5g/ml chloramphenicol and 80 \u00b5g/ml kanamycin.

The doubling time was measured by monitoring the optical density of the culture at 600 nm. Samples were taken from exponentially growing cultures after at least 10 generations of steady-state growth. The growth rate was calculated as the doubling time of each culture in the steady-state log phase by linear regression. Competition experiments were performed as previously reported (21). Briefly, the reference strain (BW25113) and the strain to be tested (TH48, TH49 or TH69) were grown separately to stationary phase by incubation at 37\u00b0C. Equal volumes of both strains were mixed and a sample was immediately taken to count viable cells on LAT plates with and without the antibiotic required to estimate the content of each strain (tetracycline to identify strains of the TH48 background). Six cycles of 24-h growth at 37\u00b0C (with shaking) were performed by diluting mixed cultures of 1/1000 in LBT medium. After the sixth cycle, the mixed culture was analyzed for its strain content as before.

This conclusion was consistent with the cmnm5s2U/mnm5s2U ratio observed in the \u0394mnmC(o) mutant (\u223c86/14), which clearly exhibited a MnmC(o)\u2212 MnmC(m)+ phenotype.

Taken together, these results clearly support the idea that MnmEG uses ammonium or glycine to modify tRNAs in vivo and that MnmC(m) functions independently of MnmC(o) [see strain \u0394mnmC(o) in Table 2] to transform tRNAs modified by MnmEG via the ammonium pathway (Figure 1), which raises the possibility that certain tRNAs may be substrates for MnmC(m), but not for MnmC(o).",

To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the expression and purification of the soluble form of MnmC(o). A previous attempt to purify this domain was unsuccessful because overexpression of a somewhat different, recombinant MnmC(o) produced inclusion bodies, which led to the hypothesis that MnmC(o) is incapable of folding on its own and requires the presence of MnmC(m) (25). Our data, however, demonstrate that MnmC(o) can fold independently of MnmC(m).

In the resulting strains, which were grown to exponential phase in the presence of the arabinose inducer, the recombinant MnmC(o) protein catalyzed the conversion of cmnm5s2U into nm5s2U, although a peak of remnant cmnm5s2U was observed (Figure 3C) and nm5s2U was fully transformed to mnm5s2U by MnmC(m) (Figure 3D). Similar results were obtained in the absence of arabinose (data not shown). This finding indicates that recombinant MnmC(o) and MnmC(m) are expressed and accumulate to some extent in the absence of the inducer, although it was not possible to detect them by western blotting with an anti-Flag antibody (data not shown). The fact that both proteins were capable of modifying tRNA despite their very low concentrations suggests that these proteins have high activity in vivo.",

In line with this, the assay buffer differed from that of the MnmC reactions where a relatively low concentration of Mg2+ was used (73 \u03bcM), as MnmC activities are known to be severely inhibited at 5 mM of Mg2+ (23).

We investigated the effect of mnmC mutations on growth rate in different genetic backgrounds and did not observe significant differences between the wild-type strain and any derivative carrying an mnmC allele [\u0394mnmC, mnmC-W131stop, \u0394mnmC(o) and mnmC(m)-G68D; Table 6]. We cannot explain why our results differ from those reported by Pearson and Carell (26), even when the same background (BW25113) was used. Perhaps, the dilution method used to maintain the pre-cultures in exponential growth could explain the different results. We took great care to not dilute the pre-cultures below an OD600 of 0.25 and to not exceed an OD600 of 0.5 in order to avoid major changes under the exponential growth conditions.\n",

Interestingly, in several genomes, potential orthologs of a single domain have been identified (24), but the biological function has been experimentally demonstrated only in the case of the Aquifex aeolicus DUF752 protein, an MnmC(m) homolog (41). It is unclear from the phylogenetic analysis whether the independent putative orthologs represent the ancestral or derived versions of the bi-functional MnmC enzyme (24). The ability of the E. coli MnmC(o) and MnmC(m) domains to function independent of each other, as shown in this work, suggests that the origin of the full MnmC protein present in \u03b3-Proteobacteria (24) likely occurred by domain fusion. The MnmC(o)\u2013MnmC(m) fusion in E. coli suggests a functional advantage of the spatial proximity of both domains. The fusion could increase the stability of the resulting protein. In fact, our results indicate that the entire MnmC protein is substantially more stable than the separate domains (Figure 2C) or other RNA modification proteins, such as RsmG or MnmG, which have half-lives of \u223c17 and 31 min, respectively (48). The possibility that the fusion also facilitates the functional cooperation between the domains during modification of tRNAs following the \u2018canonical\u2019 MnmEG-MnmC(o)\u2013MnmC(m) pathway (cmnm5U\u2192nm5U\u2192mnm5U) cannot be ruled out. A better understanding of how the MnmC protein functions will entail determining whether the binding of a tRNA molecule to one domain exerts a negative allosteric effect on the other domain. In this respect, the structural characterization of MnmC\u2013tRNA complexes could prove helpful.",

In Aquifex aeolicus, an interaction between the E. coli MnmC(m) homolog, protein DUF752 and the A. aeolicus MnmE and MnmG proteins has been observed (41). In E. coli, we did not detect interaction of MnmC with MnmE or MnmG by either fast-performance liquid chromatography (FPLC) analysis (Figure 2F) or SPR (data not shown). However, we cannot rule out the possibility of the MnmEG complex being able to interact with MnmC in vivo. It appears reasonable to hypothesize that the spatial clustering of tRNA-modifying enzymes within the cell can optimize the coordination of their work. Therefore, one challenging aim for future studies is to determine whether tRNA modifying enzymes are spatially organized, as observed for other enzymes involved in RNA biology, such as the components of the RNA degradosome (50).",

The analysis of bulk tRNA indicates that when \u0394mnmC(o) or \u0394mnmC strains are grown in LBT, the glycine pathway prevails over the ammonium pathway in the exponential phase as cmnm5s2U is the most abundant nucleoside (Figure 9A). However, a gradual change in the output of both pathways is observed along the growth curve so that the nucleosides produced by the ammonium pathway become prevalent during entry into the stationary phase (Figure 9B). In contrast, when cells are grown in minimal medium, the glycine pathway is prevalent in both the exponential and stationary phases (Figure 9A). A preference by MnmEG for the ammonium or the glycine pathway to catalyze tRNA modification may depend on the availability of these substrates, which, in turn depends on the growth medium and cell metabolism.\n",

In contrast, MnmC(o) plays a minor role when the ammonium pathway prevails; i.e. during the transition to stationary phase of cultures growing in LBT. In this case, the methylase activity of MnmC(m) functions fairly well alone [i.e. without the participation of MnmC(o)] to drive the production of the final modification mnm5(s2)U by transforming the intermediate nm5(s2) generated by the more active ammonium pathway (Table 4 and Figure 9B). Thus, the incorporation of MnmC(o) and MnmC(m) into the enzyme content of E. coli extends the adaptability of this bacterium to changing growth conditions.

Here our functional studies suggest that MnmC impairment is less detrimental than the inactivation of the MnmEG complex given that mnmC mutations neither reduce the growth rate in rich medium (Table 6) nor affect resistance to acidic pH (Figure 8). Nevertheless, impairment of any MnmC activity has a biological cost. Thus, mnmC mutations diminish the ability of cells to compete (Table 7), suggesting that fully modified tRNAs and, therefore the activities of MnmC, are required for efficient translation of mRNAs involved in the stationary phase stress response. In addition, our data indicate that mnmC mutations slow the growth rate of a mnmA strain, revealing a synergistic effect of mutations mnmC and mnmA. As mnmC mutations alone do not affect the growth rate, we hypothesize that the presence of the MnmA-dependent thiolation at position 2 of U34 in a subset of tRNAs can compensate for the lack of MnmC modifications at position 5 during exponential growth.",

During the transition to the stationary phase, nm5(s2)U is more abundant in mnmC(m)-G68D than in mnmC-W131stop (Figure 7, panels B and C). Therefore, the slightly better ability of the mnmC(m)-G68D mutant to compete might indicate that nm5(s2)U is more effective than cmnm5(s2)U in translating mRNAs required to sustain stationary phase stress conditions. Thus, it appears that the advantages offered by each intermediate, nm5(s2)U and cmnm5(s2)U, depend on the nature of the mRNAs to be translated which, in turn, depend on the growth conditions. Obviously, the synthesis of the final modification mnm5s2U is more advantageous to the cell as the strains expressing a fully active MnmC protein grow better under stressing conditions (i.e. those related to lack of MnmA and competition with other bacteria) than those strains lacking any MnmC activity. In conclusion, adaptation of MnmEG to use ammonium or glycine, together with the acquisition of MnmC(o) and MnmC(m) activities, provide E. coli with significant advantages to synthesize mnm5s2U and to survive under different conditions.",
