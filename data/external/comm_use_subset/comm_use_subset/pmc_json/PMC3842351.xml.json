            "text": "The mammalian innate immune system operates as the first line of defense against microbial pathogen invasion [1-3]. This system recognizes infectious agents through a limited number of germline-encoded pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) predominantly expressed on sentinel cells [2,4-6]. The host PRRs recognize and react with specific microbial components, known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which includes bacterial lipopolysaccharides, peptidoglycans, lipoteichoic acids and cell-wall lipoproteins, fungal \u03b2-glucan and viral nucleic acids [2,3,5,6]. The host PRRs exhibit distinct expression patterns and following sensing of their cognate ligands, activate specific signaling pathways that lead to the expression of a variety of inducible self-defense genes involved in the collective inflammatory and immune responses [2]. To date, four different classes of PRRs have been identified, including the cell membrane-associated C-type lectin receptors (CLRs), the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) at the cell surface and at the membrane of intracellular vesicles (endosomes and lysosomes), and the cytoplasmic detection systems for intracellular PAMPs, namely the RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) and the NOD-like receptors (NLRs) [3,6-8].",

            "text": "The RLRs are a family of DExD/H box RNA helicases critically and exclusively involved in the recognition of \u201cnonself\u201d RNA from actively replicating viruses in the cytoplasm of infected cells [9]. This receptor family consists of three members, the retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I/DDX58), the melanoma differentiation associated factor 5 (MDA5/IFIH1) and the laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2/DHX58) [10-14]. RIG-I and MDA5 share high sequence similarity and several structural features, including an N-terminal region consisting of tandem caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs), a central DExD/H box RNA helicase domain and a C-terminal domain (CTD). The two N-terminally located CARDs function as a signaling and interaction domain with other CARD-containing proteins [13,15,16]. The helicase domain retains catalytic activity to bind and unwind double stranded RNA (dsRNA) in an ATP hydrolysis-dependent manner [10,17]. The CTD plays a predominant role in high-affinity binding with dsRNA, encoding a repressor domain (RD) in RIG-I, but not in MDA5, which harbors an RD-like domain that does not participate in autoregulation [18]. These two RLRs detect a variety of both DNA and RNA viruses, particularly at early phase of viral replication, and signal the production of type I interferons (IFNs) and induction of an anti-viral response [10,17]. The third element of the RLR family, the LGP2 protein, lacks any CARDs but contains the helicase domain and the CTD also harbors a RD. The role of LGP2 in anti-viral immunity is less clear, but it has been suggested in different studies to serve both as a negative and a positive regulator of RIG-I and MDA5 signaling [10,19-21].",

            "text": "Despite the similarities between RIG-I and MDA5, they were shown to play different roles in anti-viral immunity by recognizing and protecting from specific classes of viruses [22]. RIG-I detects preferentially and most effectively short RNA sequences marked with 5\u2019-triphosphate group (5\u2019-ppp) and blunt-end of short double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) or single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) hairpins [23-27]. As a key sensor of ssRNA viruses, RIG-I is implicated in the response to Arenaviridae [28], Bunyaviridae [28], Filoviridae [28], Flaviviridae [18,29], Orthomyxoviridae [22,30], Paramyxoviridae [22,28,30,31] and Rhabdoviridae [22,23]. On the other hand, MDA5 is activated by high-molecular-weight poly(I:C) fragments [22,32], and also by long-duplex RNAs from the genomes of dsRNA viruses [30] or dsRNA replication intermediates of positive-strand viruses, such as Caliciviridae [33], Coronaviridae [34] and Picornaviridae [22,32]. Regardless the virus recognition specificity by RIG-I and MDA5, some viruses are redundantly sensed by both RLRs, such as the West Nile virus and the Dengue virus [30,35]. In addition to the extensively described recognition of RNA viruses by RIG-I and MDA5, a role in anti-viral signaling in response to several dsDNA viruses has also been observed. As an RNA sensor, RIG-I does not detect DNA directly; however, not only do many DNA viruses create dsRNA products by virtue of convergent transcriptional units derived from opposite strands, but also the host RNA polymerase III can mediate the transcription of cytoplasmic DNA templates (such as transfected poly dA:dT) into dsRNA containing 5\u2019-triphosphate, which will activate RIG-I and trigger the production of type I IFN [36,37]. Both Epstein-Barr virus and myxoma virus are detected by RIG-I, while vaccinia virus is sensed by MDA5 [38-40]. It is also likely that the precise RLRs utilized for the sensing of specific viruses also operate within cell-specific contexts as well.",

            "text": "Interaction between host and pathogen results in a dynamic arms race. Whenever pathogens develop strategies to overtake the host immune system, the host proteins involved in pathogen recognition have to respond by evolving to avoid or reduce potential infections. These dynamics result in host-pathogen adaptation and counter-adaptation, which in turns lead to the rapid co-evolution of both parties. Particularly for the host, this accelerated molecular evolution is often reflected in host defense genes that exhibit strong signatures of ongoing diversifying selection [41,42]. Because viruses are responsible for a great number of severe and lethal diseases, together with the important role that RLRs play in mammalian innate immune system, we expect that RIG-I, MDA5 and LGP2 genes may have been under intense selective pressures in all mammals. We have previously demonstrated that one other class of mammalian PRRs, the TLRs, exhibit striking evidence of positive genetic selection as a result of selective pressures exerted by pathogens [43]. Using six different codon-based Maximum Likelihood (ML) methods, we searched for evidence of long-term selective pressures in the three RLR genes present in the available sequenced mammalian genomes and, where possible, pinpoint positively selected residues that might be involved in the host-virus interactions that have shaped their rapid diversification. Specific lineages subject to episodic positive selection have also been identified in the three RLR genes by using two different branch-site models.",

When looking carefully at the European rabbit RIG-I deduced protein sequence (Figure S4), a great number of conserved regions between this species and the other mammalian species was observed, with the exception of a region between codons 840 and 879. This 40 amino acid domain region was unique to the European rabbit RIG-I. We originally speculated that this difference might have been the result of a gene conversion event with adjacent genes.

These models test at the codon level whether a hypothesis that allows for positive selection (models M2a and M8) is a better fit to the data when compared to a null neutral hypothesis (models M1a and M7). Results on the likelihood ratio test (LRT) performed between the likelihood scores of the null neutral and alternative selection models for each gene is indicated in Table 1. Models which allow for positive selection (M2a and M8) gave a significantly better fit to the data for both RIG-I and LGP2 alignments, suggesting that at least some of the codons within each set of orthologous gene sequences are subject to positive selection [56]. Since a recombination breakpoint was detected on the MDA5 alignment, each resulting segment (identified as 1st and 2nd segments) was tested individually for PAML package [54,55] site-specific models. Although the comparison between the null neutral site model M1a and the selection site model M2a did not allow for rejection of the null hypothesis of neutral selection, the comparison between the more powerful pair of site-specific models M7 (neutral) and M8 (selection) yielded significant LRTs (Table 1).

Based on the methodology adopted by other authors and in previous studies [43,47,48,64], only codons identified by at least three of the six used methods are considered to be under positive selection (Table S3). Since the breadth of species included in each alignment is wide, by applying several methods to detect codons under positive selection and by overlapping the results, we should be decreasing the incidence of false positives. A total of sixteen codons for RIG-I (Figure 4), twenty for MDA5 (Figure 5) and ten for LGP2 (Figure 6) were identified as candidate codons under selective pressure. Regarding their location in each corresponding protein, the greatest number of these codons are located in protein functional domains, more specifically, eleven out of the sixteen RIG-I codons (~ 69%), ten out of the twenty MDA5 codons (50%) and seven out of the ten LGP2 codons (70%). To estimate the percentage of positively selected codons in the three proteins, we used human deduced protein sequences as a reference. Human LGP2 exhibited 1.47% (10/678) of codons under positive selection. Higher values were obtained for human MDA5 and RIG-I, 1.95% (20/1025) and 1.73% (16/925) of codons under selective pressure, respectively.",

These models allow the selective pressure indicated by the nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rate ratio \u03c9 (dN/dS) to vary both across sites in the gene and across lineages on the tree [65]. Since no biological hypothesis existed to specify a priori branches to be examined for positive selection, the branch-site model A implemented in the PAML package [54,55,66] was applied to all species branches on each RLR gene phylogenetic tree. The LRT performed for each branch was significant for 2\u0394lnL > 3.84 [55,66]. Our analyses suggest that nine species branches in RIG-I are under selective pressure (Table 2 and Figure 4B). Branch-site model A was applied to the two MDA5 trees resultant from recombination testing and, for each tree, positive selection has operated only in two species branches (Table 3 and Figure 5B). For LGP2, a total of six species branches had significant LRTs corresponding to candidate lineages under selection (Table 4 and Figure 6B). Some of the species branches recognized by the branch-site model A were also identified by the branch-site REL method [67] (Table 5) available in the Datamonkey web server [52,53]. For both RIG-I and MDA5, two species branches were simultaneously identified by the two methods, consisting in dog (Calu) and European rabbit (Orcu) branches for RIG-I (Figure 4B) and giant panda (Aime) and Guinea pig (Capo) branches for MDA5 (Figure 5B). Only one LGP2 species branch, corresponding to the giant panda (Aime), was simultaneously identified by the branch-site model A and the branch-site REL method (Figure 6B). ",

Studies on known viral-recognition TLRs (TLR3, 7, 8 and 9) of closely related animal groups, like birds [70], or within species, like humans and chimpanzees [64], demonstrated that this class of PRRs exhibits a background of strong purifying selection to keep their functional integrity, albeit in the birds study [70] significant instances of positive selection acting on a few amino acid sites were identified. Nevertheless, when different ML codon-based methods were applied to detect evidence of acting positive selection in broader groups where a great number of species are included, like primates [64] and mammals [43], most of the viral TLRs exhibited strong evidence of positive selection and specific codons with a high probability of being under selection were identified. Similarly, in our study the codon-based analyses strongly support that the three RLR genes, RIG-I, MDA5 and LGP2, have all been subject to long-term selective pressures during mammalian evolution. Also, we applied several methods that identified specific RLR codons with a high probability of being under selection, which may directly perturb downstream immune responses in a particular host infected by a viral pathogen.

As codon models consider both synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions, the saturation of the first could cloud the information provided by nonsynonymous substitutions. Nevertheless, the sequence divergence in our study, inferred through RLRs tree length values, fit into intermediate and realistic levels that should confer power to the LRT used to compare nested codon-models and robustness to the branch-site models, and to the BEB approach for codon-specific detection of positive selection [58-60]. Also, in this study the mammalian species collected for each of the three RLR genes were nearly the same, thus this host species spectrum should not influence the codon-based analyses and our observations when comparing the level of selective pressure between genes.",

Nonetheless, the percentage of MDA5 codons under selection located in the known protein functional domains was the lowest. This should reflect the imposition of functional and structural constraints in MDA5 defined domains. On the other hand, we observed that LGP2 is apparently less prone to evolutionary change with the lowest number and percentage of codons under selective pressures. For RIG-I, the greatest number of codons identified as candidates under selective pressures were located in known protein functional domains, which might reveal the pressure imposed by the great number of viruses recognized by this RLR [13,14]. Vasseur and colleagues [68] came to different conclusions in their study, once they were focused on intra-species (human populations) polymorphisms and on the comparison of nonsynonymous to synonymous rates ratio \u03c9 (dN/dS) between human and chimpanzee lineages for the three RLR genes. RIG-I exhibited a stronger evolutionary constraint [68], as attested by its low levels of nucleotide diversity, population differentiation and low tolerance of amino acid-altering variation. It also exhibited a dramatic decay in the \u03c9 ratio when compared to the other two RLRs [68]. This is the expected outcome in evolutionary studies when using closely related species, or genetic information for population of the same species, which result in a background of strong purifying selection to keep the protein functional integrity. In the same study [68], the strongest signatures of positive selection were found in MDA5 and LGP2 by exhibiting higher \u03c9 ratios than RIG-I. Besides, MDA5 and LGP2 also appear to have evolved adaptively in specific human populations, presenting a great number of nonsynonymous mutations in both helicase and C-terminal domains [68].",

Interestingly, in our study, the CARDs of both RIG-I and MDA5 concentrated a large number of the deduced codons under selection. Some of these are radical in terms of their physicochemical properties changes across mammalian species (Figure 4 and Figure 5), strengthening the case for positive selection.

Bamming and Horvath [11] compared the amino acid sequences of the three human RLR helicase domains with the established consensus sequences of helicase families elements and, despite slight differences, the sequences in individual motifs are highly conserved within RIG-I, MDA5 and LGP2. Indeed, in our study the six helicase motifs of the three proteins were evolutionary conserved (data not shown) in the mammalian species collected.

Still, some branches of the three RLR phylogenetic trees exhibited evidence of positive selection. The two species under episodic positive selection on RIG-I phylogenetic tree, the domestic dog and the European rabbit, are susceptible hosts of two viruses recognized by RIG-I, rabies virus (Rhabdoviridae family) and myxoma virus (Poxviridae family), respectively [23,39]. Such results suggest that these lethal pathogens, and possibly other re-occurring viral infections in these specific hosts, might be exerting long-term selective pressures on the susceptible host RIG-I gene. Therefore, the changes on RIG-I sequences across species, with special focus on the RD as suggested above, should be the result of a co-evolutionary process between species-specific infecting viruses and this host RNA sensor protein.",

However, only one of the breakpoints (nucleotide 903) reflected a significant topological incongruence (Kishino-Hasegawa test, p<0.01), suggesting that the multiple tree model can be preferred over the single tree model. We reconstructed MDA5 phylogeny for the first 903 nucleotides of the mammalian alignment as also for the remaining 2211 nucleotides. To compare the different MDA5 trees topology, we also used the complete alignment (no recombination testing) to reconstruct the gene phylogeny and GTR+G nucleotide substitution model was indicated by the AIC as the best-fit. For the MDA5 segments which resulted from recombination detection, the best-fitting nucleotide substitution models were TIM3+G (first segment) and TIM3+I+G (second segment).

The BEB approach was also used to calculate the posterior probability of a specific codon site and to identify those most likely to be under positive selection (posterior probability >90%) [88]. On the other hand, the branch-site REL method [67] was applied to identify branches where a proportion of sites evolved under episodic diversifying selection.",
