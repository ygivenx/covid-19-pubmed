Despite their very high serum immunoglobulin concentrations, spleens of wild mice contained significantly higher proportions of na\u00efve B cells (and, reciprocally, significantly lower proportions of memory B cells) than the laboratory mice (Fig. 4b,c). This initially counter-intuitive observation probably reflects reallocation of antigen-experienced B cells from the spleen to the bone marrow, to other lymphoid tissues, or to sites of infection, together with continual repopulation of the spleen by na\u00efve, bone marrow-derived B cells. Wild mice had proportionately more germinal centre B cells in their spleens than did laboratory mice and PNA binding was comparatively higher on all B-cell subsets in wild mice, consistent with recent activation15 (Fig. 4d, Supplementary Table 2).

These include F4/80+ Ly6G\u2212 (M1) tissue resident macrophages, F4/80+ Ly6Glow (M2) monocytes/red pulp macrophages and F4/80+/\u2212Ly6Ghigh (M4) polymorphonuclear cells (PMN). The M4 PMN population could be further divided into neutrophils and myeloid-derived suppressor cells based on their forward and side scatter characteristics (Fig. 5e). Importantly, in wild, but not in laboratory, mice, we identified an additional population of F4/80+ cells expressing levels of Ly6G that are intermediate between monocyte/macrophages and PMN (M3). As far as we are aware, this is a novel population of cells not previously described, which we have termed hyper-granulocytic myeloid cells (HGMC) on the basis of their forward and side scatter characteristics (Fig. 5c\u2013e). Although there are some slight differences in levels of Ly6G expression between the M2 and M3/M4 populations in wild and laboratory mice (Fig. 5c) back gating of each population on CD11b, CD11c, and forward and side scatter confirmed that the M2 populations in wild and laboratory mice are otherwise identical and that the Ly6Ghigh population in laboratory mice is equivalent to the M4 population in wild mice (Fig. 5d). Comparison of the side scatter for each population also confirms that the high side scatter, hypergranulocytic M3 population is indeed seen only in wild mice (Fig. 5f). The functional significance of these cells is as yet unknown, but their discovery emphasizes that study of laboratory mice does not necessarily reveal the full armamentarium of the immune system.",

In contrast very few wild mice had any Ly49H+ NK cells (10%, n=125, \u22651% of Ly49H+ cells, Supplementary Data 1), suggesting that the gene encoding this receptor is rare in this wild mouse population or that allelic variation precludes recognition by the anti-Ly49H antibody. We genotyped mice at the Ly49h locus for a deletion that is associated with susceptibility to MCMV (ref. 17), finding that 18% of the wild mice were homozygous for this deletion (95% confidence interval 9.5\u201330%, n=98 mice from HW site; frequency of deletion allele 0.42 assuming Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium). This likely partially contributes to the scarcity of Ly49H+ NK cells among wild mice, but raises questions about the presence of additional null alleles at the Ly49h locus, and whether other receptors can compensate for the lack of Ly49H in wild mice, especially given the high prevalence of MCMV in the wild mouse populations, reported to be 62 and 79% (refs 19, 20).

This suggests the presence of different alleles at the Ly49G2 coding locus in the wild and laboratory populations. Among laboratory mice, interstrain differences in Ly49G receptor expression have been linked to allelic variation in promoter activity21 and may influence the threshold for NK cell activation18. These data support the idea that there is extensive, hitherto undocumented, allelic diversity among Ly49 receptors with likely important consequences for NK cell function in the wild.",

Among the 45 comparisons made between wild and laboratory mice (5 culture conditions \u00d7 9 cytokines) only 16 significant differences between wild and laboratory mice were observed, and in 13 of these analyte concentrations were significantly lower in the wild mice (Fig. 7, Supplementary Data 1, Supplementary Table 5). Of particular note, wild mice produced significantly less IL-12 (p40 and p70) and less IL-13 than laboratory mice in response to pathogen-related ligands and there was also a trend for IL-10 production to be lower in wild mice, although this was only significant at baseline. These comparatively depressed cytokine responses are in significant contrast to the highly activated cellular immune state of wild mice. We speculate that some form of innate immune tolerance may be operating to limit the degree of inflammation in chronically and highly pathogen-exposed wild mice. The only cytokine responses that were significantly higher in wild mice than in laboratory mice were the IFN-\u03b3, IL-4 and MIP-2\u03b1 responses to anti-CD3/anti-CD28, which are consistent with the higher proportions of memory and effector T cells in wild mice. These results suggest that innate cytokine responses, and their functional effects, may need to be re-evaluated in laboratory mice.",

By complete contrast, innate immune function\u2014as measured by cytokine secretion in response to pathogen-associated ligands\u2014is remarkably similar between highly infected wild mice and pathogen-free laboratory mice and, where there are differences, the responses of wild mice are suppressed. We suggest that this suppression of the innate immune response in the wild mice is also driven by their very high levels of antigen exposure, as a homeostatic mechanism to prevent immune-mediated pathology. These observations somewhat go against the emerging concept of \u2018trained immunity' or \u2018innate immune memory'\u2014that pathogen exposure epigenetically alters innate immune system cells such that they display heightened responses upon a subsequent encounter with the same or similar stimuli22. It is also notable that we have identified a novel cell population in wild mice\u2014which we have termed hypergranulocytic myeloid cells\u2014that are apparently absent from laboratory mice. Further work is needed to understand the role of these cells in immune defence and immune regulation. Also of particular interest is our observation of the high frequency of a deletion in the gene coding for the NK cell surface receptor Ly49H. Studies using laboratory mice have shown that deleting this gene results in lethal susceptibility to certain strains of MCMV (ref. 17). However, many naturally occurring strains of MCMV have mutations that abrogate binding to Ly49H, and such mutations can rapidly be selected for by serial passage of MCMV through mice bearing Ly49H (ref. 23) indicating that control of diverse strains of MCMV in the wild may be mediated by a number of different pathways. Our results also suggest that there may be much wider functional diversity in NK cells in wild mice than has hitherto been indicated by studies in laboratory mice.",

Our data are consistent with the immune systems of wild mice dynamically responding to a large and ever changing diversity of antigens: wild mice seem to be constantly immunologically multi-tasking. In contrast, laboratory mice are likely responding to a very limited antigenic repertoire, allowing greater immunological focus. A typical laboratory mouse experiment will introduce a single pathogen or antigen, often at a high dose and/or with an immune stimulating adjuvant, into an immunologically naive animal. The immune system this antigen encounters is in a largely antigen-inexperienced state, likely acting at baseline cellular turnover rates. In contrast, the same pathogen or antigen in a wild mouse would encounter an immune system that is already highly active and responding to many other antigens. The different states of the immune systems of wild and laboratory mice are therefore predicted to quantitatively and/or qualitatively alter the response to any given antigen. Further, in wild mice, there will be considerable inter-individual differences in these responses. Studies with laboratory mice therefore show what immune responses are possible, but these are not necessarily the immune responses that will actually occur in the real world. The immune response observed in a laboratory mouse is thus just one example of the myriad immune responses that can be generated by outbred, free-living individuals. Considerable caution should therefore be exercised in extrapolating results from laboratory mice to free-living animals and human populations. The research resource we provide here will allow results obtained in laboratory mice to be better contextualized, facilitating the translation of laboratory-based studies to real-world populations.",
