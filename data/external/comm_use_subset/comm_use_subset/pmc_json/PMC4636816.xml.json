Prevention and control of influenza is dependent on adequate surveillance via the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) [1]. The United States (U.S.) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is a WHO Collaborating Centre for the Surveillance, Epidemiology and Control of Influenza. In this capacity, CDC provides support globally, to build sustainable national capacity for influenza surveillance, enhance participation in WHO GISRS and build response capacity for the WHO International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005) [5].",

The Tool is composed of a series of questions, which cover a range of general and influenza-specific laboratory functions such as, virology and biosafety, as well as the quality of those functions. It is completed during country site visits by influenza experts from U.S. public health laboratories (including CDC) who make recommendations for improvement based on their observations and responses to the questions. Site visits or \u2018assessments\u2019 also provide an opportunity to deliver technical assistance, and to identify the resource requirements for each laboratory. The overall goal of the Tool, and each assessment, is to improve the quality of the work being done within GISRS and in particular, to accelerate national influenza laboratories towards achieving NIC recognition where it does not yet exist.",
