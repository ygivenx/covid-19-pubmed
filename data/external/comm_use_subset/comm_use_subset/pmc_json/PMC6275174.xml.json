            "text": "The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is the major intracellular protein degradation pathway and plays crucial roles in a variety of fundamental cellular processes, including regulation of gene transcription, cell cycle progression, autophagy, development and differentiation, and modulation of the immune and inflammatory responses (Glickman and Ciechanover, 2002; Wertz and Dixit, 2008; Zhao and Goldberg, 2016). There is increasing evidence that the UPS is required for viral infection by affecting viral entry, gene transcription, assembly, release and immune evasion (Banks et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2016; Casorla-P\u00e9rez et al., 2017). To the best of our knowledge, DNA viruses, as well as RNA viruses from different hosts, including mammals, insects, and plants, exploit the UPS system at various stages of the viral life cycle (Camborde et al., 2010; Contin et al., 2011; Katsuma et al., 2011; Greene et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2016). The proteasome machinery seems to play opposing roles during viral infection. On the one hand, proteasome inhibition with bortezomib leads to increased susceptibility to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus or coronavirus infection in vivo (Basler et al., 2009; Raaben et al., 2010). On the other hand, inhibition of proteasome activity prevents viral DNA replication and the formation of virus assembly sites during vaccinia virus (VACV) replication (Satheshkumar et al., 2009). Inhibition of proteasome activity also reduces Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) entry into endothelial cells and intracellular trafficking (Greene et al., 2012). Therefore, exploration of the molecular mechanism by which the UPS regulates viral replication will provide an alternative potential target for antiviral therapy.",

            "text": "Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV), a novel member of the genus Ranavirus, family Iridoviridae, was first isolated from diseased groupers. SGIV infection causes >90% mortality in groupers and sea bass (Qin et al., 2001). Our previous studies demonstrated that SGIV infection in grouper cells induces non-apoptotic cell death, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase, p38 MAPK, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling, which are involved in viral replication (Huang et al., 2011a,b). Genome annotation of SGIV reveals that some potential viral gene products, including ubiquitin (ORF102L) and predicted E3 ubiquitin ligase (ORF146L), might be involved in the regulation of the UPS during SGIV infection (Song et al., 2004). Transcriptome analysis of SGIV-infected grouper spleen shows that several genes associated with ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis are up- or down-regulated in response to SGIV infection, suggesting that the UPS plays important roles in SGIV infection (Huang Y.H. et al., 2011). However, the molecular mechanism underlying the regulatory effects of UPS on SGIV replication remain uncertain.",

After treatment with proteasome inhibitors, a significant delay in the severity of CPE was observed in infected cells treated with MG132, lactacystin or bortezomib, compared with that in DMSO-treated cells (Figure 2B). Given that severity of CPE evoked by SGIV is associated with cell viability (Huang et al., 2011a), we assessed virus-induced cell death under treatment with proteasome inhibitors. Consistently, treatment with these three inhibitors significantly decreased SGIV-induced cell death (Figure 2C). The effect of proteasome inhibitors on virus production was also evaluated by viral titer assay. Virus production was significantly reduced at 24 hpi in the presence of 5 or 10 \u03bcM MG132, 5 or 10 \u03bcM lactacystin or 5 \u03bcM bortezomib during infection, suggesting that the effect of proteasome inhibitors on virus production was dose dependent (Figure 2D).",

However, the potential roles of the UPS in fish viral infections remain largely uncertain (Huang et al., 2017). In our study, RNA-Seq based transcriptome analysis of SGIV-infected cells indicated that numerous genes related to the UPS were differentially regulated during SGIV infection. These genes were involved in different aspects of the UPS, including ubiquitination, deubiquitination and proteasome degradation. Proteasome subunit PSMA2, PSMA3, ubiquitin, E3 ubiquitin ligase, RFP37, UBE2A, and deubiquitinating enzyme USP1 were all significantly up-regulated during SGIV infection, suggesting that the UPS was involved in SGIV replication. During dengue virus serotype 2 infection, expression of ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 (UBE1) and proteasome subunits were increased (Kanlaya et al., 2010). In addition, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, 26S proteasome regulatory subunits, and ubiquitin were also differentially regulated by tomato ringspot virus infection (Babu et al., 2008).",

Proteasome inhibitors block avian reovirus replication at an early stage in the viral life cycle, but do not affect entry and internalization (Chen et al., 2008). The UPS is essential at all stages of human cytomegalovirus infection (Kaspari et al., 2008). In our study, both proteasome inhibitors and ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 inhibitor delayed CPE progression in SGIV infection and reduced the viral products. The formation of viral factories was also inhibited after proteasome destruction. Vaccinia-virus-infected, MG132-treated cells also lack viral assembly sites within the cytoplasm, which is accompanied by absence of late gene expression (Teale et al., 2009). Over-expression of grouper ubiquitin partly reverses the inhibitory effect of MG132 on SGIV replication, suggesting that ubiquitin also plays crucial roles in SGIV replication, like other mammalian viruses (Si et al., 2008; Karpe and Meng, 2012; Cheng et al., 2014). As two separate arms of the UPS, ubiquitylation, and proteasomal degradation are closely linked and act at different stages (Greene et al., 2012). Therefore, we propose that the UPS is required for fish iridovirus infection in vitro.",

Using 2-DE and MS analysis, we identified 62 differentially expressed proteins, including 15 viral proteins and 47 host proteins after MG132 treatment. Consistent with the data from western blotting, all the identified viral proteins were found in SGIV-infected cells, and almost undetectable in SGIV-infected MG132-treated cells, suggesting that viral protein synthesis were impaired after MG132 treatment. Apart from the viral proteins, certain host cellular proteins involved in different cell processes were regulated by SGIV infection or MG132 treatment. Among them, PDLIM1, PFN2, CTSB, and DUT were significantly up-regulated during SGIV infection, but significantly down-regulated in SGIV-infected MG132-treated cells. In contrast, SEPT2, PDB1, UROD, NAS, PDHA1, RpLP0, and SSR4 were significantly down-regulated during SGIV infection, but only slightly decreased in SGIV-infected MG132-treated cells. It has been reported that CTSB aggravates CVB3-induced viral myocarditis, probably through activating the inflammasome and promoting pyroptosis (Wang et al., 2018). Depletion of SEPT2 in HeLa cells increases replication of VACV (Beard et al., 2014). Our previous studies also demonstrated that grouper CTSB was involved in SGIV replication and SGIV induced apoptosis (Wei et al., 2014). Whether the action of CTSB on SGIV infection was mediated by UPS still remained uncertain. In addition, PDLIM1 negatively regulates nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB-mediated signaling, and PFN2 encodes an actin-binding protein involved in endocytosis (Ono et al., 2015; Luscieti et al., 2017). Whether these proteins exerted similar roles in SGIV infection and were regulated by UPS needs further investigation.",
