It is considered to be a potential anti-AIDS compound by preventing binding of HIV coat protein, gp120, to its CD4 receptor [17]. It has been demonstrated that ATA can inhibit the replication of viruses from several different families, such as the human immunodeficiency virus, also coronavirus, vesicular stomatitis virus and vaccinia virus. It does so by the inhibition of phosphatase activity of viral enzyme [18]. Because of its binding with cellular endonucleases, topoisomerases and various important signaling pathways, ATA has also been found to prevent apoptosis in a variety of cell models [19].",

We tested the amount of thiol groups modified by NBD-Cl forming Cys-S-NBD adducts. After treatment of recombinant YopH with 100 nM ATA, the quantity of Cys-S-NBD adducts was significantly decreased in comparison with control (Figure 2B). Application of ATA has resulted in an over 50% reduction of thiol-NBD adducts compared to control, suggesting that thiol groups in YopH after treatment with ATA are likely to be in oxidized form. Interestingly, the addition of catalase completely prevented ATA induced decrease of thiol adducts (Figure 2B).",

            "text": "In conclusion, we demonstrated that ATA effectively decreases the Yersinia YopH activity and has stronger binding to YopH active site than natural substrate. Here we proposed a unique mechanism of ATA caused inactivation of YopH involved with its redox process leading to generation of hydrogen peroxide. We suggest that the potent inhibitory properties of ATA are due to strong binding in the YopH active site and generation of hydrogen peroxide directly inside the active site. The studies on inhibitory properties of ATA against YopH are a good starting point for the synthesis of analogous inhibitors and potentially lead to clinical applications. Further studies on ATA analogs and cellular aspects of ATA are underway.",

Human recombinant CD45 was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The solutions of the recombinant PTPs were prepared in 10 mM HEPES buffer pH 7.4. The final concentration of phosphatase in reaction samples was 0.8 \u03bcg/mL (10 nM). The YopHs and CD45 enzymes were untreated (control) or treated with solution of ATA and peroctanoic acid. The assay was performed in 96-well microplates, and the final volume of each sample was 200 \u03bcL. The enzymatic activities of YopHs and CD45 were measured using 1 mM chromogenic substrate para-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) in 10 mM HEPES buffer pH 7.4, at 37\u00b0C. Phosphatase hydrolyzed pNPP to para-nitrophenol and inorganic phosphate. Para-nitrophenol is an intensely yellow colored soluble product under alkaline conditions. The increase in absorbance (due to para-nitrophenol formation) is linearly proportional to enzymatic activity concentration (with excessive substrate, i.e. zero-order kinetics) and was assessed at 405 nm on a microplate reader Jupiter (Biogenet) using DigiRead Communication Software (Asys Hitech GmbH).",

A conventional three-electrode configuration consisting of a glassy carbon electrode (GC), a working electrode with a 3-mm diameter. The platinum wire used as the counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl in 3M KCl reference electrode were used, respectively. Each time before use, the working GC was polished with Al2O3 powder on a wet pad, then the electrode was washed with nanopure water, and dried under a stream of nitrogen. The oxygen-saturated DMSO solution used to perform measurement was obtained by the procedure described in the literature [26]. The concentration of oxygen in oxygen-saturated DMSO at 298 K was 2.2 \u00b7 10\u22123 M [27]. During all the experiments with oxygen the air was carefully excluded from the measurement cell and the oxygen was bubbled directly into the cell in order to obtain desirable concentration. The error in oxygen concentration of all measurement is estimated to be approximately 1%. The oxygen flow was adjusted by a mass flow controller (HiTec, Bronkhorst).",

A time step of 2 fs and a direct-space non-bonded cutoff of 10 \u00c5 were used. After the protein preparation, all systems were minimized to remove the steric clashes that occurred. The systems were then gradually heated from 10 to 300 K over a period of 50 ps and then maintained in the isothermal\u2013isobaric ensemble (NPT) at a target temperature of 300 K and a target pressure of 1 bar using a Langevin thermostat [32, 33] and a Berendsen barostat with a collision frequency of 2 ps and a pressure relaxation time of 1 ps, respectively. We constrained hydrogen bonds using the SHAKE algorithm [34]. We have used the velocity-Verlet algorithm (default algorithm for the Amber MD package) for MD simulations. Particle mesh Ewald (PME) procedure was used to treat long-range electrostatic interactions using default parameters [35]. After bringing the systems at our suitable temperature and pressure of 300 K and 1 bar, respectively and equilibrating the system for 500 ps, the production run was continued for 20 ns in the isothermal\u2013isobaric ensemble at the target temperature of 300 K and target pressure of 1 bar using the same Langevin thermostat and Berendsen barostat.
