By providing an anatomic barrier that separates the organism from the external environment, the alveolar epithelium serves as a first line of defense against potential inhaled pathogens. While the cells of the innate immune system, such as alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells, harbor the bulk of the responsibility for prompting an immune reaction upon encountering inhaled pathogens, the cells that comprise the alveolar epithelium have also been implicated in aiding to trigger an inflammatory response.",

            "text": "The alveolar epithelium is comprised of two morphologically different cell types \u2013 alveolar type I (TI) and alveolar type II (TII) cells. TII cells, which cover 3\u20135% of the alveolar surface area, are cuboidal epithelial cells with diameters of \u223c10 \u00b5m. TII cells have been extensively studied and have been labeled defenders of the alveolus for their immunomodulatory functions [1]. TII cells can produce cytokines and chemokines, such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1\u03b1 (MIP-1\u03b1), growth related oncogene \u03b1 (GRO-\u03b1) and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in response to various forms of lung injury induced by bacteria, viruses, or mechanical ventilation [2]\u2013[4]. TII cells also produce, secrete, and recycle surfactant, which can enhance chemotaxis, bacterial uptake and phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages [5], [6], but can also inhibit cytokine production in response to LPS [7]. Far less is known about the potential of TI cells to participate in the inflammatory response. TI cells are large, thin squamous epithelial cells with diameters that range up to 100 \u00b5m and cell bodies that can be as thin as 50 nm [8]. TI cells comprise 95% of the alveolar epithelium, making them a major component of the physical barrier to respiratory pathogens. Despite this fact, the prevailing paradigm has been that TII cells are the inflammatory cells of the alveolar epithelium, while TI cells help form the mechanical barrier to pathogens but do not participate in the active cellular immune response of the lung.",

TI cells contain toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), a receptor for lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a cell wall protein found on gram negative bacteria, and primary rat TI cells have been shown to produce the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 in response to LPS stimulation [9]. Given these findings, particularly in the context of the extensive alveolar surface area covered by TI cells, we hypothesized that TI cells were capable of producing a wide array of inflammatory mediators like their TII counterparts and that the alveolar microenvironment can influence TI cell cytokine production.",

We performed PCR array analysis on primary rat TI and TII cells isolated by FACS from LPS-injured and non-injured control animals to compare their inflammatory profiles. To isolate the specific responses to LPS treatment from each cell type, we cultured FACS-isolated TI and TII cells, treated the cells with LPS, and then measured pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion using ELISA. We discovered that TI cells produce more cytokines per cell after LPS treatment than TII cells, but this effect was magnified by the fact that TII cells produced relatively small amounts of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 or IL-1\u03b2 in response to LPS, which is contrary to previously published reports [10]\u2013[12]. We discovered that the discrepancies between our results and those of other investigators were due to the method of TII cell isolation, and that contamination of TII cell preparations by macrophages accounted for the observed differences in cytokine expression. Alveolar macrophages are dominant mediators of lung immunity, patrolling the epithelial surface to phagocytize invading pathogens and generating cytokines and chemokines to recruit neutrophils to augment the immune response [13]. Given the differences seen in the response of TI and TII cells to LPS stimulation and the effect of co-culturing TII cells with macrophages, we sought to evaluate how elements of the alveolar microenvironment could affect TI cells. Therefore, we also examined the effects of macrophages and surfactant on the LPS-induced inflammatory response of TI cells.",

We chose to study CCL21, a C-C chemokine that is chemotactic for thymocytes and activated T-cells in vitro, and IL6r because they were the two most differentially expressed genes of all assayed. We selected to validate SPP1 and CCR5, as they are well-studied inflammatory mediators (see below), and IL10ra, interleukin 10 receptor alpha, because its ligand, IL-10, is considered an anti-inflammatory cytokine [21].

We chose to measure the protein expression of SPP1 and CCR5 as well-characterized antibodies were available for these proteins. SPP1 is an important participant in both innate and acquired immunity [22], acting as a chemotactic factor for macrophages, dendritic cells and T cells [23], [24], and is strongly expressed in the alveolar macrophages of patients with ARDS [24], [25]. SPP1 also acts as an important signal transducer that interacts with different pathways to mediate immune responses. SPP1 can activate NF-\u03baB transcription, which promotes cytokine and inflammatory mediator expression [23] either by signaling through the Src and FAK tyrosine kinases to activate NF-\u03baB, or by phosphorylating I\u03baB\u03b1, an inhibitor of NF-\u03baB, which induces I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation and subsequent translocation of NF-\u03baB to the nucleus. Our qPCR data validated the finding of high levels of SPP1 in LPS-injured TI cells. Western blotting of lysates from both control and LPS-stimulated alveolar epithelial cells demonstrated that TI cells contain more SPP1 than their TII cell counterparts, and that injured TI cells had significantly more SPP1 protein than either injured TII or control TI or TII cells. C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), a member of the beta chemokine receptor family, functions as a receptor for many C-C chemokines including monocyte chemoattractant protein 2 (MCP-2), macrophage inflammatory protein-1\u03b1 and -1\u03b2 (MIP-1\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2), and regulated on activation normal T expressed and secreted protein (RANTES) [26]. CCR5 is also a co-receptor for HIV-1 and the target for the HIV drug Maraviroc [27]. Our qPCR validation data indicate that CCR5 is more highly expressed in control TI cells versus TII cells and in LPS-treated TI versus TII cells (Figure 2A), however, the protein expression levels of CCR5 were not statistically different among the cell types studied (Figure 2B), suggesting that CCR5 in alveolar epithelial cells may undergo more post-transcriptional modification than SPP1.",

The levels of cytokine expression in our FACS-isolated cultured TII cells were notably less (Figure 3). The most obvious difference between our findings and those published reports was that our TII cells were isolated via FACS. In order to determine the cause of these seemingly discordant results, we isolated TII cells utilizing a standard published protocol for TII cell isolation [30] and treated the TII cells in the exact same fashion as our FACS-isolated TII cells: we placed the cells in culture in media with fetal bovine serum overnight, stimulated the cells with LPS in serum-free media the next morning, and collected the cells and supernatant 18 hours later. We chose to measure TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 secretion via ELISA as the overall level of IL-1\u03b2 production for both cell types was low and alterations in levels of expression would be difficult to appreciate. Both at baseline and after LPS stimulation, TII cells isolated in the conventional manner (non-FACS) demonstrated much higher levels of TNF-\u03b1 (1882.4\u00b1255.4 pg/ml) and IL-6 (406.3\u00b184.5 pg/ml) than TII cells isolated by FACS (TNF-\u03b1 59.0\u00b119.8 pg/ml; IL-6 56.2\u00b116.5 pg/ml) (Figure 4A). The numbers for the non-FACS TII cells were more consistent with published reports of LPS-induced cytokine production in TII cells, suggesting that the difference in cytokine production may be due in part to the contaminating macrophages present in each preparation.",

With FACS, we were able to achieve TII cell purities between 95\u201398% (Figure 4B), resulting in a 2\u20135% rate of contamination. To determine if contaminating macrophages could account for enhanced cytokine expression in non-FACS cultured TII cells, we isolated macrophages and added them to our FACS TII cells in culture at varying concentrations. The numbers of macrophages were chosen to reflect similar degrees of contamination of TII cell preparations. The percentage of macrophages was calculated from the number of alveolar epithelial cells used in the experiments (500,000 cells/well), as previously described in Methods. When stimulated with LPS, increasing the concentrations of macrophages produced increasing amounts of TNF-\u03b1 (5% Mac: 1328.4\u00b1133.3; 10% Mac: 2341.6\u00b1551.4 pg/ml, 15% Mac: 3834.5\u00b1875.4 pg/ml, 20% Mac: 6021.0\u00b11041.3 pg/ml) and IL-6 (5% Mac: 73.7\u00b123.3 pg/ml, 10% Mac: 124.4\u00b143.4 pg/ml, 15% Mac: 198.8\u00b171.6 pg/ml, 20% Mac: 302.4\u00b167.9 pg/ml) as expected. We then co-cultured FACS-isolated TII cells with 0%\u201320% macrophages and treated the cells with LPS prior to measuring supernatant cytokine expression. We discovered that increasing the number of macrophages predictably increased, in a dose-dependent fashion, TNF-\u03b1 production (TII+0% Mac: 47.3\u00b112.1 pg/ml; TII+5% Mac: 1090.3\u00b1402.3 pg/ml; TII+10% Mac: 1910.6\u00b1658.3 pg/ml; TII+15% Mac: 3770.4\u00b1688.1 pg/ml; TII+20% Mac: 4137.2\u00b11559.9 pg/ml) to levels that have been reported in the literature for TII cells stimulated with LPS [11], [28]. Co-culturing FACS-isolated TII cells with 5\u201320% macrophages increased IL-6 production over LPS-stimulated TII cells alone, but the levels were not statistically different (TII+0% Mac: 53.9\u00b114.1 pg/ml; TII+5% Mac: 48.9\u00b111.5 pg/ml; TII+10% Mac: 95.9\u00b146.4 pg/ml; TII+15% Mac: 72.7\u00b115.0 pg/ml; TII+20% Mac: 67.3\u00b113.5 pg/ml) (n = 3, Figure 5B). However, IL-6 levels from stimulated co-cultures of TII cells and 20% macrophages was significantly reduced over levels for stimulated macrophages alone (#p<0.05).",

These results not only reinforce our findings that TI cells produce more cytokines per cell than TII cells both at baseline and upon LPS exposure, but also reveal that macrophages have a more profound effect on TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 secretion on TI cells than TII cells in response to LPS (Figure 5A & B). Furthermore, LPS stimulation of a co-culture of macrophages and TI cells produced significantly more TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 than LPS stimulation of macrophages alone, suggesting that interplay between macrophages and TI cells clearly enhances immune system activation.",

In an attempt to gain insight into how macrophages may promote such a heightened cytokine response in TI cells, we collected the supernatant from cultured macrophages (10% Mac) that had been stimulated with LPS and then added the conditioned media to cultured TI cells. Conditioned media from LPS-stimulated macrophages (10% Mac) increased TI cell TNF-\u03b1 production (4111.2\u00b1195.6 pg/ml), but not nearly to the levels seen after LPS addition to co-cultures of TI cells and macrophages. This same macrophage conditioned media, however, blunted the degree of TI cell IL-6 production (337.0\u00b131.2 pg/ml) when compared to LPS-treated TI cell IL-6 expression, which is in contrast to the high levels of IL-6 measured in LPS-stimulated co-cultures of TI cells and macrophages. Conditioned media from LPS-stimulated macrophages did not significantly increase TII cell cytokine production over TII cells stimulated with LPS, nor did conditioned media from LPS-stimulated TII cells alter macrophage cytokine production over LPS treatment alone (results not shown). The addition of conditioned media from LPS-stimulated TI cells to cultured macrophages did increase TNF-\u03b1 (4956.7\u00b1654.1 pg/ml) and IL-6 (446.3\u00b113.8 pg/ml) levels above those seen with the addition of LPS to macrophages (10% Macs) alone (Figure 6), but again, less than the levels seen with the co-culture of TI cells and macrophages after LPS treatment (Figure 5). These results suggest that while substances secreted by activated macrophages can stimulate TI cell production of TNF-\u03b1 and inhibit TI cell production of IL-6, cell-cell interaction between macrophages and TI cells significantly enhances the cytokine production of both TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, additionally overcoming the inhibition of TI cell IL-6 production by activated macrophage conditioned media.",

LPS, acting through the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), can activate the phosphorylation of IKK\u03b1/\u03b2, which allows phosphorylation of I\u03baB within the NF-\u03baB complex, leading to ubiquitination of the I\u03baB complex and release of NF-\u03baB, allowing its translocation to the nucleus where it enhances transcription of various inflammatory mediators. Whether this mechanism of inflammation was present in TI cells was unclear. Using immunohistochemistry, phospho-IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 staining was present in cultured TI cells as early as 10 minutes after LPS stimulation, with a progressive reduction in staining intensity at 30 minutes, 1 hour, 4 hours, 8 hours and 18 hours (Figure 8A). Similar staining was seen in TII cells (data not shown). NF-\u03baB expression, as measured by qPCR in cultured cells, is elevated in both TI and TII cells after LPS stimulation, suggesting that LPS may act via the well-described NF-\u03baB/I\u03baB pathway in both cell types to stimulate cytokine secretion (Figure 8B).",

            "text": "The alveolar epithelium has a number of very important functions, primary among them gas exchange and existence as a tight barrier to separate organism from environment. Alveolar TII cells have traditionally been considered the immune cell of the alveolar epithelium as this cell produces surfactant, cytokines and chemokines, all of which have been implicated as being important factors in lung immunity. TII cells, however, only cover approximately 5% of the internal surface area of the lung, while TI cells cover the remaining 95% [8], prompting the question of whether TI cells could participate in the innate immune response since they comprise the majority of the epithelial barrier. Earlier, Mason and colleagues had studied TII cells that had been cultured until they exhibited phenotypic characteristics similar to TI cells (TI-like cells) and demonstrated that after LPS or viral stimulation, these cells could produce CINC-2, CINC-3, LIX, MIP-2 and MCP-1 [39], [40], suggesting the possibility that TI cells could play a role in innate immunity. Prior methods of TI cell isolation [41] involved labeling the cells with magnetic beads and performing both positive and negative sorting of the cells over magnetic columns, which resulted in TI cell purities of 75\u201390% [42], [43]. But as techniques became available to isolate relatively pure populations of TI cells via FACS, we employed such methods to study primary alveolar TI cells. We were able to recently report that TI cells are capable of producing TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 when exposed to LPS [9], advocating a role for TI cells in the innate immune response in the lung. Our current study reports not only that TI cells are able to produce a wide range of cytokines, chemokines, and other mediators of inflammation, but that there is differential expression of a number of these mediators between TI and TII cells, suggesting different roles for these cell types in the inflammatory response of the lung.",

Similar widespread gene induction was seen in LPS-injured TI cells, with TI cells having much higher-fold gene expression than TII cells from the same injured animals.

When comparing control and LPS-treated TI cells, only three genes were significantly induced in LPS-treated TI cells versus controls. Similarly, in our comparison of control and LPS-treated TII cells, only five genes were more highly expressed in LPS-treated TII cells than controls. The relatively high expression levels of the majority of the genes at baseline in both sets of control cells may have rendered the up-regulation of genes after LPS treatment less striking by comparison, leaving us to underestimate the true number of mediators that may have been enhanced by injury.",

Studies have shown that TNF-\u03b1 production from freshly isolated rat alveolar epithelial cells can decrease dramatically, from 1200 pg/ml immediately after isolation to 50 pg/ml 48 hours later [12]. Subjecting the cells further to FACS may have contributed to the degree of stress experienced by the cells. Additionally, alveolar epithelial cells isolated from LPS-treated rats have not only been exposed to the intratracheally instilled LPS, but also to growth factors, surfactant, immune cells, endothelial cells, cytokines, chemokines and a host of other proteins released by surrounding cells in response to LPS that end up in the alveolar microenvironment. These products of inflammation undoubtedly affect cytokine expression in both TI and TII cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that the cell isolation procedure and cell sorting may have resulted in the production of higher levels of inflammatory mediators at baseline in control cells that may not have been present if the cells could be studied in vivo. Such results led us to use cultured primary cells that had been given at least 24 hours to recover from the isolation process before stimulation with LPS or other agents. Furthermore, this method allowed the assay of cytokine secretion via ELISA analysis of the conditioned media. Despite the fact that working with cells from LPS-injured animals is the more valid in vivo model, we used in vitro studies of cultured cells to isolate the specific responses of each cell type to various agents and conditions.",

This finding is noteworthy, since the TII cell has long been considered to be the immune effector cell of the alveolar epithelium [1], [44].

The surface area ratio of TI\u2236TII cells is 43\u22361 [8] and the ratio of numbers of TI\u2236TII cells in the lung is 1\u22362 [45], so in this instance, even if TII cells were to produce 43 times the amount of cytokines after LPS treatment, their levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 production would still be less than that of TI cells. Alternative methods of culturing cells based on protein or DNA content or surface area ratios were considered, but have inherent problems as well, especially since the biologically significant ratio of TI to TII cells when comparing cell function is not known. The desire for consistency and reproducibility within our experiments, particularly when dealing with such a small number of TI cells obtained per isolation (\u223c1\u00d7106 cells/rat) and the need to standardize our co-culture experiments led to our use of cell number in plating our cultures.",

This concern of cell contamination contributing to the overall cytokine response of TII cells has been expressed by other investigators [12]. Co-culture of FACS-isolated TII cells, which have cell purities of 98\u201399%, with increasing concentrations of alveolar macrophages produced levels of TNF-\u03b1 that increased in a dose-dependent fashion and were similar to those obtained with stimulated macrophages alone, suggesting that the contaminating macrophages within the non-FACS TII cell preparations account for the majority of the TNF-\u03b1 expressed when the cells are treated with LPS. IL-6 production, however, was not significantly different in co-cultures of FACS TII cells with macrophages stimulated with LPS, nor did the levels of IL-6 at any FACS TII/macrophage co-culture concentration reach those obtained from studies of LPS-treated non-FACS TII cells (Figure 4A). These findings suggest that there may be cells other than macrophages within the contamination cohort of the non-FACS TII cells that contribute to the LPS-stimulated rise in IL-6 production.",

Exposing cultured TI cells to conditioned media from LPS-treated macrophages suggested that while TI cells do respond to inflammatory mediators liberated by activated macrophages by increasing TNF-\u03b1 secretion, cell-cell interaction between macrophages and TI cells is a much more potent factor in modulating TI cell cytokine release. Conditioned media from activated macrophages decreased the levels of TI cell IL-6 compared to LPS-stimulated TI cells alone, while LPS treatment of co-cultures of TI cells and macrophages significantly increased IL-6 production. The IL-6 conditioned media experiments reinforce the notion that cell-cell interaction between TI cells and macrophages is powerful, as co-culture of these cells overcomes the inhibition of IL-6 production in TI cells by inhibitory mediators released by activated macrophages. While the exact cell of origin of the IL-6 in this instance is unclear, these results not only make a strong case for TI cells as key participants in the immune response of the lung, but they also suggest that the interaction between macrophages and TI cells may be equally important.",

Surfactant has been shown to decrease cytokine production in whole lungs [48], [49], and this general finding has been attributed to the effects of surfactant on alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells. There have been reports that surfactant may bind members of the TLR-4 pathway or may inhibit the translocation of TLR-4 to lipid raft domains, thus blunting TLR-4-driven cytokine production [33], [50]. Our co-cultures of TII cells and macrophages displayed reduced levels of IL-6 when compared to IL-6 production in LPS-treated macrophages alone, initially suggesting that surfactant may be blunting the IL-6 response. Our findings demonstrated that exogenous surfactant decreased TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 production in LPS-treated TI cells, but did not significantly affect cultured TII cells or macrophages. Given that TII cells produce surfactant, additional surfactant may not have conferred any additional biological effects. And while the doses utilized here have been used in other studies, our doses in macrophages may have not been high enough to elicit an inhibitory response [33], [35], [50]. Nevertheless, our studies suggest that there may be a component of cellular interplay between TII cells and macrophages in co-culture that is leading to a reduction in IL-6 production after LPS stimulation. Furthermore, the fact that surfactant decreased cytokine production in LPS-treated TI cells suggests that any portion of the dampened inflammatory cytokine response in the distal lung achieved through the addition of exogenous surfactant may have been due to the actions of surfactant on TI cells alone. Future work in determining how surfactant can affect the immunity of TI cells may lead to a better understanding of how surfactant modulates the immune response of the lung.",

[52] developed a conditional transgenic mouse model of mutated RelA, an NF-\u03baB protein, throughout the alveolar epithelium and reported that only a small subset of inflammatory mediators was produced by the alveolar epithelium after LPS or Streptococci pneumoniae exposure upon comparison of wild type to RelA\u0394/\u0394 mice. While these are very interesting results, comparisons between their study and ours must be made with caution. As is often the case with transgenic mouse models, the relative presence, or absence, of certain targeted genes can vary, even between genotypically similar littermates [53]. Furthermore, species specific differences in the inflammatory response have been well-reported [54]\u2013[58], which may be a primary reason for the discordant results. The authors subjected whole lung samples from their wild type and RelA\u0394/\u0394 mice to PCR array analysis, whereas we focused on isolated rat TI and TII cells. They did study isolated mouse TI cells, but only measured production of CCL20 and CXCL5 mRNA, whereas we measured both transcript and protein expression patterns of various pro-inflammatory cytokines. Nevertheless, despite the differences in study design and methods, the final message culled from both of our reports is largely the same: alveolar TI cells may play an active role in the innate immune response. While the differences in cell-specific cytokine production that we observed are intriguing, there was never the expectation that the alveolar epithelium would produce levels of cytokines that would rival that of immune cells such as alveolar macrophages or dendritic cells. The more relevant question to us was whether or not TI cells could produce cytokines, and thus participate in the innate immune response of the lung.",

Future investigation into possible mechanisms contributing to the differential inflammatory response of TI and TII cells to LPS, along with more characterization of the alveolar microenvironment during injury, are essential to better understanding the role of the alveolar epithelium and its component cells in the innate immune response of the distal lung.

Relative to the expression of the above genes in TII cells of control animals, uninjured TI cells had higher levels of expression of all inflammatory mediators studied. LPS injury increased cytokine transcripts of all genes compared to controls for TI and TII cells, but the only in the case of IL10ra and CCL21 in injured TI cells was the fold-increase significant over uninjured TI cells (*p<0.05). Data is expressed as fold expression of inflammatory mediator transcript over TII cell controls \u00b1 SEM; all values were normalized to 18S. B. Western blot analysis: Western blots of cell lysates from TI and TII cells of control and LPS-injured (LPS 10 mg/kg) rats were probed with antibodies against CCR5 and SPP1. \u03b2-actin staining is shown to exhibit equalization of protein loading. Blots represent 3 separate experiments. Densitometry measurements suggest that control TI cells contain \u223c20% more SPP1 than control TII cells, and injured TI cells contain \u223c30% more SPP1 protein than control TI cells. Both differences are statistically significant. Furthermore, SPP1 protein expression from injured TI cells was significantly greater than from control TI cells. Control TI cells contain only \u223c5% more CCR5 than control TII cells and injured TI cells express \u223c15% more CCR5 than injured TII cells, but the differences were not statistically significant.
