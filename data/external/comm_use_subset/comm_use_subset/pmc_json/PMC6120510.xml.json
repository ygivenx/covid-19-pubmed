            "text": "Vampire bats occur in Central and South America and are exceptional among mammals in that they subsist exclusively on blood (Greenhall, Joermann, & Schmidt, 1983; Greenhall, Schmidt, & Joermann, 1984; Greenhall & Schutt, 1996). The common vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus) is one of three extant species of vampire bats (Chiroptera, Phyllostomidae, Desmodontinae) (Greenhall et al., 1983). Before the introduction of domestic animals, common vampire bat populations in Latin America were likely small, as the bats\u2019 only source of bloodmeals presumably was large wild animals. However, the proliferation of domestic animals following European colonization created an abundant and reliable food source, which seems to support larger population sizes of vampire bats (Costa & Esb\u00e9rard, 2011; Delpietro, Marchevsky, & Simonetti, 1992; Fenton et al., 1992; Voigt & Kelm, 2006).",

            "text": "Large populations of common vampire bats impact both human and animal health. Vampire bats are the primary reservoir of human and livestock rabies in Latin America, a virus which causes a universally lethal encephalitis and has a host range spanning all mammals (Delpietro, Lord, Russo, & Gury\u2010Dhomen, 2009; Salm\u00f3n\u2010Mulanovich et al., 2009; Schneider et al., 2009; Warner et al., 1999). Vampire bats may also transmit trypanosome parasites to domestic horses and cattle (reviewed by Hoare (1965)) and act as reservoirs and potential vectors of pathogenic bacteria and viruses (Bai et al., 2012; Brand\u00e3o et al., 2008; Lima et al., 2013; Sabino\u2010Santos et al., 2015; Volokhov et al., 2017). Although culling of vampire bats is a widespread practice for rabies control, recent work has questioned its efficacy and cost\u2010effectiveness and instead advocated for vaccination of susceptible species and ecological strategies to prevent exposures (Anderson et al., 2014; Blackwood, Streicker, Altizer, & Rohani, 2013). Appropriate use of either strategy relies critically on knowledge of local vampire bat\u2013prey interactions; however, existing methodologies to study vampire bat diet are limited. Stable isotope analyses of bat tissues have been commonly applied and can distinguish between domestic livestock and wildlife, but are unable to distinguish prey at the species level (Streicker & Allgeier, 2016; Voigt & Kelm, 2006). Other studies using DNA markers have been more specific, but failed to identify prey in large proportions of samples and used time\u2010consuming approaches that do not easily scale to large data sets (Bobrowiec, Lemes, & Gribel, 2015; Carter, Coen, Stenzler, & Lovette, 2006; Ito, Bernard, & Torres, 2016). This illustrates that while genetic approaches offer an attractive solution to reconstruct vampire bat diets with high specificity, existing methods have not yet reached a technical level that would make them cost\u2010effective and efficient for large\u2010scale applications.",

            "text": "A second challenge for managing vampire bat\u2010transmitted rabies is that transmission to humans, wildlife and livestock is underpinned by metapopulation dynamics and travelling waves of infection within vampire bats (Benavides, Valderrama, & Streicker, 2016; Blackwood et al., 2013). These complex spatial dynamics challenge prediction of localities at risk of rabies outbreaks; however, recent work has shown that genetic inference of vampire bat population structure can identify the future geographic pathways of ongoing epizootics (Streicker et al., 2016). Genetic tools for simultaneous inference of vampire bat diet and population structure are therefore desirable to forecast which areas rabies is likely to invade next, and the species that will be at risk of spillover infection. Such information could together guide the timing and species to be targeted for vaccination. Moreover, tools for large\u2010scale analysis of bat diet would help to forecast changes in human rabies risk following deforestation or hunting\u2010driven declines in preferred prey or conversely, how recovery of wildlife due to conservation efforts could reduce human rabies.",

            "text": "One potential solution to the technical limitations of previous studies of vampire bat diet is to draw on recently developed advances in biodiversity assessment linked to environmental DNA (eDNA), where second\u2010generation sequencing is applied to DNA extracted from environmental samples such as soil, water, gut contents and faeces (Bohmann et al., 2014; Taberlet, Coissac, Hajibabaei, & Rieseberg, 2012a). Ideally, this approach would be applied to samples collected from vampire bat roost environments, enabling analyses to be conducted over larger geographic scales without the need for time\u2010consuming capture and sampling of wild bats. Today, the principal approach for sequencing informative DNA in eDNA mixtures is the so\u2010called DNA metabarcoding approach, in which 5\u2032\u2010nucleotide\u2010tagged primers (Binladen et al., 2007) are used to PCR amplify mitochondrial mini\u2010barcodes of taxa within a taxonomic group (Taberlet, Coissac, & Pompanon, 2012b). The amplicons are subsequently sequenced in parallel on a second\u2010generation sequencing platform. After processing the resulting sequences, taxa can be identified by comparing the obtained \u201cbarcode\u201d sequences to DNA reference databases (Valentini et al., 2009). The ability to only sequence informative DNA markers and to process and sequence many samples in parallel make metabarcoding a cost\u2010effective and efficient way to assess biodiversity. Furthermore, if the DNA reference database and chosen barcode marker allow it, assignments can be made for prey down to the species level. Given this, metabarcoding has experienced increasing popularity and is now used in biodiversity assessment (e.g., Chariton, Court, Hartley, Colloff, & Hardy, 2010) and animal diet studies (e.g., Bohmann et al., 2011; Deagle, Kirkwood, & Jarman, 2009; Soininen et al., 2009). Metabarcoding has recently been applied to determine hosts of pathogen\u2010transmitting invertebrate blood\u2010feeders, for example, mosquitoes (Logue et al., 2016) and sand flies (Kocher et al., 2017). Metabarcoding of vampire bat diet, however, represents a distinct methodological challenge, compared to, for example carnivores or generalist predators, as the primers that target mammalian prey will inevitably also amplify bat DNA. In such studies, predator sequences are in excess to a point where they can prevent detection of prey taxa (e.g., Deagle, Eveson, & Jarman, 2006; Shehzad et al., 2012). To optimize detection of prey taxa, they are often reduced through presequencing measures, such as predator blocking primers (Deagle et al., 2009; Vestheim & Jarman, 2008). Post\u2010sequencing, remaining predator sequences are used to validate predator species identity after which they are discarded (e.g., Pi\u00f1ol, San Andr\u00e9s, Clare, Mir, & Symondson, 2014). Co\u2010amplified predator sequences might, however, offer an overlooked opportunity to get insights into predator population structure simultaneously with the diet analysis.",

Bat capture and bloodmeal sampling followed Streicker and Allgeier (2016). Bats were captured using mist nets and/or harp traps placed outside daytime roosts (caves, mines, tunnels and hollow trees) between 18:00 and 06:00 hr. Bats were caught at daytime roosts to avoid biasing dietary inferences by sampling bats near potential prey (Bobrowiec et al., 2015). Captured bats were anaesthetized by intramuscular injection of ketamine (83\u2013125 mg/kg), and a sterile 5\u2010French nasogastric feeding tube attached to an empty syringe was inserted through the oesophagus into the stomach to extract a sample from the bloodmeal. For each bat, ca. 50 \u03bcl blood was extracted and expelled onto a Whatman Flinders Technology Associates (FTA) card and desiccated. Bats were kept in cloth bags until they recovered from the anaesthesia after which they were released. There were no mortality or signs of injury following bloodmeal collection. Faecal samples from individual bats were collected from cloth bags or during handling, while pooled faecal samples (~5) were collected opportunistically from underneath roosting bats and stored in RNAlater (Sigma).",

This enabled (i) screening for contamination in negative extraction controls and across samples, (ii) determination of the optimal cycle number in the subsequent tagged PCR amplifications that would stop the reaction during the exponential phase or just after the plateau and (iii) determination of the maximal amount of template in which PCR inhibitory substances would not distort the results of amplification of prey DNA. The qPCRs were carried out in 25 \u03bcl reactions containing 1 \u03bcl template DNA, 1 U AmpliTaq Gold, 1\u00d7 Gold PCR Buffer and 2.5 mm MgCl2 (all from Applied Biosystems), 0.2 mm dNTP Mix (Invitrogen), 0.4 \u03bcm each of 5\u2032 nucleotide tagged forward and reverse primer and 1 \u03bcl of SYBR Green/ROX solution (one part SYBR Green I nucleic acid gel stain (S7563) (Invitrogen), four parts ROX Reference Dye (12223\u2010012) (Invitrogen) and 2000 parts high grade DMSO).

PCR amplifications were performed with matching tags (e.g., F1\u2010R1, F2\u2010R2, etc.) to ensure that tag jumps would not result in false assignments of sequences to samples (Schnell et al., 2015). Furthermore, the three PCR replicates from each sample were made with different tag combinations to account for possible tagged primer biases and cross\u2010contamination (Berry, Ben Mahfoudh, Wagner, & Loy, 2011; Schnell et al., 2015). PCRs were prepared as the qPCR, although omitting SYBR Green/ROX, adding a final extension of 7 min and omitting the dissociation segment. All negative controls appeared negative when visualizing PCR products on 2% agarose gels. DNA extracts that initially failed to PCR amplify were re\u2010attempted with 30 cycles. Only PCR products with different tags were pooled to enable sequencing of many PCR replicates in parallel, while still being able to track the tagged PCR products back to the correct PCR replicate. Amplicon pools were bead\u2010purified (Faircloth & Glenn, 2014; Rohland & Reich, 2012) and quantified on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies).

Optimal cycle number for the index\u2010PCR was estimated using qPCR, and the libraries were indexed with eight cycle PCRs and bead\u2010purified. Each indexed library was quantified on a 2100 Bioanalyzer, after which they were pooled and sequenced with 230\u2010bp paired\u2010end chemistry on an Illumina MiSeq sequencing platform aiming at ca. 15,000 paired reads per PCR replicate.",

Sequences within each library were sorted according to primer and tag combinations using a modified version of DAMe (https://github.com/shyamsg/DAMe; Zepeda\u2010Mendoza, Bohmann, Carmona Baez, & Gilbert, 2016). For each primer set, thresholds for filtering sequences across each sample's PCR replicates followed a restrictive approach and were guided by the negative and positive controls sequenced (Alberdi, Aizpurua, Gilbert, & Bohmann, 2018; De Barba et al., 2014). Sequences were clustered using sumaclust (Mercier, Boyer, Bonin, & Coissac, 2013) with a similarity score of 0.96 and a maximum abundance ratio of 0.90. A contingency table of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) by samples was created for each primer set, and copy numbers of OTUs were normalized across samples. blastn (Altschul et al., 1997) was used to compare the OTUs against the ncbi genbank database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), and the output was imported into megan community edition version 6.5 (Huson, Auch, Qi, & Schuster, 2007). OTUs assigned to ascomycetes were removed from the COI data set. In the contingency table, OTUs were grouped into categories according to assigned taxonomy: common vampire bat, vertebrate prey and for COI, invertebrates. Within each of the categories, the proportion of sequences of each OTU was calculated in each sample. Within OTUs assigned to common vampire bats, vampire bat assignments to samples were made if an OTU had >95% (16s) and >99% (COI) of sequences assigned to vampire bat OTUs in the sample (erroneous OTUs were in lower frequency for the COI marker). For vertebrate prey identifications, a conservative approach for removing erroneous OTUs was used. Initially, OTUs that never had >5% of sequences in any sample within the vertebrate category were removed. Following this, vertebrate prey OTUs were assigned to samples if they had >10% of sequences (bloodmeals and individual faecal samples) and >0.5% of sequences (pooled faecal samples) of sequences within the vertebrate prey category.

As the number of chicken prey detections was low (two total detections combined across all sites), the prey preference was computed for only mammalian prey species (cow, pig, sheep), using the same method as described above.",

Although both the 16s and COI markers detected common vampire bat in almost all samples (98.3% and 99.2%, respectively, Table S1b), the relative abundance of common vampire bat sequences was higher for the longer COI marker both within samples (Figure 2a), and for all samples combined (Figure 2b). As such, fewer prey sequences could be assigned when using the COI primer set (Figure 2b), with obvious consequences for prey detection power. For example, while the 16s primer set detected prey in 90.7% of samples, the COI marker only detected prey in 82.2% of samples (Table S1b). Furthermore, while for the 98 cases in which mammal prey was detected, both markers identified the same taxa, the 16s primers enabled 16 additional mammalian prey detections, while the COI primer set only enabled three additional mammalian prey detections (Figure 2c). This difference was to some extent outweighed by the ability of the COI primer set to detect birds, arthropods and nematodes (Figure 2b,c).",

These observations are not uncommon in metabarcoding diet studies. Predator DNA is generally in excess, even to the point that it swamps the prey DNA (e.g., Deagle et al., 2006; Shehzad et al., 2012). One approach to reduce PCR amplification of predator DNA is to use predator blocking primers (Deagle et al., 2009; Vestheim & Jarman, 2008), although coblocking of prey has been reported (Pi\u00f1ol, Mir, Gomez\u2010Polo, & Agust\u00ed, 2015). We could not design common vampire bat\u2010specific blocking primers due to high intraspecific variation in the common vampire bat and the lack of reference sequences for potential prey species. Instead, we optimized amplification of prey DNA in the metabarcoding PCRs. Both low amounts of template and PCR inhibitors (such as co\u2010extracted heme compounds, Akane, Matsubara, Nakamura, Takahashi, & Kimura, 1994) can limit PCR amplification, and thereby sequencing, of taxa that are in low proportions and/or are not well amplified by the primers (Chandler, Fredrickson, & Brockman, 1997; Murray et al., 2015; Polz & Cavanaugh, 1998). Therefore, we carried out an initial qPCR screening to ensure that we added the maximum template amount to the metabarcoding PCRs without causing PCR inhibition (Murray et al., 2015; Shapiro & Hofreiter, 2012). Additionally, we used the qPCR to determine the minimum number of PCR cycles to be run in the metabarcoding PCR to minimize PCR stochasticity and bias against poorly amplified taxa (Pi\u00f1ol et al., 2015; Polz & Cavanaugh, 1998). Furthermore, we used relatively short mitochondrial markers to optimize detection of fragmented prey DNA (Deagle et al., 2006), and we used two different markers in order for their prey detections to supplement each other. For each marker, three PCR replicates were made per sample to reduce effects of PCR stochasticity and optimize prey detection and error removal during bioinformatic processing (Alberdi et al., 2018; Polz & Cavanaugh, 1998). These measures enabled us to overcome challenges in using metabarcoding to assess the diet of a blood\u2010feeding predator that is in the same taxonomic group as its prey, without the use of blocking primers and to detect vertebrate prey in 93.2% of samples (Table 1), which far exceeds previous DNA\u2010based vampire bat diet studies that detected prey in 25%\u201350% of samples analysed (Bobrowiec et al., 2015; Carter et al., 2006; Ito et al., 2016).",

In our study, mammal prey by far outweighed chicken detections (Figures 1b and 3). Furthermore, when comparing detected prey with numbers of available vertebrate prey, we found fewer chicken detections in the prey than what would be expected based on chicken availability, while cows and pigs were overrepresented in the diet compared with availability (Table S1d), although these analyses do not account for differences in biomass. These findings are in agreement with those of a study in Brazilian Amazonas that found that even though chicken was the most attacked prey, pigs were highly preferred in relation to prey availability, which suggested a preference for mammalian prey (Bobrowiec et al., 2015). However, when we compared preferences for only cow, pig and sheep, the bats did not have obvious preferences for pigs (Table S1e). While avian DNA was rare in common vampire bats and restricted to chickens in our study (Figure 3), three additionally analysed samples from hairy\u2010legged vampire bats only contained birds, including both domestic chickens and two wild bird taxa, the Spix's guan (Penelope jacquacu) and tinamous (Tinamus sp.)

We identified tapir (Tapirus sp.) in bloodmeals from four of 13 analysed bats in the MDD130 site in the Amazon (Figure 1). Based on the employed markers, we could not determine which tapir species the bats had fed on, but geographic distributions of tapir species indicate that it can have been lowland tapir (Tapirus terrestris). Identifying tapir in about a third of the bats at this site indicates that tapirs might be a reliable and accessible food source for the vampire bats here. Tapirs are commonly hunted by Amazonian communities where they occur and can be rapidly depleted due to their slow reproductive rates (Peres, 2001). If the bats rely on tapir, this creates a potential conflict between bats and humans for food; if tapir populations are depleted by human hunting, bats might shift to other wild mammals or humans, which would have consequences for disease transmission patterns and risks. As mentioned, we also detected wildlife in two of three additionally analysed bloodmeal samples from hairy\u2010legged vampire bats (Table S2), which further indicates the bats\u2019 dependence on wildlife in this site. Although we did not detect human DNA, a previous study at this site recorded frequent bat bites on humans (Streicker & Allgeier, 2016). Currently, no other method exists that can identify domestic and wild prey to low taxonomic levels across large numbers of vampire bats. Thereby, metabarcoding enables future studies to, for example, assess how much vampire bats rely on co\u2010occurring wildlife, how bat diet, and consequently risk of disease transmission, is altered following, for example, hunting or environmental change and to determine vampire bat vertebrate prey taxa over large geographic scales and use it to inform projections of disease transmission.",

Although vampire bats are thought to subsist only on vertebrate blood (Bobrowiec et al., 2015; Carter et al., 2006; Ito et al., 2016), sparse documentation of arthropods in common vampire bat stomachs does exist (Arata, Vaughn, & Thomas, 1967; Greenhall, 1972). This information was obtained through invasive measures, while our metabarcoding study allowed detection of arthropods without sacrificing the bats. Our study indicates that consumption of arthropods by common vampire bats is a widespread and relatively common phenomenon. Furthermore, metabarcoding confirmed the arthropods to be ectoparasitic taxa when DNA reference databases were sufficient to identify DNA to low taxonomic resolution. Our high observed frequency and geographically widespread nature of this phenomenon are unsurprising given that common vampire bats have high levels of infection by ectoparasites and engage in self\u2010 and allo\u2010grooming (Patterson, Dick, & Dittmar, 2008; Carter & Leffer, 2015; reviewed in Greenhall et al., 1983). Detected arthropods are therefore likely ectoparasites ingested during grooming (Aguirre, Herrel, & Van Damme, 2003; Greenhall, 1972). However, it is also conceivable that ectoparasites might be ingested while the bats feed from vertebrate prey, which if confirmed, would support the hypothesis that blood feeding in vampire bats might have evolved from a previous specialization on ectoparasitic arthropods of larger animals (Arata et al., 1967; Fenton, 1992; Gillette, 1975).",

            "text": "Lastly, it is worth mentioning factors which should be considered when interpreting the metabarcoding diet results. First, more than one individual prey can only be detected if they are different species. Second, multiple vampire bats can consume blood from the same prey individual, even on the same night (Greenhall, Schmidt, & Lopez\u2010Forment, 1971), meaning that detection of, for example, four tapir feeding events does not necessarily indicate that four tapirs were present and fed upon. Finally, prey detected in an individual bat might not be prey that was directly preyed upon by the bat itself as common vampire bats regurgitate and share bloodmeals with roost mates that did not manage to feed (Wilkinson, 1984). Despite these limitations, our results show that metabarcoding is an efficient tool for high\u2010throughput molecular characterization of variation in the feeding behaviours of vampire bats, and that it can reveal both vertebrate prey, arthropods and gut parasites if a broad taxonomic marker is chosen.",

In contrast to Sanger sequencing that produces one sequence per marker per sample, metabarcoding produces thousands of sequences, of which some carry errors such as those arising during PCR and sequencing (see e.g., Alberdi et al., 2018). We used filtering approaches and OTU clustering to optimize reliability of the resulting sequences (Alberdi et al., 2018). But in contrast to OTU clustering with the aim to approximate species equivalents, we clustered at a high similarity to balance detection of intraspecific variation with identifying only real intraspecific variation. This metabarcoding methodology can be extrapolated for simultaneous assessment of diet and predator population structure in metabarcoding diet studies of other predators in which predator DNA is co\u2010amplified with the prey and where the marker has intraspecific variation for the predator.",

            "text": "In our study, both employed markers had clear geographic structure for the common vampire bat (Figure 4). The mitochondrial markers from all bats from the coastal sites west of the Andes were distinct from bats at other sites. For the 16s haplotype, they differed with 6 bp from the other identified 16s haplotype, and for the COI, they differed with 23 and 25 bp from the two other COI haplotypes (Figure 4 and S1b). This indicates that the Andes act as a barrier for dispersal, at least for female vampire bats. Mitochondrial geographic structure has been reported in the common vampire bat in the cytochrome b (Ditchfield, 2000; Martins, Ditchfield, Meyer, & Morgante, 2007; Martins, Templeton, Pavan, Kohlbach, & Morgante, 2009; Streicker et al., 2016) and COI region (Clare, 2011; Hern\u00e1ndez\u2010D\u00e1vila et al., 2012). For the COI, the reported intraspecific sequence divergence is compared with what we detected. Some have suggested that high mtDNA differentiation indicates the presence of cryptic common vampire bat species (Martins et al., 2007), but less marked geographical structure in nuclear markers suggests that populations are not entirely isolated (Clare, 2011; Martins et al., 2009; Streicker et al., 2016). The high site\u2010specificity in mtDNA, but not in nuclear markers, can be explained by the social organization of the bat, where female offspring stay in their natal group unless their mothers die or move, while males disperse (Wilkinson, 1985). Streicker et al. (2016) studied population structure of the common vampire bat in Peru using a cytochrome b marker and revealed more haplotypes than the two 16s and three COI haplotypes detected in the present study (Figure 4). This can be explained by the higher intraspecific variability of the cytochrome b region (Hajibabaei, Singer, Clare, & Hebert, 2007; Tobe, Kitchener, & Linacre, 2011). If a more fine\u2010scaled haplotype assessment is needed in future studies, a cytochrome b marker should therefore be used. It is important to note that the caveat of using mitochondrial markers is that it limits inference of population structure to females. In the case of the common vampire bat that has male\u2010biased dispersal and where males have been linked to disease spread, this limits the power of mitochondrial markers for prediction of spread of vampire bat\u2010transmitted pathogens (Streicker et al., 2016). For this purpose, nuclear metabarcoding markers should be used to complement the mitochondrial population structure (Streicker et al., 2016). However, for other research questions and purposes, the ability to use metabarcoding to simultaneously screen many samples for diet and be able to infer mitochondrial population structure \u201cfree of charge\u201d can open up novel insights. To achieve this obviously requires choosing a study animal (and populations) with intraspecific mitochondrial diversity within a relatively short marker. Furthermore, it requires careful primer selection to choose metabarcoding markers with the desired level of intraspecific diversity for the predator, while optimizing amplification of diet taxa.",

However, a few pooled faecal samples were collected noninvasively from underneath roosting bats, and as we showed, prey can be identified from such samples (Table 1). Future studies could exploit this noninvasive sample collection technique to scale up vampire bat diet and population structure assessments to larger numbers of samples. However, if this method is pursued, it is worth keeping in mind that pooled data will preclude conclusions about the number of individual bats represented without further analysis of bat identities using higher resolution genetic markers. Furthermore, pooled data do not allow quantification of the relative proportion of prey consumed by individual bats.",
