To determine the causative agent of the diarrhea that was present at the AHHF pig farm in China, total RNA isolated from the small intestine content of the pigs was extracted and subjected to RT-PCR. The results show that the sample was positive for TGEV but negative for PEDV (Figure 1A).

The major parent strain of the recombination located in the ORF1a gene was SC-Y, and the minor parent strain was H16 (Figure 4B). SC-Y of TGEV (accession No. DQ443743) was isolated from Sichuan Qionglai in China.20 H16 of TGEV (accession No. FJ755618)19 was isolated from Shanghai in China. Both SC-Y and H16 viruses show a strong pathogenicity in piglets. The major parent strain of the recombination located at the S gene was virulent Purdue, and the minor parent strain was attenuated H (Figure 4C). These results indicate that TGEV AHHF was the result of a natural recombination event between the Miller cluster and the Purdue cluster.",

The ORF1a and S genes are two important recombination sites (breakpoints). The breakpoint located in ORF1a has previously been found, for example, in human coronavirus OC43.45 Recombination breakpoints have also been identified in the S gene, for example, in human coronavirus NL63.46 In this study, two breakpoints, which are located in the ORF1a and S genes, were found, and will provide valuable information on CoV recombination and evolution.",
