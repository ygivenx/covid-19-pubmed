Currently, the utility of first-line antiviral agents or immune system modulators recommended by the World Health Organization can only help to reduce and control the viral load and minimize liver damage, but cannot effectively clear the infection and seldom achieve a cure [3, 4]. Thus, these current therapies remain far from satisfactory. In particular, the wide spread of multidrug-resistant HBV strains is increasingly threatening the efficacy of currently available antiviral drugs [5, 6]. Therefore, there is an urgent need to actively develop and test promising novel therapies to target HBV.",

Owing to its efficient infectivity, high loading capacity, and stability outside of cells, adenovirus (Ad) is a promising candidate vector for gene delivery, and has been widely adopted for many gene therapy strategies developed to date [8]. Ad-HBV is considered to be the primary HBV immunotherapeutic developed through a transgenetic approach with the aim of application for treating patients chronically infected by HBV [9, 10]. Ad-HBV is a therapeutic vaccine candidate based on human E1- and E3-deleted replication-defective Ad serotype 5 (Ad5) vectors encoding an HBV fusion protein consisting of a truncated form of the HBV core domain (at the N-terminal) fused to a deleted and mutated HBV polymerase sequence, and two HBV envelope domains are inserted within the polymerase deletions. The nucleotide sequence encoding this HBV fusion protein is based on the HBV isolate Y07587, which was slightly modified [9]. This vaccine candidate was designed to stimulate specific T cell-based immunity similar to that seen in HBV resolvers.",

In all cases, Ad-HBV was demonstrated to effectively induce T cells to produce various cytokines [interferon (IFN)-\u03b3/tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and interleukin (IL)-2] in response to HBV antigen stimulation [9]. However, there were some potential disadvantages noted, including damage to the host immune response, hepatocytoxicity, and a short half-life; thus, non-clinical safety assessment is essential prior to further clinical development and trial as a vaccine. An unsolved challenge in the development of gene therapy drugs is that the vectors and their encoding proteins ultimately become immunogenic in some patients, thereby provoking an immune response resulting in immunotoxicity [11]. In contrast to therapeutic proteins whose immunogenicity is mainly evaluated by measuring the levels of anti-drug antibodies produced, there is currently no well-established and widely accepted method for the immunogenicity assessment of gene therapy drugs [12, 13]. Therefore, in the present study, we focused on evaluating the immunogenicity of the subcutaneous injection of Ads-HBV vaccines in a non-human primate at different doses to obtain reference data through a non-clinical safety assessment in preparation for a clinical trial.",

The remaining animals were left to recover for 4 weeks. Monitoring parameters were collected from each animal at several time points.

Based on a cut-off point of optical density values at 450 nm, the positive and negative pre-administration serum samples from the same animals were screened out and their neutralizing activity was further measured using an adapted luciferase-based virus neutralization assay [22]. In brief, the diluted serum samples (1/100, 1/500, and 1/1000) were mixed with 1.0 \u00d7 106 VP of Ad5-Luc2 in complete DMEM, which is a luciferase-expressing Ad vector (ShenZhao Biotechnology, China), and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Then, 5 \u00d7 104 A549 cells were added to the medium and incubated at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2 for 24 h. The luciferase assay system (Promega) was used to measure luciferase activity in the cells with a microplate reader (BioTek). Finally, neutralizing antibody activity in the blood of each animal after administration was evaluated according to the following formula. Neutralization efficiency (%) = [(Mean fluorescence intensity of the pre-administration control group \u2212 mean fluorescence intensity of the administration group)/mean fluorescence intensity of pre-administration control group] \u00d7 100%.",
