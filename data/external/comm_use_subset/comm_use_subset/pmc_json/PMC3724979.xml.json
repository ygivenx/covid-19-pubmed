Software has been developed which allows small sized proteins to be \u2018built\u2019 with high resolution (Rohl et al. 2004a; Rohl et al. 2004b; Kim et al. 2004; Kaufmann et al. 2010). Building assemblies of small membrane proteins, approaches have been adopted which include a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and docking protocols in various ways (Bowie 1997; Kukol & Arkin 1999; Kerr et al. 1996; Forrest et al. 2000; Cordes et al. 2001; Bowie 2005; Patargias et al. 2006; Psachoulia et al. 2008; Kr\u00fcger & Fischer 2009; Park et al. 2012). A major obstacle, is to assemble proteins with oligomeric TMD topology. Simplified, but nevertheless bio-inspired routes have to be defined while assembling the proteins using a computational approach (Hsu & Fischer 2011).",

            "text": "The routes of assembly are guided by the knowledge of how membrane proteins are inserted or \u2018folded\u2019 into the lipid membrane. Membrane proteins are translated at the endoplasmic reticulum with the help of translocons (Johnson & van Waes 1999; Rapoport et al. 2004; Cheng & Gilmore 2006). The translocons are membrane spanning proteins which enable the primary sequence of a membrane protein to be folded into the secondary structure within the hydrophobic environment of the lipid membrane. The topology of the respective membrane protein is generated according to the information encoded in its primary sequence (von Heijne 1988; Hessa et al. 2005; Fink et al. 2012). The protein is then finally released into the lipid bilayer. The \u2018monomeric unit\u2019 is the protein, which needs to be assembled further into the quaternary fold. Within the lipid membrane, the fold of a helical motif is adopted by the membrane protein prior to any consecutive steps like assembly or integration of co-factors (Popot & Engelman 1990; Engelman et al. 2003). Therefore, once the secondary structure is formed, the protein remains in this fold.",

Viral channel forming proteins are found as bitopic and polytopic membrane proteins with up to three TMDs (Hsu & Fischer 2011; Fischer & Kr\u00fcger 2009; Wang et al. 2010). What they all have in common, is their existence as homo-oligomers with a minimum number of four monomeric units in order to be totally functional. Their biophysical role is identified as to alter chemical or substrate gradients across the lipid bilayer. However, the function within the infectivity cycle of the individual viruses still remains mostly to be discovered.",

The genome of HCV is expressed as a large polyprotein which is cleaved by proteases into the array of individual proteins posttranslational. The polytopic p7 protein is located at the border between the structural protein E2 and the following non-structural proteins (Lin et al. 1994). With its 63 amino acids, it has been suggested to have two TMDs (Patargias et al. 2006; Carr\u00e8re-Kremer et al. 2002). Channel activity of the protein has been reported (Pavlovic et al. 2003; Premkumar et al. 2004; Chew et al. 2009; Griffin et al.; 2003; Clarke et al. 2006), as well as the effect of potential drugs on its channel activity (Pavlovic et al. 2003; Premkumar et al. 2004; Griffin et al. 2003; Steinmann et al. 2007a). The role of the protein within the infectivity cycle is proposed to be similar to M2 of influenza A in alternating the pH gradient across lipid membranes (Griffin 2009).",

Detailed NMR experiments identify TMD1 consisting of two helical parts including the first 15 residues (Cook & Opella 2011; Montserret et al. 2010), as well as TMD2 (Cook & Opella 2011). The oligomeric state of p7 is suggested to be hexameric based on electron microscopic data (Griffin et al. 2003; Luik et al. 2009), with a potential to form heptameric assemblies as well (Clarke et al. 2006). It is most likely, that there is a strong strain specific aspect to assembly and drug sensitivity (StGelais et al. 2009). In a NMR spectroscopic study an all atom hexameric bundle structure is reported for the first time (OuYang et al. 2013). Computational methods have been done to generate a hexamer (Patargias et al. 2006). Conductance studies with liposome based essays of a set of mutant p7 reveal a concerted action of all structural elements (StGelais et al. 2007). The TMDs and the basic loop are important for the proper functioning of the channel.",

The root mean square deviation (RMSD) values of the C\u03b1 atoms of all TMDs investigated, level off after a short rise within the first few nanoseconds (Figure 1A). The RMSF calculations reveal a w-like pattern for all TMDs (Figure 1B, I \u2013 III). At the N-termini of wild type TMD1 and TMD2, RMSF values are higher than at the C-termini (Figure 1B, I). In TMD1, Ser-21 and Phe-22 exhibit maximal RMSF values. Large fluctuations are found for a Gly-46/Met-47/Trp-48 motif of TMD2. Residues within the head group region and at the interface of the hydrophobic core of the membrane hardly fluctuate. RMSF values for TMD11-32 identify a maximum fluctuation for residue Ala-14 and smaller fluctuations for residues Val-6 and Ile-7 (Figure 1B, III).",

Mutating an additional tyrosine into the N terminal side of TMD2 (TM2-F44Y) results in an increased interaction of the tyrosines with the phospholipid head group region and leads to penetration of water molecules into this region. These dynamics are not observed for TMD2-Y42/45S and TMD2-Y42/45F (Figure 2B, II and III). TMD11-32 adopts a strong bend structure with a complex kink/bend motif starting from Ala-14 towards the N terminal side (Figure 2D). The motif is driven by integration of the N terminal side into the phospholipid head group region. During the 100 ns simulation, a \u2018groove\u2019 develops, in which the backbone is exposed to the environment due to accumulation of alanines and a glycine at one side of the helix (Figure 2D, lower two panels, highlighted with a bend bar).",

In the presence of the loop (ML), amantadine also poses at the site of the loop (Figure 5B). With ML, amantadine forms hydrogen bonds with the backbone carbonyls of residues from TMD1 (Cys-27, Tyr-31, Leu-32 (structure at 0 ns) and Leu-32, Lys-33 (structure at 150 ns). The best pose of binding of rimantadine with MNL is identified to be via its amino group, with the backbone carbonyl of either Trp-48 (0 ns structure) or the hydroxyl group of the side chain of Ser-12 (150 ns structure) (data not shown). The best pose for rimantadine in ML is with the backbone of Phe-26, which is within the TMD (structure at 0 ns) and the backbone of Trp-36, which is within the loop of the structure at 150 ns (Figure 5C). The second best pose with the 150 ns structure is found to be towards the C-terminal side of TMD2. In all cases, the binding affinities for amantadine and rimantadine are in the range of \u221210 kJ/mol to 0 kJ/mol (Table 2). For amantadine docked to MNL, the order reverses position 2 and 3 for rimantadine (0 and 150 ns structure). For amantadine docked to ML, the order reverses for the structure at 0 ns. At this second site (first in respect to HYDE), the interaction is driven by hydrogen bonding of the amino group of amantadine with the backbone carbonyls of His-17 and the hydroxyl group in the side chain of Ser-12 (data not shown). For the ML structure at 150 ns with rimantadine, the third pose becomes the best one when recalculating the energies with HYDE. In this pose, hydrogen binding of the amino group of rimantadine with the carbonyl backbone of Tyr-33 together with hydrophobic interactions between adamantan and the aromatic rings of Tyr-42 and \u221245 (data not shown) is found.",

Backbone carbonyls of Tyr-42, Ala-43 and Gly-46 form hydrogen bonds via the hydroxyl groups of the iminosugar moiety with the structure at 0 ns. The hydrogen bonding of Tyr-42 serves as an acceptor for two off the hydroxyl groups of the ligand. The carbonyl backbone of His-17, as well as the backbone NH groups of Gly-15 and Leu-19 both serve as hydrogen acceptors and donors, respectively, in TMD1 at 150 ns. Based on the refined calculation of the binding affinities, the best poses based on FlexX of \u22122.0/-8.2 kJ/mol (0 ns structure) and \u22120.9/-8.0 kJ/mol (150 ns structure)) become the second best for both structures, when recalculating with HYDE (\u22121.1/-21.9 kJ/mol (0 ns) and \u22120.3/-39.3 kJ/mol (150 ns)). The large values of \u221221.9 and \u221239.3 kJ/mol are due to the large number of hydrogen bonds (each hydroxyl group forms a hydrogen bond with carbonyl backbones and side chains in combinations with favorable hydrophobic interactions (data not shown). The best pose of NN-DNJ with ML is in the loop region via hydrogen bonds of the hydroxyl group with carbonyl backbone group of Phe-26 and Gly-39 in the 0 ns structure (Figure 5D). In addition, one hydroxyl group of NN-DNJ forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Arg-35. The binding affinities are calculated to be \u22127.8/-16.1 kJ/mol. In the 150 ns ML structure, a maximum of hydrogen bond partners are suggested: carbonyl backbone groups of Phe-28, Ala-29, Trp-30 and Leu-32, as well as side chain of Arg-35 for the best pose (\u22127.1/-8.9 kJ/mol). In addition to that, the aliphatic chain is surrounded by hydrophobic side chains of Ala-29 and Tyr-31. Refined calculations put the second pose into the first rank (\u22124.1/-14.6 kJ/mol). Similarly, in this pose, hydrogen bonds are formed with the backbone carbonyls of Gly-34 and Try-36. The aliphatic tail is embedded into a hydrophobic pocket of Leu-32, Lys-33, Gly-34 and Trp-36 (data not shown). NN-DNJ is the only ligand which interacts with carbonyl backbones of the residues of TMD11-32 (150 ns structure) closer to the N terminal side: Ala-10, -11 and Gly-15.

There is consensus among the two simulations in as much as the weakly fluctuating Ser-21/Phe-22 of the shorter TMD110-32 is mobile in simulations of TMD11-32. Due to the extended helix which remains in the motif during 100 ns MD simulations, the most flexible part is moved one helical turn further towards the N terminal side, spiking around Ala-14.

The kink angle is increased when mutating the hydrophobic residue Phe-44 into tyrosine. The increase of the kink occurs due to the \u2018snorkeling\u2019 of the tyrosines for the hydrophilic head group region and the aqueous phase. The snorkeling effect (usually used in context with lysines (Strandberg & Killian 2003)), is accompanied by a further insertion of the rest of the part of the helix which is directed towards the other leaflet into the hydrophobic part of the membrane. Removing the hydroxy groups, as in TM2-Y42/45F, reduces the snorkeling and with it the kink and tilt. Smaller hydrophilic residues, such as serines, do not have a big impact on either the kink or the tilt angle of the helix. Serine rather forms hydrogen bonds with the backbone to compensate unfavorable interactions with the hydrophobic environment of the lipid membrane, than to interact with the lipid head groups and water molecules (after a while). It is concluded, that hydrophilic residues, accumulated on one side of a TM helix, lead to attract water molecules to compensate for hydrogen bonding and charges, and a tearing further into the hydrophobic core region of its other side. The consequence is a considerable kink or bend of the helix. In the monomer, the bending of TMD2 is preserved, when running the monomer with a linker.",

The w-shaped RMSF plots, calculated from MD simulations of the individual helices, support the experimental results of 4 segments separated by higher fluctuating residues (Figure 1B, I).

The separating residues in TMD2 are conserved in the simulations of the monomer with and without loop (Figure 3B). Simulations of the monomer with loop reveals fluctuations around Pro-38 within the N-terminal part of TMD2. This is similar to high fluctuations found in the simulations of MNL indicating higher mobility of this segment in accordance with the NMR findings.

The structural models of the individual TMDs have been subject of protein-protein docking using GRAMM program (Tovchigrechko & Vakser 2006) to generate a monomer. The assembled TMDs have consequently been linked by four amino acids modeling a hairpin motive using VMD software. The spectra support the motif of two helical segments towards the N-terminal side and a shorter helix at the C-terminal side followed by a mobile segment. Both of the sections are separated by a hairpin like motif. The computational model of the monomer has been run for 40 ns MD simulation (NAMD, CHARMM27) in a fully hydrated lipid bilayer.

Bilayer recording data report on a blockage of p7 by NN-DNJ which is more effective than blockage by amantadine and rimantadine (Steinmann et al. 2007b). Also, strain specific tests in cell culture reveal activity of these compounds (Griffin et al. 2008). Resistant mutations, observed upon adminstration of the two typs of drugs affect residues (i) Leu-20 (into L20F) induced by adamantanes and (ii) Phe-25 (into F25A) induced by iminosugars (Foster et al. 2011). These sites are within TMD1. Application of a docking approach using Autodock, on a heptameric bundle and a monomer, support a potential binding site within the TM region of p7. The poly leusine motif (Leu-50 to Leu-55) has been identified to be sensitive to amantadine (Cook & Opella 2010). In the present docking study, the site for amantadine interaction with p7 does not match these experimental findings (Cook & Opella 2010; StGelais et al. 2009; Griffin et al. 2008).",

In case of the iminosugars, this site in the loop region is possibly less favorable than for BIT225, even though a number of hydrogen bonds can be formed. The disfavor may be because of the aliphatic chain of NN-DNJ, which has to cope with the unfavorable position. The chain could interact with hydrophobic pockets in the protein, though this comes with some entropic costs. For amantadine and rimantadines, the same situation may hold with some minor advantages in as much as the hydrophobic part of these molecules may not get many restrictions in conformational flexibility upon binding. In contrast to e.g. NN-DNJ, amantadine and rimantadine can form fewer numbers of hydrogen bonds, what then compensates the entropic costs arising for NN-DNJ upon binding. BIT225 seems as the most favorable molecule, in respect of entropic costs. Experiments with mutants in this region would be necessary to proof the proposed mechanism of binding. What do the results mean for a potential drug? The potent drug should interact with sensitive amino acids, preferentially with its backbone, in the loop region.",

Binding of any drug via interacting with the backbone of the protein would hamper the dynamics of the loop and with it, possibly, the free energy involved in the mechanism of function. In the specific case of BIT225, the interaction is indeed identified to be with the backbone of the highly important residues Arg-35.
