HH patients are not always on hepatology wards, which may complicate its recognition. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no report of HH in patients infected with A(H7N9) or any other type of avian influenza virus. However, the overall in-hospital mortality rate of HH can be as high as 45%\u201372% due to accompanying multiple organ failure (MOF).10,11,12,13 Because of this high mortality rate, early diagnosis and treatment of HH are necessary to ensure a good outcome.11",

However, severe liver impairment (ALT > 20-fold the ULN) was rare (n = 2, 1.8%). The distinct difference between the extent of elevated ALT between HH patients and non-HH patients with liver impairment indicated that HH could be differentiated from other types of liver injury by means of a sharp elevation in the ALT level. The majority of A(H7N9)-infected patients are treated with antiviral medications, antibiotics and steroids, which are potentially hepatotoxic.17,18,19,20 There are also reports of liver impairment induced by respiratory viruses, such as severe adult respiratory syndrome coronary virus (SARS-CoV).17 Hence, it is meaningful to identify the cause of liver injury, especially in cases of severe liver impairment.",

In case 1, coronary artery disease that chronically reduced blood flow, and hence oxygen supply, to the liver was found in both HH cases. In case 2, chronic pulmonary dysfunction decreased blood oxygen saturation, which led to an insufficient baseline oxygen supply to the liver. In addition, temporary left ventricular failure and respiratory failure decreased the oxygen supply to the liver. Temporary left ventricular failure was suspected due to myocarditis. The CK, TNI and ECG results supported this speculation. In another temporary left ventricular failure patient with A(H7N9) infection, typical myocarditis histological changes, such as cluster lymphocyte infiltration, were found in post-mortem heart tissue. Cardiac dysfunction was confirmed on cardiogram by the decrease in LVEF to 42% and 37.5% in the two patients on admission. In case 1, the detection of dilated intrahepatic veins by abdominal ultrasound (Figure 1B) and a prolonged history of coronary disease with two intracoronary stent implantation procedures suggested chronic right ventricular failure. During hospitalization, these two patients required persistent intravenous norepinephrine transfusion to maintain diastolic blood pressure. This clearly indicated circulatory failure, which would also reduce oxygen supply to the liver. The reduction in oxygen supply caused by respiratory failure was ameliorated in the ICU. The peak ALT and AST levels occurred on the day of admission or the following day in this study, which is in accordance with the report of Raurich et al.12",
