In the United States, approximately 90% of all children develop an episode of OME before they reach school age, mainly between the ages of 4 months and 6 years [2]. The presence of OME is associated with severe negative impact on child development, including hearing loss with long-term consequences for speech and language acquisition, poor school performance, and imbalance issues [1\u20133]. Moreover, children with OME are five times more susceptible to develop acute otitis media than controls [4, 5].",

            "text": "Mechanical obstruction of the Eustachian tube is one of the main identifiable causes of Eustachian tube dysfunction, especially due to adenoid hypertrophy (AH) in the pediatric age. The presence of AH can obstruct the nasopharyngeal ostium of the Eustachian tube, leading to negative pressure in the middle ear cavity, and eventually mucosal transudation [10]. Indeed, AH is a frequent condition observed in patients with OME [7\u20139, 11]. In children with AH and OME, the surgical removal of the adenoid (associated with ventilation tube insertion) accelerates the recovery of the middle ear mucosa, decrease the risk of recurrence and need of repetitive surgical procedures, and reduce treatment failure rate. However, new evidence point out that the benefits of adenoidectomy in children with OME older than 4 years-old is independently of the adenoid size [12], suggesting that the removal of a local reservoir of pathogenic microbiota (viruses, planktonic bacteria, and biofilms) is the key for such benefits [13\u201315]. Despite some studies have evaluated the microbial colonization of adenoid and middle ear, no studies have thoroughly studied the association of respiratory pathogenic microbiota between these two niches. Therefore, the present study was carried out to compare the detection of common respiratory viruses and bacteria in adenoids and middle ear fluid in children with OME and in controls.",

All patients were evaluated by otoscopy, audiometry, tympanometry, and nasal endoscopy. OME was diagnosed by medical history suggesting persistence of middle ear fluid for more than 3 months without acute signs of inflammation, confirmed by the presence of tympanic membrane opacity, retraction, or air-liquid interface, and by a type B tympanogram and/or conductive hearing loss. AH was defined at nasal endoscopy by the presence of adenoid in contact with the torus tubaris (grade 3) and/or vomer (grade 4) [18, 19]. Exclusion criteria were: prior surgical procedures in the upper airways, including tympanostomy for tube placement; use of antibiotics or symptoms of respiratory infection within the last month; history of recurrent acute otitis media or recurrent upper airways infection; tympanic membrane perforation, or the presence of genetic syndromes, such as Down syndrome.

The higher overall frequency of bacteria detection in MEWs from OME patients was expected, since the accumulation of middle ear effusion favors growing of bacterial elements that may have been suctioned through the tube from the nasopharyngeal microbiota. Moreover, these bacteria may play roles as chronic inflammatory stimuli to the mucosa of the middle ear and contribute to the dysfunction of Eustachian tube. There was little or no concordance of the microbe detected in the adenoid and the middle ear, both in patients with OME as well as in controls. This finding is in agreement with a previous report that performed 16S rDNA pyrosequencing of both niches, showing that the adenoid microbiota was more diverse and complex than of the middle ear in a child with OME [27]. As the adenoid is exposed to the nasal and oral microbial contents, differently from the enclosed cavity of the middle ear, this makes the adenoid more susceptible to be colonized by a higher load and more variety of microorganisms. It is generally accepted that the development of negative pressure within the middle ear cavity suctions microbial components of the nasopharyngeal microbiota but, at present, there is no enough data to rule out the establishment of a selected microbiome especial to the middle ear cavity.",

However, the simultaneous presence of HAdV and S. pneumoniae in adenoid tissue could be independent observations, due to the high frequencies of both microorganisms in the adenoid.",

Considering that S. pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis are the most frequent pathogens detected in acute otitis media [6], and are able to ascend through the Eustachian tube [32], causing ciliary damage to the airway epithelium and disrupting mucociliary flow, this may result in conditions for persistence in the middle ear compartment [33\u201336]. In some cases, especially when OME is not clearly related to a mechanical obstruction of the Eustachian tube, the Toynbee effect of negative pressure within the middle ear may help ascendance of microbes through the tube, leading to colonization of the middle ear, which may be pivotal in OME pathogenesis.",

In OME, there has been evidence that the presence of middle ear fluid is associated to formation of biofilm in the middle ear, and that these biofilms are related to the local inflammation [9, 24]. In conventional, culture-based microbiology, detection of these microorganisms is not always possible, and the use of sensitive molecular methods, such as real-time PCR, enables detection of multiple microbes in complex niches like the middle ear. Although PCR cannot distinguish viable from dead microbes, the specificity of the primers coupled with careful sampling technique in order to minimize cross-contamination between sampling sites, ensure that the microorganisms were indeed present in the middle ear.",

The airway mucosa affected by viral infection becomes more susceptible to bacterial adherence and mucosal inflammation [30, 43, 44]. Therefore, associations of viruses and bacteria could be acting in concert to modify the course of the OME.

Through a minimally invasive method (MEW) and a very sensitive procedure (real time PCR), we were able to compare samples of healthy children with those of children with OME. In the light of that result, the findings of some potentially pathogenic bacteria in the middle ear of patients undergoing cochlear implant suggests that their presence in the middle ear is independent of biofilm formation.
