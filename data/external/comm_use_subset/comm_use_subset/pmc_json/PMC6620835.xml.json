            "text": "All amino acids, except for methionine (Met) and tryptophan (Trp), are coded by more than one synonymous codon in the organism. The phenomenon that alternative synonymous codons do not occur equally is referred to as codon usage bias and this is a process of long-term accumulation. As an important evolutionary phenomenon, it is well known that synonymous codon usage bias exists in a wide range of species from prokaryotes to eukaryotes [1]. Compositional constraints and natural selection are thought to be two main factors influencing codon usage variation among the gene in different organisms [2, 3]. Flaviviridae viruses are single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses, which threat human constantly mediated by mosquitoes, ticks, and sandflies, such as Zika virus, Dengue virus, Yellow fever virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and other viruses. Because their hosts are from the vertebrates and invertebrate, most of Flaviviridae viruses are related to some human diseases. For example, Dengue virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and Zika virus are mediated by mosquitoes. Dengue virus contains four serotypes (DENV1 to DENV4) and its infection may cause symptoms from mild dengue fever to dengue hemorrhagic fever, even dengue shock syndrome [4] and stabilizing selection acts on the codon usage bias [5]. Spread of the Japanese encephalitis virus, reported from WHO, produced a total of 27, 059 patients during 2006~2009, out of which 86% were from China and India, 20~30% were caused to be fatal and 30~50% of the survivors were found to cause serious postinfection neurological sequelae and Japanese encephalitis virus has low codon usages bias influenced by both mutational pressure and natural selection [6]. Zika virus producing a number of microcephaly in Brazil is rapidly spreading to other parts of the world since 2015. Zika coding sequences have relatively conserved and genotype-specific evolution of codon usage bias [7]. Powassan virus, yellow fever virus, and spondweni virus are mediated by ticks. Powassan virus is a fatal, neurotropic virus, with a 671% rise in cases in the last 18 years, which has become an emerging danger worldwide [8]. Yellow fever virus can cause yellow fever which is endemic in many African and South American countries [9]. Spondweni virus can cause a self-limiting febrile illness characterized by headache, myalgia, nausea, and arthralgia similar to Zika virus infections [10]. Codon usage patterns of some members from the Flaviviridae viruses have been studied, such as Zika virus [7] and Dengue virus [5]. But the population codon usage characteristics of all Flaviviridae viruses have not been reported by now. Considering the recent increase in the prevalence of the family virus and its risk potential, we investigated the codon usage pattern to understand its evolutionary processes and provide some useful data to develop the medications for Flaviviridae viruses.",

As ENC-GC3S plots analysis shows, mutational pressure and other factors shaped the codon usage patterns of Flaviviridae viruses, which is similar to hepatitis C virus [22]. In fact, Hongju et al. have previously reported that the codon usage bias of ZIKV is weak and the influencing factors of the patterns are not only mutation pressure, but also translational selection, aromaticity, and hydrophobicity [14]. Although in previous studies [14, 23] on Zika virus, it is observed there were greater frequencies of A3S/G3S than U3S. There were some viruses showing contrary characteristics; for example, Aedes flavivirus U3S% was 0.2994 and G3S% was 0.279; Alkhurma virus U3S was % 0.3617 and G3S% was 0.2773. By comprehensive analysis of all results, it can be found that overall U3S% was more and G3S% was lowest. Since Flaviviridae viruses prefer A/U-ended codons and A3S% has a remarkable correlation with ENC (Table 3), we think that compositional constraint shaping the synonymous codon bias was from the content of nucleotides A and U on the third codon position. This result was different from many reports in which compositional constraints influencing codon usage bias are from G and C contents (Zhou et al. 2004) [20, 24]. In addition, it can be found that the correlations of both Gravy values and Aroma values with ENC values are significant, which indicates the role of natural selection in shaping the codon usage patterns of the Flaviviridae viruses [6]. Besides, the codon usage patterns of this family were influenced by nature selection which dominates 93.8% and mutation pressure which dominates 6.2% (Figure 4).",
