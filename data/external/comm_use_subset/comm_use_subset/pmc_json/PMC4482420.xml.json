One of these is an enzyme, \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase or GGT (EC 2.3.2.2) which is expressed in all H. pylori strains [4,5]. GGT has been implicated in various host cell damaging effects including induction of apoptosis [6], upregulation of cyclooxygenase-2 in human gastric cells [7], inhibiting T cell proliferation [8] and generating H2O2 leading to DNA damage [9]. The enzyme is first synthesized as a pro-enzyme (~60 kDa) before being subsequently processed to give a large (~37 kDa) and a small (~20 kDa) subunit. The large and small subunits then associate to form the active enzyme [4]. Biochemically, GGT catalyzes reactions in which a \u03b3-glutamyl moiety is transferred from \u03b3-glutamyl compounds, such as glutathione, to amino acids (transpeptidation) or water (hydrolysis).",

            "text": "One of the virulence processes of H. pylori is that it causes cytoplasmic vacuole formation in cells in vitro [10] and in vivo [11]. The process has been attributed to a well-studied secreted virulence factor, vacuolating cytotoxin (VacA) and the phenomenon is dependent on the presence of permeant weak bases such as ammonia [12] in the extracellular medium. A current model of the vacuolation process involves VacA being internalized into the endosomal compartment by endocytosis [13] and altering V-ATPase activity [14], thereby leading to an increased influx of H+ into the endosome. This then leads to an accumulation of ammonium ions and subsequent water influx into the endosomal lumen, giving rise to the osmotic swelling of late endosomes which results in the formation of massive vacuoles, both in number and size [15]. A major source of ammonia required for vacuolation is reported to come from the hydrolysis of urea by urease [16,17]. Akin to urease, GGT is also known to generate ammonia by hydrolyzing glutamine [18,19], an amino acid that is abundant in plasma [20]. Hence, it was of great interest to investigate if GGT also contributes to the vacuolation process.",

Of the four MAbs, three of them (1G1, 4F11 and 3F4) significantly inhibited vacuolation (P<0.05) as shown in Fig 6A. Their ability to inhibit vacuolation generally coincided with their potency in neutralizing GGT activity. As a control, mouse IgG2a and IgG2b isotype negative controls failed to inhibit vacuolation. Similarly, in the presence of SBC, a competitive GGT inhibitor [28], vacuolation induction by WT in AGS cells was significantly decreased (P<0.05) while the level of vacuolation remained unchanged in \u0394ggt-treated cells (Fig 6B). The effect of SBC in inhibiting vacuolation was also observed to be dose-dependent but required a minimum concentration of 8mM SBC to be effective. This further indicates that vacuolation induced by H. pylori is greatly dependent on GGT activity.",

However, our results indicate that it is not the only factor contributing to the generation of ammonia required for vacuolation as \u0394ureAB was still able to induce a significant amount (P<0.05) of vacuolation in AGS cells (Fig 4). This agrees with a previous report whereby vacuolation induced in Sfl Ep cells by broth-culture filtrates from a urease-isogenic mutant did not differ significantly to that induced by the parental strain in the absence of urea [32]. In the same report, it was also found that a large portion of ammonia in the broth filtrates was a urease-independent metabolic product of the bacteria, indicating that there are other bacterial factors responsible for the production of ammonia essential for vacuolation induction. In this study, we show that neutral red uptake induced by \u0394ggt was significantly lesser than that induced by \u0394ureAB (where GGT is still present), emphasizing that GGT is the other important ammonia-generating factor alongside urease under the tested culture conditions. Taken together, the results from this study strongly affirm that although GGT does not have intrinsic vacuolating activity, it plays an important role alongside VacA and urease in inducing vacuolation in gastric epithelial cells.",

In this study, we have shown that H. pylori GGT plays an important role in contributing to VacA-induced vacuolation. Vacuolation in biopsies from H. pylori-infected individuals has been frequently reported by many groups [34\u201338]. Importantly, we have also shown in this study that prominent vacuolation was observed in primary gastric epithelial cells upon H. pylori infection, indicating that H. pylori is able to induce vacuolation in these cells. However, it is noted that the extent of vacuolation in vivo may not be as prominent as that observed in vitro which may be due to several factors such as differences in concentrations of VacA in vivo and in the detectability of it in epithelial cells contained within an intact mucosal surface as opposed to flattened, adherent cells of a monolayer [39].",

This is a novel pathogenic effect of GGT which has hitherto not been reported and hence could be another reason as to why H. pylori with higher GGT activity is associated with more severe gastroduodenal diseases as was previously reported [9]. The fact that ggt gene is present in all H. pylori isolates [4,5,9] further illustrates the vital role of this enzyme in potentiating virulence. Intriguingly, it has been reported that other VacA activities such as induction of apoptosis and epithelial permeability can be potentiated by ammonia [17,40], thus raising the possibility that these activities may also be potentiated by GGT-produced ammonia and would certainly be an interesting area to explore. Taken together, our findings provide a new perspective on GGT as a potent virulence factor and a potential target in the management of H. pylori-associated infections.",
