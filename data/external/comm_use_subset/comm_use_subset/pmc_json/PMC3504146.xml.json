S cleavage into S1 and S2 subunits by either extracellular proteases [12] or the pH-sensitive endosomal protease cathepsin-L [13] is a prerequisite for its fusogenicity. This cleavage triggers the release of a hydrophobic fusion peptide at the N-terminal end of the S2 subunit, which inserts itself into host membranes, placing viral and cellular membranes at close proximity. S conformational changes lead to the fusion of the viral envelope with cellular membranes. Membrane destabilization by the S juxtamembrane domain, localized in the ectodomain, as well as clusters of palmitoylated cysteines, found within the membrane-proximal half of the S endodomain, may facilitate the fusion process [14], [15].",

Hence, they mediate a fine-tuned linkage that strengthen the cell cortex, partition membrane clusters, and regulate signal transduction pathways [20].

Analysis of the SARS-CoV S endodomain sequence revealed three regions with distinctive characteristics: a carboxy-terminal basic region (amino-acids 1248\u20131254), a central acidic stretch (amino-acids 1239\u20131244) and a series of clusters of cysteine residues (amino-acids 1217\u20131236). We reasoned that these regions could be involved in the interaction with ezrin. First, we constructed truncation mutants by deleting the carboxy-terminal regions either containing the basic cluster or both the basic cluster and the acidic stretch. These truncation mutants consisted in deletion of eight and nineteen amino-acids, respectively (Sendo \u03948 and Sendo \u039419, Fig. 3A). As expected, glutathione-conjugated beads and GST-coupled beads could not pull down ezrin whereas beads coupled to GST-Sendo wt could precipitate ezrin efficiently from a Vero E6 cell lysate (Fig. 3B lanes 2\u20136). Both \u03948 and \u039419 truncations were able to significantly diminish interaction with ezrin at similar levels, but not abrogate it (Fig. 3B lanes 7, 8, 9, 10). These data show that the eight carboxy-terminal amino-acid stretch, which is rich in basic residues, is important for ezrin binding and that another motif in the endodomain may contribute to the interaction. Conversely, the acidic stretch does not seem involved in the interaction.",

Vero E6 epithelial cells stably expressing RFP-ezrin fusion protein were infected with GFP-Vpr SARSpp. At 30 minutes post-infection, cells were analyzed using a total internal reflection fluorescence microscope (TIRFM) to visualize events occurring at proximity of the plasma membrane and minimize background from the other layers of the cells. Green dots corresponding to GFP-Vpr SARSpp were readily observed and found associated with RFP-ezrin enriched domains (Fig. 4, white arrowheads, Supporting movie S1). This result indicates that ezrin is present at sites of SARSpp entry, possibly coating endosomes following internalization of particles. Similar data were obtained using a spinning disc confocal microscope on live cells expressing RFP-ezrin (data not shown). This would suggest that after the formation of the fusion pore, S endodomains facing the host cell cytosol have the possibility to interact with ezrin molecules.",

The ezrin siRNA transfection decreased expression significantly, with a quantified 80% knock down at the protein level (Fig. 5A). Ezrin siRNA was shown to slightly increase transduction levels by \u0394envpp and VSVGpp (around 3- and 5-fold increases, respectively) (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, the highest fold-change observed was for SARSpp where S-mediated entry was enhanced more than 12-fold. These data indicate that ezrin expression silencing has a slight enhancing effect on entry of viral particles uptake in general, as well as a more specific highly increasing effect on entry of SARS-CoV S pseudotyped particles. This suggests a negative regulatory role for ezrin in SARS-CoV S-mediated entry.",

The mutated SARS S pseudotyped particles were designed by taking into account the biochemical pull-down data we have established (Fig. 3). To completely abolish ezrin interaction, we constructed a S mutant with cysteine to alanine mutations of the first cysteine cluster and with a deletion of the last 8 amino acids (S\u03948 C1). Considering that the C1 mutation could have severe consequences on fusion [14], we also generated a second S mutant with only a deletion of the 8 last amino acids of the C-terminus (S\u03948), a modification which should partially alter interaction with ezrin. S\u03948 and S\u03948 C1 S proteins could be incorporated into lentiviral particles (Fig. 6A, upper panel) and similar amounts of particles were found in concentrated supernatants, as indicated by detection of the HIV p24 protein (Fig. 6A, lower panel). Levels of incorporation of wt S, S\u03948 and S\u03948 C1 were quantified by densitometry and normalized to p24 levels. The ratio of S incorporation was 1 \u2236 2.5 \u2236 3.9 for wt S, S\u03948 and S\u03948 C1, respectively. Entry of mutated S pseudotyped particles along with wt S SARSpp was analyzed in SARS-CoV-susceptible Vero E6 cells (Fig. 6B). Both mutated SARSpp were found to transduce Vero E6 cells more efficiently than wt S SARSpp. Although mutation of C1 is expected to induce a defect in fusion [14], a 2-fold increase in transduction was measured for S\u03948 C1 SARSpp. This increase can be explained by both the efficient incorporation of S\u03948 C1 in pseudotyped particles and the lack of interaction with ezrin. Interestingly, significantly higher levels of transduction were observed for the S\u03948 SARSpp, with an increase of transduction of approximately 11-fold compared to wt S SARSpp. This result is in agreement with previously published data where murine leukemia virus (MLV)-based S\u03948 SARSpp were found to transduce Vero cells more efficiently than wt S pseudotyped particles [19]. In our study, better incorporation of S\u03948 could be in part responsible for the increase of transduction. However, the difference in fold-change that was observed for S\u03948 incorporation into pseudoparticles and cellular transduction (2-fold compared to 11-fold increase, respectively) suggests that partial disruption of interaction with ezrin contributes to this enhancement of transduction. Taken together, these data are in agreement with the hypothesis that ezrin binding to S endodomain decreases entry of viral particles.",

The latter form of ezrin is known to have a dominant negative effect on endogenous ezrin [26].

To characterize further this phenomenon, we questioned whether ezrin could be involved in the S-mediated fusion process, during which S endodomains become accessible to the cytosol. To that end, we chose to study the effect of expression of the FERM domain of ezrin on S-dependent fusogenicity in an in vitro cell-cell fusion assay. In this experiment, HeLa cells stably expressing both S and a HcRed fluorescent marker (HeLa HcRed Spike) were co-incubated with GFP, GFP-ezrinwt or GFP-ezrinFERM Vero E6 stable cell lines. As expected, control HeLa HcRed cells were not able to fuse with any of the three Vero E6 cell lines, as no syncytia were found (Fig. 9A panels a to c). Similarly, no syncytia were observed for HeLa HcRed Spike cells incubated with Vero E6 stable cell lines but not activated by trypsin treatment (Fig. 9A panels d, f and h). Conversely, about 4.5% of nuclei were found in syncytia when HeLa HcRed Spike cells were incubated in presence of either GFP or GFP-ezrinwt Vero E6 cells after trypsin activation (Fig. 9A panels e and g and Fig. 9B). Interestingly, 8% of nuclei were found to be in syncytia in the condition where HeLa HcRed Spike cells were co-cultured with GFP-ezrinFERM cells after trypsin activation (Fig. 9A panel i and Fig. 9B). This 2-fold increase of fusion, linked to expression of GFP-ezrinFERM in target cells, was consistently found in four independent experiments. This result shows that target cells expressing the FERM domain of ezrin are more susceptible to S-dependent cell-cell fusion and further indicates that ezrin plays a restrictive role during SARS-CoV S-dependent fusion process.",

FERM lobes of a number of FERM-domain containing proteins have been described as mediating specific interactions with proteins or phospholipids at the plasma membrane. For example, a region located between the F1 and F3 lobes is the site where inositol-(1,4,5)-triphosphate (IP3) interacts with the FERM domain of radixin [40]. Moreover, crystallographic data have shown that sites within the F3 lobe of radixin are the binding regions of CD44 cytoplasmic region [41] and ICAM-2 [42].

Furthermore, it was shown recently that ezrin, radixin, and moesin play differential roles in the life cycle of HIV-1, with some reports demonstrating that ERMs may negatively regulate post-entry events by affecting stable microtubules, and others that show ezrin and moesin as important for entry events of the virus [29]\u2013[32].

Attempts of coimmunoprecipitation using full length SARS-CoV S and ezrin have not been successful. Difficulty to coimmunoprecipitate ERM proteins in our and others' studies could be due to the low proportion of activated proteins in cells, which, moreover, interact with actin and are therefore insoluble. GST-pull down assays using a series of GST-S endodomain mutants demonstrated that residues in the last 8 amino-acids as well as cysteines (particularly the juxtamembrane-most first cluster C1) were important determinants for binding with ezrin (Fig. 3). The positively charged amino-acids found in the very last 8 amino-acids contain a KxHxx dibasic motif that was shown to function as an ER retrieval signal [44], [45]. The positively charged amino-acids were of particular interest in our study as ERM proteins have been shown to interact with the C-terminal tails of transmembrane protein that contain juxtamembrane stretches of positively charged amino-acids [46]. The finding that the C1 cluster of S endodomain is also involved in ezrin binding in vitro is intriguing. Cysteine residues are highly conserved among coronaviral Spike proteins. SARS-CoV S cysteines are known to be palmitoylated and important for S association with detergent-insoluble cellular fractions and S-dependent cell-cell fusion [14], [16]. It could be argued that the GST-Sendo proteins, which have been purified from bacteria in our study, may not reflect the palmitoylation state of S. Whether a small fraction of S C1 clusters is not palmitoylated and free to interact with ezrin in vivo would need further investigation.",

Although recruitment of ezrin around endosomal membranes may not be specific to SARS particles' internalization, our result suggests that ezrin is present at the SARS-CoV fusion site. It is therefore plausible that following initiation of the pore opening, ezrin molecules come into contact with some newly accessible S endodomains. Topologically, an interaction between ezrin and S endodomains requires that the fusion pore be open. Knowing the function of ezrin in regulation of membrane fluidity, one could expect that ezrin modulates the efficacy of fusion at a step following the opening of the pore.",

Our results also show that silencing ezrin expression enhances, to a lower extent, entry of pseudotyped particles with no envelope or VSV G. A slight \u223c2-fold increase in entry levels for HIV-gp-pseudotyped particles has also been observed (Supporting Fig. S1). No significant increase has been detected for influenza virus HA-pseudotyped particles. These enhancements have consistently been found to be lower than the one found for SARS-CoV S-mediated entry. The moderate enhancement effect of ezrin depletion by siRNA treatment on VSV G and HIV-gp pseudotyped particles suggests that ezrin may also have a general restricting effect on viral entry. Ezrin is a scaffolding protein that links actin cytoskeleton and cholesterol-rich lipid domains at the plasma membrane. It contributes to membrane structure and organization. First, ezrin provides rigidity to specific cortical areas of the cell by linking membranes to cortical actin. For instance, ezrin is important for extensions of lamellipodia and filopodia [47], [48]. Second, ezrin enables the organization of membrane microdomains by controlling fluidity of membrane components. This process is extremely important in the regulation of signalization by trans-membrane receptors and signaling molecules [49]\u2013[51]. Moreover, ezrin enables the compartmentalization of signaling molecules into microclusters and prevents their free movement to restrict signaling. This has been well described for the B and T cell receptors [50], [52]. Therefore, it is possible that the membrane rigidity induced by ezrin limits viral entry in general, with a more important effect on SARS-CoV S-mediated entry, due to the specific interaction with S.",

This finding further supports the notion that ezrin's interaction with S negatively modulates entry, although we may not exclude the possibility that higher S incorporation observed in the case of S\u03948 SARSpp also contributes in increasing viral entry. Effects of truncations of S endodomain have been analyzed in several independent studies. Petit et al. have shown that a truncated S lacking the 8 C-terminal amino-acids, named T1247 in their study, was less efficient in mediating S-driven cell-cell fusion than wt S (34.01% of wt S) [17]. This was explained by an altered surface expression of S T1247 (79.15% of wt S). In another study by Giroglou et al., although low cell surface expression of S\u03948 was also documented in 293T cells, S\u03948 SARS-MLV pseudotyped particles could be produced and could transduce Vero cells \u223c10-fold more than wt S SARS-MLVpp [19]. In addition, deletion of the last C-terminal 17 amino acids increased S-mediated cell-cell fusion [17] and S\u039419 mutants were shown to be efficiently expressed at the cell surface of 293T pseudotyped particles producer cells and induced a 100-fold increase in transduction of Vero cells [19]. A study by Moore et al. has shown that a S protein variant with a deletion of the last C-terminal 27 amino-acids and addition of the eight most membrane-proximal residues of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein cytoplasmic domain (S-H2 in this study) induces better cell surface expression, incorporation into simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) pseudotyped particles and capacity to mediate transduction by SIVpp than wt S [18]. The authors concluded that the greater efficiency of transduction of S-H2 pseudotyped particles compared to wt S SARS-SIVpp was likely due to preferential incorporation of S-H2. Further truncations altering cysteine residues have resulted in decreased transduction levels [18], [19] and deficiencies in cell-cell fusion [14]. Interestingly, in our study we found that S\u03948 C1 SARSpp could transduce slightly more potently Vero E6 cells than wt S SARSpp (Fig. 6). We have shown that S\u03948 C1 can no longer bind ezrin in vitro (Fig. 3). S\u03948 C1 was better incorporated into HIVpp than wt S (3.9-fold difference). The higher incorporation level could be partly responsible for the enhancement of transduction. However, the contribution of the absence of ezrin binding cannot be excluded in the observed enhancement of S\u03948 C1 SARSpp entry. Our work indicates that, in addition to the levels of S incorporation into pseudotyped particles and S fusogenicity, binding to ezrin may also contribute to modulate the efficiency of S-mediated entry.",

When the FERM domain of ezrin was expressed, cell susceptibility to infection was enhanced with either SARS-CoV or SARSpp (Fig. 7 and 8), further indicating that ezrin's restricting role on SARS-CoV infection takes place at the entry step. We speculate that ezrin acts at the fusion stage, as cells expressing GFP-ezrinFERM were twice more susceptible to fuse with S-expressing HeLa cells than GFP or GFP-ezrinwt Vero E6 cells (Fig. 9). Interestingly, in these experiments expression of GFP-ezrinwt did not inhibit infection or fusion. As ezrin is naturally abundantly expressed in the cells used in this study, moderate expression of GFP-ezrinwt has no effect simply because it does not change massively the overall cellular content of ezrin. In other experiments, we have observed that significant overexpression of GFP-ezrinwt was able to enhance SARSpp transduction (data not shown). We speculate that massive overexpression of GFP-ezrinwt has consequences on ezrin functions in the cell that can ultimately impact SARSpp entry. The use the dominant negative FERM domain or of siRNA appears to be more relevant to study the role of ezrin.",

Alternatively, cell fitness may be affected in FERM expressing cells, affecting virus replication rate. We have investigated the potential involvement of ezrin on viral release using the SARS S, M, N and E-containing virus-like (VLP) particle system developed in the laboratory [53]. While we could not detect ezrin at sites of VLP budding, we have found presence of ezrin in preparations of purified VLPs.

Interestingly, it was shown that the actin cytoskeleton restricts the opening of the fusion pore, and disrupting the actin network enhances fusion pore widening [55]. In light of this, it would be interesting to study ezrin's role in the fusion pore expansion induced by SARS-CoV S, considering the role of ezrin as a key actin-membrane linker and its interaction with SARS-CoV S endodomain after the fusion pore opening.",

Although direct evidence of the interaction occurring during early stages of SARS-CoV infection has yet to be demonstrated, our functional analysis reveals that ezrin has a limiting effect on SARS-CoV entry. Owing to topological constraints, we can put forward that ezrin binding to SARS-CoV S endodomain would occur during the fusion process, after the opening of the fusion pore. The findings that disruption of ezrin function enhances SARS-CoV S-dependent entry and S-mediated cell-cell fusion, would point towards a model in which ezrin scaffolds interactions with S endodomains, impose a limitation on membrane fluidity and act as a physical constraint restraining completion of fusion. The data shown here provides the basis for the establishment of a new mechanism of regulation by ezrin in the entry process of SARS-CoV.",

The SARS-CoV S cDNA encoding the endodomain amino acids 1217\u20131255 was subcloned in the pB27 vector enabling fusion of the S endodomain with the LexA binding domain and transformed in the L40 \u0394GAL4 yeast strain [65]. A human placenta random-primed cDNA library, transformed into the Y187 yeast strain and containing ten million independent fragments, was used for mating. One hundred forty seven million interactions were tested. After selection on medium lacking leucine, tryptophane, and histidine, 233 positive clones were picked. The corresponding prey fragments were amplified by PCR and sequenced at their 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 junctions. Sequences were then filtered and contiged [60] and compared to the latest release of the GenBank database using BLASTN [66]. A Predicted Biological Score was attributed to assess the reliability of the interaction, as described earlier [67].",
