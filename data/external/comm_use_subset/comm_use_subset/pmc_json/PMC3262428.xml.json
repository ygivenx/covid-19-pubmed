For example, we may observe the date of symptoms onset of a case, but we rarely know where, when and by whom a case was infected. Inference, therefore, requires integrating over \u2018missing data\u2019, which may quickly become cumbersome. Over the last 15 years, data augmentation methods have been used to tackle this problem: data are augmented with missing data (e.g. dates of infection) that are needed to write down the likelihood; in a Bayesian setting, the joint posterior distribution of parameters and augmented data is explored usually via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling [1]. This methodology is now well established in the field and has been successfully applied to analyse a range of complex datasets. However, for relatively large outbreaks with detailed data, this approach may require very long computational times. Interested readers can, for example, read references [2\u201311].",

This usually requires that the statistical model used to analyse the data is explicitly based on a mechanistic model of disease spread [12]. Transmission parameters of interest, for example, the reproduction number (the number of individuals infected by a case), are usually mathematically defined in those models. Fitting such parametric mechanistic models to outbreak data can give useful insights on transmission [7,13\u201315], but is subject to the same limitations as parametric fitting in other fields. For example, although there are some exceptions [10], the approach usually requires to predefine time intervals on which transmission rates are constant. This can sometimes be difficult to achieve in a non-ad hoc way.",

However, since these methods generally only consider disease cases rather than the uninfected, but potentially susceptible bulk of the population, they can say little about the risk factors for infection or provide estimates of transmissibility in different contexts (e.g. households, schools or as a function of distance between a susceptible and an infected individual).",

Fitting a mechanistic model seems to be the only way to account for the depletion of susceptibles, the information on uninfected individuals leading to a quantification of relative risks; and it may ensure a better control of the variance of the estimates. Tree-reconstruction methods can provide further insights on what effectively happened during the outbreak with summary statistics on who was infected by whom, when and where and temporal change in the reproduction number. They can also provide a framework to detect abnormal features in the data that are not initially accounted for in a mechanistic model. It is therefore important that the two approaches can be integrated in a coherent way.",

For simplicity, farms are partitioned into three groups on the basis of the number of cattle nc and the number of sheep 3ns: cattle (cattle farm: nc \u2265 ns), sheep (sheep farm: ns > nc) and small (small farm: nc + ns < 100) [13]. We assume that the latent period of FMD is 3 days and that infectious farms remain so until the time of slaughter. The transmission hazard \u03b2 between case farm i and susceptible farm j that is introduced in equation (3.1) is modelled as a function of the following characteristics:\n\u2014 the type (cattle, sheep or small) of case farm i. We estimate the relative infectivity of sheep farms  and small farms  relative to cattle farms. So the multiplicative term on the transmission hazard is  if case farm is a sheep farm,  if it is a small farm and 1 if it is a cattle farm;\u2014 the type (cattle, sheep or small) of susceptible farm j. We estimate the relative susceptibility of sheep farms  and small farms  relative to cattle farms; and\u2014 the distance dij between farm i and farm j. Two models are considered: M1: discrete model. We assume that the transmission kernel is a step function with K + 1 change points {dk}k=0, \u2026 ,K and where the multiplicative term on the transmission hazard is  if dk\u22121< dij \u2264 dk.

On day 30, with 80 cases detected, posterior means are always relatively close to the true simulation value although credible intervals remain wide for some parameters like the relative infectivity and susceptibility of children and the mean generation time. On day 40 (182 cases detected), we would rightly conclude that children are more infectious and susceptible than adults although here again the credible intervals remain relatively wide. Properly characterizing the infectivity profile requires substantially more data (849 cases detected by day 60). Only 10 days after control measures are implemented, fairly accurate estimation of the efficacy of interventions in different settings becomes possible.\n",

In the FMD application, discretization reduced the computational time from few weeks to few minutes with no change in the estimates of the transmission kernel. It is likely that with substantial effort and parallel programming, we could have reduced the computation time of brute force approach by one or two orders of magnitude. Even so, it seems unlikely that computational times could have gone much below few days. This has to be compared with the few minutes needed to run our algorithms on the FMD dataset. For small datasets, discretization may provide no computational gain if it takes longer to explore the set \u03a8 of transmission risk factors than to sum over the pairs {case i, individual j}. Discretization may be difficult to implement on particularly complex transmission models [19,23] in which case brute force calculation of the likelihood may be needed.",

The first one is a sequential approach that we used to analyse data from an influenza school outbreak [7]. Here, we implemented an alternative strategy where transmission parameters and the transmission tree are estimated simultaneously. There are pros and cons for each of those strategies. A nice feature of simultaneous inference is that the information on the transmission tree can sometimes lead to very simple and fast maximization routines in the frequentist setting (see appendix A) and to very good mixing in the MCMC chains in the Bayesian setting. However, for small datasets, we sometimes observed convergence problems in the Bayesian implementation of simultaneous inference. For example, let assume that there are two types A and B of individuals and that at iteration i of the MCMC, by chance, all the source cases in the transmission tree are of type A. If that happens, the chain may then be stuck at a local maximum where the infectivity of cases of type B is very close to 0. The EM algorithm does not suffer from that problem on small datasets; but has the disadvantage that it cannot be used when dates of infection are missing. The sequential Bayesian approach presented in Cauchemez et al. [7] may therefore be the most robust strategy, as it can be used in small datasets and when dates of infection are missing; but it requires extra work to tune the variance of the Metropolis-Hastings proposals to ensure satisfactory mixing.",

This assumption reduces the computational burden since it implies that the infection hazard an individual is exposed to solely depends on measured quantities plus the parameters of the model, rather than on the unobserved days of infection of other cases. In practice, assumption H1 seems acceptable for a relatively wide range of diseases since infectivity is often triggered or influenced by symptoms. However, where the assumption is invalid, more computationally intensive methods accounting for the unobserved times of infection become necessary [23].",

The simulation study showed that even in situations where under-reporting is substantial (e.g. 50%), it would still be possible to obtain informative estimates of key characteristics. We found that estimates of the transmission rate in the community and in the hospital were relatively robust to under-reporting in those settings. This can be explained by the fact that in a large population, the exponential growth rate of the epidemic is not affected by under-reporting. But estimates of transmission rates in small social units such as households were\u2014as might be expected\u2014strongly affected by under-ascertainment of cases. Estimates of relative infectivity were particularly sensitive to under-reporting, with large variance and sometimes important bias. Estimating relative infectivity is in general quite challenging because it requires that one can compare the offspring of one group of individuals (e.g. adults) with that of another group (e.g. children) and this becomes very difficult as under-reporting increases. It is likely that estimates would be less robust to underreporting, if reporting rates changed over time, as probably happens in real epidemics.",

A particular challenge in outbreak data is that they are rarely informative about the incubation period of the disease. In the simulations study, for example, we made the assumption that the distribution of the incubation period of the disease was known. If it was not the case, one would require extra data to estimate it.
