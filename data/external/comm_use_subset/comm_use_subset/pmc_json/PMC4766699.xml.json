            "text": "Surgical resection is the primary treatment option for patients with early stage of HCC [2]. After surgical treatment, patients should accept chemotherapy. However the rate of total 5-years survival is very low due to side effects of chemotherapeutic drugs and the chemo-resistance of tumor cells. Therefore it is very important to develop new drugs for HCC treatment [3]. It is well known that Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) stress could induce cell apoptosis or cell death in many tumor categories, including breast cancer [4], neuroectodermal tumor [5], HCC [6], etc. ER stress could activate unfolded protein response (UPR) whose signaling network consists of three stress sensors, namely protein kinase RNA like ER kinase (PERK) or RNA-dependent protein kinase-like kinase, inositol-requiring enzyme 1\u03b1 (IRE1\u03b1), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) [7]. In cancer cells, UPR could be activated by exposure to hypoxia, oxidative stress and nutrient starvation. The tumor microenvironment usually features hypoxia and high content of reactive oxygen species (ROS) because of the highly active proliferation and metabolism status of cancer cells. Hypoxia and ROS could direct PERK activation, which in turn activates eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2\u03b1 (eIF2\u03b1) which would induce the expression of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) for regulating redox homeostasis and metabolic homeostasis [8]. However CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-homologous protein (CHOP, also known as GADD153), a downstream element to ATF4 in the PERK pathway, induces apoptosis or cell death under intensive or prolonged ER stress conditions [9, 10]. Interestingly, activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), a bZIP DNA-binding protein, is associated with CHOP and thus integrated into the PERK/eIF2\u03b1 pathway under ER stress backgrounds [11]. Expression of ATF3 could be induced by ER stress and involved in regulation of cell apoptosis [12]. In the tumors, ATF3 might induce cell apoptosis or improve cell survival depending on tumor types. Currently, several studies have shown that ATF3 plays tumor suppressing roles in different cancer types, including colon cancer [11] and esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCC) [13]. It\u2019s also reported that the overexpression of ATF3 suppresses growth of HeLa cells [14]. Other data showed that niclosamide, an antihelminthic drug for treatment of tapeworm infections approved by FDA, has exhibited anticancer function in different tumor types, including leukemia, colon cancer, glioma, etc [15]. We hypothesized that niclosamide also has effective function in anti-HCC. In this study, We demonstrated a new mechanism of niclosamide as anti-cancer with HCC cells.",

It\u2019s also shown in our study that CHOP mRNA level was increased by over 20 times. To identify whether PERK pathway is activated by niclosamide, different doses of niclosamide was used to treat hepatoma cells and certain protein levels were analyzed with western blotting. We found protein levels of ATF4, ATF3 and CHOP, which are important transcription factors of the PERK pathway, were significantly increased in a dose dependent manner in accordance with the elevation of PERK protein level (Fig. 3a, b). In turn, phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 was enhanced by active PERK (Fig. 3a, c). Interestingly, under normal conditions ATF3 level was low in HCC cells, but its elevation was more significant than ATF4 or CHOP (Fig. 3b).

It\u2019s known that sustaining ER stress could sequentially activate IRE1\u03b1, ATF6 and PERK pathways [4, 8]. PERK/ATF4/CHOP pathway is one of most important pathways to induce cancer cell apoptosis in the UPR [18]. ATF3 is an important factor for stress response in cells and it interact with ATF4 and CHOP, these two transcription factors being PERK targeting genes under ER stress conditions [5, 9]. Current study demonstrated that ATF3 was involved in regulation of PERK function [19]. We further tried to reveal whether their protein levels are related with dose of niclosamide or not. Data of western blotting indicated that niclosamide upregulates PERK, ATF4, ATF3 and CHOP depending on the niclosamide concentration (Fig. 3). The results also demonstrated that caspase-3 is activated under niclosamide treatment (Fig. 3). Many studies had shown that niclosamide blocked cancer cells proliferation in a number of tumors types by suppressing the activities of several oncogenic pathways, including NF-kB, STAT3, notch and Wnt [20-22]. It also increases the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in acute myelogenous leukemia cells and enhances sensitivity to ROS in lung cancer cells [23]. Recently, it was identified that niclosamide could suppress HCC proliferation by blocking Wnt pathway [24]. Interestingly, we found that PERK pathway should play a critical role in HCC apoptosis induced by niclosamide. The apoptosis-inducing role of niclosamide in HCC could be abrogated by PERK inhibitor, GSK2606414 (Fig. 5). Several studies have suggested PERK/ATF4/CHOP pathway being involved in regulation of cells apoptosis and death in HCC [6, 25, 26].",

            "text": "Current studies have demonstrated that ATF3 plays an integral role in the PERK-eIF2\u03b1 pathway in regulation of downstream gene expression when ER-stress is activated [27]. ATF3 is integrated in the PERK pathway, and its expression is regulated by PERK [19]. In the PERK pathway, ATF3 also modulates CHOP expression and regulates eIF2\u03b1 activation by negative feedback [27]. In clinical HCC samples, the expression level of ATF3 is significantly low [28]. It\u2019s also reported that ATF3 expression was low in HepG2 and QGY7701 cells. Niclosamide not only increases ATF3 mRNA and protein levels in HCCs, but also stimulates ATF3 accumulation in nucleus of HepG2 or QGY7701 cells (Fig. 4a). Because ATF3 functions in regulation of cancer cell survival and apoptosis depending on tumor types, its function in HCC was still unclear. Our data showed that downregulation of ATF3 expression level in HepG2 could remarkably abrogate effects of niclosamide on cell viability and activate caspase-3 level (Fig. 6a, b, c). Especially, PERK and CHOP expression levels were lower in ATF3 knock down cells than wild type cells either with or without niclosamide treatment (Fig. 6d, e). Several observations suggested that ATF3, an integrated player coordinating the expression of ER stress response related genes, directly regulates target gene expression which induce cell death or apoptosis in p53-dependent or independent ways in cancer cells under ER stress [16, 19]. It represses cancer-related chemokine expression and regulates cancer cells micro-environment under ER stress [11]. In our study, expression of ER stress target genes was repressed in an ATF3-absent condition in HepG2 and QGY7701 cells. Our study demonstrates a series of crucial roles of ATF3 in PERK/CHOP pathway activation and cells apoptosis induction resulting from niclosamide treatment in HCC (Fig. 7).",
