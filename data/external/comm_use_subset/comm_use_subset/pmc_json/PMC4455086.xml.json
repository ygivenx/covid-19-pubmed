A recent review reported that the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) was absent in over one-third of close to 4,000 antimalarial drug samples tested from pharmacies in seven southeast Asian and 21 sub-Saharan African countries1; over 40% of the alleged artemisinin-containing drugs were falsified, outright fakes. A wide variety of falsified brand name and generic medicines and even falsified raw ingredients for several essential pharmaceuticals have been found in rich and poor countries.2\u20137 Such drugs are often used for acutely ill patients, many of whom would die or suffer prolonged illness without proper treatment. In addition to patients' loss of confidence in the health-care delivery system, microbial resistance to the drug may develop and spread if medicines contain subtherapeutic doses or no API. The increasing global scientific and public awareness and epidemic proportions of the spreading problem are reflected in the number of articles on \u201cfake drugs\u201d cited in PubMed: 27 papers from 1966 to 1999, 56 papers from 2000 to 2004, 122 papers from 2005 to 2009, and 294 papers from 2010 to 2015 (February).",

Data are emerging from the Pharmaceutical Security Institute (PSI), a not-for-profit membership organization of pharmaceutical security directors, indicating that a large number of companies, products, and countries are targeted.8 For instance, since 2008, Pfizer Pharmaceuticals (Pfizer Global Security, New York, NY) has identified a rapidly increasing number of falsified products, countries reporting falsified drugs, and breaches of the legitimate supply chain national entry points (Table 1); the increases have been from 40% to over 100%. Of Pfizer products, those for erectile dysfunction are most frequently falsified9; other such products target patients with Alzheimer's disease, cancer, high cholesterol, hypertension, malaria, and anxiety disorder. Facilities where fake drugs were made or compounded were discovered with moldy walls, dirty equipment, and infested with rodents and insects (Figure 1). Falsifiers have created products that are visually indistinguishable from the genuine product, clearly demonstrating criminal intent to deceive. This increasingly recognized problem on virtually all continents is a pandemic defined as \u201can epidemic occurring over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries, and usually affecting a large number of people.\u201d10",

This article focuses mainly on medical and public health considerations of falsified medicines that are particularly widespread in low- and middle-income countries.13\u201315 Although there are increasing reports of detection of a variety of fake drugs from around the world, paradoxically, there are virtually no reports from middle- or high-income countries quantifying the state of poor quality medicines, only anecdotal case citations.",

Few functional national regulatory authorities exist in low-income nations that lack trained staff and suitably equipped laboratories to test drug quality centrally or in peripheral pharmacies or markets.13,14 Furthermore, the variability or absence of national and international criminal statutes, lack of an international agreement against trafficking of poor quality medicines, and inadequate punishments for convicted offenders reflect the weak legal framework for confronting drug fraud. One of the biggest obstacles in provision of quality-assured pharmaceuticals is the lack of effective manufacturing, regulatory, and quality processing in India and China. In 2013, 10 global public health agencies including providers, foundations, and research institutions contributed to developing an advocacy campaign to address falsified medicines, particularly in China. This campaign called Fight the Fakes is a step toward raising awareness about the problem, but legal action has to follow along with more public and political awareness.15",

Global leadership to date has devolved in parts to the WHO, the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, and INTERPOL, each with diverse missions, responsibilities, limited authorities, and their own collaborations, funding networks, cultures, and languages.17 No organization is leading assertively.

These approaches are summarized in Table 2, deriving from the IOM report16 and a recent analysis by Green and others20 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reference laboratory. Within each method there are numerous tools and prototypes being used and new ones tested. Current technologies for field use rely on visual packaging inspection, lot number reporting via mobile phones, thin-layer chromatography, colorimetric tests, and simplified spectroscopic methods. Gas and liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry are some of the more advanced and complex techniques for investigating drug quality in central laboratories. Qualitative or semiquantitative tests for an API are not substitutes for proper manufacturing control, dissolution studies, pharmacokinetics equivalence, and supply chain integrity. A very promising recent development has been the U.S. Pharmacopeia Promoting the Quality of Medicines (PQM) program in several African, Asian, and Latin American countries using the \u201cMinilab\u201d (Global Pharma Health Fund e.V., Giessen, Germany).21\u201323 This training program supported by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) has trained several hundred persons in rapid chemical analysis of drugs taken from public and private pharmacy stocks.23 A major reference training center has recently been opened in Accra, Ghana, with USAID and U.S. Pharmacopeia support as a referral testing and regional training center. Important also is the development of the counterfeit detection (CD)-3 (US Food and Drug Administration, Forensic Chemistry Center, Cincinnati, OH), a promising handheld electronic device for peripheral use that detects fake packaging at point of sale with images and videos of the suspect samples.24,25 The FDA, Skoll Foundation, and other partners are supporting expansion of testing and use of this device. We recommend that a precertification of essential diagnostics, drugs, and vaccines should be required for specific regional and global control, elimination, and eradication programs and campaigns. More information is needed to confirm that precertification of products is occurring for the PMI and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and products purchased by U.N.

However, some argue that the U.N. system, including the WHO, is poorly suited to be in a leadership role because of sparse technical expertise in products, manufacturing, and quality systems. U.N. agencies are beholden to member states and cannot regulate or enforce anything easily, especially, in India and China. In this regard, WHO could serve the role of a partner rather than a leader. The recently revitalized Rapid Alert program at WHO has begun to \u201ctrack and trace\u201d poor quality drugs as reported voluntarily by member countries.38 Rapid Alert notices are published periodically by WHO indicating the fake drug type, lot number, quantity of product, and place detected. Strong action by countries can stem the tide as shown in Rwanda39 and Cambodia,40 although unique situations and major multi-sectorial engagements exist in these countries. One solution is creation of regional harmonization networks, addressing some elements of drug registration tied to regional economic communities; the African Medicines Registration Harmonization Initiative is one example of such a network. The U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has also made recent attempts at facilitating international cooperation against falsified medicines. One proposal has been a trilateral coalition of the UNODC, WHO, and Interpol.17 Still, active and transparent support from the FDA, drug companies, individual countries, and other partners will be needed; the FDA may be the most qualified as a leadership organization based on their technical expertise and global influence. Mechanisms for training technical staff, regulating products, improving manufacturing practices, and stopping criminal production are needed to assure a good supply of medicines. Given that the problem of substandard and falsified medicines should be approached primarily from a public health and equity perspective, it is important that the negotiations on the way forward be led by the Ministries of Health along with the Ministers of Finance and Trade, while respecting legitimate intellectual property rights. Could and should WHO be the lead organization in curbing the spreading epidemic of falsified pharmaceuticals? WHO's ability to take more assertive action is strengthened by the revised international health regulations. WHO's director general can convene emergency committees in response to public health emergencies as has been done recently for the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic in 2009, the middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) in 2013, the polio crises in 2014, and the Ebola epidemic in 2014\u20132015. Illicit drug trafficking is an emergency. The Drug Quality and Security Act, signed into law by President Obama in 2013, outlines steps to build an electronic system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs in the United States. The results of this system are awaited.",
