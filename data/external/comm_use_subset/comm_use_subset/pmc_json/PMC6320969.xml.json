This virus, a common human pathogen, is the main cause of oral infection, affecting the mouth and lips. In addition, HSV-1 can be the infectious agent of several diseases including recurrent cold sores, keratoconjunctivitis, and life-threatening herpes encephalitis [1,2,3]. Following primary infection, HSV establishes infections in the neurons of the sensory ganglia from where it may become latent in the body [4,5]. In the nervous system, the virus is protected from the host immune system as a latent state, which can be reactivated by several factors, such as hormonal changes, ultraviolet (UV) light, and mainly the stress [6]. The treatment of infection caused by the HSV-1 include the use of drugs, such as acyclovir, valacyclovir, famciclovir, penciclovir, and cidofovirare [7]. Some pharmacokinetic limitations of these drugs can be difficult because of their transport to affected tissues, inducing non-therapeutic drug levels. Moreover, long-term of these treatments may lead to the selection of resistant HSV, being an additional concern mainly for the immunocompromised patients, which has emphasized the need for alternative strategies [8,9].",

In addition to the antimalarial activity, CQ has been used to treat chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus [10,11,12]. Recently, this drug has also attracted attention due to its anticancer [13,14,15,16,17] and antiviral activity [18,19,20,21,22,23,24]. In this context, CQ is a hydrophilic drug with low toxicity that has shown some limitations to reach an effective intracellular concentration. One of the main disadvantages of the conventional malaria treatment is the non-specific targeting to intracellular parasites, which leads to high dose administration, resulting in toxicity [25].",

In attempt to solve this limitation of CQ against HSV-1, the nanodrug delivery systems (NDDS) are known to change drug biodistribution, decrease toxicity, modify drug release rate, and mainly, drug targeting to affected tissues/cell [26]. Among the NDDS, polymeric nanoparticles (NP) is a promising approach to improve drug uptake for a specific cell line. Their advantages include higher stability in biological fluids and easy storage conditions [27,28]. Polyesters, such as poly(lactic acid) (PLA) are biocompatible and biodegradable polymers, which are completely eliminated from the body by natural metabolic pathways. Furthermore, PLA is a polymer approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that has been widely used as a biomaterial for the preparation of nanoparticles for drug delivery [29].",

Considering the dispersion of preformed polymers, the solvent evaporation method or the spontaneous emulsification/solvent diffusion method is a well-consolidated one [30]. Nanoprecipitation (solvent displacement method) is a one-step procedure controlled by the interfacial deposition of the polymer after its displacement from organic to aqueous phase. Due to the fast spontaneous diffusion, nanoparticle formation occurs instantaneously. Emulsification-solvent evaporation method is a two-step procedure in which the organic solution is emulsified in the aqueous phase using a high-speed homogenization or ultrasonication. The formation of NP occurs due to the polymer precipitation after the solvent evaporation [27].",

Indeed, hydrophilic drugs have weak interactions with polyesters, such as PLA. Thus, the drug transport from the organic phase to the outer aqueous phase induces low entrapment efficiency. This phenomenon justifies drawbacks of less-well protected drug from degradation and a faster drug release [33]. Some strategies have been used to improve the encapsulation efficiency of hydrophilic molecules in polyester nanoparticles. Controlling pH of aqueous phase, changes in the solvent phase, use of high drug concentration, and salt addition in the aqueous phase are some examples [30].",

This drug has a character of weak base that contributes to increase the intracellular pH, affecting the virus life cycle. In addition. CQ impairs the gD protein transport from trans-Golgi network to cell membrane, which induces the formation of defective viral particles [38]. Thus, this study was performed to improve the encapsulation efficiency of hydrophilic CQ into biocompatible PLA nanoparticles, and to evaluate how the modulation of the drug release affects its anti-HSV activity. The experimental design included different preparation methods, variation in the polymer/drug ratio, and specific parameters such as pH of aqueous phase.

In this context, Vero E6 cells were infected with a common human pathogen, the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). The antiviral activity of CQ has been reported in the literature [18,19,20,21,22,23,24]. However, its anti-HSV-1 activity was not yet been well described. Indeed, due to the similar characteristic with previous described virus infections studies using CQ, a promising effect against HSV-1 infection could be hypothesized using this drug. In addition, its encapsulation in the biodegradable and biocompatible NP could solve its non-specific targeting against intracellular pathogens [25]. ",

However, this polymer is a hydrophobic polyester [29] and produce NP for encapsulating hydrophilic drugs, such as the CQ, consists of an interesting challenge [30,31]. Thus, two different methods of preparation of nanoparticles well applied for this class of polymer were carefully tested. The small size of the system and the drug encapsulation efficiency (EE) were selected as the main performance parameters. Physicochemical properties of the formulations produced by the nanoprecipitation method revealed that the drug/polymer ratio directly affected both particle size and EE% (Table 1). As expected, the particle size increased according to the polymer concentration in the organic phase. This effect generally improves the EE% of hydrophobic drugs [32,33,47,48]. In contrast to this fact, Formulations 1, 2, and 3 showed low EE%, which decrease with the polymer increment. Chloroquine Diphosphate (CQ) is a low-weight drug with multiple pKas, and solubility behavior dependent on pH. At this pH = 6.4, this hydrophilic compound is unable to favorable interaction with hydrophobic polyesters such as PLA. The increment of PLA leads to drug displacement from organic phase to aqueous phase, resulting in low entrapment efficiency [30,31,32,33,49].",

Thus, the pH of the aqueous phase, initially controlled at pH = 6.4, was adjusted to an alkaline range to increase the non-ionized fraction of CQ. This strategy can potentially improve the EE%, mainly considering hydrophilic drugs [33]. The central drug/polymer ratio of 1:10 was chosen for this purpose. Alkalinizing the aqueous phase (pH = 11.0) with NaOH in the Formulation 4 made possible improve the average EE% from 8.4% to 11.4%. Alkalinizing aqueous phase with NaHCO3 for pH = 8.4 in Formulation 5 proved to be more efficient, inducing an average EE% of about 25%. Previous studies have reported that CQ degradation is accelerated in 0.1 M NaOH media, by a hydrolysis mechanism [50]. The hypothesis of drug precipitation in the aqueous phase, due to the strongest alkaline pH, should also be considered.",

The electrostatic repulsion, in which adding ionic stabilizers, and the steric stabilization that can be achieved by non-ionic stabilizers into the medium. The formulations described in the present study are stabilized using poloxamer 188, a non-ionic and copolymer stabilizer agent. The steric stabilization is dominated by solvation effect [52]. Thus, pH changes or changes in drug/polymer ratio not necessary induces monotonically change in the zeta potential, as occurred in this approach (Table 1). This value slightly increased for Formulation 3 with the largest PLA content. When the PH increased for alkaline range (eight and eleven), the zeta potential remained negative, as expected.",

The best results using the nanoprecipitation method were reached using the CQ:PLA ratio of 1:5 w/w and 0.5 M NaHCO3 aqueous solution (pH = 8.4). These work conditions were repeated for the emulsification-solvent evaporation method, with an excellent average EE% level of about 64.1%. This fact corroborated with the successful partition of CQ-fb to the organic phase and the importance of the alkaline aqueous phase to maintain the drug and polymer in the droplets of the emulsion. The pH of the aqueous phase (0.5 M NaHCO3, pH = 8.4) assured a maximum of non-ionized of chloroquine\u2019s amine groups (Pka1 = 8.4, Pka2 = 10.8), compared to the previous tested aqueous phase (pH = 6.4). At contact with the organic immiscible solvent (DCM), the phase equilibrium between the ionized and the non-ionized species of CQ in the aqueous phase changes constantly, with the partition of non-ionized specie of the drug to the interface, and finally to the organic solvent. The displacement of non-ionized molecules of drug occurs until its exhaustion and transport of the total amount to the organic phase, as suggested, for example, in the Figure 5.

Considering the emulsification-solvent evaporation method, the EE% level superior to 60% is considered excellent, which induced a slow drug release profile adjusted by the parabolic diffusion mathematical model (r \u2265 0.95) (Table 2). This fact suggested a diffusion-controlled transport of CQ from the polymeric matrix of NP [43]. In addition, it is important to note that, on the best of our knowledge, no data in the literature describes the slow chloroquine release from PLA nanoparticles. Previous studies have shown a release of 52.40% of hydroxyl chloroquine sulphate from Eudragit\u00ae RL-100 NP (EE% = 63.14%) at 8 h [54]. The encapsulation of chloroquine diphosphate was described in chitosan NP prepared by ionic gelation technique (EE% = 59.5%), which induced the release of 40% of the drug at 24 h [55]. In the present study, the amount of drug released at 10 h was about 40%, which is much slower than the previously cited studies. In this approach, the residual amount of non-ionized specie of CQ loaded into PLA nanoparticles seems to be strongly interacting with PLA matrix. The parabolic model fitted the experimental data much better (r = 0.95) (Figure 2E), which suggested a drug release controlled by diffusion at the first moment. However, the erosion of polymeric matrix of particles should also be considered for release of residual entrapped drug, which could occur in a second moment [44,48,49,51]. ",

While these drugs have distinct metabolic pathways, they all act by blocking the synthesis of viral DNA, inhibiting DNA polymerase [58]. Three phosphorylation steps are required for the acyclovir action. The first phosphorylation is performed by the viral thymidine kinase (TK) encoded by the UL23 gene, while subsequent phosphorylation steps are performed by the host cell kinases [59]. Currently, there are some strains of HSV-1 resistant to acyclovir, in which the presence of mutations in UL23 and/or UL30 viral genes responsible for encoding TK and DNA polymerase, were detected [60]. The emergence of new strains resistant to conventional drugs highlight the need for new effective antiviral therapies with novel mechanisms of action [61,62]. Thus, new anti-herpetic drugs with different mechanism of action should be achieved. ",

The CQ has shown pronounced antiviral action against different viruses [64]. The study reported by Koyama and Uchida (1984) demonstrated that the multiplication of the HSV-1 strain HF in Vero cells was inhibited by ammonium chloride and chloroquine. It was also observed that the maturation of the intracellular virus was prevented immediately after the addition of weak bases in the late stage of infection, indicating that the site of inhibition by weak bases is one step in the maturation process of HSV-1 [34]. This present study showed that Vero E6 cells infected with HSV-1 and treated with CQ and CQ-NP at 30 \u00b5g mL\u22121 have 100% of viral replication inhibition after 48 h (Figure 4A). At the concentration range from 2.5 to 20 \u00b5g mL\u22121, the PLA NP significantly improved the anti-HSV-1 of CQ (Figure 4A). The CQ-NP induced an IC50 considerable lesser than that identified for CQ (Table 3). In addition, the CQ-NP (at 10 \u00b5g mL\u22121 and 20 \u00b5g mL\u22121) induced similar HSV-1 viral inhibition than that observed for the positive control, acyclovir, at 20 \u00b5g mL\u22121 (Figure 4B).

The data have demonstrated an efficient nanoencapsulation method, using emulsification-solvent evaporation, able to produce sub-300nm NP, with high EE% of the hydrophilic drug, and able to induce slow CQ release.
