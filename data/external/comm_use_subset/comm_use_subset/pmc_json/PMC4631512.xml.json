Influenza control can be achieved through various strategies including vaccination, the use of drug therapy, hand washing and social distancing\u2014removing oneself as much as possible from the population [1, 2]. Vaccines and drug therapies, however, may be ineffective (e.g. resistance to antivirals) or unavailable (i.e. pending development of a new vaccine). Thus, hand washing and social distancing practices (i.e., ranging from moderate to extreme total isolation), which can be used at all times during an infectious disease outbreak are integral in decreasing the probability of contracting and transmitting infection [1].",

Public health education campaigns, that include informative literature (i.e., pamphlets), posters, newspaper articles and advertisements, radio and television messages, and social media outlets (i.e., twitter, facebook) are used daily to inform the public on current health issues. Mass media outlets can aid in dissemination of this information. Studies of mass media campaigns and healthy behaviour have reported that mass media campaigns can elicit positive behaviour change and even prevent negative behaviour change in individuals [3\u20139]. It is therefore concluded that mass media campaigns should be used to inform the public so that behaviour change can result [3\u201310]. It has been shown that information conveyed by the media is becoming the critical factor as to whether or not a vaccination campaign will succeed [11]. It is believed that the media coverage of the recent SARS and 2009 H1N1 epidemics had an effect on the total spread of these pathogens [4, 7, 12, 13]. More recently, MERS-CoV, Ebola, and H7N9 have been the subject of many media reports.",

            "text": "Mathematical models can be employed to study the effects of media in an epidemic [19\u201332]. For example, the effects of media reports (i.e., on disease incidence, hospitalizations, deaths) can be incorporated as a function f(S, E, I, R) that directly affects the transmission rate in a susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) epidemiological model [19\u201327, 32, 33]:\nS\u02d9=\u03bb-f(S,E,I,R)\u03b2SI-dSE\u02d9=f(S,E,I,R)\u03b2SI-\u03c3E-dEI\u02d9=\u03c3E-\u03b3I-dIR\u02d9=\u03b3I-dR.(1)\nThis model has provided the basis of the vast majority of past mathematical modelling studies of media during an epidemic. In a previous study on the effects of mass media reports on important public health measures (i.e., peak number of infections, time of peak infection, end of epidemic and total number of infections), we demonstrated that the variability in these measures can vary drastically depending on the media function f(S, E, I, R) chosen [33]. In this study, we then demonstrated that the recommended public health measures to mitigate epidemic outcomes were not consistent over different choices of f(S, E, I, R), and we suggested that models that include a mass media compartment, that better represents population interactions with mass media, should be considered [33]. For example,\nS\u02d9=\u03bb-\u03b2SI-dS-g(M)SS\u02d9M=g(M)S-dSME\u02d9=\u03b2SI-\u03c3E-dEI\u02d9=\u03c3E-\u03b3I-dIR\u02d9=\u03b3I-dRM\u02d9=f(S,E,I,R)-\u03bcM,(2)\nexplicity includes a mass media compartment, allowing a sensitivity analysis over biological assumptions that determine the function f(S, E, I, R). Here, g(M) is a function representing the number of mass media reports M, g(M)S models the interaction that individuals have with media that can change their behaviour, S\nM is a class of susceptibles that are media aware and are less susceptible to infection (or entirely protected through healthy and social distancing behaviours), and \u03bc represents the effects of media fatigue. A further benefit of Eq (2) is that it enables the inclusion of mass media report data to replace f(S, E, I, R). Studies of the effects of mass media on epidemic outcomes employing systems of equations similar to Eq (2) exist in the literature [28\u201331], however, none of these studies have incorporated mass media data into their analysis. Also, quantification of the variability surrounding important public health measures has been ignored.",

From herewithin, we describe all healthy behaviours including isolation, limiting contacts and hand washing as \u2018social distancing\u2019. Social distancing levels included in the model are chosen to reflect different degrees of protection that healthy behaviour change can provide. Specifically, we include the extremes\u2014no protection and total protection/isolation, and a moderate protection level.

A sensitivity analysis of the model is also completed so that parameters that most affect the key public health measurements can be determined. Interestingly, the model parameters representing mass media reports and media fatigue are identified. When mass media data [34] is incorporated into the deterministic model, a two-peak pandemic curve results. This curve has similar qualitative characteristics to that observed over the recent 2009 H1N1 pandemic.",

It is interesting to note that the addition of public health control measures can increase the variability in the total number of infections and vaccinations.

However, the total number of infections over an epidemic is also sensitive to changes in the rates at which individuals become infectious (\u03c3) and recover (\u03b3). The figure also shows that the peak magnitude and the total number of infections are both sensitive to the media parameter \u03c1, and the epidemic end time is sensitive to the media fatigue rate \u03c1\n1. Overall, the sensitivity analysis results show that to minimize the effect of the epidemic, public health programs should strive to (1) reduce transmission (effectively reducing R\n0), (2) effectively use drug therapies that can shorten the infectious period (effectively decreasing \u03c3 and increasing \u03b3), (3) increase the number of reported cases \u03c1, and (4) provide educational programs throughout an epidemic that will help minimize the waning of positive social distancing practices \u03c1\n1.

Here, the English language media report levels are used (see Fig 3, dashed line) (top row), and the media data is then extended to consider various scenarios of media reporting until the end of the pandemic: a constant level equal to the last collected data point (second row), a decay after the final data point (third row), setting the report level to zero at the end of the data set (fourth row), and setting the number of reports to zero at the declared end of the pandemic (week 47 [44]). Note that when vaccination is included in the model (right column), the vaccination rate for each of the scenarios is between 25% to 40% of the population [2], and vaccination is included only in the second wave of infection. Fig 5 demonstrates that for all cases, two waves of the pandemic occur, with the magnitude of the peaks varying by the model assumptions.

Also, exposed and infectious individuals can also practice social distancing measures. For example, an infected individual may elect to stay home from work, and distance themselves from family members in the same household as well. To model continuous social distancing in all classes we propose a new model employing partial differential equations that keeps track of all classes of infection over time and social distancing space. Analysis of this model is current work. In future work, the model will be augmented to include asymptomatic infections, where individuals are infectious but do not demonstrate symptoms. This will affect transmission, as social distancing will not be enhanced if infection is asymptomatic, and thus, mass media messages that encourage social distancing will be ever more important.",
