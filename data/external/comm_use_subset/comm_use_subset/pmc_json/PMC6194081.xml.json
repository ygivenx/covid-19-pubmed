            "text": "New-born calves are immunologically na\u00efve at birth, offering the ideal scenario to observe the development of immunocompetence through time. The protection of the womb environment during the pre-partum period, coupled with syndesmochorial placentation, results in a lack of experience to pathogens, meaning that calves are born with an essentially non-functional immune response1. Development of immunocompetence in calves relies on successful absorption of maternal colostrum derived immunoglobulins, which in turn is dependent upon successful colostrum management. The importance of colostrum-derived passive immunity, through intestinal absorption of colostral immunoglobulins, to the mortality, morbidity, and subsequent growth and welfare of a newborn calf is recognised internationally2\u20135. Consequently, colostrum feeding management is of critical importance to the health and vitality of the calf, in order to confer protection from the various septicemic and enteric diseases that they are susceptible to in early life2. Failure of passive transfer of colostrum derived IgGs (FPT, serum IgG < 10 mg/mL) markedly increases morbidity and mortality in calves3\u20135. There is tremendous variation in the passive immune status of dairy calves3,6\u20138 and, generally passive immunity of dairy calves is much lower than beef calves7. This difference is primarily attributed to differences in colostrum Ig levels, whereby dairy cows produce relatively large volumes of colostrum with relatively low concentrations of Ig while beef cows produce the opposite3,9,10. In the suckled beef calf, there are also large differences in passive immunity between cow breed types3,8.",

Peripheral whole blood samples are commonly used for immunological studies as they are easily obtained and may provide an insight into immune development, particularly when combined with a transcriptomics approach12. Previous studies from our group have successfully investigated the immune response of two dairy breeds to gradual weaning using whole blood to analyse alterations in the relative abundance of key immune genes13. Here, utilizing the whole blood transcriptome of dairy calves in addition to two beef breeds, we aim to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in the development of immunocompetence, from birth through the first 7 days of life. Understanding such mechanisms would be a step towards integrating optimum husbandry practices, and to identifying possible biomarkers associated with development of immunocompetence for breeding of superior calves.",

The top over-represented networks are highlighted in Table 2. Firstly, biologically interesting pathways were investigated within the CL crossbred calves. Comparison of 48 h to 0 h CL calves resulted in 2095 DEG, 1766 of which were successfully mapped in IPA. Biologically interesting enriched molecular, cellular and physiological networks included cellular movement, immune cell trafficking, and lymphoid tissue structure and development. Top enriched canonical pathways included cholesterol biosynthesis, which was upregulated in the 48 h old calves, the complements system, also upregulated at 48 h, and two interleukin signalling pathways, 1l-9 and Il-12 in which the majority of genes were present at higher levels after 48 h. Investigating upstream analysis effector genes identified a number of significantly altered upstream regulators including a number of growth factors (Areg, Hgf, VEGFA), cytokines (c5f2, PRL, IFNa2), and also the Fc gamma receptor upstream pathway activated in the CL calves at 48 h. Supplementary Fig. 10 shows activation of transmigration of cells with many immunologically important receptors highlighted as upregulated in the 48 h calves. The calves were then compared at the later timepoint of 168 h to 72 h, to investigate the transition of the immune response evident through the blood transcriptome from day. Only 383 DEG were identified between the two time points in the CL calves. Top molecular cellular and physiological networks again included cellular movement, immune cell trafficking and also cellular function and maintenance. There were no canonical pathways identified as significantly enriched in the comparison. Overall a major stabilization of the immune response was evident through the inhibition of a number of immune related regulators (Supplementary Fig. 11).",

The molecular variations in key genes such as cytokines and B cell receptors across all breeds gives a tremendous insight into possible reasons as to why certain cattle breeds are more susceptible than others to illness during the neonatal period. It is clear from these data, that dairy calves undergo a systemic stress response following separation from the dam at birth and following artificial feeding of colostrum. Key genes increased in LF calves at 168 h including the immunoglobulin receptors FCER1A and FCRLA, and IL-12r, an immune regulator consistently down regulated in beef CL and in dairy calves, offer possible targets for biomarker discovery and a greater understanding into the development of immunocompetence.",
