            "text": "Coronaviruses are divided into three groups. Group I viruses, including human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), and Group II viruses, such as mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS, infect mammals, whereas group III viruses, such as infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), infect avian species. Coronavirus genomes are extraordinarily large, with sizes ranging from 27 to 32 kilobases (kb). One-third of the genome consists of the structural proteins, spike (S), envelope (E), matrix (M) and nucleocapsid (N), as well as accessory proteins specific to different strains. Approximately two-thirds of the genome encodes, in a single open reading frame (ORF), non-structural replicase proteins (nsp) that are involved in viral RNA synthesis. Many of the coronavirus nsp proteins have been shown, or are predicted, to have enzymatic functions, including papain-like cysteine proteinases (nsp3), 3C-like cysteine proteinase (nsp5), RNA-primase (nsp8), 2\u2032O-MTase cofactor (nsp10), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), 5\u2032-3\u2032 helicase (nsp13), 3\u2032-5\u2032 exonuclease (nsp14), endoribonuclease (nsp15) and S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent (nucleoside-2\u2032O)-methyltransferase (2\u2032O-MTase, nsp16) and RNA cap N7-methyltransferase activity (nsp14) [5]\u2013[9]. Nsp1 is the N-terminal cleavage product of the replicase polyprotein and is the first mature viral protein expressed in the host cell cytoplasm. Deletion of the nsp1-coding region in infectious clones of MHV yielded viruses that were unable to productively infect cultured cells. Furthermore, exogenous expression of MHV nsp1 in mammalian cells arrested the cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase and inhibited cell proliferation [10], [11]. SARS-CoV nsp1 protein induces degradation of host mRNA and suppression of translation both in nsp1-expressing cells and in SARS-CoV-infected cells [12]. In vivo studies have suggested that SARS-CoV nsp1 may counteract the host innate immune responses, thereby providing a survival advantage for the virus [13], [14]. Overall, these observations indicate that nsp1 may participate in multiple stages of the coronavirus life cycle, and implicate this protein as a potentially important virulence factor.",

The growth kinetics of both wild-type (WT) MHV-A59 and mutant viruses were determined by infecting murine 17Cl-1 cells with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. The plaque morphology of MHV-nsp1-27D was the same as that of WT MHV-A59 (data not shown). Both mutant and WT viruses began to replicate at 8 h post-infection (p.i.), and reached maximal titers at 12 h p.i. The maximal titer of MHV-nsp1-27D was about 5\u00d7105 pfu/ml, a little lower than that of WT MHV-A59 (1\u00d7106 pfu/ml). Viral growth and the peak titer of MHV-nsp1-27D were different from those of WT MHV-A59 (Figure 3C). To assess the stability of the recombinant virus, the nsp1-coding region of MHV-nsp1-27D was sequenced after five passages in tissue culture; sequence analysis showed that no nucleotide changes were detected (Figure 3A, B).",

Two-weeks p.i., mice were challenged with WT MHV-A59 by the same route, and the mortality determined 14 days post-challenge (Figure 7).

Some viruses indirectly antagonize the antiviral response by inhibiting the general mechanisms of host cell gene expression [18]\u2013[20]. A recent report suggested that SARS-CoV nsp1 suppressed host cell gene expression, inducing generalized host cell mRNA degradation [12]. In order to reveal the potential role of the LLRKxGxKG region in the attenuation of the MHV-nsp1-27D mutant virus, we analyzed changes in reporter gene expression in cells expressing nsp1 or nsp1-27D. BHK-21 cells were co-transfected with different expression plasmids (pcDNA3.1, pcDNA3.1-nsp1 or pcDNA3.1-nsp1-27D) and reporter plasmids. The activity of the reporter gene, luciferase, was assessed; this was under the control of the CMV and SV40 promoters, and the interferon stimulated response element (ISRE). The results showed that co-expression of MHV-nsp1 significantly reduced the luciferase activity (Figure 8) by about 6-fold (P<0.01) for the CMV promoter, 3-fold (P<0.01) for the SV40 promoter and 3-fold (P<0.01) for the ISRE. By comparison, co-expression of MHV-nsp1-27D significantly decreased luciferase activity by about 2-fold (P<0.01) for the CMV promoter, 1.5-fold (P<0.01) for the SV40 promoter and 1.5-fold (P<0.01) for the ISRE. Our results indicate that MHV nsp1 can suppress host cell gene expression, but that deletion of the LLRKxGxKG region attenuates this effect. This further suggests that the conserved region, LLRKxGxKG, may play an important role in the suppression of host cell gene expression.",

This study demonstrates that an unprecedented level of attenuation is achieved through deletion of the LLRKxGxKG region in MHV-A59 nsp1. Firstly, we found that survival of C57BL/6 mice infected with MHV-nsp1-27D was higher than that of mice infected with MHV-A59, irrespective of whether the route of infection was intracranial or intraperitoneal. Secondly, the results showed that MHV-nsp1-27D was unable to cause acute hepatitis, as evidenced by the much lower serum ALT levels than those seen in mice infected with MHV-A59. Thirdly, in pathological investigations designed to explore the importance of the LLRKxGxKG region for virus virulence in vivo, intraperitoneal infection of mice with MHV-A59 or MHV-nsp1-27D revealed that both viruses replicated in the spleen and liver, but that MHV-nsp1-27D titers were consistently lower than those of MHV-A59. Collectively, these data indicate that MHV-nsp1-27D is strongly attenuated in vivo, but retains the ability to replicate in secondary lymphoid organs. In addition, immunization with mutant virus (5000 pfu/mouse intraperitoneally or 200 pfu/mouse intracranially) was sufficient to protect C57BL/6 mice from subsequent challenge with an otherwise lethal dose of WT MHV-A59.
