A standard LAMP reaction was carried out to produce flower-like amplicons that had four kinds of single-stranded loops, positioned between F2-F1 (F-target), F2c-F1c (F-probe), B2-B1 (B-probe), and B2c-B1c (B-target), respectively (Fig. 1, Step I). In the second step (Fig. 1, Step II), LAMP amplicons were mixed with magnetic beads containing a hemiduplex oligonucleotide strand displacement probe (OSD) that was constructed by hybridizing an oligonucleotide complementary to the F-target (FP) with an antisense strand conjugated to invertase (Inv-FPc). The F-target itself (domain 2-1 in Fig. 1) is localized within an amplicon loop. It can initiate strand displacement of the OSD by binding to toehold domain 1* on FP, ultimately leading to the displacement of Inv-FPc (domain 2). After magnetic separation of the beads, the displaced Inv-FPc hydrolyzes sucrose into the monosaccharides glucose and fructose (Fig. 1, Step III) and the resulting glucose is then detectable by using any commercial blood glucose meter (Fig. 1, Step III).",

Yeast invertase was conjugated to FPc22 and could still successfully hydrolyze sucrose at its optimum temperature, 55 \u00b0C (Figure S1A). While we directly hybridized the invertase conjugates to beads, initial purification of the DNA-invertase conjugates prior to hybridization may further improve signal generation25. The efficiency of strand displacement (Step II) was assessed using DNA mimic of the LAMP loop (1A-T). Strand displacement of an invertase conjugate was measured as a function of 1A-T concentration, and as little as 1 nM of oligonucleotide could be detected by a glucometer after 40 min (Step III, Figure S2). We anticipated that LAMP should produce at least 5 nM each amplicon loops to initiate strand displacement.",

The LAMP amplicons (10 \u03bcL) were mixed with Inv-FPc/FP modified magnetic beads (18 \u03bcg) and incubated for 1 hour prior to magnetic separation and transfer of the supernatant into a 500 mM sucrose solution.

These nucleic acid samples contained both MERS-CoV virions along with defective interfering (DI) particles (MERS-CoV RNA). Nonetheless, MERS-CoV RNA was detected specifically relative to negative controls, and any parasitic amplicons that were randomly generated during RT-LAMP did not yield false positive responses (Fig. 3A, N-2 and Fig 3B, N-2). Surprisingly, the signal intensity increased to ~60 mg/dl (compare with Fig. 2A), even though less time was allowed for glucose generation (23 min vs 40 min, Step III).",

As expected, very small deviations were seen between all nine sets of measurements (1.26 mg/dl and 4.37 mg/dl for negative and positive responses, respectively, both of which were below 6% of their average signals). We further tested the stability of Inv-FPc/FP/MBs by measuring responsivity to 2E4 copies of sORF1A every 2 to 20 days (Fig. 4B).

The toehold in the FP strand was designed with 10 nucleotides in order to ensure robust interactions with the F-target in the LAMP loops, even at higher temperatures. Initially, we just repeated the method described above (Protocol 1) in which amplification, separation, and glucose generation steps were carried out separately and aliquots were transferred, except that all steps were now at 55 \u00b0C (Protocol 2, using thermostable invertase). Glucose was again read as an end-point of the assay, and a positive signal (with similar signal amplitude over negative control as Protocol 1) could be read after only 11 minutes, with MERS-CoV RNA extracted from 60 PFU MERS-CoV virus. There was slightly higher background at the higher temperature, and the overall signal:noise ratio decreased by a factor of two (Figure S5).",

The FP/Inv-FP duplex (for MERS-CoV) on magnetic beads was swapped with a probe set for ZEBOV VP30 (ZEBOV-FP/Inv-ZEBOV-FPc) that released Inv-ZEBOV-FPc only in response to a F-target loop in an ZEBOV VP30 amplicon. As shown in Fig 5, as few as 150 copies of this template displayed a glucometer signal that was at least 90 mg/dl than the negative buffer control (N-1) or non-specific templates (MERS-CoV sORF1A, N-2).

We therefore decided to adapt molecular amplification assays to glucometers, a device that is almost ubiquitous, and whose interpretation has become standardized across many users. We show how an isothermal amplification reaction can lead to the production of amplicons that specifically strand exchange invertase, which in turn leads to the production of an easily read glucose signal from otherwise inert sucrose. The sensitivity of the assays was mainly provided by the powerful signal amplification properties of LAMP, while selectivity was provided by both the hybridization specificities of the LAMP primers and of the interaction of LAMP product loops with strand displacement reactions.",

For more complex samples where endogenous glucose may affect virus detection, it may be possible to first remove background glucose or to do background subtraction by recording the ambient glucose level in the sample.22 But the effect of existed glucose will be of less import with the detection of MERS-CoV or ZEBOV in oral or other non-blood or non-urine samples. For example, viral loads in a MERS-CoV patient are as high as 1\u20132 \u00d7 106 copies per mL in the lower respiratory tract, 1 \u00d7 103 copies per mL in stool, and 5\u20136 \u00d7 103 copies per mL in an oronasal swab38. It was reported that there should be even more detectable MERS-CoV virus in sputum than in oronasal swabs.39 Given the excellent limit of detection (0.06PFU or 100 copies) we have observed, these clinically relevant limits should be observed against a moderate glucose background. For example, the average level of glucose in fasting saliva in non-diabetics is around 6 mg/dl, which would show a \u201cLO\u201d symbol in the glucometer and is small relative to our ~60 mg/ml signal amplitude.40 Similarly, RT-PCR results4142 suggest that ZEBOV can also be detected in low glucose samples such as saliva, stool, and tears during the acute period of illness. Thus, while glucose interference should be taken into account during assay development, it should not obscure reliable, robust detection of viral pathogens via our transduction method. We have proven the ZEBOV VP30 template can be detected when it is spiked into synthetic sputum (Figure S7A) and human saliva samples (Figure S7B). The synthetic sputum contained human genomic DNA, salmon sperm DNA, mucin, and other components (provided by the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health, PATH, Seattle, WA).21 The mucin was liquefied with 2% freshly made N-acetyl-L-cysteine and 1% sodium hydroxide prior to assay because it inhibited the Bst 2.0 polymerase. Human saliva was directly used after 10 min pre-heating (at 95 oC). The LAMP-OSD-glucometer method showed true positives in both 26% sputum and 20% saliva samples (Figure S7), without losing any sensitivity compared to pure buffer (Fig. 5). That said, signal amplitudes were decreased, especially for low copy samples.",

PrimerExplorer 4 (Eiken) was used to generate 3 sets of LAMP primers composed of the outer primers F3 and B3 and the inner primers FIP and BIP. Primer design was constrained to include at least a 30 bp gap between the F1 and F2 as well as between the B1 and B2 priming sites. These gaps should become part of the LAMP amplicon loop structures and were included to allow the subsequent recognition by the OSD probes. Primer specificity for all the sequenced ZEBOV isolates and a corresponding lack of significant cross-reactivity to other nucleic acids of human, related filoviral or pathogenic origin was further assessed using NCBI BLAST. All three primer sets were tested by amplification of plasmids bearing ebolavirus genomic fragments in standard LAMP reactions. Amplicon accumulation was analyzed at end-point by agarose gel electrophoresis and in real-time by measuring the incorporation of the intercalating fluorophore EvaGreen. Ultimately one of the three primer sets, ZEBOV.3.3 that demonstrated target-dependent amplification kinetics and generated minimal spurious amplicons was chosen for further assay development.",

On each day, three parallel assays were carried out with both the target MERS-CoV sORF1A DNA and buffer controls. A total of nine assays were performed for both the sORF1A target and buffer controls. Assay conditions were otherwise the same as in Fig 3. (B) Time dependence of glucometer responses to LAMP amplicons generated from 2E4 copies of sORF1A using a single preparation of Inv-FPc/FP/MBs. The error bars represent standard deviations calculated from three parallel assays. The commercial yeast INV was used in these experiments.",
