            "text": "Noroviruses are non-enveloped viruses from the Caliciviridae family that cause gastroenteritis in a variety of mammals including humans [1\u20135]. Human norovirus (HuNoV) infections account for significant mortality in the developing world, and in the developed world norovirus outbreaks come with a substantial financial burden [6]. HuNoV research has been hampered by the lack of a reproducible animal or cell culture system that supports viral replication. Using MNV-1 as a model allows norovirus replication and host cell interactions to be studied in cell culture and in small animals [7]. MNV-1 is a positive-sense RNA virus of approximately 7.4 kb, containing four open reading frames (ORF). ORF1 encodes for 6 non-structural proteins (NS1-2, NS3, NS4, NS5, NS6, and NS7) while ORF2 and ORF3 encode the major and minor structural proteins respectively [8]. ORF4 encodes for virulence factor 1, a non-essential protein involved in interactions with host apoptotic pathways [9].",

Linkage to the genome is thought to prevent detection by host pathogen recognition receptors such as RIG-1 and protein kinase R that detect uncapped 5\u2032 triphosphorylated RNA, leading to an antiviral response. NS5 additionally has a role in genome replication, acting in place of an RNA 5\u2032 cap to provide a free hydroxyl that can be extended by the virally encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NS7) [10]. The NS5 protein also acts to aid viral translation, recruiting host eukaryotic translation initiation factors to initiate translation of viral proteins [11]. The NS5 protein also contains regions of predicted disorder that are often associated with multiple functions [12, 13].",

The G1/S checkpoint controls progression from the first gap phase (G1), a period of substantial cell growth, into the synthesis phase (S) where the host DNA is replicated. Progression through G1/S is predominantly controlled by the phosphorylation status of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb), which is in turn controlled by the activities of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) (reviewed in [22]). Cyclins are expressed at various stages of cell division and bind to their corresponding CDK and phosphorylate numerous targets including pRb. In early G1 phase, cyclin D family members bind to CDK4/6 and phosphorylate pRb, driving G1 phase progression and expression of E and A cyclins. Cyclin E forms a complex with CDK2, which further phosphorylates pRb to release an E2F transcription factor, driving S phase entry [23]. Cyclin A levels continue to increase during S phase and help drive cell cycle progression through the later stages of the cell cycle, through to the initiation of prophase during mitosis [24, 25].",

Additionally, this G1/S arrest created conditions where MNV-1 replication was favored compared to other stages of the cell cycle. In this study, we show that expression of viral NS5 protein in cell culture induces an accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 phase through a G1/S arrest in an analogous manner to MNV-1 infection. Furthermore, the effects of NS5 on the host cell cycle are independent of the known replication and translation activities attributed to NS5 (VPg).",

We sought to determine if a viral encoded protein was responsible by analysis of the non-structural proteins of MNV-1 for effects to the host cell cycle. The NS5 protein from caliciviruses is essential to viral RNA transcription and translation and is essential for calicivirus replication. The NS5 protein has been shown to bind host eukaryotic translation initiation factors, recruiting these proteins for preferential viral translation and potentially inhibiting host protein expression [11, 30]. We hypothesized that an inhibition of host protein expression may contribute to a cell cycle arrest. The effect of NS5 on the host cell cycle was therefore determined by transfection of RAW-Blue cells with RNA transcripts, encoding individual viral genes, NS1-2 from MNV-1 was included as a negative control (Fig 1A). NS1-2 and NS5 were detected by their corresponding antibodies 18 h posttransfection (Fig 1C). Expression of NS5 increased the population of cells in the G0/G1 phase by 28% and decreased the S phase by 27% when compared to the mock-transfected population (Fig 1B). Furthermore, NS5 expression decreased cyclin A expression by 68% when compared to the mock-transfected control (Fig 1D). The cyclin A protein governs S phase entry and progression, so a decrease in expression would imply a decrease in S phase entry, further indicating NS5 as the protein responsible for the MNV-1 induced cell cycle manipulation. NS1-2 had no significant effects on the host cell cycle or cyclin A expression.",

The transition through G1/S is a highly regulated checkpoint during cell division and is often targeted by viruses to induce changes to the host cell cycle [14, 18, 31, 32]. The transition of cells through the G1/S restriction point was examined in cells expressing NS5. Cells were synchronized to the G1 phase through N-butyrate treatment, released from the arrest and transfected with NS5, NS1-2 and GFP coding RNA. NS1-2 was used as a viral control protein that did not affect the cell cycle and GFP as a non-viral RNA negative control. N-butyrate was also added to released populations and used as a positive control. Cells were then analyzed for their transition from G1 into S phase by FACS analysis of the host cell cycle. GFP, NS1-2 and NS5 RNA transcripts were translated into protein and detected from 15 to 24 hours post-G1 release (Fig 2A). The N-butyrate treated cells remained predominantly in G1 phase post-release while the mock-transfected cells came out of the G1 arrest, indicated by a decrease in the G0/G1 population and an increase in the S phase cells post-release (Fig 2C). Transfection of GFP and NS1-2 RNA had no effect on the transition of cells from G1 into S phase compared to the mock-transfected population, with both GFP and NS1-2 transfected populations progressing into S phase, with a substantial decrease in the G0/G1 population observed at 21 hours post-release, similar to the mock-transfected population (Fig 2C). In contrast, transfection of NS5 RNA induced a G1/S phase arrest, as indicated by cells remaining in the G1 phase post-release, with no increase in the S phase population. At 24 hours post-release in NS5 transfected populations, 73% of cells remained in the G0/G1 phase compared to 46% in the mock-transfected population (Fig 2C).",

In a G1 arrested population expression of cyclin A is low, indicated by undetectable levels of cyclin A in N-butyrate treated cells (Fig 2D). In mock-transfected, GFP and NS1-2 transfected populations, cyclin A expression increased from 18 to 24 hours post-release as cells entered S phase. In NS5 transfected cells, cyclin A levels remained below detectable limits post-release, as transfected cells remained in G0/G1 phase and did not progress into S phase.

It was hypothesized that the manipulation of the host cell cycle by NS5 could be driven by its association with host eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4G, leading to inhibition of host translation, as seen with plant VPg proteins [34], and thus potentially inducing a cell cycle arrest. The ability of MNV NS5 to bind to eIF4G can be abolished through the introduction of a phenylalanine to alanine substitution at position 123 (NS5(F123A)) [30]. Not only does the NS5(F123A) substitution inhibit binding to scaffold protein eIF4G, it abolishes viral replication. We predicted that the introduction of the NS5(F123A) substitution could inhibit its cell cycle control. RNA transcripts encoding WT NS5, NS5(F123A) and NS1-2 were generated, transfected into an asynchronous cell population and their cell cycle effects analyzed by flow cytometry. Both NS5 and NS5(F123A) could be detected by the \u03b1-NS5 antibody (Fig 3C).

Furthermore, the NS5(F123A) variant decreased cyclin A protein expression by 67% when compared to the mock-transfected population in a synonymous manner to NS5, strongly implying that the host eukaryotic initiation factor binding domain of NS5 does not play a role in its cell cycle manipulation (Fig 3D).",

Attachment of NS5 to viral RNA occurs via the tyrosine residue at position 26 (Y26) in MNV, lying within a highly conserved EYDE motif in caliciviruses [10, 35, 36]. Substitution of the Y26 residue with an alanine residue NS5(Y26A) prevents the formation of NS5-viral RNA [10, 37]. The nucleotidylation of NS5 at Y26 is likely contingent upon viral RNA polymerase (NS7), which is not present in the expression system used in this study. To further confirm that Y26 residue is not involved in the cell cycle arrest through an unidentified mechanism, an alanine substitution at Y26 was introduced (NS5(Y26)). Although the viral genome and NS7 protein is absent in the transfection, we could not exclude that NS5 could be attaching via the Y26 residue to host RNA. RNA encoding WT NS5, NS5(Y26A) and NS1-2 were synthesized, transfected into an asynchronous cell population and their cell cycle effects analyzed by flow cytometry. Both NS5 and NS5(Y26A) could be detected by the \u03b1-NS5 antibody (Fig 4C).

Furthermore, WT NS5 and NS5(Y26A) decreased cyclin A protein expression by 69% and 73% respectively when compared to the mock-transfected population (Fig 4D). These results, combined with the absence of viral RNA polymerase, imply that nucleotidylation to RNA via the Y26 residue has no role in NS5 ability to manipulate the host cell cycle.",

Changes to the host cell cycle post NS5 expression was nearly identical to that observed under MNV-1 infection with the G0/G1 population increasing by 24% and 28% and the corresponding S phase population decreasing by 26% and 27% respectively. Expression of NS5 alone was sufficient to induce an accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 phase and reduce cyclin A expression in an asynchronous population. Further confirmation of NS5 as the cell cycle regulator comes from analyzing the ability of NS5 to inhibit the G1/S transition and prevent cyclin A accumulating in a population progressing from G1 into S phase. These effects on the host cell cycle are consistent with the observed effects of MNV-1 infection, showing NS5 to be a causative agent of this cell cycle arrest.",

The NS5 protein from several caliciviruses has been documented to aid in viral protein translation, through binding to several host eukaryotic initiation factors and recruiting ribosomes to the site of viral replication [11, 30, 38\u201340]. The concentration of host eukaryotic initiation factors by VPg proteins is predicted to impair host translation [36]. Shut-off of host protein translation has been shown to induce cell cycle arrests in several cell phases including G1 and G2/M [41, 42]. We analyzed the impact on the host cell cycle of NS5 binding to host eukaryotic initiation factors through the introduction of an amino acid substitution that was known to impede binding to eIF4G [30]. The NS5(F123A) substitution had no effect on the ability of NS5 to induce a G1 arrest indicating an alternative mechanism is responsible for the cell cycle manipulation.",

While nucleotidylation of the NS5 Y26 residue is unlikely in the absence of viral RNA polymerase (NS7) we wanted to confirm that Y26 had no role in cell cycle arrest. Attachment to host RNA could result in changes in protein expression, leading to a cell cycle arrest. The NS5(Y26A) protein is unable to undergo the nucleotidylation reaction that attaches NS5 to viral RNA but still induced cell cycle changes in an analogous manner to WT NS5. This indicates that attachment to RNA via the Y26 residue is not the cause of cell cycle affects. MNV NS5 is indicated to be located in the perinuclear region, so an interaction with host DNA is unlikely [43]. Because the NS5(Y26A) and NS5(F123A) substitutions could still induce cell cycle control suggests that the NS5 induced G1/S arrest occurs through an as yet uncharacterized activity.",
