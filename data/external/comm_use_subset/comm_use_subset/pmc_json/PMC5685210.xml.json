However, in the year following its first autochthonous transmission in the Americas in 2015, ZIKV has been linked to severe congenital anomalies in newborns and to other neurological disorders such as Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) [2]. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the cluster of microcephaly cases and other neurological disorders possibly associated with ZIKV a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 1 February 2016 [3]. By the end of 2016, the unprecedented ZIKV outbreak affected 48 countries and territories in the Americas with more than half a million human cases [4]. The PHEIC was declared over on 18 November 2016 with the argument that ZIKV-associated congenital syndrome was considered to be a long-term public health challenge requiring a long-term commitment to control and prevent [4,5].",

            "text": "ZIKV is a mosquito-borne virus which belongs to the genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae [6]. Its genome can be detected in biological samples by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and the virus can be isolated in cell culture. However, viraemia is typically short-lived (3\u20137 days after onset of symptoms) [6-8], although an increased window of detection has been observed using urine (up to 20 days after onset of symptoms) [8] or whole blood (up to 100 days after onset of symptoms) [9]. Consequently, the full spectrum of diagnostics includes serology, which is complex owing to extensive cross-reactivity with antibodies triggered by other flaviviral infections and/or vaccination [10]. The majority of ZIKV infections are asymptomatic which complicates retracing the course of infection and increases the dependency on serology to confirm an infection [10]. This is in particular an issue for pregnant women for whom correct diagnosis of a ZIKV infection, even if asymptomatic, is imperative [2,11,12].",

Of these, one country had implemented ZIKV molecular diagnostics by January 2017 (Figure 1). In comparison to a February 2016 snapshot for the EC (data not shown), four more EU/EEA countries had implemented ZIKV molecular diagnostics in May. The coverage for ZIKV serology increased from 17 EU/EEA countries to 24. Access to ZIKV serology is particularly important because the confirmation or ruling out of a ZIKV infection during pregnancy is essential for medical follow-up regarding the teratogenicity of ZIKV [2,11,12]. As an estimated 80% of ZIKV infections are asymptomatic and the genome detection window in serum is short [10], ZIKV diagnosis in pregnant women will often rely on ZIKV antibody detection in paired serum samples.",

All laboratories conducting ZIKV serology indicated that they had experience with serodiagnostics for at least one other flavivirus. In addition, insight in the specificity and sensitivity of the serology tests used is required for proper test interpretation, but this appeared limited at the time of the questionnaire because adequate validation panels were lacking. Validation data provided by commercial entities typically need to be confirmed in order to be acceptable for an accreditation scheme [27]. Similarly, validation of such assays performed in another laboratory may be insufficient to meet with accreditation requirements. Indeed, the availability of validation panels for serology was indicated as the biggest challenge for implementation of ZIKV diagnostics by 21 of 44 ZIKV diagnostic laboratories. Five of the ZIKV diagnostic laboratories did not have any kind of ISO accreditation, while 17 of 44 laboratories did not have the most relevant ISO 15189 accreditation [27]. Another concern is the broad reliance for ZIKV serology on one or two commercial tests, although it should be noted that in May 2016, the commercial market for ZIKV serology offered very limited options. In December 2016, no commercial serology test had been accepted for procurement through the WHO Emergency Use Assessment and Listing procedure, which requires extensive validation [33]. This illustrates the importance of reference laboratory capacity. Virus neutralisation is still considered the most specific flavivirus serology test, although cross-reactivity can be observed in patients with other flavivirus infections and research is ongoing to develop more specific assays [10,31,32,34]. Broad implementation of this confirmatory test in EU/EEA national reference laboratories is, however, expected to increase the reliability of serology results in returning travellers as the flavivirus background (in particular dengue) in European travellers is likely to be low.",

Only one (Lanciotti et al. [25]) of the two in-house tests that were most frequently used, was recommended based on in silico analysis [10] and in an independent comparative study of ZIKV molecular tests [35], raising possible concerns about the performance of diagnostics in some laboratories. In November 2016, the ECDC-funded emerging viral disease laboratory expert network (EVD-LabNet [36]) organised an external quality assessment (EQA) for member laboratories which included the majority of the national reference laboratories with ZIKV diagnostics that participated in this questionnaire. The results from such an EQA will provide points of improvement to the individual laboratories [37].",

As shown for other diagnostics, the lack of information provided by clinicians requesting the diagnostics proved to be a major gap [24]. Although the date of sampling was given most often (40/44 scored \u2018often\u2019 or \u2018always\u2019), this information is hardly meaningful without an indication of the first day of illness (only scored in the highest categories by 27 laboratories). Reliable interpretation of ZIKV serology is impeded without information on previous flavivirus infections or vaccinations that was often/always available in only 17 of 44 laboratories. Reimbursements rules for the diagnostic tests differ between countries (data not shown). If the state covers the costs for the diagnostic tests, provision of necessary background information can be mandatory.",

At country level, the extent of under/overcapacities varied and were complicated by the fact that laboratories with certain ISO accreditations are bound by strict regulations when sending a surplus of samples to a backup laboratory. The availability of validation materials, positive controls and personnel were indicated as the main challenges for implementation of ZIKV diagnostics in the reference laboratories of the 30 EU/EEA countries. That 15 of 44 laboratories indicated the cost of commercial tests as an obstacle for test implementation and the large dependency of the laboratories on commercial assays, while five of 44 laboratories did not receive funding for development and/or implementation of in-house tests, illustrate an Achilles\u2019 heel in the preparedness for emerging infections and needs careful consideration when defining strategies to strengthen laboratory preparedness and response for future outbreak situations.",

All reference laboratories should seek to have a relevant ISO accreditation. Awareness and facilitation of (temporary) acceptance of laboratory accreditation for novel diagnostics implemented in emerging situations is required, although it is currently hampered by lack of availability of well-defined validation panels. Improved access is required to controls and validation panels for both molecular and serological tests. Pending the development of more specific serology tests, a broader implementation of the current most specific neutralisation tests (PRNT, VNT) is desirable, ideally in a comparative setting with other relevant flaviviruses. Increased awareness is needed among clinicians to provide all necessary background information, and systems should be implemented that assure provision of necessary interpretation data. National and/or EU contingency funding should be established to ensure adequate and robust laboratory preparedness and response.",
