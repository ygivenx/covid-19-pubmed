SARS and the emergence of avian influenza H5N1 galvanized political and public health communities to strengthen international, national and local preparedness and response capacities, and the emergence of H1N1 influenza has tested those responses. The International Health Regulations 2005 (IHR) represent an important international commitment to strengthening global capacity and acknowledge that law is part of the public health armamentarium underpinning cooperative national and international responses[2]. Whilst global disease surveillance capacity, in particular, has been considerably strengthened through the IHR, management of disease outbreaks, including pandemics, remains grounded in notions of national sovereignty. The same can be noted with regard to European co-operation, where regulations concerning surveillance and early warning are drafted with full respect for domestic law[3-6]. Harmonization of public health laws is not considered to be within the competence of the EU[7]. National systems of public health law are essential for influenza pandemic control, and international coherence will contribute to effective regional and global responses[1].",

Examples of proposed pandemic measures not supported by law included the use of unlicensed drugs, vaccines and health workers, closure of borders, control of media information and reporting, obligation of workers to work where there was risk to health and safety, compulsory isolation, quarantine, vaccination and prioritisation of people in access to vaccines and antivirals.",

Legal systems within Europe range from common law states (England and Wales, Ireland, Malta, Cyprus), to French style civil law states, German style civil law states and Scandinavian legal systems, to former Soviet Union states and one state, Turkey, with some influence from Islamic legal culture. These different legal systems may result in different understanding of what constitutes 'law'[12], and this was explored in the workshop discussion. Some states have laws, such as those in England and Wales and in Estonia, that are detailed and prescriptive. These laws tend to rely on lists of notifiable diseases, and public health measures can only be undertaken in relation to listed diseases. In other states public health laws are broadly framed allowing for the significant exercise of discretion. In Cyprus there are no specific laws governing measures such as quarantine but the Council of Ministers has powers to take all necessary measures. New laws in France allow the Minister of Health to take any measures that are proportionate to protect the public health.",

Several participants identified problems arising from a lack of expertise in public health law in their state, inhibiting implementation of pandemic planning.

There was some commonality across states in powers of social distancing, although again these were not always specified in laws and in some states would require authorisation by a political or public health authority. There was less commonality in relation to powers of compulsory screening, examination, vaccination and treatment. While some states' laws authorise compulsory vaccination and treatment, other states' laws prevent vaccination or treatment without consent. In Lithuania a person can only be detained for the purposes of treatment, with a focus on individual benefit rather than public health, while in other states, such as England and Wales, a person can be detained but cannot be compulsorily treated.
