Historically, there has never been a wide selection of effective antivirals, with only antivirals for human immunodeficiency virus4, hepatitis B5, hepatitis C6, influenza7, herpes and cytomegalovirus8 available in the clinic. The deficiencies in the development pipeline have been magnified in outbreaks of new pathogens, such as for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused by coronaviruses9, or the wider emergence of a known pathogen, such as the Ebola outbreak in West Africa10\u201312 and Zika virus in the Americas13. Particularly in the case of an emergency, it would be ideal to have a standard, ready-to-run platform for developing thousands of doses of a new antibiotic or antiviral against the emergent agent in a short time. If the new agents had a high probability of low toxicity and high efficacy it would decrease the time to their use in the emergency. Here we present a concept for developing antibiotics or antivirals in a systematic, potentially rapid manner based on the synbody technology and test its feasibility.",

Synbodies are bivalent peptides with antibody like features that are chemically synthesized. Two peptides that bind different regions of a chosen target, usually with low affinity and specificity, are linked to create a high affinity, high specificity reagent. The two arms of the synbody are chosen from a premade set of 10,000 peptides from random sequence space that are arrayed on slides. We felt the modular aspect of the synbodies might lend them to rapid production, particularly for a large number of doses in a short time. Additionally, the surface of viral and bacterial pathogens present repeating binding elements providing additional avidity between bivalent synbodies and targets on the surface of pathogens. Below we detail the concept and test the feasibility of its features to produce antibiotics and antivirals.",

            "text": "We have shown that bacteria18 and viruses20 can be applied to peptide microarrays to generate synbodies with antibiotic or antiviral activity. The challenge was to create a system to generate the synbodies quickly and provide sufficient quantities of the chosen synbody for in vivo testing. The key issue was that the published process involved applying the bacterial target to 10,000 peptide microarrays (10 K), choosing and testing target peptides, synthesis of large amounts of two or more candidate peptides, synthesis of synbodies and retesting. This process usually takes several months, with the rate-limiting step the synthesis and purification of large amounts of the candidate peptides. Our solution to this time issue was to pre-screen a large number of pathogens on the 10 K peptide microarray to arrive at 100 peptides that would offer sufficient diversity that any pathogen screened would bind two or more of peptides (Fig. 1A). By selecting peptides that are somewhat pathogen specific and others that are more broadly reactive, we should be able to select a reduced set of peptides with the potential to bind any new pathogen screened against these 100 peptides. It would then be practical to synthesize large stocks of these 100 peptides in advance so that 1,000 or more doses of a therapeutic could be produced quickly. Once the 100-peptide microarray was developed and the stocks synthesized it would be the starting point for the development of any therapeutic. As shown in Fig. 1B, a pathogen is incubated with the 100-peptide microarray and peptides binding it identified. These peptides are linked in all combinations to create lead synbodies, using the peptide and linker stocks. These leads are screened for activity against the target, preferably in blocking activity in an in vitro assay. Candidate synbodies are produced in large amounts, purified and tested in mice for acute toxicity and on red blood cells for hemolysis. The goal is to integrate the component steps so the whole process could be completed in 1 week.\n",

We then screened the 10 viruses and 11 bacteria (Supplementary Table S1) that had been previously tested on the 10 K array to verify binding to the appropriate pathogen. To increase confidence in the binding data, we changed the detection method for several bacterial pathogens, from AF-633/CTO labeling used in the 10 K array experiments to a dual membrane labeling approach using AF555 / AF647. Peptides that bound in both array detection methods were considered true hits.

Representative results from peptides binding to each pathogen are presented in Fig. 3B (Supplementary Fig. S2). As can be seen, some peptides showed high binding across all pathogens and all tested concentrations, indicating likely promiscuous or non-specific binding. However, other peptides had concentration dependent changes in pathogen binding. While absolute KD values could not be determined with this method as unpurified peptides were used, relative KD values could be estimated, with many peptides exhibiting concentration dependent binding. Peptides of this phenotype were classified as probable pathogen binders while non-specific binding or non-binding peptides were rejected. A total of 118 peptides passed this screening. In parallel with the binding assays, peptides were screened in an in vitro cytotoxicity assay using HEK293 cells. Peptides were screened at 0.25, 2.5 and 25 \u03bcM and the cell viability at 25 \u03bcM was plotted (Fig. 3C). Few peptides exhibited toxicity above the assay noise and those peptides with the highest toxicity were rejected. Based on these data the peptides were ranked by: (1) 275-peptide array binding (2) binding to 1 or more pathogens in ELISA and (3) by in vitro cytotoxicity. A total of 82 peptides showed binding in both binding assays and an additional 18 peptides showed binding in the peptide array only. Analysis of the peptides showed that there was a wide distribution of net charges and isoelectric points (Supplementary Fig. S3). Only 66% of this library is cationic in contrast to peptides in the antimicrobial peptide (AMP) database of which ~82% are cationic23. The 100 peptides were synthesized commercially (Sigma) at the 2-gram scale and purified to >95% purity (Supplementary Table S2).

Adenovirus is a non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA virus while rotavirus is a non-enveloped, double-stranded RNA virus. Each virus was labeled with AF555 and AF647 and tested using the same procedures as before. When the fluorescent signal across both channels is compared, it can be seen that multiple peptides bound each new pathogen (Fig. 4). There was correlation between both fluorescent dyes and binding peptides for a new pathogen could be easily identified. For example, peptides with relative fluorescence values >10,000 for both fluorophores could be selected as binding peptides for the new virus. In this way, multiple peptides could be selected for synbody construction. These data indicate that this array can potentially identify binding peptides for any given pathogen.\n",

As shown in Fig. 1B, a pathogen of interest is applied to the microarray and peptides selected based on the relative florescence. Seven to 10 peptides are selected and the 100 peptide stock used to synthesize all combinations of the peptides into synbodies. We developed a modular and combinatorial approach using maleimide-thiol conjugation to rapidly produce synbody libraries19\u201321 where selected peptides are conjugated to different peptide scaffolds, each with two conjugation sites, in a combinatorial manner and in parallel. With this approach, dozens or even hundreds of synbodies can be produced in a day. The synbodies are evaluated for their potency, efficacy, and toxicity with the best selected for production in large scale. Once the synbodies are produced they can be screened for pathogen binding by ELISA, in vitro activity in either growth inhibition assays for antibacterial or in plaque reduction assays for antiviral synbodies, red blood cell toxicity and kidney toxicity. Candidates that have high target binding, in vitro activity and low toxicity are then prepared on large scale (>100 mg) with the same chemistry and purified by HPLC. Parallel primary screening, rapid synbody production using stocks of pre-made peptides, and parallel activity and toxicity testing enable this system to produce synbodies candidates in a very rapid fashion.",

We screened H1N1 pdm09 on the 100-peptide array using the two color fluorescent labeling strategy. Based on the relative binding to pdm09 we selected 10 peptides (Fig. 5B) and tested these for the ability to bind hemagglutinin (HA) and inhibit hemagglutination by pdm09 of red blood cells with different concentrations (50 \u00b5M to 1.76 \u00b5M). Peptides p227, p149, and p125 inhibited hemagglutination. While p151, p204, p174, p228, p43, p107, and p58 bound A/CA/07/2009 on the peptide array, they did not prevent hemagglutination even in higher concentrations (50 \u00b5M) (data not shown). Based on HAI screening, peptides p227, p149, and p125 were used to prepare synbodies through pairwise conjugation to a previously developed synbody scaffold, Sc220. Each synbody was hydrolyzed to prevent thiol-exchange reactions that occur when maleimide conjugated peptides are exposed to excess thiols, such as in albumin19. Synbodies were tested in the HAI assay and p227-p227, p125-p149, p125-p125, and p149-p149 each exhibited inhibition at 0.781 \u00b5M (Fig. 5B). Finally, to test if the synbodies prevented viral cell entry, synbodies p125-p125, p227-p227, p125-p149, and a negative control synbody p151-p151, were tested in a plaque reduction assay (Fig. 5C). Cells treated with the neutralizing antibody had 100% inhibition while the synbodies exhibited a concentration dependent decrease in plaque formation. The IC50 for p227-p227, p125-p149, and p125-p125 were 0.45 \u00b5M, 0.34 \u00b5M, and 0.31 \u00b5M respectively. These synbodies were then tested for hemolysis at 125 \u00b5M, a concentration roughly 100 times the IC50, and exhibited less than 10% hemolysis (Supplementary Fig. S4) indicating low red blood cell toxicity. These data indicate that a new virus can be screened against the small peptide library to discover binding peptides that can be converted into neutralizing synbodies in a rapid manner.\n",

We then used the same system to produce a synbody with activity against a bacterium, S. epidermidis. While S. epidermidis is from the same genus as S. aureus used in the primary selection assay, there are large phenotypic differences between S. epidermidis and S. aureus as well as considerable intra strain variation24. As the peptides that were selected for the prototype 100 peptide microarray were designed to broadly bind pathogens rather than kill a specific bacteria, we used our previously demonstrated strategy of using a binding peptide conjugated to a killing peptide18 to produce synbodies for the proof-of-principle study. S. epidermidis was screened against the peptide array and 20 peptides selectively bound S. epidermidis but were predicted to have low killing activity based upon their AF/CTO ratio (Fig. 6A). These peptides were tested by MIC and they did not inhibit S. epidermidis growth at 50 uM (not shown). Therefore, we selected two positives binders (p52 and p104) and one negative control peptide (p42) and conjugated to an S. aureus lytic peptide19, called Ly, to produce a small synbody library that was then tested for inhibitory activity. We found that synbodies p42-Ly did not inhibit S. epidermidis growth at 50 uM, as expected, while p107-Ly, and p104-Ly inhibited bacterial growth with MICs of 12.5 \u00b5M, and 6.25 \u00b5M, respectively (Fig. 6B). Synbodies were then tested for hemolysis at 125 uM and no hemolysis was observed (Supplementary Fig. S3).

We first developed a 100-peptide microarray, with peptides that would bind one or more pathogens. To do this we screened 21 diverse bacteria and viruses on a 10,000 peptide microarray. Over 1% of the peptides on the array bound multiple pathogens, with some lytic to bacteria, and these were chosen for further screening. These peptides were synthesized and assessed for binding the pathogen panel by ELISA-type binding and for in vitro toxicity to human cells. A library of 100 peptides were chosen, synthesized and purified on large scale. These peptides were printed on small microarrays and were the core for the rapid screening. A system for rapidly synthesizing and screening synbodies was demonstrated. As a demonstration project synbodies against influenza virus that is effective in vitro were produced and the same process was used to produce an antibiotic against S. epidermis in one week which inhibited growth at 6.25 \u00b5M.",

This allowed us to pre-stock large amounts of peptides for combinatorial production of the synbodies. Of note, the cost of synthesis of peptides has decreased notably and economies of scale enable the commercial production of numerous peptide therapeutics25. The second new feature was the development of a system for the rapid synthesis and screening of candidate synbodies. This required the optimization of the conjugation chemistry. The third new aspect was the incorporation of rapid toxicity screening.",

That this was true implies that pathogens as diverse as bacteria and viruses have overlapping chemical diversity. All the pathogens screened were infectious agents. It is possible that being a human pathogen and evolving against the human immune systems constrains the surface diversity of any pathogen. Analysis of the 100 peptide sequences did not reveal any obvious trends or common motifs that would suggest targeting a specific pathogen through homology with a natural receptor. Alternatively, the 100 peptides are predicted to lack secondary structure given the random amino acid distribution and length, and therefore could bind other targets with comparable affinity but through a different mechanism of action.

The virus binding to peptides would be detected using labeled anti-Ebola antibody with the total assay time of less than 1 day. This process would identify ~10 peptides that would be used to create a panel of synbodies. Conjugation reactions of synbodies would be performed in parallel and proceed to completion within a few hours. Purification of synbodies is performed by HPLC in parallel and these synbodies could be screened for binding inactivated Ebola virus in a BSL2 facility. Cell toxicity and hemolysis screening could be done in parallel. Positive candidates would then have to be screened for inactivation of virus in a cell-based assay that would require BSL4 containment. Two or more of the best candidates could then be synthesized from the large stocks and purified.

Though even dangerous pathogens can be screened in BSL2 facilities if killed, the activity screens would have to be conducted with live pathogen at higher containment. Screening with killed or viable viruses probably will not matter. However, a screen with killed bacteria would not discriminate lytic peptides. In this case it may require attaching a bacterial killing element to the binding synbody. For example, we, and others, have explored using ligands to recruit existing antibodies to pathogens26\u201328. Finally, the synbodies as produced by this process would probably not be orally administrable unless further formulated. However, they may be used by intravenous injection. Possibly the biggest concern for employing this system is that the product is a peptide-based therapeutic. While antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have a poor track record in producing clinical products29 antibiotics such as daptomycin, vancomycin, and colistin are peptidic. Additionally, the clinically approved HIV fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide is a 36-aa peptide with an elimination half-life of 3.8 hours30. There are many standard methods for improving the protease stability of peptide therapeutics, including the incorporation of D-amino acids19,20, and would be used in future implementations of the system.",

Clearly, cost would be a major concern for the broad use of antibodies. In this regard, synbodies may have an advantage in that they should be less expensive to chemically synthesize than biologically produced antibodies. A unique feature of the use of the peptide synbody scaffold is that the same platform can produce synbodies with direct antibiotic or antiviral activity and should be useful for primary and secondary infections.",

With a scaled pre-investment, even a wider selection of peptide candidates could be used on the selection microarray and more doses of each candidate made. Some of the features demonstrated here, for example the rapid synthesis of a large number of synbody candidates, could also be used in standard approaches to therapeutic development. Alternatively, parallel advances in high density peptide microarray synthesis33\u201338 and rapid peptide synthesis39, could dramatically increase the diversity of the peptide screening and decrease time to synthesize the resulting hits. These emerging technologies could eliminate the need for library pre-synthesis and yet maintain the speed of the discovery platform, increasing the potential for this approach.",
