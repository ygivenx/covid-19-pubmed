The main symptoms were fever, cough, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, and radiographic evidence of pneumonia [2\u20134]. Human-to-human transmission of NCIP has been reported, even in the incubation period [5\u20137]. In a hospital, 29% of health care workers and 12% of patients who were already hospitalized for other reasons have been identified as presumed hospital-related transmission and infection [4]. The NCIP has spread worldwide and many countries have reported cases of NCIP [8\u201311]. As of February 11, 2020, 44,672 cases with NCIP were confirmed and 1023 cases died in China [12]. The WHO has declared the outbreak of NCIP as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on January 30, 2020.",

We screened all the patients with NCIP in two hospitals (Yongchuan Hospital of Chongqing Medical University and Chongqing Public Health Medical Center) from January 1st to March 4th, 2020. The NCIP patients who required HFNC, NIV or invasive ventilation to improve oxygen were classified as severe acute respiratory failure.

We gradually increased the time of standard oxygen and shortened the duration of HFNC until the HFNC was totally weaned.

The virus is believed transmitted mostly via droplets or contact and possibly via aerosol [18]. All people are generally susceptible to the virus. As of February 11, 2020, 1716 clinical staff have been infected with NCIP, and 5 of them died [12]. Therefore, a device that produces lesser number of droplets or aerosol is required. The exhaled air dispersion produced by HFNC was limited and the risk of hospital-acquired infection did not increase [19, 20]. Therefore, the use of HFNC in NCIP patients is feasible. However, the amount of condensation in the circuit increased when the ambient temperature decreased [21]. The condensed water became an important source of infection for NCIP. So, avoidance or reduction of condensation was very important when the HFNC was used.",

Among the NIV patients who experienced HFNC failure, the intubation rate was 64%. However, in our study, 41% of patients experienced HFNC failure. Among the unsuccessful patients, all of them directly switched to NIV (no one directly switched to intubation). It means that the physicians who managed the NCIP patients were more likely to use NIV than intubation when the HFNC was unable to maintain the oxygenation. We speculated that the process of intubation made the physicians at high risk of infection because of the close encounter and irritable cough. However, among the patients with HFNC failure in our study, only 29% received intubation. This indicates that the success rate is high after transition to NIV.",

However, this study can reflect on how the HFNC has been used in the real world among the NCIP patients. In addition, we only enrolled 17 patients in this study as the enrollment period is short. To our knowledge, there are no studies that report on how the HFNC was used in NCIP patients. Rapid publication is very important for public health.
