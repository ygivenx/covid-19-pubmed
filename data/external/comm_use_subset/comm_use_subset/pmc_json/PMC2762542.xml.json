            "text": "The lung is exposed to many challenges, both environmental and pathogenic. Defense of this portal must be tightly regulated so that appropriate immune responses to pathogens are mounted but responses to innocuous antigens are minimized. Alveolar macrophages (AM) play a central role in maintaining this immunological homeostasis [1],[2],[3]. In the lung, resident AMs are continuously encountering inhaled substances due to their exposed position in the alveolar lumen, but they are kept in a quiescent state. They function poorly as accessory cells for in vitro T cell activation [4],[5] and in many situations actively suppress the induction of adaptive immunity through their effects on alveolar and interstitial DCs and T cells [6],[7],[8]. In vivo elimination of alveolar macrophages using clodronate-filled liposomes (CL) leads to overt inflammatory reactions to otherwise harmless particulate and soluble antigens [9]. Alveolar macrophages adhere closely to alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) at the alveolar wall and are separated by a distance of only 0.2\u20130.5 \u00b5m from rDCs [6]. In macrophage-depleted mice, DCs have enhanced antigen-presenting function [6]. It has been estimated that the pool of murine alveolar macrophages can process up to 109 intratracheally injected bacteria before there is \u201cspillover\u201d of bacteria to DCs and before adaptive immunity is induced [10].",

During infection with respiratory pathogens, such as influenza virus, antigen is acquired by respiratory dendritic cells (rDCs) and these cells must be sufficiently activated to overcome anti-inflammatory factors in the lungs. These rDCs then migrate to the lung draining lymph nodes (DLN) to initiate an antiviral CD8 T cell response [11],[12]. After the interaction of naive T cells with such antigen-bearing DCs, CD8 and likely CD4 T cells undergo activation and division in the DLNs and migrate into the lungs to eliminate virus-infected cells, leading to resolution of the infection [13],[14],[15]. Recently, a secondary peripheral interaction of CD8 T cells with antigen-bearing rDCs in the lung was found important for effective antiviral immunity [16]. Overall rDC activation is a prerequisite for initiation and maintenance of the immune response.",

            "text": "Patients with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV), developed mild to fatal pulmonary disease, with a mortality incidence of 10% [17]. Patients with worse outcomes generally exhibited a more protracted clinical course, characterized by the development of Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), as well as lymphopenia, neutrophilia and prolonged cytokine production [17],[18],[19],[20]. Virus could be detected in nasopharyngeal aspirate and feces for as long as 21 days after disease onset [19],[21]. Delayed virus clearance may have resulted from suboptimal T and B cell responses; suboptimal neutralizing antibody responses are detected in patients with severe disease [17],[18],[19],[20]. Numerous studies demonstrated that SARS-CoV infection fails to activate macrophages and dendritic cells. Although these cells can be infected, they are functionally impaired: antiviral cytokines such as type I interferon were not expressed and endocytic capacity (antigen capture) was compromised ([22],[23],[24],[25],[26],[27],[28] and reviewed in [29]). These unusual findings raised the possibility that initial infection with the virus resulted in delayed or suboptimal activation of the innate immune system. Inefficient activation of rDCs might be unable to counter the potent anti-inflammatory factors that are normally present in the lung, resulting in both a deficient T cell response and delayed kinetics of virus clearance.",

Here, we demonstrate that lethal disease in mice infected with a mouse-adapted strain of SARS-CoV (MA15) can be prevented if AMs with anti-inflammatory properties are depleted from the lung prior to infection. Treatment with toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists to activate rDCs or transfer of activated bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC) also prevents a lethal outcome. Together, these results demonstrate that SARS-CoV, by inefficiently activating the immune system, uses a novel mechanism to evade immune recognition.",

Similarly, MA15 infection in vitro did not result in upregulation of CD86 on AM (Fig. S2, Gating shown in Fig. S1 A). To determine whether inhibitory AMs play a role in MA15-mediated severe lung disease, we depleted these cells by intranasal administration of clodronate liposomes (CL). CL are useful for depletion of AM, and to a lesser extent, alveolar/airway DCs [9], but intranasal administration does not affect the level of circulating macrophages [32]. As a control, we treated mice with PBS as described previously [33].",

We next examined lung sections for changes in histology. There were no histological differences in the lungs between CL-treated and control mice at day 0, indicating that depletion of AMs did not result in significant inflammatory cell recruitment to the lung. From day 2 p.i., PBS-treated mice developed a rapidly progressive interstitial pneumonia with extensive edema and damage to bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells (Fig. 1 C). Inflammatory infiltrates were consistently identified from days 2-to 6 p.i. CL-treated mice had a much better outcome with less destruction of the pulmonary architecture, but extensive alveolar, interstitial and perivascular inflammatory cell infiltration (Fig. 1 C, day 4 and day 6). Total lung cell numbers are shown in Fig. 2 A. Clodronate treatment, by removing AM, also altered the inflammatory milieu of the lungs. As a consequence, levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as IL-1\u03b2, Il-6, IL-12, CCL2 and CCL3 increased within 24 hours of CL, but not PBS treatment, prior to virus infection. By day 2 p.i., levels of these cytokines were generally similar in CL and PBS-treated mice, consistent with the notion that a delayed, and possibly dysregulated, immune response contributed to severe disease in control mice (Table S1).",

            "text": "Infection with respiratory viruses such as influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) results in recruitment of CD11c+MHC II+ DCs to the lung [12],[35],[36],[37]. Unlike these infections, recruitment of inflammatory cells, including DCs, to the lung is impaired in MA15-infected mice (Fig. 2 A). The total lung cell number increased slightly, but there was no appreciable change in numbers of the respiratory dendritic cells (rDC) in control mice. Clodronate treatment resulted in enhancement of inflammatory cell recruitment to the lung (Fig. 1 C and 2 A), with a nearly tenfold increase in numbers of rDCs within 6 days (Fig. 2 A). For these experiments, we distinguished two populations of rDCs: alveolar/airway dendritic cells (aDC: CD11c+CC11b\u2212MHC II+) and interstitial dendritic cells (iDC: CD11c+CD11b+MHC II+) using the gating strategy shown in Fig. S1. By day 4 p.i., the frequencies of MHC IIhigh/CD86+ and MHC IIhigh/CD40+ aDC and iDC increased significantly in drug-treated mice but only modestly on iDC and not at all on aDC in PBS-treated mice Over the next few days aDCs and iDCs remain activated in CL-treated mice but mostly returned to a baseline state in control mice (Fig. 2 B and C). Concomitant with this recruitment and activation of rDCs, we also observed enhanced rDC migration to draining lymph nodes (DLN), using a tracking method in which rDCs are labeled in the lung by i.n. inoculation of carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) (see Materials and Methods and Fig. S1 B for gating) [12]. In all mice, rDC migration to the DLNs peaked at 18 h p.i., but migration was accelerated by treatment with clodronate. After 48 hours the frequency and number of CFSE+ rDCs in the DLNs decreased suggesting that the first 48 h p.i. were most important period for rDC migration. There was also a two-three fold increase in total cell numbers in the DLNs (Fig. 2 D). Collectively, these results show that DCs remained activated for longer times in the lung and exhibited enhanced migration to DLNs after CL treatment. A consequence of the increase in both numbers of rDCs and the frequency that was activated was a 30\u201350 fold increase in total activated DCs in the lung.",

Some of these epitopes were described previously, but S521 and S1061 epitopes were newly discovered. Of note, all other previously described H-2d-restricted T cell epitopes were not recognized by lung-derived T cells in our assays [40],[41],[42]. These previous reports identified T cell epitopes using adenovirus vectors or DNA constructs expressing single SARS-CoV proteins, or isolated peptides. We speculate that the numbers of T cells recognizing these previously described epitopes are present at very low levels in infected mice compared to the immunodominant epitopes that we identify, possibly because of differences in antigen presentation between infected and immunized mice.",

Further, surface levels of CD200R, important in maintaining lung homeostasis, were higher on AM than peritoneal macrophages [44] (Fig. S5) and were not significantly downregulated after infection (Fig. 4 A), indicating that AMs continued to be inhibitory even after the onset of the infection.

To examine this possibility, we co-cultured AMs and T cells in vitro. Concanavalin A (Con A) and soluble anti-CD3 (sCD3) antibody treatment of lung cells resulted in proliferation of both CD4 and CD8 T cells as measured by CFSE dilution. This proliferation was almost completely inhibited by co-culture with purified AMs at a ratio of 10\u22361 (10 T cells\u22361 AM) (Fig. 4 D). Of note, endogeous AMs were removed from the lung cell preparations by incubation in a tissue culture plate for 2 h (90% depletion, measured by flow cytometry). In the absence of this prior incubation, no robust proliferation was observed. To assess the effect of AM on virus-specific T cells, we isolated CD8 T cells from MA15-infected, CL-treated mouse lungs at day 8 p.i. using microbeads and stained them with CFSE. Cells were then stimulated for 72 hours with lung cells or splenocytes that were pulsed with three MA15-specific CD8 T cell peptides (S366/S521/S1061) with or without AMs. Although only about 30% of CD8 T cells were MA15-specific, proliferation of CD8 T cells was clearly detected. When co-cultured with AMs, CD8 T cell proliferation was totally inhibited (Fig. 4 E). Thus, AMs inhibited both nonspecific and specific CD8 T cell proliferation. However, AM co-culture in vitro did not inhibit IFN-\u03b3 expression after stimulation with MA15-specific peptides (Fig. S6 A), consistent with previous data, showing that AMs did not inhibit IL-2 secretion by Con A-stimulated T cells [45]. Further, when AMs and T cells were separated by a transwell during co-culture, no significant decrease of proliferation was observed as measured by CFSE dilution (Fig. S6 B) suggesting that AM inhibition of T cell proliferation required direct cell contact.",

            "text": "The results described above raised the possibility that direct activation of rDCs in the lung or adoptive transfer of activated DCs to the lung would bypass AM inhibitory function. Signaling through Toll-like receptors (TLR) results in a series of signaling events that leads to the induction of an acute inflammatory response. Ligand binding to TLRs also results in dendritic cell maturation, which is necessary for the initiation of adaptive immune responses [46],[47],[48]. Previous reports showed that Poly I:C or CpG treatment protected animal from lethal virus infection, but the mechanism of protection was not investigated in those studies [49],[50]. In preliminary experiments, we treated mice with ligands for several TLRs, including poly I:C (TLR3), LPS (TLR4), CpG (TLR9), R837(TLR7), R848 (TLR7/8), Pam3CSK4 (TLR1/2), and Pam2CSK4 (TLR2/6). We observed that treatment with poly I:C (Fig. 5 A) and, to a lesser extent, CpG (data not shown), but not the other TLR ligands, protected mice from lethal disease. Consequently, additional analyses were performed after treatment with poly I:C and as a control, LPS since both are widely used to stimulate macrophages and DCs [51]. Poly I:C (20 \u00b5g/mouse)-treated mice lost about 10% of their original weight but quickly recovered within 7 days. The LPS-treated group (5 \u00b5g/mouse), lost more than 20% of their weight with death occurring in all mice within 6\u20137 days. Virus titers were higher at day 5 in the lungs of these mice compared to mice treated with poly I:C (Fig. 5 B).",

Nearly twenty fold more MA15-specific T cells were detected in the lungs of poly I:C treated mice compared to LPS recipients at day 7 p.i. and these cells were functional in in vivo killing assays (Fig. 5 E and F). To determine whether poly I:C or LPS directly activated AMs, AMs were isolated and stimulated in vitro with both agonists. After 24 h stimulation, poly I:C but not LPS treatment resulted in a pronounced upregulation of CD86 (Fig. 6 A). Further, treatment with poly I:C but not LPS partially reversed the ability of AM to inhibit CD8 T cell proliferation after stimulation with Con A or sCD3 (Fig. 6 B).

            "text": "Given these results, direct delivery of activated DCs to the lungs might overcome AM-mediated inhibition. Activated DCs exhibit an enhanced ability to migrate to DLNs and to stimulate CD8 T cell proliferation and IFN-\u03b3 expression [52],[53],[54],[55]. Since AMs were unable to inhibit costimulatory molecule expression on previously activated DCs (Fig. 7 A), we next assessed whether adoptively transferred activated DCs could bypass AM inhibition and protect mice from a lethal MA15 infection. For this purpose, bone marrow cells were harvested from na\u00efve mice, and DCs selectively cultured by treatment with GM-CSF plus IL-4 for 6 days [56]. BMDCs were then activated with either LPS or poly I:C, which resulted in enhanced CD86 and MHC class II expression on BMDCs (Fig. 7 B). As expected, MA15 was unable to activate these cells. 3\u00d7105 activated or resting BMDCs were transferred to mice i.n. 18 h prior to infection. Mice that received BMDCs activated with either poly I:C or LPS were protected from a fatal outcome, although they still lost about 15% of their body weight. In marked contrast, recipients of resting BMDC were not protected (Fig. 7 C). Further, higher virus titers were detected in the lungs at day 5 mice that received resting BMDC as opposed to activated BMDC (Fig. 7 D). BMDC migration from the lungs to DLNs was accelerated by prior activation. More CFSE+ activated BMDC than resting BMDC accumulated in the DLNs of recipient mice (Fig. 8 A and B) and additionally, the total number of cells in the DLNs was increased dramatically by activated BMDC transfer (Fig. 8 B). Consistent with enhanced rDC migration to the DLNs, recipients of activated BMDCs developed more robust CD4 and CD8 T cell responses in the lungs when compared to those that received resting BMDC (Fig. 8 C and D). Nearly tenfold more MA15-specific T cells were detected in the lungs of activated BMDC compared to resting BMDC recipients at day 7 p.i. and these cells were functional in in vivo killing assays (Fig. 8 E). Collectively, these results indicate that adoptive transfer of activated BMDCs to the lung amplified virus specific T cell responses, cleared virus earlier and protected mice from lethal MA15 infection.",

The results presented herein suggest that this severe disease may occur in part because infected individuals do not mount an appropriate anti-virus T cell response. Anti-virus CD8 T cells are critical for virus clearance in mice infected with other pathogens, such as influenza A virus and LCMV [15],[59], so it is not unexpected that they are necessary for resolution of infection with SARS-CoV. While lymphopenia is associated with a worse prognosis in SARS patients [17],[18],[19], no prior studies, to our knowledge, has shown that this poor prognosis results, in part, from a sub-optimal CD8 T cell response. This defect in development of a protective T cell response occurs because the virus does not reverse the anti-inflammatory state that is naturally present in the uninfected lung. These results are consistent with in vitro studies in which the SARS-CoV is able to infect but can not activate human DCs or macrophages [22],[23],[24],[25],[26],[27],[28]. This may occur, in part, because coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, are \u201cinvisible\u201d to cellular sensors in some cell types [29].",

Several molecules, including nitric oxide, TGF-\u03b2 and CD200R have been implicated in AM suppressive function. These molecules have either short half lives or require cell-to-cell contact [1],[44],[60],[61]. Consistent with this, AMs are separated by a distance of only 0.2\u20130.5 \u00b5m from rDCs in the lung [10]. Our results also suggest that cell contact or close proximity to target cells is required, because AMs were unable to suppress T cell proliferation if separated from responders by a transwell membrane (Fig. S6 B). In another mechanism that maintains an anti-inflammatory state in the lungs, AMs ingest and process innocuous antigen and bacteria before they can reach and activate rDCs [10]. AM depletion results in enhanced antigen-presenting function by rDCs [6] and in increased ability to lyse influenza A virus-infected cells [62].",

We used three approaches to support this conclusion. First, pre-treatment of MA15-infected mice with clodronate depleted AM, resulting in enhanced activation and migration of rDCs, which in turn led to the development of a vigorous and protective virus-specific T cell response in the lung (Fig. 2 and 3). The activation and migration of rDCs at early times p.i. are critical for the timely initiation of anti-SARS-CoV T cell responses. Consistent with this, treatment with clodronate at day 2 p.i. was not protective (Fig. 1), because rDC migration to the DLNs is largely complete by 48 hours p.i. ((Fig. 2 D) and [12]). Depletion at day 2 p.i. resulted in more severe disease, suggesting that in SARS-CoV-infected mice, virus-specific T cells require additional DC stimulation in the lungs, as occurs in influenza A-infected animals [16].",

Our results showed that only poly I:C, a TLR3 agonist, and to a lesser extent CpG, a TLR9 agonist, were able to perform this function. TLR7 is primarily located on plasmacytoid DCs and the inability of R848 to protect mice indicates that activation of these cells was insufficient to induce a protective immune response. Poly I:C, which activated AMs and rDC in vivo (Fig. 5 C and S7) and in vitro (Fig. 6 A), protected animals from lethal MA15 infection. The ability of poly I:C to stimulate rDC activation and migration has been described previously [12], and is likely to explain its protective ability. It should be noted that poly I:C treatment also induced type 1 IFN expression in the lung. This may also have contributed to the protective effect of poly I:C, but this is not likely to be the major effect because SARS-CoV is only modestly sensitive to IFN treatment of cultured cells or of mice [63],[64]. In addition, CL treatment did not induce type 1 IFN in the lungs, showing that IFN induction is not required for protection (data not shown).",

While DC maturation makes these cells the most potent in antigen presentation in an animal, it also results in the loss of ability to take up antigen. However, antigen macropinocytosis is transiently stimulated after activation [52], possibly explaining how transferred BMDC could acquire SARS-CoV antigen for presentation to T cells in the DLNs. Alternatively, mature DCs are able to uptake antigen for cross-presentation [68]. Activated BMDCs preferentially migrated to the DLNs (Fig. 8 A and B) and initiated a protective T cell response in the lungs (Fig. 8 C\u2013E). This transfer was successful because inhibitory AMs cannot reverse prior rDC activation (Fig. 7 A). All of these three experimental interventions resulted in enhanced rDC migration to the DLNs, enhanced MA15-specific T cell responses at the site of infection, the lungs, and improved outcomes.",

We have also shown that MA15 does not efficiently induce costimulatory molecule upregulation on murine rDCs or AM in vivo and/or in vitro (Fig. 2 C, 4 A and S2). However, while most viruses have mechanisms to evade host recognition sensors, they still efficiently induce an immune response. For example, successful resolution of influenza A virus infections requires activation of immune responses via TLR7, RIG-I and NLR (NOD-like receptors) inflammasome pathways [70], even though influenza A virus encodes an immune-evading protein, nsp1 [71]. HSV, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, hepatitis C virus, RSV and human cytomegalovirus are recognized via TLR2-dependent mechanisms while the RSV F protein activates cells via a TLR4-dependent mechanism [37]. Some viruses, such as vaccinia virus, directly inhibit TLR expression, confirming the importance of these molecules in virus recognition by the host [72]. TLR signaling is also important for SARS-CoV recognition by the innate immune system, since C57BL/6 mice, which are very resistant to the virus, become susceptible when MyD88 is genetically deleted [69]. The precise TLR or other receptor required for protection in C57BL/6 mice is not known at present. Why this same pathway is not efficiently induced in BALB/c mice after MA15 infection will be an area of future investigation.",

Further, lethal disease can be prevented if AMs with anti-inflammatory properties are depleted from lungs prior to infection. Depletion results in enhanced DC recruitment to the lung and accelerated migration to DLN, and a more vigorous anti-SARS-CoV T cell response. Treatment with TLR agonists to activate AMs and rDCs or transfer of activated BMDCs also prevents a lethal outcome. Together, these results demonstrate that SARS-CoV, by \u201chiding\u201d from the immune system, uses a novel mechanism to evade immune recognition in mice.

At day 7 p.i., single cell suspensions were prepared from lungs, and stimulated with SARS-CoV CD8 (S366, S521 and S1061) or CD4 (N353) T cell peptides for 6 h in the presence of brefeldin. Cells were analyzed for IFN-\u03b3 expression A. Frequency (C) and numbers (D) of MA15-specific T cells are shown. Data are representative of two independent experiments and are the mean values\u00b1SEM (n = 6\u20137 mice/group/time point). (E) In vivo cytotoxicity assays were performed on day 6 p.i. Target cells were co-stained with PKH26 and different concentrations of CSFE, pulsed with/without SARS-CoV specific CD8 T cell peptides, mixed together (1\u00d7106 in total) and transferred i.n. to mice. 12 h after transfer, lung cells were examined by flow cytometry. n = 3\u20134 mice/group. Data are representative of two independent experiments.",
