            "text": "Positive-strand RNA viruses comprise over one third of all virus genera and include important human pathogens such as hepatitis C virus, dengue virus, chikungunya virus, and West Nile virus [15]. Brome mosaic virus (BMV), a member of the alphavirus-like superfamily of human, plant, and animal viruses, has been used as a model system to study gene expression, RNA replication and virus-host interactions of positive-strand RNA viruses [1], [2], [8], [10], [16]. BMV has three genomic RNAs and one subgenomic (sg) mRNA. Genomic RNAs 1 and 2 encode the multifunctional replication proteins 1a and 2a polymerase (2aPol), respectively, which are required for RNA replication [17], [18], [19]. Genomic RNA3 encodes the 3a movement protein, required for infection spread in plants. A sg mRNA, RNA4, encodes the viral coat protein and is produced from the (\u2212)RNA3 replication intermediate. BMV RNA replication and encapsidation can be recapitulated in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by expressing the viral replication and/or capsid proteins together with at least one genomic RNA template [20], [21], [22]. The ability of BMV to duplicate nearly all major replication features of its natural plant hosts in yeast, combined with yeast genetics, has advanced our understanding of BMV replication and virus-host interactions [1], [2], [9].",

However, classical yeast genetics and other approaches have demonstrated that genes essential for cell growth also make major contributions to BMV RNA replication [23], [24], [25], [26]. To more globally identify additional essential host factors critical for BMV RNA replication, we assayed a doxycycline (dox)-repressible library of \u223c900 yeast strains, each of which allows repressing the expression of a selected essential gene by adding dox to growth media [27]. Using this genome-wide approach, we identified 24 essential host factors whose repressed expression reproducibly altered BMV RNA replication. These host factors are involved in protein homeostasis, protein trafficking, and translation, among others. The results presented here, in conjunction with previously identified host factors [2], [8], [10], [24], [25], provide a more complete understanding of cellular pathways utilized by BMV. Dissecting the role of these essential host genes in virus replication should significantly advance our understanding of basic virus biology and virus-host interactions. Additionally, these results may lay a foundation for extending such studies to other virus groups, thus potentially identifying common cellular pathways that could be targeted for the development of broad-spectrum antivirals.",

To construct pB3BG29, the AgeI-AatII RNA3/Rluc-containing fragment of pB3Rluc [9] replaced the AgeI-AatII FHV RNA1/Rluc-containing fragment of pBDL250-Ren [B. Lindenbach, unpublished]. pB3MS82 expresses a BMV RNA3 derivative in which the coat protein gene has a four-nucleotide insertion and a point mutation, abolishing expression of the coat protein [30]. The use of pB3MS82 in this study, as in many other studies [8], [19], [30], [31], [32], [33], allows analysis of RNA3 and RNA4 levels while avoiding any possible effects of coat protein expression and RNA encapsidation. pB12VG1 and pB3BG29 were used in reporter gene-based primary screens and pB12VG1 and pB3MS82 were used in secondary validation testing by Northern blotting.",

DNA-dependent transcription produces an initial (+)RNA3 transcript that serves as a template for 1a- and 2aPol-dependent RNA3 replication and sgRNA4 synthesis via a (\u2212)RNA3 intermediate (Fig. 1A). Because sgRNA4, which encodes the coat protein, is derived from the (\u2212)RNA3 intermediate, its synthesis depends on, and can serve as a reporter for, BMV RNA replication [20]. Accordingly, in pB3BG29 we replaced the coat protein ORF with the Rluc reporter gene, so that luciferase assays could be used as a rapid measure of RNA4 production and expression (Fig. 1A). A similar approach was used for primary screening of the yeast non-essential gene deletion library [9]. Of the 892 dox-repressible strains transformed, 151 did not produce colonies after repeated transformation attempts (Table S1), suggesting that the transformation process or expression of the viral constructs significantly impacted the fitness of these strains.",

Strains were grown in raffinose-containing selective medium lacking dox (allowing essential gene expression) or raffinose-containing selective medium containing 10 \u00b5g/ml dox (repressing essential gene expression) for 24 hr to allow for initial depletion of the essential gene mRNA and protein turnover in strains treated with dox. After this 24 hr treatment period, strains were sub-cultured into galactose-containing selective medium \u00b110 \u00b5g/ml dox to induce the expression of BMV components and subsequent viral RNA replication in the continued expression (untreated) or repression (dox-treated) of essential host factors. At 24 hr and 48 hr post-virus induction, Rluc expression was measured as a readout of BMV RNA3 replication and sgRNA4 synthesis. Because of expected differences in the kinetics of gene product depletion and their specific and non-specific effects on cell growth and BMV RNA replication, we measured Rluc at 24 hr and 48 hr post-virus induction for every strain. To monitor any potential adverse effects of dox on the viability of these yeast strains and to ensure that GAL promoter induction was effective, GAL driven Fluc expression, which is independent of BMV RNA replication (Fig. 1A), was also assayed at 24 hr and 48 hr post-virus induction (Fig. 1B). Two independent analyses of the entire library were performed.",

Additionally, because we expected some strains to exhibit either immediate dox-induced growth defects and/or transcriptional defects from the GAL promoter, Fluc values in untreated vs. dox-treated strains were closely monitored. Accordingly, to be included in the final data analysis for potentially specific effects on BMV replication, each strain was required to: 1) double at least twice between 0\u201324 hr in galactose-containing media; 2) double at least one additional time between 24\u201348 hr in galactose-containing media; 3) and have an Flucdox-treated value within 20% of its Flucuntreated value. As a reference, wild type strain R1158 doubled 3 times between 0\u201324 hr and 2 times between 24\u201348 hr and had comparable Flucuntreated and Flucdox-treated values. Strains that did not meet these growth or Fluc value requirements in both passes were excluded from further analysis (Tables S2 and S3). The remaining strains that satisfied these growth and Fluc requirements and were included in analysis (Table S4) showed >90% overlap between pass 1 and 2 at the 24 hr time point and >80% overlap between passes at the 48 hr time point, confirming good reproducibility of screen conditions (e.g. growth, dox-treatment, etc.) and assay performance.",

A more stringent 6-fold cutoff was used in the primary screen in response to our observation that some strains in this essential gene library showed more luciferase assay variability than in our previous screen of non-essential genes. This increased variability is likely due to the fact that these genes are essential for cell growth. Thus, upon dox-induced repression of these genes, the experiment is a race between specific effects of the relevant gene on virus replication and the nonspecific, general suppression of cell growth and viability that eventually occur with each strain. Therefore, the results are more subject to variations due to small changes in growth conditions or timing of the experiments. Accordingly, a 6-fold cutoff was employed to limit the inclusion of false positives.",

The levels of RNA3 and RNA4 replication products then were measured by Northern blotting. In particular, we used the level of RNA4 relative to 18S rRNA as the primary measure of any dox-induced change in BMV RNA-dependent RNA synthesis, through the ratio [RNA4/18S rRNA]dox-treated/[RNA4/18S rRNA]untreated. RNA4 was used as the primary measure of BMV RNA synthesis since, unlike RNA3, RNA4 is only produced by viral RNA-dependent RNA synthesis and not also by DNA-dependent transcription (Fig. 1A). Moreover, RNA4 level is the parameter most closely related to the Rluc expression measured in the primary screen (Fig. 1A).",

Additionally, although the dox-repressible library is a powerful tool for analyzing the effects of essential genes on virus replication, over 70% of the strains in this collection exhibit growth defects in the presence of dox and 14% exhibit growth defects in the absence of dox [27]. Moreover, expressing viral components in some of these strains resulted in no or poor growth, interfering with meaningful analysis of these strains. Finally, in both the screens for non-essential genes [9] and essential genes (here), virus dependence on some host functions was likely masked by continuous expression of BMV replication proteins and RNA templates, compared to natural infections resulting from a single viral RNA template. This is analogous to studies in which high multiplicity of infection overcomes antiviral resistance in some cell lines [39], [41]. The lower confirmation rate for the 19 candidate genes that inhibited BMV-directed Rluc expression may be because these primary screen candidates included false positives arising from the tendency of essential gene depletion to produce non-specific inhibitory effects and greater variability in results, as is also noted above in the Results section. Additionally, translation and protein expression are the basis of our primary screen luciferase assays, whereas secondary confirmation by Northern blotting analyzes RNA levels normalized to 18S rRNA. Subtle differences (e.g., growth conditions) not controlled for by Fluc in the primary screen or 18S rRNA in Northern analysis may also contribute to the lower confirmation rate observed. Despite such limitations, this study identified 24 novel, essential host genes from various cellular pathways with potentially diverse roles in BMV RNA replication.",

Thus, although SPC29 and PFY1 encode proteins potentially related to cell division (respectively a spindle pole body protein and actin-binding protein) the doubling times of untreated and dox-treated PTET-SPC29 and PTET-PFY1 cells were comparable and likely do not account for the increased levels of BMV RNA4 observed (Fig. 2. and Table 3).

Fe-S clusters are among the most versatile protein co-factors in the cell and participate in electron transfer, ribosome biogenesis, regulating gene expression and enzyme activity, and nucleotide metabolism [54], [55], [56]. The inhibition of BMV replication upon dox-repressing PTET-JAC1 (Fig. 3 and Table 5) may result from negatively affecting the activation and/or function of one or more cellular or viral factors required for BMV RNA replication. Previously, we showed that YDJ1, another J-protein co-chaperone of Hsp70 and Hsp90, is required to activate the BMV RNA replication complex, likely through modulating BMV 2aPol folding or assembly into the complex [26]. Dox-repression of another heat shock protein, PTET-HSF1, inhibited BMV RNA replication by 84% (Fig. 3 and Table 5). Thus, our data suggest that BMV utilizes multiple members of the heat shock protein family to facilitate RNA replication.",

Similarly, repressing PTET-RPT6, one of six ATPases of the 19S regulatory particle of the 26S proteasome, resulted in an \u223c90% reduction in BMV RNA replication (Fig. 3 and Table 5). Additionally, BMV 2aPol accumulation increased significantly in both PTET-PRE1 and PTET-RPT6 dox-repressed cells (Fig. 5). These results are consistent with previous findings that multiple non-essential ubiquitin-proteasome system components contribute to BMV RNA replication and that cells lacking PRE9, the only non-essential 20S proteasome component, also exhibit a substantial increase in BMV 2aPol levels [9]. Our prior data show that having a substantial excess of 2aPol shifts replication compartments from small spherular compartments to double membrane layers, but does not inhibit viral RNA replication [57]. Thus, the increase in 2aPol accumulation in dox-repressed PTET-PRE1 and PTET-RPT6 (Fig. 5) is not likely the cause of decreased RNA replication. However, prior results do not exclude the possibility that PRE1 and RPT6 depletion might affect BMV RNA replication by directly or indirectly modulating 2aPol localization, post-translational modification or interacting partners. The 26S proteasome localizes predominantly to the nuclear envelope-ER network [58], the site of BMV RNA replication [16], [59], and numerous viruses utilize the ubiquitin-proteasome system to facilitate infection or replication [60], [61], [62], [63], [64], [65]. Studies to define the specific role(s) of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in BMV RNA replication are ongoing.",

Additional studies both in yeast and in BMV's natural plant hosts should reveal how these host factors affect the virus and provide new insights to host cell function and virus-host interactions. Although targeting some essential genes may result in deleterious effects on cells or patients, focusing on the relevant cellular pathways, rather than only individual genes, may overcome such issues. For example, two of the essential genes with the most substantial inhibitory effect on BMV RNA replication, PRE1 and RPT6, are proteasome components, while other proteasome components are not essential (e.g. PRE9, identified in previous screen). Proteasome inhibitors have antiviral activity against multiple diverse viruses (including herpes simplex virus, hepatitis B virus, and HIV, among others), have been through multiple clinical trials, and are already approved for use in patients for some purposes. Many of the genes identified function in pathways utilized by other viruses and thus may present potential cellular targets for developing broad-spectrum antivirals.",
