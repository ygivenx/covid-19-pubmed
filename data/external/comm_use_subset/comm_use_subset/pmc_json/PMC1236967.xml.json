The spike (S) glycoproteins of coronaviruses are no exception and mediate binding to host cells followed by membrane fusion; they are major targets for neutralizing antibodies and form the characteristic corona of large, distinctive spikes in the viral envelopes [2,3]. Such 20 nm complex surface projections also surround the periphery of the SCV particles [4]. The level of overall sequence similarity between the predicted amino acid sequence of the SCV S glycoprotein and the S glycoproteins of other coronaviruses is low (20\u201327% pairwise amino acid identity) except for some conserved sequences in the S2 subunit [5]. The low level of sequence similarity precludes definite conclusions about functional and structural similarity.",

S and its soluble ectodomain, Se, were not cleaved to any significant degree [6]. Because the S protein of coronaviruses is a class I fusion protein [12], this observation classifies the SCV S protein as an exception to the rule that class I fusion proteins are cleaved exposing an N-terminal fusogenic sequence (fusion peptide) although cleavage of S could enhance fusion [9].",

Fragments containing the N-terminal amino acid residues 17 to 537 and 272 to 537 but not 17 to 276 bound specifically to Vero E6 cells and purified soluble receptor (ACE2) molecules [6]. Together with data for inhibition of binding by antibodies, developed against peptides from S, these findings suggested that the receptor-binding domain (RBD) is located between amino acid residues 303 and 537 [6]. Two other groups obtained similar results and found that independently folded fragments containing residues 318 to 510 [8] and 270 to 510 [10] can bind receptor molecules. Currently, these fragments are being further characterized to better understand the interactions of the virus with its receptor as well as their potential as inhibitors of the virus entry by blocking these interactions. Here, we present evidence that glycosylation of these and other fragments containing the S RBD does not affect to any measurable degree their binding to the receptor (ACE2), and analyze the S RBD-ACE2 interaction.",

To find the minimal number of potential glycosylation sites and shortest length required for expression and folding of S RBD fragments, we cloned in pSecTag 2B fragments with various number of potential glycosylation sites and length including S317\u2013518, S319\u2013518, S329\u2013518, S364\u2013537, S399\u2013518, S317\u2013493, and S329\u2013458, where the numbers after S denote the amino acid residues confining the fragment. Note that these fragments were not constructed as fusion proteins with Fc as in a previous report [8]. This is why we also designed and tested several fragments with deleted portions of the RBD that have already been shown to be important for binding to ACE2 including regions between residues 327 and 490 [8]. The S317\u2013518 and S319\u2013518 fragments were secreted in the culture supernatant (Fig 1A), and bound to ACE2-expressing cells (Fig 1B) and purified ACE2 (Table 1 and data not shown). The difference in the molecular weights of the two fragments (about 3 kD) is much larger than the calculated weight due to the two additional amino acids contained in S317\u2013518, and is likely due to glycosylation. Both fragments bound to ACE2 at comparable levels (Fig. 1B). The other fragments were not secreted (Fig. 1A) but could be detected by Western in cell lysates (data not shown). These results suggest that a short fragment (S319\u2013518), which is not a fusion protein, with only two glycosylation sites can be independently folded and secreted in a soluble form, and can bind ACE2.",

Eleven mutants, K390, R426, D429, T431, D454, I455, N473, F483, Q492, Y494, and R495 exhibited decreased binding to ACE2 at comparable levels of expression (Table 1). Note that RBD fragment mutated at D454 or Y494 was expressed at somewhat lower levels but binding was much more significantly reduced. In addition, one of these mutations, D454, was previously shown to affect the RBD-ACE2 interaction [8]. The T431 mutation reduced binding but to lesser extent than the other mutations that decreased very significantly (more than 10-fold) the RBD-ACE2 interaction. The protein mutated at R441 expressed poorly and we were not able to assess its role in the RBD binding, although because of the similar levels of decrease in binding and expression, it is likely that this mutation does not affect binding. Interestingly, it appears that the D393 mutation enhanced binding \u2013 the mutated fragment expressed at low concentration but its binding equaled the binding of the non-mutated protein. The mutated residues that affect RBD binding include positively and negatively charged, polar and hydrophobic residues, indicating a role of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions in the RBD-ACE2 interactions. These results also demonstrate that the mutations for the selected panel of residues that do affect binding are significantly (about 2-fold) more than those that do not, suggesting possible mechanisms of immune evasion.",

A sequence-based secondary structure analysis of the S RBD predicted mostly \u03b2-sheets (data not shown), connected by loops or turns, where most of the residues affecting the RBD-ACE2 interactions are located. To find out additional residues that are not likely to affect binding significantly we aligned multiple RBD sequences of various non-redundant SCV strains. Figure 5A shows the identified 13 amino acid residues, which can be mutated without affecting the function of the virus to cause infection. Interestingly, one of these residues, R426, which decreases binding to ACE2 about 10-fold if mutated to A, is mutated to G in one of the strains. Four of the other 12 mutations (indicated with * in Table 1) do not affect binding to ACE2 when converted to A. To examine the extent of similarities of the SCV RBD sequence with related sequences of other coronaviruses from different organisms, which share only about 20\u201335% sequence identities, we performed multiple alignments using BLAST. Strikingly, six cysteine residues are conserved (Fig. 5B) indicating the possibility for up to three possible disulphide bridges within the S RBD that can help to keep the structural integrity of this domain. Most of the residues we found important for binding are highly variable except T431, Q492 and R495, which are highly conserved (Fig. 5B). The multiple sequence alignment score was then used to build a phylogram by using the ClustalW software. The results suggested that the SCV S RBD is much more distant than the respective regions of the other tested coronaviruses (Fig. 5C).",

Residues D454 and I455, whose mutation reduced binding to ACE2, do not make contacts with ACE2 and are located on the side opposing the side facing the receptor (right panel of Fig. 6); it is likely that the mutations decrease binding by inducing conformational changes. Other mutations including mutations of the two glycosylations sites on that side do not affect binding to ACE2 (right panels of Fig. 6).

ACE2 was previously identified as a receptor for the SCV [7] and this finding was confirmed [6,13]. ACE2 binds with high (nM) affinity to S and is expected to induce conformational changes required for membrane fusion [6-8,14]. Its crystal structure was recently reported [15] and is in general agreement with two homology models previously developed [16,17]. It was proposed that the S binding domain on ACE2 involves residues on the ridges surrounding the enzymatic site [17]. Recently, several ACE2 regions and amino acid residues were identified as important for its binding to the S RBD [18].",

We performed sequence analysis and developed a 3D model of a fragment containing the S RBD (the model will be described elsewhere). According to this model the S RBD like RBDs from other viruses contains predominantly \u03b2-sheets. Most of the residues affecting the ACE2 interactions are exposed on the surface of the beta sheets and inter-connecting loops. These predicted observations are consistent with the recently solved crystal structure of S RBD complexed with ACE2 (Li, F, Li, W, Farzan, M, and Harrison, S. C., submitted). The nature of the residues, which include charged, hydrophobic and polar residues indicated that all these types of interactions could be involved either directly or indirectly in the S RBD binding to ACE2. Notable are the complementarities in the charges of several residues in S, e.g. R426 and N473 with those of ACE2, e.g. E329 and Q24, respectively. One can reason that these residues might contribute significantly for the on rate constant and proper orientation of the two molecules in the complex, as well as to the low dissociation rate constant. We identified two hot spots, residues R426 and N473, which are likely to contribute to the bulk of the free energy of interaction.

We constructed a fragment (319\u2013518), which contains only two glycosylation sites and still binds with an affinity undistinguishable from the fragments containing three glycosylation sites. Further mutations of all combinations of these sites revealed that only one of them is required for expression but none of them for binding.
