In polarized epithelial cells, CVB3 infection requires an additional attachment receptor, decay-accelerating factor (DAF), because CAR is sequestered in tight junctions (10, 11). If CAR expression is low, as in some nonpolarized cell lines such as RD and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, CVB3 strains that do not bind DAF can evolve to use additional factors such as DAF and heparan sulfate (HS) to aid attachment efficiency (12\u201319).",

An appropriate amount of viral population diversity is thought to aid viral adaptation to changing host environments and is required for full virulence in vivo (20\u201325). When viral populations encounter selective pressure, distinct viral variants can emerge. For example, many viruses used in laboratories today are cell culture-adapted variants. Cell culture adaptation reduces the virulence of many viruses and is frequently the basis of live-attenuated vaccine development. Some of these culture-adapted variants show changes in affinity for glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), which are sulfated polysaccharides, including HS and heparin. GAGs are present ubiquitously on cell surfaces (26). It has been shown that viruses from many different families interact with GAGs, which aids viral attachment. Viral affinity for GAGs is an important determinant of tissue tropism and pathogenicity (27\u201329).",

CVB3 does not replicate efficiently in orally inoculated C57BL/6 mice, and orally inoculated immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice do not develop disease. While CVB3 replicates more efficiently in mice lacking the interferon alpha/beta receptor (IFNAR), the immune deficiency of these mice is not ideal for studies seeking to understand innate and adaptive responses to viral infection. Therefore, a better model system for oral CVB3 infections is needed since some effects, such as those imparted by intestinal microbiota, can only be uncovered by using the natural oral infection route (30\u201334).",

We characterized this variant both in vitro and in vivo and found that N63Y mutant CVB3 has a growth defect in tissue culture but is more pathogenic than wild-type (WT) CVB3 in mice. We also explored what factors promote the emergence of the large-plaque variant, the basis for large-plaque formation, and mechanisms underlying differences in viral replication and pathogenesis.",

Because mice shed unreplicated inoculum virus in their feces, it is difficult to quantify viral replication in the intestine in the first few days after oral inoculation. To avoid this problem, we examined viral replication by using light-sensitive, neutral-red-labeled virus. Virus propagated in the presence of neutral red dye is sensitive to light-induced inactivation by RNA cross-linking but loses light sensitivity upon replication in the dark inside mice, facilitating the assessment of replication and differentiating the inoculum virus from replicated virus in feces. Fecal samples were collected at 24, 48, and 72 h postinfection (hpi), and virus titers were determined by plaque assay using agar overlays (Fig. 1A). At 24 hpi, only two mice shed replicated virus while most of the mice shed replicated virus at 72 hpi (Fig. 1B). Surprisingly, plaques with morphology different from that of inoculum CVB3 were observed on 72-hpi fecal sample titer plates (Fig. 1C and D), suggesting that a variant emerged following viral replication in mice. Indeed, 0.67% of the fecal virus plaques were large at 48 hpi, while 11% were large at 72 hpi. We then examined the frequency of large-plaque viruses in our inoculum to determine whether the large-plaque variant was present prior to the inoculation of mice. We found that 0.26% of the inoculum CVB3 plaques had the large-plaque phenotype, suggesting that the large-plaque variant existed at a low level in the inoculum and was enriched following replication in the gut.",

IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice and immunocompetent IFNAR+/+ mice were orally, intraperitoneally (i.p.), or intramuscularly (i.m.) inoculated with 5 \u00d7 107, 5 \u00d7 107, or 2 \u00d7 106 PFU of CVB3, respectively. Fecal samples were collected from orally inoculated mice at 72 hpi; livers, hearts, and spleens were harvested from i.p. inoculated mice at 48 hpi; and muscles and livers were harvested from i.m. inoculated mice at 48 hpi. We measured the virus plaque sizes and quantified the percentages of large plaques in different tissues (Fig. 2). First, we found that there were more large-plaque variants in IFNAR+/+ mice than in IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice. The increased emergence of the large-plaque virus in immunocompetent mice correlates with reduced viral replication, indicating that increased selective pressure may drive the emergence of the large-plaque variant. Second, large-plaque variants were present in feces from orally inoculated mice and visceral tissues from i.p. or i.m. inoculated mice but not in muscle from i.m. inoculated IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice. We hypothesize that increased selective pressure in the intestine and peritoneal cavity facilitated the emergence of large-plaque variants and/or the large-plaque variant has a fitness advantage in selected tissues. Overall, these results suggest that the large-plaque variant existed at a low level in our inoculum but was enriched following viral replication in several tissues of infected mice.",

We sequenced the capsid-coding region with the rationale that major changes in plaque size frequently map to capsid proteins (35, 36). Sequence alignment revealed several silent point mutations and two amino acid changes in the capsid-coding region of large plaques: T151S in VP2 and N63Y in VP3. Sequence alignment revealed that amino acid 151 of VP2 is a variable position, with T or S present in many GenBank samples. However, N63 is highly conserved among coxsackieviruses and echoviruses (Fig. 3A) and is located on the virion surface near the DAF binding site (Fig. 3B) (37). Using reverse genetics, we cloned N63Y into the CVB3 infectious clone and found that N63Y is sufficient for the large-plaque phenotype (Fig. 3C). Recently, Border\u00eda et al. identified polymorphisms at position 63 of VP3, including N63Y, N63D, and N63H, that emerged following viral passage in A549 human lung cells (38). Therefore, VP3-63 may affect viral replication in different cell types. Because N63Y was sufficient for the large-plaque phenotype, we examined the properties of N63Y-containing viruses.",

Heparinase treatment reduced the attachment of WT CVB3 to cells, with little effect on N63Y mutant CVB3 attachment (Fig. 4E). Third, we quantified CVB3 binding to GAGs by a direct method, heparin-agarose pulldown assays. 35S-labeled CVB3 was incubated with heparin-agarose resin or control streptavidin-agarose resin at 37\u00b0C for 3 h.

Conversely, we hypothesized that N63Y mutant CVB3 plaque formation would not be inhibited by sulfated glycans in agar. To test this, we examined the plaque sizes of WT and N63Y mutant CVB3 by using agar versus agarose overlays in the presence of added HS or heparin. Agarose contains low levels of sulfated glycans, and WT and N63Y mutant CVB3 generated similar-size large plaques under an agarose overlay. Addition of HS or heparin to the overlay reduced the WT plaque size but not the N63Y mutant plaque size (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material). Taken together, these data suggest that the N63Y mutant has reduced binding to sulfated glycans, which facilitates the formation of large plaques in the presence of sulfated glycans but reduces its attachment to cell surface GAGs and growth in cell culture.",

To test this, we orally inoculated IFNAR+/+ mice and observed that the N63Y mutant replicated more efficiently than WT CVB3 (Fig. 5B). We also examined viral titers in various tissues from orally inoculated IFNAR+/+ or IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice at 72 hpi. N63Y mutant CVB3 titers were significantly higher than WT CVB3 titers in all of the IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mouse tissues examined (Fig. 5C). While viral titers were low in most IFNAR+/+ mouse tissues, N63Y mutant CVB3 titers were significantly higher than WT CVB3 titers in leg muscle, indicating that the N63Y mutant was more capable of dissemination to body sites distant from the gut in immunocompetent animals (Fig. 5D).

First, we measured the levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), a marker of liver damage, in serum. ALT levels were low at 24 hpi in all of the mice (Fig. 6A). However, ALT levels were significantly elevated at 72 hpi in mice infected with N63Y mutant CVB3 compared with uninfected controls. While 33% of the mice infected with WT CVB3 had higher ALT levels than uninfected mice, 66% of the mice infected with N63Y mutant CVB3 had higher ALT levels than uninfected mice. Second, we performed histological analysis of liver tissue harvested from mice at 72 hpi. As shown in Fig. S4 in the supplemental material, mice infected with N63Y mutant CVB3 had more severe liver pathology than uninfected or WT CVB3-infected mice. Histological examination revealed hepatic cell necrosis with extensive polymorphonuclear cell infiltration at 72 hpi in N63Y mutant CVB3-infected mice. Moderate polymorphonuclear cell infiltration was observed in WT CVB3-infected mice.

These effects were observed in livers harvested at 1 hpi, hours before a single cycle of viral replication can occur. The elevated amount of N63Y mutant CVB3 found in the liver could be due to increased binding to liver tissue and/or increased dissemination to the liver. To distinguish between these possibilities, we quantified the binding of 35S-labeled WT versus N63Y mutant CVB3 to liver tissue homogenates from IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice ex vivo.

Other viruses have nonglycan proteinaceous receptors, but binding to GAGs can enhance attachment. GAGs most commonly interact with viral particles via positively charged amino acids such as lysine or arginine (27, 28, 41, 46). Therefore, the N63Y amino acid change observed here is slightly unusual. It is possible that a change from asparagine to tyrosine disrupts GAG binding to a nearby site on the viral capsid or that noncanonical GAG-capsid interactions occur.",

For example, cell culture adaptation of foot-and-mouth disease virus selects viruses that bind HS, but these viruses are attenuated in cattle (29). A cell culture-adapted vaccine strain of chikungunya virus is attenuated because of increased GAG binding (37). A dengue virus variant with reduced HS binding caused severe disease in mice, with reduced clearance from serum (47). Similarly, laboratory Sindbis virus strains bind HS (28); however, HS-binding Sindbis virus strains are attenuated in mice. Interestingly, Byrnes et al. isolated a large-plaque variant of Sindbis virus from mice inoculated with an HS-binding strain. The large-plaque variant bound HS less efficiently and was more virulent in mice (48). The non-HS-binding variant had increased viremia and decreased clearance from serum, perhaps because of reduced clearance by heparin-binding proteins in the host. These Sindbis virus results are very reminiscent of our CVB3 results.",

Perhaps this explains why other groups have not yet reported the emergence of N63Y variants in animal studies. We only identified the emergence of this mutant because of a very obvious phenotypic change in plaque size. It is possible, and even likely, that the emergence of variants occurs frequently in animals but may be missed because of a lack of observable phenotypes.",

We do not know whether the GAG-binding deficiency of N63Y mutant CVB3 is sufficient for its enhanced replication and pathogenesis or if other effects contribute. In agreement with a previous study, we found that IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice developed liver pathology upon CVB3 infection. Liver pathology was more severe in mice infected with N63Y mutant CVB3, potentially because N63Y mutant CVB3 had increased dissemination to the liver (Fig. 6). Whether the increased viral shedding in mice inoculated orally with N63Y mutant CVB3 is due to altered viral dissemination to the liver or other tissues is unknown. It is possible that the enhanced replication and pathogenesis of N63Y mutant CVB3 are specific to mice, since this variant is not observed in human clinical isolates. However, because N63Y mutant CVB3 is more pathogenic than WT CVB3 in orally inoculated immunodeficient mice and N63Y mutant CVB3 replicates well in orally inoculated immunocompetent mice and even disseminates to muscle tissue, it may be useful as a new model system for examining CVB3 replication and pathogenesis by using the natural route of infection.",

Agar (1% final concentration; Becton Dickinson) was used in plaque assay overlays unless otherwise indicated. Plaque size was quantified with ImageJ 1.47v software.

To determine the percentage of replicated virus, samples were processed in the dark and a portion was light exposed. The percentage of replicated virus was calculated by dividing the light-exposed number of PFU/ml by the non-light-exposed number of PFU/ml and multiplying the result by 100. 35S-labeled CVB3 was prepared as previously described (30).

Because position 151 of VP2 is highly variable in CVB3 sequences, we focused our efforts on VP3 N63Y. A 377-bp fragment containing the N63Y mutation was generated by BsiWI/BglII digestion of an RT-PCR product from one fecal isolate, and this fragment was cloned into a new CVB3 Nancy plasmid from nucleotide 1695 (BsiWI) to nucleotide 2072 (BglII).

The structure in Fig. 3 was modified from a previously determined crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 1cov) (51).

In the experiments shown in Fig. 2, mice were orally, i.p. inoculated with 5 \u00d7 107 PFU of WT CVB3 or i.m. inoculated with 2 \u00d7 106 PFU of WT CVB3, tissues (muscle, liver, heart, and/or spleen) were harvested at 48 hpi, and fecal samples were collected from orally inoculated mice at 72 hpi. In the experiments shown in Fig. 5, mice were orally inoculated with 5 \u00d7 107 PFU of CVB3 or inoculated i.p. or i.m. with 1 \u00d7 104 PFU and 1 \u00d7 102 PFU of CVB3, respectively. Tissue samples were processed as previously described (30). In the experiments shown in Fig. 6A, mice were orally inoculated with 5 \u00d7 107 PFU of CVB3 and blood was collected at 24 hpi by cheek bleed and at 72 hpi by heart puncture. Following heart puncture, mice were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde, liver tissue was collected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 h, and hematoxylin-and-eosin (H&E) staining was performed by the UT Southwestern Molecular Pathology Core. For ALT quantification, serum was separated by centrifugation and ALT concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; MyBiosource) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. In the experiments shown in Fig. 6B, mice were inoculated i.p. with 35S-labeled WT or N63Y mutant CVB3 at 2 \u00d7 107 PFU/20,000 cpm and tissues were collected 1 hpi for quantification in a scintillation counter. In all cases, feces and tissue samples were processed prior to viral titer assay or scintillation counting as previously described (30). In the experiments shown in Fig. 6C, fresh tissues were homogenized with a Bullet Blender homogenizer (Next Advanced Inc., Averill Park, NY) (55) prior to incubation with 3 \u00d7 106 PFU/3,000 cpm of 35S-labeled WT or N63Y mutant CVB3. After a 1-h incubation at 37\u00b0C, tissues were washed with PBS+ and tissue-associated radioactivity was quantified by scintillation counting.",
