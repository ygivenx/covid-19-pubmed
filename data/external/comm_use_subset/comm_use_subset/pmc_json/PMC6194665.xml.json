The virus genome is organized into two or three ORFs, which encode both structural and non-structural proteins, including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the major capsid protein (VP1) [1]. Due to great genetic variability and recombination capacity, the genus is divided into fifteen different genogroups based on analysis of both capsid and RdRp sequences [9, 10]. Sapoviruses infect a wide variety of hosts including humans, pigs, mink, canines and bats [11\u201314]. The porcine sapovirus (PSaV), formerly known as porcine enteric calicivirus (PEC), is divided into GIII, GV \u2013 GXI genogroups, but GIII is considered as the prototypic genogroup with the only cultivable Cowden strain [9].",

On the other hand, the incidence of PSaV has been found to be more sporadic (8\u201310%) in pig samples investigated independently if they originated from healthy or diarrheic pigs. Our results indicate that there is no strong correlation between detection of both viruses in enteric samples and diarrhea. This observation has been quite surprising as it is believed that porcine astrovirus and porcine sapovirus belong to the common agents of pig gastrointestinal infections, which are usually associated with diarrheic diseases [15, 19].",

The presencee of PKV-1 as a newly emerged virus, which role in gastroenteritis is still unknown, has been similar in both, healthy and diarrheic pigs, as has been observed for PAstV and PSaV in this work. However, the detection of RVA in suckling piglets, but not in weaned and fattening pigs, was significantly associated with diarrhea, confirming that this virus is a cause of gastroenteritis. In this context it is difficult to conclude, at least from our findings, that PAstV, PSaV and PKV-1 are typical enteric viruses associated with diarrhea which contrasts with conclusions by others [4, 19, 20]. This inconsistency indicates that viruses could express their pathogenicity in only a small percentage of cases as has been already hypothesized by Luo et al. [21] due to co-infection with other gastrointestinal viruses or due to immunodeficiency of animals. However, our data of the co-infection of viruses do not support this hypothesis. In two studies (this work and [18]) we did not detect strong differences between healthy and diarrheic animals with co-infection of PAstV and PSaV or in the case of rotavirus A co-infection with both PAstV and PSaV. Other studies also indicated that PAstV as a ubiquitous virus has been often found in co-infections with various viruses [7, 8]. We further speculate that the development of diarrhea in pigs is for some viruses a result of interaction the entire virome or microbiome with environment in the intestinal tract which may influence the course of viral infection. It is quite surprising that infection of gnotobiotic pigs, in which the virome is different from the virome in pigs on farms, with PSaV resulted in the development of diarrhea [22].",

The comparison with available sequences from GenBank database revealed that the majority of PAstV sequences belong to the lineages PAstV-2 and PAstV-4, which were also the most often detected in neighbouring countries e.g. Czech Republic and Hungary [7, 8], but also in North America [4, 21]. In addition we detected another three rare lineages PAstV-1, PAstV-3 and PAstV-5; each of them was represented by one sequence. Until now, all five lineages were detected inside Europe only in Croatia [6].",
