The primary culture of this tissue was started on 27 March 1962 in Chiba University in Japan, several continuous cell sub-lines were obtained after passages for several months, and a sub-line was then chosen as the standard Vero cell line.1,2",

The same analysis on PBMC from normal female AGM showed 60 chromosomes (Supplementary Fig. S1A).36 Because the G-banding karyotypes of Vero cells include several abnormal chromosomes (Fig. 1B), M-FISH was applied to identify chromosomal rearrangements. Human M-FISH probes hybridized efficiently to AGM chromosomes and showed 32 syntenic blocks in normal AGM karyotypes (Fig. 1C). This homology to humans was consistent with previous findings,37 and implied that the human M-FISH signal pattern can be used as a normal AGM reference (Fig. 1C). G-banding and M-FISH analyses revealed that 18 of 37 Vero metaphases represented a main clone with 59 chromosomes. M-FISH identified 40 segments in the Vero metaphases (Fig. 1D), which indicated the occurrence of one fusion and seven translocations. The fusion occurring between chromosomes 7 and 24 led to a reduction in the chromosome number from 60 to 59. Duplications and deletions were also detected in 6 chromosomes (Fig. 1D), showing rearrangements involved in 14 chromosomes. However, major chromosomal rearrangements were not detected in the other 46 chromosomes by G-banding or M-FISH (Fig. 1B and D), which suggested that a haploid chromosome set was retained in its original form. In addition to these common features, additional abnormalities were detected in 11 of 37 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1C and D). Although the other eight karyotypes were found to have similar abnormalities, the Vero cell line appeared to include several subclones. The main clone accounted for less than half of the population (18 of 37 cells) and the Vero cell line had a high cytogenetic heterogeneity.\n",

To clarify the species origin of the Vero cell lineage, we compared our reads with four previously reported complete mitochondrial sequences of Chlorocebus species: Chlorocebus aethiops, Chlorocebus tantalus, C. sabaeus, and Chlorocebus pygerythrus.40 The mutation rate in the mitochondrial genomes of Old World monkeys is known to be markedly higher than that in nuclear genomes41; therefore, the mitochondrial sequences of these four species had sufficiently diverged to cause mapping bias of short reads. We mapped the paired-end reads to all four Chlorocebus mitochondrial genomes as a reference and found that the mitochondrial genome of C. sabaeus had the highest coverage and lowest divergence to the mitochondrial genome of Vero cells (Supplementary Table S2). Furthermore, a phylogenetic tree using whole mitochondrial genome sequences indicated that the Vero cell line was closest to C. sabaeus (Fig. 2A). The gender of the AGM individual from which the Vero cell lineage was established has not yet been clearly described. A pair of X chromosomes in karyotyping (Fig. 1) and the almost diploid copy number of X chromosomes in sequence data (Fig. 2B) were observed in Vero JCRB0111 cells.

The karyotyping results obtained showed that most of the translocation events occurred between the telomeric regions of chromosomes, which could not be identified by sequencing if chromosomes fused via repeat sequences. In addition, in order to filter out rare chromosomal rearrangements in a cell population, events that occurred in only one of the homologous chromosomes may not be identified in our filtering criteria. Therefore, the absence of translocation rearrangements by sequencing does not contradict the results of the karyological analysis, which showed that all or most chromosomal translocations were observed in one of the two homologous chromosomes (Fig. 1C and D; Supplementary Fig. S1C and D).

Many of these tests rely on conventional methodology, and some tests still use many experimental animals. The whole-genome sequence should be invaluable reference information to develop more rational and effective methods for identification, genetic stability, and microbial agents in pharmaceutical cell banks. For example, the currently authorized tests for cell identity consist of classical methods (e.g. isoenzyme analysis and G-band analysis) and more modern DNA profiling methods (e.g. restriction fragment length polymorphism and variable number of tandem repeats analysis). These tests, even if not all, require a considerable amount of time and money as well as well-trained technical skills, and some are not accurate enough to discriminate different cell lines established from the same biological species. This study presented a proof of the concept that PCR analysis will open a rapid and accurate alternative method for the cell identity test to detect unique chromosomal deletions (Fig. 3). Metagenome analysis is a powerful approach that can be used to survey microbial contamination in biological pharmaceuticals.46,47,54 This study also employed DNA-seq short reads of Vero cell genome DNA to comprehensively survey microbe-related sequences in the cell sample, and detected no discernible sign of microbe-relevant sequences (except for endogenous SRV) in Vero JCRB0111 cells. In this direction, it is crucial to distinguish between endogenous and exogenous viral-like sequences, because the appearance of the former is inevitable and can serve as an internal positive control in metagenomic analysis for microbial agents. In addition, the heterogeneity in SRV sequences as discussed above may also be a good genomic signature for identifying a specific cell seed among various Vero cell sub-lines. The whole-genome sequence of Vero cells will also be an invaluable resource for engineering the specific genes of cells by recently advanced genome-editing technologies.",

Large deletions (>90 kb deletions) (A) and some small deletions (1\u20132 kb deletions) (B) were selected. Although the genomic PCR confirmed the existence of breakpoint junctions for the 573 kb deletion in chromosome 21 and the 294 kb deletion in chromosome 9, a part of these regions appeared to exist somewhere in the genome (A; see also Supplementary Fig. S2). Amplicons corresponding to the deletions predicted in chromosomes 1 and 10 were produced not only from Vero cells, but also from AGM PBMC, while amplicons corresponding to the \u2018non-deleted\u2019 counterparts were not produced even from AGM PBMC (B; see also Supplementary Fig. S2), which indicated that our determined sequences for the Vero cell genome existed homozygously in these regions not only in Vero cells, but also in AGM PBMC. This paradox might be attributed to the possible incompleteness of the currently available version of the AGM whole-genome draft sequence or polymorphic state of the deletion within AGM populations.
