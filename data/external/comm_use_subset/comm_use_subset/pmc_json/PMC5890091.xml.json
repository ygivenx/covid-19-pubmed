The lack of rapid and accurate diagnostic tools contributed to the estimated 4.1 million cases of TB that went unreported (TDR, FIND SA, 2006). Smear microscopy, the first line in TB detection, has a low and variable sensitivity (30\u201370%) (Steingart et al., 2006, Aber et al., 1980, Urbanczik, 1985). Conventional culture on solid media has a sensitivity of 80\u201390%, but requires 2\u20138 weeks for a result (Lee et al., 2003; Somosk\u00f6vi et al., 2000). Although conventional liquid culture (Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT); Becton Dickinson Microbiology Systems) typically has sensitivity greater than 95%, the time to result is still up to 4 weeks. This results in individuals being lost to follow-up and treatment delays (Stall et al., 2011).",

Initial demonstration studies found the sensitivity to be 77% in those with smear-negative, culture-positive TB and specificity to be >98% (Boehme et al., 2010, Boehme et al., 2011). A Cochrane review in 2014 found sensitivity in those with smear-negative, culture-positive TB to be 67% and specificity to be 99% (Steingart et al., 2014). However, Xpert MTB/RIF requires a continuous supply of electricity, hefty investment in equipment, and long-term maintenance plans.",

            "text": "TB-LAMP is a new, commercially available, manual molecular TB detection method based on the novel loop-mediated isothermal amplification platform (LAMP), manufactured by Eiken Chemical Co. in Japan. LAMP is an attractive diagnostics platform because it takes less than 2 h to perform, requires minimal instrumentation, and generates a fluorescent result that can be detected with the naked eye (Notomi et al., 2000). Furthermore, it has shown potential as a cross-disease platform, with assays developed for malaria, African trypanosomiasis, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and influenza (Kuboki et al., 2003, Poon et al., 2005a, Poon et al., 2005b, Poon et al., 2006). The TB-LAMP assay requires only minimal instrumentation in the form of a heating block. Additionally, it has the potential for higher throughput as it can test up to 14 samples per test run (Boehme et al., 2011, Vassall et al., 2011). A full description of the TB-LAMP procedure can be found in the recent World Health Organization (WHO) policy guidance (WHO Policy Guidance, 2016).",

Directed follow-up was not performed for participants with Xpert MTB/RIF-positive and bacteriologically negative results; furthermore, the use of an imperfect standard will have a more deleterious effect on an assay with higher specificity.
