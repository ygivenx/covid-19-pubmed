Their replication occurs in the cytoplasm and has a profound impact on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [1,2]. Particularly, extraordinarily large amounts of viral structural and non-structural proteins are synthesized and processed primarily in the ER. To facilitate this process, coronaviruses have developed strategies to modulate signal transduction pathways that govern ER function. We and others have previously shown that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) spike (S) proteins induce ER stress and activate cellular unfolded protein response (UPR) in the ER [3-5]. Several other viral proteins of SARS-CoV are also known to be capable of activating the UPR [6-9].",

            "text": "Coronaviruses that are known to infect humans broadly include two categories of viruses. In the first category, the viruses commonly circulate in human populations and cause generally mild respiratory illnesses. These viruses that are thought to be well adapted to humans include human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 [10-12]. In the family Coronaviridae, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 belong to the genus Alphacoronavirus, whereas HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 are in the lineage A of the genus Betacoronavirus. In the second category, the viruses accidentally or newly cross the species barrier to infect humans. SARS-CoV and the emerging Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are two well known examples in this category [13-16]. They are less well adapted to humans and cause severe and highly lethal diseases. Whereas SARS-CoV belongs to lineage B of the genus Betacoronavirus, MERS-CoV represents lineage C of the same genus. The molecular mechanisms that determine the severity of diseases in coronavirus infection remain poorly understood. Particularly, it is not known whether S proteins of human coronaviruses in the above two categories have similar UPR-activating activity. We therefore set out to compare S proteins of SARS-CoV and HCoV-HKU1 for their ability to modulate the UPR. All three branches of the UPR, which are governed by ER-resident transmembrane proteins ATF6, IRE1 and PERK, respectively [17,18], were examined.",

It was subsequently found to be commonly associated with respiratory tract infections worldwide [12,19,20]. However, molecular and cellular pathogenesis of HCoV-HKU1 in contrast to SARS-CoV remains elusive. Although primary human ciliated airway epithelial cells and type II alveolar epithelial cells have been tested for culturing of HCoV-HKU1 with limited success [21-23], HCoV-HKU1 remains a very-difficult-to-culture virus in most laboratories. Worse still, an infectious clone of HCoV-HKU1 is not available. At this stage, analysis of cloned HCoV-HKU1 genes represents a major route for deriving mechanistic insight on HCoV-HKU1 pathogenesis.",

Particularly, TMPRSS2 efficiently activates S proteins of SARS-CoV as well as MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E [32-36]. Moreover, TMPRSS2 and related proteases TMPRSS4, which are abundantly expressed in human alveolar epithelial cells, are capable of activating influenza virus hemagglutinin [37]. To investigate whether they might also proteolytically activate HCoV-HKU1 S protein, we expressed them together in 293FT cells. Coexpression of TMPRSS2 with SARS-CoV S protein resulted in the appearance of S1 subunit, indicative of proteolytic cleavage (Figure 2, lane 3). Although a V5 tag was added to the N-terminus of SARS-CoV S protein, the cleavage was not affected. The action of TMPRSS2 on SARS-CoV S was highly specific since TMPRSS1 and TMPRSS4 had no activity under the same condition (Figure 2, lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, none of the three proteases cleaved HCoV-HKU1 S protein (Figure 2, lanes 4\u20136). Thus, HCoV-HKU1 S protein is not processed by TMPRSS1, TMPRSS2 or TMPRSS4.",

The promoter activity of Grp78 and Grp94 was activated by S proteins of SARS-CoV and HCoV-HKU1 to similar levels (Figure 3A and B). The stimulatory effect of HCoV-HKU1 S protein is dose-dependent and equally potent compared to that of SARS-CoV S protein. In contrast, overexpression of \u03b2-galactosidase, a large foreign protein, had minimal or very mild effect on Grp78 and Grp94 promoter activity.

S proteins of both viruses exhibited the same activity profile not only on Grp78 and Grp94 promoters, but also on CHOP promoter and UPRE. They activated CHOP promoter mildly but did not affect the activity of UPRE (Figure 3C and D).

To analyze further whether PERK activity is required for transcriptional activation of Grp78 and Grp94 promoters by SARS-CoV and HCoV-HKU1 S proteins, we made use of a dominant negative (DN) mutant of PERK which constitutively inhibits PERK kinase activity [48]. If the activation of Grp78 and Grp94 proteins by S proteins requires PERK, their stimulatory effect would be reversed in the presence of PERK-DN. Consistent with our previous findings [3], activation of Grp78 and Grp94 promoters by SARS-CoV S protein was enhanced by wild-type PERK (PERK-WT) and dampened by PERK-DN (Figure 4A and B). A very similar pattern was also observed for HCoV-HKU1 S protein. In other words, PERK-WT and PERK-DN exerted opposite effects on the activation of Grp78 and Grp94 promoters by S proteins from both viruses (Figure 4A and B). Thus, the activation of Grp78 and Grp94 expression by S proteins is mediated through PERK.",

N-linked glycosylation of SARS-CoV S protein is known to be critical to receptor binding, viral entry and infectivity [50-52]. Since N-linked glycosylation of S protein might overload the ER leading to the activation of the UPR, it will be of interest to see whether N-linked glycosylation of SARS-CoV and HCoV-HKU1 S proteins might be influential in their induction of ER stress. N-linked glycosylation sites in SARS-CoV S protein has been documented [50-52]. Based on comparison and prediction with the help of a computer program, ten major N-linked glycosylation sites in SARS-CoV S protein and nine sites in HCoV-HKU1 S protein were chosen for further analysis. When all these sites were mutated, electrophoretic mobility of the mutant S proteins on SDS-PAGE gel was no long shifted upon treatment of cell lysates with endoglycosidase PNGase F (Figure 5A and B), indicating their deficiency in N-linked glycosylation. However, compared to the wild-type proteins, these mutants were equally competent in the activation of Grp78 and Grp94 promoters (Figure 5C-F). Hence, N-linked glycosylation is not influential in UPR activation by SARS-CoV and HCoV-HKU1 S proteins.",

To determine whether the UPR-activating property of SARS-CoV S protein is mediated by S1 (amino acids 1\u2013770) or S2 (amino acids 771\u20131255) subunit, we expressed them in 293FT cells (Figure 6A, lanes 2 and 3).

We found that the two S proteins share the following three properties in common. First, they localize predominantly to the ER (Figure 1). Second, they display a similar profile of UPR-activating properties with the ability to activate Grp78, Grp94 and CHOP promoters but not UPRE enhancer (Figure 3). Third, their activation of Grp78 and Grp94 promoters requires catalytic activity of PERK (Figure 4) but not N-linked glycosylation (Figure 5). On the other hand, the two S proteins also exhibit distinct properties in protease cleavability and UPR-activating domain. TMPRSS2 protease is capable of cleaving SARS-CoV S protein into S1 and S2 subunits, but has no proteolytic activity on HCoV-HKU1 S protein (Figure 2). The S1 subunit of SARS-CoV sufficiently activates the UPR, but its counterpart in HCoV-HKU1 has no UPR-modulating activity (Figure 6). Thus, although the UPR-activating domains in SARS-CoV and HCoV-HKU1 S proteins are distinct, their modulatory effects on UPR signaling are similar.",

Although the direct evidence remains to be seen, HCoV-OC43, another human betacoronavirus of lineage A, might also use S protein to modulate the UPR, since a mutant HCoV-OC43 carrying two persistence-associated mutations in S was able to activate the UPR more potently [53].

This might explain why Grp78 and Grp94 promoters are activated potently by S proteins. On the other hand, CHOP mediates ER stress-induced apoptosis and UPRE controls the transcription of some UPR effector genes involved in ER-associated protein degradation, such as EDEM [38,45]. Compared to Grp78 and Grp94 promoters, the activation of CHOP promoter by S proteins was very modest (Figure 3C). Moreover, S proteins did not activate UPRE-dependent transcription (Figure 3D). Hence, UPR activation by S proteins is highly selective and in the benefit of the viruses. This is in line with the idea that ER stress-induced apoptosis or ER-associated protein degradation would be undesirable in the early phase of SARS-CoV and HCoV-HKU1 replication. Exactly how S proteins differentially modulate UPR signaling to facilitate viral replication merits further analysis.",

However, TMPRSS2 protease was capable of cleaving SARS-CoV S protein, but not HCoV-HKU1 S protein, into S1 and S1 subunits (Figure 2). Moreover, SARS-CoV S1 protein, but not its counterpart in HCoV-HKU1, was required and sufficient for UPR activation (Figure 6). Cleavability of surface proteins by host proteases is an important virulence determinant in coronaviruses and other viruses such as influenza [1,14,37]. In this connection, it will not be too surprising if the inability of TMPRSS2 to cleave HCoV-HKU1 might affect pathogenesis. It will be even more interesting to see whether the ability of S1 to activate the UPR might be related to viral replication and pathogenesis.",
