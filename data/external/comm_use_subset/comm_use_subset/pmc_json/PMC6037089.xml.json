Study details have been previously described [5, 29\u201331]. The hospital pneumonia etiology study has been ongoing since 2002 and recruits children aged 0\u201359 months of age with signs of severe or very severe pneumonia that prompt admission. The household study recruited 483 participants from 47 households between December 2009 and June 2010, collecting nasopharyngeal flocked swabs from each household member twice weekly irrespective of symptoms. For both studies, samples were initially screened for a panel of respiratory viruses including 3 endemic coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43) using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [32, 33]. A sample threshold cycle (Ct) value of <35.0 was considered positive for the target virus. The 25 pairs of samples for whole-genome sequencing were selected based on having 2 positive NL63 samples >14 days apart. For individual with multiple positive isolates in each period, the samples with the lowest Ct (highest viral load) were selected. Furthermore, to distinguish prolonged shedding from reinfection, pairs were chosen that had at least 4 NL63-negative samples in the intervening period between positive samples.",

When plotted by sample date, 3 patterns were observed. Type 1 pattern: If the total amount of time a subject showed coronavirus-positive samples <14 days or if the subject had only a single coronavirus-positive sample the subject was considered to have a single infection. This group comprised the majority of subjects in the study (Table 2) and no conclusions about repeat infections could be made from this group. If there were at least 2 coronavirus-positive samples and the time between the first and last positive sample was \u226514 days and there were 4 intervening NL6-negative samples, the subject was considered to have a repeat (type 2) infection. A type 2A pattern was defined as having any Ct values in the second half of the period higher than any Ct value in the first half of the period. A type 2B pattern was defined as having any Ct values in the second half of the period lower than any Ct value in the first half of the period. Examples of individuals displaying the 2 patterns are shown in Supplementary Figure 2. The diagnostic results in Supplementary Figure 2A show individuals with low Ct values initial samples and elevated Ct values in the reinfection samples consistent with a protective effect of prior exposure to the virus. In contrast, the diagnostic results in Supplementary Figure 2B show the reverse pattern with at least 1 reinfection Ct value lower than any Ct value in the initial infection, indicating greater virus growth in the second infection. An analysis of the 3 coronavirus infections monitored in the cohort (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43) was performed to document the frequencies of these infection patterns across the entire cohort. HCoV-NL63 showed 21%, HCoV-229E showed 5%, and HCoV-OC43 showed 4% type 2 infections (Table 2). Among the type 2 infections, type 2A pattern (repeat infection higher Ct) was the majority pattern. However, all 3 coronaviruses showed a subset of repeat infections with higher viral loads (reduced Ct values) in the second exposure to the virus (Table 2).",

We attempted to determine if such genotype switching occurred between first and second infections; however, the overall low viral load of the first infections made this challenging. Only a total of 9146 nucleotides of HCoV-NL63 sequence were assembled from the first infections, making it difficult to perform a comparative phylogenetic analysis across pairs. As an alternative approach we applied a more sensitive kmer method to directly genotype the HCoV-NL63 short reads from first and second infection to determine if the repeat infections involved a shift to an alternate HCoV-NL63 genotype. Training sets of all HCoV-NL63 sequences, HCoV-NL63 genotype A sequences, and HCoV-NL63 genotype B sequences (>1000 nt) was retrieved from GenBank and combined with the genotype A or B local spike sequences or the genotype A full genomes. All 30-nt kmer sequences that were present in 1 genotype and not the second were identified (see Methods and Table 3) and these genotype-specific kmers were used to classify the coronavirus reads from all 50 samples. Each read from each sample was examined for the presence of genotype-specific kmers. If 20 such kmers or more were identified with the 300-nt read, the read was classified as genotype A or B. Using this method, 259 reads were classified as HCoV-NL63 using a combined HCoV-NL63 kmer set, and 151 of the HCoV-NL63 reads could be classified by genotype and all 151 were genotype A. Second infections were all classified as genotype A, consistent with the phylogenetic analyses (see Figures 2 and 3), supporting a conclusion that genotype switching between the first and second infection is not required for reinfection.",

The majority of the repeat infections showed a pattern of reduced virus replication after prior exposure, which is consistent with the vaccine principle. Also there are likely to be cases of repeat exposure to the virus where the second infection is blocked and these, of course, would not be detected in our study. However, for all 3 endemic human coronaviruses a subset of repeat infections showed enhanced virus replication in the second infection. Thus it appears that host responses to HCoV-NL63 infections vary and may be dependent on the time elapsed since previous infection (Figure 4C). In addition, we speculate that the host\u2019s prior exposure to the virus, the host\u2019s HLA type, the quantity of virus in inoculum, and the host\u2019s health status may influence the outcome of the exposure. If indeed these viruses exploit the host immune response to enhance infection, this mechanism could account for the low evolutionary rate of these viruses. There would be a negative selection of amino acid changes in immune epitopes that would disrupt this enhancement.",

Nonetheless, we could generate sufficient signal using a kmer approach (Table 3) to conclude that genotype switching did not accompany reinfection. We do realize the limitations of the kmer approach to detect specific differences in the reinfecting virus, such as changes in immune epitopes that might accompany reinfection. Secondly, our understanding of the global migration of HCoV-NL63 was hampered by the small number of HCoV-NL63 sequences available in GenBank. The limited global HCoV-NL63 sequence data meant that we could not infer the origins of HCoV-NL63 strains circulating in Kilifi with any detail. Nonetheless, the global data combined with the new Kilifi data from this report revealed a surprising stability in HCoV-NL63 with genotypes detectable globally over 10\u201315 years of observation. Recent increases in virus sequence surveillance will benefit this field and will provide data for a more detailed understanding of HCoV-NL63 genetic diversity and phylogeography.",

Reinfections with HCoV-NL63 did not require genotype switching and there were multiple cases where the second infections resulted in higher viral loads than the initial infection, revealing ineffective protective immune responses after initial exposure to the virus.
