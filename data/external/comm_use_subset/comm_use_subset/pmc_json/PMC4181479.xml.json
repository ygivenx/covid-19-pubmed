A main purpose of some of these models is to inform public policy regarding the selection and allocation of public health interventions and resources during a pandemic.1 Reliable forecasts of measures such as peak time, peak height, and magnitude during an outbreak would inform public health practitioners and healthcare workers on when to expect a surge in demand for healthcare resources and infrastructure and the overall expected public health impact of an outbreak. Although timely forecasts of these measures would be beneficial, making reliable predictions during an outbreak remains a public health challenge.",

The goal of this paper is therefore to present a systematic review of studies that have discussed approaches for influenza forecasting at the local, regional, national, or global level. The main aims are to (i) summarize existing approaches to influenza forecasting, (ii) present differences in measures of accuracy and evaluate the degree to which various performance measures are met, (iii) discuss limitations in the data sources, and parameter estimation that impede forecasting during outbreaks. The motivation of this paper is to inform further research on influenza forecasting and provide researchers and public health practitioners with a summary of the accomplishments and limitations in influenza forecasting.",

Third, we selected articles that mentioned influenza forecasting as one of the aims in the abstract. After eliminating non-English articles, 35 articles remained. Lastly, we excluded articles focusing on topics such as forecasting emergency department visits, which have already been covered in a previous review.33 The study is therefore based on the remaining 16 articles, which included both prospective and retrospective studies.

Prediction of the epidemic curve made a few days from the peak had an estimated 10\u00b78% percent error, which was much lower than the 91\u00b76% percent error observed using nine fewer data points. Similarly, Soebiyanto et al.12 presented several ARIMA models and evaluated accuracy based on the root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) of one-step-ahead predictions. They also considered the effects of including environmental variables such as humidity and temperature. The preferred models had RMSE approximately in the range of 0\u00b747\u20130\u00b761. Alternatively, Polgreen et al.13 presented a prediction market for influenza forecasting and assessed accuracy based on the proportion of correct predictions of a particular color code representing a level of influenza activity. The prediction markets yielded correct predictions 71%, 50%, and 43% of the time by the end of the target week, 1 week in advance, and 2 weeks in advance, respectively.",

Limitations include reduced application in low-resource countries and deviations from influenza patterns presented by traditional surveillance systems. For example, Cook et al.31 compared H1N1-related search queries on Google Insight to traditional surveillance data for the H1N1 pandemic in Singapore. The outbreak peaked in August 2009; however, search query data suggested an earlier peak and also decreased to about 20% of the search volume around the epidemic's peak time. Furthermore, during the 2012\u20132013 influenza season, estimates of influenza activity provided by Google Flu Trends did not match estimates provided by traditional influenza surveillance systems.32 The challenge therefore remains for timely estimates of influenza activity for weekly forecasts at different geographical levels.",

Practitioners could therefore prepare for surges in influenza cases by acquiring the necessary resources (such as vaccines and antiviral treatments) and alerting essential personnel (such as nurses and doctors). However, forecasts must be interpretable to be useful. It is therefore important for studies to clearly define the predicted event, the temporal and spatial applicability of the approach, quantify the likelihood of the event either based on a probabilistic statement or relative to other similar events, and highlight the limitations (see Figure 1). In addition, defining a global measure of accuracy for evaluating the correctness of various forecasting methods would ease the process of forecast comparison. Lastly, several of the studies discussed in this review are retrospective. The challenge therefore remains in evaluating and quantifying the performance of these methods in real time.",
