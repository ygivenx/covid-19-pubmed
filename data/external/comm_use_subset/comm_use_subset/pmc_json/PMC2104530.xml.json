Recently, the CDC discontinued the administration of the current anthrax vaccine (Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed -AVA) due to adverse side effects observed in a large percentage of volunteers. This revocation of available vaccine has left healthcare workers, laboratory personnel and first responders with only limited means of protection following potential exposures to anthrax spores.",

Although antibiotic therapy is effective in the early stages of infection, it does not have any effect on the bipartite exotoxins, which are the major contributing factors to the mortality observed in acute anthrax infections [1]. The current lack of an approved, available vaccine puts laboratory workers, military personnel and first responders at an increased risk of inhalational anthrax should another terrorist event, similar to the anthrax mailings in 2001, occur. Clearly there is a need for an effective vaccine as well as a well-tolerated, economical, post-exposure therapeutic for the treatment of human anthrax infections.",

This treatment option has been shown to be effective against many diseases including anthrax [2-6] and other biothreat agents [7,8]. Several approaches have been used previously for the production of immunotherapeutics specific for B. anthracis although they all have significant drawbacks. The pooling of immune serum from previously vaccinated volunteers yields highly protective anti-sera in very small quantities, limiting its use as a source of therapeutics for the Strategic National Stockpile or as a commercially available product. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, limiting their application to a single antigenic target and have a high cost associated with their development further limiting their feasibility for mass production and stockpiling. In the past animal vaccination has successfully been used to generate immunotherapeutic antiserum specific for infectious and toxic agents including snake venom, botulism toxin and Ebola virus [9-12] but limitations in quantity and safety have prevented their widespread use in the development of human therapeutics. Horses can provide large amounts of antiserum but are costly to maintain. Mice, rabbits and guinea pigs are inexpensive to maintain but yield limited volumes of anti-sera. Goats provide a renewable source of plasma and serum; however they have not been traditionally used in the generation of passive immunotherapeutics. We have plasmapheresed hyper immunized goats to successfully produce liters of GMP-grade antisera following a short immunization schedule (3 immunizations over 14 weeks), with minimal cost.",

            "text": "Bacillus anthracis produces two separate exotoxins, edema toxin (EdTx) and lethal toxin (LeTx). The two exotoxins utilize a common cell binding component termed protective antigen (PA83, 83 kDa) which binds to the ubiquitous anthrax toxin receptor (ATR) found on most cell surfaces. Once PA83 is bound to the host cell surface, a furin-like protease cleaves the full-length, inactive protein into the active form, PA63 (63 kDa), thereby exposing the binding sites for the catalytic components of the exotoxins (edema factor, EF or lethal factor, LF). A heptamer composed of PA63 + three LF/EF moieties [13,14] forms on the cell surface and is internalized via receptor mediated endocytosis. The subsequent decrease in pH within the endosome causes conformational changes in PA63, so that it inserts into the endosomal membrane, forming a protease-stable pore; formation of this pore allows EF and LF to enter the cell and exert their toxic effects [15]. LeTx is formed when PA63 is combined with LF, and is responsible for the most severe intoxicative effects of anthrax infection. EF is an adenylate cyclase capable of causing severe disregulation of cellular cAMP levels [16]. LF has been shown to be a zinc-dependant metalloprotease with specificity for mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MAPKKs) capable of disrupting several cell signaling cascades; however, its specific mode of action is still unclear [17,18]. Disruption of the binding of PA to ATR or LF would disrupt internalization of functional LeTx and would thereby prevent toxin-mediated death of the host following rapid multiplication of the bacilli.",

Specific rPA83 titers were obtained from immunized goats on days 0, 27, 40, 54, 67, and 94. Antibody titers were measured by ELISA by reacting serially diluted anti-PA83 IgG with 10 nM rPA83. Anti-PA83 IgG demonstrated significant titer (> 10,000, calculated as the reciprocal of the dilution producing 50% maximum absorbance) within 2 weeks (27 d post-immunization), and reached a maximum of ~16,000 after the fourth immunization (Fig. 1).

The ability for the goat derived passive immunotherapeutic to protect against an in vivo LeTx challenge suggests its potential for use as a therapeutic intervention in humans.

Twenty-four hours post-challenge, test groups received 32 mg/kg caprine anti-PA83 IgG by intraperitoneal injection.

By day 6, another 10% of the mice in each group had succumbed to disease and no further mortality was observed through the remaining 14 d study. One test group also received low-dose Ciprofloxacin to examine synergistic effects of post-exposure treatments (Fig. 4B). Mice treated with antibiotics alone exhibited a 50% survival rate out to the end of the study (14 d p.i.). Survival of IgG treated mice dropped to 60% by day 6 p.i. and remained there through the completion of the study. Concomitant administration of Ciprofloxacin (twice daily on days 1\u20136) and anti-PA83 IgG (single bolus at 24 h p.i.) completely protected mice for 6 days (Fig. 4B) while Ciprofloxacin was administered. When Ciprofloxacin treatment was stopped, survival decreased to levels comparable to anti-PA83 IgG treatment alone. These results confirm the potential for passive transfer of immunity up to 24 hours post exposure to B. anthracis spores and suggest parallel treatment with antibiotics can significantly enhance survival.",

Smaller animals are typically terminally bled in order to produce larger volumes of serum. Yields from a terminal bleed typically range from 0.5 ml for mice up to 200 ml for terminally bled rabbits. The large number of animals required to produce the therapeutic quantities needed for a useful medical countermeasure stockpile (e.g., the SNS) makes these animal models prohibitively expensive. Caprine plasmapheresis does not require the animals to be euthanized/terminally bled in order to generate large volumes of antisera. Additionally, the goats can be plasmapheresed up to four times per year for several years making for a nearly endless source of antisera. Plasmapheresis of three goats generated liters of anti-PA83 serum within a very short time frame. Additionally, the goats used to produce this material are part of a certified pathogen-free herd and the antisera produced are of GMP grade.

Many monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been generated that are specific for the anthrax protective antigen. The majority of these MAbs do not demonstrate significant protection post-exposure and appear to require a blend of several MAbs in order to reduce the mortality associated with anthrax infections [32,33]. A recent study using a monoclonal antibody against the anthrax protective antigen demonstrated a requirement for the Fc portion of the antibody in order to retain neutralizing capabilities [25]. Our polyclonal immunotherapeutic retained similar neutralizing levels both in vitro and in vivo after removal of the Fc region by pepsin digestion. These findings are consistent with data from other polyclonal antiserum, which indicate most F(ab')2 retain comparable neutralizing and protective abilities to full length IgG [26,29,30,34]. The utility of F(ab')2 antisera derived from goats will reduce the potential for side-effects associated with patients who have a pre-existing sensitivity to goat proteins. In addition, patients requiring multiple treatments with an animal derived therapeutic may also be at increased risk of developing allergic hypersensitivity, so the use of F(ab')2 antibody fragments will decrease this risk and increase the overall safety of this immunotherapeutic for multiple uses within a large population.",

Three goats immunized four times over a 56 day period produced liters of GMP grade, high titer antisera that was capable of neutralizing anthrax lethal toxin both in vitro and in vivo. More importantly the passive transfer of the goat-derived antibodies 24 h post-exposure to virulent anthrax spores provided mice with a substantial survival advantage over untreated mice. A synergistic effect was seen with concomitant antibiotic treatment although levels of protection returned to the levels observed with IgG treatment alone once antibiotic therapy was discontinued. This indicates that a combined treatment approach for patients presenting with clinical signs of anthrax infection could overall increase in survival rates associated with symptomatic disease. Additionally, this immunotherapeutic can be easily produced in quantities large enough to fulfill the requirements for a national medical countermeasures stockpile. The non-toxic MDP adjuvant developed is easily produced; amenable to covalent attachment of antigens, and importantly, renders toxins and pathogens inactive once coupled to the molecule. The use of this novel adjuvant should improve vaccine development and quality control in addition to eliciting significantly higher immune responses than standard adjuvants.",
