The quantitation of gene expression requires sensitive, precise, and reproducible measurements for specific mRNA sequences. Generally, gene expression levels can be determined by a variety of techniques, including Northern blotting, RNase protection assay, semi-quantitative reverse-transcription PCR, and real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)\n[4]. RT-qPCR has gained favor as it is a highly sensitive, accurate, and fast technique that offers high-throughput and the ability to detect low-abundance mRNAs\n[6] and quantify mRNA copy number\n[7]. Thus, RT-qPCR has been used for countless different applications\n[1-5].",

            "text": "One of the main uses of RT-qPCR, when coupled with reverse transcription, is to measure gene expression at the mRNA level in various biological samples. However, there is substantial technical variability associated with RT-qPCR, arising from inherent differences in samples, sample collection, RNA degradation and extraction efficiency, quantity and quality of input RNA, reverse transcription and PCR efficiency, and pipetting accuracy or error. Researchers have employed a number of strategies to normalize their data, including normalization to (i) genomic DNA, (ii) total RNA, (iii) an external standard, and (iv) a reference gene. The most common practice is to normalize to an internal control gene termed a reference gene. A reference gene is subject to the same errors in cDNA preparation as the gene of interest, making it an excellent normalizing control. However, selection of an inappropriate reference gene can add large unpredictable error to the analysis and result in incorrect estimates\n[8]. The ideal reference gene should have a stable RNA transcription level under different experimental conditions and be sufficiently abundant across different tissues and cell types. However, it has become apparent that such an ideal reference gene has not yet been identified\n[9]. The most commonly used reference genes, including \u03b2-actin, cyclophilin, GAPDH, tubulin, and 18S and 28S ribosomal RNAs, have shown variable expression levels in different cells and tissues under different conditions, and therefore they are unsuitable for normalization purposes owing to large measurement error\n[6,10-33]. Hence, it is no longer acceptable to arbitrarily select any reference gene for normalization; it must be demonstrated that the reference gene of choice is suitable for the experiment in question.",

Azoles such as fluconazole are the first-line drugs for the treatment of fungal infections caused by C. glabrata. However, resistance to azoles can arise rapidly in C. glabrata during treatment of patients with azoles\n[36]. An increasing body of evidence has implicated ATP-binding cassette transporters (e.g., Cdr1 and Pdr1) and sterol biosynthetic enzymes (e.g., Erg3 and Erg11) in azole resistance in C. glabrata in both clinical and laboratory settings\n[1,34-37]. The expression of these genes in C. glabrata in response to azoles is not completely understood. Therefore, we set out to establish an in vitro model for investigating azole-inducible gene expression in C. glabrata, using RT-qPCR. For reliable gene expression analysis, a compulsory step is the selection of good reference genes for normalization; however, no validated reference genes have been reported for the relative quantification of the mRNA expression profile in C. glabrata following exposure to azoles.",

All samples gave only a single peak, indicating a single pure product and no primer/dimer formation. Real-time PCR efficiencies were acquired by amplification of a standardized dilution series of the template cDNA and were determined for each gene as the slope of a linear regression model. PCR efficiency was determined by measuring the CT to a specific threshold for a serial dilution of cDNA. The corresponding real-time PCR efficiencies were then calculated according to the equation:\nE=10\u22121/slope\u22121\u00d7100. All PCRs displayed efficiencies between 94% and 119%.",

The hkgFinder software computes the pooled standard deviation (SD) of non-normalized expression data from both phenotypes (i.e., azole-treated and untreated C. glabrata cells), the fold change (FC) values between the two phenotypes, and Student\u2019s t-tests of the log2 fold-change values with Holm-adjusted P-values. The reference genes with the smallest SD and the smallest, non-significant FC are identified as the best potential reference genes (Additional file\n4). The geNorm software computes a stability value (M) and a pairwise variation (V), which are used to evaluate each individual reference gene candidate or each combination of reference genes, called a normalization factor (NF). The pairwise variability V of two genes j and k is the standard deviation of all log2 ratios of aj/ak, while the stability value M of gene j is the mean of all possible pairwise variations Vjk. Graphs of the M values help identify the best individual reference genes, and graphs of the V values identify the optimal number of reference genes for an NF. Note that an earlier version called geNorm Excel was produced as an add-in for MS Excel and it required several hand calculations to convert crossing point (CP) values into relative expression values. That version is now unavailable and the new geNorm PLUS from Biogazelle does not require those hand calculations. The BestKeeper software uses pairwise correlation to determine whether potential reference genes should be included in a BestKeeper Index, which is simply the geometric mean of the CP or cycle threshold (CT) values. The NormFinder software computes a different type of stability value (\u03c1ig) based on the intragroup and intergroup variation of the expression data. The software instructions from each package were followed when inputting the RT-qPCR data, fetching the output, and interpreting the analysis results.",

Our aim was to identify reference genes with minimal variability under our experimental conditions. To this end, RT-qPCR was used to measure the RNA transcription levels of 16 reference genes in C. glabrata cells following fluconazole treatment. To compare the different RNA transcription levels after azole exposure, the CT values of the reference genes were directly compared between the drug-treated (t) and untreated (ut) samples using the formula: CT Change = CT(ut) \u2212 CT(t). The CT is defined as the number of cycles needed for the fluorescence signal to reach a specific threshold level of detection and is inversely correlated with the amount of template cDNA present in the reaction. Thus, a higher value of CT Change indicates lower stability of a reference gene, considering that the expression of a reference gene should not change significantly with azole treatment. As expected, the RNA transcription levels of the reference genes varied (Table\n2). The three ribosomal RNA subunits RDN5.8, RDN18, and RDN25 were the most stable reference genes, with CT Change values less than 0.5, while UBC13, PGK1, and UBC7 were relatively stable with CT Change values of only around 1.5. By contrast, the other 10 reference genes showed marked variation in response to fluconazole. Among them, the most prominent variation was found in the RNA transcription levels of SDHA, ACT1, and RPL13A; as seen in Table\n2, the CT Change values of these reference genes were as high as 5.03.",

Standard curves were generated by plotting the dilutions of the cDNA of each gene against the CT values. The linear correlation coefficient (r2) for all 10 target genes and the six reference genes ranged from 0.98 to 1.0. Based on these slopes of the standard curves, the amplification efficiencies of the cDNA standards, derived from the formula E = (10\u22121/slope \u22121) \u00d7 100, ranged from 94 to 119%. The CT values of all 16 genes in the samples were within the range of the standard curves. Next, the \u0394CT (\u0394CT = CTtarget \u2212 CTreference) was calculated using the CT values generated from standard curve mass points (target vs. reference gene). These \u0394CT values were then plotted versus log10 input amount of cDNA to create a semi-log regression line. The slope of the resulting semi-log regression line was used as a general criterion for passing a validation experiment. In a validation experiment that passes, the absolute value of the slope of \u0394CT versus log10 input cDNA would be <;0.1, meaning the two CT versus log10 concentration curves are nearly parallel. As seen in Table\n5, our validation experiments passed for all reference genes analyzed except RDN18, which had an absolute value >0.1 for the slopes of \u0394CT versus log10 input cDNA for all 10 target genes evaluated. Thus, the amplification efficiency of RDN18 was clearly different from that of the ten target genes, whereas the other five reference genes (ACT1, PGK1, RDN5.8, UBC7, and UBC13) had PCR efficiencies that were similar or relatively equivalent to the target amplification efficiencies (Table\n5).",

For comparison, we used both RDN5.8 and ACT1 as references for normalization. As shown in Table\n6, fluconazole markedly induced increases in ERG4 mRNA levels in all C. glabrata strains examined when normalized to RDN5.8. Fluconazole also significantly increased CDR1 and PDR1 mRNA expression in all of the strains except CgB4, consistent with the critical role of PDR1 in azole-induced transactivation of ABC transporter gene expression, but not ergosterol biosynthesis gene expression, in C. glabrata.

Differences in quantitation were detected according to the reference genes used. As seen in Table\n7, normalization of the RT-qPCR data against the reference genes suggested as optimal by the four software packages (hkgFinder, geNorm, BestKeeper, and NormFinder) or the 2-\u0394\u0394CT method, gave comparable relative expression levels of the target genes under fluconazole treatment in C. glabrata. However, normalization against ACT1 resulted in relative expression levels of the targets that were substantially different from those normalized using other reference genes, implying that ACT1 is not a suitable reference gene for these studies. Taken together with the data shown above, these results demonstrate that the relative quantification of azole-inducible gene expression varies largely depending on the reference gene and the number of reference genes used for normalization. This highlights the importance of choosing a suitable reference gene or reference gene pair when using RT-qPCR to determine the level of target gene expression in this model system.",

When choosing a reference gene as the internal endogenous control for gene expression studies by RT-qPCR, two important criteria must be met. The expression of the reference gene must remain stable throughout the given intervention (i.e., stability), and the amplification efficiency of the reference gene should be similar to that of the genes of interest (i.e., suitability). In the present study, we used five different methods to evaluate 16 reference genes for potential use as internal controls and found that the reference genes performed differently in terms of stability and suitability in C. glabrata cells upon exposure to fluconazole.

Our data clearly demonstrate the unsuitability of ACT1 as an internal control for gene expression studies in C. glabrata following fluconazole treatment. The initial results gained from using ACT1 as the internal control suggested that target gene expression was not up-regulated (Tables\n6 and\n7). In fact, the only substantial change caused by azole treatment was a greater increase in ACT1 RNA transcription compared with target gene transcription. While these findings are relevant to our specific study, it appears that numerous other studies have also shown the potential of ACT1 to detrimentally affect the accuracy of results\n[11,12,15,19,26,27,29,30,32,33,45-47]. We have been using ACT1 as the internal control for quantitation of gene expression by RT-qPCR in clinical isolates of C. glabrata, and we find that this gene works well as the reference in cells without azole or other agent stimulation\n[1]. However, Edlind and colleagues used ACT1 as the reference gene for azole-inducible gene expression studies by slot blotting in Candida species, and their data clearly show the variation of ACT1 expression in response to azoles in their systems\n[34,38]. Thus, our data revealing the instability of ACT1 in C. glabrata following antifungal treatment, combined with evidence from mammalian and other fungus studies, add to the growing body of evidence that ACT1 expression is unstable across various cell types and under different experimental conditions\n[11,12,15,26,27,29,30,32,33,45-47].",

These results indicate that ribosomal RNA expression offers superior consistency compared with the expression of ACT1 and the other reference genes assessed. The stable expression levels of 18S and 28S rRNAs relative to other reference genes under a variety of experimental conditions has previously been described for numerous systems, including both mammalian and yeast cells\n[10,11,15,18,23,30,48-50]. The levels of ribosomal RNA, which represents 80% of total RNA, are thought to be less likely to vary under conditions that affect the expression of mRNAs because they are transcribed by a distinct RNA polymerase. As an example, Thellin et al. and other groups have recommended the use of 18S or 28S rRNA as an internal control for mRNA quantification studies because mRNA variations are weak and cannot highly modify the total RNA level\n[10,11,15,18,30,39,48-52]. However, our further validation experiments showed that of slopes of \u0394CT versus log10 cDNA were sufficiently parallel between RDN5.8 and the target genes, but not between RDN18 or RDN25 and the target genes. With RDN18 and RDN25, the absolute slope values of the \u0394CT versus log10 input cDNA lines were >0.1 for all target genes. These data indicate that the amplification efficiency of RDN5.8 was similar to the efficiencies of the target genes, whereas the amplification efficiencies of RDN18 and RDN25 were different from the target gene amplification efficiencies. This may be attributable to the much higher abundance of RDN18 and RDN25 than RDN5.8 compared with target mRNA transcripts, making it difficult to accurately subtract the baseline value in RT-qPCR data analysis. Therefore, although all three ribosomal RNA subunits were stable during fluconazole stimulation, only RDN5.8 may offer a more accurate and suitable alternative to ACT1 as an internal control for gene expression studies in C. glabrata.",

PGK1 mRNA levels remained relatively stable, in contrast to the marked variation in GAPDH mRNA levels in C. glabrata cells, following fluconazole challenge. Moreover, our comparative CT calculations showed that the efficiency of PGK1 amplification was approximately equal to the efficiencies of the target gene amplifications. Although PGK1 shows some variation as a reference gene, this may not affect experimental results as long as the intergroup difference being measured is greater than the reference gene variation, that is, a reference gene RNA that has an error of 1 log2 may not be ideal, but it would be sufficient to measure a 2 log2 change in a gene of interest.

            "text": "Although it is now widely accepted that normalizing to a single reference gene represents a strategy that is simple to use and can control for every stage of the RT-qPCR, some researchers also advocate the use of two or more reference genes, rather than relying on a single RNA transcript\n[9,10,44,59]. This is a robust method for providing accurate normalization and is consequently preferable when fine measurements are to be made. According to Vandesompele et al.\n[9], the purpose of normalization is to remove the sampling difference (such as RNA quantity and quality) in order to identify real gene-specific variation. They provided evidence that a conventional normalization strategy based on a single gene can lead to erroneous normalization. However, it is not always possible to measure multiple reference genes because of limited sample availability and cost. Furthermore, even when multiple genes are chosen, the resolution of the particular assay remains dependent on the variability of the chosen reference genes. As to our case, the geNorm analysis using the geometric mean of the expression of the 16 candidate cDNAs suggested the use of RDN5.8, RDN18, and RDN25 in combination or the combination of these three ribosomal RNAs plus UBC13 and PGK1 as the reference control in the current study. However, the geNorm assessment is based solely on the variability of reference genes and does not take other factors into account. For example, we found that although RDN18 and RDN25 were quite stable, their amplification efficiencies were not equal to the amplification efficiencies of all target genes tested; thus, they may not be suitable as internal controls in our system. Therefore, when multiple reference genes are necessary, we believe that the combination of RDN5.8 plus UBC13 and/or PGK1 would be a better choice for quantitation of gene expression by RT-qPCR in C. glabrata following azole stimulation.",

To our knowledge, this is the first identification and validation of RDN5.8, UBC13, and PGK1 as the most suitable and stably expressed reference genes among the 16 reference genes tested. Therefore, we recommend the use of RDN5.8, UBC13, or PGK1 alone or the geometric mean of these genes as standards for normalization when analyzing differences in gene expression levels in C. glabrata during antifungal treatment. More specifically, RDN5.8 may be a more suitable reference gene for the analysis of expression for genes with lower azole-inducible mRNA levels, while UBC13 and PGK1 may be better internal controls for quantifying the expression of genes with higher azole-inducible mRNA levels in C. glabrata. In contrast, we demonstrated that 10 reference genes commonly used in published reports, including ACT1, GAPDH, PPIA, RPL13A, and TUB1, had significant differences in their expression upon azole challenge, and thus were not validated as good endogenous controls in this model. As a main conclusion, this study emphasizes the importance of evaluation studies for the selection of the most appropriate internal controls for each experimental model used for quantitative expression studies.",

For example, V5/6 represents the comparison of the normalization factors from five and six reference genes, respectively. On the left-most side is the pairwise variation when the number of reference genes is increased from two to three (V2/3). Stepwise inclusion of less stable genes generates the subsequent data points. A decrease in the V value indicates a positive effect and means that the added gene should preferably be included for calculation of a reliable normalization factor. The cutoff value for V, below which the inclusion of an additional reference gene does not result in a significant improvement of normalization, was set at 0.15. It was apparent from the analysis of all studied samples that the combination of the two most stable reference genes is the best option and the combination of the five most stable reference genes is the second-best option for accurate normalization",
