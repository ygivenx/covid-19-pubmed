            "text": "Bluetongue virus (BTV), a double-strand RNA (dsRNA) virus, is the prototype virus in the genus Orbivirus within the family Reoviridae. The segmented BTV dsRNA genome encodes ten viral proteins (VP), including seven structural proteins (VP1-7) and three non-structural (NS) proteins, NS1, NS2 and NS3 [1], [2], [3]. As a member of arboviruses, BTV is transmitted by certain species of Culicoides biting midges, including C. variipennis and C. imocola\n[4], [5]. Bluetongue disease is a non-contagious viral disease affecting domestic animals including sheep and cattle primarily, as well as wild ruminants such as buffalo, antelope, deer, elk and camels. BTV disease is one of the most important diseases of domestic livestock, causing $3 billion per year loss worldwide [6], [7]. In sheep, the disease is acute, and mortality is accordingly high [8]. BTV is listed under the Office International des Epizooties (OIE) Terrestrial Animal Health Code \u20132009 [2]. Exotic BTV is also listed in the \u201cUSDA High Consequence Livestock Pathogens.\" Due to its economic significance, BTV has been the subject of extensive molecular virology and structural biology studies [9], [10], [11]. The recent development of the BTV reverse genetics system facilitates our understanding toward the BTV viral life-cycle, the structural and functional interrelationship among viral proteins [12], [13], [14]. Hence, BTV is now one of the well-characterized viruses [6], [9], [15].",

Vaccination is used as the most effective and practical measure to minimize losses related to BTV disease and to potentially interrupt the cycle from infected animal to vector [18], [19], [20]. However, due to the complexity of the virus, including the twenty-four different serotypes that have the ability of causing variable diseases, BTV is still endemic in many regions despite the high vaccine coverage in sheep and cattle [21], [22], [23], [24]. The 1998\u20132001 outbreak of BTV-8 in the Mediterranean Basin is the greatest epizootic of the disease on record, showing that BTV has extended its range northwards into areas of Europe that were never affected before, and has since persisted in many of these locations [6], [25], [26], [27]. In 2006, BTV-8 has reached three northern Europe countries, including the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany [28], [29], and further spread to surrounding countries, reaching Switzerland by the end of October 2007 [6], [30], [31], [32].",

Hence, only a drug can be offered as a therapeutic treatment of individuals/animals in an endemic area [33]. Surprisingly, there are no antiviral currently available against BTV disease. Recently, anti-BTV drug discovery has been implemented and potential antiviral lead compound(s) has been identified [34]. The development and validation of a cytopathic effect (CPE)-based assay led to the screening of the NIH Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository (MLSMR), with 194,950 small molecule compounds then. Further studies, using various primary, secondary and confirmatory assays, confirmed 185 structures that were grouped into six analog series corresponding to six scaffolds enriched within the active set compared to their distribution in the library [34]. Based on the results from the previous studies [34], we selected and evaluated the virostatic efficacy of a cluster of active compounds, in particular, the aminothiophenecarboxylic acid derivatives. Furthermore, aiming to understand their mechanism of action, various studies were carried out to determine which viral life stage(s) these compounds acted on, focusing on how these virostatic compounds protect cells from BTV-induced apoptosis.",

The EC50 of these lead compounds were determined between 0.7 \u00b5M and 20 \u00b5M, respectively (results not shown). Interestingly, the four thiophene derivative compounds from cluster I, i.e. compound 001 through 004 (C001, C002, C003 and C004), showed potent virostatic efficacy against BTV, especially the aminothiophenecarboxylic acid derivatives C001 and C003. Using the ten-concentration dose response assay, the EC50s of C001 and C003 were determined at 0.69\u00b10.15 \u00b5M and 1.76\u00b10.73 \u00b5M, respectively (Fig. 1A and B). The EC90s of C001 and C003 were at 6.20\u00b11.39 \u00b5M and 15.86\u00b16.56 \u00b5M, respectively (Fig. 1A and B). The above results indicated that both C001 and C003 could be potential novel virostatic agents against BTV. Additionally, the 50% cytotoxicity concentration (CC50) of both C001 and C003 were over 100 \u00b5M (Fig. 1A and B). Accordingly, the selective indexes (SI50), which equals to EC50/CC50, were above 145 and 57 for C001 and C003, respectively, indicating that both compounds were highly selective against BTV. Considering the compound solubility and availability, we selected C003 as the lead virostatic agent for further evaluation, including structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis, chemical modification and mechanism of action studies.",

In order to observed both the enhancement and reduction of virostatic efficacy at different time of addition, we used two concentrations of virostatic compound for both C003 and C052, i.e., the C003 at 1.76 \u00b5M and 20 \u00b5M, and C052 at 0.27 \u00b5M and 2.5 \u00b5M, respectively. We first observed that adding virostatic compound C003 or C052 at 1 or 2 hours prior to BTV infection, i.e. \u22121 and \u22122 h.p.i., did not change their virostatic efficacies. This result indicated that both C003 and C052 might not act on the early stage of viral life-cycle, such as virus entry (Fig. 8A and B). Interestingly, when the compounds were added to BTV infected cells as later as 24 h.p.i., both C003 and C052 showed similar protection in term of the percentage of viable cells. When added at 32 h.p.i., the percentage of viable cells decreased in both C003 and C052 treatment samples, comparing with their protection in the initial 24 h.p.i., indicating that both C003 and C052 were less protective post certain stage(s) of viral life-cycle. When C003 and C052 were added at 48 h.p.i., both compounds showed no protection to BSR cells from BTV-induced CPE (Fig. 8A and B). Since the first cycle of BTV viral replication usually completed in infected cells within 24 h.p.i., our results suggested that C003 and C052 might not act at the early stage of BTV viral life-cycle, including virus entry and uncoating, but rather at the late stage of BTV viral life-cycle, such as virus replication, packaging, maturation and egress. Meanwhile, it is also possible that these compounds may act on host cellular machineries that were involved during late viral life-cycle.",

BTV viral genomic RNA copies were determined in both cell and supernatant samples using the real time qRT-PCR (Fig. 9A and B). The correspondence of viral genomic RNA replication and virus progeny production in these samples were confirmed by evaluating the amount of infectious virus using standard plaque assay (Fig. 9C and D). Samples were collected post BTV infection and divided into cells and supernatants portion at different time in the initial 24 h.p.i., with and without treatments of C003 (10 \u00b5M) and C052 (2.5 \u00b5M), respectively. When infected at low MOI (0.01), the viral genomic RNA copies and progeny virus titers obtained from in cell samples represent the events occurred inside the cells for the initial viral-life cycle, including virus entry, replication and maturation within the cells. The viral genomic RNA copies and virus titers in the supernatant samples denotes the events post virus life-cycle inside the cells in the initial 24 h.p.i., including the amount of viruses exited from the cells. At early time points including 3 and 6 h.p.i., there were no differences in viral genomic RNA copies in samples collected from both supernatant and cells, whether treated with C003/C052 or not, indicating that early viral life cycle, such as the entry of BTV into the cells, were not interfered (Fig. 9 A and B). Meanwhile, there is no detectable progeny virus production in all samples (Fig. 9C and D). At 24 h.p.i., there were pronounced reductions, around two-log, of virus genomic RNA copies and virus titers in supernatant samples with C003/C052 treatment, when compared with these in the supernatant samples without C003/C052 treatment. In supernatant samples collected at 24 h.p.i from BTV infected but without C003/C052 treatment, there were 6.17\u00d7106 copies of BTV viral genomic RNA, while there were only 4.81\u00d7104 or 4.22\u00d7104 copies of BTV viral genomic RNA in samples treated with C003 or C052, respectively (Fig. 9B). This result indicated a pronounced effect of these virostatic agents at the late stage of viral life-cycle. However, C003/C052 might also inhibit virus replication directly, since there was a one-log difference in the viral genomic RNA copies and virus titers when comparing samples from infected cells with and without C003/C052 treatments (Fig. 9A).",

            "text": "Based on the data presented above, we hypothesized that C003/C052 might act on host machineries/pathways involved in the viral life-cycle, including the autophagic pathway. Autophagy is one of the major pathways for the degradation and turnover of long-lived proteins and organelles in cells during cell starvation or upon various stimuli, such as virus infection [39], [40], [41], [42]. Growing evidences suggest that autophagy actively participates in various pathogenic infections, including the formation of autophagosome for the replication of Influenza A virus [43], [44], [45], hepatitis C virus [46], [47] and Dengue virus [48]. The turnover of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-I (LC3-I) to LC3-II, or the ratio of LC3-I and LC3-II, is the only biomarker that is reliably associated with the formation of autophagosome. This is also related to virus replication and the leading indicator of virus-induced apoptosis. Since C003 and C052 prevented BTV-induced apoptosis, we examined the activation and formation of autophagy in BTV-infected cells, with and without virostatic compound treatment. When infected at MOI of 0.01, autophagy was not activated at 24 h post BTV infection as the level of LC3-II showed no difference in sample with or without C003/C052 treatment. However, at 48 h.p.i., there was a turnover of LC3-I to LC3-II in BTV infected cells without C003/C052 treatment, with the LC3-I/LC3-II ratio at 0.05 which indicating most of LC3-I was cleaved into LC3-II (Fig. 10). The turnover of LC3-I to LC3-II was at a much lower level when C003 at 10\u00b5M or C052 at 2.5 \u00b5M was added to the BTV-infected cells, with the ratio of LC3-I/LC3-II at 0.83 and 0.71 respectively (Fig. 10). This result suggested that C003/C052 might act on interfering with BTV induced autophagy, consequently, inhibiting BTV-induced CPE.",

Much of the efforts were focused on developing vaccines against BTV, including the attenuated BTV and VLPs [18], [49], [50]. In contrast, it remains under-investigated to utilize the knowledge from the molecular and virological studies for antiviral drug discovery. Here, we reported the characterization of a novel class of compound as virostatic agents against BTV. These compounds, i.e. the thiophene derivatives, have been identified as active compounds in various assays, including as an enhancer of survival motor neuron protein splice variant expression; an activator for alpha-synuclein 5\u2032UTR - 5\u2032-UTR binding, and for STAT1 activation [51]. It is plausible that the aminothiophenecarboxylic acid derivative\u2013C003 was identified as a novel compound against BTV, with potent virostatic efficacy, low cytotoxicity and high SI. More interestingly, the preliminary SAR analysis of C003 leads to an improved virostatic compound\u2013C052, via de novo synthesis. Our studies suggest that using C003/C052 as lead compounds, it is possible to develop novel and potent antivirals against BTV via chemical modification, while maintain its low toxicity and high selectivity.",

            "text": "For the majority of RNA viruses, the induction of apoptosis, which facilitates the virus dissemination, is an essential step in the late stage of viral life-cycle. Interfering the host apoptotic machinery, especially inhibiting the virus induced apoptosis, will disrupt the successful viral life-cycle via blocking virus release [52], [53], [54]. Thus, host apoptotic response post virus infection is an attractive target for antiviral drug development because it is a common and indispensible late step for a productive viral life-cycle of many, if not all, viruses. Previous studies have shown that BTV infection triggers apoptosis via both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways [1], [37], [55]. The induction of apoptosis is involved in BTV-induced pathogenesis in vivo\n[56], [57]. Our mechanism of action studies indicated that C003 and C052 were active by protecting cells from BTV-induced apoptosis. The inhibition of caspsse-3/7 activation indicated the targets should be in the upstream of the cascade of caspase activation. However, when BSR cells were treated with pan-caspase inhibitor, including Z-VAD-FMK, cells were not protected from BTV-induced apoptosis. BTV-induced CPE was observed, and BTV replication was not interrupted (results not shown). This suggested that while apoptosis/CPE was inhibit by C003/C052, the mechanism of action of these virostatic compounds might not directly related to BTV-induced apoptotic pathways, rather as a results of inhibiting a late step in viral life-cycle or host machineries inducing upstream apoptotic signals.",

            "text": "Interestingly, our results showed that the host autophagy machinery/pathway was inhibited by C003 and/or C052, as LC3-II, the only reliable autophagy marker, was down-regulated when BTV-infected cells were treated with these compounds (Fig. 10). Autophagy is a highly conserved process in eukaryotes in which the cytoplasm, including excess or aberrant organelles, is sequestered into double-membrane vesicles and delivered to the degradative organelle, the lysosome/vacuole, for breakdown and eventual recycling of the resulting macromolecules [44], [47], [58]. Autophagy is activated as an adaptive response to a variety of extracellular and intracellular stimuli, including nutrient deprivation, hormonal or therapeutic treatment, aggregated and misfolded proteins, damaged organelles and microbial infection [58], [59], [60]. Although the autophagy pathway might be a host defense mechanism, different viruses have developed various strategies to counteract these antiviral mechanisms, and/or to utilize the autophagy machinery as proviral host factors favoring viral replication [46], [61]. Recently, a growing list of viruses has been shown to be targeted for autophagic degradation [62]. For instance, autophagy is actively involved in influenza A virus replication by triggering autophagosome formation, increasing the level of LC3-II and enhanced autophagic flux [45]. Dengue virus can also activate autophagic machinery that is favorable for viral replication [48], [63], and autophagosomes act as a site for translation and replication of dengue virus-2 and that its entry and replication are linked through an ongoing association with membranes of an endosomal\u2013autophagosomal lineage [64], [65]. Similarly, induction of autophagy pathways can enhance the replication of poliovirus and coronavirus [66], [67]. During the infection of dsRNA virus rotavirus, nonstructural protein 4 (NSP4) colocalized with LC3 in cap-like structures associated with viroplasms, the site of nascent viral RNA replication, suggesting a possible new mechanism for the involvement of NSP4 in virus replication [68], [69]. Our finding showed that C003 and C052 interacted with autophagy machinery, which may lead to a new research avenue to develop novel antivirals intervene virus-autophagy interactions.",

This is mainly due to the lack of information on the mechanism of egress/dissemination. Interestingly, further studies showed that autophagy may assist poliovirus egress. During Poliovirus and Coxsackievirus B3 infection, the co-localization of non-structural proteins with autophagy markers LC3-II, together with gene silencing and pharmacological experiments, indicate that autophagy proteins enhance viral replication and progeny virus yields. In BTV, the viral NS3 may act like the membrane protein of enveloped viruses and is responsible for intracellular trafficking and budding of virus particles [71]. Virostatics targeting virus egress would be predicted to prevent or slow down virus release and spread in an infected host, thus allowing more time for the individual\u2019s immune system to respond and control the infection [72]. Further studies on the role of autophagy during BTV progeny virus egress/dissemination may help to understand the exact mechanism of action for C003/C052.",
