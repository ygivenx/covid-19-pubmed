            "text": "The cytokine IL-33 is the 11th member of the IL-1 family and is designated as IL-1F11. It is now described as a DAMP (damage-associated molecular patterns) or \u201calarmin\u201d molecule that is normally restrained to the nuclear compartment where it could act as a nuclear factor-regulating gene expression [1] but is released in case of pathogen aggression or injury to alert the immune system [2, 3]. Once released from the cells, IL-33 mediates its function through interaction with its specific receptor a dimer of ST2 (IL-1 receptor-like 1) and IL-1RacP (IL-1 receptor accessory protein) [4]. IL-33 has been described to be constitutively expressed in cell-lining tissues like endothelial cells, epithelial cells, keratinocytes, and fibroblasts but could also be induced in other cells like hepatocytes [5]. IL-33 released into the extracellular space after cell damage could be active as a full-length form (~33 kDa), but proteases have been shown to regulate IL-33 activity. For instance, in case of apoptosis, caspases 3 and 7 cleaved IL-33 generating two biologically inactive form of IL-33 [6], whereas during inflammation, neutrophil serine proteases, cathepsin G, and elastase were found to process IL-33 into mature forms of ~20 kDa with increased biological activity (by 10-fold) [7]. The ST2 receptor is expressed in both innate and adaptive immune cells and is predominantly associated with type 2 immune response [4]. The ST2-expressing cells, a target of IL-33, are macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, recently described nuocytes, or innate lymphoid cells such as ILC2 [8], Th2 cells, but could also be transient on the surface of Th1 cells [9] and antiviral CD8+ T cells [10].",

            "text": "The IL-33/ST2 axis has been described in various pathologies and affected organs, and it induced deleterious or protective effects [11, 12] depending upon the immune mediators and inflammatory milieu. In liver pathology, we and others reported increased level of serum IL-33 and ST2 not only in acute and chronic hepatic failure in humans but also in patients chronically affected with hepatitis C and hepatitis B viruses (HCV and HBV) in correlation with liver damage [13\u201316]. Upregulated expression of IL-33 was reported in a murine model of T cell-mediated hepatitis mice infected with hepatotropic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) [10, 17]. In LCMV hepatitis, IL-33 induced hepatoprotective by promoting innate IFN\u03b3 production and modulating dendritic cells response, driving an antiviral CD8+ T cell response [10, 17]. In another mouse model of adenoviral hepatitis, the expression of IL-33 and ST2 was observed in the liver in the first week of infection, and it attenuated liver injury via an increase in a number of regulatory T cells (Treg) and decrease in a number of macrophages, dendritic cells, and NK cells in the liver [18]. However, there is a paucity of data regarding endogenous IL-33 deficiency on immunomodulatory effect in viral hepatitis. The present study investigated the role of IL-33 in the natural model of acute hepatitis in mice induced by specific mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV3). The hepatotropic and pathogenic MHV3 strain (L2-MHV3) induced severe fulminant hepatitis in mice and their death within 3\u20135 days postinfection [19], mimicking a human viral hepatitis. We previously demonstrated L2-MHV3-induced overexpression of IL-33 in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, vascular endothelial cells, and hepatocytes [20]. Here, infecting wild-type (WT) and IL-33-deficient mice (IL-33 KO) with L2-MHV3, we showed that the alarmin IL-33 ameliorated the L2-MHV3-mediated liver injury through the regulation of IFN\u03b3 expression, survival effect on immune cells, and neutrophil infiltration in viral hepatitis.",

At protein level, we demonstrated that the upregulated transcript expression was associated with an increased expression of the full-length IL-33 protein in total liver extract of WT mice (Figure 1(b), indicated with an arrow) and a short form of IL-33 with a molecular weight of ~20 kDa (Figure 1(b), indicated with a star) especially at 72 h PI. The immunostaining of liver tissues revealed that IL-33 was initially expressed only in the sinusoidal and vascular endothelial cells in the liver of control WT mice (Figure 1(c), brown staining in PBS condition) and induced in the nuclei of hepatocytes during L2-MHV3 infection (48 h and 72 h PI) (Figure 1(c), arrow). The number of IL-33-expressing hepatocytes was significantly increased following L2-MHV3 infection with a higher number at 72 h PI (Figure 1(d)). To ascertain the direct induction of IL-33 in hepatocytes by L2-MHV3, freshly isolated primary mouse hepatocytes (PMH) were infected in vitro with L2-MHV3 for 7 days. The cytopathic effect (syncytia and lysis of monolayer cells) appeared from day 3 PI (data not shown) and a significant increase of mRNA expression of IL-33 was observed at day 4 and day 5 of L2-MHV3 infection. This demonstrated that in vitro L2-MHV3 was sufficient to induce IL-33 expression in hepatocytes (Figure 1(e)).",

The mRNA expression of IL-6 was significantly increased at 48 h and 72 h PI in WT and IL-33 KO mice compared to that in PBS control, while IL-6 expression was significantly upregulated in IL-33 KO mice compared to that in WT mice at only 72 h PI (mean 52 versus 116 AU) (Figure 7(a)). Interestingly, the same profile of IL-6 induction was confirmed at the protein level in the mouse sera (Figure 7(b)). The liver transcriptional expression of classical TH2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13) was not varied in WT and IL-33 KO mice following L2-MHV3 hepatitis compared to that in PBS control mice (Figures 7(c) and 7(d) and data not shown). Regarding TH1 cytokines, IL-2 was not induced in WT or IL-33 KO mice after L2-MHV3 infection at mRNA level in the liver (Figure 7(e)), neither at protein level in mouse sera (data not shown). The mRNA expression of TNF\u03b1 revealed a strong induction during L2-MHV3 infection in WT and IL-33 KO mice, although enhanced expression was found in IL-33 KO mice especially at 48 h PI (Figure 7(f)). A significant induction of IFN\u03b3 was found in WT mice (3.6 and 4.2 at 48 h and 72 h PI), whereas IFN\u03b3 was significantly decreased in IL-33 KO mice (1.4 and 1.9 at 48 h and 72 h PI) compared to that in WT mice at the same time PI (Figure 7(g)). It has to be noted that the basal expression level of IFN\u03b3 was higher in the IL-33 KO mice compared to that in WT mice (2.6-fold) indicating that IL-33 KO mice were TH1 biased. Nonetheless, no induction was observed during MHV3 infection in IL-33 KO background. We then measured the IFN-induced CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 chemokine expressions. The CXCL9 was significantly induced at 48 h PI in WT and IL-33 KO mice at the same level followed by a significant decrease in expression at 72 h PI especially in IL-33 KO mice (Figure 7(h)). The CXCL10 and CXCL11 were significantly induced during L2-MHV3 infection in both WT and IL-33 KO mice with an exacerbated manner especially at 72 h PI in IL-33 KO context (Figures 7(i) and 7(j)). Because these IFN\u03b3-induced chemokines are known to exert their biological activity via interaction with CXCR3 on TH1 CD4+ T cells and CD8+ effector T cells, the expression of CXCR3 was measured which showed a global decrease during L2-MHV3 infection in WT and IL-33 KO mice (Figure 7(j)), in correlation with T lymphocyte depletion as observed previously (Figure 4(d)).",

These could not be explained by higher sensibility of the IL-33 KO mouse strain as the expression of the basic receptors described to be involved in the infectivity such as CEACAM [27], TLR2 [22, 28], and TLR3 [29] receptors were expressed at a comparable level in WT and IL-33 KO mice. A global decrease in liver infiltrate cell number was observed, especially for the immune cell populations of B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, NKT cells, and macrophages in the WT mice but more importantly in the IL-33 KO mice following L2-MHV3 infection. This decreased immune cell infiltration could be explained by direct virus targeting (i.e., for B and T lymphocytes [30] or macrophages [19]) either by the AICD (activation-induced cell death) for NKT cells or by the lack of survival/proliferation signal as shown for NKT cells which can be directly targeted by IL-33 to increase their number [31]. Interestingly, we observed a dramatic decrease in dendritic cell population at 48 h PI only in the IL-33 KO mice while their number remained stable in the WT mice. It is plausible that IL-33 is critical for dendritic cell proliferation as shown in a model of LCMV-induced hepatitis [17].",

            "text": "In contrast, an increase in the number of neutrophils was observed in IL-33 KO mice after L2-MHV3 hepatitis. It was surprising as it has been shown that IL-33 can drive the priming and the migration of neutrophils in different models in vivo [32, 33]. These authors demonstrated that IL-33 could have, indeed, not only a direct effect on neutrophil recruitment but also an indirect effect by creating an in vivo inflammatory microenvironment that promotes neutrophil priming and recruitment. This was related particularly to the induction of TNF\u03b1, CXCL1, and CXCL2 expressions in in situ macrophages, fibroblast-like cells, or vessel endothelial cells. Despite the absence of IL-33 and macrophages, these cytokines were over induced by an alternative mechanism in L2-MHV3-infected IL-33 KO mice, in association with other neutrophil-related chemokines such as CXCL5, CCL2, and CCL6, which could be responsible for massive recruitment of neutrophils as observed at 48 h PI. At 72 h PI, we observed a complete disappearance of neutrophils in the liver whereas an enhanced expression of the neutrophil-related chemokines was measured at RNA level in IL-33 KO mice. The fall in neutrophil number could be explained by the short lifespan of the neutrophils after their activation in vivo [34]. The over induction of CXC chemokines could be due to the absence of a negative feedback mechanism driven by CXCR2 expressed on myeloid cells, involved in the regulation of these chemokines' expression as it has been shown in a model of I/R or in CXCR2 KO mice [35, 36]. The ELR-positive CXC chemokines are the key to the pathophysiology of I/R injury, serving as primary chemoattractants that mediate neutrophil recruitment, resulting in subsequent neutrophil-dependent liver injury. In order to demonstrate the direct deleterious effect of this massive neutrophil recruitment in L2-MHV3-infected IL-33 KO mice, it would be interesting to test in vivo neutrophil depletion in this context.",

            "text": "The transcriptomic profile of 284 genes involved in inflammation, cell signaling, and remodeling showed that the expression of IL-1 family members, IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-18, was not varied between WT and IL-33 KO mice following L2-MHV3 hepatitis. No difference was observed between the two mouse strains in the ability to drive rather a TH1 or TH2 immune response as the classical cytokines to do so (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, or IL-2) were not significantly induced at any time of infection. In the liver, IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 are pleiotropic cytokines having the ability to induce cellular responses such as proliferation, inducing hepatocyte multiplication, and liver regeneration but, on the other hand, mediate inflammatory and acute phase liver cell death responses [37, 38]. Here, we found enhanced expression of these cytokines in IL-33-deficient mice compared to those in WT mice. These findings suggest that the increased liver injury in IL-33 KO mice was related with higher expression of IL-6 and TNF\u03b1. These proinflammatory cytokines were previously described to be induced by MHV3 through TLR2 on macrophages [22]. As the number of liver-infiltrated macrophages was significantly decreased in IL-33 KO mice but in parallel upregulated TLR2 expression was found, it can be explained that the main source of these cytokines might not be macrophages but rather other immune cell population like T lymphocytes or neutrophils. The expression of IFN\u03b3 increased after the L2-MHV3 infection in WT mice, whereas less profound induction was observed in IL-33 KO mice. In concomitance, the direct link between IL-33 and IFN\u03b3 upregulation was demonstrated in vivo in viral liver injury model or in vitro studies [17, 31]. These previous studies pointed that IL-33 induced IFN\u03b3 production not only via iNKT/NK cells but also by \u03b3\u03b4T cells. The absence of IFN\u03b3 induction in IL-33 KO mice could be explained partially by the reduction of these cells in IL-33 KO mice during early infection at 48 h PI and reconstitution of NK or NKT cells at 72 h of PI. The CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 are described to be IFN\u03b3-induced chemokines. Nonetheless, the absence of IFN\u03b3 induction in IL-33 KO and the expressions of CXCL10 and CXCL11 were strongly upregulated during L2-MHV3 infection especially in IL-33 KO background at 72 h PI. We postulate therefore that the induction of these chemokines could be dependent on IFN-\u03b2 in combination with TNF\u03b1 as it has been recently demonstrated in vitro [39]. The CXCL9, as the third member of this family, did not exhibit the same profile expression since it was significantly induced at 48 h PI in WT and IL-33 KO mice by a significant decrease in its expression at 72 h PI in IL-33 KO mice. This suggests that its expression might be more dependent on IFN\u03b3 than CXCL10 and CXCL11. The CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 exert their biological function by binding to their specific receptor CXCR3 present on activated T lymphocytes. The observation of decreased CXCR3 expression combined with the fall of lymphocyte number in the liver during hepatitis may explain that despite their induction in IL-33 KO context, these chemokines would not be able to interact with their target cells.",
