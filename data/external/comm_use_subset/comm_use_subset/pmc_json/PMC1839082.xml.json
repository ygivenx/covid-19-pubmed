Picornaviruses share many replication strategies including cap-independent translation and a single polyprotein open reading frame. However, central to these viruses are the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRP), responsible for replication of both strands of the viral RNA genome and mRNA transcription. The structures of several RdRP have been solved by X-ray crystallography [1-4]. These polymerases retain the \"right-hand\" motif of other polymerases, with finger, thumb and palm domains [5]. However, they differ in having a closed active site: it is fully enclosed due to interactions between the fingers and thumb domains.",

The crystal structures have revealed that phylogenetically conserved motifs can be structurally conserved. For RdRPs, these are A, B, C, D and E (diagrammed in [7]). Except for motif E, which is located between the palm and thumb domains, the motifs are clustered in the palm, as suggested earlier [8]. Mutational and biochemical studies, in concert with structural data, have led to hypotheses about the function of these motifs in polymerase function. The function of motif C is best understood, since it contains an absolutely conserved aspartic acid. This aspartic acid is included in Gly-Asp-Asp, which is conserved in most known RdRPs. The function of the aspartic acids is believed to be coordination of the magnesium metal ions, required for activation of the 3'OH of the primer.",

Although A motifs from the various classes of polymerases differ, the aspartate corresponding to amino acid position 233 in RdRP of poliovirus polymerase (3Dpol) is conserved among the four classes. The homologous residue (D537) in T7 RNA polymerase is essential for polymerase function and coordinates magnesium, required at the active site [9,10]. In HIV reverse transcriptase the homologous residue (D110) is not essential for RNase H activity, but is for RNA-dependent DNA polymerase function [11] and pyrophosphorolysis [12]. In T7 DNA polymerase the homologous residue Asp-705 binds one metal ion in the crystal structure. However, the function of this conserved residue in RdRP remains poorly understood. Functions of some other conserved residues have been delineated. Mutants in position D238 from 3Dpol have a low amount of in vitro polymerase activity and render the virus temperature sensitive. Glutamine 710 in motif A in Klenow DdDP provides part of a steric gating mechanism, preventing rNTPs from binding to the polymerase [13].",

In 3Dpol, these two residues are positioned on the same side of the beta strand, pointing slightly away from the heart of the active site. It is noteworthy that in the poliovirus A motif, there is another aspartic acid, at position 238, which points more directly towards the catalytic aspartic acids, D328 and D329 in motif C. It is possible that D238 participates in the hypothesized magnesium coordination in conjunction with D238 and D239. We cannot eliminate the possibility that this finding is peculiar to replicons and may not apply to virus.
