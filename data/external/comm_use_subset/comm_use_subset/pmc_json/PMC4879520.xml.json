Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated the L, M, and S segments of ROKA13-8 formed a cluster with the HTNV strains in Cheorwon-B. Patient ROKA14-11, assigned to Paju, conducted military training in Paju (Table 1). The Soldier exhibited clinical HFRS symptoms on November 21, 2014, as shown in Table 2. On December 1, the Soldier was confirmed to be positive for HTNV infection by IFA and RT-PCR. Phylogenetically, the L, M, and S segments of ROKA14-11 associated with the HTNV strains from TBTA-S. Patient US8A14-2 exhibited the onset of clinical symptoms on December 17, 2014 and was admitted to the Brian Allgood Army Community Hospital (BAACH) with diarrhea, vomiting, fever, and rapid pulse on December 21. The Soldier was diagnosed for HFRS while referring also myalgia, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, epigastric pain, petechiae on his thigh, splenomegaly, and kidney inflammation. Laboratory diagnosis confirmed that the Soldier was positive for HTNV by IFA and RT-PCR on December 29. According to the medical record, the Soldier was a humvee driver and tactically moved to Rodriguez MPRC range on October 3, DN on November 17\u201320, TBTA on November 22\u201323, Camp Hovey (CH) on November 25\u201330, and Warrior Base (WB) and Story Range (SR) on December 1\u20137. Phylogenetic analysis of US8A14-2 demonstrated the L, M, and S segments formed a cluster with HTNV strains at DN. Clinical symptoms of patient US8A15-1 were observed on May 7, 2015, and the Soldier was admitted to the BAACH with diarrhea, vomiting, fever, and rapid pulse on May 16. The clinical specimen was sent to Korea University on May 21 and laboratory diagnosis, using IFA and RT-PCR, confirmed HTNV infection on May 22. The L and M segments of US8A15-1 formed a cluster with HTNV stains in Pocheon. However, phylogenetic analysis of the HTNV S segment from US8A15-1 demonstrated the genetic cluster with HTNV strains in Hwacheon, suggesting a recombination of HTNV S segment genome in nature.",

P-value of the analyses was from 5.803E-5 to 7.013E-11 and the RDP recombination consensus score (RDPRCS) of US8A15-1, approximately 0.659, was relatively high when compared to HTNV strains in Pocheon (RDPRCS = 0.011) and Hwacheon (RDPRCS = 0.330). These results indicated that UA8A15-1 may be a recombinant due to the exchange of partial S segment in nature.",

This analysis provided mechanisms to identify the location where the soldiers most likely acquired HTNV infections and under what conditions. The analysis of 354 bp-partial sequence of HTNV M segment between HFRS patients and rodent hosts may be insufficient to better define the phylogeographic link for future cases because of the low resolution. A recent study demonstrated that whole genome sequencing of Lassa virus enhanced the resolution of phylogenetic analysis for the molecular diversity and genomic characteristic compared to the partial sequences21. The extension of HTNV tripartite genomic sequences was limited because of the lack of NGS technology and ultra-low copy of viral RNA in clinical samples. Notably, whole genome sequences of HTNV was obtained from HFRS patient sera by multiplex PCR-based NGS using the primer set specific for HTNV L, M, and S segments. This attempt yielded enhanced levels of viral reads throughout the NGS, demonstrating the complete open reading frame genomic sequences of HTNV S and M segments. The multiplex PCR-based NGS is robust and efficient for acquiring the whole genome sequence of HTNV from HFRS patients as well as wild rodent hosts.",

Compared with the genomic HTNV sequences of patients and the rodent hosts, the site where HFRS patients acquired HTNV infection was suggested by the phylogeographic analyses (Fig. 4). ROKA13-8 and ROKA14-11 (Korean army HFRS patients) formed a cluster with HTNV strains from Cheorwon-B and TBTA-S, respectively. Patient ROKA13-8 was assigned to Hwacheon, but conducted military training in Cheorwon. ROKA13-8 was phylogenetically associated with HTNV strains in Cheorwon-B suggesting the Soldier was most likely infected with HTNV during the training in Cheorwon. This result also suggested that patient ROKA14-11 conducted military activity and was the most likely infected with HTNV near TBTA-S in Paju. Phylogenetic analysis of US Army HFRS patient US8A14-2 showed a close relationship with HTNV strains from DN in Paju. This result and clinical records suggested the Soldier was the most likely infected with HTNV at DN between November 17 and 20, fell within the normal incubation period of HTNV. The US Army HFRS patient US8A15-1 conducted military training at MPRC, Pocheon. The phylogenetic association of US8A15-1 with HTNV strains in Pocheon identified the most likely site infection. The phylogenetic and geographic analyses of HTNV whole genome sequences from the patients and natural reservoirs provide an epidemiological diagnostic and surveillance system for annual endemic HTNV infections, identifying the most likely site of infection and under what conditions the infection was acquired. These data contribute to the development of disease risk analyses and preventive measures by changing the environment that reduces rodent habitat and training site avoidance during periods of highest risk22.",

The genetic event of bunyaviruses was observed in nature and in vitro2425. The frequency of the recombination of hantavirus tripartite genomes may be associated with the function of proteins encoded on the L, M, and S segments. Diverse recombinants generated by the exchange of different genetic information could be present. For instance, Seoul virus, Andes virus, Tula virus, and Pummala virus generated the S segment recombinants, whereas the M segment recombination was observed in HTNV, China26. In this study, the phylogenetic tree demonstrated L and M segments of US8A15-1 formed clusters with HTNV in Pocheon but the partial sequence of S segment of the HTNV was closely associated to that of HTNV in Hwacheon. This observation suggests that US8A15-1 appears to be an S segment recombination of HTNV with 0.659 of RDPRCS and P-value < 0.05. In addition, the exchange of genetic components may be a critical factor in the pathogenicity of the viral infections27. Given our limited knowledge of genetic events in nature, whether the S segment recombination is a virulence determinant of hantavirus-associated diseases remains to be investigated.",
