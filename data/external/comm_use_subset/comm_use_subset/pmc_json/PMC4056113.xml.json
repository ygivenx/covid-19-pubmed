More importantly, patients with H7N9 virus\u2013mediated influenza have a high mortality rate [2]. Previous studies have revealed the clinical characteristics [1], epidemiology [3-5] and virology [6,7], laboratory diagnosis, and treatment of patients with H7N9 virus infection [8,9]. However, little is known about the impact of H7N9 virus infection on the immune system.",

Individual patients with H7N9 were diagnosed on the basis of clinical symptoms and laboratory-confirmed H7N9 virus infection. Patients with ARDS were diagnosed according to standard criteria [10]. Thirty age- and gender-matched HCs were recruited at the Physical Examination Center of the hospital during the same period. The mean age of the HCs was 57 \u00b1 12 years, and 56.7% of them were male (17 participants). The exclusion criteria were (1) coinfection with hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or HIV; (2) the presence of a common autoimmune disease and tumor; and/or (3) a recent history of chemotherapy, radiotherapy or use of immunosuppressants. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant. The experimental protocol was established in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Ethics Committee of The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine. The patients\u2019 demographic and clinical characteristics are shown in Table 1.",

We found that 70% of patients had at least two concurrent SIRS components and detected significantly higher levels of serum IL-6 and IL-8 in the patients than in HCs, which may explain the high morbidity and mortality associated with this disease. However, we did not detect significant alterations in the levels of serum IFN-\u03b3 or TNF-\u03b1 in these patients. This cytokine profile is analogous to that of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [16,17]. Furthermore, it has been reported that patients with either H7N9 virus influenza or SARS coronavirus-related illness shared striking similarities with regard to their clinical presentation and disease progression. Therefore, it is possible that the pathogenesis of H7N9 virus infection is similar to that of SARS coronavirus-related infection [18]. Although patients with severe influenza induced by the H1N1 and H5N1 viruses develop a \u201ccytokine storm,\u201d including high levels of serum IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1, which are commonly associated with rapid progression and poor prognosis [11,19,20], we did not detect abnormal levels of serum IFN-\u03b3 or TNF-\u03b1 in patients with H7N9 virus infection. These findings suggest that different immune responses may occur in patients with varying types of influenza virus infection. The investigators in one recent study reported that a high frequency of programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1), and its ligand 1 (PD-L1), that expressed T cells impaired T-cell responses to H1N1 infection in patients with influenza [21]. It is possible that similar mechanisms may underlie the failure to detect abnormal levels of serum IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 in patients with H7N9 virus infection. Although proinflammatory IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 responses usually occur at early stages of immune responses, it is also possible that the failure to detect abnormal levels of serum IFN-\u03b3 or TNF-\u03b1 may stem from missing the very early time point in our study. Therefore, further studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of H7N9 virus infection and host immune responses.",

The lymphocytopenia in patients with H7N9 avian influenza may be a key factor leading to high morbidity and mortality, because lymphocytopenia is an independent risk factor for ARDS, which is a very dangerous condition for patients with secondary infections [1]. The lymphocytopenia in these patients likely derives from the migration of T lymphocytes into the target tissues, such as the lungs. Alternatively, the lymphocytopenia may stem from virus-stimulated, activation-induced T-cell apoptosis and virus infection\u2013related bone marrow suppression [23].",

In this study, we found significantly higher frequencies of CD38 + CD4+, CD38 + CD8+, Tim-3 + CD4+ and Tim-3 + CD8+ T cells in patients with H7N9 avian influenza compared with those in the HCs. It is well-known that CD38 and Tim-3 expression are associated with T-cell activation [13]. The higher frequency of CD38+ and Tim-3+ T cells in patients with H7N9 avian influenza indicated that viral infection induced significant T-cell activation. However, Tim-3 on activated T cells usually provides a negative signal for effector T-cell function and leads to T-cell functional exhaustion [13,24,25]. Furthermore, engagement of Tim-3 by its specific ligand of galectin-9 can trigger T-cell apoptosis [26]. Notably, IFN-\u03b3 is a potent inducer of galectin-9 protein expression, thus the low IFN-\u03b3 expression in patients with severe H7N9 influenza may limit the production of galectin-9, leading to a high frequency of impotent Tim-3+ T cells. Thus, in turn, aberration of T-cell activation in patients with H7N9 avian influenza may render T-cell exhaustion and apoptosis or impotence, leading to poor immune responses. We are interested in further investigating the levels of galectin-9 and T-cell function to discern the precise mechanisms underlying immune responses to H7N9 virus infection in humans.",

In these clinical settings, downregulation of HLA-DR expression usually represents the functional impairment of monocytes and is associated with adverse outcomes. In addition, the reduced levels of Tim-3 expression on monocytes may contribute to the functional deactivation of monocytes, as it was reported previously that constitutive Tim-3 expression in na\u00efve and resting immunocompetent cells promotes inflammation [32].",
