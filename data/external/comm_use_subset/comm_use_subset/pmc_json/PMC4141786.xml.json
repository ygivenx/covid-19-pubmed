            "text": "Kawasaki disease (KD) is a systemic vasculitis which was first reported by Dr. Kawasaki in 1974 in English from Japan [1]. It mainly affects children less than 5-years-old world widely, especially in Asia. Japan, Korea and Taiwan have the highest incidence of KD worldwide from 66-234/100,000 children less than 5 years old [2], [3], [4]. The clinical characteristics and diagnosis criteria of KD include a prolonged fever (more than 5 days), bilateral non-purulent conjunctivitis, diffuse mucosal inflammation of oral cavity with strawberry tongue and fissure lips, polymorphous skin rashes over body surface, indurative angioedema of the hands and feet followed by desquamation in the sub-acute stage, and lymphadenopathy over neck [3], [5]. Fever for more than 5 days with 4 of the 5 diagnostic criteria matches the diagnosis of KD [6]. The most common sequel of KD is coronary artery lesions (CAL) formation [7], [8]. KD has become the most common cause of acquired heart disease in children of developed countries. The cause of KD is still unclear. Both genetic and environmental factors are considered to be important factors of KD. High dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) with aspirin is considered to be an effective treatment for KD [8]. The pharmacological mechanism of IVIG also remains unclear. The potential mechanisms of IVIG action include modulation of cytokine production, suppression of antibody synthesis and immune regulation [8]. IVIG therapy itself has greatly decreased the rate of aneurysms; however, some patients are unresponsive to the initial IVIG treatment. The incidence rate of IVIG resistance varies from 9.4\u201323% between countries [6].",

            "text": "IVIG is used to treat a wide range of autoimmune or immune related diseases. The immunosuppressive effects of IVIG are, in part, attributed to terminal \u03b12,6-linked sialic acid residues on the N-linked glycans of the IgG Fc (fragment crystallizable) domain. \u03b12,6-linked sialylated IgG was reported to interact with dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3 grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN, CD209), and trigger an anti-inflammatory cascade that promotes the up regulation of inhibitory Fc\u03b3Rs on macrophages [9]. CD209 is a dendritic cell (DC)-specific C-type lectin superfamily receptor that has functions of pattern recognition receptor in the innate response to infection, DC migration, and the initial steps of T cell activation [10]. Several lines of evidence indicated the association between CD209 and infectious diseases, such as dengue fever, tuberculosis and AIDS [11], [12], [13], [14]. Thus, CD209 may be important in the anti-inflammatory functions of IVIG. Yu et al. showed CD209 (rs4804803) promoter variants have effects on susceptibility to KD, but not IVIG treatment response (15). Portman et al. revealed that Asians with the major allele \u201cA\u201d in rs2287886 of CD209 were more likely to be IVIG non-responders, but this allele is a minor allele in Hispanic and Caucasian ethnic groups [15], [16]. In this study, we hypothesized that CD209 may be involved in the susceptibility to KD, CAL formation and IVIG treatment response in KD patients.",

Of the 381 KD patients, 126 (33.1%) patients had coronary artery lesion (CAL), and 49 (12.9%) patients suffered from persistent fever after they treated with IVIG. As shown in Table 2, Three SNPs (rs4804800, rs2287886, and rs735240) of CD209 showed significance with regards to susceptibility of KD. The GG genotype of SNP rs4804800 had 1.60-fold increased risk compared with AG and AA genotypes of KD (P = 0.0336, OR (95% CI)  = 1.60 (1.04\u20132.46)). The variants of rs2287886 and rs735240 revealed protective effects, the GG genotype of rs2287886 and AA genotype of rs735240 were associated with a lower risk of KD (Table 2). However, all significances disappeared if we performed Bonfferoni correction (P<0.0055).",

The treatment effects of IVIG resulted from the terminal \u03b12,6-linked sialic acid residues of the IgG Fc (fragment crystallizable) domain, which were known to be conjugated to the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of the cell-surface lectin. Through this interaction, DC-SIGN and its murine orthologue SIGN-R1 (specific intracellular adhesion molecule-grabbing non-integrin R1) triggered down-stream expression of immunosuppressive cytokines and receptors. Consistent with this model, the anti-inflammatory effect of IVIG treatment is abolished in a murine knock-out of SIGN-R1 and can be restored by a knock-in with human CD209\n[24].",
