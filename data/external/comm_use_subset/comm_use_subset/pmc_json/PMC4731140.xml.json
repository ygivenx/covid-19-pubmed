However, some agents did not qualify as causal aetiologies (e.g. pneumococci by NPH-qPCR), and 15% of the patients could not be assigned a final diagnosis. The results, with multiple pathogens being detected in a large proportion of specimens from both patients and controls, underline the complexity of childhood infections. Also, many pathogens were detected in similar frequencies in patients and controls, as previously observed [7,8], emphasizing the need to incorporate controls in studies on causes of fever.",

Similar approaches for aetiology identification have previously been used for gastrointestinal [7,15] as well as nasopharyngeal pathogens [8,16]. Overall, the NPH-qPCR results cohered with previous studies of acute respiratory tract infections in African preschool children [17,18].

            "text": "A strength of our study is that, based on all clinical and microbiology data, we retrospectively assigned individual final patient diagnoses, which allowed assessment of whether antibiotics were prescribed to those presumed to benefit from treatment. IMCI management has previously been shown to reduce inappropriate antibiotic prescription in comparison with standard fever case management [19] and a majority of the antibiotic-requiring infections in our study were indeed treated with antibiotics. Still, IMCI management resulted in substantial over-prescription of antibiotics in comparison with the final fever diagnoses retrieved based on all available clinical and laboratory data and their corresponding antibiotic requirement. Thus, among the 57% patients fulfilling the IMCI-pneumonia classification, only 12% had CXR-confirmed pneumonia. Similar results have been reported by others in both hospitalized children [20,21], and in non-severe IMCI-pneumonias [22], indicating that IMCI-pneumonia classification, based on presence of cough and rapid breathing has a low precision to identify lower antibiotic requiring respiratory tract infections. IMCI-pneumonia classification was the largest contributor to presumed unnecessary antibiotic prescription in our study. In a multiple logistic regression analysis, CRP was the only positive predictor of CXR-confirmed pneumonia. However, approximately 50% with CXR-confirmed pneumonia in our study had CRP <80 mg/L and a viral pathogen detected by NPH-qPCR, suggesting that some of the CXR-confirmed pneumonias might only have been of viral origin [23]. The IMCI guidelines have remained quite similar since its introduction, with the exception of the recent integration of malaria RDT, which has been proven useful in Zanzibar [10]. If IMCI in combination with CRP and/or other biomarkers could play a similar role by reliably confirming or excluding bacterial infections like pneumonia needs to be further studied [5]. When planning such studies on infections requiring antibiotics, the following issues should be addressed: Should severely and/or non-severely ill patients be included? How and when should the illnesses be identified (e.g point-of-care versus molecular based diagnostic techniques)? The likelihood of finding a single laboratory test/biomarker in the near future that could distinguish all infections presumed to require antibiotics from other infections is low. For instance, Fig 7B shows that GAS-infections and Shigellosis were the main infections requiring antibiotics that the IMCI algorithm did not identify. Hence, the way forward would probably be a more complex step-wise approach combining clinical signs, multiple biomarkers and point of care detection of pathogens.",
