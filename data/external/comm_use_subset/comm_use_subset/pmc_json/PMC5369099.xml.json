These viruses occur naturally among wild aquatic birds worldwide and can infect over 100 domestic sources of poultry as well as other birds and animal species [2,3,4,5,6,7]. Avian influenza viruses do not normally infect humans, but human infections may occur after contact with infected birds or their secretions or excretions, or through limited human-to-human transmission [8,9,10,11,12]. Given the significant global improvements in laboratory characterization and surveillance, additional novel avian viruses are likely to be identified. Following the appearance of the H5N1virus in 1997, ongoing surveillance efforts have already improved not only the detection of the H7N9 (in 2013), H10N8 (in 2013) and H5N6 subtypes (in 2014), which have all caused severe infections, but also the detection of other subtypes such as H6N1, H7N2, H7N3, H7N7, H9N2 and H10N7, which have resulted in mild infections in a limited number of humans [1,13,14].",

On the basis of the molecular characteristics of the viruses and their ability to result in disease and mortality in chickens in a laboratory setting, avian influenza A viruses have been classified into the following two categories: low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) A viruses and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI A viruses [15]. The majority of those isolated have been LPAI A viruses, although HPAI A viruses have occasionally been detected. Notably, the case fatality rate (CFR) among human cases of avian influenza has ranged from 36%\u201360% overall, which is alarmingly high compared with all previous outbreaks of human cases of seasonal influenza in the United States, for which the CFR has ranged from 0.04%\u20131.0% [1,16,17]. This high level of illness severity and high mortality rate was unexpected and increased disease burden, resulting in concern among clinicians and public health officials; however, the risk factors that are most highly associated with the deaths from avian influenza were not clear.",

The final H5N1 CFR may be reasonably estimated, because asymptomatic or mild human influenza A (H5N1) virus infection is rare [29]. In contrast, the H7N9 CFR might be overestimated, because a large number of mild cases in younger people are likely to go undetected [30,31]. Similarly, the final CFR for children in the H5N1 group was significantly greater than in the H7N9 group in the present study. Several studies have reported that 22 mild pediatric cases of infection with H7N9 viruses have been identified through the sentinel surveillance of influenza-like-illness and have had good outcomes [32,33]. Contributing to these findings was the fact that the majority of the children were secondary cases under medical investigation, which led to earlier confirmation and anti-viral drug treatment [34]. In general, CFR variation in different subtypes and different populations has been influenced by host features such as age, exposure history, medical-seeking behavior and underlying diseases [35,36].",

The visited LBMs variable was much higher in the H7N9 fatality group than in the H5N1 fatality group. In contrast, the proportions of the exposure to sick and dead birds and backyard birds in H5N1 fatalities were much higher than the H7N9 fatality groups. These data suggest that contamination of LBMs and bird-to-bird transmission of H7N9 in these markets may be the primary initial mechanisms for increasing the transmission of the virus [39]. In contrast, H5N1 circulates in wild birds and infects poultry in backyards and small farms, as well as sick and dead birds [1,29]. These findings indicate that live and backyard birds are an ongoing source of exposure for birds and humans and represent a group in which HPAI and LPAI control could be implemented [1].",

This is consistent with other retrospective studies of avian influenza A virus infections [40]. In particular, the period from onset to antiviral treatment in the children who died was also much longer than in those who survived, indicating that delayed oseltamivir treatment was a high-risk factor for H5N1, which is in accordance with previous reports on influenza viruses [41,42].

Similar to other research, the secondary deaths occurring in the H5N1 virus case clusters were markedly less severe than the index fatalities. There were several reasons for an important case ascertainment bias. On one hand, the secondary cases were detected, and the antiviral treatment began early through the healthcare surveillance system, and on the other, the index cases were biased toward older people with a higher number of underlying diseases [46]. In addition, the index cases generally had significantly higher levels of exposure to poultry, while the secondary cases subsequently became infected after providing care for the ill index patients or after spending prolonged periods of time with them.
