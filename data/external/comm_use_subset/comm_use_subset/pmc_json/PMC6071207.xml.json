            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a highly contagious swine disease characterized by acute watery diarrhea and vomiting in piglets [1]. The PED was first identified in the 1970s in Europe and subsequently became an endemic disease with sporadic outbreaks in Asia and Europe [2,3]. Since late 2010, the highly virulent porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has emerged and has attacked neonatal piglets in China [4]. In 2013, outbreaks of highly virulent PED were reported in North America and East Asia [5,6], including in Taiwan [7], resulting in dramatic economic losses in swine industries. A lot of effort has been made to develop vaccines for controlling the epidemic of PED [6,8,9,10]. However, no effective commercialized vaccine is available for controlling PED worldwide. A valid, safe, and cost-effective vaccine for controlling PEDVs is therefore urgently needed. Additionally, the phylogenic analysis of new Taiwan PEDV strains showed high sequence identities with other G2b PEDVs in other countries [7]. Therefore, development of the Taiwan G2b PEDV-based vaccines would be very helpful for controlling and reducing the disease burden.",

            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus belongs to family Coronaviridae, subfamily Coronavirinae and genus Alphacoronavirus [1]. The virus has a single, 28 kb, positive strain RNA genome encoding seven open reading frames (ORF): the ORF1a and ORF1b genes encode the replicase; the ORF3 gene encodes the accessory protein; the ORF2, ORF4, ORF5, and ORF6 genes encode four structural proteins, namely spike (S), envelope (E), nucleocapsid (N), and membrane (M) protein [11]. Among the structure proteins, the S protein, which is responsible for virus-host recognition, virus internalization, and neutralizing antibody induction, is the principle antigenic determinant [1]. The naturally assembled S protein forms a homotrimeric structure with several predicted glycosylation sites [12]. This glycoprotein can further be divided into S1 and S2 domains by specific cleavage site [13]. The S1 domain contributes to receptor recognition, enteropathogenicity, and immunogenicity, as it contains the dominant neutralizing epitopes, thus being the main target for vaccine development [14,15]. Linking with the S1, the S2 domain anchors on the viral membrane and triggers membrane fusion [16]. Several neutralizing epitopes on the S protein of PEDV have been described, including the CO-26K-equivalent epitope (COE epitope) [15], the antigen epitope motif recognized by monoclonal antibody 2C10 at C terminal end of S protein [17,18], and the S1D domain [19]. Therefore, S protein is considered a major target for PEDV vaccine development [9,20].",

            "text": "The baculovirus expressing system has long been utilized for different biological purposes, for instance, recombinant protein production [21], vaccine manufacturing, and gene therapy [22,23]. Among various strains, Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) is the most popular strain for laboratory applications. The high protein productivity, large capacity and flexibility to accommodate long insertions [24], high biosafety for vertebrates, and delicate post-translation modifications are the advantages of the baculovirus expressing system [25]. Furthermore, as a vaccine candidate, the viral particle of baculovirus is able to evoke robust innate immune responses by regulating cytokines [26], as well as serving an adjuvant role in promoting B cell and T cell activation to improve the humoral immune responses [27]. Baculovirus is a very stable DNA virus, which can be stored at 4 \u00b0C for up to 4 years without significant change in virus titers [28]. Also, this virus is easy to propagate, with high titers around 108\u2013109 TCID50/mL. Recently, baculovirus-expressing viral surface proteins has become a novel strategy for recreating complex protein folding and functional properties [29,30]. Given that baculovirus is able to mount a robust immune response [26,31], the baculovirus displaying a heterologous protein on its surface could be a novel tool for the development of new generation of vaccines. In this context, several immunogens have been generated using the baculovirus display strategy and proven to be able to induce strong humoral immunity and protection against infectious diseases [32,33,34].",

This approach is generally achieved by cooperating the protein of interest with the baculoviral envelope glycoprotein, GP64, for anchoring the protein on the membrane of the budded virions [45]. Different surface displaying strategies, such as changing signal peptide, transmembrane domain (TM) or cytoplasmic tail domain (CTD) of GP64 in attempt to present large, complex foreign proteins as well as simple peptides are available [29,46]. In the present study, using the traditional chimeric GP64 display strategy, which consists of PEDV S1 domain fused with the TM and CTD of GP64, the S1-Bac has been successfully generated. Importantly, the S-Bac displaying the full-length of PEDV S protein without being fused to GP64 TM and CTD has also been successfully generated and confirmed. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence showing the full-length S protein of coronavirus could be successfully displayed on the surface of the baculovirus by utilizing PEDV-S original TM and CTD. Our study provides the rational basis of using baculovirus to display the full-length S protein of coronavirus. This approach is a novel tool for developing vaccines against other coronaviruses for better antigen delivery, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).",

            "text": "Currently, two conditionally licensed PED vaccines, the alphavirus-based vaccine (Harrisvacccines, Inc., Ames, Iowa, USA) and an inactivated vaccine (Zoetis, Inc., Parsippany ,New Jersey, USA) targeting the highly virulent G2b PEDV are available in the United States. However, they are not available in other countries. The former vaccine is a PEDV RNA vaccine, and previous results showed that application of the vaccine could only reduce mortality of piglets by 3% [8]. The second one used killed PEDV viruses, and a low viral yield with a titer of 6.6 log10 TCID50/mL is limiting the broad application of the vaccine [8]. Recently, several studies using full-length ectodomain trimeric S protein [40] or different truncated S proteins derived from different G2b PEDVs were combined with commercial adjuvants as subunit vaccine regimens. Despite that these subunit vaccines were able to induce robust systemic IgG and neutralizing antibody against PEDVs, they fail to completely prevent clinical symptoms and fecal viral shedding [47,48,49]. In the present study, piglets vaccinated with S-Bac can be elicited higher neutralizing antibody titers and good protective efficacy over the S1-Bac vaccinated pigs, despite both of them promoting robust levels of systemic PEDV S-specific IgG in pigs and mice. The remarkable differences of protective efficacy between S1-Bac and S-Bac vaccinations suggest the importance of the integrity of the S protein in inducing neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity. The S protein of PEDV is the most important viral protein for establishing infection and eliciting neutralizing antibodies in hosts. The S1 domain is majorly responsible for virus-host recognition and interaction, and the S2 participates in membrane fusion and virus internalization [17,50]. Several PEDV neutralizing epitopes in S1 domain have been reported, such as the domain 0, domain B [14], and the CO-26K equivalent epitopes (COE) [15]. On the other hand, the S1D epitope, covering the C-terminus of the S1 region, the S1/S2 junction, and the N-terminus of the S2 region, is also verified as an effective neutralizing epitope of PEDV [19]. However, there are also some other neutralizing epitopes of PEDV identified in S2 and the CTD of S protein, such as the 2C10 epitope at the C-terminal site [18] and several linear epitopes at the N-terminal site of the S2 region near the SS2 and SS6 epitopes [51]. Our results of superior immune-protectivity of the S-Bac over the S1-Bac vaccination indicate that the baculovirus display S protein comprising both S1 and S2 regions is crucial for generating protective immunity against PEDVs.",

            "text": "It has been well-demonstrated that baculovirus itself can serve as a strong B and T cell adjuvant for protein antigens [27,52]. Further, the viral particle of baculovirus is able to evoke robust innate immune responses by regulating cytokines such as interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) [26], which may take place in blocking the viral infection. In our study, we demonstrated that both S-Bac and S1-Bac immunizations without any adjuvant could evoke PEDV S-specific systemic immune response, ease the clinical symptoms, and decrease the viral shedding to a certain extent. Although S-Bac immunization elicits robust systemic immunity and almost completely protects piglets against PEDV-PT-P6&7 challenge, there is still one in five piglets exhibiting mild symptoms and delayed low level of viral shedding. Concerning the detectable but low level of fecal IgA in both S-Bac and S1-Bac immunized piglets, new regimens to induce mucosal immunity are critical for PEDV vaccine development [53,54]. For instance, introducing the specific adjuvants, such as LTB and CTB (cholera toxin B), along with baculovirus displayed antigens to propel the mucosal and cellular immunity [34,55]. For further experimental design of an intramuscularly injectable vaccine, the utilization of adjuvants which are capable of either boosting immunity or elevating common mucosal immunity should be considered.",
