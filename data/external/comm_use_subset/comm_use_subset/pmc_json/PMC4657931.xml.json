            "text": "Since the emergence of HIV/AIDS, modelling its dynamics has been dealt with extensively by many researchers. The basic approach is to describe the population in terms of three states: those who have not contracted HIV, susceptible, those who have HIV and remain sexually active, infectious and those individuals who are no longer engaged in spreading the disease, removed. This style of SIR model has been widely used to capture the dynamics of diseases, by for example [1\u20135] and in many other articles. For HIV, the SIR model is also applied, but with the assumption that infected individuals do not recover from the disease but rather stop being infectious [6\u201310]. SIR models consider the dynamics of diseases to depend only on the individual status like susceptible, infected or removed.",

            "text": "Under the standard SIR model, the transmission rates, infection periods, contact patterns and removed rates do not account for the spatial spread of the diseases. In this standard version, they ignore variations in demographic, social, cultural, economic and geographic factors [4, 11]. In reality, however, the spread of HIV is highly associated with geographic factors, such as population mobility, as well as the accessibility of and the proximity between infected areas [12]. Human mobility can be seasonal, short term and long term [13, 14]. Several studies have shown that migrant workers in urban areas can spread HIV to rural areas [15, 16]. For example, in South Africa, men who had moved away from a rural area to an urban area were twice as likely to have HIV than those still living in the rural area [12]. These migrant workers would regularly return to the rural area, potentially spreading the virus. Likewise, areas associated with high human mobility such as commercial farms and agricultural estates, mining areas, business centres and residential areas along busy roads have been connected to an increase in HIV infections [17\u201321]. Not all migrations appear to increase HIV transmission, and other studies have reported that the rural-urban migrations have little or no link to HIV risk [22, 23]. Overall, however, it appears that short-term human mobility, for example return visits from work to home town, are associated with high-risk behaviour. The migration to urban areas leads to an increased chance of interacting with individuals who are at higher-risk of being HIV infected, like sex workers [13, 14, 24]. Return visits to a home town then provide further spread of the disease.",

In metapopulation models, the area under study is divided into different regions according to geographic positions. The distinct regions could be cities, towns or villages. The regions are connected by people travelling between them. Various studies have incorporated metapopulations in disease dynamics [25\u201330]. For example, Sattenspiel and Dietz [31], used a metapopulation model to show that increase in human mobility was associated with an increase of the spread of measles in the West Indian island of Dominica. Travel networks have very complex influence on disease dynamics, since they may fuel or may help disease extinction [29]. For example, Arino et al [32] used a two-region metapopulation model to study the influence of travel rates with respect to the stability of influenza. They observed that, for isolated regions, the disease in one of the regions approached the disease-free equilibrium while in the other region it approached the endemic. Introducing very small movements between the regions, the disease in all regions approached the endemic state. On increasing the movements rates, influenza died out in all the regions.",

In one example, Coffee et al [13] looked at the impact of migration on the HIV epidemic in South Africa. They reported that, migrations when coupled to increased risk behaviour, have a causal effect on the increase of HIV. In a modelling study, Smith? et al [33] reported that, in order to globally eradicate HIV/AIDS, the money spent and other resources must aim at eradicating HIV/AIDS in all regions, since human mobility has an effect of sustaining the infections. However, the extent to which human mobility impacts the transmission of HIV infections still needs to be studied further. For example, one counterintuitive finding by Xiao et al [34], is that an increase in mobility rates among HIV/AIDS-infected individuals on mainland China decreased HIV infections in the country. Once again, it appears that there is a need to develop metapopulation models that are well-designed in order to clearly explain the impact of human mobility.",

We thus introduce the removed class, which incorporates individuals who are in AIDS status and are no longer transmitting the disease. The model is parametrised using demographic data from Kenya at the time of the 2009 census [36] and the world bank data [37]. The rates of moving between regions is estimated from mobile phone data collected by Wesolowski et al [38]. Infection rate is estimated from Kenya HIV data KAIS 2007 [39] and the disease progression rate is adopted from the work of Baryama et al [9].

The adult population in region i is divided into susceptible S\ni, Infectious I\ni and Removed R\ni, so that the total adult population in the region i is N\ni = S\ni + I\ni + R\ni. The exposed period from time of HIV infection to a stage when infected individual becomes infectious is very short, so that when an individual acquires infections, immediately becomes infectious [40\u201343]. For this reason, we use the SIR model. The dynamics of each sub-population includes only individuals aged 15\u201364 years only, because this is the group of individuals who are sexually active, hence susceptible to HIV infections.",

This contribution is even smaller if the disease decreases overall in the population. These results contrast with some other studies that report a positive correlations between mobility and the HIV prevalence [19, 54]. For example, a study of east and south Africa long-distance truck drivers found that mobility is the main contributing factor to the HIV transmission [55\u201358]. When a disease first spreads, we also expect mobility to play an important role. For example, air-transportation networks have been responsible for the global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [59], and, because of the higher mobility in Europe, pandemic influenza could diffuse rapidly [60]. In our study, in which HIV is already endemic, overall mobility appears to make only a small difference to the total spread of the disease in Kenya.",

Specifically, regions with initially low HIV prevalences experience an increase in the number of infectious individuals when mobility is accounted for, while regions with initially high HIV prevalences experience a slight decrease. Even when the overall trend is for the disease to decrease (i.e R\nB < 1) human mobility tends to delay eradication in low prevalence regions, and slightly speed up the eradication process in regions with high HIV prevalences. When the disease is in an endemic state, regions with initially low HIV prevalences tend to increase their HIV incidence rates more than the regions with initially high HIV prevalences. Here our results seem to be in agreement with other studies, which report that migrant workers in urban areas can spread HIV to rural areas on their trips back to their areas of origin [12, 15, 16]. For example, if we compare big cities, like Nairobi, and small cities, like Kirinyanga, mobility tends to slightly decrease the number of infectious individuals in the former and slightly increase infections in the latter. Infectious individuals travel from the most infected, typically urban areas, and infect susceptibles in the least infected, rural areas.",

For example, in Nairobi, initially infections grow faster than other regions, irrespective of mobility (Fig 6). When R\nB < 1, Nairobi converges very slowly to the disease-free equilibrium point compared to other regions (Fig 4). This can be attributed to the fact that Nairobi is the most populated region in the country and highly connected to other regions (Fig 3b). This result concurs with other studies, which associates high HIV infections with high human mobility in areas such as commercial farms and agricultural estates, mining areas, business centres and residential areas along busy roads [17\u201321]. It seems that more infectious individuals move from the most infected areas like Homa Bay, Siaya, Kisumu and other regions to Nairobi.",

Potentially, if migrants could travel with their partners to urban areas [14], then this would reduce the growth of the disease in rural areas. Proper education aimed at promoting behaviour changes and avoiding risk behaviours is crucial [61, 62].",

First, we did not account for state-dependent movements, where l\nij differs for infectious and susceptibles. For example, there is stigmatization and discrimination of people living with HIV, so infected individuals tend to move away or hide their HIV status after being diagnosed [63, 64]. Secondly, we did not consider intervention in our model, through education strategies for example, which could lead to behaviour changes of susceptible and infectious individuals. Similarly, we do not model precautions taken by individuals who might avoid having sexual relationships with people coming from the highly infected areas [61, 62]. Including preventative measures would reduce the susceptible populations and hence decrease new infections. Finally, we treat those individuals who travel as being no more likely to engage in risky sexual behaviour than other people in the regions they live. Given that many of the visits from urban to rural areas are made by people who might exhibit more risky behaviour when living alone in the city [13, 14, 24], our original assumptions may not be justified.",
