Syndromic surveillance is defined as \"an investigational approach where health department staff, assisted by automated data acquisition and generation of statistical alerts, monitor disease indicators in real-time or near real-time to detect outbreaks of disease earlier than would otherwise be possible with traditional public health methods\"[1]. To achieve this goal, the places to observe and the databases to analyze must meet certain prerequisites: observations must be made where patients first seek immediate care, i.e., at general practitioners (GPs), hospital emergency departments (HED) or pharmacies. Data must be accessible in real time and collected on a routine basis. Good examples of such data are over-the-counter drug sales, visits to emergency care units, which, in most hospitals, are recorded in real time, or consultations with GPs in private practice, when a system of real-time data collection is available, as is the case for the French Sentinel Network [2,3].",

This distinction is particularly relevant in the context of outbreak detection: supervised methods are used when the pattern to recognize has been defined previously, e.g., the detection of seasonal influenza outbreaks. In this situation, data collection must rely on a well-defined set of symptoms. Then, a statistical algorithm is used to qualify when an excess of observed cases indicates an outbreak. Numerous statistical techniques belonging to this class of supervised methods are routinely used in surveillance (e.g., periodic regression models, which are now available on the Web [5]), as long as the patterns to recognize have been defined a priori. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defined 11 classes of syndromes associated with bioterrorism [6], and several syndromic surveillance algorithms were devised to optimally assign each new case to one of those classes [2,7-17].",

Second, the different ICPC-2 headings are arranged vertically in successive rectangles representing a particular system, in which the codes are organized in rows corresponding to tumor pathologies, degenerative pathologies, traumas, inflammatory and infectious pathologies, pathologies specific to the system. Third, individual ICPC-2 codes are placed horizontally. The codes the easiest to recognize, because they are the most serious or because they correspond to well-defined nosological entities, are placed closest to the medial vertical line. For example, the code R06, epistaxis, is adjacent to the medial line while the code R09, sinus symptom, has a more distant position.

This example also shows that standard methods of image analysis (such as subtraction of images, smoothing, etc) can be used in the present application. We examined the ICPCviews corresponding, as above, to: the week just before the outbreak (week 3/2006), the week at the outbreak peak (week 6/2006), the week after the outbreak (week 14/2006), and the rest of the year taken as a control period. We then subtracted the control ICPCview from the three ICPCviews being considered. The pattern for the week preceding the outbreak ICPCview clearly foresees that seen during the week of the outbreak peak (Figures 3A and 3B) [27]. This pattern combines general symptoms (fever) and digestive symptoms (abdominal pain and vomiting), which are what is to be expected during an influenza-like or gastroenteritis outbreak. At this point, field epidemiologists and reference laboratories are needed to finalize the characterization of the epidemic detected.",

Indeed, our primary goal is to help recognize, as early as possible, totally unexpected epidemiological patterns. The detection-triggering signal can be the mere increase of an isolated diagnosis code. Pertinently, in this case, a regression method with a threshold would have performed better only under the very restrictive condition that this code would have been identified in advance. However, the signal can also be an unusual association of different color patches on the monitor, which appear to be novel to the observer, and trigger an in depth epidemiological investigation.",

Similarly, for the HED, the choice of weekly resolution was only illustrative and was imposed by the numbers of data available per day, keeping in mind that several hundred cases are needed to create an informative image. In a real-world application, the choice of the temporal resolution would depend on the nature of the class of events to be identified: hourly resolution or, at worst, daily resolution would be desirable to recognize a terrorist attack-associated disease. The temporal resolution chosen also reflects the spatial resolution, with the number of cases observed indeed being a decreasing function of both spatial and temporal resolutions.",

Indeed, in light of the public health and political scandal that ensued, it is highly rewarding that the images generated with our model heralded the high morbidity and mortality (later documented) that passed unnoticed. At the time of the event, the only public health warnings came from newspapers and funeral parlors, not from the health information systems, which were therefore far from the ideal real-time systems we described above.

Simulated data sets could be generated by adding a given number of codes of interest (e.g., those compatible with an anthrax attack) to an existing database (e.g., the present HED database). Epidemiology watchers would then be shown the successive monitors displaying the evolution of the images within the graphic reference frame, and asked to indicate whether and when they could identify an outbreak. Such a design would allow easy computation the sensitivity and specificity of the system (as a function of the number of simulated codes added to the database).
