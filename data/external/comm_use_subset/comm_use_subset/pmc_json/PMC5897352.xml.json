            "text": "Glycosylation is one of the most important modification reactions, in which sugar moieties are transferred to small molecular acceptors thereby leading to the formation of diverse glycosides with therapeutical potentials1. The enzyme-based glycosylations are mainly performed by two types of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), glycosyltransferases (GTs, EC 2.4.x.y) and glycosidases (glycoside hydrolases; EC 3.2.x.y)2. Glycosidases are naturally hydrolytic enzymes that normally cleave glycosidic bonds3. However, glycosidase-assisted glycosylations are able to be achieved by trans-glycosylation reactions under certain controlled conditions4. The majority of glycosylation reactions in nature are performed in GT-catalyzed fashion, in which the carbohydrate moieties from activated NDP-sugars are transferred to acceptor molecules5. Also, GT-catalyzed glycosylations were accomplished by running the GT reactions in reverse6. New glycosides can be generated by reversible sugar or aglycon exchange reactions catalyzed by GTs with the addition of excess of NDP6,7. It is therefore obvious that GTs are generally perceived as bidirectional biocatalysts used in glycosylation of small molecules1,8,9. Yet, despite the validated potential of GTs in glycosides production, the extensive applications of GTs in industry remained limited due to the requirement of expensive NDP-sugars or NDP in GT-catalyzed forward or reversible reactions. Here, we report that a flavonoid GT, designated as OcUGT1, catalyzes the trans-glycosylation reactions, allowing the formation of glycosides without the additions of NDP-sugars or NDP. Specifically, in a screen of novel biocatalysts for flavonoid glycosylations from medicinal plant Ornithogalum caudatum, we found a multifunctional flavonoid GT OcUGT1 exhibiting at least six types of functions, including classical sugar transfer reaction and three reversible reactions namely NDP-sugar synthesis, sugars exchange and aglycons exchange reactions, as well as glycosidase specific hydrolysis and trans-glycosylation reactions. These evidences indicated that OcUGT1 shows both glycosyltransferase and glycosidase activities (Fig. 1). The unusual multifunctionality of OcUGT1 broadens its applicability, thereby enhancing the glycoconjugates diversity.",

Many of these flavonoid glycosides were hence developed to clinical drugs, including rutin13\u201315, puerarin16 and scutellarin17. The growing interest for the therapeutic potential of flavonoid glycosides has spurred increasing efforts in enzymatic glycodiversification of flavonoids. Glycodiversification had long been known to be monitored mainly by GTs18. The discovery of GTs with expanded promiscuity is therefore a necessary prerequisite for diversifying natural products glycosylation in practice. O. caudatum, also named O. longibracteatum, is known in Chinese folk medicine to have anticancer, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities19. Prior studies revealed that varied flavonoid glycosides, including flavonoid glucosides, galactosides, arabinosides and rutinosides were present in O. caudatum19\u201321, suggesting the existence of corresponding flavonoid GTs. Thus, O. caudatum was chosen as the plant template for flavonoid GTs isolation in the present work.",

            "text": "A total of 13 compounds with varied structures were used as sugar acceptors for glycosylation reactions (Fig. 2). OcUGT1 was predicted to display 7-O-GT activity. Chrysin (2) having two hydroxyl groups locating at the C-7 and C-5 positions was therefore used as the flavonoid substrate to test the glycosylation activity of OcUGT1 firstly. After incubation of chrysin (2) with the purified OcUGT1 protein for 2 h at 50 \u00b0C with a continue shaking, a new peak (marked with 2a) was present but in contrast, the control showed no any conversion of chrysin (2), indicating the newly formed peak is a catalytic product of OcUGT1 (Supplementary result section I). The newly formed product was then analyzed by electrospray ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry (ESI-TOF-MS) method. The ESI-MS spectrum of compound 2a showed [M + HCOOH-H]\u2212 peak at m/z 461.07, suggesting the molecular mass of this compound was 416, which was consistent with the introduction of a glucosyl group to the parent skeleton (Supplementary result section I). To further confirm the exact structure, 2 mg of this monoglucosylated chrysin was collected using HPLC and then used for NMR analysis. The metabolite was assigned to chrysin 7-glucoside (2a) based on 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra data (Supplementary result section I). The kinetic studies of OcUGT1-catalyzed glycosylation of chrysin (2) and UDP-Glc were then carried out. As shown in Supplementary Figure S3, the pH and temperature optimum were determined to pH 8 and 50 \u00b0C. The glycosylations of other substrates were thus performed under the optimal pH and temperature afterwards. Moreover, metal cations were observed to inhibit OcUGT1-catalyzed glycosylation reactions (Supplementary Figure S3C). The Km and Vmax values for chrysin (2) were 0.1506 \u00b1 0.0139 mM and 0.2789 \u00b1 0.0073 mM/h, respectively. The data clearly showed that OcUGT1 did encode a flavonoid 7-O-glucosyltransferase, regioselectively attacking the hydroxyl group at C-7 position. This notion was further verified by the glycosylation of luteolin (1) (Fig. 3), a flavonoid with multiple hydroxyl groups including a free 7-OH. The conversion of luteolin (1) showed seven newly formed metabolites 1a-1g (Fig. 3). The ESI-MS spectrum of compounds 1a-1c showed [M-H]\u2212 peak at m/z 447.1 (\u2206m/z of 162), indicating mono-glycosylated products (Supplementary result section II). In addition, three products (1d-1f) with [M-H]\u2212 value of 609.2 revealed their di-glycosylated forms (\u2206m/z of 324) (Supplementary result section II). The minor product 1 g showed a [M + HCOOH]\u2212 value of 817.4 (Supplementary result section II), thus suggesting tri-glycosylation (\u2206m/z of 486). These metabolites were then assigned to luteolin 3\u2032-O-glucoside(1a), luteolin 4\u2032-O-glucoside (1b), luteolin 7-O-glucoside (1c), luteolin 3\u2032,4\u2032-O-diglucoside (1d), luteolin 7,3\u2032-O-diglucoside (1e), luteolin 7,4\u2032-O-diglucoside (1 f) and luteolin 7,3\u2032,4\u2032-O-triglucoside (1 g) based on their NMR spectra data, which were summarized in the Figures S4-13 and Tables S1-2 (Supplementary result section II). The formation of seven glucosides (1a-1g) indicated that in addition to the C-7 hydroxyl group, OcUGT1 was able to attach sugar to C-3\u2032 and C-4\u2032 hydroxyl groups of flavonoids, but not attack the hydroxyl group at C-5 position, consistent with the catalytic behavior towards chrysin (2). The catalytic results of OcUGT1 towards genistein (6) (Supplementary result section III) and daidzein (7) (Supplementary result section IV) further attested the catalytic preference of C-4\u2032 and C-7 positions. Under the action of OcUGT1, both genistein (6) and daidzein (7) were glycosylated to yield a 4\u2032-monoglucoside and a 7-monoglucoside, respectively (Supplementary result sections III and IV).",

Moreover, OcUGT1 could catalyze 2\u2032-hydroxyflavonol (4) to generate three glucosides, including two monoglucosides (4a-4b, [M \u2212 H]\u2212 = 415.2) and a diglucoside (4c, [M + H]+ = 579.2) (Supplementary result section VI). The compounds 4a and 4b were assigned as 2\u2032-hydroxyflavonol 3-glucoside (4a) and 2\u2032-hydroxyflavonol 2\u2032-glucoside (4b) based on their respective NMR data (Supplementary result section VI). No exact structural identification of the diglucoside 4c was carried out due to its trace amount (Supplementary result section VI). However, considering the attack preference of OcUGT1 towards the hydroxyl groups at C-2\u2032 and C-3 positions of 2\u2032-hydroxyflavonol (4), the compound 4c was reasonably deduced to be 2\u2032-hydroxyflavonol 3,2\u2032-diglucoside (4c). The GTs targeting C-2\u2032 position of flavonoids had never been documented10. OcUGT1 was therefore regarded as the first GT glycosylating C-2\u2032 position of flavonoids. Overall, OcUGT1 was able to attach sugars to C-2\u2032, C-3\u2032, C-4\u2032, C-6 and C-7 positions of flavones. Therefore, the monoglycosylated products of 7-hydroxyflavone (5), pinocembrin (8) and naringenin (9) catalyzed by OcUGT1 were reasonably deduced to 7-hydroxyflavone 7-O-glucoside (5a) (Supplementary result section VII), pinocembrin 7-O-glucoside (8a) (Supplementary result section VII), naringenin 4\u2032-O-glucoside (9a) and naringenin 7-O-glucoside (9b) (Supplementary result section VII) according to the catalytic behavior of OcUGT1 toward flavones, as well as the corresponding HPLC profiles and LC-MS results (Supplementary result section VII). Besides flavonoids, OcUGT1 glycosylated other compounds, such as emodin (10) (Supplementary result section VIII), resveratrol (11) (Supplementary result section IX), magnolol (12) (Supplementary result section X) and testosterone (13) (Supplementary result section XI), suggesting the acceptor promiscuity of OcUGT1 (Fig. 2). The percentage yields of OcUGT1 towards the 13 compounds were thus calculated (Fig. 2B). As shown in Fig. 2B, OcUGT1 had the highest glycosylation efficiency for 2 and 13, approaching 90% (Fig. 2B).",

To probe this notion, seven luteolin glucosides (1a-1g) were applied as the substrate of OcUGT1 to react with UDP-Glc in phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 8.0) at 50 \u00b0C for 2 h. As expected, each mono-glucoside (1a, 1b or 1c) was further glycosylated to form two di-glucosides and one tri-glucoside, while all of the three di-glucosides (1d-1f) were further glycosylated to yield the tri-glycoside 1 g (Supplementary result section XII). Surprisingly, in addition to glycosylation, we observed OcUGT1 could catalyze two other reactions, namely hydrolysis and trans-glycosylation reactions. As shown in Supplementary result section XII, the luteolin tri-glucoside 1 g was hydrolyzed to generate two di-glucosides 1d and 1e. Likewise, di-glucoside 1d could be hydrolyzed to produce mono-glucoside 1a, while another di-glucoside 1 f was hydrolyzed to form a mono-glucoside 1b. Moreover, OcUGT1 was found to display trans-glycosylation activity. The glycosyl residue at position 4\u2032 of 1b was transferred to position 3\u2032 or O7 by intra-molecular trans-glycosylation, thereby forming luteolin 3\u2032-O-glucoside (1a) or luteolin 7-O-glucoside (1c). Likewise, OcUGT1-catalyzed trans-glycosylation from 1c to 1b or from 1d to 1e was also observable (Supplementary result section XII).

Moreover, OcUGT1 was found to be catalytic flexibility, hydrolyzing varied glycosides including chrysin-7-glucoside (2a), oNP-\u03b2-Xyl (15), oNP-\u03b2-Glc (16), pNP-\u03b2-Glc(17) and p-Nitrophenyl-\u03b1-D-glucopyranoside (pNP-\u03b1-Glc, 18) (Supplementary result section XII) to corresponding aglycon and monosaccharide.",

The intermolecular trans-glycosylation activity of OcUGT1 was thus firstly investigated using chrysin-7-O-glucoside (2a) as sugar donor and 7-hydroxyflavone (5) as the acceptor. As shown in Fig. 9, OcUGT1 catalyzed an intermolecular trans-glycosylation reaction by transferring a glycosyl moiety from chrysin-7-glucoside (2a) to the acceptor 7-hydroxyflavone (5), thereby forming two new products chrysin (2) and 7-hydroxyflavone 7-O-glucoside (5a) (Fig. 9). The effects of pH, temperature and metal ions on trans-glycosylation activity of OcUGT1 toward chrysin-7-O-glucoside (2a) were studied. As shown in Supplementary Figure S3, OcUGT1 exhibited substantial activity at temperatures from 0 to 70 \u00b0C and displayed the highest activity at 37 \u00b0C. OcUGT1 showed a wide pH tolerance and was optimally active at pH 6.0. EDTA, Ca2+ or Li+ had a significantly stimulatory effect on transglycosylation activity. On the other hand, when 5 mM Mn2+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Co2+ or Cu2+ were included in reaction mixtures, the inhibitory action on OcUGT1 activity was observable (Supplementary Figure S3).",

Surprisingly, in verifying the intermolecular trans-glycosylation from genistein-7-glucoside (6b) to 7-hydroxyflavone (5), we observed the intramolecular trans-glycosylation of genistein-7-glucoside (6b). As illustrated in Supplementary result section XII, the glucosyl group at position O7 of genistein-7-glucoside (6b) was transferred to position 4\u2032, generating genistein-4\u2032-glucoside (6a). It was therefore obvious that there were three metabolites, 6, 6b and 5a, in the reaction mixtures (Supplementary result section XII).

The reaction was stopped by adding 100 \u03bcl methanol and 10 \u03bcl acetic acid. The hydrolytic activity was determined by measuring o-nitrophenol (oNP, 14a) release using HPLC. The effects of pH, temperature and metal ions on hydrolytic capacity were examined as described above, in the pH range from 4 to 11 and in the temperature range 0\u201370 \u00b0C. The kinetic parameters for hydrolytic activity were calculated as mentioned above. Moreover, the catalytic flexibility of OcUGT1 using other glycosides (Supplementary Figure S1) as the substrates was investigated at optimal pH and temperature, as described above.",
