This virus was first identified in the blood of a sentinel Rhesus monkey during a study on Yellow fever in the Zika forest of Uganda in 1947. This was followed by subsequent isolation of this virus from a pool of Aedes mosquitoes of African region (Dick et al., 1952[9]). Since then, several outbreaks of Zika have been reported in humans in Africa and Asia. Currently, it has been reported in Brazil, the Pacific region, and is also known to spread widely in Central and South America. ",

            "text": "The Zika fever illness is generally characterized by some of the symptoms which are similar to other arbovirus infections like Dengue and Chikungunya. These symptoms include fever, malaise, conjunctivitis, rashes on skin, anorexia, headache as well as pain in the muscles and joints (Simpson, 1964[19]). In case of pregnant women, Zika virus may spread from the mother to the fetus and is believed to be associated with microcephaly, a serious birth defect characterized by smaller and poorly developed brain in the newborns (Torjesen, 2016[20]). Pregnant women are therefore advised to avoid traveling to areas prone to incidence of Zika. Zika virus has 25-30 nm nucleocapsid, which is surrounded by a lipid bilayer containing envelope proteins. It has a single stranded RNA genome with 10,141 base pairs accountable for encoding of nearly 3380 amino acids (Fonseca et al., 2014[12]). The virus has two flanking 5' and 3' non-coding regions (NCR) and a long open reading frame (ORF) \u201c59-C-prM-E-NS1-NS2A-NS2BNS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5-39\u201d coding for a polyprotein that cleaves into its envelope (E), capsid (C), precursor membrane (prM), and some other non-structural (NS) proteins (Chambers et al., 1990[5]; Kuno et al., 2007[14]). Zika virus is maintained through a sylvatic transmission cycle. The envelope protein is the major surface protein of the virus, and is involved in various aspects of the viral cycle and is believed to mediate binding and membrane fusion (Lindenbach et al., 2003[15]). The non-structural protein, NS5 has RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) that acts at its C-terminal, while the N-terminal is involved in RNA capping (Lindenbach and Rice, 2003[15]). The 3' non-coding region is made up of about 428 nucleotides having 27 folding patterns (Kuno et al., 2007[14]), which are believed to be involved in the processes like translation, stabilization of the genome, packaging of RNA, and recognition of the cellular or the viral factors (Lindenbach and Rice, 2003[15]).

Hence, it is necessary to develop a substantial amount of immunity in humans against Zika virus to prevent the widespread outbreak of the infection and its associated effects. Taking a step towards this development, we screened the immunogenic epitopes of the envelope protein of Zika virus using an in silico approach. This might be helpful in developing peptide based vaccines against the Zika virus.",

The helper T-cell epitopes and CTL epitopes in the 'Env' protein of Zika virus were identified using the IEDB online tool. The immunogenic peptides were ranked in accordance with their consensus percentile rank from SWISS-PROT program. The lowest percentile rank demonstrated as the best binders.

Currently, the immune-informatics approach is the most promising approach for the development of peptide based vaccines. Due to lack of effective treatment for the microcephaly caused by Zika virus, there is an urgent need for a cost effective vaccine against this deadly virus. Earlier studies have already demonstrated that application of potential epitope(s) instead of whole protein as a vaccine has been confirmed to represent the complete antigenicity of any protein (DeGroot et al., 2002[8]). Also, in the recent past, the epitope based vaccines have given promising results against highly infectious diseases such as H1N1, HIV and Tuberculosis (Correia et al., 2014[6]). These vaccines may have a lower chance of eliciting immune response against self-antigens, thereby avoiding autoimmune responses (Aziz et al., 2008[2]). The traditional molecular immunology techniques used to search for immunogenic peptides to be used as vaccine candidates are extensively time consuming, labour intensive, and expensive. However, as a remedy, in recent years, various computational approaches have been proposed and tested by many researchers to reduce the time, cost, and labour involved (Davies and Flower, 2007[7]; Shi et al., 2015[18]). On the similar lines, the suggested in silico strategy might prove as a boon for the experimental biologists in rapid screening and identification of probable vaccine candidates. T-lymphocytes play a central role in the generation of a protective immune response in many microbial infections (Esser et al., 2003[11]), hence the prediction and screening of T-cell epitopes can be exploited as a potential vaccine candidate is a critical requirement for the designing of epitope-based vaccines.",
