            "text": "Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic and endocrine disorder characterized by hyperglycemia which leads to alterations in carbohydrate, lipid, and protein metabolism, associated with absolute or relative deficiencies in insulin secretion and/or insulin action (Valiathan, 1988). More than 220 million people worldwide have diabetes, and this number is likely to more than double by 2030 (World Health and Organization (WHO), 2009).The management of diabetes with insulin and synthetic oral hypoglycemic drugs (biguanides sulfonylurea and metformin) can produce serious side effects and in addition fails to prevent diabetes-related complications in many patients. A new diabetic management strategy is needed, and it should be more effective and lessen side effects (Prabhar & Doble, 2011). In this regards, several species of plants and plant-based compounds have been described in the scientific literature as having hypoglycemic activity due to their perceived effectiveness, minimal side effects, and relatively low costs (De Sousa et al., 2004).",

However, protective effect of theaflavin on glycoprotein components and TCA cycle enzymes in high-fat diet and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats has not been explored so far. Therefore, the present study was aimed to evaluate effect of theaflavin on glycoprotein components and TCA cycle enzymes in diabetic rats. The structure of theaflavin was given in Fig. 1.",

Experimental results showed that the drugs can significantly reduce high blood sugar, regulate the glycogen synthesis which was very significant to maintain normal blood sugar and improve glucose tolerance. Hence, blood glucose is a key marker for diagnosis and prognosis of diabetes mellitus. Insulin deficiency causes radical elevation in the levels of blood glucose as a result of excessive production of endogenous glucose by hepatic as well as extrahepatic tissues through gluconeogenic and glycogenolytic pathways and reduced consumption of glucose through glycolytic, TCA cycle, glycogenic, and HMP shunt pathways by various tissues during diabetes mellitus (Soling & Kleineke, 1976). Moreover, Insulin deficiency and high levels of plasma glucose in diabetic condition may result in an increased synthesis of oligosaccharide moieties of glycoprotein; hexose, hexosamine, fucose, and sialic acid have an important role in the maintenance of structural integrity of the membrane bilayer. Cell surface glycoproteins have vital roles in the transport of vitamins and lipids, in signal transduction as hormone receptors and in immunological specificity.",

This condition favors reduction in the level of total hemoglobin and elevation in glycosylated hemoglobin which in turn directly proportional to blood glucose (Al-Yassin & Ibrahim, 1981).

Glycoproteins are important components of intracellular matrix, cell membrane, and membranes of sub-cellular organelles (Zachariah & Basu, 1993). During diabetes, synthesis of glycoproteins was decreased because of reduced incorporation of glucose caused by insulin deficiency. Increased glycosylation of various proteins in diabetic patients have also been reported earlier and the elevated of glycoproteins in diabetics may also be a predictor of angiopathic complications (Konukoglu, Serin, Akcay, & Hatemi, 1999; Rahman, Zafar, & Shera, 1990) In this study, we have observed the altered levels of hexose, hexosamine, fucose, and sialic acid in plasma and tissues of streptozotocin and high-fat diet-induced diabetic rats. Theaflavin and metformin administration to diabetic rats normalized the levels of glycoproteins in plasma and tissues. Decreased hyperglycemic state with increased levels of plasma insulin observed in theaflavin- and metformin-treated diabetic rats might be responsible for the beneficial changes in glycoproteins in the plasma, liver, and kidney. In this context, other researchers have shown that a decrease in hyperglycemia could lead to a decrease in glycoprotein levels (Gandhi & Chowdhury, 1979; Latha & Pari, 2005; Sundaram, Naresh, Shanthi, & Sachdanandam, 2012).",

In the present study, the activities of the mitochondrial marker enzymes\u2014isocitrate dehydrogenase, \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase, and malate dehydrogenase levels\u2014were significantly dropped in the liver and kidney of high-fat diet and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.
