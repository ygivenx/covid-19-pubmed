So far, TNF-\u03b1 vaccines based on the whole molecule such as TNF-K and TNF AutoVaccIne have shown remarkable results in animal studies [9, 10]. However, these vaccine strategies are not successful in the human trials. TNF-K is a conjugate mixture of TNF-\u03b1 and KLH. The bioactivity of the cytokine is inactivated by formaldehyde treatment. TNF AutoVaccIne comprises two recombinant TNF-\u03b1 proteins with specific peptides replaced by a CD4 T cell epitope from tetanus toxin. In both cases, the elicited antibody responses against the endogenous molecule were weak while humoral responses against the immunogens or partially denatured TNF-\u03b1 were strong, suggesting that the epitopes are compromised during production processes [11, 12]. Thus a rational design is necessary to generate a stable structure feasible to manufacture.",

However, both approaches unavoidably compromise the immunogenicity of the immunogen. Therefore, a peptide epitope based vaccine design is a preferred choice. Work from Capini et al have shown that a cyclic TNF-\u03b1 epitope peptide (aa 80\u201396) conjugated to KLH elicits a stronger neutralizing antibody response than the linear counterpart, which suggests that stabilizing the conformation of the peptide epitope is a key criterion in the vaccine design [14]. Here, we developed an epitope-scaffold immunogen against TNF-\u03b1, in which the conformation of the epitope peptide TNF-\u03b1 aa 80\u201397 is stabilized by transplantation onto a scaffold molecule, a transmembrane domain of diphtheria toxin (DTT). We assessed the immunogenicity of the vaccine against native TNF-\u03b1 in mice as well as the therapeutic efficacy in collagen-induced arthritis mouse model. Our results showed that DTT-based epitope-scaffold vaccine is a promising strategy for prevention and treatment of autoimmune diseases.",

Firstly, the function of T-domain is engaged in translocation of the catalytic domain of DT across the endosomal membrane in low pH-dependent manner [22]. Thus there is no safety issue associated with this domain [23]. Secondly, DTT has a rigid tertiary structure composed entirely of \u03b1-helices and loops (Fig 1B). Therefore, it potentially tolerates transplantation of a foreign peptide and renders the peptide a more stable conformation [24, 25]. Moreover, DTT can be expressed in E.coli as a highly soluble protein and the CD spectrum of the purified DTT shows a typical helical conformation with two minima at 208 and 222nm (Fig 1C). This would substantially reduce manufacture costs. Thirdly, DTT possesses four T help cell epitopes (aa 69\u201388, 119\u2013138, 129\u2013148, 149\u2013168, corresponding to DT aa 271\u2013290, 321\u2013340, 331\u2013350, and 351\u2013370), each of which is recognized by human major histocompatibility complexes (HAL) with population coverage of 88%, 71%, 82%, 70%, respectively [26]. As human MHC II genes are highly polymorphic, a combination of universal Th epitopes promises more population coverage. Among people previously immunized with DT vaccine, the Th epitopes in a DTT-based vaccine induced a rapid recall response of CD4 memory T cell [27].",

Since the interatomic distance between the end residues of the epitope peptide is 2.88\u00c5 shorter than that of DTT aa 89 and 96, direct transplantation would potentially introduce conformational constraint to both DTT and the epitope. In order to identify appropriate transplantation that keeps the epitope conformation close to that of native molecule while DTT conformation is minimally perturbed, we generated seven epitope-scaffold molecules (Fig 1D) with difference of the interatomic distance between the epitope and the replaced segment (\u0394D) varies in a range of -3.34 \u00c5 to +3.68 \u00c5. As \u0394D of DTNF3 and DTNF4 is close to each other because some of the replaced residues are at the turn of the helix, we choose DTNF4 for further experiments. DTNF7 is generated by replacing DTT 89\u201396 with the epitope peptide encompassing TNF-\u03b1 residues 80\u201397. The inclusion of one more residue in the epitope peptide increases TD to 12.11 \u00c5 and reduces the \u0394D to -0.47 \u00c5.",

In comparison with conjugate vaccines targeting TNF-\u03b1, only transient antibody responses were observed due to lack of Th-dependent B cell response [9, 10].

Shown in Fig 4E, the epitope of DTNF7 is entirely surface exposed. In contrast, conformational stability of the scaffold is perturbed to various degrees in all DTNF proteins with that of DTNF7 the least affected. The helix of DTT at position 97\u2013101 is not stable in DTNF2, DTNF5 and DTNF6 (Fig 4B). Particularly, the helix of DTNF2 is highly flexible and its RMSF is abruptly increased compared with that of DTT (Fig 4C). The residues at position 66\u201369 of DTNF1 also display higher degree of flexibility. The secondary structure of DTNF4 is stable and the epitope conformation is closed to that of TNF-\u03b1. However, its RMSFs at position 123\u2013125 are decreased compared with that of DTT, indicating a more constrained conformation of the scaffold is unfavorable for the epitope presentation (Fig 4D). Consistent with these observations, the solubility of the recombinant proteins varies after storage at 4\u00b0C for 10 days in PBS solution, and DTNF2 is especially unstable and becomes completely insoluble after the storage (Fig 3B).",

Compared with DTT treated mice, DTNF7 vaccination delayed the onset of arthritis by 15 days, reduced arthritis incident rate by 46% (Fig 5B), and markedly decreased the clinical arthritis score by 8 fold (Fig 5C). As shown in Fig 5E, symptoms including joint swelling and erythema were significantly improved. Consistently, histological examination of hind paws demonstrated that DTNF7 vaccination reduced synovial inflammation, cartilage destruction, bone erosion, and immune cell infiltration (Fig 6). The body weights of mice immunized with DTNF7 were similar to those immunized with DTT (Fig 5F). Moreover, the serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines that persist in rheumatoid arthritis including interleukin IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-10 were decreased, although the level changes had not reached statistical significance (Fig 7). Of note, the level of TNF-\u03b1 was not increased after DTNF7 vaccination. This is consistent to passive immunization with a TNF-\u03b1 antibody in which the levels of TNF-\u03b1 is not down-regulated after administration [31].",

The plasma level of TNF-\u03b1 is extraordinarily high in the CIA model mice (2000 pg/ml) compared to that of TNF-\u03b1 transgenic mice (9 pg/ml) [10]. Consequently, we were unable to determine whether the anti-TNF-\u03b1 antibodies elicited by DTNF7 immunization could neutralize bioactivity with L929 assay using diluted sera. Measurements of the plasma levels of cytokines downstream of TNF-\u03b1 such as IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 on day 28 and 56 were less in DTNF7 compared with DTT immunization in the CIA mice.
