The discrete populations themselves are subdivided in terms of infection status with compartments for susceptible, incubating, infectious, and recovered individuals. Development of these models presents many challenges related to the characterization of the populations, the disease, and relevant travel patterns. We focus here on oft-neglected assumptions related to the characterization of travel which may affect the speed and pattern of epidemic growth and spread.",

In the real world, some travelers are migrating, but for most, travel is temporary. For example, each year there are approximately 175 million total admissions to the United States and approximately 1.1 million people obtain legal permanent resident status [14]. Thus, less than 1% of travelers entering the U.S. are migrating. An alternative to adopting this approach is to segregate travelers from local residents structurally, maintaining them as separate groups inhabiting the same area as a resident population (Figure 1). Separating travelers from residents this way allows them to return to their place of origin after a temporary stay in their destination.",

The majority of outbound US traveler purposes can be classified as leisure/recreation/holidays (40%), visiting friends and relatives (34%), or business (18%) [16]. Those visiting friends and relatives are more likely to stay in private homes, to stay longer, to interact more closely with the local population, and to have higher exposure risks [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21].",

Many models quantify travel volumes or frequencies in terms of the number of seats available on direct flights between each location and average occupancy on those flights [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. While this may accurately classify non-connecting travel (\u223c80% of travel itineraries based on U.S Department of Transportation sampled itinerary data), it completely misses travelers who fly on itineraries containing one or more connections. As a result, this simplification underestimates long-distance travel, because no one can fly between cities that are not directly connected, and overestimates short-distance travel, because it assumes that all travelers are traveling direct. Limiting travel in this way may lead to alteration and truncation of the pattern of spread, especially when transmission risk is heterogeneous across the network.",

The incubating and infectious compartments all included sub-compartments to allow more realistic incorporation of the time periods spent in each [22].

In contrast, there were long-term differences in the models of the vector-borne pathogen. In the traveler model, initial epidemics were followed by global extinction of the pathogen within two years (Figure 3A). In contrast, the migration model allowed continued mixing of the population leading to susceptible replenishment in affected cities. Once the initial outbreak in the initial city subsided, 18.0% (95%CI: 17.6\u201318.3%) of that population was replaced by immigrating susceptibles within one year.

For example, introducing heterogeneity among travelers reduced the average epidemic size in all models by a maximum of approximately 0.40%. These reductions occur because a proportion of travelers are never exposed, thus reducing the effective susceptible population size. A greater change in local epidemic size was seen in the direct-travel-only model for the vector-borne pathogen. The direct-travel-only model assumes that every seat is potentially used by a direct traveler as opposed to a seat potentially used by a connecting traveler. This overestimation of direct travel increases the overall volume of travel and thus leads to greater local replenishment of susceptibles, a phenomenon which takes on added importance when transmission is spatially heterogeneous. Though the mechanism is different, the effect of susceptible replenishment is also seen in the migration model. In this case, the replenishment of approximately 18% of the population within a single year led to recurrent epidemics, something completely absent from the traveler model.",

Treating travelers as migrants reduced the speed of spread to other areas by approximately 3.3 and 6.7 days in models of the directly transmitted and vector-borne pathogens, respectively. This difference is likely due to proportional changes in the travelling population. Once an epidemic begins in a given city, travelers leaving that city will contain a mix of previously exposed (i.e. immune) individuals proportional to the general population. In the traveler model, this proportion is reduced by half because only half of the travelers are outgoing residents; the other half are visitors returning to their home. Because there are more susceptible travelers leaving and returning to cities where the pandemic has yet to arrive, the likelihood of a newly exposed individual arriving is slightly increased in the traveler model.",

Assuming that no travelers travel beyond the cities directly connected to their residential city delayed spread of the directly transmitted pathogen by an average of 10.5 days and the vector-borne pathogen by an average of 188 days. For both, that effect was spatially heterogeneous. The cities with high connectivity to the origin city experienced early introduction and distant cities, delayed introduction. For the vector-borne pathogen, the effects are more evident because cities with vector populations are not necessarily directly connected to each other. Of the ten randomly selected cities with vectors, a single city was directly connected to the origin city and four cities were not directly connected to any other city with a vector population. For these isolated cities, the pathogen could only arrive via an individual who is exposed in one city, returns to his/her vector-free home city and later travels to another city before recovering. With the large, intervention-free epidemics produced in our model, spread to these isolated cities did reliably occur except for in the city where an epidemic only occurred in 40% of the simulations (Figure 5C). With smaller epidemics this truncation of spread would likely be more common.",

When incubation periods are much shorter than the amount of time spent in other areas, individuals are less likely to be incubating or infectious when they return home. For the models discussed here, the average durations of infection in humans were 11.22 and 9.5 days for SARS-CoV and DENV, respectively (including the incubating and infectious stages as defined here). In this case, the duration of infection is less than the average duration of stay (18 days), so some travelling individuals will recover before returning home. Thus, with shorter durations of infection or longer stays, the rate of spread will decrease, and with longer durations of infection and shorter stay, it will increase.",

The traveler model, for example, is essentially a structural upgrade relative to the migration model as it requires a single new parameter: the duration of stay. Though we used a universal exponential distribution to describe the duration of stay in the base model, it could also be parameterized as location-specific or time-dependent. The delayed introduction and the long-term persistence associated exclusively with the unrealistic, yet mostly commonly used, migration-style model suggest that it is not ideally suited to these types of studies. Developing a traveler model rather than a migration model requires a single additional parameter and a multiplicative increase in structural complexity as each location-compartment needs to be replicated in each other location. This increase in structural complexity, however, is not a formidable barrier given the power of modern day computers.",

Spatial heterogeneity may be somewhat overstated in our vector-borne model, but some level of spatiotemporal heterogeneity is generally present even for directly transmitted pathogens [31], [32].

[33] also used the US sampled data to compare air travel network models with the goal of reducing their complexity. While their proposed, simplified model replicates actual data well, it is not easily extendable to a global scale where there are less input data and is not conducive to the explicit treatment of travelers that we have described. Accurate characterization of global air travel requires a substantial sample of global itineraries with accompanying data to help determine the duration of stay and likely exposure risks such as staying in hotels versus homes. It is critical to know where people truly travel (actual origin and destination), how long they stay in their destination, and how travel patterns vary throughout the year. Better data on true origin and destination would also help to classify the directional flow of travelers such as in the skewed-travel model presented here. Although the data requirements for full parameterization of travel are extensive, the necessary data exist, but they are proprietary and the cost of their acquisition is prohibitive for most scientific studies.",
