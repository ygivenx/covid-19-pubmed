Several arenaviruses cause significant human disease, including the New World viruses Junin [3], Machupo [4], and Guanarito [5], which cause hemorrhagic fever syndromes in South America [6]. Lassa virus and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), the target virus for this assay, are both Old World arenaviruses. Lassa virus causes Lassa fever along the western coast of Africa [7] while LCMV, which has a worldwide distribution, is responsible for aseptic meningitis [8]. LCMV is also a potent teratogen [9] as well as a highly lethal pathogen in immunosuppressed individuals [10]. In addition, LCMV is the prototypical virus for the family and is widely used as a model organism to study arenavirus replication and pathogenesis, as well as the adaptive immune response to viral infection [8].",

            "text": "The arenavirus genome consists of two single-stranded RNA segments, L and S, which each encode two proteins in an ambisense manner [11,12,13]. The L segment encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) and the matrix (Z) proteins, while the S segment encodes the nucleoprotein (NP) and the glycoprotein precursor (GPC) proteins. The L and S genomic RNA segments (vRNAs) are packaged within infectious virus particles [14,15]. Following virion attachment and entry into permissive host cells, the virion-packaged vRNAs, in association with L and NP, are released into the cytoplasm where they serve as templates for both viral genomic replication and transcription (reviewed in [6,15]). This process begins with the transcription of the mRNAs for both NP (on the S segment) and L (on the L segment) from the L and S vRNA templates. After transcription of these mRNAs has progressed to a certain point, the viral polymerase begins replication of the vRNAs to generate antigenomic (vcRNA) or full-length, complementary copies of each vRNA segment. These vcRNAs then serve as templates for the generation of additional L and S segment vRNAs as well as transcription of the mRNAs for both GPC (S segment) and Z (L segment). In total, eight different viral RNA species are generated during arenavirus infection: two vRNAs, two vcRNAs, and four mRNAs (see Fig 1).",

            "text": "LCMV can establish a persistent state of infection in both rodent and in vitro cell culture models (reviewed in [8,16,17]). Infectious virus production typically peaks within the first few days of infection, followed by a marked drop in GPC expression as well as release of infectious virus during persistence [18,19]. Infectious virus production, while low during persistence, can also be quite cyclical [20,21,22]. The mechanism(s) by which LCMV regulates the replication and transcription of its genome over the course of infection and the specific details regarding the dynamics of this process are not fully understood. One tool that is needed to address these outstanding questions is a highly sensitive assay to distinguish and quantitate each of the LCMV replicative RNA species. In the current study, we developed a strand-specific, quantitative (Q)RT-PCR assay for quantification of LCMV S and L segment vRNA and vcRNA. We also describe a phenomenon whereby LCMV RNA species are, in the absence of a virus-specific RT primer, nonspecifically primed for cDNA synthesis during RT reactions and a means to circumvent this nonspecific priming for accurate measurement of individual viral RNA species. We used the assay to evaluate LCMV genome replication at acute and persistent time points and also to determine the viral RNA content of purified virions. This assay will enable studies of the dynamics and efficiency of LCMV replication and also provide a highly sensitive diagnostic platform for measurement of total S and L segment-derived viral RNA species.",

(Coralville, IA). Biotinylated versions of the RT primers were HPLC purified. The TaqMan primers (4304971) and minor grove binder (MGB) probes (4316033) listed in Table 3 were obtained from Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA). Each MGB probe was labeled with the 5\u2019 reporter dye 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) and a 3\u2019 non-fluorescent quencher (NFQ) attached to a minor groove binder (MGB) moiety. Note that during RT primer design we used the software program Amplify to verify that each primer would only be predicted to anneal to the intended target viral RNA species but not other LCMV replicative or transcriptional RNA species.",

The resulting cDNAs were then used in a series of PCR reactions to determine the region of the LCMV S segment that was converted to cDNA (Fig 4). While we were unable to amplify a full-length (3376 bp) S segment PCR product, we did detect products covering large portions of the S segment. A 1785 bp PCR product was detected from both RNA samples using primers covering the S segment from its 5\u2019 terminus (position 1 relative to the vRNA) through both the adjacent GP gene and the IGR to position 1785, which lies in the NP gene just beyond the IGR (see primer pair C in Fig 4). Inversely, an 1887 bp product ranging from the 3\u2019 terminus (position 3376 relative to the vRNA) through both the adjacent NP gene and the IGR to position 1489 in the GPC gene was amplified from both samples, although the signal from the virion RNA preparation was very faint compared to the Vero E6 cell-derived RNA sample (see primer set D in Fig 4). We also amplified a slightly smaller (1501 bp) PCR product from both samples that ranged from the 3\u2019 terminus (position 3376 relative to the vRNA) to the far side of the NP gene, just prior to the IGR (position 1856 relative to the vRNA) (see primer set E in Fig 4). In summary, our data suggest that large regions of the S segment are converted to cDNA in a primer-independent manner during RT. While our data indicate that the extent of cDNA conversion is similar for viral RNA from cells versus virions, the efficiency of this conversion appears to be greater in host cells.",

One effective strategy to circumvent this phenomenon has been the use of biotinylated RT primers to generate target-specific cDNAs and streptavidin-coated magnetic beads to affinity purify these biotinylated cDNAs for downstream quantitation via QPCR [29,30,36,37]. To test whether this strategy would work in our system, we performed traditional RT-PCR on an RNA sample derived from a high titer stock of cell-free LCMV virions. Three RT conditions were tested: one with a standard RT primer, one with a biotinylated RT primer, and one without an RT primer. Following RT, a fraction of each sample was subjected to affinity purification with streptavidin-coated beads as described in the Methods and then both input and affinity purified cDNAs were subjected to PCR. As expected, a positive PCR signal was detected for each of the 3 unpurified cDNA samples (see Fig 5A). For the samples subjected to affinity purification, a strong signal was detected from the sample containing the biotinylated RT primer while a faint signal was detected in the other two conditions, indicating elimination of most of the undesired non-specific product, but not all.",

Interestingly, despite a 1424-fold reduction in the quantity of infectious virus released into the supernatant at 18 hr versus 24 d pi, the levels of replicative RNAs decreased by no more than 3.1-fold (3.1 \u00b1 0.3-fold, S vRNA; 1.1 \u00b1 0.1-fold, S vcRNA; 2.0 \u00b1 0.3-fold, L vRNA; and 1.0 \u00b1 0.1-fold, L vcRNA) (Fig 7B). The observed cyclical pattern of genome replication and infectious virus production as well as the inverse relationship between viral RNA and infectious virus during acute versus persistent infection is consistent with previous reports from in vitro and in vivo models [20,21,38,39]. In summary, these experiments further characterize the dynamics of LCMV replication and highlight the utility of this assay for measuring arenavirus genomic replication.",

These approaches have ranged from standard RT-PCR to screen for the presence or absence of a particular viral RNA species [14,40,41,42] to Northern blot [11], in situ hybridization [43,44], or RNase protection assay [14] to more accurately determine the quantities of a given target RNA. Limitations of the latter three assays include the requirement for large quantities of RNA and/or radioactive reagents coupled with limited sensitivity and throughput. The QRT-PCR assay we describe overcomes these limitations and therefore is a valuable research tool for the field. Indeed, several groups from both basic and clinical research settings have reported the use of QRT-PCR approaches to quantitate LCMV RNA load [45,46,47,48,49]. However, these assays were not designed to specifically track individual LCMV replicative RNA species. Additionally, for the assay that theoretically does prime for a specific viral RNA [45], nonspecific cDNA synthesis during RT was not taken into account.",

Nonspecific-priming is not exclusive to arenaviruses and is a common issue for both positive- and negative-sense ssRNA viruses [28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35]. In each case, nonspecific-priming during RT makes it impossible to accurately quantify an individual RNA species during the subsequent PCR. Across the various ssRNA virus families, several strategies have been used as a means to overcome this complication. One such strategy is tagged PCR [28,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,50,51,52,53], where RT primers contain a specific tag sequence, not related to the viral sequence in question, that is then subsequently targeted in the PCR. Another strategy has been the use of biotinylated RT primers to permit affinity purification of biotinylated target cDNAs prior to PCR [29,30,36,37]. We were able to successfully utilize the latter strategy to isolate cDNAs derived from specific LCMV RNA species for downstream PCR applications.",

            "text": "There are several means by which nonspecific priming may be occurring. First, the different viral RNA species share significant areas of complementarity and may be self-priming to one another during RT. For example, the GPC mRNA, which is complementary to the S segment vcRNA, could act as a primer for cDNA synthesis of the vcRNA template. Similarly, the NP, L and Z mRNA could prime cDNA synthesis of S vRNA, L vRNA, and L vcRNA, respectively. Likewise, the NP and GPC mRNAs are complementary to one another over stretches of their intergenic regions (IGRs) and each molecule could prime cDNA synthesis of the other (the L and Z mRNAs could do the same). Alternatively, or in combination, host RNA or DNA molecules may also have the ability to \u201cnonspecifically\u201d prime cDNA synthesis from viral RNA templates. It is also possible that the viral RNAs themselves are cleaved by either host nucleases and/or the viral NP [54,55] and that the resulting fragments act to prime the remaining intact viral RNAs for cDNA synthesis. Finally, individual viral RNAs may contain secondary structure that permits \u201cself-priming\u201d to occur. While each of these mechanisms is plausible within an infected cell, it is unlikely that they are all happening in the context of cell-free virions. In particular, it is unlikely that viral RNAs packaged into virions are fragmented. Additionally, priming via viral mRNAs is unlikely to account for the full spectrum of nonspecific priming seen as only the Z mRNA is known to be packaged into viral particles in large quantity [11,56].",

            "text": "We conducted a series of PCR reactions to map the primer-independent cDNAs generated from LCMV S segment RNAs during RT. While full-length S segment cDNAs were not detectable, we were able to amplify PCR products that began at either end of the S segment and, in each case, spanned the adjacent gene, the IGR, and went partially into the gene on the far side of the IGR (as shown in Fig 4). If viral mRNAs were the sole cause of nonspecific priming, we would predict that the IGR on the viral RNA species being primed would not be converted to cDNA because the 3\u2019 end of the mRNA primer would contain part or all of the IGR. Therefore, while our data do not rule out that viral mRNAs can act as primers during RT, they do suggest that additional priming mechanism(s) are occurring. This result could be expected for virion-derived RNAs due to their lack of abundant mRNA for three of the four viral genes [11,56]. Alternatively, if LCMV RNAs are fragmented during infection, the small RNA fragments could act to prime intact viral RNAs for cDNA conversion and generate a series of variable-sized cDNAs. If these cDNAs have regions of complementarity to one another, a PCR primer pair may not amplify a single cDNA of the expected size but rather a collection of smaller cDNAs to produce the full sized product. While our mapping experiments provide basic information regarding the extent that the S segment is converted to cDNA, additional studies will need to be performed to fully define i) the precise composition and diversity of cDNAs generated for both the L and S segment and ii) the mechanism(s) by which these cDNAs are formed. If the precise nature of the nonspecific priming was known, a subtractive method could be used to account for nonspecifically-primed species and permit enumeration of the various viral RNA species without the requirement of a purification step. However, regardless of the primer-independent cDNAs that form during RT or the mechanism responsible for their formation, the assay described here circumvents these issues and allows precise quantification of individual viral RNAs.",

The ratio of S vRNA to L vRNA (1.5 \u00b1 0.1) (Fig 7A and Table 5) observed was consistent with previous studies [15]. We also confirmed the previous RNase protection-based finding that S and L segment vcRNAs are packaged into virions [14] and demonstrated that the quantity of each of these vcRNAs is less than the corresponding vRNA in each case (7.0 \u00b1 0.3-fold less S vcRNA versus S vRNA; 3.3 \u00b1 0.4-fold less L vcRNA versus L vRNA). This finding may help to explain why, in virions, the levels of L and S segment vcRNAs detected in the absence of an RT primer sometimes approached, or slightly exceeded, the quantities seen with the vcRNA-specific RT primer (Fig 3 and Table 4). For instance, it is possible that the quantity of nonspecifically-primed cDNAs generated from the more abundant vRNA templates is close to, or may exceed, the total quantity of vcRNAs available for primer-specific cDNA conversion. Because these vRNA-derived cDNAs can theoretically be detected using the vcRNA QPCR primer-probe set, their presence would increase the copies of vcRNA detected without an RT primer, making this value closer to the quantity seen following the addition of the vcRNA-specific primer. In the case of the cell-free supernatants derived from infected cells at 12 hr, 18 hr, or 24 d pi, the percentage of S segment vcRNA detected without an RT primer was low compared to the values seen with the primer (Fig 3B and Table 4). Because we saw the opposite result (more vcRNA copies without the RT primer than with the RT primer) for the sucrose-banded virions collected at 48 hr pi, this may indicate that the vcRNA content in virions can vary over the course of infection. Alternatively, because the 12 hr, 18 hr, and 24 d pi supernatants were not purified via density ultracentrifugation, is possible that dead or dying cells released S segment RNA species into the media, which could have increased the quantity of vcRNA detected in these samples.",

In this scenario, where the goal is simply to measure viral RNA load across samples, there is no longer a need for affinity purification of a biotinylated cDNA. We have successfully used this approach by including a single primer in the RT reaction (e.g. a primer specific to the vRNA of the L or S segment). Alternatively, to gain sensitivity, both the vRNA- and vcRNA-specific primers for a particular segment can be included in the RT reaction. For example, we have used this approach to reliably detect LCMV S segment RNA in the spleens of mice as few as 3 hours following experimental challenge [57]. Another pratical use of this assay is to measure virion attachment to host cells as we have described for JUNV Candid #1 [58].
