In 1979, Charache et al. [13] first suggested using the term \u201cacute chest syndrome\u201d for this complication, acknowledging the difficulties in determining its pathogenesis. Till nowadays, the pathophysiology of ACS remains not fully elucidated, yet multiple risk factors have been identified including: male sex, younger age, higher steady-state of leukocyte counts and hemoglobin level, lower hemoglobin F (HbF) concentrations, previous history of ACS, history of asthma, active smoking or environmental smoke exposure. Furthermore, ACS may be more severe in individuals with HbSS as compared with HbSC disease [6, 7, 14\u201317].",

The most common therapy includes nonspecific supportive care strategies aimed at hastening recovery to baseline, including: hospitalization, hydration, analgesics, broad-spectrum antibiotics, bronchodilators, incentive spirometry, supplemental oxygen, and blood transfusions [6, 11, 18, 19].",

Table 1 displays the study population\u2019s general profile. Ages ranged from 11 months to 16 years, with a mean of 5.5 (3.4) years, and males were more represented than females with a sex ratio of 3.2/1 (Tables 1 and 2). Only seven patients had a hemoglobin electrophoresis dating back to less than one year, HbS ranging from 55 % to 86 % with a mean of 75.1 (11.9) %, and HbF, from 6.4 % to 21.9 % with a mean of 14.6 (6.0) % (Table 2). Only 38.1 % of children were regularly followed-up, i.e. were used to visiting the unit for a check-up at least every 3 months. Besides, not more than 33.3 % of our patients had been adequately vaccinated in accordance with their ages, and only 3 children aged 0\u20135 years (27.3 %) were currently taking an antibiotic prophylaxis (Table 1).",

This proportion is comparable to the 1.9 ACS episodes/month among hospitalized SCD children in Bruxelles [15], and higher than the 1.4, 0.3 and 0.2 ACS episodes/month respectively reported in Brazzaville, Antananarivo and French Guiana [20\u201322]. However, our prevalence of ACS is lower than the 10\u201320 % rate of hospital admissions reported by Miller and Gladwin in their review [6]. Our prevalence may be an underestimate of the real burden of ACS among our children suffering from SCD for some reasons. First, hemoglobin electrophoresis is not systematically performed in our milieu, and many parents neither know their status nor that of their kids. As we considered only known SCD patients, some unknown SCD patients may have presented this condition and escaped from enrolment. Second, due to parents\u2019 financial constraints, we are used to performing just one chest x-ray during hospitalization. As a result, we could have missed all those whose first chest x-ray was normal but who developed ACS later on, given that radiographic findings in case of ACS may progress over time [9, 11, 23]. If it is true that a positive chest x-ray is the key element to define the disease [12], there have been some claims that a single negative chest x-ray cannot exclude the disease [23\u201325], taking into account that clinical assessment may appear inadequate to identify ACS [11]. It has been also suggested that every SCD patient presenting with fever must undergo a chest x-ray [11, 24].",

This is truer for adults than children, as the latter usually present with ACS at admission [26]. In our study for instance, only 2 children (9.5 %) developed ACS 2 days after admission, and pains were concomitantly associated in 52.4 % of cases. Some risk factors involved in the development of ACS during hospital stay have been identified such as the male sex, past medical history of ACS, thoracic pains at entry and use of morphine during hospitalization [15, 27].",

Despite the fact that we did not have our patients\u2019 baseline leukocyte counts (explained by the fact that many of our patients are not regularly followed-up and are from financially-limited families), we noticed very high leukocyte counts [32479 (17862) mm3], especially neutrophils [23476 (11543) mm3], associated with elevated serum CRP levels [228.2 (132.6]. These elements are also strongly suggestive that infection may initiate or precipitate the development of ACS among our patients, corroborating previous reports elsewhere [15, 16]. However, though blood culture was not performed in all patients, no germ was identified. This result was also reported by Rucknagel et al. [25] who incriminated rib infarction as the main etiology of ACS. But without invasive procedures (bronchoscopy with broncho-alveolar lavage), it is very difficult to rule out conclusively a bacterial infection as a cause of ACS. Microorganisms that have been identified associated with ACS include Streptococcus pneumonia, Chlamydiae pneumonia, Mycoplasma pneumonia, influenza virus A H1N1, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus and coronavirus among others [15, 21, 23].",

Contrariwise, other studies showed that the main radiological localizations of ACS were the upper lobes in children, and the lower ones in adults [9, 20]. While the upper lobes predominance has been associated with an infectious etiology especially in children, the lower or multi-lobes predominance has been linked to pulmonary thrombosis and fat embolism [9, 16, 20] or rib infarction [25]. Our results are therefore suggestive that the pathogenesis of ACS in our setting is also multifactorial. Further well-designed studies with large sample sizes are warranted to better elucidate the etiology of ACS in our setting.",

Actually, only patients presenting respiratory distress were placed on oxygen, mainly due to limitation of resources. Likewise, we transfused only SCD patients who had a hemoglobin level \u2264 7 g/dl given that blood safety remains an issue of major concern in the milieu [29]. Although transfusion did not reduce the hospital stay, it significantly increased the hemoglobin level (p = 0.039), perhaps improving therefore the clinical state of our patients. Early transfusion of SCD patients presenting with ACS should be encouraged in SSA settings, especially transfusion of packed red blood cells instead of whole blood to reduce transfusion-related adverse reactions, despite recurrent blood shortages that occur in the region [30]. Nonetheless, more studies are needed to underpin this suggestion with robust scientific evidence and indicate which threshold should be considered to transfuse SCD children suffering from ACS.",

Introduction of other supportive care in our practice like bronchodilators and incentive spirometry as elsewhere [6, 19], along with systematic oxygen supplementation and early blood transfusion could substantially reduce the duration of hospital stay. Furthermore, the use of dexamethasone deserves some close considerations. In fact, there is body of evidence bolstering that low dose dexamethasone (0.3 mg/kg/12 \u00d7 4 doses) significantly diminished the duration of hospital stay, the need for blood transfusion, oxygen and analgesics use, and duration of fever, without a rebound effect [31] which was observed with high dose methylprednisolone in cases of VOC [32].",

Patients\u2019 parents should be educated to recognize early signs and symptoms of the disease, and consult rapidly. Additionally, clinicians must be trained to correctly diagnose ACS, and manage it promptly and efficiently to avoid its related catastrophic consequences.
