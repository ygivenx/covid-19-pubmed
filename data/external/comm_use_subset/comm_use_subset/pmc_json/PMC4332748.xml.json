            "text": "Infections with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) are two of the most common and important infectious diseases of cats [1,2]. The most common mode of transmission of FIV is through bites [3,4]. FeLV infection is also commonly acquired via the oro-nasal route through mutual grooming, nursing or sharing of dishes apart from bites [3]. The known risk factors for acquiring these infections are male sex, adulthood and exposure to outdoors, whereas being neutered and indoor lifestyle are known protective factors [5]. However, the relative importance attributed to age, outdoor exposure and sex among infected cats is variable in the literature. Some studies indicate that FeLV infections are age-dependent [6] and primarily acquired by \u201cfriendly\u201d cats through prolonged close contact between virus shedders and susceptible cats through mutual grooming, sharing of food and water dishes, and use of common litter areas [3]. However, other studies have indicated adulthood [1,7], outdoor lifestyle [1,7], being not neutered [8], and fighting [8,9], factors commonly associated with FIV, to also be associated with FeLV infection. Thus, further research is necessary to investigate the relative importance of these factors to help in management and prevention of these infections.",

Case-case studies are a variant of case\u2013control studies when the disease of interest can be sub-classified in two or several groups that may have distinct risk factors [11]. A case\u2013case study differs from a case\u2013control study in that the comparison group (or controls) are also selected among the cases, typically with same disease but a different strain or serotype, from the same surveillance system [11]. The case-case study approach has been used increasingly in epidemiology e.g. to compare risk factors for two subtypes of the same disease with the goal of ascertaining relative importance of risk factors for either subtype [11]. The main advantage of the case-case design is its ability to limit selection and information biases: control cases have similar clinical features, are identified through the same system and are subject to the same biases as cases [11,12]. The goal of this study was to assess the relative importance of known risk factors between the two common feline retroviral infections, FIV and FeLV, using the case-case study approach.",

In Canada, potential veterinary clinic and animal shelter (including cat rescue programs and feral cat programs in Canada) participants were identified as all those who had purchased test kits for FIV or FeLV or submitted samples to a diagnostic laboratory [7]. Potential study participants were sent an invitation letter to participate in the study. Enrolled participants submitted the diagnostic results for FIV and FeLV along with information on age, sex, neuter status, outdoor exposure, health status and test date using a standard reporting form.

Since all the predictor variables were categorical (i.e. indicator variables), the significance in the model of each group of the predictors was analyzed by applying a likelihood ratio test.

However, interaction terms were dropped when these led to sparse cells and unrealistic estimates. Multicollinearity was tested among screened variables in the multivariable logistic regression model by estimating the variance inflation factor (VIF). All variables with a VIF value of 10 or above were considered to indicate multicollinearity, assuming that this was not due to variable construction (e.g. interaction terms) [10].

But for FeLV, most studies did not find an association between sex and seropositivity [28,38] except for a single report [9]. The association between male sex and FIV infection has been primarily related to increased risk of infection transmission due to greater predisposition of males to exhibit territorial behaviour involving fighting. In this study, regression models included contrasts to compare the likelihood of seropositivity of FIV between intact and neutered male cats as well as between intact and spayed female cats. Although, compared to females, males were found to be more likely to test seropositive for FIV compared to FeLV, no significant differences were evident between intact and neutered cats for the same sex (Table 3 and 4). Various studies have reported an association between neutering and lower risk of infection of FIV and FeLV among domestic cats [8]. However, there are reports suggesting that neutering and spaying have no significant effect on the prevalence of FIV [27,39,40] and that such cats still retain territorial aggressiveness [39,40]. It should be noted that when a predictor is common to both FIV and FeLV, due to its inherent design, a case\u2013case study might not detect a difference between the two case groups. In other words, if neutering were significantly associated with both FIV and FeLV seropositivity, this study design would not detect it. Since a higher likelihood of seropositivity was found in intact compared to neutered cats when non-infected cats were included [1,7], it is possible that sterilization characteristics are not different between FIV and FeLV infected cats.",

In contrast, the relationship between outdoor exposure and FeLV infection is not very clear.",

Both viruses induce immunodeficiency, but FeLV is more rapidly pathogenic and its effects manifest sooner and include other disease conditions [26].

This contributes to more sick cats testing FeLV positive rather than FIV positive.",

For a detailed account of pros and cons of case-case studies in general the reader is referred to McCarthy and Giesecke [11]. This study entailed comparison of FIV seropositive cats to FeLV seropositive cats with regard to known risk factors and explored the strength of their effects between the two infections. Therefore, care should be taken before extrapolating results of this study to the general population with non-infected cats. The risk factors that are common to both comparison groups tend to be underestimated or unidentified in a case-case study [11,12]. Since the study does not include a disease-free population, the odds ratios can only be interpreted as the odds of exposure to one disease group (FIV) in reference to the other (FeLV), and do not provide the estimate of the association between a risk factor and disease in the general population [42,43].",
