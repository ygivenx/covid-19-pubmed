            "text": "Influenza viruses continue to pose pandemic and epidemic threats to the public. Infection of humans with the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus is associated with mortality in excess of 60% [1]. Fatal outcomes of H5N1 virus infections are associated with high viral load and hypercytokinemia [2]. Avian H9N2 Quail/HK/G1/97 (H9N2/G1) virus is one of the precursor viruses of the highly pathogenic H5N1/97 virus [3]. With the prevalent circulations of H9N2 virus in quail in southern China [4] and several zoonotic transmission cases [5\u20138], H9N2 virus may evolve into a human-adapted avian influenza virus with pandemic potential [9]. We have previously demonstrated that H5N1/97 virus hyperinduces tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha expression in primary monocyte-derived macrophages (PBMac), which is mediated by p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) [10]. Recent reports, including ours, showed that H9N2/G1 virus also hyperinduces proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines comparable to H5N1/97 [11,12]. However, the roles of p38MAPK and other MAPK family members in H9N2/G1-induced TNF-alpha expression in PBMac are still unclear.",

            "text": "MAPK signaling pathways play key roles in the induction of inflammatory reactions including production of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6. Since the uncontrolled cytokine productions can lead to detrimental effects to the host, activation of MAPK also induces the negative feedback mechanisms to regulate the immune responses. Hence, MAPK and phosphatases are key players in the regulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory responses in the host. Reports have shown that MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) and protein phosphatase type 2A (PP2A) are two well-known negative regulators of p38MAPK. MKP-1 deficient mice are susceptible to septic shock [13,14]. In response to lipopolysaccharide, macrophages from MKP-1 deficient mice show prolong activation of p38MAPK and enhanced production of TNF-alpha and IL-6 [15]. PP2A constitutes a large family of Ser/Thr phosphatases, which are involved in diverse cellular functions [16]. PP2A suppresses the activations of p38MAPK and the upstream kinases of MAPK signaling pathways [17\u201319]. It has been shown that viruses develop various strategies to target PP2A in order to counteract host antiviral responses [20]. However, the roles of MKP-1 and PP2A in cytokine regulation during influenza virus infections have not been reported. Here, we show that H9N2/G1 virus activated p38MAPK and hyperinduced production of TNF-alpha in PBMac when compared with H1N1 virus. Moreover, the phosphorylation levels of p38MAPK and subsequent TNF-alpha expression in H9N2/G1-infected macrophages were further increased by the treatment of a selective inhibitor of PP2A, okadaic acid (OA). Interestingly, OA also increased the levels of p38MAPK phosphorylation and TNF-alpha mRNA in H1N1-infected macrophages. These results provide insights into the complex mechanisms of MAPK-mediated cytokine production during influenza virus infections.",

In addition, H5N1-induced TNF-alpha expression is, in large part, mediated by the activation of p38MAPK [10]. To investigate the mechanisms of p38MAPK-mediated hyperinduction of TNF-alpha, we examined the kinetics of p38MAPK activation and TNF-alpha expression in PBMac infected with H9N2/G1 or H1N1 virus. PBMac were mock-treated or infected with H9N2/G1 or H1N1 at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 2. At indicated time points, total RNA of treated cells were harvested for examining the levels of TNF-alpha mRNA by using TaqMan Gene Expression Assay as previously reported [10]. The levels of TNF-alpha production in culture supernatants were measured by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Like H5N1 viruses, H9N2/G1 significantly increased TNF-alpha levels when compared with H1N1-infected PBMac (Figure 1A,B). We then examined the phosphorylation levels of p38MAPK, ERK1/2, and JNK in the H9N2/G1- or H1N1-infected PBMac by using Western blot analysis. H9N2/G1 activated p38MAPK and ERK1/2, but not JNK, from 1 to 2 h post-infection (h.p.i.) (Figure 1C, lanes 9\u201312) when compared with the mock-treated control (Figure 1C, lanes 1\u20134) or H1N1-infected PBMac (Figure 1C, lanes 5\u20138). Moreover, the levels of p38MAPK phosphorylations induced by H9N2/G1 were higher than those of ERK1/2 (Figure 1C, lane 11).",

The levels of TNF-alpha mRNA and protein were measured at 3 h.p.i. and 16 h.p.i., respectively. Notably, the levels of TNF-alpha mRNA and protein in H9N2/G1-infected PBMac were significantly suppressed by SB203580 and in a dose dependent manner (Figure 1D,E). The suppressive effect of SB203580 on the activities of p38MAPK was shown in supplementary figure (Figure S1A) and SB203580 did not show cytotoxic effects on the H9N2/G1-infected PBMac (Figure S1B). By examining the levels of influenza virus nucleoprotein using Western blot, we show that SB203580 did not affect the expression level of the viral protein suggesting that SB203580 did not interfere with H9N2/G1 infection (Figure S1C). To summarize, H9N2/G1 induced a significantly higher level of TNF-alpha when compared with the seasonal H1N1 and the hyperinduction was mediated through p38MAPK.",

Surprisingly, despite H9N2/G1 induced high level of p38MAPK phosphorylation, the PP2A activity was increased when compared with the mock-treated cells. The activity of PP2A induced by H9N2/G1 was abrogated by okadaic acid (OA), a selective PP2A inhibitor, at 25 nM (Figure 3A). OA is a reversible, non-competitive inhibitor of the serine/theorine protein phosphatases PP1 and PP2A [23]. However, OA inhibits PP2A activities at 1\u20132 nM whereas it inhibits PP1 above 1 \u03bcM in tissue extracts [24]. Meanwhile, cytotoxicity of OA in PBMac was examined (Figure S2). PBMac were treated with OA at the indicated concentrations and the survivals of treated cells were measured by MTT assay after incubating for 4 to 24 h.

We previously reported p38MAPK mediates, in part, the hyperinduction of TNF-alpha in primary human blood macrophages with H5N1/97 infection [10]. In the current study, we further investigate the negative regulatory mechanisms of p38MAPK-mediated hyperinduction of TNF-alpha in influenza virus infections. Our results show that H9N2/G1, like H5N1/97 virus, induced p38MAPK activation and high level of TNF-alpha production in macrophages when compared with the seasonal H1N1 virus. Moreover, H9N2/G1 induced the activation of PP2A but not MKP-1in the infected cells. With the treatment of PP2A inhibitor, the levels of p38MAPK activity and TNF-alpha production were enhanced suggesting PP2A plays a role in negative regulation of p38MAPK activation in H9N2/G1 infection. However, H9N2/G1 did not induce PP2A expression indicating that the activation of PP2A is not mediated by p38MAPK. On the other hand, PP2A may not be the targets of H9N2/G1 in the upstream of p38MAPK signaling pathways since H1N1 also induced PP2A activation in primary macrophages.",

At 2 h.p.i., the PP2A activity was quantified by using the PP2A Phosphatase Assay Kit (Millipore); (B) Left panel: Effects of OA on the p38MAPK phosphorylation. PBMac were treated with the indicated doses of OA for 30 min prior to H9N2/G1 infection. At 2 h.p.i., cell lysates were collected and the phosphorylation levels of p38MAPK were determined by using Western blot analysis. Representative figure of experiments from five independent blood donors is shown; Right panel: graphical presentation of the Western blot analysis. The densities of the protein bands were determined by using Bio-Rad Quantity One imaging software. Actin was used as a loading control. The band intensities of phosphorylated p38MAPK were normalized with those of actin. The numbers shown above the columns represent the normalized values; (C,D) Macrophages were treated with the indicated doses of OA for 30 min prior to H9N2/G1 infection. The TNF-alpha mRNA levels (C) and protein levels in culture supernatant (D) were measured by using quantitative RT-PCR and ELISA, respectively; (E) PBMac were treated with DMSO or 25 nM OA for 3 h. The total RNA samples were then harvested and the TNF-alpha levels were quantified by using quantitative RT-PCR. Experiments were performed by using blood from at least five independent donors. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01. h.p.i., hour post infection; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; DMSO, dimethylsulphoxide.",
