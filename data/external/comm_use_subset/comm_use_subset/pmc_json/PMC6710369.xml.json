Acute lung injury (ALI) induced by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in mice is a well-accepted model for investigating ARDS because it mimics the inflammatory and histological changes observed in this disease. In this model, LPS stimulates alveolar macrophages via the TLR4/CD14/MD2 complex and the MyD88-dependent response, and activates nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) that regulate the secretion of inflammatory mediators such as cytokines (e.g., IL-8, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6) (3). The secreted inflammatory mediators then trigger neutrophil infiltration into alveolar space (4). This intense inflammatory response is associated with ARDS exacerbation (5). Despite the advances in ARDS diagnosis and treatment in the last 5 years, treatment options are limited and no pharmacology treatments aimed at the underlying pathology have proven effective.",

The anti-inflammatory properties of pomegranate have been exploited in traditional medicine for the treatment of inflammatory disorders. We previously demonstrated that the hydroalcoholic extract of pomegranate leaves inhibits TNF-\u03b1 production and decreases neutrophil migration in a rat model of LPS-induced acute peritonitis (8). Additionally, the ethyl acetate fraction of the hydroalcoholic extract of pomegranate leaves was effective in treating LPS-induced ALI in mice (9). Some pharmacologically useful compounds, especially gallotannins, have been identified in the ethyl acetate fraction of pomegranate leaves (9). Galloyl-hexahydroxydiphenoyl (HHDP)-glucose identified in the ethyl acetate fraction is a hydrolysable tannin, shown to also be present in pomegranate juice, emblic leafflower fruits, and Eucalyptus globulus Labill bark (10, 11). However, its pharmacological activities remain undetermined.",

            "text": "In animal models, LPS-induced ALI mimics the inflammatory and histological changes observed in ARDS (15, 16). LPS stimulates acute inflammation through the activation of lung-resident macrophages, which in turn activate intracellular mediators (17). The transcription factor NF-\u03baB regulates innate and adaptive immune functions, and serves as a pivotal mediator of inflammatory responses (3). We observed that galloyl-HHDP-glucose blocked the activation of NF-\u03baB, thus, regulating lung inflammation. LPS-activated macrophages induces a phosphorylation of NF-\u03baB developing a proinflammatory profile by gene expressing and releasing cytokines as observed in animals with ALI (18). IKB (inhibitor of Kinase B) is a key factor in NF-\u03baB activation (19). Moreover, the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) is one of the IKK activators by different stimulis such as TLRs, IL-1\u03b2, TNF\u03b1, and others (19). Three main MAPKinase pathways have been described in mammalian cells: the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), the JNK pathway and the p38 MAPK pathway (20). JNK is activated in lung tissue of ARDS mice and its inhibition by specific inhibitors may significantly improve the pulmonary histopathology and lung permeability in rats (21). Reinforcing the importance of JNK in the modulation of inflammation in ALI, we showed that LPS activates JNK in lung and Galloyl-HHDP-glucose treatment is able to inhibits lung JNK phosphorylation similar to dexamethasone.",

In this study, we observed that galloyl-HHDP-glucose suppresses lung inflammation in the airways of mice intratracheally challenged with LPS. Moreover, this treatment attenuated the loss of weight induced by LPS suggesting that this treatment not only improve lung function but also reduced the systemic effects of LPS instillation. We showed the main therapeutic effect exhibited by Galloyl-HHDP-glucose was to reduce the cytokine production by suppressing NF-\u03baB and MAPKinase activation; these results strongly suggest that Galloyl-HHDP-glucose possesses potent anti-inflammatory actions in the lungs. Thus, we suggest that Galloyl-HHDP-glucose impairs the generation of these inflammatory mediators by interfering with these signaling pathways in leukocytes.",
