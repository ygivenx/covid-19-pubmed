While macrophages and dendritic cells have been identified in the nasal submucosa34, and neutrophils have been identified in the nasal cavity35, the immune cells present in NPAs have not been fully characterized. To phenotype NPA cells, previous researchers have relied on cell differential analysis of cytocentrifuge slides stained with haematoxylin and eosin.

            "text": "Natural killer cell activity is regulated through the balance of signals from inhibitory and activating receptors. The natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs) NKp46 (NCR1), NKp44 (NCR2), and NKp30 (NCR3), as well as NKG2D, are the main activating receptors involved in mediating NK cell function in health and disease18,19. The most overexpressed activating receptors we found in NK cells of NPAs were NKp44 (NCR2) and NKp46 (NCR1). This is consistent with Shemer-Avni et al.\u2019s findings41. In nasal lavage samples of patients infected with respiratory viruses, they found NKp46 as the most abundantly expressed NCR. However, in their RTqPCR analysis they detected no NKp44 expression and very little of NKp30. Altogether, our findings point to NKp44 as a key player in nasal mucosa elimination of virally infected cells by NK cells.",

To date, most studies of these infections in pediatric HSCT recipients have focused on symptomatic individuals, reporting an incidence of 5\u201311%46\u201348. Asymptomatic respiratory infections in children undergoing HSCT have been barely studied. A prospective study of 33 patients detected respiratory viruses in 24% of them before HSCT, mainly HRV and adenovirus49. In our series, infections caused by HRV were the most common, and were not associated with increased morbidity. These findings are in concordance with those reported by Srinivasan et al. in children with cancer or post-HSCT and upper or lower respiratory infection13 and asymptomatic children before HSCT49. Other authors have reported implementing routine extensive pre-HSCT lung screening, including bronchoalveolar lavage for the detection of viruses, bacteria and fungi. In that study, almost one third of asymptomatic patients had viral respiratory infections, mainly caused by rhinovirus, and none of these worsened during HSCT50. On the other hand, infections caused by adenovirus and parainfluenza virus were less frequent but more often symptomatic in our patients. Adenovirus has been described as a cause of lower respiratory tract infection with high mortality after HSCT in studies involving symptomatic children46,51. We did not find a correlation between viral infection and HSCT outcomes, which could be caused by small sample size and low incidence of symptomatic infection.",

Potential limitations of our study relate to sample size and losses to follow-up. NPA cell counts have great variability so larger cohorts would be desirable to draw stronger conclusions. Many patients did not tolerate well NPAs and withdrew during the course of the study. The small number of patients further precluded correlation of viral detection and transplantation outcomes, and limits our ability to examine the implications of asymptomatic viral respiratory infections in HSCT recipients. NPAs were collected up to 30 days after HSCT, and some infections occurring later may have been missed. However, most respiratory viral infections in HSCT recipients occur soon after transplantation, and adverse clinical outcomes are more likely to occur in the same period46,51.",
