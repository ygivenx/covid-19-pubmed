[1]. This elegant one pot reaction furnished the important intermediate 2,3-dioxo-5-arypyrroles which are required in our work. Depending on the substitution groups on the aromatic aldehyde used, this reaction will provide different 2,3-dioxo-5-arylpyrroles in reasonable to moderate yields. Particular attention has been made to these classes of compounds since some of the 2,3-dioxo-5-arylpyrroles were successfully converted to their respective 2,3-dioxo-5-arylpyrrolidinones [2]. These pyrrolidinones could be promising intermediates for preparing various synthetically challenging and medicinally important alkaloids such as codonopsinine, anisomycin and preussin [3,4,5]. ",

The synthetic versatility of hydrazine has led to the extensive use of this compound in organic synthesis. Although some chemistry of hydrazine and pyrrolidone reactions have been studied [10], to our knowledge reactions of 2,3-dioxo-5-arylpyrrolidinone with different hydrazine salts have not been reported before in open literature. Consequently, new 2,3-dioxo-5-arylpyrrolidinones have now been synthesized and their reactions with various hydrazines are currently being investigated. ",
