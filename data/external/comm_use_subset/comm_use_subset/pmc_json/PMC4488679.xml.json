Serum therapy was commonly used to treat infectious diseases until the discovery of chemotherapy in the form of sulfonamide in the 1930s [4]. Antibiotics were less expensive and difficult to use, had significantly fewer adverse effects, and were not pathogen-specific, rendering the diagnosis of the microbial infection unnecessary before treatment; thus, serum therapy was pushed aside. However, the emergence of multi-drug-resistant forms of new and old pathogens and the recent explosion of the immunocompromised population worldwide have led to a necessary resurgence in the development of antibody-based therapeutics to treat and prevent this new wave of drug-resistant infectious diseases [5]. Furthermore, whereas antimicrobial drugs can kill the microbes but cannot eradicate pre-formed toxins, a specific antibody is the only compound that can neutralize a given toxin [3]. Therefore, antibodies remain attractive for therapeutic purposes.",

First, treatments with hyperimmune equine- or other animal-derived antisera are associated with substantial side effects, including hypersensitivity-related reactions such as serum sickness and anaphylaxis [6,7]; in addition, the use of human antisera involves the risk of blood-borne disease [8]. These safety limitations can be addressed by using human-derived or humanized MAb-based preparations that display a substantially decreased incidence of side effects and viral contamination [9,10]. Humanization, the replacement of mouse constant regions and variable framework with human sequences, results in a product displaying significantly reduced immunogenicity and improved in vivo tolerability [11]. Human or humanized MAbs exhibiting enhanced pharmacokinetics enable the administration of a lower protein load and a reduced frequency of administration during the course of treatment. Second, PAb-based preparations exhibit significant batch-to-batch variability, and their supply is limited. In contrast, MAbs can be produced in vitro, thereby ensuring an unlimited supply of highly purified, well-characterized products that are devoid of contaminating proteins [8].",

All others were clinically designed for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune or allergic conditions [14]. Although many MAbs have been purified and characterized for their protective efficacy against different toxins [3], some of which are under investigation in clinical trials [7,15], PAbs remain almost the only available preparations for this indication. MAb-based therapy has some limitations. First, MAbs exhibit unprecedented specificity to their antigenic target, but this extreme specificity may hamper the efficacy of any individual MAb in the case of the absence or modification of its target epitope in a mutant or subtype of the infectious agent. Second, the potency of MAbs, especially those that play a role in the neutralization of pathogens and toxins, remains relatively low compared with PAb-based preparations. This inferior neutralizing potency of individual MAbs may be attributed to the differences in the functional impact of specific antigenic epitopes, to their low affinity to the target epitope, to the biochemical stability of each MAb molecule, or reduced clearance of the MAb-antigen immune-complexes (ICs). These two major limitations of individual MAb-based preparations, their low neutralizing potency and potential failure to treat mutants or subtypes, can be overcome by combining several MAbs to form a MAb cocktail. Moreover, as will be further discussed in details, recent studies show that such MAb cocktails exhibit synergistic neutralization; i.e., MAb cocktails display substantially elevated neutralizing activity that exceeds the level of improvement expected by the contribution of each MAb in the mixture. In fact, the neutralizing activity of MAb cocktails can be similar to the potency of PAb-based preparations.",

We not only simultaneously obtained neutralizing MAbs against different BoNTs in a single automated process but also successfully demonstrated significant synergistic neutralization by the combined anti-BoNT MAbs [16]. BoNTs, which serve as an excellent model for complex antigens against which MAbs are required, are produced by Clostridium botulinum strains and are considered the most lethal toxins identified, with an estimated human median lethal dose (HLD50) of 1 ng/kg body weight [17,18]. BoNTs are the only toxins classified by the CDC as category A agents [19]. However, the standard treatment for botulism relies on equine or limited amounts of human PAb-based antitoxin therapy, together with supportive care [20]. Thus, there is a need for safe and reliable anti-BoNT MAb-based pharmaceutical drugs.",

Such a combination may facilitate the binding of multiple IgG molecules to the target toxin, thus potentially blocking various essential functional domains.

In a study in 2012, Chen et al. predicted that two MAbs, which recognized the protein and the ganglioside receptor binding domains, respectively, synergistically neutralized BoNTs. In this study, the investigators selected three neutralizing MAbs that recognized different non-overlapping epitopes of BoNT/B and compared the neutralizing effects of various antibody combinations. They found that a MAb that responded to the ganglioside receptor binding site synergized with the other two MAbs that recognized non-overlapping epitopes in Syt II (the protein receptor). However, the combination of the latter two MAbs did not exert a synergistic effect [30]. This example demonstrates that the combination of two MAbs that recognize distinct functional domains on BoNTs may represent the general principle for a potent synergistic effect. Interestingly, Chen et al. further analyzed the results generated by the lab of James Marks [22], which developed MAbs for BoNT/A. They found that the neutralizing potency of one pair of MAbs (C25 + 3D12), which bind to the translocation domain and the sialoganglioside binding domain, respectively, was 10 times higher than that of another pair (S25 + 3D12), whose epitopes are located at the same functional domain. This finding provides additional evidence that a combination of MAbs that recognize different functional domains is more likely to synergize than a combination of MAbs recognizing the same functional domain [30].",

Hu et al. generated four MAbs directed against the RTB subunit and found that all of them bound to conformational epitopes with a high affinity. When testing pairs of MAbs, they demonstrated a synergistic neutralization of ricin in vitro and in vivo. Hu et al. hypothesized that because the two RTB domains are homologous and are structurally similar, a single RTB-specific MAb may block both galactose binding pockets by binding to similar conformational epitopes sharing both domains and that the simultaneous binding of two MAbs likely synergistically interferes with ricin attachment to cells. In addition, the authors speculated that MAbs might bind to domains that interrupt the transport of RTA from the ER to the cytosol. They also determined that the synergistic effect of the MAb pairs depended on different ricin neutralization activities that were more related with their epitope specificities than their ricin-binding affinities and that were not related to their antibody isotypes [34]. In another ricin study, McGuiness et al. identified and characterized a murine IgG1 anti-RTB MAb (24B11). Using a Vero cell cytotoxicity assay, they compared 24B11 with a known anti-RTA MAb (R70) and found that 24B11 was approximately two-fold more effective at neutralizing ricin. The investigators studied the mechanism of action of these two MAbs and found that both 24B11 and R70 blocked ricin attachment to galactoside receptors, although R70 was directed against RTA [32].",

In one pioneering study of MAb combinations against toxins, Volk et al. evaluated the effect of MAbs on different TeNT subunits and found that all neutralizing MAbs bound to epitopes on the HC of TeNT (approximately half of them to the C-terminal region and half to the N-terminal region). When combining these MAbs, it was found that different cocktails of 2\u20134 MAbs exerted synergistic neutralization in vivo, resulting in up to 200-fold greater protection than the individual neutralizing MAbs.

For instance, Cheng et al. demonstrated that a combination of two MAbs, one directed against the LC (catalytic domain) of BoNT/A, and the other directed against the translocation domain, did not inhibit endopeptidase activity but, instead, blocked toxin entry into primary and cultured neuronal cells in a synergistic manner.

Similar to other superantigens, SEB simultaneously binds to major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) molecules on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and to T-cell receptors (TCRs) that incorporate V chains [50]. Blocking antibodies may prevent SEB from facilitating the formation of the MHC-II/SEB/TCR complex, thereby inhibiting this toxin. According to the crystal structures of complexes consisting of SEB and MHC-II or TCR, the two binding sites are spatially distinct from the contact areas [76]. Varshney et al. generated MAbs against SEB and evaluated different pairs of MAbs in which only one or none of the MAbs individually protected against SEB toxicity. The authors reported that protection was achieved when these MAb combinations were administered simultaneously. In fact, this was the first report in which enhanced protection against SEB-induced lethal shock (SEBILS) was demonstrated in mice by the combination of two individually non-neutralizing MAbs. These MAbs recognized non-continuous residues that likely contribute to conformational epitopes [50].",

In accordance with the putative synergistic mechanism, the most potent neutralization of triple combinations evaluated was attained using three MAbs directed against three different domains, one each on V3, gp41, and gp120. The authors further evaluated a combination of four MAbs (the previous three MAbs and one that recognized the CD4 binding site) and found higher neutralization potency and a higher degree of synergy than any of the triple combinations [77]. Similarly, Meulen et al. presented experimental animal data showing that protection against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection was feasible using a mixture of two human MAbs (CR3014 and CR3022). This MAb combination neutralized SARS-CoV in a synergistic manner by recognizing different epitopes on the receptor-binding domain. [78].",

Although the MAbs recognized two overlapping epitopes that were part of the hFH binding site on the N-terminus of the hFBP, they did not elicit complement mediated bactericidal activity against MenB, when tested either individually or in combination. Interestingly, when tested in combination with another MAb, that recognized a conformational epitope located on the C-terminus\u2014opposite to the hFH binding site, the two MAb combinations exerted different levels of synergistic activity, depending on the orientation of the MAbs on fHBP. The authors suspected that while the concomitant binding of one combination may result in a reciprocal orientation suitable for correct engagement of C1q, the relative position of the other combination might not be optimal to promote the same effect [79].",

Thus, one can easily conceive that adherence to the toxin would be more efficacious if the binding of the antibody to its epitope were stronger, thus prolonging the duration that this epitope is \u2018occupied\u2019, leading to more potent inhibition and clearance from the bloodstream. There are several indications that the neutralizing activity of antibodies is associated with their affinity to the target epitope. Indeed, in vivo assays conducted in our lab revealed that the neutralizing potency of MAbs against the three different BoNTs was associated with an increased affinity to the toxin, as all neutralizing MAbs exhibited the highest anti-toxin ELISA titer [16]. Pless et al. also reported that a common characteristic of all anti-BoNT/A-Hc neutralizing MAbs examined was a very high affinity [81]. In another anti-BoNT study, Amersdorfer et al. showed that the most potent anti-Hc scFv displayed the highest affinity for its epitope [82]. In accordance with this concept, Maynard et al. showed that the protection against anthrax toxin by recombinant antibody fragments was correlated with antigen affinity [83]. Likewise, Scott characterized a panel of anti-tetanus toxin scFvs and found that 14/15 clones neutralized toxin activity based on a ganglioside binding assay and that this effect was strongly related to the affinity of these clones [84].",

Affinity, a measure of the strength of the noncovalent interaction between an antibody and its antigen [85], is mathematically represented by the equilibrium constant (K) that characterizes the reversible binding of an antibody to an epitope on an antigen [86]. Affinity can be divided into \u2018intrinsic\u2019 and \u2018functional\u2019. The term \u2018intrinsic affinity\u2019 characterizes systems involving monovalent interactions between one paratope and one epitope, while the term \u2018functional affinity\u2019, also known as \u2018avidity\u2019, refers to higher order complexes between bivalent or multivalent Abs and a number of binding sites per antigen [87], and reflects the intrinsic affinity, the valence and the topological relationship between the antigenic determinants and the antibody combining sites [88]. The strength of multivalent interactions (functional affinity or avidity), usually exceeds, sometimes greatly, the corresponding intrinsic affinity [85,86]. Multivalent linkages within ICs can be formed between either the same epitope expressed on separate antigens and Ab molecules of the same specificity (MAb), or between diverse epitopes and Abs with two or more specificities (such as in the case of natural immune reactions), which may have cooperative interactions between them, eventually leading to increase in the functional affinity.",

            "text": "Two basic mechanisms may underlie such cooperative interactions between MAbs that bind to diverse epitopes. First, the binding of one bivalent MAb to two epitopes on two soluble antigens, thereby facilitating their cross-linking, increases the probability that a second MAb, specific for an independent epitope, could bind to two sites instead of to only one site [85]. This phenomenon was demonstrated 30 years ago by Moyle et al. for antibodies against human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). The authors found that some MAb pairs but not others displayed a higher affinity to the hormone than either MAb alone and that this increased affinity was associated with the formation of a stable circular complex consisting of two antibody molecules (each one of the two MAbs) and two hCG molecules [89]. Second, the increase in functional affinity observed for multiple MAbs may be due to a conformational change in the antigen that occurs upon the binding of the first MAb, resulting in a higher affinity of the second and third MAbs [22,85] (illustrated in Figure 3). Thus, the binding of the first antibody might induce a more stable conformation of the antigen that thermodynamically or entropically favors the binding of a subsequent antibody [84,85].",

Significant synergy in toxin neutralization was detected for pairs of MAbs compared with each individual MAb in vitro (mouse hemidiaphragm assay) based on a significant increase in the time to neuroparalysis. The authors further showed that a large increase in the affinity of the MAb cocktail likely resulted in increased toxin neutralization potency. This result was demonstrated by determining the functional binding affinities for each single MAb, each pair of MAbs, and the mixture of all three MAbs. Strikingly, when one MAb (C25) was mixed with a second MAb (3D12), the resulting affinity of the MAb combination was 200- and 10-fold higher than the individual MAbs alone, respectively. The equimolar cocktail of all three MAbs (addition of MAb S25 to the other two) further increased the affinity by 4-fold. Interestingly, the affinity of the pair of MAbs C25 and S25 was only 2-fold higher that the single MAb affinities, and this pair was less potent in vivo compared with the other pair consisting of MAbs C25 and 3D12. Moreover, the magnitude of the increase in the in vivo neutralization potency of the different MAb combinations paralleled the increase in functional affinity. Thus, the neutralization potency of individual MAbs and mixtures of MAbs could be predicted based on the equilibrium binding equation according to the affinity data alone. The authors reported a synergistic effect resulting in a more than 20,000-fold increase in potency for the three-MAb combination compared with any individual MAb [22].",

Generally, the clearance of ICs following a polyclonal response occurs via two pathways, both of which involve antibody Fc. One clearing mechanism is mediated by Fc\u03b3-receptor (Fc\u03b3R) binding. The second mechanism is mediated by the complement system, which plays a crucial role in IC handling [96]. These two mechanisms can act independently [97]. Thus, antibody Fc-mediated clearance is thought to play an important role in toxin neutralization, as well. Accordingly, it has been demonstrated that the association between PAbs and BoNT leads to enhanced clearance from the circulation of rats, particularly to the liver and spleen [98].",

For instance, Fc substantially contributes to IgG stabilization in the bloodstream primarily due to protection by the neonatal FcR (FcRn). FcRn plays a critical role in regulating the levels of circulating IgGs in rodents and higher species via strict pH-dependent IgG/FcRn binding [99]. The FcRn-bound antibody is thought to be protected from degradation, thereby increasing the half-life of IgG in serum. Therefore, the use of antitoxin agents that do not bear Fc (such as Fab, scFv, etc.) and thus display a shorter half-life than intact IgG would be expected to exhibit reduced efficacy due to a rapid decrease in the concentration of the antitoxin agent in the bloodstream, as demonstrated by BoNT toxicity studies [22,70]. Nevertheless, in addition to the inferior potency of the F(ab')2 antitoxin, Mazuet et al. showed that in spite of its shorter half-life (10-fold), one F(ab')2 retained its neutralization efficacy compared with intact IgG. Interestingly, the MAb that was not affected by Fc deletion displayed a much higher affinity than the other MAb [70].",

This protection suggests that a high dose of F(ab')2 may compensate for the lack of Fc-mediated mechanisms and may induce neutralization solely via toxin blocking. Furthermore, it is plausible that the addition of human Fc fragment to the equine F(ab')2 preparation would improve antitoxin efficacy and reduce the total amount of foreign protein administered to a patient. However, such manipulation is not applicable for polyclonal preparations and may be difficult to evaluate in animal models due to the variance in Fc\u03b3Rs and complement receptors (CRs) among species. Manipulation of Fc fragments is being performed on MAbs, enabling the examination of the role of Fc in neutralization in vivo. Recently, the generation and characterization of an Fc\u03b3R-humanized mouse that lacks all murine Fc\u03b3Rs was described; this model may enable the accurate prediction of the consequences of linking human Fc\u03b3Rs to IgGs for a particular biological response [100]. Recapitulation of the human-specific Fc\u03b3R expression pattern in this mouse model was used recently to assess the activity of anti-anthrax toxin MAbs containing specific Fc variants that selectively enhanced their affinity for particular human Fc\u03b3Rs [101].",

Vitale et al. showed that F(ab')2 fragments of an anti-PA MAb were 10- to 100-fold less potent than the complete IgG in neutralizing anthrax toxin in vitro, even though they retained equivalent affinity for PA. The addition of FcR-blocking antibodies greatly reduced the activity of this MAb, and the neutralizing activity of mouse, rabbit, and human antisera elicited by PA vaccines was effectively abrogated by blocking FcRs. However, in vivo, significantly higher concentrations of F(ab')2 did protect against anthrax toxin cytotoxicity; thus, in vivo protection cannot be unambiguously attributed to the Fc-enhanced neutralization activity [102]. It is unclear whether this potency reduction in vivo is also attributed to the shorter half-life of the F(ab')2 fragments. This neutralizing activity was abrogated by FcR blockers for PAb and MAb treatment, implying that their potency is indeed FcR-dependent. Experiments conducted by Arturo Casadevall and colleagues have broadened our understanding of the function of Fc in anti-PA antibodies [103]. Abboud et al. generated identical variable regions and specific IgG2a and IgG2b variants of an IgG1 anti-PA MAb and found that the efficacy of antibody-mediated neutralization was dependent on the isotype and that this neutralization activity required a competent Fc\u03b3R. Furthermore, they showed that the IgG2a MAb prevented lethal toxin cytotoxicity more efficiently than the IgG1 MAb and that passive immunization with IgG1 and IgG2a MAb protected wild-type, but not Fc\u03b3R-deficient, mice against B. anthracis infection [103]. Nevertheless, the precise toxin neutralization mechanism after Fc\u03b3R engagement was unclear. The authors hypothesized that MAb PA-Fc\u03b3Rs ICs are endocytosed and sorted to lysosomes for degradation but suggested that the differences in efficacy between the isotypes implied a difference in Fc-mediated effector functions rather than defective endocytosis in mice deficient in Fc\u03b3Rs.",

Sepuldeva et al. proposed a novel concept in which BoNT neutralization is exerted by combinations of high-affinity epitope-tagged scFvs against BoNT/A, serving as the \u2018blocking\u2019 arm, and anti-tag MAbs containing Fc, serving as the \u2018clearing Fc\u2019 arm. In this manner, the investigators elegantly illuminated the critical contribution of Fc-mediated clearance of BoNTs to synergistic neutralization and dissected the function of Fc from other putative mechanisms. The authors showed that for individual non-neutralizing scFvs, the addition of additional clearing Fcs synergistically increased the level of protection against BoNT/A. Thus, when an scFv contained two copies of the tag (i.e., two \u2018clearing Fcs\u2019 for each \u2018blocking arm\u2019) instead of one, protection against the toxin was approximately 10-fold enhanced, approximately the same fold-change as the addition of a different scFv. The improvement achieved by the inclusion of an additional tag likely resulted from further Fc decoration of the toxin. Following that study, the definitive role of Fc-mediated clearance in synergistic activity was demonstrated by pharmacokinetic studies showing that BoNT/A was rapidly cleared from the sera of mice administered a pool of anti-BoNT/A scFvs and a clearing Fc but not from the sera of mice administered either the scFvs or the clearing Fc alone. Moreover, the efficacy and clearance profile of this mixture of a neutralizing dose of scFvs combined with an anti-tag clearing Fc was comparable to that of a polyclonal antitoxin serum [24].",

The authors generated small (12 kDa) and stable camelid heavy-chain-only Ab VH (VHH) domains against BoNT/A. These VHHs were used as antitoxins via the co-administration of recombinant high-affinity anti-BoNT tagged VHH and an anti-tag clearing Fc. The authors compared neutralizing or non-neutralizing binding VHHs administered with or without clearing Fc to evaluate the relative contributions of toxin blocking and clearance to antitoxin activity. A cocktail of up to three VHHs, each containing one tag, administered with an anti-tag clearing Fc was insufficient to induce efficient clearance. However, a heterodimer consisting of two non-neutralizing monomeric VHH units, each containing two tags instead of one, enabled the simultaneous binding of four Fc domains to the toxin. The resulting toxin clearance dramatically enhanced the protection of mice from virtually no protection in the absence of the clearing Fc to complete protection against 1000 MsLD50 of BoNT/A. Furthermore, a comparison of the antitoxin efficacy between neutralizing and non-neutralizing VHH agents in the presence or absence of the anti-tag clearing Fc revealed that the neutralizing VHHs were highly effective in the absence of clearance (and were improved in the presence of the clearing Fc), whereas non-neutralizing VHHs depended on the clearing Fc for efficient neutralization [23].",

Vance et al. showed that on one hand, the addition of a clearing Fc agent to double-tagged VHH heterodimers (enabling up to four Fc molecules to decorate each toxin molecule) significantly increased the protection of mice from ricin toxicity, likely via the promotion of toxin clearance [106]. On the other hand, the presence or absence of an anti-tag clearing Fc linked to a high affinity heterodimer consisting of two non-neutralizing VHHs afforded the mice no protection against ricin challenge. Because ricin is toxic to all cell types and preferentially targets macrophages, including Kuppfer cells in the liver [68], the authors postulated that the accelerated Fc\u03b3R-mediated clearance of ricin in the absence of the inhibition of functional ricin domains may not improve the clinical results and might even enhance its toxicity [106].",

            "text": "The significance of Fc valence for toxin clearance from the circulation was recently shown using red blood cells (RBCs) mediated toxin sequestration [28]. Opsonization of particulate pathogens by antibodies and complement can lead to their binding to the complement receptor1 (CR1), specific for C3b, on primate erythrocytes. This immune adherence may prevent pathogens from leaving the bloodstream and facilitate their destruction by liver macrophages [107]. Ronald Taylor and colleagues used MAbs specific for CR1 cross-linked with pathogen specific MAbs to generate heteropolymers (HPs) which can bind a wide range of substrates to primate erythrocytes, and imitate the natural clearance mechanism of C3b-opsonized substrates bound to erythrocyte CR1. In this way, Fc receptors on the phagocytic cell engage the erythrocyte-bound complex, CR1 is removed by proteolysis, and the entire immune complex and CR1 are internalized while sparing the erythrocyte [107]. The HP methodology was recently applied by Sharma et al. that used BoNT as a model system in an attempt to enhance toxin rather than particulate pathogen neutralization. They converted a pair of BoNT specific MAbs into HPs and tested them in transgenic mice expressing human CR1 on RBC membranes. The authors reported that two HPs given in combination had 166-fold greater potency than un-modified MAbs, capable of neutralizing 5000 MsLD50 BoNT/A. The ICs formed with an HP and an un-modified MAb were less potent than those formed with two HPs. In addition, peritoneal macrophages internalized BoNT better when it was bound to two HPs rather than to an HP + MAb or MAb + MAb combination, independent of whether the HP pair contained a CR1-binding or nonbinding control MAb. This may indicate that enhanced BoNT clearance from the blood circulation by fixed tissue macrophages is attributed to the opsonization of multiple Fc domains in the HP complexes [28].",

Until recently, this option was difficult to implement due to regulatory and cost concerns [47]. Nevertheless, efforts in recent years to produce effective MAb cocktails for post-exposure rabies and botulinum prophylaxis [15,108] have established an important precedent by increasing the relevance of the use of MAb combinations against toxins and infectious diseases.",

In this review, we described a body of evidence supporting three potential mechanisms underlying synergistic neutralization by MAb combinations: (1) the simultaneous binding of interfering MAbs to multiple functional sites of the toxin, facilitating the significant blockade of two or more essential epitopes that react with the target cell, thus dramatically reducing the potency of the toxin; (2) a dramatic increase in the affinity of the combination of MAbs compared with each MAb component, correlating with neutralization; and (3) Fc-mediated clearance of antibody-toxin ICs from the serum, which is enhanced by the multimeric antibody Fc decoration of the toxin. It is plausible that these three mechanisms complement each other and that the combination of these mechanisms mediates the enhanced cooperative activity of MAb cocktails.",

Low-affinity FcRs on resident macrophages bind to antibody-antigen complexes with a high avidity but do not bind to monomeric antibody-antigen ICs at a detectable affinity. In addition, larger IgG-toxin ICs are much more efficiently cleared from the bloodstream. Thus, a MAb cocktail might mimic a polyclonal reaction by forming large ICs with multiple Fc toxin decoration, resulting in a substantial enhanced antibody-toxin complexes clearance. The figure illustrates binding of multiple Fcs with high avidity to FcRs (b), as opposed to low affinity binding of a single MAb Fc (a).",
