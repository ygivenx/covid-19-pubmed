CVB3 infection may lead to acute heart failure and sudden death due to direct cytopathic effects induced by viral replication in the early phase of infection [1, 2]. Virus elimination from vital organs is considered as a key therapeutic strategy to treat CVB3-associated diseases. However, currently available drugs for the treatment of CVB3 infection are broad-spectrum antiviral drugs with limited efficacy [3\u20135]. Therefore, understanding of the mechanisms involved in CVB3 infection may provide new clues for developing novel therapeutic strategies against CVB3-induced diseases.",

Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that numerous viruses, including CVB3, activate the p38 MAPK subfamily to facilitate inflammatory responses, apoptosis, and viral replication in infected cells [7\u201311]. The p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 suppresses CVB3-induced Hela cell apoptosis and viral progeny release, suggesting that the p38 MAPK signaling is essential for cytopathic effects and life cycle of CVB3 in infected cells [12]. Pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK phosphorylation has been shown to effectively suppress CVB3 replication and release both in vitro and in vivo [5, 13]. In addition, MAP2K3 is one of the direct upstream activators of p38 MAPK [14]. At 48 and 72 h post human cytomegalovirus infection, increased activity of MAP2K3 is critical to maintain p38 activation, which is necessary for viral DNA replication [15]. Therefore, targeting the MAP2K3/p38 MAPK signaling would be a promising therapeutic approach against CVB3 infection.",

Previous reports have demonstrated that many viruses encode miRNAs or exploit host miRNAs to modulate host and/or viral gene expression. For example, Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus can encode 12 miRNA precursors, which generate 25 mature miRNAs. Some of them share seed sequences with host miRNAs, targeting host mRNAs involved in immune responses [17, 18]. In addition, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) induces miRNA-29a that specifically targets HIV-1 3\u2032UTR in infected cells to modulate its own life cycle [19]. Based on miRNA-mediated host-virus interactions, using miRNAs to target mechanisms that promote viral infection and replication is an emerging and promising antiviral strategy. Its feasibility has been demonstrated in several studies, such as miR-130a-mediated suppression of pyruvate kinase in liver and red blood cells inhibits pyruvate production, which is critical for hepatitis B and C virus replication [20], and the mimics of miR-124, miR-24, and miR-744 that target the p38 MAPK signaling exhibit antiviral effects in both influenza and respiratory syncytial virus infection [21].",

We infected HeLa cells with CVB3 at MOI = 10 and assessed miRNA-21 levels post infection. Real-time PCR results confirmed that miRNA-21 was increased after CVB3 infection, with approximately almost 15-fold at 12 h (Fig. 1a). CVB3 infection in HeLa cells leads to activation of P38 MAPK, which is downstream of MAP2K3 [12, 13]. To determine whether CVB3 induced miRNA-21 upregulation could affect MAP2K3 levels, we examined continuous changes of MAP2K3 expression upon CVB3 infection. MAP2K3 was upregulated significantly 1 h post CVB infection and sustained at high levels 7 h post infection, however, the expression level dropped at 12 h (Fig. 1b), which seems to be the result of high level of miRNA-21 and in line with our previous in vivo result [22]. To further assess the effects of CVB3 on associated P38MAPK pathways, we examined phosphorylation of P38 MAPK (P-P38) and phosphorylation of heat shock protein 27 (P-HSP27), which is a downstream substrate of p38 MAPK pathway and found the expression of P-P38 and P-HSP27 were almost in accordance with MAP2K3, both of them had high levels at 2\u20137 h while decreased at 12 h (Fig. 1b).\n",

As shown in Fig. 4c, CVB3 infection caused a dramatic increase in the caspase-3 activity in miR-CON-transfected cells compared with sham infection in a time-dependent manner, suggesting that CVB3 might induce apoptosis in infected cells. Importantly, miRNA-21 could significantly reverse the inductive effect of CVB3 on caspase-3 activation compared with miR-CON. Apoptosis related Cleaved-caspase 3 and Bax expression 12 h post infection were also detected and were found decreased in the miRNA-21 treated group, we further assayed apoptosis rate by Annexin V-FITC/PI staining assay and found miRNA-21 could inhibit apoptosis rate compared with control-group, Fig. 4d, e. These results suggested a potential protective role of miRNA-21 against CVB3-induced apoptosis in infected cells. Indeed, miRNA-21 showed no effect on the proliferation of uninfected Hela cells while significantly promoting the proliferation in CVB3-infected cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 4f, g), indicating that miRNA-21 may protect infected cells against CVB3-induced apoptosis, which further improves cell survival. Taken together, these results suggest that the inhibition of CVB3 release from miRNA-21-overexpressing cells is likely attributed to miRNA-21-exerted protection against CVB3-induced apoptosis at least in the early phases of infection.",

A previous study showed that overexpression of antiapoptotic proteins or treatment with a general caspase inhibitor prevents CVB3 virus progeny release at 10 h following infection, indicating that host cell apoptosis facilitates progeny release from infected cells [33].
