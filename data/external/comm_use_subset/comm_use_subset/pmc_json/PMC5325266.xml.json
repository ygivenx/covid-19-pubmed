It was found in several studies that vitamin A deficiency is associated with a higher risk of asthma [5\u20137], but randomized trials with vitamin A supplementation were less supportive [8, 9]. Prospective studies have shown that vitamin D supplementation reduces the risk of recurrent respiratory infections, virus-induced wheezing and asthma exacerbations although some of the studies have shown conflicting results [10\u201314]. Vitamin D is known to induce antimicrobial peptide LL-37, which has anti-viral, -bacterial and -fungal effects [15]. Maternal vitamin E intake during pregnancy has been negatively associated with wheezing and eczema in children of atopic mothers [16, 17].",

Animal sensitization was defined as positive IgE antibodies to cat, dog, horse or Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus. Birch, mugwort, timothy and Cladosporium herbarum were considered as pollen aeroallergens.

Correlations were calculated using Spearman rank-order correlations coefficients due to mainly skewed distributions. The associations of serum levels of vitamins and LL-37, allergy status and virus detection with intratonsillar cytokine and transcription factor expressions were analyzed using univariable and age-adjusted linear regression. The modifying effects of age (<16 vs. \u226516 years) and indication of tonsillectomy (recurrent tonsillitis vs. hypertrophic tonsils) on the associations were also examined. Analyses were also adjusted for smoking. Before analyses, vitamin D and LL-37 levels and gene expression values were log transformed because of positively skewed distributions. Statistical significance was established at the level of P < 0.05. Statistical analyses were done using SAS System for Windows (Version 9.4, SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC, USA).",

It is generally accepted that, low or deficient innate and adaptive immune responses may contribute to the morbidity of viral infections [25]. We show that multiple viruses exist in nasopharynx and tonsils in relatively asymptomatic patients. Less vitamin A was associated with less IFN-\u03b3 and tendency for more viral detection, which may partly explain the association previously seen with vitamin A deficiency and asthma exacerbations [1]. The inverse association between vitamin A levels and virus detection in our study is interesting since multiple observational studies have shown that vitamin A deficiency is associated with a higher risk of asthma and wheezing [5\u20137, 26, 27]. Vitamin A has been shown to enhance Treg activity via FOXP3 and inhibit Th17 development via retinoid orphan receptor \u03b3t (ROR\u03b3t) [28\u201331], but we did not find any significant association between serum vitamin A levels and intratonsillar antiviral/immunoregulatory gene expression, except for IFN-\u03b3.

Even though multiple studies suggest that vitamin D has beneficial effects on the immune defense and on allergic disease, the exact mechanisms are not well defined. Our finding of the positive association with higher vitamin D status and higher intratonsillar expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-37 might partly explain some of these results.

LL-37 is not only an endogenous antibiotic peptide that destroy bacteria, virus and fungi, but can also act as an immune modulator [40]. We found that higher serum LL-37 levels were associated with lower intratonsillar expression of IL-17 and its transcription factor RORC2, both needed to Th17 cell development [41], as well as lower expression of FOXP3, a transcription factor known to induce Treg cells [41, 42]. In our study cohort, serum LL-37 levels tended to increase with vitamin D levels, but this correlation did not reached statistical significance (S2 Fig). Our patients did not have acute infection at the time of operation and collection of blood samples. It might be that without acute infection, serum LL-37 levels are not elevated. This data may suggest that a critical balance appear to lie between LL-37 expression due to infections and Th17 and Treg cell development.",
