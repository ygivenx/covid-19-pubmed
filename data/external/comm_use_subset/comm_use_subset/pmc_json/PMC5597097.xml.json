            "text": "As malaria incidence continues to decrease throughout the tropics, a new area of research has focused on identifying etiologies of non-malaria, acute febrile illness (AFI) [1, 2]. Knowledge is limited in this area, in large part because AFIs often have similar non-specific clinical presentations early in the clinical course when most patients are likely to present for care. In addition, rapid point-of-care diagnostics are often not readily available. Surveillance for AFIs, if done, is largely passive and relies on clinical identification of cases and voluntary case reporting. Therefore, burden of disease for the etiologic agents of AFI are likely underestimated. An improved understanding of the major causes of AFI is important to guide clinical management, develop diagnostics, inform public health policy, and direct prevention efforts [3].",

In the last four decades, dengue, a mosquito-borne AFI caused by four genetically distinct dengue viruses (DENV 1\u20134), has become an increasingly common cause of AFI [4, 5]. The burden of dengue is thought to be less in Latin America than in Southeast Asia [6]; however, several studies have found that the incidence of dengue is likely underestimated in Latin America due to reliance on passive case surveillance [6\u20138]. Understanding region-specific etiologies of AFI and estimating the true incidence of dengue is necessary to plan large scale interventional trials for assessing the impact of mosquito control measures and vaccines. In addition, collecting clinical signs and symptoms from AFI patients of all ages with identified etiologic agents has utility in developing unbiased case definitions and identifying early clinical predictors to guide clinical management.",

Since 2000, nine such studies have evaluated AFIs including dengue among both pediatric and adult patients [9\u201318]. While these studies are comparable in many ways, the studies differ in that several excluded either infants and young children [9\u201313, 16], older adults [12, 13], severe or hospitalized cases [13, 16], or cases with a known source of fever [9\u201312, 14]. In addition, most studies were conducted in low resource settings in Southeast Asia where malaria is still endemic [9, 10, 12\u201318]. In fact, two studies enrolled based on a potential participant meeting national eligibility criteria for malaria testing [12, 13], and two other studies excluded cases based on malaria blood smear positivity [14, 15].",

Clinical and laboratory features were compared by sex, age group, and laboratory diagnostic groups including infection with DENV, FLU A/B, ORV, and CHIKV. Differences in proportions were tested by applying the chi-square test, and medians were compared using the Mann-Whitney-Wilcox test. Bonferroni correction was used to account for simultaneous multiple comparisons. The Woolf test was performed to evaluate the homogeneity of odds ratio across DPO group for death among adult participants by sex, and the Mantel-Haenzel test was used to determine significance. Multiple imputation was used to predict an independent plausible value for missing values using generalized linear regression on non-missing variables to create 40 imputed complete data sets [33]. To identify predictors of laboratory-positive dengue as compared to all other AFI cases, stepwise Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) variable selection was used for each imputed data set. Variables retained at least once in the 40 models were included in a pooled logistic regression model [34]. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for significant early (<3 DPO) and late (3\u20135 DPO) predictors. Data were analyzed using the \u201cmi\u201d and \u201cMASS\u201d packages from R software (V3.3.0, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).",

            "text": "While DENV was not as commonly identified as CHIKV or FLU A/B, participants with dengue were more likely to be admitted to the hospital at enrollment. The proportion of AFI cases with dengue in our study was comparable to other recent studies which found 4\u20139% of AFI cases had dengue [9\u201313, 15\u201318]. One exception to this was a study that found 34% of AFI patients had dengue; however, the study\u2019s eligibility criteria likely enhanced enrollment of dengue cases [14]. In our study, dengue incidence varied by age group with a nearly a 10-fold difference between participants <5 years old and 10\u201319 years old (3% versus 27%), which may be due to differences in likelihood of seeking medical care in primary versus secondary DENV infections [35]. Of note, 6% of participants \u226565 years old had dengue as a cause of AFI, a finding comparable to a Puerto Rico study in which 5% of 17,666 laboratory-positive dengue cases detected by surveillance were \u226565 years old [36]. In contrast, other recent prospective studies [37, 38] and a cross-sectional serosurvey [39] conducted in other dengue endemic countries found few, if any, symptomatic dengue cases among older participants. Whether this is due to a lower force of infection in Puerto Rico, immunosenescence, evolution of genotypes/strains of DENV, differences in prevalence of underlying chronic disease or health care seeking behavior in Puerto Rico, or lack of life-long homotypic immunity is not known [40\u201342]. However, DENV-1 has been in circulation in Puerto Rico since the 1970s and involved in every major outbreak since [35, 43].",

These cases were older individuals (>75 years old) who had underlying co-morbidities which may have complicated their clinical course. Nonetheless, since autopsy was not performed for either case, ascertaining whether CHIKV infection played a role in either fatality is difficult. However, in our study chikungunya was disproportionally identified among older participants, with positivity increasing from <10% of pre-school aged children to about one-third of participants \u226550 years old. This pattern of disease has been seen in other areas with recent CHIKV emergence [18], and may be due to older individuals having an increased likelihood of complications due to preexisting co-morbidities [44, 45].",

            "text": "Co-infections confirmed by molecular assays were detected among 1% of our participants, most commonly involving enteroviral or ORV infections; less than one-third of all co-infections included a DENV or CHIKV infection. Another recent prospective study found that 1% of AFI participants had co-infections involving molecularly diagnosed dengue or influenza, malaria, and positive blood culture [9]. Interestingly, we did not detect any co-infections involving CHIKV and DENV. An analysis of island-wide surveillance data from Puerto Rico during the same time period found only one CHIKV/DENV co-infection among approximately 1,000 specimens tested by RT-PCR for both DENV and CHIKV [46]. These findings are consistent with another prospective AFI study conducted in Sri Lanka [17]. Although a recent study has shown that Aedes aegypti can be infected with as many as three arboviruses simultaneously and can likely transmit these viruses to humans [47], the frequency of co- or tri-infection of mosquitoes in the wild depends upon the geographic spread and degree of circulation of each virus. During our study, DENV transmission decreased significantly before CHIKV transmission peaked, making co-infections less likely. In addition, in Puerto Rico, where Aedes aegypti is the sole vector for CHIKV and DENV, viral interaction and viral interference within the mosquito may reduce the likelihood of co-infection [48\u201350]. However, RT-PCR positive DENV/CHIKV co-infections have been documented at higher rates in five countries [51].",

We found, as have others [61], that even early (<3 DPO) in the clinical course leukopenia and thrombocytopenia are predictive of dengue across all age groups, and thrombocytopenia strengthened as a predictor over time. In our study, headache and eye pain were the only \u201caches and pains\u201d that were predictive of dengue for all age groups [62]. Eye pain was a predictor early and later in the clinical course, a finding consistent with pediatric [63] and adult [56] prospective cohort studies, as well as a surveillance study conducted in Puerto Rico [52]. We also found that rash among children <5 years old presenting early and erythema on the face and/or neck in all age groups presenting 3\u20135 DPO, were positive predictors of dengue. While the presence of skin rash has been found to be a predictor of dengue in several prospective studies [61], few studies have evaluated erythema as a predictor [18, 64, 65]. Last, like other prospective studies [56, 66], we found that nausea is an early predictor for dengue. We were also able to show that adults aged 20\u201349 years presenting 3\u20135 DPO were more likely to have abdominal pain than those with other AFIs, and dengue cases of all ages presenting 3\u20135 DPO were also more likely to have diarrhea and poor circulation in addition to nausea, findings that lend support to the idea that warning signs for severe dengue develop after the early phase of the illness.",

The study was conducted in southern Puerto Rico which may differ from neighboring islands and other parts of the island with regard to population demographics, preexisting immunity to DENV and other flaviviruses, and exposure to infections. Second, while we enrolled nearly 600 older adults (\u226565 years old), we were unable to adequately evaluate predictors of dengue among this population because we had only 36 dengue cases and most presented early in the clinical course. Last, we did not systematically collect stool and test for potential enteric pathogens, and bacterial infections were likely under recognized because blood cultures were only done on patients in whom sepsis was suspected.",

In fact, we were unable to find any cases of Rickettsia spp., Ehrlichia spp., and Coxiella spp., and only sporadic cases of melioidosis and leptospirosis were identified. Our findings demonstrate that dengue is not only one of the leading causes of AFI in Puerto Rico, but results in greater morbidity than other AFIs as measured by need for hospitalization. Moreover, dengue affects people of all ages including older adults who may be at higher risk of developing medical complications. Clinicians should include dengue on the differential diagnosis of AFI among older adults so that timely anticipatory guidance can be offered. We found that the presence of leukopenia and thrombocytopenia were the best predictors of dengue in both time periods overall and for all age groups. Our findings suggest that eye pain should be reevaluated as a predictor of dengue. Future studies should focus on improving clinical diagnosis of AFI including dengue by timing of presentation and age of the patient.",
