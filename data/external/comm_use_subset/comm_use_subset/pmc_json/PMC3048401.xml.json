Most of viral ARI especially in children are caused by human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which induces bronchiolitis, asthma exacerbation and pneumonia, and leads to high hospitalization rates [3], [4]. Influenza virus (FLUV) causes a common vaccine-preventable viral infection that can be severe or fatal in the very young, the elderly, and those with underlying illnesses. In temperate climates like in the U.S, wintertime seasonal influenza epidemics often result in dramatic increases in hospitalization, death and significant economic losses due to workplace absenteeism [5]. Human rhinovirus (HRV) is responsible for the majority of common colds causing upper ARI, and often induces pneumonia and asthma exacerbation in children [6], [7]. It was also observed that human metapneumovirus (HMPV) accounted for approximately 5\u201310% of all ARI in children and adults [8] and human adenovirus (HAdV) was shown to be responsible of 5\u201310% of ARI in children only [9]. In addition, infections caused by other viruses such as human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV), human coronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 occur worldwide. Furthermore, the recently discovered human coronavirus HCoV-NL63 [10], HCoV-HKU1 [11] and human bocavirus (HBoV) [12] have also joined the panel of virus responsible of ARI.",

It has several bio-climates from sub-tropical to semi-arid along its coasts and a more temperate climate in the centre highlands. Madagascar is one of the poorest countries of the world with a health system that is hardly efficient to monitor and prevent outbreaks. Prospective influenza surveillance has been conducted in Madagascar through a network of sentinel sites for over 30 years. This surveillance system has enabled a better understanding of the epidemiology of influenza in the country [13]. Viruses isolated through surveillance have been used by WHO for its annual recommendation for influenza vaccines composition. Several studies about the burden of the Influenza virus in Madagascar were already published including the first investigation of outbreak of ILI which occurred in the central part of Madagascar in July 2002 [13], [14], [15]. However, little is known about the burden of the other respiratory viruses responsible for ILI among the Malagasy people. Even if some studies have demonstrated that ARI cause a high rate of hospitalization and mortality among children in Madagascar [16], [17], only one has reported data regarding respiratory viruses detected in children hospitalized with ARI syndromes [17]. In that study, viral infection were detected in 43/80 (54%) of children under 10 years old.",

In Antananarivo, influenza circulation occurred during two distinct periods. The first one during the cold season and similar to what occurs in southern hemisphere countries. Considering that Madagascar is in the southern hemisphere, the second circulation from January to March is particular. Indeed, it is concomitant to influenza circulation in countries with temperate climate from the northern hemisphere. Our hypothesis is that this circulation could be linked to the increase of travelers between Europe (France) and Madagascar during Christmas holidays. Nevertheless, this pattern of influenza circulation is also observed in other subtropical regions like in Hong-Kong [13], [27], [28]. A circulation of RSV was occurred during the warm and rainy season from February to May with a peak on March. RSV infection occurred in Madagascar as observed in other countries with subtropical climate [6],[29],[30]. A study in the Nepal (Kathmandu Valley) showed a positive correlation between RSV and humidity [29]. Another one in Kenya (Kilifi District) detected two epidemics of RSV infection during rainy and warmer season showed no correlation between RSV circulation and meteorological factors [31]. Nevertheless, climate in Kilifi is quite different compare to one in Antananarivo. Further studies including meteorological parameters are needed to understand if temperature and/or humidity are factors associate with RSV infection in Madagascar. Indeed, differences might be observed when compare viral circulation in center highland (subtropical, temperate) to coastal area (equatorial to semi-arid). HRV was detected all year around as observed by Pierangeli et al. and Matthew et al. [6], [7]. In our study, HCoV-OC43 infection occurred in winter, before the FLUAV circulation, however HAdV was more frequent during summer.

            "text": "Our study has some limitations. The limited sample size of this study did not allow the thorough investigation of association of symptoms in relation to infection with the detected pathogens. Moreover, by comparing the proportion of samples in each age group with the age pyramid of Madagascar, we found that our sample was biased toward young patients. Thus, even if it is known that children are more susceptible to respiratory infections we cannot assess if a particular age population is more at risk of getting a specific infection and co-infection. In addition, our sentinel surveillance in Madagascar was not population-based, so we could not extrapolate prevalence data from clinics to the general population. This study is based on influenza sentinel surveillance, thus our case definition for ILI is strict and excludes many viral infections with no fever or asymptomatic cases. Taken this into account, it is likely that with a broader definition, we would have detected more viral infection. On the other hand, since Real-Time PCR is very sensitive and can detect low viral load and does not required replication-competent viruses, we could not exclude that some detections could be due to carriage or co-carriage in the case of co-infections. Indeed some authors have shown that some respiratory viruses like HRV, HADV and HCoV can be detected in asymptomatic children [32] and that RNA from HRV can be detected from nasal mucus of children several weeks after the onset of the disease [33]. Thus, some viruses that we detected might not cause the disease. On the other hand we can also argue that, in some cases, it is the co-infection that causes the disease. In any case, previous studies showing good sensitivities and specificities for symptomatic patients [34], [35], suggest that molecular assays testing for these fourteen pathogens in respiratory secretions still have some interests in clinical practice.",
