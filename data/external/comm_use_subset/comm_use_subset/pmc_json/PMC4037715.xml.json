In such a network, an individual (a node) not only connects with his/her friends on a physical contact layer (subnetwork), but also communicates with them through the (electronic) communication layer. The structures of the two layers can in general be quite different. For example, an indoor-type of individual has few friends in the real world but may have many friends in the cyber space, leading to a much higher degree in the communication layer than in the physical-contact layer. Generally, the degree-to-degree correlation between the two layers cannot be assumed to be strong.",

The dynamics component in our model can be described, as follows. In the communication layer (layer A), the classic susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) epidemiological model43 is used to describe the dissemination of information about the disease. In the SIR model, each node can be in one of the three states: (1) susceptible state (S) in which the individual has not received any information about the disease, (2) informed state(I), where the individual is aware of disease and is capable of transmitting the information to other individuals in the same layer, and (3) refractory state (R), in which the individual has received the information but is not willing to pass it on to other nodes. At each time step, the information can propagate from every informed node to all its neighboring nodes. If a neighbor is in the susceptible state, it will be informed with probability \u03b2A. At the same time, each informed node can enter the recovering phase with probability \u00b5A. Once an informed node is recovered, it will remain in this state for all subsequent time. A node in layer A will get the information about the disease once its counterpart node in layer B is infected.

Given that the vaccination and epidemic processes can be treated successively and separately, the epidemic outbreak threshold can be derived by a bond percolation analysis2045 (see details in Supporting Information). We obtain where SA is the density of the informed population, which can be obtained by solving Eqs. (S18) and (S19) in Supporting Information. For \u03b8 < 1, we see from Eq.

Therefore, we employ the susceptibility measure52\n\u03c7 to numerically determine the size-dependent outbreak threshold: where N is network size (N = NA = NB), and r denotes the final outbreak ratio such as the final densities RA and RB of the recovered nodes in layers A and B, respectively. We use 2 \u00d7 103 independent dynamic realizations on a fixed double-layer network to calculate the average value of \u03c7 for the communication layer for each value of \u03b2A. As shown in Fig. 2(a), \u03c7 exhibits a maximum value at \u03b2Ac, which is the threshold value of the information spreading process. The simulations are further implemented using 30 different two-layer network realizations to obtain the average value of \u03b2Ac. The identical simulation setting is used for all subsequent numerical results, unless otherwise specified. Figure 2(b) shows the information threshold \u03b2Ac as a function of the disease-transmission rate \u03b2B. Note that the statistical errors are not visible here (same for similar figures in the paper), as they are typically vanishingly small. We see that the behavior of the information threshold can be classified into two classes, as predicted by Eq. (9). In particular, for \u03b2B \u2264 \u03b2Bu = 1/\u2329kB\u232a = 0.125, the disease transmission on layer B has little impact on the information threshold on layer A, as we have . For \u03b2B > \u03b2Bu, the outbreak of epidemic on layer B leads to \u03b2Ac = 0.0. Comparison of the information thresholds for different vaccination rates shows that the value of the vaccination probability p has essentially no effect on \u03b2Ac.",

From Fig. 3(a), we see that the value of \u03b2Bc is not influenced by \u03b2A for \u03b2A \u2264 \u03b2Au \u2248 0.06, whereas \u03b2Bc increases with \u03b2A. For p = 0.5, the analytical results from Eq. (11) are consistent with the simulated results. However, deviations occur for larger values of p, e.g., p = 0.9, because the effect of information spreading is over-emphasized in cases where the two types of spreading dynamics are treated successively but not simultaneously. The gap between the theoretical and simulated thresholds diminishes as the network size is increased, validating applicability of the analysis method that, strictly speaking, holds only in the thermodynamic limit20 (see details in Supporting Information). Note that a giant residual cluster does not exist in layer B for p = 0.9 and \u03b2A \u2265 0.49, ruling out epidemic outbreak. The phase diagram indicating the possible existence of a giant residual cluster [Eq. (S20) in Supporting Information] is shown in the inset of Fig. 3(a), where in phase II, there is no such cluster. In Fig. 3(b), a large value of p causes \u03b2Bc to increase for \u03b2A > \u03b2Au. We observe that, similar to Fig. 3(a), for relatively large values of p, say p \u2265 0.8, the analytical prediction deviates from the numerical results. The effects of network size N, exponent \u03b3A and SF-SF network structure on the information and epidemic thresholds are discussed in detail in Supporting Information.",

From Fig. 4(a), we see that the final recovered density RA for information increases with \u03b2A and \u03b2B rapidly for \u03b2A \u2264 \u03b2Au and \u03b2B \u2264 \u03b2Bu. Figure 4(b) reveals that the recovered density RB for disease decreases with \u03b2A. We see that a large value of \u03b2A can prevent the outbreak of epidemic for small values of \u03b2B, as RB \u2192 0 for \u03b2B = 0.2 and \u03b2A \u2265 0.5 (the red solid line). From Fig. 4(c), we see that, with the increase in \u03b2A, more nodes in layer B are vaccinated. It is interesting to note that the vaccinated density VB exhibits a maximum value if \u03b2A is not large. Figure 4 shows that the maximum value of VB is about 0.32, which occurs at \u03b2B \u2248 0.20, for \u03b2A = 0.2. Combining with Fig. 3(a), we find that the corresponding point of the maximum value \u03b2B \u2248 0.20 is close to \u03b2Bc \u2248 0.16 for p = 0.5. This is because the transmission of disease has the opposite effects on the vaccinations. For \u03b2B \u2264 \u03b2Bc, the newly infected nodes in layer B will facilitate information spreading in layer A, resulting in more vaccinated nodes. For \u03b2B > \u03b2Bc, the epidemic spreading will make a large number of nodes infected, reducing the number of nodes that are potentially to be vaccinated. For relatively large values of \u03b2A, information tends to spread much faster than the disease for \u03b2B \u2264 \u03b2Bc, e.g., \u03b8 \u2248 0.21 for \u03b2A = 0.5, p = 0.5, \u03b2Bc \u2248 0.22, and \u03b8 \u2248 0.12 for \u03b2A = 0.9, p = 0.5, and \u03b2Bc \u2248 0.23. In this case, the effect of disease transmission on information spreading is negligible. The densities of the final dynamical states for SF-SF networks are also shown in Supporting Information, and we observe similar behaviors.",

For example, in social networks, positive inter-layer correlation is more common than negative correlation5455. That is, an \u201cimportant\u201d individual with a large number of links in one network layer (e.g., representing one type of social relations) tends to have many links in other types of network layers that reflect different kinds of social relations. Recent works have shown that inter-layer correlation can have a large impact on the percolation properties of multiplex networks3739. Here, we investigate how the correlation between the communication and contact layers affects the information and disease spreading dynamics. To be concrete, we focus on the effects of positive correlation on the two types of spreading dynamics. It is necessary to construct a two-layer correlated network with adjustable degree of inter-layer correlation. This can be accomplished by first generating a two-layer network with the maximal positive correlation, where each layer has the same structure as uncorrelated networks. Then, Nq pairs of counterpart nodes, in which q is the rematching probability, are rematched randomly, leading to a two-layer network with weaker inter-layer correlation. The inter-layer correlation after rematching is given by (see Methods) which is consistent with the numerical results [e.g., see inset of Fig. 5(a) below]. For SF-ER networks with fixed correlation coefficient, the mean-field rate equations of the double-layer system cannot be written down because the concrete expressions of the conditional probabilities P(kB|kA) and P(kA|kB) are no longer available.",

We also see that the value of \u03b2Ac for ER-ER layered networks with the same mean degree is greater because of the homogeneity in the degree distribution of layer A. Figures 5(b) and 6(b) show that \u03b2Bc decreases with q or, equivalently, \u03b2Bc increases with ms. This is because stronger inter-layer correlation can increase the probability for nodes with large degrees in layer B to be vaccinated, thus effectively preventing the outbreak of epidemic [see also Eqs.

A mean-field based analysis and extensive computations reveal an intricate interdependence of two basic quantities characterizing the spreading dynamics on both layers: the outbreak thresholds and the final fractions of infected nodes. In particular, on the communication layer, the outbreak of the information about the disease can be triggered not only by its own spreading dynamics but also by the the epidemic outbreak on the counter-layer. In addition, high disease and information-transmission rates can enhance markedly the final density of the informed or refractory population. On the layer of physical contact, the epidemic threshold can be increased but only if information itself spreads through the communication layer at a high rate. The information spreading can greatly reduce the final refractory density for the disease through vaccination. While a rapid spread of information will prompt more nodes in the contact layer to consider immunization, the authenticity of the information source must be verified before administrating large-scale vaccination.",

The mean-field rate equations of epidemic spreading in layer B are Eqs. (4) \u2013 (7). We note that the second term on the right side of Eq.
