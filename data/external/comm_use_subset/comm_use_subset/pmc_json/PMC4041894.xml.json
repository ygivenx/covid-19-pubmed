Using the tetra primer ARMS-PCR, the different alleles at position +401 could be successfully distinguished: universal control product: 200 bp; T allele: 138 bp; C allele: 99 bp (Figure \n3A).

Therefore, it is unlikely that they mediate the outcome of the infection directly by altering the function of IFN-\u03b3. In humans, IFNG polymorphisms have been found that correlate with the expression of IFN-\u03b3. In the promoter region, SNP at positions \u2212183 and \u2212155 were found to influence the binding of activating transcription factor-1 and the nuclear factor-associated T-cell site\n[49,50]. In addition, the number of CA microsatellite repeats was found to be tightly associated with the SNP at position +874 and to influence the production of IFN-\u03b3 by altering the binding activity of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells\n[15]. In ewes, despite the polymorphisms in INFG at position -641, the microsatellite showed a significant effect on IFNG expression in the spleen, although the mechanism that mediates this effect remains unknown. In the present study, a clear correlation between the IFN-\u03b3 responses and the genotype at position +428 was observed (Figure \n2B). The resistant T allele at position +428 may serve as a major factor to enhance the IFN-\u03b3 production upon infections of intracellular pathogens. Despite lacking correlation with the IFN-\u03b3 level, the SNP at positions +401 and +408 might still play a minor role in the alteration of the production of IFN-\u03b3. Since the three FIP-related SNP identified in this study are located in a small cluster, it is possible that these polymorphisms alter the binding of one or more transcription factors and work together to influence the immune response to FCoV infection. However, the actual mechanism for the altered expression of IFN-\u03b3 remains to be investigated.",

Using the ARMS-PCR and RFLP tests established, the three SNP could be distinguished in the ordinary diagnostic laboratory without sequencing, and cats bearing either the susceptible or resistant genotypes could be identified. Since the disease outcome is usually influenced by multiple host genes, other candidate genes, i.e., tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1\n[51,52], interleukin-12\n[6] and CD209\n[53], are currently being surveyed. A combination of all the FIP-related SNP into a single genotyping microarray will allow the selection of resistant cats before breeding and eventually decrease the morbidity of the cat population to FIP.",
