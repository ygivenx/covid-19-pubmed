            "text": "The cause of pneumonia in intensive care units (ICUs) remains unknown in nearly 30% of cases despite extensive microbiological investigations [1], [2]. Microbial communities previously identified, in deep respiratory samples, include bacteria, fungi and viruses for which the role in the observed pathology is not clear. Microorganisms frequently identified in respiratory samples from ICU-pneumonia patients included Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococci, Enterobacteria, Candida albicans, Influenza virus, Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and Cytomegalovirus (CMV) [3]\u2013[7]. In some investigations, a pathogenic bacterium is isolated, whereas in other cases, the number of colony forming units (CFU) is considered to determine the pathogenic character [8]. Recently, the bacterial microbiota of patients with cystic fibrosis and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) were studied using 16S rDNA gene amplification followed by clone libraries sequencing [9]\u2013[11]. Our laboratory has contributed to this work and has shown, by different sequencing approaches, that the microbial population of patients with cystic fibrosis was more diverse than expected [10], [11]. Here, we use a comparable approach in order to study 185 episodes of ICU pneumonia and 25 control cases. These patients were studied using broad-range primer amplification of the 16S rDNA gene of bacteria and the intergenic spacer of 18S rDNA gene of fungi followed by cloning and sequencing. We also used specific quantitative PCR (qPCR) to target fastidious bacteria and a spectrum of viruses. Moreover, we tested samples from our patients by standardized routine culture, amoebal co-culture, blood culture, ELISA targeted antibody detection, immunofluorescent assay antigenemia and antigenuria testing as routinely performed in such cases to compare these routine tests with molecular approaches.",

Bacterial clone libraries from amplified 16S rDNA genes (nearly 4,000 clones that contained exploitable sequences were included) identified 157 different bacteria at the species level. Detailed data about the relative abundance and richness of each species in their corresponding library are summarized in data S1 and S2 in supplementary informations. Bacterial clone libraries of patients showed that 44 libraries were characterized by the presence of only one bacterium, 40 libraries were polybacterial but dominated by one bacterium (50% of the clones in the library), whereas 45 libraries were polybacterial without any dominant bacterium (Fig. 1). Bacterial clone libraries of controls showed that 2 libraries were characterized by the presence of only one bacterium, 4 libraries were polybacterial but dominated by one bacterium (50% of the clones in the library), whereas 7 libraries were polybacterial but without any dominant bacterium (Fig. 1). Patients exhibited up to 15 bacteria in their BAL fluids (mean \u00b1 SD; 3.48\u00b12.80) (Tables 1 and 2). Overall, patients exhibited 146 different species belonging to 7 different phyla (13 classes, 23 orders, 44 families and 71 genera) of which 73 had not been previously observed in BAL from pneumonia, whereas bacterial clone libraries of controls identified 38 species belonging to 4 different phyla (9 classes, 13 orders, 22 families and 27 genera). In patients, aerobic gram-negative bacilli, gram-positive cocci, and anaerobic bacteria from oropharyngeal flora were the most frequent bacteria identified (Tables S1,S2,S3,S4, Fig. 2). Surprisingly, bacteria that are usually associated with other diseases such as the gram-positive anaerobe Atopobium vaginae, or from unexpected animal origins, such as Enterococcus canintestini, were alsoc found. Moreover, 51 strictly anaerobic bacteria (35%) were found in patients versus 17 anaerobic bacteria (44%) found in controls (p = 0.26). Among those bacteria which were identified in controls, 24 bacteria were also identified in patients (Fig. S1, Tables S2,S3,S4), including Pseudomonas aeruginosa sequences respectively identified in 100% and 86% from 2 different clones libraries from 2 immunocompromised controls. In the second clone library, the 14% of the remaining sequences included Achromobacter xylosoxidans, which also is a typical bacterium of nosocomial pneumonia. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia sequences were found in 10% of clone library of another immunocompromised control, along with 5 other bacteria. Similarly, sequences of Streptococcus mitis (7% of the clone library) was identified along with 12 other bacteria in a control with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and a history of aspiration pneumonia (AP) 6 days before BAL sampling. Additionally, Arcobacter cryaerophilus, Atopobium parvulum, Lachnospiraceae bacterium, Prevotella melaninogenica, and Prevotella pallens were significantly more frequent in controls than in patients (p = 0.01, 0.01, 0.001, 0.01 and 0.01 respectively) (Table S4).",

In ventilated subjects, monomicrobial patients have a slightly shorter period of mechanical ventilation prior to the pneumonia episode as compared to polymicrobials. Monomicrobial controls have a remarkably shorter period of mechanical ventilation before sampling compared to polymicrobials (p = 0.25; Table 3). The same observation was showed for length of ICU stay prior to sampling and for total length of hospital stay. According to these observations, the polymicrobial profiles of controls seem to be partially related to the high duration of ICU stay before sampling.

The ICU mortality rate was higher in pneumonia patients for whom BAL fluids exhibited only viruses or fungi, or both than in monobacterial or polybacterial patients (p = 0.01; Table S7).

Comparative analyses of lung microbiota between these studies showed that 147 different genera were found in all of them. Among these genera, 70 genera are widely distributed within the studies including Gemella, Haemophilus, Megasphaera, Neisseria, Porphyromonas, Prevotella, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus and Streptococcus genera which have commonly been found irrespective of study. In contrast, 77 genera were restrictively identified across the studies (Table 4). However, at the species level (only the studies that determined bacterial species were included [9], [11], [14]), comparative analyses showed that from 59 bacteria commonly distributed within the studies, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Prevotella oris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus mitis were commonly found in the four studies. In contrast, 291 bacteria were restrictively identified across the studies (Fig. S3). Consequently, comparative analysis at the specie-level showed that some bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococci, are commonly found in pulmonary specimens. However, the pattern of distribution of many other species is distinctly heterogeneous and depending on the specific study and disease. Variation of lung microbiota, from one individual to another and from one study to another, suggests that the repertoire of microorganisms associated with respiratory infections still remains incompletely understood.",

Consequently, lung microbiota can vary greatly between individuals, depending on underlying diseases, habits and geographic origin. Additionally, these unexpected microorganisms may explain a lack of response to drug therapies in some pneumonia patients.

            "text": "Moreover, by comparing molecular testing to standard routine methods, this study reveals that many pneumonia-associated pathogens are fastidious or uncultured and highlights a wide discrepancy between culture and molecular microorganism repertoire. Our study also shows that the molecular assay remains a more efficient method to detect microorganisms in the pneumonia samples, independently of atmospheric conditions and medium nutrient supplements, which are particularly important for culture, especially for fastidious microorganisms. In addition, microorganism diagnosis was obtained for 156 (84%) episodes of pneumonia by molecular tools compared with 120 (65%) pneumonia episodes for which microorganism diagnosis was successfully done by culture (Table S8). In particular, molecular tools seem to be far more sensitive than culture for bacterial detection. This observation is based on the high number of microorganisms, especially bacteria which were identified by molecular methods compared with those detected by culture. In fact, standard and special BAL cultures identified few, essentially easily-grown and strictly aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria (23 species) compared to molecular tools which identified 160 bacterial species (p<0.001) (Fig S4 and S5). Molecular tools enabled the identification of unexpected bacteria which usually colonize vaginal tracts, such as Atopobium vaginae and Peptoniphilus lacrimalis, or of other bacteria coming from unexpected animal origins, such as Chlamydia pscittasi, Enterococcus canintestini and Streptococcus bovis, or of potentially known to be associated with other diseases, such as Tropheryma whipplei, which were not identified by culture. Furthermore molecular tools allowed the detection of pathogenic bacteria such as Mycobacterium sp. and Mycoplasma pneumoneae, for which identification attempts by culture using specific media were failed due to culture biases. Moreover, all bacteria that were first associated with pneumonia in the present study were exclusively identified by molecular methods. These findings are coherent to results from previous studies on bacterial communities of respiratory diseases, including pneumonia, which showed that molecular assays are more sensitive than culture [9], [11], [14]. However, although molecular approaches identified more fungal species than culture, fungal diagnoses were positive for 79 (42%) episodes of pneumonia by culture compared with 31 (17%) pneumonia episodes for which fungal diagnosis was successfully obtained using molecular tools. Thus, fungal BAL culture was more sensitive to detect some cultured fungi, such as Candida species, than molecular approaches.",

This result is concordant with similar studies of pneumonia and cystic fibrosis subjects [9], [14] and shows that in respiratory infections, more complex bacteria populations can exist, among which novel bacteria had never been previously identified. Moreover, this finding was also supported by other studies performed on endodontic infections, demonstrating that many novel bacteria essentially resident in the oropharyngeal and dental plaque flora can be detected in these infections [28], [29].

This was the situation for 5 pneumonia patients for whom serology provided evidence for influenza A virus infection, whereas qPCR performed on their BAL fluids was negative. Moreover, by combining culture-based methods, blood culture and serology to molecular approaches we significantly increase the probability to detect microorganisms in the pneumonia episodes. In fact, by using these exhaustive laboratory diagnostic tools, we failed to identify a microbial agent in only 7% of the pneumonia episodes, which is significant when compared to previous studies where the microbial agent was not found in more than 30% of episodes of pneumonia (p<0.001) [32]. However, the clinical significance of these microorganisms and their role in the etiology of pneumonia remain difficult to be cleared as their correlation with the disease causation remains to be studied and confirmed in the future. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that it would be highly recommended to develop a rapid molecular test to target, besides typical pathogens, potential pathogens known to be fastidious or uncultured (such as anaerobic ones), and that it would be useful to add it to existing routine standard techniques.",

A total of 185 BAL fluids, 185 blood samples and 185 urinary samples from 130 ICU pneumonia patients were studied. A diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia was defined as previously described [32]\u2013[34]. BAL and blood sampling were performed as previously described [35]. A cohort of 25 ICU patients without pneumonia was studied as controls. Pneumonia patients exhibited 32 episodes of community-associated pneumonia, 106 episodes of ventilator-associated pneumonia, 22 episodes of non-ventilator ICU pneumonia and 25 episodes of aspiration pneumonia.

DNA was tested by PCR for bacteria using broad-range primers targeting the 16S rDNA gene; PCR was also used to test for universal fungi using broad-range primers targeting intergenic spacer of 18S rDNA gene (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium) (Table 5). PCR product was cloned and approximately 48 clones were screened per library. PCR, cloning and sequencing were performed as previously described [12]. The obtained sequences were assembled and analyzed by chromaspro software and then BLASTed against those available in the GenBank database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) for species identification. Chimeric sequence search was performed with Black Box Chimera Check (B2C2) program [36] and by examining the BLAST profile of each sequence. Suspected chimeric sequences were discarded from the study. Sequences showing a similarity of >98% were considered to be known species, whereas sequences showing a similarity of <98% were considered to be novel species. Legionella sp., Afipia sp.,Bradyrhizobium sp., Azorhizobium sp., Mesorhizobium sp., Balneatrix alpaca and Pneumocystis carinii were tested by PCR using specific primers followed by sequencing of PCR products (Table 5).
