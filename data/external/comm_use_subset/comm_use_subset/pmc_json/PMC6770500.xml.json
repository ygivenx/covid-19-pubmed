            "text": "A worldwide infectious disease, infectious bronchitis causes huge economic losses in poultry production systems [1]. Its etiological agent is the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a Coronaviridae-family gammacoronavirus whose genome is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA that is 27.6 kb in length [2]. IBV has four structural proteins, membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N), envelope (E) and spike (S). The latter is cleaved into two subunits, where S1\u2014the principal antigen generating neutralizing antibodies\u2014recognizes host cellular receptors and, therefore, determines the virus tropism, and S2 attaches the entire protein to the virus [2]. The non-structural protein 14 of Coronaviruses has a 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 exonuclease activity, which keeps under control the error rates in the replication process, although allowing the generation of diversity for their evolution and adaptation, thus contributing to emergence of new strains [3]. Identification of three hypervariable regions (HVR) along S1 [4,5] is a reasonable way to evaluate structural changes in S1 and thereby determination of the homology between different strains. Understanding the changes in the primary sequence of these regions is an approach to the conformational changes observed in the tertiary one, which finally is responsible for evolution and immune escape of the virus.",

When IBV was first described in Chile [12], the Massachusetts (Mass) strain was the only vaccine authorized by the Ministry of Agriculture. In 2009, several outbreaks were reported in flocks that had received the Mass vaccine, latter characterized as Q1 strains [13] and classified in G1-16 lineage [14]. Hence, the Ministry of Agriculture approved the introduction of the 4/91 vaccine even though the serotype was not present in Chile.",

Two weeks after the last inoculation, the chicks were sacrificed and the blood harvested.

Despite de Wit [36] having reviewed field viruses or vaccines recovery up to 28 weeks, this long period is mainly from feces, and the viral recovery from tracheas and kidneys is significantly lower [37,38]. Cavanagh et al. [39] showed that passages in chicks produce a change in position 95, from alanine to serine, as observed here. Furthermore, these isolates were obtained from an outbreak in a commercial flock exhibiting clinical signs, they were not fortuitous isolations. Finally, the flock was negative for most common respiratory pathogens. Thus, the 13885R-17 and 13861R-17 isolates appear to be wild viruses derived of the 4/91 vaccine, emerging after an unquantified number of passages within the flock. ",

The same type of antigenic relationship was described between the 13347SP-15 isolate and both vaccines (Table 2). Field viruses 12101SP-09 and 13347SP-15 belong to the same GI-16 lineage (Figure 1). As such, they are expected to share the same type of antigenic relationship with the vaccines despite being isolated six years apart, thus, the 23 different residues observed (Figure 2) were not enough to cluster apart the viruses from 2009 and 2015. Thus, we can conclude that the amino-acid changes observed between the two field strains (Figure 2) were not in residues critical to changing their affinity for the Mass and 4/91 vaccines.",

More recently, de Wit et al. [44] have shown that better levels of protection can be achieved by applying an inactivated IB vaccine after prior stimulation with attenuated Mass and 4/91 vaccines. Along these lines, Chilean poultry producers have adopted the strategy of vaccinating chicks with attenuated Mass and 4/91 vaccines during the rearing period. At the end of that period, they use an inactive Mass vaccine, which has been shown to be effective, given that the clinical outbreaks have mainly been controlled.",

As such, studying the protectiveness of the vaccines through the concept of protectotype rather than evaluating serotypes or genotypes presents as a reasonable solution.

            "text": "To date, the IBV vaccine attenuation process involved passage through embryonated eggs, and little is known about the amino-acid residues involved in the loss of virulence. Shimazaki et al. [34] found the same aminoacidic change in the position 55 in a similar field isolate, thus, it could be involved in the virulence reversion of the vaccine. Oade et al. [50] found that the embryonated egg attenuation process can generate different genomic patterns in different attenuated viral populations and verified a low level of consensus among them. As such, the reversal of virulence can be achieved in different and unpredictable ways facilitated by the high rates of mutation described for IBV [31,51,52]. These data support growing concern about introduction of an attenuated vaccine where its pathogenic variant has not been previously described.",

The local sanitary services should consider the information here showed before authorizing the introduction of foreign strains in their countries. However, the previous statement implies to develop new approaches for vaccines elaboration instead the use of current vaccines, reminding to keep our poultries health now, but without forgetting that it must be in a long-term way too. For more comprehensive understanding, a whole-genome approach must be taken to clarify whether the proximity to the field strains from 2017 is due to vaccine reversion by mutation and/or one or more recombination processes is involved, where the vaccinal strain has been proven to have escaped and contributed with genetic material to field viruses [32,53,54]. A deep epidemiological approach will also be required to evaluate the current status of viral populations so as to determine how many strains are co-circulating and any possible dominance hierarchies established among them.",
