PPAR\u03b3 is a nuclear receptor implicated in adipocyte differentiation. Two isoforms exist: PPAR\u03b31 is ubiquitously expressed while PPAR\u03b32 is almost exclusively expressed in the adipose tissue [16,17]. When activated by one of its ligands, PPAR\u03b3 heterodimerizes with retinoid X receptor \u03b1 (RXR\u03b1) and binds to the peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPRE) on the promoter of its target genes [18,19]. PPAR\u03b3 regulates positively its own transcription and induces transcription of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein \u03b1 (C/EBP\u03b1), which in turn also activates PPAR\u03b3 gene expression [20,21]. Many natural PPAR\u03b3 ligands have been discovered including AA, prostaglandins, oxidized fatty acid (FA) and some polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) [22\u201326].",

These LD-associated proteins down-regulate LD lipolysis by reducing association of lipases with the surface of the LD [31\u201333]. On the other hand, hepatic PPAR\u03b1 regulates energy combustion [34] by activating the mitochondrial and the peroxisomal \u03b2-oxidation pathways as well as the microsomal \u03c9-oxidation pathway [35]. Paradoxically, PPAR\u03b1 also activates lipogenesis by regulating the sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1c) and liver X receptor \u03b1 expression (LXR\u03b1) [36].",

            "text": "In the present study, we demonstrate that H-apoD Tg mice express significant amounts of H-apoD in the liver. As a result, these mice develop hepatic steatosis through over-expression and activation of PPAR\u03b31. Consequently, the expressions of Plin2, Cide A and C are increased leading to stabilization of LD. In addition, we observed an increase in CD36 expression associated with an elevation of FA uptake. In these conditions, lipogenesis remains unaffected despite an elevated expression of FAS and an inhibition of ACC activity. Overexpressing H-apoD in HepG2 cells in the presence of AA strongly suggests that the presence of hepatic steatosis in Tg mice is the result of PPAR\u03b3 activation by AA, one of the main ligand of apoD. Supporting this hypothesis, we showed that AA concentration is enriched in liver and decreased in plasma. Our work reveals a novel mechanism of apoD action in lipid metabolism.",

Consistently with an elevated expression of proteins involved in hepatic LD formation and fusion, we found that the size of the hepatic LD in H-apoD Tg mice was drastically increased (5.45-fold) compared to WT. However, we did not detect a significant modification in the number of LD between the Tg and WT mice suggesting that the observed phenomenon was a result of both LD fusion and formation of new LD (Fig 2E).",

We next co-transfected the H-apoD cDNA construct with a construct containing five peroxisomes proliferator-activator receptor elements (PPRE) linked to a luciferase reporter gene. Thereafter, cells were incubated with 7 \u03bcM of AA in presence or absence of apoD. At this concentration, AA does not induce any cellular toxicity [53] but a slight decrease in apoD expression (Fig 6A). Over-expression of apoD increased PPAR\u03b3 transcriptional activity (3.7 fold, Fig 6B). Addition of AA alone increased PPAR\u03b3 transcriptional activity to a similar extent (3.9-fold).

This effect is also associated with an elevation of fatty acid uptake while lipogenesis remains unaffected. Because the metabolic syndrome is mild, the slight increase in the mitochondrial \u03b2-oxidation is probably a compensatory mechanism. Experiments performed with HepG2 cells suggest that the hepatic steatosis is a result of an increased AA by apoD in the liver as confirmed by the enrichment of hepatic AA in H-apoD mice.

As expected, analysis of the expression pattern of human apoD mRNA in Tg mice clearly showed a higher expression in the CNS but expression in the liver and in the plasma was also observed [15]. Similar observations were made at protein levels. The hepatic steatosis can therefore be the result of increased apoD concentration in the liver or from the uptake of circulating apoD. Indeed, as previously suggested by the study of Suresh and collaborators using a mice model of the Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease, apoD is a circulating protein [54].

However, in H-apoD Tg mice, we did not observe any changes in body fat mass and in circulating leptin concentration [15]. In addition, the food intake was not modified (data not shown).

We showed that activation of PPAR\u03b3 by AA in HepG2 cells is significantly potentiated by apoD. In agreement with our study, Thomas et al.

Complementing these data, we observed a slight increase in C/EBP\u03b1 expression while C/EBP\u03b2 remained unchanged. It is to note that the upregulation of C/EBP\u03b1 expression is minor. This could be explained by the fact that the hepatic steatosis progression in Tg mice is very slow and hence, the genes implicated are expected to be only slightly modulated. Furthermore, elevated PPAR\u03b3 expression results in the increase of CD36 expression. However, the LPL and HSL levels remained constant at least at the mRNA level. Previous studies demonstrated that activation of PPAR\u03b3 in the liver increases expression of LPL and CD36 [29,30] however, in our model only the FA uptake is affected without any increase in lipoproteins hydrolysis. Similar observations associating increased CD36 expression and FA uptake were made in cardiac cells [60].",

We did not observe any change in the mRNA levels of ACC, SCD1, DGAT and LXR\u03b1. We also observed an elevation of AMPK expression. The increased expression of AMPK\u03b1 is consistent with a recent study reporting that CD36 increases AMPK expression through the action of both PPAR\u03b3 and PGC-1\u03b1 [71]. Consequently, AMPK\u03b1 phosphorylation is higher in the liver of Tg mice, resulting in increased phosphorylation and inhibition of ACC [72]. Interestingly, Mao et al [73] showed that inhibition of ACC1 in mouse liver induces expression of FAS explaining why FAS expression is increased in our conditions. However, by directly measuring de novo lipogenesis in vivo using 3H2O, we showed the over-expression of H-apoD has no significant effect on de novo lipid synthesis in 1-year-old animals.

            "text": "Our study describes for the first time a role for apoD in the regulation of PPAR\u03b3 and the downstream activation of metabolic pathways leading to hepatic steatosis. In Tg mice, elevated apoD expression leads to higher hepatic AA concentration and subsequent activation of the nuclear receptor PPAR\u03b3. As a result, PPAR\u03b3 target genes such as CD36, Plin2, Cide A and Cide C are increased leading to an enhanced LCFA uptake by the hepatocytes and protecting LD against lipolysis by blocking access to lipases. Both PPAR\u03b3 activation and high CD36 expression induce AMPK expression which leads to increased PPAR\u03b1 expression and its downstream target gene, CPT1 which in turn activates mitochondrial \u03b2-oxidation. However, the activation of this compensatory pathway is insufficient to fully inhibit the accumulation of ectopic fat in the liver, but it probably contributes to reduce the progression of hepatic steatosis. Overall, our study highlights a new role for apoD as an AA transporter regulating lipid accumulation in the liver.",
