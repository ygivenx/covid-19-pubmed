The World Health Organization (WHO) raised the influenza pandemic alert level to Phase 5 on April 29, 2009, and later to Phase 6, indicating that a full global pandemic was under way. By May 23, 2009, 12,022 H1N1 cases and 83 deaths had been confirmed in 43 countries [1]. In Korea, the first H1N1 influenza infection case was confirmed on May 3, 2009, and the first H1N1-related death occurred on August 15, 2009. By the beginning of September 2009, H1N1 cases had increased dramatically, with 4,293 cases and 3 deaths confirmed by the end of September 2009. The H1N1 infection rate peaked two months later in November 2009, at which time approximately 9,000 new cases of A/H1N1 influenza were being confirmed each day. By the end of the month, a total of 104 deaths had resulted from H1N1-related causes [2], leading the Korean government to declare a public \"Emergency Response Level.\" At that time, approximately one half of all patients seeking treatment for \"common cold-like symptoms\" were found to have H1N1 influenza[3].",

Subjects were recruited from university residence halls and the campus library during a one-week period between 12/01/09 and 12/8/09. Individuals who agreed to participate were given the study questionnaire to complete on their own. In total, 942 students (738 males, 204 females) completed the questionnaire, with the proportion of male participants to female participants accurately reflecting the student body demographics at Sungkyunkwan University. Pilot surveys were conducted prior to the study in order to confirm that participants could understand the survey questions and to ensure the validity of the questionnaire content. with face or content validity of the questionnaires. Using the results of this pilot study, the survey questionnaire was amended to create a final version. This study was approved by the Samsung Medical Center IRB (No: 2009-12-030) in Korea.",

Additionally, each variable was evaluated for correlation with all other variables using the chi-squared test to identify trends. To identify factors related to the frequency of hand washing, both chi-square tests and multiple logistic regression models were used. For the logistic regression modeling, additional independent variables were selected based on data from several previous studies, including gender, presence flu-like symptoms among subject acquaintances, information encountered about hand washing, perceived effectiveness of hand washing, perceived illness severity, and perceived illness susceptibility. Chi-squared tests were also used to evaluate the relationship between recent hand washing frequency and recent flu-like symptoms by gender, with multiple logistic regression modelling employed to adjust for gender, age, type of residence, and presence of flu-like symptoms among acquaintances. Recent hand washing frequency was re-classified #4, 5-7, #8, given the frequency of each category and statistical stability in multiple logistic regression models. All of the multiple logistic regression models were validated by the average receiver operating characteristics and the p-value for the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. The software program SPSS 15.0 was used to for all data analysis. Two-tailed p-values \u2265 0.05 were considered statistically significant.",

Several previous studies have also concluded that women are more likely to follow behavioral recommendations (such as hand washing) to prevent the transmission of H1N1 influenza, SARS, or other infectious diseases [7,8,11,13]. Our results also show that the majority of subjects had encountered information about hand washing (males: 91.2%, females: 94.6%) and most perceive hand washing to be an effective measure in preventing the transmission of H1N1 influenza (males: 95.7%, females: 96.1%). These results suggest that the recent public campaigns regarding H1N1 infection prevention conducted through mass media and public education have been successful in terms of public knowledge acquisition. Similar findings were observed in other studies performed during the H1N1 influenza pandemic both in Hong Kong [12] and the UK [13]. However, in the present study, we demonstrate that gender significantly affects perceptions of hand washing effectiveness. Specifically, men are more likely to perceive hand hygiene to be an effective preventive measure against H1N1 infection. Interestingly, several previous studies conducted in Hong Kong during the SARS pandemic concluded exactly the opposite: these studies found that, when compared with women, men were less likely to believe that preventive behaviors were efficacious in controlling SARS [11,14,15]. While such differences could result from differences in study population demographics, profound differences may also exist in perceptions of hand washing between the two countries. Regardless, these conflicting findings highlight the need for additional cross-national comparative studies similar to one previous study conducted during the SARS pandemic [16].",

We contend that due to a ubiquitous media campaign, the public was already well informed about H1N1 influenza (males: 91.2%, females: 94.6%) by the time our survey was conducted, and thus any effect of obtaining information on hand washing behavior was likely minimized. Similar findings were observed in a previous study from the UK [12], where the perceived susceptibility to the illness had no additional effect on hand washing not already documented by previous studies [8-10,12,18].",

            "text": "This study has notable several limitations. First, we were unable to distinguish H1N1 influenza infection from other upper respiratory tract infections among individuals who reported flu-like symptoms, as we did not use laboratory confirmation techniques. Symptom-based outcomes often lack specificity for influenza virus infections [5,19], as they allow for variable interpretations. In our self-administered questionnaire, 'flu-like symptoms' could be construed differently by different students. However, as the survey period occurred during the peak period of the H1N1 influenza pandemic, public attention and information about H1N1 influenza can be assumed to be high. Consequently, the reliability and validity of using a descriptor like 'flu-like symptoms' may not have significantly skewed our data. Second, even though the relationship between hand hygiene and flu-like symptoms may have mixed effects on H1N1 influenza and the common cold, the contact and inhalation transmission hypotheses are relatively similar for both diseases, suggesting an overall importance of hand hygiene. Furthermore, as the survey was conducted during the peak period of the H1N1 influenza pandemic, the importance of improved hand hygiene should be emphasized. A third limitation is inherent to the study design: the use of convenience sampling - as opposed to random sampling - imposes some inherent selection bias and diminishes the internal validity. To maintain internal validity, we attempted to match the gender ratio of participants in our study with that of the general university population. Our study is further limited by the cross-sectional study design, which prevents the identification of any causal relationships, even though associations between the variables and reverse cause-effect relationships may exist. Lastly, the participants in our study were exclusively composed of students from a single university in Korea. As this does not represent the general Korean population, caution should be exercised when comparing these results with other studies.",
