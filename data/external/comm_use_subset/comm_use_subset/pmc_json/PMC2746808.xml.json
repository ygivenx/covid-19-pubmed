Taken together the numbers of genes of unknown function as well as those without experimental confirmation grow at unprecedented rates.

Protein microarrays represent one of the most powerful tools in this context [1-4]. Technical approaches for protein microarrays have benefitted from its predecessor, DNA microarray technology. Protein microarrays are designed for high throughput analysis of proteins using very small quantities of purified proteins [5]. Various protein microarray platforms have been developed, not only for screening antibodies and antigens but also for discovery of novel enzymes and enzymatic activities, protein-ligand, protein-nucleic acid and protein-protein interactions [6-11]. Immunoproteomic analyses, that assess antibody-antigen interactions, are among the most established microarray applications [12-15]. Theses assays have the potential to impact the field of infectious disease diagnostics and greatly facilitate the design of subunit vaccines [12,14]. The development of microarray applications for the functional characterization of proteins of unknown or unproven function continues to be a major challenge [15-18].",

Many high throughput protein production platforms have been reported [19-25]. Proteins are typically overexpressed in a heterologous host system (E. coli) and purified via affinity chromatography to fusion tags associated with the recombinant proteins. A recently introduced approach is based on highly parallel in vitro transcription and translation using cellular extracts [26-28]. While powerful, the difficulty with column based recombinant protein purification is relate to reduced throughput potential and low protein stability and solubility of proteins during pre-immobilization processing steps. The in vitro transcription and translation approach is relatively expensive and requires slide surfaces suitable for the immobilization of DNA and proteins. Recently, the technology has improved in efficiency and made significant studies with regard to long term instability issues of proteins prior to immobilization [9,29-31]. An in situ expression and purification method for GST-tagged proteins was reported by Ramanchandran et al. [9,32].",

The approach we present here can be combined with any expression system that yields fusion proteins with an N- or C-terminal hexa-histidine tag (His-tag). The same source set of expressed proteins allows routine reproduction of identical protein microarray chips. Both the microarray replicates and aliquots of cells expressing the recombinant proteins can be stored long-term without major concerns about the quality of the assays performed subsequently. This setup circumvents the problems caused by the long-term storage of purified proteins, which include protein degradation, precipitation and aggregation. Buffer exchange of purified and stored proteins at -80\u00b0C is not required. A flow diagram for in situ protein purification from E. coli cell cultures is shown in Figure 1. Recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli in 96-well block. Cell cultures were divided into aliquots in 96-well plates and stored as cell pellets at -80\u00b0C. The cell aliquots were subjected to lysis followed by in situ purification and immobilization of proteins via specific interactions of His-tagged proteins with a slide surface chelated with either Ni2+ or Cu2+ (Figure 1B). High affinity interactions allow relatively stringent wash steps in which the majority of weakly bound proteins are removed. Protein microarrays are stored at 4\u00b0C or used directly.",

There are two different types of protein impurities, one related to non-specific binding and the other caused by competitive binding. Non-specific interactions of endogenous E. coli proteins with a metal chelate surface depend primarily on the chemistry of the support surface. These impurities can be reduced or eliminated using effective wash steps. In the context of His-tagged proteins, competitive binding is often linked to histidine-rich E. coli proteins such as the FKBP-type peptidyl-prolyl-cis-trans-isomerase SlyD. Such impurities cannot be eliminated easily and are independent on the immobilization support.

Instead of using two-channel detection method, one-channel detection method for His-tagged proteins and E. coli endogenous protein contaminants on a 2-pad slide system was used to eliminate the mutual inferences of two antibody interactions to the immobilized proteins and to keep the same background in scanning. Considering the fluorescence brightness of Alexa Fluor 555 and ATTO 550, we estimate that the true level of purity of the immobilized recombinant proteins is greater than the relative purity measured according to Equation 1. The fluorescence brightness, which is a product of an extinction coefficient and a quantum yield of the fluorophore, of Alexa Fluor 555 and ATTO 550 are 15,000 and 96,000, respectively [37]. Using GenePix 4000B image scanner and identical experimental conditions, the brightness of ATTO 550 is at least as high as to that of Alexa Fluor 555. Combinations of four spotting buffers, PBS, PBST, TS and SB and three washing buffers, PBS, PBST and SB were examined for in situ purification of FolE and LacI. Based upon the estimation of the relative purity levels of FolE and LacI, PBST delivered the best results as a spotting and wash buffer for both Cu2+/IDA/PEG and Ni2+/NTA slides. In Figure 2, relative purities of FolE and LacI, printed with four spotting buffers on both slide surfaces and washed with PBST, were compared. The relative purities of FolE with two spotting buffers, PBS and PBST were similar but the relative purity of Lac I with PBST spotting buffer was nearly 20% higher than that with PBS. Apparently, the nonionic detergent Tween-20 mediates partial denaturation of recombinant proteins and enhances the exposure of His-tags to the Cu2+ or Ni2+ on the slides. This effect may also increase competitive binding of recombinant proteins to histidine-rich contaminant E. coli proteins.",

Relative purities of LacI and FolE with PBST were approximately 80% and 85%, respectively, on the Cu2+/IDA/PEG slide, and approximately 35% and 75%, respectively, on the Ni2+/NTA slides. His-tagged FolE purified with higher relative purity than the recombinant LacI on both slides. Interestingly, relative purities of proteins using the in situ purification method were correlated to the quantities of the corresponding solubly expressed proteins in the E. coli cell lysate. His-tagged FolE expressed solubly at approximately 4.5-fold greater abundance than His-tagged LacI. The difference in relative purity levels of the two recombinant proteins was much greater on the Ni2+/NTA slide (45%) than on the Cu2+/IDA/PEG slide (10%). Apparently, non-specific protein adsorption on the slide surface reduced the purity level. Lower non-specific protein adsorption resulted in less variation in immobilized protein purity. This finding indicates that the consistency of in situ purification of proteins is dependent not only on the surface chemistry of the slide but also on the quantity of the solubly expressed recombinant proteins. It is clear that purity and consistency of in situ purification using Cu2+/IDA/PEG slides are superior to that using Ni2+/NTA chelated slides.",

The immobilization of purified LacI on the slides is not interfered by E. coli endogenous proteins. We determined that the same relative purity levels were achieved with pre-purified LacI compared to unpurified LacI, independent of the slide support. However, the fluorescence intensity for the immobilized LacI on the Cu2+/IDA/PEG was about 1.9-fold greater than that on the Ni2+ slide. When E. coli lysate containing overexpressed recombinant proteins, either FolE or LacI, was applied on the slides, non-specific immobilization of E. coli endogenous proteins on Ni2+/NTA was at least 3-fold more than on Cu2+/IDA/PEG. Lower capacity of the Ni2+/NTA slides could be an effect of reduced affinity, density of reactive groups on slide surface or less accessibility of His-tag by the antibody. The much higher nonspecific interactions of Ni2+/NTA resulted from a difference in the support chemistry and lack of PEG coating. Since the lower fluorescence signal for purified LacI on the Ni2+/NTA compared to the Cu2+/IDA/PEG was observed, the much lower E. coli endogenous signal on Cu2+/IDA/PEG is more likely due to the PEG coating which has been reported and used to prevent nonspecific interactions [38-40].",

The fluorescence intensities representing protein concentrations (FHis-tag) varied considerably among the 90 S. pneumonia proteins (Additional file 1).

Thirty-three proteins were predicted to be membrane proteins. An overview of the in situ purification of these proteins is provided in Table 1. More than 80% of the non-membrane proteins were purified, and 96% of them were calculated to have a purity level higher than 90%. Interestingly, nearly 73% of the membrane proteins were also purified and 79% of them surpassed the 90% purity level. Membrane protein purification is known to be challenging. In our previous study using this protein expression strategy, but a different quantitative detection system, the S-tag [24], more than 50% of the membrane proteins were solubly expressed, 60% of which were purified using a Ni2+/NTA agarose resin. Although our sample numbers were limited for in situ purification (33 proteins), a trend towards more effective membrane protein purification on a slide surface is apparent. A study on in vitro expressed C-terminal GST-tagged proteins, which were obtained by the nucleic acid programmable protein array (NAPPA) method, reported a 93% detection level for membrane proteins [9], and supported our conclusions. The fact that many membrane proteins have domains exposed at the cell surface, makes the ability to effectively purify them important in the context of their antigenicity and role as vaccine candidates for human pathogens.",

The anti-His-tag antibody served as a normalizing factor to compare antigen recognition activities. This is useful because different proteins are immobilized in different quantities. Three types of RF values for a rabbit anti-S. pneumoniae antibody (RAb), a human patient antiserum (RS1) and a healthy human serum (RS0), are provided in the Additional file 1. RF values greater than 1 suggested an interaction between a protein and anti-S. pneumoniae antibodies. A strongly reactive protein in the assay with rabbit antibodies was the manganese ABC transporter adhesion lipoprotein (PsaA) (Figure 3e). This lipoprotein is involved in pathogenicity via its role as a host cell adhesion protein. It is a highly conserved immunogenic protein among many of the 90 S. pneumoniae serotypes [44,45]. Data for the human patient antiserum (S1) were compared to those for a non-infected human serum (S0). Immunogenicity was defined by RF (>1) mentioned above and R (>2), a ratio of S1 to S0. In addition to PsaA, the iron-compound ABC transporter PiuA (SP1872) was also identified as a strong antigen. PiuA is suggested to bind extracellular iron and deliver it to the permease of the ABC transporter. The permease facilitates import of the cation into the cytoplasm. In S. pneumoniae (TIGR4), 10 proteins are annotated as iron ABC transporters. Although mechanisms of iron uptake by S. pneumoniae are not well characterized, iron transporters are known to be strong antigens and required for full virulence [46-48]. PsaA and PiuA are potential vaccine candidates and potential antigenic markers for the diagnosis of S. pneumoniae infections. Both proteins are anchored to the cytoplasmic membrane and exposed at the surface of S. pneumoniae. This study sets the stage for expression and immunogenic analyses of a larger number of ABC transporters and other cell surface-localized proteins, testing a large number of human patient sera. Another interesting application is the design of a microarray chip displaying a range of antigens recognized at various time points during an infection with S. pneumoniae and convalescence of the patient.",
