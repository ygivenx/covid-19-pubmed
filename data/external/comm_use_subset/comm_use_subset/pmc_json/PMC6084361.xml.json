Therefore, elucidating the causes of the greater virulence of PRRSV and the differences between the HP and attenuated pathogenic (AP) strains has become even more important. To this end, several trials have been conducted to identify virulence factors; these studies have resulted in some successes.12, 13 However, changes in virulence and pathogenic mechanisms are difficult to discern. Other than virulence in vivo, many distinctions in the biological aspects of HP\u2010PRRSV and AP\u2010PRRSV have been noted, such as in viral binding and entry into pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs).",

However, exploring individual proteins within the many proteins in cells is difficult. Nonetheless, gradual advancements have come through use of proteomic techniques. Of these, MS\u2010based quantitative proteomic techniques offer the advantage of better accuracy and sensitivity, and have been widely used to analyze host cell responses to viral infection. Among them, liquid chromatography\u2010tandem MS (LC\u2010MS/MS) for label\u2010free quantitative proteomics (LFQP) is an important mass spectrometric tool to detect and quantify large amounts of proteins.20 Compared with quantitative proteomics using stable isotope labeling such as stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture and isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation, LFQP detects greater amounts of proteins and important signaling pathways and networks. The aim of this study was to determine potentially different infection mechanisms used by the HP strain vHuN410 and its derivative attenuated strain vHuN4\u2010F11221, 22 using LFQP.",

PTPN2 also functions in the response to inflammation via NF\u2010\u03baB.32, 33, 34 SIPA1 (H\u2010/A+) is a mitogen\u2010induced GTPase activating protein for Ras\u2010related regulatory proteins. It was related to G\u2010protein signaling and blood\u2010brain barrier and immune cell transmigration: VCAM01/CD106 (cluster of differentiation) signaling pathways.35, 36 C5AR1 (H\u2013/A+) is the receptor for the chemotactic and inflammatory peptide anaphylatoxin C5a, which stimulates chemotaxis, granule enzyme release, intracellular calcium release, and superoxide anion production, participates in the innate and adaptive immune responses to the lectin\u2010induced complement pathway.37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42 Polyribonucleotide 5\u2032\u2010hydroxyl\u2010kinase Clp1 (CLP1) (vH/vA = 0.136) mainly acts as a kinase that binds ATP hosting 5\u2032\u2010hydroxyl\u2010kinase activity, and functions in mRNA cleavage and in siRNA loading onto the RNA\u2010induced silencing complex involved in RNA interference and its destruction.

            "text": "Some proteins related to immunology and inflammation had higher expression in HP\u2010PRRSV\u2010infected cells. Raftlin (vH/vA = 2.554) protein is pivotal for maintenance of lipid rafts and may be involved in regulation of B\u2010cell antigen receptor\u2010mediated signaling. Raftlin promotes binding of double\u2010stranded RNA, activations of B cell receptors and toll\u2010like receptor 3 signaling pathways, and is involved in IL\u201017 production to release pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines. Hence, the higher abundance of raftlin in the HP\u2010PRRSV group compared to the AP\u2010PRRSV and control groups may explain the more severe inflammation triggered by HP\u2010PRRSV.44, 45 IARS (H+/A\u2010), Isoleucyl\u2010tRNA synthetase is a target of autoantibodies in autoimmune diseases.46, 47 VCL (H+/A\u2013), Vinculin is a cytoskeletal protein associated with cell\u2013cell and cell\u2013matrix junctions, and is related to the IL\u20103, IL\u20105, and GM\u2010CSF signaling pathways.48 RAP2A (H+/A\u2010) is a member of the Ras oncogene family, small GTP\u2010binding protein, of which active form interacts with several effectors49, 50, 51 related to the ERK and G protein signaling pathways.52, 53 It was reported that PRRSV could induces prostaglandin E2 production through cyclooxygenase 1 and is related to ERK signaling.54 The differential expression of RAP2A may provide information for future research on the interaction between PRRSV and the ERK signaling pathway. The abundance of RAP2A was lower in AP\u2010PRRSV\u2010infected PAMs than in HP\u2010PRRSV\u2010infected PAMs and control cells, which had similar levels. Thus, we hypothesized that RAP2A was associated with immunization with the attenuated vaccine. IFN\u2010induced transmembrane protein 3, IFITM3 (vH/vA = 2.861), responds to biotic stimulus and had the highest expression levels among these proteins in the HP\u2010PRRSV group, as compared to the proteins identified in the AP\u2010PRRSV group but it was not detected in the control group. In humans, this protein negatively regulates the entry of multiple viruses, including influenza A virus, SARS coronavirus, Marburg virus (MARV), Ebola virus, Dengue virus, West Nile virus (WNV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1, and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), into host cells.55, 56 It could inhibit hemagglutinin protein \u2013mediated entry of influenza virus, GP1, two\u2010mediated viral entry of Marburg virus and Ebola virus, S protein\u2010mediated viral entry of SARS coronavirus, and G protein\u2010mediated viral entry of VSV, thereby playing a critical role in the structural stability and function of vacuolar ATPase (v\u2010ATPase). Establishing physical contact with the v\u2010ATPase of endosomes is critical for proper clathrin localization and is required for v\u2010ATPase to lower the pH in phagocytic endosomes, thus establishing an antiviral state.57 High expression of both HP\u2010PRRSV and AP\u2010PRRSV suggests that IFITM3 may help inhibit PRRSV entry and promote resistance to HP\u2010PRRSV infection. Peptidyl\u2010prolyl cis\u2010trans isomerase B (PPIB, vH/vA = 0.406) has peptidyl\u2010prolyl cis\u2010trans isomerase activity and is involved in protein folding and protein peptidyl\u2010prolyl isomerization, which can accelerate protein folding.58 PPIB is positively regulated by viral genome replication, is involved with the viral processes of hepatitis C virus (HCV), and interacts with and stimulates the RNA\u2010binding activity of HCV NS5B. PPIB is critical for efficient replication of the HCV genome.59 Compared with the control group, PPIB was downregulated in the HP\u2010PRRSV and AP\u2010PRRSV groups. The abundance of PPIB was lower in the HP\u2010PRRSV group than the AP\u2010PRRSV group, suggesting an association with PRRSV replication.",

A search of the GenomRNAi database determined that linked proteins IK (IK cytokine), WD repeat domain 12, dyskerin pseudouridine synthase 1, and adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL) in the green region of Figure 9A shared similar annotations and functioned to decrease expression of NF\u2010\u03baB or IL\u20108,67 which are related to inflammation.44, 45 Hence, further analysis of these linked proteins may help explain differential mechanisms between HP\u2010PRRSV and AP\u2010PRRSV infection. Other proteins in the green\u2010colored region of 9A are reported to influence virus infection. Nucleolar and coiled\u2010body phosphoprotein 1 increases Sindbis virus infection68 and ADSL increases human papilloma virus 16\u2010GFP infection.69 The lower abundance of nucleolar and coiled\u2010body phosphoprotein and ADSL in the HP\u2010PRRSV\u2010infected group may be related to the host immune response repression of PRRSV and may be used by HP\u2010PRRSV during infection to self\u2010upregulate. The red region of Figure 9A contains some linked proteins with some information. Uridine monophosphate synthetase decreases HIV\u20101 infection,70 while programmed cell death 5 decreases HCV replication,71 both downregulate NF\u2010\u03baB expression.67 The lower abundance of these proteins in the HP\u2010PRRSV group suggested that HP\u2010PRRSV escaped inhibition through an unknown mechanism. Myosin\u20109 (MYH9) appears to function in cytokinesis, cell shape, and specialized functions such as secretion and capping.72 MYH9 is an important factor for PRRSV infection and interacts with GP5 of PRRSV,65 although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear because of limited research. As shown by our results, MYH9 was related to VCL in AP\u2010PRRSV and ACTL6 in HP\u2010PRRSV. VCL is an actin filament (F\u2010actin)\u2010binding protein involved in cell\u2013matrix adhesion and cell\u2013cell adhesion in humans, regulation of cell\u2010surface E\u2010cadherin expression, and potentiation of mechanosensing, and may be important in cell morphology and locomotion by promoting binding with actin, alpha\u2010catenin, cadherin, dystroglycan, and ubiquitin protein ligase.73 In HIV research, transient overexpression of VCL reduced the susceptibility of human cells to infection with HIV\u20101 and negatively affected paxillin phosphorylation and limited retroviral infection.74 Just like HIV\u20101, in our study, it was demonstrated that over expression of VCL could inhibit the replication of both HP\u2010PRRSV and the attenuated PRRSV in the mRNA level. There were obvious differences in the inhibiting ability for HP\u2010PRRSV and its attenuated strain. ACTL6A, which is an actin\u2010like protein 6A, is involved in transcriptional activation and repression of select genes by chromatin remodeling (alteration of DNA\u2010nucleosome topology) and mainly functions in chromatin binding and transcription coactivator activities.75 We found that MYH9 may regulate AP\u2010PRRSV and HP\u2010PRRSV infection via different pathways. Through Super Pathways annotation (http://www.genecards.org), VCL and ACTL6A were identified as participants in the IL\u20103, IL\u20105, GM\u2010CSF, and TNF\u2010\u03b1/NF\u2010\u03baB signaling pathways, where they may help with differential mechanisms of PRRSV infection with different virulence.",

The ability of HP\u2010PRRSV HuN4 to induce cell apoptosis is stronger than classical PRRSV (CH\u20101a) in immune organs and lungs of piglets.84 We concluded that HP\u2010PRRSV might interact with CREBBP and decrease IRF\u20103 expression to escape from host immunity and cause severe damage to the cell, highlighting a difference from AP\u2010PRRSV.",

By analyzing detected proteins in HP\u2010infected, AP\u2010PRRSV\u2010infected, and control group, proteins related to the immune response or virus replication were identified that may elucidate unique pathways used by different virulent PRRSVs for cell entry, virus replication, and immune escape mechanisms. Researches on these detected proteins will help with the elucidation of the identity, the expression abundance, and significance of them, future study will be focused on functions of these key membrane proteins to deepen our understanding of differential mechanisms between HP\u2010PRRSV and AP\u2010PRRSV infection.",
