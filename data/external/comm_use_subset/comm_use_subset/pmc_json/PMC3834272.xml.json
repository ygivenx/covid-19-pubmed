Emerging evidence suggests that there is a causal link between lung macrophage mediated inflammation and excessive tissue destruction elicited by variety of exogenous stimuli, i.e., silica and asbestos exposure, virus infection, etc., which will ultimately lead to a failure of inflammation resolution, a key feature that progressively promotes the development of lung fibrosis [5-8]. On the other hand, macrophages are a cell population with high plasticity, and display functional diversity during different stage of inflammatory response [9,10]. The activation state of macrophage can be generally characterized as classical activation (M1 polarization) that is associated with a Th1 immune response, or alternative activation (M2 polarization) that is associated with Th2 immune response [11]. In lung tissue, M1-like macrophages are the first line defense in acute lung injury and are later replaced by M2-like macrophages that contribute to tissue repair and fibrosis. It is generally believed during inflammation, myeloid Ly6Chi monocytes contribute to lung macrophage replenishment [9,12]. The results from recent basic studies indicate that manipulation of macrophage phenotype switch might be a potential target for many macrophage mediated disorders [13-15]. ",

This work provides evidence indicating that MR in mononuclear phagocytes might be a potential target for therapeutic purpose. Based on current evidence, we speculated that pharmacological inhibition of MR with clinically approved drug, may regulate lung macrophage phenotype switching, as well as their progenitors, bone marrow-derived circulating monocytes, and may confer novel therapeutic potential in a murine model of bleomycin-induced acute pulmonary injury and fibrosis.",

For each flow cytometry analysis, the cells were first suspended in 0.4% trypan blue in PBS, and the number of live and dead cells was measured using an automatic cell counter (CounterStarTM, Rui Yu Biotechnology Co.,Ltd, Shanghai, China). By this method, the number of live cells in each sample is more than 95%. For subsequent flow cytometry analysis, the cells were incubated with anti-mouse F4/80-PE-Cy5 (clone BM8), anti-mouse CD11c- PE-Cy7 (clone N418) and anti-mouse CD206-PE (clone C068C2). Following incubation, flow cytometry analysis was carried out. For immunophenotypic analysis of interstitial macrophages (IMs), lung single-cell suspensions were prepared from lavaged lung (from which the BALF was harvested) to reduce the contamination of AM. In brief, the lower lobe of right lung were minced and incubated with 0.1 mg/mL collagenase solution (type I, Sigma-Aldrich) at 37\u00b0C for 60 min. After filtering through 40 \u03bcm nylon mesh, similar procedure to remove dead cells was carried out as did during sample preparation for AM analysis, then the cell suspension was stained anti-mouse F4/80-FITC (clone BM8), anti-mouse CD11c-PE-Cy7 (clone N418) and anti-mouse CD206-PE (clone C068C2). Following incubation, samples were analyzed with flow cytometer.

In addition, the therapeutic efficacy of drug intervention targeting this system has been reported in bleomycin-induced lung injury models [26-31]. Zhao and coworker first demonstrated the therapeutical potential of spironolactone in ameliorating bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis [32], which is also supported by a recent study [33]. A growing body of evidence suggests that manipulation of the mononuclear phagocyte phenotype switching could be a feasible approach to alter the severity and persistence of pulmonary injury and fibrosis in experimental models [34-36]. It has been demonstrated that MR plays an important role in regulating myeloid cell phenotype switching in different disease conditions [16,37-40]. To our knowledge, the role of mononuclear cell MR in mediating acute lung injury induced pulmonary fibrosis has not been addressed. The present work confirmed that MR antagonism by a clinically approved drug, spironolactone, could attenuate bleomycin-induced acute lung injury and fibrosis. Specifically, MR inhibition partially attenuates Ly6Chi monocyte expansion in circulating compartment and normalizes disturbed balance of macrophage polarization in alveolar compartment, leading to reduced alveolitis and collagen deposition in lung tissue. These findings highlight mononuclear phagocyte MR as a promising target for ameliorating acute lung injury and profibrotic response in lungs.",

            "text": "On the contrary, during acute lung inflammatory response, circulating monocytes have an important impact on the lung macrophage dynamics. In general, recent studies are in agreement with the notion that following injury, there is an increased accumulation of M2-like mononuclear cells in alveoli [10,49-52]. Moreover, in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a skewing of alveolar macrophages from an M1 to M2 phenotype has been observed [50,53]. However, with regard to the origin of these M2-like cells, some controversy existed. In an endotoxin-induced lung inflammation model, Maus and coworkers showed that despite a rapid recruitment of monocytes in lung tissue, the resident alveolar macrophage pool remained static throughout the duration of inflammation and the expansion of the lung macrophage pool was mainly mediated by an influx of the circulating monocytes, followed by their differentiation into tissue macrophages [46]. In agreement with this finding, recently Osterholzer et al [54], using a gene-targeted alveolar injury model, demonstrated an increased exudate macrophages and their progenitors, Ly6Chi monocytes, both exhibiting M2 polarization in alveoli. In another study [36], Gibbons and colleagues adoptively transferred Ly6Chi monocytes into bleomycin-treated mice during the progressive phase of lung fibrosis, which led to an exacerbation of disease progression and an increased accumulation of M2-like macrophage in the lung. Surprisingly, these alternatively activated macrophages were host derived and not from the donor Ly6Chi monocytes. As a corollary, regardless of their origins, our current knowledge points to a general scheme of their relationship: initially, acute lung injury induces a rapid expansion and infiltrating Ly6Chi monocytes in lung tissue, which contributes to a paralleled increase of M2-like macrophages (by direct differentiation or by paracrine effects) in alveolar compartment, and the severity and persistency of M2 polarization in alveolar macrophages would ultimately influence inflammation resolution and fibrosis.

Although we did not use a monocyte-targeted approach to suppress Ly6Chi monocytosis, it is likely that spironolactone would also exert its major pharmacological effect on circulating monocyte pool since the efficacy of orally administered drug is significantly compromised by its inability to reach alveolar space at an appropriate concentration [55]. Additionally, because evidence shown that monocyte infiltration would facilitates alveolar neutrophil emigration and determines the ongoing neutrophil influx in the persistent phase of acute lung injury [56-58], suppression of Ly6Chi monocytosis by spironolactone would concomitantly lead to a decreased tissue accumulation of neutrophils, which is also observed in our study.

            "text": "The present work has the following limitations. First, because spironolactone has anti-androgen effect, the observed effects of this work cannot be totally ascribed to MR antagonism. Indeed, there is a sex discrepancy in bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, and estrogen may have protective effect on this model [59,60]. In this regard, MR knockout mice are preferred to address this issue. Second, we did not observed significant changes in lung interstitial macrophages by spironolactone. Previous study showed this population might have a role in limiting inflammation and fibrosis [61]. Thus it remains unclear whether CD206 is an appropriate M2 marker for this population as recent study showed that the change of CD206 is modest after bleomycin challenge [51], or this population is insensitive to MR inhibition, or due to enzymatic digestion-induced surface marker loss during sample preparation, a commonly encountered technical issue. Third, due to the wide distribution of MR in the body, the mechanistical explanation of global MR antagonism is fairly complex. For example, aldosterone has been implicated in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension [62], and spironolactone has been shown to attenuate experimental pulmonary hypertension via MR inhibition in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells [63].Admittedly, bleomycin is also a frequently used tool drug to induce pulmonary hypertension [64,65]. The downregulation of \u03b1-SMA by spironolactone observed in this study, also support an anti-fibrotic effect of spironolactone on fibroblasts. Moreover, the functional expression of MR has been demonstrated in neutrophils [66], which may also participate in spironolactone induced amelioration of lung fibrosis, as shown by reduced neutrophil count in BALF. Thus, in addition to its effect on mononuclear phagocytes, the mechanisms underlying therapeutic effect of systemic use of spironolactone on bleomycin-induced lung injury is multifactorial. Forth, it seems obscure to interpret the effect of MR antagonism on alveolar macrophage polarization, since macrophages lacking myeloid MR exhibit alternative activation (M2 polarization), whereas our results showed that MR inhibition could reduce alveolar M2 polarization. It should be noted the long-established binary classification of macrophage in terms of classical (M1) and alternative activation (M2) is based on in vitro studies [67]. Indeed, a recent study demonstrated eplerenone, another clinically approved MR antagonist, promotes alternative activation in human monocyte-derived macrophages [68]. However, macrophages in vivo maintain their plasticity and can alter their phenotype based on the microenvironment, including cytokine milieu among other factors [10]. As pointed early, drug administration via oral route, cannot reach alveolar space at an appropriate concentration. Therefore, the alterations in alveolar macrophage polarization state cannot be ascribed to MR antagonist\u2019s direct effect. It is conceivable that suppression of inflammatory (Ly6Chi subset) monocyte expansion should be the direct effect by spironolactone, which ameliorates lung injury via the \u201cLy6Chi directed pulmonary alterative activation\u201d mechanism [36]. Thus, future monocyte-targeted approaches, as well as in vitro studies are warranted to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying suppressed Ly6Chi monocytosis by MR antagonism. Finally, the algorithms used in this study are relatively simple, and may inadvertently contain dendritic cells and eosinophils. More rigorous and sophisticated algorithms have been published and suggested [51,69].",

Our findings highlight MR as a potential therapeutic target to inhibit Ly6Chi monocyte-mediated inflammatory response in acute lung injury and fibrosis.",
