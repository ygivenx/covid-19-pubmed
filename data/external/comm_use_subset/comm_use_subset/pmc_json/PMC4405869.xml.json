How governments, hospitals, universities and communities respond will determine to what extent the epidemic becomes widespread within the country, region and the world. Princess Nourah University is the world\u2019s largest all-female university. It is a well-resourced institution, situated on a new campus, and home to more than 40,000 students and approximately 5,000 faculty and staff. Operating in the new campus for less than a decade, the university is working hard to establish itself and to have all departments functioning effectively.

Therefore a rapid and effective containment of hospital staff including students should be a priority [8]. It was decided while the cases in the city were disseminated over all of the hospitals, to remove our students for the last week of clinical work and bring them back to the clinical skills lab for more practice with Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and infection control procedures. Since then, the Ministry of Health has concentrated the confirmed cases of MERS-CoV into designated hospitals.

Indeed at the time about 10% of students were wearing paper surgical masks during class. When asked why they were wearing masks, several students answered that they were \u201cpreventing corona\u201d. When asked if they meant that they were sick, they answered that they were not, but they did not want to get corona from other students. At the time, there were rumours on social media sites claiming that the university had several cases of the virus. This rumour was likely untrue as it was never validated by the MOH, the WHO or any credible source. Unfortunately, students were observed touching elevator buttons and then adjusting their mask, removing their masks to cough, and wearing a single paper mask throughout a 6 hour day.",
