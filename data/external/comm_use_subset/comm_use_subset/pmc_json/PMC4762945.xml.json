Before 2013, filovirus outbreaks in human populations were restricted to remote areas in Central Africa and were associated with less than 500 cases. The Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak in Guinea in 2013 resulted for the first time in viral spread from rural to densely populated areas and had severe consequences: The Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic affected major cities in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone and caused 11,312 deaths (as of 11 October 2015). Moreover, secondary infections occurred in countries not hit by the epidemic, including the USA and Spain. Thus, filoviruses constitute a global health threat.",

The role of bats as a natural reservoir for filoviruses is supported by the (i) detection of filoviruses in multiple, geographically dispersed bat species (on serological and nucleic acid level), (ii) isolation of MARV-like viruses from apparently healthy Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus, so far EBOV-like viruses were not isolated from bats), and (iii) the observation that experimentally infected bats shed the virus but do not develop clinical symptoms [3, 7\u201316]. The association of filoviruses with bats does not come as a surprise, since also for other emerging zoonotic viruses multiple bat species have been proven or are believed to serve as a natural reservoir (e.g. reviewed in [17, 18]). However, the interactions of filoviruses with bat cells are incompletely understood. In particular, the processes underlying filovirus entry into bat cells are largely unknown.",

In addition, the GP is a virulence factor [20, 21]. The filovirus GP is synthesized as a precursor protein (GP0), which is extensively modified by N- and O-glycans and processed by subtilisin-like proprotein convertases (especially furin) during passage through the secretory pathway [22]. Cleavage occurs between the surface unit, GP1, which contains the receptor binding domain (RBD) and a mucin-like domain (MLD), and the transmembrane unit, GP2, which anchors the GP in the viral envelope and harbors the membrane fusion machinery (Fig 1B). Although the cleavage motifs for proprotein-convertases are found in all filovirus GPs (RESTV-GP contains a non-classical furin recognition motif [22]), processing of EBOV-GP by these enzymes is dispensable for robust viral spread in cell culture and in the host [23, 24].",

In addition, signaling factors like members of the TAM (Tyro3/Axl/Mer) family of tyrosine kinase receptors and \u03b15\u03b21-Integrin have been shown to promote filovirus entry [29\u201331]. Upon uptake of EBOV particles into endosomes, the activity of two-pore channels (TPCs, endosomal calcium channels) [32] and GP processing by endosomal pH-dependent cysteine proteases cathepsin B/L are believed to be required for the entry cascade to progress [33\u201335], at least in several cell culture systems. Cleavage removes the MLD and allows binding of the RBD to NPC1 [36, 37]. Subsequently, an incompletely understood trigger is required to start the GP2-driven fusion of the viral and the endosomal membrane, which allows for the release of the viral genetic information in the host cell cytoplasm. Whether the same molecular mechanisms underlie filovirus entry into bat cells is largely unknown, although LLOV entry into human and NHP cells has been reported to depend on NPC1 and cathepsins [38].",

Details on the cloning strategy (e.g. restriction sites and primer sequences) are available upon request. Expression plasmids (pCAGGS-based) for Marburg virus (MARV, strain Musoke; DQ217792.1) and Lloviu virus (LLOV; JF828358.1) were kindly provided by S. Becker (Philipps-University Marburg, Marburg/Germany) and A. Takada (Hokkaido University Research Center for Zoonosis Control, Sapporo/Japan), respectively [49, 50]. In addition, mutant EBOV-GP in which the furin cleavage motif has been destroyed (EBOV-GP(\u0394Cleav)) or most of the amino acid (aa) residues comprising the mucin-like domain (MLD, aa residues 309\u2013486) have been deleted (EBOV-GP(\u0394MLD)) were constructed by overlap extension PCR from the plasmid containing the wildtype (wt) EBOV-GP sequence. The expression plasmid for the glycoprotein (G) of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV, Indiana strain, VSV-G; AJ318514.1) was generated by inserting the VSV-G ORF into the pCG1 expression vector and has been used in previous studies [39, 42, 51, 52].",

Those fruit bat species are either a proven filovirus reservoir (Rousettus aegyptiacus for MARV) or are in the discussion as one (Hypsignathus monstrosus for MARV and EBOV, Eidolon helvum for EBOV) [14, 55]. Since it was not possible to obtain a cell line from Franquet's epauletted fruit bat (Epomops franqueti), another species of fruit bat linked to filoviruses (MARV and EBOV) [55], we instead used a cell line from a closely related species (Epomops buettikoferi). The overall geographic distribution of the four fruit bat species ranges from rather concentrated habitats at the southern coast of West Africa (Epomops buettikoferi) to a nearly complete coverage of the area between Sub-Saharan Africa and South Africa (Fig 1C) [56], and overlaps with sites of reported filovirus outbreaks in humans.",

First, we normalized the VSVpp for comparable transduction of HEK-293T cells and then used the particles for transduction of primate and bat cell lines (Fig 2A). For Vero cells, the transduction mediated by filovirus GPs was roughly comparable to that measured for HEK-293T cells. However, the efficiency of entry mediated by the EBOV2014-GP was notably lower (~80%) than for the EBOV1976-GP, which is in line with previous results obtained for another African green monkey-derived cell line, COS-7 [47]. EpoNi/22.1 bat cells were also comparably susceptible to transduction by all GPs, although LLOV-GP-mediated entry was slightly increased (Fig 2A). For the remaining three bat cell lines, marked differences in transduction by GPs representing different filovirus species were observed. Transduction of RoNi/7 and HypNi/1.1 cells by BDBV-and TAFV-GP bearing particles, respectively, was markedly reduced compared to transduction driven the other GPs (Fig 2A). Even more profound differences were observed for EidNi/41 cells. The GPs of SUDV and LLOV facilitated robust transduction of the cells while both EBOV-GPs tested (1976 and 2014) as well as BDBV-GP failed to mediate entry into this cell line. TAFV-, RESTV- and MARV-GP-bearing VSVpp displayed intermediate transduction efficiency. Finally, when undiluted VSVpp were used for inoculation of EidNi/41 cells, we could detect low levels of luciferase activity, indicating that also EBOV- and BDBV-GP are capable of mediating entry into cells of Eidolon helvum, albeit with low efficacy (Fig 2B). In sum, the GPs of filovirus species differ widely in their ability to transduce target cells of certain reservoir species.",

The GP mutants facilitated entry into human, primate and fruit bat cell lines with comparable efficiency as GP wt (Fig 3). Moreover, transduction of HEK-293T and one of the four fruit bat cell lines by particles bearing the MLD-deletion mutant was slightly higher than that measured for GP wt. These findings are in keeping with data documented for human cell lines [58\u201360] although previous studies documented a more robust effect, possibly due to differences in the pseudotyping system. Thus, furin cleavage motif and MLV are dispensable for GP-mediated transduction of human, primate and bat cells.",

To this end, we incubated human (HEK-293T) and fruit bat cell lines with inhibitors interrupting discrete steps of the entry process before pseudotypes harboring either of the filovirus GPs were added. We chose the fruit bat cell lines EpoNi/22.1 and EidNi/41 for these studies since they either showed a comparable susceptibility for transduction by all tested GPs or displayed varying susceptibility depending on which particular filovirus GP was used, respectively. For EidNi/41 cells, we only included VSVpp harboring SUDV-, TAFV-, RESTV-, MARV- and LLOV-GP, since transduction of pseudotypes decorated with EBOV1976-, EBOV2014- or BDBV-GP was only slightly above the limit of detection (Fig 1B). On the side of the host cell factors we chose inhibitors (Table 2) that targeted cellular lectins (mannan), endosomal acidification and thus indirectly cysteine protease activity (ammonium chloride, bafilomycin A1), cysteine proteases (E-64d; MDL28170), serine proteases (camostat mesylate), two-pore channels (tetrandrine) and NPC1 (U18666A, a compound that was recently shown to directly bind to NPC1 [61]).

Inhibition of GP-mediated entry into bat cells by ammonium chloride, bafilomycin A1, tetrandrine E-64d and MDL28170 seemed to be slightly less efficient relative to human cells but no clear differences were observed. In comparison, transduction mediated by VSV-G was reduced only by agents interfering with endosomal acidification (Fig 4), in accordance with published data [70]. Finally, entry of VSVpp harboring NiV-F/G, which were used as an additional control, was not inhibited by any of the compounds tested (Fig 4). NiV-F needs to undergo proteolytic cleavage by the cysteine proteases cathepsin B or L. However, this step does not take place during the entry process but rather during transport of F protein to the plasma membrane and was not targeted under the experimental conditions chosen here [71].

This is highlighted by the currently ongoing EVD epidemic in West Africa, where for the first time a filovirus outbreak spread from remote to densely populated areas. Bats constitute a natural reservoir for filoviruses [3, 12, 15, 55, 72] but the interaction of filoviruses with bat cells remains largely uncharacterized. The present study addressed the question whether filovirus entry into cells from the natural reservoir, fruit bats, relies on the same molecular mechanisms as entry into human and NHP cells. We found that GPs of all filovirus species are able to mediate entry into bat cells but differ in their efficacy. Furthermore, GP processing by the host protease furin and presence of the MLD were dispensable for efficient entry into bat cells, while blockade of host factors known to be important for filovirus entry into human cells (including cysteine proteases, two pore channels and NPC1) also reduced entry into bat cells. Taken together, our results indicate that filovirus entry into human and fruit bat cells relies on the same host cell factors, although the capacity to engage those factors seems to differ among the GPs of the filovirus species.",

Our results point towards pronounced differences in susceptibility of fruit bat cell lines to entry driven by filovirus GPs: Cells from the kidney of a Buettikofer's epauletted fruit bat (Epomops buettikoferi, EpoNi/22.1) were comparably susceptible to transduction mediated by all filovirus GPs tested. In contrast, cells from the Hammer-headed fruit bat (Hypsignathus monstrosus, HypNi/1.1) and the Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus, RoNi/7), displayed a reduced susceptibility for TAFV-GP- and BDBV-GP-driven pseudotype entry, respectively. The results obtained for transduction of RoNi/7, HypNi/1.1 and EpoNi/22.1 by EBOV-, SUDV-, RESTV- and MARV-GP are in keeping with and expand previous studies [39, 42, 47]. More strikingly, we observed remarkable differences when GP-mediated transduction of a cell line was investigated that has been established from the kidney of a Straw-colored fruit bat (Eidolon helvum, EidNi/41). VSVpp decorated with either of the two EBOV-GPs or BDBV-GP failed to appreciably transduce these cells, while all other GPs mediated moderate (TAFV-, RESTV-, MARV-GP) to robust (SUDV-, LLOV-GP) transduction. During the revision of this manuscript Ng and colleagues reported inefficient EBOV-GP-driven entry into cells from the straw-colored fruit bat as compared to cells from other bats [73]. The inefficient entry was linked to a single amino acid polymorphism within the NPC1 molecule of this particular bat species [73]. These findings and the results of the present study indicate that filovirus entry into reservoir cells can be restricted at the stage of NPC1 usage. Moreover, they suggest that GPs representing different filovirus species might engage bat NPC1 orthologues slightly differently.",

In addition, we were able to confirm previous data that indicated reduced transduction of NHP cells by EBOV2014-GP compared to EBOV1976-GP [47]. This observation is in line with the finding that cynomolgus macaques experimentally infected with the Makona strain of EBOV (i.e. EBOV2014) showed delayed disease progression compared to animals inoculated with EBOV1976 [74]. Collectively, these findings highlight that filovirus GPs can differ markedly in their capacity to mediate entry into cell lines of various species. This finding reflects the diverse nature of the different filovirus species that, despite their taxonomical relatedness, may engage certain host cell-encoded entry factors with different efficiencies.",

Nevertheless, these elements are dispensable for entry into human cells lines and, in case of the furin cleavage site, for viral spread and pathogenesis in the host [23, 24, 57\u201360]. A scenario accounting for these discrepant findings could be that these elements are required for entry into reservoir but not NHP and human cells. The present study shows that this is not the case, since neither inactivation of the cleavage site nor deletion of the MLD appreciably altered transduction of the fruit bat cell lines investigated. One could speculate that the MLD is required for efficient spread in the host, potentially by modulating immune recognition of GP, and is thus present in all filovirus GPs. Why the GP motif for processing by furin or other proprotein convertases is conserved requires further investigation.",

We observed a profound decrease in GP-mediated transduction when endosomal acidification (inhibited by ammonium chloride or bafilomycin A1), calcium-dependent two-pore channels (inhibited by tetrandrine), cysteine proteases such as cathepsins and calpain (inhibited by E-64d and MDL28170) were blocked. Similarly, U18666A treatment, which induces an NPC1 knock-out phenotype, reduced entry into all cell lines tested, in line with the published finding that LLOV-GP requires NPC1 for entry into bat cell lines [38]. In general, no appreciable differences in the effectiveness of the inhibitors between human (HEK-293T) and fruit bat (EpoNi/22.1 and EidNi/41) cells were observed. A slightly less efficient block of GP-mediated entry into bat cells by agents interfering with endosomal acidification as well as the activity of TPCs and cysteine proteases might result from species specific differences in the drug targets. Additionally, it cannot be ruled out that the usage of more specific cysteine protease inhibitors would reveal subtle differences in protease choice of EBOV in human and bat cells. Finally, there were no obvious differences between bat cells that either showed a comparable (EpoNi/22.1) or differential (EidNi/41) susceptibility for transduction by the seven GPs. These observations suggest that all filovirus GPs depend on the same host cell factors for entry into human and fruit bat cell lines.",

The most straightforward explanation for the inability of mannan to block entry in the present study is thus that none of the cell lines tested expressed mannose-specific lectins able to augment filovirus entry. Camostat mesylate inhibits activation of influenza A virus and coronavirus glycoproteins by the type II transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 [76\u201379]. Filovirus GPs are activated by the pH dependent endosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin B and L, at least in several target cell lines [34, 35], and that lack of inhibition of GP-driven entry by camostat mesylate was thus not unexpected.",
