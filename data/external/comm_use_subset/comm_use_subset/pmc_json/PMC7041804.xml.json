            "text": "The outer surfaces of mammalian cells are decorated with a complex array of branched carbohydrates attached to membrane proteins or lipids, collectively referred to as glycans [1]. Structural diversity of these molecules leads to a broad spectrum of biological functions, where glycans play key roles in protein folding, modulation of immune responses and wound healing, to name a few [2, 3]. Dysregulation of glycosylation is also central to the initiation and progression of various human diseases. For example, early stages of cancer are characterized by impairment of normal glycosylation pathways that ultimately produce incomplete glycan structures [4]. Conversely, changes in gene expression in advanced cancers can lead to the de novo synthesis of unique glycans [5]. Collectively, this aberrant glycosylation can inhibit immune-mediated destruction of tumor cells and induce signaling pathways that promote carcinogenesis, tumor metastasis and contribute to drug resistance [6]. Despite the link between defective glycosylation and malignancy, the glycome of many tumor types remains largely unknown and, along with it, a wealth of potentially novel targets for therapies [3, 4]. Molecules capable of distinguishing altered expression of glycans on malignant cells represent powerful biochemical tools to probe pathways important to cancer biology, and in some cases also disrupting cell functions to serve as potential therapeutics.",

Lectins are found in organismal proteomes [7, 8], and secretomes [9, 10] across all kingdoms of life, and have a variation of ligand selectivity that rivals\u2019 that of antibodies. In many cases mammalian cell-surface binding of lectins, and subsequent intracellular transport, can modulate a manifold of biologic pathways with remarkable potency [11]. For instance, less than 2 mg of ricin, a ribosome-inactivating lectin produced by the castor bean plant [12], is sufficient to kill an average sized human. A more positive example is the human mannose-binding lectin (MBL), a component of the innate immune system, which is responsible for binding to the high-mannose glycoprotein coat of pathogenic microbes and apoptotic cells to promote their destruction and removal [13].",

For example, a mannose-binding lectin from red-algae has nanomolar inhibitory activity against HIV, hepatitis C, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and Ebola viruses, while displaying no deleterious effects on human immune cells and rodent animal models [14]. In one notable study, mice treated with a high-dose of a recombinant mannose-specific lectin survived otherwise fatal Ebola viral infection and became immune to virus re-challenge [15]. Interestingly, an individual human\u2019s expression level of MBL also affects incidence and severity of certain cancers [16], suggesting that, in addition to their antiviral activity, lectins may also play central roles in tumor prevention and therapy.",

A master cell bank was formed and kept at -80\u00b0C for sub-culturing and 5 L IPTG-induced batch fermentation. The harvested cell paste from fermentation was combined with PBS and protease inhibitor cocktail (SigmaFAST\u2122 EDTA free) and disrupted in a microfluidizer. The resulting lysate was then clarified via centrifugation and loaded onto a Co2+ column, which bound to the recombinant protein\u2019s poly-His tag through ion-exchange chromatography. The protein was eluted with 150 mM imidazole and purified by FPLC fractionation. Purity was verified using standard SDS-PAGE methods. The fractions were dialyzed against PBS to remove remaining imidazole and flowed through an affinity column for endotoxin removal (Sartorius Sartobind\u00ae), yielding a verified endotoxin concentration of 0.105 EU/mL (Charles River Laboratories) in a stock containing 2.76 mg/mL of recombinant protein. Aliquots of the lectin were used for experiments within three days of being thawed. The lectin in PBS buffer was colloidally stable up to one week at 4\u00b0C.",

Notably, species-rich rainforest root communities [17][21] comprise mutualists, saprophytes, pathogens [22], and even predators (fungi that use lectins to trap and eat nematodes [23]). This diversity suggests that some of the identified proteins in this community may be involved in between-species interactions [24], and potentially serve as components of defensive or offensive systems that may have co-evolved with rival organisms. The first lectin we examined for functional properties was based on a sequence obtained from the roots of Virola surinamensis (Myristicaceae).

Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments confirm that recombinant ML6 binds to monosaccharide mannose haptens with high affinity (Kd = 1.5 \u03bcM; S2 Fig). Although the species origin of this lectin is unknown, a mycologic assay found that it inhibits the growth of the pathogenic plant fungus Mycosphaerella zeae (S3 Fig). This antifungal activity suggests ML6 may be produced by a mutualist that defends tree seedlings from pathogenic fungi or competes in some other ecological context. Interestingly, ML6 has only 39% overall amino acid identity to known proteins (NCBI protein and translated nucleotide databases), while the additional 80 lectins in our library have <60% amino acid identity with sequences in any database. This low identity suggests ML6, along with the other lectins in the library, come from species fairly distant from taxa with characterized genomes, and thus may have unique protein conformations and potentially novel biochemical functions.",

            "text": "These physiochemical features of ML6 are roughly similar to that of many legume lectins, which generally range in molecular weight from 25\u201330 kDa and are characterized by dome-shaped globular structures composed largely of antiparallel \u03b2-sheets [8]. However, ML6 exhibits a number of unique and important differences. Most known \u03b2-protein lectins display 1\u20133 monosaccharide binding sites, and associate into homo-dimers, homo-tetramers, or homo-octamers to increase their effective valency [26\u201328]. These arrangements enhance the capacity, potency, and specificity of lectins to bind their sugar targets, particularly complex N-linked glycans [29]. Uniquely, ML6 possesses six mannose-binding domains, all of which have divergent sequences relative to each other and are spaced in close proximity (22\u201325 amino acids separate domains; Fig 2A). This domain number and arrangement are in stark contrast to well-known plant mannose-binding lectins like Galanthus nivalis agglutinin 1 and 2 (GNA-1/2), which possess two mannose-binding domains in the monomer that are separated by ~50 residues [30, 31]. Thus, ML6 is unusual in its ecological and taxonomic (albeit unknown) origin, monomeric composition, and diversity of mannose-binding domain sequences.",

For example, garlic bulb (Allium sativum) lectins were found to have inhibitory effects on lymphoma cells at concentrations >0.5 mg/mL [33]. Similarly, lectins isolated from the plant Clematis montana displayed potent antineoplastic activity towards human breast, ovarian, and liver cancer cell lines [34]. With this background in mind, we screened the toxicity of ML6 against a panel of human cancer cells and normal cell line controls. Results (Fig 3A and Table 1) demonstrate that ML6 elicits picomolar toxicity toward five of the tested cell lines, including A549, OVCAR-3, HeLa, T24 and Caco-2. Remarkably, for the most sensitive cell line in the panel, A549, ML6 was active even at femtomolar concentrations (IC50 = 40 fM; 1.2 x10-9 mg/mL). Competitive inhibition assays demonstrate that the activity of ML6 is critically impaired upon co-incubation with excess mannose (S5 Fig), suggesting mannose-binding is fundamental to ML6\u2019s mechanism of action. Active concentrations of ML6 yielded a stark change in A549 cell phenotype after 24 hours of incubation, characterized by the presence of large intracellular vacuoles and contraction of the cell membrane (Fig 3B, Top). These morphologic changes were not observed for the ML6-insensitive MCF-7 cell line treated under similar conditions (Fig 3B, Bottom). Taken together, these results support our assertion that ML6 avidly interacts with monosaccharide mannose haptens, and suggests that binding to mannose residues on cell surface glycans is a prerequisite for ML6-mediated anticancer activity.",

Conversely, ML6 was found to be inactive towards both of the tested non-mucosal cancer cell lines (MCF-7, Jurkat), as well as three non-cancerous controls (Fig 3A and Table 1). Calculating selectivity indices for each cell line (SI; Table 1) reveals that ML6 is >100\u201310,000 times more active towards mucosal cancers than non-malignant cells. This mucosa-specific activity of the lectin is perhaps not surprising given the dense glycocalyx of mucosal epithelium, where surface displayed glycans operate as key intermediaries between cells of the respiratory, urogenital and gastrointestinal tracts and the external environment. For example, mucin-type glycoproteins expressed on epithelia provide important defenses against toxins and pathogenic microorganisms [35]. Abnormal expression of these mucins is a common phenotype of epithelial malignancies, where they play central roles in cancer pathogenesis [36, 37].",

This was performed by hybridizing ML6 to an array of 300 different glycans that encompass both synthetic polysaccharides as well as natural N-glycans, glycolipids, human milk oligosaccharides, and tandem epitopes. This analysis revealed high-specificity of the lectin towards five short, mannose-rich N-glycans (Fig 5A and S2 Table). Among these putative targets is a conserved structural subunit: GlcNAc-\u03b2-1,2-Man-\u03b1-1,3-Man-\u03b2-1,4-GlcNAc-\u03b2-1,4-GlcNAc. Given that this carbohydrate pentamer is present in the stem of all human glycans, our results suggest ML6 does not target a unique tumor glycan, but more likely that the accessibility of this motif is increased on aberrant and incomplete glycans overexpressed on the surfaces of malignant cells. Further supporting this assertion is the fact that ML6 did not bind to glycans with identical carbohydrate backbones, but which were terminated with sialic acid (Fig 5B). Sialic acids are typically found terminating the branches of fully formed glycans and have been reported to \u2018hide\u2019 mannose antigens on the surfaces of cells from immune-activating MBLs [39]. Taken together this suggests that ML6 may differentiate healthy and malignant cells by binding GlcNAc-\u03b2-1,2-Man-\u03b1-1,3-Man-\u03b2-1,4-GlcNAc-\u03b2-1,4-GlcNAc units on na\u00efve and incomplete glycans produced by mis-regulated glycosylation pathways in tumors. This conserved motif of N-glycans may also be more sterically shielded on \u2018healthy\u2019 hyperbranched glycan structures capped with terminating sialic acid residues. In addition, ML6 did not bind to a short glycan in which mannose disaccharides are joined through an \u03b16-linkage (see fourth entry from the top in Fig 5B), while a similar backbone with \u03b13-linked subunits was a target for the lectin (see fourth entry from the top in Fig 5A). This glycan specificity demonstrates that stereochemical orientation of the divalent mannose moiety in the carbohydrate backbone is also integral to ML6 binding activity.",

Our results indicate that there is a heretofore untapped reservoir of potentially useful lectins to be discovered in this fashion. Our approach is a notable departure from previous efforts as we used de novo transcriptome assembly, bioinformatic screening, and DNA synthesis to bypass constraints of protein purification or focal gene approaches [46]. Using such methods in combination with bioinformatic analyses, oligonucleotide synthesis, and recombinant protein production can greatly increase the ease of discovery and testing of novel lectins and other useful proteins.",

            "text": "The first lectin synthesized using this approach, ML6, displayed both anti-fungal and anti-cancer activity, with follow-up characterization of the latter. Confocal microscopy experiments demonstrate that ML6 occupies several extra- and intra-cellular domains in lectin-sensitive cell lines, including at the membrane, dissemination in the cytoplasm, and localization to the nuclear envelope. This distribution pattern may indicate both surface and intracellular locations where ML6 elicits pleiotropic anticancer effects. For example, programmed cell death occurs through extrinsic or intrinsic pathways: death\u2010receptor (extrinsic) mediated apoptosis triggered by the ligation of Fas or other plasma membrane receptors, and a mitochondria\u2010dependent (intrinsic) pathway induced by the release of cytochrome c. A number of recent studies have shown that plant lectins can modulate extrinsic apoptosis signaling in cancer cells by activating cell surface death receptors that include TNF, TRAIL and FasL [47]. Other plant lectins, such as the legume derived ConA, potentiate release of cytochrome c from mitochondrial membranes to trigger intrinsic apoptosis in melanoma and liver cancer cells [48, 49]. Given these examples, it is possible that ML6 acts similarly to ligate cell-surface death receptors or interact with intracellular mediators to stimulate extrinsic and/or intrinsic apoptotic signaling. This assertion is collectively supported by our data showing that ML6 consists of a \u03b2-sheet rich structure (Fig 2), like that of many antitumor legume lectins, elicits its cytotoxic effects at incredibly low concentrations (Table 1) and induces apoptosis in cells over a time period commensurate with its membrane and cytoplasmic localization (Figs 3 & 4).",

            "text": "In addition to its potential to directly induce extrinsic and/or intrinsic apoptosis, ML6 may also bind glycan intermediates in the canonical N-glycosylation pathway to alter glycoprotein folding and potentiate cell stress pathways. In fact, microarray data (Fig 5) demonstrates that ML6 specifically binds to mannose-rich polysaccharide intermediates central to the eukaryote N-glycan biosynthesis pathway [50]. Intracellular abundance of this glycan in the pathway is altered by the Man2a1 enzyme, as well as substrates, co-factors, and nearby enzymes in the biosynthetic process [51]. Recent studies have identified a link between mutations affecting Man2a1 and tumorigenesis [52, 53], adding to a growing body of evidence indicating abnormal N-glycosylation processes can drive malignancy. Given this link, there is clinical interest in developing protein-based therapies in oncology that target and inhibit N-glycosylation pathways [54]. Yet, the development of therapeutic antibodies against N-linked glycans remains challenging due to their limited valency, insufficient sensitivity and poor intracellular penetration [54]. Novel and highly specific mannose-binding lectins, like ML6, which can access intracellular compartments may therefore represent pioneering new therapeutic tools for diseases where N-glycosylation has gone awry.",
