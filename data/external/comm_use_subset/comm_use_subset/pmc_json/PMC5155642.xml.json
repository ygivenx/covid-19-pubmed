Unlike humans, these thymus glands only fully develop in late juvenile birds and persist throughout adult life.30 In contrast, the plasmacytoid B cells essential for antibody\u2010mediated response mature in a specialized organ called the bursa of Fabricius (BF), located in the cloaca, but the BF involutes or disappears early in the juvenile bird stage, that is at the onset of feather growth.27, 30 The transition from the loss of the BF to the full functionality of the thymus results in a period of a weakened immunity in these avian species; thus migrating juvenile birds with a high viral load become an infection source of different pathogens.27, 31\n",

Thus, it has been observed that the pH stability of IAV subtypes evolves differently depending on host type and the route of transmission.33 As most transmission of avian IAV in aquatic birds is through the oral\u2013faecal route and the replication occurs mostly in the GI tract and cloaca of the birds, these viruses have evolved for stability at higher extracellular pH to accommodate these sites of replication and also maintain viability in the aquatic environment.33, 34, 35, 36\n",

While HPAI is phenotypically defined by a viruses lethality for susceptible chickens under strict experimental criteria,40 genetically, the key distinguishing structure of HPAI is the presence of a multibasic cleavage site (MBCS), which contains two to several basic residues (e.g. PQRERRRKR/G) in the HA gene, as opposed to a single basic residue (PQRETR/G) in LPAI strains.41, 42, 43 Furin\u2010like peptidases, which are expressed ubiquitously in all tissue types of both avian and mammalian species, are responsible for the cleavage of HA at the MBCS site.41, 44 Additionally, HPAI strains have also emerged through non\u2010homologous recombination with a non\u2010HA protein nucleotide sequence, introducing a non\u2010native sequence into the HA gene.45, 46 Although this can enhance the pathogenicity of the virus, systemic replication does not necessarily occur in all species: experimental infection of ferrets and mice with HPAI H5N1 showed systemic virus replication,47, 48 but replication was only observed in the respiratory tract of non\u2010human primates,49 suggesting that pathogenicity of HPAI viruses is possibly host specific and multifactorial.43 It has been recently understood that domestic birds such as chicken lack the retinoic acid\u2010inducible gene\u2010I (RIG\u2010I), which is essential for signalling in the innate immune response,50, 51 as opposed to presence of RIG\u2010I in other avian species and mammals as an important sensor of viral RNA leading to activation of type I interferons.52 In experimental infection of chickens and ducks with H7N1 virus, increased viral pathogenesis with clinical signs of disease and death is observed in chickens, but infected ducks do not exhibit clinical signs, highlighting the evolutionary adaption of ducks being a natural host of the influenza virus.53, 54 There has also been back\u2010transmission of HPAI viruses from domestic poultry to wild bird populations that are implicated in bird die\u2010offs55 and intercontinental spread.56, 57, 58, 59\n",

Three domains located in the HA1 globular head form the receptor binding site (RBS): the 130\u2010loop (residues 132\u2013138), the 190 loop (residues 188\u2013195) and 220\u2010loop (residues 221\u2013228) (HA residues here follow H3 numbering unless otherwise stated).32, 85, 86, 87 Mutations within the RBS determine the specificity of binding to avian\u2010like \u03b1\u20102,3\u2010sialic acid (SA) or mammalian\u2010like \u03b1\u20102,6\u2010SA receptors. Specifically, the widening of the binding pocket through mutation favours \u03b1\u20102,6\u2010SA receptor binding, as steric hindrance of the \u03b1\u20102,6 cis\u2010linkage SA prevents binding to the narrower avian\u2010adapted RBS that binds to the smaller \u03b1\u20102,3 trans\u2010linkage SA. Two mutations at Gln\u2010226\u2010Leu and Gly\u2010228\u2010Ser are required to widen the RBS in the human\u2010adapted H2 and H3 subtypes.88, 89, 90, 91 In comparison, the widening of the RBS in human\u2010adapted H1 subtype is determined by aspartic acid residues at positions 190 and 225, as they contribute to the conformational change of the 220 loop at the RBS in switching the binding affinity to the \u03b1\u20102,6\u2010SA receptor.92, 93 In the case of subtype H5 virus, crystal structure studies show that the Gln\u2010226\u2010Leu mutation not only widens the binding pocket but also creates a hydrophobic environment, which alters the binding preference from avian \u03b1\u20102,3 to the human \u03b1\u20102,6 receptor.94, 95, 96, 97 Furthermore, mutations in the 130\u2010loop (Leu\u2010133\u2010Val/Ser and Ala\u2010138\u2010Val substitutions) of the HA\u2010H5 enable the virus to bind to both \u03b1\u20102,3\u2010SA and \u03b1\u20102,6\u2010SA receptors.94, 98, 99 Finally, mutations outside the RBS, specifically in glycosylation sites near the RBS, have also been determinants of receptor binding specificity, as these sites, when glycosylated, cause stearic hindrance to the optimal binding of respective SA linkage to the RBS, thereby restricting binding.100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105\n",

These non\u2010coding adaptations are due in part to constraints on host mechanisms that restrict the probability of mutational fixation, and consequently, a non\u2010random pattern of mutation is seen across the virus genome in different host species.142 For instance, many RNA viruses evolve to mimic the CpG dinucleotide frequencies of their hosts.143, 144 Mammalian DNA sequences contain unmethylated CpG motifs responsible for inducing innate immune responses through interactions with Toll\u2010like receptor 9 (TLR9)144, 145; however, most mammals protect themselves against autoimmunity by maintaining CpG dinucleotides that are methylated and at low frequency.145 To accommodate this, IAV has been observed to evolve lower dinucleotide CpG content following interspecies transmission.143, 146 This phenomenon has also been experimentally confirmed, where the infection with modified human A/WSN/33 influenza virions expressing avian\u2010like increased CpG content was shown to increase ssRNA recognition and immune activation by human plasmacytic dendritic cells.144 This low CpG preference has been reported in human IAV subtypes such as the H1N1 and H3N2 in comparison with avian IAVs.143 However, this trend was not observed in H2N2 isolates from the 1957 pandemic, likely due to the short duration in which this subtype circulated in humans.147\n",

Indeed, when the mammalian\u2010like Lys\u2010627 and Asn\u2010701 residues were introduced, a significant increase in polymerase activity and viral pathogenesis was observed,155, 156 but this replicative advantage of the mutation was not necessary for the initial establishment of the avian polymerase in TRS lineage and subsequently human pH1N1 viruses.157 Instead, partial compensatory mutations Gly590Ser and Glu591Arg were observed to aid polymerase activity of in the lack of the mammalian 627 and 701 residues, providing a possible explanation for the successful transmission of the avian\u2010like residues in mammals.43, 155, 156, 157 Additionally, the H1N1/2009 virus has reduced sensitivity to host MxA proteins though the interaction with the NP gene, as a result of the TRS\u2010origin NP reassortment.120, 121, 158\n",

The immune response to IAV infection in swine is similar to that of the human antiviral responses, with experimental evidence showing similar activation and secretion of cytokines is triggered in response to infection with the same virus.164, 165 Unlike humans, swine are unable to transfer maternal immunoglobulins to porcine embryos due to the existence of a thick placenta comprising six tightly connected tissue layers.166 The first 24 hours after birth of the newborn pigs is exceptionally crucial for the transfer and intestinal absorption of maternal IgG from colostrum.166, 167, 168 Although maternal antibodies through suckling can protect newborn piglets to some extent, the piglets are still highly susceptible to new infections. High\u2010density commercial farming practices, where piglets are typically sent to market at 6 months of age, can therefore have profound effects on the transmission and diversity of IAVs in various swine populations.162, 163\n",
