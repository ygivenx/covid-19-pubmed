To overcome to this problem, a number of organic and metal catalyst systems has been examined1\u20136. However, they have the disadvantages of safety problems and heavy metal pollution. Organic electrochemical synthesis provides a powerful strategy for the synthesis of organic compounds in both laboratory and industry scale7\u201313. In this method, the electrons are considered as clean reagents, so that this method can be considered as a green technique. Another important feature of this method, which is used in this work, is its selectivity towards synthesis of products. This unique feature arises from the fact that, the different active intermediates can be provided just by changing the electrode potential7\u201313.",

In particular, it is known that some aminophenol derivatives have antiviral activity against flu A and simple herpes18. It is also known that, the aminophenols containing a sulphone group in addition to activity against flu A and simple herpes have excellent activity against the HIV infection19. On the other hand, it is found that, diphenylsulfone compounds exhibited antibacterial activity20. For example, 4,4-diaminodiphenylsulfone (dapsone) is a bacteriostatic drug that inhibits dihydrofolic acid synthesis by competition with para-aminobenzoic acid21. The oxidation of sulfides or sulfoxides using peracids or hydrogen peroxide, addition reactions to alkenes and alkynes, Friedel\u2013Crafts-type sulfonylation of arenes in the presence of a Lewis or Br\u00f8nsted acid catalyst, and alkylation of sulfinate salts, are four traditional methods for the synthesis of sulfones22. The excess oxidizing agent, high temperatures, harsh reaction conditions, low regioselectivity, the need for stoichiometric amounts of the catalyst, the generation of hazardous waste and formation of a mixture of isomers are the main disadvantages of these methods23\u201327.",

These peaks (A1 and C1) are attributed to two-electron oxidation of MAP to p-methylquinoneimine (MQI) and vice versa, respectively.

            "text": "With increasing the applied potential to 0.55 V vs. Ag/AgCl, the oxidation of MSP1\u20134 becomes possible and MSP\nox\n1-4 is formed. The addition of sulfone nucleophile to MSP\nox\n1-4 followed by aromatization, converts MSP\nox\n1-4 into bis sulfonyl-p-(methylamino)phenol derivatives (BSP1-4). Since the oxidation of BSP1-4 is more difficult than the oxidation of MSP1\u20134 and MAP (Fig. 5), its oxidation was stopped due to the presence of the two electron-withdrawing sulfonyl groups as well as the insolubility of BSP1-4 in the electrolysis medium. A remarkable finding in this study is related to the role of methanesulfinic acid (MS) as a nucleophile. Despite several attempts to synthesize BSP4, no bis sulfonyl derivative has been isolated and unexpectedly a tris sulfonyl compound, TSP, which is a new sulphonamide molecule was obtained via the oxidation of BSP4 and attack of MS to electrogenerated BSP\nox\n4. The oxidation of BSP4 at 0.55 V vs. Ag/AgCl, can be related to the lower electron-withdrawing ability of the methyl-sulfony group compared with aryl-sulfony groups that causes the oxidation potentials of bis and tris sulfonyl compounds do not have any significant differences. In addition, higher nucleophilicity and lower steric effect of MS compared with aryl-sulfone nucleophiles and more solubility of the products containing MS, can also be effective in the observed behavior. According to Fig. 4, the anodic peaks A1, A2 and A3 pertain to the oxidation of MAP, MSP and BSP to the MQI, MSP\nox and BSP\nox, respectively.",

Our data shows that, k\nobs is strongly dependent to pH so that, it increases with decreasing pH value. The protonation of the nitrogen atom in MQI, makes it more reactive toward the addition reaction and is responsible for increasing k\nobs. In addition, the results displays that, k\nobs is also dependent directly to the electron donating ability of the nucleophile, so that, it varies in the order methanesulfinic acid > p-toluenesulfinic acid > banzenesulfinic acid > p-chlorosulfinic acid (Fig. 8).\n\n",

The working electrode used in controlled-potential coulometry and synthesis was an assembly of three ordinary soft carbon plates (20 mm length, 10 mm width and 40 mm height), and large stainless steel cylinder (25 cm2 area) constituted the counter electrode. The working electrode potentials were measured versus Ag/AgCl (all electrodes from AZAR electrode).

Afterwards, the diameter of the inhabitation zone surrounding of the discs were measured by special ruler. Also, to study the lack of influence of the solution containing 10% dimethyl sulfoxide on the bacterias of the study, 20 microlitre of the solution was poured on the discs and set on cultured Muller Hinton agar and incubated.",

The simulation was carried out assuming semi-infinite one-dimensional diffusion and planar electrode geometry. The experimental parameters entered for digital simulation consisted of the following: (i) the transfer coefficient (\u03b1) was assumed to be 0.5. (ii) The formal potentials were obtained experimentally as the midpoint potential between the anodic and cathodic peaks (E\nmid). (iii) Analytical concentration of MAP, E\nstart, E\nswitch, E\nend and temperature = 25 \u00b0C. All these parameters were kept constant throughout the fitting of the digitally simulated voltammogram to the experimental data. Electrochemical oxidation of MAP was examined by digital simulation in the pH range 1\u20136. The simulation was performed based on the proposed EC and ECEC mechanisms (for simplifying, the proton transfers processes are not included). In these mechanisms, E is electrochemical oxidation of MAP to MAP\nOX, and C is the addition reaction that happens after the electrooxidation process. In these mechanisms, the peak current ratio (I\npC/I\npA1) is a criterion for the chemical reaction rate between MAP\nOX and sulfinic ion nucleophiles.",
