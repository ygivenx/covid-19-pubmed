In the case of coronaviruses, replication/transcription complexes (RTCs) assemble on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes. The RTC, a multiprotein complex, replicates genomic RNA (gRNA) and transcribes subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) during viral infection. During replication, different viral RNAs are replicated, transcribed, translated, or assembled into virions. In RNA virus infections, replication and assembly are often coordinated by cis-acting RNA elements, which may undergo intramolecular RNA interactions to form secondary structures important for recognition. Concordantly, during coronavirus infection, gRNA and sgRNAs must be distinguishable for the purposes of replication, transcription, translation, and assembly.",

In lineage A betacoronaviruses (\u03b2-CoVs), such as murine hepatitis virus (MHV), the selective packaging of gRNA is dependent on the packaging signal (PS) and its interaction with structural proteins. Early studies of the MHV PS identified a 190-bp region within the nsp15 locus as the PS (3). In both infection and virus-like particle systems, the 190-bp PS was sufficient for packaging of nonviral RNA (4). Selective packaging is intimately tied to interactions with the structural proteins N and M. The selective packaging of nonviral RNA was correlated with M protein binding (5). Furthermore, N protein binds to RNA indiscriminately and was not required for packaging of nonviral RNA. However, when the N protein C-terminal domain (CTD) from MHV was swapped with sudden acute respiratory syndrome-associated CoV (SARS-CoV), significant increases in packaged sgRNAs were observed (6). These two studies propose two different models for selective packaging with M, or alternatively N, protein playing the dominant role in conferring packaging selectivity.",

Structural study of the PS from MHV, human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1), bovine CoV, and HCoV-OC43 revealed several conserved elements within the 95-bp stem-loop structure, including 2-nucleotide (nt) bulges, AGC/GUAAU motifs, and a pentaloop (Fig. 1A) (7). More recent studies utilizing 20 synonymous mutations predicted to abolish the PS stem-loop structure demonstrated that the secondary structure of the PS was necessary for selective packaging during MHV infection (8). In this instance, significantly higher levels of sgRNA were packaged into PS mutants than in wild-type MHV. Remarkably, this increase in sgRNA did not accompany equivalent decreases in packaging of gRNA or in viral titers (8). Thus, these PS mutants had no defect in virus production in tissue culture cells compared to wild-type MHV (8). This is in contrast to the role of the alphavirus packaging signal, where PS mutants also lead to increased sgRNA packaging, but at the expense of gRNA packaging and viral fitness in cultured cells (9). Retrovirus packaging signal mutants also lead to greatly decreased genomic RNA packaging with a concomitant increase in cellular mRNA packaging (10).",

Here, using two different PS mutants, we demonstrate that disrupting the selective packaging of MHV resulted in highly attenuated viruses in vivo, and this was true for A59 and JHMV, two different strains of MHV. Furthermore, the PS was important for repressing the type I interferon (IFN-I) response during MHV infection of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs). Finally, IFN-I signaling was essential for the attenuation of selective packaging mutants as the virulence of P/S mutants was restored in interferon alpha/beta receptor-knockout (IFNAR\u2212/\u2212) mice or mice treated with IFNAR-blocking antibody. This study establishes the PS as a novel virulence factor for MHV, and likely other coronaviruses.",

            "text": "Previously, we inserted the RNA sequence encoding a hemagglutinin (HA) tag within the PS of the nsp15 locus (shown in Fig. 1A and B). This virus, termed rA59Nsp15-HA, replicated like wild-type virus but had increased levels of packaged sgRNA, indicating that selective packaging of gRNA was disrupted (11). Based on these observations, we next investigated the effect of selective packaging on virulence. B6 male mice were infected with rA59Nsp15-HA by intracranial injection and monitored for morbidity and mortality for 12 days postinfection (dpi). rA59Nsp15-HA-infected mice had decreased weight loss and increased survival compared to wild-type rA59 (rA59WT) (see Fig. S1A and B in the supplemental material). To test whether this phenotype was strain specific, we introduced the HA sequence into nsp15 of the rJHMV strain of MHV (rJHMVNsp15-HA), using a previously described full-length pBAC-based reverse genetics system (12). rJHMVNsp15-HA had growth kinetics in vitro equivalent to that of rJHMVWT (Fig. S2A), as previously described for rA59Nsp15-HA-infected cells (11). Mice infected with rJHMVNsp15-HA had substantially decreased weight loss and increased survival (Fig. 1D and E). While these data suggest that selective packaging is important for MHV virulence, we cannot rule out subtle effects of the HA tag on the function of nsp15 endoribonuclease, a known IFN-I antagonist. Further, addition of the HA sequence resulted in a 31-bp double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) stem, which could conceivably induce an innate immune response (13, 14).",

The growth kinetics of two independent rJHMVPS\u2212 clones (3.2 and 4.2) was nearly identical to that of rJHMVWT\nin vitro (Fig. S2B). These data are consistent with previous results using rA59PS\u2212 and indicate that the PS has few, if any, effects on replication in vitro (8). After confirming the fitness of rJHMVPS\u2212\nin vitro, we next assessed the virulence of rJHMVPS\u2212 in infected mice. B6 mice were infected intranasally with either rJHMVWT or rJHMVPS\u2212 and monitored for morbidity and mortality for 14 dpi. Intranasal infection of rJHMVWT resulted in nearly 100% mortality (Fig. 1G) and substantial weight loss (Fig. 1H). Mice infected with rJHMVPS\u2212 had significantly increased survival (Fig. 1G) and reduced weight loss (Fig. 1H). In agreement with results using rJHMV, mice infected with rA59PS\u2212 also had decreased weight loss and increased survival compared to mice infected with rA59WT (Fig. S1C and D).",

Thus, both PS mutant viruses did not reach the same peak viral titers as, and were cleared more rapidly than, wild-type JHMV.

This enrichment of +sgRNA7 to gRNA in rA59PS\u2212 and rA59Nsp15-HA virions contrasts with rA59WT, where the +sgRNA7-to-gRNA ratio was dramatically decreased compared to the intracellular ratio (Fig. 2A).

Finally, these increases in sgRNA7 incorporation had little effect on the levels of gRNA (Fig. 2C), as neither rA59PS\u2212 nor rA59Nsp15-HA virions had more than an ~2-fold decrease in packaged gRNA compared to rA59WT virions.",

The elevated levels of sgRNA, especially \u2013sgRNA, in virions may act as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which may be sensed during entry, replication, or packaging of PS mutants. To initially test this hypothesis, we utilized bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) because they are easily culturable, are highly susceptible to MHV, and are known to express IFN-I following infection (15). BMMs infected with rA59PS\u2212 had an ~2- to 3-fold increase in beta interferon (IFN-\u03b2) at 12 h postinfection (hpi) compared to rA59WT-infected BMMs (Fig. 3A). The increased IFN-I response was not due to increased replication of rA59PS\u2212 as rA59PS\u2212 infection resulted in a small (~1.5- to 2-fold) reduction in gRNA (Fig. 3B). In agreement with previous reports, we found that IFN-I production was dependent on MDA5 for both rA59WT and rA59PS\u2212 (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, there was still a small difference (~1.5-fold) in replication of rA59PS\u2212 in MDA5\u2212/\u2212 cells (Fig. 3D). These results indicate that alteration of the packaging signal in MHV can lead to an enhanced innate immune response and perhaps a modest defect in replication in primary cells.",

MHV induces significant levels of IFN-I in plasmacytoid dendritic cells via TLR7 signaling, contributing to protection (17). To determine the role of TLR7 signaling in protection, we infected TLR7\u2212/\u2212 mice with rJHMVPS\u2212. Since the TLR7\u2212/\u2212 mice that were used were on a BALB/c background, we first confirmed that BALB/c mice were protected from rJHMVPS\u2212-mediated lethality. rJHMVWT infection caused complete lethality and substantial weight loss, while rJHMVPS\u2212-infected BALB/c mice had a phenotype similar to that observed in rJHMVPS\u2212-infected B6 mice, with increased survival and less weight loss (Fig. 5C and D). TLR7\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with rJHMVWT succumbed to infection, while we observed no increase in weight loss or lethality after infection with rJHMVPS\u2212 (Fig. 5E and F). These results suggest that neither signaling through MAVS nor that through TLR7 is solely responsible for attenuation of packaging signal mutants and suggest that initiation of IFN-I signaling occurs via alternate sensors or is multifactorial.",

IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice are incapable of IFN-I signaling and therefore lack expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). In contrast, MDA5\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with MHV had decreased but detectable levels of IFN-I, and the expression of many ISGs was not altered during MHV infection of MDA5\u2212/\u2212 mice (18). Next, to determine if IFN-I signaling during infection was responsible for protecting mice or if basal levels of ISGs were playing a significant role, we treated MAVS\u2212/\u2212 mice with an IFNAR-blocking antibody (19). In these experiments, IFNAR-blocking antibody was injected intraperitoneally 6 h prior to infection and again 3 days later. Control MAVS\u2212/\u2212 mice administered rat IgG remained protected from rJHMVPS\u2212; conversely, MAVS\u2212/\u2212 mice administered IFNAR-blocking antibody displayed increased weight loss and succumbed to infection (Fig. 5G and H).

The location of the stem-loop structure within the nsp15 locus allows these coronaviruses to selectively package gRNA and not coterminal sgRNA or host RNA. In this work, we quantified the packaging defect in rA59Nsp15-HA and rA59PS\u2212. The defects present in these two different PS mutants were strikingly similar, despite rA59Nsp15-HA maintaining the overall structure, the pentaloop, and one of the 2-nucleotide (nt) bulges, elements hypothesized to be important for packaging (Fig. 1A and B). In agreement with previous publications (8), we found a significant increase in sgRNA packaging in both rA59PS\u2212 and rA59Nsp15-HA virions. We further divided the sgRNA into +sgRNA and \u2212sgRNA and found increased levels of both in the virions of mutant viruses compared to parental viruses. Furthermore, we found increased levels of host cellular RNA in both packaging mutant virions. Interestingly, while the ratios of +sgRNA7 to gRNA in the virions of both rA59PS\u2212 and rA59Nsp15-HA were equivalent to the intracellular ratio, this was not true for ratios of \u2013sgRNA7 or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) to gRNA.",

Since N protein binds to RNA indiscriminately (5), levels of packaged RNA would be predicted to closely mimic those present in the intracellular environment. However, the ratio of both \u2013sgRNA7 and GAPDH to gRNA was increased in virions but did not reach intracellular ratios, suggesting that RNA binding by N is not the sole determinant of RNA packaging in rA59PS\u2212 and rA59Nsp15-HA. RNA localization, secondary structure in other regions of the genome, or other proteins may influence RNA packaging.

It can be hypothesized that packaged sgRNA and/or host RNAs behave as PAMPs, eliciting an increased IFN-I response in rJHMVPS\u2212-infected and rJHMVNsp15-HA-infected cells. Consistent with this hypothesis, IFN-I signaling was essential for this attenuation in vivo (Fig. 3). Furthermore, BMMs infected with rJHMVPS\u2212 expressed higher levels of IFN-I than rJHMVWT (Fig. 3A). These data indicate that packaging mutants are capable of inducing an increased IFN-I response, which may be protective in vivo. We investigated the two best-described sensors for IFN-I signaling during coronavirus infection, MDA5 and TLR7. We found that MAVS\u2212/\u2212 and TLR7\u2212/\u2212 mice were both resistant to rJHMVPS\u2212. These data indicate that neither TLR7- nor MAVS-mediated signaling was solely responsible for the attenuation of rJHMVPS\u2212.

Together, these data support a role for IFN-I signaling in rJHMVPS\u2212 attenuation and suggest that TLR7 and MDA5 have a redundant function(s) or that other sensors/inflammatory pathways play a role in MHV packaging mutant attenuation.",

This would facilitate recognition by the intracellular helical receptor RIG-I. Negative-sense sgRNA is expected to be present as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which could be detected by RIG-I, TLR3, and protein kinase R (PKR), in addition to MDA5. It should be noted that while our data suggest that IFN-I signaling and perhaps other changes in the innate immune response are largely responsible for rJHMVPS\u2212 attenuation, defects in virus replication in cells in the infected brain may also contribute to attenuation.

The F plasmid was linearized, and homologous arms, with the PS\u2212 mutations, were added by PCR using the primers listed in Table S1. The linearized plasmid was recombined using the homologous arms and the In-Fusion cloning kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The PS\u2212 mutations were screened for by PCR and sequencing. The F plasmid and other fragments were digested with BsmBI and ligated together using T4 DNA ligase. Ligated DNAs and N protein transcript were transcribed in vitro using the mMessage mMachine T7 transcription kit (Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. BHK-MHVR cells were then transfected by electroporation with transcribed RNAs. Transfected BHK-MHVR cells were plated in D10 and monitored for cytopathic effects. Rescued recombinant viruses were collected, their titers were determined as described above, and they were termed rA59PS\u2212 P0. rA59PS\u2212 P0 stocks were used to generate rA59PS\u2212 P1 stocks by infecting 17Cl-1 cells with virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 PFU/cell and collecting cells at times of maximal cytopathic effects. Titers of P1 stocks of rA59WT and rA59PS\u2212 were determined, and the stocks were utilized for all experiments with rA59.",
