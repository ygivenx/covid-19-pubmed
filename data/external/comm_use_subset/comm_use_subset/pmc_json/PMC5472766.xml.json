Ribosome profiling is a recently developed technique that enables global footprinting of translating ribosomes in cells via high-throughput sequencing of ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs) (Fig. 1b)1920. We infected murine L929 cells with wild-type (WT) or shift site mutant (SS) viruses and harvested cells at 2, 4, 6 and 8 h post infection (p.i.). In the SS mutant, the WT shift site G_GUU_UUU is mutated to A_GUG_UUU (Fig. 1c) to inhibit PRF17. Ribo-Seq libraries were prepared from each sample, deep sequenced, and the resulting reads mapped to host and viral genomes. Ribo-Seq quality was assessed as described previously (Supplementary Fig. 1)21.",

For WT virus, a substantial decrease in mean ribosome density was observed to occur after the 2B* ORF at 6 and 8 h p.i., indicating that the majority of ribosomes translating the viral genome frameshift into the 2B* ORF and terminate at the 2B* stop codon. For the SS mutant, however, there is no significant drop in RPF density at the 2B* stop codon, consistent with inhibited frameshifting in this mutant. PRF efficiencies were estimated from the WT ratio of downstream to upstream RPF densities, normalized by the SS mutant to control for variation in translational speed, technical biases and ribosome pausing between different genomic locations. PRF efficiencies were not obviously different from zero at 2 and 4 h p.i., but at 6 and 8 h p.i. were remarkably high, at 64% and 69%, respectively (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 2b). Consistent with the absence of measurable PRF at 2 and 4 h p.i., a noticeable ribosomal pause that was observed in the 2B* region at 6 and 8 h p.i. for WT virus, is absent at 2 and 4 h p.i. and in the SS mutant (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 2a). The effector of this pause is uncertain though, in common with many other ribosomal pauses, it may be nascent peptide mediated. Extraordinarily, from 6 h p.i. RPFs accumulated to high levels on the mutated shift site (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 2a). In contrast, only a modest accumulation was apparent on the WT shift site. The position of RPFs in this region indicate that the pause initiates when the UUU of the shift site is in the ribosomal A-site and, in these samples, continues for \u223c3 codons thereafter (Supplementary Fig. 2c,d), although such broadening of the pause is likely an artefact resulting from ribosome run-on during sample preparation22. The total excess accumulation of RPFs over these four codons at 6 and 8 h p.i. relative to 4 h p.i. is \u223c5-fold greater in SS than in WT.",

Figure 1f and Supplementary Fig. 2e show the polyprotein-frame codon positions to which the 5\u2032 ends of RPFs map for regions upstream of 2B*, within 2B*, and downstream of 2B*. For the upstream and downstream regions, RPF 5\u2032 ends map mainly to the first and third positions of polyprotein-frame codons. In contrast, within the 2B* region, RPF 5\u2032 ends for WT virus at 6 and 8 h p.i. map mainly to the third and second positions of polyprotein-frame codons, consistent with a mixture of ribosomes translating the two overlapping reading frames in this region.

            "text": "Previously, a downstream stem\u2013loop structure, separated from the frameshift site by a 13-nt \u2018spacer', was identified bioinformatically17. This positioning is inconsistent with canonical mRNA structure stimulators of \u22121 PRF, which are separated from the shift site by just 5\u20139 nt. The predicted stem\u2013loop is conserved in different isolates of EMCV and in TMEV, with compensatory substitutions (i.e. paired substitutions that preserve the predicted base-pairings) further supporting its biological relevance (Supplementary Fig. 3a). RNA structure probing also supported the stem\u2013loop (Supplementary Fig. 3b,c). To assess a role for the stem\u2013loop in PRF and/or ribosome pausing, we generated a stem\u2013loop mutant virus, WT-SL, and a corresponding shift site mutant, SS-SL, and performed ribosome profiling at 8 h p.i. (Fig. 2a,b; see Supplementary Fig. 4 for Ribo-Seq quality assessment and Supplementary Fig. 5 for corresponding RNA-Seq data). Pausing at the mutated shift site (SS) was absent in the stem\u2013loop mutant (SS-SL), showing that the stem\u2013loop is required for pausing. Assuming an average translation speed20 of 0.18 s codon\u22121, the excess accumulation of RPFs in SS (Fig. 2c) equates to a ribosomal pause of \u223c20 s (albeit with certain caveats; see Methods). For SS, WT-SL and SS-SL viruses, there was no marked change in RPF phasing in the overlap region (Fig. 2d), consistent with inhibition of PRF. The PRF efficiency was measured as 70% for WT virus, but negligible for the SS, WT-SL and SS-SL mutants (Fig. 2e). Thus the stem\u2013loop is essential for efficient PRF.",

Separation between 2A and 2B occurs co-translationally via a mechanism known as \u2018StopGo' or \u2018Stop-Carry On' that depends critically on the amino acid motif D(V/I)ExNPGP (where the last proline is the first amino acid of 2B)1516. To assess whether StopGo affects PRF, we applied ribosome profiling to viruses LV-WT and LV-SS-SL in which StopGo was inhibited by mutating the NPGP sequence to NPLV (Fig. 2a,b)23. For LV-WT, RPF phasing in the overlap region was not greatly different from WT (Fig. 2d), and the calculated PRF efficiency (62%) was only slightly lower than WT (70%) (Fig. 2e). The modest difference may be due to slower replication in the mutant leading to a lag in achieving maximum PRF efficiency, or may indicate a more direct (albeit modest) stimulatory effect of StopGo on PRF, likely related to proper processing of the C terminus of 2A (see below). On the other hand, for the mutant LV-SS-SL these features were similar to the SS-SL mutant. Thus we found no evidence for ribosome drop-off induced by StopGo alone.",

To test this, we used the RiboTrap system in which RNA transcripts are labelled with 5-bromo-uridine to allow immunopurification of bound complexes. A short RNA transcript containing the EMCV stem\u2013loop was found to bind an \u223c16 kDa protein from EMCV-infected cell lysates that was not observed with mock-infected cell lysates or with a control RNA containing a scrambled version of the EMCV stem\u2013loop sequence (Supplementary Fig. 6a). Mass spectrometric analysis of this product revealed it to be the viral protein 2A (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 6b).",

Two main RNA:protein complexes were observed, with the more slowly migrating species accumulating as the amount of 2A was increased (Fig. 3a), confirming that 2A does indeed bind the EMCV PRF signal. We estimated the Kd of the interaction to be \u223c3\u20134.5 \u03bcM (Fig. 3b). A CCC triplet in the RNA loop is highly conserved between different isolates of EMCV and TMEV (Supplementary Fig. 3a), suggesting a potential role in 2A binding. To investigate this, we mutated the middle C to U (C46U; Fig. 3c) and tested whether cold WT RNA or cold mutant RNA could compete with the 32P-labelled WT RNA for 2A binding. Whereas the WT RNA was able to compete well, greatly diminishing radiolabelled RNA:protein complexes at increasing molar excess, the C46U mutant was unable to compete, indicating that this single-nucleotide mutation had prevented 2A binding (Fig. 3d). Similarly, RNAs with stem-disrupting mutations (G52U and SL3\u2032; Fig. 3c) were also unable to compete with WT RNA (Fig. 3e), indicating that the presence of at least part of the stem\u2013loop duplex is also important for 2A binding (and not just for proper positioning of the RNA:protein complex for PRF stimulation). A direct interaction between 2A and RNA would likely involve a cluster of positively charged residues on 2A. By inspecting an alignment of cardiovirus 2A sequences we identified a conserved linear basic cluster (Supplementary Fig. 6c). We generated a recombinant mutant 2A (hereafter 2A-mut) by changing R95 and R97 to alanines (Supplementary Fig. 6d,e). EMSA analysis confirmed that 2A-mut was unable to bind to the EMCV PRF signal (Fig. 3f). Further, when introduced into the virus genome, the R95 and R97 substitutions resulted in a protein expression pattern similar to that of SS mutant virus, indicating that the 2A mutations had inhibited PRF (Fig. 4a\u2013c). Consistent with the increase in frameshifting efficiency, the amount of 2A in cells infected with WT virus increases dramatically between 4 and 6 h p.i. (Fig. 4d).",

To test this we titrated recombinant 2A into a wheat germ (WG) in vitro translation system programmed with a reporter mRNA containing the EMCV PRF signal (Fig. 5a). Increasing amounts of 2A led to a modest general inhibition of cap-dependent translation, as reported previously2425. When the reporter was translated in the absence of 2A, only the non-frameshift product was observed (Fig. 5b, lane DB). However, in the presence of 2A, efficient PRF was observed, to a level of \u223c20% with increasing amounts of 2A (Fig. 5b,c). In control translations, PRF was abolished upon mutating the frameshift site (SS), or the stem\u2013loop and CCC triplet (SL), or upon replacing 2A with 2A-mut (Fig. 5d). Changing the loop-region CCC triplet to UUU (3CU), CUC (C46U) or CAC (C46A) also inhibited PRF (Fig. 5e). The SL5\u2032 and SL3\u2032 mutations of Figs 3c and 5a substantially reduced PRF (to 4% and 1%, respectively) whereas the SL5\u20323\u2032 mutations (designed to restore the stem\u2013loop structure but with altered base pairings) restored PRF to WT levels (Fig. 5e). Further, increasing (+U) or decreasing (\u2212U) the spacer length by 1 nt reduced PRF to 6 and 1%, respectively (Fig. 5e). Similar results were observed in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) in vitro translation system (Supplementary Fig. 7).",

The extent of pausing was assessed by comparing the levels of a translational intermediate corresponding to pausing at the EMCV shift site with that of the full-length polypeptide produced during a time course in which translation was synchronized by the addition of edeine, a potent inhibitor of initiation, 5 min after the start of the reaction. Consistent with the ribosome profiling, we observed strong pausing at a mutated shift site (SS) in the presence of recombinant 2A (Fig. 6b and Supplementary Fig. 8a), a much less pronounced pause at the WT shift site (Fig. 6c and Supplementary Fig. 8b), and no pause when the stem\u2013loop and CCC triplet were mutated (SS-SL and WT-SL; Fig. 6d and Supplementary Fig. 8c) or when SS or WT RNA was translated in the presence of 2A-mut (Fig. 6e and Supplementary Fig. 8d). Thus, both the stem\u2013loop and 2A protein are required for ribosome pausing. When the spacer length was increased by 1 nt (SS+U and WT+U) pausing was observed in the presence of 2A but was much less pronounced than for SS RNA (Supplementary Fig. 8e,f). The appearance of the pause product is transitory (albeit spread over several minutes for WT and many minutes for SS; Fig. 6b,c), consistent with its identity as a genuine intermediate rather than a dead-end product. There was no evidence for significant ribosomal drop-off occurring at the WT shift site (Fig. 6c and Supplementary Fig. 8b, 60-min lane) though we could not rule out a small amount of drop-off occurring when the shift site was mutated due to the long half-life of the pause product for these constructs (Fig. 6b and Supplementary Fig. 8a).",

Early in infection the efficiency of PRF is negligible, allowing efficient translation of the 3\u2032-encoded replication proteins. However, late in infection and presumably as a result of increasing concentrations of cytoplasmic 2A, PRF becomes highly efficient, resulting in >3-fold downregulation of replication protein synthesis. This provides an elegant and economic solution to facilitate maximal build up of replication capacity early in infection, while providing a translational bias that favours virion production at late timepoints, and raises the question of whether other \u2018single-polyprotein' viruses such as poliovirus and hepatitis C might also use non-canonical translational mechanisms to temporally regulate replication protein synthesis. These results provide a satisfying conclusion to observations by Paucha et al. who, 40 years ago, observed approximately twice as much capsid as noncapsid viral protein in EMCV-infected cells, specifically at late timepoints. Although they could not then provide a mechanism, these authors showed extraordinary insight\u2014long before the EMCV genome was sequenced\u2014by proposing a model in which, to quote, \u2018some viral-specified protein acts as a specific termination factor capable of causing premature termination of translation at a site located near the midpoint of the viral RNA'26. We can now confirm that this effect is mediated at the translational level, and depends on protein-stimulated PRF rather than ribosomal drop-off at StopGo or at other sites during polyprotein synthesis.",

            "text": "An association between ribosomal pausing and RNA-structure-stimulated \u22121 PRF has been previously reported293031 though it has been unclear to what extent pausing is required for \u22121 PRF as opposed to being an unavoidable side effect. Of note, several previous pausing analyses used reporters with a mutated shift site. Similar to recent analyses of RNA structure-stimulated \u22121 PRF in a cell-free Escherichia coli system9, we observed much more pronounced pausing when the shift site was mutated than for an intact shift site (Supplementary Fig. 2c,d in cells and Fig. 6b,c\nin vitro), suggesting that, by making a \u22121 nt shift, ribosomes are able to more efficiently remove 2A and unwind the stem\u2013loop than if they remain in the original frame. Similar to that study, but in contrast to recent single-molecule FRET work8, the EMCV pause starts when the P- and A-sites are on the shift site, not upstream. The reason for the significantly lower PRF efficiency observed in vitro (maximum \u223c20%) compared to virus infection (maximum \u223c70%) remains unknown, but possibilities include incomplete activity of the recombinant 2A, effects of more distal RNA sequences, or differences in translational environment, such as salt, temperature, pH and ribosome loading. In the absence of authentically processed 2A, PRF in the StopGo (LV) mutants would be stimulated by 2A\u20132B (or cleaved versions thereof (ref. 17)) and/or 2A\u20132B* and this may explain the slightly reduced PRF level in LV-WT (Fig. 2e). The stem\u2013loop:2A complex likely acts as an analogue of an RNA structure stimulator, except that it is regulatable. At this stage it is not known if it is simply an obstacle (e.g. to ribosome subunit rotation) or has some more specific interaction with the ribosome.",

In this analysis, normalization by RNA-Seq densities was not carried out as the kinetics of RNA synthesis are not synchronous with the kinetics of RNA translation, and, especially late in infection, newly synthesized RNA may be destined for packaging rather than translation. Ribosome density along the virus genome may be affected by the kinetics of translation (as newly synthesized RNA enters the translation pool it takes 10\u201312 min for ribosomes to reach the 3\u2032 regions38), variations in translation speed and ribosome pausing between different genomic regions, technical biases (nuclease, PCR, ligation)39 and potentially ribosome \u2018drop-off' at other sites along the genome. The SS mutant was used as an appropriate control by which to normalize the WT RPF density for these factors. PRF efficiencies (Figs 1e and 2e) were calculated using RPFs with estimated P-sites mapping within the regions 180 nt after the polyprotein initiation codon to 180 nt upstream of the junction between the 2A and 2B coding regions (upstream density), and 180 nt downstream of the 2B* stop codon to 180 nt upstream of the polyprotein stop codon (downstream density). RPF counts were divided by region lengths to obtain RPF densities. To calculate the fraction of ribosomes that avoid a \u22121 PRF, the downstream mean density was divided by the upstream mean density, and this value for WT or mutant viruses was divided by the corresponding value for the SS mutant. One minus this value estimates the PRF efficiency.",

            "text": "To estimate the length of pausing at the mutated shift site we compared the SS and SS-SL mutants of Fig. 2b. In the first round ribosomal profiling, the pausing peak extended over four codons starting at the shift site (Supplementary Fig. 2d) whereas in the second round ribosomal profiling, it was spread over \u223c20 codons, indicating considerable ribosome run-on during preparation of the latter samples22. RPF histograms for SS and SS-SL were first normalized by the total number of RPFs with estimated P-sites mapping within the regions 180 nt after the polyprotein initiation codon to 180 nt upstream of the junction between the 2A and 2B coding regions or 180 nt downstream of the 2B* stop codon to 180 nt upstream of the polyprotein stop codon (Fig. 2c). Then the RPF density was summed over the 20 codons starting from the shift site. Within these 20 codons, SS-SL had a mean normalized RPF density of 0.80 while SS had a mean normalized RPF density of 5.10. Under the assumption that the SS-SL value reflects the effect of local technical biases (PCR, ligation, nuclease), the excess density in SS is 20 \u00d7 (5.10/0.80\u22121)=107.5, which, assuming a mean translation time of 0.18 s codon\u22121, equates to \u223c20 s. This calculation is approximate as the underlying RPF distributions over these 20 codons differ between SS (mostly run-on of ribosomes initially paused at the shift site) and SS-SL (codon-specific variability in decoding times) so that an attempt to factor out technical biases via the quotient SS/SS-SL is inherently flawed. Further, it is also possible that pausing may be underestimated if the 3\u2032-adjacent stem\u2013loop and/or bound 2A inhibits nuclease cleavage at the leading edge of the ribosome and the production of appropriately sized RPFs for some fraction of ribosomes paused on the shift site.",
