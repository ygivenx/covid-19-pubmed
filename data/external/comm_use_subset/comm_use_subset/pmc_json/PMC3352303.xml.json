We defined mild and moderate asthmatic attack according to the guidelines outlined in the Global Initiative of Asthma (GINA) report on a global strategy for asthma management and prevention. Adult patients aged 18 years old and above who came to the Emergency Department of HUSM with mild to moderate asthmatic attacks were included in the study. We excluded patients referred from district hospitals or other health facilities (who may have been given reliever treatment prior to arrival), pregnancy, patients who are already started on any LABA medications as well as patients with persistent poor inhalational techniques despite being taught the proper technique in the Emergency Department.

However, this study may pave the way for larger studies in the future to study the beneficial effects of Symbicort\u00ae beyond the first 15 min and whether it can be used as an alternative reliever. A better alternative methodology would be to add a placebo inhaler for patients in the nebulized salbutamol arm and a placebo nebulization (e.g., saline) for the Symbicort\u00ae arm. In this way, the confounding bias due to the different drug delivery systems could be minimized.",

This is often because patients do not understand the difference between maintenance and reliever medications as well as the importance of regular ICS use [15,16]. As a result, many patients tend to over-rely on short-acting \u03b2-2 agonist medications for quick relief of symptoms at the expense of omitting their ICS therapy, thus lowering anti-inflammatory protection and increasing the propensity for the development of severe and potentially life-threatening exacerbations [17]. If an alternative agent that combines both reliever and maintenance medications could be used, this would simplify treatment and provide a more convenient and effective way in which to deliver medications to the endobronchial tree.",
