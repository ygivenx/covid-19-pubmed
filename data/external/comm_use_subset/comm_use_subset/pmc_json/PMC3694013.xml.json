All coronaviruses share a similar genome organisation with Gene 1, the replicase gene, located at the 5\u2032 end of the genome and the structural and group-specific accessory genes clustered at the 3\u2032 end. A process of discontinuous transcription during negative strand synthesis, regulated by short AU rich sequences known as transcription regulatory sequences (TRSs), leads to expression of the structural and accessory proteins as a nested set of subgenomic (sg) mRNAs (reviewed in [1]\u2013[3]). The avian gammacoronavirus IBV is a highly infectious pathogen of domestic fowl that causes disease in chickens of all ages and despite vaccination, using both live attenuated and inactivated vaccines, is responsible for major economic losses to poultry industries worldwide as a result of poor weight gain and decreased egg production [4]\u2013[9].",

In recent years a number of reverse genetics systems have been successfully developed to produce full-length cDNAs from several coronaviruses including TGEV, human coronavirus 229E, SARS-CoV and human coronavirus NL63 [15]\u2013[19]; with these advances making it possible to investigate the potential of using coronaviruses as vaccine vectors.

These studies, as outlined by de Haan et al. [28], [29], showed that the expression of heterologous proteins may be dependent on a number of factors, including the genetic background of the virus, the spatial location in the virus genome at which the heterologous gene is inserted and, if replacing genes, how essential these genes are to the replication of the coronavirus. Due to the nature of coronavirus sg mRNA transcription the expression of heterologous genes may be achieved by expression from an existing sg mRNA either via insertion of a gene cassette or by replacement of existing genes. Alternatively, heterologous genes can be expressed from an additional, newly synthesised sg mRNA as demonstrated from IBV D-RNAs [12], [14] or TGEV minigenomes [30], although these were often found to be genetically unstable. Recombinant viruses consisting of full-length virus genomes showed that stability was often greatest following the replacement of the non-essential accessory genes [24], [27], [29], [31], while alterations to coronavirus structural genes appeared to be less well tolerated with reduced virus stability, or an inability to rescue infectious virus [24], [32].",

The resulting rIBVs were assessed to investigate whether: (1) the size and type, (2) the spatial position or (3) the nucleotide sequence of the gene introduced were important factors in determining the possibility for utilising IBV as a vaccine vector. Reporter genes were inserted under the control of existing TRSs in the case of the replacement of Gene 3 and Gene 5, or under the control of an additionally inserted copy of an IBV canonical consensus TRS in the case of the replacement of the IR. Successfully rescued viruses were characterised and subsequently investigated for genetic stability. The effect of codon-optimisation of the heterologous gene to be more \u2018IBV-like\u2019 in nucleotide sequence was also investigated. Our results demonstrated that heterologous gene expression could be achieved in cell culture for all successfully rescued rIBVs, although genome stability varied depending on the genomic location of the reporter gene and the MOI at which rIBVs were passaged in vitro. The results of this study suggest that the replacement of Gene 5 with heterologous genes represents a promising target for the generation of IBV-based vaccine vectors.",

Based on the Beau-R molecular clone of the Beaudette-CK strain of IBV [21], we designed eight rIBVs in which three different IBV genome regions, Gene 5, ORFs 3a and 3b or the IR, were replaced with the reporter genes eGFP or hRluc, or codon-optimised reporter genes IBVeGFP and IBVhRluc (Figure 1).

In the design of each construct measures were taken to ensure that the transcription of other IBV genes was not affected by the loss of virus sequences or the incorporation of the reporter gene sequences. Recombinant IBVs, BeauR-eGFP\u03945ab and BeauR-hRluc\u03945ab, consisted of direct replacement of IBV Gene 5 sequence, beginning at the ORF 5a initiation codon, and ending at amino acid seven of ORF 5b in order to maintain the genomic sequence upstream of the N gene TRS.

The introduced reporter genes, replacing ORFs 3ab, were expressed utilising the existing Gene 3 TRS. To ensure expression of the E protein the insertion of an artificial TRS was required directly downstream of the reporter gene sequence for the transcription of a sg mRNA for translation of the E protein. As the full extent of the sequences required for efficient sg mRNA transcription are currently unknown for IBV we designed a TRS containing a copy of the consensus IBV TRS with flanking nucleotides derived from the Gene 5 TRS (5\u2032-GUUUUACUUAACAAAUACGGACG-3\u2032) based on our knowledge of the expression of foreign genes from IBV D-RNAs [12], [14]. Inclusion of six 5\u2032-flanking, and nine 3\u2032-flanking nucleotides was based on an extension of previous findings demonstrating that the four nucleotides flanking either side of the consensus sequence were important for efficient sg mRNA expression, and that these nucleotides would increase complementarity with the leader sequence as presumably is the case for Gene 5 expression [48].",

Similar replication kinetics were observed for all three rIBVs and for control virus BeauR\u03945ab. However, peak titres at 24 hpi for all the rIBVs lacking the Gene 5 proteins were approximately 1-log10 lower, at 1\u00d7106 pfu/ml, than wild type Beau-R. Additionally, a 2-log10 increase in titre was noted for Beau-R compared to a<0.5-log10 increase at 8 hpi for all rIBVs suggesting a delay in replication or release of the rIBVs lacking Gene 5. Combined with the observation of smaller plaque sizes these results suggested that the replacement or deletion of Gene 5 had a minor detrimental effect on virus replication in CK cells. Northern blot analysis of rIBVs sg mRNAs demonstrated an increase in the size of the sg mRNA initiated from the Gene 5 TRS when compared to parental virus Beau-R, and which corresponded to the presence of eGFP or hRluc sequences (Figure 3C). Corresponding expected increases in size, due to the presence of the reporter gene sequences, were also observed for all the larger sg mRNAs synthesised upstream of the Gene 5 replacement site, due to the nested nature of coronavirus sg mRNAs.",

In addition, GFP-induced fluorescence was observed in CK cells infected with P4 of rIBV BeauR-eGFP\u03945ab (Figure 4A). To confirm the expression of active Renilla luciferase from rIBVs BeauR-hRluc\u03945ab and BeauR-IBVhRluc\u03945ab, luciferase activity was measured in CK lysates during time course assays for replication kinetics, and was found to correlate with levels of virus titre during infection (Figure 4B).

Sequence analysis of P4 of BeauR-IBVhRluc\u03945ab R1 established that a mutation had arisen in the codon-optimised hRluc gene during initial passage of rescued virus on CK cells. The mutation, an insertion of two uracil residues at nucleotide position 787 within the codon-optimised hRluc gene, led to a frameshift and alteration of the hRluc amino acid sequence downstream of amino acid 262. This frameshift resulted in a modified IBVhRluc protein, eight amino acids longer than the wild type codon-optimised version (Figure 5). Analysis of BeauR-IBVhRluc\u03945ab R2 demonstrated luciferase activity levels more closely mirroring those of BeauR-hRluc\u03945ab, suggesting the mutation within the hRluc gene of BeauR-IBVhRluc\u03945ab R1 was the cause of the observed reduction in luciferase activity (Figure 4B).",

We have recently shown that the IBV IR is produced as a novel sg mRNA and encodes a fifth IBV accessory protein, however, in Beaudette the IR contains deletions rendering the sequence more likely a non-coding region [42]. The successful rescue of infectious rIBVs was confirmed by formation of IBV-induced plaques on CK cells (Figure 6A), which were compared to the plaques generated by wild type Beau-R and control virus BeauR\u0394IR. In contrast to the \u03945ab rIBVs, deletion of the Beaudette IR did not result in smaller plaque sizes when compared to Beau-R (Figure 6A). However, plaque size differences were observed depending on whether the IR sequence was replaced by eGFP or hRluc. Plaques produced from BeauR-eGFP\u0394IR were approximately 1.5 mm smaller in diameter than those observed from BeauR-hRluc\u0394IR (Figure 6A). Investigation of the replication kinetics of the rIBVs revealed lower peak titres at 24 hpi for BeauR-eGFP\u0394IR of 5\u00d7105 pfu/ml when compared to peak titres, of approximately 1\u00d7107 pfu/ml, for BeauR-hRluc\u0394IR (Figure 6B); a result consistent with the plaque sizes observed for these viruses. Both Beau-R and BeauR\u0394IR had similar replication kinetics, showing maximal peak titres of 5\u00d7107 pfu/ml at 24 hpi and supporting the plaque assay data; indicating that removal of the IR sequence per se did not have any effect on the growth and replication of rIBV BeauR\u0394IR.",

This indicated that the replication differences observed between BeauR-eGFP\u0394IR and BeauR-hRluc\u0394IR resulted from the insertion of different reporter genes, and suggested that, in terms of virus replication, eGFP was not as well tolerated as hRluc at this genome position.

However, because of the naturally low levels of the IR sg mRNA due to transcription from a non-canonical TRS [42], we consequently observed lower levels of fluorescence from BeauR-eGFP\u0394IR than from BeauR-eGFP\u03945ab (Figure 4A). Reduced protein expression levels were confirmed by the observation that Renilla luciferase activity from BeauR-hRluc\u0394IR was also lower in comparison to that observed from BeauR-hRluc\u03945ab, with peak activity at 24 hpi approximately 2-log10 lower (Figure 4B). It is possible that these reduced protein expression levels may also be a result of reduced translation due to the presence of the wild type IR AUG upstream of the reporter gene AUG; a consequence of the cloning stages of the reverse genetics. This would need to be investigated further to determine the exact cause of the protein levels observed.",

For generation of rIBV BeauR-eGFP\u03943ab we found that although the initial stages of the reverse genetics were successful, infectious rIBV could not be rescued by passage on CK cells, or in embryonated hens' eggs. The successful rescue of two replicates of rIBV BeauR-hRluc\u03943ab was demonstrated by the formation of IBV-induced plaques in CK cell culture (Figure 8A). While similar sized plaques had been observed between replicates of the \u03945ab and \u0394IR recombinants this was not the case for BeauR-hRluc\u03943ab, where a mixture of plaque sizes was visible for R2. Such a variation in plaque size is often an indication of a mixed population and the observed plaque phenotype suggested that BeauR-hRluc\u03943ab R2 was not rescued as a stable molecular clone. This was confirmed by sequence analysis which identified sequence variation in a region initiating approximately 40 nts from the 3\u2032 end of the hRluc gene in R2 and extending into the inserted TRS required for the transcription of a sg mRNA for the E protein (data not shown). Additionally, a 3 nt deletion was also observed within the inserted canonical, CUUAACAA, TRS for the E protein in R1 of BeauR-hRluc\u03943ab, resulting in a non-canonical TRS sequence of CUUAA. The presence of nucleotide changes and deletions in this region suggested that the stability of these viruses was not optimal and that the introduced sequences required to ensure transcription of the genes were not well tolerated. These observations may offer an explanation for the failure of rIBV BeauR-eGFP\u03943ab to rescue as fatal deletions may have arisen in this region during the initial stages of rescue and/or passage.",

It should be noted that transcription of the sg mRNA for expression of the E gene from BeauR\u03943ab was from the normal Gene 3 TRS [41]. Heterologous gene expression was confirmed by northern blot analysis (Figure 8C) with an expected increase in size of the Gene 3 sg mRNA observed when compared to parental virus Beau-R. However, the size of the hRluc sg mRNA of R2 appeared smaller than that of R1 suggesting that the issues identified above, and confirmed by sequence analysis, may be due to deletions within the hRluc gene. Analysis of IBV RNA from CK cells infected with BeauR-hRluc\u03943ab R1 identified a low abundant sg mRNA, at the expected position above the M gene sg mRNA, representing the sg mRNA produced from the inserted TRS for the expression of the E protein. The low abundance of this new sg mRNA could result from an effect of the observed deletion in the introduced TRS, and/or may result from the fact that synthesis of a sg mRNA produced from an introduced TRS may not be as efficient as that for normal viral sg mRNA transcription. Introduction of a new TRS within the IR did not result in synthesis of a new mRNA species.",

The genetic stability of each rIBV was initially assessed by blind passage of the rIBVs on CK cells and characterisation by RT-PCR analysis to determine the presence, or absence, of the heterologous gene (Table 2; Figure 9). As summarized in Table 3, we observed instability arising at different passage numbers, depending on the rIBV, as shown by the gradual loss of the PCR product representing the heterologous gene, and the appearance of smaller PCR products indicating deletion of the heterologous gene sequences (Figure 9). Passaging of rIBVs in embryonated hens' eggs revealed the same pattern of genetic instability for each virus highlighting that selection pressures were the same in vitro and in ovo (data not shown). An investigation of these smaller PCR products demonstrated that each one represented a different deletion corresponding to the inserted heterologous gene sequence, as shown by examples in Figure 10. Sequence analysis of the smallest PCR product generated during passage of BeauR-eGFP\u0394IR demonstrated that deletions were not limited to the heterologous gene, and could expand into flanking regions of accessory genes (Figure 10A) as also demonstrated in a study by Shen et al. [24].",

Despite this, RT-PCR analysis indicated that large-scale deletions, as evidenced by smaller PCR products, did not arise until P7. In comparison, smaller PCR products representing possible deletions were observed as early as P5 for BeauR-hRluc\u03943ab R1, which may have resulted from the 3 nt deletion observed at P4 within the inserted TRS for expression of the E gene. Overall, analysis of the stability of BeauR-hRluc\u03943ab identified that passaging of this rIBV led to the rapid accumulation of sequence errors and subsequently deletion of the heterologous gene sequence.",

A difference of only one passage number was observed for the replacement of the IR while no increase in stability was observed for replacement of ORF3a and 3b, suggesting the stability of these rIBVs could not be improved.

We have demonstrated that the genetic stability of the rIBVs correlated with the location of a reporter gene, which indirectly correlated with the level of sequence modifications required in order to accommodate the reporter gene in the IBV genome. The replacement of Gene 5 with hRluc or IBVhRluc yielded rIBVs that were stable to at least P12 when passaged at an MOI of 0.01 on CK cells (Figure 11). When Gene 5 was replaced with eGFP rIBVs were stable to P8/P9 in initial experiments; a similar level of stability was observed by Youn et al. [27] in which a rIBV expressing eGFP from replacement of ORF 5a alone was stable to P5 in Vero cells. In our initial experiments no difference in stability was observed between rIBVs expressing heterologous genes from Gene 5 or from the IR with all viruses stable to between P7 and P9 (Figure 9). However, in contrast to the replacement of Gene 5 where stability was increased by at least 4 passages, no difference was observed in the stability of BeauR-hRluc\u0394IR when passaged at an MOI of 0.01. This suggests that controlling the MOI at which viruses are passaged may only be beneficial for some rIBV constructs; in this case the replacement of Gene 5.",

This variation in observed stability may be accounted for by the intrinsic differences between the luciferase genes. However, a previous study identified that in the case of MHV the firefly luciferase was less stable than hRluc when inserted at the same genome position [28]. In both this study and that of Shen et al. expression of heterologous genes following replacement of IBV ORFs 3a and 3b required further modification to the virus sequences to ensure the continued transcription of ORF 3c, the E protein. The contradictory observations regarding the expression of heterologous genes from IBV Gene 3 suggest the possibility that not only the position of the heterologous gene is important for stability, but also the way in which genome sequences are modified to accommodate the heterologous gene.",

This was in contrast to the replacement of Gene 5 or the IR, where once deletions were detected loss of the heterologous gene from the virus population was complete following 1\u20133 further passages. Although the replacement of ORFs 3a and 3b led to rapid accumulation of deletion variants within the virus population it took longer for these variants to become the dominant population compared to the replacement of Gene 5 or the IR. These observations highlight the requirement to analyse stability by sequence analysis rather than expression of the heterologous protein alone. Overall, our results raise the suggestion that the replacement of ORFs 3a and 3b may be a suitable target if the sequence of the construct can be designed to prevent errors arising around the inserted TRS for expression of the E protein that undoubtedly led to the rapid expansion of deletions within this region.",

In this study two such TRSs were required: (1) for expression of E from BeauR-hRluc\u03943ab and (2) for expression of the reporter genes from BeauR-eGFP\u0394IR and BeauR-hRluc\u0394IR. As discussed above mutations were encountered within the TRS for E from BeauR-hRluc\u03943ab that likely contributed to the overall instability of the virus in this region. The design of the TRS may have played a role in this through inefficient synthesis of the E sg mRNA, and suggests a sub-optimal TRS design. Similarly, in the \u0394IR rIBVs the TRS inserted for expression of eGFP and hRluc may be sub-optimal thus leading to the use of the existing non-canonical TRS-B for the IR. In both cases there was limited complementarity between the artificially inserted consensus TRS and the leader sequence of the virus beyond the CUUAACAA sequence. It is possible that increasing this complementarity would lead to more stable gene expression or, in the case of the IR, the switch in transcription occurring at the artificial TRS and not the natural non-canonical IR TRS. However, as discussed in the design of the artificial TRS's the full extent of the TRS required for IBV sg mRNA transcription has yet to be elucidated and increased knowledge in this area would be required to better design recombinant viruses expressing heterologous genes as additional transcripts.",

The proposed mechanism for this is via homologous, or non-homologous, recombination events between sequences of virus genomes, such as TRSs that would result in the loss of the heterologous gene and it is probably also the situation with the rIBVs analysed in this study. Following analysis of the types of deletions arising in the virus populations we observed that the majority of deletions began within, or close to, the TRS associated with transcription of the heterologous gene (Figure 10). As these are regions of high similarity it suggests that they are potential hotspots for homologous recombination events during coronavirus replication. In rIBVs in which the heterologous genes replaced the IR and ORFs 3a and 3b sequences, an additional TRS was inserted into the IBV genome, when compared to wild type sequence or Gene 5 replacement. The presence of an additional TRS would have provided an additional target for recombination events and may in part explain the difference in stability observed for each rIBV construct.",

Codon-optimisation of genes has been shown to increase the translational efficiency of heterologous genes in different cell types by balancing the tRNA requirements of the gene with those most available in a particular host cell type. Expression of viral genes has also been shown to be increased by codon-optimisation [53], [54] or decreased by codon-deoptimisation [55], and this may be important for expression of heterologous genes from vaccine vectors. Codon usage may also have a bearing on RNA stability by altering the secondary structures of RNAs, and so changes to codon usage may affect the overall stability of viruses expressing heterologous genes. We took the approach of altering every codon of the heterologous genes to those preferentially used by IBV in order to find out if reporter protein expression and/or virus stability would be improved. We found that protein expression of codon optimised hRluc, IBVhRluc R2, was approximately 2-log10 lower than standard hRluc from 24 hpi when expressed in CK cells (Figure 4B) demonstrating that in this case translation efficiency was reduced by codon-optimisation. It is possible that codon optimisation has resulted in the introduction of sequence elements that limits the efficiency of protein expression in avian cells, thus counteracting the original optimisation of Rluc by Zhuang et al. for expression in mammalian cells [56]. Our results suggest that codon-optimisation may potentially result in improved virus stability, as a 1 or 2 passage increase in stability was observed for BeauR-IBVhRluc\u03945ab during initial passaging experiments compared to BeauR-hRluc\u03945ab. However, a complete investigation of the translation efficiency of a codon optimised gene, using synthetic RNAs, would be required if such a modification were to be pursued for vaccine development.",

Overall, using the reporter genes described in this work, the type of heterologous gene inserted was generally found to have little effect on protein expression or stability. However, as not all eGFP-based rIBVs were rescued comparison to the corresponding hRluc-based rIBVs is limited.
