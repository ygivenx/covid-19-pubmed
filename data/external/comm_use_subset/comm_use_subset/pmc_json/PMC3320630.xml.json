Thus, the expression profile of gene associated with SPB was not highlighted in those studies. In this study, we have compared the gene expression profiles in the placentas delivered by spontaneous births only, i.e. SPB and STB, but not indicated preterm births nor pregnancies with other obstetric complications.

Each sample was interrogated by 54675 probesets, representing the transcripts of essentially all human genes. Over 47000 transcripts and their variants, including those transcribed from more than 38500 well characterized genes and UniGenes, were interrogated by these microarray probes. To reduce the technical variations in the experimental procedures in handling different samples, the microarray data were normalized using the Robust Multiarray Average (RMA) method [29]. We identified 1549 probe signals, or gene expression levels, that were significantly changed between the preterm and STB placentas (Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test, adjusted for multiple testing by the Benjamini and Hochberg method [30], adjusted p<0.05).

Furthermore, gene functions involving with actin filament (Table 5) were also over-represented among the genes up-regulated in the SPB placenta, including caldesmon 1 (CALD1), which is implicated in the stretch-dependent myometrial activation in human myometrium [42].

Recently, a linkage, haplotype sharing, and association analysis has provided the evidence for IGF1R as a SPB predisposition gene [14]. Previously, a 11-kDa proteolytic fragment of the insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP1) protein was reported to be up-regulated in the amniotic fluid and maternal serum of pregnant women with intra-amniotic infection [17]. Taken altogether, IGF and its associated molecues may play some roles in the pathogenesis of SPB. In our GO analysis, among the up-regulated genes in the SPB placentas, the frequency of IGF2BP3 and other genes involved in posttranscriptional regulation were 4.52-fold overrepresented (Table S7). Moreover, among the up-regulated genes, the frequency of IGF1R and 9 other genes involved in anti-apoptosis were 4.63-fold overrepresented (Table S7).

We have demonstrated that the IL1RL1 mRNA, as identified above, was detected in 60% of predelivery maternal plasma samples collected during preterm labor (24\u201333 weeks 32.9 weeks) from women eventually resulted in SPB. In contrast, the IL1RL1 mRNA was detected in only 3.7% of maternal plasma samples collected during the same gestational period in women not in labor. The data suggest that the existence of IL1RL1 mRNA in the predelivery maternal plasma is associated with preterm labor and/or SPB. This promising data warrant further investigation. First, how early does the IL1RL1 mRNA appear in maternal blood before SPB? Second, will the IL1RL1 mRNA in maternal plasma improve the sensitivity of the existing methods, namely fetal fibronectin from cervicovaginal secretion and transvaginal cervical length [43], [44], in predicting SPB? Third, is IL1RL1 mRNA in maternal plasma involved in all clinical sub-groups of SPB (e.g. with or without preterm pre-labor rupture of membranes, cervical incompetence, antepartum hemorrhage)?",

For example, it would be interesting to correlate the maternal plasma concentrations of these SPB-associated RNA with any clinical outcomes/parameters of the pregnancies presented with preterm labor. Besides, to further study the molecular functions of the above genes in pregnancy and SPB, one may overexpress or knockout the concerned genes in animal models. Nevertheless, the work presented here has provided the essential groundwork for such further attempts to study SPB. Before this work, the difference between the genome-wide expression profiles of the SPB and STB placentas had not been compared, and systematic identification of markers for SPB in maternal blood had not been possible. These issues were addressed at least partially by the work presented here.",

The analysis of SPB-associated placental RNA transcripts in predelivery maternal plasma samples facilitates the fairer comparison of pregnancies presenting with preterm labor and gestational age-matched pregnancies with no preterm labor. We reason that this fairer comparison with gestational age-matched controls will in turn lead to discovery of better and more powerful markers in predicting SPB.",

In summary, the current study has not only brought insights into the molecular biology of the placenta delivered by SPB, but also provided a list of SPB-associated RNA markers in maternal plasma for studying and monitoring SPB.",
