            "text": "Herpesviruses are subdivided into three taxonomic subfamilies (\u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3) based on both genomic composition and biology according to a well-known phylogeny [1],[2],[3] (Figure 1A). While all herpesviruses are structurally similar, the different subfamilies are highly divergent in genome size, content and organization. The genome size ranges from 120 kbp for varicella-zoster virus (VZV), which belongs to the \u03b1-herpesviruses, to 240 kbp for human cytomegalovirus (hCMV), a member of the \u03b2-herpesviruses [4],[5]. Gene-coding potential is reflected in the size of the genomes with VZV containing 70 open reading frames (ORFs) and hCMV containing \u223c170 ORFs. The overlap between the protein sets of the five viruses clearly supports the known phylogeny, but there are also some proteins shared among viruses not consistent with the phylogeny (Figure 2A). Although the three subfamilies are thought to have diverged from a common ancestor around 400 million years ago (McGeoch 2006), they still contain a set of 41 core orthologs present in all herpesviruses [6],[7]. Herpesviral core proteins are generally involved in fundamental aspects of viral morphogenesis (e.g. DNA replication, DNA packaging, structure and egress), and are consequently often essential for replication in cell culture [8],[9],[10].",

            "text": "Several genome-wide yeast-two-hybrid (Y2H) studies of protein-protein interactions in eukaryotes have been published over the last years, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae\n[11], Caenorhabditis elegans\n[12], Drosophila melanogaster\n[13], Plasmodium falciparum\n[14] and Homo sapiens\n[15],[16]. The first complete genome-wide interaction study, however, was published for the E.coli phage T7 [17]. With their relatively small genomes and few genes, viruses seem the ideal candidates for studying protein-protein interactions on a genome-wide level and to address the generally low coverage of Y2H measurements in a systematic way. It is therefore surprising that not more genome-wide studies of intraviral interactions have been performed to date. With the exception of bacteriophage T7 [17] and Vaccinia virus [18], most of the studies of viral interactions have been performed on small RNA viruses [19],[20],[21],[22]. Recently more studies have been focusing on larger DNA viruses. In addition to our previous studies of VZV and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) [23], a study by Calderwood and colleagues identified 43 interactions between viral proteins in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) [24]. Two Y2H studies on herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and KSHV have also focused on interactions between structural components of these viruses [25],[26]. To add to our understanding of intraviral interactions in herpesviruses we present in this article the first interactomes for herpes simplex virus I and murine cytomegalovirus (mCMV), in addition to a second and independent interactome for Epstein-Barr virus. Based on these data we are able to compare five related interactomes, obtained using a standardized experimental setup for all five species. From the comparison and extensive experimental testing by CoIP we conclude that i) genome-wide interaction studies are sufficiently sensitive for between-species comparisons to identify the basic sunflower structure of the interaction networks and their common core, ii) interactions are to a large degree conserved between orthologs in herpesviruses, iii) comparing interactomes from several species can improve the low coverage of individual Y2H measurements and iv) biologically relevant interactions which may not be apparent from the interactome of a single species, often become obvious when multiple interactomes are aligned and compared.",

To address the issue of false negative interactions, viral proteins containing transmembrane domains were cloned both as full-length and as intracellular and/or extracellular domains. From the mCMV Y2H analysis we observed that 33% of the tested preys, and 40% of the baits, gave positive interactions. Similar results were observed with HSV-1 and EBV with \u223c1/3 of the clones yielding positive interactions (Table S1). In total, the Y2H analysis revealed 111 interactions for HSV-1, 406 for mCMV and 218 for EBV (Figures 1B, S1 and S2, Tables S2 and S13). Combined with our previously published interactomes for VZV (173 interactions) and KSHV (123 interactions), we obtained altogether 1,031 intraviral interactions in five herpesviral species (Tables S2 and S13). To evaluate the coverage of our five interactomes we performed an extensive literature search which identified 257 previously published interactions for these herpesviruses (including human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) homologues). Of these 257 interactions we were able to detect 24 (9.3%) in at least one virus (Figures S3 and S4 and Tables S3 and S14). When comparing our EBV interactome with the recently published EBV network by Calderwood et al., 6 out of 43 (13.9%) interactions could be confirmed [24]. Such low confirmation rates are common to Y2H studies, even for studies within the same species, which in general suffer from low coverage [28],[29],[30]. For instance, in a previous study of human interactions only 2.3\u20138.4% of known interactions were identified [15]. On the other hand, this implies that \u223c3% of the interactions found in the present study have been published so far in the literature or identified in previous genome-wide screens in the case of EBV. In the case of HSV-1 our study added 102 new interactions to the network of already known interactions (coloured grey in Figure 1B). As is typical for such interaction networks, no apparent structure can easily be recognized.",

In a previous study we observed that the topology of the KSHV and VZV networks approached that of cellular networks as the viral interactomes were connected into a human interactome [23].

For this purpose, we used the orthology assignments based on sequence similarity and gene order (Table S5) [31]. Species within the same subfamily are generally characterized by higher sequence similarity between orthologous proteins. They also share more orthologous proteins with each other than species from different subfamilies (Figure 2A). In previous inter-species comparisons [32], very few interactions were found to be shared between different species (yeast, worm, fly). Unlike the previous comparative studies, the five different interactomes analysed in this study were obtained using exactly the same experimental protocols. Nevertheless, we still observed little overlap between the networks of the five herpesviruses. Of 488 (409 non-redundant, i.e. conserved interactions are only counted once) interactions between proteins conserved in more than one species, 140 (61 non-redundant) (28.7% or 14.9% non-redundant, respectively) interactions were conserved between at least two species. For any two herpesvirus species, we compared the number of interactions between proteins conserved in both species against the number of interactions found in both species (Figure 2B). Although the pair wise overlaps observed were small, they were nevertheless significantly higher than observed with randomized orthology assignments (Figures 2C and S7). Randomized orthology assignments for each pair of herpesviruses were obtained by first selecting the sub-network of conserved proteins between the two species, and then randomizing the orthology assignments for these sub-networks.",

            "text": "Herpesviruses share a set of 41 core orthologous proteins which are conserved throughout the three subfamilies (Table S5) [31]. These core orthologs comprise approximately half of the genome of HSV-1, VZV, EBV and KSHV but less than 25% of mCMV. They can be further subdivided into a group of 31 orthologs with relatively high sequence similarity (approximately 30\u201360% sequence similarity), and a group of 10 orthologs with little similarity (approximately 16\u201330% similarity) (Table S6). Based on this orthology assignment, we generated an overlay of all protein interactions between the core orthologs detected in any of the five herpesviruses (Core network, Figure 3A). Of a total of 283 (218 non-redundant) core protein interactions detected, 113 (48 non-redundant, 39.9%) were found in more than one species (Table S7). For the core network, we did not observe a correlation between sequence similarity and the number of conserved interactions detected (Figures 3B and 3C). For example, the interaction between the two tegument proteins UL11 and UL16 in HSV-1 was also detected in mCMV and EBV, although sequence similarity of UL11 and its orthologs across subfamilies is quite low (28%). This interaction was interestingly also observed for HSV-1 in a recent report by Vittone and colleagues [33]. In addition, interactions were not preferentially conserved between closely related species (Figures 3D and S8). Accordingly, overlaps between the interaction sets in the core network were not correlated to the true phylogeny of herpesviruses (Figure 3E). Indeed, the highest overlap was observed between HSV-1 (\u03b1-subfamily) and mCMV (\u03b2) which belong to lineages separated early in herpesvirus evolution [7]. However, since our phylogenetic trees are based on relative overlaps between the different species, we cannot exclude that a more complete set of core interactions might have allowed for better separation of the subfamilies. In contrast, when also including subfamily- and species specific interactions (i.e. the complete interaction network of the five herpesviruses with the characteristic sunflower structure, see Figure 4A), the analysis yielded a phylogeny that was consistent with the known evolutionary relationships (Figure 4B). This indicates that the presence of conserved subfamily specific interactions provides sufficient conserved and non-conserved interactions to accurately separate the subfamilies from each other.",

Our data provides evidence that the viral core network is extremely dense while the non-core network appears relatively sparse. However, since non-core interactions were tested in at most two species, and not in five as the core interactions, the non-core network may be equally dense. Indeed, no consistent difference was observed between the number of intraviral core and non-core interactions when considering each network separately (Table S8).",

The percentage of core-derived orthologs that were confirmed by CoIP significantly correlated with the number of species in which the interactions were detected in Y2H screens, suggesting that the accuracy increases with the number of positive assays (Figure S9B, Table S10). As negative controls, ten interactions which were not detected in any of the Y2H screens were tested in four viruses (39 interactions in total, Table S10). Although the confirmation rate of these negative controls seems relatively high (6/39 (15%)), it is still significantly smaller than for the predicted interactions and correlates well with the confirmation rates of interactions observed in 2, 3 and 4 species (Figure S9B). Due to the low coverage of the Y2H system many (particular weak) interactions were most likely missed, and the positively tested controls may be examples of such interactions. It also suggests that, although our core interactome is very dense, it has not yet reached full coverage. Since the confirmation rate by CoIP for the Y2H interactions in KSHV is not higher than for the predicted interactions in HSV-1, mCMV and EBV, we conclude that a high percentage of interactions between core orthologs are conserved despite low sequence similarity of some of the orthologs across subfamilies.",

While Y2H in general yielded few cross-species interactions, we detected a larger number of interactions by LUMIER (Figure S10B). The cross-species interactions between the HSV-1 UL11 and UL16 tegument and between the HSV-1 UL19 and UL35 capsid orthologs were mainly observed within a specific subfamily, in accordance with previous observations by Schnee et al. [35]. For the two other interactions, involving orthologs with both a high and low degree of sequence similarity based on Table S6, we saw a more promiscuous interaction pattern. HSV1 UL14 for example was able to interact with HSV-1 UL33 and its orthologs in all five species, suggesting that sequence similarity might be a poor predictor of interspecies interactions in herpesviruses. Additionally, we tested 4 core and 4 noncore VZV baits against prey libraries of all five viruses. As expected, the intra-species analysis (VZV baits against VZV preys) yielded the highest fraction of positive interactions (2.8%), compared to 0.5% positive interactions in the cross-species screens. Of the positive cross-species interactions we observed 4 core-core, 15 core-noncore and 2 noncore-noncore interactions (Table S11). When the number of positive interactions was correlated to the number of interactions tested for each class, we observed a significant enrichment of positive interactions for the core-core and core-noncore classes compared to the noncore-noncore class (Figure S11).",

Using the high-coverage core network, a map of conserved protein interactions in herpesviral particles was generated (Figure 6A and S12). One outstanding example for a highly connected protein in this virion map is the mCMV M51 ortholog (HSV-1 UL33, VZV Orf25, EBV BFRF4 and KSHV Orf67.5), which interacted with 14 tegument proteins. Since (i) 11 of the 14 interactions (79%) of this protein were found in more than 1 species, (ii) most Y2H interactions were confirmed even under high concentrations of the competitive HIS3 inhibitor 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole which can be used to suppress non-specific Y2H interactions (Figure S13A and S13B), and (iii) a majority of interactions were confirmed by CoIP (Table S12), we considered them as high-confidence interactions. Furthermore, 4 of the 5 interactions conserved in 4 herpesviral species are M51 interactions. One example is the interaction of mCMV M51 orthologs (HSV-1_UL33/VZV_25/EBV_BFRF4/KSHV_67.5) with M53 orthologs (HSV-1_UL31/VZV_27/EBV_BFLF2/KSHV_69), which also interact in 4 species with M50 orthologs (HSV-1_UL34/VZV_24/EBV_BFRF1/KSHV_67). M50 and M53 and their orthologs are involved in the nuclear egress of viral capsids and are well-characterised in mCMV, HSV-1, EBV and pseudorabiesvirus [36],[37],[38],[39]. Both M50 in mCMV and its ortholog UL34 in HSV-1 recruit protein kinase C to the nuclear membrane, which subsequently phosphorylates lamins to dissolve the nuclear lamina allowing the capsids to reach the inner nuclear envelope [38],[40]. In mCMV, we confirmed 17/22 (>75%) (Table S12) of M51 interactions by CoIP, and showed that M51 is targeted to the nuclear membrane by M50 and co-localizes with both M50 and M53 (Figure 6B). Our results suggest that M51 and its orthologs are part of a larger protein complex and may be involved in nuclear egress. Since most of its interaction partners are present in the virion tegument we hypothesize that it plays a role in tegument formation, and represents a possible link between DNA packaging, nuclear egress and tegumentation.",

Although there was little overlap between the five viral networks according to the Y2H maps, we were able to show that interactions between core orthologous proteins are to a large degree conserved between species of different subfamilies. By generating a separate network of interactions between core proteins of five herpesviruses, we were also able to overcome the coverage problem of Y2H and to identify interactions of interest from the common network which were not apparent in each single network.",

The same holds true for the conservation between all five viruses. Interactions observed in two, three or four species were all enriched significantly as compared to background expectations (Figure 2D). This argues that, although troubled with false negative and false positive interactions, Y2H as a technique is still sufficiently sensitive and specific to obtain data for a comparative analysis of related interactomes. Similar observations were also made for the recently published Campylobacter jejuni interaction network, where highly significant overlaps were found with both the Escherichia coli and Helicobacter pylori interactomes [41]. It is very likely that true overlaps between the herpesvirus interactomes are higher, but that due to false negative interactions we only observe modest overlaps. There are numerous reasons why interactions may be missed in the Y2H system, including improper folding of fusion proteins and post-translational modifications. In an attempt to address some of these issues we cloned all the viral proteins containing transmembrane domains as both full length and extra/intracellular fragments, which has been reported to increase sensitivity [42].",

However, when interactions involving subfamily-specific proteins present in at least two of the virus species were included, we were able to generate a correct phylogenetic tree. This implies that interactions involving subfamily-specific proteins are at least partly conserved. Indeed, several of the interactions predicted from KSHV and confirmed in EBV by CoIP involved subfamily specific proteins. From published literature there are several examples of core interactions being conserved between species of different herpesviral subfamilies, e.g. the interactions between HSV-1 UL31 and UL34 [36],[37],[38],[39], HSV-1 UL15 and UL28 [43],[44] and the HSV-1 UL54 self-interaction [45],[46]. Indeed, much of what is currently known about herpesvirus biology is derived from studies of Herpes Simplex Virus and extrapolated to other species. Our study indicates that it is effectively possible to transfer intraviral interactions between orthologous proteins from one species to another. Thus, by generating an overlay network from several genome-wide Y2H screens in related species, the large number of false negative interactions within each individual analysis can be overcome and a more complete picture of the core interaction network obtained.",

The cross-species interactions between the two tegument proteins HSV-1 UL11 and UL16 (and their orthologs), as well as between the two capsid proteins HSV-1 UL19 and UL35 (and their orthologs), were mainly observed between species within the same herpesviral subfamily. A similar observation has recently been reported by Schnee and colleagues [35], and may indicate that some binding sites are more conserved within herpesvirus subfamilies. The other two interactions could be detected in a larger number of cross-species interactions by both Y2H and LUMIER. HSV-1 UL14, for example, was observed to interact with all orthologs of HSV-1 UL33 by LUMIER. Previous reports suggested that HSV-2 UL14 shares certain similarities with cellular chaperones which may account for its promiscuous binding pattern [48].",

For instance, the interaction between M51 and M53 was observed in all species apart from HSV-1. Interestingly, when retesting UL33 interactions under more stringent conditions (Figure S12), the corresponding interaction between UL33 and the M53 ortholog in HSV-1, UL31, is clearly one of the positive interactions on both 2.5 and 5 mM 3AT. These interactions were not included in the HSV interactome to prevent an overrepresentation of interactions tested more than once. While not much is known about M51, M53 has been extensively documented to be involved in nuclear egress through its binding to M50 [35],[38],[49],[50]. The interaction between M53 and M50 was confirmed in this study in four viruses. In addition, from our study of interactions in VZV we observed an association between the ortholog of M51 (ORF25) with the M50 ortholog (ORF24) [23], and retesting of HSV-1 UL33 interactions also revealed its binding to HSV-1 UL34 lacking the transmembrane region (Figure S12). Finally, immunofluorescense studies indicated that M51 co-localizes with both M53 and M50 when using fluorescent fusion proteins. These results suggest a possible role for M51 in nuclear egress through its interactions with M53 and/or M50. As interactions between orthologs of M51 and M53 were observed in members of all three subfamilies, it is likely that this represents a conserved function of M51. Previous studies have indicated that the M51 ortholog in HSV-1 (UL33) is involved in packaging of DNA [51], and that it interacts with at least one of the subunits of the terminase complex (UL28) [52]. In the data presented here, UL33 was observed to interact with UL15 and UL28 in three different species. These results suggest that UL33 represents an association between packaging and egress. Studies done in HSV-1 have indicated that UL33 is associated with the external surface of capsids [53], which would make such a dual role reasonable. While it is not known exactly how UL33 associates with the capsid, the interaction observed between M51 and the smallest capsid protein (m48.2) in mCMV and EBV suggests a possible manner of association.",
