However, because of the nature of voluntary donation of human plasma, the production of human IVIG therapeutics is limited by the shortage of supplies; there are also great concerns over the potential transmission of human diseases from donors to patients. Animal-derived polyclonal antibodies have also been used as therapeutics for certain disease indications, one of which being the life-saving anti-venoms derived from horse sera2. These animal-derived polyclonal antibody products also suffer from some significant limitations, chief among which are the severe adverse effects such as allergic reactions caused by the high immunogenicity of these products in humans2.",

In the Tc bovine, the bovine immunoglobulin genes were genetically inactivated by gene targeting and the Ig functions were reconstituted by a human artificial chromosome (HAC) comprising the entire unrearranged human immunoglobulin heavy-chain (hIGH), kappa-chain (hIGK) and lambda-chain (hIGL) germline loci. Consequently, Tc cattle express fully-human IgG (hIgG)5,6. Through further optimizing the genetic elements on the HAC that are involved in B cell signaling and Ig class switch recombination, physiological levels of hIgG are produced in the blood of Tc bovine (2\u20139 mg/ml), leading to the production of 300\u2013600 g of hIgG in a Tc bovine per month6. Equally important, these Tc cattle can be hyperimmunized with a pathogen of choice to produce highly potent pathogen-specific hIgG which have been successfully used to treat a list of viral and bacterial infection diseases in animal models, and some of these hIgG products have entered into human clinical trials7\u201315.",

Development of a Tc system in a small ungulate species such as the goat is better suited for producing smaller volumes of hIgG for certain applications, including using hIgG as diagnostic reagents for serological testing of emerging diseases and as therapeutics for spotty outbreaks of infectious diseases and/or personalized therapeutic hIgG products targeting specific diseases. Goats also offer the advantages of having a shorter gestation period and growing to adult size much faster than larger ungulates, decreasing the time for herd development at much lower costs. Furthermore, because large numbers of Tc goats can be quickly produced, plasma from sufficient numbers of animals can be included in plasma pooling strategies to ensure a greater lot to lot consistency.",

Towards this goal, we transferred HACs into wildtype goat fetal fibroblast cells followed by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) to clone Tc goats. Here, we report that the produced Tc caprine expresses hIgG in the PBMCs and sera. We also further demonstrated that, with a H7N9 influenza A immunization study, the Tc caprine can be hyperimmunized and respond well to a pathogen of choice to produce pathogen-specific hIgG in the serum. Furthermore, functional studies on the elicited hIgG demonstrated high neutralizing activities against H7N9 viruses in vitro.",

We have demonstrated in the Tc bovine system that the ungulate regulatory sequences engineered into the HAC allows high levels of hIgG expression and a hIgG subclass distribution with IgG1 dominancy, closely mimicking hIgG expression in humans6. We reasoned that these ungulate regulatory elements, due to their high similarity in sequence among ungulates, may also render the HAC to function well in Tc goats. Based on this rationale, we established single cell-derived Tc goat fibroblast cell colonies by transferring the isKcHAC\u2206 into goat fetal fibroblast cells via microcell-mediated chromosome transfer (MMCT) and used the produced Tc goat fibroblasts as nuclear donors for Tc goat production by SCNT. In total, 194 cloned embryos were generated using five isKcHAC\u2206 containing fetal fibroblast colonies and were transferred into 14 estrus-synchronized does (Table 1).",

We recently reported our success in establishing a Tc bovine platform that allows, for the first time, the production of large quantities of highly potent hIgG (300\u2013600 g of hIgG per animal per month)6. Because Tc animals are raised in biosecure facilities with animal pathogen control measures in place, the Tc platform eliminates disease transmission from human donors to patients, a common concern in using human IVIG products. Moreover, Tc animals can be hyperimmunized with a pathogen of choice formulated with proprietary adjuvants developed at SAB Biotherapeutics to produce high titers of pathogen-specific hIgG, overcoming the low potency problems associated with human IVIG produced from general human donor populations. Indeed, by using several emerging viral infection diseases as the targets, we have demonstrated in animal models that pathogen-specific hIgG produced from the Tc bovine system is highly potent in treating these diseases6\u20139,11\u201315, with some of them having already been in clinical trials7,13.",

For certain biomedical applications, such as for serological testing and as therapeutics for small patient populations, it is more desirable to produce smaller volumes of hIgG products. It is also highly desirable to have the capability of swiftly establishing a Tc animal heard for therapeutic hIgG production in responding to sudden outbreaks of infectious diseases. In this regard, the goat offers the advantages of having a much shorter reproductive cycle and physical maturation time than larger ungulates. Furthermore, in addition to allowing plasma pooling strategies to be employed from a large number of Tc animals for greater lot to lot consistency, each of the Tc goats can be used for producing personalized-therapeutics at an affordable cost.",

However, this is only the first step in our efforts to fully establish the Tc goat system: because the goat endogenous Ig genes are still intact in the Tc caprine reported here, it is most likely that, as demonstrated in Tc bovine3, the endogenous goat Ig genes are predominantly expressed over the human Ig genes in goat B cells. The competition between goat Ig genes and human Ig genes would severely suppress the expression of human Ig genes leading to low level expressions of hIgG, a phenomenon that we have observed in the Tc bovine system when the bovine Ig genes are intact3; in addition, the expression of endogenous goat Ig genes may also lead to the formation of chimeric antibodies\u2014in certain percentages of the produced antibodies, the light chains are of goat origin while the heavy chains are of human origin, or vice versa. To address these issues, we have initiated the efforts to genetically inactivate the goat Ig genes to greatly enhance the production of hIgG in the Tc goat system and to prevent chimeric antibody production, a strategy that has proven effective in Tc bovine16. We have recently knocked out the goat Ig heavy chain, lambda light chain, and kappa light chain genes (triple knockout) in the same goat primary fibroblast cells. These triple knockout cell lines are being used for Tc goat production. Our goal is to achieve a hIgG production level in the Tc goat system comparable to the goat IgG levels in wild type goats17, an objective that has been achieved in the Tc bovine system. To test if the Tc caprine is fully fertile, we recently bred it with a wild type ram, and as the time of submitting this report, the Tc caprine was detected pregnant (with two live fetuses) by ultrasound at a gestation stage of about day 50. As normal fertility of Tc goats is important for quickly expanding a Tc herd, the success of this Tc goat in establishing pregnancy is encouraging, even though we are still awaiting the outcome at full term of the pregnancy.",
