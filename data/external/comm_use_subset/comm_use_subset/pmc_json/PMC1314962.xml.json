Speaker after speaker showed how careless disregard for the environment and its variety of life forms squanders potential new medicines, endangers our food security, and exposes us to new risks of infectious disease.",

For example, ziconotide\u2014a pain killer 1,000 times more powerful than morphine\u2014comes from marine cone snails that inhabit narrow ranges in coral reefs and thus are increasingly endangered by coral bleaching, mostly from global warming. How many other useful species are lost without our ever recognizing their potential?",

Black bears, which hibernate for several months over the winter without losing bone mass, could provide a clue to the cause of osteoporosis, an enormous public health problem. But bear populations in many parts of the world are threatened by habitat destruction and overhunting.",

In Lebanon, where diets are high in bread and refined grains but low in fruits, vegetables, and fish, a quarter of the children are overweight and a third of the women of child-bearing age are anemic. Malek Batal, a nutrition professor at the American University of Beirut, is exploring how wild plants such as fennel, mint, and salsify have the potential to increase diversity of nutrient intake and food security in poor communities. He found that wild plants offer antioxidants, flavonoids, fiber, iron, calcium, and many other nutrients. Being easily accessible, easy to use, and palatable, they also contribute to food security.",

Bell also identified the illegal trade in wildlife (especially small carnivores) in Southeast Asia as a dual threat to human health (as the origin of the SARS coronavirus) and massive species loss in this \u201cbiodiversity hot spot.\u201d She believes an interdisciplinary approach involving ecologists, microbiologists, medical specialists, and others will best advance research in the twin fields of human health and species loss.",
