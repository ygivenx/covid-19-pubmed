However, vaccination is only applicable as a preventive measure, and development of new vaccines is a slow and expensive process. As an alternative, the use of sera enriched for pathogen-specific antibodies has been suggested [1], [2]. Treatment with pathogen-specific antibodies could then be applied in a prophylactic as well as in a therapeutic setting. However, non-human derived sera often provoke an immune response, thereby limiting the maximum number of treatments. Other possible caveats are the fact that it is difficult to obtain large amounts of sera of the same quality, and the risk of contamination with pathogens, in particular with viruses such as but not limited to Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV).",

Indeed, the human immune system itself can safely be assumed to be the best in generating highly efficacious antibodies and these antibodies are most likely superior to those generated from mice or using phage display. In addition, such antibodies may have a better safety profile than antibodies derived from mice. Novel technologies to obtain monoclonal antibodies from human B cells include EBV transformation of antibody-producing B cells activated by TLR9-agonists [10], [11] and single cell PCR to obtain immunoglobulin genes from individual ex vivo isolated B cells [12], [13]. We have previously shown that with forced expression of BCL-6 in human B cells stable human monoclonal antibody secreting cell lines can be produced [14], [15]. We moved on to describe that ectopic expression of a constitutively active mutant of the transcription factor Signal Transducer of Transcription 5 (STAT5) in human memory B cells resulted in a differentiation block of activated B cells, preventing them to mature into plasma cells. STAT5 transduced cells resemble activated germinal center centrocytes and show enhanced survival and expansion [16].",

            "text": "Previously we have published that ectopic expression of active STAT5 mutants in human primary B cells results in a block in B cell differentiation and that these cells show enhanced survival and expansion [16]. We extended these findings by showing that constitutive activation of STAT5 in B cells led to loss of antibody surface expression when cultures were maintained for more than 6 weeks in the presence of IL-2 and IL-4 [17]. We then investigated whether we could exploit the immortalizing capacity of active STAT5 mutants in order to obtain human monoclonal B cell lines, which secrete antigen specific antibodies. For this, peripheral blood CD27pos memory B cells were cultured in the presence of irradiated CD40-Ligand expressing L cells (CD40L-L cells) and interleukin (IL)-21 prior to retroviral transduction with constitutively activated (CA) STAT5b (CA-STAT5b). Pre-stimulation with IL-21 induced strong proliferation, which resulted in transduction efficiencies of 40 to 80% [15], [18]. Following transduction, in-active CA-STAT5b is expressed as a chimera with the hormone-binding portion of the Estrogen Receptor (ER) (CA-STAT5bER) [16], thereby STAT5b is expressed in the cytoplasm complexed by heat-shock proteins. Incubation with tamoxifen (4-HT) leads to dissociation of the heat shock proteins from constitutively active STAT5bER, which results in receptor dimerization and subsequent translocation to the nucleus where it initiates STAT5 specific transcription [16], [19]. First we studied the effect of STAT5 transduced cells cultured with IL-2, IL-4 and tamoxifen or with IL-21 and tamoxifen. IL-2 and IL-4 induce proliferation of human primary B cells similar to IL-21 but IL-21 has been shown to also induce strong differentiation of B cells [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25]. The secreted immunoglobulin levels in the supernatant of the CA-STAT5bER B cells were measured over time. Around 3 to 4 weeks after transduction the level of secreted IgG started to decrease for the tamoxifen/IL-2 plus IL-4 and tamoxifen/IL-21 cultured cells (Figure 1a). We also determined the long-term effect of constitutively active STAT5 expression on IgM secretion. IgM expressing peripheral blood B cells were transduced with CA-STAT5bER and cultured with tamoxifen, IL-2 and IL-4. Similar to the IgG secretion levels, IgM secretion disappeared in CA-STAT5bER B cells after prolonged culture (Figure 1b).",

            "text": "The decline in immunoglobulin secretion corresponded with a decline in surface immunoglobulin expression [17]. This shows that with time, constitutive expression of STAT5 in human B cells leads to diminished expression and secretion of immunoglobulins. We questioned whether these effects could be reversed by de-activation of constitutively active STAT5 through removal of tamoxifen from the culture. We cultured the cells with tamoxifen, IL-2 and IL-4 for weeks to months until immunoglobulin production had vanished and then removed tamoxifen from the culture. In these cultures, when treated with IL-2 and IL-4 immunoglobulin secretion remained low or absent (Figure 2), but when they were treated with IL-21, IgM or IgG immunoglobulin secretion resumed (Figure 2 and Figure S1). The immunoglobulin secretion lasted for about 7 days (Figure S2). After approximately 14 days antibody production came to an end and the transduced B cells died [16]. It has been shown previously that IL-21 induces differentiation of B cells into plasma cells, but this was not observed in our B cells when STAT5 was active [18], [24], [25]. Together these data support the idea that IL-21 (but not IL-2 in combination with IL-4) induces strong plasma cell differentiation, which can be prevented by activation of STAT5 [16], [18], [24], [25]. Interestingly, our B cell lines maintained the capacity to secrete immunoglobulin after prolonged culture (weeks to months) and even after freeze thawing (Figure S3).",

TT is produced by the gram-positive bacterium Clostridium tetani. Infants are routinely vaccinated with a combination vaccine against diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, and poliomyelitis (DPTP) [26]. As a consequence, most adults have memory B cells specifically directed against TT in their blood that can be detected using PE-conjugated recombinant TT C-Fragment (rTT.C) (Figure S4) [15], [27]. Using flow cytometry rTT.Cpos CD27pos memory B cells were isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy donors and cultured on CD40L-L cells in the presence of IL-21. After 36 hrs the cells were transduced with STAT5bER-IRES-GFP and cultured again on CD40L-L cells, now in the presence of IL-2, IL-4 and tamoxifen. Seven days after transduction the cells were checked for TT binding (Figure 3a), GFP sorted and maintained in microcultures of 1, 5 and 10 cells per well, again in the presence of CD40L-L cells, IL-2, IL-4 and tamoxifen. Within two weeks a number of rTT.Cpos STAT5bERpos memory B cell clones could be selected (Table 1) and expanded further. Next we determined whether these rTT.C sorted cultures still had the capacity to produce immunoglobulins. After removal of tamoxifen from the cultures, rTT.C sorted STAT5bERpos clones resumed production of either IgM or IgG (Figure 3b and c). Next we determined the antigen specificity of the rTT.Cpos STAT5bERpos memory B cell lines. The majority of clones expressing either IgM (54%) or IgG (69%) were specific for TT as determined by IgM and IgG specific TT ELISA (Figure 3d and e). Together these data show that the immortalizing capacity of STAT5bER can be used to obtain B cell lines with the capacity to secrete antigen specific immunoglobulins.",

For this reason we determined the mutation status of TT specific STAT5bERpos memory B cell lines from one donor (Figure 3d and e). Monoclonality of memory B cell lines that were cultured at clonal density (Table 1) could be confirmed by VDJ sequencing per cell line, as only one VDJ sequence per cell line was detected (Figure 4). From this one donor, we obtained three independent immunoglobulin sequences \u2013 one IgG and two IgM sequences (Figure 4). Interestingly, one IgG and one IgM had a similar basic pattern of somatic hypermutation, with the IgM sequence containing 6 additional mutations, one of which led to an amino acid change. This suggests that these memory B cells arose from the same clone, and that the IgM clones had undergone additional somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation.",

In approximately 25% of the cases mutations leading to a crippled immunoglobulin expression can be found [32], [33].

However these cell lines do not express any immunoglobulins when the inducible active STAT5 mutant is \u201con\u201d. By subsequently inactivating STAT5 the cells regained the capacity to produce immunoglobulin offering an opportunity to screen the clones for secretion of specific antibodies. It should be noted that antigen specificity was not selected for by a functional assay. Instead, we used a binding assay (ELISA) to screen for anti-tetanus toxoid specific antibodies. It has been described previously however that TT specific antibodies selected through binding assays (ELISA) are functional as shown in a Toxin Binding Inhibition test (ToBI) and in in vivo TT challenge models in mice [43]\n[44]. Following selection of the antigen-specific clones the immunoglobulin genes can be retrieved from the clones. An obvious next step would be to scale up the production of antibodies through recombinant expression of the identified immunoglobulin genes in suitable cell lines. These recombinant antibody proteins can then be tested for other effector functions like antigen dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement activation or in vivo in mice for toxin inactivation properties.",

Indeed, direct isolation from the blood of influenza virus-specific B cells with a highly restricted B cell receptor repertoire has been described recently. However, healthy volunteers in this study had received booster vaccination against Influenza, inducing high percentages of antibody secreting plasma cells in the peripheral blood of these individuals [12]. Indeed, such abundance of antigen-specific plasma cells is unique. Much more often the frequency of antigen specific memory B cells is low, for example in cases where appropriate vaccines to induce such overt antibody response are lacking. In those instances the method described here may be applied to isolate human antigen specific monoclonal antibodies.",
