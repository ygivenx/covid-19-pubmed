Only a few studies report that MSCs derived from bone marrow or gingiva promote the generation of regulatory macrophages (M2)\n[17\u201320]. Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) produced by MSCs serves as a key factor for inhibiting macrophage-mediated inflammation in acute lung injury (ALI)\n[21]. Our previous work demonstrates that orbital fat-derived stem cells (OFSCs), MSCs isolated from human orbital fat tissues\n[22], are effective in modulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung inflammation\n[23]. The therapeutic effect of OFSCs in vivo is attributed to inhibition of macrophage-mediated inflammatory response, and the paracrine effect of OFSCs contributes the major therapeutic benefit. However, the circulation cytokine profile altered by OFSCs is not identical to that altered by bone marrow-derived MSCs in mice with ALI.",

Since a net mRNA expression may be affected by the dynamic balance of transcriptional regulation and post-transcriptional silencing mainly through miRNAs, deep-sequencing analysis and miRTar prediction were performed to identify the potential endogenous miRNAs in OFSCs, MSCs derived from subcutaneous tissue as well as MSCs derived from bone marrow targeting on inducible, secreted immunomodulating factors reported in MSCs (that is, IL-6, IL-10, IDO, hepatocyte growth factor, TGF\u03b2, sTNFR type I, sTNFR type II, and IL-1RA). Seven miRNAs were found to potentially regulate the above genes by target prediction (Table \n2). For OFSCs, the expression levels of hsa-miR-28-5p, hsa-miR-503 and hsa-miR-769-5p (transcripts per million < 1,000) were too low to act as a regulator for immunomodulation. hsa-let-7c, hsa-miR-370, and hsa-miR-423-5p were strongly expressed in OFSCs (transcripts per million > 2,000) but each of them targeted only one gene, making them less possible as the key regulator in this study. Hsa-miR-671-5p had a strong expression level (transcripts per million = 5,140) in OFSCs and potentially regulated those genes upregulated in LPS-activated macrophages, including IL-10, sTNFR type II and IL-1RA (Figure \n4), indicating that miR-671-5p may be the key miRNA in OFSCs regulating inducible immunomodulating factors under procytokine stimulation.",

We showed that miR-671-5p expression was significantly downregulated in OFSCs when co-cultured with activated macrophages (Figure \n5A). Furthermore, we identified the direct targets of miR-671-5p by transfection of miR-671-5p inhibitor into OFSCs. As shown in Figure \n5A, miR-671-5p inhibitor successfully reduced the miR-671-5p expression in OFSCs both under normal conditions and co-culture with activated macrophages. Inhibition of miR-671-5p in OFSCs resulted in increasing the mRNA level of sTNFR type II and IL-1RA, but not IDO and IL-10 (Figure \n5B). Notably, the binding sequences of miR-671-5p to sTNFR type II (Figure \n5C) and IL-1RA (Figure \n5D) demonstrated that the binding affinities between miR-671-5p and these two targets were strong, which is evidenced by a low minimal free energy and a high miRanda alignment score (Figure \n5C,D). OFSCs expressed the low protein level of sTNFR type II and no IL-1RA protein could be detectable in OFSCs (Figure \n5E). However, protein levels of both sTNFR type II and IL-1RA in OFSCs were increased after inhibiting miR-671-5p, which confirmed that cytokine levels in response to miR-671-5p were in line with the mRNA expression values (Figure \n5E). The above findings confirmed that sTNFR type II and IL-1RA were direct targets of miR-671-5p.",

The results showed that the redox status in a LPS-damaged lung parenchyma was significantly reduced by both OFSCs and OFSCs with preinhibition of miR-671-5p (Figure \n6A). Tissue sections showed that LPS triggered the inflammatory cell infiltration into interstitial space of lung parenchyma, and increased lung permeability by fluid accumulation in alveolar space (Figure \n6B). OFSC transplantation ameliorated lung permeability and inflammatory in the first 6 hours (Figure \n6C). Moreover, less cell infiltration and larger alveolar space were noted in ALI mice receiving miR-671-5p-inhibited OFSCs compared with those mice receiving OFSCs (Figure \n6D), demonstrating that preinhibition of miR-671-5p in OFSCs further enhanced the anti-inflammation ability in lung parenchyma without altering the antioxidative ability in OFSCs (Figure \n6A).",

In addition, the therapeutic potency of OFSCs for attenuating macrophage-mediated inflammation was stronger (Figure \n1B) than inducing macrophage cell cycle arrest (Figure \n2A). It is known that the number ratio of MSCs versus immune cells is critical for the therapeutic effect of immunomodulation in MSCs regulating lymphocytes (MSC/lymphocyte ratio > 0.1)\n[6, 31, 32] or natural killer cells (MSC/natural killer cells from 0.1 to 1)\n[15, 33].

Macrophages resident in tissues can be polarized as proinflammatory macrophages (M1) or M2 by the microenvironment\n[35, 36]. M1 exhibit proinflammatory activity to activate T-helper type 1 lymphocytes, while M2 promote T-helper type 2 responses via increasing phagocytic activities\n[34\u201336]. Different from bone marrow-derived MSCs and gingiva-derived MSCs, OFSCs did not promote M2 generation (Figure \n1C) but did significantly reduce the proinflammatory function of M1 by inhibition of TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 (Figure \n3) in the first 6 hours, indicating that orbital fat-derived MSCs regulate macrophages by targeting M1 rather than M2. However, we cannot exclude the possibility of M2 polarization induction by OFSCs through direct cell\u2013cell interaction or long-term paracrine stimulation. In addition, we did measure the miR-671-5p expression in MSCs derived from different tissue origins. The data showed that miR-671-5p is strongly expressed in OFSCs, is moderately expressed in MSCs derived from subcutaneous fat tissue, and is at a very low level in MSCs derived from bone marrow (Table \n2), indicating that regulation of M1 by miR-671-5p may predominantly exist in adipose tissue-derived MSCs.",

MSCs release IL-1RA to antagonize IL-1\u03b1 and to block TNF\u03b1 release from activated macrophages\n[21]. TNF\u03b1 and IL-1 are two critical cytokines initiating a series of inflammatory response in vivo[40], and IL-RA-expressing MSCs can modulate the inflammatory response in mice with bleomycin-induced lung inflammation and fibrosis\n[21]. In addition to IL-1RA, sTNFR type I and sTNFR type II are other inhibitory soluble molecules found in body fluid as well as tissues that reduce the toxic effects of TNF\u03b1 in the body\n[41]. sTNFR type II is one of the proteolytic shedding soluble extracellular domains of the tumor necrosis factor receptors secreted primarily by mononuclear cells\n[42]. Administration of TNF\u03b1 or LPS to human MSCs increases the concentration of sTNFRs in the medium, suggesting that soluble receptors may be part of a negative feedback mechanism to inhibit the biological effects of TNF\u03b1\n[43]. Yagi and colleagues report that the therapeutic effect of an intramuscular injection of human bone marrow-derived MSCs in endotoxemic animals is dependent on the secretion of sTNFR type I\n[43]. Our previous work demonstrated that systemic OFSC transplantation upregulated serum level of sTNFR type II, not sTNFR type I, in the first 6 hours after intratracheal injection of LPS\n[23]. In this study, we demonstrated that both IL-1RA and sTNFR type II expressions in OFSCs were consequences in response to IL-1 and TNF\u03b1 secretion by LPS-activated macrophages (Figure \n4D,E).",

            "text": "Recently, miRNAs have been identified as critical regulators of immune responses\n[44, 45], and LPS stimulation may alter the expression of miRNAs in macrophages\n[46\u201348]. MiR-155 is upregulated in LPS-activated macrophages in response to TNF\u03b1 interrupting macrophage differentiation and toll-like receptor 4 transcription\n[47\u201349]. In contrast, miR-125b is downregulated in LPS-treated macrophages for inhibiting TNF\u03b1 expression\n[48]. However, we disclosed that miR-671-5p in MSCs derived from orbital fat tissues played a role in regulation of IL-1RA and sTNFR type II. Although miR-671-5p was predicted to interact with IL-10, IL-1RA and sTNFR type II (Table \n1), only sTNFR type II and IL-1RA were directly inhibited by miR-671-5p (Figure \n5B,C,D). Reduction of miR-671-5p in OFSCs in a macrophage-mediated proinflammatory environment (Figure \n5A) resulted in the upregulation of sTNFR type II and IL-1RA in OFSCs (Figures \n4D,E and\n5B), which contributed to the anti-inflammation ability of OFSCs in vivo (Figure \n6D).",
