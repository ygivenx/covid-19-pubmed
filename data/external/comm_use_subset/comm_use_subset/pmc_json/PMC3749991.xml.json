The earliest western record of cholera dates back to at least 16th century, when cases were observed in India [1], but global pandemics of \u201casiatic cholera\u201d were first documented in 1817. Cholera can be endemic or epidemic, and is a disease with pandemic potential, with pandemics occurring as a result of genetic reassortment microbial strains [2]; the seventh recorded cholera pandemic occurred in the 1960s and cholera remains endemic in many countries [3]. Cholera is treatable with oral rehydration therapy and preventable with adequate sanitation and water treatment, and cholera epidemics have not been seen in high income countries since the early 20th century [3]; however, the disease remains a major global threat, with an estimated 3\u20135 million cases and 100000\u2013120000 deaths annually [4]. In recent years, Africa has accounted for over 90% of cases reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) globally, with majority of the remaining cases reported from low and middle income countries in Asia and South America [5], [6].",

            "text": "Cholera swept across Europe for the first time in 1831 during the second cholera pandemic (the first (1817) pandemic reached only as far west as the Caspian Sea). The pandemic originated in India in 1826 and moved along trade and military campaign routes to Central Asia, the Middle East, Europe from east to west across the Baltic states, and eventually to North America [1]. Notwithstanding this geographic march, cholera was not widely believed to be contagious prior to John Snow\u2019s work on the 1854 London cholera outbreak. Prevalent models for disease spread, some of which lasted until the end of the 19th century, included the diffusion of a poisonous \u201cmiasma\u201d, spread by tiny, invisible insects, and hypotheses related to the disruption of the earth\u2019s magnetic field or atmosphere [7]. While the dispatch of expert commissions to study the progress of the disease in far-off locales [8] and the deployment of military cordons to prevent the disease\u2019s spread in eastern and central Europe [1] suggest an implicit recognition of transmissibility, at least by civil authorities, medical professionals tended to deride those who suggested cholera might be contagious as superstitious and unsophisticated. As such, limited attempts were made to control the spread of disease using interventions that could be considered truly effective, and 19th century epidemics may, consequently, provide a snapshot of the true \u201cnatural history\u201d of cholera.",

Using cholera outbreak data from Bengal from 1891\u20131940, King et al. [9] estimated the basic reproductive number (R0, the average number of secondary cases produced by an index case of an infectious disease introduced into an immunologically na\u00efve population [10]) to be approximately 1.6\u00b10.3, while Hartley et al. [11] estimated an R0 ranging from 3 to 15 using average age of first infection and life expectancy data  from four past epidemics between 1985 and 2001. Their analysis yielded an R0 of 18 for V. cholerae in a \u201chyperinfective\u201d state. Similarly, the symptomatic attack rate of cholera is poorly estimated. Currently available studies suggest that the ratio of asymptomatic (or unrecognized) to symptomatic (or recognized) cases range from 3 to 100 [9].",

We used Brigham\u2019s data to parameterize simple mathematical models of cholera transmission; our objectives were (i) to derive R0 using the Richards generalized logistic growth model, (ii) to estimate projected ratios of recognized:unrecognized cases using Kermack and McKendrick\u2019s formula for final epidemic size, and (iii) to examine the utility of historical data for the parameterization of models of cholera spread.",

While it is possible that misclassification and underreporting of cholera could have been major sources of error in the data it should be noted that such misclassification would not have affected our estimates of R0: the Richards model evaluates rate (and hence R0) of growth in a manner that is independent of case counts reported. Distortion of R0 values could have occurred if case ascertainment changed over time in a given center; however, to explain the diversity of R0 values such changes would have had to have occurred in different ways in each city we studied, and consequently true variability in epidemic growth remains plausible.",

Cholera was a highly stigmatized in the 1830s, and was seen as a disease that struck the poor and immoral as a punishment from God [15]. Cases of cholera could have been underreported among communities that were supposedly immune to the disease, such as ostensibly temperate members of the establishment. Furthermore, the background level of diarrhoea and dysentery in communities is likely to have been high at the time [16], [17], [18]. Bacteriological diagnosis of cholera awaited the work of Robert Koch in the 1880s [19], hence the ability of clinicians to distinguish between \u201cAsiatic cholera\u201d, so-called cholera morbus (basically endemic watery diarrhea [1]), and other forms of gastrointestinal disease which shares the symptoms of Asiatic cholera was also limited. Since most cases of cholera only result in mild or asymptomatic cases, many of them were likely to have been misclassified as well.",

While subject to limitations associated with measurement and the absence of microbiological diagnosis, historical epidemic data are potentially extremely attractive for study for several reasons: as with early cholera epidemics, the absence of effective control measures means that observations relate to the transmission dynamics of the pathogen itself. Furthermore, advances in disease control through sanitation and vaccination have made many communicable diseases of public health importance uncommon, making the study of epidemic dynamics with contemporary data difficult. For example, Earn has previously demonstrated that regular epidemic cycles become chaotic once vaccination is introduced [22]. The study of historical epidemics can also provide important insights into the impact of economic development on health. With advances in public health and improvement in living conditions, cholera has practically disappeared from Europe and North America, save for a few imported cases each year [3]. As our data demonstrate, early 19th century cholera epidemics in Europe and North America had properties similar to those seen in low income countries today [23], [24], [25], highlighting the fact that it is not intrinsic characteristics of populations, but rather economic conditions, that determine vulnerability to disease.",

For cholera, the infectious period is estimated to be 3\u20136 days [29], and is assumed to be 4 days in our analysis.

In our study, the turning point between the first and second wave of cholera outbreak was determined by examining the incidence epidemic curve.

Using the expected final sizes and the observed attack rates, the proportion of unrecognized (asymptomatic or undiagnosed) cases can be calculated, and thereby the ratio of unrecognized cases to symptomatic, recognized cases of cholera can be determined.

Ma and Earn showed that the formula still holds \u201c(i) regardless of the number of distinct infectious stages, (ii) if the mean contact rate is itself arbitrarily distributed and (iii) for a large class of spatially heterogeneous contact structures\u201d [32]. For two-wave epidemics, this approach is problematic since I(0) is not equal to zero for the second wave. Consequently, we approximated expected final size for two-wave epidemics based on the best-fit single epidemic curve generated using the Richards approach.",
