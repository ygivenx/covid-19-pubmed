In particular, MoS2 has many advantages for biosensor development due to its electrochemical property and biocompatibility [14,15]. In addition, in order to maximize the benefits of MoS2 on a large activated surface area, MoS2 nanoparticles (MoS2 NPs) have recently been synthesized and applied to develop various sensors [16]. However, most studies related to flexible biosensors composed of nanomaterials have been done through complex manufacturing methods. To replace the complex manufacturing methods with a simple method for flexible biosensor fabrication, our group reported the flexible biosensor fabricated by a simple manufacturing method using the sputter coating and spin coating on a PI polymer substrate for uniform nanolayer formation. To fabricate an excellent flexible biosensor, PET can be an excellent candidate as the flexible substrate due to its properties including low cost, excellent thermal conductivity, chemical resistance, and dimensionally stability compared with previously used PI substrate [17,18].

            "text": "Numerous diseases including influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) are caused by small infectious agents called viruses [19]. Among the various lethal viruses, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has received massive attention since it causes AIDS which aggravates the human immune system, eventually resulting in death. Since HIV has a long incubation period and can be transmitted during this incubation period, its early and accurate diagnosis is a highly critical issue in the biomedical field [20,21]. The surface of HIV is composed of an envelope glycoprotein made of Envelope glycoprotein GP120 (gp120) and glycoprotein GP41 (gp41) which are connected non-covalently. The gp120 binds with the cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) receptors and thus, plays an important role in HIV infection [22,23]. Until now, to accurately detect HIV, various methods such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have been used [24,25]. However, these methods have limitations such as complex sample treatment process, time consumption, and low sensitivity [26]. To overcome these limitations, electrochemical immunosensors have been developed for high sensitivity and real-time detection of HIV.",

In this study, an electrochemical flexible biosensor based on gold (Au), MoS2 NPs, and Au (Au/MoS2/Au nanolayer) on a PET substrate was fabricated for the first time to detect the HIV surface protein gp120 using poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP)-modified MoS2 NPs on the PET substrate. PVP-modified MoS2 NPs were synthesized to prevent aggregation of MoS2 NPs, and to facilitate their effective dispersion on the PET substrate. Synthesis of PVP-modified MoS2 NPs was verified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD), while the fabrication of the Au/MoS2/Au nanolayer on the PET substrate was confirmed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), EDS, and atomic force microscopy (AFM). A gp120 antibody (Ab) was then immobilized on the substrate through the 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC)/ N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) reaction in order to prepare the biosensor (Ab/Cys/Au/MoS2/Au nanolayer). Immobilization of the gp120 antibody was confirmed by cyclic voltammetry (CV). In addition, the electrochemical property for gp120 detection was confirmed by CV and square wave voltammetry (SWV). A micro-fatigue tester (E3000LT, Instron, Buckinghamshire, UK.) was used to evaluate the flexibility of the fabricated Au/MoS2/Au nanolayer on the PET substrate. ",

EDS and EDS mapping images showed that the ratio of molybdenum (Mo) and sulfur (S) was approximately 1:2, which matched the theoretical composition of MoS2. Additionally, the average size of MoS2 (concentration: 1 mg/mL) was investigated by dynamic light scattering (DLS).

In Figure 3a, the AFM results of the PET substrate indicated a height of 1.296 nm. When Au was sputter coated on the PET substrate, the height of the substrate increased to 7.856 nm due to the deposited Au as shown in Figure 3b.

In Figure 4a, the CV results of the PET substrate showed no electrochemical signals, but signals were observed after Au sputter coating on the PET substrate. Also, the fabricated Au/MoS2/Au nanolayer on the PET substrate had higher electrochemical signals than the conventional bare gold electrode composed of gold (50 nm)/Cr (2 nm)/SiO2 (Silicon dioxide). The current increase of the Au/MoS2/Au nanolayer on the PET substrate compared to conventional bare gold electrode was due to the large surface area and the efficient electron transfer by MoS2 NPs.",

Figure 4b shows the CV result of the Au/MoS2/Au nanolayer on the PET substrate, the Cys/Au/MoS2/Au nanolayer on the PET substrate, the Ab/Cys/Au/MoS2/Au nanolayer on the PET substrate. The reduction and oxidation peak currents of the Au/MoS2/Au nanolayer on the PET substrate was found to be 1.13 mA and \u22121.17 mA, respectively. After Cys immobilization, the reduction and oxidation peak potentials were changed from 0.05 V and 0.35 V to 0.12 V and 0.28 V, and the reduction and oxidation peak potentials were also increased to 1.36 mA and \u22121.37 mA, respectively. This increase was due to the electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged [Fe(CN)6]3\u2212/4\u2212 and the positively charged amine group of the Cys immobilized on the Au/MoS2/Au nanolayer on the PET substrate. However, when the gp120 antibody was immobilized on the Cys, the efficiency of electron transfer between the multilayer and the redox probe was reduced by the gp120 antibody, and the reduction and oxidation peak currents were lowered to 1.30 mA and \u22121.34 mA, respectively.

To confirm its detection, the gp120 antigen dissolved in PBS solution was immobilized on the prepared Ab/Cys/Au/MoS2/Au nanolayer on the PET substrate for 1 h at room temperature. The detection of the gp120 antigen at a concentration of 0.1 pg/mL to 10 ng/mL was confirmed by SWV. As shown in Figure 5a, the electron transfer reaction between the redox probe and the biosensor surface was blocked by the antigen\u2013antibody binding on the surface of the fabricated biosensor, and the current value was decreased when the concentration of the gp120 antibody was increased. In addition, the linearity of the current value for the gp120 antigen concentration was confirmed through the results obtained from SWV. As shown in Figure 5b, the gp120 antigen ranged from 0.1 pg/mL to 10 ng/mL and showed excellent linearity with 0.973 of the coefficient of determination value (R2). In general, the concentration of gp120 in HIV-infected patients is approximately 200 pg/mL to 2000 pg/mL, therefore the fabricated biosensor showed the possibility for gp120 detection in practice. The mean value and the error bars were plotted with the standard deviation (SD) from four different measurements. The detection limit of an electrochemical biosensor composed of the Au/MoS2/Au nanolayer on the PET substrate for HIV detection was 0.066 pg/mL based on the 3 \u00d7 (S/m) method, where S is the standard deviation of the blank signal and m is slope of the linear fitting curve, and this value was compared with other electrodes shown in Table 1. To confirm the detection ability for the gp120 antigen prepared from a real sample, human serum was mixed with the gp120 antigen, and the detection of the gp120 antigen was confirmed by SWV. For real sample analysis, the gp120 with different concentrations from 1 pg/mL to 10 ng/mL was mixed with serum. As shown in Figure 5c, in the case of the gp120 antigen prepared in serum, the current value decreased with increase in concentration, the same as the gp120 antigen dissolved in PBS. The selectivity of the Ab/Cys/Au/MoS2/Au nanolayer on the PET substrate-based biosensor was measured by the addition of various types of antigens and proteins including Hb, Mb, PSA, and Trx prepared in PBS solution. The concentrations of the gp120 antigen, Hb, Mb, PSA, and Trx were fixed at 100 ng/mL. As shown in Figure 5d, the gp120 antigen had a low current value of 0.925 mA, while Hb, Mb, PSA, and Trx had high current values of 1.26 mA, 1.24 mA, 1.30 mA, and 1.26 mA, respectively. In addition, the rate of change of current value of gp120 antigen, Hb, Mb, PSA, and Trx were indicated 29.9%, 4.42%, 6.43%, 1.45%, and 4.60%. The mean value and the error bars were obtained as the standard deviation (SD) of five measurements. As shown in the results of the selectivity test, the measurement of gp120 was confirmed since the current value of the gp120 antigen, a surface protein of HIV was smaller than that of other antigens and proteins, and the electrochemical signal decreased due to selective immobilization of the gp120.",

SiO2-based rigid substrates were hard to bend using applied forces due to their lack of flexibility. However, Au sputter coated PET and the Au/MoS2/Au nanolayer on the PET substrate showed excellent flexibility and flexure extension with 1.60 mm and 1.54 mm, respectively. These results were significantly higher than those of the conventional electrode because these electrodes were easily bent by the applied force due to their excellent flexibility. In addition, the Au sputter coated PET and Au/MoS2/Au nanolayer on the PET substrate had flexure strength of 92.9 MPa and 99.2 MPa, respectively, which were lower than that of the conventional gold electrode due to the excellent flexibility. As shown in Figure 6b, the conventional gold electrode was found to be rapidly damaged by strong forces due to the hardness of the electrode. However, the fabricated biosensor had a high flexure extension compared with the conventional gold electrode because of the small force applied to the substrate due to the characteristics of the flexible substrate.

The fabricated Au/MoS2/Au nanolayer on the PET substrate showed the well-oriented NPs and uniform nanolayer formation on the PET substrate. The reduction and oxidation peak currents of the Au/MoS2/Au nanolayer on the PET substrate derived from the redox generator were 1.13 mA and \u22121.17 mA, respectively, which were much higher than those peaks of the bare gold electrodes with 0.96 mA and \u22121.01 mA due to the large surface area and effective electron transfer of the synthesized MoS2 NPs. The fabricated biosensor showed highly sensitive detection of gp120 with a detection limit of 0.066 pg/mL, which was more sensitive than previously reported electrochemical HIV biosensors. This biosensor showed a selective detection of gp120 added with various antigens and proteins such as Hb, Mb, PSA, and Trx.

In conclusion, the proposed flexible biosensor based on a Au/MoS2/Au nanolayer on a PET substrate can suggest the milestone for nanomaterial-based flexible sensing platform to develop the highly sensitive biosensors with flexibility for a wearable device application. In addition, because the gp120 concentration range of the HIV infected patient can be measured, it can be used in the commercial field.",
