Patients presenting with SI can pose a diagnostic challenge for clinicians in determining the underlying etiology; consequently it can be difficult to select the most appropriate options for treatment and patient management1\u20135. There is a clinical need for rapid diagnostic tests that can help clinicians distinguish between non-infectious, viral and bacterial etiologies of SI in (critically ill) patients. Without such tests, patients may be over-prescribed antibiotics when there is little clinical evidence of infection4, 6. Reducing inappropriate and unnecessary use of antibiotics, the concept of antibiotic stewardship, is essential in slowing the spread of resistant bacteria7.",

Furthermore, (iv) some sampling techniques (e.g. bronchoalveolar lavage, lumbar puncture) are relatively invasive. Finally, (v) some pathogens are not easily cultured. Although traditional culture-based methods are steadily being supplemented or displaced by immunological and molecular methods such as rapid immunoassays and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)11, 12, these newer methods also suffer from limitations, for example: (i) an inability to detect organisms not represented in an immunoassay or PCR panel; (ii) an inability to discriminate between live and dead organisms in a specimen; and (iii) a tendency to detect low levels of virus that may not be clinically relevant13.",

Our current investigation builds upon and extends previous host biomarker studies by identifying a molecular signature that is demonstrably specific to SI caused by a broad range of pathogenic viruses that represent all seven Baltimore virus classification groups and that cause infection in different tissues in multiple mammalian species. We used, as a discriminating function, the Area Under Curve (AUC) in Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC) analysis, and boosted specificity by employing a filtering step in our discovery process whereby biomarkers with high AUCs for non-viral causes of SI were removed. Independent validation of the signature in adult and pediatric cohorts demonstrated a strong discrimination of viral vs. non-viral causes of SI. Notably, this viral signature relies on only four biomarkers, and this high degree of parsimony should help to ensure the performance robustness necessary for effective translation to a rapid point-of-care format.",

These 14 discovery datasets (comprising 417 cases and 182 controls) spanned three Baltimore Group I viruses (cytomegalovirus, human herpesvirus 6, enterovirus), one Group III virus (rotavirus), two Group IV viruses (Dengue, hepatitis C), and six Group V viruses (influenza, Lassa virus, rhinovirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and measles virus). Next, a comprehensive, stepwise filtering approach was applied to 19 additional GEO datasets comprising a total of 1337 cases and 1106 controls (Table 1), to exclude genes that were differentially expressed in conditions that may present as SI but appear unrelated to viral systemic inflammation. The end result, after the filtering step was applied, was a \u201cpan-viral\u201d signature based on the expression levels of four genes: Interferon Stimulated Gene 15 (ISG15), Interleukin 16 (IL16), 2\u2032,5\u2032-Oligoadenylate Synthetase Like (OASL), and Adhesion G Protein Coupled Receptor E5 (ADGRE5). Table 2 summarizes what is known about the role, function and tissue expression of these four genes. Three of the genes (ISG15, OASL, IL16) have previously been reported to be associated with host response to viral infection, although they are not entirely specific to such a response. The four genes are all strongly expressed in whole blood and white blood cells, and to a lesser degree in most other tissues.\n\n",

For evaluation of the performance of the pan-viral signature in Baltimore Group I viral infections, we chose GEO dataset GSE4128 which was derived from a study28 of mice injected with adenovirus type 5 capsids (\u201cvector\u201d) or phosphate buffered saline (\u201cmock\u201d) (Fig. 1A). Adenovirus capsids are known to induce an innate inflammatory response28. Gene expression analyses were performed on liver samples taken six hours post-infection for both wild type mice, and mice rendered deficient for complement component 3 (C3) by gene targeting. We observed a clear difference (AUC = 1.00) in pan-viral signature values between infected and mock-infected mice. Whilst the authors found a \u201cblunted\u201d immune response to adenovirus injection in the C3-deficient mice, we found little overall difference in pan-viral signature response, suggesting that the absence of C3 does not affect the pan-viral signature value. Note that for analysis of dataset GSE4128, our pan-viral signature incorporated the mouse gene 2\u2032\u20135\u2032 Oligoadenylate Synthetase-Like 1 (OASL1), which is the ortholog of human OASL29. Also, two samples were omitted from our analysis because the study authors labeled each sample as both \u2018mock\u2019 and \u2018virus-infected\u2019 in the phenotypic table associated with GSE4128.\n",

Some example viruses in this group include parvoviruses (B19, canine parvovirus, bocavirus, adeno-associated virus) and circoviruses (porcine circovirus, chicken anemia virus). Porcine circovirus, type 2 (PCV2) is the primary cause of post-weaning multi-systemic wasting syndrome in pigs, which has had a large economic impact in the food production industry30. We analyzed a time-course dataset (GSE14790) derived from peripheral blood samples from Landrace cesarian-derived colostrum-deprived (CDCD) piglets infected, at post-gestation day 7, with subclinical doses of porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2, Burgos isolate). This study30 used an Affymetrix 24 K Genechip Porcine Genome Array to generate gene expression data. This microarray unfortunately did not include the OASL gene. We therefore were limited to analyzing this dataset using a linear combination of just two of the four genes, ISG15 and IL16, which carries most of the diagnostic power of the signature. Figure 1B shows box and whisker plots for ISG15/IL16 performance on weekly whole blood samples out to 29 days post-inoculation in piglets infected with PCV2. The ISG15/IL16 component of the pan-viral signature produced AUC = 0.94 for day 7 vs. day 0 comparison, and AUC = 1.00 for days 14, 21, 29 vs. day 0 comparison.",

We analyzed GEO dataset GSE13699 from a yellow fever vaccination study35 in which two geographically separated groups of volunteers (Lausanne, n = 11; Montreal, n = 15) were vaccinated subcutaneously on day 0 with Stamaril vaccine (Sanofi-Pasteur YF17D-204 YF-VAX), a vaccine containing live attenuated yellow fever virus that confers protection from 10 days following vaccination. Whole blood samples were collected on days 0, 3 and 7 for the Lausanne cohort and on days 0, 3, 7, 10, 14, 28 and 60 for the Montreal cohort. The pan-viral signature value peaked on day 7 following vaccination and dropped to pre-vaccination levels by day 14 (Fig. 3). The temporal behavior of the pan-viral signature suggests that the vaccine engenders an immune response that peaks on day 7 but does not persist beyond day 14 (as might be expected for the response to an attenuated vaccine).\n",

Post-infection, an increase in the pan-viral signature score was observed in rat hepatocytes infected with the adenovirus + GFP + HBV construct, compared to infection with the adenovirus + GFP construct lacking HBV. At the 48 hour timepoint, this increase was small and not statistically significant (p > 0.05 by one-tailed t-test, unequal variances assumed). However, at 72 hours post-infection, the increase was much larger and statistically significant (p < 0.02 by one-tailed t-test, unequal variances assumed).

All patients included in the study were admitted to hospital and received retrospective physician diagnosis (RPD), using all available clinical information at discharge, including any results of clinical microbiology and virus testing, to determine the presumptive etiology of the fever. Of the 90 patients comprising the FEVER study cohort, those with confirmed bacterial infections (N = 54) were identified by microbial culture of pathogenic bacteria from sterile sites. Confirmed viral infections (N = 14) were identified by positive nucleic acid detection or serological tests as ordered by the attending clinician (see Text S1). Patients who had no positive microbiological tests and recovered without empirical antimicrobial treatment (N = 22) were designated as indeterminate cases. Positively identified viruses in the \u2018virally infected\u2019 patients included Baltimore group I (herpes virus, varicella-zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus), Baltimore group IV (dengue virus), and Baltimore group V (Influenza A and B viruses). Figure 7, panel A shows box and whisker plots of the pan-viral signature, assayed in blood samples from the three patient groups. The pan-viral signature effectively separated febrile patients of confirmed viral etiology from those of confirmed bacterial etiology with AUC 0.93. All patients in this study had a fever (temperature >38.5 \u00b0C) at the time of presentation and blood sampling. The fact that the indeterminate cases recovered spontaneously may be most consistent with self-limiting viral illnesses, but interestingly only 2\u20133 of 22 indeterminate cases had pan-virus signature scores significantly higher than the proven cases of bacterial infection, suggesting that the majority of these indeterminate cases did not represent acute viral infections.\n",

Using all available clinical information, including clinical microbiology and virus testing, the patients were retrospectively diagnosed with bacterial sepsis (n = 25), bacterial sepsis with a viral coinfection (n = 10), viral SI (n = 5), or sterile post-surgical SI (n = 29). Testing of respiratory samples from the cohort, using the BioFire FilmArray Respiratory Panel (Biofire Diagnostics, Utah, USA), identified viruses in Baltimore group I (varicella-zoster virus; herpes simplex virus), Baltimore group IV (rhinovirus/enterovirus; coronavirus HKU1; norovirus Type 2) and Baltimore group V (parainfluenza 3; respiratory syncytial virus; metapneumovirus). Results are displayed graphically in Fig. 7, Panel B and summarized in Table 3.Whilst only a limited number of viral patients were included in this study (n = 5), the pan-viral signature resolved viral SI from non-infectious SI with AUC 0.91, and resolved viral SI from bacterial sepsis with AUC 0.76. Similar to our observation in the adult study (Fig. 7, panel A above), the pan-viral signature was much less effective at separating bacterial sepsis from non-infectious SI (AUC 0.60) demonstrating that the signature is specific for viral systemic inflammation and not bacterial systemic inflammation. Discordance between RPD and the pan-viral score in some cases suggests the possibility that either some patients had undetected viral infections, that the pan-viral signature had reduced specificity in children, or the study was not sufficiently powered to draw definitive conclusions.",

This study enrolled 273 patients of which 115, 70 and 88 received retrospective clinical diagnoses of bacterial infection, viral infection, and non-infectious illness, respectively. We analysed GSE63990 using an 8-gene classifier consisting of the four pan-viral signature genes (IL16, ISG15, OASL, ADGRE5) combined with the four genes (CEACAM4, LAMP1, PLA2G7, PLAC8) from SeptiCyte\nTM\nLAB. The line data used in our analysis is given in Supplementary Table S5. We applied a Random Forest - multidimensional scaling (RF-MDS) analysis43\u201345 using the combined eight genes. Figure 8 (Panels A, B) presents two different visual representations of the analysis, which show that the GSE63990 dataset has been resolved into the three patient subgroups of bacterial infection (green), viral infection (purple), and non-infectious illness (orange). An animated representation of this analysis, in which the figure is rotated in three dimensions, is provided in Supplementary Animation S1. To assess whether these 8 genes were contributing materially to the underlying biology, and thus to the clinical diagnoses of viral, bacterial or non-infectious illness, we used the resampling method described by Li et al.46 and created 2,000 permutations of GSE63990 in which the group labels were randomly shuffled. Application of the Random Forest model to the permuted datasets failed to resolve the three groups, after group label randomization. Thus the classifier was found to be significant under the null hypothesis. That is, the results presented in Fig. 8 illustrate a true dependency between the 8 genes and the response labels, at a significance level of p < 0.001. Additional details of the permutation test are provided in Supplementary Figures S7 and S8.\n",

Also, the possibility of bacterial or viral co-infection was not considered in our analysis. Furthermore, the diagnostic performance of SeptiCyte\nTM LAB and the pan-viral signature is dependent upon the accuracy of retrospective physician diagnoses of acute respiratory illness cases. There is some degree of discordance between the retrospective physician diagnoses and our two signatures, a finding that was also reported in the original publication42 when classifiers reported in that paper were used (35 of 273 patients had a discordant result (12.8%)). Clearly further validation work is required to demonstrate the clinical utility of combining both signatures, but these data provide a valuable insight into the potential of an assay that combines viral and bacterial host responses.",

We have termed the signature \u201cpan-viral\u201d because it has demonstrable diagnostic power across six mammalian species (human, macaque, chimpanzee, pig, rat and mouse), in multiple tissue types, in vivo and in vitro, and in infections caused by viruses representing all seven Baltimore classification groups.",

A plausible hypothesis regarding the functional significance of three of the genes in the pan-viral signature (ISG15, OASL, IL16) is that they relate to type 1 interferon signaling. ISG15, a well-studied component of the type 1 interferon-mediated response to viral infection, is a mediator of ISGylation, a protein modification similar to ubiquination49\u201352. OASL is a non-enzymatic member of the highly conserved OAS gene family53 and is also a component of the Type 1 interferon response to viral infection54, 55. IL16 is a cytokine with multiple functions, having been linked to inhibition of HIV-1 infection56, 57, modulation of HBV infection58, lentiviral infection59 and autoimmune and allergic disorders60, 61. A paper from some years ago62 demonstrated that IFN-\u03b1 induces the secretion of IL-16 by several cell types. A more recent paper63 reported a negative effect of IFN-\u03b21a (a type 1 interferon) on the expression level of IL-16; thus IL16 may also be functionally related to the Type 1 interferon pathway, although the linkage is not especially well studied or documented. Finally, although ADGRE5 has not been linked to interferon Type 1 signaling, this gene has previously been directly associated with host response to infection by human papilloma virus64 and HIV65. Additionally, the ADGRE5 ligand DAF (decay accelerating factor) is the cellular receptor for both echovirus66, 67 and coxsackie virus68, 69.",

            "text": "Context for our work is found in prior studies describing transcriptional signatures that were designed to distinguish between some viral, bacterial, and non-infectious SI conditions. However, we have found that prior work was limited by either a large number of genes/probes required, a lack of specificity of the signatures in light of other possible causes of SI, or a lack of validation across a broad range of virus types. For example, Zaas et al.19 identified a 30-gene signature from microarray analysis of symptomatic vs. asymptomatic subjects infected with rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, or influenza A; this signature was able to discriminate symptomatic influenza A-infected subjects from both healthy subjects and bacterially-infected subjects in a second independent cohort. Other researchers17, 18, 20, 70 have described signatures for discriminating between viral infections and other conditions, but with limitations relating to the large number of biomarkers in the signature (>18), a limited number of viruses examined, or a lack of demonstrated specificity with respect to possible bacterial co-infection or SI due to non-infectious causes. Tsalik et al.42 identified host gene expression signatures for viral, bacterial and non-infectious causes of acute respiratory inflammation. Whilst respiratory illness accounts for a large proportion of patients presenting to emergency clinics, the viral signature identified in this study consisted of a large number of genes (n = 33) and was not validated on patients with SI as a result of viral infection of body systems other than respiratory. Sweeney et al.22, 71 described an 11-gene signature for differentiating infectious and non-infectious SI, and also a 7-gene signature for differentiating bacterial and viral SI, but not non-infectious SI. Used in succession the authors claimed that such signatures could be used as an \u201cintegrated antibiotics decision model\u201d. Finally, Herberg et al.23 described a two-gene signature for differentiating viral and bacterial infection in febrile children. This signature was developed without using a cohort of non-infectious SI and therefore the output is binary and assumes that patients have a viral or bacterial infection.",

Analysis of the time-course datasets revealed that, in general, it took up to three days post-exposure for the pan-viral signature to first register a significant difference compared to pre-exposure samples; the pan-viral signature response coincided with the ability to first detect virus in tissue but preceded viremia, clinical signs and antibody response.",

Once the assay has been translated to a single assay technology and sample type, then more precise comparisons between different viral infections and disease severities can be made. Second, Baltimore Group II is under-represented in our validation data. The dataset that we analyzed (GSE14790, porcine circovirus infection) did not include OASL. Because the genes comprising the pan-viral signature were discovered by a process in which gene pairs were linearly combined, we present results for the linear combination of ISG15 and IL16, which still carries significant diagnostic power in the cohort tested (GSE14790). We expect that eventually additional Baltimore group II datasets will become available, which will allow a more in-depth validation of the pan-viral signature performance in this viral group.",

For example, in combination with a bacterial signature that has inherent high negative predictive value, the pan-viral signature could potentially be a useful tool in an antibiotic stewardship program, or in providing guidance for ongoing diagnostic testing. It could also prove useful in identifying patients early in the course of a viral infection, which in turn could affect decisions on infection control and patient isolation, especially in disease outbreaks.

The class labels used in GSE63990 were: bacterial infection, viral infection, and non-infectious illness. Line data from GSE63990 are presented in Supplementary Table S5. To assess whether a significant biological response exists from the eight genes, we performed a permutation test. Under this statistical framework the dependency between the feature space and the response (class labels) is broken thus allowing us to understand the behavior of the model under the null hypothesis that the explanatory variables and response labels are independent. The model, in this case, consisted of a supervised Random Forest analysis43 constructed from 1000 trees and allowing \u221af features to be selected randomly at each split, where f = 8 and represents the number of gene targets. The class labels were then randomly permuted 2,000 times which allowed for a 0.05 alpha level with a 0.01 precision87. The data were then modeled using Random Forests. For each null model the multiclass log-loss was calculated to construct the null distribution before assessing the true response labels against the final null model.",
