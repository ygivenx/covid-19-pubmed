Previous epidemiological studies among commercial pilots have studied cancer [1], cardiovascular disease [2], sleeping disorders [3], and medical symptoms on eyes, nose, skin and general symptoms [4\u20137]. Some studies have investigated respiratory health and allergy among pilots. Two studies on mortality among commercial pilots from UK and Greece reported that standardized mortality ratio due to respiratory illness among pilots was lower than in the general population [8] [9]. A study on morbidity among pilots from New Zealand reported that pilots have a lower prevalence of asthma (4.2%) as compared to the general population (9.6%) in New Zealand [10]. Allergic rhinitis is a common disease among pilots, which can increase the risk for acute sinusitis [11]. Air recirculation has been suggested as a risk factor for airway infections in aircraft, but one study found the same prevalence of airway infections among pilots on flight with cabin air re-circulation (10.6%) and without cabin air re-circulation (10.1%) [6]. One Danish study reported a mean value of 1.6 airway infections (range 0\u20138) per year among Danish pilots, and almost half of the pilots continues their flight duty without reporting the infection [12]. There are few studies about prevalence or incidence of asthma, allergies, bronchitis, and airway infections among commercial airline pilots.",

Nowadays the pilots spend all time in the cockpit which has a separate ventilation system. However, when this study was performed, before the 11th September terrorist attack, pilots could spent shorter periods during cruise in the forward part of the cabin socializing with the cabin attendants. Existing studies on spread of infections in aircraft have mainly focused on transmission among passengers and airline crews. Airborne pathogen transmission were reported to be associated with sitting within two rows of the index person on board during more than 8 hours [13]. The transmission is believed to be by large droplets, and increased ventilation rate can decrease the infection risk [13]. Spread of influenza follows previously observed transmission model, but passengers sitting further away than two rows can be infected [13]. Transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) can occur on board faster and at wider areas than the typical transmission model [14]. One tracing contact study of SARS among 1766 passengers found no spread of SARS [15]. Another study of SARS infection traced 304 passengers and crew with one or two index person on board, and reported 23 infections [14]. The relative risk of passengers sitting within three rows in front of the index person was 3.1, compared to passengers seated elsewhere in the cabin [14]. Two tracing contact studies of the swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 from UK and US have reported an attack rate of 4.3% [16] and 5.2% [17] respectively among passengers from flights carrying one index passenger, but no crew got infected [17]. The transmission during air travel is a common concern, since it contributes to inter-continental spread of pathogens.",

Only few studies have investigated the cockpit environment. The cockpit ventilation flow is high (usually 60\u201380 L/s of outdoor air per person) and there is no air recirculation [6, 18]. The cockpit relative air humidity is typically below 10% during cruise [19], and the temperature is around 22\u201326\u00b0C[19, 20]. Sometimes the cockpit temperature varies because of poor control [20]. One study found that the mean concentration of carbon dioxide in the cockpit is usually around 500\u2013700 ppm, indicating a sufficient ventilation rate [19]. The mean concentrations of nitrogen dioxide and ozone in the cockpit were 7 \u03bcg/m3 and 26.3 \u03bcg/m3 respectively, and the highest level of ozone was 76.1 \u03bcg/m3 [19]. One study reported that the ozone level in an aircraft with an old ozone converter could be similar to that in the aircraft without an ozone converter [21]. The level of formaldehyde in the cockpit was under the detection limit (<5 \u03bcg/m3) [19].",

Besides the psychosocial work environment, the ban of smoking on board for Scandinavian airlines started from 1 Sep, 1997. Before that smoking was allowed and the level of respirable particles was high in the cockpit environment [19, 25]. Beneficial effects of ban of smoking on board with respect to eye symptoms and tiredness among pilots has been reported [25], but we found no previous studies evaluated the effects of ban of smoking on board with respect to respiratory illness and allergies among pilots.",

The study is unique and we found no previous longitudinal study on development of asthma, bronchitis, nonspecific hyperreactivity and airway infections among pilots. However, the number of incident cases was relatively low, which limits the power of the study. Despite this limitation we found a number of significant associations but sometimes with wide confidence intervals. Moreover, the study only covered pilots from one airline company which could limit the generalizability of the study. Another limitation is that we did not have any clinical tests to diagnose airway infections, asthma or pollen or furry pet allergy (self-reported atopy). However, some validation studies on questionnaire data on asthma and allergy are available. A review article concluded that self-reported data on doctors\u2019 diagnosed asthma has high specificity (94%) when validating against clinical diagnosis but lower sensitivity (68%) [31]. Three European validation studies of self-reported allergy to pollen or furry pets in adults, using objective allergy testing as gold standard, found good specificity (89\u201397%) but lower sensitivity (28\u201355%) for self-reported allergy [32\u201334] Thus a majority of those reporting doctors\u2019 diagnosed asthma, pollen or furry pet allergy could be expected to have asthma or atopic sensitization (allergy), and an underestimation rather than an overestimation of the true prevalence could be expected.",

Moreover, nonparticipants were less satisfied with their working conditions and were less exposed to ETS on board at baseline. These results indicate a health based selection where more healthy pilots tended to join the cohort, which could lead to an underestimation of the risks of the work exposure. However, for home environment exposure, we found no difference between participants and nonparticipants. The questionnaire included questions on the symptoms, as well as questions about the work environment and the home environment. This may introduce recall bias in the cross-sectional analysis.

Most of the pilots (94.7%) were men, mean age at baseline was 45 y. At baseline, totally eleven pilots reported that they had ever had asthma and six of them had the asthma diagnosed by a doctor (1.4%). The low prevalence of doctor\u2019s diagnosed asthma could be due to selection since pilots have regular medical examinations, and are not allowed to have severe or uncontrolled asthma. However, mild or moderate asthma is allowed if it is well controlled [35]. The incidence of doctors\u2019 diagnosed asthma was 2.4 cases per 1000 person\u00b7years in our study, if we exclude the pilot reporting asthma, not diagnosed by a doctor, at baseline. A Swedish population based cohort study (mean age 34 years at baseline) from 1980\u20131993 reported that the overall incidence rate of adult onset asthma was 1.1 per 1000 person\u00b7years, 1.0 per 1000 person\u00b7years among males, and 1.3 per 1000 person\u00b7years among females [36]. A study among general Nordic population (mean age 40 years at baseline) during 1999\u20132001 reported that the incidence of doctor diagnosed asthma was 2.2 cases per 1000 person\u00b7years, 1.5 cases per 1000 person\u00b7years among males, and 2.9 cases per 1000 person\u00b7years among females [37]. Our study was conducted during a similar study period (1997\u20132000), and the mean age of the pilot cohort was 45 years. Thus we can conclude that the incidence of doctor diagnosed asthma in our study among commercial pilots was similar as in the general population in Northern Europe. In our study, the prevalence of self-reported atopy (pollen or furry pet allergy) was 20.4% at baseline and the incidence rate was 16.6 per 1000 person\u00b7years during follow-up. The prevalence among the pilots was higher than the 14% of pollen or furry pet allergy reported from a study from 1997 in a random sample of the Swedish population follow-up [38]. We found no study on incidence of atopy in the general adult population in Sweden from the same time period as our study.",

It could be a selection effect, where pilots who easily get airway infections leave the occupation. It could also be that age is associated with the family situation. Older pilots may have less smaller children at home who can bring infections from schools or day care centres to the family. Moreover, we found that the prevalence of airway infections was positively associated with atopy. We found no previous population study from Sweden on associations between atopy and airway infections among adults. Finally, we found that smokers reported more bronchitis but less nonspecific hyper-reactivity in the cross-sectional study. It is well known that smokers develop bronchitis[40], but the negative association between smoking and nonspecific hyper-reactivity was unexpected. However, the question on nonspecific hyperreactivity asked about irritation easily in eyes or airways when exposed to traffic exhausts, perfume or tobacco smoke and the negative association could be because smokers are more used to environmental tobacco smoke. However, since smokers have a lower ability to smell and taste [41, 42], they may have less ability to perceive sensory irritation from odours or irritants.",

It is a sign of damp indoor environment and is a risk factor for growth of house dust mites in homes [43]. Homes with reported window pane condensation in winter has significantly lower air exchange rate, higher relative air humidity and higher levels of house dust mite allergens and total volatile organic compounds (TVOC) as compared to homes without window condensation [44]. Window pane condensation has been reported to be associated with increased prevalence of wheeze in children in Sweden [45] and female university students in Japan [46]. In addition, we asked about presence of signs of dampness and mould the last 12 months in the home [26]. Reports on dampness or mould at home were associated with increased prevalence of asthma symptoms and airway infections. This finding is in agreement with previous studies and a review from WHO have concluded that there is sufficient evidence that dampness and mould is associated with asthma symptoms [47] symptoms. Dampness and mold have also been reported to be associated with respiratory infections [48].",

We found that those living in newer home buildings (after 1975) had a higher incidence of airway infections. In a previous population study among adults in Sweden, there was an increased prevalence of respiratory infections among adults living in houses constructed from 1976\u20131985 while no increased prevalence was observed for homed constructed after 1985. In this study, adults living in buildings constructed before 1960 were used as reference category [49]. The drastic increase of the energy price in 1975 initiated measures to reduce the energy consumption in Swedish buildings. Moreover, a self- level mortal containing casein was used in Swedish buildings from 1997\u20131983. This product caused emission of odorous compounds such as ammonia and 2-acetophenone from the floor [50]. Thus it is possible that the increased prevalence of respiratory infections among pilots living in homes constructed after 1975 was due to energy saving measures as well as the introduction of new building materials, resulting in an impairment of the indoor environment. Moreover, one recent study from South Korea found that moving to a new house may increase the prevalence of asthma symptoms [51].",

The issue on health effects of emissions from building materials is a complex issue. In Sweden, some houses are made of wood but most are concrete buildings. Formaldehyde emission form chipboard is not a major problem anymore because of well controlled production of the chipboard, and the mean formaldehyde levels in Swedish homes are low (mean 22 \u03bcg/m3) [52]. The literature suggests that building dampness, indoor mould and ETS are the most important risk factors for respiratory illness in the home environment and the role of specific chemical emissions from building materials is more unclear [53].",

Finally we found that pilots with furry pets at home had a lower prevalence of atopy. This is in agreement with a recent population study among adults in Stockholm, showing a negative association between keeping furry pets and pollen allergy [55]. The most probable reason for the negative association is selection, where allergic persons avoid keeping furry pets.",

Change of flight type was associated with increase of new onset of airway infection. Pilots who changed type of flights, both those from long- to short-haul and those from short- to long-haul, reported more airway infections at follow-up. We have no clear explanation to this finding, but it is possible that some pilots change flight type because of some health problems and that these health problems are associated with an increased risk for respiratory infections. We found that pilots who reported less control over the work situation during the follow up developed more atopy. Less control over the work conditions is expected to be a psychosocial risk factor at work. In a previous cross-sectional study on associations between the psychosocial work environment in the Swedish workforce, atopy and asthma symptoms, no associations were found between low control and atopy [24].",

However, some health associations were found for the work environment. Lack of work control can be a risk factor for the development of allergic symptoms in pilots and changing of flight can be a risk factor for developing airway infections. Environmental tobacco smoke at home, window pane condensation in winter, and dampness and mould at home can be risk factors for asthma symptoms, airway infections and allergy among commercial pilots. The home environment should not be neglected when assessing associations between occupational risk factors and respiratory illness.",
