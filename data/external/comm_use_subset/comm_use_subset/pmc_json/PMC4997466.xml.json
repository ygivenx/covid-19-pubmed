Ebola virus disease (EVD), also known as Ebola hemorrhagic fever, was first identified in Yambuku and the surrounding areas in Zaire and South Sudan in 1976 [2,3]. The largest outbreak, recently, began in Guinea in December 2013 and had exceeded all of the previous outbreaks combined [2,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]. The infected initially experienced atypical clinical symptoms of fever, headache, joint/muscle pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain [13,14]. It could be misdiagnosed as some other diseases sharing similar clinical signs, such as malaria or dengue fever [15]. Considering those symptomatic persons evading diagnosis and treatment, the delayed release of laboratory diagnostic data, and the infected person who died undiagnosed, the actual number of the infected could be even higher than announced by WHO [16]. Despite the EVD cases reported in a few countries, the unprecedented concerns had been focused worldwide.",

            "text": "China now has a well-established network to satisfy the increasing demand from netizens. According to the China Internet Development Statistical Report, it claimed a total of 632 million Internet users (46.9% of the whole population) and 527 million mobile Internet users as of 30 June 2014. Meanwhile, the utilization rate of mobile phones (83.4%) first surpassed the traditional personal computer (PC) (80.9%) as one of the commonly used browsing devices. Thanks to extended Wi-Fi coverage, the growing maturity of 3G networks and the enabled 4G networks, Chinese Internet users were online for an average of 25.9 h per week in 2014 [17]. The report also claimed that microblogs and social networking sites had been inevitably shocked by some social applications, such as Wechat. This could be caused by the advantage of the interactivity of Wechat over traditional social media. However, it is undeniable that social media still has its market with user populations accounting for 40.7% of Internet users (nearly 257 million). As the most popular microblog in China, Sina Microblog had the largest number of users, approximately 368 million at the end of 2012 [18]. Furthermore, the Sina Micro Index (SMI), being able to investigate blog data posted and forwarded daily by searching keywords, might mirror the topics focused on by Internet users. On the other hand, searching online serves as one of the most common activities for Internet users to retrieve information. According to the report mentioned above, Baidu is the most popular search engine among Chinese cyber users with a priority selection incidence of 89.1%. The Baidu Index (BDI), stemming from the search frequency on the Baidu search engine, could be employed as a data source for awareness of cyber users. Based on the search volume by netizens on the Baidu search engine, BDI was calculated and exhibited on the basis of special keywords [19]. As a reference value, BDI could comprehensively reflect users focusing on the keywords in the past day and the media attention to these keywords. The China Internet Network Information Centre reported that 97.4% of Chinese netizens chose Baidu as the comprehensive website in the last six months [20]. With the growth of Internet users in China, websites and social media have become vital channels for the public to express their opinions and release their emotions towards major events, including public health emergencies. Therefore, effective and efficient online monitoring is essential not only for the surveillance of public health events at the early stage but also for indispensable interventions to ease the negative public opinions online and to prevent rumors.

Appropriate reactions to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa might enhance individuals\u2019 awareness of protection and hygienic knowledge, whereas overreaction could do a disservice by arousing public panics or spreading rumors among the population. Previous studies used network tools like Tweets or Google to analyze the public concern during an influenza outbreak and perform disease surveillance [21,22,23,24,25,26,27]. In China, BDI, as an effective early indicator, has also been proved to predict the potential cases of epidemic erythromelalgia, and monitor influenza epidemics [28,29]. However, the utilization of Chinese cyber indices, like BDI and SMI, for the purposes of health education was limited. ",

We gathered the daily BDI with \u201c\u57c3\u535a\u62c9 (Ebola)\u201d as the keyword in cities/provinces to examine the public response. Additionally, Given Internet users in different locations, the average BDI was calculated to identify the mean attention of the netizens (1/100 million) in each province and some cities. Also, we used the same strategy to investigate the blogs posted and forwarded daily for the topic of \u201cEbola\u201d by the Sina Micro Index (SMI). The headline news reports concerning \u201cEbola\u201d were also collected. These media events were retrieved from two sources: the headlines by the Baidu Index and Baidu News [32]. The former does not carry news headlines of the same topic every day, especially of topics with minor fluctuations of BDI. The latter not only provides the related media events but also sorts focused news by the topic word. Finally, the collected media events were abstracted and categorized as positive or negative news. Media events were classified as negative if it generated negative sentiments or attitudes towards the topic of Ebola, or as positive if it aroused optimistic sentiments or supportive attitudes towards \u201cEbola\u201d. These were determined by two individuals, and were eventually decided by the third person if a discrepancy existed.",

Spearman\u2019s rank correlation was employed to check the relationship of epidemic trends with BDI and SMI. The autocorrelation analysis included general autocorrelation analysis and local autocorrelation analysis. The general autocorrelation used the global Moran\u2019s Index. According to the value of Moran\u2019s Index, the result would be determined as a clustered distribution, dispersed distribution, or random distribution, respectively [33]. When the p value of the global Moran\u2019s Index was less than 0.05, the local autocorrelation analysis would be carried out by local Getis\u2019s Gi* to identify the potential hotspots. Additionally, Kulldorff\u2019s space-time scan statistics was carried out to recognize the special cities/provinces with high attention to \u201cEbola\u201d [34]. The parameters of the maximum spatial cluster size and maximum temporal cluster size used the default settings (50%). The log likelihood ratio (LLR) was calculated through comparing the real average BDI with the expected average BDI, and a Monte Carlo test (p < 0.05) was utilized to determine the most likely clustered regions. Spatial-temporal analysis was done using ArcGIS software (version 10.1, ESRI Inc., Redlands, CA, USA) and SaTScan software (version 9.1.1, Boston, MA, USA).

A case in point was the report concerning one woman who returned to Hong Kong from Africa with the symptoms of Ebola disease around 30 July in 2014, an event followed by the first peak of the BDI and SMI. Another event was the announcement made around 8 August by WHO, that the Ebola outbreak was identified as an international public health emergency along with the second peak of the BDI/SMI. On the other hand, positive news reports also influenced public attention. When the WHO spokesman deemed that Chinese people did not need to panic for the epidemic of Ebola in West Africa, the BDI/SMI dropped in the next few days from their first peak. Later on, ruling out one suspected case in Hong Kong led to the decline after the second peak.

Compared with common network tools, including content analysis, indices such as BDI and SMI to investigate public attention possessed unique merits. Firstly, these indicators could identify nearly all retrieved information to the specific keywords on the Big Data platform, while content analysis might only be implemented in limited samples. Additionally, BDI and SMI could mirror the public attention in a timely manner, whereas conventional methods might cause bias, and even be seriously affected by information deletion in websites. In our study, both indices consistently suggested the tremendous public concern to the Ebola event in China. Then, included in the study were the centralized tendency of BDI and average public attention to the Ebola outbreak as indicated by average BDI in different cities/provinces of China. The highest BDI was observed in Guangdong, the province with the largest number of Internet users in China. This might be partly attributed to the opportunities brought about by China\u2019s booming economy, inducing large numbers of West Africans coming to southeast coastal cities including Guangdong, which might lead to overreaction by local netizens. Additionally, the highest average attention to the Ebola outbreak was found in Beijing, the political center of China, along with comparable average BDI in Shanghai, the economic center of the country. The direct flights from these cities to West Africa might contribute to the increase of the average BDI. Interestingly, comparable public attention to Ebola was captured in Tibet, an underdeveloped region, which might be explained by the unique geographical location. Tibet has an underdeveloped transportation system, lower population density, and limited communication, all factors probably contributing to the more frequent web access to acquire information. Therefore, more attention should be paid in Tibet concerning public health education and rumor management. The spatio-temporal analysis had identified 13 clustered regions with higher average attention in China from 30 July to 14 August. During the same period, the daily BDI also indicated higher attention than other periods in China. Thus, we thought that the 15 days after the peak of the BDI was a critical period for infectious diseases with imported risk and that necessary health education intervention should be adopted in these clustered regions.

Contrary to our expectation, no existing statistical correlation was established between case-related influencing indicators and BDI/SMI, which was discrepant with our previous findings [18] and other studies [7,37]. This might be attributable to the fact that Ebola epidemics did not occur in China. The public, justifiably, pays more attention to the disease-related data when the outbreak takes place in their location. Otherwise, the public focuses more on the news reports and the notices from the authorities. The assumption was partly testified by the observation that the peaks of BDI and SMI were usually accompanied with some negative news reports and the decline of the indices followed the positive reports. Additionally, the appearance of a suspected Ebola case in Hong Kong might serve as the vital reason for the first peak of BDI and SMI. Moreover, the particular geographic location and administrative position of Hong Kong should be considered as influencing factors of the public\u2019s attention. ",

            "text": "Previous public health experience, such as SARS, indicated that no individual country could single-handedly prevent and protect itself from public health threats. Thanks to the worldwide spread of diseases coupled with the easy access to network information, communicable diseases such as Ebola, did not only affect the locations of the outbreak but also could cause panic or even major public health events in non-endemic areas. In the public health field, increased Internet searching implied the tremendous need of Ebola-related preventive knowledge to the public. That is to say, high attention areas could be more susceptible to rumors or false online information if public health authorities did not address the emerging public concerns in a timely manner. To handle the demand warranted by this emerging situation, traditional epidemiological methods and public health education modes were obviously inadequate. Online surveillance, with the aid of opinion indices, may have sensitively detected the emergence of serious infectious diseases at their initial stage via the Big Data platform in previous studies, which could buy time for controlling outbreaks of these diseases and reducing the risk of transmission to humans [28,38,39]. That is to say, this modality, different from classic epidemiology questionnaires and telephone interviews developed to know the public reaction after the disease outbreak, enables surveillance beforehand and saves health resources. More importantly, online surveillance can reflect public reactions to emergency public health events and disease outbreaks in a timely manner so that public health interventions can be implemented during epidemic crises to avoid deterioration. Additionally, compared to the classical health education mode aimed at high-risk populations in high morbidity regions, our results implied a need for a shift in health education methods to a public-attention-based mode, especially in non-epidemic areas, to identify the regions of high attention. This new mode should be based on the findings of opinion monitoring through public reaction indices like BDI and SMI. Different interventions, in the future, should be adopted for areas with different indices, more attention being targeted at high-index areas in terms of public propaganda and education.",
