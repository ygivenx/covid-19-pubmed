IBV is a highly infectious pathogen of domestic fowl that replicates primarily in epithelial cells of the respiratory tract [7], [8] causing IB characterised by nasal discharge, snicking, tracheal ciliostasis and rales in chickens [1]. Although IBV is primarily associated with respiratory tract infections, it is also responsible for major economic losses to poultry industries worldwide as a result of poor weight gain and decreased egg production [9]. In addition, some isolates have been found to be associated with renal disease and can be highly nephropathogenic [10]\u2013[12].",

IBV, like all coronaviruses, contains the four structural proteins; spike glycoprotein (S), small membrane protein (E), integral membrane protein (M) and nucleocapsid protein (N), which interacts with the genomic RNA. The coronavirus S glycoprotein is a type I glycoprotein that oligomerises in the endoplasmic reticulum [16] to form trimers [17], which constitute the coronavirus virion spikes observable by electron microscopy. The S protein is assembled into virion membranes, through non-covalent interactions with the M protein [18], and is responsible for binding to the target cell receptor and fusion of the viral and cellular membranes, fulfilling a major role in the infection of susceptible cells [19].",

            "text": "We have previously shown, using our IBV reverse genetics system [27]\u2013[29], that replacement of the ectodomain of the IBV Beaudette S glycoprotein with the corresponding region from the pathogenic IBV M41-CK did not confer virulence to Beau-R but did result in a rIBV, BeauR-M41(S), which had the tissue tropism associated with M41-CK [30]. Chickens that were vaccinated with BeauR-M41(S) were found to be protected against clinical disease following challenge with IBV M41-CK, whereas chickens vaccinated with Beau-R were not protected against challenge with M41-CK [1]. These results indicated that BeauR-M41(S) was able to induce a protective response against homologous challenge with M41-CK, whereas Beau-R was unable to induce a protective response even though both viruses belong to the same, Massachusetts, serogroup. Beau-R is a molecular clone of the Beaudette isolate, an IBV that was attenuated after several hundred passages in embryonated hen's eggs [31], which not only resulted in loss of virulence, but has also been implicated in loss of immunogenicity. Our work has shown that infectious virus was not recovered from tracheal cells following infection of chickens with Beau-R and BeauR-M41(S) or for the H120 [32] vaccine strain of IBV [1]. The genome of BeauR-M41(S) is isogenic with Beau-R and the fact that it is able to protect against homologous challenge indicates that Beaudette or Beaudette-based viruses are able to replicate in chickens raising the possibility that the inability of Beaudette to protect against a virus from the same serotype is not due to the fact the virus cannot replicate in the chicken, but due to an immunogenic mis-match of the Beaudette S glycoprotein with other Massachusetts serotype viruses. Replication of IBV and IBV vaccines in the chicken Harderian gland has been implicated in the induction of immunity against IBV [32]\u2013[35] indicating that IBV vaccines are able to replicate in this tissue. It is possible that some other protein derived from Beaudette in combination with the M41 S glycoprotein may overcome the block in protection associated with Beau-R. In this paper we describe the use of our IBV reverse genetics system to further investigate the role of the IBV S glycoprotein in protection. A rIBV was generated in which the ectodomain region of Beaudette S glycoprotein gene was replaced with the corresponding sequence from IBV 4/91(UK); a pathogenic strain of IBV that belongs to a different serogroup as Beaudette and M41, that has been an important problem to the poultry industry since the 1990s [6].",

The 4/91-derived S gene sequence was amplified by RT-PCR using RNA extracted from the allantoic fluid of embryonated eggs infected with IBV 4/91(UK) and 4/91-derived primers containing PacI (5\u2032) and BspHI (3\u2032) restriction sites. The chimaeric S gene was generated using the PacI and BspHI sites present at the same respective positions in both virus-derived sequences (Fig. 1). The PacI site at nucleotide 20337 is 30 nucleotides proximal of the S gene initiation codon and 21 nucleotides distal of the S gene transcriptional regulatory sequence, the BspHI site at nucleotide 23714 is at the end of the transmembrane domain. In brief, the 4/91-derived 3389-nucleotide PacI-BspHI cDNA fragment was used to replace the corresponding M41 S sequence in pGPT-M41S [28] generating pGPT-4/91S. The pGPT-M41S vector was digested with PacI and BspHI to remove the M41 sequence and used for insertion of the PacI-BspHI 4/91-derived cDNA (Fig. 1).

This was achieved by homologous recombination using the transient dominant selection system (TDS) [28]. In brief, Vero cells (\u223c50% confluent) were infected with VV-BeauR-\u0394S at a MOI of 0.2 and transfected 2 h later with 5 \u00b5g of pGPT-4/91(S) in the presence of lipofectin (Invitrogen). Resultant phenotypically guanine xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase positive (GPT+) rVVs were then selected by three rounds of plaque purification using Vero cells in the presence of 25 \u00b5g/ml mycophenolic acid (MPA), 250 \u00b5g/ml xanthine and 15 \u00b5g/ml hypoxanthine. Next, randomly selected MPA-resistant GPT+ rVVs were grown and plaque purified three times in Vero cells in the absence of selection medium. This process resulted in a second recombination event causing the loss of the GPT gene from the rVVs; leading to either generation of rVVs containing IBV cDNA corresponding to the original sequence (BeauR-\u0394S) or to a full-length BeauR-4/91(S) cDNA. PCR amplification of the DNA from these rVVs was used to (a) confirm the absence of the GPT gene, using GPT-specific primers; and (b) to determine the presence of the chimaeric S gene sequence, using 4/91-specific S gene primers. Recombinant VVs, that were GPT negative and generated PCR products of the expected size from a 4/91 S gene sequence, were further screened by sequence analysis of different regions of the S1 and S2 subunits of the chimaeric S gene to confirm that the required S gene had been introduced into the IBV genomic cDNA. A rVV, rVV-BeauR-4/91(S), which contained a full-length IBV cDNA consisting of the genomic background of Beau-R but with the ectodomain sequence of the 4/91(UK) S gene sequence, was chosen and used for further work.",

After several rescue attempts RT-PCR results showed that there was no rIBV present in P1, presumably because IBV 4/91(UK), used as donor of the S gene, is refractory for growth in CK cells. Therefore, 10-day-old embryos were inoculated with cell lysate from the transfected P0 CK cells. Allantoic fluid was collected 48 h post infection from the eggs (EP1) and total RNA was extracted and analysed by RT-PCR. RT-PCR results were positive for specific 4/91 S products indicative of infectious rIBV. Sequence analysis, using oligonucleotides covering a region from the C-terminus of the replicase gene to the C-terminus of the 3c coding region of gene 3, confirmed that the S gene was from IBV 4/91(UK). The allantoic fluid was then used for further five passages in 10-day-old embryos generating a stock of the rIBV BeauR-4/91(S) that was used for the subsequent experiments.",

The first part of the experiment was to determine whether there were any clinical signs associated with an IBV infection, such as those we knew were associated with IBV 4/91(UK). The second part was to challenge BeauR-4/91(S) vaccinated birds with 4/91(UK) to determine whether the rIBV could induce homologous protection. This part of the experiment required infection of birds with pathogenic 4/91(UK) as a control and was also the control for identifying clinical signs associated with 4/91(UK) for the pathogenicity part of the experiment. In addition, we also challenged chickens that had been vaccinated with BeauR-4/91(S) with a heterologous, different serotype, pathogenic IBV M41-CK. M41 and Beaudette belong to the same serogroup, Massachusetts, and as can be seen from Fig. 2, the S1 part of the M41 S protein sequence differs in a similar way as Beaudette to the 4/91 sequence. Previous studies [42] concluded that the Massachusetts-based vaccines tested did not offer protection against viruses belonging to the 4/91 serogroup.",

In contrast, birds inoculated with BeauR-4/91(S) and subsequently challenged with M41-CK were not protected to the same extent. The use of clinical scores and degree of ciliostasis observed, as criteria of pathogenicity, showed there was a strong degree of protection induced by primary inoculation with BeauR-4/91(S) against challenge with homologous pathogenic 4/91(UK) but much less protection when the BeauR-4/91(S) vaccinated chickens were challenged with pathogenic M41-CK belonging to the heterologous serotype.

With the exception of one bird, no IBV-derived RNA was detected in the tracheas of birds belonging to the BeauR-4/91(S):4/91 group (Table 1). These results are consistent with the clinical signs observations and with the ciliary activity levels displayed by TOCs infected with the corresponding trachea-derived suspensions prepared from infected chickens and indicate that Beau-R-4/91(S) induced protection against subsequent challenge with pathogenic IBV 4/91(UK). Interestingly, IBV RNA was also only detected in one of the birds belonging to the BeauR-4/91(S):M41 group (Table 1) indicative of some cross protection.

BeauR-M41(S) was found to acquire the cellular tropism of M41-CK, but remained apathogenic, according to clinical signs, in infected birds [1]. Importantly, birds inoculated with BeauR-M41(S) showed increased levels of protection, when compared to Beau-R, against challenge with M41-CK virus, suggesting that the ectodomain region of the S protein is important in inducing protective immunity in chickens against IBV infection, and therefore represents a region that should be explored in more detail for effective IBV vaccine development. To extend this work, we replaced the ectodomain region of the Beaudette S gene with the sequence of another pathogenic IBV strain, 4/91(UK), which belongs to a different serotype, the 793/B serotype. The first known virus of this IBV serotype was isolated in France in 1985 [44]. In the UK, IBV 4/91 (also known as 793/B and CR88) serotype viruses were first isolated and characterised in 1991 [6], [42], [45] and were subsequently found to be a common pathogen in flocks of chickens in many parts of Western Europe and elsewhere by the late 1990s [46]. Despite the availability of an attenuated vaccine against 4/91 serotype viruses, recent studies suggest that viruses belonging to the 4/91 serogroup are still prevalent in European flocks [47]\u2013[50] and that their continued presence is still an important concern for the poultry industries in many different countries [6].",

These results support those from our previous work in which the ectodomain of the S gene in Beaudette was replaced with that from an IBV strain of the same serotype, M41-CK.

Consistent with these findings, pathogenicity studies done with a chimaeric IBV in which the replicase gene was from the apathogenic IBV Beaudette, but the rest of the genome was from the pathogenic M41-CK strain, showed that this chimaeric virus was still not pathogenic, indicating that determinants of pathogenicity reside within the replicase gene [43].",

            "text": "Work by others has shown that IBV H120, a major Massachusetts serotype vaccine, induced poor protection against challenge with a 4/91 virus [42]. The amino acid sequences of the S proteins of Beau-R and 4/91(UK) differ by 25% and 11% for the S1 and S2 subunits, respectively. Since it is the S1 subunit that induces virus neutralising antibodies and protective immune responses [51]\u2013[54], this suggests that the ability to induce protective responses against 4/91 may reside in some of the 25% amino acid differences between this strain and Beau-R. Similar to our results for BeauR-M41(S), our protection studies in this work showed that BeauR-4/91(S), which contains the 4/91(UK) S protein ectodomain (comprising S1 and most of S2), conferred protection against challenge with 4/91(UK). The criteria used to measure pathogenicity were observation of clinical signs (snicking, wheezing), ciliary activity in the trachea, presence of virus-derived RNA (by qRT-PCR) in tracheas and virus isolation from tracheal samples. According to clinical signs observations, prior inoculation of chickens with BeauR-4/91(S) resulted in protection against challenge with 4/91(UK). Analysis of the tracheas from the BeauR-4/91(S):4/91 challenge group of chickens showed a significant retention of ciliary activity levels when compared to the very low levels of ciliary activity observed in tracheal samples from the mock:4/91 group. This observation was supported by qRT-PCR analysis on RNA extracted from trachea samples. Only one chicken was positive for the detection of viral RNA in the trachea samples from chickens in the BeauR-4/91(S):4/91 challenge group. Furthermore, there was clearly a reduction in the levels of ciliostasis displayed by TOCs infected with potential virus present in tracheal suspensions prepared from the BeauR-4/91(S):4/91 group when compared to the mock:4/91 group. Interestingly, comparison of the data indicated there was more ciliostasis observed from tracheal samples from the BeauR-4/91(S):M41 group than the BeauR-4/91(S):4/91 group, however, the overall level of ciliostasis observed from either group is outside the level expected for presence of virus. The degree of cross protection among different IBV serotypes is generally low and decreases as the amino acid differences between the S protein increases [55], [56]. By replacing the S gene of the apathogenic Beau-R, from the Massachusetts serotype, with that from 4/91(UK), from the 793/B serotype, we have produced an apathogenic virus that induces protection against challenge with a pathogenic virus from a different serotype, 4/91(UK). Demonstrating and confirming that serotype is associated exclusively with the S glycoprotein irrespective of the genotype of the IBV strain.",

In our previous work, Hodgson et al.\n[1], we similarly showed that no virus was recovered from the tracheas of chickens inoculated with Beau-R and challenged with M41-CK, even though the level of ciliostasis was high (>80%). Most IBV serotypes differ by 20% to 25% from each other in the S1 sequence at amino acid level [57]\u2013[62], some differing only by 2% [63]. The S1 subunit of M41-CK and 4/91(UK) differ by 25.5% at the amino acid level. Although cross protection amongst different serotypes is generally poor, some cross protection between different serotypes has been observed previously. An IBV 4/91 vaccine was shown to protect against challenge (as judged by retention of ciliary activity) with heterologous serotypes Arkansas, D207 and the Brazilian isolates 50/96, 57/96, 62/96 and 64/96. However, no protection was observed against challenge with M41, as judged by loss of ciliary activity, clinical signs and virus isolation wee not assessed [64]. In addition, the IBV vaccine H120 conferred some protection against challenge viruses, from the Belgium B1648, French 84084 and French 84221 serotypes of IBV [64]. Some heterologous protection against M41 was observed in birds vaccinated with the heterologous serotype UK/6/82, despite the 20% difference in S1 [55]. Vaccination with TM-86w, classified as a JP-II genotype on the basis of the sequence of the N-terminus of the spike protein, conferred protection against challenge with 4/91, despite being classified as being a different genotype, as indicated by respiratory symptoms, ciliostasis and virus re-isolation from tracheal swabs [65].",

Interestingly, although vaccination with BeauR-4/91(S) did induce a degree of cross protection against challenge with M41-CK, as judged by reduced clinical signs, no virus isolation and no detection of viral RNA, there was extensive loss of ciliary activity. We also observed this phenomenon in our previous work when birds vaccinated with Beau-R had been challenged with M41-CK [1]. Work by Marquardt et al. [66] showed that virus was isolated from tracheas exhibiting ciliostasis following a heterologous challenge. However, up to three passages in TOCs was required to reveal the presence of virus, indicating that the amount of virus present in the tracheas had been very low. We can only speculate why heterologous vaccination sometimes results in protection, as judged by reduced clinical signs and absence of detectable virus in the trachea whilst at the same time appearing not to have induced protection against heterologous challenge, when based on loss of ciliary activity (ciliostasis). Retention of tracheal ciliary activity has long been used to assess cross protection [55], [64]. Our finding and those of Marquardt et al. [66] do not argue against the use of this criterion as a correlate of protection. The importance of an intact respiratory epithelium would be manifest more in the field than under laboratory conditions. Partial cross protection, based on clinical signs and virus recovery, observed in experiments performed under laboratory conditions in experimental animal facilities would be expected to be sometimes insufficient to protect against economic losses in the field. The damage to the respiratory epithelium, as reflected by observation of ciliostasis, would enable pathogenic strains of bacteria e.g. E.coli, when present, to cause additional pathology.",

The 2042-nucleotide cDNA, corresponding to the 5\u2032 half of the 4/91 S gene was digested with PacI and AlwNI and ligated to the AlwNI-BspHI fragment generated from the 2300-nucleotide cDNA corresponding to the 3\u2032 half of the 4/91 S gene. The 4/91-derived 3389-nucleotide PacI-BspHI cDNA was then used to replace the corresponding M41-CK S gene sequence in pGPT-M41S generating a new chimaeric S gene sequence with the ectodomain derived from 4/91(UK) and the cytoplasmic domain from Beau-R in pGPT-4/91S. Plasmid pGPT-4/91S was used to insert the 4/91 chimaeric S gene into the Beau-R genome by homologous recombination utilising the Beau-R replicase and gene 3 sequences, 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 to the S gene sequence, respectively, using rVV VV-BeauR-\u0394S by TDS.",
