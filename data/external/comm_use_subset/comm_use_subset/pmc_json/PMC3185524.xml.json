Intriguingly, many viruses have their own parasites, including defective interfering (DI) RNAs, as well as satellite viruses and satellite RNAs. For viruses with RNA genomes, the DI molecules consist of RNA sequences derived from the parent RNA virus, whereas the origin of satellite RNAs are not known in most cases. Both classes of subviral RNA are parasitic, since they have to use proteins coded by viruses, called helper viruses, for their replication inside the host cells. This review will focus on the DI-RNAs and their intimate relationship with their parent viruses and host cells.",

            "text": "DI-RNAs are created spontaneously during the replication of the viral genome and they multiply rapidly and eventually lead to slowing down of the parent virus\u2019 multiplication [reviewed by 1,2]. These RNAs are called \u201cdefective\u201d because they have lost the capacity to code for all the necessary viral proteins for independent replication and thus are defective in the absence of the parent (also called helper) virus. Accordingly, the helper virus is required to provide the missing replication protein(s) in trans. DI-RNAs are referred as \u201cinterfering\u201d because they can attenuate the symptoms caused by the helper virus [reviewed by 2,3]. However, some defective RNAs do not interfere with multiplication of their helper viruses; in those cases they are simply called D-RNAs. In some cases, DI-RNAs can enhance the symptoms caused by their parent viruses. Importantly, DI-RNAs are distinct from other parasitic RNAs, called satellite (sat)RNA and satellite viruses, which are associated with helper viruses. The primary difference being that satRNAs do not show intensive sequence similarities with their helper viruses and the sources of their nucleic acid sequences remain uncertain [reviewed by 2]. The hierarchical game of parasitism does not stop here. To make the matter more complex, DI-RNA has been discovered even for a satellite virus [4]. This satellite derived DI-RNA strongly interfered with the parental satellite pancium mosaic virus (SPMV), which is one of the two sub-viral particles associated with Panicum mosaic virus (PMV). Thus, there is a unique complexity and dynamism in viral co-infections that include satellite RNAs, satellite viruses and DI-RNAs.",

The list includes two tombusviruses (TBSV and Cucumber necrosis virus, CNV), Brome mosaic virus (BMV), Turnip crinkle virus (TCV), Cucumber mosaic virus, Bovine viral diarrhea virus, and Hepatitis C virus [19\u201324]. The in vitro data from the above works suggested that breaks, strong hairpin structures, or AU-rich streches in the template (donor) RNA promotes the viral replicase to switch template to the acceptor RNA and then use the nascent RNA as a \u201cprimer\u201d for resumption of RNA synthesis on the acceptor RNA. Interestingly, cis-acting sequences as well as sequence complementarity between the nascent RNA and the acceptor RNA may guide the template-switching events [18]. Primer extension experiments with RNAs representing the nascent strand revealed that rather short (2-to-5 nt) sequence complementarity between the primer and the acceptor template was sometimes sufficient to promote re-initiation of the replicase [20,21,25\u201327]. Additional works revealed recombination \u201ccold-\u201d and \u201chot-spots\u201d, i.e. regions of decreased and increased recombination, respectively, in the BMV and TBSV genomes [20,21,28].",

The model postulates that the viral replicase switches template when it encounters the 5\u2032 end of the template, which serves as a strong stop signal for the replicase. The 5\u2032 end could be the natural end of the DI-RNA, so that recombination leads to the generation of head-to-tail DI-RNA dimers. New 5\u2032 ends could also be generated via cleavages by host endo- and exoribonucleases, leading to partial degradation of the DI-RNA as demonstrated for the TBSV DI-RNAs [30\u201333]. These new 5\u2032 ends of the partially degraded DI-RNAs can then become recombination hotspots [32,34]. These different types of recombination events could generate many different DI-RNA recombinants or promote the de novo formation of novel DI-RNAs. Due to the presence of large number of ribonucleases in host cells, this mechanism might be rather common for RNA viruses and DI-RNAs [35].",

            "text": "Evidence to support the roles of replication proteins in DI-RNA formation has been obtained with the helicase-like protein 1a of BMV. Mutations within the 1a protein altered the sites of RNA recombination when compared with BMV infections containing the wt 1a [38]. In addition, mutational studies on BMV 2a polymerase also indicated the replicase\u2019s role in recombination [39]. A 2a mutation affected the precision as well as the location of RNA recombination sites. Similarly, mutation in the polymerase gene of influenza virus, led to an increase in the synthesis of DI-RNAs [40]. The authors proposed that the mutation destabilized the polymerase-viral RNA complex during the elongation step. A role for the replicase in RNA recombination was further bolstered by studies on the p33 auxiliary replication protein for CNV [41]. Frequency of recombination for tombusvirus DI-RNA was affected by mutations in the RNA binding (RPR) domain of p33 (Figure 2). Two p33 mutants tested enhanced the recombination and 5 of the 17 mutants tested slowed down the accumulation of recombinants. Interestingly, the recombination promoting mutants also increased the level of subgenomic RNA transcription [42]. The connection between transcription and recombination is not that surprising as both processes utilize the viral replicase complex. Mutations within the N-terminal portion of p92pol polymerase, which overlaps with p33, did not have similar affects on recombination, suggesting different roles for RPR in p33 and p92pol proteins with respect to RNA recombination. How these mutations affect recombination, or how they enhance template-switching remains to be tested.",

The effect on recombination was even more profound when p92pol was expressed at a high level in yeast. In addition, the ratio of p33 and p92pol also affected recombinant DI-RNA formation.

Significant progress has been made by establishing yeast as a model host for TBSV replication/recombination [55]. Serviene and co-workers screened the yeast single gene knock out library for the effect of individual gene deletions on the accumulation of recombinant DI-RNAs [33] and identified 11 host genes that promoted/modified viral recombinant accumulation, while 5 host genes were found to act as TBSV recombination suppressors. Additional work on one of the identified host factors, namely XRN1 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 exoribonuclease involved in the RNA degradation pathway, led to the discovery of partial TBSV RNA degradation products in xrn1\u0394 yeast and xrn4-silenced N. benthamiana plants [30\u201333]. The partial TBSV RNA degradation products served as recombination substrates, promoting the formation of novel DI-RNA molecules. In vitro data using purified Xrn1p, as well as in vivo work of overexpression of this exoribonuclease demonstrated that Xrn1p works as a suppressor of TBSV RNA recombination [32]. Moreover, expression of the Arabidopsis thaliana AtXrn4p, which is an orthologue of the yeast Xrn1p in Nicotiana benthamiana, led to degradation of viral RNAs (Cheng et al. 2007). In agreement with the yeast data, silencing of XRN4 in N. benthamiana led to higher accumulation of the DI-RNA recombinants (Jaag and Nagy 2009).",

Interestingly, the sizes of the DI-RNAs as well as the rate of their accumulation varied with the growth temperature. It is not yet known whether these changes are because of some change in selection pressures on DI-RNA accumulation (i) due to variable activities of the host defense mechanisms, such as gene silencing; (ii) due to altered RdRp activities, such as template-switching, under various conditions; or (iii) due to changes in the structure of the viral RNA.

            "text": "DI-RNAs are mainly formed via RNA recombination/genome rearrangements. It is likely that, even though they are more robust, only a fraction of DI-RNAs formed will be replication competent and able to compete in plants. The replication competent DI-RNAs have to compete with the helper virus for the viral RdRp and with other DI-RNAs, resulting in continuous DI-RNA evolution under high selection pressure. DI-RNAs with mosaic genomes, such as the TBSV-associated DI-RNAs (Figure 1) are formed in a step-wise deletion fashion, followed by additional changes to tailor their sizes and RNA structures until they become maximally competitive under that particular environment/selection pressure [6]. The authors suggested that the primary driving force in DI-RNA evolution is the replication efficiency of the DI genome. One of the classical examples is the evolution of DI-73 RNA into DI-72 RNA by the deletion of sequences between RIII and RIV (Figure 1). The deleted region, designated as R3.5, contains a Y-shaped structure that acts as a translation enhancer in the TBSV genomic RNA (Figure 1). It is likely that this region interacts with translational factors and promotes translation of viral protein. This, in turn, would lead to competition between translation and replication, which are mutually exclusive processes. Accordingly, DI-73 RNA would need to be rescued from translation or stripped from bound translation factors prior to entering replication. This step would make DI-73 less efficient in DI-RNA recruitment into replication. In contrast, DI-72 and other DI-RNAs lacking R3.5 sequences do not face this competing process and can directly enter replication. This difference likely explains why DI-73 evolves to DI-72 over time [6].",

For example, DI-RNAs can undergo other types recombination events, such as segment duplication or nucleotide insertions that could enhance their competitiveness [62,63]. By using DI-73, a prototypical TBSV DI- RNA, the authors in this study showed that after serial passaging for 10 times in protoplasts, DI-73 evolved to a shorter DI-RNA with structures similar to DI-72 RNA. However, in one of the cases, DI-73 evolved to a longer DI-RNA, designated as DI-R1, containing duplication of a 130 nt sequence derived from RII in the 6th passage. But by 9th passage DI-R1 was no longer detectable and was replaced by a shorter DI-RNA, similar to DI-72 in size (termed DI-B103). Competition assays using co-inoculation of these DI-RNAs in the presence of the helper virus in cucumber protoplasts revealed that DI-R1 was more competitive than DI-73 or DI-72 RNAs. It is likely that duplication of the critical RII sequence involved in RNA recruitment for replication [54] provided an extra cis-element for binding to the viral p33/p92pol replicase proteins. This in turn, could result in enhanced viral RNA recruitment in case of DI-R1. A single U insertion in RII was found to make DI-B103, containing only one RII, more competitive than DI-R1 containing two wt RIIs. This insertion may have made the single RII in DI-B103 more efficient at binding p33, however this idea remains to be tested.",

Accordingly, we observed rapid evolution with a minimal DI-RNA carrying only a minimal set of essential cis-acting elements required for the assembly of replicase complex. This minimal DI-RNA goes through rapid evolution in yeast and in plants by sequence duplication and even triplication. (Pathak KB, Panaviene, Z. and Nagy, PD, unpublished data). The presence of multiple cis-acting elements may help the new DI-RNAs to increase binding to more replicase proteins cooperatively or facilitating fast recruitment for replication. It is interesting to note that too strong competition with the helper virus for the replicase complex could be counterproductive for the DI-RNA, since then this leads to reduced number of helper virus genomes per cell, followed by reduction in the synthesis of viral replication proteins. This in turn, limits further replication of the DI-RNAs. Therefore, it is likely that the best adapted DI-RNAs are capable of compromise, allowing the helper virus to replicate as well. Many RNA viruses also utilize \u201ccis-preferential\u201d replication [42,64\u201366] where the viral RNA that produces one of the replication proteins has an advantage for replication, likely due to more efficient binding to the replication protein.

            "text": "RNA interference (RNAi) or posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) is a eukaryotic cellular response to the presence of double-stranded (ds) RNAs. These dsRNAs can be either endogenous or parasitic in nature [reviewed by 71,72]. The mechanism can be used to either regulate gene expression or to mediate resistance/host response against pathogens. Plants use this mechanism as a major antiviral strategy [reviewed by 72,73]. The host RNAi machinery use 21\u201325 nt virus derived small interfering (si) RNAs to guide PTGS against viral genomic RNAs. However, viruses fight back by avoiding or delaying recognition by host surveillance due to the formation of replicase complexes hidden in host membranes and by expressing suppressors of gene silencing. For example, p19 of tombusviruses has been shown to be a potent suppressor of gene silencing [74]. Therefore, DI-RNA associated interference with the parent virus replication could be due to hindrance with the activity of p19 [75]. The authors saw a decrease in accumulation of p19 upon co-infection with tombusviruses and DI-RNAs. Moreover, the presence of DI-RNAs enhanced the generation of virus-specific siRNAs, leading to accumulation of free siRNAs unbound by p19. These free siRNAs could thus trigger robust PTGS against the helper virus. Evidence supporting this mechanism is the observation that PTGS is impaired at low temperatures and the DI-RNA-mediated attenuation of the helper virus was also hindered at low temperature.",

It was shown by Szittya and colleagues [76] that the replication of CymRSV, a tombusvirus, in N. benthamiana plants triggered PTGS, resulting in the accumulation of siRNAs corresponding to the CymRSV sequence. They further showed that the PTGS machinery did not efficiently degrade the shorter DI-RNAs. Moreover, this defect was not associated with the RNase complex (RISC) because the system could efficiently silence the larger DI-RNAs and a different helper virus. The length of target molecule was not a deciding factor in this target activity, rather specific sequences and structures of the DI-RNAs played a major role in PTGS. Thus, DI-RNAs could trigger potent gene silencing response against the helper virus without hurting themselves from the same response. In a further attempt to characterize DI-RNA associated symptom attenuation, sequence elements of tombusvirus-associated DI-RNAs were identified [77,78].",

            "text": "DI-RNAs are versatile tools at virologists\u2019 disposal. DI-RNAs often multiply at higher rates, are smaller than the full genome of the virus and contain the cis-acting replication elements for replication and other steps in viral multiplication cycle. Since many DI-RNAs do not code for proteins, mutational studies on DI-RNAs make the results easier to interpret due to separation of trans-acting protein factors and cis-acting RNA elements. Thus, critical cis-acting replication elements important for different steps in viral replication can be deductively discovered. These RNAs also are adapted to use trans (viral and possibly other) factors for their replication enabling a more experimental control over those factors so that a virologist can regulate them spatially and/or temporally. Indeed, using DI-RNAs combined with other modern tools, many cis-acting RNA elements for tombusviruses were deciphered [reviewed by 17,84]. DI-RNAs also proved to be useful in discovering host factors modulating viral replication. To this end, a yeast system using TBSV DI-72 as an experimental replicon (rep)RNA was developed [55,85]. In the above yeast system, the repRNA works as an independent replicon, capable of assembling the viral replicase complex and performing most of the steps in replication in the absence of a helper virus. Based on the yeast/TBSV repRNA system, genome-wide and proteomics-based screens have been performed [33,56,86\u201390]. This in turn, accelerated the identification of more than hundred host factors affecting TBSV replication and \u223c40 host factors affecting RNA recombination. In addition, the system is also useful in dissection of the mechanisms by which these host factors affect viral replication and RNA recombination. To better explain the roles of cis-acting replication elements, viral and host factors discovered with the assistance of DI-RNA, we divide the replication cycle of the plus stranded RNA viruses further into different steps in chronological order [reviewed by 91,92].",

The selection of the viral RNA requires specific interaction with viral- or host proteins. For TBSV DI-RNAs, the selective RNA recognition is mediated by the cytosol-exposed C-terminal portion of p33 replication protein in yeast [54,93]. Detailed mutational studies on DI-RNA revealed the essential role for a C\u2022C mismatch within the RII(+)-SL sequence (Figure 1) in binding to p33 [54]. When the C\u2022C mismatch was mutated to G=C, then binding of DI-72 to p33 was lost and this DI-RNA was unable to replicate in the yeast system or the full-length TBSV genomic RNA carrying the comparable mutation in N. benthamiana plants [54,93]. Thus, the C\u2022C mismatch sequence can be regarded as the \u201cidentity card\u201d of the virus, allowing the viral replicase complex to achieve high selectivity to replicate only viral RNA. As expected, the C\u2022C mismatch region is also required for replication of DI-72 repRNA in a yeast extract capable of supporting one full cycle of replication in vitro [24,94].",

To identify the host proteins that bind viral RNA, TBSV DI-72 (+)RNA was used as a probe to screen RNA binding proteins in a yeast proteome-wide chip carrying 4,100 purified yeast proteins [86]. Five of the identified host proteins in the above screen were further confirmed with other approaches, e.g. gel-shift and pull-down assays. One of the factors discovered was translation elongation factor eEF1A. This protein also co-purified with the tombusvirus replicase. Further studies showed that eEF1A binds to the silencer sequence present in the 3\u2032UTR (Figure 3) [86], which is required for the assembly of the tombusvirus replicase complex [95,96]. A mutation affecting guanine exchange factor (GEF) requirement of eEF1A inhibited DI-72 repRNA accumulation in yeast. It has been proposed that eEF1A interaction with DI-72 RNA might be needed for RNA recruitment into replicase complex or viral RNA synthesis (Z. Li and P. D. Nagy, unpublished).",

This factor was discovered during screening of the yeast knock out (YKO) library for TBSV replication [90]. Virus replication was boosted three folds in the absence of NSR1. Further analysis revealed that Nsr1p binds to RIII in DI-72 (+)RNA (Jiang, Li and Nagy 2009; in press). Indeed the Nsr1p mediated inhibitory effect on DI-72 repRNA accumulation in vivo was lost when DI-72 repRNA missing RIII, the target for Nsr1 binding, was used as a replicon RNA in above study. This protein may inhibit TBSV replication via specific binding to the viral RNA and, thus, resulting in inefficient repRNA recruitment for replication.",

Interestingly, the viral RNA plays an essential role in the replicase assembly both in vivo and in vitro [94,96,102,103]. Detailed work with TBSV RNA revealed that RII(+) (Figure 1) is also crucial for the assembly of tombusvirus replicase complex in yeast [96]. In this study, authors have defined the minimal cis-acting elements required for the assembly of the tombusvirus replicase complex. The affinity purified viral replicase complex was active on external templates only when the full-length DI-72 repRNA was co-expressed with the p33 and p92pol replication proteins in yeast. The minimal repRNA still capable of supporting the assembly of the replicase complex consisted of RII(+)-SL hairpin, the replication silencer element and genomic promoter (Figure 1) [96]. The exact role of the viral RNA in the assembly process is currently under heavy investigation. The viral RNA might provide an assembly platform to bring together the viral and host proteins. The RNA may also play a role in making structural change(s) in the viral RdRp required for activation of the polymerase function of the RdRp. Recently long-range RNA interacting elements UL and DL in the TBSV genomic RNA have been discovered that play a role in replicase assembly [104]. Long distance base pairing between UL and DL sequences juxtapose RII(+)-SL and the replication silencer and gPR within the 3\u2032-UTR (Figure 1). These latter two elements had already been shown to be important in replicase assembly [94,96]. It is interesting to note that UL-DL interaction is not crucial for replicase assembly in DI-73, probably because RII(+)-SL and the 3\u2032-UTR are already in close proximity (Figure 1B), unlike in the genomic RNA, where they are 3000 nt apart (Figure 1A).",

The replication process of (+)-stranded RNA viruses and associated DI-RNAs is asymmetrical, leading to 20\u2013100-fold more copies of (+)RNAs than (\u2212)-strand RNA. One of the major factors in regulation of DI-RNA replication is the DI-RNA carrying cis-acting elements in both strands [reviewed by 17]. The cis-acting elements include the genomic promoter (gPR) in the 3\u2032 end of (+)DI-RNA [106], a complementary promoter element (cPR) in the 3\u2032 end of (\u2212)RNA [46] and replication enhancer elements in RI(\u2212) and RIII(\u2212) [107]. An intriguing replication modulator element is the replication silencer (Figure 3), which is involved in the assembly of the replicase complex and possibly in the regulation of the (\u2013)-strand synthesis [95]. This element interacts with gPR, making the promoter recognition by the RdRp weaker in vitro.

One such host factor is a metabolic enzyme called glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), which was discovered as a component of the tombusvirus replicase complex via a proteomics analysis of a purified viral replicase preparation [88]. When TBSV DI-72 RNA was replicated in yeast cells, the cellular distribution for GAPDH changed dramatically due to re-localization from the cytosol to the site of replication (peroxisome) [108]. Down-regulation of GAPDH levels in yeast correlated with reduced level of (+)-strand DI repRNA. GAPDH was shown to bind to (\u2013)-strand of DI-72 repRNA via an AU pentamer sequence. It was proposed that the role of GAPDH is to retain the (\u2013)-strand repRNA intermediate in the replicase complex, thus facilitating asymmetrical replication. The data from the yeast host were also validated in N. benthamiana host [108].",

However, viral protein modification has been proposed to modulate this process [109]. This is based on the observation that p33 gets phosphorylated in vivo and in vitro as well [109,110]. The phosphorylated form of p33 lost its ability to bind to (+)DI-72 RNA associated with TBSV and in vitro phosphorylation of the p33:DI-72 RNA complex led to the release of the RNA from the complex [109]. In contrast, p33 mutants mimicking the unphosphorylated stage of the protein bound efficiently to DI-72 RNA, suggesting that phosphorylation/unphosphorylation of p33 might regulate the release of (+)RNA from the replicase complex (Figure 5).",

            "text": "Existence of DI-RNAs associated with the infectious parent viruses is one of the perplexing examples of molecular diversity and parasitism. DI-RNAs have a complex relationship with the helper virus and they affect most aspects of virus biology. The relationship between the DI-RNA and the helper virus includes competition for viral- and host factors, induction/suppression of host antiviral responses, and modulation of disease symptoms caused by the helper virus. It will be interesting to explore how DI-RNAs are maintained in the natural viral infections. What advantages do the helper viruses or the host have in co-existing with the DI-RNAs? It is plausible that they might help limit the extent of damage caused by viral infections to their hosts, so that viruses do not kill their hosts as rapidly, thus prolonging the time a host can participate in spreading viruses. As importantly, DI-RNAs are used as surrogate templates in viral replication studies that have contributed to our understanding on the biology of viral infections. DI-RNAs of TBSV have also facilitated the identification of host factors affecting TBSV replication as well as RNA recombination. Many of the cis-acting elements for replication were also discovered using DI-RNAs. Several of the above findings with DI-RNAs were subsequently validated with infectious TBSV in the natural plant host. These advances indicate that DI-RNAs are highly evolved molecules that possess authentic cis-acting replication elements and utilize helper viral- and host factors for their multiplication. Future experiments will likely dissect the detailed mechanisms of DI-RNA formation and evolution during viral infection. The roles of host and environmental factors will also be studied to throw light on how viruses and sub-viral particles co-evolve in the context of their environment.",
