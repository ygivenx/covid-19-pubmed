From four samples in the group of double infection 2, all contaminating CVEV was eradicated during passages in MDCK\u2010S and MDCK\u2010A, whereas one CVEV was isolated during LLC\u2010MK2D passages. These results indicate that LLC\u2010MK2D might be inferior to MDCK\u2010S and MDCK\u2010A considering its low ability to multiply influenza viruses and to eliminate the contaminating viruses.",
