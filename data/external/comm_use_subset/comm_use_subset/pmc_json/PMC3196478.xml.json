            "text": "Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) is a member of the family Filoviridae within the order Mononegavirales\n[1]. It was discovered in 1976 in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo [2] as the etiological agent of a severe human viral hemorrhagic fever known as Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever (EHF). Infection with ZEBOV typically results in a rapidly fatal illness associated with high-level viremia, lack of an effective immune response, drastic lymphopenia, a severe coagulation disorder including disseminated intravascular coagulation and limited hemorrhages, widespread focal tissue necroses, systemic shock and multiorgan failure (reviewed in detail in [3]). While the pathogenesis of ZEBOV infection has been relatively well described in experimental animals [4], [5], only a few studies were reported that shed light on the molecular events following infection in humans. Unfortunately, these studies are partially contradictory. For instance, higher serum cytokine concentrations (IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1) were measured in seven fatally infected patients compared to two survivors in one study, suggesting that a hyperactive immune responses may contribute to fatal outcome [6]. Other studies, describing the responses of eight fatally infected patients and four survivors, did not reveal significant concentration differences of IFN-\u03b1, IL-2, and TNF-\u03b1. On the other hand, that study suggested that fatal infections are due to generalized immunosuppression, including decreased IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, and IL-4 concentrations, lymphocyte apoptosis, and diminished IgG synthesis [7], [8], [9], [10]. The largest study to date included 42 fatally infected patients and 14 survivors. Hypersecretion of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and growth factors (IL-1\u03b2, IL-1RA, IL-6, IL-8, IL-15, IL-16, CXCL1 (GRO\u03b1), CXCL10 (IP-10), eotaxin, M-CSF, MIP-1\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2, MCP-1, MIF) and decreased concentrations of T lymphocyte-derived cytokines (IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-13) concomitant to apoptotic loss of CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes were typical for fatal cases [11]. Unfortunately, all these data reveal only the extent of homeostatic disarray in ZEBOV-infected individuals, but not its origin or genesis. It is therefore important to measure the responses of individual human cell types to infection, ideally in chronological order of their infection in vivo. Mononuclear phagocytes are very early, if not initial, targets of ZEBOV in humans and experimentally infected animals [12], [13], [14], [15]. In vitro, human and nonhuman primate macrophages are highly susceptible to ZEBOV infection with subsequent robust virus production [16], [17], suggesting they may be the major source of the high viremia observed during the critical stages of infection. Studies performed in vitro are also strongly indicative that macrophages play a major role in inducing cytokine/chemokine dysregulation. For instance, human monocytes and macrophages infected with ZEBOV react with increased expression of MCP-1, CXCL1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, MIP-1\u03b1, RANTES and TNF-\u03b1 [16], [18]. Previous studies revealed that similar increased levels of expression of some of these cytokines were triggered by incubation of human macrophages with Ebola virus-like particles (VLPs) consisting of the ZEBOV matrix protein VP40 and the spike glycoprotein (GP1,2) [19] or with UV-inactivated ZEBOV [16]. These findings indicated that virus replication might not be required for the activation of macrophages.",

Here, we determine the initial responses of human macrophages to Ebola virion exposure. In a first set of experiments, DNA microarray analysis was performed to determine gene expression profiles of human macrophages 1 h and 6 h after in vitro exposure to Ebola virions in comparison to mock-exposed cells. In parallel, macrophages were treated with LPS to assess the responsiveness of the cells and to compare the response to different stimuli as genes responding to both virions and LPS might highlight possible response pathways. In a second set of experiments, we distinguished between responses induced by virion binding/entry and responses that require virus gene expression, cellular signals occurring after virion entry by exposing macrophages to Ebola VLPs. We found that Ebola virions exposure, as well as exposure to VLPs can trigger most of the detected changes after 1 h of exposure, and thus independent of virus replication.",

For the second set of experiments, primary human monocytes from three donors (Poietics CD14+, untreated 2W-400 series) (D4, D5, D6) were purchased from Cambrex Bio Science Walkersville (Walkersville, MD). For differentiation of monocytes into macrophages, cells were cultivated in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing 20% heat-inactivated human AB serum (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 \u00b5g/ml), and L-glutamine (2 mM). Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T epithelial cells and grivet (Chlorocebus aethiops) kidney epithelial Vero E6 cells (ATCC, Rockville, MD) were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 \u00b5g/ml), and L-glutamine (2 mM). All cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 environment. The Mayinga strain of Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV), isolated in 1976 [2], was used for all infections, which were performed under biosafety level 4 conditions at the National Microbiology Laboratory of the Public Health Agency of Canada in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Prior to use, virus stocks were propagated in Vero E6 cells and clarified by centrifugation at 3,000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. Supernatants were then layered on TNE buffer (20 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 0.1 M NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA) containing 20% sucrose and spun at 28,000 rpm at 4\u00b0C for 2 h by using an SW28 rotor with a Beckman Optima L-70K ultracentrifuge.

Total RNA isolated from primary human macrophages of three donors (D1, D2, D3) at 1 h and 6 h after in vitro exposure to purified Ebola virions was compared to RNA from mock-exposed cells derived from the same donors. The time points were chosen as virus gene expression does not occur within one hour of cell-virion contact, whereas it will have commenced five hours later while ZEBOV replication is still absent (see below). A total of 12 HG-U95Av2 GeneChip microarrays were analyzed to determine differences in cellular gene expression levels between Ebola virion-exposed and mock-exposed macrophages from donors D1\u2013D3 and also compared to the responses of LPS-treated cells. Genes detected as absent (p\u22640.05) on all 12 arrays were removed from a total of 12,606 probe sets prior to ratio analysis resulting in a reduced number of 8,861 probe sets. The log2 ratio was plotted as a function of the average log2 intensity of Ebola virion-exposed versus mock-exposed samples to test for hybridization quality and for the extent of variation among biological replicates (cells from the three donors). The MA plots for both the 1 h and 6 h time points demonstrate a low variability among donors and good overall reproducibility with the mean log2 being zero over the entire signal intensity range (Figure S1). The low overall variability among donors was corroborated quantitatively by an analysis of variance of the signal strength. A single factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated no significant difference among the 12 arrays (p = 0.83), confirming that the expression of the majority of cellular genes was not affected by exposure to Ebola virions. Genes responsive to Ebola virion exposure were identified by data reduction, i.e. by exclusion of all genes that were identified as \u2018no change\u2019 (NC, p\u22640.05) for all conditions tested. The resulting 2,025 probe sets (genes) were characterized by at least one significant change in one donor at either 1 h or 6 h post infection.

Two types of selection criteria were designed to determine whether expression of a cellular gene was significantly affected by Ebola virion exposure, threshold-based criteria and trend-based criteria. First, thresholds for fold-change, p-values, and signal strength were established. Specifically, a minimum of a 2-fold-difference in cellular gene expression levels in infected macrophages from at least two of the three donors in at least one of the two time points and p-values<0.05 were defined as pertinent (Figure 1). Second, it was acknowledged that in the case of most genes the extent of changes in gene expression required for a biological impact are unknown. For instance, some genes might respond to virus infection with only minor changes in expression levels that may still be biologically relevant. Vice versa, rather dramatic changes may prove to be biologically irrelevant. Consequently, trend selection criteria were established to screen for a common tendency or direction of changes in cellular gene expression levels. Only changes with an associated p-value of \u22640.01 were considered, and no unique cutoff value for fold-change was specified. Accordingly, changes of less than 2-fold were accepted if the direction of change in macrophages from all donors was the same (all increased or all decreased). The two resulting gene sets were analyzed by hierarchical clustering (Stanford Cluster software) and the resulting clusters were visualized using TreeView (Figures 1 & 2).",

Inspection of transcript levels (signal strength) revealed very low signals, which may be a reason of the apparent variability among biological replicates. In contrast, many genes in subcluster 2 show consistent responses among all three donors in at least one time point. However, there are some genes that show similar responses in cluster 1. Since the overall variability in subcluster 1 could be due to low signal strength the dataset of 205 genes was subjected to the additional requirement that of the two compared signal levels the higher one (i.e. mock-signal for upregulated genes, Ebola-signal for downregulated genes) has a minimum signal value of 100 (signal threshold). Fifty-one genes remained when this added threshold criterion was applied. Most of them were located in subcluster 2 and are listed in Table S1 (threshold selection).

It was also demonstrated that many of the genes identified as central nodes in the IPA functional networks (IL-6, IL-10, IRF-7, etc.) also occupied central positions in the signaling pathways identified with InnateDB (heterotrimeric GPCR signaling pathways). Indeed, the upregulation of pathways related to interleukin (IL)-2, IL-12, IL-23 and IL-27 signaling pathways were also identified as being differentially upregulated in Ebola-infected cells as compared to the mock-infected treatment (Table S1). Further, GPCR-related signaling pathways (cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway) and the Jak-Stat signaling pathway were also upregulated during the immediate response to infection. Interestingly, pathways related to fibrinolysis (dissolution of fibrin clot pathway; fibrinolysis pathway) were also upregulated by Ebola infection as compared to the mock-infected control (Table 1). Previously, dysregulation of the fibrinolytic system was recognized in Ebola-infected macaques [13]. A limited number of downregulated pathways were identified in our analysis as being significantly downregulated at 1 h post-infection and were largely related to metabolic processes as well as inhibition of the negative regulation of GPCR signaling (Table 1).",

Multiple pathways belonging to transcription and nucleotide/nucleoside metabolism were identified as being significantly downregulated in Ebola-infected cells as compared to the mock-infected controls 6 h post-infection (Table 2). Comparison of the differentially regulated pathway ORA data sets between the 6 h Ebola-infected vs. mock-infected and LPS-stimulated vs. mock-stimulated treatments demonstrated minimal overlap of upregulated or downregulated pathways (data not shown). Whereas LPS stimulation resulted in the upregulation of pathways largely related to TNF-\u03b1, Toll-like receptor (TLR) or apoptosis signaling pathways these were not identified in the Ebola-infected samples.

Comparison of the fold-changes in gene expression determined by DNA microarrays to a standardized quantitative real-time RT-PCR demonstrated that the underestimation error was larger when the fold-change differences were higher, corresponding to the finding that the quantitative range of real-time RT-PCR is larger than of DNA microarrays [29]. Consequently, real-time RT-PCR was performed for a subset of 16 selected genes that fulfilled at least one of the selection criteria to verify the results obtained by DNA microarray analysis. Some of the selected genes served as controls and are known to be influenced by ZEBOV infection, however, not necessarily at these early time points (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, CXCL1, RANTES, IL-10). Some genes were selected according to their potential relevance in infection due to their known functions and roles in modulation of immune response, viral infections or signaling pathways (hCOX-2, CCL20, 4-1BB, CSF-1, G-CSF, INDO, RSAD2, t-PA, DDX5).Verification was achieved when the direction of gene expression levels was identical and when the expression level changes determined by real-time PCR were equal or stronger than those determined by DNA microarray analysis. Figure 4 illustrates the comparison of the results of microarray analysis and real-time PCR quantifications over both time points. Real-time PCR confirmed the direction of changes in gene expression levels determined by microarray analysis and verified that most changes in cellular gene expression already occurred at the 1 h time point. In particular, upregulation of genes known to play an important role in Ebola hemorrhagic fever (CXCL-1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1 [6], [11]) was verified, although some variation was seen among donors.",

A comparison of the effects of Ebola virion exposure versus LPS treatment revealed that the majority of genes responded similarly (Supplemental Table 1), further substantiating the hypothesis that the observed responses with Ebola virions were triggered by binding and/or entry. To further investigate which changes in expression levels in macrophages occur due to virion binding/entry, macrophage responses following exposure with infectious virions were directly compared to exposure to Ebola virus-like particles (VLPs) lacking viral genetic material and containing only the ZEBOV matrix protein VP40 and the ZEBOV spike glycoprotein GP1,2 (VLPVP40-GP) (see also [19]). GP1,2 is the only known surface-exposed structural component of Ebola virions and contains the cell-surface receptor-binding domain [30], [31]. We therefore hypothesized that if virion binding is responsible for the observed macrophage responses, then these effects would be mediated by GP1,2. To evaluate the role of GP1,2, VLPs consisting of VP40, but lacking GP1,2 (VLPVP40), were tested in parallel with VLPVP40-GP. VLPVP40 particles were shown previously to be morphologically similar to the GP1,2-containing VLPs [32], [33]. LPS was again used as a control for macrophage responsiveness and also to directly compare the LPS-induced responses to those of Ebola virion and VLP exposures. Additionally, cells were exposed to latex particles, which were used in approximate equal quantity to VLPs. Ebola VLP preparations were tested by negative-stain electron microscopy for authentic appearance and presence (VLPVP40-GP) or absence (VLPVP40) of GP1,2 (data not shown). Particles resembled those previously described [32], [33]. In addition, Ebola virion, VLP, and latex preparations were tested for endotoxin-contamination before incubation with macrophages from donors D4, D5, and D6. The endotoxin concentrations of all samples used in this study were not above those of the tissue culture media (<0.5 U/ml). To determine whether the quantitative differences in gene expression levels between cells of donors D1\u2013D3 observed in the first experiment were due to the MOI used, a higher MOI of Ebola virions (\u2248100) was used for this experiment. Cells were exposed to VLPs and latex particles at a concentration of 100 particles per cell. LPS was used at the same concentration as in the first experiment (10 ng/ml), which allowed for a direct comparison of the responsiveness of macrophages used in both experiments. The results revealed that while a higher MOI did increase the overall intensity of responses compared to the first experiments (compare to Figure 4), it did not eliminate or noticeably reduce the degree of variation of gene expression levels between donors (Figure 6C & 6D). This suggests that genetic variation among identical cell types of different donors may have an influence on the effect of ZEBOV infection and therefore may influence chances of survival.",

This first cluster was then used for clustering in a second dimension to group experimental stimuli according to similar effects they had on changes in gene expression (Figure 6A, right cluster). Analysis revealed genes that were upregulated at the 1 h and then downregulated at the 6 h time point (GADD45, DUSP2, IL-10), genes that were first downregulated and then upregulated (IDO, ISG 45K), a large group of genes induced at both time points, and finally genes that were downregulated at both time points (TLR3, GNA13). The second clustering ordered the experimental groups according to similar responses in gene expression (Figure 6B) and revealed the following three major clusters: 1) 1 h exposure to Ebola virions, LPS, and VLPVP40-GP, 2) 6 h exposure to Ebola virions, LPS, and VLPVP40-GP, and 3) 1 h and 6 h exposure to VLPVP40 and latex particles. This result suggests that Ebola virions, LPS, and VLPVP40-GP caused strikingly similar responses in comparison to the responses to VLPVP40 and latex particles. This further supports the notion that binding/entry of virions mediated by GP1,2 plays a significant role in the host response to infection. Thirteen of the 21 genes tested responded to Ebola virions, VLPVP40-GP, and LPS at both time points. TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-8 were also found in a separate study on the effects of VLPs on macrophages [19] and CXCL1 represents a gene known to be affected by ZEBOV infection.

Of the genes that responded to only two of the presented stimuli, more genes reacted similarly to virions and LPS than to virions and VLP. A direct comparison between responses to virion and VLPVP40-GP exposure is depicted in Figures 6C and D for the 1 h and 6 h time points, respectively. Overall, the cluster analysis and the graphs depicting the real-time RT-PCR quantifications indicate that there was, in general, a significant correlation between the effects of virions and effects of VLPVP40-GP with correlation coefficients of R2 of 0.746 and 0.9177 at the 1 h and 6 h time points, respectively. In fact, the difference consists of the expression patterns of G-CSF, 4-1BB, TF, RSAD2 (at 6 h only), and DUSP2, which are the genes identified in the sub-clusters. The real-time RT-PCR also revealed that the changes on gene expression of IL-10, GNA13 and TLR3 are not significantly changed at these early time points even at 100 MOI infection.",

            "text": "The current study represents the first broad analysis of initial transcriptional responses to Ebola virions of human macrophages, the primary target cells of ZEBOV [12], [13], [14], [15]. To assure accurate identification of cellular genes that responded significantly to virion exposure, DNA microarray data were scrutinized and stringently filtered by two different sets of selection criteria and statistical evaluations. In addition, the expression levels of selected genes were experimentally verified by real-time PCR analysis. Using these methods for statistical verification and assay evaluation, our study permitted the identification of a large number of genes not previously implicated in early cellular responses to ZEBOV infection. The detected changes of gene expression levels occurred within the first hours after primary human macrophages were exposed to Ebola virions in vitro. In addition, we identified genes whose expression is known to be upregulated during acute Ebola hemorrhagic fever. This not only validated the experimental approach and data screening criteria, it also demonstrated that elevated levels of gene products, such as cytokines, are already induced in primary target cells within the first hours of virion binding and entry. Lending further credence to these assertions, pathway ORA of the significantly differentially regulated genes identified from our gene expression studies demonstrated a strong upregulation of specific host signaling pathways related to cytokine/chemokine signaling during the immediate response to Ebola infection. Indeed, the upregulation of signaling pathways related to cytokine/chemokine signaling events suggests that specific innate immune responses are mounted during the acute phase of Ebola viral insult. Through multiple pathway ORA analyses we identified broad cellular functional networks that are modulated during the early course of Ebola infection and, importantly, have correlated this with specific cell signaling pathways. The identities of the individual signaling pathways modulated by Ebola infection will provide critical information regarding disease pathogenesis and as well information for the development of novel antiviral therapeutics.",

            "text": "Some of the genes that had already been implicated in the pathogenesis of Ebola hemorrhagic fever such as IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 [6], [11] were induced after 1 h, but returned towards basal levels of expression after 6 h. Indeed, whereas LPS stimulation resulted in the activation of a large subset of TNF-\u03b1 related signaling pathways at the 6 h time point there were no common pathways identified in the Ebola-infected pathway ORA. Similar results were obtained in another study, during which primary human macrophages, exposed to Ebola VLPVP40-GP for 24 h, were characterized by IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, RANTES, and TNF-\u03b1 expression that also peaked at 1 h or 6 h before receding to base levels [19]. These results contradict observations in vivo, which demonstrated upregulation of cytokines for extended periods of time [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]. It is plausible that the early cytokine peak observed following high MOI infections in vitro is only achieved at a later time during in vivo infection. Another possible explanation for this difference is the duration of stimuli and thereby the duration of responses. For instance, in vivo, progeny virions are continuously produced by ZEBOV-infected cells and will therefore bind to and enter additional target cells, resulting in continuous stimuli that may maintain cytokine production and facilitate prolonged activation. Therefore, our in vitro approach most likely yielded results that are indicative of what continuously occurs in vivo. That increased cellular gene expression levels result in increased protein concentrations within 6 h was previously demonstrated in a study that used human macrophages exposed to VLPVP40-GP and ELISA measuring protein levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-\u03b1 [19].",

            "text": "The identified cellular genes whose expression levels were altered after exposure to Ebola virions belonged to different functional categories (Table S1). These genes include inflammatory cytokines, molecules that regulate blood coagulation (such as t-Pa, MMP-1, and serpine 1 and 2) genes involved in stress-response, DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and cell adhesion. In support of these functional categories, our pathway ORA also resulted in similar functional categorization of the differentially regulated signaling pathways following Ebola virus infection. The detection of a group of genes that responded to binding/entry of Ebola virions, VLPVP40-GP, as well as to LPS raises the question whether LPS and Ebola virions share receptors on the macrophage surface. Whereas receptors for Ebola virions on target cells remain elusive, it is known that LPS induces its effects by binding to TLR4 and MD2 and CD14 co-receptors. Recent studies demonstrated that Ebola VLPVP40-GP, but not VLPVP40, induced cytokine and SOCS1 expression in a TLR4/MD2 dependent manner both in a human monocytic cell line (THP-1 cells) and in 293T cells expressing a functional TLR4/MD2 receptor [34]. The innate immune defense is achieved by activating NF-\u03baB and type I IFN responses. It is already known that ZEBOV suppresses the host cell antiviral response by inhibiting interferon signaling via its VP35 and VP24 proteins [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], and RNA silencing via VP35 [42]. Our studies revealed only limited IFN signaling in Ebola virion-exposed macrophages compared to those exposed to LPS, indicating that IFN signaling is inhibited early upon infection.",

First, there are common responses to unrelated pathogens, such as the type 1 IFN innate immune response that renders uninfected neighboring cells resistant to virus infection. Second, there are responses specific for individual pathogens. On the other hand, pathogens have evolved to counter these responses to ensure their own survival and transmission. Examples are how viruses of disparate families overcome the antiviral action of apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G) [43], tripartite motif containing 5 (TRIM5\u03b1) [44], bone marrow stromal cell antigen 2 (BST-2)/tetherin [45], [46], [47], or interferon induced transmembrane proteins (IFITM) [46], [48], [49]. It is important to remember that this study partially characterizes the response of humans to ZEBOV infection and that humans are not natural hosts of this virus. Therefore, host responses and virus counteractions are not in a state of equilibrium. It is therefore a fundamentally interesting question whether infected humans succumb to Ebola hemorrhagic fever because of direct effects exerted by the virus on the body or because of overbearing immune responses by the individual. Recently, various frugivorous bats have been implicated as potential filovirus reservoirs that seemingly remain unaffected by infection [50], [51]. It is therefore tempting to repeat our studies with cells from these animals to see whether their responses to Ebola virion exposure are fundamentally different.",

The fact that many surveyed genes responded similarly to VLPVP40-GP, but not to VLPVP40, treatment clearly supports this notion. However, the fact that some genes, such as those encoding TF or skin collagenase, were triggered only by Ebola virions but not VLPVP40-GP or LPS indicate that these genes must be influenced by factors other than virus binding or entry, such as other components packaged within Ebola virions in addition to GP1,2 and VP40. In this regard, it is important to remember that infectious Ebola virions not only consist of seven structural proteins (NP, VP35, VP40, GP1,2, VP30, VP24, and L) but also contain cellular transmembrane proteins that are usurped by budding virions [52].",

As controls, macrophages of each donor were treated in parallel with latex beads or with 10 ng of LPS. (A) Color-coded first dimension hierarchal cluster analysis based on average linkage clustering of the fold-changes in cellular gene expression in cells of donors D4, D5 and D6 at the 1 h and 6 h time points. Ratios were calculated as log2 values. Positive values indicate upregulation as compared to mock infection/treatments and are represented by red coloration. Negative values indicate down regulation and are represented by green colors. White indicates no change in gene expression (log2 = 0). Each gene has been tested with 5 different stimuli (ZEBOV, VLPVP40-GP, VLPs VLPVP40, LPS, and neutral latex beads), in 3 donors at 2 time points (1 h and 6 h post infection). This provides a total of 30 different evaluations of changes in expression levels per gene. Blocks of three (1 h or 6 h for 3 donors) or six variables (e.g. VLP) can clearly be seen. (B) Color-coded second-dimensional clustering based on genes with similar changes in expression levels. Fold-changes in cellular gene expression following exposure to Ebola virions or treatment with VLPVP40-GP after 1 h (C) and 6 h (D) incubation of human macrophages from donors D4, D5 and D6. Data represent the median values of the fold-changes in log2 of cellular gene expression of donors D4\u20136.",
