The viral genome is composed of a positive stranded RNA, and its structures vary. The family Coronavirinae is divided into four genera: \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03b4 [2]. There are seven human coronaviruses: 229E (\u03b1-CoV), NL63 (\u03b1-CoV), OC43 (\u03b2-CoV), HKU1 (\u03b2-CoV), MERS-CoV (\u03b2-CoV), SARS-CoV (\u03b2-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2 (\u03b2-CoV). MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 can infect humans and induce serious pneumonia with many fatal cases [3]. SARS-CoVs induced an epidemic in the world, and 774 fatal cases were reported [3]. Now, SARS-CoV-2 is still circulating in China [4\u20136].",

Coronavirus can directly cross the species barrier and infect humans with high fatality [8]. As the antigen is novel for a human host, public health is being seriously challenged. The infection risk of coronavirus in animals should be analyzed and a prediction model should be constructed for early warning. For this purpose, machine-learning methods appear to be ideal tools [9, 10]. The spike protein on the surface of the viral particle plays key roles in the binding of the cell receptor and membrane fusion [3, 11], by which the host range is firmly determined [8]. In this study, we screened the features of the spike protein using three encoding algorithms and predicted the cross-species infection of coronaviruses with the random forest method. Moreover, the optimal feature (G-gap dipeptide composition, GGAP, g = 3) was used to explore the dynamic of evolution in a simple, fast and massive manner.",

The RF repeats the computing process many times and then makes a final prediction on each sample. The final prediction can simply be the mean of each prediction with bootstrapping algorithm. In this study, the RF algorithm in the R environment was used [15]. All the experiments in the study were conducted under R 3.5.0 with default parameters (tree number = 500). To reduce the bias of unbalanced sample number, the positive samples were increased fourfold by the direct duplication of their protein sequences. The 10-fold cross validation method was used to evaluate the predictive performance. Platt scaling was used to transform the output of the RF model into a probability over two classes and evaluated the infection risk of coronaviruses.",

We further checked the coronaviruses close to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (< 0.03) and found that these close relatives were the same. The results were similar to those from the MDS method and confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 s and SARS-CoVs have the same origin. Moreover, the big gap at 0.02 suggests that the origin of SARS-CoV-2 s is not clear and further surveillance in the field should be made continuously.
