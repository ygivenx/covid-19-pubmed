Specific testing for A(H1N1)pdm09 virus began on the 28th April at the start of the ALERT phase. The ALERT phase was defined as the period when only a few cases of A(H1N1)pdm09 had been reported in a few countries, but not in Australia, with control measures implemented for quarantine purposes\n[3]. The CONTAIN phase defined the period when the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus had arrived in Australia with few confirmed infections or small clusters of cases, with measures in place for the rapid identification of infections and containment\n[3]. The first Australian cases were imported from the Americas; the first locally-acquired case in New South Wales (NSW) was identified on the 20th May: a 3 year old whose mother had acquired laboratory-confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection during a 10-day holiday to the USA\n[4]. During the CONTAIN phase between 22nd May and 16th June, all laboratory requests were triaged to limit testing to individuals who met the CONTAIN phase clinical case definition: individuals showing symptoms of influenza-like illness (ILI) within 7 days of travel to A(H1N1)pdm09-declared areas, or people with febrile respiratory illness with onset within 7 days of contact with a laboratory-confirmed case\n[5]. Although clinical case definitions may be sensitive for a newly circulating pandemic virus, it may lack specificity, and testing algorithms detecting the novel virus alone will fail to detect other co-circulating respiratory viruses.",

Following the first laboratory-confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 case in NSW, another six influenza A cases were reported on the 24th May from passengers of a cruise ship that had departed Sydney on a 10-day cruise in the Pacific Ocean on the 16th May. The ship stopped at New Caledonia and Vanuatu, islands that had not reported circulation of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus at the time\n[6]. Combined nose and throat swabs collected in viral transport medium were tested for A(H1N1)pdm09 virus by nucleic acid tests (NAT) at the WHO National Influenza Centre in Sydney. Between the 25th May and the 7th June, 1466 patient samples met the CONTAIN-phase definition for laboratory testing, of which 56 (3.8%) were positive for A(H1N1)pdm09 virus by NAT. Of these, 43/56 reported a travel history outside Australia, including the 37 passengers on the cruise ship and six with a history of air travel to other countries. From the 4-7th June, 13 locally acquired cases from known contacts were identified, 11 from contacts within Australia and two from people who had recently returned from the USA. Samples received from the 25th May to 7th June were considered representative of the population suffering from ILI not requiring hospitalisation. As A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was only detected in 3.8% of samples, we performed NAT for other respiratory viruses on randomly selected samples collected from subjects that had met the clinical case definition during the CONTAIN phase.",

Outbreaks of rhinovirus infection, sometimes causing severe disease, have also been reported in long-term care facilities and in elderly adults presenting with respiratory distress to hospital emergency departments\n[14,15]. In another study determining the rate of non-A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection during the 2009 pandemic at two hospital emergency departments in France, rhinovirus infection rates were also higher than A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection rates (62.6% vs. 16.5%)\n[16]. In our study, the rate of rhinovirus infection in travellers and contacts of cases was similar. Other respiratory viruses contributed approximately 20% of infections.

Using a broad clinical case definition (even when limiting it only to travellers) in the early phases of a new pandemic or following emergence of other novel respiratory viruses overseas, as exemplified by the recent emergence of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-coronavirus\n[17] is non-specific. Pathogen-specific NAT using a sensitive, but non-specific case definition targeted to a new pathogen is needed in a containment phase for management of infected patients and related public health issues.
