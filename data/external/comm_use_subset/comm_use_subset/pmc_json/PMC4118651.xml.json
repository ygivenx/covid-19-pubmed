Available data show that a virus is the only microorganism isolated in between 10% and 30% of immunocompetent adults hospitalized for CAP, and accounts for as much as 40% of cases with established etiology. A bacterium as a co-pathogen of a virus can be found in association with CAP (mixed viral-bacterial pneumonia) [1-4] and this accounts for as much as 39% of cases in which an etiological agent is identified [1-3]. In these studies, Streptococcus pneumoniae continues to be the most frequent producer of adult CAP, though frequently in association with a co-pathogen, especially viruses (20%-40%) [2,3,5,6]. It seems logical that, due to the lower sensitivity of techniques usually employed to diagnose bacterial infection, some pneumonias considered to be viral will actually be mixed CAP [3]. This issue, together with the possible isolation of viruses from asymptomatic subjects, suggesting clearance of a past or current subclinical upper airway infection not related to a concomitant CAP, has led to uncertainty as to whether some viruses are the real cause of CAP or whether they must act as a co-pathogen with a bacteria in adults [2,3,6-8]; the generally accepted opinion is that viruses other than influenza rarely cause pneumonia in healthy adults [9].",

Clinical signs and symptoms of bacterial and viral pneumonia are highly variable and overlap, and there is no clinical or radiologic algorithm that can discriminate between the two causes of CAP [12]. Some attempts at differentiation based on biomarkers have been made, and it is now well established that CRP and, especially, PCT show higher levels in bacterial than in viral (or atypical) pneumonia [12-14]. Lack of viral PCT response to viral infection is thought to be related to post-infection release of interferon, which inhibits PCT synthesis [15].",

The CAPNETZ study included a large number of patients (1337) with CAP, of which 58 (4.3%) showed mixed etiologies; however, this group was heterogeneous, as it included two or more typical or atypical bacteria and combinations of typical with atypical and any bacteria with a virus [10].",

Some studies have found these types of CAP to be more severe than bacterial CAP [2,7,23], whereas others, like our study, found no differences in etiology-related severity [5,6]. The importance of suspecting mixed CAP is justified because these cases can be more severe and some of the viruses isolated can be treated.",

In fact, other studies have confirmed these differences also including atypicals [11-13]. The lack of PCT response to viral disease seems to be due to stimulation of macrophages to release interferon, which inhibits tumor necrosis factor (TNF) synthesis that, in turn, is necessary for tissues to synthesize PCT [15]. In our study, PCT levels were similar in mixed and bacterial CAP, and higher than those of viral CAP, and in terms of CRP, we found that mixed CAP showed significantly higher levels than bacterial and viral pneumonias. This biomarker was the only independent factor associated with mixed etiology. The high NPV for CRP, can help us to suspect an aetiology different than mixed bacterial/viral. However, it is true that its low PPV and AUC limit its usefulness in the clinical setting.",

However, others showed limited sensitivity and specificity [17]. We also found a serum CRP higher in mixed infections involving influenza, but differences could not be achieved for PCT, probably due to low number of our cases (n = 15). With the exception of influenza, there is no information in adults on the behavior of biomarkers in mixed pneumonia. In our study, we found that the inflammatory response was higher in mixed CAP compared to single bacterial and viral CAP. We included mixed viral-bacterial CAP not restricted to the influenza virus in a homogeneous adult group of patients, and both PCT and CRP were different in viral CAP without influenza than mixed CAP without influenza.",

Although increased amounts of biomarkers, especially PCT, have been associated with increased pneumonia severity [10], this was not the case in our study, as we found no differences in either PSI or CURB56 scores among three etiological groups. Median CRP was highest in mixed CAP, perhaps reflecting an increased level of systemic inflammation, as has been suggested [7]. It is difficult to explain with accuracy why mixed CAP showed higher CRP levels than both viral and bacterial pneumonias. It has recently been suggested that the main etiological agents of CAP present different inflammatory profiles, according to their respective biomarker (CRP, PCT, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6) response, and that host-microorganism interplay may be useful for etiological diagnosis [11]. Our results suggest that mixed bacterial/viral CAP have a predominant CRP response. Findings of investigations approaching usefulness of PCT and CRP for etiological diagnosis of CAP are contradictory [25]. This can be due, at least in part, to the lack of inclusion of mixed bacterial/viral pneumonias in these studies.",

Interestingly our results were similar when we excluded mixed influenza cases. This is the first study to assess biomarkers in a group of mixed viral-bacterial CAP other than influenza, and compared with bacterial and viral adult CAP. The biomarker profile in this group is different from that of viral CAP. This suggests that the inflammatory response to viruses, even excluding influenza, is different from that in mixed CAP and, therefore, that viruses do not always require a bacterial co-pathogen to produce pneumonia in adults. This may help us better understand the true role of viruses in CAP and, perhaps, encourage the development of effective antiviral drugs [8].

We subsequently excluded 4 patients with atypical bacteria-involved CAP, all of which were Mycoplasma pneumoniae (1 M pneumoniae + E coli, 1 M pneumoniae + influenza A, 1 M pneumoniae + influenza A + influenza B + syncytial respiratory virus [RSV], and 1 M pneumoniae isolated), and a further 7 due to a bacterial yield of improbable CAP cause because of their low pathogenicity (2 from bacterial group [1 Enterococcus faecalis and 1 Staphylococcus hominis) and 5 from mixed (2 S. hominis + Adenovirus, 1 S. hominis + Virus influenza A + RSV, 1 Staphylococcus coagulase-negative + metapneumovirus, and 1 Morganella morgagnii + coronavirus]).
