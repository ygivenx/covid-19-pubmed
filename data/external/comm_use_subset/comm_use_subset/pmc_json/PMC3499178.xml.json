In many cases, it is the only reliable and sensitive method of quantification of mRNA levels of low copy number targets\n[1]. There are several advantages of qRT-PCR over other conventional methods for measuring mRNA levels such as accurate quantification, high sensitivity, large dynamic range, and potential for high throughput analysis\n[1]. However, the following factors need to be properly addressed to avoid erroneous qRT-PCR results: variability of RNA quantification and dispensing, and different efficiencies of reverse transcription (RT) and PCR\n[2]. Consequently, it is important to choose a reliable normalisation method to take into account errors introduced by these factors.",

An ideal reference/ housekeeping gene should be stably expressed across samples from different tissues, developmental stages, and experimental conditions. However, there is no single gene that can satisfy all these criteria. Nevertheless, it is important to ensure that the expression of a reference gene used in a particular experiment is not adversely affected by the treatment. Normalisation of gene expression based on a varying reference gene is likely to produce misleading results\n[4]. Three commonly used reference genes for normalising qRT-PCR data are ACTB, GAPDH, and 18S rRNA[5]. However, several studies have reported that levels of ACTB and GAPDH are highly variable among cell types, during cell differentiation and in cancers\n[6-10].",

            "text": "A technical limitation of using 18S rRNA as a normaliser is that random primers must be used for cDNA synthesis rather than oligo-(dT) since rRNA does not contain a poly-A tail. Use of oligo-(dT) has been suggested as being preferable over random oligomers for cDNA synthesis in order to avoid multiple initiations and to obtain a single initiation event per individual mRNA\n[28]. To overcome this problem a co-application reverse transcription (Co\u2013RT) with 18S rRNA sequence-specific primer combined with oligo-(dT) reaction could be used to increase the sensitivity and improve accuracy of reverse transcription\n[29]. Another criticism of using 18S rRNA for normalising mRNA expression is that the ribosomal fraction may not truly represent the overall cellular mRNA population\n[29]. However, influenza virus infection inhibits cellular macromolecular synthesis (shut-off) and causes global gene expression changes\n[30-35] affecting mRNA levels of many genes. In our laboratory, we performed transcriptome analyses of influenza virus infected human, pig, chicken and duck cells using DNA-microarrays, and found that many genes including ACTB ,GAPDH, SDH1, EEF1G, PPI, TBP and ATP5B to be differentially regulated (data not shown). Despite the perceived disadvantages, owing to its consistency and stability of expression in influenza virus infected cells, 18S rRNA is the most appropriate gene to be used as a reference gene.",

A major drawback of normalising against total RNA is that it doesn\u2019t account for the inherent variation in the reverse transcription or PCR reactions\n[42]. There is also a major problem for normalising against genomic DNA, because the extraction rates of RNA and DNA may vary between different samples, with yields of DNA often being low. The presence of variable haplotypes in certain tumour cells\n[1] and multiple copies of particular loci in replicating bacteria compared to non replicating bacteria\n[43] are some of the additional problems of normalising against genomic DNA. Use of multiple reference genes rather than one has also been suggested as a robust method for providing accurate normalisation\n[44]. However, it may not always be feasible to use multiple reference genes due to limitations of the sample availability, cost and even when using multiple reference genes, accuracy remains dependent on the variability of the chosen reference genes\n[1]. Although these methods are not mutually exclusive, normalising qRT-PCR data using a single internal reference gene continues to be the most widely used method .To conclude, in this study for influenza A infected host cells the most suitable housekeeping gene appears to be 18S rRNA.",

A master mix was prepared for each target gene comprising 10\u03bcl of SYBR Green master mix, 0.8\u03bcl each of forward and reverse primers (900nM) and 3.6 \u03bcl of nuclease free water. Five micro litres of cDNA diluted at 1:25 was used per reaction in a total reaction volume of 20\u03bcl. PCR cycling parameters were as follows; denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 10min followed by 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15s, 60\u00b0C for 30s, 72\u00b0C for 1s followed by cooling at 40\u00b0C for 10s. Product specificity was evaluated by melting curves. Each total RNA sample was amplified in triplicate and the mean values were used for further analysis. Crossing point (Cp) values were calculated in the absolute quantification mode using the second derivative method. Serial dilutions of a pooled cDNA sample for each cell type (combination of virus and mock infected samples) were used to plot a standard curve. Using the slope of the standard curve, PCR efficiencies were calculated using the formula, Efficiency = \u22121+10(\u22121/slope). Raw Cp values were used for BestKeeper analysis while expression values generated by the relative standard curve method were used for NormFinder analysis. PCR efficiencies of all the genes tested ranged between 90-100%.",

SD values provide a measure of the variation and are used to determine the expression stability of candidate reference genes. Further pair-wise correlation- regression analysis was also carried out with all the virus and mock infected Cp values for each cell type (n=12). BestKeeper combines all the reference genes for a sample into BestKeeper index using the geometric mean of Cp values of each of the candidate gene. The software then undertakes pair-wise correlation analyses, to determine the relationship between each gene by assigning each gene combination a Pearson correlation coefficient (r) and a probability (p) value. The software combines highly correlated genes into an index and the software then compares the correlation between each gene pair and the BestKeeper index to calculate the correlation coefficient (r) value. In a panel of housekeeping genes, the ideal housekeeping gene is the one with the highest correlation coefficient (r).",
