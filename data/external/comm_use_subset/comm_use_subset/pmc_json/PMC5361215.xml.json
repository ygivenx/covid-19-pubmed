A quantitative cell-cell fusion assay based on \u03b2-galactosidase (\u03b2-gal) complementation was used as previously described11. Cholesterol conjugation improved peptide inhibition of cell-cell fusion mediated by HPIV3 and NiV glycoproteins, as expected. Incorporation of a PEG4 spacer significantly enhanced peptide efficacy against both viral glycoproteins. Increasing the linker length to PEG12 did not improve upon this result. The peptide with the longest spacer tested \u2013 PEG24 \u2013showed the highest potency in this assay for both NiV and HPiV3 glycoproteins (Fig. 2a) suggesting that the relationship between spacer size and efficacy at inhibiting fusion is not linear.",

All conjugated peptides showed potency against HPIV3 in this assay, with the N-terminally conjugated peptides significantly more effective at blocking fusion. For NiV, in contrast, Chol-VG has too little effect to determine an IC50 against NiV fusion. Only C-terminally conjugated peptides blocked the NiV glycoprotein-mediated fusion with high efficacy in the presence of the PEG linkers. The efficacy of the HPIV3 HRC-derived peptide against HPIV3 itself is higher when spacer and lipid are conjugated N-terminally, but this results in a loss of multipotency against NiV. These results suggest that both orientation of the peptide sequence and the length of the spacer are important for antiviral multipotency.",

            "text": "In previous studies, we used HRC-derived lipid-conjugated peptides to investigate the conformational flexibility of uncleaved F protein (F in its precursor protein form, with the hydrophobic fusion domain still buried)12. The peptides bind to their corresponding HRN domains only when they are exposed by the unfolding of F, and serve as a tool to identify this exposure. For these experiments, peptides are attached to red blood cell (RBC) membranes via their cholesterol tails, and the RBCs are allowed to interact with cells expressing an uncleaved mutant of HPIV3 F (K108G) along with HN to engage the sialic acid receptor on the RBCs and initiate F-activation. The read-out for peptide interaction with the F protein\u2019s HRN is adherence of the RBCs to the F-expressing cells. Since the uncleaved F cannot insert into the RBC membrane, this adherence occurs only via a peptide \u201cbridge\u201d formed when the peptide that is anchored to the RBC via its lipid tail also interacts with the HRN sequence of F expressed on the transfected cells12. The uncleaved F has enough flexibility to unfold and expose the HRN domain upon activation by HN, but cannot fully extend into the transient \u201cpre-hairpin\u201d intermediate with its hydrophobic end inserted into the target membrane12. For exploring peptide function, this assay provides a measure of the efficiency with which peptides bind at an early stage in the fusion process before the F-insertion step. Here we used the \u201cpeptide bridging\u201d assay to assess the interaction of the series of modified VG peptides with the early transitional steps of F protein (Fig. 3). 293T cells co-expressing HPIV3 HN and uncleaved F (cleavage site mutant K108G, csm) were allowed to interact with receptor-bearing RBCs at 4 \u00b0C, then transferred to 37 \u00b0C in the presence of either C-terminally or N-terminally conjugated peptides (1 \u03bcM) with or without PEG4 linkers. Zanamivir, a sialic acid analog that blocks HN-receptor interaction1314 was added after 1 h to disengage cells that were bound by HN-receptor engagement alone. The proportion of RBCs that were either free, reversibly bound by HN-receptor interaction (and therefore released by zanamivir), irreversibly bound by peptide bridging, or fused was quantified.",

In contrast, VG-Chol (C-terminally lipid conjugated) peptide bridged the cell populations by attaching the F protein to the plasma membrane of the RBCs, as suggested by the 35% of irreversibly bound RBCs in the presence of this peptide. PEG spacers in the peptides led to an increase in bridging (as seen by irreversible RBC binding), for both the C-terminally and the N-terminally conjugated peptides, with the C-terminally conjugated peptides being significantly more effective at interacting with the early transitional intermediate of F. Since the spacer-less Chol-VG failed to bridge, this result suggests that the spacer permits the N-terminally conjugated peptide to insert into the RBC membrane. Of the peptides tested, VG-PEG4-Chol showed the most effective bridging, more than 50% irreversible retention, while the peptide that was most effective at inhibiting fusion inhibition, VG-PEG24-Chol (Fig. 2), looks similar to VG-Chol, a far less effective inhibitor. As further explored below, this may relate to the more dynamic membrane insertion of VG-PEG24-Chol, allowing release of the \u201cbridge\u201d mediated by this peptide and release of attached RBCs.",

As shown in Fig. 5a, VG peptides are able to induce changes on the surface pressure of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) monolayers. Only VG and the peptide solvent control with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) showed no changes on the lipid monolayer. VG-PEG24-Chol was the most active peptide by inducing the largest change on the monolayer surface pressure, with \u0394\u03a0max ~ 4 mN/m (Fig. 5b). Increasing concentrations of VG peptides led to an increase on the surface pressure, until a plateau of peptide saturation on the monolayer is reached. These data allow the use of equation (1) to calculate the dissociation constant, Kd. Despite the similar affinity for POPC (Fig. 5d), VG peptides presented very distinct kinetics towards this lipid (Fig. 5c). Using equation (2), a higher insertion rate, k, was observed for VG-PEG24-Chol (7.4 \u00d7 10\u22124 s\u22121), in comparison with VG-PEG4-Chol and VG-Chol (Fig. 5c,d). A similar kinetic behavior was observed for a mixture of POPC with 33% of cholesterol, which represents more ordered domains and the membranes of some cells with high cholesterol content, such as RBCs (data not shown).",

As an indirect reporter, we used the lipophilic fluorescent probe di-8-ANEPPS to measure the interaction of the peptides with the cell membranes. RBCs were labeled with this probe as previously reported151617. The VG peptides were incubated with the RBCs during 1 h. The cholesterol-tagged peptides were able to induce changes on the membrane dipole potential sensed by di-8-ANEPPS (Fig. 6). The VG peptide and the control DMSO did not cause any change on the membrane dipole potential. As a quantitative measure of the interaction of VG peptides with membranes, the ratio R was measured for a range of peptide concentrations. This ratio decreases upon increasing the concentration of cholesterol-tagged peptides, following a hyperbolic curve. These curves were fitted with equation (3), allowing determination of the dissociation constant, Kd. VG-PEG24-Chol showed a higher affinity (Kd = 0.33 \u03bcM) in comparison with VG-Chol (Kd = 0.54 \u03bcM) and VG-PEG4-Chol (Kd = 0.44 \u03bcM) (Fig. 6B).",

As expected, cholesterol conjugation significantly ameliorated the peptide efficacy against both viruses, as measured by reduction in plaque formation. While the presence of the PEG4 linker had no impact on the peptide\u2019s IC90 against HPIV3 (~1 nM) it reduced the IC90 for inhibition of NiV (from 300 nM to 50 nM). An increase in spacer length to PEG24 led to a significant increase of efficacy against both HPIV3 (IC90 ~ 0.1 nM) and NiV (IC90 ~ 2 nM). In addition, we evaluated the toxicity and specificity of the peptides. Table 1 shows that toxicity of VG-PEG24-Chol on cells appears only when we reach a concentration of 1000 nM (10,000 \u00d7 The IC90); toxicity of the other peptides in the series was even lower. Since VG-PEG24-Chol, although quite non-toxic, had the highest toxicity of all the peptides in this series, we chose this peptide for an experiment designed to assess specificity of inhibition. We compared the antiviral effect of VG-PEG24-Chol to PEG24-Chol conjugated peptides that are effective against measles, influenza virus, and feline immunodeficiency virus. None of these peptides were inhibitory for HPIV3, supporting the notion that potency depends on the presence of the HPIV3 peptide sequence, not simply on the linker or lipid moiety (Table 1).",

This could potentially explain why the level of VG-PEG24-Chol in the brain and serum is relatively low compared to our previous data for other peptides619. The finding that the longer PEG increases protease sensitivity is part of the complexity of identifying ideal candidates for in vivo testing; one must identify a balance between absolute antiviral potency and stability. In order to be able to take advantage of the antiviral potency conferred by the longer linker (PEG24) we are now addressing ways to reduce protease sensitivity, for example by modifying the protein backbone.",

            "text": "While until now we have focused the antiviral strategy on the peptides with lipid conjugated to the C-terminus because they were far more potent inhibitors compared to those with lipid conjugation at the N-terminus8, here we showed that by adding a PEG linker between the lipid and the peptide sequence at the N-terminus, the N-terminally conjugated peptides are rendered more potent against the virus from which they are derived. The efficacy of N-terminally lipid conjugated fusion inhibitory peptides has been studied for both Ebola21and Newcastle Disease virus23. In the case of Newcastle Disease virus, Li et al. showed that N-terminal cholesterol conjugation enhanced the potency of inhibitory peptides and allowed them to penetrate the CNS, while the effect of addition of a PEG3 linker between the N-terminal cholesterol and the inhibitory peptide was less clear. In our case, the linker between N-terminal cholesterol and peptide significantly enhances anti-HPIV3 potency, while abrogating broad-spectrum antiviral activity. We speculate that without a flexible linker, the N-terminally conjugated peptides could not attain the proper position for interacting with the target region on F - or could do so only when not anchored in the membrane or later in the fusion process (after fusion peptide insertion and during the refolding step). The mechanistic basis for the negative effect on inhibition of NiV remains to be explored. As shown schematically in Fig. 11, a flexible PEG linker allows for freedom of orientation in order to align properly with the target HRN domain, or for more dynamic kinetic of insertion into the membrane. This may be an advantage not only for interacting with the F protein once it has inserted into the host cell membrane (at which point it is a target for both lipid-conjugated and unconjugated peptide inhibitors)6 but also for interacting with the pre-insertion F. The pre-insertion F protein is shown in Fig. 11 as extended into a transient intermediate in panel a; panels b, c, and d depict the C-terminally conjugated VG-Chol peptides with each linker length interacting with this pre-insertion step in fusion, suggesting that the longer linker may allow for optimal alignment between the peptide and the HRN on F. The peptide with a PEG-24 linker (Fig. 11d,e) has been shown to be the most effective inhibitor but to less potently capture early intermediates of F activation (see Fig. 3). Based on the biophysical data showing the increased dynamic membrane interaction for this peptide, we speculate that this peptide may flip between the target host cell (panel d) and the viral membrane (panel e), reducing observed capture of F while increasing efficacy. These mechanisms could also explain why the N-terminally conjugated peptides may be rendered effective by a long linker which could either optimize alignment with F or permit activity from both cell and viral surfaces. In this study, we focused on peptides with the lipid conjugation at the C-terminus because this approach led to conservation of the broad antiviral spectrum \u2013 a primary goal of this work. However in light of the advantage shown by the N-terminally conjugated peptides in terms of protease sensitivity, we will also explore the effect of longer PEG linkers on potency and protease sensitivity of N-linked peptides and determine the basis for the difference in antiviral spectrum conferred by orientation of the lipid moiety. Future studies will address the issue of protease sensitivity, in addition to varying the location of the lipophilic moiety, by modifying the amino acid backbone so as to render it less protease sensitive.",

The lipid moiety drives the interaction between the peptides and the lipid membrane, and is a determinant for the affinity of the compounds toward the membrane. As the cholesterol moiety is conserved among the active compounds we assessed here, it may explain the similar dissociation constants obtained for the different molecules. However, we observed significant differences in the kinetic behavior of each peptide. VG-PEG24-Chol exhibits the fastest kinetics of membrane insertion, followed by VG-PEG4-Chol. The addition of cholesterol to the lipid monolayers boosts the kinetic rate constant of all peptides; only the most potent peptides interact well with membranes in the absence of cholesterol in the target membrane (data not shown). We speculate that the linear membranotropic (association/dissociation from membrane) properties associated with the effective peptides also affect biodistribution and therefore in vivo efficacy, as they may circulate in association with RBCs. We assessed the serum and RBCs from peptide-dosed animals, and found that peptides are present both in the plasma and on the surface of the RBCs (data not shown). Association with RBCs may be one mechanism whereby the lipid moieties enhance half-life in vivo. Addition of PEG linkers, while significantly enhancing potency, confers protease sensitivity, an issue that may be mitigated by measures including N-terminal conjugation. This understanding of the set of properties that correlate with the peptides\u2019 potency permits enhancement of antiviral effect of HPIV3-derived peptides for both HPIV3 and NiV. In addition to guiding peptide design, these principles will be used to obtain the optimal balance of orientation, lipid moiety, valency, linker length, and amino acid sequence with the goal of broad spectrum activity for paramyxoviruses.",
