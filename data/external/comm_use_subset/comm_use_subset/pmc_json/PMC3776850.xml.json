            "text": "Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is a positive-sense RNA virus of the coronaviridae family. MHV strain A59 is both hepatotropic and neurotropic, and intracranial inoculation of mice causes acute hepatitis and encephalitis and subsequent demyelination. MHV-,A59 replicates in the brain, spinal cord and liver, peaking at about five days post infection after which time infectious virus is cleared primarily by the CD8T cell response, also requiring CD4T cells. Although virus is cleared by 10-14 dpi from all organs, viral RNA persists in the central nervous system (CNS) and is accompanied by inflammatory demyelination, which peaks in the spinal cord at approximately one month post-infection [1-6]. Demyelinating strains of MHV (A59 and JHM) have been widely used as models for the study of the human demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis [1,7-10]. MHV-induced CNS disease involves recurring demyelination and remyelination in spinal cords of infected mice [5,6,11], suggesting that this model has pathological similarities to the remitting-relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis.",

            "text": "The mechanisms underlying MHV-induced demyelination remain unclear. Although MHV induces primary demyelination, axonal damage has also been observed in MHV-infected CNS [12]. Early pathological studies suggested that demyelination results from direct infection of and damage to oligodendrocytes, the myelin producing cells of the CNS [13,14]. More recent reports have implicated immunopathological mechanisms rather than oligodendrocyte damage in MHV-induced demyelination, although the specific pathways involved still remain to be determined. While RAG-/- mice, lacking mature B- and T-cells, do not undergo demyelination, neither CD4 nor CD8T-cells are absolutely required [2,8]. Virus-specific T cells persist in the CNS [15,16], and both macrophages and microglia are associated with demyelinating lesions [14]. Mice lacking B-cells exhibit more severe demyelination than immunocompetent mice, throughout the course of infection [2], but this is likely due at least in part to persistence of infectious virus. Additionally, several cytokines have been studied in the context of MHV-induced demyelination; only IP-10 is reported to affect the clinical course of disease [17-21]. While many demyelinating disorders are also presumed to involve dysregulation of lipid metabolism and transport [22-25], there are to date no reports of alterations of lipid metabolism during MHV infection.",

            "text": "To comprehensively characterize the gene expression changes and pathways affected by MHV-induced demyelination in the murine CNS, we employed high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) using spinal cords from MHV-A59-infected mice at 33 days post-infection, around the time of maximum MHV-induced demyelination as quantified luxol fast blue staining of spinal cord sections [1,2,5,26]. At this time post infection, demyelination is robust and viral genome expression is detectable [1,2,5,16,26]. To our knowledge, this is the first report of using RNA-seq to detail the host response to virus-induced demyelinating disease. We found that the host response to MHV persistence was characterized by a Th1-biased cytokine response, eicosanoid-associated inflammation, ongoing antigen presentation, lymphocyte proliferation and activation, and lipid processing changes. In addition, the expression levels of several genes involved in osteoclast function, or the function of bone-resident macrophages, were augmented in the demyelinating CNS, most likely being expressed by brain resident microglia. Two of these genes, TREM2 and DAP12, were among the most highly induced during MHV-induced demyelinating disease. Interestingly, natural polymorphisms in these genes lead to a demyelinating disorder in humans concurrent with osteopetrosis, or bone cysts [27-30]. The increased expression of genes that directly affect bone resorption and osteoclasts during demyelination leads to the intriguing possibility that osteoclasts and microglia may have parallel roles in maintaining the specialized extracellular matrix of their respective compartments.",

Subsets of these genes were found to be involved in antigen presentation and processing, inflammation, defense, and immune responses, chemotaxis and cytokine signaling, complement, and lipid processing, transport, storage, and metabolism (Figure 2\n and Table S3\n). A small number of these genes were expressed at undetectable levels in spinal cord from mock-infected mice but at significant levels in spinal cord from MHV-infected mice (65 genes, starred in Table S2\n). These genes encode proteins that perform immunological functions, including surface markers expressed exclusively on myeloid or lymphoid cells (24 genes), cytokines (5 genes), lysosomal components (3 genes), granzyme B, apolipoproteins C-II and C-IV, and a complement component (Cfb). Neither complement components nor active B/T-cells nor their products would be expected to be present in the spinal cord in na\u00efve mice; therefore, these data illuminate the utility of this assay for detecting transcriptional changes reflective of infiltrating immune cells. The 50 most highly differentially expressed transcripts, which are representative of the functional categories in Figure 2\n, are listed in Table 2\n\n.\n",

These genes are involved in scavenging (CD68, MSR1), signaling (Ms4a7, Tyrobp, TREM2, Gp49a, and AIM [61-66]), pathogen destruction (Lgals3 [67]), and monocyte differentiation (Tyrobp, TREM2, Mpeg1, and gpnmb [68-73]). Two of the genes for which expression was most highly induced during MHV persistence were TREM2 (Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2) and DAP12 (DNAX-activating protein of 12kDa), both of which are involved in myeloid differentiation and function (Table 2\n). In humans, congenital natural polymorphisms that cause loss of function mutations in either TREM2 or DAP12 result in Nasu-Hakola disease, which is characterized by late-onset demyelination in the CNS and osteopetrosis [27-30]. Interestingly, several other myeloid-specific genes in addition to TREM2 and DAP12 that exhibited increased expression levels in demyelinating spinal cord are also important for osteoclast differentiation and function (Figure 3D\n and Table S8\n). Indeed increased expression of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (Acp5), bone sialoprotein (spp1), osteopontin and oncostatin M receptor was associated with chronic MHV induced CNS disease (Table S4\n).",

In the uninfected mouse, TREM2 is expressed at high levels in the brain and spinal cord, but at minimal levels in the liver, while DAP12 shows higher and more ubiquitous expression in all organs assayed. We also assessed the basal expression levels of TREM2 and DAP12 in CNS cell types cultured in vitro (Figure 4B\n). DAP12 was expressed in all cell types, with much higher expression in myeloid cells, whereas TREM2 was expressed solely in myeloid cells, with astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and neurons showing minimal to no detectable expression of this gene (Figure 4B\n). In the 33-dpi MHV-infected animals, TREM2 expression was upregulated strongly in the spinal cord and to lesser extents in the brain and liver (Figure 4C\n). Infection increased DAP12 expression significantly only in the infected spinal cord and not in the brain or liver (Figure 4C\n).",

A previous study comparing persisting and non-persisting strains of MHV indicates that virus-specific CD8T-cells persist only when viral RNA is present and that viral persistence also correlates with demyelination [76]. Therefore, although infectious virus does not appear to persist in the CNS of MHV-infected mice, the viral products that do persist may be the viral mediators of the demyelinating pathology. Here, we report that even by using an extremely sensitive in vivo bioassay, persistently infected CNS tissue is unable to transfer infectious virus to na\u00efve hosts. We furthermore demonstrated that viral mRNA as well as genomic RNA persists suggesting viral transcription is occurring and perhaps mRNA is translated into protein that is responsible for maintenance of T cells during persistence as well as the demyelinating pathology. The nature of persistent MHV mRNA is not yet known and requires additional studies, now underway, to characterize the viral sequences, including their mutation rate(s), the presence of six subgenomic mRNAs, leader-junction diversity in subgenomic species, and relative abundance of negative-sense RNA species.",

Activated lymphocytes and inflammation-mediated responses may directly or indirectly induce death in oligodendrocytes, thus interfering with maintenance of the myelin sheath. The role of oligodendrocytes, the cells that specialize in myelination, in supporting MHV persistence and demyelinating disease has been disputed. Previous studies have shown that MHV persists selectively in oligodendrocytes [11,13,14,77-82]. An early study reported that MHV antigens were present in the oligodendrocytes of demyelinating lesions four weeks post infection [4]. Some studies show that oligodendrocytes are directly damaged during MHV infection but it has also been shown that oligodendrocytes in the MHV infected brain are not apoptotic, and MHV-induced demyelination correlates with inflammation rather than direct damage to oligodendrocytes [14,83,84]. In contrast to MHV infection, immunization against myelin basic protein (MBP) results in direct damage to oligodendrocytes and EAE [85-87] and leads to reduced expression of many oligodendrocyte or myelin-specific genes in the CNS [88,89]. Here we report no changes in expression of oligodendrocyte specific, or myelination-relevant genes during MHV-induced demyelinating disease supporting the hypothesis that oligodendrocytes are not specifically damaged during MHV persistence. It is important to note here that remyelination also occurs during MHV induced chronic disease and that while not maximal until ten weeks post infection, remyelination-associated genes may be upregulated at 33 dpi. However, our data suggests remyelinating processes at this time post infection do not appear to involve increased expression of oligodendrocyte specific genes.",

We report here that Th1 chemokines (CCL5, CCL3, CXCL10, CXCR3, CXCR4) have augmented expression during MHV-induced demyelinating disease. CCL5 and CCL3 attract T-cells and other leukocytes to sites of inflammation [90-93], while CXCR4 is a T-cell receptor that promotes chemotaxis to sites of inflammation [94]. CXCL10 (IP-10) and its receptor CXCR3 recruit many immune cells to inflammatory sites and have been previously shown to influence MHV-induced demyelination [17]. Additionally, CXCL10 has been extensively studied in two models of multiple sclerosis, MHV, and experimentally induced autoimmune encephalitis (EAE). Additionally, antibody-mediated blockade of this cytokine has ameliorated disease in both models [17,95]. The combination of increased expression of several canonical Th1 cytokines/chemokines and absent expression of the canonical Th2 cytokines/chemokines [96-101] supports the hypothesis that the host is continuing to mount a cell-mediated immune response to the virus, as previously suggested [102].",

Although infectious virus does not persist in the CNS, the CD8T-cell response to viral antigen is known to continue in the CNS through this time period [16,76,104,105], and CD8T-cell exhaustion has been proposed to contribute to MHV persistence [106]. Indeed, the sustained activation of lymphocytes, which is associated with sustained antigen presentation, is established not just for MHV-induced demyelination [1,43,107-112], but also for EAE [87,113,114] and multiple sclerosis [115-117], lending evidence to the theory that demyelination is an immunopathological process possibly triggered by diverse biological activities.",

As lipid is a major component of the myelin sheath, changes in lipid metabolism may influence the composition, degradation, or regeneration of myelin in the CNS. Thus, the set of genes related to lipid transport, differentially expressed during MHV-induced chronic disease may be important not only for the formation of the myelin sheath but also for remyelination during MHV infection or in diseases such as MS. Indeed by 33 dpi in the MHV model, while demyelination is the predominant pathology; the remyelination process has likely begun [6].

Furthermore, a variant of apolipoprotein E, apoE\u03b54, is a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer\u2019s disease [118,119], and focal demyelination has been observed near amyloid-beta plaques in both humans and mice [120].

Macrophages/microglia have been clearly associated with the pathology of MHV induced demyelinating disease [14,126,127]. A group of myeloid-specific genes that have proven importance for osteoclast function or bone maintenance was also upregulated during MHV-induced demyelination (Table S4\n). Two of the most highly regulated genes were DAP12 and TREM2. DAP12 is a signaling adapter that associates with multiple receptors in different cell types [128] and signals through an ITAM motif [62]. TREM2 signals exclusively through DAP12 and is expressed on myeloid cells in response to unknown ligands [129,130]. Polymorphisms in either of these genes found in individuals with, Nasu-Hakola disease cause demyelination and osteopetrosis, presumably resulting from defects in microglia and osteoclasts respectively [27-30]. DAP-12 deficient mice also exhibit a similar phenotype [131]. DAP12 expression is also associated with NKG2D T-cells in the CNS, which have been demonstrated to contribute to MHV-induced demyelination [132]. Other myeloid-specific genes that were upregulated during MHV induced chronic disease are also important for osteoclast differentiation and function, for example Acp5, Spp1, osteopontin, oncostatinM. Mice deficient in Acp5 exhibit osteopetrosis [133,134]. Bone sialoprotein (Spp1) anchors osteoclasts to bone and is a major component of the bone extracellular matrix [135], while osteopontin has been examined as a modulator of demyelination due to its increased expression in EAE tissue and cerebrospinal fluid from multiple sclerosis patients [136,137]. Lastly, the oncostatin M receptor is also highly expressed in MHV-infected and EAE- and MS-affected tissues [88,138]. Interestingly, infusion of oncostatin M into mice with chemically induced demyelination also regulated the expression of several genes involved in the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells into mature myelinating cells [139].",

Here we show that TREM2 expression is most highly expressed in microglia and macrophages, while DAP12 expression was detected in neurons and astrocytes as well. Interestingly, these genes are more highly induced at 33 dpi in the spinal cord as compared to the brain. This is consistent with studies suggesting that MHV persistence ( [141] and Figure 1) as well as demyelination [142] is to a greater is extent in the spinal cord than in the brain.",

            "text": "Taken together, our findings suggest that osteoclasts and microglia may have several parallel functions. It is known that osteoclasts reabsorb bone (which is created by osteoblasts) using superoxides to destroy the bone matrix and specialized forms of phagocytosis [143,144]. Regulation of osteoclast and osteoblast function is critical for bone homeostasis, and a lack of osteoclast activity caused by mutations in any of several genes leads to osteopetrosis or bone cysts [144,145]. Similarly, microglia, along with inflammatory macrophages, may reabsorb damaged myelin and thus allow oligodendrocytes to remyelinate. Osteoclasts have been reported to present antigen, activate T-cells, and secrete cytokines in vitro [146], as microglia have been shown to do in the CNS [147]. Osteoclasts also respond to multiple cytokines that regulate their differentiation and bone-resorptive activity [148], while microglia and inflammatory macrophages are activated by cytokines to scavenge myelin debris [126]. The parallels between osteoclastic and microglial functions in bone remodeling of skeletal tissue and myelin remodeling of the CNS may currently be underappreciated. In support of this model, our findings here indicate a unique role for a subset of bone remodeling proteins in the remyelinating CNS during persistent MHV infection, perhaps by specific expression in activated microglia.",
