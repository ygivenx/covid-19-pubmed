Following infection, pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) sense non-self, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) triggering signaling pathways that activate an immune response (reviewed in 1). Detection of viral signatures by PRRs, such as RIG I-like receptor sensing of double stranded RNA, induces production of Type I and Type III interferon (IFN). Through binding of cell surface IFN receptors and subsequent activation of the JAK-STAT pathway, IFN activates the transcription of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (2), many with known antiviral properties, priming neighbouring cells to restrict viral spread.",

IFITs typically contain multiple IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs) in their promoters (reviewed in 3) and are also induced directly by IFN-regulatory factor 3 (5), downstream of initial PRR activation. Recently, phylogenetic analysis revealed that rodents, including mice, have lost IFIT1 but Ifit1b has undergone duplication twice (Ifit1b2 and Ifit1b3) and Ifit3 once (Ifit3b) (6).",

TPR motifs are frequently involved in protein-protein interactions and are commonly found in scaffolding proteins (12). The crystal structures of IFIT1 and IFIT5 revealed a positively charged pocket formed in the groove between the N and C domains that interacts with single-stranded RNA (8\u201310). IFIT1 RNA binding activity was first reported by Pichlmair et al. (13) who identified proteins in lysates from IFN stimulated cells that interacted with 5\u2032-ppp RNAs. Subsequently, we and others demonstrated that IFIT1 tightly binds capped RNAs lacking methylation on the first cap-proximal nucleotide (cap0) with low nanomolar affinity (14\u201316). While similar positively charged tunnels in IFIT1 and IFIT5 interact with the phosphate backbone of bound RNAs (8,9,14), only IFIT1 possesses a large hydrophobic cavity at the rear of the tunnel that can accommodate the cap structure (9). These findings support a model whereby IFIT1 out-competes eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E/4F for binding to cap0-mRNAs, thereby inhibiting their translation. As host mRNAs are generally methylated on the first or first and second bases (cap1 and cap2, respectively), this selectivity offers a mechanism of recognising and blocking translation of non-self RNAs.",

            "text": "The expression of IFIT1 imposes a strict requirement on viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm and rely on cap-dependent translation to evolve and maintain mechanisms to avoid restriction by this ISG. For example, members of the Flaviviridae and Coronaviridae families that rely on cap-dependent translation to produce viral proteins from their single-stranded positive-sense RNA genomes, encode their own 2\u2032-O-methyltransferases. Disruption of methyltransferase activity increases susceptibility of the flaviviruses West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus and dengue virus (16\u201320) and the coronaviruses murine hepatitis virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (21,22) to IFIT1 restriction. Interestingly, enzymatically 2\u2032-O-methylated, capped mRNAs from parainfluenza virus 5 display differential translational sensitivity to IFIT1 in vitro, while wild type middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS) replication was enhanced upon IFIT1 depletion suggesting that factors other than 5\u2032 end methylation can influence IFIT1 recognition (23,24). By contrast, alphaviruses, such as the emerging human pathogen chikungunya virus, also rely on cap-dependent translation but lack a virally encoded 2\u2032-O-methyltranferase, thus possessing viral mRNAs with a cap0 structure at the 5\u2032 end (25). Recent evidence suggests that stable secondary structure at the 5\u2032 end of alphaviral genomes protects the viral RNAs from IFIT1 restriction (26,27). IFIT1 may also affect translation through interaction with eIF3 (28), while its direct binding to the viral E1 protein restricts human papilloma virus replication (29).",

(30) demonstrated that IFIT2 could interact both with itself and with IFIT1 and IFIT3 in HeLa cells. In the same study, an IFIT1, IFIT2 and IFIT3 containing complex in HeLa cytoplasmic lysates was also reported to migrate between 150\u2013200 kDa when analyzed by glycerol gradient sedimentation. Deletion analysis identified the first four TPRs of IFIT2 as being important for interaction with IFIT3 while the TPR(s) of IFIT2 that promote interaction with IFIT1 could not be elucidated (30). IFIT1 was later reported to interact with IFIT2 or IFIT3 by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) (13). The crystal structure of IFIT2 revealed it forms a stable, domain-swapped dimer, with TPRs of the N-terminal domain exchanged between each monomer (7). Using native gel electrophoresis, we previously demonstrated IFIT1 and IFIT3 could homooligomerize (14), while a recently-reported crystal structure of IFIT1 identified a motif in the C terminus responsible for IFIT1 dimerisation (BioRxiv: https://doi.org/10.1101/152850). However, despite considerable evidence for IFIT oligomerisation, little is known about how different IFITs interact and what impact this interaction has on function.",

We describe an assembly pathway for the IFIT heterocomplex identifying a critical motif for IFIT1 and IFIT3 interaction. We also demonstrate that IFIT1 expression is enhanced by the presence of other IFIT proteins and that interaction with IFIT3 or a heterocomplex of IFIT2 and IFIT3 enhances the cap0 RNA binding and translation inhibition activity of IFIT1. Our results provide a critical missing link between IFIT oligomerization and function presenting a mechanistic framework for understanding the role of IFITs in the host immune response.",

Mutant IFIT3 expression vectors were generated by site directed mutagenesis using pCDNA3.1-IFIT3-FLAG or pET28b-IFIT3-His as templates. For reporter RNA transcription, the firefly luciferase reporter gene (Fluc) was PCR amplified using primers containing the 5\u2032 UTR and 3\u2032 UTR sequences of human \u03b2-globin (NM_000518.4), including a 5\u2032 T7 promotor and EcoRI and PstI sites to facilitate cloning into pUC57. pUC57-ZIKV-Fluc was previously described (31).

IFIT2 and IFIT3, as well as several well-characterized RNA binding proteins, co-precipitated with IFIT1 (13). We used SILAC proteomics to examine if IFIT1 could interact directly with IFIT2 and IFIT3 in nuclease treated lysates from IFN-stimulated cells. HEK293T cells were passaged in differentially isotopically labeled media and transfected with either a plasmid expressing FLAG-tagged IFIT1, FLAG-tagged IFIT5 (previously reported not to interact with other IFITs (13,30)), or an empty vector control. Twenty four hours after transfection the cells were treated with IFN-\u03b1 and incubated for a further 16 h. Preparation of nuclease treated cell lysates and pull-down experiments are described in Materials and Methods. Consistent with previous reports (39), IFIT1 was poorly overexpressed while IFIT5 was strongly expressed (Supplementary Figure S1). However, as shown in Figure 1A, IFIT2 and IFIT3 co-precipitated with FLAG-tagged IFIT1, while FLAG-tagged IFIT5 did not precipitate other IFIT family members (Figure 1B). The full SILAC data set is available on the PRIDE server. These results independently confirm the interaction of IFIT1, 2 and 3 in IFN-stimulated cell lysates and further demonstrate that this interaction is maintained after nuclease treatment. Both IFIT2 and IFIT3 were enriched to a similar extent in the IFIT1 pull downs (Figure 1A).",

To this end, His-tagged IFIT1, IFIT2 and IFIT3 were individually expressed in bacteria and purified as described in Materials and Methods. The His-tag was removed from IFIT2 and IFIT3 but retained on IFIT1 for later detection. Each protein was subjected to size exclusion chromatography with multi angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) to analyze IFIT assembly. SEC-MALS reveals the molecular mass of species eluting at different volumes from a size exclusion column providing information about the oligomeric state of these species. Varying concentrations of IFIT were analyzed by SEC-MALS and, consistent with a recent report (BioRxiv: https://doi.org/10.1101/152850), IFIT1 oligomerized in a concentration-dependent manner (Supplementary Figure S2A). In contrast, IFIT2 eluted as two species corresponding to a stable dimer or tetramer (Supplementary Figure S2B). Surprisingly, the IFIT2 dimer had a similar elution volume to the lowest concentration of IFIT1 examined. This demonstrates the importance of using the SEC-MALS technique which directly determines the mass of particles in solution from their Rayleigh scattering, instead of relying on the elution volumes of molecular weight standards during SEC to infer oligomeric state. When analyzed alone, IFIT3 also eluted as a mostly dimeric species, with a smaller peak corresponding to a monomer (Supplementary Figure S2C).",

IFIT1 and IFIT3 formed a stable complex that eluted with a molecular mass of 221 kDa (Figure 2A, peak a). Analysis of the protein peaks by SDS-PAGE shows that IFIT1 and IFIT3 are equimolar, indicating that this complex represents stable IFIT1:IFIT3 tetramers. A later eluting species likely corresponding to IFIT1:IFIT3 dimers (123 kDa) is also evident (Figure 2A, peak b). To determine the relative stabilities of IFIT1 alone or complexed with IFIT3 we examined IFIT1 and the IFIT1:IFIT3 heterocomplex using differential scanning fluorimetry. Using this approach, protein unfolding is monitored by measuring the signal from a dye that fluoresces in hydrophobic environments at increasing temperature. More stable proteins unfold at higher temperatures than less stable proteins. Unfolding exposes hydrophobic regions of the protein making them more accessible to the dye. As seen in Figure 2B the IFIT1:IFIT3 complex melts at a higher temperature than either IFIT1 or IFIT3 in isolation indicating that the complex is indeed more stable than either protein alone. The IFIT1:IFIT2 complex was less defined than IFIT1:IFIT3 and eluted as multiple species ranging from 148 to >234 kDa as measured by SEC-MALS (Supplementary Figure S2D). Interestingly this interaction was only observed when the proteins were incubated at 30\u00b0C prior to SEC-MALS analysis. When combined at 4\u00b0C prior to SEC analysis only a very weak interaction between IFIT1 and IFIT2 was observed (Supplementary Figure S2E).",

When analyzed by SEC-MALS two peaks corresponding to IFIT2 and IFIT3 homodimers were clearly separated (Figure 2C, grey dotted line). In contrast, when IFIT2 and IFIT3 were instead incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour an IFIT2:IFIT3 heterodimer was formed (Figure 2C, black dashed line). The molecular weight of the eluting species (110 kDa) and analysis by SDS-PAGE (gel inset) are consistent with this complex representing an IFIT2:IFIT3 heterodimer. As evident in Supplementary Figure S2F, when peak fractions were reanalyzed by SEC-MALS there was no observed dissociation of the complex into constituent components, confirming that the IFIT2:IFIT3 complex is stable. To determine the relative stabilities of the different dimeric complexes, we examined IFIT2, IFIT3 and the IFIT2:IFIT3 heterodimer using differential scanning fluorimetry. Figure 2D shows the thermal melt curves for IFIT2 and IFIT3 homodimers and the IFIT2:IFIT3 heterodimer.

An equimolar ratio of IFIT1 was incubated with the purified (preformed) IFIT2:IFIT3 heterodimeric complex. Most of the IFIT1 was incorporated into a larger complex that eluted with a molecular mass of 165 kDa corresponding to a trimer (Figure 2E). Analysis of this complex by SDS-PAGE (gel inset) reveals that it contains equimolar amounts of IFIT1, IFIT2 and IFIT3. Finally, we incubated the IFIT2:IFIT3 heterodimer with a two-fold molar excess of IFIT1 at 30\u00b0C for 1 hour. Analysis by SEC-MALS reveals a clear shift of the heterotrimeric complex to a heterotetrameric complex with a molecular mass of 236 kDa (Supplementary Figure S2G). SDS-PAGE analysis of this complex reveals a molar excess of IFIT1 over IFIT2 and IFIT3 indicating that the heterotetrameric complex consists of two IFIT1 molecules to one molecule each of IFIT2 and 3 (compare gel insets in Figure 2E and Supplementary Figure S2G). The ability to form this complex in vitro from purified components demonstrates that the complex can assemble independently of IFN stimulation. The IFIT1:IFIT2:IFIT3 heterotetramer precipitated with time so the IFIT1:IFIT2:IFIT3 heterotrimer was used for further experiments. We examined the relative stability of each of our new complexes by differential scanning fluorimetry as shown in Figure 2F. The thermal melting curves for IFIT1, IFIT2 and the IFIT1:IFIT2 complex were nearly identical indicating that each of these are more stable than IFIT3 alone (compare Figure 2B and F) whereas IFIT1:IFIT3 and IFIT1:IFIT2:IFIT3 were the most stable complexes examined.",

            "text": "To investigate the impact of hetero-oligomerisation on the ability of IFIT1 to inhibit cap0-dependent translation we used a similar approach to that previously described by Young et al. (23). In vitro transcribed mRNAs comprising a firefly luciferase (Fluc) reporter flanked by either the ZV or human \u03b2-globin 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) were post-transcriptionally capped as described in the Materials and Methods. As described in the Introduction, flaviviruses lacking 2\u2032-O-methylation are inhibited by IFN in an IFIT1-dependent manner. As such the cap0 version of this reporter is a representative mRNA that is inhibited by IFIT1. The \u03b2-globin reporter was examined as it has very weak secondary structure and a previous study has suggested that IFIT1 binding may be affected by both 5\u2032 end methylation state and RNA secondary structure (9). Schematics of the two constructs are shown in Figure 3A. These mRNAs were incubated with different IFIT heterocomplexes before addition of rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL). Advantages of the RRL system for this analysis are that the impact of different IFIT complexes on translation can be monitored independently of other changes occurring due to IFN stimulation and that the effects of defined amounts of each complex can be examined. We also previously used translation factors purified from RRL for the initial demonstration that IFIT translation regulation was affected by the cap structure of the mRNA 5\u2032 end (14). A well-known restriction of the RRL system is that it does not completely recapitulate the cap/polyA synergy of translation initiation (40). However, ZV, like other flaviviruses that utilize cap-dependent translation, do not possess 3\u2032 polyA tails and do not require circularization for translation (41). Translation was quantified by measuring the luminescence from the Fluc reporter. The amount of IFIT1 added was equalized by western blotting against the His-tag on the purified IFIT1 in each complex. The upper panel of Figure 3B shows an SDS-PAGE analysis of the protein complexes used in these experiments while the lower panel shows an anti-His-tag western blot of the same complexes. The linearity of the western blot signal to protein concentration was confirmed as shown in Supplementary Figure S3.",

Pre-incubation of IFIT1 and IFIT2 had no detectable impact on the inhibition of translation of the cap0-\u03b2-globin Fluc reporter and so was not examined further. In contrast, complexing with IFIT3 reproducibly decreased the concentration of IFIT1 required to cause 50% inhibition of the same reporter (Figure 3C). The IC50 values derived from the experiments shown in Figure 3 are displayed in Table 1. IFIT1 inhibited translation of the cap0-ZV reporter less than the \u03b2-globin reporter overall but complexing with IFIT3 again enhanced IFIT1\u2019s translation inhibitory effect (Figure 3D). As can be seen in Figure 3E and F, stimulation of IFIT1 translation inhibition was reproducibly observed in the context of the IFIT1:IFIT2:IFIT3 complex. The average volume of HeLa cells was previously reported as 2.6 \u00d7 103 \u03bcm3 (42), while 2.4 \u00d7 106 copies of IFIT1 were estimated to be present after IFN stimulation of HeLa cells (13). This would mean IFIT1 is present at an effective concentration of \u22651.5 \u03bcM making the concentrations used in our assays physiologically relevant. Reporter mRNAs bearing cap1 were also examined (Figure 3C\u2013F and Supplementary Figure S4) but showed much greater resistance to IFIT1 inhibition. The ability to observe this \u223ctwo-fold decrease in the IC50 values for the inhibition of translation by IFIT1 in the presence of IFIT3 or IFIT2:IFIT3 in this system is significant, as RRL is very efficient in supporting cap-dependent translation as evidenced by the lack of cap/polyA synergy described above. Our results clearly implicate the structure present at the 5\u2032 end of a mRNA, as well as the methylation state, as an important determinant of susceptibility to IFIT1 restriction and that interaction with IFIT3 or IFIT2:IFIT3 can also influence this.",

Using our purified complexes, we next examined if the interaction of IFIT1 with cap0 mRNA was altered when part of a larger IFIT1:IFIT3 or IFIT1:IFIT2:IFIT3 complex. We used a primer extension inhibition assay to monitor the IFIT1/cap0 mRNA interaction as previously described (14). An advantage of this technique over other methods to analyze protein\u2013RNA interactions, such as electrophoretic mobility shift assays, is that the primer extension reaction is performed in equilibrium binding conditions. IFIT1 alone or as part of an IFIT heterocomplex was incubated with the in vitro transcribed and capped model \u03b2-globin and ZV mRNAs prior to the addition of a radiolabeled primer that binds within the Fluc mRNA sequence. A reverse transcription reaction was performed in which a full-length cDNA is produced in the absence of IFIT1, whereas a 7 nucleotide truncated cDNA, corresponding to the length of the IFIT1 RNA-binding surface, is produced in the presence of IFIT1 (14). The cDNA products are subsequently separated by denaturing PAGE and detected by autoradiography. IFIT protein complexes shown in Figure 3B were used in the binding reactions. Representative autoradiographs are shown in Figure 4A. Quantification of the cDNA products was performed as described in the Materials and Methods and the binding curves shown in Figure 4B and C show the fraction of RNA bound at varying IFIT concentrations.",

            "text": "As previously reported (14), IFIT1 binds cap0-\u03b2-globin mRNA with very high affinity. The binding constants for the experiments shown in Figure 4 are presented in Table 1. Complexing with IFIT3 or the IFIT2:IFIT3 heterodimer enhances binding of IFIT1 to this mRNA. IFIT1 heterocomplexing also has the effect of saturating the binding on the mRNA as evident in the autoradiograms. This effect was even more pronounced when the cap0-ZV reporter was analyzed. On this more structured model viral RNA IFIT1 binding only reached 60% saturation. When complexed with IFIT3, IFIT1 bound the ZV reporter with 2-fold higher affinity, similar to the effect observed for the cap0-\u03b2-globin mRNA. In contrast, the calculated K1/2, app for the IFIT1:IFIT2:IFIT3 complex binding to the cap0-ZV reporter was only marginally lower than that for IFIT1 alone. However, again as is clear from the autoradiograms, addition of IFIT3 or the IFIT2:IFIT3 heterodimer led to saturation of RNA binding. It is not yet known how IFIT3 promotes IFIT1-cap0 binding, however, based on our in vitro RNA binding experiments we speculate that IFIT3 decreases the IFIT1 off rate, enhancing its ability to block eIF4F recruitment. This is potentially particularly important when IFIT1 is binding mRNA with highly structured 5\u2032 ends as our translation inhibition results in Figure 3 suggest. As IFIT1:IFIT3 is predominantly a stable tetramer with two copies of each protein and since complexing with IFIT3 has a more noticeable effect on the apparent affinity of IFIT1 for cap0 mRNA, we conclude that IFIT3 and not IFIT2 in the IFIT2:IFIT3 complex is responsible for the observed effects. In all cases, and similar to our previous findings (14), the Hill coefficient was greater than 1, indicating a degree of cooperativity in IFIT1 cap0-mRNA binding.",

Murine Ifit3, which does not precipitate with murine Ifit1b1 (15), has a large deletion at the C terminus (Supplementary Figure S5) when compared to human IFIT3. As a result of this deletion, mouse Ifit3 lacks a YxxxL structural motif present in both human IFIT3 and IFIT1 (Figure 5A and B) recently reported to promote IFIT1 concentration-dependent dimerisation (BioRxiv: https://doi.org/10.1101/152850). Our SEC-MALS and differential scanning fluorimetry analysis demonstrates that the IFIT1:IFIT3 interaction is more stable than the IFIT1:IFIT1 interaction (compare Figure 2A and Supplementary Figure S2A). We therefore hypothesized that the proposed IFIT1 dimerization motif is the site of interaction between IFIT1 and IFIT3.",

However, the L464E substitution had only a modest effect on the interaction of IFIT1 with IFIT3 (Figure 5D). The Y460E substitution destabilizes IFIT1:IFIT3 oligomerization to a greater extent than the L464E substitution (Figure 5E), but the double mutation Y460E/L464E completely abrogates the IFIT1-IFIT3 interaction (Figure 5F).

The amount of FLAG-tagged IFIT1 plasmid used produces a similar level of IFIT1 expression as detected after 24 h treatment with IFN-\u03b1 (Supplementary Figure S7A). The presence of IFIT3 but not IFIT2 dramatically stabilized the expression of IFIT1 (Figure 6A and B). As shown in Figure 6C, the stabilization is dependent on the integrity of the YxxxL motif. Interestingly, mutation of the YxxxL motif in IFIT1 causes a small but reproducible increase in IFIT1 expression in the absence of any other IFITs (compare lanes 1 and 3 in Figure 6C). Since FLAG-tagged IFIT1 and IFIT2 could not be separated by SDS-PAGE we used anti-IFIT1 to detect protein expression.

HEK293T cells were transfected with IFIT1 alone or co-transfected with either wild type or Y438E/L442E mutant IFIT3, which cannot bind to IFIT1 (Supplementary Figure S6). After 24 h, in vitro transcribed and capped mRNAs comprising the Fluc or Nanoluc reporter genes shown in Figure 6D flanked by the ZV 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs were transfected into the IFIT-expressing cells, as described in Materials and Methods. The ZV Fluc mRNA is the same as that used in the in vitro translation inhibition assays in Figure 3. The ZV Nanoluc mRNA is identical to this reporter but expresses a nano luciferase gene rather than a firefly luciferase gene. As addition of cap1 to the ZV genome renders it resistant to IFIT1 inhibition (Supplementary Figure S4), translation from the cap1 ZV Nanoluc reporter serves as an internal control for RNA transfection efficiency. Translation was quantified by measuring luminescence from the Fluc or Nanoluc reporters and expressed as a ratio of Fluc(cap0)/Nanoluc(cap1) in Figure 6D. IFIT1 alone caused a 20% reduction in cap0 RNA translation compared to empty vector transfected cells. Co-expression with wild type IFIT3 resulted in a two-fold enhancement of this inhibition. In contrast, co-expression with the Y438E/L442E mutant IFIT3 that does not bind wild type IFIT1 had no effect on IFIT1-mediated translation inhibition. These in cell experiments confirm an important role for IFIT3 in promoting the full antiviral effects of IFIT1.",

However, our results demonstrate that IFIT3 binds IFIT1 and IFIT2 in very different ways. The IFIT1 and IFIT3 interaction is rapid and occurs at low temperatures. We identified a critical YxxxL motif present in both IFIT1 and IFIT3 that is essential for interaction of the two proteins. This motif is also responsible for the concentration-dependent homodimerization of IFIT1 previously reported (BioRxiv: https://doi.org/10.1101/152850) and confirmed here. The dynamic nature of the IFIT1:IFIT1 interaction likely accounts for the ability of IFIT3 to outcompete and form the thermodynamically more stable IFIT1:IFIT3 complex. In contrast, the formation of an IFIT2:IFIT3 complex from individually purified proteins is slow and requires energy, only being detected when incubated at 37\u00b0C. This is likely due to the domain swap nature of the interaction between IFIT2 homodimers that must be disrupted for IFIT3 to instead associate. Our SEC-MALS analysis of IFIT2:IFIT3 heterodimer assembly supports this model.",

This suggests species differences in the role of this motif, and in IFIT oligomerisation in general, that must be considered when examining phenotypes of small animal models used to examine the impact of IFIT depletion. Importantly, the crystal structure of IFIT5 reveals that, although critical residues of the YxxxL motif are conserved, they are buried in an interface with a terminal helix not present in IFIT1 (8\u201310), explaining why IFIT5 does not interact with IFIT3 ((12) and Figure 1).",

            "text": "Our IFIT2:IFIT3 interaction studies also have important implications for our understanding of IFIT biology. IFIT2 dimerizes through a domain swap of three \u03b1-helices that constitute one and a half TPRs of the N-terminal domain (7) (Supplementary Figure S8A and shown schematically in Figure 7). The ability of IFIT3 to sequester IFIT2 into a heterodimeric form demonstrates that IFIT3 can disrupt the domain swapped architecture of IFIT2. It is therefore possible that IFIT3 could interact with IFIT2 in a similar domain swapped manner (modeled schematically in Figure 7, top right), consistent with TPRs 1\u20134 in the N terminus of IFIT2 being sufficient for the interaction (30). Overexpression of IFIT2 induces apoptosis (30,43), while co-expression with IFIT3 but not IFIT1 blocked this effect (30). Moreover, depletion of IFIT3 induced cell death in the U549 human carcinoma cell line, an effect potentiated by co-infection with dengue virus (44). Our data would suggest that the homodimeric form of IFIT2 may be responsible for this phenotype, and that co-expression of IFIT3 can mitigate this effect by disrupting IFIT2 dimerization. It is currently not clear why the cell would evolve such a mechanism for inducing programmed cell death. One potential hypothesis is that dysregulation of ISG induction, perhaps due to infection, could perturb the balance of IFIT2 and IFIT3, promoting cell death to restrict pathogen spread. Interestingly, a poly(AU) RNA binding activity of IFIT2 was localized to the dimer interface surfaces of the C-terminal domain that form a large positively charged pocket (Supplementary Figure S8B) (7). The electrostatic surface potential of an IFIT3 molecular model, based on the IFIT2 crystal structure, is shown in Supplementary Figure S8C. The IFIT3 model lacks a positively-charged nucleic acid binding surface like that of IFIT2. Together, our assembly analysis reveals novel details about IFIT interactions and indicates a central role for IFIT3 in IFIT complex assembly.",

IFIT3 and to a lesser extent the IFIT2:IFIT3 heterodimer enhanced the translation inhibition effect of IFIT1 on a ZV reporter mRNA (Figure 3). This effect was even more pronounced when a \u03b2-globin reporter mRNA, predicted to have very little secondary structure, was analyzed consistent with an emerging consensus that both the methylation state and structure at the 5\u2032 end of an mRNA can influence its susceptibility to IFIT1 inhibition (9,23,24). IFIT2 alone did not enhance translation inhibition by IFIT1 so it is likely that the effect observed in the presence of the IFIT2:IFIT3 complex is a result of IFIT1\u2019s binding to IFIT3 in the complex. This can explain why the effect of the IFIT1:IFIT2:IFIT3 complex in RRL was weaker that the IFIT1:IFIT3 complex.",

When examined in our reverse transcriptase inhibition assays, apparent IFIT1 binding was much less efficient for the structured cap0-ZV reporter than for the less structured \u03b2-globin mRNA and in fact on the ZV construct failed to reach saturation (Figure 4). This is not due to incomplete capping of the mRNA as saturation is possible when IFIT3 is present. Instead, it is more likely that the reverse transcriptase may remove a proportion of the bound IFIT1 as it proceeds in a 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction resulting in the production of a full-length signal even if IFIT1 was initially bound. We conclude therefore that IFIT3 stabilizes the interaction of IFIT1 with the cap0 mRNA in such a way that it is no longer removed by the reverse transcriptase consistent with its role in enhancing translation inhibition by IFIT1. Interestingly, there was no evidence of a shift in the IFIT-dependent toeprint to indicate that the other IFITs in the complex were interacting with the mRNA downstream of the IFIT1 cap0 binding cleft. IFIT5 changes conformation when transitioning between the apo- and RNA-bound state (8), positioning key residues for optimal RNA binding. The crystal structures of IFIT1 bound to different short RNAs show the protein is in a similar closed conformation as the RNA-bound structure of IFIT5 (9). It is therefore likely that IFIT1 cycles through a similar open/closed conformation to interact with RNA. Binding of IFIT3 may promote the closed conformation of IFIT1, stabilising its interaction with target RNAs.",

In contrast IFIT2 had a much smaller effect on IFIT1 expression in cells consistent with the stability of the different complexes observed in the in vitro differential scanning fluorimetry assays. Overexpression of wild type IFIT3, but not an IFIT1-binding defective mutant, also enhanced the translation inhibitory effect of IFIT1 on a model ZV reporter mRNA confirming that this interaction is functionally relevant.
