Poultry farming not only assists in upgrading the financial condition but also makes a substantial contribution to human nutrition [1]. The total contribution of livestock subsectors to gross domestic products in Bangladesh is approximately 1.54% and in agricultural products 13.62% [2]. It also generates 13% of foreign currency and provides 20% fulltime employment and 45% partial employment of rural population [2]. However, it is the matter of regret that poultry industry in Bangladesh continuously facing challenges in several ways. Increased prevalence of disease outbreaks which reemergence of various pathogens with higher virulence due to constant natural evolution of variant strains as a result of recombination of virus and frequent use of live vaccine are the main reasons for such challenges [3,4].",

            "text": "One of the most economical important diseases of poultry is infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) [5]. It is highly contagious and causing devastating economic losses to chickens [6,7]. The virus causes respiratory disease characterized by tracheal rales, coughing, and sneezing along with excess accumulation of mucus in bronchi and reduced growth rate in broilers, nephritis, urolithiasis, and irreparable damage to oviduct, leading to abnormal eggs production with high mortality rates in affected poultry flocks [8,9]. IBV is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus, belonging to the genus Gamma coronavirus [10]. The spike (S) glycoprotein is cleaved into two smaller proteins, namely S1 (amino-terminal component) and S2 (carboxy-terminal component). The S1 portion has two hypervariable regions which cause virus neutralization and serotype-specific antigenic determinants that are responsible for binding to the host cell, neutralization, and immune response [11] and also important for involving pathogenicity of the virus to the host [12].",

Mortality rates as high as 40%-90% were observed in affected chicks [14,15]. The disease is transmitted through the air-borne, mechanical transmission between birds, houses, and farms. Air-borne transmission mainly occurs through aerosol and mechanical transmission occurs by personal contact, material, and equipment sharing in between farm and flock. Confirmatory diagnosis of IB can be achieved by a number of tests including agar gel precipitation test, hemagglutination inhibition, and enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay. The more traditional methods used to determine the serotype of the virus include virus isolation and neutralization tests which are being fast replaced with rapid, specific, and confirmatory tests such as reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism [16]. The virus isolation is usually performed in specific pathogen free (SPF) 9-11-day-old embryonated chicken eggs (ECE) [17]. RT-PCR has been used mostly for determining field strain of IBV. The antigenic variation of spike protein, especially S1 subunit protein, is determined by nucleotide sequencing method [7].",

After collection, the sample transported in ice box and stored at \u221220\u00b0C refrigerator in the laboratory. The organ samples were taken into sterile pestle and homogenized with the help of sterile scissors and mortar and added 20% phosphate-buffered saline to make a suspension and then centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min.
