            "text": "The advantage of genetic diversity has ensured the success of sexual reproduction in evolution, but in placental mammals it comes with the inherent dilemma that the maternal immune system must tolerate the existence of the semi-allogenic foetus/placenta that expresses both self (maternal) and non-self (paternal) antigens[1]. It is also clear that to prevent maternal rejection of the foetus and to sustain a successful pregnancy, potent mechanisms of immune regulation must be activated, such as suppression of T cell activation and function[2,3] and the generation of suppressor T regulatory (TReg) cells that function in an antigen specific manner[4]. Recent advances have demonstrated the importance of co-ordinating immune responses between pathogen detection (non-self antigens) by the innate immune system and activation or suppression of adaptive immune responses. In this regard dendritic cells (DCs) are an essential link in coordinating these immune responses in health and in pregnancy[5,6]. The placenta also appears to play an important though poorly understood role in promoting the immunotolerant state[2].",

These are evolutionary fossils, which at some ancient time point have infected germ line cells. Their ongoing high level expression in the placenta implies that they have imparted an evolutionary advantage for the host[7]. Syncytin-1 is a naturally occurring placental protein that is encoded by one of these retroviruses and has been shown to fuse human cytotrophoblast cells and promote syncytialisation that is crucial for placental formation[8]. Recently we also determined that human syncytin-1 released from the placenta suppresses maternal immune responses demonstrating it\u2019s potential to play a role in maternal/foetal tolerance[9].",

            "text": "Maternal immune tolerance may come at the cost of increased susceptibility to infection, with pregnant women at greater risk of infection from intracellular bacteria and viruses[10]. The emergence of a new pandemic strain of swine influenza in 2009 (herein referred to as H1N1pdm09) recently refocussed attention on this issue. In this pandemic 50% of the women who died were pregnant. This is a startling statistic that emphasises that pregnant women are at increased risk of developing infection with influenza and are also more likely to develop severe disease[11]. This increase in mortality and morbidity is also observed during seasonal influenza; with numerous studies reporting increased rates of influenza-induced respiratory hospitalisations in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women[12\u201315]. While several comorbidities have been identified that predisposed to susceptibility to H1N1pdm09 infection, pregnancy is the most intriguing as it imparts a temporary susceptibility of the maternal immune system to infection. To further understand this phenomenon, it is of particular note that those pregnant women with severe H1N1pdm09 infection presented with an acute syndrome of severe respiratory compromise and systemic inflammation, associated with aberrant immune responses. This is characterised by intense acute inflammation (increased levels of the cytokine IL-6), but also reduced antiviral T-helper (TH)-1 responses (reduced IFN-\u03b3) and heightened suppressor T cell signals (IL-10)[16]. The implications of these observations are that the development of a maternal state of immune tolerance may particularly impair their immune response to novel pathogens such as H1N1pdm09.",

Cytotoxicity of syncytin-1 has also previously been measured and confirmed to have no effect on cell viability or cytokine release[9]. Furthermore, the syncytin-1 preparation technique did not result in any endotoxin in the final protein. Using size exclusion chromatography we were able to separate syncytin-1 into two major peaks, one corresponding to a low level oligomerization and another as a multimeric complex. The multimeric peak corresponds to the bioactive conformation of the protein and has been used in all experiments. The low level oligomerization peak was also used but found not to be bioactive. The addition of syncytin-1 significantly reduced IFN-\u03b1 (6083 pg/mL, 95% CI 2848\u20139319 pg/mL) and IFN-\u03bb responses (539 pg/mL, 95% CI 255\u2013823 pg/mL) (p<0.001 Fig. 1A-B).

Exposure of PBMCs from NPNV women to H1N1pdm09, resulted in a robust antiviral response, characterised by the release of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03bb. However this response is considerably reduced in PBMCs from PNV women. Furthermore exposure of PBMCs from NPNV women to syncytin-1 remarkably alters their normal antiviral response; impairing the release of IFN-\u03b1/\u03bb, and promoting the release of IL-10 as well as the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6. We went on to demonstrate that this early antiviral response is predominantly mediated by pDCs, confirming our previous data that there are impaired early innate immune responses to influenza in pregnancy[21], but now demonstrating that this can be induced by exposure of pDCs to syncytin-1.",

            "text": "Sequences of retroviral origin make up a substantial part of the mammalian genome. Analysis of the human genome revealed that around 8% of human DNA is derived from retrovirus-like elements[22]. Human Endogenous Retroviruses (HERVs) are derived from exogenous retroviruses, which, at some ancient time-point, have infected germline cells[7,23] and, therefore, are passed on to all human cells. A HERV envelope gene belonging to the HERV-W family and encoding a protein expressed in the syncytiotrophoblast was first described in 1999[24] and was denoted syncytin-1[8]. Syncytin-1 was shown to fuse human cytotrophoblast cells and may be a key factor in regulating syncytialization during placental formation[8,25]. In addition to the fusogenic property of syncytin-1 and its role in syncytialization, the presence of an immunosuppressive region (ISD) in the amino acid sequence was also identified[8,24]. Syncytin-1 is normally produced and secreted by the placenta in exosomes. During pregnancy, maternal plasma exosomal protein concentrations average 0.61\u00b10.14; 0.94\u00b10.41 and 1.4\u00b10.11 mg/ml of plasma in the first, second and third trimester, respectively [26]. Syncytin-1 TM subunit (which carries the ISD) in placental exosomes is between 4\u20138% of total exosomal proteins, which means that during the second and third trimesters, the concentration of the bioactive Syncytin-1 TM in maternal plasma is around 783nM and 1.2\u03bcM, respectively. Therefore our use of Syncytin-1 recombinant ectodomain at 1\u03bcM is within the expected concentration found in circulating placental exosomes in maternal blood, with the potential to interact with the maternal immune system. We sought to establish whether human syncytin-1 could impair maternal immune responses. Firstly we identified that exosomes isolated from placental explant tissue and maternal blood contained syncytin-1. We then determined that isolated syncytin-1 modified maternal immune responses, through inhibiting the release of tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1, interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 and CXCL-10 from whole blood following in-vitro stimulation with lipopolysaccharide[9]. The presence of syncytin-1 in placental exosomes provides a means of reaching and interacting with maternal immune cells and represents a novel mechanism of endogenous retroviral mediated immunosuppression that may be relevant for immune tolerance and the undesirable increased susceptibility to infection.",

            "text": "Dendritic cells are key regulators of immune responses, and can promote or suppress T-cell responses depending on the circumstances[5]. This feature of DCs relates to their ability to integrate a diverse array of incoming signals, and then to direct an appropriate adaptive T-cell immune response. The important role of DCs in promoting maternal tolerance in pregnancy has only recently been examined. As pregnancy progresses through the third trimester, these cells undergo changes that promote a state of reduced responsiveness. Monocytes from pregnant women were found to have differentiated into less phenotypically mature DCs and express lower levels of CD80, CD86 and HLA-DR molecules compared with non-pregnant women[27]. In response to inflammatory stimuli monocyte-derived DCs from pregnant women, up-regulated CD86 more than CD80, and secreted less IL-12p70 but more IL-10, compared to cells from non-pregnant controls[27]. This implies the DCs from pregnant women have a reduced ability to stimulate a TH-1 immune response, skewing it towards a TH-2 like response that is less capable of protecting against viral infection. Furthermore factors released from the trophoblast in-vitro have also been shown to down regulate innate immune responses from mouse DCs and natural killer (NK) cells[6]. Consistent with this we have also shown an impairment of the innate immune response to influenza in pregnant women[21]. pDC (CD303(+)/CD1c(-) PBMCs) percentages were lower in pregnant compared with non-pregnant women (P <. 05), while following H1N1/09 infection, pDCs from pregnant women showed higher expression of CD86 (P <. 01), HLA-DR (P <. 001), and the negative regulator PDL1 (P <. 001) compared with non-pregnant women. These PBMCs also demonstrated reduced release of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 in response to H1N1pdm09. There was also reduced cell mediated immunity with increased PD-1 expression on CD8 T cells[21]. Our current findings now demonstrate that exposure of PBMCs to syncytin-1 specifically impairs the early innate immune response to H1N1pdm09 with reduced release of IFN- \u03b1 and IFN-\u03bb from pDCs. Mouse models of influenza clearly demonstrate that pDCs are recruited to the lungs early in influenza infection, are an important source of early IFN-\u03b1 and also regulate an early robust anti-viral T cell response[28]. Using a pDC deficient mouse, while the immune response to virus was delayed, an effective T cell specific response still occurred allowing effective viral clearance[28]. Therefore in the case of pregnancy, impaired pDC responses may not be enough alone to explain the susceptibility seen in pregnant women to influenza.",

We have assessed the early immune response of PBMCs to influenza in our model and the response consequently at the 48 hour time point has predominately been from pDCs. A small number of CD4+ T cells were responsible for the release of IFN-\u03b3 in response to influenza and there was a trend to reduced release with syncytin-1. Optimal activation of CD4 cells are likely to require a longer incubation period with influenza and syncytin-1.",

            "text": "The pregnancy-associated susceptibility to intracellular pathogens has been classically attributed to a shift in helper T cell differentiation from a Th1 to the Th2-dominated response required for maintaining pregnancy[31]. Recent work has now shown that the requirement for expanded immune tolerance during pregnancy is more specifically linked with the expansion of maternal TReg cells. For example, circulating maternal Foxp3+ TRegs expand and at peak mid-gestation levels are 50 percent higher compared to the non-pregnant state[32]. More recently this TReg activation and subsequent immunotolerant phenotype has been shown to be regulated by the placenta[33]. Maternal TReg expansion required for sustaining pregnancy then may create naturally occurring deficiencies in host defence. The expansion of immune-suppressive Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (TRegs), which occurs physiologically during pregnancy or when experimentally induced in mice, has previously been shown to cause enhanced susceptibility to Listeria and Salmonella [34]. Susceptibility was reduced with TReg-ablation. Importantly, the sustained expansion of maternal TRegs was essential for maintaining immune tolerance to the developing fetus because even partial transient ablation of Foxp3-expressing cells fractured maternal tolerance to fetal antigen and triggered fetal resorption. We now show that exposure of PBMCs to syncytin-1 led to a significant release of IL-10. This release was predominantly from pDCs and to a lesser extent TReg cells. Increased IL-10 plays an important role in activating and maintaining TRegs[35] especially in local tissues, with TReg activation and differentiation occurring via Notch dependent signaling and IL-10 exerting a positive autocrine effect on TRegs[36]. In addition IL-10 has well described immunosuppressive effects on CD4+ cells, inducing anergy and a reduced ability to release cytokines[37]. Our data show that syncytin-1 has the ability to impair the early innate antiviral responses as well as the induction of a robust Th-1 response that is required to efficiently clear infection. However while our results may be sufficient to explain enhanced susceptibility to influenza in pregnancy, syncytin-1 appears to also play a more sinister role in acutely worsening the acute inflammatory response.",

            "text": "Influenza, including infection with H1N1pdm09, usually does not cause severe infection, with an overall case fatality rate of 0.5%. However, a small number of individuals are more severely affected, requiring hospitalisation, and of those 9\u201330% will be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), usually with severe pneumonia and systemic inflammation[38]. This response has been seen in other causes of acute severe viral pneumonia such as SARS[39] and with the highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza[40]. In these severe cases there is evidence of a dysregulated immune response characterised by severe lung immunopathology and the intense release of acute inflammatory cytokines, suggestive of an inability to switch from an initial innate immune response to an effective adaptive immune response. Certain influenza viruses specifically induce this response, with mouse models of H5N1 and the 1918 pandemic H1N1 influenza strain both showing intense neutrophilic lung infiltrates[41], the consequences of which may contain the virus, but with the potential to produce severe acute lung injury. In those with severe HN1N1pdm09 there is similar evidence of an exaggerated acute response. Lee et al[42] compared 63 hospitalised severe H1N1pdm09 patients to 53 individuals with seasonal influenza and found evidence of an hyper-activated pro-inflammatory response characterised by elevated IL-6, and a suppressed adaptive Th1/Th17 response, with reduced CXCL-10, IFN\u03b3 and elevated IL-10. In addition elevated IL-6 was an independent predictor of admission to ICU and correlated closely with ex-vivo cytokine responses from PBMCs. Pregnant mice infected with H1N1pdm09 developed acutely increased IL-6, MCP-1 and KC (the mouse equivalent of CXCL-8), which was associated with an intense neutrophilic infiltration of the lung that lead to more widespread epithelial damage and a failure to repair damaged tissue. In addition the adaptive immune response was impaired with an increase in alternatively activated macrophages, and while no difference was seen CD8 T cell responses, the pregnant mice had higher numbers of TReg cells present in the bronchial alveolar lavage fluid[43]. It has recently been shown that a similar picture occurs in human pregnancy associated with H1N1pdm09 [44] where it has been found that CD69 on T lymphocytes and the TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-10 sera cytokines as well as CXCL8 were increased in H1N1pdm2009 virus-infected women. Also, pregnant women have increased NK- and T-cell cytokine and chemokine production in response to influenza virus in vitro, particularly H1N1pdm2009 virus, without a significant change in NK-cell, CD8+ T-cell, or CD4+ T-cell frequencies [45].",

Treatment of PBMCs with syncytin-1 alone was sufficient to increase the release of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6, with further small increases seen following exposure to H1N1pdm09. The release of IL-1\u03b2 implies that treatment of these monocytes with syncytin-1 was sufficient to trigger the inflammasome activation. Monocytes synthesise and release IL-1\u03b2 as inactive cytoplasmic precursor into the cytoplasm, and it is processed into biologically active forms in response to various pro-inflammatory stimuli (including viruses) by the cysteine protease caspase-1[46]. While influenza infection can directly activate monocytes, macrophages appear to require priming with another pro-inflammatory signal before an optimal response is seen following infection[47]. Syncytin-1 could be that signal. In pregnancy the presence of syncytin-1 may not only impair antiviral interferon responses from monocytes and DCs, but also lead to heightened activation of the inflammasome, with an exaggerated systemic inflammatory response, replicating that seen in those with severe H1N1pdm09 infection. The negative impact that such a response could have is considerable, as recent evidence suggests that genetic variants of IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 may exert a substantial impact on the susceptibility of H1N1pdm09 infection[48].",

Experiments using a 17-amino acid synthetic peptide dimer (CKS-17) with the consensus ISD sequence have induced immunosuppression both in vivo and in vitro on lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, natural killer and natural killer T cells, including the modulation of Th1 and Th2 immune responses. CKS-17 has been shown to inhibit the Th1 cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 along with an upregulation of IL-10[49,51\u201353]. It has also been shown that the recombinant transmembarne protein gp41 of the human immunodeficiency virus HIV-1 and a synthetic peptide with its ISD sequence, up-regulate the expression of IL-6, IL-10 and IL-1\u03b2 in a dose-responsive and sequence specific manner in human PBMCs[54,55]. Our results are consistent with this. When PBMCs from non-pregnant women were exposed to syncytin-1, an endogenous retroviral envelope protein, the resulting response was entirely consistent with that described for retrovirus mediated immunosuppression.",

We now show for the first time that this response can be induced in the PBMCs from healthy women by exposure to the placental derived protein syncytin-1. Syncytin-1 exposure leads to a marked reduction in pDC release of IFN-\u03b1/\u03bb to influenza, but it also stimulates enhanced release of IL-10 with the potential to further impair adaptive responses as well as enhanced release of IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 both of which potentially will worsen systemic inflammation. This is the first study to identify a direct link between a placental derived protein and suppressed maternal immunity. Given the risk posed by both seasonal and pandemic influenza, as well as other intracellular pathogens, to pregnant women this is a very important step forward and potentially identifies a target that could be manipulated to improve maternal and fetal outcomes globally during future pandemics.",
