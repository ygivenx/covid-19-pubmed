Recombinant antigen-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) are preferred for diagnosis owing to their high efficiency and reproducibility. Importantly, such assays do not require cultivation of MERS-CoV in biosafety level 3 facilities, which are not readily available in most laboratories. Although an S1-based ELISA Kit is commercially available and has been used in many studies,2, 3, 4, 5, 6 data are limited on comparing ELISAs that detect MERS-CoV antibodies in humans based on alternative recombinant antigens, including the extracellular domain (representative of the full-length spike protein (S)), N-terminal domain (NTD), receptor-binding domain (RBD) and nucleoprotein (NP). We used a series of sera from the first imported case of MERS in China to longitudinally evaluate antibody production and to compare the antigenicity of whole inactivated MERS-CoV, S, S1, NTD, RBD and NP. The sera were also used to investigate the correlation of ELISAs with the pseudovirus particle-based neutralization test (ppNT).",

A case investigation revealed a history of exposure to the first confirmed MERS case in South Korea when the male patient in question had visited his father who had been admitted to the same hospital ward as that of the Korean patient with MERS-CoV. On 20 May, while in Korea, the patient complained of feeling unwell but had no respiratory symptoms; his temperature was 38.7 \u00b0C on 25 May. However, 1 day later, against medical advice, he traveled from South Korea to Guangdong province (mainland China) via Hong Kong. On 27 May 2015, the Chinese Ministry of Health was notified of the patient's entry into China by the World Health Organization (WHO). The man was confirmed to be MERS-CoV-positive on 28 May and was immediately admitted to a hospital.7 He was discharged from the hospital at the end of June 2015. A series of venous blood samples were collected from the patient after he was admitted to the hospital. Normal control sera from 40 healthy blood donors (both sexes) were used to detect background values and calculate the cutoff values for the methods used in this study. The blood samples were processed within 24 h of collection, and the sera were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C.",

The inactivated MERS-CoV was then centrifuged at 3000 r.p.m. for 1 min at 4 \u00b0C to collect the supernatant after confirmation that it was non-infectious by titration in Vero cells. Subsequently, the supernatant was concentrated by centrifugation at 24 000 r.p.m. for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C, and the pellet was collected and dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) overnight. The concentrated MERS-CoV was quantified using a BCA-Based Protein Quantification Kit (Applygen Technologies Inc., Beijing, China) and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until use. In addition, the inactivated MERS-CoV was characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blotting (WB) assay.",

Aliquots of cell lysates were transferred to 96-well Costar flat-bottomed luminometry plates (Corning Costar, Corning, NY, USA), followed by addition of the luciferase substrate (Promega). Relative fluorescence intensity values were immediately determined using a Gaomax luminometer (Promega). The luciferase activity of Huh7.5-CD81 cells treated with pseudovirus alone (reference group) was defined as 100% infection. Cells not treated with pseudovirus were included as a background control. The results were expressed as the percentage of infection compared with those of the control group (Huh7.5 cells treated with only pseudovirus preparations). Fifty percent reductions in relative fluorescence intensity were used to calculate MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers in the sera. The NAb titers were defined as the highest serum dilutions that resulted in a 50% reduction in luciferase activity. NAb titers lower than 1:100 were considered negative.",

            "text": "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive investigation of the anti-MERS-CoV antibody profile in sera from a MERS patient based on a multiplex analysis of antibodies against both the S protein and NP. The longitudinal profiles of IgG and IgM antibodies in the sera from this case, the first to be imported into China, showed that seroconversion of antibodies detected by the S, S1 and RBD ELISAs occurred earlier than that detected by the inactivated MERS-CoV ELISA. The results shown in Figures 1 and 2 further illustrate that the S, S1 and RBD ELISAs are more sensitive than the whole MERS-CoV ELISA in detecting specific antibodies. In a previous severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) study, an S protein-based ELISA also appeared to be more sensitive than a virus-based Huada ELISA for detecting SARS-CoV-specific antibodies.11 The NP of SARS-CoV is an immunodominant antigen that is used to detect SARS-CoV infection.11, 12 In the present study, our NP-based ELISA illustrated the benefit of using recombinant NP for detecting MERS-CoV infection. However, seroconversion of NP-specific antibodies occurred later than seroconversion of antibodies against several S proteins and inactivated MERS-CoV. Woo et al.12 evaluated the longitudinal profile of IgG and IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV NP in patients with pneumonia due to SARS-CoV. The study showed that the levels of the two antibodies increased to detectable levels by the third week of illness, which was approximately 1 week later than that observed in another study by Lie et al.,13 based on a whole SARS-CoV ELISA. The 1-week delay in seroconversion of NP-specific antibodies in the study by Woo et al.12 compared with the results of Li et al.13 may reflect reduced sensitivity of NP-based ELISAs based on inactivated virus particles for detecting SARS-CoV infection at an early stage of illness, although clinical treatment may also interfere with the appearance of antibodies. The results of the two studies confirmed the characteristics of NP-specific antibodies in different contexts. Woo et al.12 reported that IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV NP increased to detectable levels later than IgG antibodies, in contrast to the phenomena described for most other pathogens. We found that IgM antibodies against some antigens were detectable at the same time or later than IgG in the present study, which may have been due to the earlier development of IgG than IgM antibodies or the different sensitivities of the Ig class-specific ELISAs.12",

In the present study, the recombinant RBD (which is the main epitope of S1) was as sensitive as S1 for detecting MERS-CoV infection, and there was an excellent correlation between the RBD ELISA and S1 ELISA, with a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.9701.

Moreover, the ppNT assay showed an excellent correlation with the S ELISA, although the latter is a binding assay while the former is a functional neutralizing assay. The MERS-CoV, S1, NTD and RBD ELISAs (OD450) had acceptable but lower Pearson's correlation coefficients (0.71\u20130.8439) when compared with the ppNT titer.

Although only one MERS-CoV case has been reported in China, additional cases with longer follow-ups are needed to comprehensively understand the MERS-CoV-derived antibody profile and to verify the specificity and sensitivity of MERS-CoV- and recombinant protein-based ELISAs. Fortunately, a series of serum samples was collected from this case. Additionally, a commercial S1-based ELISA Kit was available and was adopted as the reference test. We found that the ELISAs of various recombinant structural proteins, including S, S1, NTD, RBD and NP, as well as the ppNT assay, can be used for MERS-CoV diagnosis and seroepidemiology. The S, S1 and RBD ELISAs were more sensitive than other ELISA formats, especially the S1 and RBD ELISAs were advantageous because the recombinant S1 and RBD are smaller than the full-length S and easier to express and purify.",
