In terms of surveillance, pneumonia is not even listed as a national notifiable infectious disease [9], though in 2003 after the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), \u201cpneumonia of unknown cause\u201d was required to be reported because airborne etiologic agents such as the SARS coronavirus and human avian influenza virus (H5N1) are extremely pathogenic and capable of quickly causing an epidemic [10]. Moreover, China\u2019s current health policy of \u201cintegration of TCM and Western medicine\u201d need large-scale surveys comparing cases of childhood pneumonia at TCM and WM hospitals. Whether for guiding healthcare policy or for improving disease management and prevention, evaluating quality of care in paediatric pneumonia is of paramount importance. Through the ages, WM hospitals hold a principle status in public health. TCM hospitals are gradually into mass vision, although at most time as a complementary role. The two types of hospitals have advantages and disadvantages. Commonly, WM hospitals prefer to acute severe disease, and TCM hospitals prefer to chronic mild disease. To exploring specific difference on pneumonia therapy between two types of hospitals, this cross-sectional study was designed to investigate the distribution, diagnosis, treatment, and clinical outcome of childhood community-acquired pneumonia in China.",

However, in China dyspnea is rarely applied to diagnose mild pediatric pneumonia because though respiratory rate is increased, it is still within normal range, especially in very young children. Instead, cough and auscultatory findings are more commonly used. In our study, the prevalence of cough at admission was similar between TCM hospitals and WM hospitals.

Other authors [33-35] have reported that macrolides are more effective in shortening disease duration and reducing severity of M pneumoniae pneumonia compared with other antibiotics. Macrolides are also more effective for a wide range of bacterial pathogens [33,35], which might be one of the reasons that in our study this class of antibiotics was widely used. However, macrolide resistance is a serious worldwide problem [36-38]. Suzuki and colleagues [35] reported that of 96 cases of M pneumoniae pneumonia in Yamagata, Japan, 83.0% were identified as macrolide-resistant. Cephalosporins are widely used for treating childhood pneumonia in China. In fact, there has been inappropriate use and abuse of cephalosporins in China [39,40], where cephalosporins use was higher than Northern England (36% in 542 children [41]). In cases of pneumonia caused by M pneumoniae, cephalosporins are ineffective. In our study, among 1298 cases, 576 patients (44.4%) received third generation cephalosporins and 300 patients (23.1%) received second generation cephalosporins. In general, selection of antibiotics in China has not been based on drug sensitivity testing but on clinician experience or medical insurance policy. With the promulgation by the Chinese Ministry of Health in August 2012 of regulations on the rational use of antibiotics [42], it is hoped that arbitrary administration of antibiotics, especially for childhood pneumonia, will be curbed.",

According to literature review, most common adverse reactions of Chinese herbal injections were rash and pruritus, diarrhea, or vomiting [51].

This may be related to the mildness of disease or turnover in ward beds as required by local health policy. Another possible reason for shorter hospital stay in TCM hospitals is that treatment that combines TCM and WM based on syndrome differentiation is more effective than WM alone in resolving symptoms, thus reducing disease duration. In our study, fewer patients in TCM hospitals than in WM hospitals were reported as having symptoms, such as cough and sputum, at discharge. Shorter hospital stay in TCM hospitals may also be attributed to lower emphasis on strict adherence to discharge guidelines. For example, patients deemed \u201ccured\u201d and who are therefore discharged in TCM hospitals would in WM hospitals be considered only \u201cimproved\u201d and have a longer length of stay.",

Treatment is rendered based on the quantity, quality, and color of sputum. WM clinicians, on the other hand, view these finer points of sputum as less important, and assess and treat based simply on whether or not sputum is present. Indeed in our study, description of sputum was lacking in most of the cases in WM hospitals. TCM hospitals showed an advantage in relieving rales.
