In these patients diarrhoea occurs frequently, especially in HIV-1 patients who are not treated with anti-retroviral therapy. Routine diagnostics in fecal samples often remain negative, despite the sensitive diagnostic assays which are now available. In this study our aim is to identify the cause of diarrhoea for patients in which no enteropathogen could be found. There are several possible explanations why these patients remain negative in routine diagnostics: First, HIV-1 itself might play a role. HIV-1 infected mucosal cells have been observed in HIV-1 infected persons [6-11] and enterocytes exposed to HIV-1 show altered function and proliferation [12,13]. However, it has not been demonstrated that HIV-1 causes diarrhoea. Secondly, there are several recent reports describing novel viral agents which are found in stool that could play a role in diarrhoea (see below), and these agents are not yet included in routine diagnostics. Thirdly, an unknown or unexpected virus might be causing diarrhoea.",

            "text": "One of the recently described gastrointestinal viruses is cosavirus, which was identified in 2008 as a member of the Picornaviridae[14]. The virus was originally found in 2 patients with gastrointestinal infections [14,15]. However, its link with diarrhoea has not been established and a recent study in HIV-infected individuals detected cosavirus in a substantial number of patients without diarrhoea [16]. Aichi virus is another recently described picornavirus which was identified in fecal samples of patients with gastroenteritis [17]. Several manuscripts have since then confirmed that the virus is associated with diarrhoea [18,19], although in one study, which included children without diarrhoea, the association with disease could not be established since the amount of positive samples was too low [20]. Human gyrovirus, a member of the Circoviridae, is the most unusual novel virus which is found in gastrointestinal infections [21]. The virus is genetically very closely related to gyroviruses found in chicken meat [22] and therefore it remains uncertain whether human gyrovirus in stool is a sign of gastrointestinal infection or a virus which is digested with food and shed in feces, like many food related viruses [23].",

Still, in 34% of the patients with diarrhoea the causative agent could not be found. A careful investigation of the cause of unexplained diarrhoea in these 10 patients was performed using deep sequencing strategies.

In our study a very sensitive nested PCR assay was used which enables detection of the virus even if it is present at low concentrations. To exclude that the high prevalence was caused by PCR contamination, all positive PCR products were sequenced. Variation between the viruses from different patients was observed, thereby excluding contamination by a single source (see nucleotide alignments in Additional file 1: Table S3).",
