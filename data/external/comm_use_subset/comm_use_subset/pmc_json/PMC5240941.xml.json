HMPV is usually detected in airway secretions from children with RTI by use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, and the virus seldom appears in healthy children [8]. HMPV has been classified into the Pneumoviridae family. Two main genotypes (A and B) and at least four genetic subtypes (A1, A2, B1 and B2) exist [9\u201312]. Whether these genotypes cause similar or different infections is largely unclarified because some studies have shown quite similar manifestations [13\u201315], whereas others found that either genotypes A [16,17] or B [18] may cause more severe disease.",

It has been reported that RSV and HMPV infections in children may be quite similar [23,25,26], but there is also some evidence that RSV causes more severe disease than HMPV [6,18]. Risk factors for severe RSV infection are young age, prematurity, chronic lung disease, chronic heart disease and severe neurological disabilities [18,24,27\u201330]. Although it has not been studied to the same extent, it seems that some of these factors may also increase the risk of severe HMPV infection [2,17,18,29,31\u201333]. With some exceptions [18,29], most studies have separately dealt with risk factors for severe HMPV and RSV infections.",

The hospital provides care for 58,000 children younger than 16 years and 18,000 children younger than five years of age from S\u00f8r-Tr\u00f8ndelag County in Mid-Norway (Statistics Norway). Written informed consent to participate was collected from children \u226512 years and caregivers to most of the children during the hospital stay. However, due to practical challenges, including dealing with children 24 hours a day, we also enrolled some children after hospital discharge. Their caregivers received written information per regular mail, and the child was included if the caregivers did not resist enrollment by contacting the hospital within two weeks. The latter inclusion method was also approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics. Some children were included more than one time if they were hospitalized with distinct RTI episodes, whereas recurrent hospitalizations due to the same RTI were only registered once. Exclusion criteria were children evaluated for RTI who were hospitalized mainly due to other diseases, such as newborns not dismissed from the hospital, children with cytostatic or immune-suppressive treatment, and children with other infections such as gastroenteritis and urinary tract infection. We systematically collected baseline characteristics and past and current medical history from caregivers, who filled out a questionnaire, while clinical information was abstracted from medical records. Characteristics included gestational age at birth, age, gender, siblings, day care attendance and chronic diseases. Preterm birth was defined as a gestational age <36 weeks of gestation, and age was categorized according to clinically relevant groups. Chronic airway diseases, other than asthma, included bronchopulmonary dysplasia, congenital airway malformations, cystic fibrosis and neuromuscular disorders with hypoventilation in need of respiratory support and daily inhalations for mucus clearance. Tachypnea was defined as a \u226510 increase in normal respiratory rate according to the child\u2019s age [34]. Several children had more than one chronic disease, i.e. both asthma and other chronic airway disease, or both cerebral palsy and epilepsy. Hence, for the logistic regression analyses, we used a combined binary variable: \u201c\u22651 chronic disease\u201d (coded: no chronic disease or \u22651 chronic disease). Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected within 24 hours of presentation in the vast majority of the children. Children with a stay <24 hours were categorized as outpatients, while children who stayed \u226524 hours and were admitted to the wards of the Pediatric Department, were categorized as inpatients. From the main cohort of children with acute RTI, we selectively included HMPV- and RSV-infected children hospitalized with LRTI into the present study (Fig 1). Consequently, outpatients, children admitted with isolated upper RTI (URTI) and children admitted with LRTI and viruses other than HMPV or RSV, and virus negatives, were excluded (Fig 1). The Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics approved the study.",

Prior to 2011, all children in need of NIV were admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). During 2011, respiratory support with high-flow nasal cannula was introduced at the wards, which reduced the need for PICU admissions. Invasive ventilator (IV) support was defined as RS applied by endotracheal tube or tracheostomy, and children with acute respiratory failure in need of IV were admitted to the PICU. Initiation of any RS, or an increase in baseline RS for those with chronic RS, were defined as RS related to the acute RTI. To adjust for our new practice performing NIV treatment at the wards, we defined a disease severity score reflecting disease severity independently of treatment location. This score, ranging from 0 to 4 points, was defined as the sum of: 1) a need for oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation \u226593% (1 point); 2) length of stay \u22656 days, corresponding to or above the 75 percentile limit for all hospitalized children with LRTI (1 point); 3) a need for respiratory support with NIV (1 point); 4) a need for respiratory support with both NIV and IV (2 points); and 5) need of IV support (2 points). In addition, admission to the PICU, was reported as a disease severity measure. Severe disease was defined as a disease severity score \u22652 points, corresponding to- or above the 75% percentile limit among all hospitalized children with LRTI.",

A high viral load was defined as a Ct-value <28, a medium viral load with Ct-values of 28\u201335, and a low viral load with Ct-values >35. Ct-values above 42 were regarded as virus-negative.

Conventional viral cultures were also performed. The detection of HMPV as a single virus in the NPA is named single HMPV, while HMPV co-detected with \u22651 other virus is named HMPV with co-detection. Similar expressions are also used for RSV. The HMPV-positive specimens were genotyped by real-time PCR and DNA sequencing using primers targeting the F-gene of HMPV [11]. A 527-bp amplicon was sequenced using a Big Dye Terminator v.3.1 cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Sequences were analyzed on an ABI 3130XL (Applied Biosystems). Genotypes were determined by comparing sequenced data with the nucleotide BLAST database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/).

We compared HMPV and RSV using stratified analyses among those with single virus infections and those with viral co-detections. Children with both HMPV and RSV were excluded from these analyses. Due to significant age differences between HMPV- and RSV-infected children, we also used a stratification strategy to control for age. We analyzed risk factors for severe disease in HMPV- and RSV-infected children separately, using logistic regression. We dichotomized the combined disease severity score, defining cases as a score \u22652 and controls as a score <2, and used this as a binary outcome in the logistic regression analyses. We predefined factors related to exposure and outcome to be age, prematurity, \u22651 chronic disease, viral co-detection and Ct-values. All factors were entered into full multivariable logistic regression models. Final models for HMPV and RSV, respectively, were obtained by stepwise removing factors with P > 0.1. Testing for a possible covariance between variables such as prematurity and \u22651 chronic disease showed that both variables could be entered into the same models, but that it was not possible to include specific chronic diseases.

The single HMPV-infected children were older (14.7 months vs. 5.4 months, P < 0.001), more often were born premature and more often had chronic diseases including asthma, other chronic airway diseases, epilepsy and cerebral paresis, compared to children with a single RSV infection (Table 1). Age-stratified analyses showed that these differences primarily appeared in children aged 12\u201323 months (prematurity) and 6\u201311 months (chronic diseases), respectively (Table 4). More children with a single HMPV infection had otitis media and pneumonia, and were treated with antibiotics and corticosteroids (Table 2). In contrast, more children with a single RSV infection had bronchiolitis and received inhalations (Table 2). However, when we controlled for age we found no significant differences in the distribution of diagnoses (Table 4). Interestingly, among children aged <6 months, nine out of 10 children with HMPV, as well as those with RSV, had bronchiolitis (Table 4). Children with a single HMPV infection had a higher peak temperature and higher peak CRP levels, but adjusted for age, these differences also disappeared (Tables 1 and 4). When we compared the entire single virus-infected groups with HMPV and RSV, there were no differences in disease severity, i.e. there were no differences in need of oxygen and respiratory support, PICU admission and length of hospital stay. The combined disease severity scores were also equal (Table 3). However, age was a strong factor for explaining the disease severity (Table 4 and Fig 2). The effect of age differed among HMPV and RSV infected children. In the youngest age group of <6 months old, the children with HMPV infection had a milder disease because they less frequently needed oxygen, and they had a shorter hospital stay and a lower severity score (Table 4 and Fig 2). On the other hand, the single HMPV-infected children in the age group of 12\u201323 months had a more severe disease than the children with RSV; they were treated more days with oxygen, more often received respiratory support, more often were admitted to the PICU, had a longer hospital stay and more often had a severity score \u22652 (Table 4 and Fig 2).",

There were no differences in peak temperature, peak CRP levels and LRTI diagnoses. The clinical courses also differed to some extent (Table 3). Although the same rate of children with HMPV and RSV co-detections needed oxygen, HMPV-positive children needed oxygen longer (P = 0.022).

However, the clinical course varies in relation to age, and the age effect differed among single virus HMPV- and RSV-infected children.

On this basis, and on observations done by others [14,17,23], it seems evident to conclude that viral co-detections in HMPV-infected children usually have no cumulative clinical effects to that of HMPV alone.

In other studies, genotype A1 has also been the most seldom genotype detected [13\u201315,17,36]. Our data clearly show that the present HMPV genotype variations do not relate to any particular premorbid condition, and causes infection with quiet similar clinical manifestations and outcomes in children. Consequently, our findings confirm results from previous studies with smaller sample sizes [13\u201315,36,37]. However, Schuster et al. [17] genotyped 192 HMPV-positive in children <2 years old in Jordan enrolled during three years, and found that HMPV genotype A infection was associated with an increased need for oxygen compared to genotype B infection. In another study, including 68 HMPV-positive hospitalized children <3 years of age enrolled during four winter seasons in Canada by Papenburg et al. [18], infection with HMPV genotype B was associated with either an increased oxygen need, PICU attendance or a hospitalization >5 days. The diverging findings in these two studies compared to our study may be explained by different age of the included children, and because the outcome \u201csevere disease\u201d in the two other studies probably included less ill children than in our study. Furthermore, naturally occurring genotype variations over shorter time intervals may also increase the risk of random findings.",

Two-thirds with HMPV infection were 1 to 5 years old and less than one-fifth was <6 months old, and nearly half of RSV-infected children were <6 months old. In addition, we confirmed findings from previous studies that more HMPV-infected children were preterm born [18,29] and had a chronic disease [2,32]. On the other hand, HMPV and RSV in many ways caused a quite similar spectrum of LRTI types. Looking at the entire groups of children with HMPV and RSV infections, bronchiolitis was the most common diagnosis in both viruses, although a 50% higher rate was observed in children with RSV. By contrast, HMPV-infected children apparently had pneumonia and otitis media more often. However, these findings were confounded by age. In children <6 months old with a single virus infection, 90% of both viral infections were classified as bronchiolitis, and in children older than 6 months, no significant differences in bronchiolitis and pneumonia rates were found. In previous studies, it has been shown that temperature and CRP may increase to higher levels in children with HMPV infection than in those with RSV [3,38], but we could not confirm this after adjusting for age.",

            "text": "We found that disease severity was very similar when we compared the entire groups of children with HMPV and RSV, and others have also previously reported this [23,25,26]. However, age was strongly related to disease severity, and the age effect differed among single virus HMPV- and RSV-infected children. First of all, only one-fifth of the hospitalized children with single HMPV infection were younger than 6 months, compared to half of those with RSV. Secondly, HMPV infection was associated with a milder disease than RSV infection among children aged <6 months, as indicated by a less frequent need for oxygen, a shorter hospital stay and a lower severity score. Furthermore, the data provided evidence that in children aged 12\u201323 months old, HMPV infection may be more severe than RSV infection, with a longer need for oxygen treatment, more children in need of respiratory support, more children admitted to PICU, a longer hospital stay and a higher severity score. A possible explanation for these observations might have been that neonates attain higher concentrations of maternally derived protective antibodies against HMPV, as compared to RSV, during pregnancy and the first six months of life. However, data from a recent clinical study measuring HMPV and RSV antibody concentrations did not confirm this hypothesis [40]. Another explanation might have been that HMPV-infected children more often than children with RSV had a primary and potentially more severe infection among those children aged 12\u201323 months, but it was not possible for us to assess whether children had a primary or secondary infection. In general, clinical manifestations in children with airway infections are related to the net effect of physical and genetic factors, as well as viral- and immune-mediated reactions in the maturing child, which are strongly correlated to the child\u2019s age [41,42]. We found that high RSV viral loads, but not high HMPV viral loads, were associated with severe disease. Thus, based on these clinical observations among our population of hospitalized children, it may be tempting to claim that RSV is a more potent virus than HMPV among infants, and that RSV infection more than HMPV is a virally driven disease. Recently, other researchers have published data supporting a similar assumption [43]. In accordance with our findings, Roussy et al. [37] found that HMPV viral loads were not associated with increased disease severity among hospitalized children (inpatients), but hospitalized patients had higher HMPV viral loads than outpatients [37]. It has also been shown by others that LRTI may be associated with higher HMPV viral loads than URTI [44]. For this reason, it seems that HMPV viral loads may relate to disease severity to a certain extent, but not among those with the most severe disease.",

We included a population-based sample consisting of all children aged <16 years who were admitted with acute RTI, although the vast majority were aged <5 years. We used a compound severity score combining several outcome measures. Although this score has not been validated, it fit the routines at our department and rather rigorously defined severe disease, and provided reliable risk factor estimates. We confirmed that independent risk factors for both severe HMPV and RSV infections were the presence of chronic diseases and a history of prematurity. Children aged 12 to 23 months had a three-fold increased risk of developing severe HMPV infection, and those aged \u226524 months had a nearly four-fold increased risk. Among RSV-infected children, infants less than six months had a nearly double risk compared to older children. Having one or more chronic diseases doubled the risk in both virus types, but due to a significant co-variation, our data set could not be used to identify which chronic diseases more precisely increased the risk. Prematurity with a gestational age less than 36 weeks increased the risk of severe HMPV infection three-fold, as shown by others [31], and severe RSV infection for approximately 50%. However, prophylactic use of palivizumab in high-risk children may have confounded this risk estimation in relation to RSV. Hence, in hospitalized children, our data confirm the findings from other studies that particular age groups, prematurity and the presence of chronic diseases independently increase the risk of developing severe LRTI among children with HMPV infection [2,17,18,29,31\u201333] and RSV infection [18,24,27\u201330].",

NPA were taken from the majority of the admitted children, and 81.7% were included in the main study cohort. Moreover, we analyzed all NPA using a broad panel of sensitive virus tests during the entire period, which allowed us to examine viral co-detections thoroughly. Nonetheless, it may be a limitation that bacterial co-detections were not considered, but most children had low or moderately increased CRP values. Furthermore, during the entire study period almost all Norwegian children received conjugated pneumococcal vaccines, which has reduced the incidence of pneumococcal infections [45]. Although this does not completely exclude pneumococcal coinfection, at least HMPV- and RSV-infected children may have been similarly influenced. Diagnostic and work-up biases could have affected our results negatively, since the clinicians were not blinded for the NPA results, and because patients were not treated after a study protocol.",
