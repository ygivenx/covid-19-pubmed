            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), is a highly contagious intestinal infectious disease. PED is an important disease in swine-producing countries. PED causes the death of newborn piglets and weight loss in pigs of all ages from PEDV-induced severe symptoms, such as serious diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration, which seriously damage the swine industry [1]. Following reports in 1978 [1], PED had an outbreak in swine-farming countries in Asia, North America, South America, and Europe [2,3,4,5]. Starting from the end of 2010, highly virulent PEDV variants that differed from the classic European strain CV777 were widespread in China, resulting in high mortality of newborn piglets and huge economic losses [6,7,8,9]. PEDV can be divided into genotypes G1 and G2 based on phylogenetic analysis of full-length S gene sequences [10]. PEDV strains detected in China since 2010 mostly belonged to genotype G2, which differed genetically from the CV777 vaccine strain belonging to subtype G1 [11]. However, many studies demonstrated that commercially available PEDV vaccines derived from classical strains of PEDV do not provide effective protection against highly virulent PEDV variant infections in China [3]. Thus, PEDV infection remains a major veterinary problem. Understanding it is essential to developing novel antiviral drugs that will specifically inhibit PEDV propagation.",

            "text": "RNA interference (RNAi) is a short, double-strand RNA-induced process that targets and degrades the messenger RNA (mRNA) of specific sequences [12,13]. Post-transcriptional gene silencing can be mediated by exogenous small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), endogenous microRNAs (miRNAs), and short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs). Effective gene knockdown is achieved by shRNAs by inducing the endogenous RNAi process [14,15]. Transcribed shRNAs are exported from the nucleus by Exportin-5 and processed by the RNase III Dicer into small double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules of 19 to 23 bp called siRNAs. The complementary guide strand of processed siRNA is incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex to mediate the cleavage of target mRNAs [16,17]. RNAi evolves in the host defense system directed at infectious viruses and transposable elements. Effective silencing of transgene expression and endogenous genes in vivo was shown by a number of groups [6,7,18]. These findings raised the possibility that RNAi could be another therapeutic approach for inhibiting virus infection. ShRNAs were employed for therapy against human viral diseases, as well as cancer and neurogenerative diseases [8]. PEDV primarily infects villous epithelial cells throughout the small intestine and causes serious injury of intestine epithelial cells (IECs), including superficial villous enterocyte swelling and severe diffuse atrophic enteritis [19]. Infection of PEDV variant strains in the field complicates the development of prophylactic and therapeutic strategies to protect suckling pigs from diarrhea. As an RNA virus, PEDV could be an ideal target for studying its biology and therapeutics using RNAi.",

In this study, we compared and analyzed N gene sequences from 25 different PEDV G1 and G2 isolates from different countries. Three novel shRNAs targeting conserved and unexploited regions in the N gene were tested for inhibition of PEDV CV777 and LNCT2 replication. Cell viability, viral titer, and protein expression were examined as indicators of the efficacy of targeted gene silencing by the shRNAs. All three shRNAs effectively inhibited PEDV replication and N expression of the G1 and G2 subtypes.",

            "text": "The PEDV N protein is predominantly produced in susceptible cells, which makes it a major target for early and accurate diagnosis [26]. The N protein forms complexes with coronavirus genomic RNA and enhances the viral transcription and assembly. Because of the importance of N protein in viral replication and the coronavirus N gene long used as a major target for shRNA design, we focused on the inhibition of PEDV infection using RNAi targeting the N gene of PEDV and systematically evaluated suppression efficiency. Alterations of viral genomes such as nucleotide substitution, insertion, and deletion have the potential to decrease the inhibitory effect of shRNA. We analyzed 25 N gene sequences derived from PEDV genotypes G1 and G2 and only found single-nucleotide substitutions. Considering the nucleotide substitutions in the N gene, we chose three conserved and unexploited regions for the design of shRNAs. PEDV is primarily transmitted through the fecal\u2013oral route and infects intestinal villous epithelial cells in vivo [27]. Current in vitro cell cultures of PEDV include Vero E6 cells, MARC-145 cells (another monkey kidney cell line), and HEK293 cells [28]. Most are non-porcine intestinal epithelial cells and, thus, not ideal in vitro cellular models for studying the interaction between PEDV infection and the host response due to interspecific variation. The IEC cell line represented a better model of normal porcine intestinal epithelium than transformed cell lines, and provided a unique opportunity to explore host\u2013pathogen interactions in an in vitro system [29]. Using this cell model, we showed that shRNA expression did not affect the viability of IEC cells. Co-transfection of recombinant plasmid pMyc-N and different concentrations of shRNAs highlighted the success of the gene knockdown at the protein level. GFP was an important reporter for N gene expression. For example, if the N gene was silenced by the shRNAs, the translation of GFP protein in frame with the N gene in the recombinant plasmid would also be inhibited. This hypothesis was consistent with our findings. Our shRNAs shR-N307, shR-N463, and shR-N1071 strongly reduced GFP expression, and the inhibition was dose-dependent. In addition, the model system was exploited to further study the pathological functions of PEDV genes. We assessed the capacity of shR-N307, shR-N463, and shR-N1071 for inhibiting the gene and protein expressions of PEDV CV777 and LNCT2 strains in vitro. We observed that shR-N307, shR-N463, and shR-N1071 were able to knock down target gene expression of PEDV CV777 and LNCT2 strains at 48 hpi. We also showed that shR-N307, shR-N463, and shR-N1071 against the N gene suppressed PEDV CV777 and LNCT2 strain replication.",

As recombinant lentiviruses have a higher adaptability and replication ability in host cells, and as their genes can be integrated into cellular genomes, the silencing effect of lentiviruses is more efficient than plasmids [30]. However, this kind of gene integration may induce host genome mutations and cause cellular injury. In addition, excessive expression of shRNAs competitively inhibits cell endogenous miRNAs and causes cytotoxicity [31]. Therefore, RNAi mediated by a plasmid is currently safer for high gene silencing efficiency. However, off-target effects from using plasmid-based siRNA are still a shortfall [32]. To solve this problem, designing improved siRNA sequences, as well as developing novel and progressive vectors, is necessary.",

Infection of PEDV CV777 (G1) or LNCT2 (G2) occurred post transfection. Detection by Western blot and viral titer assays was used to measure levels of viral replication in cells. The results demonstrated that PEDV G1 and G2 strains were susceptible to RNAi pathways targeting the N gene. All shRNA tests led to the silencing of N gene expression and suppressed proliferation of PEDV G1 and G2 strains in IEC cells. In sum, our data showed the potential for the shRNA expression vectors to precisely and effectively interfere with the replication of PEDV G1 and G2 strains in vitro. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the inhibition of PEDV G1 and G2 strain infection with shRNAs in IEC cells. Therefore, this report enriches the antiviral spectrum of RNAi treatment. Although IEC cells are a non-transformed porcine intestinal epithelial cell line, these cells lack the complexity of the cell types found in the architecture of the intestinal epithelium and, thus, do not satisfactorily mimic the natural infection process. This method merits further investigation in animal studies to define its therapeutic potential. Determining if the technology could be used in vivo for anti-PEDV therapy is still under investigation.",
