By concentrating control measures only on observed cases (treatment, isolation, culling), resources are used efficiently but control is often not effective enough. On the other hand, by directing control to the whole population (mass vaccination, prophylactic treatment, preventive culling), epidemics are most likely contained, but at high cost.",

Tracing and quarantine has been successfully applied for smallpox control, where the term \u2018Leicester method\u2019 refers to exactly this strategy, with the establishment of specific smallpox hospitals [1]. It was also successful during the more recent SARS epidemic [2], but not during the British foot-and-mouth epidemic [3]. Here we wish to investigate how these differences can be accounted for by the tracing process, thereby distinguishing tracing and quarantine as having separate effects which can be explained as follows.",

If one of the contactees is notified as being infected, by becoming symptomatic or by being traced via a secondary contact, the contact is traced with a probability pc (all parameters and functions of the model are given in Table 1). Each contact may be traced only once, either from infector to infectee (forwards tracing) or from infectee to infector (backwards tracing), so its traceability can be determined at the time of transmission.

In our model, \u03c4 measures time since infection of an individual, which starts with a latent period until \u03c4 = \u03c4lat without transmission of the pathogen. During the infectious period, lasting from \u03c4lat to \u03c4inf, infecteds give rise to \u03b2 new infecteds per unit of time, as long as they are not detected. As we are interested in the effectiveness of tracing only, we do not model possible transmission that might occur while being isolated, so transmission \u2018ceases\u2019 after detection of the infected. This leaves us with the basic reproduction ratio prior to detection, defined as the expected number of secondary infections per infected in a susceptible population before detection, R\n0\npre. Here we have adjusted the interpretation of the model in [4], where R\n0 is divided in an asymptomatic and a symptomatic part, by adding a detection delay after becoming symptomatic. The part R\n0\npre is determined by \u03c4lat, \u03c4inf, \u03b2, and the distribution of the detection time, a Gamma-distribution with mean 1 (so time is measured relative to the mean detection time) and shape parameter \u03b1. Throughout our analyses, \u03b2 will be scaled accordingly to achieve a desired value of R\n0\npre. This model construction allows a flexible way of exploring different assumptions about the time to detection, the infectious period, and their overlap, and it enables us to evaluate tracing effectiveness for most infections.",

As a control we analyzed intermediate cases (results not shown) and four examples of real infections (influenza, SARS, smallpox, and foot-and-mouth disease), of which the parameter values are listed in Table 2. These parameter values were obtained from literature [2], [3], [12]\u2013[14], assuming that the time to detection consists of the incubation period (time to symptom onset) plus a symptom-to-detection delay, which we assumed to be distributed as observed in the SARS epidemic (average 3.67 days, [2]).",

If we locate the approximate position of real infections (parameter values in Table 2) in Figure 2, we observe that the long infectious period will be the best approximation for most infections, because we only regard pre-detection transmission and infecteds will often still be infectious at the time of detection.

The largest difference between single-step and iterative tracing is observed when single-step tracing is on the brink of being effective, so that is the only situation where iterative tracing will make a difference (see also Figure 4). Without delays this difference is rather intuitive: single-step tracing is not effective if the latent period is small, but iterative tracing will always be effective, because if all contacts are traceable, the first detection is immediately followed by quarantine of every infected. This is the case with influenza, although the improvement will probably not be sufficient to making tracing effective for influenza control.

The reason is that the few infecteds that are detected late (or not at all, which is essentially the same) will be discovered by backwards tracing which is an additional effect to forwards tracing that in itself may already result in pc* = 1\u22121/R\n0\npre.

Thus, influenza control will benefit from iterative tracing already without delays, whereas with the other infections one or two days may be gained (Figure 4C,D), thus having more time to achieve the required pc*. In the real world, the choice between single-step and iterative tracing will be based on what is possible. Capacity problems may reduce the effectiveness of iterative tracing if effort is directed towards secondary contactees prior to primary contactees; on the other hand, if not quarantine but vaccination is applied, it might be worthwhile to traced contactees of contactees even without diagnostic tests [6].",

However, with human infections it is very likely that isolation and quarantine will be less effective. This results in a complicated situation, because transmission will not only be reduced after detection, the contact structure will also change, with only a limited number of people (health-care workers) having contact with multiple isolated patients. For the case of SARS, a more detailed model on exactly this aspect was studied by Lloyd-Smith et al [5], who indeed concluded that minimizing within-hospital transmission might be crucial, especially if tracing and isolation occur rather slowly. Further studies are required for this complex problem. The present paper provides a good understanding of the principles of contact tracing, and how infectious disease characteristics determine the effectiveness.",
