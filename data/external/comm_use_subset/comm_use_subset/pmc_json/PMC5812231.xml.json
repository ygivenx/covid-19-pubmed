However, not all pigs infected with PCV2 will develop PCVAD, other factors, such as animal management, coinfection and immunostimulation, have been reported to be associated with the disease [7]. Our recent findings suggested that both oxidative stress and ochratoxin A (OTA) enhance PCV2 replication [8, 9], which may partly explain the difference in morbidity and severity of PCVAD among PCV2-infected pig farms.",

            "text": "Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved process that mediates the degradation of long-lived proteins and damaged organelles for recycling in response to diverse stress stimuli, including starvation, oxidative stress and viral infection [10\u201312]. During this process, sections of cytoplasm are sequestered within double-membrane vesicles (named autophagosomes) that eventually fuse with lysosomal compartments for bulk degradation [13, 14]. The kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is known to be a major modulator of autophagy [15]. AKT is an upstream molecular of kinase mTOR, and the activation of AKT could inhibit autophagy [16]. In recent years, interaction between autophagy and viral infection have been revealed in numerous studies. Normally, autophagy acts as a host antimicrobial defense mechanism against a variety of pathogens, including bacteria and viruses by delivering them to the lysosomal compartment [17, 18]. However, some viruses such as hepatitis C virus and dengue virus have developed strategies to utilize autophagy for their own benefit of replication [19, 20]. Previous studies suggested that PCV2 virus induces autophagy by suppressing the mTOR signaling pathway, and the inhibition of autophagy reduces the replication of PCV2 [21, 22].",

Selenium-deficiency has been reported to be linked to high occurrence, enhanced virulence or progression of some viral infections such as coxsackievirus, influenza, SARS coronavirus and HIV infections in humans and animals [27, 28]. In the meantime, selenium supplementation could serve as an appropriate adjuvant therapy to many viral infections including PCV2 [29, 30]. Our previous studies have shown that selenium supplementation could inhibit PCV2 replication through the regulation of selenoproteins in redox status [9, 31], indicating that selenium has a protective effect against PCV2 infection. However, whether selenium exerts its anti-PCV2 effect through autophagy remains unclear.",

Despite much progress in the PCV2vaccine, vaccine efficacy remains uncertain due to variations in concentration of antigen, adjuvant type and the administration doses [35]. Nutrition supplementation in trace elements is suggested to be an effective prophylactic protection against viral infections [36]. Selenium is an essential micronutrient for both humans and animals [37]. Selenium deficiency has been reported to be related to enhanced virulence and severity of some viruses including HIV and Coxsackie virus [38, 39], whereas selenium supplementation could improve the immune response to protect against viral infections. In HIV infection, selenium supplementation increased CD4+ T cells and suppressed the progression of viral loads [28]. And selenium supplementation could protect mice infected with H1N1 as well [40]. In this study, we determined the anti-viral activity of selenium against OTA-induced PCV2 replication promotion in PK-15 cells, and our results show that OTA promoted PCV2 replication by inducing autophagy through the AKT/mTOR pathway and selenium supplementation inhibited OTA-induced PCV2 replication promotion in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, we show that selenium supplementation exerts its protective effects by inhibiting autophagy through the activation of the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.",

Previous studies also showed that inhibition of autophagy could suppress viral replication, including PCV2 [22]. So, we wondered whether autophagy was involved in the mechanism underlying the anti-PCV2 effect of selenium. In the present study, we first demonstrate that SeMet supplementation prevented the activation of autophagy induced by OTA, as reflected by decreased levels of LC3-II, ATG5 and the number of GFP-LC3 spots (Figure 5). Our results show that OTA induced autophagy by inactivating the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in PCV2-infected PK-15 cells (Figure 4). In addition, several studies have indicated that selenium could activate the PI3 K-AKT pathway [49], and studies showed that mTOR is directly linked to AKT, and the PI3 K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway plays an important role in autophagy [48]. Thus, we speculate that the inhibiting effect of selenium on autophagy is due to its activation of the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. In addition, our results further show that the levels of p-AKT and p-mTOR were restored after the treatment of SeMet in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway was activated after the treatment of SeMet.",

And the treatment of rapamycin could increase the ratio of LC3-II/\u03b2-actin, as well as PCV2 replication, which partly attenuated the anti-autophagy and anti-PCV2 effects of SeMet. These observations indicate that SeMet might block OTA-induced PCV2 replication promotion by inhibiting autophagy through the activation of the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.",
