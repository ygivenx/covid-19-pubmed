For the diagnosis and treatment of severe IV infections, it is important to determine the infection status and the status (timing and quality) of the host response. Detection of virus in nasal swaps by rapid influenza diagnostic tests or by polymerase chain reaction tests is the first step to diagnose an IV infection. However, detection of virus per se in these swabs is not very informative for treatment decisions. It does not provide information on the level of virus replication in the lung, which is most relevant for severe IV disease nor does it allow clinicians to evaluate the degree or quality of the host response. For example, hypoxia is a hallmark for severe IV infections, but it represents a very late stage marker of disease. Therefore, a significant need exists for earlier biomarkers that have prognostic value for predicting the development of severe IV disease. Furthermore, whether an individual is suffering from viral or bacterial pneumonia has important implications for treatment; however, it is often difficult to differentiate between the two types of pneumonia using current diagnostic methods (Parnell et al. 2012). Therefore, more and better biomarkers are needed that allow diagnosis of disease driven by IV infection, bacterial co-infection, or the infection-induced host response.",

Studies in genetically well-defined mouse populations have shown the importance of genetic background for susceptibility and resistance (Boon et al. 2009; Ferris et al. 2013; Leist et al. 2016; Srivastava et al. 2009; Trammell et al. 2012). In particular, the highly genetically diverse Collaborative Cross (CC) genetic reference population (GRP) represents an ideal tool to study phenotypic diversity which is caused by genotypic variations (Collaborative Cross Consortium 2012). The CC is derived from eight genetically diverse founder strains, which were intercrossed and then inbred to produce a reproducible population of recombinant inbred (RI) strains where each strain is a genetic mosaic of the original eight founder strains (Collaborative Cross Consortium 2012). Importantly, the CC strains exhibit more than 40 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms and many insertions, deletions, and structural variations, which is comparable to the genetic diversity in human populations (Collaborative Cross Consortium 2012). Furthermore, this diversity is evenly distributed across the genomes of the CC at the population level. In addition, the CC represents an ideal GRP for the mapping of quantitative traits to identify genetic variations that contribute to the host response to IV infections which may be highly relevant for severe course of IV infections in humans (Collaborative Cross Consortium 2012; van Sluijs et al. 2017).",

For respiratory infections, nasal swabs or blood is the most preferable source for diagnosis. For severe infections, blood is more preferable than nasal swabs since the critical infection is taking place in the lung. Therefore, almost all current human studies have analyzed the blood. On the other hand, almost all studies in mice investigate the infected organ (lung for IV) because they aim to understand the biological mechanisms at the site of infection. This raises an important caveat; comparisons between responses in IV-infected mouse lungs are of limited value to validate biomarkers that have been identified in human peripheral blood or vice versa.",

In this study, which has received a significant amount of attention in the media, the authors concluded that the changes in the transcriptome observed in human patients could not be replicated in mice. However, these conclusions have been challenged later (Takao and Miyakawa 2014). It is also very important to note that Seok et al. used only a single inbred mouse strain for their model, C57BL/6J, while the human samples came from patients with different genetic backgrounds (Seok et al. 2013). Therefore, to truly assess whether mouse models can be used to identify and validate biomarkers that are relevant to human infectious diseases, it will be important to carefully compare responses in the appropriate tissues, in this case the blood, while also accounting for the impact of host genetic variation. Furthermore, since these types of responses are likely to be specific for individual pathogens or classes of pathogens, it will also be important to extend this analysis to viral pathogens such as IV.",

ANOVA revealed a significant effect of strain and the interaction of strain and day (repeated measures using data from day 0 to day 5 when all mice from all strains were still alive, model: BW ~ strain \u00d7 day). Broad sense heritability was 62% for the day 5 BW values. Two strains, CC001 and CC005, were resistant to the infection: all infected mice survived (Fig. 1b). All other strains exhibited a severe phenotype (> 15% of infected mice died). We refer to these strains as \u2018severe\u2019 strains in this manuscript. Table 1 describes the CC strains, their susceptibility category, and group sizes used in our study.",

For this, we collected peripheral blood from infected CC mice at days 3, 5, and 8 pi and performed expression array studies. This experimental setting is very important for cross-species comparisons, since studies in humans mainly use peripheral blood, and we found that changes in transcriptomes were very different in lung and blood (Fig. S2, blood data are from this study, lung data are taken from Leist et al. 2016). For example, many more DEGs were observed in lung compared to blood which is most likely due to the fact that the lung is the primary organ of infection and that the cell composition is much more complex in lung (lung tissue plus immune cell infiltrates) than blood. In addition, mice that were mock infected with PBS served as controls, which allowed us to exclude the influence of the infection procedure at early time points after infection on gene expression changes (Preusse et al. 2013). This contrasts with human studies where patients are already symptomatic at the time of analysis in field studies.",

These data sets were chosen because they were publically available and each of them had a reasonably large group size of infected patients and controls (n \u2265 15 for each). GSE52428 represents a study with controlled infections of human volunteers and GSE68310 has analyzed the currently largest group of IV-infected patients (n > 45 depending on the day pi). Both data sets followed transcriptome changes over time with comparable times to our mouse data (day 2\u2013day 4.5 pi for GSE52428 and days 2, 5, and 8 pi for GSE68310). Furthermore, our own study (GSE82050) identified IFI27 as one of the most strongly up-regulated genes, and we suggested it as a marker for IV and other respiratory viral infections (Tang et al. 2017).",

Infected and control groups separated in the PCA in all human data sets (Fig. 2a, b, c) as well as for the mouse CC strains (Fig. 3a). However, there was considerable overlap between infected and control groups in all data sets. In addition, there was no clear distinction of groups according to their days pi/collection in any data set. In humans, the factors that may cause the overlap between infected and control groups are not known. They may represent differences in the host response because of vaccine status, infection dose, comorbidities, etc. However, also in the well-controlled mouse studies the overlap between infected and control groups was considerable. In the mouse data set, it was possible to stratify groups with respect to their genetic background. This stratification showed that different CC strains differ largely in their global transcriptome response to IV infections (Fig. 3b, c). For example, the resistant strain CC005 exhibited hardly any change in gene expression and the response was back to control levels at day 5 (Fig. 3b). On the other hand, the highly susceptible CC strain CC004 exhibited a very strong overall response to the infection (Fig. 3c). The PCA showed that day 3 and day 5 pi responses differ largely from baseline responses for this strain.",

For the mouse, we also combined the different days pi to a single infected group and mock-infected animals were used as controls. Since there were no severe cases (deaths) in humans, we performed two separate comparisons in CC mice\u2014between infected resistant strains and all controls and between infected severe strains and all controls. Differentially expressed genes (note that some genes are represented by multiple probe sets which were analyzed separately) were defined to exhibit > 1.5-fold difference in expression value (delta log2 > 0.585) between infected and controls and a false discovery rate (using BH for multiple testing correction) of FDR < 10%. Based on the outcome of the infections in mice, we distinguished resistant and severe strains (see above). Table 3 shows the number of differentially expressed probe sets for each pairwise comparison of infected versus controls. Detailed lists for all DEGs can be found in the supplementary data (Tables S5\u2013S10). In the human data sets, more down-regulated than up-regulated DEGs were found. This was the inverse for the mouse comparisons. Also in the mouse studies, many more DEGs were detected compared to humans.

Many of these overlapping DEGs belonged to the interferon pathway which is activated after viral infection. Each of the mouse and human data sets had a unique number of DEGs that was not shared with any other group. These unique genes are not enriched for any particular annotation across all data sets using the R package clusterProfiler (Yu et al. 2012), suggesting that these unique differences between cohorts are random. Only the CC and Tang_17 shared the annotations \u201cNeutrophil degranulation\u201d and \u201cAntigen processing-Cross presentation\u201d for the unique groups. Most remarkably, this set of unique DEGs in CC mice was not specifically higher compared to the human data sets (80% for CC (unique DEGs divided by total number of DEGs), 62% for Woods_13, 42% for Zhai_15, 81% for Tang_17 in Fig. 4a). Also, the overlap of DEGs between Tang_17 and CC mice (55 DEGs) was similarly large as the overlap between Tang_17 and Woods_13 (47 DEGs; Fig. 4a). Based on these results, we conclude that, at the global level, differences in the identification of DEGs between various human studies are mainly caused by differences between their designs (cohorts, time points pi, technical platforms, etc.) and not because of species differences. The overlaps observed for human DEGs between different studies were not higher than between mouse and human.",

Such biomarkers may be genes that change expression levels as a function of infection (yes/no), pathogen (viral/bacterial), or disease severity (moderate/severe). Therefore, we compared changes in the expression of individual genes between human and mouse to determine how well the mouse model mimics human responses at the single gene level. For this, we performed a comparative analysis of all 26 overlapping DEGs from Fig. 4b (Fig. 5-1 to -26). For the human data sets, we combined the indicated days pi to a single infected group as described above. For the mouse, we combined all resistant strains into a single group, and the severe strains to a second group. Mock-treated animals were used as controls.",

Similarly, all differences between mice with a severe phenotype and mock controls were significant. However, for some genes (Ly6e, Plscr1, Sat1, Serping1, Tap1), no significant difference between mice from the resistant group and controls were observed in the mouse studies, whereas differences between the severe group and controls were significantly different. These results demonstrate that at the single gene level, results from mouse and human are highly comparable. In addition, mouse studies revealed differences between strains that exhibited severe influenza disease versus resistant strains. The differences represent valuable candidates to validate in humans with severe versus moderate infection outcomes. Thus, the mouse is a well-suited model for human responses to IV infections at the transcriptome level when the same tissues (blood) in both species and genetically variant mouse populations are used.",

            "text": "A big advantage of controlled animal infection experiments is the possibility to study defined time points after infection in biological replicates, including individuals of the same sex, age, and genetic background. In human studies following natural infection, these variables are often not controlled and at best the time after onset of symptoms is recorded. The study by Woods et al. is an exception. This study analyzed the blood of infected volunteers from 5 to 165.5 h after infection. Thus, this is one of the very few well-controlled analyses with respect to different time points pi. In our analysis, we included only the time points until 108 h for this data set since the later time points had only samples from a single person. Also, we only analyzed symptomatic patients. The study by Zhai et al. recorded also the temporal change in gene expression. In this case, samples were collected from days 0 (first visit within 48 h of occurrence of symptoms) to 21 days after the first visit and also post-seasonal samples after complete recovery (\u2018spring\u2019). For the Zhai data set, we included all time points from the study. Please note that both human data sets are larger than the ones described above and in Table 1 since they contain additional time points. As an example, we performed an analysis of the kinetics of gene expression changes for genes IFI27 and IRF7 in humans and mice. IFI27, an interferon-regulated gene, had been proposed as potential marker to distinguish respiratory viral from bacterial infections (Tang et al. 2017). IFI27 was the top DEG in humans when contrasting expression levels in controls versus infected patients in all three human data sets (this study). IRF7, an interferon-regulating transcription factor, is an important host gene for the successful defense to IV infections. Mice with a knockout in this gene are more susceptible to IV infections (Hatesuer et al. 2017). IRF7 was significantly up-regulated in both human and mouse blood after infection (this study).",

In the Zhai data set, IFI27 expression increased from day 0 to day 2 and then declined on day 4 and day 6 (Fig. 6b). Expression levels were back to baseline levels on day 21 and post-seasonal (Fig. 6b). The differences in the timings between the two datasets are due to different definitions of the time post infections. Woods counts the actual time after infection, whereas Zhai designates the day when patients come into the clinic with symptoms as day 0. In mice, individual CC strains were analyzed and for this comparison, we calculated the mean difference at each day with respect to mock controls. The expression kinetic in the CC mice strains was very similar to that in humans. Expression of Ifi27 increased at day 3 pi and then declined on day 5 pi in most strains (Fig. 6c). However, individual differences for different strains could be observed. For example, CC001 still had high levels at day 8, whereas CC006 had lower levels already on day 3 and baseline levels on day 5. Also, other strains exhibited an increase in expression from day 3 to day 5. Visualization of individual expression values demonstrated that gene expression levels were highly reproducible within a given mouse strain and that the variation is not due to experimental variation (Fig. S3a). Of note, the baseline levels (mock-treated) were already different between CC mouse strains and profiles were different between strains although the general trends were identical (Fig. S3a). The results in the mouse model demonstrate again that genetic background is a major factor causing individual differences.",

This is further illustrated by that fact that in the United States there are approximately 200,000 IV-associated hospitalizations and 23,000 IV-associated deaths each year, with associated medical costs in excess of $10 billion dollars (Young-Xu et al. 2017). Therefore, given the large number of IV-associated hospitalizations and the significant health consequences of severe IV-associated disease, new methods are needed to rapidly assess an individual\u2019s prognosis so that appropriate treatment regimens can be initiated in a timely manner to ensure better clinical outcomes. Transcriptional or proteomic analysis of readily available clinical samples, such as peripheral blood, represents a promising avenue for identifying prognostic biomarkers that can be used to predict patient outcome during IV infection (Herberg et al. 2013; Huang et al. 2011; Ioannidis et al. 2012; Marion et al. 2016; Parnell et al. 2012; Ramilo et al. 2007; Suarez et al. 2015; Tang et al. 2017; Thach et al. 2005; Tsalik et al. 2016; Woods et al. 2013; Zaas et al. 2009; Zhai et al. 2015).

Our results clearly demonstrate that by comparing the appropriate tissue types (peripheral blood), and accounting for the impact of genetic variation on IV-associated gene expression through the use of genetically complex mouse panels, the bio-signatures identified in the mouse show good concordance with human studies.

            "text": "IV infection of inbred mouse strains represents one of the most commonly used systems for studying IV disease pathogenesis and identifying host factors associated with virus-induced disease outcome (Kollmus et al. 2014). This is due to a wide range of factors, including the reproducibility of standard inbred strains, such as C57BL/6 mice, the ability to study the role of specific genes in IV disease pathogenesis through gene knockout animals, and the availability of an extensive toolkit of reagents for quantifying immune and other host responses in the mouse. However, as noted above, mouse models have recently come under attack due to questions about whether the mouse can reproduce disease states and gene expression profiles observed in humans (Seok et al. 2013). While the studies of Seok et al. raise concerns about mouse models, it is important to note that their study did not account for the impact of genetic diversity on differential findings in mice and humans. Therefore, our finding that studying a population of genetically diverse mouse strains, such as the CC, results in IV-induced transcriptional signatures that better reproduce human biomarkers has important implications not just for IV but also the study of other pathogens. Similar to the CC founders (Ferris et al. 2013; Leist et al. 2016), CC mice exhibit a broad range of phenotypes following infection with other pathogens (Gralinski et al. 2015; Rasmussen et al. 2014) which suggests that using the CC to identify bio-signatures for other pathogens may also provide greater concordance with human studies than is seen with existing mouse models.",

Therefore, it will be important to directly compare the same tissues in mice and humans when performing marker validation studies.
