            "text": "Emodin (3-methyl-1,6,8-trihydroxyanthraquinone, Figure 1) is a naturally occurring anthraquinone derivative that is widely distributed in different plants (rhubarb, aloe), lichens and terristrial fungi, that has also been isolated from marine-derived fungi and marine sponge-associated fungi [1,2,3,4]. It is also an active ingredient in Chinese medicinal herbs used in the treatment of constipation, jaundice, gastro-intestinal hemorrhage, and ulcers. Emodin has the same tricyclic planar chromophore skeleton as certain anti-tumor antibiotics such as daunorubicin, doxorubicin, epirubicin, and several synthetic analogs distributed such as mitoxantrone and pixantrone (Figure 1); all of which are in used for clinical treatment of various cancers. Many reports have demonstrated that emodin possesses a wide spectrum of pharmacological effects such as anti-tumour [5,6,7], anti-inflammatory [8,9], antiviral [10], antibacterial [11], anti-allergic [12], anti-osteoporotic [13], anti-diabetic [14,15], immunosuppressive [16], neuroprotective [17], and hepatoprotective [18,19] activities, etc. Among these effects, anti-tumor activity is the most widely reported. In recent decades, pharmacological studies have shown that emodin is capable of inhibiting cellular proliferation [20], inducing of cell differentiation [21] and apoptosis [22], and activating of caspase cascade pathway [23,24] and mitochondrial death pathway [25,26] in different cancer cells.",

The bioavailability of a drug is positively correlated with its solubility; thus amino acids, which possess the carboxylic and amino functionality, are ideal as a moiety for the structural modification of bioactive natural products. Amino acids can interact with other biomolecules via secondary interactions such as hydrogen bonding to improve their pharmacological profiles in both potency and bioavailability [32]. For example, conjugation of an amino acid to betulinic acid is able to improve its water-solubility as well as its anti-melanoma activity [33]. These findings prompted us to design and synthesize a series of novel emodin derivatives linked with various amino acids as TFA salt (Figure 2).",

            "text": "To verify the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis induction of compound 7a, we performed a western blot assay. It is well known that the Bcl-2 family of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins regulates the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. These Bcl-2 family proteins stimulate the permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane, which results in the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol and in turn promotes the activation of the caspase cascade. The activation of the caspase cascade ultimately leads to the induction of apoptotic cell death. As shown in Figure 3C and 3D, in comparison with the control cells, compound 7a induced an increase in the levels of Bax and a decrease in the expression of Bcl-2 in a concentration-dependent manner. Meanwhile, the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria increased after the treatment of compound 7a, while procaspase 9 and procaspase 3 decreased after treatment with 7a, indicating that the caspase 9 and caspase 3 were activated. As shown in Figure 3E,F, the increased expression of cleaved caspase-3 after treatment with 7a provided a further evidence that compound 7a induced cell apoptosis through mitochondrial pathway in a concentration-dependent manner. The apoptosis process can be summarized as follows: The mitochondrial apoptosis-induced channel (MAC) of HepG2 cells was formed by pro-apoptotic protein Bax after the treatment of compound 7a. The formation of MAC led to the releasing of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Once cytochrome c was released, it binded with apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1) and ATP, which then binded to procaspase-9 to create a protein complex known as apoptosome. The apoptosome cleaved the pro-caspase-9 to its active form of initiator caspase-9, which in turn activated procaspase-3 and then the effector caspase-3 and finally resulted in cell apoptosis.",

Their in vitro anti-proliferation tests revealed that these derivatives exhibited moderate to potent anti-proliferative activity against HepG2 cells and MCF-7 cells. Among these compounds, the most potent compound, 7a, exhibited better selective anti-proliferative activity and specificity than emodin, displayed a significant effect in inducing cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase and inducing cell apoptosis in HepG2 cells via release of cytochrome c and subsequent activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, which revealed that the possible molecular mechanism of 7a apoptosis induction may mainly through the mitochondrial death pathway. Moreover, Compound 7a also resulted in inhibition of HepG2 cells migration in the wound healing assay. These preliminary molecular mechanism results suggest that compound 7a could be a promising lead compound for the development of novel antitumor drugs and has the potential for further investigations as an anti-cancer drug.",
