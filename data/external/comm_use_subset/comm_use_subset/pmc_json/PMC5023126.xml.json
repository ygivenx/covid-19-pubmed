            "text": "Multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (multiplex RT-PCR) combined with automated capillary electrophoresis has provided a platform for multi-target genome analysis. An example of this technology is the GenomeLab GeXP Genetic Analysis System (https://www.beckmancoulter.com/wsrportal/bibliography?docname=BR-11776A.pdf) developed by Beckman Coulter (Crea, CA, USA). The principle of the GeXP multiplex amplification assay (the GeXP-based assay) is that diverse genomic sequences are specifically amplified in one reaction, and the amplicons with different sizes labelled with fluorescence dye are then separated and distinguished by automated capillary electrophoresis. For multiplex PCR, two sets of primers are used: one set of forward and reverse primers that are chimeric (target primers) containing a target sequence and a universal tag at the 5\u2019-end. The other set of forward and reverse primers (universal primers) targeting the tag is fluorescence labeled. With the use of a significantly higher concentration of the universal primers than target primers in the reaction system, the target sequence is amplified with the chimeric primers in first few cycles, and then the amplification is overtaken by the universal primers, eventually generating amplicons containing target sequence and fluorescence-labeled tag [13]. Using the GeXP-based assay, Hu et al. was able to simultaneously genotype nine serotypes of enteroviruses [13]; Zhang et al. detected and differentiated 11 duck viruses in one reaction [14]; and Li et al simultaneously detected multiple human respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal aspirates from patients with pneumonitis or bronchopneumonia [15]. So far, the application of the GeXP assay to test larger clinical samples has rarely been reported. In this study, we used the GeXP-based assay for simultaneous detection of 20 types/subtypes of viruses in 1699 nasopharyngeal specimens collected from hospitalized children with CAP.",

Fifteen other microorganisms were chosen as control. The control panel consisted of cytomegalovirus, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Epstein-Barr virus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiellar pneumonia, Escherichia coli, measles virus, mumps virus, rubella virus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. All genomic nucleic acid in the target and control panels was obtained from Health Gene Technologies Co., Ltd. (Ningbo, China) and quantified using spectrophotometry.

So far, only a few reports have described the use of these techniques for pathogen detection in children with CAP [7, 11, 12]. Determination of viral etiology for pediatric CAP in larger clinical series has not been reported. In the present study, we applied multiplex RT-PCR together with automated capillary electrophoresis, namely the GeXP-based assay, to detect virus in 1699 nasopharyngeal specimens from hospitalized children with CAP. We showed that the GeXP-based assay had high sensitivity and specificity for simultaneous detection of multiple viruses, and about 65% of cases tested were positive for virus. We randomly chose 120 samples that had been tested by the GeXP-based assay, redo the mono-RT-PCR and found 97.5% diagnosis agreement between these 2 methods (data not shown, and mono-RT-PCR was run as the multiplex reactions but used only the chimeric and universal primers for the single target virus that was tested positive in the sample). Further analysis revealed that patients younger than 3 years had a significantly higher virus infection rate (positive rate) than those older than 3 years. Seasonal distribution analysis saw RSV as the most predominant in autumn and winter, while in spring and summer PIV3 and RSV were the most frequently identified with similar positive percentages.",

Chen et al measured antibodies in 1204 serum samples collected from CAP children and found only about 15% were positive for virus [19], in sharp contrast to our findings and others\u2019 [7, 11, 12]. This discrepancy is likely attributed to 1) that the antibody assay targeted only a few types of viruses, i.e., influenza A and B, parainfluenza 1, 2 and 3 and RSV [19]; and 2) that the antibody assay is less sensitive than PCR [7, 16]. Juven et al explored several methods, i.e., cell culture, viral antigen detection, antibody assay and RT-PCR to determine the etiology of CAP in 254 hospitalized children, and they discovered that 62% of the patients had viral infection with RSV (29%) and HRV (24%) being the most commonly detected [7]. Cantais tested 9 types of viruses, i.e., RSV, ADV, HMPV, HBoV, coronavirus, FluA, FluB, HRV and PIVs using the biplex commercially-available RT-PCR Kit in 85 children with CAP, and revealed that the viral infection was 62.4% [11]. Rhedin et al employed real time PCR to detect virus in nasopharyngeal aspirates from children aged \u22645 years with CAP, and reported that viruses were detected in 81% of the cases [12]. These data together with ours suggest that majority of pediatric CAP cases have virus infection, especially in younger patients.",

The assay covered a broad range of virus targets and a large size of samples were tested. Due to its automation and multiplex procedure, the GeXP-based assay is less laborious than mono-PCR. It also saves samples and avoids well-to-well and pipetting errors. In the present study, plasmid DNA was used as the internal control, which monitors only PCR but not the reverse transcription step. Interestingly, in a few published papers describing the GeXP-based multiplex assays internal controls were not employed [13\u201315]. We showed that genomic RNA from all RNA viruses in the target panel was successfully amplified by the GeXP-based assay (Fig 1A), indicating that reverse transcription is not a problem. However, we felt an RNA template should be used as the internal control in future work. Another limitation of this assay is that highly specialized laboratory equipment is needed, namely an automated capillary electrophoresis system. Many clinical laboratories do not have this equipment, and outsourcing the fragment analysis would greatly increase the turnaround time.",
