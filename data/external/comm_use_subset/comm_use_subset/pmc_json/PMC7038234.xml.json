Compounds (50 \u03bcM) that exerted a >90% inhibition against JEV were defined as prime candidates; based on this criterion, 23 compounds (2.22%) were selected. A screening to reconfirm the results was then carried out using these prime candidates over a broader concentration range (3.125 to 50 \u03bcM). Eight hit compounds (0.77%) were selected based on their concentration-dependent inhibitory effects and a cell viability of >80% (Fig. 2A and B). Among the 8 compounds, ouabain and digoxin were subjected to further investigation because of their high selective indexes (SI, which is defined as 50% cytotoxic concentration [CC50]/50% inhibitory concentration [IC50]) and similar mechanisms (namely, they are cardiac glycoside compounds and act as inhibitors of Na+/K+-ATPase) of >1,917 and >969.9, respectively.",

In this study, ouabain exhibited therapeutic effects on JEV infection in an adult mouse model by decreasing viral loads and alleviating pathological injuries in the brain, which significantly improved the survival rate of JEV-infected mice. We proposed two mechanisms that may contribute to the antiviral effects. First, ouabain may block JEV infection by inducing the cellular stress response. Ouabain treatment in mammalian cells causes the interaction between the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor and Na+/K+-ATPase to induce calcium oscillations and further activate calcium-dependent transcription factors, such as the NF-\u03baB and activator protein (27). Some evidence suggested that cardiac glycosides mediate inflammatory processes via the activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway and the Src/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (28, 29). These signaling pathways also cause the activation of NF-\u03baB. Many of the genes expressed were elicited by activation of NF-\u03baB, including innate immune response, growth, and differentiation, which stimulate an antiviral state that might block JEV infection in the end (30). Second, JEV could replicate in the central nervous system (CNS), and infections result in the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) along with an influx of inflammatory cells; the breakdown of BBB caused by JEV infection may have allowed BBB-nonpermissive ouabain to enter the brain, bind the murine ATPase \u03b12 and \u03b13 isoforms (31), and inhibit viral replication in neurons.",

As shown in Fig. 1A, Vero cells were dissociated and seeded at a density of 1 \u00d7 104 cells per well in 96-well plates. After overnight incubation, cell monolayers were treated in duplicate with the compounds at a final concentration of 50 \u03bcM for 1 h and infected with the JEV strain AT31 at an MOI of 0.8. After 1 h infection, the supernatant was replaced with a fresh medium, and compounds were added to the same wells. After an additional 23 h of incubation, infection was stopped by rinsing each well once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixing the cells with 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were permeabilized using PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 15 min and blocked with 5% FBS (Gibco), followed by treatment with the primary antibody anti-JEV prM (full-length prM was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells using pET30a expression vectors, and purified protein was injected into rabbits to prepare polyclonal antibodies) overnight at 4\u00b0C. After six rinses with PBS, the cells were stained with DyLight 488-labeled antibody to rabbit IgG (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). Nuclei were counterstained by DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). Nine fields per well were imaged on an Operetta high-content imaging system (PerkinElmer), and the percentages of infected and DAPI-positive cells were calculated using the associated Harmony 3.5 software.",
