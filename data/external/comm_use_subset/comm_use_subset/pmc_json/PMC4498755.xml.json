In addition, COA confirmed rabies in a house shrew on July 30 and in a dog bitten by a rabid ferret-badger on September 10 [11].

Rabies surveillance mandates physicians to notify clinically suspected cases to the health authority within 24 hours of diagnosis and submit clinical specimens including saliva, serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to TCDC laboratories. Rabies is confirmed if any of the specimens tested positive for rabies virus by diagnostic RT-PCR targeting both L and N genes of Rabies virus [16]. PCR products were sequenced in both directions to characterize the rabies amplicon. In addition, specific anti-rabies antibody testing by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [17] was performed in unvaccinated individuals. In addition, TCDC has conducted sentinel surveillance of human encephalitis of undetermined etiology since 2010. Physicians from 46 sentinel hospitals were requested to submit serum, throat swabs and CSF from patients with either encephalopathy or ataxia of unknown etiologies, plus any one of the following: fever, seizure, focal neurological signs, abnormal CSF profile, abnormal electroencephalography (EEG) and brain images. Submitted specimens were tested for viruses using a multiplex PCR panel containing probes targeting viruses causing encephalitis. Retrospective testing to detect rabies virus was conducted on stored CSF taken during January 1, 2010 to July 15, 2013, by rabies RT-PCR. The multiplex real-time PCR detected the following pathogens using primers designed based on previously published sequences: Herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 [18], VZV [18], CMV [18], Human Herpesvirus 6 and 7 [18], Hendra virus [19], Nipah virus [20], Dengue virus [21], chikungunya virus [22], Japanese encephalitis virus [23], West Nile virus [23], adenovirus [24], bocavirus [24], coronavirus (229E, HKU1, OC43 and NL63) [25], enterovirus [24], human metapneumovirus [26], human parechovirus [27], influenza virus (types A [28] and B[29]), parainfluenza virus (types 1\u20133, 4A and 4B) [24] [25], parvovirus B19 [30], polyomavirus (JC and BK) [31], respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [29] and rhinovirus [24].",

Physicians must indicate biting animals, whether the animal was wild or owned, bite site on body of the bitten, bite category, according to WHO classification, circumstances of the incident, and the disposition of the animal that bit. Medical officers in TCDC would then review the application, and decide on whether to approve the application for PEP. Approval to provide treatment is given by phone within 30 minutes. After one month, as physicians have become familiar with rabies PEP recommendations, physicians were asked to provide rabies PEP immediately, and have their requests reviews retrospectively, to ensure that all patients needing rabies PEP were given appropriate PEP.",

Prior to confirming Taiwan as a rabies endemic country, few vaccines and RIGs were required countrywide. Therefore, all vaccines and RIGs were procured by TCDC, and then distributed to hospitals as needed. Having the experience of centralized procurement and supply of rabies PEP meant that the emergent procurement process could be pushed forward without having to seek new pharmaceutical firm collaboration, and that TCDC and hospitals already have set standard operating procedure for the distribution of these supplies. Through rapid mobilization of government fund and prompt procurement, TCDC guaranteed the availability of PEP to all who requires vaccines and RIG following animal bites. However, rabies prevention through PEP is costly. A course of vaccination and RIG costs more than USD800, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that it costs USD10,000 to 100 million for each life saved [37]. Intradermal vaccination protocol has been endorsed by WHO to reduce vaccine use. This protocol has not been endorsed by the national health authorities because intradermal administration of vaccines requires additional training of healthcare personnel, and is not available in all vaccine administration sites. In addition, the vaccine, once opened, must be used up within a few hours, and Taiwan does not have the volume of patients that make intradermal administration cost-saving. Therefore, intradermal PEP protocols were not adopted in Taiwan. The government-funded PEP program has become a financial burden on public funding and sustainability should be taken into account in long-term preparedness plans. As of January 1, 2014, rabies PEP is being offered free of charge through Taiwan\u2019s National Health Insurance scheme, ensuring the sustainable medical care to bite patients, ending the role played by TCDC during the first six month of the animal rabies epidemic.",

The subsequent panic-driven vaccine-seeking behavior from the public was expected. Because physicians in Taiwan had not been educated about the use of rabies PEP, blanket ACIP recommendation to cover all rodent and shrew bites were unavoidable, even though this is contrary to WHO recommendation. In the ensuing months, physicians treating animal bites must be educated to evaluate bites more thoroughly, and provide vaccines to those who truly require vaccination and RIG. Increased postexposure vaccine-seeking behavior and increased physician delivery of vaccines have been shown to be associated with episodic importation of rabies by Lardon, et al [39]. Media alerts regarding the presence of rabies in the community is shown to be associated with enhanced sense of risk. Following the peak of vaccine-seeking behavior in the wake of the media attention on rabies in Taiwan, PEP use decreased. The reason for the decrease of PEP use in the last two months of our surveillance period is currently unknown. This may have been the result of increased physician awareness of the rabies transmission risk among different animals, decreased medical seeking behavior among patients with animal bites without media stimulation, decreased risky behavior leading to animal bites through public education, or a combination of these causes. High risk personnel receiving PrEP has been advised before rabies was identified in animal population, but uptake of vaccine was low, with approximately 250 doses administered annually. The low uptake is suspected to be because PrEP must be paid by individual patient, while PEP was provided free of charge. With animal rabies reemergence in Taiwan, there is increased perceived risk of illness, thus increased PrEP uptake.",

Mass canine vaccination and population control is paramount to minimizing the risk transmission of rabies to humans [40]. Following the identification of rabies among ferret-badgers, the Taiwan Council of Agriculture began expanded efforts to provide free rabies vaccination to all owned dogs and cats, especially in rural areas. Stray dogs and cats were also vaccinated and tagged to prevent rabies among animals with frequent human contact. In addition, pets were banned from entering national parks and forested areas where ferret-badgers are known to inhabit, to prevent rabies transmission from ferret-badger to pets. According to a press release from the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine, Taiwan Council of Agriculture, by March 2014, the 93% of the dogs and cats in areas with rabid ferret-badgers identified were vaccinated, and 79% in areas with ferret-badger activities were vaccinated, and 63% in all other areas were vaccinated [41]. However, on December 29, 2014, a sick civet found in southern Taiwan tested positive for rabies in the same lineage as the rabies virus group from ferret-badger in Taitung [42\u201344]. Because, to date, only one civet out of the 215 civets tested in 2013 has been found to have rabies [45], it is not yet known if this represent spillover disease from ferret-badger or the virus is now established in the civet population in Taiwan.",

The true incidence of animal bites is likely to be much higher than currently reported. In addition, PCR testing of CSF is not sensitive for detecting rabies infection [46]. Current strategy in reporting patients with encephalitis of unknown etiologies may also not be sensitive in selecting patients with furious rabies. A more sensitive strategy may be needed to increase the sensitivity of identifying unrecognized human rabies. Because sentinel hospitals submitting specimens for encephalitis of unknown etiology are not geographically representative of Taiwan, human rabies cases may also not have been detected as a result. To ameliorate geographic misrepresentation, on October 28, 2013, TCDC has requested that all hospitals to submit CSF and saliva specimens for rabies testing, if patients have encephalitides of unidentified etiology requiring intensive care or resulting in death. Starting November 2013, rabies virus has been added to the multiplex PCR panel to identify encephalitides of unknown cause.",
