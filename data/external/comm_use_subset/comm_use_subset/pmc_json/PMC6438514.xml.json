Its prevalence in children and infants requiring hospitalization worldwide reaches 4\u201325% [6,7]. Moreover, serological studies showed that ~70% of children are seropositive at the age of five [8]. Symptoms associated with the infection are usually mild (e.g., cough, subfebrile temperature), but more severe disease also occurs (e.g., bronchitis, pneumonia) [9,10].",

Previous studies have shown that natural polysaccharides containing sulfonate groups efficiently inhibit infections caused by viruses employing HS during cell entry [12\u201319] and it was proposed that carrageenans inhibit the attachment of the hMPV to HS by interacting with the F protein [19]. It is, however, worth to mention that replication of some HS independent viruses is also hampered in the presence of these polymers [20\u201323].

At 1000 \u03bcg/ml no inhibition of early steps of virus infection was noted for carrageenans or NSPAHs (first four functional assays, S4\u2013S7 Figs), but we observed strong inhibition of progeny virus production in assay 5, wherein the inhibitors were added 2 h after the inoculation. All tested compounds inhibited hMPV progeny virus production, as illustrated by decreased virus yields and titers (p < 0.05). RT-qPCR analysis indicated that the inhibition is the most profound (ca. 3 log units) for \u03b9-car and NSPAH-15-94 (Fig 5, black bars; S2 Fig). Titration of supernatants revealed that all compounds inhibited production of hMPV infectious virions by ca. 2 log units (Fig 5, grey bars; S2 Fig). Obtained results suggest that tested polymers hamper late stages of virus replication cycle, after the virus enters the cell. To further investigate the mechanism, supernatants from infected cultures were discarded and cells were lysed by three freeze and thaw cycles (titration) or with lysis buffer (RNA isolation). Surprisingly, RT-qPCR analysis revealed only minor inhibition (p < 0.05) of viral RNA replication by carrageenans and no inhibitory activity for NSPAHs (Fig 6, black bars; S3 Fig). This is consistent with our previous results on the influenza virus [26]. In the case of titration, we observed slight but significant increase in the infectivity of the samples in case of \u03b9-car and NSPAH-65-96. NSPAH-15-94 also increase the infectivity of cell lysates, however, this increase was statistically non-significant (Fig 6, grey bars; S2 Fig). This indicates that hMPV virions correctly progress to the budding stage, but in the presence of the polymers they remain cell-associated. Altogether, obtained data indicate that NSPAHs do not affect virus replication per se, but lock them on cells and limit their spread to the neighboring cells.",

This virus efficiently replicates in LLC-MK2 cells but is released from the cell in a different mechanism. In contrast to hMPV and influenza A viruses, which bud from the cell surface, HCoV-NL63 buds from the Golgi apparatus and mature infectious viral particles are transported via exocytosis to the cell surface [32]. None of the tested polymers inhibited HCoV-NL63 (Fig 7; S9 Fig). This observation suggests that the polymers block virus release from the cell surface, e.g., by modification of membrane plasticity or anchoring the progeny virions to the cell. One may also consider that the difference in NSPAHs activity between hMPV and HCoV-NL63 results from different requirements for the HSPGs presence, but it would not explain strong inhibitory effect of NSPAHs against the influenza virus. Moreover, HCoV-NL63 was also shown to employ HSPGs during the entry to the cell [33].",
