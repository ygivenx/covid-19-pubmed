Infections with Newcastle disease virus (paramyxovirus-1) can cause morbidity and mortality in the flightless cormorant, brown pelican, Galapagos penguin, lava gull, Galapagos finches, mockingbirds, and Galapagos pintail [1,2]. In addition, Mycoplasma gallisepticum infections can cause morbidity and population declines in Darwin\u2019s finches, mockingbirds, Galapagos doves, dark-billed cuckoos, and yellow warblers [1,2]. The use of vaccines in day-old chicks shipped to the Galapagos and after arrival is prohibited. This policy requires high biosecurity standards to mitigate risk of disease transmission between broilers, backyard chickens, and wild birds on the archipelago.",

During 2001\u20132003, a study conducted on San Cristobal Island produced evidence of prior exposure to several pathogens in 72 broilers including: (i) infectious bursal disease virus, (42%); (ii) infectious bronchitis virus (46%); (iii) Newcastle disease virus (22%); and (iv) M. gallisepticum (7%) [1]. In 2005, a study on Santa Cruz Island revealed that the burden of previous exposure to these four pathogens in 88 broilers varied from 3% to 73% [2]. In both studies, indirect contact with infected backyard chickens or vaccination (although illegal) were suspected as potential risk factors associated with broilers demonstrating positive antibody titers to investigated pathogens. Finally, the study on San Cristobal did not test broilers for intestinal parasites [1], and the study on Santa Cruz did not find evidence of exposure to intestinal parasites in study broilers [2]. To our knowledge, no other studies have investigated or confirmed the burden of exposure to pathogens in broilers on San Cristobal and Santa Cruz since 2003 and 2005, respectively.",

An important mandate of the ABG is to regulate, control and prevent the introduction and dissemination of introduced species that represent a hazard to Galapagos native species and their habitat. An issue of concern is diseases in poultry that represent a health hazard to poultry, people, and wild birds on the archipelago. The objective of the study reported here was to produce new baseline data on the burden of exposure to infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), M. gallisepticum (MG) and intestinal parasites in a sample of introduced broilers on 13 farms on Santa Cruz Island and San Cristobal Island, Galapagos in July 2017. This information is important to support current ABG science-based policymaking efforts aimed at reducing the burden of diseases in broilers that can spill over to wild birds on the Galapagos.",

Based on a current law and regulations for control of introduced species on the Galapagos (Libro VII del Regimen Especial: Galapagos, Cap\u00edtulo III, Art\u00edculo 6 http://bioseguridadgalapagos.gob.ec/lista-de-productos-2/) the use of vaccines (e.g., against IBDV, IBV, NDV) in one-day-old chicks shipped to Galapagos, and after arrival, is prohibited. Local authorities do not approve the use of poultry vaccines because poultry are not native island species, and because the use of vaccines in introduced species requires vaccination guidelines supported by a risk assessment that must be approved by local authorities. Chicks are transported by commercial air carriers from Guayaquil to Baltra Island (then crossed by a small ferry to Santa Cruz Island and after by land transportation to the farm) or to San Cristobal.",

For example: (i) use of health records to monitor morbidity and mortality events in broilers; (ii) use of written biosecurity protocols; (iii) use of peripheral fence to keep backyard chickens or other animals out; (iv) poultry pens protected against rodents or native birds; and (v) proper disposal of broiler pen bedding material.",

The local business environment justifies the implementation of enhanced surveillance and biosecurity measures identified above.",
