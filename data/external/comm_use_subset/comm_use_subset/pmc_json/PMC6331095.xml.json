Viral pathogens are a very diverse group with recognized species responsible for both gastroenteritis [1], respiratory tract infections [2], hepatitis [3], cancer [4], and numerous other syndromes collectively killing millions each year [5\u20137]. In addition, an increasing number of re-emerging viruses have been reported, including ebola virus (EboV) [8], SARS [9], MERS [10] and Zika virus [11], causing large and serious epidemics. Effective surveillance systems are critical for outbreak detection and corresponding timely implementation of public health interventions. Additionally, as international trade and travel increases, the need for global surveillance is growing, as viruses do not respect national borders [12,13]. Several transnational pathogen specific viral surveillance networks exist, including NoroNet (http://www.rivm.nl/en/Topics/N/NoroNet) and GISRS [14], covering noroviruses and influenza viruses, respectively. However, the surveillance of the vast majority of viral human pathogens is being organized at a regional or national level, with limited data sharing and cooperation. In addition, many developing countries do not have the infrastructure of doctors, reference laboratories, and health care bodies required for traditional pathogen surveillance, creating large black boxes on the global health map [15].",

Environmental surveillance has been used as a tool for monitoring the spread of polio for more than 50 years [20], and combined with high throughput metagenomic sequencing could be an attractive and cost effective surveillance strategy for viral pathogens [21]. Metagenomics is an unbiased detection technique allowing for both the detection of known pathogens as well as the discovery of novel viruses [22,23]. However, significant logistic challenges exist for implementing global environmental sampling and metagenomic analysis in a timeframe relevant for producing actionable information.",

In addition, a negative library control was included using sterile molecular grade H2O. The libraries were then enriched for viral sequences using a custom SeqCap EZ probe library designed and synthesized by Roche Nimblegen (CA, USA). The probes were constructed from a reference list consisting of 2,339 viral sequences and genomes from viruses infecting vertebrates downloaded from Genbank in 2014 [28]. The capture reaction was done according to protocol except for the 2 x dilution of Hybridization component A, which allowed for a less stringent hybridization between sample DNA fragments and the viral capture probes, increasing the probe selectivity range [29]. Four to five Nextera libraries were pooled and run together in one capture reaction. After capture, the libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 producing 100 bp single-end reads.",

Briefly, the quality assurance was done using Cutadapt [30], trimming reads with a Phred score below 20, removing adaptors and subsequent discarding reads shorter than 50 bp. Read assignment was done using the read-alignment software MGmapper (https://cge.cbs.dtu.dk/services/MGmapper/), which is based on the BWA-MEM algorithm run with default settings (ver. 0.7.7-r441) [31,32]. Reads were mapped to a series of freely available reference databases, covering viruses, bacteria and eukaryotes (S1 Table). Reads were mapped in best-mode, meaning that mapping was performed against all databases simultaneously, and later for each read the best hit among all alignments was chosen. A read was considered as a hit only if the alignment score (AS) was above 30 and was higher than the score from the second best alignment (XS). Throughout the mapping approach, only the most reliable hits were accepted i.e. reads were accepted provided that each read maps with an alignment length being at least 70% of the read length. As the single read mapping approach can be unspecific in cases where homologues regions are shared between database entries, virus hits were conservatively reported on the species level, to reduce the chance of misclassification. The raw Illumina sequences are publicly available at the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB30546).",

As the data were not normally distributed, the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used to test for significant differences between the three regions.

Viral capture probes have previously been showed to increase the number of viral reads of up to 3 orders of magnitude [59], and by lowering the stringency of the probe hybridization, as was done in this study, viral sequences not included in the probe design can also be detected [29]. However, most viruses are still undiscovered and not present in current databases [60], and thus not included in the SeqCap probe design, which limits our analysis to only known and already sequenced viruses. Furthermore, the use of capture probes also increases the length of the sample processing with several days, and physical viral enrichment using filters and nucleases might be a faster and more appropriate alternative for real time surveillance [27]. As we use toilet waste in this protocol, we are limited to detecting viruses excreted in the feces or urine, missing important respiratory viruses such as influenza viruses. However, viral shedding in feces has been detected in emerging viral pathogens such as severe acute respiratory coronavirus (SARS-Cov) and ebola virus [61,62], suggesting that they may be possible targets of our protocol. Finally, environmental metagenomic studies, such as this one, with low abundances of target organisms and corresponding low read counts, are very vulnerable to read misclassifications [42]. This was also identified in this study, due to the inclusion of both positive and negative extraction controls. However, our method does not guarantee that no other cases of misclassification exist in our dataset and interpretations should therefore take this into account. One possible example is the presence of the veterinary porcine picobirnavirus in all of our airplane sewage samples, which based on the nature of our samples, is possibly a human strain with no representative in the viral databases. Porcine and human picobirnaviruses can be almost identical and require targeted approaches to discriminate [63]. Alternatively, the detected picobirnavirus could actually be a phage, as has been suggested in two recent publications based on the enrichment of functional prokaryotic ribosome binding sites in picobirnavirus genomes [64,65]. Assembly based bioinformatic methods have the potential to reduce the misclassification problem, increasing the specificity of viral assignment, but the low number of viral reads in our samples in combination with a focus on speed made this option unfeasible. However, assembly based assignment should be pursued in further studies of viral surveillance in environmental samples. As we used a reference based approach our results are also limited by the current state of viral sequence databases, including only a small part of the viral diversity.",

            "text": "In conclusion, our protocol was able to detect and quantify enteric, respiratory, and latent viruses in toilet waste from 19 international flights arriving in Copenhagen Airport using metagenomics. Several viruses were found in significantly higher quantities in samples arriving from South Asia, including salivirus A, aichivirus A and enterovirus B, and the samples from this region had a higher viral species richness. In addition, planes from certain cities were identified as having high amounts of rotaviruses and NoVs in samples taken months apart. However, an increase in sensitivity and specificity is needed before our approach can be implemented by public health professionals, which could be overcome by further development in nucleotide extraction and bioinformatics analysis. With improvements, surveillance of viral particles in airplane toilet waste using metagenomics could be a valuable addition to current surveillance efforts, producing global comparable surveillance data relevant for outbreak detection and implementation of public health interventions.",
