The SIV H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes have been circulating for more than 30 years, and the SIV subtype H1N2 has been circulating since it was first isolated in Great Britain in 1994 [2, 3]. In April 2009, a new influenza A virus of subtype H1N1 emerged in the human population in Mexico and the United States. This was a multiple reassortant virus containing genes from North American and Eurasian lineages [4, 5]. The virus spread rapidly across the world by human-to-human transmission. Human-to-pig transmission was first reported in Canada in late April 2009, then in European pig population in early September 2009, and has since been reported in several countries all over the world [6\u20139]. In October 2009, SIV was reported for the first time in Norway when an integrated pig herd tested positive for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus after showing mild clinical signs of respiratory disease [10].",

Studies have shown that immunological na\u00efve pigs experimentally infected with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus could transmit the virus efficiently to other na\u00efve pigs [11, 14, 15]. Although pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus contains gene segment genetically related to other swine influenza virus strains circulating in Europe and North America, it shows antigenetic differences in the major glycoproteins of the virus [4]. However, it has been shown that pigs infected or vaccinated with H1N1 European avian-like swine influenza virus could produce cross-reactive antibodies against pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus which protected pigs against the infection of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus [13, 16].",

The Norwegian Food Safety Authority has been running annual surveillance programs to document the status since 1994. SIV was added to the program in 1997. Under the surveillance, blood samples from about 500 randomly selected herds are collected annually for specific disease surveillance [17]. The surveillance has never detected SIV infection in Norway until October 2009, except for pigs in one herd that tested seropositive for subtype H3N2 in 1998 without showing clinical signs or further spread of the infection.",

In herds suspected to have an active infection, nasal swabs were collected from 20 pigs at different ages, with priority of sampling pigs with clinical symptoms. In herds without clinical signs, blood samples were collected from at least 20 pigs (sows or slaughtered pigs) for serological testing. Calculation of sample size was done assuming 100% test sensitivity and a within-herd prevalence >15%. The sample size implies that the risk of having 20 nonreactors from a positive farm is less than 4%.",

A herd was considered seropositive if three or more blood samples from the herd were positive for influenza-A-specific NP antibodies. In case one or two of the 20 blood samples from a herd were ELISA positive, the herd was retested with samples from another 20 pigs, and the herd concluded positive if at least one of these samples was seropositive.

By the end of 2009, a total of 91 herds had tested positive for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus and/or antibodies against the virus.

It was followed by a first minor wave of infected people during the Summer and a second major wave in the Autumn. Shortly after the onset of the Autumn wave, the first pig herd positive for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus was detected. Most Norwegian pig herds are small and family run. Hence, the farmer and family members must care for the pigs even when being ill. Many of the first positive pig herds had been in contact with people that were confirmed with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection or people with ILI [10]. Herd-to-herd transmission was ruled out because there was no history of contact between herds that were positive for the virus or were seropositive. It is also known that many people could be infected with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 without showing clinical symptoms. This suggests that infected humans, with or without clinical symptoms, were an important factor in the introduction and transmission of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus to the Norwegian pig population. Sequencing analysis of virus isolated from humans and from pigs indicated that almost identical viruses had infected both species [10]. Furthermore, the high prevalence in nucleus and multiplying herds, that normally have no or few contacts with other herds, indicates that humans, and not trade with pigs, were responsible for introduction of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus to Norwegian pigs.",

The results also show that in areas with high pig density, a high proportion of the herds were seropositive. This suggests virus transmission between pig herds, either by movement of pigs and people visiting infected herds. However, air transmission cannot be excluded [25]. The farm size and density of pigs in the area around the farm have been suggested to be important risk factors for influenza-seropositive farms [26]. Experimental studies have shown that pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus is efficiently transmitted between pigs [11, 14, 15].

Although one multiplier herd was tested seropositive in 1998 for antibodies against influenza A H3N2 virus, follow-up studies for many years in this herd did not reveal new seropositive pigs, nor any spread of the virus in contact herds. Based on this, it was concluded that the pigs in this herd had probably been infected by a human-adapted H3N2 virus that did not have the capacity to be transmitted further between pigs [17]. Since the Norwegian pig population has been free of SIV, there are no cross-reactive antibodies to pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus or any of the other SIV subtypes. This has probably contributed to the high prevalence of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus in the Norwegian pig population. It has been shown that European pigs naturally infected or vaccinated with European SIVs have cross-reactive hemagglutinating antibodies against pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus [15, 16]. Moreover, natural infection with influenza virus stimulates mucosal immunity and cellular immune responses, responses that give partial protection against infection with an antigenetically unrelated strain [27, 28]. Surveillance of SIV in Europe prior to the emergence of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus showed that the three SIV subtypes \u2018\u2018avian-like\u201d H1N1, \u2018\u2018human-like\u201d H3N2, and \u2018\u2018human-like\u201d H1N2 were most often found in animals between 3- and 6 months old [29]. It should be noted that Norway is carrying out surveillance for SIV, including 4500\u20135000 samples from between 450 and 500 herds per year.",

For example, in Australia, pigs naturally infected with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus only showed mild clinical signs. It was suggested that a lower infection pressure in natural infection as compared to experimental infection, as well as absence of other respiratory pathogens, could result in milder clinical signs [12]. In Norway, only a few pigs showed clinical signs like coughing, fever, and loss of appetite which are typical for SIV [3]. As Norway is free from most other viral respiratory diseases, presence of clinical signs like coughing would alert farmers who would notify their veterinarian or the authorities.",

The results show that there was no seroconversion in pigs born at least two months after the virus was first detected, indicating that there was no ongoing infection in the herds. A possible explanation may be that the Norwegian pig herds are small, and many herds practice batch farrowing of three, five and a half, or seven weeks intervals, with strict sectioning of the herds with all-in all-out system. However, results from the surveillance in 2011 show that some pigs born in 2010/2011 are seropositive, indicating an ongoing spread of the infection. It is not clear to what extent this is caused by new introduction from humans or continued virus circulation between susceptible pigs since 2009. Continuing surveillance is important to show whether the virus has become enzootic in the Norwegian pig population.",

As long as Norway is free of other SIV subtypes, the risk of novel reassortant viruses spreading among pigs is low. However, reassortant viruses evolving in humans might be a risk for the Norwegian pig population. It is therefore important to continue the surveillance of SIV and genetic characterization of positive samples. Given the potential long-term presence of influenza virus in Norwegian pigs, it is also interesting to evaluate the economic impact of this disease and assess the cost effectiveness of new biosecurity measures or change in husbandry practices.",
