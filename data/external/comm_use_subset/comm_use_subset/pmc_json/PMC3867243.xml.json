            "text": "Inflammatory bowel disease is a common disease among urban populations [1\u20134]. Drugs prescribed for the treatment of this disease manifest a large number of side effects. A localised delivery is therefore suitable for the treatment of this disease. The development of polymer-based microspheres, microcapsules, and microbeads are currently the focused area of research for intestinally targeted drug delivery [5]. This also prevents a sudden unwanted higher concentration of the drug in the tissue and maintains controlled release of the drug at the target site. Polysaccharides are mainly used in the design of oral drug delivery devices. The increased adhesion of particles in the thick mucosal zones of inflammation or ulceration is an effective physiological parameter that can be exploited for targeted delivery of the drug encapsulated in the microcarriers [5, 6]. In inflammatory bowel disease, microparticulate drug carriers are expected to accumulate at the sites of inflammation in the colon. Due to effective adhesion to colonic mucosa, these carriers will have enough time to deliver their drug load to the sites of inflammation in the colon. Guar gum obtained from guar flour is a polysaccharide commonly used for designing colon-targeted drug delivery devices [7, 8]. Guar gum is metabolised by the colonic microflora that releases its contents specifically to the colon. A newer amine derivative of guar gum has been synthesised from commercially available guar gum. The derivative retains the biological properties of the mother polysaccharide and shows additional properties of the amine group. This makes the polymer positively charged. In our study, this newly synthesised derivative was utilized for the preparation of microparticles. Preparation of guar gum microparticles by the ionic gelation technique using metal ions and glutaraldehyde has been reported earlier [9\u201311]. In our current study, we used sodium tripolyphosphate as the crosslinker with guar gum alkyl amine.",

The entrapment efficiency and in vitro drug release were studied in simulated gastric, intestinal, and colonic fluids containing rat cecal contents. The drug-polymer ratio was optimized using a 32 factorial design model. The in vivo efficacy of the microparticles was studied in a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced rat model of colitis.

The void control group was kept in order to study the possible effect of the delivery device itself. The ameliorative efficacy of the GAM was studied by comparing the results with the GA treated groups. Intra-colonic administration of TNBS in 50% ethanol resulted in an inflammatory response characterized by extensive mucosal disruption, linear and deep ulcers, haemorrhage, and sub-mucosal oedema (Fig. 12).

The visual severity of colitis presented minimum damage of colonic mucosa in case of GAM treated animals compared with GA treated group (Fig. 12). Excessive accumulation of inflammatory cells mainly neutrophils was observed at the sites of inflammation in TNBS control group and an increased tissue myeloperoxidase [29] was thus observed. In case of GAM group, the MPO activity in the colonic tissue was found to be the minimum, indicating lesser inflammation and better healing of colitis [36, 37]. The histological examination of the colonic tissue (Fig. 13) presented least accumulation of inflammatory cells in colonic tissue of GAM treated animals [38, 39].
