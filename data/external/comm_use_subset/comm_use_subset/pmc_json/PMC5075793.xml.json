In various parametric models, the 95th percentiles were in the range 10\u201314 days, which is consistent with the currently used case definitions6. While it is difficult to estimate the right hand tail of the incubation period distribution based on small sample sizes, we estimated the 99th percentile could be as long as 14\u201322 days and this indicates that long incubation periods are possible. In South Korea, one of the 186 cases was reported to have an incubation period of 21 days or longer, although it has been suggested that immunosuppression in that person could potentially have delayed the onset of symptoms15.",

            "text": "We found a significant difference in mean incubation periods between the cases in South Korea and in Saudi Arabia (Table 3). This difference could be related to the transmission dynamics of MERS-CoV infection with only secondary cases and longer transmission chains in the outbreak in South Korea9, compared with cases in Saudi Arabia included in this study where a majority (74%) came from the same hospital8 where it has already been shown that the transmission chain was shorter with multiple separate animal-to-human infections1617. Potential direct transmission could be related to a higher infecting dose and higher virulence of the strain that could lead to a shorter incubation period18. A recent studies on MERS-CoV transmission during the outbreak in South Korea reported different estimates of the incubation period depending on the intensity of exposure and/or inoculation route19. Indeed, the authors showed that the incubation period was significantly shorter among patients that were exposed to the index case in the same zone of the emergency room (median: 5 days; interquartile range (IQR): 4\u20138 days) compared with patients from different zones (median: 11 days; IQR: 6\u201312 days). These results strengthen the hypothesis that a higher infecting dose could have been transmitted by the index case leading to a shorter incubation period compared with cases associated with \u201cindirect\u201d transmission that may have been responsible for transmission in different zones of the emergency room. Further investigation on human-to-human and human-to-animal transmission dynamics would improve our understanding of the potential role of the exposure route on the incubation period. It is also possible that this difference is an artifact of different approaches to data collection or reporting in South Korea and in Saudi Arabia.",

First, we did not have access to original patient records, and our data on MERS-CoV infections in South Korea were based on publicly available information while we relied on published data for a relatively small number of cases in Saudi Arabia. There is a potential concern that symptoms and symptom onset dates might be reported differentially in the two locations. In the cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by Assiri et al. from Saudi Arabia, 20/23 cases had fever on the day of symptom onset11. In the outbreak in South Korea, fever was part of the case definition and symptom onset may reflect the date of onset of fever rather than other symptoms2021. Secondly, regarding patients from Saudi Arabia, only 34 patients among the 1,456 patients (2%) diagnosed with MERS-CoV infection since 2012 in Saudi Arabia had publicly-available exposure data and most of these patients (25/34, 73%) came from the same hospital8. However, a larger proportion of patients from the outbreak in South Korea (N = 115; 63%) had publicly-available exposure data. Third, the outbreak in South Korea occurred 2 years after the first officially announced case of MERS-CoV infection in Saudi Arabia during which time the virus may have evolved somewhat, including changes in the transmission and pathogenesis characteristics. Fourth, no information about inoculation route was available for the patients included in this study as the data were retrieved from publicly available data or published studies.",

These interval-censored data are a special type of survival data, and it is possible to \u201creverse\u201d the time axis considering Sk as the origin and Xk as the outcome time, if the density function for infection is uniform in chronologic time22. This condition should be reasonable here in the setting of MERS-CoV infections, with each exposure interval being relatively short, and reversing the time axis allowed us to use standard approaches for interval-censored data. We added +0.5 to each upper bound and \u22120.5 to each lower bound to give appropriate intervals in continuous time and to account account for uncertainty in the reported exposure times23. For example, an exposure that was reported two and three days before illness onset would be written as an incubation period censored on the interval (1.5, 3.5) instead of (2,3).",

Non-parametric estimation of a distribution based on interval-censored data can be done with the generalized non-parametric maximum likelihood estimator developed by Turnbull25. The incubation period can often be appropriately characterized by different parametric distributions that have been previously used such as gamma926, Weibull92728, lognormal918, log-logistic, and exponential distributions. We fitted five different distributions and estimated the parameters of each distribution using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) in a Bayesian framework. The incubation period distribution was estimated using first the interval-censored data and compared between the different parametric models (using Bayesian Information Criterion) and the Turnbull non-parametric estimate25.",
