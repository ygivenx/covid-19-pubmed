            "text": "Data on people of all ages from a meta-analysis show that about 3 million deaths were caused by acute lower respiratory infections in 2015 [1]. The burden of these infections is essentially supported by Sub-Saharan Africa which recorded about a quarter of all deaths (0.7 million death) [1]. Several viruses have been identified as etiologic agents responsible for ARTI. The clinically most important are classified into 6 families which include Paramyxoviridae (human respirovirus 1 and 3, human rubulavirus 2 and 4 previously named Parainfluenza virus 1\u20134), Pneumoviridae (respiratory syncytial virus A and B and human metapneumovirus A and B), Picornaviridae (enterovirus A to J and rhinovirus A to C), Coronaviridae (human coronavirus: HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV and HCoV-EMC), Orthomyxoviridae (Influenza A, B, and C), and Adenoviridae (human adenovirus A to G) [2]. The ecology of Africa can give to this continent a specific epidemiological profile for ARTI. To date and to the best of our knowledge, one systematic review of data published between 2000 and 2015 on the prevalence of respiratory pathogens only in children under 5 living in Africa has been reported [3]. This systematic review considered only data from sub-Saharan Africa did not perform a meta-analysis and quality assessment of the included articles. In the present systematic review with meta-analysis, we will include population regardless of age and from the entire African continent including Northern Africa. We will therefore able to compare the epidemiology of viral aetiologies of acute respiratory tract infections among age groups and among geographical regions of the continent.",

Unadjusted prevalence will be recalculated based on the information of crude numerators and denominators provided by individual studies. Prevalence will be reported with their 95% confidence interval and prediction interval. To keep the effect of studies with extremely small or extremely large prevalence estimates on the overall estimate to a minimum, the variance of the study -specific prevalence will be stabilised with the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation before pooling the data with the random-effects meta-analysis model [8]. Egger\u2019s test will serve to assess the presence of publication bias [9]. A p value < 0.10 on Egger test will be considered indicative of statistically significant publication bias. Heterogeneity will be evaluated by the \u03c72 test on Cochrane\u2019s Q statistic [10], which will be quantified by H and I2 values. The I2 statistic estimates the percentage of total variation across studies due to true between-study differences rather than chance. In general, I2 values greater than 60\u201370% indicate the presence of substantial heterogeneity [11]. Subgroup analyses will be performed for the following subgroups: age groups (0\u20135 years versus > 5 years), population (children [\u2264 15 years] versus adults), clinical presentation (severe versus benign forms), and UNSD African Regions. Univariable meta-regression will be used to test for an effect of study and participants\u2019 characteristics (year of publication, seasonality, number of screened viruses, clinical presentation, age groups, population, UNSD of regions, absolute latitude [distance to equator], latitude, longitude, and altitude). Following crude overall prevalence, we will conduct two sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of our findings. The first one will include only studies with low risk of bias and the second only studies reporting data of a full year(s) period (complete season(s)).",
