            "text": "Cowpox viruses (CPXV) belong to the genus Orthopoxvirus (OPV) in the family Poxviridae [1]. CPXV are endemic in parts of Europe and Western Asia [2]. The primary reservoir host seems to be rodents [3], as serological surveys have shown that the virus is widespread among European wild rodents [4]. In the wild rodent populations, the virus does not induce obvious signs of disease nor does it seem to affect survival [5]. Despite its name, CPXV has not been isolated from cattle during the last three decades [6]; instead, it has been diagnosed most frequently in domestic cats and zoo animals [7]. After elephants, exotic felids are the second most commonly infected group of exotic animals [8]. Cases in captive cheetahs, with high morbidity and mortality, have already been reported in the UK and Russia in the 1970s [9,10]. In domestic and large cats, multiple skin lesions (primarily seen on the head, neck, forelimb or paws, and/or in the oral cavity), conjunctivitis, and/or purulent ocular discharge may develop upon infection. Occasionally, systemic infections occur that may be fatal if internal organs such as the lungs are involved (e.g. necrotizing pneumonia) and in cases of co-infections or immunodeficiency [11]. The route and site of infection, the dose of virus, as well as the CPXV strain seem to influence the outcome of the infection [12]. Cowpox incidences in cats and humans are reported to be highest in late summer and early autumn [1], which coincides with numbers of seroconverting bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) and wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) that peak in this period [3].",

The total number of cheetahs kept in the grounds varies; however, usually the zoo houses 2\u20133 adult males, 3\u20134 adult females, and their offspring until they are approximately two years old. There are two separate cheetah holding facilities (Fig 1), one in the safari park (Fig 1A) with four pens and one at a farm (Fig 1B) with six pens located 1 km away from the park. All enclosures have natural vegetation with high grass and small bushes. Most of the enclosures connect to a stable varying in size between 4 and 9 m2. There is no direct contact between the enclosures as all fences are covered to avoid direct visibility. The same animal keepers take care of both locations.",

During an outbreak at Whipsnade Park in the UK in 1977, two out of three symptomatic cheetahs died; another six contact animals did not have any clinical infection [9]. In contrast, during the outbreak at Moscow Zoo, Russia, in 1973 [10], many different feline species, including two cheetahs, all housed in the same building, fell ill and the majority died. In a recent outbreak at Chester Zoo, UK, in 2012, a family group of five cheetahs got sick and two 4-month-old cubs died, but four other cheetahs in the same institution were not affected [27]. Even though other carnivores were also kept at Whipsnade and Chester, only cheetahs developed clinical poxvirus infection. In both events, only contact animals became sick, indicating high-quality hygiene standards preventing transmission through staff. These observations are in accordance with the outbreaks at Ree Park: although many other feline species (see Table 4) are kept under similar conditions, in close proximity to the cheetahs, and are looked after by the same keepers, none of the animals or keepers has ever shown any symptoms. The reason of cumulated CPXV infections of cheetahs compared to other animal species might be a reduction of genetic diversity, correlating with an increased vulnerability to infectious diseases [28], similar to their high mortality after feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) infections which has been reported previously [29].",

Pfeffer [30] has previously suggested that the cause of sporadic CPXV infections in domestic cats is probably related to the prevalence of CPXV in local rodent populations. Due to the availability of food all the year round and because of the dense vegetation, high rodent activity in and around the zoo is always present. Even though no CPXV could be isolated, 14 out of 21 examined water voles (Arvicola amphibius) caught in the grounds showed antibody titers against poxvirus (Table 4). Also, the fact that outbreaks occurred over a 5-year period, always during late summer/autumn (August\u2013October), is in agreement with other authors [1] and is another indication that poxvirus was not introduced through food animals but rather that wild rodents may have been the source of infection.",

A possible explanation for this distribution of lesions is that cheetahs actively catch rodents and get infected following injury caused by their prey. Furthermore, domestic cat-to-cat transmission is described in the literature as a rare event [11]. Nevertheless, in our cases, we favor the idea of subsequent cheetah-to-cheetah transmission over multiple rodent-to-cheetah transmissions within one cluster since symptoms were first observed 11\u201312 days after the respective index patient became sick. Although symptoms in contact animals were only observed in two of the four enclosures housing more than one animal, high OPV-antibody titers in animals in contact with diseased animals (Table 3) indicate further spread and inapparent infections.",

All five isolates varied to some extent in the genome sequence (Fig 3), indicating that they evolved and were introduced multiple times from their reservoir hosts. Also, the two CPXV that were found in the farm and park within four weeks (clusters 3 and 4) clearly differ in their sequences, indicating the co-circulation of multiple viruses. Furthermore, we conclude that the virus was most likely not keeper transmitted. While the sequences from the five cheetah clusters do not cluster as closely as other sequences coming from a single outbreak (see Fig 3), this is not surprising given that the examined events span several years. The low intra-clade distances and the comparatively large distance to any sequence from outside the cheetah clade are also consistent with the hypothesis of CPXV circulating and evolving in the wildlife in the region and sometimes becoming visible due to transmission to cheetahs in the zoo.",

            "text": "Clinical signs varied among the different cases. Since none of the cheetahs at Ree Park has ever shown severe symptoms for or succumbed to any common cat virus, it is unlikely that such a virus has promoted clinical manifestation of CPXV disease. However, apart from the female that died with severe respiratory symptoms, it was always the index patient that was clinically most severely affected. The detection of high viral loads in multiple tissues and especially in the blood of Grey and Top Cut (Table 2) is consistent with the observed severity of disease. Contact animals only developed mild lesions which were only noticed because of the careful monitoring during outbreaks. These observations suggest an inefficient transmission of the virus from cheetah to cheetah which is in concordance with the description of rare events of cat-to-cat transmission [11]. As already stated by others, the route and site of infection as well as the dose of virus seem to influence the clinical outcome [12]. It is not known whether the low mortality at Ree Park in comparison to the mortality in other published outbreaks is due to a CPXV strain with low virulence or whether different management during the outbreaks contributed to a higher survival rate. During the first outbreak (cluster 1), the entire group of five animals was isolated in their stable, resulting in a very high stress level. The siblings of this cluster (Table 3, cluster 1) were the contact animals with the highest post-infection antibody titers at the zoo, which might be a result of greater exposure to virus material inside the environment of the stable or of multiple infection events with high viral loads as they had partly eaten their dead sibling. After this first incident, animals with pox lesions were not confined to a stable or handled, in order to keep stress levels as low as possible. Also, the vegetation was kept untouched to increase the wellbeing of the cheetahs, rather than trying to reduce the number of rodents. In current literature [8,32], isolation is considered the most important management tool to avoid further spread of the disease. In our experience, the virus is not easily spread from one enclosure to another. Because the enclosures at Ree Park are large, keepers only need to enter the enclosures once to twice a year for maintenance reasons. Whenever any carnivore enclosure is entered, a double layer of single-use disposable overshoes is worn to avoid transmission of pathogens from one area to another. Single-use disposable gloves are always worn when animals or their food or waste are handled. The same standards are used for entering stables or night houses. By leaving the animals outdoors and sticking to the hands-off policy by the keepers, the risk of zoonotic infections for the keepers is reduced as well.",

All cheetahs were initially vaccinated with 2ml MVA twice, with a 4-week interval. Although cluster 5 in 2014 was a group of vaccinated animals, one animal (Nova) was still infected with CPXV. This implies that the affected animal was not completely protected from disease, indicating that cheetahs might need a different vaccination regimen to that recommended in elephants.

Animals other than cheetah are currently not vaccinated at the institution. Modification of enclosure design, increased pest control, and aggressive treatment in the case of CPXV infections have not been applied. However, as vaccination has not prevented clinical infection, a 4-week preshipment quarantine for all cheetahs that leave the institution has been made obligatory. The quarantined animals are kept inside a stable from the day a first blood sample is taken until the day they leave. After four weeks, a second blood sample is drawn. The samples are tested for OPV antibodies by IFA. No change or a decrease in antibodies is considered to be negative for signs of current infection. To date, preshipment quarantine at Ree Park is only carried out in cheetahs. Whether the preshipment quarantine should be extended to other species remains the subject of discussion.",
