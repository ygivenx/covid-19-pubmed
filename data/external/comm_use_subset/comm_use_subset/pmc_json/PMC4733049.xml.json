In order to purify the protein, Rv0888 was expressed as a 6 \u00d7 His-tagged protein in E. coli. Though it was expressed in inclusion body form, Rv0888 was renatured and purified via a Ni2+ affinity chromatography resin (Fig. 1A). Then, the eluted Rv0888 protein was loaded onto an anion exchange chromatography column (Fig. 1B) and subsequently passed through a gel filtration chromatography resin, subsequently resulting in greater than 98% protein purity (Fig. 1C).",

Three groups of 3 mice were infected intranasally with a dose (2 \u00d7 107 colony forming units) of the rMS strains pMV262/MS, Rv0888NS/MS, and Rv0888S/MS, respectively. Bacterial loads in lung tissue were measured at 4 h, 24 h, 4 d, 7 d, and 17 d after infection (Fig. 7). No significant difference was observed between the bacterial loads of Rv0888NS/MS and Rv0888S/MS groups at all time-points, whereas the bacterial loads of Rv0888NS/MS and Rv0888S/MS groups were remarkably higher, compared with that of pMV262/MS group, at 4 d, 7 d, and 17 d after infection. Importantly, in contrast to the almost total clearance of bacteria in the lungs of infected mice in the pMV262/MS group at 17 d, bacterial loads still persisted in mice of the Rv0888NS/MS and Rv0888S/MS groups.",

This temperature range is consistent with the body temperature during fever in humans and animals after M. tuberculosis infection, suggesting that Rv0888 may be related to M. tuberculosis virulence. Similar to other DNase/nucleases, Rv0888 nuclease requires divalent cations for its activity. Mn2+ and Ca2+ were found to be optimal for its nuclease activity, although other divalent cations (Mg2+, Ba2+, Ni2+) could also stimulate Rv0888 activity (Table 1). These observations indicated that either the divalent cation diameter was not a factor in accessing the Rv0888 catalytic site or that these cations bind to different amino acids to maintain activity, as previously reported for the E. coli nuclease, Colicin E921. Metal chelation, as assessed by EDTA treatment, had a strong inhibitory effect on the activity of the Rv0888 enzyme, suggesting that metal ions were obligatory for nuclease activity and that they might play vital roles in stabilizing the enzymatic structure.",

Although the Rv0888 protein showed non-specific nuclease activity, it also shares no homology to any known nucleases, as determined by the primary amino acid sequence (Supplementary Fig. S1).

New drugs and more effective vaccines are urgently needed, thus necessitating a better understanding of the genetic basis for M. tuberculosis virulence and pathogenesis23. Interestingly, Rv0888 activity was inhibited by four Chinese medicine monomers (Oleuropein, 6-Gingerol, Corylifolinin, and Acteoside). Previous studies have concentrated on small molecule inhibitors, focusing on proteins and factors related to the biosynthesis of pathogens: limiting S. aureus entry into endothelial cells by structural analogs of ML 14124; blocking coronavirus and filovirus entry into host cells by the cysteine protease inhibitor K1177725; blocking phosphatidylglycerol-LtaS binding and inhibiting LTA synthesis in ItaS-expressin S. aureus and in Escherichia coli with compound 177126; Inhibiting A. baumannii Lipid II (an essential precursor of cell wall biosynthesis) through the use of BAS0012753827. Subsequent drug studies then shifted to cell wall proteins and proteases: small molecule inhibitors of sortase that act as an anti-infective therapy against hospital-acquired S. aureus infection without the side effects of standard antibiotics28; tetrahydrolipstatin that inhibits the phospholipase/thioesterase (Rv3802c) of M. tuberculosis29; an inhibitor of mPTPB (a virulence factor of tuberculosis) which was acquired by organocatalysis30; six small molecules that were confirmed to act as novel EndA (surface endonuclease of the S. pneumoniae) inhibitors31. Importantly, this manuscript report for the first time that Chinese medicine monomers are effective inhibitors of bacterial nucleases. New drug research is currently mining traditional Chinese medicine to discover novel chemical agents to use against drug-resistant pathogens. Therefore, identification of new virulence factors, and screening their inhibitors from Chinese medicines, may ultimately result in the discovery of novel drugs available to treat TB.",

In M. tuberculosis, Rv0888 contains a signal peptide and is secreted into the medium14.
