Polyphenols are produced by most plants, including seaweeds, where they act as antioxidants that protect from external conditions such as stress and herbivores [3]. Some of the compounds found in seaweeds with the best antiviral activity are sulphated polysaccharides and phenolic compounds [4]. The antiviral activity of polyphenols has been observed mainly against enveloped viruses such as Retrovirus, Influenza Virus, Papilloma Virus, Herpes virus, and flaviviruses [5,6,7,8,9]. The Measles virus (MeV) is an enveloped virus that has regained importance as a pathogen as a result of the several recent outbreaks that have occurred in developed countries [10]. Despite the availability of a vaccine, this illness has not been eradicated; hence, the use of an effective antiviral as a therapy could contribute to outbreak containment and lead to eradication.",

Seaweeds sulphated polysaccharides have also been extensively studied for antiviral activity, but seaweeds polyphenols are relatively new to antiviral research [29,30,31]. All of the PPs evaluated showed antiviral activity against MeV (Table 1). Polyphenol-rich extracts of Solieria filiformis and Ecklonia arborea (formerly Eisenia arborea) showed the highest Selectivity Index (>3750 and >576.9 respectively) and were selected to the subsequent experiments due to their high efficacy and low cytotoxicity by comparing with ribavirin, an FDA approved antiviral (SI of 11.57). Syncytia formation and viral titration by qPCR were used to evaluate antiviral activity of both extracts (Figure 1). A significant reduction between controls and treatments was observed with both techniques, but substantial significance differences were observed by comparing the highest concentrations tested of PPs in both techniques. Although PCR is typically a more sensitive method than tissue culture techniques, the presence of viral RNA may not always reflect an association with infective viruses production [32].",

            "text": "Synergistic activity of secondary metabolites of seaweeds has been reported for our group. We previously tested the combinational activity of sulfated polysaccharides (SPs) isolated from the same five seaweeds and observed a synergistic effect because of the different mode of action in the SPs evaluated [13]. In this study, we tested the antiviral activity of PPs in combination with SPs extracted of the same seaweeds and ribavirin. The combinations with the best synergistic activity were observed by combining PPs of Solieria filiformis as well as Ecklonia arborea PPs with SPs of Solieria filiformis at low concentrations (0.01 \u00b5g/mL) (Table 2). The antiviral activity of the best combinations was confirmed by qPCR (Figure 2). All of the evaluated combinations of PPs with ribavirin showed an antagonic effect (Tale 3). Owing to the synergistic effect observed by combining PPs and SPs, we questioned the different mode of action between both extracts; therefore, we assayed three different techniques to elucidate the mode of action of PPs. The virucidal activity of PPs of Solieria filiformis and Ecklonia arborea was tested in order to determine if the compounds are inactivating the virus before the infection of Vero cells (Figure 3). Both polyphenols were shown to have a remarkable inhibitory effect at minute 0 and 15 of the infection (Figure 4); a decrease in syncytia and viral load was found in the viral penetration tests (Figure 5); the best inhibitory effect was observed when performing the virucidal test, decreasing to 90% the formation of syncytia after 6 h of PPs-virus interaction (Figure 3). It is possible that the effect of these Polyphenol-rich extracts is the direct deactivation of the virion, which therefore, prevents it from adsorbing and penetrating the host cell, an effect that we consistently see in the addition and penetration times tests. Virucidal activity of polyphenols has been observed previously, such as, polyphenols isolated from Cistus (Tracheophyta, Magnoliopsida), a floral plant that showed virucidal effect against Influenza virus through inhibition of HA binding to cellular receptors [33].",

HPLC and mass analysis allowed us to identify potential natural compounds that may be playing an important role in the antiviral activity of the extract. Six fractions and five fractions were collected from Solieria filiformis and Ecklonia arborea extracts, respectively (Figure 6A,B). Tentative compounds identified in Solieria filiformis extract are mostly phenolic compounds previously reported as secondary metabolites of seaweeds (Table 4). Quercetin and kaempherol were reported in high percentages in the red seaweed Gracilaria dendroides (Rhodophyta), which showed antimicrobial activity [34]. High concentrations of quercetin were found in a polyphenol-rich extract isolated from the red seaweed Kappaphycus alvarezii (formerly Eucheuma cottonii) which suppressed breast tumor via hormone modulation and apoptosis induction [35]. Antiviral activity of quercetin and kaempherol has been reported against Herpes Simplex Virus and Influenza virus, as well as the synergistic antiviral effect [36,37]. Phlorofucofuroeckol-B, a compound identified in the Ecklonia arborea (formerly Eisenia arborea) extract, is a phlorotannin previously reported in this brown seaweed (Table 5). Phlorofucofuroeckol-B, isolated from Ecklonia bicyclis (formerly Eisenia bicilys) and Ecklonia arborea, has also been reported as showing potent antioxidant and anti-allergic [38,39]. Antiviral activity in vitro of phlorofucofuroeckol-A isolated from Ecklonia bicilys (formerly Eisenia bicilys) against murine norovirus was reported to have a Selectivity index of 668.87 [31]. Even though there are some reports about the antiviral activity of seaweeds polyphenols that prevent viral adsorption and replication [40], this is the first report of the virucidal effect of Polyphenol-rich extracts of seaweeds, to our knowledge.",
