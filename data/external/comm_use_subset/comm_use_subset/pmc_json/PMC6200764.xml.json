SARS-CoV reappeared in a second smaller outbreak in 2004, but has since disappeared from human circulation. However, closely related coronaviruses, such as WIV1, currently circulate in bat reservoirs and are capable of utilizing human receptors to enter cells2 and there are no vaccines or virus-specific treatments available for human use. The more recent emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)1 and the likelihood of future zoonotic transmission of novel coronaviruses to humans from animal reservoirs makes robust reagent development for the display of neutralizing epitopes of great importance to human health. Understanding how coronavirus S glycoproteins are processed and bind to host receptors is key to the development of coronavirus vaccines and therapeutics.",

During viral egress from infected host cells, some coronavirus S proteins are cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits. The S1 subunit is responsible for host-receptor binding while the S2 subunit contains the membrane-fusion machinery. During viral entry, the S1 subunit binds host receptors in an interaction thought to expose a secondary cleavage site within S2 (S2\u2032) adjacent to the fusion peptide for cleavage by host proteases4\u20137. This S2\u2032 proteolysis has been hypothesized to facilitate insertion of the fusion peptide into host membranes after the first heptad repeat region (HR1) of the S2 subunit rearranges into an extended \u03b1-helix8\u201310. Subsequent conformational changes in the second heptad repeat region (HR2) of S2 form a six-helix bundle with HR1, fusing the viral and host membranes and allowing for release of the viral genome into host cells10. Coronavirus S is also the target of neutralizing antibodies11, making an understanding of S structure and conformational states pertinent for investigating S antigenic surfaces and designing vaccines.",

Initial examination of HCoV-HKU1 S showed that the receptor-binding site on the S1 RBD was occluded when the RBD was in a \u2018down\u2019 conformation and it was hypothesized that conformational changes were required to access this site16. Subsequent studies of the highly pathogenic human coronavirus S proteins of SARS-CoV15,22 and MERS-CoV17,22 showed that these viral S1 RBD do indeed sample an \u2018up\u2019 conformation where the receptor-binding site is accessible. These structural studies also located the positions of the S1/S2 and S2\u2032 cleavage sites on the prefusion spike. The S1/S2 site lies within a surface exposed loop in the second subdomain of S116. However, the S2\u2032 site lies closer to base of the spike and though this region is located on the surface of the spike, cleavage at this site is prevented by surrounding protein elements17.",

The instability of the prefusion state presents a significant challenge for the production of protein antigens for antigenic presentation of the prefusion antibody epitopes that are most likely to lead to neutralizing responses. Recently, we presented the design of two proline mutations (2P) for the prefusion stabilization of coronavirus S proteins17. The stabilized MERS-CoV S 2P ectodomain was shown to maintain the prefusion spike conformation, have similar antibody recognition as wild-type S and possess higher immunogenicity. Here, we have used single-particle cryo-EM to determine structures of prefusion stabilized SARS-CoV S 2P ectodomain in uncleaved, S1/S2 cleaved and ACE2-bound states. Three-dimensional classification of the S1 RBD positions and corresponding atomic protein models revealed that neither ACE2-binding nor trypsin cleavage at the S1/S2 boundary induced substantial conformational changes in the prefusion stabilized S protein.",

For this reason, available SARS-CoV S crystal structures22,23 of corresponding domains were placed into these densities. Overall, the SARS-CoV S 2P structure resembles that of other coronaviruses, particularly those of the betacoronavirus genus16,17,19,22 and the previously published SARS-CoV wild-type prefusion ectodomains15,22. The S1 domains surround the helical S2 subunits and interdigitate at the membrane-distal apex of the trimeric spike. The structure of the S2 subunit appears to be highly conserved across coronavirus genera18,20,21. The SARS-CoV prefusion wild-type and 2P structures are nearly identical in most regions, including regions proximal to the 2P mutation site (Fig. 1b,c).",

The region C-terminal to the fusion peptide, known as FP2, has been suggested to act as the second part of a bipartite fusion peptide for SARS-CoV S24. Comparison of this FP2 region in the structures presented here with the MHV19, HCoV-HKU116, MERS-CoV17,22, HCoV-NL6320 and Porcine deltacoronavirus18,21 S structures indicates that SARS-CoV adopts a unique conformation in this region (Fig. 2). Whereas most other coronaviruses possess two short \u03b1-helices with a cross-linking disulfide bond, in SARS-CoV a similar disulfide bond bridges the two strands of a beta-hairpin. The unique SARS-CoV S conformation of FP2 and the lack of cross-group sequence conservation beyond the disulfide bond in this region suggest that SARS-CoV may use a distinct mechanism of FP2 membrane insertion.",

The delineation of two distinct conformations for each S1 RBD is consistent with observations made for MERS-CoV17,22 as well as one of the studies of wild-type SARS-CoV S22. Gui et al.15, however, observed a gradient of conformations in wild-type SARS-CoV S, which has not been observed in other structural studies of coronavirus spikes nor the work presented here. Some possibilities for these different observations may be the differences in spike expression system yielding alternate glycosylation patterns or alternate protein constructs, but the true source remains unclear. The \u2018down\u2019 conformation caps the S2 helices and makes extensive contacts with the S1 NTD. The \u2018up\u2019 conformation of the S1 RBD exposes the S1 RBD receptor-binding site. It has been previously reported that for wild-type SARS-CoV S, 56% of the particles contained three \u2018down\u2019 RBD conformations while 44% contained a single \u2018up\u2019 S1 RBD conformation22. To examine the conformation of the S1 RBD among our SARS-CoV S 2P ectodomains, we used a local masking, image sutraction and 3-D sorting strategy17 to more accurately classify the conformations as being either \u2018down\u2019 or \u2018up\u2019 at each of the three S1 RBD positions within the trimer. This analysis revealed that the majority of the S 2P proteins were in the single-\u2018up\u2019 conformation (58%) with lesser amounts of double- and triple-\u2018up\u2019 conformations (39% and 3% respectively) and with no all-\u2018down\u2019 conformation observed. The increased propensity to adopt the \u2018up\u2019 S1 RBD conformation may indicate a difference in the coronavirus S containing the 2P mutations, however other differences in sample preparation cannot be fully ruled out.",

Using a similar masking and 3-D sorting strategy as above we sorted the unbound S class further into classes with S1 conformations of one or two \u2018up\u2019 S1 RBDs (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Tables S2\u2013S4 and Figs S3\u2013S5).

Expanding our 3D sorting strategy, we classified our ACE2-bound particles at each S1 RBD position and identified single, double and triple ACE2-bound S.

The proportion of total \u2018up\u2019 S1 RBD conformations within the ACE2-bound and -unbound classes is nearly identical within this dataset (58% \u2018up\u2019 S1 RBD). This strongly suggests that binding of a single ACE2 receptor does not induce adjacent S1 RBDs to transition from a \u2018down\u2019 to \u2018up\u2019 conformation within the context of the stabilized S. Hence, ACE2 is more likely to bind to an already \u2018up\u2019 S1 RBD rather than inducing the conformational changes that are required for the S1 RBD to become accessible to ACE2. Though the proportion of \u2018up\u2019 S1 RBD in the ACE2 dataset (58%) is similar to the proportion of \u2018up\u2019 S1 RBD in the SARS S 2P ectodomain dataset (48%), there is a large difference in the distributions of one \u2018up\u2019 and two \u2018up\u2019 conformational states between these datasets.

This poor saturation is illustrated by the small proportion of triple-bound ACE2 and the majority of spikes that are unbound by receptor. In contrast, isolated recombinant S1 RBD easily binds ACE2 and is capable saturating ACE2 on target cells to block S-mediated entry14. Our observed sub-stoichiometric ACE2 binding to trimeric spikes is consistent with the difficulty in using soluble ACE2 receptor to neutralize SARS-CoV S pseudotyped onto VSV25. The reduced binding of ACE2 to trimeric spikes is likely due to the incomplete exposure and conformational flexibility of the S1 RBD.

This difference is likely due to poor density in the hinge regions between the S1 RBD and subdomain 1 (SD-1) in these previous reconstructions15,22 rather than the presentation of a unique receptor-bound conformation or the influence of the stabilizing mutations. Indeed, the bound ACE2 receptor and S1 RBD for all reconstructions here show poorer density quality than the less mobile regions of the SARS-CoV S (Fig. 4). To improve the density for ACE2-bound S1 RBD, we used focused refinement with image subtraction on this region to overcome the flexibility of these domains relative to the rest of SARS-CoV S 2P. This yielded a 7.9 \u00c5 resolution reconstruction with improved local density quality (Fig. 4b,c). We successfully placed the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV S1 RBD bound to ACE2 (2AJF.pdb23) into this density as a rigid body indicating that the previously determined crystal structure accurately recapitulates the conformation between the ACE2-bound S1 RBD in the prefusion stabilized trimeric spike. Given that the S1 RBD in its \u2018up\u2019 conformation is well separated in space and sequence from the 2P stabilizing mutations, we do not anticipate that the introduction of these prefusion stabilizing mutations influences the molecular interactions between the S1 RBD and ACE2 beyond perhaps increasing the prevalence of the S1 RBD \u2018up\u2019 conformations as noted above. Indeed, both the wild-type and 2P-stabilized SARS-CoV S ectodomains demonstrate similar affinities for ACE2 by SPR (185 and 150 nM respectively, Supplementary Fig. S7).",

Hence, any conformational changes induced by receptor binding to the S1 RBD are more likely to be caused by the absence of the S1 RBD contacts in the \u2018up\u2019 conformation, rather than the formation of additional intra-spike contacts in a receptor-bound state (Supplementary Fig. S8). Indeed, movement of the S1 RBD to the \u2018up\u2019 conformation disrupts molecular interactions with the S2 central \u03b1-helices which may play a role in receptor-induced conformational changes in wild-type spikes. The observation that host-receptor engagement of the S1 RBD disrupts interactions within spike in a manner independent of direct receptor-spike contacts suggests a flexible mechanism for how different coronavirus spikes may bind to diverse protein receptors with their S1 RBD and facilitate fusion with host cells.",

Comparison of our ACE2-bound 2P-stabilized spike structures with those of both the wild-type SARS-CoV S and the 2P-stabilized SARS-CoV S indicate that overall, these structures are similar and do not exhibit large conformational differences. The absence of conformational changes includes regions near the S2\u2032 cleavage site, fusion peptide and S2 heptad repeat 1 (HR1). However, fine examination of the ACE2-bound S structure revealed a modest conformational change in the S2 central helix where the S2 had been uncapped by a receptor-bound RBD. In both the wild-type15,22 and 2P unbound structures, the central helix presents as an \u03b1-helix in each protomer of the trimer. However, in the ACE2-bound structure, the upper portion of the S2 helix uncapped by the ACE2-bound S1 RBD has transitioned to a 310-helix (Fig. 4d,e). The \u03b1- to 310-helix transition is unique to the S2 protomer uncapped by the ACE2-bound S1 RBD and is not observed in the other two copies of the trimeric spike. This subtle transition may indicate that conformational changes towards fusion are initiated in the central helix. N-terminal to the central helix are the 2P mutations that stabilize the spike in its prefusion conformation. These stabilizing mutations may block the propagation of conformational changes beyond the subtle change to a short 310-helix, providing a possible mechanism for their prefusion stabilizing effect.",

In addition, coronaviruses possess a secondary cleavage site in S2 called S2\u203227.

Nearing the end of the time course additional lower molecular weight bands are observed which we interpret to be degradation of the S1 subunit.

Moreover, examination of the structure models indicates no significant differences between the trypsin-cleaved and uncleaved SARS-CoV S 2P (Fig. 5b). Fine sorting of S1 RBD positions of the trypsin-cleaved S reveals a very similar distribution of \u2018up\u2019 S1 RBD conformations available for receptor binding as in the uncleaved samples, although we additionally observe a small proportion of S1 RBD in the all-\u2018down\u2019 conformation (Fig. 5c).

The only conformational change that we observe in the ACE2-SARS-CoV S 2P structures is the transition to a short 310-helix at the top of the S2 central \u03b1-helix when uncapped by receptor-bound S1 RBD suggesting that more extensive conformational changes may be initiated here. 310-helices have been hypothesized to act as intermediates in coil-to-\u03b1-helix transitions32. Transitions between 310-helices and \u03b1-helices has also been hypothesized for the voltage sensing domains of potassium channels where it has been proposed that the transition plays a role in changing from a resting or activated state to a relaxed state33. Though more extensive changes are likely to drive conformational rearrangements accompanying membrane fusion, the 2P prefusion stabilizing mutations adjacent to the short 310-helix may block these changes from occurring.

Our structural examinations of both receptor-bound and trypsin-cleaved prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV S 2P proteins indicate that neither receptor binding nor trypsin cleavage induce large conformational changes in stabilized spikes. Additionally, these structures and accompanying limited proteolysis experiments show that neither receptor binding nor trypsin cleavage expose the S2\u2032 cleavage site for proteolysis within the stabilized spike ectodomains. This work increases the body of knowledge surrounding these prefusion-stabilized spikes as presenting native surfaces for interactions with host factors while maintaining their prefusion conformation.",

For the SARS S 2P and trypsin-treated SARS S 2P, all particles from the clean stacks were used for reconstruction with C3 symmetry. All datasets were extensively sorted using 3D classification to examine heterogeneity in the S1 RBDs as described previously17. Briefly, 3D masks were defined to encompass the possible heterogeneity at each S1 RBD position. The density within these masks was then removed from unfiltered, unsharpened reconstructions. We then used relion_project with image subtraction to create a particle stack containing only the signal arising from the masked density. Finally, we used focused 3D classification to identify compositional and conformational states at each S1 RBD position. All 3D reconstructions were produced with RELION48 and final refinements were performed with a six-pixel soft-edge solvent mask. Post-processing was applied to each reconstruction to apply B-factor sharpening and amplitude corrections as well as to calculate local resolution maps.",
