Protection is achieved through stimulation of CD4+ helper T lymphocytes and CD8+ IFN-\u03b3 producing T lymphocyte responses. These CD8+ T cells recognize octamer/nonamer peptides presented on HLA supermotif molecules on infected cells. Previously, our laboratory (RM, KE) identified epitopes eliciting CD8+ T cells derived from proteins expressed during different phases of the Toxoplasma life cycle. HLA-A02, A03-11 and B07 human, supermotif, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules are present in ~90% of humans,3\u20136 and therefore are capable of presenting these epitopes. As the discovery of such protective peptide epitopes accumulates, mechanisms are needed to effectively present these epitopes to the immune system of the host.",

SAPNs induce immune response that are orders of magnitudes stronger than Keyhole limpet hemocyanin, which is a standard vaccine carrier.

Purified IgG from a control monkey did not protect any mice; 3) Purified IgG from immunized monkeys, mixed with P. falciparum sporozoites, prevented the sporozoite from infecting primary hepatocytes from human liver in tissue culture. IgG from control monkeys did not. Thus, we used this preliminary, foundational data when we chose GLA-SE as the adjuvant for our studies herein. GLA-SE has two components, GLA and SE. GLA is too hydrophobic to be used alone and any formulation of GLA would have other excipients making the formulation nonequivalent to GLA. Earlier studies demonstrated that the emulsion, called \u201cSE\u201d, did not adjuvant most proteins when administered alone. At present, GLA-SE is in pre-clinical studies or clinical trials as an adjuvant to prevent cancer, herpes, Leishmania, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections. Our earlier studies also demonstrated that GLA-SE was superior to ALUM as an adjuvant for our polypeptide.25 GLA-SE was also superior to ALUM in primates immunized with SAPN. In fact, ALUM diminished the response to GLA-SE plus SAPN (DL, PB, unpublished work).",

In contrast to live attenuated vaccines, SAPN-derived vaccines pose no significant risk of infection.

However, the activity is reduced compared to the Empty-SAPN. This could be due to some interference with TLR5-binding and the presentation of the CD8+ T cell-restricted epitopes because the CD8+ epitopes string was engineered into the flagellin molecule to replace the D2 and D3 flagellin domains.",

The proposed mechanisms for inducing innate immunity by our SAPN is the ligation of TLR4 by GLA in an emulsion30 and TLR5 by flagellin on the surface of the SAPN.13 McCoy et al.\u2019s data suggested cross presentation14 of CD8+ stimulating epitopes in SAPNs (Fig. 1a). GLA-SE has been used with SAPN to successfully immunize against P. falciparum by eliciting antibody and T cells, whereas SAPN without GLA-SE was not effective (DL, PB, unpublished results). The adjuvant was safe in primates and now is entering clinical trials in humans. Despite remarkable protection provided by our SAPN vaccination in this study, some brain cysts were still detected. Thus, potential improvements in induction of protective immune responses could be made with the addition of separate nanoparticles with other CD4+ and CD8+ T cell-eliciting epitopes of various T. gondii proteins from several parasite life stages and potentially B-cell epitopes to stimulate a potent antibody response. Cell-mediated immunity, with cytolytic T cells and IFN-\u03b3 production, is considered to be the desired primary, protective, immune response.28, 31 Nonetheless, antibodies may contribute to protection. Addition of the micronemal proteins (MICs) or other proteins that induce antibodies that are neutralizing, adhesion or invasion blocking, or complement fixing, could further improve protection, if they play a significant part in attachment to or penetration of the host cell by the parasite. MICs have recently been used as recombinant vaccines and showed promising protection levels.32 MIC1 also stimulates IL 12 production in mice. Possibly, these proteins could also be engineered in separate SAPNs to yield a multi-SAPN vaccine to protect against toxoplasmosis.",

This study involved presenting antigens to protect against the phylogenetically related apicomplexan malaria parasite in non-human primates.

In almost all of these different systems the value of using both GLA and SE together was proven (Table 1).20\u201323, 33\u201336 This work has been advanced to the clinic, demonstrating both efficacy and safety in studies with GLA and SE formulated and administered together.

Octamer/nonamer peptides; Supplementary figures S1 [SAG1], S2 [GRA6], S3 [GRA5], S4 [SAG2E], and S5 [SRS52A]). This analysis of 62 genetically divergent strains (Fig. 1a) supports the use of an immunosense approach. This approach creates a single protein which contains the relevant epitopes but does not include extraneous epitopes that are potentially harmful, as certain T. gondii epitopes are known to be. There were far fewer polymorphisms in our smaller octamer nonamer peptides (Tables 2\u20134) than in the full-length proteins (Table 3, Figs. S1\u2013S5). There were good binding octamer/nonamers for three A11 epitopes among all the different genetic isolates (Table 4). The predicted binding scores for the peptides from the many genetically polymorphic strains were high for all but two peptides (Table 4). In contrast, it would take many full-length variants to obtain good geographic coverage of either of these polymorphic proteins if peptides other than our octamer/nonamer were critical to that protection. This provides further conceptual support for using an immunosense approach to make a vaccine with, potential to work well, and most parsimoniously, in many geographic areas. There are recent data concerning the unique processing of T. gondii proteins in human cells. Quite remarkably, there are longer (likely decoy) peptides that bind HLA-A2 in the natural infection of THP1 cells.37 This makes our targeted immunosense approach, beginning with human cells, then using HLA transgenic mice, especially valuable in creating a vaccine for people, rather than mice. These are critical considerations important beyond a vaccine protective against just this organism, when one wants to have broad utility across different demographics, worldwide. This is what we are working toward because of the substantial disease burden of toxoplasmosis as a global clinical problem.38\n",

For example, as shown elegantly, recently,39 human and murine tapasin diverge in sequence. These tapasins are chaperones of MHC class I molecules. Newer murine models with human tapasin and proteasome might improve vaccine potency and be more relevant to human vaccine development.39 Alternatively, our optimized cleavage sites, based on human infection, using human PBMC, may work as effectively in our HLA-A*1101 mice. This comparison will be tested in future studies. Further, there are other significant differences between mice and humans. Murine models have been imperfect predictors of vaccine performance in humans, apart from differences in HLA, tapasin or variants of ERAP. Differences in ERAP between mice and humans does not cause differences in processing and presentation. Other differences between mice and humans include very different total blood volume, rate of metabolism, skin composition/absorption rate, different TLR specificities, as well as other basic differences between murine and human cells. For example, human T cells, express Class II MHC, while mouse T cells do not. Nonetheless, relating to the question of whether HLA transgenic mice are a good approximation of human responses, Sette et al. made the following comment: despite the differences, when this issue was considered in detail, practical studies confirm that \u201calthough there ought to be a difference, actual data in peer reviewed studies, show that there is little difference\u201d.40 Humanized mice with blood and liver transplants and other modifications are also still imperfect. These humanized mouse systems have not yet worked really well to demonstrate practical feasibility. For vaccine development, the FDA requires animal in vivo immunogenic data for IND submission. Vaccine developers have followed this requirement for the vaccines they are creating, which include viral vector or VLP-based vaccines. To date, there is no system that allows skipping the animal testing step. Most vaccines (e.g. viral, virus-like particles, proteins, bacterial) generate an immune response in an animal model. These immune responses provide preliminary data prior to studies in non-human primates and then in humans. This approach permits one to conclude that the vaccine is safe and \u2018active\u2019, even if the animal model is not absolutely predictive of precise human correlates, although that would be ideal. We have found that our approach appears to provide insight and to work effectively.3\u20135, 25 This approach includes using bioinformatics, testing human cells for immunogenicity, and then testing those down-selected peptides re-assembled into a protein with linkers designed for proper cleavage.41 This is followed by testing for efficacy and safety using HLA transgenic mice.3\u20135, 25 This approach is shown in our data herein, in our previous foundational experiments,25 and also by many others using other systems. This is for both immunogenicity of peptides or polypeptides or DNA or RNA in human cells first. This is then extended to murine cells, followed by protection measured as reduced parasite burden and enhanced survival. Although imperfect, there is considerable prior support, and support in these recent studies. The use of HLA transgenic mice can obviate problems of heterogeneity, both for MHC supermotifs, and parasite isolates. This is in a proven practical manner in vaccine development.19, 37, 42\u201352 The issues of genetic polymorphism, as well as potential harmful constituents, are amplified in full-length natural proteins (Tables 1\u20134; Fig. 1, S1\u2013S5). Thus, the choice of peptides that are sufficient to interact with HLA molecules that are present in more than 90% of the human population can be made using bioinformatics in a rational and parsimonious manner. This approach considers parasite genetic variation in an inductive, immunosense manner that is proving to be valuable for development of vaccines for humans.",

Using HLA-A*1101 transgenic mice, we demonstrate that the SAPN emulsified in GLA-SE adjuvant elicits a protective MHC class I response. Thus, our work demonstrates that we have developed an improved assembly of peptides for cross presentation of CD8+ T cell eliciting epitopes (Fig. 6) in vaccines to prevent toxoplasmosis.\n",
