Children infected with enterovirus exhibit from asymptomatic, mild symptoms (enterovirus-like illness, EVI) to severe forms with neurologic sequelae, cardiopulmonary failure or death [2, 3]. With no effective antiviral therapy available and an EV71 vaccine under development [4\u20137], surveillance of EVI is necessary to detect early signals, reduce cluster size, and slow spreading. School children infected with influenza have higher viral loads, longer shedding of viruses, and higher attack rates, thus are more likely to amplify transmission and create clusters of influenza-like illness (ILI) cases in families and schools [8\u201310]. An effective early outbreak detection system for school children is, therefore, essential to public health [11, 12].",

During the 2009 pandemic influenza H1N1 (pdm H1N1/09), the numbers of student ILI cases in Taipei surged. A community-based internet accessible, timely syndromic surveillance system thus replaced past facsimile-based paper reporting. Taipei City had a population of 425,709 schoolchildren from preschools to secondary schools (16% of total) in an area of 271.80 km2 in 2010 [14] and higher isolation rates of the novel pdm H1N1/09 virus in Taiwan [15]. Therefore, the Department of Health in Taipei (Taipei-DOH) implemented the first daily School-based Infectious Disease Syndromic Surveillance System (SID-SSS) with a 100% coverage rate of registered educational institutions from preschools to colleges and universities beginning in January 2010.",

Then, an epidemiology team in charge of daily monitoring for the disease trends and the Centers for Disease Control in Taipei (e.g. Taipei-CDC) decides the follow-up public health risk management. Different diseases have various criteria to trigger subsequent investigations. The team initiated outbreak investigations and control measures, once the index EVI case, or more than 2 EVI cases, would be detected within a one-time interval, or an EVI cluster event occurred during an epidemic season. The investigation of ILI cases started when the numbers of ILI cases showed abnormally high after comparing the trends of ILI cases in the same weeks in previous years as well as ILI school or family clusters.",

Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 16.0 (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). Furthermore, the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) with over 99% coverage of approximately 25.68 million Taiwan citizens was also used as the second external dataset. To better evaluate the SID-SSS, we applied the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2005 (LHID2005), a database randomly sampled from the year 2005 registry for beneficiaries, showed no significant differences in the distributions of gender, age from the original NHIRD [16]. Cases (clinic visits) were defined by the selected ICD-9 codes, and health seeking population was estimated by a capture-recapture approach [17, 18]. Chi-square tests and the Pearson correlation coefficients were used for percentage comparisons and correlations, respectively. T-tests were used to compare the means of incidence obtained from different school groups (preschool, primary, and secondary school students and others).

All 12 districts were classified into the four geographic groups\u2014A, B, C, and D, based on their spatial relationships and socioeconomic development status [19]. Group A, B, C and D represented the Taipei Central Businesses District (Taipei-CBD), the para-CBD, the north, and south-east suburban areas, respectively. The district-specific incidence rates of ILI or EVI syndromic cases per 1000 students were calculated by the number of the reported cases for each district divided by the total number of children from the registered preschools to secondary schools in that district. These data were ranked as 1st to 5th quantile for different levels of incidences, based on these four geographic groups. ArcGIS 9.3 program of Geographical Information System (GIS) was used for spatial analysis. The Kriging method [20, 21] was applied to interpolate each grid cell over a spatial domain. To assess the spatio-temporal relationship among the studied cases in a diffusion map, the distance between the centroid of each grid was calculated as the spatial relationship between the incidence rates of the ILI or EVI cases in each district. We made a surface plot of weekly time series as a gradient interpolated between adjacent weeks and district data points. Distance in the map symbolized relative geographic relationship rather than actual distance.",
