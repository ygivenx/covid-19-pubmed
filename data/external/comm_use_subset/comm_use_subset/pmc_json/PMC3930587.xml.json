In contrast, feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) efficiently replicates in macrophages/monocytes, and can lead to feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a highly lethal systemic granulomatous disease, [4]\u2013[8].",

The FIPV DF-2 strain was kindly provided by Berndt Klingeborn (SVA, Uppsala, Sweden). FIPV DF-2 is a regular tissue culture adapted strain that has been well described in the literature, and also used by many other investigators under this name or as FIPV-79-1146 or FIPV-Nor15 [16]. Generation of the recombinant PBFIPV-DF-2 and PBFIPV-DF-2-R3i was described elsewhere [17]. Briefly, PBFIPV-DF-2 is a virus that originated as a molecular clone of FIPV DF-2 and then was successfully transfected into cat cells, where it was replicated for several generations before use in this study. PBFIPV-DF-2-R3i is a derivate of PBFIPV-DF-2 that was re-engineered to contain the intact ORF3abc region of canine coronavirus, and was also transfected into cat cells and cultivated for several generations before being used in this study.",

Their FCoV negative status was checked with PCR, ELISA and virus neutralization tests. Kittens were inoculated oronasally with 103 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50) of the parent virus FIPV DF-2 (n = 4) and the recombinant viruses PFIPV-DF-2 (n = 4) and PFIPV-FD-2-R3i (n = 4), respectively. Kittens were clinically examined on a daily basis for 42 days. Cats were scored for several clinical signs as described earlier [18]. Briefly, scoring was based on depression (inactivity for three consecutive days, 1 point), anorexia (not eating for three consecutive days, 1 point), and neurological disorders (swaggering, 1 point) on a daily basis, while fever (40.1\u00b0C, 1 point), jaundice (yellow plasma, 1 point), weight loss (loss of 2.5% of body weight per week, 1 point), and lymphopenia (lymphocyte count of <0.5\u00d7109/liter) was scored on weekly basis. Kittens showing signs of terminal FIP were euthanized in order to avoid unnecessary suffering, while healthy animals were exterminated at day 42 postinfection (p.i.), followed by full postmortem examination. All animal experiments were approved and supervised by the Ethical and Animal Welfare Committee of National Food Chain Safety Office (Permission No: 2866/2011). The total number of animals was carefully determined by considering two main principles: i.) the number of animals should be ensured proper amount of samples for statistical analysis and ii.) the 3R rules (Replacement, Reduction and Refinement) must be implemented.",

However, an identical FCoV pair differing only in the intactness of ORF3abc has not been tested yet in vivo due to the lack of a cell culture for propagation of type I FECV and a \u201ctrue\u201d type II FECV isolate [8]. Our previous in vitro experiments added further evidence to the involvement of truncated ORF3abc to the increased macrophage tropism of type II FCoV [17].

As it was suspected from clinical signs, viremia was different in PBFIPV-DF-2 challenged animals. The infection kinetics of the two viruses was similar in the first days of infection, with the first replication peak at day 7 p.i.

However, completion of ORF3abc vested PBFIPV-DF-2-R3i with biological properties that differentiate between the FECV and FIPV biotypes, such as intensive replication in the gut, absence of viremia and weak or no serological response.",
