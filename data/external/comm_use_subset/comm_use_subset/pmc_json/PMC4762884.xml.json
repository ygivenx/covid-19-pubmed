However, STING is also necessary for full responsiveness to\u2014and control of\u2014RNA viruses9. Work by us and others has recently proposed alternative and DNA-independent means for activating STING-dependent innate antiviral immune responses1415. In line with this, RNA viruses have been demonstrated to target the STING pathway101112. In order to evaluate the role of STING in the stimulation of interferon production by RNA viruses, and to explore the potential involvement of cGAS, we infected wild-type (WT), STING- and cGAS-deficient MEFs with the two paramyxoviruses Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and SeV and measured the accumulation of type I interferon in the culture supernatant. Interestingly, lack of STING, but not cGAS, significantly reduced the production of type I interferons by cells infected with these viruses (Fig. 1a,b, Supplementary Fig. 1a). In contrast to this, the stimulation of interferon expression by synthetic RNA (poly(I:C)) was not affected in cells lacking STING or cGAS but was completely abolished in MAVS-deficient cells (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1b). To examine whether STING but not cGAS contributed to control of RNA viruses, we infected MEFs from WT, cGAS- and STING-deficient mice with the rhabdovirus VSV and measured accumulation of progeny virus in the supernatant. Consistent with the data on interferon production by RNA viruses, lack of STING but not cGAS led to elevated VSV replication (Fig. 1d).",

Since, IAV did not induce detectable type I interferon production in MEFs we used the human monocyte/macrophage-like cell line THP1. CRISPR/Cas9 technology was used to generate cells deficient for cGAS and STING or \u03b22microglobulin (B2M) as control. The deletion of cGAS and STING was confirmed by western blotting (Supplementary Fig. 1c). As expected, the loss of cGAS or STING abolished the ability to produce type I interferon in response to transfection with DNA, whereas dsRNA-induced type I interferon production was unaffected (Supplementary Fig. 1d). The cells were infected with IAV, and accumulation of interferon in the supernatant was measured after 20 h. Similar to what was observed with NDV and SeV in MEFs, we observed that IAV-induced interferon production was reduced in cells lacking STING expression, but not in cGAS-deficient THP1 cells (Fig. 1e).",

Consistent with this, the majority of the interferon responses evoked by infection with NDV or SeV were dependent on MAVS (Supplementary Fig. 2a,b). However, we observed a significant residual response in MAVS-deficient cells infected with RNA viruses, which we did not observe when transfecting with synthetic RNA (Supplementary Fig. 2a,b and Fig. 1c). The MAVS-independent nature of interferon responses was also observed for IAV, when measuring the ISG CXCL10 in BMDCs infected with high multiplicity of infection (MOI) (Supplementary Fig. 2c). To further explore whether RNA viruses induced a MAVS-independent but STING-dependent pathway, we examined for the ability of SeV, NDV and IAV to stimulate STING dimer formation in THP1 cells lacking MAVS, and therefore unable to respond to RNA (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Interestingly, infection with either of the three RNA viruses induced elevated levels of STING dimers in the lysates (Fig. 1f), and consistent with this, the residual induction of interferon-\u03b2 and CXCL10 expression by IAV in MAVS-deficient cells was ablated when STING but not cGAS was knocked down by shRNA (Fig. 1g and Supplementary Fig. 2d). Poly(I:C) did not stimulate CXCL10 expression in MAVS-deficient cells (Fig. 1g). These data suggests a role for STING in evoking innate immune responses to RNA viruses through a non-canonical pathway.",

            "text": "Identification of viral evasion strategies provides strong evidence for an important role of an immune pathway in antiviral defence16. For instance, IAV seeks to evade the RIG-I pathway by the non-structural protein 1, which targets the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM25 responsible for RIG-I CARD ubiquitination17. Interestingly, co-staining of cells with antibodies against the IAV surface protein hemagglutinin and STING revealed that hemagglutinin co-localized with a small pool of cellular STING (Fig. 1h). The observed specks staining positive for both STING and hemagglutinin, was observed in the majority of cells with positive hemagglutinin staining. Among the STING-hemagglutinin double-positive specks, many were also positive for the early endosome antigen 1 (Supplementary Fig. 3), potentially suggesting the co-localization to occur in early endosomal compartments. Moreover, STING co-immunoprecipitated with hemagglutinin in lysates from infected cells (Fig. 1i). Hemagglutinin is involved in viral entry, and the N-terminal region of HA2, termed the fusion peptide (FP), penetrates the cellular membrane during fusion18. FP is highly conserved among IAV strains and also in influenza B virus1819 (Fig. 1j), and was recently shown to have immunosuppressive properties in a monocytic cell line20. Remarkably, recombinant FP interacted readily with STING in cellular lysates but not with Giantin (Fig. 1k), which, similarly to activated STING, localizes to the Golgi.",

By contrast, FP largely abrogated type I interferon production induced by fusogenic liposomes (Fig. 2c,d), without affecting fusion between liposomes and cells (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Furthermore, as we have also demonstrated previously14, fusogenic liposomes stimulated STING speck formation (Supplementary Fig. 4b), and as observed with IAV the production of type I interferon stimulated by fusogenic liposomes was STING-dependent but cGAS-independent (Fig. 2e,f). FP did not affect the MAVS-dependent response to synthetic RNA, as the response to transfection with poly(I:C) was unchanged (Fig. 2g,h). Moreover, by introducing a single amino-acid deletion to FP (FP\u0394I6) the ability to block type I interferon production was abrogated (Supplementary Fig. 4c). Thus, IAV FP specifically inhibits the cGAS-independent STING pathway induced by lipid membrane fusion but does not affect interferon induction by cytosolic delivery of synthetic DNA, cGAMP or RNA.",

Stimulation through the cGAS-STING pathway is reported to initiate and depend on relocation of STING from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi5. Similar to DNA stimulation, treatment with fusogenic liposomes triggered translocation of STING to the Golgi (Fig. 3a), and Brefeldin A inhibited interferon-\u03b2 expression in response to either fusogenic liposomes or DNA (Supplementary Fig. 5a), thus supporting the importance of STING translocation from ER to the Golgi. Treatment with FP did not interfere with translocation of STING from ER to the Golgi (Fig. 3a). STING forms covalent homodimers in response to stimulation with cyclic di-nucleotides, and dimerization of STING is sufficient for induction of type I interferon21. When examining for STING dimer formation using non-reducing gels, we found that treatment with fusogenic liposomes induced the formation of a reducible STING dimer (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 6a). Interestingly, FP pretreatment abolished STING dimerization, subsequent TBK1 phosphorylation and IRF-dependent transcription in response to fusogenic liposomes (Fig. 3b\u2013d) but not in response to cGAMP irrespective of delivery method (Fig. 3e,f and Supplementary Fig. 6b). These data demonstrate that stimulation of STING-dependent pathways results in formation of stable STING homodimers and phosphorylation of TBK1, and that the IAV FP specifically inhibits this in response to fusogenic liposomes.",

By contrast, FP-coupled beads efficiently precipitated WT and the \u0394N5 (aa162-378) STING mutant but not the \u0394N6 (aa173-378) STING mutant (Fig. 4a).

These data identify the residues 162\u2013172, which are highly conserved between murine and human STING, as being important for the interaction between STING and FP (Fig. 4b). Moreover, the region contains residues involved in binding to cGAMP67 and overlaps with a region important for STING dimerization4. To investigate whether the interaction between FP and STING was direct, we expressed hSTING (C-terminal domain containing the FP-interacting region; CTD+FIRe) in E. coli and mixed purified hSTING with biotinylated FP. In support of a direct interaction, FP co-precipitated with STING but not 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1), which was used as control (Fig. 4c,d). Addition of cellular lysate to the mix of recombinant STING and FP did not increase the interaction, suggesting no requirement for other cellular factors (Fig. 4c). Moreover, a direct interaction between STING and FP was confirmed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) (Fig. 4e). Together, these data demonstrate that IAV hemagglutinin interacts directly with STING through the FP in a manner dependent on a specific and conserved region in STING.",

We noted that Arg168 (Arg169 in hSTING) is located outside the STING dimerization surface, is facing away from the cGAMP-binding pocket, is surface exposed and is thus unlikely to be important for protein folding (Fig. 5a,b). Nevertheless, Arg168 is highly conserved among vertebrates23. To determine whether Arg168 was involved in signalling in responses to lipid membrane fusion and infection with RNA viruses, we reconstituted BMDCs and MEFs from STING-deficient mice with WT STING, R168A STING or eGFP. Similar transduction efficiency was obtained between WT and R168A constructs, and we also observed comparable distribution of WT and R168A STING in the reconstituted cells (Fig. 5c,d). The expression of either WT or R168A STING restored the responsiveness to cGAMP (Fig. 5e,f). By contrast, expression of WT but not R168A restored responsiveness to fusogenic liposomes (Fig. 5f). The opposite was observed when we tested STING-deficient cells reconstituted with R231A (Supplementary Fig. 7), which like R232 in human STING is essential for responsiveness to cyclic-di-nucleotides22. Thus, the fusion-STING and the cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathways can be functionally separated by the two mutants tested, and the R168A mutant provided a tool that enabled us to functionally study the fusion-STING pathway. Interestingly, when infected with VSV, production of progeny virus was reduced \u223c10-fold in cells expressing WT STING compared with R168A and eGFP-expressing cells (Fig. 5g). Moreover, type I interferon production in response to NDV was augmented by expression of WT but not R168A STING (Fig. 5h). VSV and NDV are both enveloped viruses. To determine whether R168A was also important for control of a naked RNA virus, we evaluated replication and interferon-\u03b2 mRNA expression during infection with the picornavirus encephalomyocarditis virus in these cell lines. Interestingly, expression of neither WT nor R168A STING affected the replication of encephalomyocarditis virus (Fig. 5i), and the modest induction of interferon-\u03b2 expression was independent of STING (Fig. 5j). Finally, we wanted to examine whether the IAV FP could antagonize the STING-dependent antiviral response against VSV. STING-deficient MEFs transduced with eGFP or WT STING were treated with vehicle or FP during infection. Interestingly, treatment with FP led to elevated viral replication in cells expressing STING but not in cells lacking STING expression (Fig. 5k). Collectively, these data show that sensing of lipid membrane fusion contributes to the antiviral response against enveloped RNA viruses and identifies the IAV FP as a viral strategy to counteract this defence mechanism.",

            "text": "The innate immune system is responsible for early protection against infections, and microorganisms have evolved mechanisms to evade innate immune responses to promote infection16. DNA viruses are detected by cGAS, which produces 2\u20323\u2032 cGAMP to activate STING through direct binding resulting in stimulation of the TBK1-IRF3-interferon pathway24. For RNA viruses, it is known that RIG-I and MDA5 detect viral genomic material to stimulate signalling via MAVS to the TBK1-IRF3-interferon pathway13. However, after infections at higher MOI, residual RLR-MAVS-independent interferon production has been observed252627. Moreover, full protection against RNA viruses also relies on STING9, and many RNA viruses have developed mechanisms to block STING-dependent signalling101112. Despite this, there is no knowledge on the nature of STING-dependent pathway that is important for innate responses to RNA viruses101112. Here we identify a STING-dependent but cGAS-independent pathway, which is stimulated by lipid membrane fusion, and is important for type I interferon expression in response to enveloped RNA viruses, including IAV. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the IAV HA2 FP targets this pathway through direct binding to STING and inhibition of STING dimerization and activation of TBK1 (Supplementary Fig. 8).",

These data suggest that the process of virus-cell membrane fusion is responsible for stimulation of STING-dependent signalling by enveloped RNA viruses. We previously reported that herpes simplex virus-like particles induce low-grade interferon-\u03b2 expression through fusion with the cell plasma membrane14, and the present data suggests that this mechanism is involved in mounting antiviral responses against enveloped but not naked RNA viruses.

Arg168 is located just outside the STING dimerization surface, is facing away from the cGAMP-binding pocket and is surface exposed467.

We found that hemagglutinin did co-localize with a small pool of STING early during infection, and STING was precipitated with hemagglutinin in cell lysates from infected cells. The observation that most STING did not co-localize with hemagglutinin could suggest that the STING\u2013hemagglutinin interaction is very transient in nature or that only the pool of STING engaged in sensing of fusion is targeted by hemagglutinin. Since STING needs to be activated to stimulate signalling, and the cGAS-STING pathway is not activated by RNA viruses, our data could suggest that hemagglutinin selectively targets the pool of STING recruited to endosomes, thus preventing fusion-stimulated signalling.",

Beads for precipitation studies were purchased from Life Technologies. Lipid blends containing DOTAP, DOPE and lissamine\u2013rhodamine DOPE in the w/w/w ratio 1/1/0.1 were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids and liposomes were prepared as described previously14. In brief, lipids were dissolved in chloroform in the indicated ratios. Chloroform was then evaporated under inert gas pressure leaving a thin lipid film. Liposomes were formed by hydrating the lipid film with phosphate-buffered saline. Uniform size of liposomes weas achieved by passing the hydrated lipids through a 0.2 \u03bcm pore filter using a mini-extruder purchased from Avanti Polar lipids. FP GLFGAIAGFIENGWEGC from IAV (FP)20. A tail of GGEKEKEK was added to the peptide to achieve solubility. Peptides were produced as covalent homodimers linked through sulfur bridges. Sequence of deletion peptide FPDI6 was GLFGAAGFIENGWEGC. Peptides were purchased from the company Schafer-N. STING-GFP expressing iBMDMs were kindly donated by Dr Melanie Brinkmann (Braunschweig, Germany). IAV was purchased from ATCC (H1N1, PR8). VSV was of the Indiana strain and NDV and SeV were kindly provided by professor Peter Palese29 and professor Illka Julkunen, respectively. BMDCs were prepared by 7-day culturing of bone marrow cells with GM-CSF and then collecting non-adherent cells. STING- and cGAS-deficient MEF were obtained from embryos of Golden ticket and cGAS\u2212/\u2212 mice at E13.5. Primary cells were transformed with lentivirus containing SV40 and positive cells were selected with puromycin. Transformed cells were re-infected with lentivirus containing lentiviral expression system for STING or mutant forms of STING. For lentiviral reconstitution of STING expression in BMDCs from STING-deficient mice, bone marrow was collected and placed in culture supplemented with GM-CSF. Next day lentivirus was added to the cultures. Cells were cultured with GM-CSF until day 7 whereupon the non-adherent cells were collected. For stimulation of cell cultures with IAV, PR8 strain was used at a MOI of 60 HAU per 106 cells for 20 h.",

We used a lentiviral CRISPR/Cas9 vector30 encoding a codon-optimized nuclear-localized Cas9 gene N-terminally fused to PuroR via a T2A ribsome-skipping sequence. In addition, the vector contains a human U6 promoter driving expression of a guideRNA consisting of a gene-specific CRISPR RNA (crRNA) fused to the trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) and a terminator sequence. The gene-specific crRNA sequences cloned were: 5\u2032-GAGTAGCGCGAGCACAGCTA-3\u2032 for B2M, 5\u2032-GAGCACACTCTCCGGTACC-3\u2032 for STING and 5\u2032-GACTCGGTGGGATCCATCG-3\u2032 for cGAS. THP1 cells were transduced with CRISPR/Cas9 lentivirus, and selected with 2 \u03bcg ml\u22121 puromycin for 2 weeks. Cells were subsequently cloned by limiting dilution, and individual clones were subjected to western blotting to confirm absence of the targeted gene products. The MAVS-deficient THP-1-derived cells were generated as described previously31. In brief, THP-1-KO cells were generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. A plasmid containing mCherry Cas9 and a U6 promoter-driven guideRNA against STING, MAVS or cGAS was electroporated into THP-1 cells under the following conditions: 5 \u03bcg plasmid were mixed with 250 \u03bcl cell suspension (10 \u00d7 106 ml\u22121 in OptiMEM) and electroporated at 950 \u03bcF and 250 V. Cells were FACS sorted for mCherry expression 24 h after electroporation. Positive cells were diluted under limiting conditions and plated in 96-well plates to obtain single-cell clones. The genotype of THP-1 clones was analysed by deep sequencing (Illumina, MiSeq).",

Virus production was determined by end point titration. WT or Stinggt/gt cells infected with EMCV (MOI 0.1) for 6 h were lysed and total RNA was analysed for levels of interferon-\u03b2 mRNA, normalized to \u03b2-actin and presented as normalized ratios relative to uninfected controls. (k) MEFs from C57BL/6 and STINGgt/gt mice were pretreated with 10 \u03bcM of FP and infected VSV (MOI 0.01). Supernatants were isolated 20 h later and viral titres were quantified by end point titration. The numerical data are presented as means of four biological replicates (\u00b1s.d.). *P<0.05 by Mann\u2013Whitney compared-ranks test. IFN, interferon; HA, hemagglutinin.
