            "text": "Recently, Siebert, et al. 29 reported that miR\u2010127\u20105p targeted SCARB2 3\u2032 UTR and reduced the protein expression of SCARB2. As a cellular receptor, SCARB2 can facilitate efficient EV71 infection 35. Firstly, we observed the differential surface expression of SCARB2 on HeLa and HepG2 cells (Fig. 1A), and showed that this differential expression of SCARB2 appears to impact on the susceptibility of HeLa and HepG2 cells to EV71 infection (Fig. 1B). We found that the progression of cytopathic effects in HepG2 cells was slower than that in HeLa cells, suggesting that the efficiency of EV71 infection was correlated with the level of cell surface SCARB2 expression (Fig. 1A,B). Additionally, we also found that HeLa cells expressed a relative lower level of miR\u2010127\u20105p (Fig. 1C). We then investigated if miR\u2010127\u20105p directly suppresses SCARB2 expression by transfecting miR\u2010127\u20105p mimics into both HeLa and HepG2 cells, and then measuring the expression of both SCARB2 mRNA and the protein. We found that miR\u2010127\u20105p mimics significantly reduced both the mRNA level (Fig. 1D) and protein expression of SCARB2 (Fig. 1E), consistent with the previous observations obtained from different cell lines 29. Consistent with above observation, a miR\u2010127\u20105p inhibitor significantly increased mRNA level (Fig. 1F) and protein expression of SCARB2 (Fig. 1G), as compared to the negative control. To further verify that the downregulation of SCARB2 expression is due to targeting by miR\u2010127\u20105p, we performed a bioinformatic search using microRNA (http://www.microrna.org/ to identify putative binding site and identified two seed regions at the 3\u2032 UTR of SCARB2 (nucleotides 369\u2013374 and 484\u2013490) that may bind miR\u2010127\u20105p. In order to demonstrate that the binding sites are specific, we constructed expression plasmids of SCARB2 wild\u2010type/mutant 3\u2032 UTR containing the putative miR\u2010127\u20105p\u2010binding sites by cloning into the pmirGLO reporter vector. Mutant reporter constructs were generated with underlined nucleotides indicating the mutated sequences as shown in Fig. 1H. We cotransfected pmirGLO plasmid into 293T cells, along with miR\u2010127\u20105p mimics or negative control mimics. The luciferase activity of SCARB2 3\u2032 UTR wt was significantly reduced in 293T cells treated with miR\u2010127\u20105p mimics, whereas the SCARB2 3\u2032 UTR mut1 or SCARB2 3\u2032 UTR mut2 partly reversed the inhibition of luciferase activity by miR\u2010127\u20105p mimics. Additionally, the luciferase activity in the cells transfected with the SCARB2 3\u2032 UTR mut1/2 vector was unaffected by the miR\u2010127\u20105p mimics (Fig. 1I). This result was in agreement with a previous study showing that miR\u2010127\u20105p had effect on the luciferase activity of pMir\u2010SCARB2 3\u2032 UTR plasmid 29. In summary, these data suggested that SCARB2 is a direct target of miR\u2010127\u20105p and that its expression is modulated by miR\u2010127\u20105p.",

Similarly, our results have confirmed that miR\u2010127\u20105p could suppress the SCARB2 expression (Fig. 1A,B). To further substantiate whether modulation of miR\u2010127\u20105p expression would affect the surface expression of SCARB2, we transfected miR\u2010127\u20105p mimics into both HeLa and HepG2 cells, and then analyzed by flow cytometry. The result suggested that upregulation of the miR\u2010127\u20105p level led to a decrease in the surface expression of SCARB2 (Fig. 3A). Therefore, it is of interest to evaluate the effect of miR\u2010127\u20105p on EV71 replication. For this purpose, miR\u2010127\u20105p was overexpressed by miRNA mimics transfection and its effect on EV71 replication was assessed by measuring EV71 VP1 expression, the viral RNA level, viral titer, and percentage of infected cells. EV71 VP1 protein decreased in both HeLa and HepG2 cells overexpressing miR\u2010127\u20105p, as compared to the negative control cells (Fig. 3B). The levels of SCARB2 mRNA (Fig. 3C) and EV71 RNA (Fig. 3D) in cells transfected with miR\u2010127\u20105p mimics were significantly reduced. The EV71 titers at various times postinfection were also significantly suppressed by miR\u2010127\u20105p overexpression, as compared to the control (Fig. 3E). Immunofluorescence staining of viral VP1 showed that the percentage of infected cells in cells overexpressing miR\u2010127\u20105p was reduced by nearly 50%, as compared to the control, at 24 h postinfection (Fig. 3F). When HeLa cells were transfected with increasing concentrations of miR\u2010127\u20105p mimics (10, 20, 40, and 50 nm), followed by EV71 infection, both SCARB2 mRNA and protein levels, as well as EV71 VP1 protein, were inhibited as a function of the dose of miR\u2010127\u20105p mimics (Fig. 3G). These results showed that miR\u2010127\u20105p overexpression downregulated SCARB2 expression and thus significantly reduced EV71 infection.",

In order to rule out the possibility that EV71 genomic RNA is targeted by miR\u2010127\u20105p in our research, studies were carried out to determine if EV71 genomic RNA contains potential target sequences for miR\u2010127\u20105p. It had been demonstrated that hSCARB2, but not mScarb2, bound efficiently to EV71 41. Mouse L929 cells are not susceptible to EV71 infection and allow only inefficient EV71 infection, because they lack the cellular receptor 21, 24, 35. In this study, we used L929 cells to investigate whether EV71 replication initiated by transfection of infectious viral genomic RNA is affected by miR\u2010127\u20105p. High level of miR\u2010127\u20105p was detected in miR\u2010127\u20105p\u2010transfected L929 cells, suggesting that the miR\u2010127\u20105p was efficiently incorporated intracellularly (Fig. 5B).

In addition, EV71 VP1 expression showed no difference between the cells overexpressing miR\u2010127\u20105p and the control cells (Fig. 5D).

Recently, a study demonstrated that human miR\u2010127\u20105p significantly downregulated SCARB2 protein level by directly targeting SCARB2 mRNA 29. As an important receptor for EV71, reduction in SCARB2 may prevent viral entry during primary infection. Thus, it is plausible to assume that miR\u2010127\u20105p may impact EV71 infection by regulating SCARB2 expression. In the current study, we first analyzed the influence of miR\u2010127\u20105p mimics (Fig. 1E) or inhibitor (Fig. 1F) on the total cellular SCARB2 level by western blotting. Because SCARB2 is a lysosomal protein, and the majority of the protein is located in the lysosome and endosomes, these results will be difficult to accurately reflect the change of surface SCARB2. Therefore, we performed the flow cytometric analysis of the cell surface SCARB2 expression, and the data indicated that overexpression of miR\u2010127\u20105p significantly inhibited the surface SCARB2 expression (Fig. 3A), while inhibition of endogenous miR\u2010127\u20105p significantly elevated the surface SCARB2 (Fig. 4A). Consistently, overexpression of miR\u2010127\u20105p or inhibition of endogenous miRNA\u2010127\u20105p resulted in repressed (Fig. 3B) or enhanced (Fig. 4B) production of EV71, respectively. Results from dual\u2010luciferase assay validated that miR\u2010127\u20105p targeted SCARB2 and thus inhibited protein translation of SCARB2. Studies with SCARB2 mutants and the inability of miR\u2010127\u20105p in inhibition of EV71 replication in L929 cells (Fig. 5B\u2013D) suggested that this miR\u2010127\u20105p\u2010mediated downregulation of SCARB2 was specific and miR\u2010127\u20105p did not target at intracellular or viral sequences.",

To our knowledge this is the first study describing the role of microRNAs in regulating SCARB2 expression during EV71 infection. Endogenous miRNAs may possess advantages over siRNAs on safety and fewer side effects. The current study provides a new perspective for miRNA\u2010mediated antiviral effects and contributes to the better understanding of host\u2013virus interaction mechanisms.",
