About 80% of those infected with ZIKV presented with asymptomatic, or only mild illness (Petersen E. et al., 2016; Pierson and Diamond, 2018). However, ZIKV infection has been associated with more severe complications: Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 Syndrome in adult (Brasil et al., 2016; Peixoto et al., 2019) and congenital Zika syndrome in fetus and infant (Baud et al., 2017b; Gurung et al., 2019).",

It is reported that ZIKV was transmitted through sexual contact, perhaps up to 41 days after the onset of symptoms (Turmel et al., 2016), and infective virions were still isolated from semen 69 days after infection (Arsuaga et al., 2016; Garcia-Bujalance et al., 2017). The viral load in semen was 100,000 times that in the blood at 2 weeks post-infection (Mansuy et al., 2016), and viral RNA was still detected up to 370 days after illness onset (Barzon et al., 2018). It is also reported that ZIKV infection caused patients to have a decreasing total sperm count in the acute phase of infection (Joguet et al., 2017) and abnormal spermogram results 1 year after infection (Avelino-Silva et al., 2018), suggesting ZIKV was harmful to human spermatozoa production. Testis explants from uninfected donors were also proven to be susceptible to ZIKV infection (Matusali et al., 2018). As determined from an in vitro human testicular organoid culture system, ZIKV-infected testicular organoids may lead to multiple kinds of cell death (Strange et al., 2018). Although little was known about ZIKV infection in human testis and epididymis, except for semen, many murine models were used to study damage to testicular tissue. Govero et al. (2016) performed a study in wild-type C57BL/6 mice in the presence of the anti-Ifnar1 antibody and revealed that ZIKV preferentially infected spermatogonia and Sertoli cells in the testis. This led to cell death and destruction of the seminiferous tubules in association with testis damage and poor sperm quality (Govero et al., 2016). Ma et al. (2017) also established a mouse model using IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor-deficient mice (Ifnar1\u2013/\u2013 knockout mice), and demonstrated that ZIKV infection induced inflammation in the testis and epididymis, leading to severe damage to testes at 60 days post-infection. Taken together, these findings suggested that ZIKV could persist in testicular tissue for a long time, causing severe damage to testis and epididymis and reducing sperm quality.",

            "text": "Currently, no approved drug is available to inhibit ZIKV infection (da Silva et al., 2018), especially infection in testicular tissue. Ebselen (EBS), an antioxidant in clinical trials, was reported to alleviate testicular pathology in ZIKV-infected mice by reducing the level of oxidative stress and proinflammatory cytokines. However, it only had a weak effect on ZIKV directly, and its safety for pregnant women was unknown (Simanjuntak et al., 2018). This calls for the development of safe and effective drugs to prevent ZIKV-induced testicular damage. The testis is a male reproductive organ, mainly producing spermatozoa and androgen. Specifically, spermatogenesis is a complex cellular event taking place in the seminiferous epithelium of seminiferous tubules and protected by Sertoli cells that form the blood\u2013testes barrier (BTB) by tight junction protein (Su et al., 2011). The BTB provides a specialized microenvironment for spermatogenesis by preventing harmful agents from entering the seminiferous tubule, but this was found to pose a major obstacle to the delivery of therapeutic drugs to the seminiferous epithelium (Cheng and Mruk, 2012). Therefore, any drug able to prevent ZIKV-induced damage in testicular tissue should be able to cross the BTB into seminiferous tubules, or reach the testicular tissue, to inhibit ZIKV from entering into seminiferous tubules. The most promising anti-ZIKV drugs so far include small-molecule compounds (Deng et al., 2016a; Chan et al., 2017; Li et al., 2017), antibodies (Zhang et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2017, 2019), and peptides (Yu et al., 2017; Jackman et al., 2018). Compared with small-molecule compounds, peptides were safer, especially for pregnant women. As a macromolecular substance, passing through the BTB was challenging for antibodies, and it is reported that the concentration of specific IgG entering into the rete testis was 0.6% of that in blood serum (Knee et al., 2005). Therefore, the safer and cheaper peptide drugs, which consisted of dozens of amino acids, began to gain gradual acceptance. We previously demonstrated that an amphipathic peptide Z2, derived from the stem region of ZIKV E protein (Figure 1A), inhibited ZIKV infection in vivo and in vitro, suggesting its promise as an anti-ZIKV candidate drug. What\u2019s more, Z2 had a protective effect in pregnant mice and their fetuses, suggesting it was able to cross the placental barrier (Yu et al., 2017). However, whether Z2 could enter the seminiferous tubules and protect testicular tissue against ZIKV infection remained unknown.",

ZIKV SZ01 (Asian lineage), FLR (Asian lineage), or MR766 (African lineage) was pretreated with Z2 at different concentration before addition of TM4 cells and incubation at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. After replacement of culture medium and further incubation for 48 h, the viral copies in the supernatant were examined by qRT-PCR. As shown in Figures 1B\u2013D, Z2 treatment resulted in a decrease of ZIKV copies in a dose-dependent manner. Considering that Z2-mediated inhibition of ZIKV infection is possibly attributed to its viral inactivation activity (Yu et al., 2017), different strains of ZIKV were incubated with Z2 at different concentration for 2 h at 37\u00b0C, followed by separating virions from the unbound free peptide by PEG 8000 and detecting the infectivity of Z2-treated ZIKV in TM4 cells (Figure 1E) and BHK-21 cells (Supplementary Figure S1). We found that Z2-treated ZIKV strains lost their infectivity in a dose-dependent manner with 50% effective concentration (EC50) of 2.74 \u00b1 0.44 \u03bcM (for SZ01), 10.21 \u00b1 1.00 \u03bcM (for MR766) and 8.96 \u00b1 0.95 \u03bcM (for FLR), respectively, suggesting that Z2 inhibits infection of ZIKV strains of both Asian and African lineages in TM4 and BHK-21 cells via inactivation of virions.",

As expected, both testes and epididymides of mice treated with Z2-Cy5 showed a strong fluorescence signal, while those in the PBS-treated mice displayed no significant fluorescence signal (Figure 2C). The average radiant efficiency in testes and epididymides of Z2-Cy5-treated mice was significantly higher than that of PBS-treated mice (P < 0.0001, Student\u2019s two-tailed t-test; Figures 2D,E).

The infected mice were i.p. administered with Z2 at 15 mg/kg of body weight or vehicle, respectively, daily for 7 days (Figure 3A). Mice in the mock-infected group received PBS as normal control. Results showed that the Z2-treated mice had neither weight loss (Figure 3B) nor obvious clinical symptoms, consistent with mice in the mock-infected group (data not shown). However, in the vehicle-treated group, mouse body weight began to decline from the fifth day post-infection (d.p.i.) (Figure 3B), and some symptoms, like hunched posture and ruffled fur, appeared. We then examined viral copies in sera of Z2- or vehicle-treated mice at different time points by qRT-PCR. A high level of viral load was detected in sera of vehicle-treated mice, e.g., about 1010 copies/ml at 3 d.p.i. (Figure 3C). However, viral load in sera of Z2-treated mice (Figure 3C) was as low as 104 copies/ml at all time points tested, significantly lower than that of vehicle-treated mice. These results suggest that Z2 can exert protection against ZIKV infection of male mice.",

            "text": "Finally, to examine the safety of Z2 for male mice, male BALB/c mice were injected intravenously with Z2 at 100 mg/kg of body weight (n = 5) or PBS (n = 5). Results showed that body weight change of mice was nearly consistent in the two groups (Figure 7A), indicating that Z2 peptide did not cause significant harm to the male mice. Since the levels of testosterone and inhibin B reflect testicular function and sperm count, the concentration of these hormones in mouse sera at the indicated time points was measured. We found no significant difference between the Z2- and PBS-treated groups at all time points tested (Figures 7B,C), suggesting Z2 may not affect the function of testis or sperm. We then compared the potential histopathological changes between the two groups. As shown in Figure 7D, H&E analysis of testis and epididymis revealed no obvious pathological abnormality in mice treated with Z2 compared with the PBS group. Besides, the titer of Z2-specific antibody in sera of mice at 14 and 30 days post-injection was detected. As shown in Figures 7E,F, no significant level of Z2-specific antibody was detected in the sera of mice that were intravenously injected with high doses of Z2 peptide, consistent with the finding from our previous report for studying anti-MERS-CoV peptides (Xia et al., 2019). This result suggests that Z2 peptide consisting of 33 amino acids is unable to elicit a significant Z2-specific antibody response after it is intravenously administered in the absence of adjuvant. Therefore, Z2 is safe for male mice, especially for their testicular tissue.",

Two DNA vaccines were reported to reduce ZIKV persistence in the testicular tissue and ZIKV-associated pathological lesion (Griffin et al., 2017), or partially prevent infertility of male mice (de La Vega et al., 2018). However, no effective and safe antiviral agent has ever been reported to prevent or treat ZIKV infection in testicular tissue. Our previous study has demonstrated that Z2 peptide is highly effective in inhibiting ZIKV infection in vivo and in vitro (Yu et al., 2017). Noticeably, it can penetrate the placental barrier to inhibit vertical transmission of ZIKV in pregnant mice. However, whether Z2 could cross the BTB and protect testicular tissue against ZIKV infection remained unknown.",

We found that Z2 peptide possesses potent antiviral activity against ZIKV infection in BHK-21 and Vero cells (Yu et al., 2017). In this study, we found that Z2 was also highly effective in inhibiting infection of divergent ZIKV strains with Asian and African lineages in TM4 cells, the mouse Sertoli cell line. Particularly, Z2 treatment via intraperitoneal injection resulted in dramatically decreased ZIKV RNA level in the testis of A129 mice, suggesting that Z2 can protect testis against ZIKV infection in Sertoli cells.",

However, because of the intricate structure of capillary vessel and seminiferous tubule in mouse testis, we could not obtain sufficient evidence to prove that Z2 crossed BTB into seminiferous tubule. H&E analysis showed no obvious pathological damage in the testicular tissue of Z2-treated mice, but it did reveal severe pathological damage in the testis and epididymis of vehicle-treated mice, consistent with the findings of other studies (Govero et al., 2016; Ma et al., 2017). When combined with evidence that viral load in mature sperm of Z2-treated A129 mice was significantly decreased, we speculate that Z2 may, indeed, cross the BTB and enter seminiferous tubule to inhibit ZIKV infection in the sperm.",

In addition, ZIKV in semen of an infected male can be sexually transmitted to his pregnant partner (Russell et al., 2017; Nelson et al., 2018), who can further pass the virus to her fetus, causing congenital Zika syndrome in the newborn (Yarrington et al., 2019). Sexual transmission may also contribute to the spread of ZIKV in regions where the Aedes mosquito is not endemic (Rowland et al., 2016). Here we found that Z2 treatment could significantly reduce viral load in sperm of ZIKV-infected A129 mice and improve the number and motility of sperm, implying that application of Z2 can limit the damage to testicular tissue and sperm caused by ZIKV infection and reduce the risk of sexual transmission of ZIKV.",
