NiV is a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that is a member of the genus Henipavirus (family Paramyxoviridae). NiV was first identified during a large outbreak affecting humans and pigs in Malaysia and Singapore in 1999 [1]. From 2001 onwards, seasonal outbreaks are observed almost annually in Bangladesh and sporadically in India [2]. Recent outbreaks occurred in Kerala in May 2018 and June 2019, the first time NiV emerged in southern India [2]. Two strains of NiV have been identified, Malaysia and Bangladesh strains, which share 91.8% sequence homology [3]. NiV causes severe respiratory disease and encephalitis [4,5,6], with average case fatality rates (CFR) of 40\u201375% [7]. Moreover, long-term neurological sequelae and even relapse of encephalitis are observed in many survivors of infections with both strains of NiV [8,9,10].",

NiV can infect humans via several routes, which include the consumption of food contaminated with bat secretions [16], transmission from amplification hosts such as pigs [4], and direct human-to-human transmission between very close contacts [17]. Currently there are no licensed treatments or preventative vaccines available for use in humans, which make the development of effective prophylactic measures imperative.",

The G glycoproteins of NiV and HeV share 83% amino acid sequence homology and are type II transmembrane proteins [18]. The glycoproteins of both viruses bind to the host cell receptors ephrin-B2 and ephrin-B3 [19,20,21,22], which are highly conserved across many species [23]. To date, the most promising therapeutic approach against Henipavirus infection is the one based on the application of the experimental human monoclonal antibody m102.4, which binds the ephrin-B2 and ephrin-B3 receptor-binding site on the glycoproteins of HeV (HeV-G) and NiV (NiV-G) [24]. The protective efficacy of m102.4 has been successfully evaluated in different preclinical models including ferrets and African green monkeys (AGM) [25,26,27].",

The candidate vaccines were genetically stable and efficiently replicated in primary chicken embryo fibroblasts, a cell culture system used for manufacturing of MVA vaccines. Importantly, vaccination of mice lacking the interferon alpha/beta receptor (IFNAR\u2212/\u2212) elicited readily detectable NiV-G-specific CD8 and CD4 T cells. We identified a potential H2-b-restricted epitope in the NiV-G that stimulated antigen-specific CD8 T cells and a potential H2-IAb-restricted epitope that stimulated antigen-specific CD4 T cells. Interestingly, in comparison with full-length NiV-G, the soluble antigen NiVsG induced significantly stronger epitope-specific T cell responses. Our work will be relevant for future studies characterizing NiV-G-specific T cell responses in NiV preclinical models.",

Resultant vector virus isolates were quality controlled using standard protocols [54]. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of genomic viral DNA served to confirm the genetic identity and genomic stability of the MVA vector viruses. The replicative capacity of the recombinant MVA\u2013NiV viruses compared with nonrecombinant MVA was tested by multi-step growth experiments in CEF and human HeLa cells. To generate vaccine preparations, recombinant MVA\u2013NiV viruses were amplified in CEF, purified by ultracentrifugation through 36% sucrose cushions, and reconstituted in 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 9.0, to make stock preparations [54].",

Our peptide library consisted of 15mer peptides that overlapped by 11mer. All peptides were synthesized by Thermo Fisher Scientific as crude material (<50% purity) on a 1\u20134 mg scale. The two-dimensional peptide pool matrix system was used for screening [56,57]. Briefly, peptides were organized into two-dimensional matrix peptide pools (H1\u2013H10 and V1\u2013V11) containing 11\u201313 peptides. For mapping of potential CD8 T cell epitopes in positive 15mer peptides, every possible sequence of peptides 8\u201311mer in length was determined. Theoretical peptides were then analyzed for binding to the mouse major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I allele H2-b using the SYFPEITHI database. The peptides of each amino acid sequence length were synthesized and tested. For identification of CD4 T cell epitopes, MHC class II binding predictions were performed on 15mer peptides found within positive peptide pools identified by IFN-\u03b3 Enzyme-Linked Immunospot assay (ELISPOT). Using the MHC Class II Binding, T Cell Epitope Prediction resource of the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB, https://www.iedb.org/), peptides restricted to mouse MHC class II allele H2-IAb were analyzed using \u201cIEDB Recommended\u201d prediction method [58]. The most promising candidates were then chosen for further experimental epitope prediction studies. All peptides were dissolved to a concentration of 2 mg/mL in PBS, aliquoted, and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until use.",

These synthetic gene sequences were placed under the transcriptional control of the vaccinia virus-specific promoters Pvgf or PmH5 and introduced into the MVA genome by homologous recombination targeting the intergenic site between the essential MVA genes 069 and 070L. The clonal isolation of the recombinant viruses MVA\u2013NiVsG and MVA\u2013NiV-G was facilitated by the co-production of the green fluorescent reporter protein (GFP), as previously described [54]. The final recombinant viruses containing the NiV-G gene sequences (MVA\u2013NiV-G and MVA\u2013NiVsG) were obtained after removal of the GFP reporter gene by intragenomic homologous recombination (Figure S1A, marker gene deletion). To verify the identity of the desired modification, we performed the standard quality control experiments as described previously [54]. PCR analysis of viral genomic DNA confirmed the proper insertion of the recombinant gene sequences at the target site in the genome of MVA (Figure S1B\u2013E) and the genetic characteristics and stability of the recombinant MVA viruses. We assessed the growth behavior of the recombinant viruses MVA\u2013NiVsG and MVA\u2013NiV-G in multi-step growth analyses in human HeLa cells and primary CEF, which are routinely used for amplification of recombinant MVA in vaccine manufacturing (Figure S1F). MVA\u2013NiVsG and MVA\u2013NiV-G efficiently replicated in CEF and demonstrated an increase of infectivity titers that was comparable to that obtained with nonrecombinant MVA. However, MVA\u2013NiV-G and MVA\u2013NiVsG did not productively grow in human HeLa cells, confirming that they had retained the characteristic replication deficiency of MVA in cells of mammalian origin. These findings corroborated the expected MVA phenotype and confirmed that the recombinant viruses could be handled under laboratory conditions of biosafety level 1. Of note, we originally generated another recombinant MVA virus using the synthetic early\u2013late promoter PmH5 for transcriptional control of recombinant gene expression and production of the full-length NiV-G protein. However, upon growth testing, this candidate virus failed to reach levels of infectious progeny in CEF to be eligible for large-scale amplification as needed for vaccine production processes.",

NiV-G is a 602 amino acid long protein consisting of an N-terminal internal domain, a transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal external domain (Figure 1A). For NiVsG protein, an internal leader sequence and three amino acid linkers have replaced the internal and transmembrane domains (Figure 1A), as described previously [19,48]. We assessed the correct expression and studied the cellular localization of the NiV-G and NiVsG by immunofluorescence microscopy of MVA\u2013NiV-infected cells immunolabeled with anti-NiV-G antibody, followed by a fluorescently labelled secondary antibody. Cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (300 nM). As anticipated, we observed different patterns of green fluorescence, with varying cellular localizations depending on the MVA\u2013NiV construct. Green fluorescence, specific for NiV-G, was identified in permeabilized and nonpermeabilized cells infected with MVA\u2013NiV-G (Figure 1B), but not in MVA-infected or mock control cells. This data confirmed that the recombinant full-length NiV-G protein encoded by MVA\u2013NiV-G was indeed anchored on the cell surface. In contrast, the NiV-G-specific staining in cells infected with MVA\u2013NiVsG virus appeared to be predominantly located within the cells and was readily detected after permeabilization. As anticipated, we failed to detect NiVsG in considerable amounts without permeabilization, confirming that NiVsG was not expressed on the cell surface (Figure 1B).",

Total cell lysates or culture supernatants obtained from CEF and HeLa cultures infected with recombinant MVA virus were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted.

IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice on a C57BL/6 background (MHC I = H2-Db/H2-Kb (H2-b) and MHC II = H2-IAb) were immunized twice with the MVA\u2013NiVsG candidate vaccine via the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route, and splenocytes were prepared 8 days after the final inoculation, CD4 and CD8 T cells were purified and restimulated with overlapping 15mer peptides corresponding to the NiV-G protein. We pooled overlapping peptides using a two-dimensional peptide matrix system (Figure 3A) and screened for their ability to induce IFN-\u03b3 by ELISPOT. IFN-\u03b3 production above background levels was observed after stimulation with 2 out of the 21 peptide pools tested (Figure 3B). CD8 T cells from mice immunized with MVA\u2013NiVsG, but not the MVA and mock groups, showed elevated numbers of IFN-\u03b3 spot-forming counts (SFC) after stimulation with peptide pools V1 and H1 (Figure 3B). In the next step, the peptides within the V1 and H1 peptide pools were used to characterize the T cell epitope specificities in more detail. For this, pools V1 (V1A and V1B) and H1 (H1A and H1B) were subdivided into subpools containing 5\u20137 peptides each. Since two 15mer peptides were shared between the pools, #1 (G73\u201387 = YTRSTDNQAVIKDAL) and #2 (G77\u201391 = TDNQAVIKDALQGIQ), these peptides were also tested separately. For this experiment, we used an identical immunization protocol and splenic CD8 T cell purification procedure. CD8 T cells from these mice were restimulated with the above subpools and individual peptides #1 and #2. Stimulation with the subpools H1A and V1A resulted in IFN- \u03b3 production above background levels in the MVA\u2013NiVsG group with IFN-\u03b3 SFC mean \u00b1 SEM values of 455 \u00b1 99 and 271 \u00b1 74 IFN-\u03b3 SFC/106 splenocytes, respectively (Figure 1C). Subpools H1B and V1B, however, did not stimulate CD8 T cells in the MVA\u2013NiVsG group. Stimulation of CD8 T cells with individual peptides #1 and #2, which were present in subpools H1A and V1A, resulted in different outcomes. IFN-\u03b3 production above the background was observed in cultures stimulated with #1 (mean = 349 \u00b1 87 SFC/106 cells), but not #2, in the MVA\u2013NiVsG group. These data suggested that the 15mer peptide #1 contained peptide sequences that stimulated NiV-G-specific CD8 T cells.",

In addition, the sequence of peptide 8.4 (STDNQAVI) was present in the eight positive peptides. To characterize the induction of IFN-\u03b3 SFC by these peptides in more detail, IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice were vaccinated twice via the i.m. route, a commonly used route for human vaccinations, and in vitro stimulated splenocytes were analyzed by ELISPOT assay.

The six peptides tested significantly stimulated the activation of IFN-\u03b3 in the MVA\u2013NiVsG group relative to the MVA and PBS controls (Figure 4C). Mean SFC values, however, did not show statistically significant variations between each individual peptide.

Next, we used IFN-\u03b3 ICS to identify directly antigen-specific CD4 T cells after stimulation with these peptides. For this, splenocytes from mice that had been vaccinated with MVA\u2013NiV-G or MVA\u2013NiVsG were stimulated with peptides #49 and #50 and analyzed by flow cytometry. A small population of peptide-specific IFN-\u03b3+ CD4 T cells was observed in the MVA\u2013NiVsG and MVA\u2013NiV-G groups (Figure 6B). Due to low frequencies of IFN-\u03b3-producing cells, we chose a cut off value of 0.1% to differentiate between positive signals and background. Overall, CD4 T cells from the MVA\u2013NiVsG group had a frequency of IFN-\u03b3+ above the cut off relative to MVA\u2013NiV-G group (Figure 6C). The mean percentage of IFN-\u03b3+ CD4 T cells for the two peptides was 0.09\u20130.17% and 0.04\u20130.07% for MVA\u2013NiVsG and MVA\u2013NiV-G, respectively. Moreover, the frequency and absolute number of IFN-\u03b3-producing CD4 T cells in peptide #50 stimulated cultures was significantly higher in the MVA\u2013NiVsG group when compared with the MVA\u2013NiV-G group (mean = 290 \u00b1 65 and 140 \u00b1 46 cells/106 splenocytes respectively). For peptide #49, MVA\u2013NiVsG vaccinated mice showed a significantly elevated frequency of IFN-\u03b3+ CD4 T cells only. In conclusion, our data indicate that peptide #50 (NVWTPPNPNTVYHCS) is a promising H2-IAb-restricted CD4 T cell epitope candidate of NiV-G. The alignment of the peptide to the full amino acid sequence of wild-type NiV-G is shown in Figure S3.",

            "text": "The continuous threat of suddenly emerging NiV outbreaks, particularly in Bangladesh and India, demonstrate the need for countermeasure approaches ready to use in an immediate public health response. At present, there are no licensed NiV vaccines for use in humans available. The existence of a NiV candidate vaccine should significantly reduce the risk of infection and transmission of the virus in the case of an outbreak scenario. There are some experimental NiV vaccines that have already been tested in different preclinical animal models. The major focus of these approaches was to evaluate the immunogenicity and efficacy in the context of NiV challenge infection. In those studies, efficacy has been mostly associated with the generation of NiV-specific antibodies, and immune monitoring is mainly relying on the detection of virus-neutralizing antibodies [31,60,61]. However, there is relatively little known about the induction and the relevance of NiV-specific cellular immune responses. In that context, the availability of appropriate tools to investigate the role of T cells in NiV-specific immunity is an important prerequisite in the development of new vaccines and therapeutics. Thus, it will be indispensable to monitor in animal models the contribution of virus-specific T cells to protective immunity but also to potential NiV antigen-specific immune pathology.",

            "text": "Here, we identified a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) haplotype H2-b-restricted peptide epitope in the NiV-G protein by stimulating T cells from MVA\u2212NiVsG vaccinated IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice with a two-dimensional (2D) matrix pool of overlapping peptides. IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice have been already established as a valuable preclinical animal model for NiV infection with a LD50 of 8 \u00d7 103 pfu after intraperitoneal challenge infection [15]. Moreover, in previous studies, we have already successfully demonstrated that interferon type I receptor knockout mice (IFNAR\u2212/\u2212) [47] can be readily used as animal models to study the immunogenicity and protective capacity of MVA immunization [62,63]. Here, we wished to specifically assess the ability of MVA-delivered NiV-G antigen to induce the activation of cellular immune responses in mice. In general, the envelope G protein is known as the well-conserved attachment glycoprotein for both HeV and NiV. In a previous study, a recombinant adeno-associated virus vaccine expressing a full-length NiV-G protein protected hamsters in an NiV infection model [38]. In another approach, a soluble version of HeV-G has been engineered and showed an even more advantageous efficacy when tested in different preclinical animal models [42,43,64]. Using HeVsG, a monoclonal antibody m102.4 was derived and has already been successfully tested as a therapeutic approach in humans. To further enhance Henipavirus G protein-induced immunogenicity, we also designed and tested a soluble version of the NiV-G protein (NiVsG) similar to the HeVsG antigen used for the generation of m102.4. To comparatively evaluate the immunogenicity of the NiVsG protein, we also generated an MVA expressing full-length G. The recombinant viruses MVA\u2013NiV-G and MVA\u2013NiVsG produced stable amounts of NiV-G antigen upon in vitro infection of human cells, indicating the unimpaired expression of the target gene under transcriptional control of the synthetic vaccinia virus-specific early\u2013late promoter PmH5 or the strong natural early promoter Pvgf. In the case of MVA\u2013NiVsG, removal of the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail resulted in the secretion of the NiV-G from MVA-infected cells and accumulation also in the supernatant of cell cultures, as demonstrated in Western blot analysis and immunostaining. A similar result was obtained with HeVsG, as expressed by conventional recombinant VACV [41]. In contrast, the full-length MVA-produced NiV-G protein was not released in the supernatant, indicating the stable presentation on the cell surface through the transmembrane domains. Another important aspect of proper protein expression, folding and conformational stability is influenced by the N-glycans. Recent studies indicated that NiV-G N-glycans reduce fusion efficiency because removal of some N-glycans caused cell\u2013cell hyperfusogenicity and increased viral entry [65]. Glycosidase treatment of full-length MVA-produced NiV-G resulted in a polypeptide of 58 kDa, corresponding to the molecular mass predicted from the NiV G gene encoding sequences. The glycosidase treatment of the NiVsG also indicated the presence of all the N-glycans sites within the soluble version of the glycoprotein. A first in vivo evaluation in mice revealed that treatment with the MVA\u2013NiV-G and MVA\u2013NiVsG candidate vaccines resulted in the induction of similar levels of G-binding serum antibodies, confirming the immunogenicity of both antigen versions [66]. In that context, the presence of binding antibodies seems to play a substantial role in the blocking of NiV entry, since the mechanism of NiV neutralization is complex and involves more antigenic sites than those required for simple receptor binding [67]. However, more recent studies in different animal models suggest that cellular immune responses are also involved in mediating protection against NiV infection [38,68]. This observation is further supported by studies in a pig model for NiV infection showing substantial activation of CD8 T cells after oral infection with NiV [45]. In line with these preclinical data, humans surviving NiV infection [2] showed significant levels of proliferating (Ki-67+) CD8 T cells, indicating the presence of acute effector cells. These data emphasize that in addition to the humoral immune responses, T cells could be associated with recovery from NiV infection. In a more recent study, Stroh and coworkers confirmed the activation of NiV-specific CD8 T cells in mice after vaccination with NiV-like particles. These data further highlight that T cells may play a critical role in NiV infection [68]. Another hypothesis is that NiV-specific T cells could be involved in potential immunopathologies. In this context, data from infections with other neurotropic viruses, for example, West Nile virus, demonstrated that antigen-specific T cells can open the blood brain barrier and contribute to virus infections of the brain [69,70,71,72,73]. Thus, to allow for more detailed studies characterizing T cells in NiV-associated immunity or pathogenesis, it is essential to identify NiV-G peptide epitopes allowing for the specific MHC-restricted antigen presentation and the activation of NiV-specific T cells. We identified a nonamer epitope NiV-G-9.375\u201383 (RSTDNQAVI). Analysis of this peptide sequence showed that NiV-G 9.375\u201383 could be functionally conserved in Hendra virus, but not Cedar virus (another recognized Henipavirus), G antigens (Figure S3). Structural and functional analyses reveal promiscuous and species-specific use of ephrin receptors by Cedar virus [74]. This potential epitope will support a more detailed experimental characterization of T cells induced by NiV infection in the mouse model and their contribution for pathogenesis and protection. In this study, we found that MVA\u2013NiVsG vaccination induced significantly higher amounts of NiV-G epitope-specific CD8 T cells compared with the MVA\u2013NiV-G candidate vaccine. This was a somewhat surprising observation as the immunizations with both antigens had elicited very comparable levels of G-specific antibodies. It is tempting to speculate that NiVsG, as a soluble antigen, can trigger enhanced T cell responses because it is available to two different pathways of antigen presentation. On the one hand, NiVsG as intracellularly synthetized antigen is endogenously processed and presented via MHC-I on the cell surface to activate CD8 T cells. In addition, the NiVsG is secreted in high amounts from the MVA\u2013NiVsG-infected cells, and such extracellular antigen can efficiently fuel the cross-presentation pathway and thereby induce elevated CD8 and CD4 T cell immune responses [75,76]. Interestingly, the MVA\u2013NiVsG candidate vaccine also proved to rapidly induce NiV-G epitope-specific CD8 T cells after single-dose application. These data are of relevance, since the epidemiology of the more recent NiV outbreaks demonstrated that a potential vaccine candidate should rapidly protect. Importantly, an H2b-restricted epitope has been identified in IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice, which serve as an established small animal model for NiV infection [15]. In addition, we showed the induction of NiV-G-specific CD4 T cells upon prime-boost immunization in the IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 with the MVA\u2013NiV vaccines and using peptides for in vitro stimulation, as identified by using MHC II binding predictions obtained from the IEDB online resource (www.iedb.org). This data goes well along with the hypothesis that CD4 T cell responses are also significantly elevated upon infection [77]. Again, MVA\u2013NiVsG vaccination results in more efficient activation of CD4 T cell responses. Further experiments will be needed to characterize the contribution of NiV G-specific CD4 T cells for NiV infection in more detail. Taken together, our findings showed the activation of NiV-G-specific T cells in IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice following vaccination with MVA-based candidate vaccines. We confirmed the identification of potential H2-b-restricted NiV-G CD8 and CD4 T cell peptide epitopes. In this study we also demonstrated that an MVA\u2013NiVsG candidate vaccine may have superior immunogenicity, resulting in NiV-specific antibodies and T cells in IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice. These data emphasize the promise of future studies in this animal model further evaluating the role of NiV-specific T cells activated by the G-9.375\u201383 and G-50269\u2013283 peptide epitopes, in both vaccine-induced protection and potential contribution to NiV-induced pathologies.",

(A) Schematic diagram of recombinant NiV full-length glycoprotein G (NiV-G) and NiV soluble glycoprotein G (NiVsG). Colored rectangles represent individual protein domains, and bracketed text displays the start and end of amino acid sequences of each domain. (B) Immunofluorescence staining of cells infected with MVA\u2013NiVsG and MVA\u2013NiV-G. HeLa cells were infected at MOI 0.05 with the above viruses for 16 h. MVA and mock infected HeLa cells were used as controls. Fixed permeabilized and fixed nonpermeabilized cells were immunostained with rabbit polyclonal antibody for NiV-G and the secondary antibody anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488. Nuclei were stained with DAPI solution. Panel shows representative pictures of fixed/permeabilized and fixed/nonpermeabilized infected HeLa cells at 40\u00d7 magnification. (C) Western blot analysis of recombinant NiV-G proteins produced by chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) and HeLa cells infected with MVA\u2013NiVsG and MVA\u2013NiV-G. Lysates and culture supernatants were collected from cell cultures infected at MOI 5 with the above viruses, wild-type MVA or noninfected controls (mock). Samples were collected at indicated hours post-infection. Cell lysates and proteins were tested by immunoblotting using a NiV-G-specific polyclonal mouse antibody. Protein bands corresponding to the expected molecular weights of recombinant NiV-G and NiVsG protein (~65\u221270 kDa) are indicated. (D) Western Blot analysis of recombinant proteins produced by DF-1 cells infected with MVA\u2013NiVsG and MVA\u2013NiV-G at MOI 5 for 36 h. MVA and mock infected cells were used as controls. Cell lysates and culture supernatants were incubated with (+) or without (\u2212) enzymes to deglycosylate proteins, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with a rabbit polyclonal antibody for NiV-G. Beta-actin was used as a loading control for lysates.

Mice inoculated with nonrecombinant MVA (MVA) or saline (mock) were used as controls. Eight days after the booster immunization, spleens were collected and single cell suspensions were prepared. CD8 T cells were purified by magnetic bead selection and restimulated with pools of 10\u201313 overlapping 15mer peptides of NiV-G or subpools of positive peptide pools and analyzed by IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT assay. (A) Schematic overview of peptide mapping strategy. A peptide library was generated comprising of 15mer peptides (overlapping by 11mer) that spanned the external domain of the wild-type NiV-G protein. Peptides were organized into a two-dimensional matrix of peptide pools (horizontal rows (H)1\u2013(H)10 and vertical rows (V)1\u2013(V)11) containing 11\u201313 peptides. Each cell of the matrix represents an individual 15mer peptide. (B) Screening for H2-b-restricted T cell epitopes of NiV-G in CD8 T cell enriched splenocytes measured by ELISPOT assay.
