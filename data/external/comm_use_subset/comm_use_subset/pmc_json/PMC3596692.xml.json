Apoptosis, a regulated suicide program, which is characterized by chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, membrane blebbing and cell shrinkage, can be induced by different factors such as virus infection, ultraviolet (UV) irradiation and deprivation of growth factors. Induction of apoptosis is mediated either through death receptors (extrinsic pathway), or at the mitochondrial level (intrinsic pathway)[3]\u2013[5]. The intrinsic pathway involves activation of caspase-9 whereas the extrinsic pathway involves the activation of caspase-8, which is initiated by the interaction of Fas ligand with death receptors. Both caspase-8 and caspase-9 activate caspase-3, which, along with other caspases, cleave critical cellular proteins, resulting in apoptosis.",

HHV-6 remains latent after primary infection and reactivates in an immunocompromised state, as other human herpesviruses do. It has been observed that HHV-6 can infect various types of cells, although this virus mainly infects and replicates in CD4+ T-lymphocytes. HHV-6 has an immunosuppressive effect on T-cell functions, including IL-2 synthesis and cell proliferation[9],[10]. HHV-6 has been shown to induce apoptosis in cultured T cells, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, neuronal cell lines, and CD4+ T lymphocytes isolated from healthy donors[11]\u2013[14].

Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 1,000 g for 10 min. Virus was concentrated from the medium of infected cells by centrifugation at 80,000 g for 2 h. The pellets were suspended in a small volume of medium and used for infection. Titers were determined as viral DNA equivalents by quantitative PCR and confirmed by endpoint dilution of viral inocula on cell cultures. A multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 15 virus DNA copies per cell was used. Uninfected CBMCs were similarly cultured and treated as HHV-6-infected cells and used for mock infection. HSB-2 cells were either mock-infected or adsorbed with HHV-6 for 2 h at 37\u00b0C.

Caspase-3 is one of the main effector caspases, which are activated in response to both intracellular and extracellular death signals. To explore the pathway by which HHV-6A induced apoptosis, we analyzed caspase-3 activity in HHV-6A-infected HSB-2 cells with anti-active caspase-3 antibody by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 3A, HSB-2 cells with activated caspase-3 was about 7.9%, 13.5% and 37.5% at 24, 48 and 72 h, respectively, whereas the value was only 3.3% in the mock-infected cells.",

Two major subgroups with distinct genetic, immunological and virologic characteristics have been named as HHV-6A and HHV-6B[24]\u2013[28]. Ichimi et al. reported that in cord blood lymphocytes, HHV-6 induced apoptosis by an unknown mechanism, which was independent of death receptors[29]. In contrast, Inoue et al. reported that both TNF-\u03b1 and anti-CD95 and anti-CD95L antibodies augmented HHV-6-induced apoptosis, suggesting an involvement of death receptors in HHV-6-induced apoptosis[11]. Caspases play a critical role in apoptosis. During apoptosis, caspases cleave specific substrates and activate downstream molecules, which eventually culminate in cell death[30]. Although HHV-6-induced apoptosis has been widely confirmed, the role of the caspase cascade in HHV-6-induced apoptosis has not been studied. In this study, we demonstrated that activated caspase-9 and caspase-3 were increased in HHV-6A-induced apoptosis of T cells, but there were no significantly changes of activated caspase-8. In addition, we found that PARP was cleaved in HHV-6A-induced T cells apoptosis. Caspase-3 is a common effector of both death receptor and the mitochondrial signaling pathways. Caspase-8 is activated by the death receptor signaling pathway, whereas caspase-9 is activated in the mitochondrial signaling pathway during apoptosis. We speculate that HHV-6A-induced apoptosis could be via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathways.",
