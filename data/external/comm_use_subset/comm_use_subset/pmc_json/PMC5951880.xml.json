Due to their small body size, ease of handling, shorter gestation period, and earlier sexual maturation as well as lower maintenance cost compared to Old World nonhuman primates, common marmosets are being used increasingly as one of the mainstream nonhuman primate animal models in biomedical research, including neuroscience, infectious diseases, reproductive biology, stem cell, and toxicological tests2\u20137. Previously, common marmosets were shown to serve as an ideal model system for hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related liver diseases in vivo and in vitro8,9. However, the understanding of the pathogenesis and development of effective treatments for liver diseases has been hindered by the availability of a suitable in vitro system.",

Also this is particularly challenging experimentally because sacrificing nonhuman primates to obtain primary cells is both expensive and time-consuming, thus immortalized cell lines will greatly improve the functionality of nonhuman primates such as marmoset models. Epithelial liver stem cells from a cynomolgus monkey fetus could be immortalized12, suggesting that immortalized cell lines could be generated from nonhuman primate fetuses. Embryonic stem cell lines (ES) and induced pluripotent stem cell lines (ips) reported to be derived from common marmoset13,14 will be useful for understanding tissue differentiation in nonhuman primates, but are of limited use when it comes to diseases of specific tissues because of high costs and complicated differentiation protocols. Importantly, both ES- and ips-derived hepatocytes fail to expand in vitro indefinitely. Therefore, establishment of immortalized common marmoset hepatocytes or progenitor cells will provide a valuable tool for the development of effective treatments for liver diseases.",

Infection of fetal liver cells with simian virus 40 large T antigen (SV40T)-expressing lentivirus enables their indefinite proliferation in vitro without chromosomal alteration and telomere shortening. Examination on the gene expression profiles of this immortalized cell clone revealed a hepatic progenitor cell-specific gene expression, confirmed by semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR and immunohistochemistry. MHPCs possess the capacities of self-renewal and ability to differentiate into both hepatocytes and cholangiocytes in vitro and in vivo.

Approximately 70% of attached cells consisted of elongated spindle cells with dark nuclei, whereas about 30% of attached cells consisted of polygonal cells with epithelial-like morphology (Fig. 1a), which is a typical feature of hepatic progenitor cells. These cells were infected with lentivirus expressing SV40 large T antigen and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) daily for three times after one passage (Supplementary Figure S1a). Strong fluorescence signals were detected in mixed liver cells 1 week after three successive infections and EGFP-positive cell clones were sorted with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and seeded in six-well plates with further dilution. Notably, EGFP signals became weaker with passaging (Supplementary Figure S1a), consistent with previous reports16. Six clones derived from a mixed population formed colonies and proliferated rapidly after 30 passages, though most cells changed their morphologies during infection and became more like elongated spindle cells (Supplementary Figure S1b). Among them, four clones showed the expression of both hepatocytic and cholangiocytic cell markers (Supplementary Figure S1c), and hepatic stem cell markers (sex-determining region Y box 9 gene\u2014Sox9)17 and fetal hepatic progenitor markers (cytokeratin 7\u2014CK7; Supplementary Figure S1d), indicating these clones are likely MHPCs. In contrast, clone 1 expressed all the markers, including hepatic stem cell marker (epithelial cell adhesion molecule\u2014EpCAM) and fetal hepatic progenitor marker (\u03b1-fetoprotein\u2014AFP; Supplementary Figure S1d), and was more epithelial-like compared to other clones and capable of indefinite proliferation with a mean population doubling time of 2.3 days (Fig. 1a, b). Little difference was detected in doubling time at passage 30 and passage 80 (Fig. 1b), suggesting that clone 1 retained the self-renewal capacity after multiple cell divisions in vitro. Karyotype analysis verified the normal 46 and XY karyotype of clone 1 after 30 population doublings as demonstrated by conventional Giesma banding (Fig. 1c). Examination on the number of chromosomes from 30 individual clones of clone 1 (passage 30) showed that approximately 82% of clones maintained 46 chromosomes (Fig. 1d) without telomere shortening (Fig. 1e), indicating that clone 1 can self-renew without chromosomal alteration and telomere shortening.",

The expression profiling revealed that the upregulation of hepatic progenitor marker genes in clone 1, including CD44, Sox9, Sox17, and neural cell adhesion molecule 1 (Ncam1; Fig. 2a)18 compared to adult liver tissues, indicating that clone 1 is a MHPC line. The expression of hepatic progenitor-specific genes in MHPCs was further confirmed by semiquantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 2b) and immunocytochemistry (Fig. 2c). Consistently, gene set enrichment analysis demonstrated that the expression of DNA replication and cell cycle relevant genes was significantly elevated (Fig. 2d, *P < 0.1 \u00d7 10\u22124), whereas the mRNA levels of cellular metabolism-related genes were significantly decreased (Fig. 2e, *P < 0.1 \u00d7 10\u22124). Also pathways involved in stem cell development, including Wnt, Notch, and Hedgehog19\u201321 were also enriched in MHPCs when compared to adult liver tissues (Supplementary Figure S2).

When grown on two-dimensional Matrigel in HDM containing OSM and EGF for 6 days, MHPCs formed doughnut-like hepatocyte clusters with a diameter of 100 \u00b5m (Fig. 3d-i) and the hepatocytic differentiation status of MHPCs was confirmed by periodic-acid-Schiff (PAS) staining for glycogen storage (Fig. 3d-ii). When MHPCs were cultured in three-dimensional (3D) type I collagen gel culture system23, they readily differentiated into cholangiocyte-like cells with representative branching structures (Fig. 3d-iii) and expressed cholangiocyte marker CK19 after 9 days of induction (Fig. 3d-iv). Importantly, examination on lower (passage 10) and higher passages (50 and 80) of MHPCs revealed no difference in differentiation capacities among passages (Supplementary Figure S3a), though differentiated hepatocytes derived from primary fetal liver cells showed a weaker droplet formation ability compared to immortalized MHPCs (Supplementary Figure S3b). These findings support the conclusion that MHPCs possess the bipotentiality of differentiating into hepatocytes and cholangiocytes in vitro.",

            "text": "Drug detoxification is an important functional parameter for the functionality of mature hepatocytes, particularly for phase I drug metabolism, for which cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes are largely responsible24. Examination on the expression of major CYP enzymes, including CYP3A4, CYP1A1, and CYP1A2 indicated that significantly higher levels of CYP3A4, CYP1A2, and CYP1A1 were detected in differentiated MHPCs than undifferentiated MHPCs (Fig. 4a, b). To analyze whether differentiated MHPCs were responsive to CYP inducers, we treated the cells with two commonly used chemical inducers, including 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MCA) and rifampicin (RIF), respectively, for 48 h. As expected, markedly increased mRNA expression levels of CYP3A4, CYP1A1, and CYP1A2 were induced by 3-MCA in differentiated MHPCs, though only a significantly higher level of CYP1A2 expression was detected in response to RIF induction (Fig. 4c), demonstrating that differentiated MHPCs have the capacity to detoxify drugs and can serve as an in vitro model system for studying drug metabolism. In addition, to evaluate the functional activity of epithelial surfaces on mature hepatocytes from differentiated MHPCs, which is likely lost during immortalization-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), we treated differentiated MHPCs with 5(6)-carboxy-2\u2032, 7\u2032-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (CDFDA), a functional assay for epithelial cell surface polarization22. Functionally polarized hepatocytes were defined by bright CDF-stained bile canaliculi as CDFDA can be hydrolyzed to fluorescent CDF and secreted to bile canaliculi. The results showed that bright fluorescence appeared in differentiated MHPCs with some punctuate signals localized inside cells (Fig. 4d-i, arrowheads), whereas others resided around membrane half an hour after incubation (Fig. 4d-ii, arrows), suggesting that differentiated MHPCs can absorb and hydrolyze CDFDA and thus secrete fluorescent CDF into bile canalicui. These results show that differentiated MHPCs enable drug detoxification and biliary secretion.",

Fah\u2212/\u2212 mice can be rescued by transplantation of normal hepatocytes after NTBC withdrawal25, thus representing a good model to assess the functionality of mature hepatocytes. To investigate the potency of MHPCs to differentiate into mature hepatocytes in vivo, we intrasplenically injected EGFP-positive MHPCs (1 \u00d7 107) into Fah\u2212/\u2212 mice 3 days after NTBC was withdrawn. EGFP was merely used as a reporter gene for tracing the cells after transplantation and the progenitor property of EGFP-infected MHPCs was verified by the expression of Sox9 (Supplementary Figure S4a). Untreated Fah\u2212/\u2212 mice (n = 7) lost body weights gradually and died within 4 weeks after NTBC withdrawal (Fig. 5a, b). In contrast, although MHPC-transplanted Fah\u2212/\u2212 mice lost weight during the first 4 weeks post transplantation, they regained or stabilized body weights afterwards (Fig. 5a). Importantly, 60% of MHPC-transplanted Fah\u2212/\u2212 mice remained alive for at least 7 weeks without NTBC (Fig. 5b), suggesting that MHPC transplantation can extend the lifespan of Fah\u2212/\u2212 mice. Staining of liver tissues from MHPC-transplanted Fah\u2212/\u2212 mice indicated that Fah-positive cells derived from MHPCs comprised 1\u20137% of total hepatocytes in liver of Fah\u2212/\u2212 mice and all of the endogenous hepatocytes were Fah-negative (Fig. 5c, Supplementary Figure S4b). Strikingly, Fah-positive hepatocytes were found in multiple focal areas besides adjacent to central veins with some Fah-positive hepatocytes showing binucleated, a feature characteristic of mature hepatocytes26, similar to studies in mouse and human reported previously (Fig. 5c, d-i)17,27, suggesting that MHPCs can effectively engraft into the liver parenchyma of Fah\u2212/\u2212 mice. Serial staining of liver tissues from transplanted Fah\u2212/\u2212 mice demonstrated the co-localization of Fah- and AAT-positive cells (Fig. 5d-ii), indicating that Fah-positive cells are functional mature hepatocytes. As expected, Fah- and EGFP-postive hepatocytes were also found in spleen of Fah\u2212/\u2212 mice as reported for other species (Supplementary Figure S4c)27. To further confirm the in vivo function of differentiated MHPCs, we isolated EGFP-positive hepatocytes derived from MHPCs in transplanted Fah\u2212/\u2212 mice by FACS (Fig. 5d-iii) and cultured for 2 weeks in vitro. Glycogen accumulation was observed in isolated cells as demonstrated by PAS staining (Fig. 5d-iv), suggesting that isolated cells function as mature hepatocytes. Analysis of biochemical parameters for liver function including serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) revealed that the level of AST was significantly reduced, though to a much less extent with ALT (Fig. 5e). These findings demonstrate that MHPCs can repopulate Fah\u2212/\u2212 liver cells and attenuate liver injuries caused by Fah deficiency. Moreover, we found that MHPCs did not form tumors after transplantation in either Fah\u2212/\u2212 or immunodeficient nude mice (Fig. 5f).",

It was reported that in vivo DDC treatment can induce progenitor cells to spontaneously differentiate into cholangiocytes29. To determine whether MHPCs possess the ability to engraft into bile ducts and further differentiate into cholangiocytes in vivo. We first established a DDC-induced liver injury mouse model by feeding immunodeficient nude mice with 0.1% DDC (wt/wt). Bile duct proliferation was evident at 4 weeks after DDC induction as demonstrated by the increased number of small bile ducts and collagen deposition scattered throughout periportal areas and around the central and portal vein in the livers of DDC-induced mice (Fig. 6a). Importantly, all the bile duct proliferation were of nonhepatocyte origin revealed by the staining of CK19 (a cholangiocytic epithelial cell marker; Supplementary Figure S5a) and Sox9 (a progenitor cell marker; Supplementary Figure S5b)30 and the absence of AAT expression (a hepatocyte marker; Supplementary Figure S5c), suggesting that DDC-induced liver injury activates the endogenous progenitor cells to differentiate into cholangiocytes. EGFP-positive MHPCs (5 \u00d7 106) were intrasplenically transplanted into DDC-induced mice (n = 8) and were found scattered within small and large bile ducts in the liver of two recipient mice 3 weeks post transplantation and comprised 10\u201320% of total biliary epithelial cells with the expression CK19 (Fig. 6b), demonstrating that MHPCs can be differentiated into cholangiocyte in vivo.",

Two different single-guide (sg) RNAs were designed (sgRNA-p53-1 and -2), targeting different sites of the marmoset p53 exon 5, and introduced into MHPCs by lentivirus infection. Sequence analysis of two transfected MHPCs clones (clones 1 and 2) revealed two identical deletions in p53 exon 5 (Fig. 6c) and further examination showed the absence of p53 protein as demonstrated by western blot (Fig. 6d), indicating that MHPCs can be readily genetically modified with CRISPR/Cas9 system. p53\u2212/\u2212 MHPCs showed no morphologic difference from normal MHPCs though a faster migration rate was observed with p53\u2212/\u2212 MHPCs than normal MHPCs as evidenced by the wound-healing assay (Fig. 6e).",

Herein we establish an immortalized MHPC showing an indefinite expansion capacity without chromosomal alteration and telomere shortening. MHPCs not only possess many characteristics of hepatic progenitor cells in self-renewal and gene expression profiles but also have bidirectional differentiation potential to both hepatocytic and cholangiocytic lineages in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, the ability to engraft and repopulate in Fah\u2212/\u2212 and immunodeficient nude mouse liver without tumorigenicity allows the development of preclinical protocols of allotransplantation in a primate model closely related to humans. In comparison to previous studies on immortalized liver stem cells from cynomolgus monkey fetus (namely IPFLS)12, MHPCs were derived from common marmoset, a New World nonhuman primate bearing different physiological features compared to Old World nonhuman primates such as cynomolgus monkey and also an ideal model system for HCV-related studies. The common marmoset remains a more cost-effective nonhuman primate model than the cynomolgus monkey, thus establishment of this cell line gives researchers more tools to work with before in vivo studies. Moreover, the potential of IPFLS to differentiate into biliary lineage and genetic modifiability remain to be determined. Thus, MHPCs would be useful to model hepatic progenitor cells in drug discovery and in understanding of the pathogenesis of human liver diseases.",

In comparison to methods of staged differentiation to derive tissue-specific somatic cells from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), the direct induction methods described here have advantages in saving time and materials. Notably, this approach also eliminates the possibility of contaminating cells types such as ESCs or iPSCs, which can result in the possibility of teratoma formation. However, the drawback of this virus infection-based immortalization method is the influence on cellular morphologies as reported earlier16, though spontaneous EMT acquisition during culture can also contribute to the morphological changes. Despite the acquisition of mesenchymal features of MHPCs during immortalization, MHPCs maintain the properties and potency of hepatic progenitor cells, including gene expression profiles and functionality, including epithelial cell surface polarization.",

Importantly, differentiated MHPCs show the capability of detoxification and biliary secretion, which is a key function of mature hepatocytes for detoxification32. An interesting observation from our study is that differentiated MHPCs respond remarkably well to CYP inducers such as 3-MCA, but only the level of CYP1A2 was significantly elevated by RIF induction in differentiated MHPCs. It was known that CYP induction is a time- and concentration-dependent process and the induction time and dose of different CYP inducers required varies in human and other species33. Therefore, we speculate that the unresponsiveness of CYP1A1 and CYP3A4 to RIF observed in differentiated MHPCs is likely due to the unfavorable conditions (i.e., induction time or concentrations), however the species differences cannot be excluded. Further investigations are warranted to optimize the conditions of RIF induction in MHPCs.",

Intriguingly, despite the high survival rate observed in Fah-deficient mice after MHPC transplantation, the level of serum ALT was only marginally decreased compared to untreated Fah-deficient mice. As it is known that ALT is more sensitive to hepatocytic injury, whereas the serum from untreated and treated Fah-deficient mice was harvested when the mice were dying. So it is reasonable that the level of serum ALT increased by the time of harvesting blood and tissues as the liver condition of MHPC-transplanted Fah-deficient mice deteriorated. Nevertheless, the significantly extended lifespan and expression of FAH and AAT observed in MHPC-transplanted Fah-deficient mice sufficiently proved the potency of MHPCs to repopulate liver cells in vivo and rescue Fah-deficient mice.",
