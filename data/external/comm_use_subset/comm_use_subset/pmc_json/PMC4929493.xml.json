Skin wounds were created by full-thickness punch biopsy in mice. SSEA-1, a marker for various types of endogenous multipotent stem cells303435, ESC and iPSC36, was used to detect multipotent stem cells. Indeed, we were able to detect SSEA-1 positive cells in wounded skin but not normal skin (Fig. 1A). After isolating single cells from wounded or normal skin of mice by collagenase, staining with SSEA-1 antibody, and analyzing by flow cytometry, we detected a significantly higher number of SSEA-1 positive cells in isolated skin cells from wounded skin, as compared to those from normal skin (9.26 \u00b1 2.84% vs 0.37 \u00b1 0.15%, P < 0.01, Fig. 1B). When cells isolated from either wounded or normal skin were cultured in a medium containing M-CSF for 48 hrs, and then stained with SSEA-1 antibody, we confirmed SSEA-1 positive cells could indeed be isolated from wounded but not normal skin (Fig. 1C). Taken together, these data imply that SSEA-1 positive multipotent stem cells are present in the wound site after injury.",

As expected, by using immunofluorescence staining we have here revealed that these SSEA-1 positive cells in wounded skin are also SSEA-3 positive (Fig. 2A). To further confirm SSEA-1 positive cells in wounded skin are the same type of stem cells induced by M-CSF as previously reported24, we examined the expression of the M-CSF receptor in SSEA-1 positive cells by staining wounded skin with both antibodies. As expected, we found the SSEA-1 positive cells are collocated with the M-CSF receptor in wounded skin (Fig. 2B), suggesting SSEA-positive stem cells in wounded skin are the same type of stem cells derived from hematopoietic cells, as previously reported.",

            "text": "We then compared the expression of SSEA-1 or SSEA-3 positive cells in wounds of seven days and fourteen days after injury. In our skin injury model, the wounds are usually healed around day ten after injury. Thus, wounds at day seven after injury represent unhealed wounds while wounds at day fourteen after injury represent healed wounds. As shown in Fig. 3A,B, when skin wounds are completely healed (as shown here on day fourteen) SSEA-1 or SSEA-3 positive cells are markedly reduced or absent at the wound site. To quantify the expression of SSEA-1, we measured the ratio of corrected total SSEA-1 fluorescence to corrected total DAPI fluorescence (SSEA-1/DAPI) in the wounds of day 7 and day 14, respectively, by using imageJ program. The result revealed a significant increase of SSEA-1 expression in wounds on day 7 as compared to that in wounds on day 14 [0.1784 \u00b1 0.0643 (day 7) vs 0.0012 \u00b1 0.0009 (day 14), ratio of CTCF of SSEA-1/CTCF of DAPI, n = 6, P < 0.001]. A possible explanation is that either SSEA-positive cells have differentiated into skin cells in which SSEA-1 and SSEA-3 are not expressed, or SSEA-positive cells have died as fibroblast-released M-CSF may reduce significantly after the wound is healed. In addition, our result revealed that the expression of M-CSF receptor in stem cells was found in wounds of seven days but not in wounds of fourteen days (Supplementary Figure S2), suggesting differentiated cells from SSEA-positive cells may not continue to need M-CSF to maintain their proliferation and survival.",

To do this, skin excisional wounds were topically administered with either a control of phosphate buffer saline (PBS), or M-CSF, or a neutralizing antibody against M-CSF, from day one until day six. The mice were sacrificed on day seven. Skin wounds were collected and fixed in 10% formalin for immunofluorescence staining with SSEA-1 antibody. As shown in Fig. 4, a higher number of SSEA-1 positive cells were seen in wounds receiving M-CSF treatment, compared to the number in untreated wounds. In concert with this result, the application of M-CSF neutralizing antibody remarkably reduced the number of SSEA-1 positive cells in the wound site, as compared to the number untreated wounds. These data suggest that the presence of SSEA-1 positive cells in the wound site can be affected by M-CSF at the wound environment, which normally is produced and released from proliferating fibroblasts, and some infiltrated immune cells, during the wound healing phase.",

Three million EGFP+ FLCs per mouse were injected into the blood circulation of syngeneic mice via tail vein (Fig. 6A). Skin wounds were created by punch biopsy simultaneously. After fourteen days, blood, spleen, liver, heart, lung, and bone marrow cells, and both wound-surrounding normal skin and wounded skin were collected. Fluorescence microscopy failed to detect any EGFP-positive cells in spleen, lung, liver, heart or kidney of mice receiving EGFP stem cells (Supplementary Figure S3A), and flow cytometry similarly detected none in splenocytes or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (Supplementary Figure S3B). Furthermore, there were no EGFP-positive cells detected in the surrounding normal skin (Supplementary Figure S3C). However, EGFP-positive cells were found in the dermis and some parts of the epidermis of healed skin (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, our results revealed that injected splenocyte-derived multipotent stem cells could also differentiate to blood vessel-like structures in the wound sites (Fig. 6C). To examine whether EGFP-positive cells in the dermis could contribute to the skin healing process through differentiation into fibroblasts, we performed an immunofluorescence staining with type-1 pro-collagen antibody. While undifferentiated FLCs are known to be negative for type 1 pro-collagen24, results from this study revealed that almost all infiltrated EGFP-positive FLCs in dermis express type-1 pro-collagen (Fig. 6D), suggesting hematopoietic cell-derived stem cells are able to differentiate into functional skin cells.",

By staining with SSEA-1 and-3 antibodies in injured skin, we demonstrated the presence of SSEA-1 and-3 positive stem cells in the skin at the injured site. Obviously, the number of SSEA-positive stem cells was regulated by the presence of M-CSF in the injury site. Our study further revealed that topical application of M-CSF protein on skin wounds accelerates healing while obstruction of M-CSF by a neutralizing antibody slows wound healing. We also demonstrated that an injection of hematopoietic cell-derived stem cells can be differentiated into organ-specific cells in vivo. Data obtained in a skin wound healing model thus point to a novel role for infiltrated hematopoietic cells in tissue repair.",

            "text": "M-CSF is a multifunctional pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in differentiation, proliferation and survival of monocyte progenitor cells39. Natural mutations of the M-CSF locus in mouse (op/op) and rat (tl/tl) result in reduction of macrophages and osteoclast density in tissues, toothlessness, severe growth retardation and low fertility4041. These deficiencies can be partially restored by injection of recombinant human M-CSF42. A number of studies have shown that expression of M-CSF in local resident cells is markedly increased in response to tissue injury43444546. The up-regulation of M-CSF expression and release are correlated with the activation and proliferation of local resident cells. Our previous study demonstrated that the level of M-CSF in conditioned medium is significant higher when fibroblasts are in proliferation status, as compared to cells in quiescent status24. The increase of M-CSF expression in wound sites is beneficial to wound healing. We found that removing M-CSF at the skin wound environment, by topical application of M-CSF antibody, significantly slows wound healing while topical application of M-CSF recombinant protein accelerates skin wound healing. This result was strongly supported by other studies showing the effects of M-CSF on wound healing. Kawahara et al found that the healing of gastric ulcers was significantly delayed and the degree of vascularisation in the ulcerated area was significantly lower in M-CSF knockout op/op mice compared to normal mice47. Another study showed that application of M-CSF recombinant protein increased new granulation tissue formation in an ischemic dermal ulcer rabbit ear model48. A similar result was reported in an acute kidney injury mouse model43.",

Previous studies have attributed the beneficial effect of M-CSF on wound healing to the increases of local macrophages and dendritic cells434748. For example, one study found that genetic deletion of M-CSF by a pharmacologic inhibitor of C-fms, the receptor of M-CSF, resulted in both a marked reduction in the number of macrophages and dendritic cells and the slowing of recovery in an acute kidney injury model43. Another study showed that in op/op M-CSF deficient mice, the healing of gastric ulcers was significantly slower, and fewer macrophages was observed in the injured site, as compared to normal mice47. Although the data obtained from these studies suggested macrophages and dendritic cells might play a role in tissue repair through secreting cytokine and growth factors43, the evidence for correlation among macrophages, dendritic cells and wound healing is still lacking. As M-CSF is well known as a factor for proliferation, differentiation and survival of monocyte lineage cells, the higher number of macrophages and dendritic cells in injured tissues may be simply a side effect of M-CSF.",

In a skin wound healing mouse model we found skin injury can induce SSEA-1 positive stem cells from 0.37 \u00b1 0.15% in normal skin to 9.26 \u00b1 2.84% in injured skin. SSEA-1 positive cells are also SSEA-3 positive and express M-CSF receptor, suggesting these cells at the wound site are the same type of cells previously reported as hematopoietic cell-derived multipotent stem cells24. These cells may be also the same as previously reported SSEA-3 positive cells in the dermis31. The increase of SSEA-positive cell numbers at the wound site can be explained by the regulation of M-CSF to hematopoietic cell-derived stem cells: it is well known that tissue injury can activate quiescent fibroblasts to proliferate, and M-CSF is expressed and released from proliferating fibroblasts24. M-CSF at the wound site may directly induce one type of immune cell dedifferentiation into SSEA-1 and SSEA-3 positive stem cells. Indeed, applying a M-CSF neutralizing antibody to the wounds can markedly reduce the number of SSEA-1 positive cells and applying M-CSF recombinant protein can increase the number of SSEA-1 positive cells.",

The contributions of SSEA-positive cells or M-CSF protein on skin wound healing can be explained by different mechanisms. SSEA-positive cells are hematopoietic cell-derived stem cells. As shown in Supplementary Figure S5C, undifferentiated cells can express interleukine-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), IL-4, IL-10, transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and migrating inhibitory factor (MIF). Factors such as IL4, TGF-\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 have been suggested as accelerating wound healing495051. We also found that differentiated and undifferentiated hematopoietic cell-derived multipotent stem cells express \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (Supplementary Figure S5B) which can increase wound contraction52. As hematopoietic cell-derived stem cells have multipotent differentiation capacity, they can differentiate into mesenchymal cells, epithelial cells and blood vesicle endothelial cells24 (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Figure S5A), which would provide a cell source and extracellular matrix for wound healing.",

This enrichment may be due to a number of reasons: first of all, the survival and proliferation of hematopoietic cell-derived stem cells are absolutely M-CSF dependent24. In normal conditions, the concentration of M-CSF in skin and other organs is not enough to maintain the survival of this type of stem cell. However, when injury activates quiescent fibroblasts to express and release M-CSF, a high concentration of M-CSF will result at the wound environment, in which mobilized hematopoietic cell-derived stem cells can survive and further proliferate. Second, the enrichment of EGFP-labeled stem cells at the wound site might also be driven by one or more members of the constellation of chemokine receptors. A number of previous studies have confirmed different type of stem cells are recruited and enriched at damaged tissues234567891011. Grafting hematopoietic stem cells into bone marrow or circulation has been found beneficial for injured tissues as these cells are trans-differentiated into organ-specialized cells1415161718. Further study is needed to clarify what mechanism drives hematopoietic cell-derived stem cells to accumulate in injured tissues but not in normal organs and whether injury in other organs can also recruit such stem cells into the injury sites.",

Images were captured using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 fluorescence microscope and AxioVision image analysis software. To calculate the corrected total fluorescence (CTCF) of SSEA-1 staining, we measured the area, cell fluorescence integrated density and mean gray value in selected field of wounds using imageJ program.
