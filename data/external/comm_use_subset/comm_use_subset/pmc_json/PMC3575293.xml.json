The virion consists of a nucleocapsid (N) core surrounded by an envelope containing three membrane proteins, spike (S), membrane (M) and envelope (E), which are common to all members of the genus\n[4,5]. The M and E proteins are important for viral particle assembly and N is important for viral RNA packaging. The S protein, which provides the virion with a corona-like appearance, binds to host receptors and mediates membrane fusion\n[6]. The successful development of effective treatments and vaccines against SARS-CoV depends on understanding the roles of various immune effectors in protective immunity and on identifying protective viral antigens recognized by these effector cells. In a preliminary study, the S protein fragment S358\u2013374 was shown to stimulate the production of IFN-\u03b3 by CD8-T cells from immunized BALB/c mice\n[7].",

The MHC-binding scores were determined by three peptide-binding prediction methods: artificial neural network (ANN)\n[23], stabilized matrix method (SMM)\n[16], and average relative binding (ARB)\n[19]. Predicted binding scores were expressed as IC50 values, which represented the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of the peptide in relation to a particular MHC molecule. The binding affinities of all 9 and 10 amino acid peptide stretches in S358\u2013381 were predicted. The data indicated that the binding of 9 aa peptides was stronger than all 10 aa peptides and that these 9 aa peptides binded with higher affinity to H-2 Kd than to H-2 Dd or H-2 Ld (data not shown). Therefore, we concluded that the optimal epitope should be an H-2 Kd restricted 9 amino acids peptide. In addition, the results demonstrated that S366\u2013374 (CYGVSATKL) was the highest affinity peptide to H-2 Kd (Table\n1).",

Alanine-scanning, lysine-scanning, or aspartic acid-scanning by systematic replacement of side-chains with alanine, lysine, or aspartic acid have been used widely to study binding sites on proteins\n[22,30]. Analysis of the functional importance of side-chains by mutational study may exaggerate the effect by imposing a structural disturbance or an unusual steric, electrostatic, or hydrophobic interaction. Alanine-scanning is the least disruptive to the peptide structure because alanine is uncharged and has the smallest amino acid side group next to glycine, and thus has been particularly useful for mapping protein functional domains. In contrast, glycine can change the main chain conformation of the protein\n[31], so individual alanine mutations are preferred to infer the roles of individual amino acid residues. Charged residues such as lysine and aspartic acid are capable of forming ion pairs and hydrogen bonds, so they often play an important role in protein binding as well as in the recognition of interacting proteins. Thus, lysine and aspartic acid are often used as substitutes to study electrostatic effects between proteins\n[32].",
