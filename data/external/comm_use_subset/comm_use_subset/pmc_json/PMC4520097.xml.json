The interaction of this receptor with its ligands results in the homing of different immune cells to the sites of viral infection on the mucosal surface. Studies have shown that the \u039432 deletion in the CCR5 gene interferes with the response of immune cells through CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5, impairing viral clearance [8\u201310]. In a population of 20 Canadian patients who developed severe forms of infection with the pandemic flu virus, the mutation at position 32 of the CCR5 gene (rs333) was detected in five patients and was associated with an unfavorable clinical evolution [7]. However, the same mutation evaluated in 29 Italian patients also infected with the pandemic strain was not associated with poor clinical outcome [11]. In the present study, the CCR5\u039432 polymorphism (rs333) was investigated in individuals from a Brazilian admixed population with a diagnosis of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection.",
