Additional risk factors of HCV infection include perinatal infection, sexual transmission and activities with potential exposure to blood, such as tattoo and piercing. The disease can manifest in a wide spectrum of effects, ranging from various degrees of liver damage, syndromes of immunological origin \u2014 such as rheumatoid symptoms and cryoglobulinemia [2]\u2013[4] \u2014 and neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression and cognitive deficits [5]\u2013[12].",

PTSD is a common, debilitating, complex syndrome which occurs in some persons after personal exposure to a traumatic stressor or experienced by a family member or another close associate. Some of the main symptoms are intense fear, helplessness, persistent avoidance of stimulus associated with the trauma, increased arousal. [13]. \u201cThe full symptom picture must be present for over 1 month (Criterion E), and the disturbance must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning\u201d (DSM-IV). Populational studies show the disorder's prevalence to be around 6.8% in a study carried out in the United States [14] and 14% in another one carried out in Brazil [15]. PTSD is highly comorbid with many different medical and psychiatric illnesses and can be underestimated in non-clinical populations [15]\u2013[17]. It is also associated with significantly low rates of HRQoL [18], [19]. PTSD has already been cited in HCV populations in a small number of studies, most of which were primarily focused on other specific populations, such as veterans, HIV co-infected persons, and persons on dialysis [20]\u2013[25].",

The prevalence of psychiatric disorders in both HCV-control and HCV-PTSD groups was high, especially the latter, which is in accordance with previous clinical studies regarding individuals infected with hepatitis C [10], [43]. The HCV-PTSD samples had a prevalence of psychiatric disorders 49% higher on average than the general Brazilian population, according to estimates from epidemiological studies of the general population [58]. Although the majority of the studies relating PTSD to HCV patients has been conducted with veterans and HIV co-infected patients, this study had only two HIV co-infected patients and no veterans.",
