As a ubiquitous viral pathogen among domestic and wild feline populations, FCoV can be horizontally transmitted via the fecal-oral route with persistent infection, and the prevalence and seropositivity in multi-cat households or shelters may achieve 90%1,2. With regard to pathogenicity, FCoV exists as two biotypes, namely feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV)3. Genetic mutations occurred in FECV within a persistently infected cat allow it to acquire macrophage tropism and change the virus into the virulent FIPV4. Infections caused by the former show no clinically apparent or mild, self-limiting gastroenteritis in kittens. In contrast, FIPV infections develop high fatality and progressive, multi-systemic disorders in young cat populations. Feline infectious peritonitis remains one of the most devastating and lethal viral diseases among Felidae, not only because of the high mortality rate, but also because of the lack of effective options in diagnosis, prevention, and treatment5. The disease is further complicated by antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), which can exacerbate disease symptoms4.",

            "text": "Virus fusion with host cell endosomal membranes, facilitated by a low pH, is a major event for certain virus infection cascade6. Vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) activity, which is responsible for pumping protons into endosomal compartments, has been identified as a requirement for feline coronavirus replication in previous studies7. The endosomal acidification process is also necessary for the establishment of ADE in FIPV infection8. Therefore, the endosomal V-ATPase presents an attractive target for antiviral intervention. In the past decades, abundant studies indicated that V-ATPase inhibitors could be applied to treat viral infections as well as other diseases including osteoporosis, lytic bone disease, renal acidosis, and cancer9,10. For example, the most commonly used V-ATPase inhibitor, bafilomycin, showed a broad-spectrum antiviral effect against several pathogens. However, the drug\u2019s cytotoxicity compromises its clinical applicability11. More recently, diphyllin, a natural compound extracted from the plant Cleistanthus collinus, was discovered as a potent V-ATPase inhibitor with a promising safety profile. Studies have shown that diphyllin at nanomolar concentrations can inhibit V-ATPase activity in bovine chromaffine granules and lysosomal acidification in human osteoclasts with no cytotoxic effect on bone formation12. In a study on treating gastric adenocarcinoma, diphyllin decreased V-ATPase activity and lowered tumor cell infectivity for improved disease outcome13. A previous study also demonstrated diphyllin\u2019s antiviral effect in vitro against influenza and dengue viruses14, highlighting the compound\u2019s potential as a broad-spectrum \u201chost-targeted\u201d antiviral. The present study thus aims to investigate the compound\u2019s effect against FIPV.",

The block-copolymer is highly biocompatible and frequently employed for drug delivery applications, and the nanocarrier may benefit the diphyllin compound in two ways. Firstly, the hydrophobic cores of PEG-PLGA nanocarriers offer an ideal medium for carrying and delivering the hydrophobic diphyllin compound, obviating the need for organic solvents. Secondly, the intracellular uptake of nanoparticles via the characteristic endocytosis mechanism may enhance diphyllin efficacy by facilitating compound colocalization with endosomal V-ATPase, thereby reducing the drug\u2019s off-target effect and enhancing its antiviral activity. To examine the benefits of the diphyllin nanoformulation, cellular cytotoxicity and antiviral activity between free diphyllin and diphyllin nanoparticles were compared. In addition, an in vitro model of FIPV infection was established to assess the viral inhibitory effect of diphyllin nanoparticles in the context of ADE. Finally, safety of the diphyllin nanoparticles were assessed following intravenous injections in mice. Blood chemistry analysis and body weight monitoring were performed to evaluate the drug\u2019s safety in vivo.",

The degree of inhibition in endosomal acidification was shown to correlate with diphyllin concentration (Fig. 1A). To quantitatively analyze the endosomal acidification, green and red fluorescence data collected from diphyllin-treated wells were compared, and the green/red fluorescence ratio was indicated in Fig. 1B.

The inhibitory effect against the FIPV infection was most pronounced when the cells were exposed to diphyllin prior to viral exposure. Other incubation schedules also resulted in significant reduction in FIPV titer, thereby validating diphyllin\u2019s antiviral ability. To further demonstrate the viral inhibition activity by diphyllin, immunofluorescence staining was performed. FITC-labeled antibodies were used to detect FIPV nucleocapsid protein under fluorescence microscopy. As seen in Fig. 2D, with the reference of the DAPI-stained nuclei, cytoplasmic fluorescent signal was reduced with pretreatment of bafilomycin A1 and varying concentrations of diphyllin.

To further characterize the nanoparticles, DLS was used to analyze the size distributions of the nanoparticles. The results from DLS demonstrate that diphylin-loaded nanoparticle exhibited an average particle diameter of 36.19 \u00b1 1.15 nm (Fig. 3C). Quantification of diphyllin loading in the PEG-PLGA nanoparticles was performed using HPLC to determine the drug loading yield and efficiency.

An MTT assay was performed to examine the CPE protection. As compared to the untreated control, the presence of diphyllin significantly inhibited the number of CPE foci induced by the viral infection. Based on the MTT assay result, the IC50 value of diphyllin against NTU156 at an MOI of 0.0001 in fcwf-4 cells was 590 \u00b1 91 nM. The diphyllin nanoparticle, on the other hand, showed an IC50 of 9.751 \u00b1 2.35 nM (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 4B), which corresponds to a 60-fold enhancement in antiviral activity as compared to the free drug. Empty PEG-PLGA nanoparticles showed no antiviral effect at 10 mg/mL (Supplementary Fig. S1). Calculation of therapeutic index (TI = CC50/IC50) yielded values of 10 and 7923 for the free diphyllin and diphyllin nanoparticles, respectively. The antiviral activities of diphyllin and diphyllin nanoparticles were further assessed against a different strain of FIPV (NTU204). At an MOI of 0.01, the free diphyllin and the diphyllin nanoparticles exhibited IC50 values at 348 \u00b1 53.6 nM and 44.3 \u00b1 38.3 nM respectively (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 4C).

As indicated in Fig. 5, the presence of mAb during viral infection resulted in a significant increase of viral titer from 6 \u00d7 104 PFU/ml to 8 \u00d7 105 PFU/ml in the culture supernatant. Fcwf-4 cells were infected with FIPV in the context of ADE, and the antiviral activity of diphyllin at various concentrations was tested by plaque assays after 48 hr of incubation. It was observed that diphyllin reduced antibody-enhanced FIPV infection in a dose-dependent manner, and 2 \u03bcM of diphyllin nanoparticle treatment reduced the viral load by 5 orders of magnitude to 6 PFU/ml.

To this date, FIP remains fatal in most cases and lacks effective prophylactic and therapeutic treatment options. In clinical settings, recommended disease management during FIP manifestation includes a variety of supportive treatments, such as immunomodulatory drugs, antibiotics, anticoagulants, fluids and supplements3. Studies have shown that disease severity correlates with the systemic viral load18, hence, antiviral therapeutics that reduce the viral spread may be beneficial towards disease control. Previously, a coronaviral protease inhibitor GC376 demonstrated a promising advance in direct inhibition of virus replication in a clinical trial19. Other pathogen-targeted antiviral approaches have been tested in vitro, awaiting further efficacy validation in vivo\n20\u201325. Among different antiviral strategies, host-targeted therapeutics are increasingly recognized as an attractive antiviral treatment approach as they do not exert direct selective pressures on viral pathogens. Advantages of host-targeted therapies include broad applicability against multiple viruses and insusceptibility to drug-resistant mutations26,27. Examples of host-targeted treatments against FIP include the use of cyclosporine A to suppress the replication of FIPV in cell culture via the inhibition of cyclophilin28,29. As cyclophilin is a critical host factor responsible for the replication of many members of the Coronaviridae family, cyclosporine A was suggested to be a pan-coronavirus inhibitor30,31. In another example, chloroquine was shown to have anti-FIPV and anti-inflammatory activities in vitro and further relieved clinical symptoms in FIP-infected cats. The compound, however, poses safety concerns and it may inflict liver damage32. Therefore, the present study explores a novel compound and an alternative delivery approach towards facilitating safe and effective anti-FIPV drug development.",

Differential role for acidic endocytic compartments in cellular entry between these two FIPV strains suggests that the low-pH entry may be strain-dependent and biotype-independent. While diphyllin also exhibited inhibitory effect on NTU156 cultured in U937 cells under the ADE infection (Supplementary Fig. S3), we speculate the sensitivity to dipyllin exhibited by NTU156 is cell type-independent.

            "text": "Towards applying diphyllin for therapeutic purposes, the compound\u2019s insolubility and potential adverse effect are two concerns that can be addressed using nanocarrier technology. Nanoparticle-based drug delivery presents unique advantages that arise from the carriers\u2019 nanoscale morphology and drug loading capacity. The approach has been applied extensively in anticancer applications, yielding formulations with improved delivery efficiency and therapeutic efficacy15,38\u201340. More recently, nanomedicine platforms have begun to draw attention as an antiviral delivery platform. For example, acyclovir, a common antiviral drug against herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1), was delivered by nanocarriers for enhanced efficacy and reduced side effects, exhibiting a three-fold improvement in therapeutic effect in comparison to free drugs41. Saliphenylhalamide (Saliphe), a V-ATPase inhibitor, has also been shown to display enhanced viral inhibition when delivered via nanoparticles42. The virus-like dimension of nanoparticles may favor drug delivery to sites of viral infections as many similarities regarding cellular entry and in vivo biodistributions have been observed between viruses and nanocarriers43. In the present study, PEG-PLGA, a biocompatible block co-polymer widely used for drug delivery applications44\u201347, was applied for the encapsulation and delivery of diphyllin. The nanoparticles significantly improved the safety and efficacy of the diphyllin compound, increasing the therapeutic index by approximately 800-fold in one of our infection models. This pronounced enhancement can be attributed to multiple characteristics of the nanomaterial. Firstly, the hydrophobic nature of the PEG-PLGA nanoparticle cores facilitates diphyllin incorporation and obviates the need of organic solvents for compound dissolution. As a result, rather than permeating through the cells with the aid of DMSO, nanocarrier-encapsulated diphyllin relies on nanoparticle-mediated endocytosis for cellular entry. V-ATPase, the target of diphyllin, are ubiquitous among intracellular compartments and govern a multitude of physiological cellular functions10. Enhancing diphyllin localization inside endosomes may thus reduce the compound\u2019s potential side effects. Higher drug efficacy and improved cell protection by the nanoformulations can also be directly attributed to enhanced endosomal drug delivery by the nanoparticles. A higher effective dosage can efficiently reach the endosomal protein target upon nanoparticle delivery.",

The recognition of FIPV immune-complexes via the FcR by immune cells can enhance disease progression through altered cross-reactive cellular immune response, inefficient lysis of infected cells, and altered T cell-cytokine responses that collectively promote ADE. Although the relationship between serotypes or strains and the ADE phenomenon remains unclear48, the requirement of endosomal acidification for ADE has been well established8. Our study has demonstrated that diphyllin nanoparticles possess dose-dependent antiviral activity in an in vitro model of ADE of FIPV infection, which mimics the disease\u2019s clinical manifestation. By attenuating cellular organelle acidification, the nanoformulation effectively inhibits endosomal acidification responsible for virus uncoating and cytoplasmic entry (Fig. 7). As the diphyllin nanoparticles are shown to be well tolerated in vivo upon high-dose intravenous administration, the formulation presents a promising treatment option against the lethal feline disease. Future studies with in vivo animal models of viral infections are warranted.\n",
