            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) comprise a family under the order Nidovirales (family Coronaviridae) and infect a wide variety of mammals and birds. The course of infection varies greatly from asymptomatic to severe disease, depending on the host and virus species in question. The genome of CoVs is one of the largest (25\u201332 kb) viral RNA-genomes [1]. Based on phylogenetic analysis, the CoVs are divided into four different genera: Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and Deltacoronavirus. The alpha- and betacoronaviruses are carried by mammals, whereas the gamma- and deltacoronaviruses mainly infect birds, with few exceptions [2,3]. The large genomes, infidelity of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and high frequency of homologous RNA recombination are the main factors contributing to the high genetic diversity of CoVs [4\u20136].",

IBV is highly contagious and affects the respiratory tract, gut, kidney, and reproductive systems, causing substantial economic losses in the poultry industry [8]. Despite the global distribution of IBV, poultry in Finland remained free of clinical cases until April 2011 [9] after which outbreaks involving several CoV genotypes have occurred in Southern Finland.",

In 2003, a novel highly pathogenic betacoronavirus emerged in China, causing severe disease characterized by acute respiratory distress and it became known as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV. The emergence of SARS-CoV [16] inspired virologists to more explore the highly divergent group of coronaviruses and their hosts, leading to the identification of a rapidly growing number of CoV species particularly in bats [2]. More recently, another highly pathogenic betaCoV infecting humans, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoV emerged in 2012 with a case fatality rate of over 40% [17,18].",

The gammacoronaviruses that were detected in gulls in this study shared up to 99% sequence identity and clustered with previous isolates from gulls in Siberia and Alaska [23]. The viruses isolated from pigeons (Columba sp) (Fin6709 and Fin11782) and an isolate from a long-tailed duck (Clangula hyemalis) shared only up to 89% nucleotide identity with the currently published strains, with the highest nucleotide identity with duck gammacoronaviruses.

CoVs are a large group of viruses infecting mammals and birds, including infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which is a highly contagious coronavirus infecting chickens. A variety of coronaviruses are known to circulate among wild birds. We set up this study to determine the occurrence of coronavirus infections in wild birds in Finland. Altogether 939 samples collected between 2010 and 2013 from wild birds were included in the study. The prevalence was fairly high (up to 11%) although with great annual variation. The sample panels differed to some extent in terms of time and geographic distribution (Figure 2) and sampled species, which might partly explain the annual variation. For example, majority of the samples of 2010 were from duck species (Anas sp.) sampled for active surveillance purposes. In 2011\u20132013 on the contrary, most samples were derived through passive surveillance and included a smaller proportion of ducks. However, no firm conclusions can be drawn whether the observed difference in prevalence is due to some regular pattern, or due to the sampling methods (heterogeneity of the sample material).",

            "text": "CoV infections in mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) have been documented in Sweden [26,35], and one of the studies reported the prevalence of CoV infections to be 6.9% albeit with seasonal variation [35]. In a more recent study, Wille et al. documented the prevalence of CoVs among wild waterbirds in Sweden to be even 18.7% [37]. A study from Norway reported the prevalence of CoV RNA among graylag goose (Anser anser) in Northern Europe to be as high as 38% in 2004, but they also documented great annual and geographical variation; in 2003 the prevalence was only 18% [38]. Also in England, wildfowl (Anseriformes) and waders (Charadriiformes) have been reported to carry CoVs [39]. A report from South Korea documented a prevalence of CoV RNA to be 0.95% in wildfowl (Anseriformes), and they also observed annual variation in the detection of CoV RNA [34]. Based on the studies from South Korea [34] and Northern Europe [38], and the results we obtained, it seems that large annual variation in the circulating RNA seems to be characteristic to avian coronaviruses. A study in China reported Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus RNA in 12% of the screened, apparently healthy, wild aquatic birds (Anseriformes, Pelecaniformes, and Ciconiiformes) [24], which is in concordance with our results. Another study, conducted in the Beringia area (encompassing areas of Alaska and Siberia), reported Gammacoronavirus RNA in 6.4% of the examined birds (Anseriformes, Pelecaniformes, and Charadriiformes) [23]. Interestingly, some of the sequences found in the Chinese study [24] were identical to those found from the Beringia area [23]. Also the Finnish Duck CoVs reported in this study cluster very closely with duck CoVs of the Gammacoronavirus genus from Siberia and China, which are connected by migratory routes. The close genetic relatedness of these strains (as well as those found in South Korea and England) indicates that migratory birds do have a specific role in dispersing CoV to distinct geographical locations. However, the sequence analyses might be somewhat biased due to the limited availability of reference strains. This and previous studies have mainly been focused on duck and shorebird species of the Northern hemisphere, hence the involvement of other avian species and a wider global distribution of avian CoVs remains unclear.",

Also, the fact that we detected a Deltacoronavirus in Chroicocephalus ridibundus is interesting, since in another study [23] Gammacoronavirus RNA was found from the same bird species. It was previously reported, that the bird species from the order Anseriformes can be infected with both delta- and gammacoronaviruses [24], and we now demonstrate that the same applies for the order Charadriiformes. The abundance of the detected CoV sequences originated from ducks supports the hypothesis that the Duck CoVs would persist as endemic in duck populations causing subclinical infections similarly to LPAI and APMV.",

Due to the high recombination rate of CoVs, new species constantly arise that are able to adapt to new hosts and ecological niches [5].
