Since its discovery, HBoV has been associated with upper and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) and gastroenteritis worldwide. Recent studies have revealed that three new species, named HBoV2, 3 and 4 are found mainly in the gastrointestinal tract and rarely in the respiratory tract, in contrast to HBoV1 which is a respiratory pathogen [2], [3], [4], [5]. HBoV is classified in the family Parvoviridae, which includes small, non-envoloped, icosahedral viruses with 5.3 kb single-strand DNA genome containing three open reading frames (ORFs). The first two sequential ORFs encode non-structural proteins NS1 and NP1, whereas the third downstream ORF encodes two viral capsid proteins, VP1 and VP2 [1].",

Several seroepidemiologic studies have demonstrated that the seropositivity rate for HBoV increases with age, reaching nearly 100% by 6 years of age [9], [10]. Recent data show that HBoV1 is often shed for a long time after primary infection into the respiratory tracts of infants and young children. HBoV1 DNA and anti-HBoV1 antibodies in serum differentiate primary HBoV1 infection from long term post infection shedding [11], with detection of HBoV1 DNA in blood more closely associated with symptoms than positive respiratory samples alone [9].",

However, recent studies have implied that high viral load, detection of HBoV alone and viraemia may be associated with RTIs [14], with mono-infection of HBoV being associated with higher viral load than co-infection [15]. Two case reports about severe respiratory disease found a statistical association between HBoV1 and otherwise unexplained LRTIs, in particular, acute wheezing [16], [17], [18]. This suggests that HBoV1 infection, although mainly asymptomatic, has the potential to cause severe disease.",

Previous studies including children with acute respiratory tract infections conducted in Shanghai reported HBoV infection rates of 4.6% to 11.8% [19], [20]. In our study the positive rate of HBoV of NPAs from patients with LRTIs was 7.2% (42/583), consistent with previous studies. Importantly, the present study reported six patients with NPAs, serum and stool being HBoV positive. The median viral load of NPAs for these 6 patients were significantly higher than other HBoV-positive samples (5.1\u00d7106 vs 6.3\u00d7108, p\u22640.05). Detection of HBoV genomic DNA in blood with high viral load in NPAs strengthened the causal link between the virus and disease, which agrees with findings in other studies [9], [14]. The only subtype of HBoV circulating in Shanghai was HBoV1; HBoV2-4 were not detected. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the HBoV1 strain circulating in Shanghai is closely related to the FZ40 and WLL-1 strains reported from Fuzhou and Hangzhou, China. Interestingly, we found that HBoV1 co-circulated, to a large extent, with RSVA in the study period with peaks in autumn and winter. RSVA was the most often detected virus in NPAs followed by HRV and AdV, correlating with viruses co-detected with HBoV1, with 47.4% of co-infected patients being infected with RSVA and 15.6% with HRV.",

Given that the most frequently co-detected virus with HBoV was RSVA, which can also cause severe LRTIs in children, the frequency of RSVA in different disease severity groups was analyzed. The percentage of RSVA co-detection with HBoV was not significantly higher than other infectious viruses in all disease severity groups (p value: mild 0.6393, moderate 0.1006, severe 0.0670).
