These analyses often focused on transmissibility and reproduction numbers rather than on forecasting the future impact of the epidemic. Indeed, forecasting is difficult before the epidemic reaches its peak, all the more when information on natural history, transmissibility and under-reporting is limited [15]. Yet, it is precisely at the beginning of an outbreak that forecasts would help public health authorities decide on the best strategies for control or mitigation.",

But in addition to specifying a model, selecting good parameter values is also essential to obtain good predictions. In models for directly transmitted diseases, this can come from realistic demographic and behavioral characteristics, for example the contact frequency between individuals [20], mobility patterns [21\u201324], and from clinical and epidemiological characteristics like the duration of the serial interval [25]. Such information is less easily available and more limited for mosquito-transmitted diseases [26]. However, outbreaks of the same disease or diseases with similar routes of transmission may have occurred in the same or similar locations, so that relevant information may be recovered from the analysis of past outbreaks.",

Surveillance data on CHIKV epidemics in the French West Indies was available from local health authorities (S2 Dataset (D2)) [30]. Finally, we also selected the ZIKV and CHIKV epidemics that occured in six islands or archipelagoes of French Polynesia between 2013 and 2017, as they provided information on the differences between the two diseases.

The generation time distribution was reconstructed by estimating the durations of each part of the infection cycle using disease- and mosquito-specific data from the literature, and assuming a fixed local temperature of 28\u00b0C, as described in more detail in the supplementary appendix. This led to gamma distributions with mean 2.5 weeks (standard deviation: 0.7) for ZIKV and with mean 1.6 weeks (sd: 0.6) for CHIKV.",

We first analysed jointly the three CHIKV epidemics in dataset D2 using model 1, introducing a two-level hierarchical structure for the island-specific parameters: an island-specific reproduction number R0,C,i sampled from a top-level regional distribution N(\u03bcR0,C,\u03c3R0,C), and similarly logit(\u03c1C,i)\u223cN(\u03bc\u03c1C,\u03c3\u03c1C) for the logit of the reporting rate. We obtained the posterior distributions of these parameters for the CHIKV outbreaks in each island \u03c0(R0,C,i,\u03c1C,i|D2), as well as that of the hyperparameters \u03c0(\u03bcR0,C,\u03c3R0,C,\u03bc\u03c1,C,\u03c3\u03c1,C|D2).",

Using the R priors reduced the gap between forecasts and future observation. Major improvements in both accuracy and sharpness were obtained only with L priors.

Overall, the quality of the forecasts improved as K increases in all three islands and also as prior distributions brought more specific information.

Historical data on CHIKV epidemics was therefore used to build informative a priori distributions on the two key parameters R0,Z and \u03c1Z. Hierarchical models are particularly adapted to this task, as they naturally pool information among several past epidemics and capture both within- and between-location variability [43]. We used separate hierarchical models to obtain information about (i) transmissibility and reporting during CHIKV outbreaks in the French West Indies and (ii) relative transmissibility and reporting between ZIKV and CHIKV in French Polynesia, rather than from a global joint model (as in [44]). This choice was made to show that prior information can be combined from separate sources in a modular way. We finally considered two versions of informative priors to capture different degrees of knowledge. The \u201cLocal\u201d priors corresponded with estimates for the previous CHIKV epidemic in the same island, therefore including island-specific epidemic drivers, such as population structure and distribution, socio-economic circumstances and environmental conditions. On the other hand, the \u201cRegional\u201d priors encompassed the diversity of past observations within the region, making priors valid for a typical island of the West Indies, especially when no other epidemic has been observed previously.",

Indeed, early forecasts of epidemic size were largely off-target and unstable, varying between 0.2 and 5.8 times the eventually observed total incidence. Worst case projections on maximal incidence were very imprecise, ranging between 2 and 63 times the eventually reached maximal weekly incidence. Using historical data led to a substantial increase of the quality of these forecasts from the very early stages of the epidemics. Using \u201clocal\u201d priors, the ratio between forecasts and reality ranged between 0.4 and 1.5 for epidemic size and between 1.3 and 3.9 for maximal incidence. The less specific \u201cregional\u201d priors increased accuracy and sharpness as well, though to a lesser extent. However, the date of peak incidence and the date of the end of the period of high epidemic activity were only slightly improved by integrating historical data.",

This suggests that prior information is essentially required for the reporting rate, a difficult to estimate quantity as already noted [15]. Sensitivity analysis support this result.

As of now, comparisons targeted the merits of different models including exponential growth models, sigmoid models, or mechanistic epidemic models [45]. Our work provides a complementary approach where information from past epidemics is combined using hierarchical models to inform on parameter ranges, thus increasing the reliability of early forecasts. It was applied here to a dynamic discrete-time SIR model that for its parsimony is well-adapted to real-time forecasting. Complex mechanistic models can provide a more realistic description of the epidemic, accounting, for instance, for heterogenous spatial distribution of individuals and mobility coupling\u2014a relevant ingredient for describing epidemics in more extended spatial areas \u2013, or vector population dynamics and its mixing with humans.

Other modelling papers specifically attempted to take advantage of the similarities between different Aedes-transmitted diseases, e.g., by estimating the risk of acquiring chikungunya from the prevalence of dengue [52] or by assesssing the spatio-temporal coherence of chikungunya, Zika and dengue [53]. Also, using informative priors to make up for the lack of information during the early stages of an epidemic has been done before. For instance, a priori information from the ZIKV epidemics in French Polynesia has been used to support the early forecasts of health-care requirements for the ZIKV epidemic in Martinique [38]. In this case, however, authors concluded that a prior built from an epidemic in a different location resulted in inaccurate predictions at the early stage. We found a similar result in a sensitivity analysis: the direct use of information from ZIKV in French Polynesia, or alternatively the direct use of information from CHIKV in the French West Indies, without adjusting for ZIKV, leads to poor overall forecasting quality compared to the L prior considered here (S1 Appendix).",

            "text": "This shows that the choice of appropriate historical data is the cornerstone of any such attempt. Yet little is known regarding the comparative epidemiology of diseases in the same or similar places and on the condition where transportability can be assumed. For influenza, it has been reported that the reproduction ratios in two successive flu pandemics (1889 and 1918) showed substantial correlation (r = 0.62) in the same US cities, even years apart [54]. For Aedes-transmitted diseases, comparisons of ZIKV and dengue virus outbreaks [55] and of ZIKV with CHIKV outbreaks [44] in the same locations have highlighted similarities in the epidemic dynamics. In any case, careful consideration of all the factors that may influence transmission and reporting is needed. For example, contrary to CHIKV, some cases of sexual transmission have been reported for ZIKV [56, 57]. Yet, no epidemics were seen in locations without enough Aedes mosquitoes, as for example in metropolitan France, despite the introductions of several hundreds ZIKV infected cases [58]. This justifies the use of CHIKV epidemic data to provide prior information on ZIKV in the epidemic context considered here. More generally, documenting, analyzing and comparing more systematically past epidemics [59] is necessary to provide the data required to derive prior information. In particular, informed with epidemiological records of the recent CHIKV and ZIKV epidemics, our approach could be applied to potential future emergences of other Aedes-transmitted diseases such as Mayaro virus [60], Ross River virus [61] or Usutu virus [62] once transportability is deemed plausible.",
