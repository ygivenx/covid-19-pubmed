Mortality from anthroponotic respiratory pneumoviruses (family Pneumoviridae) and paramyxoviruses (family Paramyxoviridae) has been documented in western chimpanzees (P. t. verus) in Cote d'Ivoire [1,6], eastern chimpanzees (P. t. schweinfurthii) in Tanzania [7], mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) in Rwanda, lowland gorillas (G. g. gorilla) in Central African Republic [8] and bonobos (P. paniscus) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo [9]. Rhinovirus C [10] and coronavirus OC43 [11] of human origin have also caused chimpanzee mortality in Uganda and mild respiratory disease in Cote d'Ivoire, respectively.",

Although simultaneous infections of apes and people with the same respiratory virus have rarely been confirmed directly [8,11], viruses that are relatively benign in humans can cause lethal outbreaks in ape populations, indicating lack of resistance in apes. Suitable prevention strategies have included improved hygiene and sanitation [13], reduced human visitation [14] and large-scale vaccination of apes (if effective vaccines someday become available) [15]. Such policies could also benefit human public health by reducing zoonotic transmission risk [16,17].",

Fresh carcasses are often not recovered, and the remoteness of field sites complicates sample storage and analysis. Non-invasive diagnostics (usually from feces) have proven highly informative [6], but negative results in such cases are inconclusive [10]. In the present case, rapid recovery of carcasses, the presence of trained veterinarians and the availability of basic field laboratory capabilities on site provided an opportunity for etiologic diagnoses. Furthermore, coordinated, prospective collection of observational data between the two sites offered an unusual chance to compare the clinical and epidemiologic features of the outbreaks directly.",

During the same period, the nearby Kanyawara community (Figure S1) also experienced a respiratory disease outbreak. At the onset of the epidemics, Ngogo community consisted of 205 chimpanzees from <1 year to 67 years old, and Kanyawara community consisted of 55 chimpanzees from <1 year to 51 years old. Epidemic curves (Figure 1) show that the Ngogo and Kanyawara outbreaks each occurred in a single phase, with most cases occurring in January 2017. At Ngogo, 43.8% of chimpanzees observed between 3 December 2016 and 28 February 2017 exhibited respiratory signs. At Kanyawara, 69.1% of chimpanzees observed during the same period exhibited respiratory signs. At Ngogo, 25 chimpanzees (12.2%) died during the outbreak period (Figure 1). In contrast, no chimpanzees at Kanyawara died during the outbreak period, with the exception of a female recovering from disease who died following conspecific aggression (see below). Respiratory signs consisted of coughing, sneezing, dyspnea, and nasal exudate; other signs included lethargy, immobility, and dramatic loss of body condition (Figure S2).\n",

Viral sequences from affected individuals were identical within the variable region sequenced. MPV and HRV3 were therefore likely single-origin causes of their respective epidemics. Adenoviruses and enteroviruses were present both before and during the outbreaks at statistically indistinguishable (AdV) and low (EV) frequencies. Adenoviruses occur in both healthy and ill wild apes [28\u201331] and in chimpanzees during respiratory outbreaks [32], including at Kanyawara [10], leading to debate about their etiologic role; however, our results support previous conclusions that these viruses are most likely benign. Our results support a similar conclusion for enteroviruses, with the notable exceptions of polio virus [3,33] and rhinoviruses [10], which can cause deadly disease in chimpanzees.",

Moreover, avian influenza had recently been reported in waterfowl in Lake Victoria, on the other side of Uganda [34]. Our results highlight how heightened vigilance for emerging infectious diseases can sometimes lead to erroneous inferences. Common environmental drivers (e.g. weather, human visitation patterns) may precipitate simultaneous outbreaks of distinct anthroponotic viruses in wild apes, creating the appearance of a single disease with a seasonal pattern. Our results also suggest that the transmission of respiratory viruses between chimpanzee communities is probably uncommon, despite high rates of transmission within chimpanzee communities. Chimpanzees from neighbouring communities rarely interact [33], which may limit opportunities for inter-community transmission even of highly contagious microbes.",

HRV3 has been detected in the respiratory tracts of apparently healthy wild yellow baboons in Zambia [24]. Experimental infection of marmosets (Saguinus mystax) with HRV3 causes acute and transmissible disease [42], but experimental infection of other primates, including rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) and chimpanzees [43], is milder.

Our finding of a low percentage of metagenomic sequence reads matching S. pneumoniae (or a related bacterium) in the upper respiratory tracts of both necropsied individuals, but not in their lungs, supports the notion that wild chimpanzees host microbes that could easily invade the lower respiratory tract following primary viral infection.

Post-mortem analysis of one individual at Ngogo revealed surprisingly little gross pathology of the respiratory tract, consistent with acute infection and rapid death, and MPV was recovered from all sections of that individual\u2019s respiratory tract, including the lung parenchyma (Figures S4 and S5). In contrast, post-mortem analysis of an individual at Kanyawara revealed advanced respiratory tract pathology, consistent with longer term infection (Figure S5), but we did not recover HRV3 from this individual\u2019s respiratory tract despite recovering a complete HRV3 genome from this same individual\u2019s feces collected approximately 2 weeks earlier. This individual had likely recovered from the initial viral challenge, cleared the virus, and perhaps acquired a secondary bacterial infection [9,22].

The Ngogo MPV variant clusters within a sub-clade of viruses that is more recent (2008\u20132017) than other sub-clades, perhaps reflecting antigenic replacement of MPV strains over time. Notably, the Ngogo variant is very similar to a virus from a fatal infection of a mountain gorilla in Rwanda in 2009 [21]. This particular viral lineage may thus have a propensity for infecting apes, or it may simply circulate widely in East Africa.

            "text": "The pathways by which these viruses entered chimpanzees from humans remain vexingly obscure. People frequent the habitats of both chimpanzee communities for research and associated activities (not solely focused on chimpanzees) and to travel or collect forest products [47]. Tourism is sometimes cited as a risk for anthroponotic transmission of viruses to great apes and helps inform current International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) recommendations for preventing such transmission, such as visitor vaccination requirements, minimum observation distances, alcohol-based sanitizing gel and facemasks [13]. However, neither Ngogo nor Kanyawara is a tourism site. Ngogo is bordered by a tourism site (Kanyanchu) receiving thousands of visitors each year, but there were no reports of a concurrent respiratory disease outbreak in the Kanyanchu chimpanzees, although similar events have occurred there at other times. At Gombe National Park in Tanzania, provisioning chimpanzees with bananas (a discontinued practice) was, along with season, the strongest predictor of chimpanzee respiratory signs [48], which affected between 0% and 9% of chimpanzees per month between 2005 and 2012 [4]. However, neither the Ngogo nor the Kanyawara chimpanzees are provisioned, and biosecurity measures based on IUCN recommendations [13] for visitors to both sites are in place. At Kanyawara, data over 22 years show a seasonal pattern of respiratory illness in chimpanzees, typically peaking in March, but no correlation between clinical signs in chimpanzees and seasonal patterns of respiratory illness in humans living nearby [5]. The role of other species in transmitting these viruses from humans to chimpanzees is also unclear. Kibale National Park contains a diversity of primate species and social groups, none of which were observed with respiratory signs at the time of the outbreaks, but complex patterns of cross-species transmission from humans to chimpanzees cannot be discounted. Such possibilities could be investigated through broad sampling of people (especially research staff) and wildlife during future outbreaks, including serologic assessments of prior exposure.",
