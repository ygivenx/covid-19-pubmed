CHIKV is an arthropod\u2013borne virus which can be transmitted to humans by Aedes mosquitoes [2], widespread in some tropical regions [3]\u2013[8]. Aedes albopictus is highly competent for CHIKV [9], [10]. In Italy, the presence of this mosquito was first documented in Genoa and Padua (Northern Italy) in the earliest 1990's [11], [12]. Over the following years, Aedes albopictus expanded its distribution and is now well established in Northern and Central Italy [13], [14]. Having the potential to colonize the Mediterranean basin [15], the species has been reported from most Mediterranean European countries [16]. Samples of Aedes albopictus from the two villages were found to be positive for CHIKV sequences [1].",

Besides parameters more strictly related to the infectious process,  is an increasing function of the square of , as the biting rate controls transmission from humans to mosquitoes and from mosquitoes to humans, and the ratio of vectors to humans  (see Fig. S5). However, it should be considered that Eq. (8) depends on the number of vectors  which substantially varies over time as a results of seasonal meteorological factors. Thus, as for models explicitly considering seasonal variations in transmission, it is difficult to precisely define . Therefore, we computed  by considering the average value of  from June 21 to July 26 2007 (i.e. the initial phase of the epidemic), as predicted by the vector dynamics model. We estimated  to be 3.3 on average (95% CI 1.8\u20136, see Fig. 4e). The estimated biting rate increases by decreasing the number of breeding sites and, consequently, estimates of  do not change substantially by varying the number of breeding sites ( = 50 ha:  days, 95% CI 0.1\u20130.26 days, , 95% CI 1.9\u20135.5;  = 100 ha:  days, 95% CI 0.08\u20130.2 days, , 95% CI 1.9\u20135.2;  = 150 ha:  days, 95% CI 0.06\u20130.15 days, , 95% CI 2.1\u20135, see Fig. 4b and Fig. 4e). Fig. 4d shows that  is below the critical threshold for all vales of  and thus the epidemic is mainly determined by , i.e. by transmission from humans to vectors. As for the effective reproduction number  (i.e., the average number of secondary cases generated per primary case at a given time), which accounts for both depletion of susceptible individuals and mosquito dynamics, its value over time is shown in Fig. 4c and Fig. 4f (by considering or not interventions). It emerges that , which does not change much by varying the number of breeding sites, can vary substantially over time as an effect of mosquito dynamics. This suggests that  could have been even larger, depending on the time of epidemic seeding.",

Through model simulations, we evaluated the effects of strategies mimicking the timing of the actual interventions undertaken in Italy. As for the effects in terms of reduction of breeding sites, eggs, larvae and adults, likely values are: 20% to 60% as for reduction breeding sites and eggs, 80% to 95% as for reduction of larvae and 80% to 95% as for reduction of adults. We discuss first results obtained by assuming 40% as for reduction of breeding sites and eggs, 90% as for reduction of larvae and 95% as for reduction of adults. The effects of such an intervention are shown in Fig. 5c. The resulting cumulative attack rate, by assuming  ha, was estimated to be 8.7% (95% CI 5.6%\u201312.7%, see Fig. 5d), in good agreement with the observed value, namely 8.4%, computed by multiplying the overall observed prevalence, 10.2% [18], by the symptomatic ratio \n[18]. Results are similar for other choices of  (for instance, for  = 50 ha the figure becomes , 95% CI 5.3%\u201313%; see also Fig. S6). To keep track of the number of symptomatic cases identified by the active surveillance system, we assume that human symptomatic cases are identified with probability  and this allows fitting notification data in model simulations. According to model estimates, the number of notified cases would have been about 185 on average (95% CI 117\u2013278), in good agreement with the number as reported to the surveillance system, namely 161 cases [1]. The number of cases drastically decreased in late August while the effective reproduction number, in the absence of interventions, would have fallen below the epidemic threshold in late September (see Fig. 4c and Fig. 4f). This proves that a combined strategy resulted in a drastic reduction of the epidemic impact, despite the relatively large value of .",

Quite the contrary, adulticides were used for a very limited period of time (3 days) and thus their effect is limited due to the rapid increase of adults suddenly after the intervention.

Cervia and Ravenna are the main towns of the municipalities where the two most affected villages (Castiglione di Cervia and Castiglione di Ravenna) are located. The two affected villages account for the 2.1% of the population of the municipalities of Cervia (27,000 inhabitants) and Ravenna (157,000 inhabitants). By analyzing commuting data of the Emilia\u2013Romagna region [47], we found that the number of individuals traveling daily to Cervia and Ravenna for work or study is 8,787 (from 249 different municipalities), and the number of persons traveling daily from Cervia and Ravenna to other municipalities is 10,861 (towards 139 different municipalities). The exact number of commuters for Castiglione di Cervia and Castiglione di Ravenna is unknown but it should not exceed 2.1% of the overall number of commuters. However, the probability of traveling from/to a certain municipality should be similar to that observed for the two municipalities as a whole and we found that clusters of local transmission were recorded in municipalities well connected with the municipalities of Ravenna and Cervia (see Table 4). For at least four of the five clusters, population movement (i.e., persons who visited the area that was primarily affected or persons from the primarily affected area who visited one of the four towns) can be reasonably assumed to have been the main determinant of local transmission. Another possible explanation is passive vector mobility (e.g. infected mosquitoes transported by car from the initial cluster), since the flight range (active mobility) is usually considered to be less than 1 km [35], [48], [49].",

However, being the reproduction number strongly dependent on the density of mosquitoes, which in turn varies a lot over time as a consequence of seasonal meteorological effects, different (even larger) values of  could be observed in future outbreaks, depending on the time of epidemic seeding. In [3], by adapting a method originally introduced in [50] for human\u2013to\u2013human infections,  was estimated from the generation interval probability distribution function and the number of gonotrophic cycles of the mosquito. This method can not be applied in our study, as the undertaken control measures have contributed to alter the gonotrophic cycles of the mosquito in a indeterminable manner. We found that the probability of observing a major outbreak after the introduction of an index case depends on the ratio of mosquitoes to humans and was estimated to be in the range of 32%\u201376%. These results confirm the high risk to Europe of tropical vector\u2013borne diseases as a consequence of globalization, which has been modifying the mobility of humans and vectors.

We assume density\u2013dependent growth only in eggs, though other density\u2013dependent regulating processes should be considered for other lifestages of the mosquitoes, e.g. larvae and pupae [25]. These modeling choices are due to the lack of data for parametrizing the model. The lack of information on the actual number of breeding sites \u2013 it could be assessed only by performing a field study \u2013 prevent us to give precise estimates on the density of mosquitoes over time in the study area.

Moreover, the temporal dynamics of the vector is qualitatively well captured by model  (though not in terms of absolute abundance) and this allowed us to clarify whether or not the sharp decrease in the number of cases observed after the intervention was due to the intervention itself or to the spontaneous reduction of adults due to decrease of temperature.
