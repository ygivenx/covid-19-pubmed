            "text": "Measles is a highly contagious acute viral disease. Throughout the world, and most countries have set goals for its elimination. In 1978, the national Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) in China started to implement a standard schedule for the routine administration of one dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) among children between 8 and 24 months of age. Subsequently, the mean annual measles incidence decreased from 355 per 100,000 in 1970\u20131979 to 53 per 100,000 in 1980\u20131989 [1]. In 1986, a two-dose routine measles immunization program was implemented for children aged between 8 months and 7 years. The age schedule for the second dose of MCV (MCV2) was shifted to 18\u201324 months in 2005. During 2000\u20132009, the number of measles cases showed a remarkable decrease but remained around 6.8 per 100,000 on average [2]. In 2006, the government of China set a goal to eliminate measles by 2012, for which purpose a series of programs was implemented, including strengthening routine immunization surveillance, supplementary immunization activities (SIAs), and case-based surveillance [2]. An SIA is defined as the administration of a supplementary dose of a vaccine to a specific age population in a certain area during a short period, regardless of the recipients' previous vaccination histories. SIAs enhance routine immunization programs, including catch-up campaigns, follow-up campaigns, and outbreak-response immunization. The estimated coverage rate of routine immunization with MCV1 increased from 80.4% in 2000 to 91.1% in 2009, whereas the estimated coverage rate for MCV2 was <80% before 2005 and 84.3% in 2009 [1]. In September 2010, China conducted a synchronized, nationwide SIA that targeted children aged 8 months to 14 years, covering 102 million children with a reported coverage rate of 97.5% [1\u20133]. Although the annual measles incidence had dropped to 0.46 per 100,000 in 2012, it resurged to more than 1.96 per 100,000 in 2013 [3]. Despite the implementation of two-dose routine vaccines since 2005, frequent outbreaks have occurred over the past years [4\u20136].",

It is defined as the expected average number of secondary cases produced by an infectious individual in a population in which not all the individuals are susceptible [9]. When R is larger than 1, an infectious individual is expected to infect more than one secondary case. When R is less than 1, an infectious individual tends to infect less than one secondary case, and the incidence will decrease. Nevertheless, some infectious diseases have been shown to be strongly age-specific, for example, measles. Age-specific R, defined as an average total number of secondary cases from all age groups generated by a single case with respect to his age group was recommended to study the differences in transmission potential taking account of social mixing [10\u201315]. Although a usual interpretation of age-specific R for gauging the control measures required to eliminate an infection is inappropriate [16, 17], age-specific Rs provide valuable information on the underlying heterogeneous transmission between and within different groups of individuals. For example, Glass et al. estimated the Rs of pandemic influenza A(H1N1) for children and adults and identified children had a higher transmission then adult cases.",

An in-house survey of a similar cohort of children aged 24\u201347 months showed that MCV1 and MCV2 coverage rates were only 83% and 75%, respectively [25], results that were inconsistent with the generally reported figure of >98% in China [27]. The geographic heterogeneity of vaccine coverage in China could be another explanation [28, 29]. A Chinese study indicated that the measles antibody levels of children aged 2\u201310 years old were significantly lower for residents of rural areas than for residents of urban areas [28]. The primary reasons why rural children had missed their MCVs were because they were living far from the clinics and because they were unable to access vaccination information [30]. The incomplete immunization records of rural children also made it more difficult for public health officials to track them in order to administer the vaccine.",

A longitudinal study of maternal measles antibody titers in infants in Guangzhou (the provincial capital of Guangdong Province) showed that titers among infants decreased rapidly after 3 months of age, and were generally undetectable at 7 months of age [31]. Several other studies reported similar results [32, 33]. Hence, there was a remarkable immunity gap among children under 8 months old. Some studies showed that only around 2.7% to 6.8% of infants are seropositive for measles at 6 months of age [34, 35]. Nevertheless, even though infants aged 0\u20138 months were identified as a high transmissibility group, reducing the minimum age for receiving MCV-1 to 6 months is controversial. We also found that the transmissions from children aged 7\u201315 years were comparatively low, which was expected given that given that they were the main target of previous SIAs. Moreover, many primary schools implemented screening of children\u2019s vaccination certificates and administered supplementary doses of the measles vaccine to fill immunity gaps before the annual entrance [36].",

Persons aged 26\u201345 years at the time of the present study were thought to be the first recipients of the vaccination after the approval of routine immunization. Liquid vaccines were used for immunization at that time. They had a lower effective dosage and may have resulted in the lower level or shorter protective duration of antibodies among the population. In addition, a functional cold chain, transportation, and communication system for the measles vaccine had not been established at that time; hence, the quality and efficacy of the vaccines could not be guaranteed. Secondly, several parents knew nothing about the measles vaccine and underestimated the severity of measles, thereby resulting in a low vaccination rate and a high rate of unsure inoculation history. Thirdly, secondary vaccine failure (i.e. measles onset after vaccination and successful seroconversion) due to waning immunity might have occurred among vaccinated adults. Although our study could not identify secondary vaccine failure from other cases as serological evidence of previous successful vaccination were lacked, it has been concluded by WHO that waning immunity has not played a major role in the transmission of measles compared to the absence of initial immunity [37]. The proportion of cases attributable to secondary vaccine failure varied greatly across outbreaks [38]. In a cohort study (n = 2882) in Zhuji County of Zhejiang province, around 11\u201313% of those given with single doses of domestic vaccines would become sero-negative (measured by haemagglutination-inhibition tests) after 14 years, yet clinical measles cases rarely happened among them who had humoral immunity waned as they were still protected by secondary immune response [37,39]. Finally, the subsequent SIAs did not cover these persons; thus, the immunity gaps among people aged 26 to 45 years increased.",

One reason for this is that rural families usually have a lower level of education and do not fully understand information regarding mop-up campaigns, which results in a lack of initiative to get the vaccine. Moreover, some of the susceptibles were migrants, and officials reported difficulties tracking their vaccination histories. Although door-to-door notifications, text messages, and telephone notifications have been used to inform migrant families to join mop-up campaigns [42], it is often difficult to contact these families because of changes to their addresses or phone numbers.",

            "text": "One of the major limitations in this study is the quality of notification data. Indeed, a proportion (~30%) of the notification data in the early phase study (2009\u20132011) was only clinically confirmed which may lead to some misdiagnosis as well as an underestimate of the age-specific Rs. Nevertheless, more than 95% of cases were laboratory confirmed after 2011. Particularly, the reliance on clinically confirmation was more in rural hospitals in which doctors may lack sufficient knowledge on measles diagnosis. The positive predictive value of a clinical definition would also be changed over time as measles has become rarer by time. To minimize the chance of misdiagnosis, the clinically confirmed cases were not only identified by clinical symptoms, but were also investigated with any potential epidemiological association with other laboratory-confirmed cases. Moreover, the completeness of the data could be affected by underreporting as some of the parents might have regarded measles as a kind of skin disease or might have confused it with other diseases that involve skin rashes. Apart from that, age-specific Rs are common to be used as a metric to identify appropriate age groups most responsible for transmission as for a target of interventions [10, 12, 13]. However, when determining the effort required to eliminate an infection, the interpretation of an age-specific R is different from that of an overall R in a heterogeneous population as using the original threshold of unity could lead to an underestimation of target population for interventions [16, 17]. Alternatively, Roberts & Heesterbeek [17] suggested a type-reproduction number which can single out particular subgroup rather than averaging over all subgroups. Further works such as generalizability and statistical inference [16] on the alternative measures worth being investigated.",
