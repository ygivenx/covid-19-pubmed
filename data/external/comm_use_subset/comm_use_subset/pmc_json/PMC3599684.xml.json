With a mutation rate of ~1 error per 10,000 nucleotides copied, a point mutation is introduced nearly every time a single RNA virus replicates [1]. Any given viral sample extracted from a host contains a spectrum of related genotypes, referred to as a quasispecies, whose ability to rapidly evolve underlies viral virulence, vaccine resistance and host-jumping [2]. Understanding the mutational dynamics of RNA viruses is key to our understanding of viral disease progression, transmission and the development of antiviral therapeutics.",

            "text": "Considerable progress has been made recently using deep sequencing to characterize the mutant spectra in several human RNA viral pathogens: human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [3-6], hepatitis C virus (HCV) [7-9] and influenza [10,11]. In particular, deep sequencing has been used to identify medically relevant drug-resistant rare variants that impact anti-retroviral drug treatment outcomes [11-15]. Many of the earliest efforts have targeted specific hyper variable genomic regions using 454 sequencing; more recently published studies have begun to target more of the genome with high depths using the greater sequencing output of Illumina technologies [16,17]. Recently, the software tool for managing deep sequencing data, Segminator II, was introduced and used to compare performance of Illumina and 454 deep sequencing of influenza [18]. However, less emphasis was given to evaluating a general subconsensus base calling procedure and the impact of PCR amplification was not considered. Two other available packages that address PCR errors and known sequencing error modes, AmpliconNoise [19] and RC454 [20], are designed specifically for 454 pyrosequencing data. In a recent Illumina deep sequencing study of foot-and-mouth disease virus samples, Wright et al. [21] counted evidence for between 1,434 and 2,622 rare variants present in their samples. Their approach relied on an estimated error rate from the sequencer without the use of sequencing controls and included sequencing each sample twice to correct for sequencing error, which would present practical problems for sequencing larger numbers of samples collected from an outbreak. Moreover, recent work has indicated the presence of non-uniform error rates in Illumina sequence data in particular, and highlights the ongoing challenge of correctly separating the true mutant spectra from sequencing related errors [15,22-24].",

Given the potential for RNA viruses that circulate in a non-human host reservoir to infect new host types, including humans [25], it is important to study viral evolution at the highest resolution for measuring genetic change. Characterizing these viruses pose a particular challenge since the starting material can be too small (or rare) to directly sequence without PCR amplification or growth in cell culture, which can introduce new errors to the measurement process [26]. As a pilot study for a series of viral evolution studies, three viral samples collected from naturally infected hosts--two fox rabies brain tissue samples and one bovine coronavirus (BCV) nasal sample\u2013were sequenced using Illumina paired-end read technology at ultra-deep coverage (> 300,000x raw reads). Two plasmid clones containing 1 kb region of the rabies and BCV genomes served as error controls in the study. Error rates seen in plasmids provided a best estimate of the combined PCR and sequencing error rate for the natural samples [27].",

Overlapping read pairs have not been previously applied to mutant spectra profiling to improve the sensitivity of variant detection. We demonstrate the novel use of mismatch rates in the overlapping read pairs (ORP) to provide an unbiased assessment of the sequencer-derived quality scores when selecting a read filtering threshold, as well as to estimate position-dependent sequencing errors without relying on a clonal control. Our methods identified a high variation in error rates between sequencers and indicated the difficulty of relying on traditional sequencing approaches for rare variant characterization. Moreover, we demonstrate that PCR amplification can become the dominant source of error over the sequencer\u2019s error even when using a high fidelity polymerase. Among the three natural viral samples we sequenced, we identified up to 2,133 rare variants within a single sample with an in-host population frequency as rare as 0.0096%. Given the majority of the variants we discovered occurred at the ultra-rare level (< 0.1%), we show that careful error control and estimation using ORP can reveal a deep and rich mutant spectrum. Our results demonstrate a practical sequencing and computational analytic approach to studying viral evolution with an unprecedented level of genetic resolution.",

Second, although the mismatched bases were excluded from data analysis, they provided an empirical estimate for single-read sequencing error rates.

These average ORP mismatch rates are shown in Table 2. While mismatches occurred at the approximate rate of ~7 per 1000 unfiltered base pairs; with Q30 filtering, the mismatch rate dropped three orders of magnitude to ~4 per 1 million base pairs (averaged over 5 samples).

The mean mismatch rates among the raw, Q10, Q20, Q30 and Q35 ORPs were 6.7\u00d710-3, 8.8\u00d710-4, 1.2\u00d710-4, 4.0\u00d710-6, 2.5\u00d710-7, respectively (Table 2, average of 5 samples), far lower than what their Illumina Q-scores suggest. However, when the rabies control plasmid was sequenced a second time, the resulting ORP mismatch rate profile was quite different. Though the mismatch rates were comparable to the first run in the raw, unfiltered ORP reads, they were significantly higher in the second run when comparing the same Q thresholds (Table 2). At Q30, ORP mismatch rates in the first run were two orders of magnitude lower than the rabies control repeat run. Given the same model of Next Generation Sequencing instrument (Illumina GA IIx) was used in both sequencing runs, the most parsimoneous explanation for the difference in ORP mismatch rates is the difference in the Q-score calibration of the two instruments. This underscores the utility of using ORP to recover an empirical sequencing error rate and minimize technical artifacts introduced by the sequencer.",

            "text": "Several alternative ultra-sensitive mutation detection approaches have been proposed recently for next generation sequencing [15,31,32], but they require significant sample preparation and may not be practical beyond targeting limited regions of a genome. Both Duplex Sequencing [32] and Safe-SeqS [31] require labeling the DNA fragment libraries with unique sequence tags (UID) prior to PCR amplification. Post-sequencing, mutations that occur in the majority of their uniquely tagged read families are identified as true variants. These methods successfully address the errors introduced during PCR and sequencing but are subject to the efficiency of the UID assignment. A significant fraction of the starting material is generally lost in the library prep procedures for Illumina sequencing due to poor adapter ligation efficiency and the requirement of multiple clean-up cycles. If a sample contains limited starting material for sequencing, as is often the case in viral or clinical samples, performing adapter ligation prior to PCR amplification will likely lead to poor representation of the sample. Furthermore, the additional UID assignment process adds to the complexity and cost of sample preparation. Thus while these methods present a possible approach for the future, their scalability to whole genome sequencing has not yet been demonstrated. Flaherty et al. [15] proposed an ultrasensitive mutation detection method for targeted resequencing using a position-specific error profile. They derive the position-specific error profile of a 700 bp region of the NA gene in H1N1 using a clone of the sample of interest. This approach while highly specific, also does not scale to whole genome analysis. In contrast to these methods, we suggest that the use of ORPs to derive error profiles is easily extendible to a genome of any size without the use of a cloned sample. Comparable fragment length and read length is the only requirement to generate ORPs.",

The results show there are compelling benefits to using overlapping read pairs, which lead us to favor their use whenever feasible. Yet the results also show that with careful filtering, single reads provide a viable option when PCR amplification is used in the sample preparation stage, and enough experience with the specific sequencer is available to eliminate the impact of unexpected changes in calibrated quality scores or other technical configuration changes. The advantage of ORPs is the dynamic context specific error estimation and error correction, which significantly reduces sequencing error and is more robust in the face of configuration changes across sequencing machines.",

We provided theoretical maximum sensitivity for a given coverage at three different error rates (Figure 5B).

For our samples, the \u2018ultra-rare\u2019 mutants make up a majority of the sub-consensus population (Figure 5A). These ultra-rare mutants greatly increase the genetic diversity in the quasispecies and may play important roles in acute viral infectious diseases. While it remains an open question as to their ultimate importance for downstream applications, our results illustrate the significance of reduced error and increased coverage in recovering these rare mutations. Reliable rare variant detection and sequence error reduction is important for many research areas beyond virology. Our methods have applications in clinical diagnostics [15,31], forensics [33] and DNA-based information storage system [34].
