The terms of reference of this Committee, which consists of specialists in Public Health Medicine, are 1) to act as a forum for sharing experience and knowledge regarding preparedness for, and response to, communicable disease incidents at points of entry, and 2) to organise training and desktop exercises to test the guidelines that have been produced. In addition, the group also aims to progress multidisciplinary working in relation to Port Health.",

Some of the airports then sought additional advice for specific staff groups such as baggage handlers and immigration officers and presentations were prepared and given to the relevant stakeholders. In November 2014 25,000 information leaflets and posters in English, Irish and French were prepared and distributed through to Ireland\u2019s six airports (Fig. 2). In February 2015 updated guidance was issued containing additional information for airport and airline staff in view of how the global situation had evolved over the preceding months.\n",

In the case of EVD, people with infection crossed borders within Africa and to Europe and to North America where they unintentionally caused small chains of transmission far from the outbreak\u2019s epicentre [5]. The actions taken globally in relation to EVD - and more recently Zika - have highlighted many of the inadequacies inherent within the international response mechanisms aimed at dealing with these crises, and health systems therefore need to be strengthened and prepared, not just for EVD and Zika, but for all new and emerging diseases which hold outbreak potential [6].",

Progress was also made at the operational level, with clarity brought to case and contact management through the development of agreed protocols. While welcome, this work also highlighted the extent to which preparedness requires ongoing and sustained commitment from all stakeholders, both nationally and internationally, in ensuring that countries are ready when the next threat presents at their borders.",
