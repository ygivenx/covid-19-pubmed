            "text": "The virus family Caliciviridae contains five established genera (Norovirus, Sapovirus, Lagovirus, Vesivirus, and Nebovirus) and at least six proposed genera (Recovirus, Valovirus, Bavovirus, Nacovirus, Minovirus, and Salovirus) that infect many different animal species including humans. Most of these agents are enteric pathogens whose replication and chief clinical manifestations are gastroenteritis and potentially life-threatening diarrhea. Examples of these viruses include human norovirus (HuNoV), porcine norovirus, bovine norovirus, human sapovirus, porcine sapovirus, and the recently discovered Tulane virus. HuNoV is the major food- and water-borne virus that accounts for more than 95% of nonbacterial acute gastroenteritis worldwide, but this percentage may be underestimated due to the large number of asymptomatic HuNoV infections and lack of proper detection methods [1,2,3,4]. In addition, HuNoV is responsible for over 50% of the outbreaks of foodborne illnesses in the USA [5]. The symptoms often involve projectile vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, and low-grade fever [1,2,6]. HuNoV is transmitted primarily through the fecal\u2013oral route, either by direct person-to-person contact or by fecally contaminated food or water. Although HuNoV infection is usually self-limited disease, it is highly contagious, and only a few particles are thought to be sufficient to cause an infection [1,2,7]. Currently, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) classify HuNoV and other caliciviruses as category B priority biodefense pathogens.",

            "text": "Unfortunately, researches on HuNoVs have been hampered due to the fact that it cannot efficiently be grown in cell culture system and lack a robust small animal model for infectivity and pathogenesis study [1,2,4]. Recently, two separate groups in the US reported the replication of HuNoV in cell culture. Jones et al. showed that HuNoV can be grown in human B cells, and that commensal bacteria (such as Enterobacter cloacae) facilitate such replication [8]. Ettayebi et al. reported that multiple HuNoV strains can replicate in stem cell-derived human enteroids [9]. Although these studies are highly promising, the robustness of these culture systems needs to be further validated. Despite major efforts, there are still no FDA-approved vaccines or antiviral drugs are available for HuNoV. Recent epidemiological studies found that severe clinical outcomes including death are often associated with high-risk populations such as the elderly, children, and immunocompromised individuals [5,10,11,12]. From 1999 to 2007 HuNoV caused, on average, 797 deaths per year in the USA. Mortality of HuNoV associated infection increases during the epidemic seasons and the burden of HuNoV is much greater in the developing world. The CDC estimates that HuNoV causes the death of 200,000 children under the age of five every year in developing countries. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop an efficacious vaccine and therapeutic agent for control and prevent HuNoV. ",

Also, rapid and immediate protection can be achieved after passive immunization, for example, against agents of bioterrorism [14]. Using mammalian serum to produce antibodies for oral administration has been described previously [15]. However, its application is limited by the high cost of large-scale antibody production and time-consuming [16,17]. In addition, passive immunization with polyclonal antibodies has also been shown to have higher levels of protection compared to monoclonal antibodies [18]. Immunoglobulin Y (IgY)\u2014the egg yolk antibodies generated as a passive immunity to embryos and baby chicks [19]\u2014can be a good alternative for large-scale production of polyclonal antibodies at a lower cost. Chicken IgYs are transferred from blood to the egg yolk during embryo development [16]. IgY can be easily produced and purified with high yields from egg yolks of immunized hens. In addition, production of antibodies via laying hens only requires the collection of eggs, and the animal number can be reduced due to the high and long-lasting titers produced in chickens [18,19]. Therefore, the IgY technology is a safe, convenient, and inexpensive strategy to prevent and control infectious diseases, especially for gastrointestinal infections [20,21].",

In addition, these IgYs can block the binding of HuNoV VLPs to its receptors, the histo-blood group antigens (HBGA), suggesting that IgY may potentially be used as passive immunization and therapeutic agent for HuNoV. Although these results are promising, purification of VLPs from insect cells is time-consuming and expensive which may limit the large-scale production of IgY. Previously, our laboratory developed a more efficient, convenient, and economical strategy to produce HuNoV VLPs [23,24]. We constructed a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus expressing VP1 gene of a HuNoV GII.4 strain (rVSV-VP1). The VLP production by rVSV-VP1 was significantly higher than that by insect cells-baculovirus expression system. Vaccination of mice with rVSV-VP1 triggered significantly higher HuNoV-specific humoral, cellular, and mucosal immunities than traditional VLP vaccination [23,24].",

We found that HuNoV VP1 was highly expressed in chicken cells infected by rVSV-VP1 and that hens vaccinated rVSV-VP1 induced a high level of HuNoV-specific IgY in egg yolks. Interestingly, intramuscular vaccination of rVSV-VP1 produced approximately three times more HuNoV-specific IgY than combination of intramuscular and nasal drop vaccination route. Importantly, HuNoV-specific IgY produced by rVSV-VP1 vaccination was capable of blocking the binding of HuNoV VLPs to type A, B, and O HBGA receptors. In addition, egg yolk IgY antibodies remained stable at temperature below 70 \u00b0C and at pH ranging from 4 to 9. These data demonstrated that recombinant rVSV-VP1 is a highly effective antigen for large-scale production of HuNoV-specific IgY for passive immunization and therapeutic agent.",

After vaccination, the safety of rVSV-VP1 in chickens was monitored daily. No abnormal reaction was observed in chickens vaccinated by both routes.

Therefore, we determined whether total IgY derived from rVSV-VP1 vaccinated hens could be used as the primary antibody for the HBGA binding assay. Briefly, 96-well plates were coated with type A, B, or O human saliva, and 200 ng of HuNoV VLPs were added to bind the HBGA receptor. After 1-h incubation, a serial dilution of total IgY was added followed by addition of HRP-conjugated goat anti-chicken IgY. After the addition of substrate reagent, an ELISA reader measured OD450. Purified total IgY from rVSV-VP1 vaccinated groups strongly reacted with HuNoV VLPs in the saliva-based HBGA binding assays (Figure 4A,B). In contrast, control IgY from pre-immunized hens was negative in this assay. Overall, total IgY from intramuscular vaccination group had significantly higher OD values than those in combined vaccination group (p < 0.05, compare the OD value in Figure 4A,B). In addition, it appears that VLPs had a stronger binding activity to type A saliva compared to types B and O saliva (Figure 4A,B).

Recently, a HBGA blocking assay, which measures the ability of antibody blocks the binding of HuNoV VLPs to the attachment factors (HBGAs), has been developed [28,29]. Presumably, blockage of viral receptor binding activity will inhibit viral attachment, entry, and subsequent viral infection. Thus, this assay can serve as a useful surrogate assay for serum\u2013virus neutralization assay. Briefly, 96-well plates were coated with a known saliva type (A, B, or O) at 4 \u00b0C overnight. The VLPs were preincubated with the serially diluted IgY at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h before adding to the saliva-coated wells. Then, a guinea pig anti-HuNoV VLP antiserum was added, followed by the addition of HRP-conjugated goat anti-guinea pig IgG. After the addition of substrate reagent, OD450 was measured by an ELISA reader. Percent of blocking activity was calculated by comparing the OD values measured with or without blocking by the chicken IgYs. As shown in Figure 5, total IgY antibodies isolated from egg yolks of rVSV-VP1 vaccinated groups were capable of blocking the binding of HuNoV VLP to HBGAs (A, B, or O antigen) in a dose-dependent manner with a BT50 (a serum dilution with 50% blocking activity) of approximately 1:400, 1:800, and 1:100, respectively. As controls, IgY purified from egg yolks of chickens before immunization did not have detectable blocking activity. Again, total IgY from intramuscular group had a significantly higher blocking activity compared to the intramuscular and nasal drop group (p < 0.05). Therefore, IgY from rVSV-VP1 vaccinated hens specifically blocked the binding of HuNoV VLPs to the HBGAs.",

However, VSV has a broad tissue tropism and can replicate to a high titer in many mammalian cell lines, insect cell, yeast, worm, and C. elegans [30,31]. In this study, we found that rVSV-VP1 replicated to a high titer in DF-1 cells, a continuous cell line derived from chicken embryo fibroblasts. The virus yields in DF-1 cells were comparable to those produced in BSRT7 cell. In addition, rVSV-VP1 produced similar amounts of VP1 protein in both DF-1 and BSRT7 cells. Prior to our study, replication capability of VSV in avian species in vivo was poorly understood. The only report of VSV infection in chickens came from the study of rVSV-based influenza virus vaccine. It was found that chickens vaccinated with rVSV expressing the HA antigen of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H7N1) triggered a high level of serum neutralizing antibody and provided complete protection against lethal challenge of avian influenza H7N1 [32]. In our study, we found that hens vaccinated with rVSV-VP1 triggered a high level of HuNoV-specific IgY in yolks, further supporting that chickens were susceptible to VSV infection. We also showed that immunization route affected IgY production in hens. We found that intramuscular vaccination triggered a higher HuNoV-specific IgY than combination of intramuscular and nasal drop vaccination although the total IgY levels were similar between two vaccination routes. Our rationale to include nasal drop vaccination is that it may trigger a higher mucosal immunity since egg yolk is developed in reproductive tract of chickens. In fact, our previous mice study showed that oral and intranasal vaccination of rVSV-VP1 trigged a high level of both serum and mucosal antibody [23,24]. ",

There are many potential advantages of using live attenuated rVSV-VP1 for IgY production. First, rVSV-VP1 grows to a high titer in a wide range of cell lines including chicken cells. Second, replication of rVSV-VP1 in chickens resulted in synthesis of large amount of VLPs that in turn triggered a high level of HuNoV antibody. Third, it is an economical and time-saving approach. It does not require purification of VLPs or P particles. Thus, rVSV-VP1 is a promising vaccine antigen for large-scale production of IgY in chickens. ",

Third, HuNoV-specific IgYs, but not the control IgY, were capable of blocking the binding of HuNoV VLPs to type A, B, and O HBGAs in human saliva. Although it is unknown whether HuNoV-specific IgY can directly neutralize the infectious HuNoV, blockage of virus\u2013receptor interaction will likely block the infectivity of HuNoV, which will prevent HuNoV infection and illness. In 2010, Reeck et al. found a direct correlation between the ability of an antibody to block VLP-HBGA binding and protection against HuNoV infection and illness in a HuNoV human challenge study [34]. In addition, Nurminen et al., (2011) showed that children could be protected from a GII.4 HuNoV infection due to the pre-existing HBGA blocking antibodies [35]. Thus, the IgYs is a promising passive immunization approach to prevent and treat HuNoV infection and illness. Future study will determine whether IgY can directly neutralize infectious HuNoV using the recently developed B cell culture system [8] or human enteroids culture system [9]. ",

Antibody-based passive immunization and therapy has been shown to be an effective strategy to prevent infectious diseases in many animals [16]. However, preparation of serum antibody from mammals is expensive and time-consuming. Thus, large-scale application of serum antibody has been limited. IgY egg yolk immunoglobulins derived from hyperimmunized hens represent an economically feasible and practical strategy which has been explored for the passive treatment of enteric diseases. Chicken IgY production is a much easier, faster, and cheaper method for polyclonal antibody production than from any other sources. It is easy to raise chickens and collect eggs without involvement of any stressful procedures (such as bleeding). White leghorn chickens are highly productive in laying eggs, and they can continuously produce eggs containing antigen-specific antibodies in their yolks for a long time period after immunization [16]. Nguyen et al. (2010) demonstrated that chicken usually lays 280 eggs/year and each egg yolk normally contains 150\u2013200 mg of IgY, which has 2 to 10% antigen-specific antibodies [42]. In addition, extraction of antibody from egg yolk is simple and noninvasive without affecting the immunized chickens. Therefore, a chicken is an excellent \u201cfactory\u201d for IgY antibody production.",

Based on the HBGA blocking assay, HuNoV-specific IgY remains stable at temperature below 70 \u00b0C. Thus, it is safe for pasteurization (below 72 \u00b0C) of IgY for human consumption. However, the receptor blocking activity of IgY significantly decreased when temperature reached above 75 \u00b0C, suggesting that IgY may be denatured at this temperature. For oral administration, IgY should ideally be stable in acid or alkaline environment. Our results showed that the receptor blocking activity of IgY decreased at pH below 3 or above 10. Since the stomach pH is ~2\u20133, it may be necessary to encapsulate the IgY in acid resistant capsules so that it can be released in intestines for neutralizing the infectious virus particles. For example, Chang et al. (1999) demonstrated that addition of sugars, glycerol, or glycine to immunoglobulin solutions was effective to protect IgYs. In addition, film coating with gum arabic was proven to be effective in reducing the degree of hydrolysis of IgY [43].",
