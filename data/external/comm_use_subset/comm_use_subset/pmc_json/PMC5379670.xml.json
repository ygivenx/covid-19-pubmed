Briefly (Fig. 1a), the P19 cells expressing Flag-MAGE-G1 were grown in the \u201cheavy\u201d medium containing 13C6 L-lysine, whereas the control cells (transfected with empty vector) were maintained in \u201clight\u201d medium containing 12C6 L-lysine. P19 cells were treated with RA for 6 days to induce neuronal differentiation, and then the proteins were extracted from each group and mixed in a ratio of 1:1 based on the total protein mass. Anti-Flag beads were added to immunoprecipitate the MAGE-G1 interacting complex followed by SDS-PAGE separation (Fig. 1b), in-gel trypsin digestion, and LC\u2013MS/MS analysis. Immunoblotting was conducted to confirm whether Flag-MAGE-G1 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates (Fig. 1c).",

It suggested that MAGE-G1 might play a significant role in the early process of neurogenesis. However, the detailed function of MAGE-G1 in neurogenesis remains unclear. To date, only two proteins, E2F1 and p75NTR, have been found interact with MAGE-G1. Previous studies found that MAGE-G1 could reduce cell proliferation, and such effect was mediated by its interaction with the E2F1 transcriptional activator. Interaction of MAGE-G1 with the p75NTR may be involved in brain development6. In this study, based on the model of RA-induced neuronal differentiation of P19 cells, SILAC-immunoprecipitation quantitative proteomics was used to identify interaction partners of MAGE-G1. After analysis and validation, FSCN1 and VIME were found to be interacted with MAGE-G1 during RA-induced neuronal differentiation. However, two known MAGE-G1 interactors, E2F1 and p75NTR, were not identified in our experiment. We speculated that our IP lysis buffer was too mild to extract membrane protein p75NTR and nucleoprotein E2F1.",

FSCN-1 is abundant early in development, especially in the central nervous system (CNS) and migrating cells, and then downregulated as cells maturation192021. As a highly conserved actin-binding protein, FSCN1 has diverse roles in the developmental and physiological regulation of cellular morphology and function22232425. In nonneuronal cells, FSCN1 plays numerous roles in the formation of protrusions that regulate adhesion and motility, including tissue invasion by tumor cells262728. FSCN1 is also required for normal brain development by regulating neuronal differentiation29. FSCN1 insufficiency or dysregulation might underlie disorders of brain development and plasticity, resulting in intellectual disability30.",

            "text": "VIME is one of the highly conserved proteins of the type III intermediate filament (IF) protein family. During development, VIME expression is predominant in the primitive streak stage, while in adults VIME expression is limited to connective tissue mesenchymal cells, in CNS and in muscle34. VIME has been shown to participate in a number of critical functions, often related to organization of proteins that are involved in adhesion, migration, and cell signaling. Recently, many different studies have linked VIME to signal transduction and it has been suggested that they would act as signaling platforms and scaffolds for signaling molecules. VIME can interact with RhoA-binding kinase \u03b1 (ROK\u03b1) that directly phosphorylate VIME35. The activation of RhoA resulted in a ROK\u03b1-dependent collapse of the VIME network with simultaneous release of ROK\u03b1 bound to VIME filaments and translocation of ROK\u03b1 to the cell periphery35. VIME networks can also interact with kinases that do not directly phosphorylate VIME. VIME is associated with Raf-1 kinase and activation of the kinase induces VIME phosphorylation36. VIME phosphorylation is also controlled by PKC\u03b5 interacted with VIME on the membrane vesicles37. In this study, we found that VIME could be interacted with MAGE-G1 during RA-induced neuronal differentiation of P19 cells, and those findings imply that VIME filaments might work as a binding platform for MAGE-G1 signaling pathway, or its crosstalk with above mentioned VIME-involved signaling pathway during neuronal differentiation.",
