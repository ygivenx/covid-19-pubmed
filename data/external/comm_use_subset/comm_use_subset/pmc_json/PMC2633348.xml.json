There are individuals in this cohort who have remained asymptomatic for 27 years since infection without antiretroviral therapy; some maintaining plasma HIV RNA levels to below detectable levels and a stable CD4 T cell count, thus retaining elite non-progressor status. Early natural history studies on this and other cohorts suggested that TAHIV infection may result in a shorter time to AIDS than sexually-acquired (SA) HIV infection [1,2]. This observed increase in the rate of disease progression in TAHIV may be due to the higher inoculation volume of blood product compared with the much smaller blood or genital fluid exchange involved in SAHIV infection [1], as well as the known immunomodulatory effect of transfusion on immune function [3,4]. Age is also an independent predictor for an increased rate of HIV disease progression [5,6]. The bias toward an aged population requiring transfusion is part of the composite disadvantage of transfusion as a route of HIV infection [1]. In addition to HIV infection, survival may be influenced by the underlying medical cause for transfusion. Yet despite these disadvantages, we previously observed a high frequency of non-progression in this TAHIV cohort after 20 years of infection [7].",

However, after prolonged infection, not all SBBC members maintained non-progressive disease [10-13]. Although HLA type did not explain non-progression in this group [14], we have observed differences in CD8 T cell responses that are associated with HLA-dependent epitope recognition [15], and we have detected increased preservation of helper T cell responses in non-progressors from this cohort [16,17]. In addition to the well described host genetic factors which may prolong non-progression [7], recent studies have suggested an influence from innate immune mechanisms, including polymorphisms that decrease TLR function thereby reducing immune activation upon exposure to infections diseases [18], or the Fc\u03b3RIIA polymorphism (R/R) which is strongly associated with progressive HIV disease as a result of impaired elimination of HIV immune complexes [19].",

Earlier studies have demonstrated an important role for Gag-specific CTL in delaying disease progression [20,21]. Non-progressors that control viraemia in the absence of antiviral therapy also have strong CD4 T cell proliferative responses to the Gag protein p24 [22]. Importantly, for Gag CTL to be efficient in killing HIV-infected cells and therefore protective in controlling viraemia, these must also be accompanied by p24-specific T cell proliferative responses [23-25]. Appropriate T cell help is also required to achieve maturation and display of effector phenotypes on CTL associated with effective virological control [26].",

A rebound in these Gag-specific T cell responses coincided with the first detectable viraemia at 19 years. These T cell responses may have helped contain viraemia to low levels over the following two years, but the sharp increase in viral RNA at 22.7 years (Figure 1) coincided with a decline in Gag-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses, whereas Pol-specific CTL increased in response to rising viraemia.

Pools of overlapping 15-mer Gag peptides were used to test sequential PBMC spanning the study period by ELISPOT. The composition of each peptide pool, and examples of responses to these are shown in Figures 4 and 5, indicating the relevant HLA-specific epitopes contained in peptides at the intersection of positive pools. Figure 4 demonstrates a broad strong response by C53's PBMC to multiple immunodominant epitopes, contrasted in Figure 5 by the restricted response from C122 to only two immunodominant epitopes. The sequential analysis revealed relatively high stability in the repertoire of Gag responses over the past 10 years in most subjects (Additional file 2). Relevant epitopes at intersecting positive peptide pools were then confirmed using individual peptides (Figure 6). This data demonstrates that retention of broadly reactive Gag CTL was associated with ongoing non-progression (C49, C64, and C53), while restriction toward a narrow CTL specificity was observed in patients that eventually lost control of viraemia (C122 and possibly C13). The SBBC non-progressors C49 and C64 had responses to several Gag epitopes, and although Gag responses were moderate to weak in C64, this needs to be viewed in the context of Pol CTL dominance in the SBBC. A strong but restricted Gag response was also seen in C18, but these Gag responses were likely to be secondary in controlling viraemia, as suggested by the kinetics of Pol CTL in response to a spike in viraemia (Figure 3). Pol CTL recognition was confirmed by subsequent analysis of responses to peptide pools derived from the full set of Pol overlapping 15-mer peptides. Moderate to strong responses to multiple pools containing epitopes in the reverse transcriptase protein were detected in SBBC members C49, C64, C18, C54, but weakly in C98 (data not shown). C18 also responded strongly to integrase peptides.",

With the exception of one sample in 1996, a well characterised escape mutant [34] was detected from the earliest time point in C117. This escape mutant was not detected in C13 or C122, and hence was not the cause for the loss of control of viraemia in C122, nor was it detected in the latest time point from C13 when viraemia first increased above 1000 copies/ml. This suggests that immune escape at this B27 Gag epitope was not a major cause of disease progression in very long term infected individuals. The sole common factor was a decline in p24-specific proliferative responses.",

Recent analyses of the SBBC may support this suggestion [13,17]. However, death from other causes has prevented the establishment of definitive proof of disease progression in some individuals. Two SBBC subjects that did not consent to prospective analysis died from unrelated causes in 1987 and 1994, and the sole SBBC recipient on therapy (C98) has since died from non-HIV causes. Two other elderly subjects also died from non-HIV causes (C18 and C54), but control of viraemia at low levels along with normal CD4 T cell counts suggested there was no evidence for loss LTNP status before death. This leaves the three elite non-progressors from the SBBC described in this study, and one is also advanced in age. One of the elderly Cohort 2 LTNP (with wild-type HIV infection) also died recently from non-HIV causes aged 84 (C122). We may have an opportunity to determine the factors involved in disease progression in the other two Cohort 2 non-progressors (C13 and C53). Both had very low but detectable viraemia, but a recent inversion of CD4 : CD8 T cell ratio in C13 is evident of a change in HIV-induced immune activation. Based on the decline in the proliferative response to p24 preceding this recent increase in viraemia, it is likely that these together signify a transitionary stage toward disease progression in C13.",

The p24 proliferative response may also be specifically protective, as suggested by a study showing that responses to some Pol antigens were associated with increased viraemia, whereas a protective association was always found in responses to Gag antigens [35]. HIV-specific proliferative responses may also promote CTL proliferation. This was supported by the response to a spike in viraemia in patient C18, where the HIV-specific CD4 and CD8 memory T cell pool increased and were maintained throughout this period (both proliferation and CTL precursor assays measure proliferating antigen-specific memory T cells), whereas effector CTL (ELISPOT-positive cells) peaked then declined as viraemia declined. These data suggest that effective helper T cell function involves proliferation followed by maturation into both effector and costimulatory cells that provide \"help\" for other lymphocyte functions. Thus, antigen-specific CD8 T cell proliferation may be directly associated with CD4 proliferation to epitopes on the corresponding antigen. It is also possible that loss of protective CD4 and CD8 HIV-specific proliferation may be mediated by a common immunological defect.",

This observation is unexpected, considering the extensively published role for Gag CTL in controlling viraemia [20,21,23]. Also peculiar to SBBC members, the strongest CTL responses were detected in those with detectable viraemia, and were weaker in subjects with undetectable viraemia [15]. In the non-attenuated HIV-infected non-progressors, strong immunodominant CTL combined with detectable proliferative responses to p24 appears to have contributed to viraemia remaining <100 copies/ml after 23 years HIV-1 infection in patient C53. The individual with the strongest CTL response was C122, but CTL increased as viraemia increased in this patient, while proliferative responses to Gag p24 declined. Given the predominant CTL response in this subject was directed against an immunodominant HLA B27 restricted p24 epitope, and that there were no immune escape sequences detected at this epitope, it is likely that the decline in the p24-specific proliferative response was the key event that contributed to the failure of CTL to control viraemia, as it is understood that CTL have much reduced functional efficiency in containing viraemia in the absence of helper T cell responses [24]. Another study of HLA B57 positive individuals found no association between disease progression and the strength of CTL responses or the emergence of viral escape mutants at these epitopes, but it was found that viral replicative fitness influenced disease course [36]. The contribution of p24-specific proliferative responses was not investigated in that study.",

However, NAb titres in SBBC members were comparatively weaker, and in parallel with CTL responses, were highest in those with detectable viraemia. The presence of strong Nabs did not prevent some SBBC members from developing signs of disease progression [38]. Hence, we suggest that while broad Nabs might be generated due to a crippled infection they do not prevent disease progression, particularly in the absence of antiviral helper T cell responses.",

Could a change in viral pathogenicity overcome this delicate balance between host and virus, or could progressive weakening of the CD4 T cell response by slow virus turnover gradually allow the virus to escape the combined effector mechanisms of the HIV-specific cell-mediated and humoral immune responses? Escape mutants at the B27 epitope KRWIILGLNK have been observed under conditions of high viral load and evolutionary drift [34], which was likely in C117, but not for both C13 and C122, who had prolonged periods of immune control in the presence of p24 proliferative responses, and very low viraemia up to or beyond the second decade of HIV infection. Disease progression in one SBBC member (C98) and the SBBC infecting donor was associated with the emergence of divergent strains which preceded viral load increases and subsequent changes in immune responses [39,40]. Also, these individuals lacked protective p24 proliferative responses and had detectable viraemia before viral divergence occurred, providing further evidence that effective immune control over viral replication to levels below a putative threshold, may prevent the emergence of escape mutants or fitter variants. Therefore, the common factor in all these observations is the decline or lack of p24 proliferative responses, suggesting that a lack of helper T cell responses may result in a reduced capacity to contain viral replication by other immune effector responses including CTL, independent of the presence of viral escape mutants.",

Detectable p24-specific T cell proliferation defines the immunocompetent recall response to viral antigen, and when spikes of viral replication were detected in these individuals, these cells likely provided T cell help for maintaining functional antiviral effector responses by other CD4 and CD8 T cells, including non-cytolytic antiviral mechanisms [41], and may also provide T cell help for efficient generation of NAb by HIV-specific B cells.
