Catalytic mechanism of 3CLpro resembles that of a typical cysteine protease. Cleavage of the peptide bond between P1 and P1' positions is catalyzed by the Cys145 and His41 dyad [12].

The cleavage of these peptide substrates by 3CLpro was detected by mass spectrometry. They showed that cleavage was detected only when Leu and Phe were present at P2 position. Peptide substrates with acidic residues at P1' position and with Ile/Leu at P2' position were not cleavable. All substitutions at P4 and P3' positions resulted in cleavable substrates. Their detection method can only determine qualitatively whether the peptide substrate is cleavable, but not the relative cleavage rate of different substitutions. Goetz et al. profiled the specificity at P4 to P1 positions using a fully degenerate library of tetrapeptides linked with a fluorogenic group at the C-terminus [19]. Contradictory to the common belief that P1 position only takes Gln, they showed that 3CLpro can cleave the peptide substrates containing His at P1 position equally well. However, in their hands, peptide substrates with Phe at P2 position have no observable cleavage, which is inconsistent with the observation that Phe is naturally occurring at this position of the autocleavage sequence of polyproteins. It is, therefore, unknown whether the tetrapeptide is a good model for substrate specificity for 3CLpro.",

N-terminal sequencing confirmed that 3CLpro cleaved the protein substrate specifically at the peptide bond between P1 and P1' positions. Separation of the two fluorescent proteins caused the reduction in FRET efficiency, and the reaction rate was followed by time-dependent decrease of emitted fluorescence at 530 nm (Figure 1C). The observed rate constants, kobs, were measured at 1 to 4 \u00b5M of 3CLpro.

One of the possibilities is that the positive charges stabilize the transition state of catalysis. It is expected that the carboxylate group at P1 residue will be converted to an oxyanion during the formation of the transition state. Presence of positive charges near the active site may electrostatically stabilize the oxyanion and thus promote catalysis. Another possibility is a direct electrostatic interaction between positively charged residues of substrate and negatively charged residues of 3CLpro. There is a Glu166 located at substrate binding cleft that can interact with P3 residue. This may explain why P3 position has the strongest preference for positively charged residues.",

Our data suggest that for those residues that are small enough to fit into the binding pocket, the relative activity is directly proportional to the hydrophobicity of the substituting residues. No observable cleavage was detected for charged residues (Arg, Asp, Glu and Lys), probably due to the high desolvation penalty for burial of charges inside the hydrophobic pocket.",

We modeled how 3CLpro recognizes P1-His using SWISS-PDBViewer [24]. In the modeled structure, although P1-His can fit into substrate binding pocket without steric hindrance, it is no longer in an optimal position to form hydrogen bonds with His163 and Phe140 (Figure 4). Instead, the N\u03b52 atom of P1-His position can form a hydrogen bond with the amide group of Asn142.

Consistent with our results, they showed that 3CLpro can cleave both His and Gln at P1 position. It is noteworthy that the reported protease activity for P1-His substrates was slightly higher than that for the P1-Gln substrates. In contrast, our data suggested that P1-His is cleavable but with a lower relative activity of 0.26\u00b10.02. Goetz et al. argued that the binding mode of His and Gln to the S1 pocket is similar because the N\u03b52 and N\u03b51 atoms of P1-His can take the approximate positions of N\u03b52 and O\u03b51 atoms of P1-Gln. However, a close inspection of their models revealed that such binding mode of P1-His requires structural changes of the backbone atoms of the P1 residue. The structural changes may be accommodated in their tetrapeptide substrates, which lack residues beyond P1' position that may restrict the backbone conformation of the substrate. In contrast, we argue that for the protein substrate used in our study, it is likely that the backbone conformation of the substrate will be held by extensive interaction of residues from P5 to P3' positions. As discussed above, our model suggests that P1-His should form weaker interaction with the 3CLpro (Figure 4), justifying the observation that P1-Gln is preferred over P1-His in the native cleavage sequences in the SARS-CoV polyproteins.",

Considering that the protease activity measured in the study of Goetz et al. represented the ensemble average of a mixture of 203 degenerate peptides, we speculate that their results could be biased by many non-cleavable combinations of sequences within their libraries.",

The effect of residue substitution at P5 to P3' positions were investigated (Table 2). The comprehensive data obtained allowed us to quantitatively correlate the substrate specificity in terms of side chain volume, hydrophobicity and secondary structure propensities. Not only our results are consistent with some of the previous observations, novel insights into the substrate specificity were obtained in this study. First, positively charged residues are consistently preferred over negatively charged ones at solvent-exposed positions such as P5, P3, P3'. Second, the 3CLpro activity is directly proportional to hydrophobicity for small residues at P4, and to \u03b2-sheet propensities at P5 and P3 positions. Third, residues larger than Cys are not favored at P1' position. Fourth, the most favorite residue at P1 position is Gln, but P1-His and P1-Met are also cleavable. Our results suggest the existence of a strong structure-activity relationship between 3CLpro and its substrates. The substrate specificity profiled in this study can be used as a benchmark for better computational simulation for 3CLpro-substrate/inhibitor interaction, and may provide a guideline for a rational based design of potent inhibitors.",
