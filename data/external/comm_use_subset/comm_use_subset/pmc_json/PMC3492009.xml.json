The responsible agent is an enveloped, ca. 15 kb long positive-stranded RNA virus (PRRSV) that belongs to the Arteriviridae family [5] and that can cause late-term abortions in sows and respiratory symptoms and mortality in young or growing pigs. Once this virus has entered a herd it tends to remain present and active indefinitely causing severe economic losses and marketing problems due to high direct medication costs and considerable animal health costs needed to control secondary pathogens [6,7].",

However clinical manifestations vary with physiological status and age [9], as the virus uses several immune evasion ways to complicate the ability of the host to respond to the infection process [4,10,11]. Weaning piglets, in particular, are likely to be exposed to the infection. Although PRRSV viraemia is often asymptomatic in these piglets, their productive performance is significantly decreased. Indeed, despite being sero-negative, persistently infected piglets still harbor PRRSV and have been shown to be a source of virus for susceptible animals [12].",

It is thus distinct from common non-selective techniques, such as two-dimensional polyacrilamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation (MALDI) MS. SELDI-TOF MS has been widely used for diagnostic biomarker discovery and validation across studies in blood serum/plasma, particularly in cancer research (reviewed by [13]), but also to characterize and identify biomarkers associated with viral and other infectious diseases [14-19]. The protein signatures identified by SELDI-TOF MS analysis have thus many potential applications in animal health, including early diagnosis of diseases, prediction of disease states, as well as monitoring of disease progression, recovery, and response to vaccination. Few reports have been published for livestock applications [19-22].",

We optimized the experimental conditions previously described [20] and validated 47 statistically significant discriminatory biomarkers. Among these, a combination of 14 biomarkers identified in F1 on CM10 at low focus mass permitted to correctly assign the piglets to the PPRSV-positive or PRRSV-negative groups with sensitivity and specificity of 77% and 73%, respectively.",

This was reached even though the tested piglets had large variability and heterogeneity, as they were collected from several farms located in different regions, and underwent high environmental pressures, typical of the field conditions. This is mainly due to the careful choice of the serum samples, where we tried to minimize the environmental differences by using same experimental parameters (e.g. sample collection procedures, storage, handling) and by including a similar number of pigs from the same breed (Large White) and with very similar sex ratios and ages (at weaning).",

However, in that work, none of the potential biomarkers identified in the discovery phase could be validated in the subsequent validation phase, because of high samples heterogeneity and high content of serum (e.g. albumin) and contaminant proteins (e.g. hemoglobin), having a negative effects on the detection of significant biomarkers, particularly those corresponding to the medium-low abundant proteins. It has been reported that low abundant proteins constitute about 1% of the entire human serum proteome, with the remaining 99% being comprised of only 22 proteins [35]. As it was therefore necessary to reduce the level of abundant proteins, in this follow up study, particular relevance was given to the content of the contaminant protein hemoglobin. Only non-hemolytic samples with similar, low contents of hemoglobin were included in the study. Additionally, to further increase the likelihood to identify statistically significant discriminatory biomarkers, we introduced a fractioning step based on anion-exchange chromatography. In a similar study performed with MALDI-TOF [28], where serum samples were analyzed in the first weeks (2\u201316) of PRRSV infection (also verified by PCR), a significantly lower number of peaks were identified compared to the present work. While protein peaks with M/Z values of 4.165, 4.460, 5.560, 8.330, 8.825, 12.250/12.550, and 14.010 kDa were found in 94 serum samples from 59 pigs, only one peak (9.244 kDa), corresponding to the alpha 1 S (a1S)-subunit of porcine Haptoglobin (Hp), was differentially up-regulated in PRRSV infected pigs. Interestingly, all these peaks were very similar (MW difference \u22640.3 kDa) with discriminatory peaks identified here (details in Table 3). Furthermore, two peaks identified in this study (23.162 and 14.843 kDa) were similar to peaks identified elsewhere (corresponding to Heat shock 27 kDa protein 1 [29-31] and Galectin 1 [26,31], respectively). In accordance with [31], the identified peak corresponding to Heat shock 27 kDa protein 1 was up-regulated, while the peak corresponding to Galectin 1 was down-regulated. Thus, these proteins seem to be very interesting and suitable candidates for future investigations.",

This is particularly interesting as the patho-physiological state of the body\u2019s tissue is predominantly reflected in the LMW and low abundance region of the serum proteome, and specific protein fragments of the serum peptidome have been shown to contain a rich source of disease-specific diagnostic information and they have been correlated with disease stages in several studies (reviewed by [37]).",

In fact, several peaks showed high similarities (MW differences \u22640.3 kDa) with previous works, in particular regarding viral proteins (Table 3). The assignment of the discriminatory peak to a specific protein will require additional work, because the SELDI-TOF technology can only detect masses/peaks of proteins that are differentially expressed between samples but can not directly identify the proteins. This represents one of the major drawbacks of this technology compared to other methods. However, an advantage of the SELDI-TOF MS in this regard is that the results of this technique might lead to the identification of new proteins that were previously not correlated to the disease, and this might hopefully lead to the identification of new biomarkers representing the field situation. The interpretation of these results and the continuation of this project will benefit from the very imminent termination and publication of the sequence of the swine genome [38], which will definitely contribute to a more precise annotation and a better identification of genes and proteins and thus will greatly facilitate genome wide mapping association studies.",

These results provide a set of proteomic biomarkers and related, optimized experimental conditions for high-throughput profiling of pig populations by SELDI-TOF MS for whole genome association studies, where identification of proteins underlying the phenotype can be made a posteriori. SELDI-TOF MS might therefore represent a complementary test or a possible alternative to classical (PCR) and more recent diagnostic methods (e.g. antibody detection in saliva) for profiling large flocks of pigs at reasonable costs, using blood samples that are routinely collected for general veterinary inspections. As well, these SELDI-TOF MS based tests could complement and provide a broader reference for emerging diagnostic methods and have potential applications for the detection of relevant proteins having highly heritable traits (e.g. acute phase proteins).",
