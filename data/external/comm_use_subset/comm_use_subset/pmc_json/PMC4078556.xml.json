Therefore, to reduce the social risk of disease, the government is devoted to many epidemic prevention activities, usually designed to increase the public\u2019s rate of prevention behaviors. In these activities, the Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP) model is the most commonly adopted. In general, the government spreads accurate information to increase the public\u2019s willingness to adopt prevention behaviors. In some cases, these activities are effective, while in others, they are not, especially in unaffected areas, and this situation can cause a latent risk of disease outbreak. Therefore, we used rabies vaccination in Taiwan to exemplify and clarify this problem.",

Rabies is a type of acute viral encephalitis, and because of its fast dissemination through the nervous system, few antibodies can affect immunoreactions. This leads to a death rate of almost 100%. If humans go untreated, they generally die of respiratory failure within 2\u20136 days [1]. Moreover, because of the long incubation period of rabies, a variety of hosts, and many paths of infection, proactive measures are necessary to prevent its occurrence and proliferation. Most reported cases of rabies occur in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. According to World Health Organization (WHO) estimates [2], rabies causes approximately 55,000 deaths annually, with Asia reporting 31,000 and Africa, 24,000.",

Except for Japan, all the countries around Taiwan are epidemic areas, particularly China. In recent years, the number of rabies cases reported in China has rapidly increased, representing a severe threat than that of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). With cases increasing from 163 in 1996, to 3,215 in 2006, China reported more than 1,300 rabies deaths in 2012, a death rate among the highest of all infectious diseases [3]. With the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) deal, more activities between China and Taiwan may lead to a greater likelihood of a rabies outbreak in Taiwan. An imported case from China, in July 2012, exposed this potential risk. If a rabies epidemic occurs in Taiwan, public health, social order, agriculture, and the tourism industry might suffer severely. For example, after the March 2003 SARS outbreak, the number of tourists visiting Taiwan decreased by 600,000 that year, leading to a loss equal to 13 billion US dollars in foreign exchange. Since a rabies epidemic could cause much more severe results than the SARS outbreak, implementing effective epidemic prevention policies is crucial.",

In other words, preventing canine rabies infection is important to the health of Taiwanese nationals as well as tourists. A 2005 report by WHO revealed certain conditions causing high risk of rabies infection: (1) a large number of infected canines; (2) ineffective canine management; (3) a canine vaccination rate below 80%, including stray dogs; and (4) people\u2019s ignorance because of insufficient general knowledge and insufficient education budgets. Conversely, the effective investigation of epidemic situations, a high vaccination rate (over 80%), and effective canine management are key factors in successfully controlling rabies infections. According to the report, since 1973, WHO has widely promoted two rabies prevention measures: broad vaccination programs and strict control of stray dogs.",

            "text": "Among KAP-model promotions, improving knowledge and instilling positive attitudes toward prevention should be the main elements of a Taiwanese rabies-prevention campaign. However, Taiwan\u2019s current vaccination rate is only between 30% and 40% [4,5], far below WHO\u2019s 80% recommendation [2]. To close this gap, we focused on owners\u2019 intentions to vaccinate dogs and attempted to find the determinants for vaccinating against rabies in Taiwan. We had three main purposes: first, we argued that the KAP model\u2019s attitude concept should be extended to behavioral intention and that the theory of planned behavior (TPB) would be a suitable structural model for behavioral intention of vaccination against rabies because of its wide application in research on forecasting and building rational behavior. TPB has been used to predict, for instance, people\u2019s intention to vaccinate against influenza as well as many other health behaviors [6]. We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to verify that TPB can explain people\u2019s intention to vaccinate dogs against rabies [7]. Second, we argued that attitude is not the only key factor, or even the best factor, for understanding dog owners\u2019 behavioral intention. According to the low vaccination rate in Taiwan, we considered only improving knowledge and instilling a positive attitude are not enough to control the latent risk of rabies in Taiwan. By applying TPB to the intention of rabies vaccination, we described relationships among the variables to determine the best predictive index. Finally, we argued that the knowledge concept of the KAP model should be distinguished into two types, objective knowledge (OK) and subjective knowledge (SK). OK indicates the level of accurate information in one\u2019s cognition about the target; SK indicates the level of one\u2019s perceptions of what or how much one knows about the target [8,9]. Azjen et al. [10] argued that knowledge, especially objective knowledge, would affect attitude and enhance self-efficacy (perceived behavioral control, PBC), but they did not test the correlation between subjective knowledge and TPB. Besides, we thought that especially SK, rather than OK, would be more likely to prompt people to vaccinate their dogs. In conclusion, we proposed to the government rabies prevention policies and suggestions for raising the vaccination rate through TPB, thus not only helping prevent a rabies outbreak in Taiwan but also preventing latent risk for similar situations.",

Furthermore, vaccinating dogs is not only a personal act but also a social behavior involving moral perception.

The first is that intentions best predict behaviors, and the second is that human behavior is quite rational and employs the limited information available to the individual [21,22]. In this theory, two independent factors determine one\u2019s intention: attitudes and subjective norms. Attitudes consist of general evaluations of behavioral performance and beliefs about the consequences of performing the behavior, weighted by an individual\u2019s evaluation of each consequence. Subjective norms reflect general perceptions of social pressure to perform the target behavior and are affected by the expectations of important referents, weighted by an individual\u2019s motivation to comply with each referent. Researchers have conducted many empirical studies on this topic over the past 30 years and provided evidence in support of TRA to explain health and social behavior [23,24,25,26,27,28].",

Ajzen also proposed that perceived behavioral control affects behavior not only indirectly through intention but also directly [17,29]. In fact, many theoretical and empirical studies provide evidence supporting TPB. In 1985, Ajzen presented \u201cFrom intentions to actions: A theory of planned behavior\u201d to open theoretical discussions about TPB. He theorized that the relationship between behavioral intention and behavior is stronger when perceived behavioral control is high. To provide a powerful foundation for TPB, he also presented arguments about social psychology [34], organizational behavior [17], self-efficacy [36], laws of human behavior [37], and the relationship between consumer attitudes and behavior [38]. In addition to this psychological research, Armitage and Conner argued that TPB can be applied to health behavior and also disseminated TPB to such fields as moral behavior, technological behavior, and exercise behavior [39]. These researchers found that TPB explained an average of 39% of the variance in intention and 27% of the variance in behavior.",

Nevertheless, the current study is one of only a few attempts to use TPB as a conceptual framework for vaccination, and more specifically, canine vaccination against rabies. This behavior involves morals, social impressions, and health concepts. Researchers have repeatedly used TPB to interpret moral behavior [40], including behaviors of health promotion [41], environmental friendliness [42], and tax compliance [43]. In the social behavior domain, researchers used TPB to examine alcohol abuse [44], volunteer behavior, substance use [45], blood donations [18], and others. In the health domain, TPB has explained various behaviors, for example, smoking [46,47,48], giving up smoking [49], and drinking [48,50]. Researchers have also used TPB to predict a variety of attendance decisions for many types of health behaviors, including the decision to attend health checks and health clinics [51,52], breast cancer screenings [53], and workplace health and safety courses [54]. Therefore, TPB could be the most powerful theory for predicting a rise in the rate of vaccination against rabies.",

Intentions are assumed to measure motivational factors that influence a behavior; they are indications of how hard people are willing to try and how much effort they are planning to exert to perform the behavior [17,29]. Furthermore, intention is jointly determined by attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control in the TPB model. First, attitudes refer to the degree to which an individual favorably or unfavorably evaluates the behavior in question; second, subjective norms refer to social pressure to perform or not to perform the behavior; and, third, perceived behavioral control refers to whether the individual anticipates the action\u2019s performance as relatively easy or difficult. Presumably, this third measure reflects past experiences and anticipated hindrances. Generally speaking, a person with a more favorable attitude, more positive subjective norms, and higher perceived behavioral control has a stronger intention to perform the target behavior [17,29].",

In taking a dog to receive the rabies vaccine, we also considered perceived behavioral control, not attitude, would be the best predictive index:\nH1: Attitude (A) toward the vaccination of rabies positively affects behavioral intention (BI).H2: Subjective norms (SN) about the vaccination of rabies positively affect BI.H3: Perceived behavioral control (PBC) over vaccination positively affects BI.H3b: the PBC effect is greater than the attitude effect.\n",

            "text": "Perceived behavioral control, including the concept of self-efficacy, is the distinguishing feature of TPB. When people do not have considerable volitional control or are not able to perform well, perceived behavioral control becomes a good predictor for explaining behavioral intention [17,29]. Ajzen argued that perceived behavioral control represents one\u2019s belief about how easy or difficult it is to perform a behavior and that the construct of perceived behavioral control is belief-based [34,35,36]. An individual with knowledge about specific behavior reduces feelings about impediments and increases perceived behavioral control [17,29]. In other words, when people have enough knowledge about rabies and about vaccinating their dogs, they add self-efficacy and then feel good about performing the behavior. Specifically, both OK and SK can affect the ability to perform a specific behavior but with different mechanisms [9]. OK provides information and skill, reducing the impediment of bringing dogs to be vaccinated; SK enhances dog owners\u2019 self-efficacy so that they feel they can perform the behavior well. Therefore, we argued that people with higher levels of OK and SK will have higher perceived behavioral control. Furthermore, Azjen et al. [10] argued that knowledge would positively affect attitude and perceived behavioral control. However, they did not test the correlation between SK and TPB. Because SK combines knowledge and self-confidence, it is more important in problem-solving [61,62]. Hence, we also argued that SK could affect dog owners\u2019 perceived behavioral control more than OK. Figure 1 displays the proposed hypotheses for this study:\nH5: Objective knowledge (OK) about rabies positively affects perceived behavioral control (PBC) about rabies prevention.H6a: Subjective knowledge (SK) about rabies positively affects PBC about rabies prevention.H6b: the SK effect is greater than the OK effect.\n",

For the OK\u2013PBC path (H5), the standardized coefficient was 0.02 with a t-value of 0.50 (p > 0.05); for the SK\u2013PBC path (H6), the standardized coefficient was 0.11 with a t-value of 2.29 (p < 0.05). In other words, people who have more subjective knowledge enhance their perceived behavioral control to perform rabies prevention. Therefore, for vaccinating a dog, objective knowledge enhanced an individual\u2019s attitude and subjective knowledge enhanced an individual\u2019s perceived behavioral control individually.",

However, many latent risks still surround this area, especially those coming from China. With the ECFA deal, more activities between Taiwan and China could lead to a higher chance of a rabies outbreak in Taiwan. Although the administration has tried to improve knowledge and instill positive attitudes, the vaccination rate in Taiwan is still between 30% and 40%, far below the 80% rate recommended by the WHO. Hence, it is necessary to better understand and predict owners\u2019 behavior about vaccinating their dogs.",

Through these results, we verified that TPB is a suitable structural model for the behavioral intention of vaccination against rabies and successfully extended TPB to explain the behavioral intention of dog owners. In addition, perceived behavioral control, not attitude, is the most obvious index for predicting the target behavioral intention. In other words, the results confirm our argument that attitude, although important, is not the best index for understanding dog owners\u2019 behavioral intention.

At the same time, people who had more subjective knowledge tended to have a better perceived behavioral control toward vaccination. In other words, subjective knowledge could change people\u2019s perceptions and considerations about preventing rabies and enhance their self-efficacy so that they feel they perform the behavior well. Furthermore, results confirmed our argument that subjective knowledge showed greater influence than objective knowledge on perceived behavioral control: If we want to improve the vaccination rate by raising the dog owners\u2019 perceived behavioral control, enhancing their subjective knowledge is more effective than providing greater objective knowledge.",

First, we successfully extended TPB to explain behavioral intention not planned only concerning the individual. This study is the first one to use TPB as a conceptual framework for canine vaccination against rabies. Previous authors successfully applied TPB in studies regarding the intention of people to obtain vaccinations for themselves. This study proves that TPB provides adaptability, in that people decide to perform some behavior for their dogs. Besides, for the KAP model, we also found the evidence to support it can describe the behavior against rabies. However, we found other important factors should be considered at the same time. Therefore, we should extend the KAP model to the Knowledge, Intention, Practices (KIP) model and take care, at least, of perceived behavioral control, attitude, and subjective norms.",

We added the concept of subjective knowledge in our model and found the SK\u2013PBC\u2013BI path should be the most effective method for raising the vaccination rate against rabies. In other words, SK\u2013PBC\u2013BI-Practices path would be better than the traditional KAP model. Self-efficacy plays the key factor in such preventive behavior. People with greater self-efficacy feel more subjective knowledge and perceived behavioral control, and then they perform better.",

According to our findings, perceived behavioral control was the primary factor influencing behavioral intention. In other words, an effective epidemic prevention policy must be aimed at this factor. To influence perceived behavioral control, the government should provide manageable conditions and a comfortable situation, for instance, a vaccination subsidy, a more convenient location for vaccination, and so on. Moreover, social norms and attitude should also be addressed. Owners who consider vaccination necessary within a social atmosphere and believe that vaccination against rabies is beneficial will have stronger intentions toward this behavior. At the same time, subjective knowledge plays an important role on positively affecting perceived behavioral control.
