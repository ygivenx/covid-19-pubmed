            "text": "Interleukin (IL)-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine secreted by a variety of cell types. The main functions of IL-10 include down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, reduction of antigen (Ag) presentation and reduced T cell activation [8\u201314]. Ligation of the interleukin-10 receptor (IL-10R) leads to phosphorylation and translocation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) molecules, promoting the transcription of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) leading to profound immune inhibitory effects [15, 16]. Thus, IL-10 counteracts hyperactive immune responses and critically controls immune homeostasis [17, 18]. In autoimmune CNS disorders, such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), IL-10 exerts protective effects by reducing T cell-mediated tissue damage [19]. The critical role of IL-10 in immune-mediated disorders is also demonstrated in human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a chronic, relapsing, idiopathic inflammation of the intestinal tract. Here, IL-10 signaling defects cause a particularly early onset of IBD and loss-of-function mutations affecting IL-10R contribute to the development of very early-onset-IBD, a serious enteric disease in children [20\u201325]. Moreover, genetic deficiency of either IL-10 or IL-10R in transgenic mice leads to a breakdown in immune tolerance and immune mediated colitis, representing a well-established murine model for IBD [26\u201328].",

            "text": "IL-10 also influences the disease outcome in several persistent viral infections [29\u201333]. For instance, the cytokine contributes to T cell exhaustion and persistence of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)-infection in C57BL/6 mice, which can be circumvented by treatment with IL-10R blocking antibody (Ab) [29, 32]. Similarly, genetic and Ab-mediated blockade of IL-10 signaling decreases the mortality rate and brain virus load in murine West Nile Virus (WNV)-infection [31]. By contrast, IL-10 knockout mice infected with a neurotropic strain of mouse hepatitis virus exhibited overwhelming morbidity and increased mortality without affecting virus clearance [33]. In addition, IL-10 produced by CD8+ regulatory T cells (Treg) alleviates acute encephalitis in mouse hepatitis virus-infected mice, suggestive of IL-10-dependent mechanisms to reduce CNS immunopathology [34]. Thus, in contrast to primary beneficial effects of IL-10 in autoimmune disorders, an ambivalent function of IL-10 has to be considered in infectious CNS diseases, contributing to insufficient protective (e.g. antiviral) immunity on the one hand, but limiting immunopathology on the other [35]. Referring to this, in Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis (TME) an enhanced expression of IL-10 has been measured in the brain of SJL mice. Nevertheless, the functional relevance of inhibitory cytokines and effects of pharmacological modulation of the IL-10 pathway remains largely undetermined in this MS model [36].",

In order to determine disease-phase specific effects of CNS infection upon systemic immunopathology, IL10R deficiency was induced by administration of cytokine receptor blocking antibodies during the acute and chronic demyelinating TME phase, respectively. In addition, the potential impact of systemic IL-10R deficiency upon neuropathology in an infectious MS model was investigated. Results illustrate the ability of Ab-mediated IL-10R neutralization to cause an immune enhancement and progressive colitis in SJL mice, which are aggravated by concurrent TMEV-infection in a disease phase-dependent manner.",

Together with an upregulated Foxp3 mRNA expression (Table B in S1 File), relative numbers of Foxp3+ Treg were elevated (Fig 8) in animals receiving IL-10R Ab and TMEV (group \u201cIL-10R\u2193early/TMEV\u201d) compared to control animals (group \u201cIL-10R\u2193early/mock\u201d), representing a potential compensatory mechanism to inhibit overwhelming peripheral inflammatory responses and tissue damage, respectively. Spleen weights were significantly increased in IL-10R blocked mice following TMEV-infection at 22 dpi (Table B in S1 File). To further characterize the functional state of T cells, expression of activation markers CD69 and CD44 was investigated. CD69 and CD44 expression on both CD4+ T cells and CD8+ CTL were significantly enhanced in TMEV-infected animals (group \u201cIL-10R\u2193early/TMEV\u201d) compared to non-infected animals following cytokine receptor blockade (group \u201cIL-10R\u2193early/mock\u201d; Fig 8, Table B in S1 File).",

Treatment successfully induced severe lymphohistiocytic to neutrophilic colitis with loss of goblet cells, crypt hyperplasia and crypt necrosis starting at day 7 (Fig 10). Histological changes in the intestine of these animals share common features with IBD lesions in IL-10 knockout mouse models [51]. Significant differences were present at different time points, showing a progressive disease course (Fig 10). IHC revealed that IL-10R blockade causes an early significant increase of CD3+ T cells, Foxp3+ Treg and Iba-1+ macrophages in the lamina propria of the colon at 7, 14, and 21 day (Fig 11). For CD45R+ B cells, a delayed significant infiltration of the colonic mucosa was found at day 21 after the first Ab treatment (Fig 11). Interestingly, intestinal lesions were not only restricted to the colon, since significant differences were observed between treated animals (group \u201cIL-10R\u2193\u201d) and controls (group \u201cisotype\u201d) also in the caecum at 21 dpi (Table H in S1 File). No histological changes of the small intestine were found at any time point. In addition, no inflammatory lesions were found in other tissues (see materials and methods), including the CNS. As expected, animals that received isotype control (group \u201cisotype\u201d) did not develop typhlocolitis (Fig 10). Additionally, intestinal inflammation was associated with significantly increased spleen weights of IL-10R blocked mice (group \u201cIL-10R\u2193\u201d) compared to control animals (group \u201cisotype\u201d) at 21 dpi.

            "text": "IL-10 is a pleiotropic cytokine which suppresses Th1 and Th17 responses and reduces antigen-presenting cell function, while enhancing Th2 responses, Treg expansion, B cell maturation and Ab production [67]. Genetic ablation of IL-10 or IL-10R leads to spontaneous colitis in mice, representing a reliable model for human IBD [26, 68]. Likewise, the present survey shows, that IL-10R neutralization induces early onset and severe enteric disease in SJL mice. Similar findings can be observed in very early-onset-IBD, a pediatric disorder caused by genetic defects affecting the IL-10R [20, 21, 23, 25]. Genome-wide association studies also revealed a central role of the IL-10 axis in adult IBD pathogenesis [69]. Furthermore, autoantibodies against IL-10 and IL-10R can be found in a subset of human IBD patients, however, their pathogenic relevance remains to be determined [70, 71]. Disturbed mucosal homeostasis in IL-10-deficient mouse models is accompanied by a loss of intestinal regulatory myeloid cells (CX3CR1highCD11b+CD11c+) and Treg (CD4+Foxp3+) leading to aberrant Th1/Th17-mediated responses towards commensal gut microbiota and dietary Ag [72]. Noteworthy, genetic IL-10R deficits lead to a pro-inflammatory phenotype of regulatory CX3CR1high macrophages and development of colitis in mice [66]. In the present study also reduced numbers of CD4+Foxp3+ Treg together with increased numbers of CTL in the spleen indicates unbalanced immune responses, which may contribute to progressive intestinal inflammation. IHC revealed an initial infiltration of predominately CD3+ T cells and Iba1+ macrophages with a delayed CD45R+ B cell infiltration in the colon of IL-10R neutralized mice, suggestive of a T cell-mediated immunopathology. Dominating Th1- and/or Th17-mediated cellular immune responses can be observed also in Crohn`s disease, while Th2-mediated humoral responses are supposed to account for ulcerative colitis [73, 74]. Similar to human IBD, a seemingly paradox increased mucosal infiltration of Foxp3+ T cells is associated with colitis in IL-10R blocked mice [75\u201377]. Since Treg are critical for preventing intestinal inflammation, mucosal Foxp3+ T cells are unable to control gut immune homeostasis in the present study, either by an insufficient amount or cellular dysfunction, as described for immune mediated colitis in human patients [76\u201380]. The recruitment and sequestration of Foxp3+ T cells in the colon might contribute to the reduced frequency of splenic Treg in IL-10R neutralized mice observed by flow cytometry.",

In a previously established inducible IBD model, C57BL/6 mice infected with the pathobiont Helicobacter hepaticus, but not animals lacking these bacteria, responded to Ab-mediated IL-10R neutralization by colitis development [81]. Using SJL mice, which are prone to develop Th1-driven disorders [42, 43], we were able to induce similar intestinal lesions without an additional bacterial trigger. The predominately detrimental response of SJL mice to IL-10 signaling defects is also exemplified by therapeutic effects of Ab-mediated IL-10 or IL-10R blockade observed in WNV-infected C57BL/6 mice and LCMV-infected BALB/c mice [29\u201332].",

            "text": "Most strikingly, acute TMEV-infection has the capacity to transiently exacerbate enteric disease in IL-10R blocked mice. Here, the lack of a detectable influence of chronic TME upon enteritis severity indicates a disease phase-specific effect. Present data show that CNS infection causes a systemic hyperactive immune state following IL-10R blockade with up-regulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Although proof of causality is often missing, infections are supposed to trigger autoimmune disorders, such as MS, type 1 diabetes, Guillian-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus, by molecular mimicry, epitope spreading, release of cryptic Ag or bystander activation, respectively [82, 83]. Similarly, participation of viruses (e.g. measles virus, mumps virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus) in the initiation or exacerbation of IBD in human patients is currently under discussion [84, 85]. Our data provide evidence that extraintestinal infection can enhance enteric disease. Recently, similar effects have been described in experimental respiratory influenza virus infection, where intestinal injury is caused by lung-derived virus-specific CD4+ effector T cells, which destroy intestinal homeostasis and promote Th17 cell polarization [86]. Moreover, during the onset of EAE intestinal barrier dysfunction together with disturbed peripheral immune homeostasis probably caused by circulating myelin-specific encephalitogenic T cells has been described [87]. Thus, exacerbated colitis following TMEV-infection might be caused by an unspecific (bystander) stimulation of colitogenic T cells directed against different dietary antigens and/or gut microbiota due to an activation of peripheral immune responses. Other explanations include molecular mimicry between released CNS antigens and intestinal antigens and subsequent cross-reactivity of autoimmune lymphocytes, as discussed for the association (co-morbidity) between MS and IBD [88, 89]. In addition, stress increases intestinal permeability and exacerbates enteritis in rats, suggestive of brain-gut interaction [90, 91]. Although the basic mechanisms remain undetermined, also a correlation between psychological disorders and the prevalence and course of Crohn\u2019s disease has been reported [92\u201394]. Conversely, intestinal barrier damage and gut microbiota are supposed to trigger systemic and CNS autoimmunity [89, 95, 96], which might have contributed to the observed mild increased CD3+ T cell infiltration in the spinal cord during chronic TME (see below). Increased intestinal permeability often referred to as \u201cleaky gut\u201d syndrome can also be observed in MS and systemic autoimmune diseases, such as type I diabetes [97]. Interestingly, concurrent IBD has been observed in a subset of MS patients [88, 98]. The cause of this co-morbidity is still unclear, but genetic factors that predispose individuals to develop immune mediated disorders are assumed [99].",

Enhanced CD8-mediated cytotoxicity can contribute to intestinal inflammation in murine colitis models [100, 101]. Moreover, comparable with the present findings, an increased activation and memory differentiation of circulating CD8+ CTL is associated with an aggressive disease course including frequent clinical relapses in human IBD patients [102]. Furthermore, intestinal tract damage is associated with systemic CD4+ and CD8+ T cell activation [103]. Using DNA microarray analyses, we previously observed an activation of lymphoid organs (cervical LN, spleen) of SJL mice during early TME (14 dpi), followed by transcriptional silencing during the chronic demyelinating phase [53]. Thus, the transient nature of peripheral immune activation in the TME model might explain the observed temporary worsening of IL-10R blockade-mediated enteritis during the acute infection and disease phase-dependent alterations of peripheral immune responses, respectively. The increased frequency of CD4+Foxp+ Treg, together with an enhanced mRNA expression of Foxp3 and modulatory cytokines, such as IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2, might represent compensatory attempts to sustain peripheral immune homeostasis and dampen overwhelming immune responses following IL-10R neutralization and concurrent acute TMEV infection [17, 75\u201377]. Expansion of Foxp3 Treg has been shown to efficiently reduce antiviral immunity in TMEV-infected SJL mice [104]. However, probably due to the limited Treg recruitment to the CNS, as described by Foxp3-specific immunohistochemistry and RT-qPCR, no treatment effects upon viral load or neuropathology were found in the present study.",

            "text": "A mild increased CD3+ T cells influx together with reduced IL-6 expression was observed in the infected spinal cord following IL-10R blockade during the chronic TME phase. Similarly, enhanced TMEV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in the CNS are associated with decreased IL-10 production in CD11b+Ly6c+ depleted mice [105] and in MS patients a leukocyte disability to produce IL-10 is supposed to foster CNS disease progression [106]. The inhibitory effect of IL-10 upon neuroinflammation is also illustrated by IL-10 or IL-10R blockade in EAE [107, 108]. However, in contrast to the EAE model no overt changes upon spinal cord pathology were observed in TMEV-infected mice following Ab treatment in the present experiments. IL-6 represents a pleotropic cytokine exhibiting detrimental and neuroprotective effects in different CNS disorders [109]. A complex and probably ambivalent function of IL-6 can also be observed in the TME model. For instance, treatment with recombinant IL-6 reduces spinal cord demyelination in susceptible mice infected with the Daniel`s strain of TMEV [110]. Moreover, exogenous IL-6 inhibits TMEV replication in cultured macrophages [111]. By contrast, studies using the BeAn-TMEV strain have shown that excessive IL-6 promotes pathogenic Th17 responses and viral persistence by preventing apoptosis of virus-infected cells [5, 112]. IL-6, in interplay with other cytokines, also contributes to T cell exhaustion and inadequate viral elimination in TME [113, 114]. However, sole IL-6 reduction following IL-10R neutralization is apparently insufficient to alter local CNS inflammatory responses in the present study. In addition, CNS virus load remained unchanged, indicative of an unaffected antiviral immunity. Possible explanations for the limited effect of anti-IL-10R treatment in TME include (i) autonomous immune responses triggered by virus persistence in the spinal cord, (ii) an inability of the anti-IL-10R Ab to penetrate the blood spinal cord barrier and reach sufficient CNS levels, and/or (iii) a preferential recruitment of inflammatory cells to the intestine with peripheral sequestration. In TMEV-infected SJL mice local Ag presentation and plasma cell differentiation in the spinal cord together with an intact blood spinal cord barrier are supposed to cause a CNS-restricted inflammation [115\u2013117]. Similarly, closure of the blood brain barrier, isolating the CNS from peripheral lymphoid organs, is supposed to play a pivotal role in therapy failure in chronic MS patients [118\u2013122]. In general, CNS uptake of therapeutic antibodies is limited by an intact neurovascular endothelium [123]. Thus, prominent blood brain barrier damage and permeability present in experimental WNV- or LCMV-infection explains the restoration of antiviral immunity in the CNS and beneficial effects of anti-IL-10/IL10-R treatment in these infection models in contrast to TME [30, 31, 124, 125]. Detrimental effects of IL-10R blockade in TME might be circumvented by adequate Ab delivery systems across the blood spinal cord barrier to guarantee sufficient CNS Ab levels and to reduce systemic adverse effects [123, 126\u2013128].",
