It was listed as endangered in 2009, under both the Federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) and California Endangered Species Act (CESA). Considerable efforts are presently being made to understand the causes of this recent population decline [4,5], especially because several other pelagic species have shown similar population trends. Delta habitats have been compromised by a number of complex factors, both known and unknown, potentially affecting aquatic species throughout the Sacramento-San Joaquin watersheds and estuary [4]. Pollution, in the form of chemicals contained in runoff from agricultural and urban areas, and old mining sites, treated wastewater effluent, along with the effects of water exports, invasive species and habitat destruction are amongst potential causes for the population decline of several pelagic species [5].",

Contaminants may not only affect organism survival, but can compromise ecological fitness of individual species via sublethal physiological, behavioral or immunological effects (e.g. [6-10]), consequently altering food web and ecosystem dynamics. However, such physiological endpoints are often difficult to determine in field studies, because they either require behavioral observation and measurements, or because affected individuals will not survive in the wild. Similarly, widely used ecotoxicological tools such as standard toxicity tests [11,12] cannot easily be adapted to resident species of concern, and, conversely, it is problematic to extrapolate test results obtained with surrogate species to resident species of concern [13]. Recent comparative studies have demonstrated a need for identifying effects directly in the species of concern, as traditional model organisms may differ in sensitivity and physiological response to environmental contaminants and other stressors [14,15].",

            "text": "Carefully selected molecular biomarkers can provide species-specific and sensitive, mechanistic information on the overall health of an organism, as toxic responses are often preceded by alterations in gene expression [16,17]. In particular microarray gene profiling is a powerful tool for defining genome-wide effects of environmental change on biological function [16,18,19]. The predictive value of microarrays as screening tools, as well as our understanding of these responses and their application in the field of ecotoxicology is rapidly growing. This technology can be applied in vertebrates and invertebrates, plants, algae, cell lines and unicellular organisms [20]. In addition, links are being established between specific molecular biomarkers identified by microarray technology, and higher-level life history parameters, such as metabolism, growth and reproduction [16,18,21,22]. Gene expression studies carried out over short-term exposures have allowed for the prediction of chronic stressor effects, such as reduced fecundity and embryonic arrest, somatic growth, and population dynamics [16,18,21,23]. Thus, specific gene responses in studied organisms would not only be indicative of health status, but when used in conservation studies, could highlight potential causes for population decline. However, few biomarkers are currently understood well enough to provide conclusive evidence of contaminant impacts on aquatic species in field monitoring, and extrapolating effects seen at the biomarker level to individual or population-level toxicity continues to be a challenge. For molecular biomarkers to be used as successful monitoring tools of individual, population and ecosystem damage, strong links need to continue to be established between gene expression and health status.",

No genomic information was available on any database at the time this project began, other than a few mitochondrial sequences used in taxonomic studies [24]. We describe here, the construction and first application of this tool to identify genes in the delta smelt, specifically responding to exposure to esfenvalerate, a pyrethroid insecticide, and present gene expression quantitation of selected biomarkers, utilizing these to explain observed swimming abnormalities. We used esfenvalerate in our study because biochemical responses and adverse effects on the whole organisms are relatively well understood [25] and therefore would aid interpretation of results in this \"proof of principle\" test. Esfenvalerate [(S)-a-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl-(S)-2-(-4-chlorophenyl)-3-methylbutyrate] is a synthetic pyrethroid insecticide, widely used in agriculture, with a high risk to aquatic organisms [26]. It causes neurological damage by blocking sodium and potassium channels, resulting in repetitive neurological discharge [25]. In addition, pyrethroid insecticides are highly soluble in myelin sheaths of nerves, causing demyelination, resulting in conduction deficiencies through nerve lesions [27], directly affecting swimming ability, and impinging on foraging and migration. Fish are highly sensitive to this insecticide, with for example effects on bluegill behavior at measured concentrations as low as 0.025 \u03bcg/L-1[28]. Pyrethroids have also been reported to affect growth, induce immune responses, reduce hepatic glycogen levels and delay spawning [9,29].",

Swimming abnormality in 10-d old larvae, intensified with increasing esfenvalerate concentration at 4 h, escalating significantly after 24 h exposure (figure 1a). This swimming abnormality was also concentration dependent in 52-d old fish, however swimming effects resulting from different time point measurements differed only at the highest exposure concentration of 0.250 \u03bcg.L-1 (figure 1b), where effects on motion increased from 22.5% anomaly at 4 h to 45% at 24 h. Behavioral abnormalities, reduced food intake and growth, as well as increased susceptibility to predation were reported in fathead minnow larvae exposed to esfenvalerate for 4 h to concentrations above 0.455 \u03bcg.L-1 [10]. Significant swimming impairments were determined in this study at 0.250 \u03bcg.L-1, thus delta smelt are highly sensitive to sublethal esfenvalerate exposure. Furthermore, bioaccumulation in rainbow trout have resulted in concentrations 400 times higher than background ambient levels http://extoxnet.orst.edu.",

Of the sequenced ESTs that responded significantly, 118 genes were successfully annotated; 170 matched unnamed or hypothetical proteins, or did not match the described annotation selection criteria; i.e. BLASTx searches resulted in expect-values greater than 1 \u00d7 10-5 and scores below 50. Based on gene ontology; molecular function, biological processes and cellular components, 94 unique genes were functionally classified (figure 2 and table 1) and described below. Based on the proportions of ESTs responding to successfully annotated unique genes (33%), it is estimated that of the 8,448 ESTs printed on the microarray, there could be above 2,500 unique genes identified in the delta smelt. These numbers however represent responses to a single contaminant, and should not be construed as final as there will have an intrinsic bias exerted upon them, however, the proportion of repeated sequences in the analyses was very low, with a maximum of nine repetitions for CHK1 checkpoint homologue and not more than one or two duplication for a few others. It is also important to note that the microarray was manufactured with incomplete genome data, thus information presented in figure 2 represents proportions of a limited number of available genes.",

Localized in fast-contracting muscles, some endocrine tissues, in the nervous system in GABAergic interneurons and in the brain [33], parvalbumin removes calcium from myofibrils, protecting neurons from hyper-excitability and facilitating muscle relaxation [34]. Accumulation of calcium in muscular tissue contributes to muscle degradation, muscular dystrophy and muscle fiber necrosis [35]. Estrogen is required for parvalbumin expression, thus estrogen receptor-\u03b2 co-expresses with parvalbumin [36]. Estrogen is also required in brain development and has a protective neurological role, by regulating the activity of GABAergic systems within the hippocampus, basal forebrain and hypothalamus [37]. Differential expression of parvalbumin on exposure to esfenvalerate may be resultant of estrogenic effects. Pyrethroid pesticides have steroid receptor-binding activity [38] linked with endocrine disruption [39], thus exposure is likely to affect the population dynamics of wildlife not only through neuromuscular impairments, but also by affecting reproductive output [29,40]. Parvalbumin, could therefore, be a good indicator of possible endocrine-disruption as well as neuromuscular impairments.",

Aspartoacylase catalyzes hydrolysis of N-acetyl-L-aspartate (NAA) to aspartate and acetate in the vertebrate brain [41]. Variations in NAA measured in urine, blood and brain, have been used as diagnosis of nervous system diseases such as Alzheimer's and multiple sclerosis [42,43]. Measurements of NAA, along with ADP levels determined by creatine kinase activity, are used to evaluate the energetic state of the brain, a positive linear correlation existing between NAA and ADP synthesis [44]. Deficiency in ASPA activity leads to degeneration of the myelin; an ensheathment that isolates and controls axonal activity, it is associated with schizophrenia [45], and is the established cause of leukodystrophy in Canavan's disease [43]. Abnormal myelination is known to result from acyltransferase deficiency [46]. Ependymin, a myelin associated glycoprotein related to memory formation and involved in neuronal regeneration [47], was also negatively affected by esfenvalerate. Myelin has been postulated as a probable modulator of ASPA activity [48] further affecting this critical pathway of neurological function. ASPA protein activity is a strong biomarker of brain damage and neurological impairment investigation, used regularly in human and veterinary disease diagnostics [49].",

Creatine kinase protein is used not only as a diagnosis of brain energetic value as mentioned above, but also of diseases like cardiac infarction and skeletal muscle necrosis [50]. In muscle, creatine kinase is specifically bound to sarcoendoplasmic reticulum, and regulates calcium uptake and ATP/ADP ratios [51], thus is directly involved in muscle contraction. Of interest here, are the pathway links and correlating responses (r = 0.98) between parvalbumin; facilitating muscle relaxation by binding calcium, and creatine kinase, which regulates calcium uptake. These two parameters on their own indicate muscular activity impairments, creating strong links with observed larval swimming behavior.",

High concentrations of \u03b2-microglobulin are reported to inhibit generation of functional dendritic cells [56], thus an increased amount in the blood or urine may be a sign of neural degeneration and of certain diseases, including some types of cancer, such as multiple myeloma or lymphoma. \u03b2-microglobulin levels are also reported to rise following viral infection and its reduced expression can compromise the immune system [57]. Interestingly, exposure to esfenvalerate resulted in a significant increase of pathogen susceptibility in chinook salmon [9]. \u03b2-microglobulin assessment with q-PCR did not show any significance in expression in 10 d old larvae (t-test, p = 0.131), however, an overall increase was observed at low concentrations of esfenvalerate, correlating significantly with expression of other genes investigated, further discussed below.",

Enzymatic activity requires an aspartic acid residue, and plays a critical role in the regulation of proinflammatory cytokines [61] that are associated with septic shock and autoimmune syndromes [62]. Upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines were reported in viral infected salmon, which further increased in expression following esfenvalerate exposure [63]. Caspases contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as ischemia, Krabbes and Huntington's diseases, Alzheimer's, and other leukodystrophic diseases resulting in neural degeneration [64,65]. Moreover, caspase inhibitors have been suggested as therapeutic treatments for neurodegenerative diseases [66]. Low concentrations of esfenvalerate; 0.0313 \u03bcg.L-1, significantly induced caspase-3 expression 2-fold (t-test, p = 0.002) in 10-d old delta smelt. As caspases are activated by aspartic acid, induction may be suggestive of increases in substrate residues, along with inflammatory cytokines, probable effects upon the immune system, and subsequent neurodegeneration. Furthermore, a decrease in ASPA expression could be suggestive of reduced breakdown of NNA to aspartate and acetate, required as substrate for caspase activity, and synthesis of proteins required in repair mechanisms.",

Hemopexin-like protein, a gene sequence displaying vast similarities to warm-temperature-acclimation-related-65 protein (WAP65) on BLAST homologies with Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes), was identified as significantly upregulated through microarray screening. Hemopexin is synthesized by Schwann cells following nerve injury [67], accumulation has been reported in the peripheral nervous system following axonal lesions, and is specifically regulated during repair, returning to normal levels on axonal regeneration [68]. Wallerian degeneration occurs after axonal injury and is critical for repair, it is characterized by axonal and myelin degeneration [69], is accompanied by macrophage invasion and subsequent synthesis of hemopexin [67]. Hemopexin appears to play a significant role in neural regeneration, but may be resultant of oxidative stress mediated T cell activity on myelin sheaths (described above, under immune responses). Though upregulation follows nerve injury and there are strong connections with apoptosis, we classify hemopexin under oxidative stress as it has a high affinity with heme and reportedly plays a strong role in both heme transport and preventing heme-catalyzed oxidative damage [70]. Moreover, pyrethroids have been shown to generate free radicals and induce oxidative stress [71]. Heme is known to respond to nerve injury, and has been suggested to play a role in neurodegenerative disorders [72], and hemopexin-mediated heme transport was reported to significantly decrease levels of transferrin receptor mRNA in HeLa cells [70]. Transferrin was also identified by microarray screening as significantly upregulated by esfenvalerate exposure. The primary role of transferrin is the delivery of iron across the blood brain barrier, and its expression in brain is not only related to myelin production, but may be a permissive agent in the process of myelination [73]. Furthermore, hemopexin and transferrin reportedly act by similar receptor-mediated mechanisms [74].",

Composed primarily of glycoproteins with various functions during fertilization and development, choriogenin has been suggested as a biomarker of exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals, as it is induced in late stage embryos, larvae and adult male fish exposed to estrogens [76,77]. Choriogenin is synthesized in liver of adult females, in response to estrogen, transported in blood and incorporated into the fish egg envelope; chorion or zona pellucida (ZPA), an extracellular matrix that surrounds the oocyte and early embryo [78].

Downregulation of PXR expression has been linked with growth inhibition and cell death in rats and human cell lines following exposure to medroxyprogesterone and estradiol, known PXR ligands [80], further supporting identified apoptotic responses, steroid receptor-binding and endocrine disruption activity of esfenvalerate [38,39]. PXR expression was not significantly different in q-PCR assessments of 10-d old larvae exposed to esfenvalerate, however, overall expression declined in a dose response manner, correlating with ASPA (r = 0.880; p = 0.049), making it a notable candidate of xenobiotic detection for future biomarker investigations in the delta smelt.",

Pyrethroids have been suggested to induce osmotic imbalances in common carp larvae [82] which are linked to effects on ATPase activity responsible for maintaining the Sodium trans-membrane electrochemical gradient [83]. Larval fish are under direct exposure to osmotic stress as their endocrine system is not fully developed [84].

We have, however, examined and confirmed effect of esfenvalerate upon some of the genes in a different age group of larval delta smelt, identifying significant responses that are primarily linked with swimming behavior. Some responding genes can be classified within different functional groups. Due to the measured behavioral responses, the classification approach contains a certain bias towards understanding neuromuscular effects. It is interesting that qPCR measurements have identified a greater response at the lower concentrations, implying homeostatic alterations, at environmentally relevant concentrations. Most genes did not display a desired dose response correlation associated with usable biomarkers, but did support responses within the suite of genes investigated, somewhat validating their use within a broader biomarker approach. Hemopexin for example is known to be involved in axon repair, and the myelin sheath surrounding the axon needs to be degraded for this repair to be processed, hypothesizing therefore that ASPA downregulation is resultant of neurological damage. The subsequent decrease of hemopexin expression at higher exposure concentrations, and further decrease in ASPA, may be indicative of repair impairments.",

We would hypothesize that induction of transcription of the genes encoding ASPA, hemopexin, parvalbumin and creatine kinase are part of a pathway of damage triggered repair mechanisms, responding to esfenvalerate insult. Reduction in expression of ASPA indicates that myelin sheaths may be degraded, resulting in a number of detrimental effects on the lesion sites, and similarly, muscular structure and function is being compromised as measured by alterations in titin and myozenin expression. The expression of \u03b2-microglobulins could be a compensatory reaction to toxic damage, protecting cells from infections in a susceptible immune system caused by exposure to esfenvalerate. Previous studies, carried out in esfenvalerate exposed chinook salmon have reported a compromised immunity and significantly higher susceptibility to infection [9,63]. This is particularly important in younger organisms that are generally more susceptible than adults.

The high susceptibility of delta smelt to esfenvalerate, mediated neurological damage resulting in impaired swimming ability, also raises questions on the likely effects upon their chemosensory system; olfactory system, important in sensing reproductive pheromones, mediating reproduction. Females synthesize sex hormones stimulating male reproductive behavior [87]. Neurological damage affecting the olfactory nerves, the brain and or entire nervous system, could lead to further impairments in reproductive success following exposure to pyrethroids. Damage to the olfactory system has been used as a sublethal toxicological endpoint in fish, in studies investigating behavior following pesticide exposures [88]. Pyrethroids are known to affect the olfactory system [89]. A chemosensory gene, ictacalcin, responding to esfenvalerate exposure was also differentially expressed on the microarray. Ictacalcin is a gene originally identified in catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), involved in chemosensory tissues, and highly expressed in barbell, olfactory mucosa and gill [90]. Differential expression of this gene may indicate that further behavioral parameters, not investigated in this study, such as recognition, alarm response, feeding, imprinting and homing, gamete release and synchronization, contaminant avoidance [88], and other behavioral parameters that are governed by chemosensory system, could be compromised. We could speculate that outside laboratory conditions, neuromuscular and chemosensory impairments would probably result in higher ecological parameters being affected through inability to swim against water currents, making them more susceptible to predation and reducing their ability to obtain food. Furthermore, effects on chemosensory parameters would lead to migratory, reproductive, predator and contaminant avoidance impairments.",

The approach did not use scale estimator for statistical inference and, therefore, it did not require between-slide normalization. This method however, detected only one significant differentially expressed candidate gene at the highest exposure concentration (0.125 \u03bcg/L-1), (with no significant annotation identity - see results and discussion). As a result, a second analytical method was applied to increase the number of probable genes for consideration in biomarker development. Thus we further analyzed the data using LIMMA GUI (Linear model for microarray analysis graphical user interface) [92], written in the R-programming language available through Bioconductor http://www.Bioconductor.org. Data was normalized within arrays using print-tip Lowess and between arrays applying aquantile normalization methods [92]. A linear model fit was computed using the duplicates on the arrays and the least-squares method, no multiple assessment methods were applied to eliminate false positives as our aim was to increase the number of genes available for biomarker assessment, and qualify these through quantitative PCR.",
