These issues could arise in any setting where rapid decision making is required, e.g. the Emergency Department, primary care, a paramedical rural service, an out-of-hours doctor service or in the home, as well as in middle- and low-income countries [1], [2], [3], [4], [5].",

The initial three-part differential count expanded to the five-part differential count, with differentiation of the granulocyte count into neutrophil, basophil and eosinophil counts. Viral and bacterial infections are arguably the most common cause of acquired neutropenia [6], [7], through margination of neutrophils and destruction by circulating antibodies [8]. Neutrophil levels may also be decreased due to congenital haematological malignancies [9], as a result of radiotherapy [10] or through the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs [11]. Extreme reductions in neutrophil count can lead to serious complications such as febrile neutropenia (fever >38\u00b0C and neutrophil count <0.5\u00d7109cells/L [12]), increasing the risk of sepsis-associated mortality [13], necessitating urgent clinical assessment in at risk patients. Thus, most chemotherapy patients are given immediate empirical antibiotics upon suspicion of infection [14]. In such patients, access to a rapid differential white count is vital as delays in administration of broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics are associated with increased mortality risk, but overtreatment with unnecessary antibiotics has opportunity costs [15].",

These patients tend to be at home, and a health-care professional is required to obtain a venous sample from frequently accessed veins which need to be preserved for delivery of chemotherapy, but are often already compromised by vesicant and irritant cytotoxic drugs.

However, it should be noted that these guidelines assume a full clinical assessment is carried out. Three-part differential analysers might have the potential to be used as point of care devices where the patient may be remote from the clinician; therefore, this work analysed the performance of granulocytes with reference to neutrophil count thresholds greater than 0.5 \u00d7 109/L to allow for safety margins required due to absent clinical information. The important clinical question is: if using the equivalent granulocyte count indicates the patient has an ANC above the specified threshold, how sure can we be that this is correct? As an example, using granulocyte count to indicate a neutrophil result is less than 1.0 \u00d7 109/L, the best performing granulocyte count in terms of balancing false negatives with false positives would be <1.13 \u00d7 109/L, but in order to obtain no false negative results, a significantly higher threshold needs to be used. This would be offset by increasing the false positives. It is a clinical decision as to whether this is acceptable, and is dependent upon the consequences of misclassification of a result. However, this concept would have to be tested in an appropriate clinical trial setting with a point of care testing (POCT) system with a 3-part differential measurement capability.",
