Annual influenza epidemics resulted in more than 30,000 deaths a year in the United States during 1990\u20131999[1], [2]. Periodic pandemics result in significantly higher death tolls. Emergence of new influenza A virus strains can be caused by \u201cantigenic shift,\u201d resulting from reassortment of gene segments, including H and/or N types[3], [4], \u201cantigenic drift\u201d resulting from the continuing accumulation of mutations in the H and N genes[5], or a pathogenic virus jumping species and acquiring the ability to infect and be transmitted among humans, as in the 1918 pandemic[6]. The recent outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus (HPAI), which originated in Southeast Asia and has since spread globally, has resulted in 166 deaths (272 confirmed human cases) as of February 6, 2007 (http://www.who.int/en/). The global emergence of this virus has brought renewed urgency to the effort to track the spread and the evolution of influenza viruses.",

Since there are many H and N subtypes with significant intra- and inter-subtype sequence variations, these methods do not identify all H and N subtypes, nor are they likely to identify reassortants or newly emerging genetic variants. Further, none of the current surveillance methods provide information relevant to tracking antigenically novel strains that emerge each year or distinguish amongst multiple lineages of influenza viruses that can co-circulate and persist in a population[12]. Secondary genome sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analyses are necessary to fully understand the multiple lineages of viruses, recognize newly emergent influenza variants, and monitor global spread of these viruses[12], [13]. For instance, analysis of human influenza virus H3N2 sequences from 1999\u20132004 revealed that at least three major clades of influenza viruses were in circulation after the 2002\u20132003 influenza season[12]. The differences were due to multiple reassortment events though all shared a common H-gene lineage. Several similar whole-genome studies with avian influenza viruses have revealed the presence of multiple, region-specific sub-lineages of the HPAI H5N1 virus in Southeast Asia that are spreading to Europe and Africa[14]\u2013[18].",

The subtype of three samples could not be distinguished between H3N2 and H1N2 because these viruses probably arose from a recent reassortment of the H gene from an H1N1 virus with gene segments from an H3N2 virus[12]. Importantly, our predictions agreed completely with serology and direct RT-PCR analysis of the H and N segments from these samples.

The most abundant BC type observed in 2005\u20132006 (AADFAA, 97 instances) was also one of the more abundant BC types from the previous winter flu season in the southern hemisphere (e.g., A/Canterbury/125/2005; Figure 3, 2005 South), suggesting that this BC type from the southern hemisphere might have been the founder of the 2005\u20132006 BC types in the northern hemisphere. Most of the other BC types observed in the 2005\u20132006 season were within one or two mutations of this major BC type, suggesting that these might have been derived from AADFAA through mutations during the 2005\u20132006 season. A second BC-type (AABFAA), which differs from AADFAA by a single mutation in the M1 locus, was also observed in the 2005 South and 2005\u20132006 North seasons and was potentially the founder of several additional BC types observed in 2005\u20132006.

At one end of the spectrum, a conventional RT-PCR test with specific primers and probes provides a highly-specific, sensitive, rapid, convenient, quantitative, relatively inexpensive, and high-throughput format that can provide valuable surveillance information. However, these tests are not optimal for surveillance when the exact nature of the pandemic virus is not known. Moreover, without supplemental nucleic acid sequencing, conventional RT-PCR-based tests are not capable of signaling the appearance of new genetic variants, except by potentially demonstrating a loss of sensitivity. Further, a single RT-PCR test can achieve only a single presence/absence analysis limited to the specific target for which it was designed. Discrimination of all known variants of influenza at the level of resolution described here would require hundreds of independent RT-PCR reactions. At the other end of the spectrum, virus isolation using culture methods followed by complete genome sequencing does not require prior knowledge of the virus' sequence and provides clade-level resolution and highly detailed information regarding virus evolution. Unfortunately, this method is slow, labor intensive, expensive, and low throughput, rendering it ineffective in public health arenas requiring rapid response.",

For example, our method may identify mixed populations of viruses, either as viral quasispecies as previously illustrated (i.e., development of \u201cdrift\u201d strains) or co-infections with circulating strains (i.e., potential for development of \u201cshift\u201d strains). Recent advances in ESI-MS using bench-top mass spectrometers have enabled analysis of PCR amplicons with sufficient mass accuracy that the nucleotide base composition (the A, G, C, and T count) of the PCR amplicon can be unambiguously determined[23]. The approach outlined here provides two important advantages for surveillance. First, broad-range primers targeted to highly-conserved sites within the influenza virus family that flank highly variable, information-rich regions can be used to amplify sequences from highly diverse viruses in the same assay. The measured base compositions allow identification of the viral species with a high degree of resolution. For this approach, we selected primer pairs targeting the core gene segments (PB1, PB2, PA, M, NS, and NP) that have conserved regions spanning all known influenza viruses and used the resultant base compositions to infer the influenza virus H/N types. In silico analysis of influenza virus sequences from the GenBank database showed that this approach would detect all known influenza viruses and distinguish >90% of all species and types. This overcomes the limitations of directly targeting the H and N segments, which requires specific primer pairs for each known H/N type. Further, since the H/N segments evolve rapidly, newly emerging strains might not be readily detected by the traditional approach.",

The majority (97) of the samples had identical BC types and probably arose from a single founder from the previous season in the southern hemisphere. Most of the remaining samples differed from this founder BC type by one or two additional point mutations within the target regions described here.

The use of RT-PCR/ESI-MS for human as well as avian/animal surveillance offers the potential for new insights into viral evolution on a scale and at a cost previously not possible. Bench-top mass spectrometers are capable of analyzing complex PCR products at a rate of approximately one reaction product/minute, making the RT-PCR/ESI-MS technology practical for large-scale analysis of clinical specimens or for animal surveillance. Further, as we have demonstrated with influenza viruses, this method provides sensitive detection directly from patient specimens with specificity approximating sequence-level resolution. The ability to quantitate virus shedding, detect low-abundance, mixed infections, and identify new genetic variants without prior knowledge of viral sequence also make this technology ideally suited for monitoring the emergence of drug-resistance mutations during therapy or for identifying newly emerging antigenic variants.",

Complete genome sequences of all H3N2 human influenza viruses available in GenBank were analyzed. A total of 731 genomes were included, from which we inferred the phylogeny of H3N2 influenza virus since 1996. Using the 565-nucleotide concatenated sequence of the six loci that we analyzed by RT-PCR/ESI-MS, we constructed a non-redundant alignment of 105 sequence types. Base compositions were determined for each genome segment (i.e., locus) analyzed and each unique base composition at each of these loci was assigned a letter according to decreasing number of occurrences (therefore, the letter A represents the most common allele identified at each locus). The concatenation of the six base-composition letters from the PB1, NP, M1, PA, NS1, and NS2 loci from the sequences of 731 H3N2 viruses (1996\u20132005) available in GenBank yielded 95 six-letter codes referred to as base composition types (BC types). The predominant type is labeled AAAAAA. The topology of the tree was then deduced from the alignment of non-redundant sequences using the programs dnadist and neighbor from the Phylip package (http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html). Since the sequence types differ mostly by discrete single mutations, the original computer-generated tree was then extensively edited using graphics tools to place the labels of intermediate types within the tree itself in lieu of zero-length branches. Readability was further improved by sorting parallel branches chronologically.",

Panel C shows detection of a low abundance type (2\u20135%). Panel D shows a close-up view of the mass spectrum from Panel C. In this view, the shoulder of the peak is fit with a single mass model (blue dotted line) and a two mass model (dashed red line).",
