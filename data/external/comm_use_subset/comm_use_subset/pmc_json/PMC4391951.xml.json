They pose a continuing challenge to human health because their ability to infect a wide variety of organisms (including avian and mammalian species) fosters rapid evolution of their genomic RNA by recombination [1]. This may generate viral strains that are more virulent or recalcitrant to therapeutic interventions. Four human coronaviruses (hCoV-229E, hCoV-NL63, hCoV-OC43 and hCoV-HKU1) are in global circulation and cause respiratory infections typically characterized as the common cold [2]. A novel fifth hCoV, termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), emerged during 2002 to 2003, and affected nearly 8000 people with a 10% mortality rate [2].",

As of October 2, 2014, 853 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infections with 301 deaths have been reported globally to the World Health Organization (WHO) [5, 6]. Since March 2014, the infection frequency rapidly increased, with 647 cases having been reported within the past six months [5, 7]. Infections have been catalogued in the Middle East (Jordan, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates), Africa (Egypt and Tunisia), Europe (France, Germany, Greece, Italy and the United Kingdom), Asia (Malaysia and Philippines) and North America (the United States of America) [8\u201315]. Numerous clustered cases in Europe and the Middle East indicate that human to human transmission is occurring via droplets or direct contact in healthcare environments, households, and the workplace [16\u201318]. Clinical presentation of MERS-CoV infection ranges from asymptomatic (21%) or mild symptoms (5%) to very severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, and potentially multi-organ failure resulting in death (62%) [7]. While currently MERS-CoV apparently has limited pandemic potential, a human epidemic might still result from sustained transmission in animal reservoirs with sporadic human spill-overs and sustained human-to-human transmission [19, 20].",

Corman et al. have reported diagnostic real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays for qualitative and quantitative detection of MERS-CoV that are available in the RealStar kit (Altona Diagnostics GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) [2, 22]. These assays target regions in and around the viral genes open reading frame (ORF)1a, ORF1b and E. While these assays have been expertly designed and validated their execution demands expensive instrumentation and a dedicated laboratory environment with technically skilled operators. These characteristics are unsuitable to on-site disease tracking, which is critical for monitoring worldwide emerging infections [21]. Serological assays have also been developed including conventional immunofluorescence assays using virus-infected cells as well as Vero cells expressing the MERS-CoV N and S proteins [23], but serological distinction of different hCoVs remains challenging [24].",

            "text": "Isothermal amplification methods and probes have been widely used for nucleic acid diagnostics [25\u201327]. Among these, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) [28] is ideally suited for field-based nucleic acid diagnostics due to minimal requirements for instrumentation, high sensitivity, and rapid results [29, 30]. Standard LAMP is a four-primer technique of auto-cycling strand displacement DNA synthesis mediated by the large fragment of Bst DNA polymerase using four primers designed to recognize six sequences (F3, F2, F1, B3, B2 and B1) in the target DNA [28]. Inner primers (FIP and BIP) composed of antisense and sense target sequences (F1c-F2 and B1c-B2, respectively) initiate DNA synthesis. The newly synthesized strands are released following strand displacement DNA synthesis primed by the outer primers (F3 and B3). The displaced strand can be primed by a second set of inner and outer primers and following extension yields a DNA product with a stem-loop structure. In subsequent cycles inner primers hybridize to the loops and initiate strand displacement DNA synthesis. This continuous amplification process ultimately leads to the accumulation of as many as 109\u20131010 copies of the target within an hour. Inclusion of two additional primers that bind the two loop regions (resulting in a six-primer LAMP reaction) can significantly accelerate the amplification reaction [31]. The final LAMP reaction product consists of a DNA concatamer in which loops interspersed between alternating inverted repeats of the target generate a cauliflower-like structure.",

Nucleic acid probes that hybridize to the transiently single-stranded LAMP loop sequences have been previously reported to enhance assay specificity by allowing real-time sequence validation of LAMP amplicons. Examples include fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) signals that arise when a pair of oligonucleotides labeled with a donor (fluorescein) or an acceptor (LC Red 640) fluorophore [32] bind simultaneously to LAMP loops. In another strategy, LAMP reactions containing both the amplicon of interest (target) and a closely related internal amplification standard (competitor) are probed with the \u2018alternately binding quenching\u2019 probe (ABQprobe) that can bind to the LAMP loops of both the target and the competitor. The 5\u2019-end of the ABQprobe is labeled with the green fluorophore BODIPY FL that is quenched by electron transfer to guanosine residues in the target LAMP loops. In contrast, the probe fluorescence intensity remains high upon binding the internal competitor amplicons in which these guanine residues are replaced with cytosine. Thus the fluorescence intensity of the ABQprobe reflects the ratio of LAMP products arising from the target and competitor [33].",

            "text": "However, both methods suffer from potential drawbacks. The significant overlap in the binding site of the FRET probes and the loop primers can reduce the efficiency of probe and primer binding and thereby result in a competition that slows signal generation. Co-amplification of an internal competitor for detection using the ABQprobe can also decrease assay sensitivity. To overcome this difficulty, we have also exploited loop regions in developing novel, real-time, sequence-specific signal transducers termed one-step strand displacement (OSD) probes that can be used for real-time sequence validation of LAMP amplicons [34]. OSD probes are partial DNA duplexes whose longer, fluorophore-labeled strands hybridize to the target amplicons via toehold-mediated strand displacement reactions [35\u201337]. The ensuing release of the shorter, quencher-bearing oligonucleotides from the fluorescent probes results in fluorescence accumulation during the amplification reaction; the more correct loops that arise, the more strand displacement reaction and thus the more fluorescent probes that are released.",

The WHO laboratory testing guidelines specify that at least two separate genetic loci of MERS-CoV must be amplified for definitive diagnosis [40]. To meet these criteria three genes were targeted to enable conclusive MERS-CoV diagnosis via isothermal amplification. Twenty one complete MERS-CoV genome sequences were aligned along with phylogenetically-related CoV species including Bat-HKU5-1, SARS-CoV, hCoV-229E, hCoV-HKU1, hCoV-NL63 and hCoV-OC43 (Table 1) [1, 41, 42]. Three genomic regions in and around the MERS-CoV genes ORF1a, ORF1b and E were chosen for primer design based on their sequence identity within the MERS-CoV strains and significant sequence divergence from the related CoV species. These genetic loci have been previously used successfully as targets for RT-PCR-based MERS-CoV diagnostic assays and have been recommended by the WHO for laboratory testing of MERS-CoV [2, 23, 40]. LAMP primer design was constrained to include at least a 30 bp gap between the F1 and F2 as well as between the B1 and B2 priming sites. These gaps will become part of the LAMP amplicon loop structures and were included to allow subsequent priming by \u2018loop\u2019 primers and detection via the OSD probes.",

For this purpose, T7 RNA polymerase-driven transcription templates containing MERS-CoV-derived sequences were generated by PCR-mediated amplification of the cloned MERS-CoV surrogate gBlock sequences. Following in vitro transcription and subsequent removal of the DNA transcription templates by DNase I digestion, the transcripts were purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Known amounts of MERS-CoV-specific or non-specific RNA templates were then used to optimize the buffer and enzymatic conditions for one-pot RT-LAMP assays (S4 Fig). Our results indicate that while Bst 2.0 DNA polymerase demonstrated significant RT-LAMP activity alone (based on its inherent reverse transcriptase activity [48]), the reaction speed was substantially improved by incorporation of AMV reverse transcriptase (AMV RT) in the reaction. AMV RT is also known to generate significant amounts of cDNA at temperatures as high as 65 \u00b0C [49]. Furthermore, while LAMP amplification of DNA templates was efficient in 1X Isothermal buffer, one-pot RT-LAMP performance was improved by using a buffer system composed of 1X Thermopol buffer and 0.5X AMV RT buffer. The speed of the assay was further improved by reducing the betaine concentration from 1 M to 0.4 M in the reactions. Betaine is an amino acid analogue that reduces the melting temperature of nucleic acids and diminishes the influence of base pair composition on thermal melting transitions [50]. Reducing betaine concentrations may improve amplification due to a combination of factors. Betaine has previously been used to improve polymerase-mediated amplification of structured GC-rich templates and to improve PCR specificity [51, 52]. The enzymatic activities of Bst 2.0 DNA polymerase and AMV RT during RT-LAMP may be more efficient at lower betaine concentrations. Similarly, some reports suggest that varying betaine concentrations uniquely impacts RNA tertiary structures (and thus potential availability for reverse transcription) depending on the identity of the RNA as well as the concentration and identity of cations [53].",

The higher LOD of RT-LAMP assays compared to LAMP assays performed using DNA templates is likely due to reductions in the efficiency of reverse transcription [49] in the context of the high temperatures during one-pot RT-LAMP, just as transcription yields are also known to affect the limit of RNA quantitation by real-time PCR [54, 55]. A previous report demonstrated that one-pot RT-LAMP was very inefficient at digital RNA quantitation and generated counts that were only 2% of the expected value [56]. In contrast, digital LAMP assays without RT reflected 62% of the expected DNA concentration. The authors were able to improve their RT-LAMP absolute quantification efficiency from 2% to 23% by using a two-step assay in which reverse transcription was first performed using a more efficient reverse transcriptase, addition of only the BIP primer during reverse transcription, and introduction of RNase H to break up the DNA:RNA hybrids to facilitate primer annealing and subsequent LAMP amplification of the resulting single-stranded cDNA.",

To obtain statistically accurate LOD measurements a series of dilutions containing decreasing numbers of template copies was analyzed in multiple parallel assays. The dilution series included both samples with high template concentrations (that always tested positive) and samples with very few template copies (such that some reactions failed to generate signals above background). At each template concentration the fraction of positive reactions compared to the total number of assays performed was subjected to Probit regression analysis. The number of template copies that could be detected with 95% certainty was considered to be the assay LOD. The fact that we were able to detect smaller numbers of particles than the previously determined RNA LOD would have indicated is likely due to the excess RNA originating from defective interfering particles.",

Similarly, a maximum viral load of 2691 RNA copies/ml in urine was observed on day 13 of infection prior to renal failure, while stool samples contained up to 1031 viral RNA copies/g. One of two oronasal swabs from day 16 of infection contained 5370 copies of viral RNA/ml.

To ensure that neither of these mutations could cause the UpE.9 OSD-RT-LAMP assay to falsely fail, we synthesized two mutated versions of the upE RNA template each bearing one of the single nucleotide changes. In parallel amplification reactions comparing the mutant versus the wildtype upE RNA neither of these mismatches was found to compromise the UpE.9 OSD-RT-LAMP assays (S5 Fig). This observation suggests that our OSD-RT-LAMP assays are extremely robust, especially when used in combination, for accurate MERS-CoV diagnostics. In contrast, the N gene LAMP primer set previously described [57] displayed mismatches to as many as 21 sequences out of the 88 MERS-CoV isolates analyzed in silico, and thus these primers might fail to detect strains bearing additional mutations.",

LAMP reactions have not previously been adapted to POC devices because of background issues relating to spurious amplicon generation and assay variance. The application of OSD probes solves this problem while obviating the need for more complex methods such as the incorporation of modified bases [66]. Employment of the sequence-specific OSD probes not only allows real-time assay validation but also provides the potential advantage of signal integration. For instance, activation of OSD probes can be readily engineered to require concomitant strand displacement by two different target sequences. Combinatorial operation of the three MERS-CoV-specific OSD-RT-LAMP assays may be used to further bolster diagnostic validity. More generally, the OSD-RT-LAMP assays we have developed represent a significant diagnostic advancement, enabling one-pot execution and rapid (30 to 50 min) time-to-result. Furthermore, the well-defined OSD probe design rules and the extreme robustness of the optimized OSD-LAMP and OSD-RT-LAMP methodologies will facilitate quick development of new diagnostic assays designed to detect varied pathogens and nucleic acids.",

Primer design was constrained to include at least a 30 bp gap between the F1 and F2 as well as between the B1 and B2 priming sites. Primer specificity for all the sequenced MERS-CoV isolates and a corresponding lack of significant cross-reactivity to other nucleic acids of human or pathogenic origin was further assessed using NCBI BLAST [68, 69].",
