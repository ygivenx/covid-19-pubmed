This disease is called White Nose Syndrome (WNS) for the white fungal mycelia on the faces and wings of affected bats. Although damage caused by the fungus is restricted to the superficial skin, infected bats clearly show signs of systemic physiological perturbation such as dehydration, hypovolemia and metabolic acidosis [24]. Infected bats arouse from torpor more frequently than uninfected bats [25], [26] possibly leading to emaciation.",

While the site of primary site of fungal infection and occasional secondary bacterial infection was the skin of the wings [25], most of this tissue was needed for histopathology and fungal detection and we were unable to obtain sufficient amounts of RNA from these sites. To test the hypothesis that bats mount a systemic response to infection we examined lungs as an example of an epithelial surface which could have come in contact with aerosolized fungal spores despite being remote from the site of infection or may have responded to infection of peripheral areas [27], [28].",

For mRNAs where such information was not available we designed primers to optimize for annealing temperature and specificity, and to minimize dimer formation. In all cases the veracity of the PCR products was determined by electrophoresis and confirmed by sequencing. Details of primers are in Table 1.",

During hibernation M. lucifugus body temperature is maintained within 1\u20132\u00b0C of ambient temperature for weeks at a time with return to normothermic temperatures during periodic arousal [24], [25]. It is difficult to imagine mammalian gene expression at temperatures this low and it is possible that the genes were transcribed during the arousal periods. Our previous study indicated that P. destructans\u2013infected bats aroused more frequently than uninfected bats [25], a pattern which has also been observed in the wild [26] and this may also have contributed to higher basal levels of gene expression in their cells.

The pulmonary response may have been due to stimulation of the upper respiratory tract by fungal spores. c) There have been suggestions that hibernating mammals show marked leukopenia [20] raising the possibility that circulating leukocytes are sequestered in some organ, possibly the lungs. The infected animals may have responded to inflammation in the wings with an increase in neutrophils, which then migrated to the lungs. d) Lung neutrophils in infected bats, and the accompanying increase in the transcripts of the immune modulators may represent the end of the infectious process in the lungs and the removal of fungal spores and hyphae.

For instance, we have used increase in the stable levels of transcripts for various cytokine genes as a surrogate for increases in their respective proteins. However mRNA and protein levels do not always correlate, largely because of complex regulatory processes that separate transcription of mRNAs from their translation into protein [37]\u2013[39]. In addition, only one of the transcripts, for Cathelicidin, is directly linked to an anti-fungal response. The remainder, IL 23, IL 10 and TNF\u03b1 may be indirectly related or may represent a non-specific response to the stress of infection.",

The horizontal bar represents the mean while the vertical bar indicates standard deviation from the mean. Significance (P), test statistics (t) and degrees of freedom (df) are indicated. A lower value of one (1) \u0394Ct (or Ct) indicates approximately a two-fold higher concentration of RNA. Infected bats as a group had lower \u0394Ct values for the four genes. The histograms represent fold differences between infected and control bats. Only results from reactions that yielded unambiguous results (products of the expected size and sequence, homogenous denaturation profiles, no products for no-template controls) were used for analysis. The number of results that fitted these criteria for each analysis were: IL23 - Control  = 17, Infected  = 13; Cathelicidin \u2013 Control  = 17, Infected  = 28; IL10 \u2013 Control  = 5, Infected  = 6; TNF\u03b1 \u2013 Control  = 5, Infected  = 9.",
