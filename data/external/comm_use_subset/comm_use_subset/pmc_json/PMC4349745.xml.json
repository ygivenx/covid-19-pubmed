            "text": "Interferon inhibits virus infection by inducing the expression of hundreds of host genes, known as Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), some of which encode antiviral effectors [1]. Among these antiviral proteins are a small protein family called interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) proteins. IFITMs have an average length of 130 amino acids, contain two predicted transmembrane domains and a conserved intracellular domain [2,3]. Although IFITM1 was shown to modestly inhibit vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) more than a decade ago [4,5], the antiviral function of IFITM1, 2 and 3 was established only when their potent restriction of influenza A virus, West Nile virus and Dengue virus was reported in a genome-wide functional screen [6]. Subsequent studies revealed that many viruses are susceptible to IFITM restriction. These include flaviviruses (West Nile virus, dengue virus, and yellow fever virus), filoviruses (Marburg virus and Ebola virus), SARS coronavirus, reovirus, Rift Valley fever virus, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV), and others [6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13] (reviewed in[14,15]). The in vivo importance of IFITM proteins in antiviral defense is supported by their protection of mice from influenza A virus infection [16,17,18]. In support of this, single nucleotide polymorphisms in ifitm3 gene have been shown to associate with pathogenesis severity of influenza A virus infection in humans [16,19].",

They are clustered within a 26.5kb region on chromosome 11 except for ifitm10 that is located 1.4 Mb downstream [2,20,21]. IFITM5 has a calcium-binding domain at its C-terminal region and is involved in bone mineralization and maturation [22]. IFITM5 has thus also been named bone restricted ifitm-like protein (Bril). IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3 are expressed in a variety of tissues. Their expression is stimulated by type I and type II interferon due to the presence of the interferon stimulation response element (ISRE) in their promoters [2,23]. In addition to their roles in antiviral defense, IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3 have also been reported to participate in antiproliferative signaling, cell adhesion, and oncogenesis (reviewed in [21]). For instance, expression of these three IFITM members is significantly upregulated in colorectal tumor cells concurrent with the activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway [24]. The function of IFITM10 is unknown except that it is the most conserved among all IFITM proteins across many eukaryotic species [20,25].",

For example, IFITM3 inhibits influenza A virus more potently than inhibits Marburg and Ebola viruses; in contrast, these latter two viruses are strongly inhibited by IFITM1 [11]. Further, IFITM2 and IFITM3, but not IFITM1, inhibit Rift Valley fever virus [7]. This different restriction profile is likely a result of the sequence divergence between IFITM1, 2 and 3. IFITM2 and 3 share higher sequence homology between each other than with IFITM1 [21]. In this study, we report that human IFITM1 differentially affects the replication of two closely related HIV-1 strains BH10 and NL4\u20133 and that the viral envelope glycoprotein is responsible for this differential sensitivity to IFITM1 restriction. Interestingly, deleting the C-terminal sequence of IFITM1 allows the mutant to potently inhibit both BH10 and NL4\u20133 viruses, which highlights the important role of this C-terminal domain in regulating the antiviral function of IFITM1.",

This hypothesis is refuted by the results showing that blocking endocytosis with the dynamin inhibitor dynasore caused relocation of IFITM1 to the plasma membrane, as opposed to a IFITM1-KDEL variant that had the ER retention signal KDEL inserted at the C-terminus and exhibited ER localization even in the presence of dynasore (Fig. 3B).

This prompted us to test whether they would act like C-terminal truncations of human IFITM1 and inhibit HIV-1 entry. The results of Fig. 4B show that mouse IFITM1 suppressed HIV-1 replication in SupT1 cells.

The results showed that exchange of the 2.7kb DNA fragment, located between the SalI and BamH1 restriction sites (called SB fragment), allowed BH(SB) resistant to IFITM1 and, reciprocally, NL(SB) sensitive to IFITM1 inhibition (Fig. 5B). This SB DNA fragment encodes four viral proteins, Tat, Rev, Vpu and Env. To further determine which viral protein plays the countering role, we exchanged between HIV-1BH10 and HIV-1NL4\u20133 only the Env sequence. The results of infection experiments showed that HIV-1NL4\u20133 Env enabled HIV-1BH10 to replicate in IFITM1-expressing cells, whereas inserting the Env of HIV-1BH10 into HIV-1NL4\u20133 dramatically reduced virus replication in the presence of IFITM1 (Fig. 5C), supporting the role of NL4\u20133 Env in overcoming IFITM1 inhibition.

Similar defects were also observed for HIV-1NL4\u20133 infection of IFITM1-expressing SupT1 cells (Fig. 6C and 6D), which indicates that HIV-1NL4\u20133 escapes IFITM1 in the spread infection without the need to restore this decrease in Gag/p24 expression. We recently reported that HIV-1BH10 became resistant to IFITM1 restriction in the spread infection through acquiring mutations in viral Env and Vpu proteins that together enhance the virus transmission between cells [27]. In order to test whether the same mechanism supports the resistance of HIV-1NL4\u20133 to IFITM1, we compared the cell-to-cell transmission efficiency of HIV-1BH10 and HIV-1NL4\u20133. Indeed, HIV-1NL4\u20133 was 3-fold more efficient than HIV-1BH10 in transmitting between SupT1 cells (Fig. 7A). This phenotype was readily reversed when the Env sequence was exchanged between HIV-1BH10 and HIV-1NL4\u20133, either by exchanging the SB fragment or the Env sequence alone (Fig. 7A). Similar observations were made for virus transmission from control SupT1 cells to SupT1 cells expressing IFITM1 (Fig. 7B). Collectively, these data suggest that the Env protein of HIV-1NL4\u20133 mediates greater cell-to-cell transmission, a property that may allow HIV-1 to escape IFITM1 inhibition under the virus spread infection condition.",

Results of mutagenesis and virus replication studies revealed an essential role of viral Env protein in HIV-1NL4\u20133 evasion from IFITM1. Exchanging the Env sequences between BH10 and NL4\u20133 reversed the susceptibility of the parental strains to IFITM1 inhibition. This role of HIV-1 Env protein in determining viral sensitivity to IFITM1 corroborates our recent report showing that HIV-1BH10 was able to develop resistance to IFITM1 through mutating Env and Vpu [27]. There are precedents illuminating the function of viral Env in overcoming host restriction. One example is the HIV-2 Env that antagonizes tetherin [28]. In addition, HIV-1 Env has been shown to regulate the establishment of latent infection in resting CD4+ T cells [29], likely through modulating the functionality of certain cellular pathways [30]. In the case of IFITM1, it remains to determine whether HIV-1 Env serves as the viral target of IFITM1 or Env acts as a viral antagonist to counter IFITM1.",

To our surprise, in spite of being inhibited to similar degrees in the one-round infection assay, only HIV-1BH10, but not HIV-1NL4\u20133, is crippled by IFITM1 in the long-term virus replication assay (Fig. 1). These seemingly conflicting observations could be reconciled by the major difference between the one-round infection and the long-term infection, i.e. the latter infection mode involves virus cell-to-cell transmission that actually dominates HIV-1 transmission over infection by free virus particles [31]. It is thus possible that the superiority of HIV-1NL4\u20133 over HIV-1BH10 in replicating in IFITM1-expression SupT1 cells, despite that both viruses are equally impaired by IFITM1 in the one-round infection, might be a result of the greater ability of HIV-1NL4\u20133 to transmit between cells. Indeed, we found that HIV-1NL4\u20133 was 3-fold more efficient in transmission from cell to cell than HIV-1BH10. HIV-1NL4\u20133 has therefore utilized its strong cell-to-cell transmission to compensate for the deficiency in virus production caused by IFITM1.",

Inserting the Env sequence of HIV-1BH10 into HIV-1NL4\u20133 diminishes cell-to-cell transmission of the parental virus. Reciprocally, HIV-1NL4\u20133 Env protein increases cell-to-cell transmission of HIV-1BH10 by 3-fold. Concurrent with the change in cell-to-cell transmission, this exchange in Env sequences also switches the sensitivity of HIV-1BH10 and HIV-1NL4\u20133 to human IFITM1. One possible scenario is that HIV-1 Env protein may modulate virus sensitivity to human IFITM1 restriction by virtue of its ability to mediate and regulate virus cell-to-cell transmission. The Env sequences of HIV-1BH10 and HIV-1NL4\u20133 differ at 23 amino acid positions. Changing each of these 23 amino acids in HIV-1BH10 Env to the counterpart in HIV-1NL4\u20133 did not increase the resistance of HIV-1BH10 to human IFITM1 (data not shown). It can be conceived that two or more of these 23 amino acids in Env are required to generate resistance to IFITM1.",

            "text": "Human IFITM1 does not affect the entry of either HIV-1BH10 or HIV-1NL4\u20133 (Fig. 2) [10]. Interestingly, IFITM1 gains the ability to inhibit HIV-1 entry when its C-terminal sequence is truncated (Fig. 2). In agreement with this observation, C-terminal truncation enhances the ability of IFITM1 to promote the infection of Coronavirus OC43 [32]. This gained function appears to be virus specific, since the truncated IFITM1 does not affect virus entry mediated by VSV G protein (Fig. 2). One possible explanation of this differential inhibition is that HIV-1 and VSV adopt different pathways for entry. HIV-1 entry is pH-independent and occurs at the plasma membrane, whereas VSV enters cells in the endosomes of low pH [33,34]. In support of this scenario, removal of the last 9 amino acids from the C-terminus of human IFITM1 relocates this protein from intracellular sites to cell periphery (Fig. 3). This cellular location-dependent inhibition phenomenon was previously reported for IFITM3. Deleting the endocytic sorting signal 20-YEML-23 in IFITM3 led to redistribution of IFITM3 to the plasma membrane and the consequent loss of inhibition of influenza A virus entry that takes place at late endosomes [35,36,37,38]. In addition to the regulation by their own sequences, subcellular distribution of IFITMs can also be modulated by other factors. For example, compared to its intracellular localization in 293T cells as shown in this study, the exogenous IFITM1 has been observed at the plasma membrane in A549 cells [39]. In addition to the cell type-dependent effect, other factors including expression levels and treatment with interferon may also affect where IFITM proteins are localized in cells.",

One mechanism by which extracellular/luminal protein domain regulates protein subcellular localization is the ER-luminal retention signal [26]. Our data rule out the presence of ER-luminal retention signal within the C-terminal region of IFITM1, because inhibiting endocytosis with the dynamin inhibitor dynasore redistributes IFITM1 to the plasma membrane, but the same treatment fails to do so to an IFITM1 variant with the exogenous ER retention signal inserted at the C-terminus (Fig. 3B). Alternatively, deleting the C-terminal sequence may change the membrane topology of IFITM1 and, as a result, disturb its subcellular localization.",

We suspect that the chance of finding human IFITM1-sensitive HIV-1 strains, either lab-adapted or naturally-existing or circulating, would be low if IFITM1 exerts selection pressure in vivo on HIV-1 replication. Since both HIV-1BH10 and HIV-1NL4\u20133 are strains that have been propagated in cultured human T cell lines, they have adapted to the in vitro culture conditions and as a result, they could have lost the original viral sequences that confer resistance to IFITM1, which may have happened to HIV-1BH10. We envision that since HIV-1 has never encountered mouse IFITM1, most, if not all, of the HIV-1 strains would be sensitive to the mouse IFITM1 inhibition.
