Tat and Rev are similar in size; Tat is typically 101 amino acids long and Rev is typically 116 amino acids long, and both have RNA binding domains composed of arginine and, in the case of Tat, lysine residues which bind to different HIV-1 RNA stem loop structures. Tat binds to an RNA structure in the 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of all viral transcripts called the Trans-Activation Response element (TAR), while Rev binds to an intronic region retained by incompletely spliced transcripts called the Rev Response Element (RRE). The RNA binding domains of both proteins also function as a nuclear/nucleolar localization signal (NLS/NoLS), although recent evidence implies that Tat may passively enter the nucleus by diffusing through nuclear pores [2]. Both proteins are localized primarily in the nucleus; Tat is observed throughout the nucleoplasm with nucleolar accumulation, whereas the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling Rev concentrates in the nucleolus in addition to localizing to the nucleoplasm and, to a lesser extent, to the cytoplasm.",

            "text": "Trafficking of Rev in cells has been studied extensively (Fig. 1) [3], [4]. In the nucleolus, Rev promotes the nuclear export of various HIV-1 mRNAs by directly binding to singly-spliced and unspliced viral transcripts via the RRE contained therein (Fig. 1, step 1). Exportin 1 (also called CRM1 and XPO1) binds to Rev through a nuclear export signal (NES; HIV-1NL4-3 Rev amino acids 73 to 84, LQLPPLERLTLD) [5], [6], [7], which leads to colocalization of Rev and CRM1 in the nucleolus and subsequent export of the Rev:mRNA complex from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Fig. 1, step 2). Many other cellular proteins can contribute to Rev nuclear export, including hRIP/Rab, eIF5A, DDX3, DDX1, RNA helicase A, and PIMT that act through Rev, and Matrin 3 and Sam68 that bind to viral mRNA [3], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. The Rev:mRNA complex disassembles in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1, step 3) allowing Rev to recycle back to the nucleus using the transportin 1 or importin \u03b2 nuclear import pathways (Fig. 1, step 4) [3]. Once Rev enters the nucleus, nucleophosmin (B23) facilitates transport of Rev to the nucleolus (Fig. 1, step 5) [13]. B23 is reported to be necessary for the nucleolar localization of both Rev and Tat through interaction with their respective basic domains [13], [14], [15], [16], [17].",

Nullbasic was created by replacing the entire arginine-rich RNA binding domain of wild type Tat with glycine and alanine residues. Like similarly mutated one-exon Tat mutants, Nullbasic exhibits transdominant negative effects on Tat-dependent HIV-1 gene expression [18]. However, unlike previously reported mutants [19], [20], [21], Nullbasic also effectively suppresses the steady state levels of unspliced and singly-spliced viral mRNA, an activity caused by the inhibition of HIV-1 Rev activity [18]. The inhibition by Nullbasic was attributed, in part, to a subcellular redistribution of Rev from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm, but precisely how Nullbasic mediates this effect is unknown.",

The plasmid consists of a pGEM7z (-) (Promega) backbone containing the CMV promoter fused so that the transcription initiation site uses the correct HIV-1+1 position. With respect to the HIV-1 transcription start site, HIV-1 sequences +1 to +933 from the HIV-1 pNL4-3 proviral plasmid (obtained from the ADIS Research and Reference Reagent Program, plasmid #114) were inserted into the pGEM7z (-) via MluI and SphI restriction enzymes sites and +934 to +9251 from the HIV-1 pNL4-3 were inserted into the pGEM7z (-) via SphI and XbaI restriction enzymes sites. The HIV-eGFP expression plasmid was engineered by inserting an eGFP sequence from pcDNA3.1-eGFP into the HIV-1 nef gene in pGCH proviral expression vector through BamHI and XbaI restriction enzyme sites. The expression vector encoding Nullbasic-mCherry was generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of mCherry from pmCherry-LacRep (obtained from Addgene, plasmid #18985), which was then inserted into the Nullbasic-FLAG plasmid via BsrGI and XhoI restriction enzyme sites.",

To investigate whether Nullbasic is able to alter Rev\u2019s subcellular localization in the context of HIV-1, we visualized the subcellular distribution of Rev derived from HIV-1 provirus in the presence or absence of Nullbasic. To overcome transcriptional inhibition caused by Nullbasic [18], we utilized a CMV-driven HIV-1 proviral plasmid, pGCH, which expresses viral factors independent of Tat. The plasmid also has the eGFP gene inserted into the nef reading frame (here called HIV-eGFP) to enable visualization of HIV expression in cells. HIV-eGFP was transfected into HeLa cells with or without FLAG-tagged Nullbasic fused to the mCherry fluorescent reporter protein (Nullbasic-mCherry). We noted strong nuclear accumulation of Nullbasic-mCherry compared to a previous study [18], whereas one exon Tat proteins with basic domain mutation were also shown to predominantly localized in the cytoplasm [20], [23], [24]. Further comparison of Nullbasic localization in HeLa cells showed that Nullbasic fused to FLAG (Fig. S1, rows 3 and 5) or mCherry (Fig. 2A, row 2) had very similar patterns of distribution in the nucleus and cytoplasm. The localization of Rev was determined by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using an anti-Rev antibody 24 h post-transfection. As expected, Myc epitope-tagged Rev (Myc-Rev) expressed alone was prominent in the nucleolus and the nucleoplasm but to a lesser extent (Fig. 2A, row 1). When Rev was expressed by HIV-eGFP, it was distributed throughout the nucleus (Fig. 2B, row 1). This nuclear distribution of Rev is consistent with its role in nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of viral mRNA [3], [25]. Coexpression of HIV-eGFP and Nullbasic-mCherry resulted in the distinct redistribution of Rev to the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm (Fig. 2B, row2), comparable to the subcellular redistribution of Myc-Rev by Nullbasic-mCherry (Fig. 2A, row2). Although Nullbasic was shown to inhibit Rev-mediated viral mRNA transport leading to limited expression of viral proteins from unspliced or singly spliced viral mRNA [18], these data indicate that Nullbasic-induced redistribution of Rev is independent of other HIV-1 factors under these experimental conditions.",

Immunoprecipitation of wild type Tat-FLAG with anti-FLAG beads did not co-immunoprecipitate Myc-Rev (Fig. 2C) but did, as expected, co-immunoprecipitate endogenous CDK9, a member of the pTEF-b protein complex that interacts with the Tat activation domain [29]. Similarly, Nullbasic-FLAG did not show evidence of co-immunoprecipitation of Myc-Rev but did with CDK9 (Fig. 2C). The latter interaction is most likely similar to the interaction between wild type Tat and CDK9, through the activation domain preserved in Nullbasic-FLAG. These experiments imply that a Nullbasic:Rev interaction is not likely to be responsible for the observed mislocalization of Rev.",

In control cells transfected with the parental pcDNA3.1 plasmid, CRM1 was observed widely throughout the nucleus and along the nuclear membrane (Fig. 3, row 1). As previously observed [28], [30], [31], Myc-Rev expression induced CRM1 relocalization and prominent colocalization of Rev and CRM1 in nucleoli (Fig. 3, row 2). This colocalization could be reversed by treating cells with leptomycin B (LMB), a specific CRM1 inhibitor that directly binds to and inactivates CRM1 [32], thereby preventing its interaction with Rev (Fig. 3, row 3). Expression of Nullbasic alone had no apparent effect on CRM1 distribution (Fig. 3, row 4). Colocalization between Rev and CRM1 could also be partially disrupted by the expression of Nullbasic-mCherry, in the presence of which Myc-Rev, but not CRM1, redistributed to the cytoplasm (Fig. 3, row 5). Importantly, treatment of Myc-Rev and Nullbasic-mCherry expressing cells with LMB resulted in the complete restoration of Myc-Rev nucleolar accumulation (Fig. 3, row 6), suggesting that Nullbasic requires functional CRM1 to mislocalize Rev most likely by an indirect interaction.",

As reported for RevM10 [17], [34], Myc-RevM10 (Fig. 4, row 1) was unable to interact and colocalize with CRM1 in the nucleolus. Interestingly, coexpression of Nullbasic-mCherry had no disruptive effect on the nucleolar localization of Myc-RevM10 since, unlike wild type Myc-Rev, no redistribution to the cytoplasm was observed (Fig. 4, row 2). We thus conclude that an intact Rev:CRM1 interaction is required for Nullbasic to relocalize Rev to the cytoplasm.",

Mutant Tat proteins lacking a basic domain, like Nullbasic, have been reported not to interact with B23 in vitro\n[14]. As previously observed, Myc-Rev colocalized with B23 in nucleolar structures (Fig. 5, row 1). While expression of Nullbasic-mCherry alone had no apparent effect on B23 nuclear distribution (Fig. 5, row 2), coexpression of Myc-Rev with Nullbasic-mCherry resulted in the strong redistribution of both Myc-Rev and B23 throughout the nucleus, and the observation of Myc-Rev in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5, row 3). Since B23 is known to strongly bind to Rev [13], it is likely that the redistribution of B23 by Nullbasic is Rev-dependent.",

To determine if Nullbasic can generally disrupt nucleolar composition, we monitored the localization of C23 and fibrillarin, two nucleolar proteins that have not been reported to interact with Rev. Both C23 and fibrillarin colocalized with Myc-Rev within the nucleoli of transfected cells (Fig. 6, rows 1 and 4, respectively). While expression of Nullbasic-mCherry alone had no apparent effect on the nucleolar localization of either protein (Fig. 6, rows 2 and 5), coexpression of Nullbasic-mCherry with Myc-Rev induced relocalization of C23 but not fibrillarin from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm, in a manner concomitant with the redistribution of Myc-Rev (Fig. 6, rows 3 and 6, respectively). We therefore conclude that Nullbasic does not cause a generalized mislocalization of nucleolar proteins, but effects the relocalization of only certain, specific proteins (including CRM1, B23 and C23) in a manner dependent on the presence of Rev.",

In HeLa cells, for example, transportin 1 is the dominant Rev nuclear import pathway [22], [40], while the importin \u03b2 pathway is favored in HEK293T cells [40]. To eliminate the possibility that Nullbasic-mediated blockade of a nuclear import pathway leads to the observed cytoplasmic accumulation of Rev, two NLS-containing reporters, GFP2-cNLS and GFP2-M9core, which mimic cargo for nuclear import by importin \u03b2 and transportin 1 respectively, were expressed individually or along with Nullbasic-mCherry in HeLa cells. As shown in figure 7, there was no change in the nuclear accumulation of either reporter in the presence of Nullbasic-mCherry (Fig. 7, rows 2 and 4) compared to in its absence (Fig. 7, rows 1 and 3). Nullbasic-mCherry did not affect localization of GFP2 lacking a nuclear import signal (Fig. 7, rows 5 and 6). Similar experiments indicated that coexpression of Myc-Rev with Nullbasic-mCherry likewise had no effect on the nuclear localizations of the respective reporters (data not shown). While we cannot exclude interference of other pathways, we conclude that the accumulation of Rev in the cytoplasm induced by Nullbasic is not caused by a general inhibition of the importin \u03b2 and transportin 1 nuclear import pathways.",
