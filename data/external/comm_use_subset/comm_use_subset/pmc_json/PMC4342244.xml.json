A study of Sudan EBOV infection in humans showed that IFN\u03b1 levels are significantly higher in surviving patients than those with fatal EBOV infection, who had higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines such as IL-6, and MIP-1\u03b2 [16, 17]. High IFN\u03b1 production is reported to correlate with increased resistance against EBOV in mice as well [18]. Administration of recombinant IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b2 confers delayed time-to-death in NHPs [19, 20]. Furthermore, IFN\u03b1, used as an adjunct therapy for monoclonal antibody treatment, is shown to enhance protection in NHPs [21]. EBOV infection remains a potential threat to public health, which is compounded with the lack of effective prevention or treatment. To overcome this problem, various vaccine candidates have been developed, including various DNA constructs, recombinant viruses, VLPs, as well as treatment with anti-sense siRNA [22\u201324].",

            "text": "VLPs are subunit-based vaccines, extensively studied for a variety of infectious pathogens [25, 26]. VLPs prepared from EBOV and other filoviruses are composed of the matrix protein (VP40), glycoprotein (GP), and at times nucleoprotein (NP) and represent a potentially promising candidate for EBOV vaccine. EBOV VLPs have been shown to confer protection upon rodents and NHPs when given prior to infection [27\u201329]. In the accompanying paper, we show that post-exposure administration of trivalent VLPs protects mice from lethal EBOV infection, further crediting the potential of VLPs as a possible vaccine [30]. In that study, we show that VLP protection requires macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs) as well as B and either CD4 or CD8 T lymphocytes, indicating that both innate and adaptive immunity are involved in conferring protection. The aim of this study was to further investigate molecular bases of post-exposure protection by VLPs. Based on our previous report that VLPs stimulate type I IFN expression in DCs and macrophages, in vitro, we focused on the role of type I IFN signaling, and found that post-exposure VLP treatment leads to accelerated activation of IFN signaling, resulting in early induction of ISGs. Significantly, VLP stimulated ISG induction coincided with the attenuation of proinflammatory cytokine surge in EBOV infected mice. The reduced inflammatory responses was attributed to activation of type I IFN signaling, since VLP treated Ifnar\n-/- mice were unable to inhibit not only viral replication but proinflammatory responses, and succumbed to death. Our results indicate that early type I IFN response is a major mechanism that contributes to VLP mediated protection against EBOV infection.",

QRT-PCR analysis in Fig. 1B and 1C, found that levels of GP mRNA rose sharply in Ifnar\n-/- mice on day 2 of infection when GP mRNA was still at background in WT mice. Ifnar\n-/- mice that received VLPs also expressed considerable amounts of GP mRNA, although levels varied between liver and spleen in the VLP treated group. Thus, EBOV appeared to replicate faster and to a greater extent in Ifnar\n-/- mice than WT mice. It should be noted here that in WT mice, GP mRNA levels began to increase rapidly after day 2, peaking on day 3 to day 5, and that VLP injection inhibited GP mRNA expression by more than half (S1 Fig.).",

On the other hand, it has been recently shown that Adenovirus based vaccine can protect Ifnar\n-/- mice from lethal EVOB infection presumably through antibody responses, which indicates that Ifnar\n-/- mice are not universally vulnerable, and anti-EBOV resistance can be attained in some cases [35].",

ISGs encoding anti-viral proteins were first examined, as they may provide early protection against EBOV infection. Upper panels in Fig. 2A and 2B compare induction of anti-viral ISGs, Ifit1, Mx1, Oas1a and Stat1 with or without VLP injection in liver and spleen. In this early stage, levels of these ISGs were consistently higher in the VLP-injected groups than those without VLPs. At later stages of infection, however, the situation reversed, in that mice without VLPs had higher levels of ISGs, as seen on day 3 (S1 Fig. for complete kinetics).

This question was of interest to us, since mice that did not receive VLPs expressed higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which raised the possibility that IFN signaling exerts negative regulatory activity towards proinflammatory responses, perhaps by controlling NF-\u03baB activation [36]. Shown in the lower panels in Fig. 2A and 2B is induction of IRGM1, USP18, TRIM21 and TRIM30. IRGM1 is an IFN inducible GTPase that inhibits LPS induced endotoxin shock in mice [37]. USP18 is an ISG15 deconjugating factor that negatively regulates TLR signaling and resultant cytokine induction [38]. Trim21 and Trim30 are members of the Tripartite motif family that downregulate TLR induced inflammatory responses [39\u201342]. Expression of these ISGs was also higher in the VLP injected group than that without VLPs both in liver and spleen. Similar to anti-viral ISGs, expression of these negative regulatory factors changed at the later stage (S1 Fig). These data indicate that VLPs accelerate induction of anti-viral and negative regulatory ISGs, which may help suppress EBOV\u2019s anti-IFN antagonism (See Discussion).",

            "text": "To further define pathways downstream of IFNAR activity, important for VLP protection, we directed our attention on IRF8, a transcription factor expressed in macrophages and DCs [47\u201349]. IRF8 is induced by IFNs and TLR ligands in a Stat1 dependent manner, and plays a pivotal role in facilitating innate immune responses. Although IRF8 is not involved in initial triggering of type I IFN induction, it amplifies IFN transcription in DCs and macrophages [50]. IRF8 promotes induction of multiple anti-microbial factors and is required for innate resistance against a variety of pathogens [50\u201352]. IRF8 stimulates expression of MHC and costimulatory molecules to boost antigen presentation [48, 50]. We thus tested whether IRF8 disruption affects VLP-mediated protection against EBOV. Survival data in Fig. 6A show that approximately 80% of Irf8\n-/- mice that received VLPs died between day 6 and 8, which is nearly identical to the mortality curve of WT mice without VLPs. As expected, the majority of WT mice that received VLPs survived against EBOV infection. It is of note that Ifnar\n-/- mice died 1 to 2 days earlier than Irf8\n-/- mice, which may be attributed to the difference in the mouse background. Correlating with the lack of protection, Ebola GP mRNA levels were much higher in EBOV infected Irf8\n-/- mice than Irf8\n+/+ mice with or without VLPs (Fig. 6B). We next examined whether induction of anti-viral and negative feedback ISGs is dependent on IRF8. Data in Fig. 6C illustrate that induction of these ISGs was very meager in Irf8\n-/- mice, in contrast to robust induction in Irf8\n+/+ mice. Importantly, VLPs did not rescue ISG induction in Irf8\n-/- mice. Results were similar in liver and spleens (Fig. 6C and S4 Fig). These results indicate that VLPs, upon initial activation of type I IFN cascade, rely subsequently on the activation of downstream pathways represented by IRF8 to confer protection against EBOV.",

This conclusion is supported by the observation that post-exposure VLP treatment accelerated ISG induction in EBOV infected mice, leading to reduced viral replication and inflammatory gene expression. Further supporting the critical role of type I IFN signaling in the protection, VLPs did not induce ISGs in Ifnar\n-/- mice, and did not protect the mice from lethal EBOV infection. These results are consistent with the report that post-exposure IFN\u03b2 or IFN\u03b1 treatment increases protection against EBOV infection in NHPs [1, 6, 15, 19].",

Contouring this notion however, it is of note that Ifnar\n-/- mice can be protected against EBOV by an adenovirus-based vaccine, indicating that Ifnar\n-/- mice are not totally without defense [35]. Rather, it is possible that Ifnar\n-/- mice are not protected by VLPs that rely on ISG induction for protection, whereas they are protected by the adenovirus vaccine that depends on antibody response.",

Although the question of which anti-viral ISGs are effective in inhibiting EBOV replication awaits further research, it is anticipated that some of anti-viral ISGs induced by VLPs may interfere with EBOV life cycle [53]. What is the significance of accelerated IFN response in VLP mediated protection? Available evidence suggests that VLPs may overcome EBOV\u2019s anti-IFN antagonism. The virally encoded VP24 and VP35 disable the entire IFN system in the host; while VP24 blocks the JAK/STAT pathway of IFN signaling, VP35, an EBOV virulence factor, inhibits type I IFN induction in many cell types [6, 7, 9, 11]. We previously showed that VP35 inhibits type I IFN induction in murine DCs by premature SUMOylation and inactivation of IRF7 [10]. It is thought that VP24 and VP35 have a decisive effect on the subsequent host resistance, since abated IFN signaling would impair proper innate immune responses, leading to deficiency in DC maturation, defective antigen presentation and aberrant inflammation. Compromised innate immunity would consequently undermine development of adaptive immunity [6] (See a model in Fig. 7).",

The delayed ISG induction in EBOV infected mice is reminiscent of the reports showing that influenza virus delays ISG induction in lung epithelial cells through NS1, an influenza anti-IFN protein that is linked to disease pathology [54, 55]. An influenza virus strain deficient in NS1 is shown to induce ISGs earlier than wild type virus, although the wild type strain does stimulate ISGs later on [54, 55]. Supporting the view that viral anti-IFN factors stall ISG induction, rather than completely abrogate the induction, we also observed ISG induction on Day 3 and later in mice without VLPs. It may be envisaged that VLPs trigger IFN activation early on, thereby eluding the activity of the EBOV anti-IFN proteins (a model in Fig. 7).",

IRGM1, induced by IFN signaling restricts LPS induced endotoxin shock without limiting IFN\u03b2 expression [37]. TRIM21 and TRIM30 inhibit proinflammatory cytokine induction, at least in part by interfering with the NF-\u03baB dependent arm of transcription [39\u201341]. In addition, these factors may act by post-transcriptional mechanisms, affecting inflammasome activation [42]. In this regard, Guarda et al. [45] reported that type I IFNs inhibit production of IL-1 by inhibiting activity of the NLRP1 and NLRP3 inflammasomes and by IL-10 induction. Thus, ISGs with negative regulatory activity may preferentially attenuate proinflammatory pathways, while sparing IFN induction pathways. Given our earlier observations that VP35 does not grossly affect NF-\u03baB activation, while strongly inhibiting type I IFN activation, EBOV may promote proinflammatory pathways at least in part through VP35 [10].",

It also inhibits prompt induction of negative regulatory ISGs that leads to exaggerated inflammatory responses. As a result, adaptive immunity is not adequately induced. Bottom: VLPs trigger timely induction of type I IFNs and ISGs by overcoming EBOV\u2019s anti-IFN antagonism.
