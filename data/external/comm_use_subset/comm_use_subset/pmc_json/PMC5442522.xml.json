            "text": "Despite considerable advancements in the characterization of genetic sequence data afforded by next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, significant limitations in applying them to the veterinary diagnostic setting remain. NGS can fail to detect low-copy-number pathogens in complex biological samples due to low pathogen/host nucleic acid ratios. For example, if 10% of mammalian cells (approximately 3 \u00d7 109 bp per cell) in a blood sample are infected with a pathogen with a 10-kb genome, only 0.000033% of sequences in an NGS output file will be of pathogen origin. Additionally, pathogens isolated from clinical samples often have poor or only partially characterized genomes, can exist as genetically diverse populations within a single individual, or may be present in low abundance due to latency or stage of infection. This combination of small genome size, low relative copy number, and heterogeneous genomic content complicates pathogen detection from complex samples in the context of NGS diagnostic capabilities. For these reasons, virus isolation or culture methods for bacteria and fungi are often required prior to NGS to increase the proportion of on-target reads from clinical samples. These limitations prevent the adoption of NGS as a standard workflow in veterinary diagnostic laboratories.",

Whole DNA extracts (or cDNA converted from RNA) is mixed with predesigned oligonucleotide probes under conditions that maximize hybridization to genetically similar sequences in the extract. Nontarget DNA does not bind to the probes and is subsequently removed, whereas DNA bound to the probes is eluted to achieve a higher concentration of target nucleic acids than was present in the original sample. Targeted genome capture has been used to enrich nucleic acids of interest from complex biological samples. Examples include the concentration of Wolbachia DNA (an intracellular bacteria) from whole-insect DNA extracts (2) and the enrichment of Yersinia pestis DNA from Black Death victims (3). Additionally, TGC has been recently used by Wylie et al. to demonstrate potential uses in detecting multiple viral taxa from human clinical cases, which represents an important step in adapting TGC technology for diagnostics or pathogen discovery in human samples (4).",

We screened diverse sample types, including tissue culture fluids, blood, plasma, and swabs previously characterized for multiple pathogens using standard PCR or serological assays. Because some pathogens are common across feline species while others are species specific, we were able to evaluate the performance of these assays across several pathogen-host relationships. We designed two custom probe libraries to evaluate the ability of TGC-NGS to detect DNA and RNA from 10 viral and 1 bacterial taxa. The samples analyzed were derived from in vitro and in vivo sources covering a range of pathogen-to-host genomic ratios, from very low to very high. A bioinformatics pipeline was developed to identify host and pathogen sequences from the NGS output. Assay parameters were varied to assess the impact of probe concentration on enrichment efficiency, and unenriched libraries were analyzed by NGS to qualitatively assess the sensitivity of the NGS pipeline in detecting the presence of pathogens without enrichment.",

The enrichment of target nucleic acids achieved by TGC ranged from 58-fold to a remarkable 56 million-fold. Subsequent analysis of tissues from cats with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection documented 5 logs of enrichment that occurred at the TGC processing step. Both DNA and RNA pathogens were detected in this study, although this method was more readily applied to the detection of DNA genomes. We observed poor performance of the assay under the following conditions: (i) samples with low pathogen loads, (ii) poorly preserved samples, or (iii) when pathogens lacked significant homology to probe sequences. We conclude that this approach to detecting and characterizing diverse pathogens from biological samples is a powerful and effective methodology with practical applications in veterinary clinical microbiology. Further side-by-side evaluations with clinical samples will be necessary to fully develop this method for high-throughput diagnostic use.",

We also demonstrated that hybridization to targeted capture probes can enrich pathogen nucleic acids up to 56 million-fold relative to host genes and that full genome sequences were retrieved from both clinical and experimental samples from three different host species. A significant number of pathogens were identified that were not readily detected using more traditional veterinary diagnostic technologies, and we documented that bioinformatics analysis alone was not sufficient to detect pathogens from unenriched samples. We identified the limitations of this technology related to very low starting pathogen concentrations and poor sample quality. Optimizing capture probes and implementing stringent quality control measures prior to NGS could enhance the utility of this technology for large-scale diagnostic use. We also recognize that while promising, NGS-based assays such as those described here require more investigation before they can be used in place of traditional diagnostic procedures, and therefore we recommend that laboratories adopting NGS-based assays do so alongside traditional methods until protocols are fully validated.",

The TGC-NGS approach could also be modified for specific research or clinical applications. For example, the number of probes per target pathogen could be increased if the goal is to investigate genetic diversity or rare genetic variants among a small set of pathogens. This may improve the capture efficiency and sequencing depth for each pathogen, enabling analyses into, for example, molecular evolution and intrahost diversity. Alternatively, by targeting only conserved regions of pathogens, instead of full-length genomes, more target pathogens could be included in a single capture probe library, as suggested by others (4).

Like the alignment of reads to Felis catus, the same analytics were used to postprocess the alignments to each pathogen in the database.

This was likely the result of spurious mapping of nonpathogen reads in BWA and contamination during DNA/cDNA library preparation, similar to results recently reported by Wylie et al. (4). To differentiate true pathogen reads from false-positive reads, we calculated a \u201cpositive threshold value\u201d by using the number of reads that aligned to pathogen reference sequences in the negative-control samples. The positive threshold value was set at 100 times the proportion of total reads that mapped to each pathogen taxa in the negative-control samples. Thus, a positive threshold value was calculated for each pathogen taxa in each (DNA and RNA) experiment. A sample was considered positive for a given pathogen taxon if the proportion of reads that mapped to the pathogen reference sequences exceeded the positive threshold value for that taxon.",
