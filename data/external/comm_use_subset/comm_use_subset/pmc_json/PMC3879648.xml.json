A facemask is a loose fitting disposable device covering the wearer\u2019s nose and mouth and acts as a physical barrier to potential contaminants in the immediate environment but can have limited effectiveness in blocking small particles. There is little proven benefit in the sole use of facemask (without hand washing) to prevent healthcare personnel from contracting infections in randomized control trials [1-3], with research conducted during the SARS outbreak suggesting a potential negative impact of infection precaution measures including mask wearing, on the domain of doctors\u2019 empathy of a patient satisfaction questionnaire [4].",

It has been shown that nonverbal communication is important for the therapeutic relationship [11] and is related to patients\u2019 adherence to medical advice and medication compliance, patient satisfaction and positive clinical outcomes [12-16]. The importance of emotional perception, expression and reciprocity in non verbal communication was postulated to impact the outcome of the doctor-patient interaction [11]. Studies in non clinical contexts have shown that subliminal facial expressions can influence the viewer\u2019s emotional state, attitudes and subsequent behaviours [17,18]. However, only a few studies have looked at the influence of facial expressions on patient health outcomes [14,19]; eye contact was a strong predictor of a positively rated doctor patient interaction [19], whilst doctors\u2019 distancing behaviour, such as not smiling and looking away was perceived negatively by patients [14]. During hospital admissions, facial expressiveness (such as smiling, nodding, frowning) of physical therapists were associated with an improvement in ability to perform activities of daily living and also a decrease in confusion for elderly patients [14].",

Studies have demonstrated the impact of doctors\u2019 empathy and patient centred care on patient enablement [22] and health outcomes [6,23] in both chronic and acute conditions [24-27]. In this study, a randomized control trial was conducted to explore the effects of facemask wearing among primary care doctors in Hong Kong on patients\u2019 perception of the doctors\u2019 empathy. We hypothesized that patients who consulted mask wearing doctors would report lower scores in doctors\u2019 empathy when compared to non mask wearing doctors, due to physical obstruction of facial expressions and the subsequent impact on the perceived empathic response. We also explored the effects of facemask wearing on patient enablement and patient satisfaction. In addition, we hypothesized that the effect of facemask wearing is minimal when the patient knows the doctor well and there is an established therapeutic rapport.",

[27-29] which has undergone extensive validation. The Chinese version of the CARE measure has been found to be a reliable and valid tool to assess patient-rated empathy of doctors during consultation [30,31] and have been shown to be able to effectively differentiate between doctors in terms of patient-rated empathy [30]. Patients rated the ten questions in the CARE measures with score of 1 for 'poor\u2019 and 5 for 'excellent\u2019 to the questions, such as 'How was the doctor at making you feel at ease (item 1)\u2019. The total CARE is calculated as an average mean item score multiplied by 10 (and can range from 10 to 50) [31]. Secondary outcome measures were: 1) patient satisfaction, in which patients rated their overall satisfaction with the doctor-patient interaction on a 7-point likert scale (1 = worst, 7 = excellent); 2) patient enablement, by use of the six-item patient enablement instrument (PEI) which measured the impact of patient doctor encounter on the patient\u2019s ability to cope with and understand his/her illness [32] of which the Chinese version has been shown to have good validity and reliability [33]. Rating is on a 3-point scale (same or less/better/much better) and scored as 0, 1, 2. Total PEI score is calculated by the average of the scores of the applicable items multiplied by six [31]. Cases that had more than three 'non applicable\u2019 items were excluded [33]. Thus total PEI score ranges from the lowest 0 score to the highest 12 score.",
