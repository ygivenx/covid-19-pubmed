Routine cultures may aid in determining infectious etiology but their utility can be limited by lengthy time to result, low yield, and contamination [4]. Molecular testing expands our capability to detect specific pathogens; yet, test interpretation can be confounded by pathogen co-infections and significant carriage rates of potentially pathogenic microorganisms, such that molecular tests may contribute to over and under diagnosis [5]. Notably, pathogen-based tests are inherently limited by requirement to sample the infection focus, which is especially challenging in lower respiratory infections and fever without source. Therefore, there is pressing need for new reliable and rapid testing to aid the clinician in discriminating between bacterial and viral infections.",

Multiple candidates have been documented, including traditional cellular markers (e.g., white blood cell count, WBC [2] and absolute neutrophil count, ANC [8]) and soluble host-proteins, both classical (e.g., interleukin-6, IL-6 [9]; C-reactive protein, CRP [2, 10\u201312]; and procalcitonin, PCT [2, 10, 12\u201314]) and others (e.g., human neutrophil lipocalin, HNL/NGAL [15]). There are also panels of host nucleic acids in the early stages of development [16\u201318]. Additionally, various prediction models have been proposed that combined several markers, for example, the Lab-score, which integrates PCT, CRP, and urinary dipstick results [19]. To date, wide adoption of such biomarkers and prediction rules for discriminating between bacterial and viral infections has been limited by one or more of the following: lack of rigorous clinical validation [7], narrow applicability (to certain settings, populations, or clinical syndromes) [20], disputed cutoffs [21], and not enough added value beyond standard-of-care [22\u201324].",

This is the first diagnostic test based on soluble host-proteins to include both viral- and bacterial-induced biomarkers: tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), which exhibits induced expression in viral infections and reduced expression in bacterial infection; interferon gamma-induced protein-10 (IP-10) that is induced to a greater extent in viral infections and lesser extent in bacterial infections; and CRP, which exhibits the opposite pattern to IP-10. The diagnostic performance has been validated in two double-blind studies [27, 28], with sensitivity 86.7% (95% confidence interval 75.8\u201393.1%) and 93.8% (95% CI 87.8\u201399.8%) and specificity 91.1% (95% CI 87.9\u201393.6%) and 89.8% (95% CI 85.6\u201394.0%), respectively. In these former studies, a head-to-head comparison of its diagnostic performance with other biomarkers (at multiple cutoffs) and prediction rules was lacking in patients with respiratory infection (both upper and lower) and fever without source.",

Prediction rules combining biomarkers at different cutoffs were defined based on the relevant literature prior to data analysis [19, 34, 35].

The signature exhibited the highest total accuracy (94.0% [95% CI 91.2\u201396.8%]), with sensitivity of 93.5% (95% CI 89.1\u201397.9%) and specificity of 94.3% (95% CI 90.7\u201398.0%), the only diagnostic test to show promising utility both for ruling-in and ruling-out bacterial infections.

In particular, even in cases of adenovirus infection, which can trigger bacterial-like responses leading to misdiagnosis as bacterial infection [37], the host-protein signature maintained performance. This study adds valuable information to previous studies introducing the host-protein signature, in its head-to-head comparison to classical and other (e.g., HNL) biomarkers and to prediction rules, its detailed analysis of performance across specific pathogens and its estimation of the potential for this new diagnostic tool to reduce antibiotic use in two clinical syndromes that are challenging for the clinician to manage.",

            "text": "A key strength of this study is application of a comparator method based on rigorous expert adjudication. One of the challenges in evaluating tests to distinguish bacterial from viral infection is the lack of a gold standard for etiologic diagnosis [36]. To address this, many studies employ microbiological confirmation as a comparator method, which has the advantage of being well-established and reproducible but the notable disadvantage of restricting the cohort to a small proportion of patients, with likely enrichment for easy to diagnose cases. Indeed, there were 153 patients in the subgroup for whom there was clinically relevant microbiological confirmation of the unanimous expert diagnosis as compared to 314 in the full cohort of patients with unanimous expert diagnosis. Although employing expert panel adjudication has the potential to introduce errors, this comparator method has the fundamental advantage of encompassing a greater proportion of patients and consequently, a study cohort that more closely resembles the real clinical setting, especially relevant for respiratory infections and fever without source that can be hard to diagnose at presentation. Other key strengths are the breadth of index tests compared and that their cutoffs were defined before data analysis.",

            "text": "A limitation of the study is that the study population was restricted to secondary care medical centers. Much antibiotic overuse occurs in outpatient settings, particularly for respiratory infections [39], and since the prevalence of viral infections is typically higher and the severity of disease likely lower, future studies of the signature\u2019s diagnostic performance in physician\u2019s offices are planned. Furthermore, immunocompromised patients and oncology patients were excluded from this study, populations that would benefit greatly from such a test and merit future study. Another limitation is that the expert panelists were provided with CRP, WBC, and ANC data, introducing a potential incorporation bias when evaluating the diagnostic performance of any tests that incorporate one or more of these biomarkers, including the host-protein signature. However, since clinicians often employ CRP, WBC, and ANC as part of routine care to decide the etiology of infection, it was reasoned that the comparator method may be impaired if the panelists were blinded to these data. Notably, despite the largest potential incorporation bias, the individual biomarkers CRP, WBC, and ANC did not yield superior performance.",

The need for such tests is highlighted by the finding that the treating physicians prescribed antibiotics to one third of the viral-infected patients in the present study cohort. The host-protein signature identified 88% of these cases as viral infections, and therefore, has the potential to reduce antibiotic overuse considerably. Importantly, because both sensitivity and specificity are over 93%, this potential may be fulfilled, as the clinician can be confident about the signature\u2019s performance at both ruling-in and ruling-out bacterial infection. This said, the test is not a substitute for physician education on clinical diagnosis and judicious antibiotic use; the host-protein signature is intended for use in conjunction with clinical assessments and other laboratory findings as an aid to differentiate bacterial from viral infection. Future health and economic outcome research is warranted to evaluate the impact of incorporating the signature into routine patient care.",
