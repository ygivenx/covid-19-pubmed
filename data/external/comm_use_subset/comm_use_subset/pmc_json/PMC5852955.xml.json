            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is the etiologic agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), an acute enteritis disease that is characterized by vomiting and watery diarrhea and usually leads to high morbidity and mortality, especially in piglets [1]. The disease was first recognized in England in 1971 [2], and the prototype virus, which was designated as PEDV CV777, was identified in Belgium [3]. Subsequently, PEDV has been reported in several other European countries, causing only sporadic outbreaks. Since the 1980s, it has been widespread in Asia and has become an economic concern for the swine industry in many Asian countries such as Japan, China, South Korea, Thailand, and Taiwan [1, 4]. In late 2010, new Chinese strains of PEDV were detected. These new strains were clinically more severe than the classical strains, resulting in 80%\u2013100% illness among infected swine herds and a 50%\u2013100% mortality rate among infected suckling piglets [5]. In April 2013, a PEDV outbreak was confirmed in the US for the first time. It swept across more than 30 states in the country, causing deaths of more than 8 million newborn piglets during the one-year-epidemic period, and subsequently spread throughout North America, including Canada and Mexico [6]. Afterward, US-like PED epidemics have been reported in South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Germany, France, and Belgium [4, 7].",

Among the viral proteins, the S glycoprotein is the most diverse [8], and plays a critical role in the process of inducing neutralizing antibodies and binding specific receptors [9]. At least two B cell epitopes (SS2 and SS6) and two regions containing neutralizing epitopes (COE and 2C10) have been identified on this protein [10\u201312]. The S gene is also associated with growth adaptation in vitro and attenuation of virulence in vivo [13], and was used as an important component in studies for understanding genetic relatedness among PEDV isolates, the epidemiological status, and vaccine development [14, 15]. The M protein is the most abundant component of viral protein in the envelope, and is responsible for morphogenesis, assembly, and budding [16]. The N protein of coronavirus interacts with viral genomic RNA, serving as the critical basis for the helical nucleocapsid during the viral assembly [17]. Two antigenic epitopes (NEP-D4 and NEP-D6) have been identified in the N protein of PEDV [18].",

In an epidemic of diarrhea caused by a PEDV infection in 1996, more than 39,000 suckling pigs died [20]. Afterward, there were no PED cases reported from 2006 until the first half of 2013 [21, 22]. PED outbreaks first reemerged in October 2013 from a southern location (Okinawa Island) and spread rapidly throughout the country. Until May 2016, PEDV infections were reported from more than 1000 farms in 39 of 47 prefectures; the infections affected over 1.5 million pigs and led to the death of half a million pigs, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries of Japan (http://www.maff.go.jp). Currently, PEDV infections and piglet mortality has decreased significantly. However, PED still occurred and frequently recurred in pig farms in Japan. Therefore, better insight into the causes for the reemergence of PED outbreaks is required for more efficient control and prevention of the disease. Toward this goal, we sequenced and analyzed the full-length S, M, and N genes of the Japanese field PEDVs in comparison with those of vaccine strains used in Japan, classical Japanese PEDV strains, and isolates from other countries.",

Intestinal samples were collected from dead piglets, and fecal samples were non-invasively collected immediately after excretion. Thus, no aggressive actions toward the pigs were carried out for sampling purpose. Samples of two major vaccine strains that have been employed in Japan, P5-V (Nisseiken Co., Ltd) and 96-P4C6 (Kaketsuken Co., Ltd., Japan), were collected from commercial vaccine bottles used in the swine farms. Sample preparation, RNA extraction, and PEDV detection were performed as previously described [23]. Japanese field samples may contain both PEDV variants with large deletions in the 5\u2032-terminus of the S gene and PEDV strains with an intact S gene [24]. Due to the complexity in discriminating, isolating, and individually sequencing PEDV strains, only specimens containing PEDVs with an intact S gene were used in our study. Finally, 45 PEDV-positive field samples were collected from 37 farms, located in five different prefectures in Japan. These samples, along with the two vaccine samples described above, were sequenced to determine the full-length sequence of the S, M, and N genes (Table 1). All these field PEDVs were confirmed to possess an intact 5\u2032-terminus of the S gene, showing only the expected prominent single DNA band from PCR products on a 1.2% agarose gel [24].",

Despite the nationwide use of available attenuated vaccines developed decades ago [21], PEDV has rapidly swept across the county. Our sequencing data revealed that the prevailing Japanese PEDVs are genetically heterogeneous and can be classified into 3 genotypes: NA, S INDEL, and Asian non-S INDEL. Both the NA and S INDEL types, which have been identified in recent studies in Japan [21\u201323, 31] were also responsible for recent outbreaks in the US and South Korea. In our study, besides the two previously reported PEDV types, we identified another type of Japanese PEDV (designated as Asian non-S INDEL) that is closely related to the Vietnamese, Thai, and Chinese strains. The Asian non-S INDEL type was collected from an early PED epidemic that occurred in southern Japan where the recent PED pandemic began spreading. Moreover, the Asian non-S INDEL type appeared at a similar time to the appearance of the NA and S INDEL types in Japan [21]. Together with the absence of PED cases from 2007 to 2012 in Japan [21, 22], we speculated a possibility that the three types of Japanese PEDV originated from one source and emerged at the same or similar time in the southern region of Japan before spreading across the country.",

Another PEDV type possessing typical insertions and deletions in the N-terminus of the S gene when compared to the prototype NA type was first discovered in Ohio in the US [29]. This PEDV type, therefore, was designated as S INDEL. The S INDEL PEDVs were also identified later in recent outbreaks in Japan, South Korea, Canada, Belgium, France, Germany, Portugal, Slovenia, and the Netherlands [4]. Both highly virulent and S INDEL PEDVs prevailing in the US are supposed to be derived from Chinese PEDVs as a result of recombinant events [4, 28, 32]. In accordance with these findings, our sequence analysis showed that the S INDEL strains, such as CH/HBQX/10 and JS120103, had already appeared in Chinese PED outbreaks during 2010\u20132012 [33, 34]. With the prevalence of both NA and S INDEL strains in the US, South Korea, and Japan since 2013, we suggested that there are two major possibilities of origin for the reemerging Japanese PEDV strains. First, US-like strains have been directly transmitted to Japan from the US or South Korea. Second, the same source of the US strains could have introduced the PEDV into Japan, from China, shortly after the US outbreaks. However, our study revealed the prevalence of the Asian none-S IDEL PEDV strain in Japan, which has not been reported in the US or South Korea. Thus, we incline toward the possibility that multiple parent PEDV strains have been introduced into Japan, from China or China\u2019s neighboring countries (such as the Southeast Asian region), causing the recent PED pandemic. Further investigation and surveillance are required to specifically identify the source of origin for the reemerging Japanese PEDVs.",

We also identified another strain that belonged to the S INDEL type, 14JM-144, although it was not predicted to be an S INDEL PEDV in the previous study. This discrepancy arose due to the region of the partial S gene utilized in the previous report that lack the typical insertions and deletions of the S INDEL type. Our data revealed the circulation of S INDEL strains in PED outbreaks occurring in Japan, but these strains compose only a minor population of the reemerging Japanese PEDVs.

            "text": "Phosphorylation of viral proteins is a reversible post-translational modification that can have major impacts on viral infection, replication, and cytotoxicity in a host cell [35]. For infectious bronchitis virus, belonging to the coronaviruses, the phosphorylation of the nucleocapsid protein has a dramatic influence on RNA binding capability and the recognition of viral RNA from non-viral RNA in the process of viral replication [36]. Along with phosphorylation, glycosylation is another post-translational modification that often strongly affects the protein functions of viruses. N-glycosylation sites in the spike gene of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus were demonstrated to be crucial for viral infection [37]. On the other hand, mutations observed in the neutralizing regions have been proposed as presenting a viral evolution, allowing escape from antibodies developed against vaccine or classical PEDV strains [38]. In this study, we characterized differences in epitope regions, high-specificity N-glycosylation and phosphorylation sites, between the vaccine and recent field strains. Various substitutions observed in the S (521, 553, 568, and 570), M (5), and N (123, 252, and 255) proteins may have affected the antigenicity, conferring the capacity for immune evasion in the PEDV field strains, and consequently, influencing the efficacy of the vaccines. In fact, despite vaccination, PEDV infections still spread rapidly and are commonly observed on PED-vaccinated farms in Japan [23]. Vaccination showed very low efficacy and could not mitigate the severe losses caused by PED [39]. Based on the antigenicity analysis of the vaccine and field strains, as well as the recent performance of the PED vaccines on the Japanese pig farms, we suggest that the development of novel vaccines based on reemerging PEDVs is necessary to control current PED outbreaks.",

Afterward, obvious clinical symptoms and death caused by PED were not observed in pigs of the herd until February 2016 when the subsequent outbreak recurred with less severity than the first. Although the pigs did not show any obvious symptoms of PED, the presence of PEDV on this farm was detected in piglets several times by RT-PCR during the period from June 2014 to January 2016, according to the information supplied by veterinarians responsible for this farm. Phylogenetic analysis based on the sequences of the S and N genes showed that PEDV strains from the primary and secondary outbreaks formed monophyletic branches. They also shared with each other the highest sequence identity of the S, M, and N genes compared to other strains used in this study. Additionally, PED outbreaks were not observed on other farms within a 5 km radius of farm 1, and many strict measures for establishing a high level of security were implemented on this farm. Taken together, we speculated that PEDV strains causing the primary outbreak induced partial protective immunity but persisted in the herd for nearly two years. Subsequently, the persisted PEDVs caused the secondary epidemic. This is the first report of a two-year-long persistence of PEDV in a pig herd. It has been proposed that the popular circulation of PEDV variants with large deletions in the S gene is associated with the persistence of the PEDV on the infected farms in Japan [24]. However, we did not detect the presence of the large S deletion variants in the fecal and intestinal samples collected from this farm. Other factors, including the genetic variation of causative PEDV strains, may play a more important role in the disease recurrence.",

Afterward, the disease disappeared until early 2016 when the subsequent outbreaks recurred. There was no detection of the PEDV during the interval between these two outbreaks. Phylogenetic analysis based on the S and N genes revealed that the strains collected from the first outbreaks on farms 2 and 3 formed a monophyletic branch. Moreover, these two farms were located close to each other with a distance of 0.5 km (separated by a small mountain), and the outbreaks occurred at the same time. This suggests that the PEDV strains introduced onto these farms that induced the first outbreaks were derived from a common source of PEDV. Likewise, in the secondary outbreaks, the strains collected from these two farms also have the highest genetic identity to each other and formed minor monophyletic branches, as shown in the phylogenetic trees for the S and N genes. All the strains collected from the primary and recurrent outbreaks on these farms were closely clustered into the subclade PED-J2, together with other strains collected from other farms located in Miyazaki prefecture (Fig. 1). This data suggested that the PEDV strains causing the subsequent outbreaks on farms 2 and 3 evolved from PEDVs that had been circulating in the Miyazaki region since 2014. There are two possibilities for the origin of the strains that caused the subsequent outbreaks on farms 2 and 3. First, PEDVs may have persisted silently on these farms since 2014, evolving, and then causing the subsequent outbreaks when suitable conditions arrived in early 2016. Another possibility is that PEDVs may have persisted on other pig farms, circulating in the Miyazaki region since the 2014 PED occurrence, after which the PEDVs were introduced again onto farms 2 and 3, causing the secondary epidemics. More data is needed to elucidate exactly the origin of these PEDVs strains. The occurrence of PED in these herds has partially indicated the failure of using the current PEDV vaccines, which are based on old seed stock of classical Japanese strains. Besides, the repeated outbreaks in these herds indicate that the disease has developed to an endemic stage. These results could be used to elucidate the prevalence of PEDVs and to contribute to the prevention of PED in the region.",

            "text": "In conclusion, our study revealed that Japanese field PEDVs causing PED outbreaks during 2013\u20132016 could be classified into three types, and these PEDVs might have been introduced from overseas at the same time or during similar periods. The disease has developed to an endemic stage in which the PEDV can persist for a long time in these herds or these local regions causing subsequent epidemics. The distant genetic relationships and various aa substitutions between the Japanese field PEDVs and vaccine strains may be responsible for the unsuccessful PED control in Japan. Our findings will be useful in understanding the origin and molecular epidemiology of the PEDV, and helping to develop measures for the control of the disease.",
