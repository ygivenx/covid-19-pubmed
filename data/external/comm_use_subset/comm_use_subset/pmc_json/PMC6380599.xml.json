With regards to SFTSV hosts, various vertebrate species are considered to have been infected, as evidenced by high SFTSV seroprevalence in domestic animals in SFTS endemic regions[8,9]. Additionally, reported cases of human-to-human transmission through contact with blood or body fluid, including infections in healthcare workers from patients, pose a further threat to the public[10,11]. Furthermore, the discovery of H. longicornis tick in the United States indicates the possibility that SFTSV could spread to other continents, highlighting the need to prevent disease transmission[12].",

A phylogenetic analysis based on genome sequences of SFTSV isolates found substantial genetic diversity and accumulated mutations, suggesting that SFTSV has existed for decades at minimum[14,15]. However, the difference in virulence between these SFTSV sub-lineages has yet to be determined.",

In severe cases, SFTS can include central nervous system manifestations, hemorrhagic signs, and multiple organ dysfunction, which can lead to death[18\u201321]. No vaccines or therapeutics specific for SFTS have been approved for human use. Recently, a Phase 3 clinical trial of favipiravir (Avigan), a drug approved for the treatment of influenza virus infection in Japan, was initiated to expand its indication to SFTS treatment[22]. Monoclonal antibodies or convalescent sera from SFTS patients were tested to identify potential therapeutic intervention targets, resulting in the identification of SFTSV glycoproteins as molecules required for host cell entry[23,24] and also as critical targets for virus neutralization through the development of humoral immunity. Both the Gn and Gc envelope glycoproteins of SFTSV are type I transmembrane proteins, and Gc is proposed to be a membrane fusion protein critical for SFTSV infection[25]. This has also been shown in Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV)[26], which is a well-known phlebovirus, whereas the function of Gn remains largely elusive across all other species in the genus Phlebovirus. The structure of the Gn head domain, which is composed of three subdomains, was resolved in SFTSV and RVFV[27]. However, the homology and arrangement within subdomains differ considerably between the two viruses, and the structure of the Gn stem domain still remains unknown. Moreover, the generation of an antibody for these targets in infected humans is rare, due to the presence of immunodominant decoy epitopes in the nucleoprotein[28], which is a common phenomenon in a pathogenic virus-infected host[29]. In animal models, however, the protective effect of human convalescent sera was shown, suggesting that antibody therapy is possible[30]. Thus far, MAb4-5 is the only human neutralizing monoclonal antibody reported, and it was developed using a combinatorial human antibody library from five patients[31]. MAb4-5 binds to domain III of SFTSV Gn glycoprotein[27]. The neutralizing effect of MAb4-5 has been shown only in in vitro, and its in vivo efficacy remains to be shown.",

We constructed the phage-displayed single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody library with a complexity of 1.3 \u00d7 109 colony forming units using peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from a patient who had recovered from SFTS. The phage-display antibody library with a coverage level of 730\u00d7 was subjected to four rounds of biopanning against either the recombinant Gn-Fc or the Gc-Fc fusion proteins conjugated to paramagnetic beads. We randomly selected phagemid clones from the output titer plate from the last round of biopanning and subjected these clones to phage enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). To minimize the number of clones reactive to the Fc portion of fusion proteins, Gn-C\u03ba and Gc-C\u03ba were used as antigens. Positive clones were selected and subjected to Sanger sequencing to determine the scFv nucleotide sequence. We identified five clones reactive to Gn and five clones reactive to Gc. All of these scFv clones were expressed as a scFv antibody fused with Fc (scFv-Fc) in HEK293F cells and purified by affinity.",

Antibodies targeting emerging or re-emerging viruses including MERS-CoV[44\u201346] and Zika virus[47\u201349] were also developed and are being tested in clinical trials. In the past several decades, antibodies have become one of the major therapeutic agents for cancer and autoimmune disease with indications that have rapidly broadened in recent years.

However, SFTS fatality varies among the three countries[21]. The average case fatality rate in China from 2011 to 2016 was 6.40%[2]. Those in South Korea and Japan after 2013 were much higher; 20.9%[5] and 19.4%[6], respectively. In the Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR), 272 sequences of SFTSV isolates are currently deposited. However, it is unknown if there is any significant variability in the virulence of these isolates. Previous reports showed that mice died 5 to 7 days after infection with 106 focus forming units (FFU) of the YG1 strain[30] or 106 TCID50 of the SPL010 strain[51]. Based on these observations, we first inoculated A129 mice with 2 \u00d7 105 PFU of the Gangwon/Korea/2012 strain and observed that all mice died 4 days after infection. With a 20 PFU dose of the Gangwon/Korea/2012 strain, mice died 5 to 7 days after infection. This increased virulence was also reported by a study that showed a similar fatality rate in STAT2 knockout Syrian hamsters challenged with 10 PFU of the HB29 strain[52].",

The most-widely known mechanism is binding of an antibody to the portion of the virus that interacts with the host cell receptor, thereby blocking the interaction between the virus and the host cell[54]. Another group of antibodies was reported to bind the stem region of influenza hemagglutinin that is critical for conformational rearrangements that occur during membrane fusion[55\u201357]. This mechanism has more potential to be utilized for clinical development, because the stem region has fewer mutations than the receptor binding site. Additionally, several groups, including ours, have elucidated unconventional virus neutralizing mechanisms that affect the infection steps that occur after membrane fusion[58,59].",

Although the crystal structure of the phlebovirus Gn glycoprotein stem region has not yet been solved, a recent report showed a cryo-electron microscopy map of RVFV, and depicted the crystal structure of the RVFV Gn glycoprotein head region without a stem region[60]. The report also describes the membrane fusion mechanism of RVFV that is mediated by a low pH induced exposure of the hydrophobic Gc fusion loop. At a neutral pH, the Gn domain II (\u03b2-ribbon domain) shields the Gc fusion loop in the pre-fusion state and prevents premature fusion. Based on this report, we hypothesize that Ab10 simultaneously binds to domain II and the stem region of the Gn glycoprotein and prevents un-shielding of the Gc fusion loop.",

The fifty-percent tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) values were titrated on Vero cells using the Reed-Muench method[67]. Ab10 or MAB4-5 scFv-Fc fusion protein was serially diluted in 10-fold increments from a 50 \u03bcg/mL concentration, then mixed with an equal volume of 100 TCID50 SFTSV and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. The virus-antibody mixture was transferred onto Vero cells in 8-well chamber slides (154534; Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. For the no-infection-control group, no virus was added to the cells. In contrast, for the infection-control group, no antibody was incubated with the virus. After removing the virus-antibody mixture, cells were cultured for 2 days. For the IFA, cultured cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Slides were blocked and permeabilized with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1% bovine serum albumin, followed by incubation with 5 \u03bcg/mL of anti-SFTSV Gn glycoprotein antibody[68] at 4\u00b0C overnight. After washing, cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 1:100 diluted fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG Fc antibody (111-095-046; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA). To stain the nucleus, 4\u2019,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) was used.
