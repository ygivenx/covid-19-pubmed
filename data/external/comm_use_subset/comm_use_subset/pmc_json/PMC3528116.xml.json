            "text": "Recent studies have shown that polysaccharides enhance the organism specificity and the non-specific immune function of vaccines [1,2,3,4,5,6]. Polysaccharides activate T cells, B cells, macrophages (M\u03c6), natural killer cells (NK), cytotoxic T cells (TL), lymphokine-activated killer cells (LAK) and other immune cells. Polysaccharides also promote the secretion of interleukin 1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (INF) from giant macrophages [7], the production of leukocyte interleukin 2 (IL-2) from T lymphocytes, the production of interferon (TFN) from activated white blood cells and the activation of the complement and reticuloendothelial systems in a variety of ways [8,9]. Polysaccharides can enhance immune function [10,11], have no toxic side effects in normal cells and are good biological response modifiers that can be developed into a new type of vaccine adjuvant [12,13]. Interest in these polysaccharides for the development of new adjuvants or immunopotentiators for medical and veterinary vaccines has increased [14,15,16,17]; however, the benefits of incorporating polysaccharides into combined Newcastle disease, infectious bronchitis and avian influenza inactivated vaccines have not been demonstrated. In our previous study, we determined that the Sargassum polysaccharide demonstrated a stronger potential to enhance serum antibody titers and lymphocyte proliferation in chickens compared with seven other Chinese herbal medicinal ingredients, such as Astragalus polysaccharide and Lycium barbarum polysaccharides.",

Polysaccharides in the Sargassum pallidum include outermost skeleton polysaccharide, the intercellular mucopolysaccharide and storage polysaccharides in protoplasts. The recent studies about SPP in the domestic and foreign are the intercellular mucopolysaccharide primarily [18,19]. The SPP we used were prepared as previously described [20]. The net polysaccharide content was 81.2%, as measured using the sulfuric acid-anthrone method. The SPP were diluted with deionized water, sterilized and assayed for endotoxin using the pyrogen test. When the endotoxin content was at the level recommended by the standards of the Chinese Veterinary Pharmacopoeia (less than 0.5 EU/mL) [21], the SPP were stored at 4 \u00b0C.",

This observation corresponds with a report by Wang [29] showing the effectiveness of Chinese herbal medicine compounds in enhancing immunity in chickens.
