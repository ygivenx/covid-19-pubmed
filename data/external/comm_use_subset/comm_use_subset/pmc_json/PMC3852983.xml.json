            "text": "The Smith-Waterman-Gotoh algorithm (SW) [1,2] is the most influential algorithm for aligning a pair of sequences. It is an essential component of the majority of aligners from the classical BLAST [3] to the more recent mappers. Although most of these aligners do not use SW directly to align a sequence to the whole genome sequence due to the quadratic time complexity of SW, they extensively use it for seed extension and for constructing the final alignment, and spend significant amount of CPU time on this algorithm. Due to the critical role of SW, many efforts have been made to accelerate SW, taking the advantages of special hardware such as single instruction multiple data (SIMD), field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and graphics processing unit (GPU) [4\u20136]. Among the three, SIMD based algorithms are most frequently used because they are compatible with most modern x86 CPUs. SIMD acceleration methods can be further divided into intra-sequence parallelization [7] and inter-sequence parallelization [8]. Inter-sequence parallelization is only useful when many pairs of sequencing reads are aligned simultaneously; intra-sequence parallelization however parallelizes for each single pairwise alignment, so it can be used more flexibly in various applications such as that needs aligning a single read against a potentially large genome reference sequence. Farrar\u2019s Striped SW [9] with SWPS3\u2019s [10] improvement is the fastest intra-sequence parallelized SIMD implementation running on x86 processors with the Streaming SIMD Extensions 2 (SSE2) instruction set. Indeed, Farrar\u2019s algorithm has been embedded in several popular genomic sequence mapping tools, such as BWA-SW [11], Bowtie2 [12], Novoalign (http://www.novocraft.com/) and Stampy [13].",

Firstly, implementing a striped SW requires good understanding of SSE2 instructions and the more complex algorithm, which may take significant development time. Secondly, the original striped SW only gives the optimal alignment score but does not report the position or the detailed alignment, the information necessary for using SW as a component to construct the final alignment. How to report the position and alignment without affecting speed is non-trivial. Thirdly, while a few implementations report position and alignment, they are tightly integrated in a larger project and cannot be easily reused in other programs. Fourthly, when aligning a short read against a long sequence, we would like to know suboptimal alignments such that we can tell if the optimal position is trustworthy. Most existing libraries have not addressed this issue.",

It extends the Striped SW and SWPS3\u2019s SIMD implementations to provide the mapping location and detailed alignment information (traceback), without performance penalty. Though these features are crucial when integrating SW into other genomic analysis systems, among the existing SIMD SW implementations only SSEARCH provides them, and as discussed in the Performance: Short-Read Genomic Alignment section its performance in typical genomic alignment contexts is poor. The SSW library can also return the heuristic suboptimal (second-best) alignment score and location without additional computational cost, which enables the use of the method in contexts that exploit this information in mapping-quality estimation. We describe our efficient implementation of these features in the Methods section.",

We provide the library with an executable alignment tool that can be used directly to perform protein or DNA alignments. It is a demonstration of the API usage and a practical tool for accurate whole viral or bacterial genome alignment. Moreover, since this tool is sufficiently fast and memory-efficient for alignment to very large reference genome sequences, e.g. the human genome, it can also be used to validate alignments produced by heuristic read mappers.

Even though each SW run is short, it may be applied hundreds of millions of times within a single run of a mapper, and therefore even small inefficiencies result in wasteful resource usage. To quantify time savings with SSW, we compared the performance of our new method with the existing SW implementation within the MOSAIK mapping program [14], which uses SW for the final read alignments. We found that the SSW library achieves a two-fold speedup of the entire MOSAIK compared with the current banded SW implementation within it (see Table 1).

We used our SSW library to align \u201corphaned\u201d or severely \u201cclipped\u201d fragment-end read mates (in the case of read pairs where one end-mate is aligned with high mapping quality, but the other mate is either unmapped or mapped with many unaligned or \u201cclipped-off\u201d bases) to the genomic regions indicated by the well-mapped mates\u2019 coordinates. Inclusion of the SW mapping routines of our SSW library makes accurate and fast split-read alignment for SV detection possible. The split-read mapping functionality, using our SSW library, has also been implemented in the TANGRAM SV detection tool (https://github.com/jiantao/Tangram).

We tested the effect of the SSW library in this application against a standard SW implementation (https://github/ekg/smithwaterman). To do the speed comparison test, we generated read-overlap graphs for the genomic region 20:21026000-21027500 using 22,543 reads (70 bp long) from 191 African samples in the 1000 Genomes Project dataset. The sample identifiers are listed in Appendix S2 in File S1. The running time of the read-overlap graph generation program RZMBLR (https://github.com/ekg/rzmblr\") embedded with an ordinary SW (1795.66 seconds) is about twice of that embedded with our SSW library (973.02 seconds).",

By returning not only the optimal alignment score but also the actual alignment, as well as a secondary optimal or suboptimal alignment score, the SSW library is suitable for inclusion into other heuristic genomic sequence analysis programs requiring local SW alignment. The most significant utility of our development, however, is that our algorithms can be readily integrated into C/C++ software without modification of the source code, accelerating development for larger software tools. SSW has already been adopted in four programs developed by our group: the primary read mapping tool MOSAIK, the split-read mapping program SCISSORS, the MEI detector TANGRAM, and the read-overlap graph generation program RZMBLR.",

For speedup, we adopted the \u201clazy F loop\u201d improvement proposed by SWPS3 [7]. Furthermore we obtained additional alignment information compared to SWPS3 without slowing down the original algorithm: (1) we record the optimal alignment ending positions during the SIMD SW calculation and generate the detailed alignment by a reversed SIMD SW and a banded SW. When the score matrix is filled by the SIMD SW calculation, we store the maximal score of each column in a \u201cmax\u201d array and record the complete column that has the maximal score of the whole matrix. Next, we locate the optimal alignment ending position on the reference and the query by seeking the maximal score in the array and the recorded column respectively. The reversed SIMD SW locates the best alignment beginning position from the ending position by calculating a much smaller scoring matrix. Then, the banded SW (whose band is defined by the beginning and ending positions) generates the detailed alignment. Since the alignment generation using the reversed SIMD SW and the banded SW only calculates a very small portion of the whole SW scoring matrix when the query sequence is much shorter than the target, in most cases of genome sequence alignment the corresponding time cost is trivial (2). We determine the secondary alignment score by seeking the second largest score in the \u201cmax\u201d array. To avoid a similar sub-alignment of the primary alignment returned, we mask the elements in the region of the primary alignment of the \u201cmax\u201d array and locate the second largest score from the unmasked elements (Figure 4). As a crucial step for locating the alignment position and estimating the suboptimal score, the \u201cmax\u201d array generation is completed by adding an SSE2 command in the inner loop of Farrar\u2019s implementation and another command in the outer loop, so that this additional time consumption is limited.",
