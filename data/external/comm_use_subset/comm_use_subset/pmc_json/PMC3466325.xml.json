            "text": "Vaccines based on attenuated viral vectors (e.g. poxviruses, adenovirus) are highly immunogenic, relatively inexpensive to produce, and can be delivered by multiple routes. These advantages have accelerated the development of virus-vectored vaccines, especially as concerns about emerging infectious diseases such as avian influenza and multi-drug resistant tuberculosis increase. However, pre-existing anti-vector immunity can significantly impair the ability to raise immune responses to vaccination in the pre-immune host. That suggests that it will be advantageous to prioritize development of viral vaccine vectors to which pre-existing immunity is rare in the human population. Vaccine vectors based on recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) are highly immunogenic and can protect small animals and non-human primates against a range of infectious diseases [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. VSV is also a potent oncolytic agent, and has been shown to be superior to nine other viruses tested against multifocal glioma [6], [7] and other cancers [8], [9]. Natural infection of humans with VSV is extremely uncommon, and therefore pre-existing immunity to rVSV vectors is almost non-existent [10], [11], [12]. Despite these advantages, development of rVSV for human clinical use continues to be delayed because of concerns about vector-associated pathology. Small laboratory animals immunized with rVSV vaccines display clinical signs of acute illness and lose up to 20% of their pre-immunization body weight in the first four days after immunization [13], [14]. Although most animals recover, undesirable side effects such as these would be unacceptable in human vaccinees. Weight loss is less pronounced in non-human primates immunized with rVSVs, but the one human to date therapeutically immunized with a single cycle non-replicating experimental rVSV vaccine against Ebola virus developed a high fever and transient viremia in the first 24 hours after vector administration [15]. That result demonstrated that even single cycle vectors can induce significant adverse side effects, and suggested that alternate strategies to reduce residual viral vector reactogenicity are required.",

It has been shown previously that TNF-\u03b1 produced in response to intranasal immunization with rVSV vaccine vectors contributes to, but is not the only factor responsible for, rapid weight loss after rVSV immunization [14]. In those studies, TNF-\u03b1 deficient mice were partially protected from acute pathology after VSV challenge, and TNF-\u03b1 was not required for the generation of humoral immune responses to rVSV [14]. We undertook the present study to expand on those observations, focusing on the importance of IL-1. We addressed intramuscular immunization, because that is the most likely route of administration for rVSV vectors in humans.",

Weight loss is usually maximal by the second day after immunization but most animals recover, with weight returning to normal by five to seven days after immunization. Interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that causes acute weight loss and fever in mice and humans [16], [17], [18], and which stimulates the production of other pro-inflammatory mediators such as IL-6 [17], [19] and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) [20], [21]. To determine whether IL-1 can contribute to the induction of acute pathology after administration of rVSV vaccine vectors, we immunized groups of C57BL/6 wild type (WT, n = 4) or IL-1 receptor deficient (IL-1R\u2212/\u2212, n = 3) mice with a single intramuscular injection of 5\u00d7108 PFU live replication-competent rVSV. All animals survived the immunization, but wild type mice lost approximately 10% of their pre-immunization body weight by the first day after immunization (Figure 1) and did not fully regain their pre-immunization weight until eight days after immunization. In contrast, IL-1R\u2212/\u2212 mice had minimal pathology, losing only a small amount (<5%) of weight on the first day after immunization and returning to their starting weight by the second day after immunization. IL-1R\u2212/\u2212 mice lost significantly less weight than wild type control animals after challenge (P = 0.03 from day 1-day 4 after challenge, Mann-Whitney test). Because mice deficient in the IL-1R cannot respond to IL-1, this result demonstrated that either IL-1\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2, both of which bind to the IL-1R, contributed to acute pathology after rVSV immunization.",

To determine whether intramuscular immunization with VSV vaccine vectors induced production of IL-1\u03b2 in vivo we challenged wild type C57BL/6 mice with rVSV and used an ELISA to quantitate the amount of IL-1\u03b2 produced locally (at the injection site and in the draining lymph node) and systemically (in the blood). As shown in Figure 2A\u2013C, mice immunized intramuscularly with rVSV had accumulations of IL-1\u03b2 in the blood, in the quadriceps muscle, and in the popliteal lymph node that drains the quadriceps at 12 and 24 hours after immunization with VSV rwt. These results confirmed that IL-1\u03b2 was produced in vivo both locally and systemically after intramuscular rVSV challenge, and was consistent with the results of Poeck et al. who found that wild-type mice injected intravenously with rVSV had detectable levels of IL-1\u03b2 in the serum at six hours after challenge [22]. Our results were also consistent with the hypothesis that IL-1\u03b2 caused the acute pathology that occurs after immunization with rVSV vaccine vectors, and suggested that reducing the production of IL-1\u03b2 after rVSV immunization might correspondingly reduce reactogenicity and other undesirable side effects of vaccination.",

The role of IL-1 in control of VSV replication has not been examined previously, and reports describing the role of IL-1 in control of other viruses in vivo are not in agreement. Because our ultimate goal is to be able to generate less reactogenic rVSV vectors by attenuating the host inflammatory response, it was important to determine whether IL-1 was required for the control of vaccine vector replication, generation of humoral and cellular immune responses, or to generate protection against rechallenge. To investigate these questions we intramuscularly immunized mice deficient in the IL-1 receptor (IL-1R\u2212/\u2212) with 5\u00d7108 PFU of rVSV and measured viral loads, induction of antibody and T cell responses, and protection from rechallenge. As shown in Figure 3A, viral loads in the quadriceps muscle (injection site) were not significantly different between wild type and IL-1R\u2212/\u2212 mice (n = 3 per group) at 24 hours after infection, which is the peak of VSV replication in vivo. Also, virus was not detected in the blood of any infected animal. Those results demonstrated that IL-1 is not required for the control of VSV replication in vivo. As shown in Figure 3B, serum neutralizing antibody titers against VSV were not significantly different in IL-1R\u2212/\u2212 (n = 4 per group per timepoint) and wild type mice (n = 5 per group per timepoint) at any time after immunization. When we used an MHC Class I tetramer to measure CD8 T cell responses to an immunodominant H-2 Kb-restricted epitope (N-RGYVYQGL-C) in the VSV N protein [24], IL-1R\u2212/\u2212 mice had slightly fewer anti-VSV N specific CD8 T cells in the blood than did wild type animals (Figure 3C) at 14 and 28 days after immunization, although the difference was only statistically significant at 14 days after immunization (P = 0.03, Two-tailed T test). Finally, to determine whether these immune responses were sufficient to protect wild type and IL-1R\u2212/\u2212 mice from re-challenge with rVSV, we challenged all animals intranasally with 1\u00d7108 PFU of rVSV at eight weeks after the primary infection. As shown in Figure 3D, pre-immune wild type and pre-immune IL-1R\u2212/\u2212 mice were fully protected from rechallenge, while na\u00efve wild type animals (n = 7, open triangles, Figure 3D), lost up to 20% of their pre-infection body weight. Two out of the seven na\u00efve animals succumbed to infection. Together, these results indicated that IL-1 was not required either for the control of rVSV replication in vivo, or for the generation of protective anti-VSV immune responses. The results also supported the idea that suppressing the production of or response to IL-1\u03b2 in response to rVSV vector administration would not render rVSV vectors unsafe or non-immunogenic.",

IL-1\u03b2 is synthesized as an inactive precursor molecule (pro-IL-1\u03b2), which must be cleaved either intracellularly by endogenous protease caspase-1 [25], [26], [27], or extracellularly by matrix metalloprotease 9 [28] or other neutrophil [29] and mast cell-associated proteases [30] to become biologically active. It was shown recently that murine bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDC) infected with VSV in vitro produce IL-1\u03b2 via formation of an inflammasome composed of RNA helicase RIG-I, adaptor molecule ASC, and caspase-1 [22]. Because the authors did not test whether RIG-I, ASC, and caspase-1 were required to produce IL-1\u03b2 in response to VSV in vivo we used caspase-1-deficient and ASC-deficient mice to determine the effects of the absence of these molecules on acute pathology after rVSV immunization. It was not practical to test RIG-I deficient mice for IL-1\u03b2 induction, because RIG-I deficient mice do not produce IFN in response to VSV and therefore rapidly succumb to infection [31].",

As shown in Figure 4A, the systemic and local production of IL-1\u03b2 was not significantly reduced in ASC\u2212/\u2212 mice relative wild type control mice immunized in parallel. Consistent with that result, and with our prediction that IL-1\u03b2 induces acute weight loss after rVSV infection, ASC\u2212/\u2212 (n = 5) mice lost slightly less weight after rVSV challenge than did wild type C57BL/6 (n = 6) mice infected in parallel, with the difference only reaching statistical significance only on the second day after challenge (P = 0.004, Mann Whitney Test, Figure 4B). A second experiment replicated these findings almost exactly, with ASC\u2212/\u2212 mice (n = 6) showing slightly enhanced protection relative wild type animals (n = 10, Figure S1). The difference in weight loss between wild type and ASC\u2212/\u2212 mice was small but highly reproducible, and ASC\u2212/\u2212 mice were never protected to the same extent as IL-1R\u2212/\u2212 mice. To confirm that observation, we infected the three groups in parallel (5\u00d7108 PFU rVSV intramuscular). As shown in Figure 4C, IL-1R\u2212/\u2212 mice (n = 4) lost significantly less weight than wild type (n = 5) mice (days 1\u20134 after challenge P<0.05 via one way ANOVA with Bonferroni multiple comparison test) and recovered their pre-immunization body weight more quickly than either wild type or ASC\u2212/\u2212 mice. The difference in weight loss between IL-1R\u2212/\u2212 and ASC\u2212/\u2212 mice was significant on the first and second day after challenge (P<0.05 via one way ANOVA with Bonferroni multiple comparison test). Similar to the results obtained in IL-1R\u2212/\u2212 mice, ASC\u2212/\u2212 mice made equivalent humoral responses and slightly reduced cellular responses to VSV, and were fully protected from high dose rechallenge (Figure 4D\u2013F). Taken together, these results demonstrated that production of IL-1\u03b2 in vivo after intramuscular rVSV immunization occurred independent of inflammasome adaptor molecule ASC. Because ASC deficient mice were not protected fully from acute pathology after rVSV immunization, strategies that suppress the function of ASC would be predicted to partially but not completely abrogate acute pathology after rVSV immunization.",

This is important because while VSV is a highly promising vaccine vector and oncolytic agent, its clinical development has lagged behind that of other live viruses because of concerns about vector-associated pathology. Fever, myalgia, and the \u201csickness response\u201d are induced by many live viral or bacterial vaccines [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], and these vaccine-induced side effects are among the leading reasons why some individuals elect not to receive protective vaccines [37], [38], [39]. Consistent with our results obtained in the mouse model and presented here, several recent studies have correlated increased levels of IL-1 or other pro-inflammatory cytokines with the induction of high fevers or other adverse events in response to live virus vaccination in humans [36], [40], or have identified genetic polymorphisms in the IL-1 gene which predispose individuals to severe adverse events after receiving live virus vaccines [41]. For these reasons it is important to determine the ways in which pro-inflammatory cytokines contribute to reactogenicity of VSV vectors in particular, not only because those findings could advance development of VSV-based therapeutics, but also because our findings might help to inform the development of other live virus vaccines and oncotherapies.",

Although intranasal immunization has many advantages (needle free delivery, induction of mucosal immunity, etc), a significant drawback to intranasal immunization with rVSV is the risk of neurotropic spread of the virus. VSV instilled in the nose rapidly colonizes the olfactory neurons, and migrates into the brain [42]. The neurovirulence of VSV vectors has been significantly reduced by attenuating the capacity of the VSV vector to replicate [43], but even a remote chance of neurotropic spread will likely prevent use of the intranasal route for human inoculations. Therefore, we decided to determine which cytokines were responsible for acute pathology after intramuscular immunization, which is regarded as a safer route by which to administer potentially neurotropic agents.",

IL-1\u03b2 has been well characterized as a mediator of acute inflammatory responses in mice and humans, namely the induction of fever and cachexia, the acute phase response, and upregulation of other inflammatory mediators such as IL-6 in response to infectious or non-infectious stimuli [44], [45], reviewed in [46]. IL-1\u03b2 is more commonly associated with these pathologies than is IL-1\u03b1. For example, IL-1\u03b2 deficient mice, but not IL-1\u03b1 deficient mice, are protected from fever after injection of turpentine [16], [17]. Similarly, IL-1\u03b2, but not IL-1\u03b1, is the etiologic agent of hereditary periodic fever syndromes and other \u201cautoinflammatory\u201d diseases in humans [47], [48]. IL-1\u03b1 is more commonly associated with \u201csterile\u201d inflammation that accompanies apoptotic cell death [49], and with the exception of adenovirus mediated inflammation [50] has not been associated with pathology arising from viral infection. For these reasons, we predict that IL-1\u03b2 is the primary mediator of pathology in our system, but further experiments will be required to formally exclude a role for IL-1\u03b1.",

In other viral infection models where this has been investigated, published reports are not in agreement. For example, Schmitz et al found that IL-1R\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with influenza had a significantly higher rate of mortality than did wild type control animals, but the increase in mortality did not correlate with a higher virus burden in the IL-1R\u2212/\u2212 mice [53]. Three additional reports examined the role of IL-1\u03b2, as well as components of the Nlrp3 inflammasome, in control of influenza infection [23], [54], [55]. In these, two out of three found transiently elevated viral loads in mice in which IL-1\u03b2 production was decreased [23], [54], the other report found no difference in virus burden [55].

Equally important was that IL-1R\u2212/\u2212 mice challenged with VSV made robust humoral and cellular responses to VSV antigens, and were fully protected from a high dose intranasal rechallenge with VSV. Interestingly, we did observe levels of anti-VSV CD8 T cells in the IL-1R\u2212/\u2212 mice and in ASC\u2212/\u2212 mice were transiently but significantly decreased, which is consistent with the report of Iwasaki et al, who found that anti-influenza CD8 T cell responses were slightly decreased in mice with reduced levels of IL-1\u03b2 production [23]. In our studies, the number of anti-VSV specific CD8 T cells was significantly lower in IL-1R\u2212/\u2212 and ASC\u2212/\u2212 mice at 14 days after infection, but was not significantly different at either 7 or 28 days after infection. This finding warrants further investigation, and follow-up studies will focus on determining whether CD8 T cells primed in the absence of IL-1 signaling are functionally different (e.g. in cytotoxic capacity, or in acquisition of central memory phenotype) from those primed in IL-1 intact animals.",

            "text": "The second question arising from our results is how the VSV-induced production of IL-1 might be suppressed. One means of suppressing the biological response to IL-1 in humans is via injection of recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonists. Currently marketed as the drugs Anakinra or Kineret, these agents effect a systemic suppression of IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2. Although systemic suppression of IL-1 is an effective treatment for some conditions (severe rheumatoid arthritis, for example) [57], systemic suppression of IL-1 also carries the risk of enhanced susceptibility to infection [57], [58]. Therefore we decided to determine whether there might be a way of suppressing IL-1 only in the cells directly infected with VSV, or within the focus of VSV-infected cells. To determine the appropriate target molecule(s) to effect local suppression of IL-1, it was necessary to determine the mechanism by which IL-1 was being produced in our model. Several years ago, Muruve et al reported that adenovirus activated human monocytes (THP-1 cells) to produce IL-1\u03b2 in vitro, and that IL-1\u03b2 production was dependent upon NLRP3 and caspase-1 [51]. In the supplement to that manuscript, the authors reported that infection of THP-1 cells with VSV did not induce IL-1\u03b2 production, although detailed methods for that study were not provided. In contrast to that, two more recent studies reported that VSV-infected THP-1 cells do produce IL-1\u03b2 in vitro. In the first study, Poeck et al found that VSV induced production of IL-1\u03b2 was dependent upon caspase-1, but not upon NLRP3 [22]. In contrast to that, Rajan et al found VSV mediated induction of IL-1\u03b2 from THP-1 cells to be dependent on NLRP3, and dependent on caspase-1 [52]. It is likely that the discrepancies in these reports were due to subtle differences in experimental procedures, but the different outcomes reported by each of these groups highlight the complexity of elucidating the precise mechanism(s) by which VSV may induce IL-1.",

            "text": "In our studies we found that VSV induced robust production of IL-1\u03b2 in vivo and that IL-1\u03b2 was still produced in mice lacking caspase-1 or ASC. One caveat to those findings is that ELISA assays such as the one used here do not rigorously discriminate between detection of pro-IL-1\u03b2 and detection of the cleaved active IL-1\u03b2. Therefore it is possible that the some of the IL-1\u03b2 detected in caspase\u2212/\u2212 mice was not biologically active. Precise determination of the amount of active IL-1\u03b2 present in caspase\u2212/\u2212 mice will require the development of better detection reagents. Despite this limitation, our results support a model in which there are multiple pathways by which mature IL-1\u03b2 is produced in vivo in response to VSV. The data are also consistent with the idea that the manner in which mature IL-1\u03b2 is produced (via caspase-1 or not) may vary with the cell in which the IL-1\u03b2 is induced. We further observed that mice lacking caspase-1 or ASC were not protected from acute pathology to the same extent that IL-1R\u2212/\u2212 mice were. That meant that VSV vectors engineered to suppress components of the RIG-I/ASC/caspase-1 inflammasome, or the Nlrp3/ASC/caspase-1 inflammasome, would be unlikely to be significantly less reactogenic than the parent vector. On the other hand, rVSV designed to suppress the biological response to IL-1\u03b2 (for example via inclusion of a soluble IL-1\u03b2 trap), or to IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 (via inclusion of a soluble IL-1 receptor antagonist) might reduce the biological response to IL-1 in vivo and therefore be less reactogenic.",

IL-1 was not required for control of viral replication, for the induction of cellular or humoral immune responses, or for development of protective immunity to rechallenge. These results add to our understanding of the role for IL-1 in promoting immunity to viral challenge, and support the notion that the requirement for IL-1\u03b2 in promoting adaptive immunity may vary according to the type and dose of pathogen encountered as well as the route of exposure. Finally, by identifying IL-1\u03b2 as a major source of reactogenicity for rVSV vaccines, we are able to propose a novel strategy to ameliorate side effects without compromising immunogenicity.",
