The steadily growing globalization makes it difficult to contain pandemics to a certain region. Therefore, pandemic control is of highest importance to human health. Unfortunately, the segmented nature of the genome of influenza viruses is very conducive for genetic shifts and their rapid spread across various genera augments genetic drift. For example, the human influenza pandemics in 1957 and 1968 were suggested to have been caused by re-assorted influenza viruses [1]. Moreover, the H5N1 outbreak in Hong Kong in 1997 has convincingly demonstrated the ability of an avian virus to make the transition from birds to humans directly without going through a perceived \"permissible host\". In particular, the H5N1 virus is believed to have acquired the hemagglutinin (HA) gene from A/goose/Guangdong/1/96 H5N1 and A/teal/Hong Kong/W312/97 H6N1, while the internal genes were received from A/quail/Hong Kong/G1/97 H2N2 or A/teal/Hong Kong/W312/97 H6N1, respectively [2], [3]. Even though this particular strain was eliminated by culling millions of chicken, its ancestors remains circulating in aquatic birds.",

This can facilitate prediction of how these viruses are evolving in terms of spatial, temporal, and host dimensions, and therefore, allows for faster responses to new outbreaks as well as their diagnosis. However, corresponding phylogenetic tree construction algorithms suffer from long runtimes due to their high degrees of computational complexity as well as the large datasets involved. Therefore, it is necessary to develop informatics based solutions that use suitable algorithms and take advantage of distributed computing technologies to make such studies feasible in a reasonable amount of time. Furthermore, these solutions need to be integrated in a framework for pandemic control that is biologist-friendly. As a result, effective vaccines and antivirals can be designed more easily and within a shorter response time, since specific local strains can be targeted directly.",

NA belongs to the glycosyl hydrolase family of proteins and catalyzes the cleavage of sialic acid residues from viral and cellular glycoproteins. Its most important function is to remove the terminal sialic acids from HA in order to enable the virus budding. Moreover, it helps the virus spreading through the system by additionally removing sialic acids from cell surfaces. In particular, since variations in the NA gene can lead to the evolution of more potent strains, studying the molecular evolution of this gene using the latest algorithms and computing power is essential.",

All twelve core sequences are mapped to the Thai clade. Besides these twelve, ten more sequences were found in this clade, whereby eight of them are fragments. The remaining two are actually complete sequences from Thailand (chicken isolates). However, they were annotated as Neuramindase instead of Neuraminidase [12], [13] which explains why these two entries are missing in the core set. However, querying of Uniprot with \"Influenza virus\" and \"NA\" as query terms has returned these two entries which are clearly captured and validated in our phyloinformatics analysis. Zooming out of the Thai clade has shown the Vietnam clade as its nearest neighbor, followed further by the Indian clade with Vietnam strains as their neighbors. On the next higher level Indonesian, Malaysian and Chinese clades are indicated as neighbors. It would be interesting to further study the Indian clade and verify how closely the Indian strains and Vietnamese strains are related with respect to other genes and also at genome level. Such an analysis may lead to the identification of the origin for Bird Flu in India. Further analysis of the large dataset indicates H9N2 as the nearest clade to H5N1 and non-structural protein as nearest to NA within the H5N1_NA group. The overall tree includes isolates from H3N2 to H15N9. A detailed analysis of each clade and sub-clade within this tree and with reference to the other two trees could lead to an understanding of H5N1's molecular evolution at global level.",

As can be seen from additional file 15, the earliest (in terms of the time scale) isolates that were considered belong to the Scotland clade which includes two isolates from chicken isolated in 1959. Both of them share an identical sequence homology. However, the even more important point to note here is the existence of a 20 amino acid stretch from position 48 to 68 in these clades which gets deleted in strains that evolved temporally. This stretch of twenty amino acids is absent in the isolates isolated from regions outside China and Hong Kong from 1996 onward. Another important observation to note is that the Goosander isolate from Guangdong province of China isolated in 1997 (Q9Q0U7/97) retained the same stretch of 20 amino acids as the Scotland clades but with more than 20 point mutations spread across the entire length. The deleted amino acid stretch included three N-glycosylation sites: NQSI, NNTW, and NQTY. The Chinese isolate (Q9Q0U7/97) retained all the glycosylation sites, whereas the two Hong Kong isolates have retained only the NQSI site but lost the other two. All the remaining 17 isolates have lost all the three glycosylation sites. Poon et al. [14] have shown the criticality of acquiring or losing glycan sites for effective viral spread in a study involving the phylogenetics of glycan interactions of the HIV envelop protein. A similar study is being undertaken by the authors of this work to evaluate the role of \"lost\" glycons in H5N1_NA.",

The clustering obtained using NJ seems to be better resolved than the other two in terms of branch length and sub-speciation. A detailed analysis of the Thai clade obtained by ProtPars also has revealed that all the sequences from the core set have been represented in this tree as well. The additional isolates are mostly fragments obtained through PCR amplification and uploaded to Uniprot. An interesting aspect of this clade is the finding that the entry Q5EP24 (Chicken isolate from Vietnam) is placed almost as an outlier in this group. It would be interesting to analyze the genealogies of Vietnam and Thailand clades and to verify whether there are any \"bridging\" isolates such as Q5EP24 that may play an important role in the spread of this deadly disease across the globe.

Our analysis of H5N1 NA data utilizing different phylogenetic algorithms have indicated a spatial clustering of this virus based on geographical distribution rather than temporal or host. Of course, single gene product analysis is insufficient to arrive at any biologically relevant conclusion and, hence, we propose to do multiple gene and genome level analysis as our future work. However, even for a single gene analysis the computing power required is formidable and we have used this approach as a proof of the concept that high performance computing is a must for any meaningful phyloinformatics study. Even with the limited amount of data, we have been able to find a clear pattern (geographical clustering) and the importance of glycon sites. However, further detailed studies in conjunction with other proteins such as HA, Polymerase etc., and also at gene and genome level, are required to draw firm conclusions. It is also true that interpretation becomes more difficult if the size of the trees becomes very large. In our experience, zooming onto a cluster of interest (e.g. Thailand and China clades) with relative ease and quickness, using the Quascade middleware is an attractive feature of our study.

As an answer to this trade-off, MP2 overcomes the limitations of development complexity and inflexibility by providing an abstraction at the component level supported by a fixed number of network level operations. Thus, a developer has a high degree of flexibility regarding the operation of a component as long as the implementation adheres to the I/O scheme provided by the communication layer. Implicit communication refers to the communication that takes place between the output of one component and the input of another component, i.e. the selected data paths among components.
