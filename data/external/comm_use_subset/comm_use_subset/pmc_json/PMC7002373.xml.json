Furthermore, emergence and spread of new high pathogenic influenza variants have posed a critical challenges to the global health and include swine-origin H1N1, H5N8, H9N2, and H7N95\u20138. In China, a novel H7N9 avian influenza virus caused 5 nationwide outbreaks from January 2013 to June 20179.

Influenza RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) which is composed of three subunits, PA, PB1 and PB2, is a very promising alternative target for novel anti-influenza drug discovery research because it is essential for the transcription and replication of virus genes and is conserved among different types of influenza viruses15,16. During transcription, RdRP synthesizes capped and polyadenylated mRNA using 5\u2032 capped RNA primers. During replication, RdRP generates a complementary RNA (cRNA) replication intermediate, which serves as a template for the synthesis of new copies of viral RNA (vRNA)17,18.",

            "text": "Influenza virus polymerase requires a large number of host cell factors to engage in the viral RNA transcription and replication processes19,20. The interactions between influenza polymerase and host cell factors were identified by diverse methods, such as genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screens21, proteomic approaches22, and systematic immunoprecipitation analysis23. Host factor PACT is a double-stranded RNA-binding protein that is also known to be an activator of the cellular dsRNA-dependent protein kinase, PKR24. PACT is involved in the interaction between influenza A virus (IAV) and host cells, and it can substantially enhance RIG-I activation and phosphorylate eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2\u03b1) to induce an IFN type I response, which is suppressed by the nonstructural influenza virus protein NS125,26. Recently, researchers have emphasized that, during IAV infection, PACT exerts its antiviral activity primarily by interacting with and inhibiting IAV polymerase. It has been demonstrated that PACT is associated with PA, PB1, and PB227. Compromising PACT in IAV-infected A549 cells led to the enhancement of vRNA transcription and replication and IFN\u03b2 production. In addition, vRNA replication was increased by knocking down PACT in both A549 cells and IFN-insufficient Vero cells28.",

When IAV prevails, the antiviral activity of IFNs can insufficiently inhibit IAV replication, and the accumulation of vRNA and RNP results in overactivation of IFNs, which might lead to the development of pathological inflammation. In contrast, when IFNs prevail, IAV replication is suppressed and eventually cleared49,50. In the current study, IFN\u03b2, PKR and PACT levels were remarkably elevated in the lung tissues of mice infected with IAV. The results indicated that IAV infection induced an IFN-I response in the mice and that PACT enhanced the activation of the PKR and IFN response, findings consistent with those from a recently reported study51,52. IGEs treatment at doses of 20, 10, 5 mg/kg significantly decreased the IFN\u03b2 production and depressed the elevated levels of PACT and PKR in lung tissues of the IAV-infected mice. Our findings revealed that IGEs might protect the IAV-infected mice from pneumonia and death by inhibiting the overactivation of the IFN response induced by PACT.",

In the current study, PACT expression in the A549 cells increased significantly 24, 36, and 48 h after IAV infection. In addition, the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 in the A549 cells was dramatically increased 24, 36, and 48 h after IAV infection. The results demonstrated that IAV infection led to a PACT response and activated eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, findings in general agreement with a previous report56. Furthermore, IGEs treatment markedly inhibited PACT expression in a dose-dependent manner at the three measurement time points post- infection. Interestingly, eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation was significantly suppressed by IGEs treatment at four time points. These results indicated that the overactivation of PACT and eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation induced by IAV was suppressed by IGEs treatment, which provides evidence that IGEs exert anti-IAV activity by inhibiting the overactivation of the PACT-dependent innate immune response.",

According to the results of the dual-luciferase reporter gene assay, the HEK-293T cells transfected with only with pFlu-luc showed very low relative luciferase activity for the IAV RNA polymerase. In contrast, cells co-transfected with plasmids containing NP, PA, PB1, PB2 and Flu-luc showed relatively high RNA polymerase activity. Of note, our results indicated that knocking down PACT enhanced IAV polymerase activity, a finding that was consistent with that of a previous study. Hence, virus replication that was catalysed by IAV polymerase was enhanced by compromising the action of PACT, which was identified as an antiviral host factor. In addition, IGEs treatment at doses of 320 and 160 \u03bcg/ml showed a relatively weak suppressive effect on IAV polymerase activity in the PACT-knockdown HEK-293T cells.

The relative luciferase activity was calculated based on the ratio of the Renilla luciferase value to firefly luciferase value.",
