            "text": "Coronaviruses, like most successful viruses, have evolved strategies to evade the innate immune response. Type-1 interferon (IFN) expression is a crucial component of this initial response, and coronaviruses have developed strategies to prevent IFN induction[4]. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) are recognized by the innate immune system through activation of cytosolic (RIG-1 and MDA-5)[5] and membranous (TLR3)[6], [7] pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). The recognition by these PRRs triggers the activation of Interferon Regulatory Factor (IRF3, IRF7) which leads to the induction of type-1 interferon, such as IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2[8]. Type-1 IFN activates immune anti-viral effectors such as Natural Killer (NK) cells[9], T CD8+ cells and macrophages, allowing viral clearance[10]. Consistent with the studies demonstrating that Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV proteins contribute to dampen type-1 IFN signalling to evade innate immunity and viral clearance[1], [7], an in vitro study reported a beneficial effect of Interferon-alpha (IFN\u03b1) treatment on MERS-CoV replication in a cellular model[11]. In this study the authors showed that MERS-CoV was 50-100 times more sensitive to IFN-\u03b1 treatment than SARS-CoV. However, to date there is no clear therapeutic protocol beside supportive treatment in MERS-CoV infection.",

Although it is very difficult to draw a simple line from a clinical observation to a therapeutic protocol, the analysis of the host response is a cornerstone in the design of relevant approaches.

In our study we show in patient 1, who presented a poor outcome, a significant decrease in receptors and regulators involved in the recognition of MERS-CoV such as RIG-1, MDA5, and IRF3-7. The decrease in IRF3 and 7 was associated with a major decrease in IFN\u03b1 expression and secretion in BAL as well as in serum. Josset et al. demonstrated in an in vitro microarray analysis that MERS-CoV, like SARS-CoV[7], suppressed antigen presentation pathways by down-regulating type I and II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes[17]. To assess the consequences of this down-regulation, we quantified the production of two key cytokines, IL-12 and IFN\u03b3, involved in the activation of lymphocytes into T CD4+ Th-1 cells. Our results show a clear difference between the two patients with a significant increase of both IL-12 and IFN\u03b3 in patient 2.

We confirmed this observation in the lungs and sera of patient 1, and to a lesser extent in patient 2. Recently, a study reported the critical role of IRF3 in CD8+ T lymphocytes to promote IL-17 secretion. Indeed, IRF3 directly interacts with ROR\u03b3t (RAR-related orphan receptor gamma) and avoids the activation of the IL-17 promoter and the Th-17 differentiation of the T CD8+ lymphocytes[21]. Here we show that patient 1 did not express IRF3 in response to MERS-CoV and secreted low levels of IFN\u03b1 but high levels of IL-17, in the lungs and serum. Conversely, patient 2 expressed high levels of IRF3 (Figure 1C) that triggered IFN\u03b1 secretion in the lungs, but IL-17 secretion was decreased. IRF3 in humans exhibits high polymorphism[22] that may explain the difference between immune responses and outcomes of patients 1 and 2. Further investigations may be required and the sequencing of this key protein in our two patients may contribute to better understand host susceptibility to MERS-CoV infection.",

Our results suggest a key role of the interferon pathway. From this hypothesis, a treatment with alpha interferon represents an attractive pathophysiologic approach in this disease. Several authors suggest that coronaviruses could evade the host response and blunt the interferon pathway. Patients able to trigger IFN production could optimize viral clearance and develop a controlled immune response, while the absence of pathogen recognition could lead to viral replication and uncontrolled immune response (Figure 5). Administration of interferon could therefore enhance the host response. This molecule has been suggested in the recent review published by Momattin et al.[23].",
