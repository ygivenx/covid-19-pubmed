What is new about this virus is that it is unrelated to any swine influenza virus previously identified in North America. There is sustained human-to-human transmission in this new subtype of Influenza A virus [1]. It was termed Influenza A(H1N1) and 2009 H1N1 influenza by the United States Centre of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [2] and Pandemic H1N1/09 by the World Health Organization (WHO) [3]. The respiratory system is predominantly affected. Initial reported chest findings of A(H1N1) infections were bilateral diffuse lung opacities on chest radiographs (CXR). On computed tomography (CT), there were patchy ground glass opacities in both lungs with axial predominance and in the four lung quadrants consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome [4]. To date, there has been no published data on CXR findings of patients with A(H1N1) in Malaysia. The authors report the CXR findings of 118 patients with confirmed A(H1N1).",

The majority of these patients were walk-in patients to the Accident and Emergency Unit who presented with constitutional influenza-like symptoms of fever, myalgia and headache. Laboratory confirmation of pandemic influenza A(H1N1) was carried out using a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol and primers from the CDC [5], and virus isolation in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells.",

The chest radiographic images obtained from the 118 patients were reviewed by two staff radiologists, who have more than 10 years postgraduate experience, via consensus reading and the patterns recorded. Serial radiographs of patients with progressive clinical signs were also reviewed to assess disease progression and response to treatment by the Infectious Disease Unit team of doctors. Chest CT, which was performed on select cases based on severity and treatment response, were also read and the findings noted. The clinical data of the afflicted patients were obtained from the Hospital Infectious Disease Unit and compiled using Microsoft Office Excel (2003).",

Less common findings were round opacity (1/49), scattered focal air space opacity (4/49), linear opacities (2/49), linear opacities that progress to alveolar opacities (3/49), plethoric lungs (2/49), bronchiolitis (2/49) and pleural effusion (4/49). In the majority of patients (43/49), there was radiological improvement in the follow-up chest radiographs. Five had progressive alveolar consolidation ranging from 2 to 13 days with one developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) according to the American-European Consensus Conference (AECC) criteria. Five patients had CT done 2 days to 1 week after the last chest radiograph because they showed poor clinical response to initial treatment. Three were HRCT and the common findings were widespread interstitial shadowing, ground-glass change and atelectasis. These were not detected on plain chest radiographs.",

This is an increase of 24,373 cases and 191 deaths since September 20, 2009 [6]. In Malaysia, the first confirmed case was a 21-year-old student who returned from Newark, USA, on a Malaysia Airlines flight MH091 on May 15, 2009. He presented with typical influenza symptoms \u2013 fever, sore throat and body aches. The first death occurred on July 24, 2009, where a 30-year-old Indonesian student who returned to Malaysia from a holiday break in Medan on July 5 had progressive fever and cough and eventually died [8]. As of October 17, 2009, there had been 77 H1N1-related deaths in Malaysia [7]. This made Malaysia the 36th country worldwide to be affected by the virus.",
