This was contrary to the general idea that plague could only be transmitted by rats or fleas and could not be transmitted from person to person.

Dr. Wu was elected as president of the conference and his work on plague prevention was highly praised by all.

To honor him and to remember his contributions, bronze statues of Dr. Wu Lien Teh, were erected at Harbin Medical University. He remains unforgotten and his work continues to serve us, such as occurred when SARS suddenly broke out in 2003. We owe much to Dr. Wu, who saved many lives and whose contributions to modern medicine in China allow us to continue to do so today. On Dec 24th, 2015, to thanks to his great contributions, Wu Lie-Teh Institute was opened (Fig. 3), its aims are to research on infectious diseases and share the resulting knowledge to everyone. President of Wu Lie-Teh Institute, Harbin Medical University is Dr George Fu Gao, a member of Chinese Academy of Sciences, is also a fighter to some dangours viruses, such as Ebola virus, MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) and bird flu.",
