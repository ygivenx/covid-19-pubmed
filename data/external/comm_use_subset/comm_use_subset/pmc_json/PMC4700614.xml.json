Results from a study [19] showed that small hydrophobic nonstructural JEV proteins can influence membrane permeability. In that study, the JEV protein NS2B was found to have membrane-destabilizing activity (MDA) in all assays evaluated [19]. Furthermore, DENV also expresses the NS2B protein, and the NS2B proteins of JEV and DENV show conserved structural and functional characteristics. These characteristics include the hydrophilic segment, which is required for the cofactor activity of viral protease NS3, and the 3 hydrophobic regions that are thought to be responsible for membrane association and to generate the MDA. In addition, we previously demonstrated that NS2B is localized in cellular membranes (particularly in lipid rafts) due to the hydrophobic regions [20]. Data from a subsequent study suggested that the NS2B protein contains alpha-helical transmembrane domains that direct folds within micelles, indicating the ability of this protein to associate with membranes [21]. These lines of evidences suggest the possibility that NS2B of DENV may exert a function that is analogous to NS2B of JEV.",

Furthermore, comparative analysis between the DENV and JEV NS2B sequences revealed striking similarities. We also observed that the overexpression of recombinant NS2B in bacteria affected bacteria cell growth and enhanced bacterial membrane permeability to hygromycin B (HygB). In addition, crosslinking tests showed the ability to form oligomers; when recombinant NS2B was incubated with erythrocyte membrane systems, it produced organized structures within the membranes, which promoted the destabilization of the erythrocyte membrane and cell lysis. Therefore, this study represents the first investigation into the potential role of NS2B in causing changes in membrane permeability during DENV infection.",

In-silico analysis showed a 32 % identity between the sequences of the JEV and DENV NS2B proteins. In addition, this analysis identified some amino acids within the transmembrane regions that were identical or showed strong similarity, suggesting that they maintained the biochemical proprieties (Fig. 1a). Therefore, it is likely that the membrane-altering property of both viral NS2B proteins may be conserved. Thus, we generated hydropathy plots for the NS2B proteins using the Kyte\u2013Doolittle method. This analysis revealed 3 clear hydrophobic domains located in the amino terminal and carboxy terminus of NS2B, which may reflect the transmembrane regions present in this protein. The topology of DENV NS2B is similar to that described for JEV NS2B [19], for which 3 transmembrane regions were observed in the same positions along the amino acid sequence. In addition, aromatic and basic residues were identified in both sequences, which is an important characteristic of viral proteins with MDA (Fig. 1b). A topological representation of the NS2B protein was generated using the Socs MEMSAT program. The orientation of the 3 transmembrane regions was determined, showing that the amino and carboxyl-terminal domains were oriented towards the cytoplasm (Fig. 1c); these findings corroborate a previous report [34].",

This construct was used to transform E. coli BL21 Star cells. A clone harboring the NS2B expression vector was grown in culture and induced with IPTG 3, 6, and 9 h post-transformation (Fig. 2b). Thus, we decided to overexpress the NS2B protein. This protein was expressed in inclusion bodies, similarly to other viral proteins with viroporin activity [22, 23]. A 17-kDa band was observed by western blotting at 3, 6, and 9 h post-transformation, which was identified as the tagged NS2B protein using an anti-V5 antibody (Fig. 2c). In addition, we purified the NS2B protein using 2 strategies. The first strategy involved the induction of NS2B expression after 9 h (Fig. 2d, lane 1), which was partially purified by eluting a band of the appropriate mass (17 kDa) from a Coomassie Blue-stained gel (Fig. 2d, Lanes 2 and 3). NS2B was further purified with nickel resin via the N-terminal 6\u00d7 His tag on the recombinant NS2B protein (Fig. 2d, lanes 5 and 6). Several 1 mL-aliquots were eluted from the nickel resin, and Coomassie Blue staining revealed only the presence of the 17-kDa a band in the last fraction recovered.",

If the NS2B protein causes membrane destabilization, a widely known assay could be used to confirm this possibility. E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells, which express lysozyme, were transformed with a plasmid encoding NS2B. Disruptions in the inner bacterial membrane cause the release of the bacteriophage T7 lysozyme, which in turn promotes cell lysis that can be quantified by measuring the optical density of bacterial cultures. BL21(DE3) growth was not affected following transformation with the NS2B vector, in the presence or absence of IPTG (Fig. 4a). Bacterial growth was also unaffected in BL1(DE3)pLysS cultures transformed with the NS2B expression vector, or transformed with the parental vector pProEX in the absence of IPTG (NS2B expression not induced), when compared to negative control bacteria expressing the soluble polypyrimidine-tract-binding (PTB) protein (Fig. 4b). However, when NS2B expression was induced, bacterial growth was markedly inhibited compared to the PTB and pProEX controls (Fig. 4c). We also investigated whether NS2B expression altered the permeability of bacterial membranes, allowing entry of the translation inhibitor HygB. Thus, bacterial cultures were metabolically labeled with [S35]-methionine after the addition of HygB, under NS2B-inducing conditions. We observed that protein synthesis was completely inhibited in a time-dependent manner, indicating that the bacterial membranes became permeable to HygB following NS2B induction (Fig. 5a). However, no effect was observed with bacteria expressing an unrelated protein (PTB) in the absence or presence of HygB (Fig. 5b). These results strongly suggest that the NS2B protein associates with membranes, destabilizes their architecture, and allows the entrance of HygB.",

Another property shared by viroporins is their ability to oligomerize once inserted into cell membranes. Previous reports demonstrated that several viroporins could oligomerize in the presence of glutaraldehyde [24, 25]. To determine whether NS2B acts as a viroporin, we evaluated its ability to form homo-oligomers in vitro by chemical cross-linking. After the NS2B protein was incubated with increasing glutaraldehyde concentrations, western blots revealed the presence of 2 or 3 bands (Fig. 6a, lanes 1\u20133), which migrated at the expected position of monomers (17 kDa), dimers (34 kDa), and trimers (51 kDa). We hypothesized that upon membrane association of the NS2B protein, it oligomerizes to form structures similar to channel or pores that facilitate changes in membrane permeability. For this the hemolytic activity of NS2B was assayed in human erythrocytes, which are an efficient model for studying protein-membrane interactions, as well as changes in membrane permeability [26, 27] Erythrocytes were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h with various concentrations of NS2B or the negative-control PTB protein, and hemolysis levels were measured in supernatants following centrifugation. The NS2B protein showed hemolytic activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6b). Approximately 20 % of the erythrocytes were lysed when exposed to 100 \u03bcg of purified NS2B protein, while at lower quantities, the lytic activity was reduced. In contrast, hemolysis did not occur following incubation with the same concentrations of the control protein. These results suggested that the NS2B protein associated with erythrocyte membranes to form structured oligomers and caused cell lysis in a concentration-dependent manner.",

Base on this finding, we analyzed the presence of the NS2B protein in erythrocyte ghost membranes by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). This analysis revealed the presence of ring-shaped structures, the number of which was dependent on the NS2B concentration used (Fig. 7). Ring-shaped structures were not identified in erythrocytes ghosts maintained in PBS or in the presence of albumin (Fig. 7a). Analysis of these structures showed circular ring structures were also commonly associated with the membranes. These structures were similar to those observed with other viral proteins with viroporin activity. [28]. Rings with sizes between 30 and 40 nm in diameter were most frequently found, although larger structures were detected using a higher NS2B quantity (100 \u03bcg), as shown in Fig. 7b. The number of ring-shaped structures per square micron increased according the amount of NS2B used (Fig. 7c). Finally, it was confirmed that the increase in the number of ring-shaped structures at the higher NS2B quantity correlated with increased lytic activity observed in the hemolysis assays (Fig. 7c). Our results provide the first direct evidence that the NS2B protein can oligomerize in mammalian membranes and that it possesses pore-forming activity that modifies membrane permeability with lytic effects on the target membrane, as reported for other viroporins.",

During the dengue viral cycle, cell membranes are critical elements for the entrance, translation, replication, and assembly of viruses. As infection progresses, several viral proteins can disturb cell membrane structures. According to previous reports, DENV proteins promote cellular membranes reorganization, although the functions of their small hydrophobic proteins have not been studied enough in this regard. Different reports have identified a potential role that these proteins may exert on several membrane systems, such as identifying membranotropic regions, or its association with artificial membranes [31, 32]. However, it has not been determined if any of these proteins can promote changes in membrane permeability. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine if the hydrophobic NS2B protein possesses viroporin activity, considering that this protein was expressed in membranes. We and others previously showed that this protein is present in cell membranes, particularly lipid rafts [20]. A bioinformatics study performed with the NS2B sequence revealed a high degree of homology with a previously reported viroporin for a member of the Flaviviridae family [19]. Previous in vitro results using microsomal membranes also showed that the cleavage products NS2B and NS3 (Pro) were membrane-associated. Furthermore, this membrane requirement was due to the presence of hydrophobic regions predicted in NS2B and found in lipid rafts in the ER [20, 21].",

In prokaryotic systems such as E. coli, the NS2B protein was effective in inducing sensitivity to HygB under the conditions used. In addition, changes in permeability to HygB and alterations of bacterial growth may exert a direct effect on the incorporation of NS2B within bacterial membranes, leading to lost membrane integrity.

            "text": "Another important feature of viroporins is that they can oligomerize; therefore, great efforts have been taken to understand the architecture of these proteins [34, 35]. In silico analysis of the NS2B sequence showed the presence of 3 transmembrane regions, which may be important for membrane insertion or oligomerization. Chemical cross-linking experiments performed with glutaraldehyde revealed that NS2B could oligomerize into trimeric species under reducing conditions; however, in the absence of glutaraldehyde, dimers were also observed. The above data strongly suggest that the intermolecular associations observed do not depend on disulfide bridges. Instead, NS2B dimer and trimer formation may depend upon and hydrophobic interactions, as observed with other viroporins [24, 36]. NS2B oligomers may organize into pore structures in cell membranes, which would account for the membrane permeability alterations observed. Various systems have been employed to study these phenomena, such as dye-loaded liposomes, Xenopus oocytes, and unilamellar membranes. We employed 2 strategies to characterize these structures. In hemolysis assays, we showed that the NS2B protein in contact with human erythrocytes modified the membrane permeability, promoting the release of hemoglobin. To further address this issue, we performed TEM studies to determine whether the NS2B protein integrates into biological membranes and forms pores in the target membrane (erythrocyte ghosts). Electron micrographs showed a distribution of ring-shaped structures of variable sizes that were similar those observed for other viroporins. These ring-shaped structures increased in a dose-dependent manner with the quantity of NS2B protein added. In addition, they were absent in membrane controls maintained in PBS or in presence of albumin. These data strongly suggest that NS2B directly contacts and modifies the membrane structure.",

Future studies are necessary to assess whether the effect of the protein NS2B in these model membranes occur in the context of infection with DENV. However, it is important to mention that the protein NS2B, similar to other small hydrophobic viral proteins, is actively transported to vesicles where replication complexes are formed. The presence of pores in these vesicles has been reported [37] to facilitate the process of viral-genome packing. The origin of these pores is unknown, although it is likely that NS2B could participate in these processes.",
