The viral envelope is a lipid bilayer enbedded with three viral transmembrane proteins: the matrix (M), envelope (E) and spike (S) proteins. The genomic RNA of SARS-CoV is protected and packaged by the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein by forming a helical structure of ribonucleoprotein complex within the viral envelope. In addition, the physical interaction between the N and M proteins might be necessary for the assembly of coronavirus [4,5,6]. ",

The main functions of N protein are two folds: 1) it binds to viral genomic RNA for the formation of viral nucleocapsid; 2) it also self-associates into polymer that might be critical for the helical structure formation [7]. Protein structural study reveals that the SARS-CoV N protein contains two structural domains flanked by intrinsically disordered (ID) regions [8]. The N terminal domain (NTD, amino acid residues 45\u2013181) can bind non-specifically to a variety of nucleotide substrates [9] and functions as a putative RNA binding domain associated with the viral RNA genome [10], whereas the C terminal domain (CTD, amino acid residues 248\u2013365) is thought to be responsible for the dimerized self-association [8,11]. However, recent studies show that the C terminal sequence of N protein also promotes higher ordered oligomerization and is able to interact with nucleic acids as well [7,12]. Moreover, Chang demonstrated that all ID sequences are able to bind RNA [13], indicating that the multisite nucleic acid binding property of SARS-CoV N protein may have an inherent advantage to promote the formation of viral helical nucleocapsid core.

            "text": "SARS-CoV N protein is believed to be one of the major pathological determinants in the host cells [14]. Therefore, down-regulating N protein expression by the small interference RNA (siRNA) approach might be good strategy to reverse the virus-induced damage to the host and may help development of a more effective therapeutic means to control viral transmission. siRNA is a type of RNA molecule with 21-25nt in length that functions post-transcriptionally to down-regulate the targeted gene expression. SARS-CoV N gene specific siRNAs have been designed and investigated by a number of groups, and at least 23 targeted sites of N gene specific siRNAs have been selected and tested [20,21,22,23,24]. Sequence analysis indicates that all these known siRNAs are located at 2/3 of the 5\u2019 N gene sequence (within first 860nt out of the total 1269nt). Nucleotide substitution and deletion mutations can be frequently recovered from the first 440nt sequence of N gene. Therefore, these sequence alterations may have a potential to weaken the effect of siRNA mediated gene silencing. In the current study, we compared the N gene sequences derived from 16 different isolates of SARS-CoV and selected three novel siRNA targeting sites in the N gene, including one targeting the 3\u2019 terminus of the gene. Functional analysis indicates that all three novel siRNAs are effective in downregulating N gene expression. Moreover, our study demonstrates that SARS-CoV N gene is able to up-regulate the M gene mediated interferon \u03b2 production, while the N gene specific siRNA can effectively reduce this up-regulation.",

SARS-CoV is a positive single-stranded RNA virus frequently associated with sequence alterations during viral transmission. A better siRNA should be designed to target the conserved region in the targeted sequence. To this end, we randomly selected the N genes derived from 16 different isolates of SARS-CoV: HKU-39849 (AY278491), Tor2 (AY274119), BJ02 (AY278487), HZS2-FB (AY394987), ZJ01 (AY297028), Sin2748 (AY283797), ShanghaiQXC1 (AY463059), ShanghaiQXC2(AY463060), CUHK-AG01 (AY345986), PUMC01 (AY350750), GZ-B (AY394978), TC1 (AY338174), GZ-C (AY394979), ZS-C (AY95003), LC1 (AY394998.1) and LC5(AY395002.1). ClustalW analysis revealed that a total of five sequence alterations (two sequence deletions and three nucleotide substitutions) occurred in the N gene in these isolates (Figure 1). Interestingly, sequence alterations in the N gene are frequently uncovered in the 5\u2019 portion of the gene (within the first 440nt), which is similar to our previous observation on SARS-CoV M gene [25]. However, different from the M gene mutation, which is associated with single nucleotide substitution, the N gene mutation tends to be larger in size, such as twelve nucleotide deletions (nt14-25) and di-nucleotide substitutions (nt419-420, Figure 1). The N gene also possesses two additional single nucleotide substitutions (nt74 and nt1128) and one single nucleotide deletion (nt384). ",

Considering the nucleotide substitutions in N gene as well as the previous reports, we chose three unexploited regions that were well conserved in the N genes among the 16 isolates of SARS-CoV. The selected targeted sites were at +213~+233nt, +863~+883nt and +1240~+1260nt relative to the 5\u2019 ATG initiation codon, and their respective siRNAs were named as si-N213, si-N863 and si-N1240 (Figure 1). A known siRNA (named si-N#16, previous name No.16 in reference [21]) that targeted the 5\u2019 terminus (+7~+27nt) of N gene was also constructed for control purposes. ",

The expression of N gene was confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis (Figure 2a and 2b). To visualize the subcellular localization of N protein, N gene was also fused with EGFP to make a pEGFP-Np fusion gene construct. After transfection into HEK293 cells, EGFP-Np fusion protein was mainly distributed in the cytoplasm (Figure 2c). Alternatively, HEK293 cells transfected with pCMV-Myc-Np were subjected to immunostaining analysis.

Also, it has been shown that INF\u03b2 gene expression and transcription could be inhibited by SARS-CoV infection, probably due to the presence of N gene products [27]. To detect the influence of N gene on M mediated INF\u03b2 production, N and M were co-transfected into HEK293 cells. Interestingly, we found that the N gene was not able to inhibit, but rather enhanced M gene mediated INF\u03b2 mRNA production (Figure 8a). Addition of si-N213, si-N863 or si-N1240 in the co-transfection system significantly reduced INF\u03b2 mRNA production (Figure 8a). The semi-quantitative RT-PCR result was further confirmed by using real time qRT-PCR analysis (Figure 8b), indicating that the identified N gene specific siRNA could functionally counteract the N gene mediated cellular processes.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV N gene has long been selected as one of the major targets for siRNA design. However, genomic alterations such as nucleotide deletion and substitution frequently occur in SARS-CoV. This type of change has the potential to weaken the inhibitory effect induced by siRNA. In the current study we analyzed the N gene sequences derived from 16 different isolates and found that in addition to single nucleotide substitutions, the N gene also possesses a longer nucleotide deletion and di-nucleotide substitution. Previous studies on M gene specific siRNAs indicate that the siRNA targeting site and its surrounding sequences may influence the inhibitory effect [25]. The current study further support this observation by showing that si-N#16, which targets a twelve nucleotide deletion region in the N gene of one viral strain generates a less inhibitory effect than that of either si-N213 or si-N863 (Figure 7b). Although N gene specific siRNA has been intensively studied, no siRNA was reported for the last 410nt sequence. In this study, we created and tested a third siRNA (si-N1240) which was effective to target the 3\u2019 terminal sequence of N gene and subsequently in downregulating N gene expression. Interestingly, the inhibitory effect induced by si-N1240 was similar to that of si-N#16, implying that siRNAs targeting at both the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 terminal sequences of the isolated N gene might induce less inhibition. We also notice that there might be a discrepancy between our study and a previous report by Shi et al. in which they demonstrated that si-N#16 (No.16) was the strongest inhibitor among the eleven N gene siRNAs tested [21]. This discrepancy might be due to: 1) the potential structural difference between vector expressed N mRNA and virus derived subgenomic N mRNAs and/or 2) the differences in the expression system used by us (pBS/U6) versus Shi\u2019s (chemical synthesized siRNAs). Finally, we provide evidence to show that SARS-CoV N gene products were able to up-regulate M gene mediated INF\u03b2 production, while N gene specific siRNA could functionally reduce this enhancement. However, the mechanism underlining N gene mediated INF\u03b2 production remains an interesting point to be further addressed. ",
