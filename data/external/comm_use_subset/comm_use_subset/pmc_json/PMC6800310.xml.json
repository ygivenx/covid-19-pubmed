Early work with IAV determined that infectivity was best maintained at lower RH conditions.11 Noti et al also conducted experiments using simulated coughs and demonstrated that IAV aerosol infectivity was maximized at low RH.12 Furthermore, Lowen et al suggested that IAV transmission is highest at low RH, moderate at high RH (65%), and lowest at an intermediate RH (50%) using the guinea pig model.10 In addition, the range of RH may vary significantly depending on climate (temperate vs tropical) and setting (health care vs agricultural or wet markets). The overall effect of RH on IAV infectivity and transmission is still under investigation, but the effective performance of bioaerosol sampling devices at a range of RH is important for characterizing virus\u2010laden bioaerosols under different conditions.",

Early experiments indicated that influenza virus\u2013infected ferrets treated with antipyretic compounds experienced increased nasal shedding, potentially leading to increased risk of transmission.13 Mathematical modeling from Earn et al suggested that antipyretic use increases the infectious period and contact time with influenza virus\u2013infected individuals, increasing the population\u2010level transmission risk.14 The ubiquitous use of NSAIDs among patients with influenza\u2010like symptoms underscores the importance of determining whether an association between NSAID use and emission of influenza virus into the air exists, and extension of host emission and sampling studies to determine whether NSAIDs could alter viral shedding represents important opportunities to fill this knowledge gap.",

Bioaerosol sampling devices are essential to the investigation and characterization of IAV bioaerosol emissions and transmission. Many sampling devices have been employed to collect a number of different pathogens but were not explicitly designed for the collection of viruses and preservation of viral infectivity. The selection of a suitable bioaerosol sampling device is challenging since collection efficiency is influenced by the pathogen in question, sampler flow rate, the environment, sampling time, and other technical and operational aspects of each device. Other factors such as cost and ease of use also influence device selection. Currently, there is no prevailing standard for the selection of a bioaerosol sampling device.",

Ferrets were anesthetized with isoflurane and inoculated intranasally with 1 mL Cal/09 at 106 PFU diluted in PBS, then placed in a Caron 6030 environmental test chamber (environmental chamber; 58 \u00d7 65.5 \u00d7 75.7 cm; Figure 1B) at 20\u00b0C and 20% RH. For experiments using NSAIDs, animals were injected daily with PBS (untreated) or meloxicam (0.1\u20100.2 mg/kg, treated) subcutaneously (n = 4 per group). The selection of meloxicam was based on its safety and tolerability in ferrets. Four ferrets were present in the environmental chamber and infected with influenza virus at a time. Rectal temperature and body weight were recorded, and animals were nasal\u2010washed with 2 mL of PBS under isoflurane anesthesia on days 1, 3, 5 and 7 post\u2010inoculation (p.i.) as previously described.42 Bioaerosol sampling of either untreated or treated groups of ferrets was conducted after the environmental chamber was undisturbed for a minimum of 6 hours. The PTFE filter and NIOSH cyclone sampler were used on days 1, 3, 5, and 7 p.i. at 3.5 L/min \u00b1 5% for 2 hours, and the Andersen impactor was used on days 2, 4, 6, and 8 p.i. at 28.3 L/min for 30 minutes; petri dishes were filled with viral transport media (VTM; 1X P/S, 0.5% BSA, DMEM\u2010F12) to the appropriate height specified for proper size fractionation and placed in each stage of the Andersen impactor.

The PTFE filter and NIOSH cyclone sampler recovered RNA and infectious H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses under different RH conditions and from influenza virus\u2013infected ferrets. This evidence combined with their cost\u2010effective nature and user\u2010friendly design makes the PTFE filter and NIOSH cyclone sampler good candidates for the detection of influenza virus\u2013laden bioaerosols in multiple settings.

The ratios of collected viral RNA to infectious virus for both the PTFE filter and NIOSH cyclone sampler are slightly higher than the ratio for the nebulizer (3.66 \u00d7 103 copies/PFU), indicating a potential loss of infectivity during the aerosolization and collection process or due to other factors that may disrupt the viral envelope or otherwise affect infectivity. Despite this potential loss, both bioaerosol samplers recorded similar ratios, indicating their comparable ability to collect infectious virus. Both samplers were also able to collect as much as 104 PFU of virus. Previous work has suggested that dry sampling or sampling onto a dry surface such as a filter may limit the ability of bioaerosol samplers to collect infectious virus,17 but our work indicates that under certain environmental conditions, it is possible to do so with dry or filter sampling, despite loss of infectivity due to aerosolization and/or sampling processes.",

Our data show RH had some effect on the ability of the PTFE filter and NIOSH cyclone sampler to detect viral RNA and infectious virus. A significant decrease in H3N2 influenza virus RNA collected by the NIOSH cyclone sampler at medium RH is in keeping with the results shown by Lowen et al and further demonstrates the influence of increasing RH on the collection of IAV from bioaerosols. The PTFE filter collected virus well under low and medium RH conditions but became saturated with liquid under high RH, representing a potential limitation. The NIOSH cyclone sampler performed similarly, but saturation was not a factor at high RH; viral RNA and infectious virus were collected across all RH conditions. High RHs can inhibit bioaerosol sampling devices through saturation with liquid, potentially affecting the ability to sample in tropical climates or humid environments such as sometimes seen in swine barns or poultry markets. Furthermore, there were variable quantities of viral RNA and infectious virus from particles collected by the NIOSH cyclone sampler during high RH conditions, potentially reflecting enhanced but varying degrees of virus aggregation and highlighting the difficulty of recovering material under these conditions. RH may influence both the characteristics of aerosolized viral particles as well as sampler performance, and unfortunately, we cannot be certain what the relative contribution of each potential factor is to the net collection of virus using an in vitro experimental system. The effect of RH on infectivity was further demonstrated in a study looking at IAV droplets in various saline solutions. The authors found that viability was lowest at 50%\u201099% RH and suspected these conditions led to ongoing evaporation, which increased salt concentrations to levels that are potentially harmful to the virus.56 In addition, the different effects of RH on H3N2 and H1N1 subtypes could not be adequately explored with the static system we employed, although others have recently done so.56\n",

This environment is a controlled setting intended to reflect collection from emitting hosts. We found that the PTFE filter and NIOSH cyclone sampler were capable of collecting infectious virus from both groups of influenza virus\u2013infected ferrets on day 3 p.i. The Andersen impactor collected impressive amounts of viral RNA, but no infectious virus was detected. This instrument collects at a higher flow rate (28.3 L/min) and has the ability to size fractionate particles, which are enticing attributes when choosing a bioaerosol sampler. However, the difficulties with maneuvering the apparatus with liquid media while inside the environmental chamber make it vulnerable to pump damage. The Andersen impactor is therefore best suited for controlled, experimental settings. Contrary to the Andersen impactor, the PTFE filter and NIOSH cyclone samplers were easy to manipulate inside the environmental chamber (compact, lightweight, few parts). These devices can be fixed to walls for static sampling or worn by personnel for personal breathing zone sampling. These attributes combined with the ability to collect viral RNA, and infectious virus makes these samplers more feasible for assessing the burden of influenza virus in the air in various settings, and more conducive for use in multicenter studies.",

Following inoculation with influenza virus, ferrets experienced significant weight loss and typical shedding patterns. Although statistical significance could not be determined, all three bioaerosol samplers captured higher levels of viral RNA and infectious virus from the meloxicam\u2010treated group compared to their untreated counterparts. This indicates a potential enhancement of influenza virus bioaerosol production after NSAID treatment through an unknown mechanism, and could play a significant role during influenza epidemics and pandemics due to the widespread use of NSAIDs such as ibuprofen.59 Transmission was not tested in this study since this would have halved the number of inoculated animals and significantly increased the variability in recovery of viral RNA and infectious virus, further limiting statistical analysis. Extensive work is still needed to better understand the relationship between NSAIDs and influenza virus replication and transmission to determine whether their use actually contributes to the spread of influenza virus.",

The use of liquid media instead of solid agar in the plates of the Andersen impactor may also be problematic since the volume of liquid or agar present in each plate is critical for proper size fractionation of particles and the potential loss of liquid during the collection process may lead to a misrepresentation of particle size distribution. Kormuth et al recently demonstrated the limited influence of RH on the infectivity of physiologically relevant fine aerosols and droplets,60 and in our study, virus for aerosolization was diluted in saline lacking physiological components of the extracellular matrix. Also, the evaluation of these samplers did not include characterization of precise performance parameters of each device, including limit of collection. An ultraviolet aerodynamic particle sizer (UV\u2010APS) would be required to accurately determine sampling efficiency.

It is not commercially available and requires time for processing and decontamination but can be used for personal sampling and whenever particle size fractionation is desired in clinical and environmental settings.

The PTFE filter is extremely versatile; it can be used in clinical and environmental settings, for both personal sampling and static sampling.
