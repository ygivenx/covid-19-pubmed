Direct activation of interferon-stimulated genes enhances na\u00efve T-cell survival through increased Bcl-2 and reduced Bax activation [7] and contributes to clonal expansion of antigen-specific T-cells [8]. Recent data suggest that early therapeutic intervention with pegylated IFN\u03b1 rescues polyfunctional memory T-cells expressing high levels of the IL-7 receptor alpha chain (CD127) and Bcl-2, allowing a higher rate of sustained viral response [9]. However, despite good efficacy, IFN\u03b1-based therapies lead to sustained anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and lymphocytopenia [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. Moreover, pegylated IFN\u03b1 therapy enhances the risk of infection in older HCV-infected patients and HIV-infected individuals, independently from neutropenia [15], [16], [17].",

            "text": "Others and we have documented a strong reduction in the ability of HIV-infected patients to sustain thymic production as a direct consequence of a drop in intrathymic precursor T-cell proliferation [23], [24], [25]. Similar thymic impact was also seen during early SIV-infection in the rhesus macaque model [26]. The capacity of the thymus to produce recent thymic emigrants (RTEs) is, in large part, dependent on thymocyte proliferation [27]. Indeed, extensive thymocyte proliferation occurs between T-cell receptor beta (TCRB) and alpha (TCRA) chain rearrangements. The extent of this proliferation directly correlates with thymic export [28]. The extent of cell proliferation in the thymus can be measured in patients through estimating, in peripheral blood cells, the ratio (sj/\u03b2TREC ratio) between the frequency of signal joint T-cell receptor excision circles (sjTREC), produced during the excision of the TCR\u03b4 locus prior to TCR\u03b1 chain rearrangement, and that of D\u03b2J\u03b2TREC T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) produced during TCRBD to TCRBJ rearrangement [29]. These by-products of TCR rearrangement processes are generated by the circularization of the chromosomal DNA excised during TCR rearrangements respectively occurring at the DN3 (D\u03b2J\u03b2TREC) and DP (sjTREC) stages of differentiation. Due to the fact that TRECs do not replicate during mitosis, increased proliferation between DN3 and DP leads to the reduction of D\u03b2J\u03b2TREC frequency in RTEs as compared to sjTREC frequency and consequently to an increase of the sj/\u03b2TREC ratio [23]. The correlation between initial plasma IFN\u03b1 levels and the speed of thymic dysfunction observed during HIV primary infection suggested that IFN\u03b1, produced as part of the innate immune response to infection, participates in the impairment of thymopoiesis. However, no direct evidence of the relationship between IFN\u03b1 production and thymic dysfunction was provided by these studies. In contrast, Arizcorreta and colleagues showed that IFN\u03b1 and ribavirin therapy induces a substantial reduction of circulating sjTRECs, in HIV/HCV co-infected patients, accompanied by sustained na\u00efve CD4+ T-cell defect, suggesting thymic dysfunction [10]. Similarly, in the SIV-infected rhesus macaque model, we showed that IFN\u03b1 therapy induced a strong decrease of circulating RTE numbers as defined either by sjTREC frequency and numbers or by CD31hi expression on na\u00efve T-cells [30]. Interestingly, in these animals, recombinant interleukin (IL)-7 therapy more than abrogated the deleterious effects of IFN\u03b1 therapy [30].",

It allows cell survival during the rearrangement processes, and is implicated in the extensive thymocyte proliferation, in particular in intermediate single positive (ISP) and early DP cells [31], [32], [33], [34]. This proliferation participates in the development of na\u00efve T-cell diversity [35]. While up regulated by IFN\u03b1 [36], [37], the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor P27/Kip1 is negatively regulated by IL-7 [38], allowing ISP and early DP thymocytes to proliferate. Moreover, IFN\u03b1 also inhibit IL-7 dependent proliferation through down modulation of the common \u03b3 chain, that participates, together with CD127 to the IL-7 receptor [39]. We here investigated the early impact of IFN\u03b1 therapy on thymic function and na\u00efve T-cell homeostasis in both HCV-infected and HIV/HCV co-infected patients who started IFN\u03b1 therapy.",

            "text": "Interestingly, both sjTREC quantification (sjTREC/mL) and intrathymic precursor T-cell proliferation (sj/\u03b2TREC ratio) were affected very early on after initiation of therapy (Figures 2B and 3B). While sjTREC frequency and concentration in peripheral blood can be affected by modifications of parameters that impact on peripheral T-cell homeostasis (cycling, survival/apoptosis, homing), the sj/\u03b2TREC ratio is a marker of the intrathymic proliferation history of RTEs. Indeed, this parameter is generated by cell proliferation that occurs between TCR\u03b2 chain rearrangement and the excision of TCR\u03b4 locus. Further cell cycling after TCR\u03b1 chain rearrangement does not modify the sj/\u03b2TREC ratio as both type of TRECs are similarly diluted upon cell proliferation. Accordingly, while exported to the periphery, the sj/\u03b2TREC ratio of mature T-cells cannot be modified. Therefore, while the observed decrease in sjTREC concentration (figure 2) can be a consequence of modifications of circulating T-cell homeostasis, the decline of the sj/\u03b2TREC ratio observed during the first months of IFN\u03b1 therapy (figure 3) defines changes in thymocyte proliferation, thus in thymic output [28]. Acutely infected patients demonstrated a higher sj/\u03b2TREC ratio at baseline than patients in the chronic phase. However, this group was younger (Median = 31.5 (26\u201347)) versus Median = 53.5 (37\u201361)) than the chronic group (p<0.01; data not shown) and demonstrated normal sj/\u03b2TREC ratio for their age. Similar evolution of thymic function and circulating T-cell subsets were observed in both groups of HCV-infected patients, irrespective of the development stage of HCV pathology. The lack of effect of IFN\u03b1 therapy in HIV/HCV co-infected patients might be due to the fact that, as expected for chronically HIV-infected individuals, these patients already had a low thymic function at study entry. The impairment of thymopoiesis in HCV-infected patients under IFN\u03b1 therapy is reminiscent of that observed during the acute phase of HIV-1 infection [23] which suggested that long term production of IFN\u03b1, as part of the anti-HIV innate immune response, may play a role in the observed thymic defect. The correlation between decline in IL-7 plasma levels under IFN\u03b1 therapy and both thymic dysfunction and reduced T-cell counts, in particular in the na\u00efve and RTE compartments (Figures 5A and 5B), confirms this hypothesis. Finally, in a recent study, we showed that IFN\u03b1 treatment leads to decreased sjTREC frequency as well as reduced na\u00efve T-cell and RTE counts in SIV-infected rhesus macaques [30]. Such an effect was accompanied by a 30\u201340% decrease in IL-7 plasma levels in these animals and could be counteracted by injection of recombinant simian IL-7 [30]. One could expect that such an effect of type I IFNs is not restricted to HIV-infection as many viral infections induce IFN\u03b1 responses and cause transient lymphocytopenia in the infected hosts [3], [4], [5], [6]. Moreover, the IFN\u03b1-induced reduction of thymic function and its probable consequences on na\u00efve T-cell diversity may contribute to the higher infectious risk associated with IFN\u03b1 therapy, in particular observed in older patients [15], [16], [44]. There are multiple sources for circulating IL-7 during viral infections including lymphoid organs, epithelial cells and recently the liver was identified as a major source of IL-7. Moreover, increased plasma IL-7 levels can also be observed during viral infection in non-lymphopenic individuals ([33] and unpublished data), suggesting a role in the development of immune responses. Indeed, this cytokine participates to T-cell homing in various lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues through stimulation of local chemokine productions [45]. Increased IL-7 plasma levels in lymphopenic individuals is likely due to reduced consumption [46] yet augmented production to counteract lymphopenia cannot be excluded [33]. The recent identification of the liver as an IL-7 producing tissue upon TLR stimulation [47] makes it tempting to speculate that HCV-infection can also, through TLR activation, stimulate IL-7 production by the liver. Indeed, non-lymphopenic HCV-infected patients demonstrate similar IL-7 plasma levels than lymphopenic HIV-infected individuals [33], [48] suggesting that most of the IL-7 production in untreated HCV-infected patients was not linked to circulating T-cell counts. The reduction of IL-7 plasma levels while lymphocytopenia establishes under IFN\u03b1 therapy, the absence of a correlation between IL-7 plasma levels and CD127 expression and the concomitance of decreases in IL-7 plasma levels and HCV viral load under therapy suggest that viremia might be driving IL-7 production before initiation of therapy. Our data suggest that, before initiation of IFN\u03b1 therapy, actively replicating HCV leads to the overproduction of IL-7. Subsequent reduction of IL-7 production upon initiation of therapy probably reflects the elimination of IL-7 producing HCV-infected hepatocytes. This sudden reduction of IL-7 plasma levels may lead to diminished thymopoiesis. The fact that IL-7 plasma levels did not reach normal levels when HCV became undetectable may suggest that, after the initial decline that follows the drop in viremia, IL-7 plasma levels were regulated, as in HIV-infected patients [33] and in IFN\u03b1-treated SIV-infected rhesus macaques [30], as a consequence of lymphocytopenia through either reduced consumption or increased production in lymphoid organs [49]. Future studies with a longer follow-up period, in particular after the end of IFN\u03b1 therapy and recovery from lymphocytopenia are required to further elucidate this point.",

This effect directly paralleled IFN\u03b1-induced lymphocytopenia and decreased IL-7 plasma levels, initially high in HCV-infected patients. These data suggest that IL-7 production by the liver, a consequence of active HCV replication, was reduced while patients controlled HCV viremia. Restricted IL-7 plasma levels might, in association with the anti-proliferative effect of IFN\u03b1, limit T-cell production in the thymus. Our study highlights the therapeutic potential of IL-7 as a complement to the standard IFN\u03b1 based treatment to help HCV-infected patients to sustain normal circulating T-cell counts, and restore the diversity of the peripheral T-cell repertoire through its central thymopoietic effect. Restoring the breadth and intensity of T-cell control over the HCV virus might be immediately beneficial for the HIV/HCV co-infected population and offer new promising avenues for chronic HCV in the context of massive drop of HCV viral load after short term treatment with new antiviral compounds that will continue to be administered in combination with IFN\u03b1 [50].",

A summary of the virological and immunological status of patients at baseline is shown in table 1. All the HIV/HCV co-infected patients but one were under HAART with undetectable viremia (<40 HIV copies/mL). Chronically infected patients (C-9 to C-16 and I-1 to I-10) initiated pegylated IFN\u03b1/ribavirin treatment (IFN\u03b1-2a: Pegasys, 180 \u03bcg weekly, Ribavirin: Copegus, 800 mg to 1000 \u03bcg daily) and were followed over a 4 months period. Patients included in the acute phase of HCV infection (C-1 to C-8) were treated with pegylated IFN\u03b1 (IFN\u03b1-2a: Pegasys, Roche, 180 \u03bcg weekly) [51], [52]. Blood samples were taken monthly on EDTA. Two milliliters of total blood were 2-fold diluted in FCS/20%DMSO frozen at \u221280\u00b0C and conserved in liquid nitrogen. These total blood samples were subsequently used for flow cytometry analyses. Plasma was separated from the remaining eight milliliters and mononuclear cells were purified on Ficoll Hypaque (Eurobio, Courtaboeuf, France) and frozen for further analyses. Patients from the HCV mono-infection group were followed at the Centre de Recherche du CHUM, H\u00f4pital Saint Luc, Montreal, QC, Canada and its collaborators as previously described [9], [53]. Patients from the HIV-HCV groups were followed at the H\u00f4pital Henri Mondor, Creteil, France. Clinical protocols conformed to ethical guidelines of the authors' institutions and the US Department of Health and Human Services' human experimentation guidelines. This study was approved by both the Ethical committee of Centre Hospitalier de l'Universit\u00e9 de Montreal (CHUM) and the ethical committee of H\u00f4pital Henri Mondor, Cr\u00e9teil, France.
