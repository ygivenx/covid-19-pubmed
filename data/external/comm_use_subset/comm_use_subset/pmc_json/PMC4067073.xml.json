            "text": "The 2009 H1N1 pandemic H1N1 influenza (flu) A (pdmH1N1) was first reported in Mexico and California [1]. As the virus spread globally, it became evident that the infection was of moderate severity with a broad clinical spectrum of symptoms [2]. Early data from Mexico suggested that pdmH1N1 may cause severe respiratory illness in otherwise healthy young and middle-aged people [3]. It is now estimated that in the United States pdmH1N1 caused higher rates of hospitalizations and deaths in children and adults 18\u201364 years of age than the flu of the previous season, but lower rates of clinical events in adults over 65 years of age [4]. This finding supports the notion that previous exposures to H1N1 in older individuals provides higher cross-protective immune responses than in younger individuals [5]. In the autumn of 2009, pdmH1N1 vaccines (pdm vaccines) were available across the globe, it was estimated that pdmH1N1 vaccination prevented 4,000\u201310,000 hospitalizations and 200\u2013500 deaths in the US [6].",

            "text": "There are several unanswered questions concerning H1N1 flu infection and vaccination. Firstly, the impact of previous immune responses induced by flu vaccinations or by flu exposures on the ability to mount new anti-flu immune responses [7-9]. It is therefore of interest to map the adaptive humoral and cellular immune response prior to vaccination and prior to the onset of flu symptoms. Secondly, the differential quality and quantity of humoral and cellular immune responses directed against flu targets, induced either by flu vaccination or by flu infection, has not been well defined. Thirdly, several reports have discussed a \u2018silent infection\u2019 with H1N1 (in non-vaccinated participants), yet the real extent of such a silent infection is difficult to determine\u2014in part due to cross-reacting antibodies (Abs) (from previous exposures or vaccines) [10]. Antibodies, as well as CD4+ and cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell immune responses, play a critical role in the host defense against flu [11,12]. Increased cellular reactivity to flu, defined by IFN-\u03b3 production\u2014a key cytokine in the pro-inflammatory response to flu\u2014in participants who have not experienced influenza-like (ILI) symptoms, has not been determined up to now, this may help to identify silent flu infection.",

Prepaid envelopes and nasal swabs were provided to participants after they had received instructions at the LifeGene study centres before study entry. Participants contacted the LG centres at the onset of ILI symptoms, filled out a questionnaire and mailed the (viral) swab for PCR analysis as described in detail in the supplementary data sets. If swabs tested positive for flu or coronavirus RNA, a home visit was payed during which an additional nasal swab and a blood sample from the index study participant and the household members was obtained. (The mean time between the first swab and the home visit was 2.5 weeks). The study was approved by the Ethics committee Stockholm south review board (DN 2009/1183-31) and each study participant provided informed consent. Swedish residents were offered the pdm vaccine Pandemrix (GSK) containing A/ H1N1/California/7/2009 (with AS03 adjuvant, i.e. DL-\u03b1-tocopherol, squalene and polysorbate).",

The whole-blood antigen (WBA) stimulation assay measures the \u2018net\u2019 IFN-\u03b3 production elaborated by CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells in whole blood and reflects the activity of memory T-cell responses.

They were used at a final concentration of 2.5 \u03bcg/mL HA. We also tested the flu matrix antigens M1 and M2 present as peptides, and used at a final concentration of 1 \u03bcg/mL. As control, we used the CFP-10 antigen from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We could not include the A/H1N1/California/7/2009 antigens in the cellular assays, since the test plates had to be prepared in advance due to quality control issues to ensure batch-to-batch consistency; the pdmH1N1 antigen preparation was not yet available in the summer of 2009 and the assay worked only with freshly obtained heparinised blood.

For 41 study participants, a positive H1N1 or coronavirus PCR (for controls) triggered a home visit from a nurse to study the immune response at an early time point. The final step (spring 2010) is designated time point \u2018C\u2019, where 918 study participants (46.6% of the initial number of participants) again provided a blood sample (see overview of the study in Figure 1). This allowed us to study the humoral and cellular immune responses directed against flu\u2014and also against control antigens\u2014in an unbiased way.",

We tested M1 and M2 as targets for cellular immune responses in the current study. The M2 protein is a proton-selective ion channel protein, integral in the viral envelope of the influenza A virus. M2 brings protons into the virion core. Acidification of virus interior, leads to weakening of electrostatic interaction and leads to dissociation between M1 (matrix protein) and viral rib nucleoprotein (RNP) complexes [17]. Traces of M1 in the split vaccine may be responsible for the strong anti-M1 directed responses defined by IFN-\u03b3 production, which has not been reported until now. Flu vaccines are produced and standardised based on their haemagglutinin and neuraminidase content, and traces of the M1 proteins, contained in the current standard vaccines, may in part be responsible for conferring protective immune responses between flu A strains, since the M1 protein is quite conserved [18]. The M1-directed cellular immune responses, along with traces of M1 proteins in split vaccines may in part responsible for the cross-reactive immune responses against H5N1 associated with the pdm flu vaccine, since CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses directed against H5N1 have preferentially reported to focus on M1 or NP (nucleoproteins) [19].",

However, at the end of the study, we could not detect significant differences in IFN-\u03b3 production in response to flu antigens between previously vaccinated and unvaccinated participants. This suggests that after the flu season, previously vaccinated and unvaccinated participants were able to mount comparable immune responses (as measured by IFN-\u03b3 production in the whole-blood assay).",

One of the arguments is that flu vaccination may not protect against ILI symptoms during flu the season. This notion was corroborated in our study. A number of study participants, after pdm flu vaccination, experienced more ILI symptoms, perhaps due to the observed increase in prevalence of rhinovirus infection in pdm flu vaccinated participants as compared to non-pdm flu vaccinated participants. Other reasons may account for these observations, one of them being the low predictive value of the ILI case definition [26]. Future prospective studies may address the question whether certain flu vaccines are able to increase cellular immune responses in the respiratory system, particularly after encounter with the wildtype flu. Increased \u2018influenza-like\u2019 symptoms may occur upon exposure to additional pathogens, such as rhino- or coronavirus, that stimulate \u2018flu-primed\u2019 innate or adaptive immune responses. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that infection with rhinovirus may have delayed the circulation of H1N1, most likely via activation of non-specific innate immune responses in the respiratory system [27].",

This immune status could not be observed in participants who reported no ILI symptoms, irrespective of whether or not they received the pmd flu vaccination. This suggests that some pmd flu vaccinated participants who reported ILI symptoms may have been exposed to the H3N2 seasonal flu supporting previous observations that pmd flu vaccination did not affect the rate of H3N2 infections [28]. The pdmH1N1 strain dominated the flu season in Sweden in 2009\u20132010, but flu H3N2 and flu B were also present in 1.7% and 1.4% of the samples analysed by the Swedish National Influenza Centre [29].",

This notion was indeed corroborated: we showed that shortly after a positive pdmH1N1 PCR, IFN-\u03b3 production to most of the flu antigens was significantly increased, yet declined by the end of the study (May 2010). In contrast, we could detect significantly higher levels of IFN-\u03b3 production in response to M1 (which is not a designated vaccine component) at the end of the study in pdm flu vaccinated participants; this was not the case for study participants who tested positive for pdmH1N1 by PCR (Table 6).",
