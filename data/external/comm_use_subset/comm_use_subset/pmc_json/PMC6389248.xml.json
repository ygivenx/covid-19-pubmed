In clinical cases, acute encephalopathy was associated with RSV infection, and approximately 40% of RSV-positive patients presented with acute neurological symptoms before the age of 2 years [4]. Although the viral RSV genome has been detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of children presenting with RSV infection-related convulsions or central nervous system (CNS) symptoms [5], the molecular mechanism underlying RSV neuropathogenesis remains unclear. Neuronal abnormalities might directly induce encephalopathic symptoms, such as epilepsy, seizures, convulsions or lethargy, and long-term neurological sequelae, including cognitive impairment and seizures, have been observed in patients. Additionally, movement disorders have also been observed in patients who survived encephalitis induced by Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection [6].",

This phosphoprotein is found mainly in the nucleus, where it regulates cell proliferation and growth, embryogenesis, cytokinesis, and nucleogenesis [16]. More recently, C23 was proposed to mediate the extracellular regulation of nuclear events [14] and shown to play roles in inflammatory responses induced by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) [17]. Furthermore, reports have also suggested that surface C23 may serve as an attachment target for some viruses, such as HIV [18, 19]. Based on its relative molecular mobility during sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), C23 is often described as a 100\u2013110-kDa protein, although its putative molecular weight is approximately 78 kDa [20]. Tayyari et al. reported that C23 acts as a cellular receptor to recognize the RSV F protein, and interfering with the C23-RSV F protein interaction inhibits RSV infection in cell cultures and in animal models [21]. These finding are consistent with the characteristics of other enveloped virus cellular receptors, such as those of herpes simplex virus [22] and hepatitis B virus [23].",

TLR engagement by specific sets of microbial ligands trigger the production of pro-inflammatory factors and enhance antigen-presenting cell functions. However, the functional roles of TLRs in the CNS are poorly understood [24]. Purified RSV F protein elicits an inflammatory response in hematopoietic cells, requiring the expression of TLR4 and its co-receptor CD14. While TLR4 expression is known to play an important role in controlling RSV replication [25], its biological role in immune responses to RSV remains inconclusive and controversial [26, 27].",

In addition, because TLR3/TLR7 might recognize double-stranded RNA and the single-stranded RNA genome during RSV replication, TLR3/TLR7 variations were also studied in RSV-infected N2a cells.

The baseline level of C23 expression was slightly higher than that of TLR4, but both TLR4 and C23 protein expression were up-regulated from 1 h pi to 4 h pi, which is during the early stage of infection (Fig. 7). Interestingly, both TLR4 and C23 protein levels were down-regulated beginning 4 h pi (late stage of infection), suggesting that these two receptors may participate in the early recognition and modulation of viral entry into N2a cells. We also speculated that TLR4 and C23 have no additional functions after RSV is internalized, as the expression levels of these two membrane receptors were decreased after 4 h of infection. These data are consistent with those of the laser confocal microscopy and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. TLR4 expression in neurons of traumatic encephalopathy patients has also been reported to increase at early infection and decrease at late infection, and TLR4 is thought to play a vital role in inflammatory responses involving MyD88/NF-\u03baB activation and initiate the TLR4/MyD88/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway [26, 37], suggesting that TLR4 is very important for the ability of RSV to infect neuronal cells.",

Simultaneously, TLR-associated downstream inflammatory factors, such as IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1, are released from N2a cells by RSV invasion. Notably, the results obtained herein from RSV-infected N2a cells are similar to those obtained from CHIKV virus\u2013infected N2a cells [42].",

During these processes, the RSV F protein co-localized with TLR4 and C23 and thus may play an essential role in the RSV infection of N2a cells. Taken together, the results presented here may help elucidate the underlying pathology of RSV infection and suggest potential therapeutic targets for the control and prevention of RSV-induced human diseases.",
