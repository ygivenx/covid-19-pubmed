Many of these processes are influenced or affected by the migration and mobility of human populations.1, 2 International migration, which is a supporting component and a consequence of globalization,increasingly affects health in migrant source, transit, and recipient nations.3 The flow of populations between locations with widely different health determinants and outcomes creates situations in which locally defined public health threats and risks assume international or global relevance. This fact is illustrated by the rapid awareness,detection, and response to the emergence of a novel influenza A/H1N1 virus in the spring of 2009.4, 5 Global demographic predictions indicate that the forces promoting and supporting international migration will continue to do so, and may become stronger in all regions of the world as populations attempt to move up gradients of opportunity (such as economic, educational, security, health).6\n",

This article puts forth the observation that many of the important public health aspects of migration originate from or are based on the diversity and disparity of the populations themselves and extend beyond the legal and temporal processes involved in changing one's residence. Addressing migration-associated health threats and risks will be more effectively accomplished if approached from this population-based framework, rather than from traditional diseaseor immigration status-based views. It is proposed that the development of standardized, programmatic approaches to health and migration that are based on collective international evidence would be an effective strategic and operational approach to global health.",

The introduction of population movement into an area characterized by sustained differences in measures of population health allows for the transfer or elaboration of these characteristics between locations.53 This is a concept with far-reaching implications for health maintenance and promotion, disease prevention, intervention and health-services management, and education and training programs. In the sphere of infectious diseases, population mobility is one of the underlying factors in the emergence and reemergence of diseases of international public health importance as shown by communicable disease outbreaks.54 Prevalence disparities between migrant source and destination countries can also exist for noninfectious diseases and conditions, although the direction of disparity from high to low prevalence and vice versa may vary depending on the condition being studied. As a consequence, migrant-receiving nations are sometimes required to respond to adverse health outcomes that originate beyond their jurisdiction and normal planning considerations. In addition, migrants who are subjected to legal, social, or economic isolation and deprivation may develop levels of ill health much different from those seen in the local or host population. Taken together, evidence clearly suggests that health interventions and attempts to mitigate adverse health outcomes in migrant communities may require approaches that differ from those required by the locally born community.55, 56\n",

The first challenge is the early appreciation and recognition of the diversity and disparity components of the population, which could result in significant migrant health issues. Early recognition can be achieved through effective engagement of the health-services system by a health professional or the migrant. The size of the migrant population and the diversity within migrant communities and populations can mask significantly different groups with disease vulnerabilities. Health practices may differ significantly by group, particularly in health-promotion strategies and approaches to disease screening between source and host nations (for example, hypertension, diabetes in pregnancy, colon, uterine or breast cancer). These differences may also extend to infectious disease prevention and control measures, such as vaccination or outbreak response. If health indicators are collected or recorded in terms of broad administrative classifications, such as \u2018migrant\u2019 or \u2018place of birth,\u2019 health risks in populations composed of internally displaced, refugees, or trafficked individuals may be obscured.",

Integrating a migration component into these activities can facilitate the global approach to disease control and demonstrate immediate benefit for both source and recipient nations. Mobile populations are one of the means by which locally arising risks can become global challenges. Mitigation programs and control strategies must encompass migration components in terms of both threat-to-risk assessment and intervention planning. The importance of these issues has been noted during responses to global health events such as SARS (2003) and the more recent pandemic influenza (2009) event, wherein travel-related control measures included screening, inspection, isolation, quarantine, and exclusion. The scale of migration and population mobility has required many of these responses to have cultural and linguistically appropriate services.",
