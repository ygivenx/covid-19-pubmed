The program was run using a Dell Optiplex755 server (Round Rock, TX). The CDOCKER algorithm employed a strategy involving the generation of the initial ligand orientation in the active site of the target protein followed by molecular dynamics (MD)-based simulated annealing and final refinement via energy minimization. The crystal structure of HNE (PDB ID: 2Z7F) was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb). The water molecules in the protein were removed, the protein was refined based on the root mean square deviation (RMSD), and EGCG was docked to the protein according to the appropriate parameters. Beginning from the EGCG configuration, a set of 10 different orientations was randomly generated. The co-crystalized ligand SEI300 was used as the positive control ligand, and the binding site was defined based on the binding of SEI300 and HNE. The interaction energy was calculated to analyze the interaction between the ligand and the receptor. Once the ligand was docked to the active site, a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed using the GROMACS 4.6.6 program. The GROMOS96 53a6 Force Field and the SPC/E water condition were selected during the topology process. Water was position-restrained using a force constant (kpr) of 1000 kJ mol\u22121\u00b7nm\u22122. The protein was placed in the box at least 1.0 nm from the box edge, and the box was defined as a cube. During the GENION process, 10 Cl\u22121 were added to the system for charge equilibration. A 30-ns MD simulation was performed. The GROMACS program was used to constrain the bonds involving hydrogen atoms, allowing for an integration interval of 2 fs. The particle mesh Ewald method using a threshold of 1 nm was employed to account for the electrostatic interactions. A threshold of 1 4 nm was used for the van der Waals interactions. The non-bonded pair lists were updated every 0.010 ps. The coordinates were saved every 1 ps. Accuracy testing was performed by calculating the RMSD after re-docking the internal ligand to the protein using the algorithm.",

The HNE protein was dissolved in coupling buffer (15 \u03bcg/ml, in 10 mM sodium acetate, PH 4.50), and 412 response units (RU) of the HNE protein, which was used as the ligand, were immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip using N-ethyl-N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide and N-hydroxysuccinimide according to the standard primary amine-coupling procedures; HBS-EP (10 mM HEPES, 150 nM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, and 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P20, pH 7.4) was used as the running buffer. Equilibration of the baseline was performed by continuously flowing HBS-EP across the chip surface for 1\u20132 h. The Biacore data were collected at 25 \u00b0C using HBS-EP as the running buffer at a constant flow rate of 30 \u03bcl/min.

The samples were injected into the channels at a flow rate of 30 \u03bcl/min, followed by washing with running buffer. The binding responses were continuously recorded in RU at a frequency of 1 HZ as sensorgrams and were expressed as a function of time.

The results from the MTS proliferation assay showed that neutrophil elastase at a concentration of at least 20 nM enhanced tumor cell viability; among all of the concentrations tested, 40 nM neutrophil elastase displayed the strongest effect (Fig. 1B). Thus, we selected 10 nM neutrophil elastase as the intervention condition. The MTS proliferation assay results showed similar cell viability between the control group and the groups treated with various concentrations of EGCG (Fig. 1C) and also showed a non-significant change in cell viability between the group treated with neutrophil elastase (10 nM) and the groups treated with EGCG and neutrophil elastase (10 nM). However, in the wound healing assays, the cells treated with 10 or 20 \u03bcM EGCG migrated at a much slower rate than the control cells and the cells treated with neutrophil elastase (10 nM) (Fig. 2A,B), suggesting that EGCG displays anti-migratory properties. To confirm this result, we performed further cell migration assays using the transwell chamber model. As shown in Fig. 2C,D, the group treated with 10 nM neutrophil elastase displayed significantly more migrating A549 cells than the control group. Alternatively, treatment with either 10 or 20 \u03bcM EGCG (after exposure to 10 nM neutrophil elastase), resulted in dramatically fewer migrating A549 cells than the control treatment and treatment with neutrophil elastase (10 nM) alone. These results indicated that treatment with EGCG at a concentration between 10 and 20 \u03bcM induces a substantial anti-migratory effect without affecting the proliferation of A549 cells exposed to neutrophil elastase.",

The results showed that vimentin expression was significantly altered after HNE treatment. However, as the specific inhibitor of HNE sivelestat sodium significantly up-regulated the expression of vimentin. Nevertheless, the vimentin protein levels were clearly down-regulated in response to EGCG treatment in the presence or absence of HNE (Fig. 3B,C). The expression of \u03b2-catenin was increased after HNE induction but was significantly decreased after treatment with 20 \u03bcmol/L EGCG (Fig. 3B,C). We also detected the expression and sub-cellular localization of ZEB-1 because a recent study suggested that ZEB-1 plays a role in lung cancer invasiveness and metastasis development. The results showed that ZEB-1 expression was significantly increased after treatment with HNE, and this effect was ameliorated after the addition of EGCG (Fig. 3A). Additionally, the sub-cellular translocation of ZEB-1 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus was detected after treatment with HNE. The expression of ZEB-1 in the nucleus was decreased after treatment with EGCG in the neutrophil elastase-treated A549 cells.",

The interaction energy between EGCG and HNE is \u201329.9704 kJ/mol, which is similar to the interaction energy (\u221234.0679 kJ/mol) between HNE and its endogenous inhibitor SEI300. The active binding site between EGCG and HNE (PDB ID: 2Z7F) was defined as the ligand-binding site with a 9-\u00c5 radius. As anticipated, EGCG stably docked to the ligand-binding domain (LBD) (Fig. 4B). At least 8 residues in the LBD were involved in the interaction between EGCG and the HNE protein. EGCG potentially formed hydrogen bonds with SER166, THR165, ARG217 and ARG178. Moreover, EGCG possessed a potential aromatic interaction with ARG177 (Fig. 4D). The binding mode of EGCG in the LBD of HNE provided detailed structural insight into the interaction between this compound and the HNE protein. Furthermore, we performed a 30-ns MD process using GROMACS 4.6.6 software. The time-averaged normalized ratio of the gyration radius, the RMSD, hydrogen bonds and the GROMACS energy were analyzed to reflect the distribution of EGCG molecules surrounding HNE. The gyration radius and the RMSD of the ligand EGCG and the receptor HNE trended toward stability as time progressed (Fig. 5A,B). The interacting H-bond number was shown to change with in a stable range as time progressed (Fig. 5C). Additionally, the GROMACS energy did not fluctuate as time progressed changed (Fig. 5D). g_mmpbsa method calculated results showed that \u2206Gbinding = \u221271.8  12.4.KJ/mol (Table 1).",

Upon neutrophil elastase exposure, the protein level of IRS-1 was decreased, and the phosphorylation of Akt (Thr 473) and PI3K were elevated. EGCG (20 \u03bcM) enhanced the protein levels of IRS-1 (Fig. 7A,C) and reduced the phosphorylation of Akt and PI3K in the neutrophil elastase-stimulated A549 cells (Fig. 7A,D\u2013F).",

HNE, among the most potent proteinases released by neutrophils, is considered to be responsible for the elastolytic damage in emphysema25. To some extent, neutrophil elastase may represent the link between emphysema and lung cancer. Recent reports showed that modest levels of neutrophil elastase led to the uncontrolled proliferation of A549 lung epithelial tumor cells19. We found that HNE treatment (10 nM) enhanced the migration of A549 cells. The concentrations of neutrophil elastase used in our study were lower than 40 nM to avoid the proliferation-promoting effect of HNE. Our results indicated that 20 \u03bcM EGCG completely suppressed the enhancement of cell migration induced by HNE in A549 cells. Furthermore, we verified that EGCG ameliorated the neutrophil elastase-induced up-regulation of the expression of several EMT markers, such as ZEB-1 and vimentin. Notably, it was recently reported that tumor-entrained neutrophils (TENs) induced by a primary tumor accumulated in the circulation and the premetastatic lung and inhibited the metastatic seeding of tumor cells in the lungs by generating H2O2 in mouse models of breast cancer26. Therefore, the role of HNE, which is generally considered as the major effector of human neutrophil function, particularly merits investigation. Thus, we provide the first evidence for the proliferation-promoting effect of HNE on A549 cells.",

Based on the results of MD simulation, we further calculated the binding free energy. According to study of Sulea et al.27, we verified that EGCG could bind with HNE protein. To verify these results concerning the interaction between EGCG and HNE, we further evaluated the binding affinity of EGCG to HNE using SPR biosensor analysis. The results confirmed the computer modeling prediction. We are the first to discover this novel target of the multi-targeting molecule EGCG. Interestingly, the inhibitor of HNE sivelestat sodium displayed a lower affinity to HNE than EGCG. We found that the low water solubility of sivelestat sodium led to the appearance of the lipid solvent as an interfering factor. Because of equipment limitations, we could not resolve this issue in the present study. To confirm the inhibitory effect of the interaction between EGCG and neutrophil elastase on the activity of this enzyme, we measured the enzymatic activity of neutrophil elastase after treatment with EGCG or sivelestat sodium. Alasbahi28 had verified the method of the elastase enzymatic activity assay. EGCG exerted a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on the enzymatic activity of neutrophil elastase. As the positive control, sivelestat sodium exerted a greater inhibitory effect than EGCG.",

            "text": "As AAT is the specific and primary inhibitor of neutrophil elastase, we assumed that AAT might mediate the inhibitory effect of EGCG on neutrophil elastase-induced cell migration in vitro. AAT is predominantly synthesized in liver but is also expressed in extra-hepatic tissues and cells, including carcinoma cells29. The role of AAT in cancer development has been supported by some laboratory data; however, the molecular mechanism underlying the role of AAT in tumor cell migration is poorly understood. The primary function of AAT is the inhibition of neutrophil elastase. Our results indicated that the protein levels of AAT in A549 cells were clearly increased after treatment with EGCG. However, the contribution of AAT to the tumor development is somewhat controversial. In contrast to its effects against tumor growth, AAT has been shown to be correlated with poor prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma30 and with the inhibitory effect of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) on the proliferation and invasiveness of lung cancer HCC cells31. Upon binding to neutrophil elastase, AAT activates cleavage within the reactive site loop (RSL) in a suicidal action32. Evidence has indicated that the AAT levels are significantly elevated in the skin of NE\u2212/\u2212 mice compared with NE+/+ mice in a murine model of the autoimmune disease bullous pemphigoid33. It has been reported that the deficiency of circulating AAT is highly associated with lung inflammation and, especially, the early onset of pulmonary emphysema34. Additionally, clinical findings have indicated that AAT, which is elevated in the serum of cancer patients, is a serum biomarker for the diagnosis of lung cancer and prostate cancer35. Previous studies showed that EGCG inhibits PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling in various tumor cells436. Our previous data demonstrated that the inhibition of neutrophil elastase-induced cell proliferation using curcumin (a type of polyphenol similar to EGCG) is also dependent on the PI3K pathway in A549 cells14. Recently, it was shown that neutrophil elastase released by activated neutrophils within the lung is absorbed by adjacent epithelial tumor cells and degrades IRS-1, which is a binding partner of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K, thereby inducing the hyperactivity of the PI3K pathway, which leads to uncontrolled tumor cell proliferation19. Our results showed that the neutrophil elastase-induced decrease in IRS-1 expression was significantly inhibited by EGCG in A549 cells. The suppression of Akt and ERK1/2 has been thought to mediate the anti-tumor migration property of EGCG37. Therefore, we explored whether EGCG treatment remarkably suppressed neutrophil elastase-induced phosphorylation and activation of PI3K/Akt. Our results showed that the expression of Ser473-phosphorylated Akt was increased in neutrophil elastase-induced A549 cells and was down-regulated after co-treatment with EGCG and neutrophil elastase. Moreover, we observed the phosphorylation of Akt at Thy308. Compared with the regulation of Ser473 phosphorylation, the phosphorylation state of Thy308 was not significantly changed after treatment with neutrophil elastase. These results indicated that the migration-promoting effect of neutrophil elastase was not mediated by Akt phosphorylation at Thy308 but might be mediated by the regulation of p473-Akt. In the positive control group, neither p308-Akt nor p473-Akt expression was significantly changed after treatment with the inhibitor of neutrophil elastase sivelestat sodium. We speculated that sivelestat sodium, as a selective neutrophil elastase inhibitor, cannot suppress the metastasis of lung cancer, in contrast to the multi-targeting natural product EGCG, via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.",
