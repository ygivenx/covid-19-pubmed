Although there have been tremendous strides in the control of communicable diseases (such as antibiotics and vaccines) in modern times, other changes (such as unprecedented population growth and increased mobility through air travel) have concurrently increased the potential for disease development and epidemic or even pandemic spread [1]. There have been several high profile international outbreaks in recent years, such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003, the H1N1 pandemic in 2009\u20132010 and the recent Ebola virus disease (formerly known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever) epidemic. While Ebola was primarily confined to the most severely affected west African countries of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, an October 2014 fatal case in the United States (in a Liberian immigrant), with transmission of the disease to an American health care worker, heightened fears that the disease may spread to North America. Polls conducted in both Canada (n = 1009) [2] and the United States (n = 1577) [3] subsequent to the October 2014 case indicated that 79% and 77% of respondents, respectively, were somewhat or very concerned about Ebola transmission.",

Effective risk communication has been identified as key to these efforts [4] and indeed has been listed by the World Health Organization as one of the eight core capacities of the International Health Regulations (2005) [5]. However, risk communication during infectious disease outbreaks throughout the world continues to be found wanting and in need of improvement [6, 7]. For example, health care workers in both Canada [8] and the United States [9] have questioned the preparedness of public health agencies to deal with potential Ebola cases. Their concern has been attributed to a lack of communication about existing infectious disease plans and mitigation strategies [10].",

A doctor treating these initial patients later travelled to Hong Kong and infected several people at the hotel where he was staying, including a 78-year old woman from Canada who was in Hong Kong on holiday. Her transmission of the disease to family members upon her return to Canada led to the Toronto SARS outbreak in 2003 [14]. This outbreak occurred in two waves (March to April and April to July). Ultimately, approximately 400 people were diagnosed with the disease, 25,000 Toronto residents were placed in quarantine, and 44 people died in Canada (all in Toronto). Approximately 85% of the Canadian SARS cases occurred in Ontario, although suspect cases were also reported in the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Saskatchewan (Table 1) [15, 16, 17]. Intense media coverage of the Toronto SARS outbreak (as the only city affected outside of Asia) eventually led to a World Health Organization travel advisory. Partly in response to identified areas for improvement in Canada\u2019s responsiveness to future health care crisis (including communication), in 2004 the Canadian government established the Public Health Agency of Canada, and provided increased funding for public health and pandemic influenza preparedness efforts.

On June 11, 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak to be a Phase 6 global influenza pandemic (the first since 1969). A Phase 6 pandemic, the highest level, indicates that the same identified virus has caused sustained outbreaks in two or more countries in one WHO region and in at least one other country in another WHO region [19]. By June 2010, H1N1 had been reported in 214 countries, with more than 18,000 deaths world-wide [20]. The Canadian H1N1 pandemic also occurred in two waves: the first wave peaked in June 2009 and the second in October 2009. In Canada, there were 428 deaths attributed to H1N1 [21] and more than 40,000 laboratory-confirmed cases [18]. Alberta recorded 71 deaths from H1N1 and 1,276 hospitalizations [22]. The WHO declared H1N1 to be in the post-pandemic phase on August 20, 2010.",

While Internet sources existed during SARS, there was an explosive growth of sources and types of information available through this media in the intervening years between the SARS and H1N1 outbreaks. By 2010, people were able to readily seek out information from diverse sources and perspectives, resulting in what Krimsky [28] termed the \u2018democratization of knowledge\u2019. Although this created more opportunities for acquiring information previously unavailable to the public, it did not necessarily make understanding the risk and arriving at informed decisions on health behaviours easier. Those seeking health information on the Internet were shown to experience confusion and anxiety due to the virtually unlimited amount of information, particularly if this information was different and contradictory [29]. It has been suggested that online information may have contributed to greater stress and hysteria during SARS [30]. During H1N1, Internet based sources of information were found to conflictingly provide both \u2018trustworthy information\u2019 (e.g. from public health agencies) and more biased points of view [31], and did not readily provide relevant information on prevention [32].",

This theory of media or channel complementarity [37] has been demonstrated to occur between both traditional and online media, and between interpersonal information channels (such as health care providers) and all types of mass media channels [38].

Overall, there was a shift to older, more educated and more affluent respondents in the 2010 H1N1survey as compared to the 2004 SARS survey. This is most likely due to changes in the households that could be accessed by landline telephones. The proportion of Canadian households with a residential landline decreased from 91% in 2006 (this information is not readily available for the 2004 survey year) to 67% in 2010. Concurrently, the proportion of households that use only a cell phone increased from 2.7% in 2004 to 12.8% in 2010 [41, 42]. Furthermore, the changing use of landlines is age dependent. In 2010, 80% of households comprised solely of people aged 55 and over had at least one landline, compared with 56% of households comprised of people aged 54 and under [40]. A 2008 survey showed that younger households were much more likely to use only a cell phone; 34.4% of households comprised solely of adults aged between 18 and 34 relied exclusively on cell phones, while among all other households the rate was 4.5% [43]. This change in accessibility through the survey method of random digit dialling of landline telephones is also likely the cause of the decreased response rate between the two surveys.",

Age was more likely to account for the variability in information source usage within both the SARS and H1N1 survey results. Not surprisingly, older respondents used traditional information sources (newspaper, television and radio) more, but used the Internet less, than younger respondents. However, interestingly, younger respondents used doctors, health professionals and friends/relatives as information sources more than older respondents. By contrast, age was not a significant factor in any of the responses on usefulness and credibility in the SARS survey. The minor age related differences noted in the responses from the H1N1 survey probably reflect the older demographic of this population.",

Random digit dialled telephone surveys of landline telephones are still commonly used to measure public risk perceptions and behavioural attitudes during an infectious disease outbreak because they are relatively rapid and easy to implement, and can thus inform policy decisions and shape health risk communications in a timely manner [44]. However, this comparative research demonstrated that the changing demographic accessed using this type of survey has significant implications for the interpretation of the information (in terms of population representativeness) and for assessing shifts in attitudes and behaviours over time. In the future, public health agencies and researchers using this data collection mechanism will need to make more concerted efforts to access a younger age demographic that may rely more on cell phones and electronic communications [45].",

This finding is particularly relevant given the realities of our aging population and their increasing needs for health information [46]. This pattern signals that the growing emphasis on providing official public health risk communication and information through Internet and social media sources, while important, should not replace the use of more traditional information channels. In addition, different online information seeking patterns for older adults means that material that is provided through these channels needs to be tailored for different types of audiences [47, 48]. Although it is recognized that Internet usage has changed since the 2010 H1N1 survey, national surveys show increases are fairly modest. The 2012 Canadian Internet Use Survey [49] found that the percentage of Canadian homes with access to Internet only increased by 4% from 2010 (from 79% to 83%). Furthermore, the majority (61%) of those without home Internet access reported they had no need for or interest in it, thus continuing to validate the need for multiple sources and channels of health information.",
