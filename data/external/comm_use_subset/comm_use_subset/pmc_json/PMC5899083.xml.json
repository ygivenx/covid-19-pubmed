No obvious pattern between melt curve peak temperature (TM) or shape was apparent, which could be used to determine the genus of the coronavirus. Samples which produced a visible band of the expected size on the agarose gel also produced a strong peak on the melt curve. However, some negative samples produced small non-specific peaks in the melt curve within, and slightly above, the temperature range in which the positive samples produced peaks. These were small and readily differentiated from strong positive samples. However, without running a gel, these peaks would make it difficult to determine if a sample was weak positive or a non-specific reactor. When present, these non-specific peaks were associated with a ~300 bp band on the agarose gel that was readily differentiated from the target band of size 600 bp. During optimisation of this PCR on known negative and known positive samples, the non-specific band disappeared with forward and reverse primer concentrations of 0.5 \u00b5M as opposed to the 1 \u00b5M used in this study. This, however, had the impact of increasing the CT of positive samples by about 3 (an approximately 8-fold decrease in PCR amplification) and it was decided to go for increased PCR sensitivity over the removal of the small non-specific product as all positive samples could be confirmed by gel analysis.",

The use of multiple PCR assays to screen wild bird samples increased the overall sensitivity for detecting coronaviruses. Compared to the 5\u2032 UTR PCR, nested and modified PCRs alone, the detection rate of coronaviruses increased 2.1, 1.4 and 1.3 fold respectively when all PCRs were used together. Had only one assay been used in this study, a number of coronaviruses in individual species would not have been detected. For example, only the modified PCR detected delta-CoV\u2019s in the curlew sandpipers and the red-necked stints, while the nested PCR was able to detect more delta-CoV\u2019s in ruddy turnstones and pied herons. None of the PCRs described in this study detected the deltacoronavirus in the pooled duck sample. Amplicon sequencing from this sample found that the PCRs were preferentially amplifying the gammacoronavirus present. However next generation sequencing data from this sample (Vibin et al., 2018 (submitted)) found deltacoronavirus sequences were more abundant than those of the gammacoronavirus. Therefore the current pan-coronavirus PCRs may favour detection of gammacoronaviruses over deltacoronaviruses and this may explain why studies to date have found many more gammacoronaviruses in wild birds. It is possible that there are many more genetically diverse coronaviruses circulating in wild birds which are currently outside the detection abilities of the current published pancoronavirus PCRs, and it will be interesting to see how our understanding of coronavirus diversity improves as the use of non-targeted next generation sequencing techniques becomes more common.",

It is the most sequenced genomic region of coronaviruses from wild bird hosts, with many studies using PCRs targeting this region to detect avian coronaviruses16,18,24,26. The fragment analysed in this study represents about 1% of the coronavirus genome, and therefore any interpretation of relationships in the phylogenetic tree should be made cautiously. With these caveats in mind, no temporal or spatial patterns in coronavirus sequences was observed in either the gamma- or deltacoronavirus phylogenetic analyses. However, some clustering by host species/order was observed, and this was strongest in the deltacoronaviruses, similar to the situation observed by Chu, et al.16 in Hong Kong and Cambodia who observed similar host species lineages. There was a Charadriiformes delta-CoV lineage observed which was strongly supported by the bootstrap analysis. All seven Australian shorebird delta-CoV\u2019s from three different host species clustered with the single previously characterised shorebird delta-CoV from a ruddy turnstone sampled on the East Coast of the United States21. The one Australian duck deltacoronavirus belonged to a duck lineage of deltacoronaviruses, but itself was 18.6% different to its closest relative sequence from a Eurasian teal in Hong Kong16. Similarly, the Australian heron deltacoronaviruses were within the lineage containing other herons but were genetically different to heron sequences seen elsewhere.",

However some Charadriiform gammacoronaviruses were highly similar in nucleotide sequence to gammacoronaviruses from ducks, e.g. the curlew sandpiper gammacoronaviruses contained a single nucleotide difference to mallard gammacoronavirus sequences identified in Sweden25. Even within the Charadriiformes lineages, the degree of genetic difference to duck sequences was much less than that seen in the deltacoronavirus phylogeny. The phylogeny based on the amino acid sequence of the gammacoronaviruses separated the majority of the duck and Charadriiform gammacoronaviruses into separate branches, however both the curlew sandpiper gammacoronaviruses and a single ruddy turnstone gamma-CoV were identical in amino acid homology to duck Australian duck gamma-CoV\u2019s as well as duck gamma-CoV\u2019s identified in other investigations16,18,20,25,27. These results again suggest that migratory Charadriiformes may share gammacoronaviruses with other avian species16,18 and are therefore important vectors and reservoir of coronaviruses. Hughes, et al.23 and Chu, et al.16 identified similar gammacoronavirus sequences between Charadriiformes and Anseriformes, while Lima, et al.18 found similar gammacoronaviruses in Charadriiformes and Gruiformes in Madagascar.

Australian duck species rarely come into direct contact with Palearctic waterfowl28. Some degree of geographical gammacoronavirus lineage formation might therefore have been expected, if this was the only means of transmission of duck gamma-CoV\u2019s, due to the high rate of mutation and recombination observed in other avian gamma-CoV\u2019s29,30. However, such isolation was not observed, which suggests that movement of coronaviruses between these populations of ducks occurs frequently. Given that millions of Charadriiformes migrate to Australia to spend their non-breeding season in Australia31, Australian ducks would be much more likely to come into direct contact with Palearctic Charadriiformes than Anseriformes. It is also likely that there are many opportunities for individuals within the migrating shorebird populations to acquire and transmit coronaviruses to/from ducks as they move north-south, as coronaviruses are prevalent in both Charadriiformes and Anseriformes along the East Asian-Australasian Flyway16,20,32 and these species forage and breed in similar habitats33.",
