            "text": "Myelin disorders range from spontaneous inherited to acquired due to inflammatory processes, autoimmune disorders, infectious processes, and toxic substances (1). Myelin vacuolation is the most frequent pathologic feature of myelin sheaths (1\u20133), although it should be differentiated from neuronal vacuolation that occurs in some encephalopathies such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (4). The idea that myelin vacuolation is equivalent to myelin degeneration is not exact, since some pathologies, such as Canavan\u2019s disease, display a conspicuous myelin vacuolation with mild demyelination (1). Myelin vacuolation may occur in at least two ways, the most frequent of which is intramyelinic vacuolation. This is produced when the myelin lamellae split along the intraperiod line, which in turn reopens the extracellular space initially closed during the formation of myelin (5, 6). This mechanism can generate vacuoles (filled with unstainable material) at multiple levels within the myelin sheath and has been associated with fluid accumulation in the nervous system parenchyma (6). Vacuolation can be caused by inherited conditions (7), as is the case in Canavan\u2019s disease (8), or by the effects of toxins (9\u201312). The other mechanism of myelin vacuolation occurs when the lamellae split at the major dense line, thus reopening the intracellular space of the oligodendrocyte or the Schwann cell (6). Whatever the etiology of vacuole formation, the progression from myelin vacuolation to demyelination may depend on whether the primary defect or target is the myelin sheath or the myelinating cells, and on the time of exposure to the inducing agent (1).",

Affinity studies showed that MAG binds preferentially to GD1a and GT1b (15), the latter present in white matter.

A single intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of Clostridium perfringens NA within the lateral ventricle (LV) of rats induces a partial ependymal denudation that affects mainly the ipsilateral ventricle with minimal spread to the contralateral and third ventricles (21\u201323). Recently, the neuroinflammatory events triggered by NA ICV injection have been described (24), and the participation of the complement system in ependymal cell death by NA has been demonstrated (25). However, although the vacuolation of some axonal tracts has been described (23, 24), a detailed study of such alterations in the axonal tracts had not been performed.",

In neuromyelitis optica, an autoimmune disease of the CNS displaying intramyelinic edema and tissue vacuolation, the complement activation is observed in damaged tissue (36). On the other hand, several facts suggest the participation of the complement system in NA-induced myelin vacuolation: (i) sialic acid removal from human tumor cells and red blood cells makes them susceptible to alternative pathway activation and formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) (37, 38); (ii) NA can directly activate the alternative complement pathway (39); and (iii) the presence of NA within the cerebral ventricles triggers the activation of the complement system which contributes to ependymal disruption (25).",

While control animals displayed axons with uniform and regular myelin sheaths, in the NA-injected rats some dilated and irregularly shaped myelin sheath were observed in transverse sections of the SM (Figure 2E, dotted line encloses one myelinated axon). Such dilated myelin sheath displayed an inner cavity, probably corresponding to the vacuoles observed by conventional histological techniques. Despite its larger diameter, the dilated myelin sheaths themselves were apparently similar to that observed in non-affected axons, or in axons from untreated rats. Within the vacuoles, an axon was consistently found, partially in contact with the myelin sheath (arrows in Figures 2C\u2013E). Therefore, the cavity seems to arise from the space between the axonal surface and the innermost myelin wrap. Rarely axons showing a disorganized myelin sheath were found (asterisk in Figure 2F). These images are compatible with a partial disruption of the interaction between the innermost lamella of myelin and the axonal membrane.",

Intramyelinic vacuolation results in vacuoles located at multiple levels within the myelin sheath or between the axonal membrane and the innermost wrap of myelin, and it has been associated with the accumulation of fluid that is non-stainable by conventional histological methods (6).

            "text": "Myelin-associated glycoprotein is a transmembrane glycoprotein member of the siglec family of sialic acid-binding proteins (50, 51), which is specific for myelinating cell membranes (14). MAG is only present in the innermost wrap of myelin (18), suggesting a functional role in axon\u2013myelin interactions (52). On the other hand, complex gangliosides displaying terminal \u03b12,3-linked sialic acid (GT1b and GD1a) are present in the neuronal membranes (53), and GT1b is the only one which both strongly binds to MAG and is present in white matter (15, 53). Pretreatment of gangliosides with NA abolished the adhesion of MAG to either GT1b or GQ1b alpha (15, 54), indicating that ganglioside\u2013MAG interaction is dependent on terminal sialic acid (55). Therefore, we hypothesize that the sialidase activity of NA may disrupt MAG\u2013ganglioside recognition and hence the axon\u2013myelin interaction, thereby promoting the onset of the adaxonal vacuolation. NA cytotoxic effects cannot be ruled out in the process. Such mechanism of vacuolation should give rise to myelin abnormalities similar to those described in Mag-null or B4galnt1-null mutant mice. Mag-null mice display delayed myelination and frequent myelin structural abnormalities (56, 57). Similar alterations were found in B4galnt1-null mice, which are considered completely devoid of complex gangliosides (58, 59). However, myelin vacuolation was not described in such mutants. Therefore, other factors, in addition to MAG\u2013ganglioside disruption, may be involved in NA-induced vacuolation. Furthermore, temporal factors should also be considered, as they might contribute to those differences: in Mag-null and B4galnt1-null mutants, the MAG\u2013ganglioside interaction is permanently disrupted, while in NA-induced vacuolation, the disruption is transient. Similar intramyelinic vacuolation has been found in mitochondrial encephalopathies as Kearns\u2013Sayre syndrome (60), in Canavan\u2019s disease (61), in vitamin B12-deficient animals (62), in toxin-induced injuries (63), and in retroviral infections (64). Although in some of these myelinopathies the authors have placed the oligodendrocytes in the center of the disease (60, 65, 66), the mechanisms of vacuolation remain speculative in most of them.",

            "text": "The origin of several myelin pathologies, such as multiple sclerosis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis, has been related to neuroinflammatory processes (67). Mostly autoimmune demyelinating diseases are accompanied by inflammation of the CNS (67). The well-established notion that multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune and inflammatory disease has recently evolved toward the idea that it is a neurodegenerative disease with an inflammatory component (68, 69). On the other hand, chronic metabolic or mitochondrial encephalopathies are essentially devoid of neuroinflammatory component (70). In NA-injected rats, a neuroinflammatory process with an important infiltration of immunocompetent cells occurs (24). In order to explore whether the neuroinflammatory reaction induced by NA is the cause of myelin vacuolation, the anaphylatoxin C5a was ICV injected in rats. C5a is produced by the proteolysis of C5 component of complement and functions as an inflammatory signaling molecule, thereby inducing the activation of mast cells, basophils, and neutrophils which release histamine and pro-inflammatory cytokines (71). In addition, C5a displays a chemotactic function, thereby promoting the recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages to the inflammatory focus (72\u201374). In our study, ICV injection of C5a induced a neuroinflammatory reaction similar to that provoked by the ICV injection of NA. However, the vacuolation of axonal bundles observed in NA-treated rats was absent in C5a-injected rats, in spite of the evident neuroinflammatory reaction. These results suggest that the neuroinflammation process, including invasion of ventricles, periventricular areas, meninges, and choroid plexus by immunocompetent cells, is not the cause of the myelin vacuolation events observed in NA-injected rats.",

Immunostaining with anti-C5b9 (MAC) did not label the damaged axonal bundles; however, MAC labeling was evident in damaged ependymal cells (25). Partial inhibition of MAC formation was achieved in vivo by blocking C5 activation with a monoclonal antibody administered systemically as well as ICV (25, 78, 79). C5-inhibited rats injected with NA displayed the same degree of myelin vacuolation as non-inhibited rats. The damage provoked by NA under C5 inhibition could have several explanations: (i) NA activates the complement system downstream of C5 in the proteolytic cascade; this is unlikely because in vitro experiments showed that NA-induced activation of complement at the level of C3 and generates iC3b in human serum (39); (ii) other mechanisms, independent of complement, could account for the vacuolation of the myelin. A second model of in vivo MAC deficiency is provided by C6 mutant rats, which bear a spontaneous deletion in the C6 gene (40, 80), preventing C6 synthesis and hence blocking formation of MAC and complement-mediated cell lysis (81, 82). In C6\u2212/\u2212 rats, the degree of myelin vacuolation after NA injection was similar to that of wild-type rats. Since MAC formation is completely precluded in C6 mutant rats (and was not detected by immunohistochemistry), these results lead us to conclude that the lytic pathway of complement does not participate in the myelin damage caused by NA.",

Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, also called measles encephalitis, is a neuroinflammatory disease triggered by measles virus (91). Perivascular inflammation, gliosis in white matter, and irregular loss of myelin and axons in white matter are the hallmarks of this disease (67). The presence of NA in the virus coat confers a higher degree of virulence (92, 93).

The location of the vacuoles between the myelin sheath and the axonal plasma membrane suggests a disturbance of the interaction between the innermost wrap of myelin and the axon membrane. A possible disruption (provoked by NA) of the interaction between MAG and gangliosides at this level is hypothesized. The myelin damage observed seems to be moderate, as it reverts in 2 weeks, and is not accompanied by cell loss (the oligodendrocyte population within the affected tracts remains unaltered, and no neurodegeneration is detected in the related neuronal nuclei). The possibility that the cause of the vacuolation process could be the neuroinflammation occurring upon NA injection was ruled out based on the results obtained with the ICV injection of anaphylatoxin C5a. Finally, various forms of evidence lead us to discard the participation of the complement system in the process of vacuolation induced by NA. Therefore, the direct sialidase action of NA on myelin sheaths seems to be the most probable cause of vacuolation. The knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the myelin disorders caused by NA-bearing pathogens of the CNS may help to design more effective therapeutic strategies.",
