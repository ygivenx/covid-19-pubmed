In FLU 003, a local RT-PCR test result was required either prior to enrollment (for confirmed diagnoses) or at the time of enrollment (for suspected diagnoses). Initially, local RT-PCR test results were only recorded as influenza A positive or negative; after the first year, influenza A subtyping results were recorded.

To minimize bias and increase power for multiple regression analyses that require complete covariate information for each patient, multiple imputation was used to predict values that were substituted for the missing data. The imputation was done in an iterative manner using the baseline covariate data available. The regression coefficients from five rounds of imputation were used to obtain the ORs. The imputation had little effect on the univariable analyses, therefore summary statistics from these analyses are based on the observed data. In a sensitivity analysis, a complete case analysis was performed and adjusted ORs were estimated for all of the baseline variables excluding BMI.

Three hundred and seven (78.3%) of the 392 A(H1N1)pdm09 patients were enrolled from a general hospital ward and 85 (21.7%) were enrolled from an ICU. The median age of hospitalized patients with A(H1N1)pdm09 was 48 years; those enrolled in the first calendar year of enrollment had a median age that was seven years younger (44 versus 51 years; p = 0.001 for difference) than in subsequent years. This age difference was evident both for patients enrolled from the general ward and from the ICU. Fifty-one percent of patients were female; 11% were Asian, 4% were black, and 85% were white/other; the median BMI was 26 kg/m2; 5.3% had a BMI of \u226540 kg/m2; 30% reported smoking; and 25% of the women aged \u226445 years were pregnant. Fifty-three patients (13.5%) had HIV infection or other immune dysfunction; 14 of the 53 patients had HIV infection. Median time from the onset of symptoms to enrollment was five days for patients enrolled in the general ward and 10 days for patients enrolled from an ICU. Eighteen patients (4.7%) developed ILI symptoms after being hospitalized for some other condition; the median (IQR) time between admission and ILI symptom onset was 8 days (IQR: 5\u201318). Excluding the patients who likely acquired A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection in the hospital, the median time from admission to enrollment was two days for patients enrolled from a general ward and 5 days for patients enrolled while in an ICU.",

In a World Health Organization study, Van Kerkhove, et al. reported on surveillance from Ministries of Health or National Public Health Institutes of 19 countries or administrative regions that encompassed 70,000 laboratory-confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 hospitalized patients during April 2009-January 1, 2010. There were 9,700 (13.9%) patients admitted to the ICU and 2,500 (3.6%) deaths [6]. Active surveillance for laboratory-confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection in ten U.S. states during April 2009-April 2010 found that 4% of 5238 hospitalized adults died during the hospitalization [12]. A review by Cheng using 18 published reports found that the case fatality proportion for hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 infection varied by region (Asia, Europe, Oceania, South America and North America) and ranged from 1.6% (Asia) to 6.9% (North America) [13]. In FLU 003, the majority of deaths (27 of 32) occurred in the hospital where the patient was enrolled. The 60-day mortality we observed among patients who were enrolled in the ICU (27%) is similar to reports by Rice and Brun-Buisson [14], [15]. Rice reported a 60-day mortality of 23% for 683 patients with confirmed or probable A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection who were enrolled in ICUs in the United States. Brun-Buisson reported a study of 208 A(H1N1)pdm09 virus-infected patients in France with acute respiratory distress syndrome: 49 (24%) had died by 60 days following the initiation of mechanical ventilation. Kumar followed patients for 90 days and reported that among 168 critically ill patients (including 50 children) in Canada with A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection, 29 (17.3%) patients died, including 4 children; 18 (10.7%) patients died within 14 days and 24 (14.3%) died within 28 days of critical illness onset [16]. The ANZIC Influenza Investigators reported on 722 patients with confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 admitted to an ICU in Australia and New Zealand during June through August, 2009. The median duration of ICU stay was 7 days and 16.9% patients died in the hospital [17].",

Similarly, women of child-bearing age who were pregnant were more likely to be enrolled in FLU 003 and were more likely to be hospitalized if enrolled in FLU 002. These data may reflect a reduced threshold for hospitalizing pregnant women with influenza infection because of concern about the development of disease progression. Similar findings were noted for patients with asthma or COPD.

Patients with influenza are thought to be at higher risk for secondary bacterial infection and pneumonia because of the cytopathic effects of viral replication in cells as well as dysregulated changes in host cytokine production that may diminish both the ability of the immune system to clear bacteria and to achieve appropriate modulation of the inflammatory cascade [40], [41]. We assessed the prevalence of viral and bacterial co-pathogens in a sample of 333 patients and did not find any significant differences in prevalence or outcomes between FLU 002 and FLU 003 patients. In a cross-sectional study of 199 patients from Argentina with A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection, upper respiratory swabs were tested for a variety of bacterial and viral potential pathogens.

Further, the INSIGHT FLU network is currently being adapted to include other emerging respiratory viruses of global public health importance [e.g. MERS-CoV, avian influenza A(H7N9) virus].",

A recent meta-analysis aimed at evaluating risk factors for severe outcomes in seasonal and pandemic influenza found that the lack of power is an issue for many studies [45]. At least a theoretical limitation is that there may be possible misclassification in FLU 003 because of potentially false positive RT-PCR results, particularly those with a positive local laboratory result and a negative central laboratory result. However, the false positive rate with commercial RT-PCR assays is generally quite low. Rather, because some of these individuals who had a positive local RT-PCR were enrolled more than ten days after the onset of symptoms, a time at which they may no longer be shedding influenza virus, the potential for misclassification would have been greater if they had been excluded.",

Observational studies such as FLU 002 and FLU 003 that employ specified periods of clinical follow-up are absolutely critical in properly assessing disease progression and associated risk factors. Our experience will be useful in planning additional observational studies of emerging novel influenza A viruses and novel emerging respiratory viruses, and the data from FLU 002 and FLU 003 will help inform the design of interventional studies of new antiviral medications and other strategies for the treatment and prevention of influenza infection.",
