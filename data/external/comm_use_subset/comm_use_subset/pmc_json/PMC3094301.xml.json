            "text": "Infectious bronchitis (IB) is a serious and highly contagious disease of chickens, accompanied by decreased egg production and poor egg quality in laying flocks. Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was first reported in the USA, replicating in the respiratory tract and some epithelial cells of gut, kidney, and oviduct [1-3]. IBV commonly predisposed the birds to secondary infection with some bacterium, such as Escherichia coli and Mycoplasma gallisepticum, resulting in complicated disease process and increased mortality [4,5]. The clinical disease and production problems frequently cause catastrophic economic losses to the poultry industry all over the world. IBV belongs to the genus Coronaviridae, family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales, and possesses a single stranded positive-sense RNA genome encoding four structure proteins, phosphorylated nucleocapsid (N) protein, small envelope protein (E), integral membrane glycoprotein (M), and spike glycoprotein (S) [6,7]. The S glycoprotein on the outside of the virus contains epitopes associated with serotype differences, and is cleaved post-translationally by cellular proteases into the S1 and S2 subunits [8,9]. The globular S1 subunit forms the tip of a spike, extending outward, plays a role in attachment and entry into the host cell, which has relation to induce virus neutralizing antibody and hemagglutination inhibition antibody, whereas the S2 subunit anchors the S1 moiety to the viral membrane [8-11]. Coding for the heavily glycosylated spike glycoprotein, the error-prone nature of RNA polymerase made the S1 gene could easily generate nucleotide insertions, deletions, point mutations, and RNA recombination under vaccine pressure, to bring about new variation strain and change of tissue tropism [12-16]. It is documented that only a few amino acid differences amongst S proteins are sufficient to have a detrimental impact on cross-protection [15,17-20]. Antigenically different serotypes and newly emerged variants of field chicken flocks lead to vaccine breaks [21,22].",

The phylogenetic distributions were closely relative to geographical factors. Most of the recently isolated IBVs in this study formed the distinct cluster related to the A2 type. However, the routine vaccine strains mainly belong to M41-type branch. A2 strain is closely related to 4/91 serotype, spreading over Europe since its first isolation in UK in 1991 [9,24,33-37]. In this study, 61.3% (49/80) field isolates belonged to the A2-type branch, which included 85.7% (42/49) nephropathogenic field isolates of this study. The QXIBV, first isolated in China and reported associated predominantly with various forms of renal pathology in China, was also representative A2-type strain [25,31]. The analysis results were according to the prevalence of nephropathogenicity IB. To date, the QX-like IBV strains have been widely isolated in many European countries, and become a dominant genotype [5,38]. Through IB surveys, the European QX-like IBV strains have been reported that caused 86% respiratory signs, 22% litter or enteric problems, only 2% had swollen kidneys [39]. Absorbingly, the QX-like IBV strains have undergone divergent evolution paths, brought out different variants in Europe and China. Similarly, seven exceptional strains located in the A2-type branch caused evident respiratory problems, including three isolates from Zhejiang province (QZ1, QZ2 and QZ3) and three isolates from Guangdong province (XD2, XD3 and LZ2), and GL from Guangxi province. The results of our study indicated the strain grouping, such as phenotype and genotype, were not only depended on the geographical factors.
