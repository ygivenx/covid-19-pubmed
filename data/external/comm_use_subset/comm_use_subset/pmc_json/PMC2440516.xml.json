The ATP-dependent system begins with covalent attachment of ubiquitin to the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1). Then the ubiquitin is transferred to a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). Finally, ubiquitin ligase (E3) transfers the ubiquitin to the substrate protein. After several cycles of ubiquitination, multiple ubiquitin molecules are attached to the substrate which is then quickly recognized and subsequently degraded by the 26S proteasome. Ubiquitin is recycled through the actions of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) [12], [13]. There are at least two classes of deubiquitinating enzymes, the ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (UCHs) and ubiquitin-specific processing proteases family.",

We demonstrated that protein ubiquitination was enhanced after coxsackievirus infection. We further showed that knockdown of ubiquitin expression by small-interfering RNA (siRNA) decreased CVB3 infection, likely through the downregulation of ubiquitination and subsequent alteration of protein function and/or degradation. In addition, we showed that inhibition of deubiquitinating enzyme increased the inhibitory effects of proteasome inhibitors on CVB3 replication. We also found that CVB3 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 3D (3Dpol) was modified by ubiquitination. Taken together, our study suggests an important role of ubiquitination in the regulation of coxsackieviral replication.",

We first examined the role of proteasome inhibition in CVB3 replication. As shown in Fig. 1, we found that proteasome inhibitor, MG132, significantly reduced CVB3 viral RNA synthesis (Fig. 1A). Both proteasome inhibitors used in the study, MG132 and lactacystin, decreased the synthesis of CVB3 capsid protein, VP1, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). In addition, two inhibitors inhibited CVB3 viral titers by up to fifteen folds (Fig. 1C). Although MG132 and lactacystin significantly inhibited cellular 20S proteasome activities, we have previously demonstrated there was no apparent difference in proteasome activities between CVB3-infected and sham-infected HeLa cells [9]. Together, these results suggest that efficient replication of CVB3 requires the intact UPS function rather than the core proteasome activity alone.",

To dissect out the role of ubiquitination and degradation in CVB3 infection, we next decided to investigate the protein ubiquitination after CVB3 infection. As shown in Fig. 2A, protein ubiquitination was gradually increased along the time-course of CVB3 infection, which was accompanied by a decrease of free ubiquitin levels. Densitometric analysis further demonstrated that the increases in protein ubiquitination at 3 h, 5 h, and 7 h post-infection were statistically significant as compared to sham infection (Fig. 2B). We have previously demonstrated that 26S proteasome activities were unchanged during CVB3 infection [9]. Thus, the finding of increased accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins is likely due to enhanced protein ubiquitination as opposed to reduced proteasome activity. Decreased levels of free ubiquitin could be a direct consequence of the increased protein ubiquitination. These results suggest that enhanced ubiquitin conjugation may be a prerequisite for efficient synthesis of CVB3 viral RNA and continuation of its lifecycle.",

It has been suggested that proteasome inhibition negatively affects the budding of retroviruses through reducing free ubiquitin level and subsequently interfering with ubiquitination of viral Gag proteins [22], [24], [25]. Ubiquitin is generated in the cell by proteolysis of polyubiquitinated proteins or ubiquitin fused to carboxyl extension proteins (CEPs) [28]. To investigate whether protein ubiquitination is beneficial to CVB3 replication in HeLa cells, we used the ubiquitin-specific siRNA to gene-silence the expression of human ubiquitin-CEP Uba80, which codes for ubiquitin fused to ribosomal protein S27a [29]. As shown in Fig. 3A, both ubiquitin conjugates and free ubiquitin levels were markedly knocked down after the treatment of ubiquitin siRNA. We further showed that viral titers were significantly reduced in the ubiquitin siRNA-transfected cells as compared to scramble siRNA control (Fig. 3B), suggesting that protein ubiquitination is a critical process adopted by coxsackievirus for the successful completion of its lifecycle.",

To further explore the role of protein ubiquitination in viral replication, we examined the influence of DUB inhibition on viral protein expression. Two commercially available ubiquitin c-terminal hydrolase inhibitors, UCH L1 and UCH L3 inhibitors, were used for this study. As shown in Fig. 4, specific inhibition of UCH L1 or UCH L3 further reduced CVB3 protein expression and virus titers in proteasome inhibitor-treated cells, suggesting that these enzymes may be involved in the lifecycle of CVB3. Nevertheless, it was found that inhibition of the UCH L1 and L3 activities alone was not sufficient to block coxsackievirus replication since no significant changes in viral protein expression and CVB3 titers were observed in cells treated with two UCH inhibitors either separately or in combination (Fig. 4). As discussed earlier, stabilization of short-lived host proteins and prevention of protein ubiquitination by reducing recycled ubiquitin likely contribute to the inhibitory effect of proteasome inhibition on viral replication. Thus, it is speculated that DUB inhibition by UCHL1/L3 inhibitors alone, in the absence of apparent inhibition of protein degradation, is not sufficient enough to block viral replication. However, additional reduction of recycled free ubiquitin by DUB inhibition can further enhance the inhibitory effect of proteasome inhibitor.",

Although the role of ubiquitination of these RNA polymerases in the regulation of virus replication remains to be determined, such observation raises the interesting possibility that the ubiquitin/proteasome system may regulate CVB3 replication through ubiquitinating viral polymerase 3D, which is essential for initiating viral RNA replication. To examine whether coxsackieviral proteins are subjected to ubiquitination during viral infection, we performed immunoprecipitation with anti-ubiquitin antibody, followed by immunoblots using antibodies against 3Dpol and viral capsid protein VP1, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5, immunoreactive bands of around 60 kDa were detected in CVB3-infected cells. Non-modified 3Dpol has a molecular weight of about 53 kDa, thus this observation suggests that 3Dpol likely undergoes post-translational modification by monoubiquitination. No protein ubiquitination was observed for VP1 (data not shown). Our results implicate that the ubiquitination process of CVB3 viral proteins might be required for successful replication of the virus.",

Polyubiquitination and degradation of host antiviral proteins has been suggested to be a mechanism of HIV-1 replication [36] . We have previously identified several proteins, such as cyclin D1, p53 and \u03b2-catenin, which are downregulated through the UPS after CVB3 infection [7], [9]. Destabilization of these short-lived host proteins is likely required for CVB3 viral RNA and protein synthesis in its lifecycle. Moreover, it is speculated that nonstructural viral proteins of CVB3 could also be potential targets of the UPS for degradation. Previous studies on picornavirus have shown that several viral proteins, such as encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) 3C protease and hepatitis A virus (HAV) 3C protease, are ubiquitinated and present in low concentrations in infected cells [37]\u2013[39]. Several E3 ubiquitin ligases, such as human E3\u03b1 ubiquitin ligase, have been shown to catalyze the ubiquitination of these viral proteins [38], [39]. Although the exact role of ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of nonstructural viral proteins of EMCV and HAV in infected cells remains elusive, such rapid turnover may be required for efficient viral RNA replication, viral protein synthesis and virus maturation.",

Coxsackievirus infection facilitates host protein polyubiquitination, which subsequently increases intracellular protein degradation by the proteasome and/or viral protein modification, such as 3Dpol, by monoubiquitination. Degradation of host antiviral proteins provides a favorable environment for virus to achieve successful replication. Knockdown of ubiquitin decreases host protein degradation and viral protein ubiquitination. Proteasome inhibition blocks host protein degradation and viral protein ubiquitination by reducing recycled ubiquitin. DUB inhibitors further decreases the viral replication when used together with proteasome inhibitors through the additional reduction of recycled free ubiquitin.",
