            "text": "Amongst vector-borne zoonoses, visceral leishmaniasis (VL) by Leishmania infantum is a major global disease potentially fatal to humans. VL is one of the most important threats among the neglected tropical diseases causing an estimated 300,000 new cases and about 20,000 deaths in humans each year [1]. Its distribution is associated with the occurrence of the phlebotomine sand fly vectors of the genus Phlebotomus spp. and Lutzomyia spp., in the Old and New World, respectively. Developing countries take the brunt of VL considering that malnutrition and low hygienic conditions represent risk factors for the spreading of the infection in human patients [2]. Dogs are the main reservoir hosts of the parasite [3] with usually more than 30% seropositive animals in endemic areas [4]. Other animal species, such as cats and some wild animals (e.g., foxes and hares) have been implicated in the epidemiology of the infection [5,6], with hares involved as reservoir hosts in the outbreak of VL in south-western Madrid, Spain [7]. Where canine leishmaniasis (CanL) is endemic, cats are often exposed to L. infantum, with seroprevalence ranging from 0.7% to 30% according to animal life style and diagnostic technique used [8]. In a study conducted in southern Italy (i.e., the Aeolian Islands, Sicily), a cumulative L. infantum serological and molecular prevalence of 25.8% in cats was reported [9]. Differences in the feline immune function, such as an effective Th1 immunity which often allows spontaneous resolution of lesions, may play a role for the reduced clinical signs in infected cats [10] resulting in subclinical forms with only few reports of overt illness, mainly characterised by skin lesions and lymphadenomegaly [8]. Though cats are exposed to sand fly bites [11], the overall prevalence of L. infantum infection is generally lower than in dogs living in the same areas [8,9,12,13]. Consequently, feline leishmaniasis (FeL) has been for long time disregarded by veterinary practitioners and parasitologists and, as a result, the current distribution of this disease may be underestimated. Examples of neglected zoonotic VL are well embodied by the recent first report of L. infantum in dogs and a cat from Bosnia and Herzegovina, where human leishmaniasis is known to occur in people visiting the country and in the local population [14]. Further, the subclinical presentation of FeL makes the diagnosis of the infection a complex task [8]. Concomitant infections with viral agents such as feline leukemia virus (FeLV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline coronavirus (FCoV) and the protozoon Toxoplasma gondii have been diagnosed with FeL [13,15,16]. Since the first description of FeL in a domestic cat (Felis silvestris catus) [17], the number of reports of clinical cases and prevalence of L. infantum infection in cats have steadily increased in endemic areas, such as in the Mediterranean basin [12,13,18\u201320], the Middle East [21] and Brazil [22]. However, these data have been gained using different diagnostic methodologies since there is currently no consensus about the method of choice for diagnosing FeL. Serological [i.e., immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)], and molecular (e.g., real time-PCR, qPCR) tests are primarily employed for the diagnosis of FeL either for clinical and research purposes [9,23] though few investigations have used multiple tests in combination [9,15,24]. CanL is endemic in Italy with up to 40% of L. infantum infected dogs in the highly endemic regions of south-central Italy [25] where the infection in cats has also been recorded [9,23,26]. However, the lack of information about the distribution of L. infantum subclinical infections in cats is an hindrance to a clear understanding of the role of cats in the epidemiology of zoonotic VL in endemic areas. In this study we assessed the prevalence of L. infantum infection in a large number of cats across Italy by serological and molecular tests and identified potential risk factors for FeL.",

The risk of L. infantum infection in cats, in the multivariate model (i.e., accounting for sex and age class) was significantly associated with the geographical areas (p<0.0001). In particular, cats living in the South of Italy were related to higher risk of L. infantum infection than those in the North by the univariate (OR = 7.14; 95% CI: 4.48\u201311.49) and multivariate analysis (OR = 2.66, 95% CI: 1.59\u20134.44), and those in the Centre by the univariate analysis (OR = 4.93; 95% CI: 2.58\u20139.43). Animals positive to L. infantum (n = 104; 3.9%) aged from 6 months to 20.1 years old (mean 7.5 years, standard deviation 5 years), while negative cats aged from 1 month to 21.3 years (mean 8.4 years, standard deviation 5.4 years) old with no statistically significant difference between the two groups (t = 1.795, p = 0.0728).

The multivariate regression analysis showed that these G2 cats were related to a higher risk of L. infantum infection than those in G1 (i.e., \u226418 months) (OR = 3.69; 95% CI: 1.65\u20138.27). The neutering status was a statistically significant factor associated with positivity to L. infantum. In particular, the risk of not neutered compared to neutered cats was OR = 1.76 (95% CI: 1.06\u20132.93) and statistically significant (p = 0.028). No statistical association was found between Leishmania infected cats and sex in neither the univariate (p = 0.016), nor the multivariate model (p = 0.3015). Equally no association was observed for the breed variable (univariate analysis: p = 0.1413; multivariate analysis: p = 0.9947).

Out of the 13 cats coinfected with FeLV and FIV, three (23.1%) were also Leishmania positive. Leishmania infantum infection was significantly associated only to FIV infection resulting in the multivariable model with an OR = 2.65 (95% CI: 1.34\u20135.22, p = 0.0051).",

The overall seroprevalence of 3.3% is similar to that recorded in cats from central Spain (1.3\u20133.2%) and Portugal (2.8%) [12,31]. Higher seroprevalence data have been reported in cats from highly endemic regions of the Mediterranean basin for CanL, such as in southern Spain (28.3%) [19], central (16.3%) [26] and southern Italy (25.8%) [9] and Turkey (15.2%) [24]. It means that in areas where CanL is endemic, cats are likely to be more exposed to L. infantum as compared to areas where the prevalence of CanL is low [9]. Nonetheless, in our study different proportions of the population of infected animals were recorded in northern (1.6%) and centre (2.3%) versus southern (10.5%) Italy. Although L. infantum has spread throughout Italy [32], the southern and insular regions are still considered more endemic areas for human VL and CanL [25, 33], as a result of the favourable geographical climate conditions that allow the presence and abundance of sand fly vectors in the whole country (e.g., Phlebotomus perniciosus, Phlebotomus perfiliewi, Phlebotomus ariasi, and Phlebotomus neglectus) [25].

Indeed, not neutered and older than 18 months cats are more prone to an outdoor life style than younger and neutered cats, due to more pronounced predatory instinct [39]. Therefore, these cats are more exposed to sand fly bites, which over time, results in a higher risk of L. infantum infection. Undoubtedly, the prevalence of cats positive for FeL at the molecular tests also depends on the cat life style and therefore exposure to sand fly bites with the higher number of animals positive to DNA recorded in feral and stray cats from Spain (i.e., 8.7% and 26%) [5,15] and Portugal (30.4%) [40].",

This may suggest that blood is not the ideal tissue for molecular diagnosis of L. infantum infection in cats, as for dogs. Indeed, when comparing different matrixes for the molecular diagnosis of FeL, conjunctival swab (16.7%) and lymph node aspiration (11.7%) showed to be more sensitive than blood (7.8%) [37], as also reported for the diagnosis of CanL [27,43]. Though the number of samples positive with molecular diagnosis (n = 22) was limited in this study, the molecular positivity for L. infantum parallels the occurrence of higher seroprevalence in the examined animals, as reported previously [5,15]. The high percentage of molecular positivity and thus occurrence of L. infantum DNA in seronegative animals (72.7%, 16/22) might either indicate that these cats were at an early stage of the infection or endorse that they are less susceptible compared to dogs [10]. While there is a correlation between molecular and serological positivity in dogs infected for CanL [9,13], there is none between molecular and serological tests for FeL, supporting the different immune responsiveness of dogs and cats to L. infantum.",

As future perspectives, the standardization of procedures for a prompt diagnosis of L. infantum infection and for screening cat populations is a crucial task for a better understanding of the epidemiology of FeL, and the role of cats as reservoir hosts. In addition, prevention measures for providing protection against the infection and treatment strategies for cats infected by L. infantum need to be further addressed.",
