            "text": "In early 2013, a novel strain of avian influenza A (H7N9) virus was detected in humans in Shanghai, Eastern China. The virus had never been reported in humans, and the World Health Organization is taking this novel A/H7N9 seriously. Most H7N9 patients have presented with respiratory tract infection with progression to severe pneumonia and breathing difficulties [1]. As of 30 May, a total of 132 human infections had been reported in 10 Chinese cities [2], of whom 37 died [3]. This yields a case fatality rate of 23.36%, which is substantially higher than seasonal influenza viruses, pandemic 2009 A/H1N1 virus [2], and other subgroups of H7 influenza A viruses (subtypes H7N2, H7N3, and H7N7) [4] in China. Although no person-to-person transmission or epidemiologic link between any of the cases has been identified, infection seemed to have involved contact with infected poultry [5]. The viral isolates from some patients were very similar to those from epidemiologically linked market chickens [5]. Furthermore, detection of more than 100 cases in 3 months compared with roughly 600 human cases of avian influenza A/H5N1 infections in a decade suggests that H7N9 is already more transmissible from poultry to humans than H5N1 [6].",

Although no human infections with the avian influenza A (H7N9) were reported in Guangzhou, human cases have been identified in Jiangxi, Hunan, and Fujian. These three provinces all border Guangzhou, and have frequent population movement and agricultural trade with Guangzhou (Figure 1). On 17 May 2013, the Guangzhou agriculture department announced that chicken samples from a poultry market tested positive for H7 subtype avian influenza virus. This led to Guangzhou being the 11th city in China to conduct emergency response operations related to novel influenza A (H7N9).",

Previous studies have demonstrated the positive correlation between a willingness to adhere to the recommendations around infection control practices and perceived infectiousness and severity of the disease [8-10], perceptions about the effectiveness of control measures [11], and trust in the information being provided by national and international public health authorities [12]. Therefore, learning more about the concerns, attitudes, and behaviors of the public during an infectious disease epidemic is crucial to improve communication efforts by public health officials [13]. Because a considerable number of H7N9 patients engaged in food-related work before symptom onset (including chef, food transporter, poultry seller and slaughter), we conducted face-to-face interviews on attitudes, practices and information needs among employees of food production and operation in Guangzhou, with an effort to assess the preparedness and response of the public, and to facilitate the development of effective prevention strategies against H7N9 infection.",

This result is consistent with other studies that indicated that the internet is increasingly used by the public as the most important source of health-related information [15]. Furthermore, our data also indicate that different methods of obtaining information were significantly associated with different demographic variables. For example, younger and more educated participants were significantly more likely to use the internet, while female and higher-income participants were significantly more likely to watch TV. Females were also more likely to read a newspaper for information. Although few participants (13.72%) chose \u201clisten to the radio\u201d, older participants were more likely to get information from the radio than younger participants. This suggests that the transmission of heath information should consider the demographic characteristics of the target audience in determining which methods to emphasize. In addition, it is worth noting that among the young participants, over one-fifth chose \u201cask friends\u201d rather than seeking a more formal information source.

We also found that of participants 68.27% reported ventilating rooms more frequently than before, and nearly half (48.76%) cancelled or postponed their social events because of A/H7N9. When viewed together, the data from these studies implies that preventative health behaviors become more prevalent during infectious disease epidemics. Furthermore, our data revealed that men were less likely to adopt comprehensive precautionary measures against H7N9, such as washing hands and reducing social events. A deeper understanding of the root causes of such differential risk behavior can help inform the development of dissemination strategies directed at different subgroups. Several previous studies have also indicated that men are less likely to follow behavioral recommendations (such as hand washing) to prevent the transmission of H1N1 influenza, SARS, and other infectious diseases [17-19]. Therefore, men need special targeting for health education, especially to improve their knowledge of influenza, because knowledge of influenza and perceived effectiveness of personal hygiene practices (PHPs) has been shown to be associated with PHPs [20].",

Some causal beliefs and lay perceptions of avian influenza contradicted public health efforts at control [23].

Of those whose response was \u201cno\u201d, the primary reason for unwillingness to accept a vaccine was concern about the safety of the new vaccine. A similar finding was also observed during the pH1N1 pandemic in Hong Kong, which indicated that perceived risk from the pH1N1 vaccine could inhibit pH1N1 vaccine uptake [25]. These results suggest that some participants lacked an understanding of the process of developing influenza vaccine based on the probability of strains. While we only studied a small subset of the population in Guangzhou, if these results were found to be representative, educational materials distributed about the novel influenza vaccine should focus on its safety record, manufacturing, and the similarities between seasonal influenza vaccination and the H7N9 vaccine. These efforts could help to dispel these fears, considering that we found that participants who had received influenza vaccine within recent three years were nearly two times more likely to accept H7N9 vaccine compared with those who had not.",

            "text": "Although the interviewees responded a relative high willingness to receive H7N9 vaccine, in the past three years, only 33.17% actually received the seasonal influenza vaccine. This implied that the current high willingness of accepting vaccine may be attributed to the high case fatality rate of H7N9 reported, and a high proportion of participants fearing they will be infected. As indicated in this study, worry was found to be the strongest predictor of vaccination uptake. Consistent with our finding, Liao et al. also reported that perceived low risk from pH1N1 could inhibit pH1N1 vaccine uptake [21]. That means if the public believes that the severity of A/H7N9 is lower, the acceptance rate may decline. During the early stage of the pH1N1 pandemic (May-June, 2009), international studies assessing willingness to receive the pH1N1 vaccine indicated rates that ranged from 36.9% [26] to 49.6% [27]. However, national data from Australia collected in November and December 2009, when the public believed that the pandemic was coming to an end [8], showed that there had only been a 14% uptake of the vaccine [28]. Therefore, combining our finding with previous published literatures suggests that when levels of worry are generally low, acting to increase the volume of mass media and advertising coverage is likely to increase the perceived efficacy of recommended behaviors, which, in turn, is likely to increase their vaccination uptake.",
