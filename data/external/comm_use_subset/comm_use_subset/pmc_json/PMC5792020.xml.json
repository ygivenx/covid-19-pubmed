It is the causative agent of Rift Valley Fever (RVF) that may affect both humans and animals, mainly ruminants, but also camels. In livestock RVF causes large number of abortions (abortion storms) and high mortalities in young animals. In humans, RVFV infection generally causes a self-limiting, acute and febrile illness, although in some cases disease progresses to more severe forms, with neurological disorders, blindness, hemorrhagic fever or thrombosis [1]. RVFV infection of animals may occur by the bite of an infected mosquito (mainly of the Culex or Aedes genera) or through direct contact with infected animal tissues or fluids [2]. Infection via mosquito bites is considered the primary mode of transmission in the first stages of the epidemic, while contact with contaminated material is more relevant during the amplification stage. RVFV within infected tissues is quite resistant to inactivation and may remain infectious for a few days [2]. In fact, the majority of human cases are likely to occur in farmers, veterinarians or slaughterhouse employees due to contact with infected material [3].",

The public health impact of RVF may also be severe, as demonstrated by the 200,000 people infected and 600 fatal cases reported in the 1977 epidemic in Egypt [5]. Besides that epidemic, Egypt has been affected by RVF in 1993, 1994, 1997, and finally in 2003 [6]. In fact, Mroz and collaborators [7] have recently reported the low level circulation of RVFV in some areas of Egypt.",

            "text": "The continuous importation of viraemic ruminants or camels, mainly from Sudan, was considered the main source of introduction of RVF into Egypt [6]. Furthermore, those importations may also result in the introduction of other exotic diseases such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [8]. RVF is considered to be endemic in sub-Saharan African countries (including Sudan), with major outbreaks associated with periods of heavy rainfall and flooding [9]. Socio-economic changes, with human population growth and the associated increased demand for meat, or changes in the meat market prices could result in greater controlled and uncontrolled transboundary movements of livestock. A consequence of all those changes would be an increase of the risk of introduction of RVFV into areas of the Mediterranean basin and the Middle East [3]. While surveillance and diagnostic methods for RVFV are available, RVFV control is hindered by the difficulties of vector control, and the fact that vaccines are only available for ruminants, with either inactivated vaccines (with a limited efficacy) or live attenuated vaccines (with a residual pathogenic effect) [3,10]. Therefore, the best strategy to protect countries at risk of RVFV introduction is the implementation of regional monitoring and control programmes in endemic countries, as well as the establishment of early warning systems in the countries at risk. The Egyptian authorities implement both measures to prevent the introduction of RVFV (vaccination of imported animals, quarantines and testing of a proportion of imported animals) and measures to prevent the spread (vaccination of the Egyptian susceptible population). If those measures were effective, there would be no risk of RVFV introduction and spread, however, their efficacy has not been evaluated, and some deficiencies have been identified in the past [6]. Given the limitation of resources, risk-based methods (i.e. focusing on those areas and/or practices that pose the highest risk) may be considered as a cost-effective alternative for the surveillance of RVF in Egypt. Many of those risk-based methods are data-driven, which rely on comprehensive information about disease-associated events. In a data-scarce context, knowledge-driven methods, which rely on the previous information on the factors associated with disease occurrence, offer an alternative approach to identify areas at risk [11].",

For buffaloes and camels, as density raster maps were not available, the data on the number of animals by governorate was obtained from OIE-WAHID, densities were calculated and maps were rasterized. Density maps for the different species (cattle, sheep, goats, buffaloes and camels) are shown in Fig 1-upper row. All animals of the susceptible species (cattle, sheep, goats, buffaloes and camels) are meant to be vaccinated twice a year (MALRE personal communication). Data on the number of vaccine doses administered the first and second semesters of 2014 and 2015 by animal species and governorates were provided by the ED-MALRE. For the year 2015, the vaccine coverage (i.e. the proportion of animals correctly vaccinated, that is, that received two vaccine doses) by species and governorates were calculated taking into account the censuses by species for the different governorates (Fig 1-middle row). By multiplying the animal density data layer by the vaccine coverage layer, we obtained a layer of the density of susceptible animals by species (Fig 1-lower row). Then, the weights for the relative susceptibility of the different host species (see below the determination of weights) were applied, and the results combined to produce a map to represent the density of all susceptible hosts. Finally, that map was standardized, i.e. put in a continuous scale from 0, equivalent to the minimum value (density), to 1, equivalent to the maximum value (density). Standardization allows the combination of layers with different characteristics/units to produce the final risk maps.",

This suggests that Cx. pipiens habitat consists mainly of areas of high primary productivity, maintained with very little change throughout the year [21].

In 2015, the year we used to account for the vaccine coverage in our model, 7.3 million doses of vaccine were administered as compared to 5.9 million in 2014. The analysis of the vaccine coverage data evidences a great degree of heterogeneity in the vaccination among species and areas (Fig 1). Taking into account that 2 doses of vaccine are needed, cattle had the highest level of vaccine coverage with about 60%, while the coverage was about 35% for buffaloes and about 30% for sheep and goats. There were also significant differences among areas, including some governorates with a high census of domestic ruminants and very low vaccine coverages. For example vaccine coverages in cattle were 20% in Asyut, 30% in Sharqia, 30% in Beheira, or 30% in Beni Suef, while in other species coverage was even lower (Fig 1).",

Therefore, even though the source of the outbreak could not be determined, the possibility of introduction of the disease from Sudan by camels was considered the most likely explanation. In the following epidemics (1993, 1994, 1997 and 2003), importation of camels, mainly from Sudan, was also considered as a possible source of introduction, although no proper epidemiological investigations were carried out, and alternative mechanisms were considered [6,26]. As a result, the role of camels in the epidemiology of RVFV remains unclear. In fact, it has been suggested that camels may be essential for RVFV transmission in some ecosystems where their density is high, which would allow viral amplification and transmission to alternative hosts, but not in others [34]. Furthermore, data on factors such as duration of viraemia, infectiousness to mosquitos, or the risk of infection of humans from contaminated products remain unknown, and further studies on camels would be required. Despite those uncertainties, camels are considered susceptible to RVFV, and the virus has been isolated from blood from healthy, naturally infected camels in Egypt and Sudan [32,35]. While RVFV infections in camels are usually mild or asymptomatic, abortion waves were observed in RVF outbreaks in Kenya and Egypt [34]. In the 2010 epidemic in Mauritania, clinical signs other than abortions were observed in camels, either a peracute form with sudden death within 24 hours; or an acute form with fever and systemic lesions, that resulted in death when haemorrhagic signs occurred [36]. RVFV infections in camels have been recorded in most sub-Saharan African countries, with prevalences ranging from 3.0 to 51.9 percent [34]. In fact, RVF is thought to be endemic in sub-Saharan African countries (including Sudan), with large epidemics occurring after heavy rainfall and flooding [9]. Phylogenetic analyses carried out in Sudan with RVFV strains from the 2007 and 2010 epidemics, indicated that they were the result of multiple introductions from eastern Africa [37]. Since then, there were evidences of circulation of RVFV during the inter-epidemic period: in 2014\u20132015, 9.6% of camels in Khartoum State (Sudan) had RVFV antibodies, including at least one positive born after the last reported epidemic [38].",

In contrast to camels, the data revealed a more seasonal pattern, with an increase of importations in the months of July, August and September, just before the major Islamic feast of Eid al-Adha (\u201cSacrifice Feast\") in those years. Importation of cattle also poses a threat for Egypt, in fact, the epidemics of foot and mouth disease (serotype A) and of lumpy skin disease that affected Egypt in 2006 were both linked to the importation of animals from Ethiopia [40]. Increase of importations of cattle and camels into Egypt may be explained by the growing demand of meat. While between 2006 and 2015 the human population in Egypt grew a 19.9% [41], the population of ruminants and camels in the country only grew a 3.2% [42]. According to the World Bank projections, the human population in Egypt is expected to continue growing at a rate of almost 2% per year in the following decade, and therefore legal (and potentially illegal) trade of animals into Egypt is expected to increase.",

Those movements within Egypt would contribute the spread of RVFV in the event of introduction of the virus, as evidenced in other countries [43,44]. The EVS characterized the network of animal markets by collecting information on the location, but also on several characteristics of 273 animal markets distributed throughout Egypt. That combined with the slaughterhouse data allows having a basic picture of the animal movement patterns within the country, which offers an alternative approach in countries without the resources to have a comprehensive recording of animal movements. That information is very useful for planning risk-based surveillance strategies (i.e. target those markets where detection of a particular disease is more likely), with the advantage the criteria may be adapted to each specific disease. The collection of more comprehensive information on for example the number of animals by species or the origins and destinations of the animals that went across those markets, would allow a much clearer picture of the animal movement network, and is therefore recommended The animal market network in Egypt is mainly composed of small markets, which basically operate once a week. Interestingly, almost 40% of the markets traded animals from different governorates, which means that infectious diseases are likely to spread efficiently once introduced into the country. In relation to the species, 2% of markets traded exclusively camels, and a 17% further traded camels plus other species susceptible to RVFV. Most of the markets are located in the areas beside the Nile river and its delta, but there are also animal markets alongside the Mediterranean coast, or even in the Sahara desert (Farafra market). Of the 273 markets, only 17 were in the governorates bordering Sudan, where smuggling of small ruminants was considered more likely. The risk-ranking score for markets varied between 5 and 15, with a mean value of 7.9. The markets with the highest risk of RVFV transmission were in the proximities or within the main cities (e.g. Cairo, Minya or Aswan), while most of the camel slaughterhouses were near Cairo. That proximity to urban areas results in an increased risk of RVFV transmission to humans (zoonotic risk). In contrast to camels, all cattle imported into Egypt are slaughtered within the quarantines to which they arrive, which are located in remote areas, far from populated areas.",

However, the vaccination strategy is unlikely be effective, as camels imported from Sudan receive a single dose and camels imported from Ethiopia receive two doses, but with only 7 days difference. The inactivated vaccines against RVFV require a booster 3\u20136 months after initial vaccination, followed by yearly boosters [45]. Besides, the efficacy of the inactivated vaccine has not been tested in camels [45], and further research on that field would be needed. While it has been argued that the long distance that the camels from Sudan need to walk to reach the Egyptian border would be enough to prevent the importation of infected animals, there are still many uncertainties in relation to RVFV infection in camels, and in any case, that measure does not comply with OIE rules for importation of live animals [6]. On the other hand, means of transportation seem to be changing as at least some of the camels are currently transported on trucks rather than on foot (MALRE personal communication) and transmission (either direct or indirect) during the transport of camels cannot be ruled out. Seroconversions in Madagascar highlands evidenced the local circulation of RVFV in periods in which mosquitoes were rare or inactive, suggesting that other forms of transmission seem likely [46]. Even though camels are quarantined, for 3 days if coming from Sudan and 10\u201316 days if coming from Ethiopia, the efficiency of clinical detection of RVFV infection is limited by the fact that infections in camels are often unapparent. Besides, about 10% of the camels imported from Sudan and Ethiopia in the last 5 years were tested against RVF by RT-PCR, and were negative (MALRE personal communication). However, the sensitivity of such non-statistically based testing protocol for detecting the infection, if present, is questionable. While the measures currently implemented in camels are likely to reduce some of the risk of RVFV introduction into Egypt, their effect is likely to be limited. Similar conclusions may be drawn from the strategies implemented in cattle with the particularities that all cattle are slaughtered within the quarantine premises, where the risk of RVFV transmission by vectors was estimated to be very low. Therefore, vaccination of imported cattle is unlikely to have a significant effect on the reduction of the risk of RVFV introduction into Egypt.",

Despite the increase in the number of vaccine doses administered in 2015 as compared to 2014, the level of vaccine coverage (30% in sheep and goats, 35% in buffaloes and 60% in cattle) would not be enough to prevent the transmission in the event of RVFV introduction into the country, in particular in those governorates where the level of vaccination is below average. Differences in the density of susceptible species throughout the country combined with the heterogenous application of vaccination programs among areas and species results in the identification of some areas of high density of susceptible hosts of RVFV, which is where efforts should be focused. Failures in the local application of vaccination programs were identified as one of the causes of previous epidemics of RVFV in Egypt [6]. There were also areas where high levels of vaccine coverage were reached resulting in a significant reduction of the risk of RVFV transmission.

Model results may be influenced by the accuracy of some model inputs (e.g. vaccine coverage), or the uncertainty about some model parameters (e.g. susceptibility of the different species).

There is no data on the duration of viraemia in camels, but as camels imported from Sudan stay in the quarantine for only 3 days, it seems possible that they may remain infectious after being released from the quarantine, even if RVFV transmission by vectors within the quarantine was not possible. On the other hand, RVFV transmission within those quarantines may also occur by direct contact with tissues, body fluids or fomites of infected animals.",

            "text": "While all cattle are slaughtered within quarantine facilities, imported camels (potentially infected) may be taken to animal markets or to slaughterhouses after the quarantine period, and those would be the places where RVFV transmission would be more likely. The risk of RVFV transmission by vectors at the 273 animal markets was rather variable (between 0 and 0.84), but the mean risk was quite high, 0.60. In the case of the 18 camel slaughterhouses, the risk of RVFV transmission by vectors was quite high (mean risk of 0.59\u20130.60), and there was in fact less variability than in the case of animal markets. Establishment of an effective surveillance system in the areas surrounding key markets and camel slaughterhouses may allow the early detection of RVF and the timely establishment of control measures. That may include improving passive surveillance by raising farmers\u2019 awareness for the reporting of any symptom compatible with RVF and providing the mechanisms that allowed a prompt laboratory confirmation of any suspected case. Also, the establishment of some active (sentinel) surveillance in the locations identified as having the highest risk would be essential. Besides the risk of RVFV transmission by vectors, the slaughtering of animals, which in the case of cattle is carried out within quarantine premises, poses an important risk for humans by exposure to body fluids or tissues of infected animals. Infectivity of blood during the acute phase of infection in mammals is high [2]. Moreover, given that RVFV is quite resistant to inactivation, infected tissues may remain infectious for a period of a few days [2]. In fact, Nicholas and collaborators [48] concluded that practices such as skinning or slaughtering animals were significantly associated with the risk of RVFV infection. A cross-sectional survey on 1181 abattoir workers in 15 governorates of Egypt after the 1993 RVFV epidemic evidenced a 2% prevalence of anti-RVF IgM antibodies [49]. Antibodies were found in 9 of 31 slaughterhouses and 8 of 15 governorates, including several areas where no clinical disease had been reported. Therefore, Egyptian abattoirs in which imported cattle or camels are slaughtered should implement measures (e.g. use of personal protective equipment) to prevent the infection of the personnel.",

Illegal trade of animals through the borders is likely to occur, but its relevance in relation to the risk of RVFV introduction is difficult to assess, and would require further studies. On the other hand, the possibility of RVFV spread (potentially to distant areas) through the movement of infected (viraemic) humans and subsequent infection of competent vectors remains controversial. While for some authors humans infected by RVFV may develop a viremia sufficient to infect na\u00efve mosquitoes [50], others consider humans as dead-end hosts [3]. Also, wind-borne transportation of infected mosquitos has been proposed [5], but not demonstrated scientifically.",
