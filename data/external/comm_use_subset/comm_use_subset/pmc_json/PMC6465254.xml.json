            "text": "Phage display technology is regarded as an important tool used for the discovery of novel ligands against various targets of interest1. It has since been widely employed for the in vitro development of monoclonal antibodies, trading places with the conventional hybridoma technology which was still mainly animal host dependent2,3. A detailed review on antibody phage display is provided by Ponsel, et al.4, Tohidkia, et al.5 and Zhao, et al.6. To identify a target specific antibody, an in vitro selection process underlined by the affinity enrichment concept known as biopanning is commonly used2. The affinity enrichment process involves several steps: immobilization of target antigen, binding of phage to target antigen, elimination of unbound phage and elution of phage7. The target antigens used for biopanning includes recombinant proteins, peptides, tissues and whole cells8,9. The main assurance is that these proteins are mainly prepared with good purity and yield. This is evident with the reports of antibody development for dengue virus10, herpes simplex virus11, cytomegalovirus11, Zika virus12, Ebola virus7,13, Plasmodium species14, Mycobacterium tuberculosis15, and nematodes responsible for filariasis16.",

            "text": "Nevertheless, several complications can be anticipated during antigen expression that hinders the availability of a target antigen for biopanning. Initially, solubility of the antigen is governed by the secretion of antigen into the cytoplasm (soluble form), periplasm (soluble form) and as inclusion body (insoluble form due to protein aggregation). Soluble proteins are desirable for protein purification whilst insoluble proteins must be solubilized, purified and re-folded. To overcome this issue, one has to go through a vigorous optimization process which includes cultivation temperature and conditions, expression using different E. coli expression hosts, co-expression with molecular chaperones, folding modulators and fusion partner proteins. A detailed explanation of recombinant protein expression has been reviewed by Gupta and Shukla17 and Rosano and Ceccarelli18. On top of that, another obstacle in the quest for recombinant protein production is the purification process. Protein purification from crude extracts using chromatography approaches caters to different properties of the protein. A common approach to capture the desired protein independent of unwanted proteins is by using affinity tags like His6x and glutathione-S-transferase to facilitate the purification process19\u201321. Even so, the purification scheme also requires tedious optimization in order to acquire a product of highest purity. All in all, the recombinant antigen has to be pure and abundant before it can be used for biopanning. Hence, this presents a major limitation when attempting to develop antibodies against challenging target antigens.",

            "text": "In light of this, the establishment of a viable procedure for the selection of a desired antigen in crude preparation is of major interest. Herein, we propose a proof of concept panning process coined \u2018Yin-Yang\u2019 panning using antigen preparations devoid of purification for biopanning. We applied the process to isolate monoclonal scFv against the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) nucleoprotein (MERS-NP). The \u2018Yin-Yang\u2019 concept takes its name from the Taoist concept of duality in striking a balance to form a whole. Here, the crude extract consisting of the antigen of interest in its native form alongside the endogenous E. coli proteins are used to achieve a balance between positive and negative selection. Due to the complex microenvironment during target enrichment, reducing non-specific binding interaction to E. coli proteins and blocking agents is paramount to allow effective antigen-antibody interaction to take place. A capture and elimination step was introduced prior to biopanning to remove the influence of binders against the non-target proteins. The complete workflow is outlined in the following schematic diagram (Fig. 1). The proposed approach was able to isolate monoclonal scFv clones against the MERS-NP utilizing a crude preparation. The antibodies were verified and identified for specificity against MERS-NP. This approach highlights the possibility of carrying out antibody phage display biopanning using crude antigens to identify antigen specific monoclonal antibodies.",

The overexpression of rUbi and rMERS-NP were also visible in their respective crude preparations as a thicker band. Purification of the rUbi was carried out and the presence of the antigens were confirmed via Western Blotting using the His6-tagged secondary antibodies (Fig. 2b).

            "text": "Initially, a proof of concept was conducted to investigate the binding efficiency of the anti-Ubiquitin (\u03b1Ubi) scFv phage towards rUbi in the complex microenvironment during biopanning. A total of four different conditions (complex microenvironment) were tested stepwise. First, both \u03b1Ubi and M13KO7 phages were assimilated into different blocking agents: PBS, 2% PTM buffer, E. coli lysate and combinations of 2% PTM buffer with E. coli lysate. Phage titres were determined after binding between \u03b1Ubi to rUbi and M13KO7 phage to rUbi. The unbound phages were collected as \u2018Blocked phages\u2019 and bound phages as \u2018Eluted phages\u2019 (Fig. 3). Based on the phage titres, \u03b1Ubi phage showed good binding capacity towards rUbi in the presence of 2% PTM and E. coli lysate. Some amount of M13KO7 phage was also rescued despite incubation in different sets of blocking agents. Nevertheless, it should be highlighted that the combination of PTM buffer and lysate managed to block a large amount of \u03b1Ubi and M13KO7 phage in separate sample sets. The extent of blocking was further determined by calculating the ratios of the difference between blocked \u03b1Ubi in a mixture of PTM buffer and lysate against other sets of blocking agents. There was approximately a 10-fold difference between \u03b1Ubi blocked with a combination of PTM buffer and lysate against the PTM buffer only and lysate only. A 0.83-fold difference was recorded between the PTM buffer and lysate combination against PBS only, where the cut off was 1-fold. The similar ratios of difference were determined for blocked M13KO7 sample sets at a cut off of 1-fold. The amount of blocked M13KO7 in the PTM buffer and lysate combination was higher by 7-fold with respect to M13KO7 in PBS only, 6.73-fold for M13KO7 in lysate only and 0.67-fold for M13KO7 in PTM only. It showed that the combination of PTM buffer and lysate was able to capture more unbound phages than other blocking agents.",

The phage titres across 4 samples were determined as 108\u2013109 cfu/mL, 106\u2013107 cfu/mL, 108\u2013109 cfu/mL and 104\u2013105 cfu/mL for \u2018Blocked \u03b1Ubi\u2019, \u2018Eluted \u03b1Ubi\u2019, \u2018Blocked M13KO7\u2019 and \u2018Eluted M13KO7\u2019, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S1a).

The ratios of difference between unbound and eluted fractions for \u03b1Ubi phage across 4 samples were 57-fold, 325-fold, 169-fold and 172-fold (Fig. 4a). The fold change of unbound and eluted M13KO7 across 4 samples were large (10,000-fold, 43,333-fold, 12,916-fold and 40,000-fold). The highest ratio of difference was presented by M13KO7 blocked in PTM buffer, followed by a combination of PTM buffer and lysate and lysate only.

It was 55\u2013180-fold in differences between the eluted \u03b1Ubi phage with eluted M13KO7 for previous simulation whereas the differences dropped to only 2\u20135-fold, with the exception for sample 3 (300-fold). This was due to the abrupt drop of eluted M13KO7. The binding capacity of \u03b1Ubi phage towards rUbi in crude fraction was consistent with previous simulations, as the similar amount of eluted \u03b1Ubi phages was determined to be in the range of 106\u2013107 cfu/mL.",

The approach utilized E. coli lysate and PTM to block the microwells, followed by incubation of phages with PTM buffer in the prepared microwells. This procedure imposes a capture and elimination effect to the phage mixture, enabling non-specific phages to be preoccupied from interfering in the binding activity. Initially, \u03b1Ubi and M13KO7 phages were subjected to binding with purified rUbi. The unbound phages were collected as \u2018Blocked phages\u2019 and bound phages as \u2018Eluted phages\u2019 (Fig. 5). The overall phage titres for unbound M13KO7 were higher compared to the previous optimization without lysate preblocking and phage preincubation by approximately 25 to 100-fold. Also, the differences of unbound and bound M13KO7 were larger compared to the last optimization by more than 10-fold.

A higher number of unbound M13KO7 phage at 1010 cfu/mL was rescued or determined (Supplementary Fig. S2a). This was a 10-fold increase in comparison to the biopanning process devoid of preblocking and preincubation, indicating that the Yin-Yang process was more efficient in removing non-specific phage particles. However, higher numbers of eluted M13KO7 phage particles were also obtained indicating more background phages were recovered during the simulation. Nevertheless, the bound \u03b1Ubi phage was slightly higher than the bound M13KO7 by 4\u201332-fold. The ratio of difference between unbound and bound \u03b1Ubi phage was determined (Fig. 6a).

Based on the phage titres in Supplementary Fig. S2b, the amount of unbound M13KO7 (1010 cfu/mL) were similar to that of the biopanning simulation using purified rUbi. This indicates the efficiency of E. coli lysate and PTM buffer blocking to remove non-specific interaction from crude fractions. As for bound phages, the number of bound M13KO7 (104\u2013106 cfu/mL) however was almost the same as the bound \u03b1Ubi phages (104\u2013105 cfu/mL) with a difference of only 0.5-4-fold. This pattern was expected, as the difference of bound phages in previous simulation (with pure rUbi) was also minimal. Notably, the amount of bound M13KO7 for sample 4 (PTM buffer and lysate) was 10-fold higher than \u03b1Ubi phage. This showed a dominant population of empty phages in the eluted phages rather than antibody presenting phages. The highest fold change between unbound and bound \u03b1Ubi phage was recorded from sample 2 (PTM only) at 6,800-fold, followed by sample 1 (PBS only) (5,500-fold) and sample 4 (PTM and lysate) (4,300-fold) (Fig. 6b). On the other hand, the highest ratio of difference between unbound and bound M13KO7 was determined from sample 1 (PBS only) at 716,000-fold, followed by the PTM buffer and lysate combination (254,000-fold). This implied that the \u2018Yin\u2019 step was sufficient to deplete the non-specific binding of M13KO7. Moreover, the binding capacity of \u03b1Ubi phage towards crude rUbi was not affected by the \u2018Yin\u2019 effect, but in contrast helped to control the interference of background phages.",

Unfortunately, the problems of expression and purification of E. coli produced recombinant proteins are atypical. Some recombinant antigens have solubility and purity problems18, stability issues, difficult to be immobilized24 and exist in multiple morphologies25. Due to these reasons, there is a need to develop an alternative procedure for selection towards relevant antigens presented in a complex mixture especially in situations when rapid antibody development is required or if the purified target is unavailable.

            "text": "The\u2019Yin-Yang\u2019 panning method is somewhat akin to the negative/positive selection panning strategies whereby negative selection aims to remove unwanted binders and allowing positive selection of targeted binders24,26,27. The main difference between this study and the previous methods is the approach and target of negative selection. The target for negative selection is the unspecific antibody phage binders that binds to proteins other than the target antigen. In light of this, the blocking mixture is mainly used to deplete the negative binders. In the previous approaches, polyclonal and mAbs are used to target the unrelated epitopes presented on phages in order to select and remove them, allowing the remaining phage clones to select for antibodies that have affinity towards specific epitopes24,26,27. Moreover, the \u2018Yin-Yang\u2019 method offers two rounds of negative selection during a single round of biopanning, one before positive selection and one simultaneously carried out with the positive selection. This creates a competitive situation where a small number of unbound negative phage will compete with a large number of unbound positive phage for the target antigen in the presence of target-unrelated proteins. We demonstrated an inexpensive immobilisation strategy of target-unrelated proteins onto a solid phase for negative selection, whereby unrelated proteins preoccupy non-specific binders, either bound to surface or in phage mixture. The limitation of this method is the inability to remove the non-specific binders prior to binding. However, imposing a more stringent washing process during phage elution can compensate for this. Therefore, the phages binding to unspecific proteins can be washed away under stringent conditions, subsequently rescuing bound phages that is immobilised on the plate. Additionally, this method can also be adapted to membrane-bound proteins by using the western blotting system reported by Ding, et al.28 and Liu, et al.29. A comparison of other published enrichment strategies and the \u2018Yin-Yang\u2019 method is provided in Table 2.",

The mixture of PTM and E. coli lysate exerts the highest blocking effect for both \u03b1Ubi and M13KO7.

Thus, a competitive selection could be imposed by saturating the non-specific binders, M13KO7 with the competitive proteins (lysate and PTM) thereby promoting binding of \u03b1Ubi towards purified rUbi32. Despite the presence of other unknown E. coli proteins in the crude fraction of rUbi with the actual concentration of rUbi being expected to be lower than the purified rUbi, the binding capability of \u03b1Ubi is still unaffected as shown in phage ELISA assay upon affinity selection against crude rUbi.

Proper blocking of the surface with blocking agent such as skimmed milk helps to inhibit unspecific binding33\u201335 and phage preincubation can enhance the reduction of unspecific binders even to the treated surface36. The idea of using E. coli lysate proteins as one of the competitive proteins in biopanning originates from the whole cell biopanning approach, where target antigen and un-relevant proteins are presented in the cell lysate mixture33. Theoretically, it could be expected that non-binders were depleted during the \u2018Yin-Yang\u2019 step, subsequently allowing free positive binders to initiate binding against the target during affinity selection. The \u2018Yin-Yang\u2019 step complements the blocking effect by the lysate and PTM, thereby allowing more non-binders to be trapped. This was evident as a higher number of unbound M13KO7 was recorded. However, throughout the biopanning simulation against rUbi in purified and crude forms, there were increasing numbers of non-binders being rescued, close to the amount of positive binders rescued. This could be attributed to insufficient washing that resulted in the rescue of non-binders together with positive binders during elution37. Despite this, the rescued phages from the crude rUbi were amplified and subjected to phage ELISA assay to determine the best performing sample. The best performing sample was the lysate and PTM combination that gave the highest readout after background subtraction. Hence, we demonstrated that the \u2018Yin-Yang\u2019 step is crucial during biopanning against crude antigen while the combination of PTM and lysate can help to control and reduce the disturbance of non-binders during antigen binding. Nevertheless, due to the rise of background phage elution, washing stringency should be revised accordingly. The rationale of coating the phage pre-incubation well with lysate and then with PTM is to inhibit the plastic binders from interfering in the optimization steps38 and for further negative selection.",

The na\u00efve library was constructed from 52 healthy donors comprising of three ethnic groups. This is aimed to expand the diversity of antibody repertoire for a highly diverse antibody library39. The \u2018single pot\u2019 antibody library repertoire has a universal characteristic, which makes it suitable to be employed for antibody selection against a wide range of target antigens39,40. To generate a library of highest possible diversity, size and quality, combinatorial mixing of heavy and light chains was performed to create all possible gene combinations. The V-gene repertoire was amplified using a gene specific primer set with a high coverage of antibody genes5. In addition to that, the genetic diversity from donor samples of three ethnic groups may offer additional sequence diversity. Cloning efficiency was improved by performing an intermediary cloning to ensure highest incorporation of full antibody gene sequences into the destination phagemid vector. The library generated has a modest diversity of 109 that is sufficient for antibody selection. Despite na\u00efve libraries have been reported to yield low affinity binders, it is still an important source for antibodies. A correlation between library diversity with antibody affinity was proposed to be directly proportional41. Even so, the low affinity binders can undergo in vitro affinity maturation to improve their binding affinity and specificity5,39,42. Kappa light chain isotype was solely used with the heavy chain IgM isotype repertoire for this na\u00efve library as more kappa antibodies are reported in the human peripheral blood than lambda antibodies. This is because rearrangement of kappa isotypes occurs earlier but when both kappa alleles failed to rearrange productively, this is followed by lambda rearrangement43. However, this ratio changes upon encountering antigens, suggesting that light chain rearrangement occasionally takes place in B cell after the onset of somatic hypermutation44. This is in line with the structural and physiochemical studies of kappa and lambda antibodies, with both exhibiting differential characteristics during adaptive immune response43,45. However, in this context, we sought to generate a na\u00efve library for kappa antibodies while further studies on differential properties of lambda and kappa antibodies will be carried out later.",

The low enrichment ratio was expected due to the loss of binders to interfering proteins from the crude fraction. The method is able to impose both the competitive and subtractive effect onto non-specific binders in order to increase the possibility of positive binders to bind the target in extremely low amounts. Reproducibility of this method is fairly good as good enrichment was achieved in several attempts using other in-house antibody libraries against different targets (data not shown). MAb selection was done and 3 full antibody clones were obtained for this work. Based on the sequence analysis, the V-gene combination of clone rMERS-NP-A4 is IGHV4-IGKV2, IGHV1-IGKV2 for rMERS-NP-C8 and IGHV3-IGKV1 for rMERS-NP-G12. The antibody fragments were expressed, purified and their binding specificity determined towards rMERS-NP. rMERS-NP-A4 binds specifically to rMERS-NP with very minimal background signal while rMERS-NP-C8 and rMERS-NP-G12 presented some degree of background signal indicating the clones as low performing clones. We noticed a slight difference in the antibody band migration which may likely be due to the introduction of chemical modifications46, which in this case is the biotinylation that contributed to the retardation of gel migration. In addition, previous reports examined the efficiency of biotinylation by comparing the gel migration of biotinylated products against non-biotinylated products in the presence of streptavidin and reveal a slower migrating of biotinylated products47\u201351. Despite all three antibody fragments underwent biotinylation, the gel shift effect was more drastic for rC8scFv at approximately 3\u20134 kDa difference in comparison to rA4scFv and rG12scFv.",

            "text": "Previously reported neutralizing mAbs against MERS-CoV were specific to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) glycoprotein of MERS-CoV52. The RBD of MERS-CoV binds to human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4) (cellular receptor) and gains entry into the target cell for viral infection. Most of the reported mAbs has been focused on the neutralization of RBD to block the interaction of RBD to hDPP4 and extreme potency has been exhibited by mAbs targeting RBD. Despite hDPP4 is another potential target for neutralization, it is also a particularly important molecule in the immune regulation of T cell activation and chemokine function. Therefore, clinical use of it is unadvisable as adverse side effects may arise53,54. A recent report combined mAbs specific to RBD and non-RBD (other domains on S glycoprotein) to initiate neutralizing enhancement as different antigenic sites on S proteins are targeted55. Nevertheless, immune escape is always endeavoured by coronaviruses by expression of mutant S proteins while nucleocapsid proteins have less mutations. The abundant NP of MERS-CoV makes it another potential candidate target other than the S proteins. NPs are responsible for viral genomic RNA packaging, transcription and assembly56. In a previous report, three mAbs against MERS-CoV RBD with exceptional potency was found to originate from the IGHV1-69 heavy chain family57. Interestingly, in this study, we found that rMERS-NP-C8 clone targeting the NP also belongs to IGHV1-69 heavy chain family. Of note is that the IGHV1-69 gene was also found to be utilized by other antiviral antibodies targeting HIV-1, influenza virus and hepatitis C virus54.",

This permits antigens in different states (complex mixture, low purity, protein cocktails) to gain excess for affinity binding without the limitations of protein purity and yield. It is likely that optimization of this approach is required for different antigens produced in different host cells due to the differences in cell contents. The generated kappa light chain scFv library was able to generate mAbs against MERS-CoV NP using the proposed approach with crude rMERS-NP. Therefore, this kappa exclusive na\u00efve library is potentially useful for isolation of antibodies against other interesting antigens in the future. In conclusion, the \u2018Yin-Yang\u2019 panning together with the kappa na\u00efve scFv library can be used as an alternative selection process for mAb generation against challenging target antigens.",

The resulting vectors were named pRSET-BH6 A4scFv, pRSET-BH6 C8scFv and pRSET-BH6 G12scFv. Expression of A4, C8 and G12 was performed with SHuffle\u00ae T7 with pRARE3 for in vivo biotinylation. The expression condition for biotinylated A4, C8 and G12 was optimized to 24 \u00b0C, 140 rpm for 20 h with IPTG induction at OD600nm 0.8 at a final concentration of 0.8 mM and 50 \u03bcM d-biotin. The inclusion bodies of biotinylated A4, C8 and G12 were solubilized using 8 M urea buffer, pH 8 (8 M Urea, 0.1 M NaH2PO4, 0.01 M Tris). The urea crude fractions were subjected to protein purification using Ni-NTA Agarose gravity column (Qiagen, Germany) at denaturing conditions. Initially, the column was equilibrated with 8 M urea buffer at pH 8 followed by sample loading. Then, the column was subjected to washing with 10 mL of 8 M urea buffer (pH 8). Step elutions were performed by 8 M urea buffer at pH 6.3, 5.9 and lastly 4.5, 2 mL elution fractions were collected stepwise. The protein fractions were analysed on SDS-PAGE. The last 5 fractions from A4, C8 and G12 were combined and subjected to buffer exchange using Amicon\u00ae Ultra 0.5 mL Centrifugal Filters (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). The antibody fragments were dissolved in 1X PBS buffer (pH 7.4). Western blotting was then performed using streptavidin-HRP (1:5000) (Thermo Scientific, MA, USA) to detect and confirm the respective antibody fragments.",
