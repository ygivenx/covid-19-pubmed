            "text": "To initiate infection viruses must bind to an appropriate host cell. Selectivity of binding is ensured by attachment proteins on the virion, tailored to recognize one -or at the most- a limited number of cell surface molecules. Remarkably, a large number of viruses, representative of at least 11 distinct families several of which of clinical and/or veterinary importance, use sialic acid (Sia) as receptor determinant. Owing to differential modification, Sia structural diversity exceeds that of any other monosaccharide [1]. The most common type of Sia substitution, O-acetylation at carbon atoms C4, C7, C8 and/or C9, occurs in a host-, organ- and even cell-specific fashion such that even individual cells of the same type and tissue may differ in their Sia expression profile [2]\u2013[4]. Viruses have evolved to selectively use particular Sia variants and their attachment proteins are high-specificity sialolectins, the binding of which might depend on the identity of the penultimate residue in the sugar chain, the type of glycosidic linkage and/or the presence or absence of substitutions [5]\u2013[9]. Ultimately, this preference in Sia receptor usage affects host-, organ-, and cell-tropism [10]\u2013[14], the course and outcome of infection [15]\u2013[18] as well as the efficacy of intra- and cross-species transmission [14], [19], all to extents not yet fully appreciated.",

            "text": "The hemagglutinin-esterases (HEs) are a class of Sia-binding envelope glycoproteins found in some negative-stranded RNA viruses, namely in influenza C and infectious salmon anemia virus (family Orthomyxoviridae; [5], [20]), but also in toro- and coronaviruses, positive-stranded RNA viruses in the order Nidovirales\n[21], [22]. From phylogenetic and comparative structural analyses it appears that toro- and coronaviruses acquired their HE proteins separately via horizontal gene transfer, with an (hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion) HEF-like protein as progenitor [22]\u2013[25]. Like influenza C virus HEF, most nidovirus HEs bind to 9-O-acetylated (9-O-Ac) Sias and, correspondingly, display sialate-9-O-acetylesterase receptor-destroying enzyme activity [25]. Murine coronaviruses, however, occur in two closely related biotypes that differ in HE ligand/substrate preference. One of these -represented by mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strain DVIM- displays the presumptive ancestral specificity and targets 9-O-Ac-Sias, while the other -represented by MHV strain S- appears to have evolved to use 4-O-Ac-Sias instead [6], [25]\u2013[27] (for supplementary introduction see Text S1 and Figure S1). Given the stereochemical differences between these Sia variants (Figure 1) and the essentially different requirements for ligand and substrate recognition by the respective HEs, the question arises how this major shift in receptor usage was achieved and what changes must have occurred in the receptor-binding and O-acetylesterase domains to make this transition possible.",

Based on these observations, we anticipated and speculated [23] that this plasticity might have allowed for even more substantial adjustments in the RBS of the murine coronavirus HE as to produce an entirely novel binding site specific for 4-O-acetylated Sias.",

The receptor determinants in HSG could be destroyed by treatment with MHV-S HE-Fc, but not by treatment with BCoV-Mebus HE-Fc (a sialate-9-O-acetylesterase; Figure 2B). No binding of MHV-S HE0-Fc was observed to bovine submaxillary mucin (BSM), a glycoconjugate devoid of 4-O-Ac-Sias (Figure 2A; [30]). The MHV-S HE ectodomain, released from HE-Fc by thrombin-cleavage, retained proper sialate-4-O-acetylesterase activity when assayed for substrate specificity with a synthetic di-O-acetylated Sia (5-N-acetyl-4,9-di-O-acetylneuraminic acid \u03b1-methylglycoside, \u03b1Neu4,5,9Ac32Me; Figure 2C). In hemagglutination assays, MHV-S HE0 specifically bound to 4-O-acetylated Sias (Figure 2D). The combined findings show that the recombinant MHV-S HE proteins are biologically active, both as Fc fusion proteins (Figures 2A and B) and after the removal of the Fc tail by thrombin-cleavage (Figures 2C and D), which we take as an indication for proper folding and protein stability.",

The MHV-S HE receptor-binding site (RBS), like that of BCoV-Mebus HE, is composed of 5 surface exposed loops, four of which extend from the conserved 8-stranded \u201cSwiss role\u201d core-structure (loops R1 through R4; Figures 3C and 4A) and one originating from the E-domain (E-loop). Whereas the R1-, R2- and E-loops of the BCoV-Mebus and MHV-S HE sites are almost identical, the R3- and R4-loops adopt different conformations in the two proteins as result of amino acid insertions in MHV HE (Figures 3C and 4A). Two other conspicuous elements of the MHV-S HE RBS are the RBS-hairpin and a conserved metal-binding site with a potassium ion that stabilizes the R3-loop and the RBS-hairpin exactly as in BCoV-Mebus HE (Figure 4B). The potassium ion is coordinated by main chain oxygen atoms of Ser231, Glu280 and Leu282 and side chain oxygen atoms of Asp230, Gln232 and Ser278. These residues are conserved in BCoV-Mebus HE and in all other coronavirus HEs with the exception of HCoV-HKU1 HE [23].",

Moreover, the hydrophobic patch in the BCoV-Mebus HE RBS that interacts with the Sia 5-N-acetyl group (Figure 5C) apparently changed into a shallow pocket that accommodates the Sia 4-O-acetyl moiety (Figure 5A). The residues orthologous to BCoV-Mebus HE Thr114, Leu161, Phe211, and Leu266 were replaced by Leu119, Ile166, Ser216, and Tyr281, respectively, and Leu260 was recruited from the R4-loop, which in MHV-S HE is reoriented as compared to the one in BCoV-Mebus HE (Figure 4A). These residues, together with conserved Phe212, form the hydrophobic lining of the newly shaped pocket (Figures 5A and B). As the Sia-4-O-acetyl group is crucial for ligand recognition by MHV-S HE, this pocket must be key to receptor-binding. In accordance, single Ala substitutions of Leu119, Ile166, Phe212, Leu260, or Tyr281 all reduced receptor-binding activity (although that of Ile166 to lesser extent) as shown by hemagglutination assay (Figure 5E) and solid-phase lectin binding assay (Figure 5F).",

The most striking observation is that this major shift in ligand specificity required only minimal changes in the protein and that the binding site architecture was essentially maintained. How this was possible can be explained from the mode of lectin-ligand interaction, based largely on the docking of the methyl groups of the Sia-acetyl moieties into hydrophobic pockets, and from the structures of the two types of ligands. The juxtaposition of the Sia 5-N- and 9-O-acetyl moieties is quasi-similar to that of the Sia 4-O- and 5-N-acetyl groups. The distance between the groups may be different (7.1 versus 5.7 \u00c5 as measured between the methyl carbon atoms, respectively), but for each combination the acetyl groups are located in roughly the same plane and at roughly similar angles (Figure S3). Thus, it can be envisaged that a pre-existing site for 9-O-Ac-Sia was converted to accommodate 4-O-Ac-Sia instead by (i) having the ligand rotate (with binding of the ligand in the novel orientation facilitated through hydrogen bonding with residues introduced by substitutions and/or insertions in the R3 loop) and (ii) by bringing the original 9-O-acetyl binding pocket and 5-N-acetyl binding patch more closely together so that they now can accept the 5-N- and 4-O-acetyl moieties, respectively (Figure S3). From attempts to fit \u03b1Neu5,9Ac22Me into the MHV-S RBS by in silico modelling, the the 9-O- and 5-N-acetyl groups would seem to be spaced too far apart to conveniently dock into the acetyl-binding pockets. Moreover, were the ligand to bind in this orientation, the Sia carboxylate would clash with the modified R3-loop. These findings thus provide an explanation for exclusion of the original ligand and for the specificity of MHV-S HE for 4-O-Ac-Sias (Figure S3 and Video S1).",

The C2-oxygen through which glycosidically-bound Sia would be linked to the penultimate residue of the glycan chain is exposed to the solvent and we would therefore expect the lectin to bind Sias in a linkage-independent fashion. Still, the R4- and/or E-loops, as they are proximal to Sia C2 (Figure 4A), might affect ligand binding such as to cause a preference for a particular linkage type. The pocket for the Sia 5-N-acetyl group would seem sufficiently wide to also accommodate the slightly larger 5-N-Gc substituent (Figure 5A); whether the lectin does accept 5-N-glycolylated Sias as ligands remains to be shown, however. Finally, from the topology and orientation of \u03b1Neu4,5Ac22Me in the RBS of MHV-S HE, ligand binding would seem to be tolerant to modifications at the Sia glycerol side chain (Figure 5A). Yet, as demonstrated by hemagglutination assay with native and sialate-9-O-acetylesterase-treated erythrocytes, MHV-S HE apparently prefers 4-mono-O- over 4,9-di-O-acetylated Sias [27].",

While the structure reported here provides clues to how an HE protein ancestral to that of MHV-S may have changed to bind to 4-O- rather than to 9-O-acetylated Sias, the conditions that selected for this shift in ligand specificity and the biological consequences thereof are unknown. The limited data available on the in vivo role of HE suggests that it promotes viral spread [31]. Entry of murine coronaviruses, however, is mediated not by HE, but by the S protein, a type I fusion protein that binds to the principal receptor CAECAM1a [32]\u2013[34]. We propose that HE may act during the very early stages of the infectious cycle as a molecular timer for temporary virion attachment. Through the concerted actions of its lectin and sialate-O-acetylesterase domains, HE would allow virus particles to bind with high avidity and yet reversibly to sialylated surfaces. The time allowed for virions to remain attached would be a function of HE binding affinity/avidity, esterase activity and local Sia density. Virions by binding to the ubiquitous and highly accessible Sias in the glycocalix would buy time for the S protein to find and bind the main receptor at the cell's surface as an obligatory prelude to penetration. Such a strategy would be advantageous particularly under conditions of low receptor density or poor receptor accessibility. If within the allotted time, HE-mediated virion attachment would not progress to this next stage of entry (for example, because the particle attached not to a susceptible cell, but to decoy receptors on a non-cell-associated glycoconjugate), the default would be for the virus to elute and \u201ctake its business elsewhere\u201d. In this model, , MHV HE would appreciably contribute to host cell selection, its ligand preference potentially affecting host-, organ- and cell tropism. Our findings pave the way to study the function of CoV HE and to assess the importance of ligand and substrate specificity through an approach of structure-guided mutagenesis, reverse genetics and animal experimentation in a natural infection model.",

The resulting construct, pCD5-MHV-S-HE-T-Fc, codes for a chimeric HE protein provided with an N-terminal CD5 signal peptide and, at its C-terminus, preceded by a thrombin cleavage site, the Fc domain of human IgG1 (HE-Fc). The QuikChange XL II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to construct pCD5-MHV-S-HE-T-Fc derivatives that code for an enzymatically inactive HE-Fc with the esterase catalytic residue Ser45 replaced by Ala (HE0-Fc), and for HE0-Fc mutants with Ala substitutions in the receptor-binding site. For analytical purposes, HE-Fc fusion proteins were produced by transient expression in HEK293T cells and then purified from the cell culture supernatants by protein A-affinity chromatography and low-pH elution (0.1M Citric-acid pH 3.0). The pH of the eluate was neutralized by adding Tris pH 8.0 to a final concentration of 0.2 M and the protein solution was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). For crystallography, HE-Fc fusion-proteins were transiently expressed in HEK293 GnTI(-) cells [36] and the MHV-S ectodomain was purified by protein A-affinity chromatography and on-the-beads thrombin cleavage as described [23], [24].",
