A formal and structured vocabulary is now being developed to address this imprecise biology terminology. This vocabulary or Gene Ontology (GO) is being developed by the Gene Ontology Consortium (GOC) [1] to standardize the descriptions of gene products. Ontologies define the basic terms and relations comprising the vocabulary of a topic area, as well as the rules for combining terms and relations to define extensions to the vocabulary [2]. Despite these efforts, the mechanism of representing these terms lacks a unifying architecture that can be applied to the annotation of a gene product. However, computer science has developed a well-defined process and methodology for the development of software models. Adapting this process and methodology can orchestrate the assembly of biological models with integrated gene ontologies. In doing so, a standardized terminology and object-oriented model is created that can facilitate communication between biologists and computer scientists.",

            "text": "The Gene Ontology project is a collaborative effort that addresses the need for a controlled vocabulary that provides a consistent description of gene products in different databases [1]. The GO collaborators are developing three structured, controlled vocabularies that describe gene products, which have been classified into molecular function, biological process, and cellular component domains. GO terms are organized in structures called directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), which differ from hierarchies in that a 'child' (more specialized term) can have many 'parents' (less specialized terms). As part of these graphs, each component is given a GOid (unique identifier), and is associated with a GO definition. Collectively, these agreed upon terms are being developed to help explain various aspects of biology. When applied to a gene, that gene is annotated with a concise description of its molecular function, cellular location and associated biological processes. However, the GOC never intended to represent gene products or correlate ontological terms with these gene products [1]. To address this need, a Gene Ontology Annotation database [3] has been created to associate the GO terms with their gene product counterparts. With sustained effort, the descriptions of these gene products will ultimately be established. Still, much of the current bioinformatics work regarding GO has focused on constructing databases [4-7], applying it to other research areas [8-22], and building tools to mine the GO database. (For a description of some of these tools see [23].)",

It has been noted that there remains a need for a unifying architecture that integrates all three GO domains as part of a gene product's annotation. Furthermore, to enhance the Gene Ontology and facilitate its use as a cross-disciplinary tool, several additional issues need to be addressed. First, relationships between the biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components are not readily apparent [25-28]. Second, GO terms lack details. For instance, when one looks at molecular function there is no indication of what is inputted or outputted. Finally, existing tools such as GO-DEV [29] only contain software used for tool development and information retrieval, not software modeled directly after the three domains of the Gene Ontology. However, these issues can be resolved by integrating the Gene Ontology into an object-oriented system.",

Consequently, the Gene Ontology can be applied and mapped to the fundamental concepts that form the object-oriented paradigm (i.e. class, object, inheritance, composition, polymorphism, and encapsulation) (Table 1). Furthermore, in an object-oriented sense, biological process terms are equivalent to high-level concepts. However, GO biological process terms do not contain descriptive information about the dynamics or static interactions defined by the terms. By translating a biological process into an object-oriented model the dynamic and static events occurring within a process can be represented. Building a static and dynamic model of a biological process requires defining the components of the process as well as the functions and attributes contained within these components. These components are biological entities (bioentities) that may include individual gene products, whose processes, functions and cellular components are captured in the Gene Ontology, or other higher-level entities such as gene product complexes.",

            "text": "The TGF-beta receptor pathway is involved in numerous cellular events including apoptosis, tumor development, differentiation, and development. These processes stem from the binding of TGF-beta to its cellular receptors. Briefly, dimerized TGF-beta 1 binds to TGF-beta receptor II (T\u03b2RII) and then TGF-beta receptor I (T\u03b2RI) complexes [33], causing their tetramerization (two type II receptors and two type I receptors) [34-36]. Constitutively activated type II receptor phosphorylates and activates type I receptor. Type I receptor propagates the signal by phosphorylating Smad 2, which is presented by the Smad Anchor for Receptor Activation (SARA) [37]. Phosphorylation of Smad destabilizes the Smad interaction with SARA, releasing it [38]. On TGF-beta stimulation, Smad 2 forms heterotrimeric complexes with Smad 4 and accumulates in the nucleus, binds DNA and remains for several hours [39-42]. Dephosphorylation allows Smad 2 to dissociate from Smad 4 and to be exported to the cytoplasm [43,44]. If the receptors are no longer active, then the Smads accumulate over time in the cytoplasm [44]. Alternatively, activated Smad 2 is ubiquitinated in the nucleus and undergoes proteasome-mediated degradation [45].",

Read from top to bottom, the GO terms proceed from more specific to less specific. Directed acyclic graphs also allow the properties of multiple parent nodes to be inherited by child nodes, a form of multiple inheritance in object-oriented modeling. In figure 1A, cellular components related to the TGF-beta receptor complex are shown. One can create a UML diagram to mimic these relationships as shown in figure 1B. Since not all cellular components involved in the TGF-beta receptor complex assembly process are present in the current Gene Ontology, additional gene products based on literature searches were added to the object-oriented diagram (Figure 1B, shaded boxes). Relationships are captured as an object-oriented system through containment, composition and inheritance. Cellular components were decomposed into objects and connected via generalizations, which illustrate inheritance. Because these terms inherit all the attributes of their parents, only GO terms at the terminal nodes need be characterized in an object-oriented model.

The creation of object functions involved the transition from gene product functions to standardized GO molecular functions, and then to standardized, fully parameterized object functions. By applying formal ontological terms from the molecular function domain to gene products, object functions can be created with a consistent vocabulary. In table 2 we show the relationships between the function of a gene product defined in our model, and the GO molecular function term most closely corresponding to that cellular function. Here, we first compared ontology terms from the molecular function domain to those ascribed to individual gene products. Due to the incompleteness of the Gene Ontology, some gene product functions were extrapolated from the current literature, and then comparable GO molecular function terms were assigned to the gene products. Next, these molecular function terms were converted to object functions through reverse engineering. We identified the parameters that would normally be input into and output from a cellular reaction. In this way we defined the input and output parameters necessary for an object function. The object function itself was given the GOid that corresponds with its closest matching molecular function as defined by the GOid's definition. Together, object functions were created that are fully parameterized with inputs and outputs and that contain a standardized GO notation.",

The events of the TGF-beta receptor complex assembly (GO:0007181) process include TGF-beta binding (GO:0050431) to its receptors and SMAD binding (GO:0046332) and activation (GO:0042301). To capture the dynamic nature of these actions as an object-oriented software system, sequence diagrams were created. The events leading to Smad 2 activation are reflected chronologically in a high-level sequence diagram in Figure 2. The creation of the sequence diagram first entails identifying gene products and their functions by literature searches. Simple or complex bioentities are modeled as objects, which are represented by rectangles with vertical lifelines. Ontology terms taken from the molecular function domain that best corresponded to these functions were incorporated as object functions, which represent the functions of these gene products. These functions are implemented by the methods contained within the objects. Furthermore, these methods allow an object to communicate and interact with other objects, thus capturing cellular activities. To capture interactions between objects, one object can call a method of another object by connecting object lifelines in the sequence diagram (Figure 2). This invocation of a function of one object by another is described as one object sending a message to another object. Alternatively, a message may be passed from an object to itself as in the case of self-checks or autoactivation signals. In this way, real world processes may be captured using an object-oriented approach. For instance, to capture the formation of the TGF-beta and TGF-beta RII complex a GOid that closely corresponds to this ability is chosen as the method name. In this way the method can be cross-referenced to a GO term. Specifically, the method 'GO:0046982 (in Dimerized_TGF-beta, in Dimerized_RII)' references via the GOid, GO:0046982, \"protein heterodimerization activity\", and shows that a homodimer of TGF-beta and a homodimer of TGF-beta RII are needed to form the complex. Here, each dimer is thought of as a single entity, so the combination of these two entities is best represented as heterodimerization. A value of TGF-beta-T\u03b2RII_Complex is returned upon completion of the method as indicated by the return arrow. In contrast, the function call \"GO:0042803 (in: SMAD2, in SMAD2),\" references a self-call. The GOid can be cross-referenced to \"protein homodimerization activity\", which requires two SMAD2 components to generate the SMAD2 homodimer, but the message is passed only within the SMAD2 object. Furthermore, a message need not accept any parameters, as in the \"translate()\" function, which only returns a Boolean value indicating whether the action has occurred. Additional events such as TGF-beta RI activation, and Smad homodimerization, binding and activation are also reflected in figure 2. Together, this diagram demonstrates that the sequence of events occurring in the biological process, TGF-beta receptor complex assembly (GO:0007181), can be represented using the Gene Ontology, and can be integrated as part of the dynamics of an object-oriented software system.",

To capture these alternative events as part of the dynamic architecture, an activity diagram was created to reflect the initial stages of TGF-beta signaling (Figure 3). Unlike the sequence diagram, which captures main scenario events, the action sequence or flow of the activity diagram can portray alternative outcomes. Taking the example above, if TGF-beta binds to the type III receptor then an alternative flow of events occurs for a time that then returns to the main flow of events. Other possible divergences that were modeled included whether to internalize the TGF-beta receptors via clathrin-dependent or lipid raft-dependent mechanisms. These pathways lead to either complex degradation or signal promotion. Because complex degradation is not specified in our use case, for simplicity, this event is routed to the final state. However, the main success scenario, signal promotion, continues until SMAD2 is released and TGF-beta complex assembly is finished.

In addition, binary associations containing cardinalities may indicate the number of objects interacting with another. For instance, TGF-beta can interact with one to many receptors, while a receptor can only interact with one TGF-beta at a time (Fig. 4). Cellular compartments where these gene products can be found are also shown.

These objects utilize inheritance to acquire the attributes and properties of more general objects. Complex classes can also be disassembled into subclasses using composition. Encapsulation allows the simplification of the model without sacrificing functionality. For instance, we do not need to know specific details regarding how a gene product is translated, just that a process that is encapsulated by the function 'translate()' can create a protein. However, if we wished to delve deeper into the mechanics of the translation process the layered architecture of the object-oriented system would allow us to do so. It is also worth noting that the modular nature of the object-oriented system closely resembles the recently discovered modular structure of biological networks [46-48]. This resemblance further indicates that biological systems can be easily modeled as object-oriented systems.

For example, protein A may heterodimerize with protein B, whereas protein C heterodimerizes with protein D. From the Gene Ontology it is not readily apparent as to what is being inputted into the dimerization function.

This format is an improvement to the unparameterized GO term in that the function can be cross-referenced to protein heterodimerization activity via its GO term, and we also see that for protein A to heterodimerize we need both protein A and protein B. In addition, we now observe that a new entity called protein AB is created from this function.
