Similar to Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), MERS-CoV emerged as a result of zoonotic introduction to the human population2, 3. Considering the ongoing MERS-CoV outbreak, it is crucial to develop intervention measures, including vaccines4. Currently, no licensed therapeutic treatment or vaccine is available, which highlights the urgent need for the development of an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV infection4, 5.",

The viral structural proteins, S and N, show the highest immunogenicity6\u201311. The S protein mediates coronavirus entry into host cells by first binding to a receptor on the host-cell surface via its receptor-binding domain (RBD)12. Although both the S and N proteins can induce T-cell responses, neutralizing antibodies are almost solely directed against the S protein, which is the major immunodominant factor. Thus, current MERS-CoV vaccine candidates primarily use the S protein or (parts of) the gene coding for this glycoprotein4, 5. Vaccines against MERS-CoV infection have been developed using purified coronavirus S protein, as well as DNA or viral vector-based vaccines expressing the full-length MERS-CoV S protein or part of the S protein13\u201318. These vaccines have been tested for their ability to induce virus-neutralizing antibodies in mice or large animals, such as monkeys or camels7, 17. Several MERS vaccines have been developed among vaccine platforms but have been shown to confer variable degrees of immunogenicity, which necessitates the adjustment of the dose, adjuvant, and site of administration to induce optimal protective responses4, 5, 19. Furthermore, ongoing efforts to develop MERS-CoV vaccines should consider their immunity profiles against different antigens and correlates of protection.",

However, preclinical evaluations of a subunit or inactivated whole-virus vaccine and Th1-type adjuvant for SARS-CoV have shown induction of serum neutralizing antibodies and protection against infection in mice challenged with an infectious virus21.

As is known, S protein or IV vaccines with alum adjuvant induce a Th2-biased response. Our data demonstrated the advantages of the combination of the two adjuvants, namely, CpG and alum, for the induction of robust antibody responses, as the S protein-specific IgG titers reached 105 and a >60% neutralizing activity, which were achieved in sera at a 1:1000 dilution in both vaccine groups after the second immunization. In addition, vaccines formulated with CpG/alum combinations generated a balanced ([IgG2a+IgG2b]\u00f7IgG1=1) or Th1-biased ([IgG2a+IgG2b]\u00f7IgG1>1) response against the S protein in mice vaccinated with the S protein or IV, respectively. A Th1/Th2 balanced or Th1-biased immune response is generally associated with more effective control of viral infections. In Fig. 2a, mice immunized with IV produced more anti-S antibodies than those immunized with a recombinant spike protein in the 2-week post immunization group. We believe that this difference might be caused by the particle-like conformation of the S protein preserved in the immunogen of IV compared to the recombinant S protein as a soluble subunit.",

            "text": "The S and N proteins of CoVs are characterized by high humoral and cellular immunogenicity34\u201337. The M and E proteins are structural proteins that are anchored in the envelope of MERS-CoV particles2. The E protein is a small integral membrane polypeptide that forms an ion channel38, 39. The M protein is a typical transmembrane glycoprotein and the most abundant structural protein in CoV virions40. Buchholz et al.37 reported that the M and E proteins expressed in BHPIV3 vectors did not induce detectable resistance to a SARS-CoV challenge in hamsters. However, other reports suggest that M plays a significant role in the virus-specific humoral response and induces production of neutralizing antibodies in SARS patients36. In addition, the N, M, and E proteins may be antigens for antiviral cytotoxic T cells, which induce short-term resistance against a virus challenge in the absence of monoclonal antibodies in mice, as has been shown to be the case with several coronaviruses40, 41. In our study, the S protein and IV vaccines induced almost identical S protein antigen-specific IgG antibody responses and neutralizing activity after the last immunization. However, the antigen-specific humoral immune response against structural proteins (N, M, and E) other than the S protein was only detected in mice with IV. In addition, the level of S protein or N protein expression in the lungs of mice receiving IV was slightly lower than that in mice that received the S protein vaccine. Furthermore, a more mild pathology and lower virus titers were detected in the lungs of mice that received IV (Fig. 5), indicating that the IV formulation induced a greater protective effect in mice than the S protein formulation. Therefore, our findings indicate that this enhanced protective effect might be derived from antibodies against the N, M, and E structural proteins contained in IV.",

Briefly, heat-inactivated serum from immunized mice was serially diluted. After co-incubation with the same volume of MERS-CoV (hCoV-EMC), the mixtures were transferred to 12-well plates with confluent Vero cells for 1 h. Virus incubation with DMEM was used as the control. The cells were cultured at 37 \u00b0C for an additional 72 h and fixed with paraformaldehyde for 20 min. The plaques were counted after dying with gentian violet. Plaque reduction was calculated as follows: inhibition percentage = 100 \u00d7 [1\u2212(plaque number incubated with sera \u00f7 plaque number without sera)].",
