Patients with PDAC typically show insidious early symptoms and the pancreas is anatomically covered by gastrointestinal and other organs, making it difficult to detect early lesions by conventional imaging techniques. When patients are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, 25% of cases are locally advanced and 60% are unresectable or metastatic, with most patients experiencing significant pain [3]. Although numerous studies have evaluated the detection and management of PDAC, the five-year relative survival rate remains at only 5%. Therefore, further investigation of the molecular basis of PDAC pathogenesis is urgently required.",

Activation of FOXO1 results in upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27KIP1 and down-regulation of D-type cyclins, thereby arresting cells at G1 [8]. Activated FOXO1 also triggers apoptosis in many cancer cell lines by regulating various proapoptotic proteins, including Fas ligand, TRAIL, and Bim [9]. Our previous studies demonstrated that FOXO1 is significantly down-regulated in PDAC tissues, which is correlated with cancer cell stemness in PDAC [10, 11]. However, no long non-coding (lncRNA) directly regulated by FOXO1 in PDAC has been reported.",

Many factors have been identified to interact with the \u03b2-catenin-TCF4/LEF-1 complex, which then recruits the transcription factors Brg1 and CREB-binding protein to initiate Wnt-targeted gene expression, such as lncRNA CRNDE, Nemo-like kinase, and APC [25\u201327].

We overexpressed FOXO1 in PANC1 cells (Fig. 1a) and then performed lncRNA microarray screening (Fig. 1b). FOXO1 overexpression increased the levels of 312 lncRNAs; only one lncRNA, LINC01197, was elevated by over 7-fold, suggesting its relationship with FOXO1 in PDAC. We next analyzed the expression of LINC01197 and FOXO1 in PDAC from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and found that LINC01197 is down-regulated in PDAC tissues, as observed for FOXO1. Furthermore, the expression of LINC01197 was positively correlated with FOXO1 in the same patient cohort (Fig. 1c). We also validated the expression of LINC01197 in 18 fresh PDAC tissues and adjacent normal tissues and found that LINC01197 was significantly down-regulated in PDAC tissues and positively correlated with FOXO1 (Fig. 1d). These results supported that LINC01197 is regulated by FOXO1. We next analyzed the prognosis of LINC01197 in TCGA PDAC patient cohort. We found that low expression of LINC01197 predicts poor disease-free prognosis (Fig. 1e) and overall survival prognosis (Fig. 1f), demonstrating the clinical significance of LNC01197. These results suggest that LINC01197 is down-regulated in PDAC and associated with low FOXO1 expression and poor prognosis for PDAC, indicating its potential as a tumor suppressor in PDAC.",

We then overexpressed FOXO1 in AsPC1, BxPC3, and PANC1 cells and knocked down FOXO1 in HPNE cells. Overexpression of FOXO1 remarkably elevated the expression of LINC01197 in these cells. Silencing of FOXO1 in HPNE cells significantly inhibited the expression of LINC01197 (Fig. 2b). These results support that LINC01197 is a direct target of FOXO1 in PDAC cells. We then analyzed the promoter sequence of LINC01197 and identified two FOXO1 binding sites for Daf-16 binding element(DBE) in the LINC01197 promoter region. A dual-luciferase reporter showed that FOXO1 increases the luciferase activity of the LINC01197 promoter (Fig. 2c), demonstrating that LINC01197 is a direct target of FOXO1. LINC01197 is at chr15:95822519\u201395,870,329 and has a full-length of 1445 base pairs. Northern blot assays validated the presence and expression of LINC01197 in HPNE and PANC1 cells (Fig. 2d), confirming that LINC01197 expression is down-regulated in PANC1 cells. The subcellular distribution of lncRNA suggests its biological functions [28]. We found that in HPNE cells, LINC01197 was mainly localized in the nucleus (Fig. 2e). Taken together, these results demonstrate that LINC01197 is a direct target of FOXO1 and is mainly localized in the nucleus.",

As shown in Fig. 4b, \u03b2-catenin was significantly pulled down by LINC01197, but not by the anti-sense LINC01197-AS (Fig. 4b). \u03b2-Catenin RIP assays in PANC1 and BxPC3 cells showed that LINC01197 was significantly enriched when \u03b2-catenin was present (Fig. 4c). These results validated that LINC01197 binds to \u03b2-catenin. Considering that \u03b2-catenin plays an important role in Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling as a PDAC carcinogenic factor, we evaluated how LINC01197 affects Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling in PDAC cells. Dual-luciferase reporter assays showed that overexpression of LINC01197 robustly inhibited the luciferase activity of TOP flash in both PANC1 and BxPC3 cells (Fig. 4d). These results suggest that LINC01197 inhibits Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling. Evaluation of the expression of canonical Wnt target genes in PANC1 and BxPC3 cells showed that MYC, CCND1, CD44, and MMP26 expression was significantly inhibited in LINC01197-overexpressing cell lines (Fig. 4d).

We first detected the level of \u03b2-catenin in the nucleus and cytoplasm in PANC1 and BxPC3 cells, as shown in Fig. 5a; however, ectopic expression of LINC01197 did not affect the expression and nucleus translocation of \u03b2-catenin in these two cell lines. Given that \u03b2-catenin should first bind to TCFs including TCF1, TCF4 and TCF7 [30\u201332] and then trigger Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling, we predicted that LINC01197 affects the binding of these TCFs with \u03b2-catenin in PDAC cells. Interestingly, as illustrated in Fig. 5b, we verified that overexpression of LINC01197 inhibits the binding of \u03b2-catenin and TCF4 both in PANC1 and BxPC3 cells. Additionally, silencing of LINC01197 in HPNE cells increased the binding of TCF4 to \u03b2-catenin (Fig. 5c). These results suggest that LINC01197 segregates \u03b2-catenin and TCF4 in both PDAC and normal pancreatic ductal cells. Silencing of \u03b2-catenin rescued the increased cell colony formation ability in LINC01197 knockdown HPNE cells (Fig. 5d). These results indicate that LINC01197 disrupts the interaction between \u03b2-catenin and TCF4 binding and then inhibits Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling in PDAC cells (Fig. 6).",

            "text": "In the current study, we identified the lncRNA LINC01197 as a tumor suppressor and found that the FOXO1/LINC01197/\u03b2-catenin axis has tumor suppressor functions in PDAC. FOXO1 is a transcription factor that mainly regulates metabolic homeostasis in response to oxidative stress. In tumor biology, FOXO1 is typically down-regulated or depleted in malignant tissues in cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, renal clear cell carcinoma, and gastric cancer. Our previous study showed that FOXO1-negative cells carry cancer stem-like characteristics in PDAC [10]. In this study, we screened for FOXO1-regulated lncRNAs in PANC1 cells and found that LINC01197 was significantly down-regulated in PDAC tissues. The levels of this lncRNA were positively correlated with FOXO1, and low LINC01197 expression predicted poor prognosis for patients with PDAC. We also demonstrated that LINC01197 is directly targeted by FOXO1 in luciferase reporter assays. Dysregulation of FOXO1 disrupts metabolic homeostasis and ultimately alters cell proliferation and growth; LINC01197 shows the same effects in PDAC cells. We then characterized the biological functions of LINC01197 in PDAC cells by knocking down LINC01197 in normal pancreatic ductal HPNE cells, which increased proliferation and growth. In contrast, overexpression of LINC01197 robustly inhibited PDAC cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. These function demonstrate that LINC01197 is a tumor suppressor in PDAC. Localization of lncRNAs may suggest how lncRNAs exert their functions [28]. LncRNAs localized in the cytoplasm mainly function as a sponge to sequester miRNAs and their target genes [37], while lncRNAs localized in the nucleus may be involved in epigenetic regulation or guide RNA of transcription factors [38]. In this study, we found that LINC01197 is mainly localized in the nucleus but not in the cytoplasm. RNA-pulldown assays showed that \u03b2-catenin binds to LINC01197, which was confirmed by RIP assays in both PANC1 and BxPC3 cells. \u03b2-Catenin plays a pivotal role in the transduction of Wnt signaling, and dysregulation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling occurs in many types of malignant cancers, including PDAC. We further found that LINC01197 binds to \u03b2-catenin and inhibits Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling in PDAC cells without affecting the expression and translocation of \u03b2-catenin. Upon receiving the Wnt canonical ligand, \u03b2-catenin accumulates and is trans-localized to the nucleus where it binds to TCFs and triggers the expression of downstream target genes [20]. Numerous lncRNAs such as lncTCF7 and SNHG1 have been reported to regulate Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling [39, 40], while none of these lncRNAs bind to \u03b2-catenin. Our data showed that LINC01197 sequesters \u03b2-catenin binding to TCF4 in PDAC cells and then inhibits Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling. LINC01197 is the first lncRNA found to be involved in the \u03b2-catenin/TCF4 complex and negatively regulate the Wnt canonical signaling pathway. How LINC01197 binds to \u03b2-catenin and the clinical importance of these results should be further analyzed.",
