            "text": "Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus (IBRV), often referred to as bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1), is responsible for infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR). IBR is highly contagious, and can cause a diverse range of clinical manifestations from upper respiratory disease, rhinitis, vulvovaginitis, traeheitis, enteritis, conjunctivitis, abortion and encephalitis, to fatal systemic infection in neonatal calves [1]. IBRV can also induce immune suppression that contributes to the severity of disease manifestation. In addition, IBRV is one of the bovine respiratory disease complex pathogens, which is the leading cause of cattle death around the world [2\u20134]. Taken together, it is a major disease of cattle leading to significant economic losses to the dairy industry worldwide [5, 6]. Several developed countries such as Germany, have adopted immunization and eradication of pathogen-positive animals for IBR control [7]. Therefore, early identification of IBRV positive animals is critical for disease control and elimination programs to diminish its burden on the dairy industry.",

However, currently available diagnostic tests remain laboratory-based and require sophisticated instruments operated by specially trained personnel. Although isothermal amplification techniques such as the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) have been offered as a simple, rapid and alternative molecular pathogen diagnostic tool for point-of-care testing in the field [11, 12], the LAMP assay needs four to six primers, leading to longer amplicons and possibly more difficult to design in the case of highly variable viruses.",

RPA products can be detected by gel electrophoresis, probe-based fluorescence monitoring or lateral flow dipsticks depending on the specific primers and/or probe configuration.

Real-time PCR was performed on a LightCycler480 Real-time PCR System using SYBR\u00ae Premix Ex Taq\u2122 II (TliRNaseH Plus) reagents (Takara BioInc, Japan) according to the Manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The reaction was carried out in a 20 \u03bcL volume containing 10 \u03bcL 2 \u00d7 SYBR Premix Ex Taq II, 0.5 \u03bcL of forward and reverse primers (20 \u03bcM), respectively, 2 \u03bcL of DNA and 7 \u03bcL DNase-free water. The real-time PCR was performed as follows: 1 cycle of 95 \u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 30 s and 63 \u00b0C for 30 s. Fluorescent signal was collected during the elongation step. In diagnostic real-time PCR assay, it was customary to regard results between CT 35 and 40 as equivocal and above CT 40 as negative.",

Eight forward primers and eight reverse primers labeled at the 5\u2032 end with biotin for the detection of IBRV were designed to screen candidate primer pairs and probe (Table 1). Then nine LF probe combinations with primers were employed for further validation in this study. The candidate primers/probe for the LFD-RPA assay were screened by performing with TwistAmp\u2122 nfo reactions and preliminarily analyzed on 2% agarose gel with labeled amplicons. The initial agarose gel result showed that Primer set 4-2F/4-2R/4-2LF yielded specific amplification efficiency for the RPA assay, and produced the expected size of the product was 250 base-pairs (Fig. 1a), while the primers/probe targeting glycoprotein gB of the IBRV genome in this study could not be used to amplify effectively in the initial screen (data not show). In order to determine the best pairs of primers/probe for maximum effective amplification, a series of staggered primers with 1\u20135 base intervals upstream and downstream of the original 4-2F/4-2R/4-2LF sequences were designed to obtain optimal primers for IBRV RPA, LFD-RPA results indicated that Primer set 4F/4R/4LF presented the most efficient amplification with expected size of 247 bp (Table 2), showing a test line within 5 min on the LFD (Fig. 1b).\n\n",

Recent studies have shown that isothermal amplification techniques such as RPA and LAMP could be developed to amplify nucleic acids, which require neither high precision instrument for amplification nor elaborate methods for detection of the amplified products [21]. Among those isothermal amplification assays, RPA is a powerful, innovative nucleic acid test, which could be useful for low resource settings [22, 23]. RPA outperforms over LAMP currently developed for IBRV diagnosis. One advantage is that RPA reaction only utilizes two primers and one probe and three binding sites, in contrast, the LAMP assay needs at least four primers and six binding sites. In addition, RPA reagents provided in a lyophilized pellet are stable even when stored for 3 weeks at 45 \u00b0C, which allow independence from the cooling chain [24, 25].",

In this study, different conserved genomic regions were selected for olignucleotide design (Table 1). Several primer and probe combinations were initially evaluated for target sequences and two products generated by RPA primer pair and probe were distinct in size on an agarose gel to exclude non-specific amplification (Fig. 1a). It is worth mentioning that, unlike PCR-based DNA amplification assays, it should be noted that the primer and probe set of RPA is much more stringent as it requires longer primers (30\u201335 bases) and probes (46\u201352 bases) leading to the potential of formation of secondary structures. Moreover, after several optimization screening, one optimal set of the primers and probe limited to the UL52 regions functioning DNA replication can be successfully used to amplify an exact sequence-matched template (Fig. 1b) since replacement, increase, decrease or mismatch of single base will have a significant impact on the result of amplification [26]. Furthermore, we also found that IBRV molecular detection with RPA assay poses unique challenges because the genome of IBRV was rich in GC content. In retrospect, given recently published data describing glycoprotein-based IBRV detection assay, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) or PCR-based assays have been reported to detect IBRV in biological samples [27, 28]. In the present study, none of the primers targeting glycoprotein gB within the same region of the genome of LAMP and PCR could be used to amplify effectively in the initial screen (Table 1), this may be due to the long probe formed folded secondary structures and had an impact upon hybridization to target, or perhaps there are different regions for primer design between RPA and LAMP/PCR.",

The study of specificity showed that no cross-detection between IBRV and other bovine infectious virus or bovine herpesvirus 5 (Fig. 3a and b).

The clinical performance of PCR, LFD-RPA and SYBR Green I based PCR assays were detected using 106 suspected clinical specimens, the clinical sensitivity of both LFD-RPA and SYBR Green I real-time assays was 100%, while PCR showing the lower detection might be due to some clinical samples containing low viral titers. Although LFD-RPA is not appropriate for the quantitative analysis of nucleic acid, an important feature of the method is the LFD-RPA assay under normal circumstances outperforms other isothermal amplification assays in terms of simplicity and sensitivity, because it only requires a simple heat block to run and the results can also be visualized by LFD with naked eyes inspection.",

It has also been shown that RPA tolerates multiple known PCR inhibitors, including hemoglobin (50 gL\u22121), heparin (0.5 U), undiluted serum, and ethanol (4%v/v) [17]. However, some components of nucleic acids extracted from clinical sample have an influence on RPA reaction such as the concentrations of background DNA in whole blood [30]. To fulfill the full potential of developed IBRV LFD-RPA at the point of care in field conditions, we evaluated several simple methods for clinical sample extraction including direct sample lysis with heat lysis, alkaline lysis (0.2 M KOH or 0.5% SDS) and Dynabeads\u00ae magnetic separation. We found that Dynabeads\u00ae magnetic separation worked well. Similar sensitivities were obtained from viral genome extraction kit. Heat and alkaline lysis did not result insufficient recovery of positive DNA (data not shown).

In addition, the rapid LFD-RPA for IBRV may save much time in epidemiological surveillance and aid in identification of latent IBRV infected individuals in beef and dairy farms. Furthermore, it may be serves as a model platform for detecting other bovine pathogens.",
