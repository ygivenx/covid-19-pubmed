Many specialized databases, such as pathogen-related databases (Winnenburg, 2006; Aurrecoechea et al., 2017; Wattam et al., 2017), provide curated data that serve specific research domains. In the 2018 Nucleic Acids Research (NAR) database issue, an online molecular biology database collection, 1,737 databases were reported as being publicly available. This article will review cybersecurity aspects of online genome databases with a focus on pathogen-related databases. Among the databases collected by NAR, 30 are dedicated to viral genomes, 71 to prokaryotic genomes, and 35 to fungal genomes. These databases are of great interest to pathogen research. Many general-purpose databases also contain data related to pathogen genomes, genes, and protein annotations (Mukherjee et al., 2017). Some online databases not only provide repositories of research data but also provide computational tools that allow users to perform genomic data analysis online (Wattam et al., 2017). As metagenome and transcriptome sequencing become common practice in pathogen research, online databases are important tools for annotating and interpreting these genome-scale experiments.",

For example, private health record systems at hospitals have been targets for ransomware attacks in recent years (Osborne, 2018). However, cybersecurity awareness is still lacking in the research and health care industries (Kruse et al., 2017). Despite the importance of online genome databases to biological and pathogenic research, there is limited discussion, and virtually no research that focuses on biosecurity and cybersecurity risks (\u201ccyberbiosecurity\u201d) with regard to online biological databases. We suspect that one reason is that genome databases are most utilized by the research community. The number of people that can be directly affected by cyberattacks on genome databases is currently relatively small as compared to web sites or databases for large enterprises that have millions of users. Because of this perceived limited utilization of genomic data, there is limited incentive to target genome databases. However, given the millions of research dollars that are invested in generating genomic data yearly, it is surprising to see that there is almost no research that has been published related to protecting such data from cyberattacks.",

The size of public genomic data may someday surpass the size of all published text books combined. Besides the importance of protecting the products of public research investment, cyberbiosecurity research on genome databases is even more important because these databases contain so much of the knowledge gained over many years by the world-wide research community and because of the impact of this knowledge on human, animal, and plant health. Public genome databases also provide a unique resource for cyberbiosecurity research that aims to protect the bioeconomy (Murch et al., 2018; Peccoud et al., 2018), which has been estimated to consist in the USA of as much as 25% of GDP. The cyberinfrastructure and cybersecurity measures for the major biocompanies in health care, biopharma, and in the ag domains are largely unknown to the research community and thus cannot be easily analyzed. Unlike biocompanies, public genome databases have the intention to broaden their impacts by granting and facilitating open access to all users. Additionally, major innovations in computational methods for genomic data analysis are also largely driven by public research and open source software. Many companies, academic institutions, and government entities are likely also using open source software and databases developed in the public research community because the latest innovations in genomics are typically coming from academic research. Therefore, public genome databases provide a front-end of a highly innovative research community and are an ideal data resource for analyzing potential risks for cyberbiosecurity.",

            "text": "In the coming decades, we expect that genomic data will become more widely accessed and contextualized, and thus becoming increasingly relevant to public health and safety. For example, metagenomic sequencing can now be used to trace foodborne pathogen outbreaks (Huang et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2018), which potentially affect tens of thousands of consumers. Metagenomic sequencing is also used in detecting bacterial pathogens (Pendleton et al., 2017; Lazarevic et al., 2018), fungal pathogens (Tong et al., 2017), and viruses (Greninger et al., 2017; Lewandowska et al., 2017) in hospitals. Metagenomic sequencing is used in plant disease detection as well, such as detecting pathogens in wheat (Yiheng Hu, 2019) and other crops (Chalupowicz et al., 2019). For all these applications, reliable and accurate genome databases are essential for correct identification of disease-causing pathogens. A recent study has also shown that metagenomic sequencing can even reveal personal identity (Franzosa et al., 2015). Therefore, similar to the security and privacy concerns for personal genomic information (McGuire et al., 2008), personal metagenomic data is another area where cybersecurity is important in protecting sensitive, private, and health-related genomic data (Zmora et al., 2016). In this work, we present an overview of online pathogen genome databases (section 2), identify a number of potential cybersecurity weaknesses in today's genome databases to raise awareness (section 3), and provide potential solutions to strengthen cybersecurity during the development of the next generation of genome databases (section 4). We focus on pathogen-related databases because of the direct health and agricultural implications of genomic studies of pathogens.",

For each assembly, a summary page provides metadata and connections to other NCBI resources, such as its taxonomy browser (Federhen, 2012), original data in BioSample and BioProject (Barrett et al., 2012), and whole genome sequencing databases. Each assembly also includes detailed information regarding the identity of the data contributor. Both BioSample and BioProject are metadata repositories that save submitter-supplied metadata related to the nucleotide sequences and other data deposited at NCBI. More specifically, each BioSample typically includes descriptions of specific biomaterials, such as the name of a particular strain of bacteria. BioProjects are descriptions of larger projects, which consist of many BioSamples. Sequence data in NCBI are also organized under gene, EST, genome, nucleotide, and protein databases. RefSeq (O'Leary et al., 2016) is a database of annotated genes and genomes including many pathogens. Unlike other databases mentioned above, RefSeq provides genome annotations, so it is more useful for finding functional information for different pathogens. SRA (Leinonen et al., 2011b) is another NCBI database that hosts data from short read and long read sequencing projects. Data stored in the SRA database require extensive computational processing and analysis to convert them to useful whole genome sequences or transcriptome sequences that are more biologically meaningful. GEO data sets and GEO profiles (Clough and Barrett, 2016) are databases for gene expression and genome scale data related to gene regulations. These data were generated for various organisms using different technologies including RNA-seq, microarray, ChIP-seq, and other genomic experiments. GEO databases typically include both metadata and raw data from gene expression analysis. In summary, NCBI hosts dozens of databases that can be roughly characterized as the following: (1) sequence repositories, which include databases such as assembly, genome, gene, EST, nucleotide, and protein; (2) the RefSeq database that provides annotated sequences; (3) BioSample and BioProject databases that provide metadata for data sets deposited in the NCBI databases; (4) SRA that provides a repository of raw sequences requiring further processing to generate actual biologically meaningful data sets; and (5) the GEO database that provides genomic data sets related to regulation of gene expression.",

            "text": "Querying the NCBI databases is the most common usage in genomic pathogen studies. To search data from the NCBI database, a unified web interface is provided that allows querying all databases by any anonymous user. NCBI also allows a user to compose and use URLs to directly retrieve data from some databases. Many data sets in NCBI can also be downloaded anonymously using its FTP server. Programmable access is allowed through software developed by NCBI, including Entrez Programming Utilities (E-utilities) and the SRA-toolkit. E-utilities is a set of software tools that allows users to query the NCBI databases from a command line interface. A user is recommended to perform no more than 3 queries per second, otherwise the IP address of the user will be blocked. If the user's IP is blocked, the user must register through NCBI by providing additional information such as their email address and the tool name that the user is to develop. The reason for requiring a tool name is that some users (bioinformaticians) are interested in developing batch query tools for NCBI data. Starting in December 2018, an API (Application Programming Interface) key is required to perform more than 3 queries per second using E-utilities. An API key can be obtained by registered users of NCBI and is associated with a unique user account. Besides E-utilities, NCBI provides BLAST, which allows the user to query its sequence databases using nucleotide or protein sequences as inputs. SRA-toolkit is a utility software designed for downloading data from the NCBI-SRA database. This is because the data sets deposited in the SRA database are typically much larger than most other types of data sets in NCBI databases. No registration is required to use SRA-toolkit to download data, and there are no clear instructions on whether IP addresses will be blocked for using SRA toolkit if a certain bandwidth is exceeded. Queries sent to a database present a minimal risk to the stored data; however, vulnerabilities in the host system or database interpreter are subject to exploitation when vulnerabilities are discovered in the query interpreter. Typically, systems are targeted for attack in order to escalate operating privileges on the host itself, so that its resources can be redirected for the attackers purpose to become a platform for attacks on other systems, or to monetize computing resources by generating digital coinage.",

Similar to GeneBank (Benson et al., 2018) at NCBI, the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) (Leinonen et al., 2011a) is a repository of sequence information, including those of pathogens. Some data types are the same between ENA and NCBI, such as assembly and EST data sets. However, these data sets have different sequence identifiers in EMBL compared to NCBI databases. Some data types are similar between ENA and NCBI. For example, ENA uses Sample and Study in place of BioSample and BioProject in NCBI. Some data types are unique to ENA, such as CDS data sets that are found in ENA only. Another major genome database from EMBL is the EnsemblGenomes database (Hubbard et al., 2002). There are multiple databases such as Ensembl Bacteria and Ensembl Fungi that are most relevant to pathogen research. Ensembl Bacteria includes genomes of 44,048 bacterial species, and Ensembl Fungi includes genomes of 811 fungal species. Both databases provide gene and genome annotations. Transcriptome data are available from multiple databases in EBI. ArrayExpress (Kolesnikov et al., 2015) is a database that contains gene expression data and results from other functional genomic assays. Although the name ArrayExpress suggests that the database contains data generated by microarray analysis, the database actually contains RNA-seq, DNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and methylation data, which makes this database very similar to the GEO database in NCBI. Expression Atlas (Papatheodorou et al., 2018) is a curated database for gene expression data only. In regard to raw data of sequencing experiments, SRA also has its counterpart in EMBL, which is also called SRA but is part of the ENA database.",

Ensembl genome databases also allow users to directly access the MySQL database server with a MySQL client, or by using a PERL API to access a MySQL database. Finally, Biomart (Smedley et al., 2009) is another interface for data access to EMBL databases. A user can use a web interface to interact with Biomart to retrieve data from EMBL databases.

Because of the awareness of the importance of metadata, including meta-data has become a standard for current genome databases. We also found that only four major databases contain raw data repositories and some raw data can only be found in a single raw data repository. This is because maintaining large amounts of raw sequence data is cost-prohibitive for smaller institutions.

Although security issues with these tools have not been reported, even if such security risk were to exist, it is relatively easy to control by dedicated measures. For example, funding could be provided to qualified individuals or entities to routinely check the security risk of these few, widely used computational tools. However, what concerns us more is that there is a growing number of a new generation of databases, which provide the users with the capacity to build customized analytical pipelines, composed of distributed compute and storage resources across multiple physical and virtual systems of unknown integrity. Unlike BLAST, some computational tools used in these customized pipelines may not be widely scrutinized. As the genomic data analytics community continuous to grow, more highly specialized new tools are likely to emerge. Data processing pipelines composed of many newly developed computational tools are more susceptible to contain intentional or unintentional vulnerable code or shared libraries and may be much more difficult to maintain and may become more difficult to mitigate security risks.",

Most public genome databases do not contain sensitive personal information such as credit card numbers or social security numbers, yet they do contain individual's genomic data, perhaps the most \u201cpersonal\u201d data of all. Two reasons that genome databases have not been targeted by cyberattacks is that (1) the population of users of genome databases are mainly research scientists, and accounts for a small percentage of the entire population; and (2) the technology needed to exploit the data has been sophisticated and expensive. However, growth in the field has led to both of the factors eroding in impact. As knowledge and training spreads, and with technological advances, the equipment becomes less expensive and easier to use. Additionally, indiscriminate attacks can always happen and can cause damage to genome databases. A common vulnerability found in this review is that while many databases do require user email and password to establish access control, users repeat their email and password combinations. Thus, credentials compromised in one system could be of interest to attackers to gain access to other accounts of the same user elsewhere. Among the databases we have reviewed, almost no database requires strong passwords, i.e., mandating a sufficiently long password of sufficient complexity (that includes capital letters, numbers, and symbols) to make brute force account password attacks impractical.",

This is typically referred to as an insider threat and requires a vigilant user review and monitoring process to identify potential candidates. In the second case, the attacker uses a classical external attack, for example exploiting an existing user's credentials, or sending emails to known system users with malware embedded (also known as \u201cphishing\u201d) to gain access to system accounts and then proceed with a correlation attack.",

Such ill-intended use of genomic data and technology is a major biosecurity concern. Currently, many genomes of animal and plant pathogens are freely accessible to any user through pathogen genome databases. A study in early 2000s had concluded that open access to pathogen genomes should be promoted (Committee on Genomics Databases for Bioterrorism Threat Agents et al., 2004). However, situations have changed due to the reduced cost of synthetic DNA technology and advancement in synthetic biology (Hughes and Ellington, 2017). Even the genome sequence of such a high-risk pathogen as the smallpox virus, Variola major, can be easily accessed at NCBI by any anonymous user. Putting in place more stringent regulations regarding access to sensitive data by governments is one potential solution for this problem. However, it is challenging to determine what should be regulated and what should not be regulated, particularly in a collaborative research setting. Imposing such regulations may also discourage research groups to conduct research related to these pathogens and increase the operating costs for those groups. In our opinion, one possible model is that, instead of granting free access to pathogen genomes to anyone who has an internet connection, funding agencies could control the access to genomic information for high-risk pathogens. Genomic data for these pathogens would only be available once the corresponding grant application has been peer-reviewed and determined as fund-able.",

One possibility of attack is to provide invalid data, motivated to guide future studies toward specific outcomes. This attack requires careful crafting of records in the database to maintain a valid format but containing data without experimental evidence. This attack can be done during a single data transfer. The mitigation is to use thorough analysis of the data at transfer time. The analysis can easily ensure correct formatting of the data, discarding garbled input. However, verifying the validity of the data is particularly challenging and cannot be easily performed using existing methods. Another type of attack consists in gradually injecting invalid records within a larger valid data set. For example, the attacker could download existing data from the database, extract a subset of the data, and inject invalid input. In this case, detection mechanisms that use probabilistic analysis can fail to find the invalid records. Only records with clear violation of data integrity can be detected. Such attacks have been proposed previously in various contexts, for example (Mo et al., 2010; C\u00e1rdenas et al., 2011; Esmalifalak et al., 2013).",

For example, if a diagnostic lab is using DNA sequences as a method to identify pathogens, disruption of a database will cause delays in obtaining an identification. However, it is hard to estimate how many research projects or clinical operations do require real-time query of remote servers or databases. One major reason for loss of data availability is that web sites or databases are no longer maintained. In some cases, an older version of a website (NMPDR) is superseded by a new website (PATRIC). In several cases (not listed in this article), the web site link simply becomes obsolete. Another reason for loss of data is the adoption of distributed data models across shared high-performance research networks. A database may be freely shared in such a collaboration space, but there are not always resources to keep the database online and available for sharing with future users. It is hard to estimate the impact of such loss of availability. However, the manual labor for data curation, system and data integration, and web site development are lost.",

Many major research universities are equipped with cluster computing servers that have been used as the backends for these computationally intensive services.

However, it is unclear how databases ensure that the data are intact during the transfer process. Simple methods such as cryptographic checksums could be implemented to ensure data integrity. There are concerns that malicious users can inject large amounts of useless data to public databases. Current quality control mechanisms do not allow the curators to control data quality with regard to the above mentioned, hypothetical situation. However, a large data set upload is controlled by the database administrator such that it is unlikely that random, large data sets can be integrated into a database without being noticed. Another possibility is that malicious users can modify certain records in a public database. However, it is difficult to imagine the motivation for performing such an attack on public genome databases. Another model for data protection is the use of encrypted databases (Eykholt et al., 2017) or the use of secure multiparty computation (Evans et al., 2018). For example, access to databases does not have to be binary, allowing or denying access based on access control models. One can reveal partial views of the database as needed.",

Two examples we reviewed are FDA-ARGOS and FDA-GenomeTrakr projects. Neither of these projects maintain their own databases for the data generated by these projects. Instead, data are uploaded as BioProjects to the NCBI database. This approach provides better guarantee for longer term availability of research data.
