Pneumonia is the most common reason for hospital admittance among NH residents and a significant cause of mortality. It has been estimated that 40 % of lower respiratory tract community-acquired infections in persons >65 years old in the US are caused by viruses [2]. Each year about 54,000 deaths that occur in this population are due to infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus (InfV) A and B [3, 4]. Infections caused by other viruses such as human rhinoviruses and human enteroviruses (hRV/EV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and human coronaviruses (hCoV) have also been reported, but data on the role of these viruses in the elderly are scant [5].",

Viral respiratory infections can be sporadic or epidemic. RSV epidemics in adults usually alternate with epidemics of influenza and are clinically difficult to distinguish. Picornaviruses (hRV/EV) are predominantly associated with the common cold but are also the cause of lower respiratory tract infections, especially in small children and the elderly [7].] HMPV and hCoV are distributed worldwide, and in countries with temperate climates they usually cause winter epidemics, which often follow an RSV outbreak [8, 9]. Nevertheless, knowledge about infections with these viruses in NH residents is incomplete. In comparison to acute care hospitals, infection control practices in NH cannot be as strict; many vulnerable people with underlying chronic diseases share common spaces for daily activities and infections can spread easily. Due to daily visitors and NH staff, viral infections from the community can be introduced into the NH. In addition, scant clinical symptoms combined with a shortage of medical personnel and limited diagnostic facilities can lead to delayed recognition of infections and consequently delayed introduction of preventive measures.",

Potential other explanations for the lower ARI incidence rate could have been the result of a fewer number of visitors to demented in comparison to non-demented residents (not found in the present study) and/or less intensive personal contacts among family members and demented residents (not assessed in the present study). Nevertheless, in two European studies [17, 18] dementia was not found as a risk factor for respiratory tract infection among NH residents.",

According to the published data, up to 40 % of LRTI in hospitalized elderly persons are linked to viral infections [2] and up to 23 % cases of radiological confirmed pneumonia in adults have a viral etiology [19\u201322]. We used a multiplexed real-time RT-PCR method, which is highly sensitive for detecting viruses in nasopharyngeal swabs [23, 24]; consequently, a higher percentage of viruses was detected among ARI episodes in our study as compared to studies not based on PCR methodology. Our findings in NH residents corroborate the findings of Liebermann et al., who reported a very high proportion of viruses involved in pneumonia (31.7 %) and in other LRTI (51.7 %) in adult patients [2]. However, the etiological role of viruses demonstrated in nasopharyngeal swabs in patients with ARI is associated with some ambiguity and is particularly problematic in patients with LRTI. Although the viruses may cause LRTI, they may also cause only URTI but not concurrently present LRTI (this may be due to bacterial superinfection, which viral URTI predisposes toward), or could simply be innocent bystanders. In this study, viruses were detected in nasopharyngeal swabs of 7.4 % healthy NH residents (mostly hRV/EV) and in 6.9 % of healthy NH staff (exclusively hRV/EV). These results are comparable with the 4 % occurrence of viruses in nasopharyngeal swabs obtained from healthy elderly persons living in the community [21] and with the findings of Liebermann et al.
