C. jejuni is commonly found in the intestinal tract of many food-producing animals, such as poultry, cattle, and sheep [1]. In these hosts, C. jejuni generally persists without causing visible clinical symptoms of disease. Although it has been historically known that C. fetus subsp fetus (vibriosis) is the main cause of ovine abortion, recently C. jejuni has been increasingly implicated in ovine abortion cases worldwide [2-5]. Campylobacter-induced ovine abortion rates usually range from 5% to 50% in infected flocks [4,6]. C. jejuni has been identified in aborted lambs during multiple lambing seasons on different farms in Iowa, Idaho, South Dakota, and California [5]. A specific tetracycline-resistant C. jejuni clone (SA) has emerged as the major cause of C. jejuni-associated sheep abortion in the USA [5]. In addition, clone SA has been also detected in abortion cases in cows and goats [7].",

Furthermore, infection can occasionally result in the retention of dead fetus in the uterus which may cause death of pregnant ewes due to septicemia and uterine sepsis; however, no clinical signs can be seen at the beginning of infection [4]. The mechanisms by which the gut commensal C. jejuni is able to establish systemic infection and lead to an acute abortion in sheep are still not completely defined. Furthermore, in a recent study, PFGE analysis of C. jejuni SA isolates revealed a high similarity to human gastroenteritis-associated C. jejuni isolates [7]. This suggested a potential relevance of these ovine abortion isolates to human health. Therefore, there is a critical need for understanding the pathogenesis of C. jejuni induced abortion.",

By necessity, microbial pathogenesis studies are heavily focused on the use of in vivo models, because the host immune responses interplay with pathogen evasion constitute a complex response that cannot yet be accurately replicated in vitro. Experiments were designed to use the minimal number of animals (4 ewes per group) necessary to generate interpretable data. Specifically, based on the C. jejuni associated abortion rates reported in the literature (50%) and preliminary studies, using 4 animals per group yielded a power of 0.85 (\u03b1 =0.05). Since the objective of this study was to understand the complex host-pathogen interactions, the use of laboratory animals was unavoidable and justifiable.",

IHC was carried out using an in house protocol that was developed for pig tissues as described previously [17]. Paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned at 3 \u03bcm thickness and collected on positively charged slides (Fisher Scientific, PA). The slides were kept at 60\u00b0C for 20 min, deparaffinized in xylene twice for 5 min each, and rehydrated through a graded ethanol series (100% to 50%). Endogenous alkaline phosphatase was quenched with glacial acetic acid (20%) for 2 min at 4\u00b0C. Antigen retrieval was performed using 100 \u03bcg ml-1 of proteinase K (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The tissue slides were then washed in PBST three times and blocked with 1\u00d7 buffered solution of casein (Universal Blocking Reagent; Biogenex, Fremont, CA) in distilled water for 30 min at room temperature to saturate nonspecific protein-binding sites. Sections were coated with monoclonal antibodies and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C in a humid chamber. After three washes with PBST, the sections were flooded and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C with goat anti-mouse IgG labeled with alkaline phosphatase (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) diluted 1 in 200 in PBST. After three washes with PBST, the final reaction was generated by immersing the tissue sections in a staining solution [1 tablet of Fast Red in 2 ml of 0.1 M Tris-buffer (pH 8.2); Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany] for 10 min at room temperature.

For microarray data analysis, linear regression models were used for comparisons among different treatment groups. Due to the small sample size per treatment group, the P-values were not adjusted for multiple gene testing within each treatment group comparisons. However, the overall type I error at 0.05 for the multiple group comparisons (4 treatment groups and 6 comparisons) was strongly controlled. Therefore, based on the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons test [21], a P-value =0.05/6 = 0.008 was used as cutoff to determine if a gene was differentially expressed within a comparison group. Subsequently, the tests were ordered by fold change and P-values.

Of the 51 genes analyzed, 14 (~27%) of up- and/or -down regulated genes were common among different datasets (Table 2), 23 (45%) were up-regulated only, and 14 (~27%) were down-regulated across all groups compared. The genes encoding extracellular marker proteins and other proteins involved in immune responses, cellular apoptosis and necrosis, embryonic development, cellular growth, proliferation and differentiation, and organismal injury and abnormalities were also differentially expressed among the different comparisons (Table 2). Of particular interest, several genes evidently showed down shift expression in animals from G2 and G3 compared to either G1 (infected with 81\u2013176 C. jejuni) or the control non-inoculated group (Table 2). For example, the gene encoding GATA binding protein 6 (GATA6) was down-regulated by approximately 2 folds in G2 and G3 as compared to the control non-inoculated group. Similarly, gene encoding insulin-like 3 (Leydig cell; INSL3) was downregulated by approximately 2 and 3 folds in G2 and G3, respectively, compared to the negative control group. The gene encoding chordin (CHRD) was down-regulated by approximately 2 and 2.4 folds in G2 and G3, respectively. However, several genes were up-regulated particularly in aborted ewes from G2 and G3 compared to either G1 or the control non-inoculated group. For example, the gene encoding matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP2) was up-regulated by around 2.1 and 2.4 folds in G2 and G3, respectively. The gene encoding tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) was up-regulated by around 2 folds in both G2 and G3 as compared to G1. The gene encoding gamma-glutamyl carboxylase (GGCX) was up-regulated by 2.4 and 3.5 in G2 and G3, respectively (Table 2).",

Recently, it was shown that the C. jejuni clone SA can effectively induce abortion in pregnant guinea pigs [9]. However, no studies have characterized the virulence of these strains in a natural host (sheep). In this study, under experimental conditions, abortion-associated C. jejuni belonging to clone SA seemed to effectively induce abortion or stillbirth in pregnant sheep when high doses of inoculum (109 CFU in 1.5 ml of SS for i/v) were used. This corroborated a previous study [8] and was further confirmed in our preliminary trials where no abortion was observed in pregnant ewes infected with lower doses of C. jejuni (106 CFU in 1.5 ml of SS for i/v), although several significant clinical signs such as uterine prolapse and retained placenta were noted (data not shown). Additionally, based on our preliminary trials, the differences in the pregnancy stages of ewes might result in disparity in the induction of abortion. However, when using the higher dose of C. jejuni and ewes with synchronized pregnancies, typical abortion occurred in one (G3-O-2) of the ewes that were orally inoculated with the ovine isolate from G3 at PID 15 (Figure 1A). Stillbirths were also observed in 2 cases (G2-V-1 and G2-V-2) from G2 and one case (G3-O-1) from G3, which were inoculated i/v and orally with bovine and ovine isolates, respectively (Table 1). Furthermore, one ewe (G3-V-1) infected i/v, died 20 h post-inoculation and in the other ewe (G3-V-2) no C. jejuni was isolated from any tissues. However, at postmortem G3-V-2 was found to be heavily infested with tapeworm, which might have affected C. jejuni colonization. The cause of sudden death might be due to acute septicemia and uterine sepsis or due to the septic shock which can be caused by the systemic inflammatory response to the bacteremia of Gram negative bacteria [4,15].",

Based on this observation, it is presumed that these strains might employ bacteremia to establish their infection in the reproductive organs. Using IHC, bacterial antigens were mainly detected in trophoblasts lining the chorioallontoic membrane, usually undergoing necrosis (Figure 2E and F). Placentomes also exhibited severe suppurative inflammatory and necrotic lesions possibly caused by C. jejuni, which was frequently observed within the lesions (Figure 2C and D). Similar necrotic lesions with numerous large C. jejuni aggregates (colonies) in the placental villi and adjacent stroma were previously identified in inoculated ewes [8]. These data indicate a possible cellular tropism of abortion-associated C. jejuni in the placental epithelial cells possibly transported via the bloodstream. Consistent with suppurative inflammatory lesions in other major organs, such as uterus, liver, spleen, and lymph node, the bacteriological examination revealed C. jejuni in multiple tissues, including liver, spleen, uterus, placenta, blood, small intestine of infected ewes, as well as from offspring\u2019s feces, fetuses\u2019 meconium, small intestine and blood as shown in Table 1. Based on the data, the abortion-associated C. jejuni might be able to induce systemic infection, usually accompanied by intestinal and reproductive infection. In the pregnant guinea pig model, large numbers of C. jejuni were mainly retrieved from placental and uterine tissues, while small to moderate numbers of bacteria were recovered from feces and blood as well as from fetal liver and lung samples [9]. Similarly, high counts of C. jejuni were detected in uterine and placental tissues and from stomach content, bile, and feces of ewes infected with ovine abortion C. jejuni as well as from aborted fetuses [8].",

Previous studies showed that up-regulation of IL-15 gene in trophoblasts contributed to recurrent abortions, suggesting that this cytokine can be a marker for pregnancy failure [33,34]. Similar to increased expression of IL-6 gene stated earlier, up-regulation of IL-15 gene expression was detected in the G3 and G2 vs. the negative control. The activated immunological status during pregnancy after inoculation with the abortion-associated C. jejuni might be implicated in the related abortive pathogenesis. The increased apoptotic cell death in placental tissues particularly from aborted ewes in G2 and G3 vs. the G1 or control group (Figure 4) might be related to the increased responses of pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-6, and IL-15 as described previously [35-37].",

ST-8 has been previously recorded in different hosts, including humans [5,13], thus the abortion isolates may have zoonotic potential warranting further investigation of their implications to public health. Although there are no reports on associating clone SA to human abortions, the highly abortificient nature and the presence of large number of bacteria in aborted materials as well as in fetal tissues [9] may pose a potential environmental risk for zoonotic infections. The latter is also indicated by existing evidence that suggest that the clone SA is associated with human gastroenteritis [5,7]. Both ovine and bovine abortion associated C. jejuni in this study were capable of invading the human intestinal epithelial cells (INT407). Specifically, ovine abortion-II was as invasive in INT407 as the hyper-invasive strain C. jejuni 81\u2013176 (Additional file 1: Figure S2) and showed significantly higher intracellular survival than that of the NCTC11168 (P < 0.05), a poorly invasive strain [38]. These findings further highlight the potential public health impact of the abortion associated C. jejuni strains.",

Necrotic lesions and suppurative inflammation in the placenta and endometrium coincided with increased expression of the genes related to cellular necrosis and pro-inflammatory responses accompanied by decreased expression of the genes that account for embryonic development. The distinct genomic contents and transcriptome responses of clone SA may facilitate its systemic spread and subsequent localization in the sheep uterus leading to abortion. However, further studies are needed to define the bacterial factors contributing to clone SA\u2019s unique virulence and pathogenesis in sheep. Although a relatively limited number of animals was used in this study, the results show that, sheep as an animal model, can provide useful and novel insights into the pathogenesis and the host responses triggered by bovine and ovine abortion-associated C. jejuni clone SA.",
