However, seasonal changes were not observed in the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), storage symptom score, voiding symptom score, and quality of life (QoL) (5, 6). As well, changes in fluid temperature did not significantly change the threshold volume of bladder sensation or increase the incidence of idiopathic detrusor overactivity in urodynamic studies (7). There is no general consensus about the effect of environmental temperature on LUTS associated with BPH and overactive bladder (OAB). Therefore, we focused on ambient temperature as an environmental factor affecting LUTS associated with BPH or OAB, and attempted to explain the temperature difference changes in BPH or OAB severity.",

In this present study, average temperature was not a risk factor for LUTS for adjusted age in multiple regression analysis (P=0.322).

However, in the present study, the maximum daily temperature difference was 16.9oC, which was lower than in previous studies. Also, in general, elderly people have shorter exposure times and well-controlled body temperatures in the winter season due to their typically limited physical activity, which could lead to a smaller exposure to extreme temperature changes.",

However, in general, the human body\u2019s activity changes with the seasons and gradually adapts to the exposure temperature throughout the season. This phenomenon may account for our finding that the temperature effect on the risk of BPH/OAB may not affect urinary symptoms in the general population. For instance, in a cold stress-induced detrusor overactivity model, when skin temperature stabilized after 20 min of low temperature (4\u00b12\u00baC) exposure and was maintained for the duration of exposure (19), demonstrated that a momentary cold stimulus can act as a trigger for the urinary responses. Also, the results of this model were associated with a sudden decrease in skin temperature (19). This present study also supports previous results that the time-dependent reductions of low temperature stimulated responses represent an adaptive response that is universal in normal healthy humans. Moreover, individual efforts to maintain warmth through the wearing of heavy clothes and heating the environment could diminish the trigger effect of low temperature on LUTS.",

However, as in most epidemiological surveys, there will be some errors in exposure classification. In this study, which was performed as a large-scale research project that covered seven major areas of South Korea, the collected data were judged to be sufficiently homogeneous. As a result, the misclassification of this study would most likely be non-differential with regard to temperature status. This would tend to bias the regression parameter toward null. Second, this study does not include the detailed biological data of each population, which means we could not determine clinical BPH or OAB.
