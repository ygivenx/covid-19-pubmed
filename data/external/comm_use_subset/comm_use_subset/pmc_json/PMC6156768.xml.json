Clinically the disease manifests by reproductive disorders in sows and respiratory lesions and poor growth performance in growing pigs. The etiological agent of the disease, PRRS virus (PRRSV) is an enveloped, positive-sense single-strand RNA virus classified in the order Nidovirales, family Arteriviridae. Two genotypes, Type 1 and Type 2, sharing approximately 60% of genetic similarity were described [1]. A newly proposed classification denotes both types as different species within Arteriviridae family (https://talk.ictvonline.org/taxonomy/). Type 1 can be further divided into at least four genetic subtypes, namely Pan-European subtype 1 and subtypes 2, 3 and 4 represented by strains circulating in Eastern European countries [2]. Gathering evidences suggest the existence of additional subtypes. However, the genetic subtyping based on a small genomic fragment of ORF5 and ORF7 can be affected by genetic recombination [3\u20135].",

            "text": "The differences in pathogenicity between PRRSV strains were hypothesized to originate from different degrees of immunomodulatory properties. The virus utilizes a range of mechanisms to influence the immune response including weak stimulation of interferon production and slow development of cell-mediated immunity, inhibition of the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and weak and delayed neutralizing response [13]. As a result, the course of infection may advance to a chronic stage lasting even up to 21 weeks [14]. Insufficient stimulation of an immune response and high level of genetic variability also constitute key problems in the development of efficient vaccines. None of the currently used vaccines provides full protection against infection and their effectiveness is often compromised towards heterologous strains [15]. Deeper knowledge on the core mechanisms of host-pathogen interactions and the relevance of genetic diversity is necessary to facilitate the development of efficient tools for PRRS control.",

In short, piglets from three sows were divided into four experimental groups, ensuring that each litter was equally represented in every group. Three groups of 8-week-old pigs were infected with a PRRSV Type 1 strains including subtype 1 strain 18,794 (DAN) isolated in 1993 in Denmark [19], a Russian isolate ILI6 (ILI) and a Belarusian isolate BOR59 (BOR) from 2009, each classified as subtype 2 strain based on ORF5 sequence, respectively. Pigs were inoculated intranasally with 2 ml of virus inoculum prepared based on 5th (titre of 5.4 log10 TCID50/ml), 3rd (titre of 6.8 log10 TCID50/ml) and 2nd (titre of 4.4 log10 TCID50/ml) passage in porcine alveolar macrophages culture for DAN, ILI and BOR strains respectively. The fourth, PRRSV- negative control group, was sham-inoculated with 2 ml of Eagle\u2019s medium. Individual pigs were subjected to daily clinical examination and measurement of rectal body temperature. The severity of clinical lesions was assessed based on a scoring system adapted to PRRS [18]. An overall well-being, respiration, eye disorders and appetite were scored as 0 (normal condition) to 3 (severe disorder). The scores for individual pigs were added up to a cumulative clinical score (CS) per day. During the experiment no mortality was recorded and none of the animals displayed the acute clinical signs defined as endpoint criteria. Euthanasia of the pigs was performed on 22\u201324 DPI by intravenous injection of pentobarbiturate (50 mg/kg) followed by exsanguination by cutting arteria axillaris.",

Each pool was processed in four repeats using Two-Color Microarray-Based Gene Expression Analysis, Low Input Quick Amp Labeling-Agilent Technologies. Briefly, 50 ng of total RNA (equal amount of RNA of each animal were pooled) was reverse transcribed to generate cDNA and then transcribed into Cy3-labelled cRNA (samples obtained from control animals) and into Cy5-labelled cRNA (samples obtained from infected animals). After purification of labelled RNA (Qiagen RNeasy Kit), the yield (ng of cRNA) and specific activity (pmol of Cy3 or Cy5/\u00b5g of cRNA) were quantified using Nanophotometr Pearl (IMPLEN). Hybridization was performed by preparing a target solution containing 300 ng Cy5-labeled pool cRNA from infected animals, 300 ng Cy3-labeled pool cRNA of uninfected animal and then fragmentation buffer was added and incubated at 60 \u00b0C for 30 min. After stopping fragmentation, samples were hybridized on Agilent arrays for 18 h at 65 \u00b0C in Agilent hybridization chambers in an Agilent hybridization oven rotating at 10 rpm. After hybridization the arrays were subsequently washed with \u2018GE wash buffer 1\u2019 for 1 min at room temperature, \u2018GE wash buffer 2\u2019 for 1 min at approximately 37 \u00b0C, each chamber washed twice.

Moreover, these genes were previously described in the context of PRRSV infection. Results were normalized using \u03b2-actin as a reference gene. These quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCRs were carried out using the pooled RNA samples subjected to microarray study. Furthermore, to validate whether analysis of pooled samples reflects the gene expression in the individual specimens, also the relative expression of four selected genes (OAS1, CXCL2, IFN-\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2) was assessed in RNA from the individual pigs by RT-qPCR. The list of primers used in the study is shown in Table 1. Primers specific for the \u03b2-actin gene were used as described elsewhere [20], while the primers for target genes were designed using Primer 3 Plus bioinformatics tool (http://primer3plus.com/cgi-bin/dev/primer3plus.cgi). Similarly as for microarray experiment, RNA samples from each control and experimental group were pooled ensuring the same concentration of RNA from each animal. Then 1.5 \u00b5g of each pooled sample were digested with DNase I Amplification Grade (Invitrogen) and after reverse transcribed using NG dART RT kit (EURX). The synthesis of cDNA was performed at 47 \u00b0C for 50 min. The qPCR was performed in a Rotor Gene Q (Qiagen).

Relative gene expression levels were calculated using E-method described by Pfaffl [21] and fold-change units were calculated by dividing the normalized expression values coming from infected animals by the normalized expression values in the controls. The same procedure was applied for individual samples where 80 ng of each individual RNA sample was used.",

Interestingly the top pathway in both ILI and BOR group was the same (Agranulocytes Adhesion and Diapedesis), while in DAN group Acute Phase Response Signaling was the top process involving the highest number of up-regulated genes. On the other hand, when down-regulated genes were analysed, two pathways were common in all groups DAN, ILI and BOR (EIF2 Signaling and Regulation of eIF4 and p70S6K Signaling), one (Glucocorticoid Receptor Signaling) was identified in DAN and ILI groups and another one mTOR signalling process was noted in DAN and BOR groups (Table 4). Additional analysis was performed to determine top 5 canonical pathways involved in immunological processes (Tables 5, 6). Most of the top canonical pathways involved in immunological processes were the same as in previous analysis. Agranulocyte Adhesion and Diapedesis were the pathways involving the highest number of up-regulated genes in ILI and BOR groups, but was also second on the list in DAN group (Table 5). Two pathways observed to be common only for BOR and ILI group were: Granulocyte Adhesion and Diapedesis and Leukocyte Extravasation Signaling. Production of Nitric Oxide and Reactive Oxygen Species in Macrophages was the process noted as common between DAN and BOR groups, while Interferon Signaling was the pathway noted in both, DAN and ILI groups. When analysis considered only down-regulated genes (Table 6), there was only one top immunological pathway found in all three groups (B Cell Receptor Signaling). Another two pathways: NF-\u03baB Signaling and CD40 Signaling, were noted in DAN and ILI groups while PI3K Signaling in B Lymphocytes was identified in both BOR and ILI groups. Additionally, one pathway Production of Nitric Oxide and Reactive Oxygen Species in Macrophages was noted in DAN group as one of the top canonical pathways in the analyses of up- and down-regulated genes.

The results were presented as a heat map based on activation z-score (Fig. 3), which represents the bias in gene regulation that predicting whether the particular pathway is in an activated or inactivated state. In general, most of the processes were down-regulated in DAN group, in contrast to ILI and BOR. More similarities were observed between ILI and BOR groups, although there were some pathways regulated differently in both groups. From 20 canonical pathways presented in Fig. 3 the pathways with applicable z-score were chosen for further analysis. Three of the top pathways similarly activated in both ILI and BOR groups and inhibited in DAN group were Fc\u03c7 Receptor -Mediated Phagocytosis in Macrophages and Monocytes, TREM1 signaling and Chemokine Signaling. Different regulation predicted by IPA in each of three groups was noted for IL-6 Signaling, being in activated state in BOR group, non-altered in ILI group and inhibited in DAN group. The p38 MAPK Signaling pathway was activated in BOR group, while in ILI and DAN groups showed different levels of inactivation. While, IL-8 Signaling, was associated with positive z-score in BOR group, in ILI z-score was equal to zero and in DAN group it reached a negative value.",

The answer to such a challenge might be the use of high-throughput analysis tools, like DNA microarrays or deep sequencing, to study transcriptional response of the host after virus infection. Most of such studies included only Type 2 PRRSV strains [23\u201325], while only single ones enrolled Type 1 strains [26]. Even recently published data on the virulence of subtype 2 strains of Type 1 showed that some of those strains may characterize with high pathogenicity which implies distinct mechanisms shaping the course of infection [18].

Previous reports described already some interactions between PRRSV and ISGs, like inhibition of ISIG15 [36] and PKR [37] functions. Unfortunately, still little is known about particular interactions between PRRSV and ISGs like OAS, IFIT1 or Mx1. Recently Badaoui et al. [38] described up-regulation of OAS1 expression in LV-infected PAMs. In addition, Zhao and co-workers [39] observed in an in vitro system that PRRSV infection led to induction of OAS1, while knockdown of endogenous OAS1 increased the PRRSV mRNA level. Interestingly, our data strongly support this finding in vivo, since the increase of OAS1 expression ranging from FC of 24.121 in DAN group, 26.910 in ILI up to 35.236 in BOR group, was correlated with the strength of particular PRRSV strain replication measured by N protein encoding gene expression. Although the detailed role of OAS1 gene in PRRSV infection is not yet recognized, the results may support a direct restriction function of this gene to virus replication. The function of OAS in the context of PRRSV infection may be similar to this described in other viral infections, where OAS proteins have been identified as enzymes sensing exogenous nucleic acid and initiate antiviral pathways. In our analysis also other genes from OAS family were observed to be strongly up-regulated. OAS2 gene showed increased expression in BOR and ILI groups, while OASL gene was found to be up-regulated in all three groups of infected animals. Those observations suggest the involvement of OAS proteins in various mechanisms engaged in the defense against PRRSV infection, also observed in studies of other viral infections [40\u201342].",

            "text": "Further genes regarded as ISGs are those encoding interferon-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats: 1, 2 and 3 (IFIT1, IFIT2 and IFIT3). Transcription of IFIT genes is triggered usually in the case of viral and bacterial infections, mostly by Type I IFNs (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) and type III IFNs (IFN-\u03bbs) [46, 47]. Independently, IFIT genes are induced in cells infected with RNA viruses which are sensed by pattern recognition receptors [48]. In the presented study increased expression of IFIT1 was noted in DAN (FC = 5.313) and ILI (FC = 3.983) groups, while IFIT2 up-regulation was observed in BOR (FC = 11.521) and ILI (FC = 5.432) groups, as well as IFIT3, which expression increase reached FC = 17.080 in BOR, FC = 10.152 in ILI and FC = 3.245 in DAN group. Interestingly, up to now only IFIT3 was linked to PRRSV infection as an important modulator of innate immunity inhibiting virus replication in MARC-145 cells by induction of IFN-\u03b2 [49]. In our study, the profile of IFITs expression differed between subtype 1 strain and subtype 2 strains, thus raising the question whether the same mechanisms are utilized during infection with PRRSV strains by those genetic groups. The specific role of IFIT1 and IFIT2 is binding single-stranded RNA, thereby acting as a sensor of viral single-stranded RNAs and inhibiting expression of viral messenger RNA [50, 51]. Some differences in antiviral activity between IFIT proteins were previously described for human parainfluenza virus type 3 [52]. Based on those observations it seems that there are some individual features, like distinct tertiary structures, which allow IFIT proteins to bind different partners and selectively affect host-virus interactions.",

GZMA induces caspase-independent cell death with morphological features of apoptosis, when delivered into the target cell through the immunological synapse [58].

Such observation is analogous to the results obtained by Wysocki and co-workers, who also observed the up-regulation of this pathway in lungs of PRRSV-infected pigs [62]. Tight junctions are specialized membrane domains, which maintain adjacent cells close enough to avoid uncontrolled passage of small molecules, microorganisms and cells, across the paracellular space [63, 64]. They are also involved in regulation of some cellular processes, including polarization, proliferation, differentiation and gene expression [65\u201367]. Our results suggest that also PRRSV may hijack tight junctions to use cellular machinery to support its own replication. It has been already reported that some viruses are able to regulate the expression or localization of tight junctions proteins to induce cell transformation or make their exit process more efficient. Reports evidenced the importance of tight junction for the infection of different viruses, including reoviruses, influenza virus or human immunodeficiency virus 1 [68\u201371].",

The coincident down-regulation of mTOR Signalling in DAN group and PI3K Signaling in B Lymphocytes in ILI and BOR groups indicate the clear influence on inhibition of cellular protein synthesis. This picture, clearly observed in ILI and DAN groups, is known to be one of the hallmarks of interferon signaling [72]. A similar picture was observed by Wilkinson and co-workers in pigs infected with PRRSV Type 2 strain [73]. Additionally, Cell Cycle: G1/S Checkpoint Regulation pathway controlling the passage of the cells from the G1 into the DNA synthesis (S) phase, was associated with down-regulated genes in BOR group. Zhou et al. showed already that the genes relevant to cell cycle and DNA replication can be regulated by highly pathogenic PRRSV [74]. Similarly, Sun and co-workers noticed in microarray experiment that PRRSV nsp11 is able to regulate cell cycle and DNA replication and by in vitro experiment proved that nsp11 induced the delay of cell cycle progression at the S phase. Such cell cycle arrest may be beneficial for the virus, since it can redirect cellular replicative machinery for viral replication, as can be observed for other DNA and RNA viruses [75].",

Ligation of CD40 on the surface of dendritic cells controls the production of particular proinflammatory cytokines (IL-8, MIP-1\u03b1, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-12), while its ligation on monocytes is required for stimulation of production of IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-8, and in the rescue of circulating monocytes from apoptosis. The impairment of this pathway affects simultaneously both cellular and humoral immune response. The impairment of B cell receptor signaling strongly affects humoral immune response, since signals propagated through the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) are crucial to the development, survival and activation of B lymphocytes. Furthermore, it is also linked with stimulation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF\u03baB) and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways resulting in the nuclear accumulation of transcription factors and enhancement of protein synthesis and therefore its down-regulation impairs mentioned processes, accompanying already mentioned pathways, EIF2 and EIF4 [76]. In BOR group, additionally, Antiproliferative Role of TOB in T Cell Signaling and T Helper Cell Differentiation processes were found to be significantly associated with down-regulated genes. A transducer of ERBB2 (TOB) is a negative regulator of T cell proliferation and cytokine transcription, which is constitutively expressed in unstimulated peripheral blood T lymphocytes and selectively expressed in anergic T cells. Down-regulation of TOB is necessary for T cell activation what is crucial during infection [77]. But when this whole process undergoes down-regulation, together with T Helper Cell Differentiation process, it changes the situation and heavily impairs cellular immune response and cytokines signaling, crucial in the face of infection [78].",

Fc\u03b3 Receptor-mediated Phagocytosis in Macrophages and Monocytes, TREM 1 signaling and Chemokine Signaling pathways were activated in both strains from subtype 2 (BOR and ILI), while in subtype 1 strain DAN their inhibition was observed. Fc\u03b3 Receptor-mediated Phagocytosis in Macrophages and Monocytes plays a role in defense against invading bacteria. Infection with PRRSV may sensitize pigs to secondary bacterial infection. It was shown that expression of Fc\u03b3RIIB was up-regulated post-infection with PRRSV strains HN07-1 and BJ-4 but an expression of Fc\u03b3RIIIA receptor was inhibited, what in consequence could suppress the phagocytosis of granulocytes [79]. On the other hand, Fc\u03b3R-mediated activation of monocyte derived macrophages (MDM) is a potent mechanism of HIV-1 suppression [80]. The activation of Fc\u03b3 Receptor-mediated Phagocytosis in Macrophages and Monocytes pathway after BOR and ILI infection may reflect the host attempt to control viral replication. Although the whole pathway is in an inactivated state in the DAN-infected group, we observed up-regulation of Fc gamma receptors (subtypes Fc\u03b3R1A, FC = 3.7).",

Similarly, an increase of activity in TREM 1 pathway was noted for ILI and BOR strains. Furthermore, in infection with Lena as well as ILI and BOR strains, the expression of IL-8 and TLR4 was up-regulated.

Particularly interesting results were described for CCL4 cytokine (MIP-1\u03b2), recently investigated in several PRRSV studies. Miller et al. [82] and L\u00f3pez-Fuertes et al. [83] observed that the level of transcripts encoding CCL4 declined in porcine alveolar macrophages following infection with both Type 2 strain VR-2332 and European Type 1 PRRSV isolate 5710. In our study we observed the opposite effect and up-regulated expression of CCL-4 in BOR (FC = 2.5) and ILI (FC = 1.8) groups. The same additive effect for this inflammatory mediator was noted in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells BMDCs pre-infected with PRRSV (IAF-Klop PRRSV genotype 2 strain) after a subsequent infection with S. suis (wild-type virulent S. suis serotype 2 strain P1/7) [84]. CCL-4 is considered as the most potent chemoattractant and mediator of virus-induced inflammation in vivo [85], thus acitivation of Chemokine Signaling pathway and up-regulation of CCL-4 can contribute to the higher virulence of BOR and ILI strains compared to DAN observed in an animal experiment.",
