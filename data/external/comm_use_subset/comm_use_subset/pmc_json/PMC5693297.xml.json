In the context of dengue, the invaded community is composed of two main species: human hosts and mosquitoes of the species Ae. aegypti whose interaction is further affected by environmental factors (climate, urbanization, human behavior). The invading species under consideration, dengue viruses, cannot establish itself in new areas unless the receiving community presents certain conditions to sustain autochthonous virus transmission. More formally, the emergence of dengue fever in a new region depends on the occurrence of two major events: (i) the arrival of at least one infected individual in the city and (ii) the subsequent positive growth of autochthonous dengue cases (i.e., disease establishment) [26].",

Given the daily probability of travel \u03c0ij,m, \u03c4k is also the number of monthly trials for the probability of an infected individual boarding a flight during his infectious period. Combining this information, the monthly case importation probability pij,m can be estimated as\npij,m=1-(1-\u03c0ij,m)\u2211k=1ki,m\u03c4k.(1)\nFollowing the same rationale, the yearly probability of dengue importation, Pij,s, at dengue epidemiological year s, can be estimated by aggregating over all months of the corresponding epidemiological year, that is\nPij,s=1-\u220fm(1-pij,m).(2)\nThis construction allows us to provide a ranking of states by their probability of exporting a dengue-infected individual to Acre, that is, the most probable sources of case importation at any given epidemiological year. It also allows us to estimate the source-independent yearly dengue importation probability, that is, the probability of at least one importation to Acre in a given year regardless of its state of origin, which can be written as:\nPj,s=1-\u220fi(1-Pij,s)(3)\nThis quantity describes the temporal dynamics of the Acre\u2019s overall exposure to dengue-infected individuals.

Secondly, the presence of clusters or transmission chains is indicative of further transmission. Thirdly, if the transmission is sustained, the incidence curve will increase at an exponential (or subexponential) rate, characterizing an epidemic [33]. The available dengue notification data do not have information on travel history or clustering of the reported cases. Here, evidence of transmission is indirectly obtained from the notification data via the calculation of the effective reproductive number, Rt. This index is interpreted as the average number of secondary cases generated by a primary case at time t [34], calculated as the ratio of secondary to primary cases. A value of Rt > 1 indicates a sustained growth of incidence. Since no information is available on who infected whom, the primary cases are inferred from the generation interval of dengue, that is, primary cases are those that could be the source of transmission for the current cases given the time between the onset of their disease symptoms. This approach formally described by Wallinga & Lipsitch [34] results in the following expression for Rt:\nRt=b(t)\u2211a=0\u221eb(t-a)g(a),(4)\nwhere b(t) is the number of new cases reported at week t and g(a) is the probability distribution of the dengue generation interval (time between onset of symptoms in a primary case and onset of symptoms in a secondary case) taken as a Normal distribution N (\u03bc = 3weeks, \u03c3 = 1week). Confidence intervals for the ratio of two Poisson counts were calculated using the method described in [35] and Rt > 1 was ascertained if p(Rt > 1) > 0.95.",

Meanwhile, the states of Rio de Janeiro (RJ), S\u00e3o Paulo, Minas Gerais (MG) and Bahia (BA) had the highest dengue cases recorded. As discussed in the methods section, the probability of case importation to Acre is a combination of both the number of travelers and dengue activity. Fig 2 shows the probability of dengue case importation into Acre from 2001/2002 to 2011/2012. It reached ca. 70% in 2001/2002, reducing to its lowest level (38%) in 2003/2004, steadily increasing to ca. 100% from 2004/2005 to 2007/2008, remaining so until the end of the study period.

The contribution of Rond\u00f4nia, Distrito Federal and Mato Grosso to the exportation of dengue to Acre was mainly associated with the flow intensity between these states while that of Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo was a result of the combination of moderate flow intensity and high rates of dengue activity.

There are two main types of access, those cities in which access is by road (black and orange) and those in which the final access is by waterway (blue). Before 2008/2009, only cities in which access is by road registered Rt > 1. However, these records were mostly intermittent, as can be seen for example in Bujari (Bjr), Capixaba (Cpb), Assis Brasil (AB), Porto Acre (PA), Acrel\u00e2ndia (Acld), Pl\u00e1cido de Castro (PC) and Xapuri (Xpr). Cruzeiro do Sul (CZS) in gray, which is the only city served by an airline to Rio Branco, also registered few weeks with Rt > 1 before 2008. After this year, when several paving works and road maintenance were concluded, the frequency increased eventually becoming more intense culminating with CZS recording the first sustained epidemic in 2014. The time frame of infrastructural changes and its potential impact on dengue cases notification is discussed in more detail in the section Dengue spread in Acre. The municipalities in orange, M\u00e2ncio Lima (ML), Rodrigues Alves (RA), Tarauac\u00e1 (Trc) and Manoel Urbano (MU), also have access by road, but part of the final access was under construction or maintenance during all or almost all the period of study. In these municipalities, as well as in those with final access by waterway, the first records of Rt > 1 occurred in the beginning of 2008, in a slow way, while in those cities with access by waterway, the records were even rarer than those accessible by roads.",

In contrast, transportation and mobility between the southeast and other regions of Acre (Alto Juru\u00e1) is still very difficult due to road conditions, although improvements have occurred during this period. The accessibility to the northwest area of Acre began to improve after the year 2008, when paving of the highway BR-364 in the region of Manuel Urbano (MU) and Feij\u00f3 (Fj), in the central area of Acre. Highway BR-364 is the only one that crosses the state from Acrel\u00e2ndia (Acl, in the southeast) to M\u00e2ncio Lima (ML, in the northwest) and connects Acre to the rest of Brazil via Rond\u00f4nia state.",

In southeast Acre the paving and restoration of this highway were completed quickly, and only the stretch from Acrel\u00e2ndia to Rio Branco was still under construction until 2007/2008. The stretch from the capital to Cruzeiro do Sul, at the northwest part of the state, passes through very unstable soil, making it difficult to maintain during the monsoon season. Only in 2012/2013, this stretch was completely paved, but in the following years repairment works were needed. Besides this highway, an extremely important link between the southeast and northwest Acre is the daily flight between Rio Branco and Cruzeiro do Sul, which increased by 18% from 2001 to 2012. The most remote municipalities are Santa Rosa do Purus, Jord\u00e3o, Marechal Thaumaturgo and Porto Walter with very limited access and only by river, most of them only by small and medium-sized vessels depending on the time of year. On the other hand, air travel alone was responsible for an average of 134 passengers to Acre per day during the epidemiological year 2001/2002, steadily increasing to almost 500 per day in 2013/2014, most of them to Rio Branco, responsible for approximately 90% of all air travel to Acre from other Brazilian states. To illustrate the impact of interstate airflow in this population, the 2010 Census registered 3.6 thousand commuters to Rio Branco, so that the average daily out-of-state air passengers corresponded to almost 4% of daily commuters in 2001/2002, up to almost 14% in that of 2013/2014. This data contrasts with the common misconception regarding air travel to Acre and its impact to information inflow, which is believed to be negligible due to its relatively low volume with respect to the rest of the Country.",

            "text": "The connectivity between municipalities is shown in Fig 4. We used Cytoscape software [55] to build a representation of the Acrean municipalities\u2019 mobility network, with edge width and color proportional to the natural logarithm of the daily number of travelers and node size proportional to the natural logarithm of each municipality\u2019s population (node color indicate access mode, as in Fig 3). Nodes position are defined based on the Fruchterman\u2013Reingold algorithm [56], which is a force-directed layout widely used in network visualization. In this layout, all nodes have a repulsion force between them, while edges weight are used as an attractive force between connected nodes. Nodes that share stronger connections, i.e., with more travelers, are placed closer to each other than those that share weaker or no connection. Therefore, groups of nodes sharing stronger bonds among them form regional clusters in this abstract space of connectivity. This particular visualization facilitates the detection of municipalities that share relatively strong bonds even when geographically far apart. On the other hand, nodes that are placed on the periphery with this algorithm are those that have relatively few and/or weak connections. We can see that the two most populous municipalities, the capital Rio Branco (RB) and Cruzeiro do Sul (CZS), are important hubs in this network. The access mode (waterway, paved and unpaved roads, airway) confers a natural clustering on the mobility network, suggesting an intuitive relationship between ease of access (transportation network) and the number of travelers (mobility network). Municipalities accessed by paved roads are more densely connected with each other, while the strong connection between Rio Branco and Cruzeiro do Sul, which are connected by airports, considerably shortens the effective distance between east and west side of the state. Another example of this relationship is the fact that municipalities which are mainly accessed via waterways are peripheral in the mobility network. In fact, Marechal Thaumaturgo (MT), Jord\u00e3o (Jrd) and Santa Rosa dos Purus (SRP) have the lowest Ew, Cw and Sw centralities, with Porto Walter (PW) also among the five municipalities with lowest values for those centralities.",

A summary of the main results is shown in Table 1. This is an exploratory analysis only, since the sample size is small for modeling. Strength centrality was the network descriptor most negatively correlated with T3. This result suggests that municipalities in which the sharing of individuals with other municipalities was larger had a greater exposure to dengue and, consequently, smaller T3 than those with lower integration. The Eigenvector centrality of the municipalities, which is related to how strong is the connectivity of a node\u2019s neighborhood, therefore its ability to concentrate population flow in the network, also presents negative correlation with T3. This is an intuitive result since this property enhances the probability of a node being invaded once a node in its vicinity presents an outbreak, even when not in direct contact. Finally, the distance from Rio Branco, measured by both the effective distance and in kilometers, also showed high correlation with T3. It is interesting to note that, geographical distance aside, topological properties of the unweighted structural network are not significantly correlated with T3. It is important to highlight that about half of the Acrean municipalities did not meet the criteria of dengue establishment, which has a significant impact on the correlation obtained. With that in mind, we also investigated if those network properties were correlated with the event of dengue establishment itself. In Fig 6, we show boxplots comparing the centrality of municipalities that witnessed dengue establishment during the study period and those which did not. This comparison allows for the evaluation of whether municipalities grouped by occurrence (YES/NO) are also characterized by significantly distinct network properties. It is possible to identify that the descriptors most correlated to T3 were also those that differed the most between municipalities with and without dengue establishment, which are the geographical and effective distance to Rio Branco, Eigenvector and Strength centralities.",

These municipalities are the same municipalities where Rt > 1 was detected earlier in time, being municipalities along BR-317 (SG, Cpb, Xpr, Epcd and Brl) or with a direct connection to RB (PA) and two with good access to BR-364 since the beginning of the study (SM and Acld). From 2002 to 2006, another three municipalities reported the presence of Ae. aegypti: Pl\u00e1cido de Castro, Bujari and Assis Brasil. Bujari is the nearest neighbor of Rio Branco, but Ae. aegypti presence was not confirmed until 2006. It is difficult to ascertain the specific causes for this. On the one hand, this was a predominantly rural municipality in the early 2000\u2019s. On the other hand, there was not a well-structured vector surveillance program implemented in small towns such as Bujari until later. Pl\u00e1cido de Castro and Assis Brasil are frontier municipalities, the former at the border with Rond\u00f4nia state, receiving a considerable traffic of vehicles from the highly dengue endemic neighbor state. It is reasonable to infer that Ae. aegypti could be present there previously but unnoticed. However, dengue only established itself in Pl\u00e1cido de Castro in 2012/2013, despite the consistent detection of cases since 2001. Assis Brasil is a small town at the triple frontier Brasil-Peru-Bolivia. In 2000, it had a considerably small population, which may have contributed to the delayed invasion of Ae. aegypti.",

Both municipalities presented an increase in the number of rural settlements [59]. Population growth, coupled with the increase in urbanization without improving the coverage of general services\u2014such as garbage collection, water supply and sanitary sewage (Table 2) \u2013, contribute to the fact that, even in a more rural state, the ideal conditions for establishing the mosquito are guaranteed.

Even small differences in landscape composition, which are often unapparent, can alter the microhabitats of the vector and thus the conditions that allow the amplification of a pathogen [60]. In addition, the dispersion of pathogens and vectors is directly linked to the development of transportation networks and increased globalization [49].

In Acre, the revitalization of its major roads, as well as the increased accessibility by air both to and within the state, have increased dengue vulnerability. Notice that the increase in the flow of people and importation of dengue cases to Acre coincides with when disease dispersion becomes more pronounced within the state, suggesting a synergy between increasing vulnerability of the state at a global scale and increasing local vulnerability among municipalities, fueling viral spread in the region. Human mobility is responsible for viral spreading, as both asymptomatic humans or those with very mild symptoms continue to carry out their tasks and take the virus to other regions. Humans are also responsible for possibly transporting the mosquito itself (which can be infected or not) by air, road, and waterway [2, 7, 62].",

However, the strength (S) was the most relevant of the descriptors, because, in a small network, the relationship between local and global characteristics are stronger. Rio Branco is the main attractor of the state, with highest and strongest connectivity within Acre, since most of the routes connecting municipalities in the northwest to the southeast region pass by the capital. Also, it is a reference center for the entire state. A node with high connectivity, that is, a node to which many others connect to and where there are many outputs, is an essential node for the propagation of infectious diseases [63]. Therefore, investing in dengue control and prevention in a systematic manner in Rio Branco has potentially a strong impact throughout the state, not only because of its connectivity within Acre but also because this city is the main port-of-entry from other Brazilian states.",

The flow of people by air between Rio Branco and Cruzeiro do Sul, and the improvement of the BR-364 were very significant predictors of this first epidemic in the northwest region of Acre. Although Cruzeiro do Sul confirmed the presence of the Ae. aegypti only in 2008 [58], ever since the beginning of the study there were records of cases in the municipality, even when there were no records in intermediate connections by road between both municipalities.

Since dengue epidemiological year of 2009/2010, all roadways directly connected to those two hubs had their maintenance concluded. Also, the unpaved connections to and from Manoel Urbano, which is structurally in between the two Acrean hubs, had also improved by that time. Most of its paving work was concluded by the end of 2010, although maintenance works continued for the rest of the study period. Despite the unavailability of detailed movement for performing a rigorous analysis, it is to be expected that during the period with unpaved and with major maintenance works in the roadways the flow of individuals was lower than when those structural bottlenecks were resolved. Therefore, we expect that the 2010 mobility flux data is more representative of the work/study-related movement from 2009 onwards. Before that, we conjecture that this particular type of human mobility was more concentrated over those connections with paved roads and without major maintenance work.",

In the area surrounding Cruzeiro do Sul, which was mainly connected by waterways (dashed blue edges) and roads under maintenance (orange edges), before 2007/2008 the occurrence of Rt > 1 was registered only once at M\u00e2ncio Lima (ML) and a few times in Cruzeiro do Sul. These results reinforce the hypothesis that those cases notified in Cruzeiro do Sul were most likely imported cases from Rio Branco due to the airline connection. It is interesting to note that in terms of roadways, the path from Rio Branco to Cruzeiro do Sul had a structural bottleneck at Manoel Urbano (MU) since it was only accessed by means of unpaved road (red edges) up to 2007/2008.",

We can see that is was precisely after those improvements that dengue notifications started to occur throughout the state of Acre, as well as the number of consecutive weeks with Rt > 1 in each municipality. The combination of low occurrence of Rt > 1 during the years with unpaved and under maintenance roadways, and the increased observation of Rt > 1 after improvements were implemented reinforces the hypothesis that the human mobility network and the structural changes were relevant to the observed geographical spread of the virus in the state of Acre.",

The peripheral municipalities according to the network descriptors are also those with the smallest populations and are, mostly, more rural than urban. These municipalities are less vulnerable and less receptive to dengue, which is seen by the low occurrence of Rt > 1 and no event of sustained transmission as defined in this study. Nonetheless, in the world, there has been increased reporting of Ae. aegypti invasion and dengue introduction in less urbanized areas. In Colombia, dengue-infected Ae. aegypti was found in rural regions [65] south of Bogot\u00e1. In Nicaragua, a study showed the unsuspected presence of dengue cases in those areas as well [66].",

It is fundamental that all municipalities, especially those with a roadway link, systematically monitor mosquito infestation, which is not currently the case. In addition, favorable conditions for mosquito development are present in Acrean municipalities, with low coverage of services, climate and increased urbanization [25], which probably impacts on the availability of breeding sites for Ae. aegypti and its establishment. Acre has a humid equatorial climate, which may contribute to the transmission of the dengue virus occurring throughout the year. According to [50], the mosquitoes of the region have the vectorial competence to transmit the DENV-2. Unfortunately, we did not find more biological information on the mosquito populations of Acre. We can conclude that Acre is a state at risk of major dengue epidemics, with entire populations susceptible to all serotypes of the disease. Due to the limited data and number of municipalities, our analysis is more descriptive/qualitative than quantitative. Nonetheless, we believe that the descriptors discussed here as well as the methodological approach has proved a valuable way to assess invasion risk which can be easily expanded to larger areas\u2014conditioned on data availability \u2013, allowing for a more quantitative analysis..",
