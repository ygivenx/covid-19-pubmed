Multiple progenitor populations have been identified as either specialized or facultative, depending on the conditions analyzed, such as physiological turnover or response to injuries [3, 4].

Phenotype control of isolated cells represents a delicate task to manage in vitro, for both basic and translational research. Multiple stimuli play synergic roles on lung stem cell niches, modulating proliferation, commitment, epithelial\u2010to\u2010mesenchymal (EMT) or the opposite mesenchymal\u2010to\u2010epithelial transition, and crosstalk with stroma [4, 9, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. The extracellular matrix has a central influence as well. Different proteins are known to affect progenitor phenotype and regenerative potential, such as laminin [21, 22], fibronectin [21, 23], and collagen/gelatin [24], depending on the cell type and on the developmental stage. Moreover, standard two\u2010dimensional (2D) culture systems deeply differ from the in situ microenvironment, whereas three\u2010dimensional (3D) conditions often provide multiple advantages for many systems [25, 26, 27].",

In this study, we have investigated the influence of different substrates and a 3D/2D culture switch on the biology of LPCs isolated as spheroids from normal adult human lung biopsy specimens, whose translational relevance has been recently highlighted [14], characterizing their differential phenotype and paracrine properties. We show how culture as spheroids can significantly increase LPCs\u2019 epithelial commitment compared with culture as monolayers, and how they can gain paracrine and phenotypical features of an ex vivo epithelial progenitor cell niche. Our data support for lung tissue the same notion derived from other tissues; that is, in vitro 3D culture systems are among the most effective approaches to control stemness/commitment balance, and to create ex vivo a functional niche\u2010like microenvironment for progenitor maintenance and commitment.",

After institutional review board approval and signed informed consent, lung tissue was obtained from 3 patients (1 26\u2010year\u2010old woman and 2 men, ages 18 and 20 years) who underwent lung surgery for benign disease at the Division of Thoracic Surgery, \u201cSant\u2019Andrea\u201d Hospital (\u201cLa Sapienza\u201d University of Rome, Italy). Lung tissue biopsies were obtained during video\u2010assisted thoracoscopic surgery procedures using a mechanical stapler (Echelon Endopath; Johnson & Johnson, Somerville NJ, http://www.ethicon.com). Cell culture protocol was based on other spheroid culture systems [9, 10, 14, 28, 29]. In particular, lung tissue from each patient was thoroughly washed in phosphate\u2010buffered saline (PBS) and mechanically minced into 1\u2010 to 2\u2010mm3 pieces, digested for 15 minutes in 0.05% trypsin\u2010EDTA, divided into equal amounts, and then plated as primary explants on Petri dishes coated with fibronectin (FN; BD Biosciences, East Rutherford NJ, http://www.bdbiosciences.com), gelatin (GEL), or laminin (LAM; Sigma\u2010Aldrich, St. Louis MO, http://www.sigmaaldrich.com) in complete explant medium (CEM). CEM medium is made of Iscove\u2019s modified Dulbecco\u2019s medium (IMDM) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin\u2010streptomycin, 1% l\u2010glutamine, and 0.1 mM 2\u2010mercaptoethanol. After 3\u20134 weeks, outgrowth explant\u2010derived cells (EDCs) were harvested by serial washes with PBS, EDTA, and mild trypsinization, and plated on poly\u2010d\u2010lysine\u2010coated multiwell plates at 6,000 cells per cm2 in pneumosphere growth medium (PGM). PGM medium is made of 35% IMDM plus 65% Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM)/F\u201012 mix, supplemented with 3.5% serum, 1% penicillin\u2010streptomycin, 1% l\u2010glutamine, 0.1 mM 2\u2010mercaptoethanol, 1 unit/ml thrombin (Sigma\u2010Aldrich), 1:50 B\u201027 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Life Sciences, Waltham, MA, http://www.thermofisher.com), 80 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor, and 25 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF; Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ, http://www.peprotech.com). After 1 week, lung spheroids, here named pneumospheres (PSs), were collected by pipetting and centrifugation (50 relative centrifugal force [rcf]), and plated as PS\u2010derived cells (PDCs) on the corresponding coating in CEM media. Secondary PSs (IIPSs) were obtained again by replating PDCs on poly\u2010d\u2010lysine coating. For differentiation stimuli, PDCs and PSs were cultured for 1 week in bronchial/epithelial growth medium (BEGM; Lonza, Basel, Switzerland, http://www.lonza.com). The isolation procedure is summarized in Figure 1A. Spheroid dissociation was achieved by 10\u2010minute incubation in trypsin 0.05% with gentle pipetting every 2 minutes.",

Representative panels for PS staining are shown in Figure 2; their features were comparable to other described spheroid models. In fact, small PSs at an early stage of growth were highly positive for the stemness marker Oct4 [33], and proliferating double\u2010positive Ki67+/Oct4+ cells could be identified (Fig. 2A). Also, PSs contained a majority of TTF1+ cells (Fig. 2B) while expressing very low levels of VIM. When attaching to the culture plate surface, however, PDCs spreading from the PS as a monolayer were highly positive to vimentin staining (Fig. 2C), suggesting the acquisition of mesenchymal traits and cytoskeletal remodeling. PSs contain some dispersed cells positive for AQP5 (Fig. 2D), whereas KRT5 and pro\u2010SFTPC were detectable in the outer layers (Fig. 2E), consistently with a commitment gradient inside the spheroid. At early timing of attachment, examples of clusters of cells migrating from the PSs and still highly positive for KRT5 and pro\u2010SFTPC could be detected (Fig. 2F). Cells positive for vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (KDR) and cytokeratin 18 (KRT18) were not detectable at this stage in any of the coatings tested (data not shown). Once fully attached and spread in 2D, relevant subsets of PDCs expressed ki67 (15.8% \u00b1 1.5%), Oct4 (45.2% \u00b1 4.6%), and thyroid transcription factor\u20101 (TTF1; 38.6% \u00b1 2.9%) independently of the coating, as assessed by quantification of immunofluorescent staining; most were positive for vimentin (Fig. 2G\u20132J).",

Endothelial markers were modulated, with a further increase in KDR levels but a decrease in AQP1, which was downregulated in a similar proportion in PDCs as well.

PSs produce and release a wide panel of humoral factors, some of which are already described [14], including cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and regulatory proteins (Fig. 5A; supplemental online Table 2). In particular, the strongest array signal was that of EGF, together with highly detectable levels of other growth factors such as insulin\u2010like growth factor\u20101 (IGF\u20101), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and glial cell\u2010derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). Binding proteins, such as insulin\u2010like growth factor\u2010binding protein (IGFBPs), that regulate growth factor availability and are suggested to play roles in stem cell biology [37, 38], were produced as well. PSs secreted chemokines, such as IL\u20108, MCP\u20101, MIP\u20101\u03b1, and RANTES; and proteins, such as osteoprotegerin, with a well\u2010known immunomodulatory function. Metalloprotease inhibitors (i.e., TIMP1, TIMP2), mitogenic factors (i.e., GRO) and regulatory factors for EMT and development (i.e., tumor growth factor [TGF]\u03b22, FGF9) [17] were detectable, as well. When comparing the CMs of PSs and PDCs, significantly different secretomic profiles were evident, as shown by plotting optical density ratios of differentially secreted factors (Fig. 5B) or optical densities from the screening of the two CMs (Fig. 5C). Interestingly, the secretion of the epithelial factor EGF had the highest PS/PDC ratio, whereas TGF\u03b21 the lowest, being secreted only by the more mesenchymal\u2010like population (i.e., PDCs).",

Conversely, a culture switch to the 3D spheroid system of the PS was very efficient in committing cells toward epithelial phenotypes, independently of the original coating (Figs. 2, 3E; supplemental online Fig. 1). Moreover, LPCs as 3D PSs were significantly more responsive than PDCs to specific commitment stimuli, such as culture in BEGM media (Fig. 4). Overall, these data support the creation of a 3D, proepithelial niche\u2010like structure for adult LPCs inside PSs [9, 13].",

In our study, we further supported this notion by showing, for the first time to our knowledge, the peculiar paracrine properties of human PSs (Fig. 5; supplemental online Table 2). In fact, we have identified several distinctive secreted factors in PS\u2010CM known to play a key role in lung homeostasis, development, injury, and cell\u2010cell communications. When comparing the paracrine profile of 3D with 2D culture, a specific modulation is evident of multiple humoral factors (Fig. 5), including a downregulation of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., MCP1, tumor necrosis factors, GCP2, BLC, eotaxin) and an upregulation of the growth factors EGF and IGF1 in PSs. EGF is the main mitogenic stimuli for AT2, for both normal alveolar renewal and response to injury [48, 49], and it is released in higher amounts in 3D PSs consistently with increased epithelial commitment (Figs. 2, 3E; supplemental online Fig. 1). On the contrary, the mesenchymal factor TGF\u03b21, which exerts a major role in collagen production and induction of EMT associated with pathological fibrosis [50, 51, 52], is secreted only by PDCs and not in the niche\u2010like stage of PSs. Although lung progenitor cells derived from spheroids have been shown to exert antifibrotic effects [14], these results suggest that the administration of LPCs as PSs could even enhance this beneficial property. Further studies will clarify this hypothesis.",

Thus, PDCs likely represent a single bipotent stromal progenitor population expressing minimal epithelial features but capable of significant epithelial commitment when cultured in optimal spheroid conditions, consistently with similar phenomena observed in vivo [56]. In fact, increased vimentin expression by lung epithelial cells has been described as a TGF\u2010\u03b21\u2010dependent reversible response to stress and injury [56], consistently with superior TGF\u2010\u03b21 release in PDC 2D culture (Fig. 5).
