With over 836 cases and at least 290 deaths [1], there has been a rapid increase in the number of MERS-CoV cases as diagnostics are being more widely applied. While dromedary camels are suspected to be involved in zoonotic transmission of MERS-CoV [2]\u2013[5]; and camel as well as horse DPP4 can efficiently facilitate virus entry [6], the mechanism(s) by which most people acquire MERS-CoV is still unclear. Since targeted attempts to prevent zoonotic transmission are currently not feasible and significant morbidity and mortality still occur in individuals with comorbidities, developing effective prophylactic and therapeutic treatment strategies remains a high priority. Although several treatment regimens have been suggested for use in patients based on in vitro MERS-CoV studies or treatment implemented during the SARS-CoV pandemic, only one such treatment has been tested in vivo against MERS-CoV to date [7]. To enable a better evaluation of MERS-CoV treatment and prevention strategies, an animal model more representative of severe human disease is crucial.",

Attempts to generate small animal models of disease have so far not been successful. Mice [8], [9], hamsters [10] and ferrets [11] do not support replication of MERS-CoV in what appears to be a receptor dependent manner. To overcome this impediment, it was recently demonstrated that adenovirus vectored transduction of human DPP4 into multiple strains of mice, including various knock-outs, results in productive infection and mild pneumonia [12]. Notwithstanding the aforementioned mouse models, the only naturally permissive MERS-CoV disease model that has been described to date is the rhesus macaque model [13]\u2013[15]. In the rhesus macaque, MERS-CoV causes a transient infection of the lower respiratory tract resulting in mild to moderate clinical disease. While this model is useful, it seems to recapitulate the mild disease observed in some human cases, rather than the more severe or even lethal disease observed in many human cases. Moreover, although this model has been used to assess treatment strategies [7], [16], it can be difficult as an evaluative model for therapeutics as clinical signs are mild, the duration of illness is relatively short and virus replication is limited.",

Although DPP4 is a relatively conserved protein in general, recent data have shown that receptor specificity is likely a major factor in the species tropism of MERS-CoV [11], [20]. This suggests that mapping the spike binding region of DPP4 of a species of interest before performing experimental inoculations of animals could provide a more rational approach to identifying MERS-CoV susceptible animal models. Here, we modeled the interaction of the common marmoset DPP4 with the MERS-CoV spike protein and show that no differences exist compared to human DPP4 at the site of interaction. Subsequent inoculation of common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) resulted in severe, even lethal, respiratory disease in inoculated animals, with widespread, coalescing bronchointerstitial pneumonia and high viral loads in the lungs of all animals.",

            "text": "Variations in the DPP4 receptor appear to play a major role in the ability of MERS-CoV to infect certain animal species. To predict the ability of MERS-CoV spike protein to bind to marmoset DPP4, analyses were performed using human DPP4 (known to bind MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein) [17] and ferret DPP4 (unable to bind MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein) [11]. Comparison of the amino acid alignments of human, ferret and marmoset DPP4 revealed that marmoset DPP4 is 96.4% identical to human DPP4, while ferret DPP4 is 87.4% identical to human and 87.5% identical to marmoset DPP4. Recently, the 14 amino acids in human DPP4 that facilitate binding to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein were identified by co-crystallography studies [18], [19]. No amino acid differences between human, rhesus macaque and common marmoset were identified within the DPP4 region interacting with the MERS-CoV RBD, whereas between human/rhesus/marmoset and ferret and mouse nine or six amino acid residues were different within this region, respectively (Fig. 1A). The 100% identity of the 14 amino acid residues between human and marmoset DPP4 in the interaction regions indicates that MERS-CoV RBD should bind to marmoset DPP4. This was further supported by modeling the binding potential between human, ferret and marmoset DPP4 with the MERS-CoV RBD. No significant differences in binding energy were observed between the human (\u2212981) and marmoset (\u2212978) DPP4 \u2013 MERS-CoV RBD, whereas the binding energies between ferret DPP4 and the MERS-CoV RBD was significantly higher (\u2212601). A marmoset DPP4 homology model was built using the human DPP4 structure (PDB ID: 4KR0, Chain A). This model demonstrated that all amino acid differences between human and marmoset DPP4 were located away from the binding region of DPP4 with the S1 portion of the spike glycoprotein; the nearest residues to this interface that differ are Arg343, Ile193 and Val279 which are 14A, 10A and 13A away, respectively, from the nearest atom in MERS-S (Fig. 1B). Taken together this suggests that marmoset DPP4 would facilitate binding with the MERS-CoV RBD and that marmosets would be susceptible to MERS-CoV infection.",

Animals were assigned for scheduled necropsies on 3 (CM1, CM2 and CM3) and 6 (CM4, CM5 and CM6) dpi prior to the start of the experiment; three additional animals (CM7, CM8 and CM9) were monitored for survival (Fig. 2A). Starting on 1 dpi six of nine animals showed increased respiration rates while all animals had increased respiration rates from 2 dpi on. In some of the animals open mouth and/or labored breathing was evident from 3 dpi onwards. All animals showed loss of appetite and decreased levels of activity. Clinical scores were assigned using an established scoring sheet for respiratory disease in common marmosets (Table S2). Based on this system, peak clinical scores were observed between 4 and 6 dpi with scores returning to baseline by 13 dpi in the two remaining animals (Fig. 2B). Animals exhibited decreased temperatures starting on 3 dpi, returning to a normal range on 9 dpi (Fig. S1A). On 4 dpi, two animals (CM5 and CM9) were euthanized due to the severity of disease as determined by clinical score (Fig. 2A), which included increased respiration rate, open mouth breathing and failure to move following prompting. One of these animals also exhibited the presence of frothy hemorrhagic discharge from its mouth. While most animals showed a decrease in body temperature by 3 dpi; the two animals that were euthanized on 4 dpi were severely hypothermic indicative of the onset of shock at the terminal stages of disease (Fig. S1A). Clinically significant alterations in blood cell counts and chemistry were not noted in any of the animals (Fig. S1B\u2013J) in contrast to the rhesus macaque model. As serial blood samples could not be collected on a daily basis on marmosets, due to the small size of the animals, alterations were likely missed as a result of study design. Elevations in liver enzymes (Fig. S1E\u2013G) and measures of kidney function (Fig. S1I,J) occurred on 3 and 4 dpi, respectively; however, these changes were not outside of the normal range. The animals euthanized on 3, 4 and 6 dpi all showed hypoproteinemia consistent with high protein pulmonary effusions resulting from alveolar edema (Fig. S1K,L).",

The pneumonia tended to be centered on small caliber and terminal bronchioles and extended into the adjacent pulmonary parenchyma. Viral antigen was exclusively associated and located throughout regions that contained pathological changes (Fig. 4B,D,F,H,J). The bronchiolar epithelium was frequently eroded, leaving attenuated bronchiolar epithelial cells. Affected bronchioles were filled with small to moderate numbers of macrophages and neutrophils, and occasionally small amounts of fibrin and edema (Fig. 4E,G). The adjacent alveolar interstitium was thickened with congestion, edema and fibrin and moderate numbers of macrophages and neutrophils (Fig. 4E, Table S4). Alveolar spaces contained moderate to marked numbers of pulmonary macrophages and neutrophils; multifocally there was pulmonary edema, fibrin, and less frequently hemorrhage (Fig. 4E). There were also rare multinucleate syncytia within alveolar spaces (Fig. 4E). At 6 dpi multifocal to coalescing areas of acute pneumonia were still visible; however, there were also extensive areas of type II pneumocyte hyperplasia (Fig. 4G) and consolidation of pulmonary fibrin resulting in multifocal hyaline membranes (Fig. 4I). These changes are consistent with a transition from acute to a more chronic reparative stage of pneumonia. Regions that were undergoing tissue remodeling showed evidence of clearing of viral antigen (Fig. 4 H). The distribution of DPP4 in marmoset lungs included type I pneumocytes (Fig. 5A) as well as bronchiolar epithelial cells and smooth muscle cells. Consistent with this location of DPP4, a two-color fluorescent staining for cytokeratin and viral antigen, as well as in situ hybridization to detect viral RNA, identified type I pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages as the primary cell type for MERS- CoV replication (Fig. 5 B,C). One of the surviving animals (CM7) had to be euthanized prior to the scheduled end of the study (48 dpi) and was found to have severe aspiration pneumonia. The lungs from the other surviving animal (CM8) appeared normal at necropsy 55 dpi. Viral antigen was not detected by IHC in either animal indicating that these animals had resolved MERS-CoV infection. All other lesions noted in the remaining tissues, such as interstitial nephritis in the kidney and the presence of giant cells in the adrenal gland, consistent with extramedullary hematopoiesis, were not considered to be clinically significant since they are typical, incidental findings in common marmosets [22].",

We also observed activation of pathways associated with inflammation, vascularization, endothelial activation, proliferation of smooth muscle cells, and tissue repair, indicating that MERS-CoV infection induces tissue differentiation in marmosets consistent with development of pulmonary fibrosis (Fig. 7B, Table S6).",

            "text": "Despite the observed severe lung pathology, robust antiviral transcriptional responses were induced in the marmoset lungs. Up regulation of innate immune genes such as pattern recognition receptors, interferon-stimulated genes, inflammatory cytokines and signaling molecules, as well as adaptive immune responses such as lymphocyte signaling, proliferation, and differentiation, immunoglobulin production, antigen presentation, and T cell costimulation were observed. We were able to detect many common serum cytokine transcripts using RNAseq, which unfortunately cannot be measured in immunoassays as these are not available for common marmosets. Notably, we detected down regulation of interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3) and its receptor (IFNGR1) at multiple time points, and no expression of interferon beta (IFN\u03b2), consistent with reports that MERS-CoV infection attenuates these cytokines [24]\u2013[29]. We did observe up regulation of the type I interferon receptor (IFNAR1, IFNAR2) and interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) induced by type I interferon responses, in addition to the type III interferon receptor (IFNLR1), (Table S7). We also observed significant down regulation of IL-8 and IL-18 at all time points, and up regulation of IL-27 for all animals. IL-1\u03b2 was up regulated in the 4 dpi samples, but down regulated at 3 and 6 dpi. As cytokine transcripts generally have a short half-life, in some cases we were not able to detect DE cytokine transcripts, but were able to detect changes in their receptors or molecules associated with cytokine signaling. We observed up regulation of the receptors for IL-2 (IL2RB), IL-4 (IL4R), IL-6 (IL-6R), IL-17 (IL17RC, IL17RE), IL-22 (IL22RA1), and IL-27 (IL27RA), and down regulation of receptors for IL-1 (IL1R1, IL1RAP), IL-12 (IL12RB2), IL-18 (IL18R1), and IL-20 (IL20RA) (Table S7). Using the Molecule Activity Prediction (MAP) tool in IPA, we were able to generate a network of these molecules showing the predicted activity of cytokines not identified in the dataset at 4 dpi (Fig. 7C). The MAP tool utilizes relationships with molecules neighboring the DE transcripts in this dataset to predict transcriptional behavior. These relationships are based on published work curated in the IPA knowledgebase, and provide insight into the dynamics of all molecules within a given network or pathway generated using the primary transcriptional data from this experiment. While type I interferons, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-6 were predicted to be induced, type II interferons and the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1 and TNF\u03b1 were predicted to be at least partially inhibited. While transcriptional induction of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF\u03b1 was expected, especially given the extent of inflammation in the lungs, the time points for sampling may have been too late to catch TNF\u03b1 induction as it is one of the first cytokines induced during inflammation. Its induction is supported by downstream effectors such as NF\u03baB, RelA, and RelB and many accessory proteins that were unregulated at the time points investigated. Moreover, as TNF\u03b1 signaling tends to be down regulated rapidly, the up regulation of SOCS3, which is induced by TNF\u03b1 as part of a negative feedback loop that ultimately results in suppression of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1, was observed at all time points.",

Two of the six animals that were not euthanized at the scheduled 3 dpi necropsy had to be euthanized due to severity of disease, making this the first lethal MERS-CoV animal model. In both the marmoset and rhesus macaque [15] models, viral replication occurred predominantly in the lower respiratory tract; however, in marmosets MERS-CoV RNA was also detected in the blood. This is suggestive of a more systemic dissemination that was corroborated by the detection of viral RNA in nearly all tested tissues in all infected animals. Taken together, the data from the common marmoset model suggest that this model more closely recapitulates severe, even lethal, human disease caused by MERS-CoV. This differs from the rhesus macaque model for MERS-CoV [13]\u2013[15], which more closely resembles mild to moderate human disease.",

Elevations in creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels were noted on 4 dpi in the two animals that were euthanized, suggesting some degree of kidney involvement during infection; however, the lack of evidence of virus replication in this tissue suggests that this is not a direct viral effect. The acute renal failure in some patients [21] may be a secondary effect of ARDS [30] or other comorbidities and not primarily the result of direct MERS-CoV damage to the kidneys. While evidence of pulmonary fibrosis was not yet observed histologically at the time points investigated, transcriptional evidence of the onset of fibrosis was extensive. Previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) have demonstrated that pulmonary fibrosis was a major mechanism of disease progression, and that lung inflammation caused by infection induced fibrogenic transcriptional programs [31]\u2013[33]. In the marmosets, the role of fibrosis is unknown and needs to be further clarified and supported by data from human cases. We anticipate that studies using larger groups of marmosets, additional control animals, and samples collected at later time points post-infection will confirm the histologic course of fibrosis progression, as well as the transcriptional events underlying these pathogenic processes.",

            "text": "Currently, the only small animal MERS-CoV challenge model available, requires transduction of animals with an adenovirus vector expressing human DPP4 [12]. Although this is a very useful model, MERS-CoV infection in this model is highly dependent on the transduction of cells and level of DPP4 expression from the adenovirus vector and thus does not necessarily reflect the natural disease process. Therefore, therapeutics indicated to inhibit MERS-CoV in in vitro studies likely need to be tested in one of the two described nonhuman primate models. As such, marmosets should likely serve as the animal of choice for future therapeutic studies where possible. Not only does the more severe, and potentially lethal disease set a higher bar for protection, it would also allow a greater differentiation to be made between disease in untreated animals versus treated animals, currently a limitation of the rhesus macaque model [7]. The marmoset model also allows the evaluation of intervention strategies at later time points as the disease process in the rhesus model is rapid and quite transient. However, late treatment that targets the virus, as with many countermeasures, is unlikely to be successful once significant lung damage has already occurred as was observed by the lack of success of very late treatment with ribavirin and interferon in human MERS-CoV cases [34]. To enable treatment of patients prior to severe lung injury, future transcriptional studies may yield early indicators of disease progression that can be used as diagnostic or prognostic tests to improve clinical management. The development of the more severe marmoset model will ensure a better pre-clinical analysis of treatments prior to proceeding to clinical trials in humans. As such, this new MERS-CoV disease model is a significant contribution to reducing the impact of MERS-CoV on global public health.",

Necropsies of three animals were scheduled on 3 dpi (CM1\u2013CM3) and 6 dpi (CM4-6). The three remaining animals (CM7\u2013CM9) were not scheduled for euthanasia, but were used to study survival and seroconversion upon inoculation of animals with MERS-CoV (Fig. 2A). The animals were observed twice daily for clinical signs of disease and scored using a clinical scoring system prepared for common marmosets (Table S2). The in-study euthanasia criteria were established prior to the start of the experiment based on the scoring sheet and euthanasia was indicated at a clinical score of 35 or above (Table S2). During the course of the study, animals CM5 and CM9 were euthanized on 4 dpi as they reached euthanasia criteria.

The remaining unmapped reads corresponding to MERS-CoV genome (GenBank accession no. JX869059.2) were also removed using Bowtie. All the remaining reads were mapped to the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) genome assembly (Genome assembly: C_jacchus3.2.1, GCA_000004665.1) downloaded from Ensembl (version 74) using STAR v.2.3.0.1 [41]. Gene level quantification was obtained using HT-seq (http://www-huber.embl.de/users/anders/HTSeq/doc/overview.html) with Ensembl annotation (v74). For the downstream analyses we only retained those transcripts with at least 40 raw read counts in at least one sample. The raw read counts were normalized using edgeR [42]. For the calculation of expression ratios, an offset of 5 was added to the normalized expression levels, i.e. counts per million (cpm) values to dump down variations due to low abundances. We identified transcripts with greater than 2-fold change relative to the uninfected control, and used Spotfire DecisionSite (Tibco) to perform hierarchical clustering using the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic means (UPGMA) method, and generate heatmaps. Functional enrichment analysis was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Raw data were deposited into the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) via the Gene Expression Omnibus (accession number pending).",
