            "text": "The genus flavivirus (family Flaviviridae) comprises several pathogens, including dengue virus (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV), West Nile virus (WNV), tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). Flaviviruses that are pathogenic to man are transmitted to humans by bites of mosquitoes or ticks [1]. The incidence and geographical distribution of the four distinct DENV serotypes and its vector are increasing dramatically. DENV causes more than 50 million infections annually (mainly in South-East Asia and Latin America) and infections with this virus may develop into dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS) [2]\u2013[4]. Increased disease severity has been associated with pre-existing heterologous DENV antibodies, a phenomenon described as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection. Antibodies have been found to enhance viral entry into Fc-\u03b3-receptor-bearing cells and to alter the antiviral immune response, leading to increased virus particle production and subsequent immune activation. During homologous re-infection, antibodies are believed to neutralize the infecting virus and provide life-long protection against disease development. Intriguingly, however, during heterologous re-infection, cross-reactive antibodies have been implicated to enhance viral replication leading to a higher infected cell mass and increased viral burden. There is neither a vaccine nor a specific antiviral therapy available [3]. This is also the case for YFV that, together with DENV, is a leading cause of hemorrhagic fever worldwide, although a highly efficacious vaccine is available [5]. Furthermore, vector-control strategies that were once successful in eliminating YFV have faltered, thereby leading to a re-emergence of the disease [5]. The World Health Organization currently estimates that there are 200,000 cases of yellow fever annually of which over 90% occur in Africa, resulting in about 30,000 deaths per year [6]. There is, as is the case for most of the other flaviviruses, no antiviral drug available for the treatment of YFV infections.",

LCTA-949 inhibits DENV-2-induced CPE formation in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2A). At 25 and 12.5 \u00b5M LCTA-949 (concentrations that did not prove cytotoxic as assessed microscopically and by the MTS/PMS method), DENV-2-induced CPE formation was completely inhibited. Although LCTA-949 did not reduce viability of uninfected host cell cultures, at concentrations of 50 and 100 \u00b5M as assessed by the MTS method, some cytostatic effects were noted at these concentrations when cells were counted with a Coulter Counter. DENV (Figure 2B panel C) and YFV (Figure 2B panel F) protein expression (respectively E and NS1) was completely inhibited at a concentration of 12.5 \u00b5M LCTA-949. The antiviral effect of LCTA-949 was further confirmed in virus yield reduction assays [EC50 value of 6.9 \u00b5M\u00b12.9 \u00b5M for DENV-2 and 5.1\u00b13.1 \u00b5M for YFV-17D]; ribavirin was included as a reference molecule (Figure 3). In addition LCTA-949 inhibited the replication of the tick-borne encephalitis virus (EC50: 0.3 \u00b5M), the West Nile virus (EC50: 13 \u00b5M), the Japanese encephalitis virus (EC50: 4.3 \u00b5M), and the murine flavivirus Modoc virus (MODV) (EC50: 9.2 \u00b5M) (Table 1).",

Addition of the compound at the time of infection resulted in nearly complete inhibition of viral replication and viral antigen expression (Figure 4).

The ability of DiD-labeled virions to bind to cell surface receptors at increasing concentrations of LCTA-949 was assessed in highly permissive BS-C-1 cells. In untreated cells, on average 65\u00b115 DiD-labeled virus particles were detected. Addition of LCTA-949 markedly reduced the number of bound virus particles to cells in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 5A). At a concentration of 25 \u00b5M, LCTA-949 inhibited virus-cell binding by 80%. These results demonstrate that LCTA-949 acts by preventing virus-cell binding. Next, we investigated whether LCTA-949 has an additive effect on the membrane fusion capacity of the virus. To this end, BS-C-1 cells were infected with DiD-labeled DENV-2 particles in the presence of different concentrations of LCTA-949. The relative extent of virus fusion was estimated by measuring the total fluorescent signal per imaging field. Membrane fusion activity of DENV was efficiently reduced in cells treated with the reference controls ammonium chloride and chlorpromazine (Figure 5B) [11]. LCTA-949 markedly impaired membrane fusion activity of DENV (Figure 5A\u2013B). This effect can likely be ascribed to the low binding efficiency of virions to cells in presence of LCTA-949, as no statistically significant added effect was measured for inhibition of membrane fusion activity as compared to the effect on binding (Figure 5A).",

Each of these steps can potentially serve as a target for inhibition of the virus life cycle.

Time-of-drug-addition studies revealed that the compound exerts its antiviral activity at the time of infection and inhibits binding of the virus to the host cell. This was further supported by the observation that LCTA-949 (in contrast to the replication inhibitor ribavirin) has no effect on DENV subgenomic replicon replication and hence does not inhibit the intracellular replication machinery of the virus. Besides, a microscopy-based binding and fusion assay using DiD-labeled particles revealed that LCTA-949 inhibits DENV infection by preventing binding of the virus to the host cell. This observation may point to an interaction of LCTA-949 with the E protein; however, further studies are needed to elucidate the specific antiviral target(s) of this inhibition.

The mechanism of action against HIV and coronaviruses has been ascribed to a likely effect on entry [8]. In contrast, the rather pronounced in vitro activity against HCV is caused by an inhibitory effect on intracellular viral replication. It is remarkable, given the fact that flaviviruses and HCV belong to the same family (Flaviviridae), that one and the same molecule inhibits the replication of such closely related viruses by affecting two entirely different stages in the replication cycle. An interesting example of another antiviral agent that inhibits the replication of two different viruses via a different mechanism of action (but by targeting the same cellular factor) are the cyclophilin binding molecules. Cyclosporin A and related analogues (such as the non-immunosuppressive molecules Debio-025 and MIM811) inhibit the activity of cyclophilins, which are essential co-factors in the replication of both HIV and HCV. The inhibitory effect on HIV replication is caused by an interaction with the matrix protein and thus the encapsidation process [22], whereas the effect on HCV is mediated via the cis/trans isomerisation of HCV NS5A that is required for viral RNA replication [23].",

Subsequently, DiD-labeled DENV was added in the presence or absence of LCTA-949 or a DMSO control, and incubation was continued for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. Unbound virus was removed by gently washing the cells three times with cold phenol red-free MEM. Subsequently, cold phenol red-free MEM containing 1% glucose and a glucose oxidase solution (GLOX) was added to the cells and the microscopic analysis was done as described below. GLOX is composed of a 250 \u00b5M of glucose oxidase (Type VII from Aspergillus niger, Sigma Aldrich No. G2133) solution, prepared in 200 \u00b5L of 1\u00d7 PBS, and 50 \u00b5L of catalase (from beef liver, Roche No. 10106810001). For the fusion assay, the same experimental setup was used except that the cells were kept at 37\u00b0C during the experiment. Ammonium chloride (NH4Cl, 50 mM) and chlorpromazine (60 \u00b5M) were used as negative controls in the fusion assay. The microscopy analysis was done by taking 10 snapshots of randomly selected fields using both differential interference contrast (DIC) and DiD channels. DIC images were taken from each field to make sure that the visualized DiD-particles are bound to a cell and not lying in an empty space with no attached cells. DiD-labeled viruses were detected by epifluorescence microscopy in a Leica Biosystems 6000B instrument by using a 635-nm helium\u2013neon laser. The fluorescent emission was collected by an oil-immersion 100\u00d7 objective with a numerical aperture of 1.46 (Leica Microsystems) and imaged using an EM CCD camera (Hamamatsu 9100-02). A thermostatted stage and objective heater were used to keep the temperature at 37\u00b0C in the fusion assay. The acquired images were processed and analyzed with ImageJ using an in-house macro. In the binding assay, the total number of bound DiD-particles was counted. The extent of membrane fusion was analyzed by measuring the total fluorescent signal per imaging field at 20 minutes post infection. The quantitative results of the negative controls in the fusion assay were taken as background; hence, they were subtracted from the total fluorescence result of the positive control and LCTA-949 treatments.",
