Other species of Perkinsus cause similar afflictions in a wide variety of other marine molluscs worldwide, all of which yield serious losses for shellfish industries [1]. This genus belongs to the crown group of eukaryotes known as Alveolata, but its exact phylogenetic position is debated. Based on the presence of cell surface micropores and an apical complex, P. marinus is historically considered to be a member of the Apicomplexa (for review see [2]), an exclusively parasitic lineage responsible for malaria and other infectious diseases in humans and animals. However, P. marinus shares cytological features with dinoflagellates, such as flagellar spurs and closed mitosis [2]. Phylogenetic studies based on small subunit ribosomal RNA (18S rDNA) and some conserved proteins such as actin and tubulin also conclude that P. marinus is closer to dinoflagellates than to apicomplexans (e.g. review by [2]\u2013[4]), and thus are an early branch of dinoflagellate [4], [5]. These results challenge a proposition that both Perkinsus spp. and related Parvilucifera spp. parasites should constitute an independent phylum named Perkinsozoa [6], [7].",

Under this scenario, the presence of SL trans-splicing in Perkinsus spp. [8], [13] allies Perkinsus spp. with dinoflagellates. While dinoflagellates use a 22-nt conserved SL (DinoSL), P. marinus harbors a longer (22 nt) and a shorter (21 nt) SL, with sequences varying slightly from the canonical DinoSL [14]. In addition, the genome of P. marinus (\u223c86 million base pairs; Project ID: 12736, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomeprj/46451) is closer in overall size to apicomplexans (9\u201360 million base pairs; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomeprj), but orders of magnitude smaller than dinoflagellates (3\u2013250 billion base pairs; e.g. [15], [16]), and P. atlanticus chromosomes are more like typical eukaryotic chromosomes than dinokaryotic chromosomes [17]. Thus, whether Perkinsus spp. should be considered dinoflagellates remains unresolved.",

            "text": "Mitochondrial (mt) mRNA editing is a distinct characteristic of dinoflagellates within Alveolata and can be a useful marker to assess whether a lineage of alveolate is a dinoflagellate [12]. RNA editing is a sequence re-tailoring process that can be recognized by changes in an RNA sequence compared to that of its encoding DNA. Initially used to describe the insertion or deletion of uridine residues in mitochondrial (mt) transcripts in the kinetoplastid protozoans, the term \u201cRNA editing\u201d now also refers to nucleotide (nt) substitutions in RNA that occur in a wide variety of organisms (see [18], [19] for review). In Alveolata, mt gene mRNA editing only occurs in dinoflagellates, displaying the greatest diversity of modifications yet described in the context of a single genomic environment. The frequency of editing events decreases from high levels in the late-branching lineages to none in the ancient lineages such as Oxyrrhis and Noctiluca (e.g. [12], [19]). It is unclear if Perkinsus spp. mt gene mRNAs undergo editing, but the mt cox1 of P. marinus is not translatable by the standard or mitochondrial codon table. The reading frame must be shifted 10 times by an unknown mechanism to yield a consensus COX1 protein [20]. Once verified, this bizarre process may be used as another molecular feature to demarcate Perkinsus spp. from dinoflagellates.",

With the help of the GenBank database for six species and 33 unidentified Perkinsus sp. strains, and the P. marinus genome sequence, we performed thorough phylogenetic analyses and identification of introns in P. marinus. We paid special attention to histones because these proteins were thought to be absent in dinoflagellates until recently (for review see [21]). We used deduced full-length amino acid (aa) sequences of 41 genes to reconstruct phylogenetic trees. Genomic structures and corresponding RNA sequences of the SL gene were analyzed. Sixty-eight Perkinsus full-length cDNAs obtained in our previous studies [8], [14] were mapped to genome sequences to identify corresponding genes, and combined with 36 other reported genes to determine the frequency of introns. Although the Perkinsus clade shares commonalities with dinoflagellates, our data show that it is a unique lineage basal to the monophyletic clade of dinoflagellates.",

To diversify the gene markers for phylogenetic analyses, another 12 conserved gene sequences were collected from our ongoing cDNA sequencing project for these two species, and their 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends achieved using RACE as necessary. Using these as queries, homologs were collected from GenBank for P. marinus and other species mentioned above. The absence of histones, long considered a benchmark of typical dinoflagellates, is erroneous (see [21] for review); thus, histone genes were retrieved from the Perkinsus genome project database. Full-length or nearly full-length mt cox1 and cob sequences were also obtained from P. marinus and P. chesapeaki. The 3\u2032 end of cob for both Perkinsus spp. was obtained using the 3\u2032 RACE technique with Perkinsus cob primers paired with GeneRacer3 primer (Invitrogen).

            "text": "The SL RNAs of two Perkinsus spp. and four dinoflagellates were analyzed by gel electrophoresis and hybridization. Ethidium bromide staining revealed that the two Perkinsus species have similar small RNA molecule profiles with commonalities to the dinoflagellate P. minimum (Figure 2A). Hybridization of an RNA blot of this gel with the 19-nt dinoflagellate SL probe DinoSLa/s (including 14 nt of SL and 5 nt of intron; Table 1) showed the dinoflagellate SL RNA pattern with major transcripts of <56 nt for the four dinoflagellates as reported previously [8], [9]; no hybridization was detected for the two Perkinsus species (Figure 2B). Probing the blot with P. marinus L-type or S-type SL probes (PmaSL-La/s and PmaSL-Sa/s respectively; Table 1), strong bands of >72 nt appeared in both Perkinsus species for both probes, with a minor band of slightly shorter length in the P. marinus sample for probe PmaSL-Sa/s; neither probe hybridized to dinoflagellate SL RNA (Figure 2C, 2D), indicating that the >72-nt bands are specific to the genus Perkinsus, and that Perkinsus SL RNAs are longer than those of typical dinoflagellates. Consistent with the similar RNA levels seen on the gel for the two Perkinsus species, probe PmaSL-La/s detected equivalent levels of this SL RNA variant (Figure 2C) in the two species. However, the band of P. chesapeaki was weaker than that of P. marinus with probe PmaSL-Sa/s (Figure 2D), possibly reflecting reduced expression or impaired hybridization due to a nucleotide alteration(s) in the exon region in P. chesapeaki. The minor band in the P. marinus lane may represent degraded SL RNA products. To further distinguish the two types of PmaSL RNA transcripts and to explore whether P. chesapeaki SL RNAs have similar introns to those of P. marinus, additional probes were designed for the PmaSLRNA L-type and S-type intron sequences (PmaSL-Li and PmaSL-Si; Table 1). Both intron probes revealed bands at >72 nt and some minor bands of <72 nt in P. marinus (Figure 2E, 2F), but no bands in P. chesapeaki, suggesting that P. chesapeaki SL RNAs have different intron sequences than P. marinus. An additional band appeared at \u223c150 nt with PmaSL-Si for both Perkinsus spp. (Figure 2F), a likely result of non-specific hybridization to the abundant 5.8S ribosomal RNA (Figure 2A). To validate the specificity of the probes, 3\u2032 RACE cDNA clones of the L- and S-type SL RNA were used to create dot blots that were hybridized separately with each probe. Each yielded a positive signal only when the corresponding probe was used (Figure 2G, 2H).",

In the structural simulation using the default conditions for all but temperature, which was adjusted to the culture temperature of 27\u00b0C, the splice-donor dinucleotide (\u2018gu\u2019 in \u2018Gguag\u2019) was double-stranded and the putative Sm-binding site (AUUCUGG/AUCUGG) single-stranded, forming a small terminal loop.

To be fully translatable without internal stop codons, however, frameshifts had to be introduced at every AGG and CCC codon, the equivalent of using AGGY to code for glycine (six sites in cob and 7\u20138 sites in cox1) and CCCCU for proline (twice in cox1) (Figures 4, 5). An analogous result was reported by Masuda et al. [20] for the P. marinus cox1. Multiple cDNAs and genomic sequences substantiated these unusual reading frames, as well as the direct sequencing of PCR products. An interesting difference was found between the two Perkinsus species: at one site in cox1, glycine was encoded by an AGGU codon in P. marinus, but by a standard GGU codon in P. chesapeaki (Figure 5). With the introduction of these invoked anomalous quadruplet and quintuplet codons, the deduced aa sequences of the two Perkinsus COX1 were 98% identical to each other, 46\u201350% similar to the homologs in apicomplexans, 42\u201349% to dinoflagellates, 29\u201331% to ciliates, and 38\u201342% to other organisms (Figure 6). For cob (Figure 4), besides the quadruplet codon AGGY, glycine was also encoded by the quintuplet codons UAGGC (for P. marinus) and UCGGU (for P. chesapeaki). After these adjustments, the deduced COB aa sequences of the two Perkinsus spp. shared 97% similarity to each other, 34\u201336% to apicomplexans, 22\u201344% to dinoflagellates, 15\u201317% to ciliates, 27\u201333% to other organisms (Figure 6).",

In general, P. marinus, dinoflagellates, apicomplexans, and ciliates formed a monophyletic group, while in several cases the heterokont diatoms, the closest relative of the alveolates, branched with some of the alveolate lineages, but without bootfostrap support. Perkinsus spp. allied with dinoflagellates in some cases (e.g. Figures S1C, 1F, S2E), and with apicomplexans (e.g. Figure S1D) or the diatoms (e.g. Figure S2D) in others, often with weak or no bootstrap support in these cases, indicating an unstable phylogenetic affinity. In contrast, NJ trees based on the 12 conserved protein sequences (actin, b-tubulin, GAPDH, \u03b1-tubulin, centrin, HSP90, EF1-\u03b1, ADP ribosylation factor, TIF5A, SmD1, cytochrome C and 14-3-3) produced similar tree topology, with P. marinus clustering with dinoflagellates in most of the cases (Figures S5, S6). For mt genes, Perkinsus spp. clustered with ciliates in COB tree, while allied with dinoflagellate/apicomplexan cluster in COX1 tree (Figure 6). When the concatenated RP sequence data (3,142 aa) was used, analyses using NJ, ML, and MB produced trees of similar topologies in which P. marinus branched at the base of the dinoflagellate clade (Figure 7). This was true for the analyses both without (Figure 7A) and with (Figure 7B) the ancient dinoflagellate lineage Oxyrrhis marina. The only exception was the MB tree in which P. marinus was allied with the clade of apicomplexans (Figure 7A). Similarly, when the other 12 protein sequences were concatenated (3,879 aa) the consensus tree inferred from the three algorithms showed the close relationship between P. marinus and dinoflagellates (Figure 7C). In most of these concatenated trees, the alliance of P. marinus and dinoflagellates was supported.",

The SL has left its footprints in other parts of the dinoflagellate genome in the form of single and tandem exon repeats located adjacent to the 5\u2032 UTRs of protein coding genes [28]. This apparently unproductive phenomenon is postulated to occur when SL-containing mRNA are reverse-transcribed and integrated to the genome [28] but could also be a result of chromosome cross-over recombination [16]. Likewise, SL exons in single or multiple units were found in some P. marinus genes.

The intron region of the SL RNA in dinoflagellates is conserved, but the similarities diminish in Amoebophrya, a parasitic lineage currently considered to represent the most ancient dinoflagellate [30]. SL RNAs in P. marinus display similar divergence from dinoflagellates, with a substantially longer intron relative to the core dinoflagellates and Amoebophrya, suggestive of an earlier divergence for P. marinus. The SL RNAs in other SL trans-splicing eukaryotes range from 46 nt in the urochordate Ciona intestinalis to 142 nt in Trypanosoma brucei. The SL RNA transcripts in P. marinus range from 80\u201383 nt, and are \u223c83 nt in P. chesapeaki. Thus, Perkinsus SL RNAs have unique features in comparison to dinoflagellates, and Perkinsus spp. may represent the earliest trans-splicing lineage within Alveolata, separated from the non-trans-splicing Ciliophora and Apicomplexa [8], yet distinct from the Dinoflagellata. Given the high diversity of the parasitic Syndiniales class of dinoflagellates [31], the uncharacterized marine alveolate group I that lies between Perkinsus and the core dinoflagellates ([7] and references therein) should be examined for the presence of additional types of SL RNA.",

The presence of SL RNA trans-splicing in Perkinsus spp. indicates its inclusion in or alliance with the phylum of dinoflagellates, in accord with previous molecular phylogenetic studies (e.g. [2]\u2013[4], [30]). Likewise, our multi-protein phylogenies consistently show that P. marinus is related to dinoflagellates among other representative eukaryotes with moderate-to-strong bootstrap support. Among the many single-gene phylogenetic trees, the majority is in agreement with the concatenated protein trees. In all trees, P. marinus was positioned as the earliest divergent even when Oxyrrhis, a genus hypothesized to be a pre-dinoflagellate [32] or an ancient lineage [12], was included.

Contrary to the long-held notion that dinoflagellates did not possess nucleosomes and canonical histones, genes of all four major histones have recently been found in dinoflagellates (for review see [21]); however, dinoflagellate histones usually have unique sequences with insertions/deletions in several places, resulting long branches in the phylogenetic trees (Figures 8, 9). Comparing to dinoflagellates, P. marinus histones have typical eukaryotic sequences and group with apicomplexans in the phylogenetic trees. Besides histone trees, some other individual protein trees (Figures S1D, S2A, 2B, 2C, S3B, S5C) also show an alliance of Perkinsus spp. with apicomplexans, in agreement with earlier morphological and cytological studies [2]. In rare cases, P. marinus is clustered with diatoms, apparently because the protein sequence was too short to provide strong support of any topology.",

            "text": "The unique reading frame shifting and the lack of mRNA editing for mt genes again mark P. marinus as distinct from typical dinoflagellates. Both P. marinus cob and cox1 mRNAs are identical to their genomic DNAs, indicating that no mRNA editing occurs to correct the frameshifts in these mt genes. Masuda et al. [20] reported the full-length mt cox1 mRNA from P. marinus, showing that this mRNA was not translatable with standard codon usage, due to a reading frame that had to be shifted a total of 10 times at every AGG and CCC codon to yield a consensus COX1 protein. One or two sites of +1 frameshifting have been documented in animal mt genes (for review, see [40]), but such extensive +1 and +2 frameshifts are unique. In retroviruses, a \u20131 frameshift is corrected by tRNA back-slippage over homopolymeric codons adjacent to a local secondary structure that may include a pseudoknot (for review, see [41]). Masuda et al. [20] suggest two feasible mechanisms for the translational frameshifts in Perkinsus: a ribosomal frameshift in which stalled ribosomes skip the first bases of these codons (similar to the model hypothesized by Beckenbach et al. [42]), or specialized tRNAs recognizing non-triplet codons AGGY and CCCCU to code for glycine and proline, respectively. In this study, we add cox1 for P. chesapeaki and cob sequences for P. marinus and P. chesapeaki, which share the unusual AGGY codon with cox1 and use other unusual codons (UAGGC and UCGGU) to encode glycine as well. Specialized tRNAs in the Perkinsus mitochondrial system recognizing non-triplet AGGY and CCCCU codons, and likely UMGGY as well, may be more likely than the ribosomal frameshifting scenario, as naturally occurring tRNA mutants suppress +1 frameshifts via an extended anticodon loop in Escherichia coli (e.g. [43]), and quadruplet codons are used in protein mutagenesis [44].",
