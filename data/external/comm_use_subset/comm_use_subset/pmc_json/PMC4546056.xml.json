For example, one did not include hospital data and thus is expected to have underestimated the burden of influenza [7], and others did not link hospital and general practice databases [8,9] or collect vaccination and risk status [8]. There is considerable disparity in estimates of influenza mortality derived from previous studies [10]. Furthermore, data are lacking on the burden of illness stratified by risk status, complication status (with or without complications of influenza recorded) or vaccination status. A recent review of cost-of-illness studies in influenza worldwide identified no UK studies reporting national cost-of-illness estimates, and only a few studies on the cost of influenza in specific population groups (children) [11]. Thus, although the burden of influenza in England has been shown to be substantial, accounting for 11,199 hospital admissions and 400 deaths annually in patients not in a clinical risk group, and 6,054 hospital admissions and 1,406 deaths annually in patients in a clinical risk group [9], it has not been described in sufficient detail.",

Over 117,000 such patients visited a GP and 534 were admitted to hospital in the study population, at an estimated cost of over \u00a34 million and over \u00a33 million, respectively. Scaled up to the whole UK population, this would be equivalent to over \u00a3168 million for GP visits and over \u00a3112 million for hospital admissions. This raises the possibility that mass annual vaccination could potentially have medical and economic benefits, by reducing the burden of influenza cases in individuals who are not in groups currently targeted for vaccination. Universal influenza vaccination was introduced in Ontario, Canada, in 2000 and has been associated with reductions in influenza-related mortality and healthcare use, compared with targeted vaccination programmes in other provinces [21]. It has been suggested that mass vaccination could be cost-saving in the USA [22].",

This pattern is well known [23], and is to be expected from current government policy, which targets elderly and/or high-risk groups for influenza vaccination. It is consistent with the observed pattern of higher resource use in vaccinated patients in the high-risk group in the present study; since vaccinated individuals were older and had more risk conditions than unvaccinated individuals, they are likely to have more fragile health and thus to need more healthcare. As vaccinated and unvaccinated groups are significantly different, outcomes cannot be directly compared and the data should be interpreted with caution. The only population in which vaccinated and unvaccinated groups could be compared is the sub-group aged 65 years and older, as according to current policy all individuals in this age group should receive seasonal influenza vaccination. Among this group, the ILI-related mortality rate among vaccinated individuals was 25% lower than the mortality rate among unvaccinated individuals. This is consistent with a protective effect of influenza vaccination. The effect size was similar to that reported by previous studies in this population group, which have reported reductions of 33\u201362% in hospitalisations, 27\u201339% in hospitalisations for acute and chronic respiratory illness and 39\u201354 in all-cause mortality [24\u201326].",

            "text": "Multivariate analysis indicated that patients categorised as high-risk had a disproportionate risk of hospitalisation. However, high-risk individuals who had also been vaccinated had a lower risk of hospitalisation than individuals who were high-risk alone. Similarly, patients who were high-risk had a higher probability of >1 GP visit, whereas patients who were high-risk and vaccinated had a lower probability of >1 GP visit. These findings suggest that vaccination may help to reduce the risk of hospitalisation and additional GP visits in high-risk groups. This demonstrates the clear benefit of vaccination of high-risk individuals and the rationale for ensuring that coverage in this group of individuals be reinforced, as coverage in those younger than 65 years is below target. Low vaccination coverage places individuals at risk of serious complications and death because they are not being vaccinated against influenza. However, although our results show clearly that vaccinated high-risk patients in the database had lower rates of additional GP visits and hospitalisations than unvaccinated high-risk patients in the database, there may be potential for confounding by differences in health-seeking behaviour that could not be captured in the database or accounted for in the analysis. For example, surveys in adults with asthma [27] and parents of high-risk children [28] at single UK GP practices have identified lack of awareness, barriers to access and health beliefs as factors influencing influenza vaccine uptake. Such factors could have the potential to confound our results if they also affect patients\u2019 readiness to seek treatment (for example, patients who wait until severe symptoms develop before presenting for medical attention may require higher levels of intervention than patients who present early). Our analysis would not be able to identify such potential confounding factors, and this is a limitation of the study. A recent case-control study using GPRD data in people at low risk for influenza in the UK found that influenza vaccination reduced the risk of influenza (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.60, 0.91) when given within 4 months before seasonal influenza outbreaks [29]. However, despite the authors\u2019 attempt to minimise confounding, they identified a residual confounding effect in that a group of people in the study with annual vaccinations in multiple years were also consistently more likely to develop influenza than those who received fewer annual vaccinations [29]. This may indicate that this group had predisposing medical conditions that made them simultaneously more likely to seek influenza vaccination and also at higher risk of influenza.",

The correlation coefficients show that for influenza B, deaths were more closely correlated with hospitalisations than hospitalisations with GP visits. For influenza A and other respiratory infections, hospitalisations were more closely correlated with GP visits than deaths with hospitalisation. The multivariate analysis also showed a statistically significant increase in the odds of hospitalisation in years with vaccine influenza B mismatch. In seasons with a mismatch between the vaccine lineage and the circulating influenza lineages, individuals may receive less clinical benefit from vaccination than anticipated, because the vaccine provides limited or no protection against the mismatched virus lineage. This suggests that improving vaccine protection against influenza B in mismatched years could be of value. Quadrivalent influenza vaccination provides protection against both influenza B lineages, which have started to co-circulate in recent years, and should therefore improve protection.",

It is possible that using the HPA data to attribute cases between the various respiratory viruses could over- or under-estimate the proportion of infections due to each pathogen, and this is a limitation of the study.",

This showed that although the patients had no secondary diagnosis codes (and were therefore classed as having no complications), they in fact had complications such as pneumonia or other respiratory manifestations.
