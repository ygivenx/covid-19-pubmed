Emerging and re-emerging viruses causing respiratory infections have been responsible for outbreaks resulting in millions of deaths. The pandemic influenza viruses of 1918, 1957 and 1968 are our bleak reminders. Since 1968, major outbreaks with mortalities on the scale previously seen have not occurred, although there have been regular threats.",

            "text": "Recently, a novel coronavirus has been identified in patients with severe acute respiratory illness [1,2]. This new virus, provisionally referred to as novel coronavirus (NCoV) has been fully sequenced and shown to belong to group C \u03b2-coronaviruses [3-5]. The genome, which is just over 30 KB, contains at least 10 predicted open reading frames (ORFs) [4]. The genome size, organization and sequence analysis revealed that the NCoV is most closely related to bat coronaviruses BtCoV-HKU4 and BtCoV-HKU5 [3-5] first isolated in 2006 from bats captured in Hong Kong [6]. The major difference between NCoV and these bat coronaviruses is in the region between the spike and the envelop genes [5]. The NCoV has 5 ORFs while the bat viruses have 4 in this region [5]. The nearest human coronavirus related to NCoV is SARS-CoV [3-5]. This virus was responsible for the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2002\u20132003 which resulted in 8,422 cases worldwide with 916 deaths [7]. With a mortality of approximately 11% seen with SARS-CoV infection, the identification of NCoV from patients with similar acute respiratory illness as with SARS-CoV is of a real concern. Coronaviruses are a large family of enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses that infect a number of different species, including humans. They are usually species specific, however interspecies transmission of coronaviruses can occur [8-10]. Worryingly, in vitro studies show that NCoV is also capable of infecting cells from different species, including monkeys, humans, bats and pigs [2,11]. Indeed, NCoV was first isolated using monkey kidney epithelial cell lines, Vero and LLC-MK20, both of which are susceptible to infection and can propagate the virus relatively easily [2]. Prior to the isolation of NCoV, only five coronaviruses, namely 229E, OC43, SARS-CoV, HKU1 and NL63, were known to cause infections in humans [12]. In the absence of any underlying co-morbidities, all of these coronaviruses, except for SARS-CoV, are generally associated with mild upper respiratory tract infections. SARS-CoV has an unusual predilection for infecting cells in the lower respiratory tract. Although NCoV also causes lower respiratory tract infection, the viral receptor appears to be different from that used by SARS-CoV [11,13].",

The Qatari man was initially admitted to a hospital in Doha in October with severe respiratory illness, but he was subsequently transferred to a hospital in Germany. Laboratory results confirmed that he was positive for the novel coronavirus. He remained in hospital for approximately a month, but he recovered from his respiratory and renal illness and was discharged in the week of 18th November. The Saudi cases (cases 6 and 7) (Figure 1) are of particular interest as these were from a single family and were related to case 4 [22]. All 3 cases lived in the same house [24] and it is believed that case 4, a 70-year old man, was the index case in this cluster. He is thought to have infected two of his sons, one of whom (case 6) subsequently died of multi-organ failure. A fourth case from this family also presented with similar symptoms, but laboratory tests revealed that it was not due to the novel coronavirus [24].",

Furthermore, the fact that the NCoV is most closely related to bat coronaviruses [3-5] indicates that it might have originated from bats. Studies showing that SARS-CoV was most likely to have derived from bats [33] also supports a zoonotic origin for this new coronavirus. However, it is unknown whether the NCoV was transmitted to humans by a direct interspecies jump or it involved another intermediary animal. In the case of SARS-CoV, civet cats were identified as a likely intermediate host [8,9,33]. Like SARS-CoV, the exact natural reservoir species of the NCoV also remains to be identified.",

The two clusters of cases, one from a family in Saudi Arabia, the other from a healthcare team at a hospital in Jordan and the most recent UK cluster of cases certainly suggests that human-to-human transmission is very likely. In the family cluster, 3 members contracted the infection. The index case is thought to be a 70-year old grandfather admitted to a hospital in Riyadh with severe respiratory illness. His two sons took in turns to stay by him during his illness (Dr Ziad Memish, personal communication). In spite of all supportive care, the patient died of renal failure. Both of his sons subsequently also contracted the infection and one of them died of multi-organ failure some days later. In the Jordanian cluster, 11 cases (7 nurses and 1 doctor) presented with an acute respiratory illness of unknown aetiology in April 2012 [25]. Two of the cases subsequently died. Retrospective testing confirmed both cases to be positive for the NCoV [34]. Investigations of the non-fatal unconfirmed probable cases in this cluster revealed that the illness in these cases was generally mild [24]. Indeed, in one case, the symptoms were mild enough to be managed at home. The cases in both, the Saudi and Jordanian cluster had no reported contact with animals. Similarly, the most recent laboratory confirmed cases from UK (cases 11 and 12), also had no contact with animals or any history of travel to the Middle East. Both appear to have contracted the infection from a family member who had recently returned from Saudi Arabia [30]. Together, these anecdotal observations clearly indicate that person-to-person infection, probably via respiratory mode of transmission, is highly plausible.",

The latter presentation has not been seen in all patients. For examples, none of the cases in the Jordanian cluster had renal failure [24]. The two fatal cases in this cluster, one developed pericarditis and the other had disseminated intravascular coagulation [24]. Coronaviruses predominantly cause mild self-limiting upper respiratory tract infections. The only other human coronavirus that is associated with severe lower respiratory infection is SARS-CoV [35]. However, in contrast to SARS-CoV [36,37], this novel coronavirus does not appear to cause diarrhea. Of 12 laboratory confirmed cases, 6 have died and 1 is currently in ICU. This would imply a relatively high mortality rate. However, caution has to be exercised, since we do not know the true prevalence of infection with NCoV. It is possible that in some cases, the virus is associated with mild respiratory tract infection which goes unseen and only those patients who develop severe disease seek medical attention.

Viral induced cytopathic changes are seen in these cells within 1\u20132 weeks of infection [2]. However, these changes are not specific for NCoV and confirmation using reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) is required. RT-PCR can also be performed directly on clinical samples such as respiratory swabs. An optimized real-time RT-PCR protocol for the specific detection of NCoV has been developed and is available [1]. Furthermore, an additional confirmatory RT-PCR assay and a serological test using convalescent patient serum has been established [38].",

A rapid response, a united global front and mobilization of resources and expertise are our best tools in preventing or reducing the devastation that some of these viruses can cause. This is exemplified by the recent events that have led to the recognition and isolation of the novel coronavirus responsible for acute respiratory illness. Within weeks of the first report, a PCR-based diagnostic assay was made available [1], a preliminary case definition [39] and incubation period was issued [40], the virus was fully sequenced [4], the detection of new cases was rapidly communicated to the health authorities and more recently, guidelines for handling and working with this virus have been issued [24]. The novel coronavirus is the 6th member of the human coronaviruses and the third to be isolated in the last ten years. Based on current information, NCoV does not appear to transmit easily or sustainably between people, but it can lead to serious lower respiratory tract infection and renal failure. The mode of transmission has not been conclusively identified, although respiratory route looks most likely. A study which is in press, has shown that a number of different bat species resident in Ghana and parts of Europe are infected with coronaviruses very similar to NCoV, in some cases differing by less than 2% at the genetic level [41]. These findings suggest that NCoV is most likely to have arisen from bat viruses. However, a number of pertinent questions remain unanswered: Does NCoV represent an interspecies jump of a bat coronavirus? How did humans acquired the infection? Was it a direct infection from bats to humans or did it involve an intermediate host such as domestic animals? Are the virus isolates from all infected persons genetically identical? Do NCoV genetic variants exits in the human population, but cause mild or asymptomatic infections? Future studies will no doubt attempt to address these and other related questions. For the time being, surveillance and thorough investigations of cases with unexplained severe respiratory illness, particularly in those residing in or returning from Middle East, is being recommended [24].",
