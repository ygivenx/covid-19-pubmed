[3] Recently, the emergence of the novel 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus and the SARS coronavirus have demonstrated how rapidly pathogens can spread worldwide. [4] This infectious disease threat, combined with a concern over man-made biological or chemical events, spurred WHO to update their International Health Regulations (IHR) in 2005. [5] The new 2005 IHR, a legally binding instrument for all 194 WHO member countries, significantly expanded the scope of reportable conditions and are intended to help prevent and respond to global public health threats.

[6], [7] Such systems have become versatile tools in health departments in the United States. [8] Epidemiologists using electronic disease surveillance not only have the potential to detect anomalous disease activity earlier than traditional laboratory-based surveillance, but they also have the ability to monitor the health of their community in the face of a known threat. [9], [10], [11] More than a decade ago, in collaboration with the US Department of Defense (DoD), the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) developed the Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community-based Epidemics (ESSENCE). ESSENCE collects, processes, and analyzes non-traditional data sources (i.e. chief complaints from hospital emergency departments, school absentee data, poison control center calls, over-the-counter pharmaceutical sales, etc) to identify anomalous disease activity in a community. The data can be queried, analyzed, and visualized both temporally and spatially by the end user. [10] ESSENCE is currently being utilized by the US Department of Defense, US Veterans Health Administration, and numerous state and local health departments in the US. [11]\n",

The approach should allow customizable data collection, enable multiple data streams collected in different ways, and be scalable based upon needs. [6], [7] Data collection tools included within SAGES are web forms, short message service texting programs, digital logbooks, and interactive voice response systems. Data entered into SAGES can be validated by the stakeholder. Where appropriate, other collection methods such as email and secure file transfer protocol can be applied as well. The data acquisition methods in SAGES are readily adaptable to evolving standards in both minimum data sets for disease surveillance and routine diagnosis and care.",

[17] Only those diseases with the highest burdens on the population should be followed and surveillance systems should be periodically evaluated to determine their usefulness. [17], [18], [19] At this time, SAGES does not include tools for the automated evaluation of surveillance systems. Several authors have described the evaluation of electronic disease surveillance systems. [9], [17], [18], [19], [20] We intend to perform such evaluations of SAGES surveillance systems and investigate the feasibility of developing automated evaluation tools in the future.",

The Peruvian system uses IVR technology for data collection. The phone calls needed for IVR are very expensive in the Philippines while SMS text messages cost very little. With that in mind, an existing paper-based fever surveillance system was modified to allow basic information (age, sex, clinic, and symptoms) on patients presenting with fever to be sent to the health department daily via SMS using a standardized texting protocol and abbreviations. The SMS messages are received by a cell phone attached to a computer located at the health department and routed through a simple data cleansing program that sequesters records with incorrect formatting and sends a standard text message to the sender asking them to resend the data. The correctly formatted messages are copied to a database that is then analyzed in EDE. Some clinics quickly adapted to the SMS protocol, while others have found it more difficult to send error-free messages. The percent error decreased over time (Figure 6) suggesting that, with constructive help, most clinics were able to become proficient with the SMS protocol. As of January 2011, approximately 50% of eligible districts are sending daily fever information via text, and the data are being regularly reviewed in EDE. The remaining districts continue to send paper reports or report by phone. The primary reasons given for not using the SMS protocol were lack of personnel or discomfort sending SMS text messages. Focused, repeated training also helped some clinics get started.",

Assuring the smooth interoperability of all software components is sometimes difficult, as is balancing functionality with simplicity for sites with minimal infrastructure. Additionally, finding the appropriate person or group within a country to champion the implementation of a new surveillance system can be fraught with financial, political, territorial challenges. Finally, the open source nature of the software inherently has the consequence of a lack of control of modifications to the software after it is released, potentially leading to incompatible and unverified versions. Conversely, if these changes can be shared in a Wiki-like environment, the entire community using SAGES may benefit from novel improvements.",
