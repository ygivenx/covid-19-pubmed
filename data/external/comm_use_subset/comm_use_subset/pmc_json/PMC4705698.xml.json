There are three types of Influenza viruses A, B and C [2] that have different structural arrangements of internal nucleoprotein and matrix protein antigens.

In the 2012\u20132013 season FLUA and FLUB were detected in similar proportions. In Europe, the FLUA epidemic was primarily caused by the H1N1 subtype, which outnumbered the H3N2 subtype by in ratio 2:1. The FLUB epidemic was driven by the B/Yamagata lineage, which was more prevalent than the B/Victoria lineage by a ratio of 5:1 [11].

Among the patients who tested positive for FLUA, 33/62 were female and 29/62 male, while for the FLUB patients 25/71 were female and 46/71 male (p = 0.320). All patients involved were between 0 and 16 years old. The highest number of cases of FLUA/H1N1 was observed in children less than 1 year of age.

Males seemed to be more susceptible to contracting FLU compared to females and, specifically, FLUB. This is concordant with previous studies in which the greater humoral and cell-mediated immune responses of females to viral antigens was demonstrated to play an important role in determining the gender variability in viral infections and, in females, being beneficial against infectious diseases [19]. With regard to the age distribution, FLUA was more common in children less than 1 year old, where they can cause more severe infections, confirming previous studies [20, 21], and FLUB was more common in school age children.",

Specifically, this long hospital stay (59 and 116 days) was, for FLUA, in a patient with complications due to tracheostomy procedure, while for FLUB a nosocomial infection occurred in a oncoematological patient. This finding is unsual since that in a previuos study children with influenza B in comparison with those infected by A/H1N1 influenza virus had significantly higher hospitalization rates (p < 0.05) [20]. Is possible to speculate that the longer hospitalization for FLUA patients be correlated to the major cases with fever >38 \u00b0C and respiratory simptoms. No significant differences were observed in CRP levels between FLUA and B patients and a similar frequency of patients with elevated CRP was detected in both FLUA and B. Fever was confirmed as a major influenza symptom [21, 22]. A similar number of FLUA and FLUB patients presented with a temperature \u226538\u00b0. However, FLUB patients were significantly more likely to have a fever <38 \u00b0C than FLUA patients. In contrast, respiratory symptoms were mainly detected in FLUA patients (Table 1). Pre-existing diseases condition the clinical expression of Influenza resulting in a greater number of these children developing lower respiratory tract infection [23]. We found that FLU patients with underlying malignancies such as lymphoma, leukemia, solid tumor, or tubulopathy, were more susceptible to FLUB infection, in agreement with data previously reported [24]. In contrast, patients with congenital diseases (hypoplastic left heart syndrome, neuromotor disorder, Swyer James syndrome, epilepsy, cerebral palsy, laryngotracheal cleft, or immune deficiency) and genetic preexisting conditions (cystic fibrosis, sickle-cell anemia, trisomy of chromosome 10, or Niemann Pick disease) were more susceptible to FLUA infection. This is probably related to FLUA patients younger than those with FLUB. In our study, 12/133 (9.02 %) of FLU infections were hospital acquired with FLUB being the principal etiological agent responsible. Patients that contracted nosocomial infections were mainly immunosuppressed and admitted through the IIFU (8 cases FLUB), followed by the pediatrics (2 cases FLUB and 1 FLUA) and surgery (1 case FLUA) units. Numerous examples of nosocomial FLU outbreaks have been reported in long-term care facilities for the elderly. Experimental evidences supports the fact that humans generate infectious particles in both respiratory droplets and aerosols and that their generation is enhanced during influenza illness [25]. Moreover, children, who do not have or minimal immunity against influenza viruses, and immunocompromised individuals, who can shed virus for long periods of time at high titers, have already been pinpointed as good transmitters in comparison to healthy adults. However, it is unclear why FLUB, in comparison to FLUA, should cause a more severe infection in the group of immunosuppressed and moreover, in the population object of the study, the number of patients with malignancies is low and it is difficult to establish if the difference is really significant.",
