            "text": "Astroviruses are currently classified into two genera, Mamastroviruses (MAstVs) and Avastroviruses (AAstVs)1. MAstVs mainly infect mammals including human, ovine, bovine, porcine, feline, canine, mink, bat, deer, mouse, sea lion, dolphin etc., whereas AAstVs generally infect aviansuch as turkey, chicken, duck, pigeon, and goose1,2. Notably, genetic variation and cross-species transmission of astrovirusespose the risk for zoonotic infection2,3. Infection with astroviruses mainly cause enteric diseases such as gastroenteritis and diarrhea in human and animals as reported initially, then nephritis in chicken and pigeon, hepatitis in ducklings, and encephalitis in human, cattle, and sheep recently, which broadens the disease pattern of astroviruses and highlights its significance2,4\u20136. In 2015, a gout disease emerged in 1-week-old goslings in Anhui province, which had spread to most provinces of China by 2017 with high morbidity (80\u201390%) and mortality (20\u201370%), and no pathogenic bacteria could be isolated from the diseased goslings. However, little is known about the pathogen for the goose gout disease endemic in goose flocks in China. During 2011\u20132012, the outbreaks of gout disease were reported in broilers in India. Through virus isolation and infection study, Bulbule et al. demonstrated that a novel chicken astrovirus (CAstV) could be as one of the causative agents for the gout disease in chicken flocks in India7. To control the spread of the goose gout disease, we investigated the pathogenic agent of the disease. Through in vitro and in vivo experiments, we identified and isolated a novel goose astrovirus different from the CAstVas a causative agent of the gout disease recently circulating in gosling flocks in China.",

At necropsy, kidney enlargement and intensive urate deposits were found in the gallbladder, knees, and ureters, and on the surfaces of cardiac, heart, liver, air sacs, trachea, and proventriculus (Fig. 1a\u2013f).

PCR/RT-PCR was performed using specific primers listed in Table 1 to detect viral nucleic acids. Except for a 434 bp band amplified from all samples (n = 30) by a pair of degenerate primers to ORF1b gene of avian astrovirus, negative results for the other viruses were demonstrated. However, the samples (n = 5) detected from the healthy goslings without gout disease, provided by National water fowl gene bank, Taizhou, China, were negative by RT-PCR in avian astrovirus detection. The 10 amplicons from the 10 flocks respectively designated as AHLA, AHDY, FJZA, GDHZ, JSXZ, JSGY, JSDY, JSYZ, SDJM, and SDLJ, were sequenced directly for homology analysis. Results indicated the 10 sequences of the PCR products were highly consistent (\u00e5 99%), but had <70% homology with those deposited in GenBank. Furthermore, the sequences detected shared only 60.2\u201362% homology with the astrovirus FLX (NC_034567) recently identified in goose with enteritis from China8.",

Sequencing data showed that the viral RNA genome was 7183 nt in length (GenBank accession no. MG934571) with a typical genome structure of astroviruses8,9. Between the 18-nt 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) and 236-nt 3\u2032 UTR, three open reading frames (ORFs) were predicted, including 3225-nt ORF1a, 1287-nt ORF1b, and 2115-nt ORF2. A potential ribosomal frameshift signal (AAAAAAC) was identified downstream of ORF1a, followed by a UAG stop codon. As expected, the conserved CCGAA motif of astroviruses was found between ORF1b and ORF2. Sequence alignment of the RNA genome showed <60.8% homology with other AAstVs. To gain further insight into the evolutionary relationship of the virus with other AAstVs, phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the sequences of ORF2. The novel astrovirus formed a distinct clade in Avastroviruses 3 including TAstV-2 (AAF18464), TAstV-2 AK/98 (ABX46566), and DAstV-3 C-NGB (ACN82429) as described in Fig. 2. Recombinant analysis was conducted among all the genomes of astroviruses deposited in Genbank, and the results demonstrated no recombinant event happened in the viral genomic sequence.",

To further confirm the isolation of the virus, the infected LMH cells were analyzed through indirect fluorescent assay (IFA) using the convalescent sera from the survival geese with gout symptom and the mouse sera against the capsid P2 of GD (generated in our laboratory) respectively. As described in Fig. 3, the specific fluorescent signals could be found in the cytoplasm of the LMH cells infected with GD, but not in the control LMH cells. Notably, there was no cytopathic effect found in infected LMH cells. Moreover, GD virus could be efficiently neutralized by the convalescent sera from the survival goose with gout disease, and the neutralization titer of the goose convalescent sera against GD reached 1:3200, however, the sera from healthy geese did not show any neutralization activity, which highlighted the association between the novel goose astrovirus and the gosling gout disease.

In this study, a novel goose astroviruses GD was identified and isolated from goslings with gout symptom. The infection study further confirmed that the GD belonging to Avastroviruses 3 could be the causative agent of the ongoing gosling gout disease in China. Although CAstVs could induce gout disease in chickens7, CAstVs have only about 35.1\u201335.8% homology with GD on amino acid sequence of capsid, and there is no recombinant event happened between them, which indicate that the GD is an under recognized novel astrovirus. In comparison with the goose astrovirus recently identified in geese with enteritis in China8, the novel goose astrovirus showed only about 60% identity in nucleic acid.

The high morbility and low mortality for the infection study with GD might be related with the infection route and dose, and the age. Although the pathogens including fowl adenovirus, goose hemorrhagic polyomavirus, goose reovirus, goose coronavirus, goose parvovirus, and duck Tembusu virus were not able to be detected in the diseased goslings, we could not exclude the potential co-infections with other pathogens, which may exacerbate the clinical symptoms of gout. In addition, whether the high protein level in the feed promotes the occurrence of gout also need to be further investigated. The high-titer neutralizing antibody to GD from the survival geese highlighted the novel goose astrovirus could efficiently induce enough adapt immunity in goslings. However, whether this adapt immunity can protect goslings completely from the novel goose astrovirus need to be further studied.",

Moser et al. reported that astroviruses could increase the permeability of the epithelial cells18. The increased permeability of the kidney epithelial cells induced by the astroviruses might contribute to the gout disease7. In addition, due to lacking arginase in poultry, ammonia cannot be processed into urea instead of purine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine, then oxidized to uric acid, forming sodium urate and calcium urate, excreted through kidney finally. If the rate of urate formation is greater than the excretory capacity of the urinary organs, gout can be caused with the urate deposits on visceral surfaces19. Therefore, factors that cause renal and urinary tract injury or urine concentration and urinary excretion disorder can promote the formation of urate deposits. In this study, the novel astrovirus GD could cause kidney damage, which maybe the main cause of gosling gout in China.",

The specific sequences of the astroviruses detected in samples from the five different provinces demonstrated the widespread of the novel goose astroviruses in China. However most astrovirusesare difficult to grow in cell culture20, the novel goose astrovirus GD could be isolated efficiently in LMH cells in this study, which provides an efficient proliferation system for the avastrovirus in vitro. This efficient system might provide a good tool for developing inactivated vaccine and investigating the pathogenicity mechanism of goose astrovirus in the future. The full genomic RNA of the novel goose astrovirus was sequenced and publicated in Genbank,which pave ways for further developing vaccines and diagnostic methodsin controlling the gout disease in goslings. During the preparation of the revised version for this manuscript, other groups in China recently also reported the novel goose astrovirus21\u201323. Different from those recently reported by other groups, we efficiently isolate such novel goose astrovirus in vitro using the cell culture system (LMH cells) and reproduce the associated gout disease by inoculating the cell cultured virus GD. Of course, the originator, host range, variation, molecular pathogenesis, and potential zoonotic infection of the novel goose astrovirus need to be further studied.",
