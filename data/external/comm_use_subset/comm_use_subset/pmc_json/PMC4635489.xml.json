In human populations, polyomavirus seroprevalence can reach up to 90 % and most infections are asymptomatic (Van Ghelue et al., 2012). However, in immunocompromised individuals infection can cause an array of symptoms, including Merkel cell carcinoma, kidney disease and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (Imperiale & Major, 2007). Although renal and respiratory diseases, tumours, and wasting have been reported in some other animals, the consequences of polyomavirus infection in many non-human species remain to be determined.",

            "text": "All identified polyomaviruses share a similar genome organization and virion structure. Polyomaviruses typically exhibit a 40\u201345 nm diameter non-enveloped icosahedral capsid, composed of 72 monomers (Baker et al., 1989; Imperiale & Major, 2007). The capsid encloses a single, circular dsDNA genome of ~5000 bp (Johne et al., 2011). All polyomavirus genomes are composed of early and late regions, and regulatory regions called the non-coding control region (NCCR) (Imperiale & Major, 2007). The NCCR contains the origin of replication, transcription factor binding sites, promoters and enhancers. Transcription from the NCCR is bidirectional, producing mRNA encoding either early proteins or late proteins (Johne et al., 2011). All polyomaviruses produce at least two early mRNA products encoding large and small tumour antigens (LT-Ag and St-Ag, respectively) (Imperiale & Major, 2007). These proteins are involved in viral genome replication and modulation of host cell conditions required for virus replication (Stevens et al., 2013). The mouse and hamster polyomaviruses also encode a middle tumour antigen (MT-Ag) (Imperiale & Major, 2007). Recently, an alternate reading frame gene (called ALTO) overlapping the LT-Ag gene was identified in Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) and predicted to occur in polyomaviruses that are phylogenetically related to MCPyV (Carter et al., 2013). Late polyomavirus mRNA transcripts encode capsid proteins (typically VP1, VP2 and VP3) (Imperiale & Major, 2007; Johne et al., 2011). Several mammalian polyomaviruses (Fig. 1) also encode an agnoprotein or other short proteins between the NCCR and the VP2 ORF (Johne et al., 2011). Agnoproteins are involved in the control of viral protein expression and have effects throughout the viral life cycle (Gerits & Moens, 2012).",

Understanding the evolutionary history of viral families can help define the propensity of viruses to switch host species. However, little is known about the evolutionary history of polyomaviruses or their capacity for host switching. In an early phylogenetic study (Shadan & Villarreal, 1993), the similarity of mammalian and polyomavirus evolutionary trees led to the suggestion that polyomaviruses had co-evolved with their host species. This idea evolved to incorporate a combination of host-switching and virus\u2013host co-divergence events (notably, the basal split between avian and mammalian polyomaviruses) (P\u00e9rez-Losada et al., 2006). However, recent statistical re-evaluation that incorporated novel polyomaviruses from a wider range of taxa has largely rejected the hypothesis of polyomavirus\u2013host co-divergence (Krumbholz et al., 2009; Warden & Lacey, 2012).",

            "text": "In the absence of evidence for co-divergence, alternative models have been proposed to explain the phylogenetic distribution of polyomavirus host species. In the first model, cross-species transmission of polyomaviruses is proposed to be a relatively common evolutionary event (Tao et al., 2013). This hypothesis has consequences for human and animal health, and raises the question of what factors determine the rate of virus transmission between species (Streicker et al., 2010). In the second model, the polyomavirus phylogeny is proposed to result from recombination amongst polyomaviruses, which results in the appearance of host species switching. A recent study found support for recombination of several polyomaviruses, yet was unable to identify ancestors of the putative recombinant lineages with certainty (Tao et al., 2013). In a third model, heterogeneity in the evolutionary rates of different genes amongst the polyomavirus lineages is used to explain their complex evolutionary history (Tao et al., 2013).",

To establish conclusively that MmelPyV1 occurrs in badgers, uncultured samples from wild badgers in France were tested in an independent laboratory for the presence of the virus. Diagnostic PCRs targeting VP1 and the NCCR were performed on faecal samples and seven different tissues from 11 different badgers to determine prevalence. Eight badgers (73 %) showed evidence of polyomavirus infection. PCR results were positive at least once in all sample types, except faecal samples which were all negative (Tables S1 and S2, available in the online Supplementary Material). Overall, 21 of 87 (24 %) samples were positive for MmelPyV1. Samples from liver and lymph nodes exhibited the highest rate of positivity. Neither VP1 nor the NCCR showed any sequence variability across the wild badger samples. Long-distance nested PCRs were used on one sample to generate an amplified genome, which was then sequenced. This generated a further polyomavirus isolate, referred to here as the MmelPyV1 French isolate (GenBank accession number KP644238).",

A 53 aa ORF was identified overprinting the LT-Ag exon 2 in a frameshift position, in a similar genome position to the previously proposed ALTO gene (Carter et al., 2013). However, MmelPyV1 is phylogenetically distinct from the clade of ALTO-containing polyomaviruses (Fig. 1) and the ORF is considerably shorter than identified ALTO proteins (53 aa compared with 248\u2013250 aa; Carter et al., 2013). Consequently, this ORF is unlikely to represent an ALTO gene. After searching for ORFs that were (i) conserved between the two MmelPyV1 isolate genomes, (ii) >30 aa long (corresponding to the shortest proposed current agnoprotein; Misra et al., 2009) and (iii) located in the forward direction upstream of the VP2 start codon, we found no evidence of an agnoprotein ORF. We discovered one ORF >100 aa long in MmelPyV1 (location indicated by grey box in Fig. 4). This ORF does not have sequence identity with any known polyomavirus proteins, and is not conserved between MmelPyV1 and the closely related CSLPyV1, so is unlikely to represent a protein-encoding ORF.",

Analyses using BaTS (Parker et al., 2008) showed significant support for preferential clustering of polyomaviruses from more similar hosts (Table 1). Although previous analyses have ruled out strict viral-host co-divergence during polyomavirus evolution (Krumbholz et al., 2009; Tao et al., 2013; Warden & Lacey, 2012), this is not inconsistent with the fact that more phylogenetically related polyomaviruses are isolated from more similar hosts than expected by chance. Instead, the evolutionary history of cross-species transmission in the polyomaviruses is likely to result from the interplay of multiple factors, such as preferential host switching amongst related hosts, viral\u2013host co-divergence and host species sympatry (e.g. Charleston & Robertson, 2002; Streicker et al., 2010). Understanding the evolutionary history is complicated by the fact that some polyomaviruses have been isolated from captive animals rather than from animals living within their natural host ranges (e.g. Scuda et al., 2013). It is possible that animals living in artificially close proximity may share pathogens more frequently than in the wild. Furthermore, such cross-species transmissions may be more likely to cause disease symptoms that are subsequently investigated and identified as caused by novel viruses.",

The polyomavirus NCCR is the most variable genome region, both within and across virus species (De Gascun & Carr, 2013). The recent divergence of the French and UK isolates is supported by a deficit of genetic differences in the NCCR. The substitution rate we employed is, to our knowledge, the only published rate derived from longitudinal sampling of polyomavirus genomes. There are caveats to the rate used here. First, Firth et al. (2010) noted that the BK polyomavirus dataset they analysed contained comparatively weak temporal structure, hence their estimated evolutionary rate may be poorly resolved. Second, BK polyomavirus is not closely related to MmelPyV1 (especially in the late region; Fig. 5a) and the extrapolation of evolutionary rates across different viral species may lead to errors in estimates of divergence times.",

Four human polyomaviruses (HPyV6, HPyV7, WU and KI) were placed in different phylogenetic positions depending on the genome region analysed (Fig. 5). Although this result may be compatible with a recombinant origin for this clade, it is known that distinguishing between genetic signatures of recombination and lineage-specific variation in evolutionary rate is difficult. Tao et al. (2013) reported significant evolutionary rate heterogeneity between the early and late regions in the HPyV6, HPyV7, WU and KI polyomaviruses, but observed no such heterogeneity in other polyomaviruses (Tao et al., 2013). The ability of such rate heterogeneity to generate apparent signatures of recombination has been noted for other viruses, including influenza virus (Worobey et al., 2002). These observations, plus the observation that genetic distances and bootstrap support values are generally lower in the early region phylogeny (Fig. 5b), suggest that rate variation may be the more likely explanation for phylogenetic incongruence in the mammalian polyomaviruses.",

Phylogenetic trees were estimated from each partition using the maximum-likelihood approach detailed above (except that two heuristic searches and 200 bootstrap replicates were performed for each partition). Visual inspection of these trees revealed phylogenetic inconsistencies between genome regions. Subsequently, one species was chosen randomly from every monophyletic clade that was present in all 12 partition phylogenies. Sixteen clades that were well supported in the whole-genome phylogeny were identified (15 clades supported by bootstrap support values of 100 % and one clade by 91 %). Ten species that did not belong to any clade were also included in the analysis, resulting in a reduced alignment of 26 polyomavirus species. These 26 taxa were analysed using Recco (Maydt & Lengauer, 2006) to seek evidence of recombination. Recco attempts to find the minimum cost of reconstructing each sequence in an alignment from a combination of recombination and mutation of the other sequences, where recombination and mutation have a cost penalty (Maydt & Lengauer, 2006). Probable recombination breakpoints were generated based on the minimum-cost solutions. To further investigate potential recombinants, putative recombination breakpoints were used to define new genomic partitions and maximum-likelihood phylogenies were again estimated from each partition.",
