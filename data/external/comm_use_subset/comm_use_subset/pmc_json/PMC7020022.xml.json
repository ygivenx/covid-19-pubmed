Over the past four decades several oral rabies vaccines, mainly live replication-competent attenuated rabies virus vaccines, have been successfully used in ORV campaigns [4]. In Canada for example, the ERA-BHK21vaccine virus strain, a derivative of the cell culture adapted vaccine virus strain Street Alabama Dufferin (SAD) [5,6], was the only live attenuated vaccine deployed in fox ORV campaigns [7]. In Europe, with the exception of a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the rabies virus glycoprotein, all constructs have been based on live attenuated rabies virus strains [4], derived from the SAD Bern original (SAD Bernorig) vaccine virus strain, a successor of the ERA strain [2,8]. While all these vaccines have been highly efficient in fox rabies control, the first generation of SAD-derived vaccines demonstrated residual pathogenicity in non-target species particularly in rodents [9,10,11,12]. Although several cases of vaccine virus-induced rabies were observed even in species other than rodents over the course of vaccination campaigns in a number of countries, including Germany [1], Austria [1], Slovenia, Romania [13], Poland, and Canada [7], such cases were without epidemiological relevance [1,7,8].",

Briefly, for sample disintegration prior to nucleic acid extraction, 20 mg tissue material or 200 \u00b5L of the vaccine virus preparation from the blister were cryofractured using the cryoPREP CP02 (Covaris, Brighton, United Kingdom). The pulverized material was lysed with pre-heated (56 \u00b0C) buffer AL (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). A threefold volume of Trizol was added and RNA extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) followed by on-column DNase I digestion (Qiagen). Subsequently, the obtained RNA was converted into double stranded cDNA using a combination of SuperScript\u2122 IV First-Strand cDNA Synthesis System (Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and NEBNext\u00ae Ultra\u2122 II Non-Directional RNA Second Strand Synthesis Module (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). The generated cDNA was fragmented using the Covaris M220 (Covaris) and subsequently converted to Ion Torrent compatible libraries using the GeneRead L Core Kit (Qiagen) and IonXpress Barcode Adaptors (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) followed by size selection as described [16]. After quality control (Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer; High Sensitivity DNA Kit, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and quantification (KAPA Library Quantification Kit\u2014Ion Torrent PGM Uni; KAPA Biosystems/Roche, Basel, Switzerland), the libraries including the Ion S5 Calibration Standard were sequenced on an Ion 530 chip with an Ion S5 XL System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 400 bp-mode according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.",

In short, RNA was prepared using a protocol combining Trizol and a semi-automated MagMax\u2122 (Applied Biosystems/Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) extraction system. Subsequently, dsDNA for input into library preparation was generated by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), yielding overlapping amplicons of the RABV genome (Tables S1 and S2, Supplementary File). The generated amplicons were individually quantified for each sample utilizing a Qubit fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scientific) and pooled equimolarly followed by library generation using the Nextera XT kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Sequencing was performed with an Illumina MiSeq instrument generating 250 base paired end reads.",

All sequence reads were mapped along a strict majority consensus sequence and its reverse complement (454 Sequencing System Software v3.0; Roche) that was previously generated and introduced via a MAFFT (multiple sequence alignment using fast Fourier transform) alignment of published SAD-related sequences [15]. Using R (version 3.6.0) and RStudio (version 1.2.1335) in combination with additional packages (Table 3), base frequencies of the forward and reverse mapping were calculated for each position of the reference sequence. Subsequently, the data were corrected for strand-bias and pairwise Manhattan distances were calculated for each population. After non-linear multidimensional scaling, the distances were displayed in 2-dimensional plots [15]. For reasons of simplification, previously sequenced in vitro selected attenuated rabies vaccine strains, i.e., P5/88, VA1, SAG2, SAD B19CS, and SAD B19P1 (Table S3, Supplementary File), were excluded to achieve a more convenient presentation of the SAD Bernorig-derived vaccine-induced rabies cases analyzed in this study.",

Most of these differences were derived from single nucleotide variants (SNVs) already present in the progenitor ERA-BHK21 vaccine virus strain, while a few additional mutations at the consensus level were of spontaneous origin. While all but one of the latter mutations appeared to be unique, the selected SNVs could be found across several viruses from ERA vaccine-induced rabies cases.

The analysis revealed no nucleotide exchanges between the SAD Bernorig-derived vaccine virus strains and their induced rabies cases in any of the known antigenic sites, including SNVs on these particular positions. Furthermore, none of the antigenic sites were affected by mutations in the ERA vaccine-induced rabies cases, except for one amino acid (AA) exchange Thr178Ile at an interferon-antagonist motif in the P-gene [28] found in all members of group 2 (Table 4). Whether this single AA exchange has any influence on pathogenicity remains speculative, as the entire motif contains eleven AAs and only the deletion of segments or the complete motif was studied [28]. On the other hand, if pathogenicity is increased by this presumed haplotype of group 2, more vaccine-induced rabies cases of this variant would be expected.",

The latter showed a high genetic heterogeneity in different vaccine virus strains as opposed to viruses from vaccine-induced rabies cases, indicating a substantial loss in viral population diversity. In this study, we could identify two different vaccine virus-dependent patterns in the genetic markup of viruses from vaccine-induced rabies cases. This was only possible by including further samples of ERA [7] and SAD Bern vaccine-induced rabies cases in the in-depth variant analysis (Table 1). Hence, in total 20 datasets from viruses of 15 cases of vaccine-induced rabies from Europe and Canada as well as 15 related batches of the ERA-BHK21, SAD Bern, and SAD B19 vaccine strains that were collected between 1991 and 2017 [7,14,15] were considered in this analysis.",

One reason could be the passage history. Both ERA-BHK21 and SAD Bernorig vaccine virus strains descend from the same derivative of the cell culture-adapted field virus strain, namely SAD [5,6], but were independently further developed by multiple in vitro passaging on various cell types (see [14] for a more comprehensive overview on this topic). Genetic as well as phylogenetic analyses, however, suggest that the ERA-BHK21 vaccine virus remained closer to its progenitor SAD strain [14,15]. On the other hand, the SAD Bernorig vaccine virus strain was further developed into the commercial vaccine virus strains SAD Bern and SAD B19. Eventually, increased cell culture adaptation of SAD Bern and SAD B19 vaccine virus strains may have selected for only a single replication-competent haplotype. In parallel, this adaptation towards efficient replication in cell culture is favoring the development of defective interfering particles [34] that provide the background for the high genetic diversity as found by the variant analyses (Figure 1). Unfortunately, our analysis was restricted to viruses for which sufficient sequencing data was available, and thus, could not cover the SAD P5/88 vaccine-induced rabies cases [15].",

For the attenuated oral rabies vaccines investigated here, our analyses on alterations in antigenic sites showed no evidence of a reversion to virulence of viruses from vaccine-induced rabies cases either as result of the production process nor of the in vivo replication in affected animals. This is also supported by the population-based analysis conducted, which clearly separated field strains from vaccines and their induced cases (Figure 3). Rather, other factors including the individual immune status or genetic predisposition of the infected animals most likely have contributed to the development of disease. This is supported by the observation, that none of these sporadic cases resulted in onward transmission or was of epidemiological relevance [1,8].",
