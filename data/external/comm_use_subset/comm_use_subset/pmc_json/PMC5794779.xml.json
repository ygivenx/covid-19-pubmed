Following virus entry, the viral NP mediates rapid nuclear translocation of vRNPs, a property enabling IAV to evade cytosolic pattern recognition receptors and granting access to the nuclear splicing machinery required for the expression of certain viral genes4,5. Initially, the IAV polymerase synthesizes mRNA transcripts which are translated into viral proteins at cytosolic ribosomes. Once a sufficient amount of newly synthesized viral protein (in particular PB2, PB1, PA and NP) has been made and imported into the nucleus, the viral polymerase switches to synthesis of complementary RNA which is encapsidated into complementary RNPs (cRNPs) during this process. These cRNPs in turn serve as intermediates for synthesis of new vRNPs which are finally exported from the nucleus to be packaged into new viral particles at the plasma membrane4.",

After recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns, such as viral RNA, the cell responds by secreting type I and III interferons. These interferons bind to their respective receptors leading to JAK-STAT signaling and eventually to induction of several hundred interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), of which some have direct effector activity against particular viruses7. The speed of the antiviral response is critical to prevent further virus spread. Therefore, most ISG promoters, which would otherwise be covered by nucleosomes and not be available for immediate access, are \u201cprimed\u201d for rapid transcriptional activation through the bound SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex (BAF complex)8. The promotor-bound BAF complex not only facilitates rapid induction but also basal level expression and, upon stimulation, induction of ISGs to a higher extent.",

MxA belongs to the family of large dynamin-like GTPases and localizes to the cytoplasm, in contrast to IAV replication which occurs in the nucleus. To date, the mechanism by which MxA inhibits IAV replication is still unclear and somewhat controversial12,13.

SMARCA2 is the ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex (BAF complex), the complex known to reside on promoters of many ISGs thereby facilitating their induction. Our data show that SMARCA2 is required for the induction of an antiviral state in IFN-treated cells but that induction of MxA per se is not affected by the absence of SMARCA2. A transcriptome analysis of SMARCA2-depleted A549-MxA cells identified a large number of SMARCA2-regulated genes, of which many are ISGs. Several of these factors, in particular IFITM2 and IGFBP3, were required for efficient inhibition of viral replication in A549-MxA cells. Therefore, our data demonstrate that several SMARCA2-dependent ISGs act in concert to facilitate the antiviral activity of MxA against influenza A viruses.",

To easily monitor virus replication a reporter virus was generated based on the highly MxA-sensitive influenza A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) virus17 by incorporating a Renilla (RL) luciferase reporter construct into the NS segment (H5N1-RL) as previously described by Reuther and colleagues (Supplementary Figure S1a)23. Furthermore, to allow utilization of this highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus under biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) conditions several positively charged amino acids were removed from the hemagglutinin (HA) cleavage site to render it monobasic, and thus classifying the virus as a low pathogenic avian virus (Supplementary Figure S1b)24,25. In the presence of MxA, virus replication is inhibited resulting in low levels of RL activity, but upon transfection of an siRNA targeting MxA (silencing the MxA-encoding gene MX1), virus replication is restored and an increase in RL activity is observed (Supplementary Figure S2a). The goal of the siRNA screen was to identify siRNAs that restore virus replication in the presence of MxA, so siMX1 served as the positive control and a non-targeting (NT) siRNA as the negative control. The assay was miniaturized to 384-well format and the quality was assessed by measuring the strictly standardized mean difference (SSMD)26, which accounts for the assay window and variability. The SSMD was calculated as 9.4, confirming a high quality assay suitable for high-throughput screening (Supplementary Figure S2a).",

The antiviral activity of Mx proteins is not affected by the addition of amino-terminal tags28,29. Therefore A549 cells expressing amino-terminally streptavidin-tagged MxA (Strep-MxA) under control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter were generated alongside control cells expressing Strep-GFP. Strep-MxA and Strep-GFP were induced with doxycycline for 24 hours and the cells were then either infected with H5N1-RL or mock infected in triplicate. 24 hours post infection, cells were lysed and the Strep-tagged proteins precipitated by affinity purification with Strep-Tactin sepharose beads. Precipitated proteins were digested and identified by mass (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Figure S3). Mass spectrometry files were searched using MAXQuant and statistical analysis performed using MSStats30,31. None of the factors were virus-encoded. 15 host cell factors qualified as high-confidence hits based on enrichment with the MxA bait vs. the GFP bait during H5N1-RL infection (Log2FC > 2; p-value < 0.05 under statistical conditions to minimize false negatives or Log2FC > 2; p-value < 0.1 under statistical conditions to minimize false positives) (Supplementary Table S3).",

Although comparison of the resulting hits shows no direct overlap, using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA\u00ae, Qiagen) we were able to identify a network of 13 host cell factors (Supplementary Table S4), including MxA, that are significantly enriched amongst the dataset when analyzed for representation in canonical pathways, upstream regulators and protein-protein interaction networks (p-value < 0.05, Fig. 1c,d, Supplementary Figure S4a). Within this network of 13 factors, 7 (including MxA) were identified in the siRNA screen and 6 in the proteomic screen. To validate the requirement of these 13 factors for MxA antiviral activity, we transfected A549-MxA cells with siRNAs targeting the respective gene (4 siRNAs per gene). Following infection with H5N1-RL, luciferase activity was measured to assess the antiviral effect. We considered a factor to be validated if at least 2 out of 4 siRNAs significantly increased virus replication by 90% (Log2FC \u2265 0.93, p-value < 0.05) compared to a non-targeting (NT) control siRNA (Supplementary Figure S4b). Those criteria were only met by SMARCA2, ZC3HAV1 (also known as ZAP) and CASP9. As these data were generated in the presence of MxA they suggest that SMARCA2, ZC3HAV1 and CASP9 are required for efficient MxA restriction of H5N1, however, they may also have an antiviral effect independent of MxA.",

However, its activity against IAV is only modest32,33 and there is no information about its relevance to MxA restriction. Similarly, for CASP9, an initiator caspase required for the apoptotic pathway, neither association with MxA nor IAV has been shown. SMARCA2 is an ATPase subunit of the BAF chromatin remodeling complex, a complex required for the induction of many genes, including interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) with anti-IAV activity34. To verify that SMARCA2, ZC3HAV1 and CASP9 are required for the antiviral activity of MxA, but do not act as MxA-independent restriction factors, we made use of A549 wild type cells (A549-wt) and the established cell line A549-shMxA which stably overexpresses a short hairpin RNA targeting MxA (shMxA)16. Due to the stable expression of shMxA even MxA induced by viral infection is expected to be immediately silenced. Upon infection with H5N1-RL or a Renilla-expressing reporter virus based on the MxA-sensitive IAV strain A/seal/Massachusetts/1/198010,11 (H7N7-RL), high reporter activity was observed in A549-wt and A549-shMxA cells but replication was considerably reduced in A549-MxA cells due to the presence of MxA (Supplementary Figure S5a). siRNA knockdown of MxA (MX1), CASP9 and SMARCA2 increased reporter activity of both viruses by up to ~6-fold and at least 2-fold in A549-MxA cells (2 out of 4 siRNAs increasing reporter activity) (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Figure S5b). On the other hand, in A549-shMxA and A549-wt cells such an increase was not observed upon RNAi-mediated depletion. These data suggest that MxA requires the presence of SMARCA2 and CASP9 to efficiently restrict influenza A viruses and in the absence of MxA, SMARCA2 and CASP9 do not display antiviral properties.",

Knockdown of SMARCA2 using the most efficient siRNA (Supplementary Figure S5b,d) resulted in >1 log10 increase in viral titer relative to siNT in A549-MxA cells (Fig. 1f). The combination of SMARCA2 and MxA knockdown did not result in a further increase of viral titer over the level of siMxA alone, which is similar to that observed with both wild-type and reporter viruses in siSMARCA2-treated A549-shMxA cells (Fig. 1e,f, Supplementary Figure S5b).

This complex has been shown to have chromatin remodeling activity either in conjunction with SMARCA2 or another ATPase subunit, SMARCA4, depending on the development stage and cell type investigated35\u201337. In HeLa cells the SMARCA4-containing BAF complex was shown to be required for induction of 90% of type-I interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs)8. However, A549 cells do not express SMARCA4 protein (Supplementary Figure S6a, ref.38), so we aimed to investigate whether SMARCA2 is involved in ISG expression in these cells. A549-wt cells were transfected with siRNAs targeting MxA, JAK1, or SMARCA2 and then treated, or not, with 1000 U/mL IFN-\u03b1 48 h after siRNA transfection. 24 h after IFN treatment, the cells were challenged with H7N7-RL. In the absence of IFN no enhancement of viral replication was observed relative to the non-targeting (NT) control siRNA (Fig. 2a). In IFN-treated A549-wt cells, however, silencing of JAK1, which is a major signal transducer of IFN signaling39,40 and required for the IFN-mediated induction of all ISGs, led to a significant increase in viral replication (~15-fold), while knockdown of the single ISG, MxA, elevated viral replication by about 2-fold (Fig. 2a). Intriguingly, knockdown of SMARCA2 resulted in a ~10-fold increase in virus replication, suggesting that SMARCA2 is indeed required for the establishment of an IFN-inducible antiviral state in A549 cells.",

Indeed, in the case of JAK1 knockdown, MxA expression is substantially diminished as determined by western blot analysis (Fig. 2a). But surprisingly SMARCA2 depletion does not alter MxA induction by IFN. This finding leads us to conclude that SMARCA2 is required for robust induction of ISG(s) other than MxA which in turn support the antiviral activity of MxA. Thus, in the absence of SMARCA2, cells expressing MxA should show increased susceptibility to IAV infection. Analysis of SMARCA2-silenced A549-wt cells pretreated with 1000 U/mL IFN-\u03b1 24 h prior to H7N7-RL infection revealed that in fact 8.6% of cells were positive for both MxA and viral nucleoprotein (NP), compared to 0.1% in the non-targeting (NT) control knockdown (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Figure S6b). Based on these findings we hypothesize that SMARCA2 facilitates the induction of one or several ISG(s) which in turn support the antiviral activity of MxA against IAV.",

Another 15 handpicked genes were added, including controls such as SMARCA2, and finally, pseudogenes were filtered out. To investigate which of the SMARCA2-regulated factors are required for the antiviral activity of MxA, siRNA pools were used to silence each gene in A549-MxA cells which were subsequently infected with H7N7-RL. To ensure sufficient induction of the selected factors (and thus allow for knockdown) the cells received 25 U/mL IFN-\u03b1 6 h prior to infection, which was the minimal amount found to reduce viral reporter activity (indicative of ISG induction) without diminishing it completely (Supplementary Figure S7a). None of the siRNAs had cytotoxic effects (Supplementary Figure S7b). The effect of each siRNA pool on virus replication +/\u2212 IFN was determined and ranked according to the strongest increase in viral replication (green) in the absence of IFN (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Figure S7b). As expected, although the general pattern was similar, greater effects were observed in the presence of IFN, with MxA depletion enhancing replication by 5.9-fold and knockdown of SMARCA2 by 11.2-fold. Several factors displayed clear effects, such as IGFBP3, which increased viral replication by 8-fold upon silencing. Most prominently however, knockdown of the ISG IFITM2 resulted in a 9.5-fold increase in viral replication. Knockdown of IFITM3, on the other hand, which is a relative of IFITM2 and known to be a potent IAV restriction factor41, showed only a 3.3-fold increase in virus replication under MxA overexpression conditions. In the absence of MxA (A549-shMxA cells) the antiviral effect of IFITM3 is more visible, and stronger than that of IFITM2, when cells are pre-stimulated with IFN (Fig. 3d). Generally, the replication-enhancing effects upon knockdown of the most potent SMARCA2-regulated factors appear to depend on the presence of MxA for full effect, as no, or only minor, increases in H7N7-RL reporter activity were observed in A549-shMxA cells, e.g. 2.5-fold with IFITM2 and 3.7-fold with IGFBP3 (Fig. 3d). To more easily assess whether factors depend on MxA we calculated the ratio of the relative reporter activity between A549-MxA and A549-shMxA cells either with or without IFN-pretreatment and considered all factors with a ratio >2 (Fig. 3e). The factors with the strongest evidence for being MxA co-factors are: ARHGEF10L, IFITM2, IFITM3, IGFBP3, KCNK3, PARP10, RARRES3, SAMD9L and UBE2L6. In summary these data identify several factors, in particular IFITM2 and IGFBP3, as SMARCA2-regulated, virus-inducible factors required for IAV restriction by MxA.",

Although postulated16, it remains to be shown whether other cellular factors are involved in mediating the antiviral effects of MxA. We therefore conducted parallel RNAi and protein interaction screens to identify potential MxA cofactors and identified a network of 13 factors supported by both screens.

Interestingly, the human lung adenocarcinoma cell line, A549, used in our study does not express the other ATPase subunit, SMARCA4 (or BRG1)38. Loss or mutation of SMARCA4 seems to be a relatively frequent event during tumorigenesis51,52 and SMARCA2 can at least partially compensate for the loss of SMARCA453\u201355. Suffice to say that by using A549 cells we could study the role of SMARCA2 specifically. We were unable to generate A549 SMARCA2 CRISPR knockout cells as cell proliferation was inhibited, which agrees with previous reports55\u201357. However, with transient knockdown we found that SMARCA2 depletion decreased the ability of IFN-treated A549 cells to establish an antiviral state. This is in agreement with previous findings that the BAF complex is required for induction of a subset of IFN-\u03b1-inducible genes8,58,59, although in these studies SMARCA4/BRG1 was the focus. Surprisingly, however, MxA expression is unaffected by SMARCA2 depletion, suggesting that reduced MxA antiviral function is due to the absence of one or more SMARCA2-regulated factors. Flow cytometry experiments support this by demonstrating that SMARCA2 depletion leads to an elevated number of cells positive for both viral antigen (NP) and MxA in IFN-pretreated A549 cells. These results also provide strong support to the findings of Xiao and colleagues that additional ISGs are required for full MxA activity16 and further show that these ISGs are probably regulated by SMARCA2. Alternatively MxA may interact with SMARCA2, although this is unlikely as neither SMARCA2 nor any other BAF component was identified as an MxA-interacting candidate in our mass spectrometry analysis. Also, SMARCA2 is a nuclear protein unlike MxA60.",

            "text": "A transcriptome analysis on IAV-infected SMARCA2-depleted A549-MxA cells identified 140 genes that strongly depend on the presence of SMARCA2. By far the most significantly enriched gene category was interferon-\u03b1 response-associated genes, further validating the importance of SMARCA2 to ISG expression, even in the absence of SMARCA4. Cui and colleagues demonstrated that SMARCA4 in HeLa cells constitutively binds to the promoters of the ISGs IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3 resulting in basal level expression and rapid and strong induction upon IFN-\u03b1 stimulation8. We show that the same genes are regulated by SMARCA2 in A549 cells. Finally, we determined that 9 of these SMARCA2-regulated factors are required for full antiviral activity of MxA: ARHGEF10L, IFITM2, IFITM3, IGFBP3, KCNK3, PARP10, RARRES3, SAMD9L and UBE2L6. The application of low levels of IFN-\u03b1 in these experiments allowed for a larger assay window when detecting ISGs, and this may account for why we failed to detect these factors in the primary RNAi screen. Intriguingly 6 of the 9 host cell factors are ISGs61 and 2 factors, KCNK3 and IGFBP3, are induced in response to IFN in virus infected cells, so may be either IFN- or virus-inducible. As expected some factors display antiviral activity in the absence of MxA too (e.g. IFITM3, IGFBP3, IFITM2) but others seem to strictly depend on the presence of MxA, such as KCNK3, PARP10 and UBE2L6. Nonetheless, in all cases, the IAV restriction potency of these factors is increased in A549-MxA cells.",

            "text": "The antiviral activity of MxA appears to rely particularly on the presence of IGFBP3 and IFITM2. IGFBP3 (insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3) binds insulin-like growth factors IGF-1 and IGF-2 circulating in the plasma and modulates their growth-promoting effects62. Furthermore, IGFBP3 can interact with the IGFBP-3R receptor thereby acting as tumor suppressor63 and it can be internalized resulting in alterations of cell signaling64\u201367. It is unclear how IGFBP3 could increase MxA activity and further studies will be required to determine whether it acts as an ISG, as some of our data suggest. IFITM2 belongs to a protein family, the interferon-inducible transmembrane protein family, which is known for its importance in IAV restriction. IFITM proteins are type-I and type-II IFN-inducible cell-intrinsic restriction factors and were first described to have antiviral functions in 1996 by Alber et al.68. More recently their significance in IAV restriction was discovered in a genome-wide siRNA screen41. However, IFITMs are also active against many other enveloped RNA viruses41,69\u201377. In humans three IFITMs are IFN-inducible and display antiviral properties, namely IFITM1, 2 and 378. IAV restriction is mainly mediated by IFITM3, which has similar potency to MxA16, while IFITM2 shows an intermediate phenotype and IFITM1 only demonstrates minor effects79. For CCR5-tropic HIV-1 and HCV restriction, however, IFITM1 plays the dominant role which is at least in part due to its localization to the plasma membrane69,71. In the case of CCR5-tropic HIV-1 it is believed that IFITM-1 counteracts viral fusion at the plasma membrane to restrict access to the cytosol69. Similarly IFITM3 and IFITM2, which only differ by 12 amino acids, are thought to block fusion of IAV with the endosomal membrane79. Therefore the main mechanism of restriction by IFITMs is by preventing fusion of viral membranes with cellular lipid bilayers, although other mechanisms have also been proposed80. Here, we demonstrate that in the presence of MxA, IFITM2 is the major IFITM member required for IAV restriction. Interestingly, both IFITM2 and MxA are thought to restrict IAV at similar stages of the virus life cycle, with IFITM2 described to act in the late endosome and MxA directly after release of vRNPs from the late endosome15,16,79. Furthermore, MxA has been shown to associate with membranes81,82, therefore it is conceivable that IFITM2 and MxA act in a coordinated sequential fashion in a similar manner as was recently proposed by Narayana et al. for IFITM1, 2 and 371. This study proposed that IFITMs would trap the virus in the endocytic pathway and eventually redirect it to lysosomal degradation. We propose that MxA might cooperate to a small extent with IFITM3 at the early endosome and more strongly with IFITM2 at the late endosome shortly before vRNP release. Intriguingly, Narayana and colleagues already hypothesized that IFITM2 may associate with unknown host factors to restrict viral replication71. Apart from IFITM2 and IGFBP3, several other factors were also found to show stronger antiviral effects in the presence of MxA. It is therefore possible that to achieve full viral inhibition all, or several, of the identified factors may have to act in concert with each other, as well as with MxA. Further studies will be required to investigate the individual contribution of these factors and whether a certain combination is needed to fully support the antiviral activity of MxA.",
