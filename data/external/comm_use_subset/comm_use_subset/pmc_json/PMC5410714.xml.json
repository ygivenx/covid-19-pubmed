School\u2010aged children with influenza tend to miss more school than those with respiratory illnesses of other etiologies.4, 5 Few studies have assessed the burden of school absenteeism due to laboratory\u2010confirmed influenza,5, 6, 7 and only one was conducted after the recommendation for annual influenza vaccination in children in the United States.5 Absenteeism data on the relative contribution of ARIs caused by viruses other than influenza are lacking. Non\u2010influenza viral illnesses may be less common, but also likely to disrupt usual activities and cause increased school absenteeism. Quantifying school absenteeism due to specific viruses can help target prevention or treatment strategies to reduce burden in school\u2010aged children.",

Knowledge of a known illness may have kept the child out of school longer than an illness without confirmation of etiology. Second, our study likely underestimated the burden of school absenteeism due to respiratory illness because our study population was restricted to children with medically attended illness and did not assess children who did not seek care. In a household cohort, 38% of ARIs occurred in school\u2010aged children and approximately 20% of all ARI cases were medically attended.1 The proportion medically attended varied by viral etiology. Additionally, enrollment for our study was restricted to the influenza season and did not capture viral respiratory illnesses that occurred outside this period, likely underestimating the burden of medically attended illnesses due to viruses other than influenza. However, including only medically attended illnesses would lead to overestimation of the average duration of absenteeism.
