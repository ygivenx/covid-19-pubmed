It is a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus belonging to the family Paramyxoviridae and is classified within the genus Henipavirus which it shares with one other virus, Nipah virus (NiV). HeV first emerged in the Brisbane suburb of Hendra in 1994, where it caused the deaths of one human and fourteen horses [5]. Since then a further thirty four HeV outbreaks have been identified along the mid to north-eastern coast of Australia with infection of five more humans (of whom three died) and numerous horses [6], [7], [8], [9]. Pteropid bats have been identified as the reservoir host [10], however epidemiological evidence does not support direct bat to human transmission. Horses have been an intermediate host in the transmission of disease to humans in all cases. There are as yet no readily available effective therapies or prophylaxis for HeV infection, either for use in humans or other susceptible animals.",

Several species have been used for this purpose including: ferrets, hamsters, guinea pigs, pigs, cats, horses, and African green monkeys [3], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]. With bats, the list comprises species from six orders including; Rodentia, Primates, Chiroptera, Cetartiodactyla, Perrisodactyla and Carnivora. The broad species susceptibility is unusual for a member of the family Paramyxoviridae and is attributed largely to the highly conserved nature [17] of the host receptors for the virus, Ephrin B2 and B3 [18], [19]. Despite the possession of relevant receptors [19], the laboratory mouse, a most useful host on account of their small size, ease of handling, and vast library of available reagents, is reported to be resistant to HeV infection and disease [20].",

Juvenile BALB/c mice were inoculated with 5000 median tissue culture infective doses (TCID50) of virus by a parenteral route and observed for clinical signs of infection. Mice remained clinically well throughout the 21 day study period and, after euthanasia, there was no evidence of infection by gross or histological examination, virus isolation or serology. Similar results were reported by Wong et al in 2003, who investigated the susceptibility of mice to the closely related Nipah virus [21] by inoculating juvenile Swiss brown mice by either parenteral or intranasal routes.",

Additionally, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), a technique not available at the time of the initial studies, would be used for detecting evidence of viral replication.",

Infection manifested as acute, transient, and asymptomatic virus replication in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, together with clinically significant encephalitis that has a longer incubation period than is reported for other models of fulminating HeV disease. The pattern of central nervous system involvement (CNS) supports neuroinvasion by the anterograde route (spread from the neuron cell body toward the axon terminus) and, importantly, transneuronal spread within the CNS. Over all, the study demonstrated that mice are susceptible to HeV infection and has provided a new and important model for HeV induced encephalitis.",

It is of interest to note that mouse 14 died comparatively early in the course of the study (day 12) and the viral RNA detected in the lungs was consistent with the results of mice that were euthanased in the earlier phases of the subsequent time course trial (described below). Low levels of viral genome (CT 39.2) were also detected in blood samples from one juvenile intranasally exposed mouse, mouse 3. Whether viral genome detected in the above three cases reflected replication at the time of euthanasia or residual genome from earlier transient infection could not be determined.",

In contrast to C57BL/6 mice, lesions and viral antigen were detected in nervous tissues of both symptomatic and asymptomatic animals (Table 1). Two of the three animals that developed clinical disease had encephalitis and viral antigen in the brain: in the third animal (mouse 26) the olfactory bulb was not sampled, and only half the brain was available for histological assessment (the rest was used for qPCR and virus isolation). Four asymptomatic mice (one aged and three juvenile) had encephalitis and viral antigen in brain, with a further two asymptomatic, mice having encephalitis only. Encephalitic lesions and viral antigen deposition in BALB/c mice were also largely confined to neuro-anatomical sites associated with afferent pathways of olfaction (Table 3).

Dual labeling of sections of infected mice with these markers and with HeV antibodies indicated that there was no co-localisation of Hendra antigen with GFAP or MBP (Figure 3B and 3C). On rare occasions there was evidence of low intensity staining for Hendra viral antigen and microglial markers in single cells (Figure 3D). The Hendra protein labelling appeared to be discrete and circumscribed which would be consistent with its presence within a cellular compartment such as lysosomes. Compared with uninfected control tissue, there was reduced labeling of neurons with neuronal markers (NeuN and NFP1) in infected tissue. Therefore, we could not use co-localisation studies with these antibodies to confirm HeV antigen in neurons. In order to explore whether viral proteins could be identified within endothelial cells of capillaries or larger vessels, differential interference contrast (DIC) images were taken of areas of Hendra replication. The capillary lumen and endothelial cell cytoplasm were clearly identified and in no case was Hendra antigen detected in the cytoplasm of endothelial cells (Figure 3E).",

Viral antigen was detected in both the olfactory mucosa and the olfactory bulbs of intranasally challenged mice as early as day 6 post infection and these two structures are connected by olfactory sensory neurons (OSN). OSNs are located within the olfactory mucosa of the nasal cavity and project cilia out into the lumen of the nasal cavity to detect odorants [27]. Their axons project to the olfactory bulb of the brain [28] and thereby provide pathogens with a potential route of direct transmission from the nasal cavity to the brain. Within the olfactory bulbs OSNs synapse with mitral, tufted (projection neurons) and peri/juxtaglomerular cells (interneurons) in the glomeruli [29], and secondary dendrites of the mitral and tufted cells synapse with dendrites of granule cells, which reside largely in the granule cell layer [30]. The trigeminal nerve may provide another possible route of neuroinvasion from the nasal cavity to the glomeruli of the olfactory bulbs. Peripheral peptidergic fibres of the trigeminal nerve innervate the olfactory epithelium and at least some of these fibres will send collaterals to the olfactory bulb (fibres terminate in the glomeruli) [31] en route to the trigeminal ganglion and the contribution of these fibres to viral invasion of the olfactory bulbs requires closer investigation. Viral antigen and lesions were also identified in the pons and medulla in four mice. We suggest that in these cases brain infection occurred via another peripheral neural pathway that enters the CNS at the brainstem such as the trigeminal [27] or the vestibulocochlear nerve [32] and it is of interest that in one animal antigen was localised to the vestibular nuclei of the medulla, which would be consistent with neuroinvasion of the vestibulocochlear nerve [32] after infection arising in the inner ear.",

            "text": "The HeV mouse infection model also provides an opportunity to study mechanisms of viral suppression. Our studies show that although intranasally exposed mice develop transient respiratory infection, the low viral titres detected suggest that infection is controlled in its early phase and cleared. Furthermore, this respiratory infection does not progress to a significant systemic disease as occurs in other animal species [2], [3], [13], [15]. Suppression of infection in the absence of evidence for a robust neutralising adaptive immune response suggests an important role for the mouse innate immune system in this process. HeV has been shown to employ various strategies to evade clearance and control by the innate immune system [43] and we suggest that in the mouse such strategies are rendered ineffective. It will be important in future research to elucidate the mechanism by which mice eliminate respiratory infection and resist systemic disease in order to guide the development of therapeutics that might mimic the process.",

            "text": "In summary, this paper reports three novel observations. Firstly, mice are susceptible to HeV infection after intranasal exposure with aged animals reliably developing encephalitic disease. Their small size and ease of handling, as well as the vast range of biological reagents available for use in the species, render them highly valuable infection models for HeV encephalitis. Secondly, our data strongly support a role for not only anterograde neuroinvasion along sensory neurones but also transneuronal viral spread of HeV within the brain. This finding is of particular importance as infection may be established within the nervous system before current systemic treatments are able to be delivered across the blood-brain barrier. Lastly, mice are resistant to systemic vasculitis and fulminating HeV disease, the mechanisms of which can be explored with therapeutic potential. These findings provide a significant contribution to the body of knowledge in the field and have opened up new areas of investigation, from which significant understanding and further research can arise of benefit to humans as well as animals.",
