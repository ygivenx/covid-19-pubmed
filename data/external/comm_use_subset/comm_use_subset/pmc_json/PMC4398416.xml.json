At one such enclosure, an Indian flying fox held in captivity was found to have progressive exudative skin lesions on a wing for a prolonged period of time, and necessitated two amputations prior to submission of the samples to the National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease (NCFAD) in Winnipeg. The skin formed small vesicles containing fluid which was released over time, leading to the skin sloughing away. Histologically, a neutrophilic vasculitis in the dermis with fibrinoid degeneration and necrosis was observed, with vesicles/bullae in the epidermis leading to sloughing of epidermis and fibrinosuppurative exudate forming on these ulcerated areas. An underlying viral infection or a \"sterile\" inflammatory/neutrophilic disorder was considered. Both topical and systemic antimicrobials were used to treat potential fungal and/or bacterial infections. The infected bat did not respond to antimicrobial therapy, resulting in two amputations to the affected wing and ultimately death, suggesting a systemic infection. Bat wing and vesicle samples were submitted to the NCFAD to exclude henipaviruses.",

Recently, it has been recognized that Leptospirosis, caused by the spirochete Leptospira, can be transmitted to rodents and potentially humans, through the urine of infected bats [3,4]. Leptospirosis is a biphasic disease, the first signs being flu like symptoms transitioning to a secondary phase which can lead to meningitis, liver damage and renal failure. Additional bacterial species reported in flying foxes include; Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri and Shigella sonnei [4]. Limited work has been performed to identify potential pathogens of bats or mutualistic bacteria found within their microbiome. Further understanding of this relationship will provide insight into potential risk factors associated with the natural flora of bats.",

The type species Afipia felis, was first described as the etiologic agent of cat scratch disease [5]. It was later determined to cause only a small number of cases while the majority of infections where due to Bartonella henselae [6]. Recent work has identified Afipia as Legionella like amoebae pathogens (LLAP) [7]. These bacteria have shown the ability to resist amoebae degradation and are considered to be a potential cause of unexplained pneumonia cases [8]. A. felis is capable of intracellular survival within macrophages by evading canonical endocytosis [9,10]. In light of these findings it has been suggested Afipia are potential human pathogens and this was recently confirmed by the identification of new Afipia species isolated from the blood of patients with unidentified infections [11,12].",

The total combined length was 5,085,524 bp and harboured 4890 predicted genes, 4772 of which were protein coding and of those 1292 were deemed hypothetical proteins with no predicted function. A genome wide analysis of these genes using the MRCA approach (Fig. 3) clearly support the isolate as being a member of the Bradyrhizobiaceae family. However, when it came to classification down to the level of genus, 18.1% of the genes were most closely related to Bradyrhizobium and only 13.7% to Afipia. Rhodopseudomonas was the next most abundant at 8.5%. These results appear to be a slight contraction to those of the 16S rRNA gene analysis however it should be noted that Bradyrhizobium is more highly represented in the NR database than is Afipia. At the time of analysis the NR database contained approximately 6 times more unique gene entries for Bradyrhizobium spp than was found for Afipia spp (141,020 vs 21,931). Alternatively this could simply reflect the inter-relatedness among the Bradyrhizobiaceae family. This novel bacterium lies within the Bradyrhizobiaceae, and is expected to be a member of the genus Afipia. The genome sequence was deposited to DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under the accession AZSJ00000000.",

While they serve as reservoirs for a number of serious human pathogens such as; Hendra and Nipah viruses, SARS coronavirus, or Ebola/Marburg viruses, very little research has been performed to characterize their microflora. This study identified a new bacterial species associated with infection of an Indian flying fox. We have identified the bacterial isolate as a unique Afipia species, most closely related by 16S rRNA gene analysis to Afipia genospecies 12. We are tentatively annotating this new bacterial isolate as Afipia pteropus. Very little is known about this genus with the most recognised type strain being Afipia felis, originally thought to cause cat scratch disease (CSD) [6,23]. Recent work by Lo et al. documented the discovery of A. septicemia which produced a virus like disease in human patients [11,12]. It is possible that the newly identified Afipia pteropus may have had a similar course of infection in the affected bat, although the only apparent clinical sign was progressive necrosis of the wing digits in the early stages of the disease.",

Interestingly, Afipia species are capable of intracellular growth, both inside amoeba, macrophages or other mammalian cell lines [9,10,21,22,24]. It has been previously shown A. felis are capable of inducing macropinocytosis to gain entry into macrophages similar to other intracellular pathogens [9,25]. In contrast, non-professional phagocytes infected with A. felis undergo classical endocytic pathway dynamics [22]. Although we do not know the mechanism of internalization, we were able to detect Afipia-like particles within Vero E6 cells. This internalisation may be important to pathogenesis of this bacterial species. It has been previously documented using microscopy and ultrastructure analysis, that A. felis induce cells to produce filamentous fibriles [22].

            "text": "The Bradyrhizobiaceae are an extremely diverse group of bacteria and it has been suggested this group be divided to more accurately represent the bacteria within it [23]. In general, the Bradyrhizobiaceae are defined as bacteria found within soil or water, either as saprophytic or symbiotic organisms. Based on our 16S rRNA analysis, the Afipia are located within the Bradyrhizobiaceae, however Afipia genospecies 14 is located next to Rhdobacter capsulatus of the Rhodobacteraceae. Further, A. genospecies 11 and 13 are more distantly related than Bartonella species further exemplifying the diversity of this genus. Although the majority of Afipia are more closely related, the boot strap values at nodes separating the various species appear low. Classification of a new Afipia family may alleviate the skewed boot strap values by partitioning out the Bradyrhizobium species. Future placement of newly sequenced Afipia isolates will provide greater depth to understanding this genus. From our phylogenetic tree we can infer that most, if not all the bacteria are capable of infection whether it be a symbiont or a pathogen.",

            "text": "The overall size of A. pteropus genome is close to 5 Mb, similar to the fully sequenced Rhodopseudomonas palustris, yet smaller than other sequenced Bradyrhizobiacae. The genome sequence predicts a metabolically diverse organism, with suggested motility based on the presence of genes encoding a flagellar apparatus. Interestingly, similar to Agrobacterium tumefaciens, a type IV virulence secretion system was predicted by genome sequence. These systems are used for transfer of proteins or protein-nucleic acid complexes out of the bacterial cell into a prokaryotic or Eukaryotic host [26]. In addition, proteins predicted for transport through a type VII secretion system are encoded by the genome. This system is most recently known for its role in Mycobacterium extracellular protein transport [27,28]. If functional, both of these secretion systems could play a role in pathogenesis. The genome sequence further predicts a large number of antibiotic resistance and virulence genes by analysis through the MvirDB virulence database. The high abundance of antibiotic resistance genes may account for the ineffectiveness of drugs used during treatment. Genome sequence analysis identified many putative antibiotic resistance genes including those for beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, kanamycin and neomycin among others. The course of antibiotic administration during treatment included among others BNP topical ointment and amphotericin B. Systemic antibiotics were also administered including amoxicillin, enrofloxacin, TMS and itraconazole. There appears to be a direct correlation between drug treatment and antibiotic resistance likely explaining the failed course of treatment. In addition, extracellular capsular polysaccharide was identified to be closely related to Staphlococcus aureus. Capsules enhance the virulence of bacterial strains by resisting phagocytosis and prolonging survival. Extracellular capsules further contribute to biofilm formation. Biofilms are composed of an extracellular matrix surrounding bacteria forming surface associated communities. They provide shared resources for survival and help resist outside pressures such as antibiotic therapy [29,30]. Together these factors may allow for long term chronic infections.",

Previous work has detected Afipia spp. in hospital and drinking water. Moreover, it was shown Afipia were able to infect amoebae [24,31,32]. These data suggest Afipia may generally survive in water networks as free living organisms. In light of this, case files from acquired human infections suggest Afipia may also be an opportunistic human pathogen [23,24,32]. The MvirDB database for A. pteropus identified many genes that may contribute to pathogenesis. Further, like A. felis, intracellular entry is coordinated in a similar fashion to Legionella [9,10,22]. Unidentified infections can often mimic many agents as outlined by Lo et al. making treatment very difficult [11,12]. The expanded use of NGS will continue to aid in the identification and treatment of future infections ultimately providing better surveillance and care.",
