            "text": "Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare autosomal recessive disease affecting motile cilia throughout the body. The prevalence has been reported at 1 in 2200 in a highly consanguineous British Asian population [1] with estimates in Europe ranging from 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 40,000 [2, 3]. Over 35 genes have been discovered that cause PCD [4] accounting for up to 65% of PCD patients [5]. PCD has a profound effect on mucociliary transport with those affected suffering from a daily wet sounding cough and nasal symptoms from the newborn period. Significant numbers develop glue ear with associated hearing problems and approximately 45% have situs inversus. Bronchiectasis may develop in early childhood and severe lung disease is not uncommon in older patients [4]. Many patients with PCD remain undiagnosed or are diagnosed late after years of chronic respiratory symptoms.",

Diagnostic testing of those with a suggestive clinical history may include nasal nitric oxide (nNO) measurement [5], high-speed video microscopy to assess ciliary beat pattern and measure ciliary beat frequency [6] and electron microscopy [5]. Diagnostic testing can be difficult due to secondary ciliary dyskinesia although this problem may be markedly reduced by testing at least 4 weeks after a viral upper respiratory tract infection [7, 8]. Culture of nasal epithelial samples to an air-fluid interface can be helpful in some cases as it significantly reduces secondary ciliary dyskinesia seen in the original sample but maintains, and in many cases exaggerates, the abnormal beat pattern seen in original samples [9, 10]. The place of other tests including gene testing and immunofluorescence [11\u201313] are being evaluated to determine if they can help improve diagnostic certainty.",

            "text": "This study reports a novel observation that characteristic ciliated conical protrusions from the surface of ciliated cells are commonly seen in nasal epithelial samples from patients with PCD and are seen across different PCD phenotypes both on light and transmission electron microscopy. They were seen in both very healthy well ciliated strips of epithelium from patients with PCD and in areas where secondary epithelial damage was present. The number seen in patient samples was not associated with increasing patient age. We found the presence of ciliated conical protrusions had a specificity for PCD of 100%. Sensitivity however, was lower at 76.5%. Although fewer ciliate conical protrusions were seen following ciliated cell culture, their presence in cultures suggests they are not due to solely to underlying infection or external inflammatory stimuli. As ciliated cells lining the respiratory epithelium survive for many months, and ciliated cell cultures were studied after just 4 weeks in culture it is possible that the number of protrusions in cell cultures may have increased over time. It is also possible that respiratory infection or inflammation in the respiratory tract of PCD patients may have contributed to increased numbers of ciliated conical projections seen in epithelial samples taken directly from patients. In contrast to protrusion of cells from the epithelial surface (7), that is commonly seen in the presence of secondary epithelial damage [8], conical ciliated protrusions involve only a proportion of the surface of a ciliated cell and did not appear to be associated with breakdown of intracellular junctions.",

The authors speculated that alterations in the cytoskeleton may be responsible, however, it was not possible to perform similar measurements in ciliated cells and the mechanism responsible for the ciliated conical protrusions and increased membrane fluidity in neutrophils remains unclear. We believe that a combination of increased membrane fluidity in PCD epithelial cells coupled with disruption in the cellular dynein cytoskeleton may cause the features that we see, however this remains to be proven.",
