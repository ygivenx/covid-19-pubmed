A previous study by Rimi et al. found a median of four people per 100 sq. feet of floor space in hospital wards in Bangladesh and observed a median of five uncovered coughs or sneezes per 100 sq feet per hour [7]. Due to shortage of health care workers, family caregivers (family members who provides 24 hour hands on care to sick patient, including bedside nursing and cleaning) are integral part of inpatient care in Bangladeshi public hospitals, contributing crowding of hospital wards [8, 9]. The World Bank estimated that in 2014 only $32 of public funds per capita were spent annually on health infrastructure in Bangladesh. Thus, resources for infection control are severely limited in Bangladeshi hospitals [7, 10], making it difficult to implement international infection control guidelines [11].",

Rajshahi Medical College Hospital contains approximately 1,200 beds with eight adult medicine wards and four pediatric wards. Jessore Medical College Hospital is a 250-bed hospital with two adult medicine wards and one pediatric ward. Paediatric wards typically admit patients <14 years of age and older patients are admitted to adult medicine wards. The mean bed occupancy proportion in these hospital wards are consistently >100% with patients being treated on the floor and in hallways when beds unavailable [8, 12]. Study physicians in adult medicine and pediatric wards identified patients aged \u22655 years who met the severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) case definition of subjective or measured fever (\u226538 C\u00b0) within the past seven days with cough or sore throat [13]. In pediatric wards, physicians identified children <5 years of age who met the severe pneumonia (SP) case definition: cough or difficulty breathing and at least one danger sign (i.e. chest indrawing, stridor while calm, history of convulsions, inability to drink, lethargy or unconsciousness and/or intractable vomiting) with onset of symptoms within the last seven days [13]. Since case-patients were identified immediately after admission, their illnesses were mostly community acquired.",

Trained research assistants in each hospital collected one swab sample from five different surfaces near each enrolled case patient: the wall next to the patient\u2019s bed, bed rail, bed sheet, clinical record files, and a multipurpose towel. The multipurpose towel is a cloth brought from home by family caregivers and used to clean patient respiratory secretions, wiping the patient\u2019s face or head, and to dry caregivers\u2019 hands and face [8]. We selected these surfaces because patients, caregivers, and healthcare workers (HCWs) frequently come into contact with them in the hospital wards [6, 7, 15]. The research assistants collected surface swabs between 12\u201372 hours after the case-patients\u2019 admission to the hospital. This allowed for adequate time for hospital surfaces to be exposed to possible contamination by respiratory pathogens, while also making sure that surfaces were swabbed before the enrolled patients were discharged or died, as patient turnover in wards was high with a median hospital stay of three days [16]. The risk for infection from these potentially contaminated surfaces between patients within a room, between patients and healthcare workers, or between patients and family caregivers would vary based on the particular surface and how these different risk groups interacted with the surface. With one sterile rayon swab stick per surface, the research assistant swabbed the area of the wall in contact with the bed 45 cm high from the level of the bed sheet, all surfaces of the bed rail located in the area near the patients\u2019 head, half of the bed sheet where the patient\u2019s head was including underneath the patient, front and back cover of the patient file and both sides of the multi-purpose towel. Not all patients had a wall or bedrail nearby as some patients were cared for on the floor, due to overcrowding. Swab samples from each surface area were put into individual cryovials containing VTM and kept in a cool box for up to 30 minutes with a temperature between 2\u00b0-8\u00b0C. Both the respiratory swabs and surface swab samples were labelled, packaged, stored in a nitrogen dry shipper (-150\u00b0C) and sent to the icddr,b virology laboratory by batch twice a month.",

The most frequently contaminated surfaces were the bed sheet, towel, and bed rail, further highlighting the perils of no routine surface cleaning practices in these hospitals. Studies in tertiary care hospitals of Bangladesh have shown that one in 20 patients with a hospital stay greater than three days developed a hospital-acquired respiratory infection, and that only 21% of those infections had a viral aetiology, suggesting a large proportion of these infections might be bacterial [21, 22].

A 2004 study in an urban tertiary care hospital in Dhaka, Bangladesh, reported that 40% of the clinical specimens (sputum, pus, urine, throat, and vaginal swabs) collected from hospitalized patients were drug resistant [25]. Moreover, our study findings were consistent between the two hospitals despite being located in different geographical areas and may suggest surface contamination with Klebsiella pneumoniae as a wider public health problem. The predominant bacterial pathogens we identified, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus, can survive on surfaces from a few days to a few months [5, 26, 27]. Bacteria, in the presence of low humidity, forms biofilms protecting microorganisms from harsh environmental influences and are difficult to eradicate [28, 29]. In Bangladesh, hospital surfaces are not adequately cleaned and hospitals report insufficient supplies of cleaning agents [7, 8, 30]. To remove and prevent biofilm formation, hospital decontamination protocols should include strategies such as daily cleaning of surfaces with disinfectant (e.g. 0.3% sodium hypochlorite or 2% chlorhexidine solutions).",

However, our findings were consistent between the two typical tertiary care hospitals we studied, located in completely different parts of the country. A third limitation is that we only sampled surfaces once, which limits our ability to comment on duration of contamination, and did not have the ability to observe contamination from seasonal infections. Influenza, for example, has a known seasonal pattern in Bangladesh, circulating usually between May and September, potentially explaining the low detection rate in our study [34, 35]. Lastly, we did not investigate drug resistance patterns of the bacteria we detected due to resource constraints. Based on evidence from other studies, however, it is likely that many of the pathogens we detected on surfaces were drug resistant and future studies should consider including investigations about drug resistance [25].",

In addition, our data clearly indicate that efforts to regularly disinfect environmental surfaces and ensure clean towels for patient caregiving could reduce risk of exposure to patients, healthcare staff and visitors. The government of Bangladesh has taken a number of initiatives to improve infection control in hospitals [36]. Despite this, a 2013 nationally representative survey of healthcare facilities showed that healthcare workers performed recommended hand hygiene in only 9% of 919 opportunities, suggesting low adherence to international standards [30]. Barriers include awareness, training, accountability and appropriate infrastructure (among 875 health facilities, 10% handwashing locations had no water, 20% had no soap and 50\u201380% had no alcohol based sanitizer) to support these behaviours [30, 37, 38] This study highlighted the gaps in practice, as well as the substantial barriers to improvement that will require widespread investments to address. In 2018, the Directorate of Hospital Infection Control, Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) at the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in Bangladesh has communicated the intention to form infection control committees in each district and tertiary care hospital across the country to improve the safe care [39]. Further investigation to identify the true contribution of fomites in the transmission of respiratory pathogens within hospital settings could be useful to help these committees prioritize efforts to improve hand and surface cleaning.",
