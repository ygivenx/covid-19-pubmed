            "text": "Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is one of the most neglected viruses among biowarfare agents. It is classified as a Category B biothreat pathogen by National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), USA, due to its high dissemination rate, minimal infectious dose to induce disease in human, and the requirement for specific and enhanced diagnostic capacities. VEEV causes disease with symptoms ranging from influenza-like illness to more severe illnesses including myalgia, arthralgia, and neurological disorders that can lead to lethal encephalitis in susceptible hosts. All these characteristics made VEEV an attractive candidate for weaponization (1). VEEV was first isolated from an infected horse brain during a VEEV outbreak in Venezuela in 1938 followed by major outbreaks in Venezuela and Columbia in 1960s (2), infecting thousands of people and animals. Despite its high contagiousness, VEEV has drawn little public attention due to only sporadic outbreaks occurring in Central and South America since 1995. Other reasons for being neglected may be a low mortality rate in humans (<1%) while as high as 90% in horses, as well as no reports of VEEV outbreaks in the US since the only epidemic outbreak in Texas in 1971 (3). However, the spillover of VEEV infection from infected horses to humans during epidemics remains a concern.",

            "text": "VEEV is an arthropod-borne epizootic RNA virus, belonging to the Togaviridae family, genus Alphavirus, and is maintained within lower animals (rodents) and mosquitos (4). The transmission of VEEV is primarily mediated by mosquitoes, where it replicates in salivary glands and is passed to hosts, such as human and horses with overt symptoms (5, 6). Moreover, aerosolized VEEV can be directly disseminated and can infect humans or susceptible experimental animal models, causing encephalitis, and possibly limb paralysis (7\u20139). Historically, since the late 1930s the former Soviet Union regarded VEEV as an operational biological weapon to incapacitate the rear services and reinforcement behind the front line, leading to the spread of the disease among infected individuals with flu-like symptoms that are difficult to distinguish from epidemic influenza outbreaks. Weaponized VEEV was not expected to kill the soldiers, but cause panic and ultimately maim the military targets (10). Notably, there are no effective antiviral agents available and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and only supportive treatment is available for humans. As a result, it is important to establish a preventive surveillance system based on prompt diagnosis methods.",

            "text": "Viral stability is an essential factor for diagnosis of VEEV to confirm the presence of virions or viral RNA in a clinical sample. The current diagnostic approaches to confirm VEEV infection in humans or horses rely on direct detection of viral nucleic acids in serum or spinal fluid samples during the acute-phase of infection using reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) (11) and ELISA for VEEV-specific IgM (12). However, despite high sensitivity of the above-mentioned methods, false negative results can be obtained if samples have been collected during the initial asymptomatic phase of infection where the viral load is low (13\u201315). Moreover, the necessity of extra steps of plasma or serum preparation complicates fast virus identification and diagnostic. Therefore, virus stabilization directly in collected sample without extra preparation steps is highly desirable. Ideally, supplementation of the blood collection device with some type of stabilization agent that can minimize pathogen loss during sample transportation and storage at ambient temperatures is appealing. In view of these challenges, Nanotrap\u00ae (NT) particles were evaluated for their ability to stabilize VEEV. NT particles are hydrogel polymer particles comprised of N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAm), allylamine (AA), and crosslinked with N,N\u2032-methylenbisacrylamide (BIS). These particles are functionalized with various dye affinity baits that facilitate capture and retention of analytes from complex biological matrixes (such as blood, saliva, nasal swabs and urine) and concentrate them into a smaller volume (16\u201320). Previous work with NT particles has shown the benefit of their use in the enrichment of infectious virus and viral genomic material of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), coronavirus, influenza virus, and respiratory syncytia virus (19, 21).",

For example, triazine dyes such as cibacron blue and reactive red 120 bind to proteins through hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions (28). Therefore, the initial step of our study was to screen the panel of magnetic NT particles shown in Table 1, to evaluate their efficacies in enriching VEEV-TC83. NT particles were mixed with blood-spiked VEEV-TC83 (0.5 mg of NT/ml of sample) and incubated for 30 min prior to determination of viral RNA levels by RT-qPCR. We screened 9 different types of NT particles and found that all the NT particles were capable of enriching VEEV, but to different levels (Figures 1A,B). To further confirm and test the limit of capture efficiency of the NT particles, we selected three batches of NT particles shown with the best binding efficiencies and enrichment performance, CN3170, CN3160, and CN3080, and mixed NT particles with the blood-spiked VEEV-TC83 (1.25 mg of NT/ml of sample). All NT particles were capable of enriching VEEV when used at this concentration, but CN3080 showed the most significant enrichment (bound/unbound = ~10, Figure 2A), suggesting that the NT particle conjugated with reactive red 120 chemical bait could be the most suitable for the following experiments. We also compared the ability of CN3080 to a non-magnetic version (CN1030) and found that CN3080 was more effective at capturing VEEV (Supplemental Figure 1).",

The capsid protein is only detected in samples that have been incubated with CN3080, but not in samples without NT particles regardless of whether virus was spiked into blood or plasma (Figure 2B). These data demonstrate the documented ability of NT particles to enrich viral analytes that are below the limit of detection (20). To characterize the performance of CN3080 we utilized various concentrations of CN3080 ranging from samples without NT particles to a 5 mg of NT/ml of sample to determine the optimal concentration for VEEV capsid enrichment and detection. To our surprise, the lower concentrations (up to 1.25 mg of NT/ml of sample) seemed to exhibit the most abundant enrichment, but not higher concentrations like 5 and 2.5 mg of NT/ml of sample (Figure 2C). Next, we tested for the optimal incubation time required for NT particle capture of the majority of virions in a sample. Thus, we measured the viral capsid concentration at different incubation time-points. As early as after 5 min of incubation, VEEV capsid protein was detected and by 15\u201330 min, the capture ability started to reach a saturation level (Figure 2D). These data show that CN3080 magnetic NT particles provide efficient capture of VEEV TC-83 virions over short time periods and the binding efficiency of CN3080 to viral samples can be optimized by adjusting both the incubation time and the NT particle concentration. Based on these data, we chose an incubation time of 30 min and a NT particle concentration of 1.25 mg/ml of sample for the remainder of our experiments to ensure maximal VEEV capture.",

However, the effect of NT in the stabilization of virions in a complex matrix such as whole human blood has never been tested before. Thus, after determination of the best NT composition that is most efficient in capturing VEEV TC-83, our next step was to test stability of the virus in whole blood at ambient and elevated temperatures for extended time periods. For this purpose, we spiked 106 PFU of VEEV-TC83 in 0.5 mL of human whole blood and incubated samples at temperatures of 22, 37, 40, and 54\u00b0C for 0, 24, 48, and 72 h followed by measurement of viral infectivity by plaque assays. We observed a gradual drop of virus titers at 37 and 40\u00b0C, whereas viral infectivity remained relatively consistent at 22\u00b0C (Figure 5A). However, our several attempts to incubate virus at 54\u00b0C for 24 h repeatedly resulted in complete virus inactivation. It should be noted that at 54\u00b0C after 24 h of incubation the blood samples became solidified which made it impossible to completely resuspend samples in buffer for quantitation via plaque assay (Figure 5A). Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that some viral particles were captured by coagulated blood and still remained in the sample. As a result of these finding, for most of the following experiments we focus primarily on 37 and 40\u00b0C temperature conditions.",

However, it should be noted that only once in four repeats did we observed two plaques developed by virus after 72 h of incubation without NT. In contrast, in all four repeats we were able to detect virus-produced plaques (ranging from 2 to 6 plaques per well) if samples were incubated in presence of CN3080.

Reactions based on amplification of the nucleic acid is often used in fatal cases to confirm pathogen presence (5, 19, 31). RT-qPCR is a very reliable method and highly sensitive for the detection of minimal amounts of viral nucleic acids in the patient samples (11). However, this method is based on the detection of relatively short fragments of the viral genome and analysis of a longer stretch of viral RNA (vRNA) would provide a more stringent measure of RNA stability. Thus, we investigated the stability of both long viral RNA (1.5 kb product) by RT-PCR and short vRNA (75 bp) by RT-qPCR. VEEV was spiked in blood and incubated in the presence or absence of CN3080 for the indicated amount of time, followed by RNA purification, cDNA synthesis and PCR or qPCR reactions. Minimal differences in long vRNA levels were observed in samples incubated at 37\u00b0C (Figure 6A). CN3080 overall stabilized long vRNA and increased its detection by RT-PCR especially at higher temperature (40\u00b0C) conditions compared to samples that were incubated without NT particles (Figure 6B). Densitometric analysis of the PCR products indicated preservation of long vRNA in the presence of CN3080 after 72 h of incubation at 40\u00b0C. Likewise, RT-qPCR results indicated preservation of short vRNA after 72 h at 40\u00b0C (Figure 6C).",

Given the difficulty in analysis of blood samples via western blot, these experiments were performed in blood diluted 1:20 with PBS. As a starting point we tested the ability of CN3080 to prevent capsid protein degradation at standard blood storage conditions. For this purpose, we incubated virus with and without CN3080 at 4\u00b0C and assessed by western-blot analysis the amount of capsid protein in the incubated samples. Even though VEEV capsid was overall more stable at 4\u00b0C, we observed a decrease in capsid protein detection by 72 h, which was rescued by incubation with CN3080 (Figure 7A, bottom panel). Western blot analysis of the samples incubated at 37 and 40\u00b0C also demonstrated that only when incubating with CN3080, capsid can be preserved and more available for detection (Figures 7A,B). Thus, NT particles not only profoundly enriched capsid protein in all samples at all temperature conditions but in their presence the capsid protein degradation was significantly reduced at high temperature. Results from the above RT-PCR and protein analyses suggest that CN3080 could efficiently enrich and preserve VEEV RNA and capsid protein against the harsh temperature storage conditions.",

As such, they can bind a range of biomolecules. In our previous studies, we have found that NT particles containing a reactive red 120 affinity bait allows NT particles to capture a wide range of RNA viruses (19, 29). Using the newly developed magnetic NT particles could simplify workflows allowing the isolation of NT particles in 3\u20135 s instead of long centrifugation steps. This processing allows the virions present in clinical samples and bound to NT particles to be easily and quickly separated from body fluids using either manual or automated methods. However, one of the obstacles in pathogen identification in whole blood is the natural abundance of host proteins and red blood cells that prevent direct identification of the pathogen from blood and often require additional preparation steps. Another inconvenience related to working with whole blood or other body fluid sample is a necessity to keep it at low temperatures during transportation. Such obstacles make blood a very difficult matrix for sample preparation and diagnostic analysis. However, despite the existence of the above-mentioned obstacles, we observed efficient separation of VEEV viral particles from blood by NT particles at various temperature and humidity conditions. Moreover, NT particles efficiently preserved infectious VEEV TC-83 at conditions where it was otherwise undetectable.",

            "text": "As much as our NT particle work has shown a significant benefit in preservation and enhancing detection of VEEV virions confirmed by stabilization of viral capsid protein, viral RNA, as well as infectious virions, there are limitations in the use of NT particles. When the environmental conditions are too harsh, the NT particles are only capable of partially alleviating the negative effects. Despite the trend showing more preservative via NT particles, not all viral titers at the later time points exhibited statistical differences, suggesting the preservation of NT particles may not be sufficient to prevent the ultimate decay of virions under the most extreme environmental conditions. Another limitation for the use of NT particles is the difficulty in separating virions from NT particles. We have previously shown very strong binding of RVFV virions to NT particles (19). Working with RVFV we were able to elute only 5.5% from the total virions bound to NT. For this purpose we used sodium chloride in the highest concentration that does not induce virus degradation (2 M), but even this concentration was not enough to completely elute virions from NT. Although strong lysis buffers, such as Trizol reagent and RIPA buffer, can be utilized for precipitating RNA or extracting viral proteins for diagnosis purposes, we have not found a method to elute the virions while retaining the viral infectivity. As shown in our electronic micrograph (Figure 3), a NT particle is potentially bound with dozens of virions, indicating the efficient capturing ability of NT particles. However, the principle of plaque assay is to dilute viral samples until a single virion can form a plaque, so called plaque-forming unit, visualized, and countable by investigators. Overwhelming capture affinity of NT particles to virions is an obstacle for the accuracy of the plaque assay method, which might lead to an underestimation of initial viral titers (Figure 5). Therefore, a better way to elute virions needs to be developed to enable more accurate viral titer determination. One possibility for future testing is to competitively elute VEEV via addition of increasing concentration of the reactive red affinity bait.",
