In March 2009, the novel swine-origin influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (referred throughout as H1N1) was reported in Mexico causing great fear in countries worldwide [2], [3]. The spread in Europe was however slower than expected [4]. In Sweden, the first sporadic cases were diagnosed in May 2009 and not until October, after a smaller peak in July and August, the reported cases increased to peak in November 2009 [5]. Sweden was one of the countries that adopted countrywide vaccination against H1N1 reaching a coverage of approximately 60% of the population, with the first doses distributed in the middle of October 2009, and vaccination may have contributed to the rapid decline in reported cases in December [6].",

Also in Norway and France, high PCR detection ratio of HRV in early autumn before the spread of H1N1 was reported [8], [9], but the hypothesis of viral interference between H1N1 and HRV has been contradicted in studies from Italy and USA [10], [11]. Viral interference refers to that infections with one virus affect the spread of other viruses reflecting either an epidemiological or a biological interaction, which in turn could be due to a cellular or immunological mechanism [7], [12], [13]. Although the H1N1 pandemic has been extensively investigated there are limited studies that have assessed viral co-infections over time and their importance in severity of disease during the pandemic.",

The samples were extracted with MagAttract Virus Mini M48 kit (Qiagen) in a BioRobot M48 instrument and analyzed by an in-house real-time PCR with a virus panel including the following 16 viruses: influenza A seasonal (FluA) as well as influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (H1N1), influenza B (FluB), human adenovirus (HAdV), human rhinovirus (HRV), parainfluenzavirus 1\u20133 (PIV1-3), human bocavirus (HBoV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human enterovirus (HEV) and coronavirus serotypes 229E, HKU1, NL63 and OC43 (HCoV) as previously described [15]. The PCR was mainly based on separate single PCRs, however duplex PCR was used for PIV1 and PIV3 and for PIV2 and HCoV-229E. The assay was limited at distinguishing HRV-RNA from HEV-RNA due to cross-reactivity [15]. Detection of both HEV and HRV was determined as only HRV positive if the cycle threshold value (Ct-value) for HRV was at least 5 cycles lower than for HEV. If HEV and HRV were found at equally high reactivity (\u0394Ct-values <5), the infection was clinically determined as HRV when the predominant symptoms were respiratory tract infection and as only HEV when the predominant symptoms were fever and malaise with clinical suspicion of encephalitis or if HEV was also detected in stool or cerebrospinal fluid. If only a smaller virus panel including H1N1, FluA, FluB and RSV was initially performed, the analyses were complemented for the other viruses.

Although the retrospective study design has limitations with clinical data not being systematically collected, the strength of the study was the uniquely high sampling coverage with extended viral PCR-analyses in admitted children, as a result of the hospital policy during the H1N1 pandemic. The study thus provides a rather complete assessment of the viral panorama in hospitalized children with ILI in Northern Stockholm during this six-month period.

Detection of additional viruses in H1N1-positive children were, as opposed to previous findings [11], [20], not associated with the severity of disease. One explanation could be the low rate of RSV infections in our material since the study period included only the beginning of the RSV season and hence none of the H1N1-positive children were co-infected with RSV. In South America the two epidemics of H1N1 and RSV coincided with a reported high morbidity and a high frequency of severe disease [20]. Unfortunately, bacterial cultures where not systematically performed during the study period.
