            "text": "In the last decades several viral discovery methods have been developed which can\ndetect viruses without knowledge of the genome sequence. We have previously used\nvirus discovery cDNA-AFLP (VIDISCA) to discover the human coronavirus NL63\n(HCoV-NL63) [6] and we were the first to describe human parechovirus type\n5 and 6 in the Netherlands using the same technique [7]. In the VIDISCA assay viral\ngenomes (which are (reverse-) transcribed into double stranded DNA) are digested\nwith restriction enzymes. The enzymes digest short (4 nucleotides) recognition\nsequences that are present in virtually all viruses. After ligation of adaptors, the\ndigested fragments are PCR amplified with adaptor-specific primers. The assay is\nuser-friendly however the sensitivity of the assay is low. At least 1 E6 genome\ncopies/ml of a virus in a background that is low in competitor RNA/DNA are needed.\nThese conditions are generally only met when virus culture supernatant is used. In\nclinical respiratory samples like nasopharyngeal swabs in universal transport medium\n(UTM) various amounts of competitor RNA/DNA from disrupted cells/bacteria can be\npresent. Ribosomal RNA, which is \u223c80% of the total cellular RNA, is one\nof the biggest problems due to its high copy number and its stability within\nribosomes. In particular RNA viruses are difficult to discover since in these cases\na reverse transcription is needed, which will enable rRNA to act as competiting\nnucleic acid sequences.",

Both samples contained high\nconcentrations of rRNA. The samples were reverse transcribed with either the\ncomplete set of hexamers or the non-rRNA-hexamers. With non-rRNA-hexamers\nsubstantially lower amounts of rRNA-derived cDNA was generated with on\naverage more than 1 log decrease, compared to the samples treated with\nrandom hexamers (see table\n1). We observed that the decreased cDNA synthesis on the\n3700-region of 28S rRNA and 1000-region of 18S rRNA was considerable\n(\u223c3,5 Ct = 1 log), however, not as strong as the\ndecrease at regions 40\u2013110 and 1780\u20131880 of 28S rRNA (almost 2\nlog decrease, table\n1). Inspecting the non-rRNA-hexamers revealed that this phenomenon\ncan be explained by residual priming by the non-rRNA-hexamers. Although the\nprimers are designed to anneal not or hardly to rRNA, some do perfectly\nmatch with human rRNA, especially in the region 3800 to 4000 (position 3803,\n3840, 4040), and the same for 18S rRNA region 1100 till 1200 (position 1121,\n1123, 1134, 1185, 1187, 1207). However, in the regions where we show strong\ndecrease in rRNA cDNA synthesis (40\u2013110 128S rRNA and 1780\u20131880\n18S rRNA), non-rRNA-hexamer can not anneal at the 3\u2032site at close\nvicinity (position 1613 and 2272 respectively). One might suggest expelling\nthe 8 hexamers that anneal at the abovementioned locations to further\nenhance the benefit of non-rRNA cDNA synthesis. However, Endoh et al\ndesigned the non-ribosomal hexamers such that amplification of viruses is\nnot hampered, therefore we recommend using all 96 Endoh-designed non-rRNA\nhexamers.",

            "text": "There are several advantages of high throughput sequencing in comparison to BigDye\nterminator sequencing. First of all, with high throughput sequencing and pooling of\nsamples that carry their own recognition sequence the VIDISCA cost per sample is\nreduced, since selective VIDISCA-PCR, metaphor agarose gel visualization,\npurification of fragments from gel, TA cloning, colony PCR and subsequent BigDye\nsequencing can all be omitted. Secondly, the amount of sequence data received from a\nsingle sample is higher than what can be achieved in standard VIDSCA, thus\nincreasing the chances of identifying an unknown virus. This method opens new\nopportunities for virus discovery, not only in respiratory samples of undiagnosed\nrespiratory infection, but also in diseases such as Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\n(ALS), Kawasaki disease (KD) and Multiple sclerosis (MS). For these syndromes a\nviral pathogen has been suggested [17]\u2013[19] but could not be confirmed so far. With VIDISCA-454 it is\nnow possible to investigate samples from these patients for unknown viruses.",
