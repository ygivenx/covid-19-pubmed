The structural determination begins with acquisition of projection images in an electron-microscope. A major part of data processing is aimed at determining the direction of projection for each particle image (2D projection of virus) so that a 3D reconstruction can be computed. The first step in a virus reconstruction is the detection and selection of the individual particle images from a large area of an electron micrograph.",

One criterion is based on the computational search of the common lines in the computed Fourier Transforms of individual or multiple particle images [1]. An improvement of the Fourier Common Line algorithm [2] has been proposed, but a significant amount of the low contrast particle images are still discarded, partly because of the impossibility of obtaining a reliable estimate of their orientations. Another criterion for the particle orientation estimate is to find the correlation match between the raw images with many projections from a 3D model [3]. Regardless of the criterion used, finding the orientation determination for a particle image such as that in Fig. 1a is difficult because of its extremely low contrast.",

The initial orientations are then assigned to the corresponding particles in the close-to-focus images for structural refinement (henceforth, called focal pair method). In a high resolution structure determination, one would require over 6000 particles of data for 8.5 \u00c5 resolutions [6]. If a focal pair is required, one would need over 12,000 particles and hence it is a labor-intensive process of data recording, digitization and archiving. In this paper, we propose a method for determining the initial orientations of the particles from low contrast (close-to-focus) images without necessity for a second set of highly defocused images. In this technique, we use the wavelet transformation in a multi-resolution analysis [7,8] to enhance the contrast of the image and the hierarchical weighted projection matching to accelerate the processing. The wavelet-transformed images have the same size as the original images. Wavelet decomposition separates the low-resolution information, called \"approximation\", from the high resolution information, called \"details\". This method computationally generates an image equivalent to the far-from-focus picture taken by the microscope and separates images containing details and noise. The technique proposed here is a model-based approach in wavelet space, which we call Hierarchical Wavelet Projection Matching (HWPM).",

A grid sampling of 0.5\u00b0 in each direction of the asymmetric triangle of icosahedral particles was used. The number of projections obtained with this grid was relatively high (2616 projections).

The hierarchical implementation wavelet projection matching reduced the time at least by a factor of 10 compared with the classical projection matching method.

A comparison with the focal pair method (Fig. 5.a), which is currently the most appropriate method for low contrast virus images was accomplished. The following steps were executed. First the initial orientations of the far-from focus particles were determined by using the cross-common line method between real particles and a set of projections obtained from the low resolution model. Next, a global refinement process was realized in order to determine the initial orientation. The same software as in [4] was used with the same initial parameters. The parameters used in this software were the minimum radius and maximum radius limiting the resolution and the sampling step size of 4.67\u00c5/pixel. The minimum valid radius ensured that the minimal radius was computationally accurate when the two common lines angles were close and also to avoid the biasing of the orientations of particles by the very low frequency components. This parameter choice for herpes at the above sampling step was 5 pixels. The maximum radius was chosen to limit the maximum resolution expected from the reconstruction, here in the initial orientation the maximum radius corresponding to a resolution about 40 \u00c5. Then an assignment of the particle orientations from the far to focus to the close to focus is realized. Next, an iterative refinement process to the close-to-focus data was accomplished as described in [5]. A 3D reconstruction using the best 300 HSV-1 particle orientations was performed for each method. Fig. 5.a and Fig. 5.b show surfaces density contour, displayed at one standard deviation above the mean density [9], obtained respectively from focal pair method and HWPM method. Both structures show a similar visual resemblance. In order to assess the reliability of the 3D density maps and the quality of particles orientations obtained from each method, the Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) criterion, which is the most robust criterion [10,11], was employed. The FSC was calculated between 2 independent reconstructions from the same set of orientations for each method. The effective resolution assessment of the 3D structure obtained from each method is estimated at FSC correlation value of 0.5, which correspond to 45\u00b0 phase difference.",

Recently, a method using polar transformation and projection matching were used for the purpose of orientation determination [3], but this last method is not suitable for the high resolution of large virus because the resulting transformed images, could be double the size of the original image. The proposed method combines the projection matching of wavelet denoising for an initial determination of particle orientation, with the common lines method for refinement to a higher resolution. It is clear that HWPM method works only if the initial low resolution model of the particle is already known. This method is very interesting if we need to add more particles to an existing intermediate resolution reconstruction in order to increase the resolution. Particles having high resolution information are very noisy [9,14]. The best that we can get using the ICL method is less than 40 % of good orientations, for defocus values between 1.9 \u03bcm and 1.2 \u03bcm, for the P22 capsid [2]. Usually, very high resolutions use defocus values which go much lower than 1.2 \u03bcm as in the HSV data, or the current P22 data which goes to 0.5 \u03bcm. The 40% rate of correct orientations would certainly become smaller if we used data at closer defocus. The study accomplished on high resolution for HSV reconstruction showed that using a close-to-focus single micrograph with CL method was not effective, because a small number of orientations were found to be correct [9], for this reason a focal pair method was used for 8.5 \u00c5 structure[9].",

The focal pair method, for intermediate resolution up to (8 \u00c5) for big viruses like HSV, works well for orientations determinations. The number of particles selected for the final reconstruction about 40% of the original number of particles (taking into account the far-focus and close-focus micrographs). It is necessary to emphasize that results from both methods are very similar in terms of visual resemblance. But, there are two advantages of HWPM over the focal pair method. First, focal pair method uses as much as double the data used for the HWPM. Second, the quality of the density maps shows that HWPM gives a better resolution for the same number of particles (figure 6). This proves a better accuracy of orientations determinations obtained by the HWPM.",

The probable reasons why the ICL method did not work properly for the P22 capsid are: first the P22 capsid has a smooth surface (the thickness of the shell is about 40 \u00c5); second most of the data are very close-to-focus with defocus range of 0.5 \u03bcm to 1.3 \u03bcm. The data was noisy and had a very low contrast.

This method is based on wavelet filtering, which enhances the contrast of the particles and reduces the noise, and on weighted projection matching in wavelet space. A hierarchical implementation of this method increases the speed of orientation determination. Results show that, HWPM have been able to determine accurately more than 85% of the orientations of low-contrast particles. Compared to the focal pair method (for orientation determination from low contrast data) the HWPM reduced the amount of data required in a reconstruction by at least 50 %. In addition the accuracy of the orientations obtained by the proposed method is higher than those obtained by focal pair method [9]. This improved accuracy is shown clearly by the resolution assessment in Fig. 6. The estimated number of particles needed for a 6.5 \u00c5 reconstruction of the HSV-1 capsid was about 50,000 [14]. By using the HWPM method, only half as much data was necessary. The proposed method could save 2 to 3 man-years invested in acquiring images from the microscope and data processing. Another advantage of this method is the ability to give accurate orientations for some particles having conformational changes or alteration of symmetry as seen for VP5-VP19C recombinant and recently with the low PH sindbis capsid.",

The level of wavelet decomposition depends on the dimension of the virus and the sampling rate. For herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) B-capsid, which has a diameter of 1250 \u00c5 with a sampling of 2.1 \u00c5/pixel, a level two of wavelet decomposition (Fig. 2) is appropriate for the initial orientation estimate, because of the contrast enhancement and the consideration of computational speed. The method starts by generating the wavelet decomposition at level two for each projection and raw image. In order to have accurate orientation estimation a small angular grid (figure 3) to generate projections from the initial model is needed, and this results in a large number of projections. The classical projection matching, which consists of comparing the wavelet-transformed raw images with every projection, is very slow even when using multiple processors on a parallel computer. In order to significantly increase the speed of processing, a hierarchical implementation is performed. This consists of grouping projections into classes of similar orientations [30]. Fig. 3 shows the classification scheme applied for the icosahedral viruses, only an asymmetric triangle representing the possible orientations for icosahedrally symmetric object [4] is considered.",

Next, the orientation of the projection yielding the highest wccf will be assigned to the raw image as the correct orientation.
