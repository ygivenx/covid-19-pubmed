            "text": "Rift valley fever (RVF) is one of numerous zoonotic diseases affecting human and livestock health in Africa, and has previously spread to the Arabian Peninsula [1,2]. The disease is caused by a mosquito-borne, negative-stranded RNA virus of the Bunyaviridae family, RVF virus, that was first isolated in 1930 from sheep on a Kenyan farm [3]. RVF virus can infect a wide range of domestic and wild animals, but pathology is most severe in sheep where almost 100% mortality and abortion rates occur in newborn lambs and pregnant ewes, respectively [3]. In humans, RVF primarily occurs following close contact with infected animal tissue or body fluids and presents as a mild febrile illness that sometimes progresses to more severe, fatal manifestations such as encephalitis and hemorrhage. Although a highly effective live-attenuated vaccine known as Clone 13 [4] is available for livestock use in RVF-endemic countries, no licensed livestock vaccines are available for use in RVF-free areas such as Europe and there is currently no licensed human RVF vaccine.",

These virus-neutralizing antibodies mainly target the Gn and Gc envelope glycoproteins (of which there is only one serotype) encoded in the M segment of the RVF virus genome [9-11]. Subunit vaccines incorporating one or both glycoproteins can induce a virus-neutralizing response that may confer complete protection from experimental RVF viral challenge in rodents and livestock (reviewed in [12]). Thus, development of Gn and Gc-based vaccines utilizing vectors with an established human safety profile could be a promising strategy for a future human RVF vaccine.",

These studies have highlighted the excellent safety and immunogenicity profile of adenovirus vectors in humans, with similar properties observed in several animal species (including those susceptible to RVF) where adenovirus-vectored vaccines have been tested against multiple diseases [18-27]. Development of an effective adenovirus-vectored RVF vaccine may therefore provide a prophylactic tool that could be used not only in humans, but also in the animal species susceptible to RVF.",

The ChAdOx1 vector, unlike the widely tested human adenovirus type 5 (HAdV5) vector, is not affected by significant pre-existing anti-vector immunity that may limit vaccine performance in the human population [28]. Though ChAdOx1 is phylogenetically classified as a Human adenovirus E, its serotype is distinct from HAdV5 (a Human adenovirus C) [28-30], meaning that anti-vector immunity to HAdV5 cannot dampen the potency of a ChAdOx1-vectored vaccine.

Matrix-M\u2122 is a saponin-based adjuvant developed for human use [32], whereas AddaVax\u2122 is a squalene-based oil-in-water emulsion whose formulation is similar to the MF59\u00ae adjuvant licensed for human influenza vaccines [33].

However, the relative role of different T cell phenotypes in the BALB/c mouse model remains unknown. Here, we find that ChAdOx1-GnGc and HAdV5-GnGc vaccines can readily induce an RVF virus glycoprotein-specific CD8+ T cell response in BALB/c mice, as has been observed in a recent study using DNA and modified vaccinia virus Ankara-vectored Gn-Gc vaccines [44]. The robust immunogenicity of both ChAdOx1-GnGc and HAdV5-GnGc for RVF virus neutralizing antibodies and for CD8+ T cells presents an opportunity for dissecting the relative contribution of CD8+ T cells to protective immunity against RVF in the BALB/c mouse model.",

Both adjuvants improved the RVF virus neutralizing antibody response induced by ChAdOx1-GnGc, but not HAdV5-GnGc. However, neither significantly enhanced the vaccine-induced T cell response to ChAdOx1-GnGc but co-administration of HAdV5-GnGc with AddaVax\u2122 resulted in an increase in the frequency of CD8+ IFN\u03b3+ and CD8+ TNF\u03b1+ T cells. These findings may suggest that Matrix-M\u2122 and AddaVax\u2122 could be generally useful for antibody induction by other chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccines, and AddaVax\u2122 for T cell induction by HAdV5-vectored vaccines, but this requires further study. The greatest enhancement in ChAdOx1-GnGc-induced virus neutralizing antibody titers was with Matrix-M\u2122 adjuvant, which is licensed for both human and animal use. Future studies in livestock will be invaluable in determining whether Matrix-M\u2122 adjuvant enhances the magnitude and longevity of the RVF virus neutralizing antibody response induced by ChAdOx1-GnGc, ultimately informing the design of subsequent human clinical trials of ChAdOx1-GnGc.",
