CoVs consist of 4 genera and have been identified in a wide range of animals and in humans. Members of the Alphacoronavirus (\u03b1-CoV) and Betacoronavirus (\u03b2-CoV) infect mammals, and members of the Gammacoronavirus (\u03b3-CoV) and Deltacoronavirus (\u03b4-CoV) mainly infect avian species [2\u20134]. As important etiological agents, CoVs have been recognized in human and animals and cause upper respiratory diseases in most cases. To date, 6 human CoVs were discovered: 4 of them (HCoV-229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1) mainly cause mild respiratory diseases, and the other 2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) cause severe respiratory diseases [5, 6].",

Although murine hepatitis virus (MHV) has been used as a model to study CoV for a long time, limited information is available regarding the prevalence and diversity of rodent CoVs [15\u201318]. Recently, several novel \u03b1-CoVs and \u03b2-CoVs (LRNV, LAMV, LRLV, and HKU24) were identified in rodents in China and Europe [19\u201321]. These discoveries suggested that rodents may carry diverse, unrecognized CoVs [22]. In the present study, we describe the first discovery of CoVs in 3 different rodent species in the Yunnan Province of China and report a much higher (21.4%) detection rate of CoV nucleic acid in A. chevrieri than in other rodent species studied previously (<5%) [19, 20]. In addition, this is the first report of finding \u03b1-CoV and \u03b2-CoV in the same rodent species in China.",

Standard precautions were taken to avoid PCR contamination, and no false positives were observed in the negative controls. To determine the heterogeneity of the amplicons, we inspected the sequencing chromatograms. No overlapping multicolor peaks were found, indicating that no CoV co-infection occurred in the animals examined in this study. To confirm the PCR results, positive samples were verified by performing two independent PCRs. The CoV-positive samples were named using the rodent species name, the location (Jianchuan County), and the sample number.

Two cleavage sites, one located at residue 508 at the S1/S2 interface (RRAR/AR), and the other located at residue 674 (R/S) at the S2\u2032 position, were predicted by comparing aa sequences based on analysis with a web-based ProP program (Additional file 1: Figure S2).

During previous decades of research, different tissue tropisms of rodent CoVs have been observed. As the prototype of rodent CoVs, different MHV strains can infect variant tissues, and the A59 strain is primarily hepatotropic, but the JHM strain is neurotropic [15\u201318]. RCoV and a strain of sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV) both primarily infect the respiratory tract [34]. However, the tropisms of recently identified rodent CoVs from China and Europe have not been confirmed. A CoV in lineage A of \u03b2-CoV detected in the alimentary tract samples of Norway rats, HKU24, probably has enteric tropism [20]. Another cluster of \u03b1-CoVs (PLMg1, UKMa2, UKMa1, and UKRn1) were only detected in liver samples of Norway rats, the bank vole, the wood mouse, and the noncyclic field vole, suggesting that they are hepatotropic [21]. Additional research identified rodent \u03b1-CoV LRNV and \u03b2-CoVs LAMV and LRLV, which came from diverse tissue types that made it difficult to predict the tissue tropism of these viruses [19]. Nonetheless, the extensively studied rodent CoVs (MHV and RCoV) could lead to severe or mild diseases in their hosts. Further studies are needed to determine the potential pathogenicity of AcCoV-JC34 along with other recently detected rodent CoVs.",

The ORF3 protein of AcCoV-JC34 possessed 30 to 78% aa sequence identity with the homologous proteins encoded by other \u03b1-CoVs. This protein has variant names in different CoVs and was named ORF4 protein in human coronavirus 229E [35], non-structural protein 3 in human coronavirus NL63 [36], 3c-like protein or non-structural protein 3c in ferret coronavirus, 3c protein in feline coronavirus [37], 3b protein in transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) [38], and ORF3 protein in porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) [39]. Normally, the ORF3 protein was considered as an accessory non-structural protein, but several studies showed that the ORF3 protein was a membrane protein related to virulence [35, 37, 38, 40]. However, with low similarities between the ORF3 of AcCoV-JC34 and previously studied proteins, more experiments are needed to understand its function.",

In different CoVs, the RBD can be located at the NTD or CTD in S1. For example, among the \u03b1-CoVs, CTD was characterized as RBD in HCoV NL63 (aa 476\u2013616), 229E (aa 417\u2013547), and PEDV [41\u201344], but the NTD was characterized as an RBD in the TGEV [45]. Here, the S1 of AcCoV-JC34 shared <20% aa sequence identity with those of very well characterized \u03b1-CoVs, which made it difficult to predict whether the RBD was located in NTD or CTD and which host molecule could be the possible receptor for AcCoV-JC34. The S2 of AcCoV-JC34 showed 40 to 50% identity to that of \u03b2-CoVs. By sequence alignment and SWISS-MODEL analysis (data not shown), we deduced the precise positions of FH, HR1, and HR2. The higher similarities between S2 of AcCoV-JC34 (HKU2) and \u03b2-CoVs than that to \u03b1-CoVs suggested that the structure and functional mechanism of S2 of AcCoV-JC34 may more homologous to \u03b2-CoVs.",

Previous data indicated that bats are natural reservoirs for \u03b1- and \u03b2-CoVs [46]. A number of human CoVs, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV229E, and NL63 might have originated from bats [47, 48]. Among the rodent CoVs, the receptor usage, tissue tropism, and pathogenesis of MHV have been studied in detail [49]. However, novel CoVs, like AcCoV-JC34, HKU24, LRNV, LAMV, and LRLV are not fully understood. Identification of the receptor for these viruses could help in evaluating the potential host range and ability for interspecies transmission from rodents to other mammals. Although most of these novel rodent CoVs have been characterized with full-length or near full-length genome sequences, the lack of successfully isolating those viruses thoroughly restricts future studies. More positive samples and cell lines will facilitate viral culture in the future. In addition, more attention should be paid to the diversity of CoVs in rodent, which could help to better understand the role of rodents in the evolution and ecology of CoVs.",
