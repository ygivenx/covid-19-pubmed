Two viruses were more common than influenza in community-ARI, with 37 (28.5%) episodes positive for rhinoviruses and 13 (10.0%) for coronaviruses (Table 2). There were no co-infections detected by MRT-PCR in either community-ARI episodes or influenza negative inpatient-ARI. However, 5 influenza positive inpatient-ARI episodes were positive for more than one pathogen, including 4 dual-pathogen (influenza A + influenza B [2], influenza A + rhinovirus, and influenza B + respiratory syncytial virus) and 1 triple-pathogen (influenza A + adenovirus + Coronavirus) episodes. Another 46 inpatient-ARI episodes were positive only for one influenza type/subtype; 23(50.0%), 9(19.6%) and 14(30.4%) of these episodes were influenza A(H3N2), influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B respectively. After excluding episodes with multiple pathogens, only 24 inpatient-ARI episodes were positive for non-influenza panel viruses, with 8 (33.3%) and 7 (29.2%) of these being rhinoviruses and coronaviruses respectively; another 70 episodes were negative for all panel viruses. The ratio of influenza negative to influenza positive episodes was 1.8:1, which reflected the intention of our study design to sample non-influenza to influenza episodes in an approximately 2:1 ratio. However, in routinely ordered diagnostic tests for influenza conducted on 6281 TTSH admission episodes during the study period, 11.0% tested positive (354A(H3N2), 118A(H1N1)pdm09, 176 influenza B and 40 influenza A with undefined subtype detected). Using this to adjust for the effect of our inpatient-ARI sampling strategy, we estimated that only 18.0% of inpatient-ARI were positive for a non-influenza virus, and an estimated 71.0% would be negative for all panel viruses, as compared to 46.2% for community-ARI.",

The SRT-PCR Ct values also increased with days post-onset in both groups, but the Ct value for community samples increased more sharply than for the inpatients. The GEE model suggested that inpatient-ARI had a higher starting Ct value than community-ARI (P = 0.002, Table 3). Ct value increased as days post-onset increased (P < 0.001), but the increase in Ct value with every additional day post-onset for inpatient-ARI was lesser than that for community-ARI (P < 0.001 for interaction term between participant type and days post episode onset). For non-influenza panel virus episodes, changes in the proportion of positive samples showed no consistent pattern by days post-onset in both community-ARI and inpatient-ARI (Fig. 1C,D).",

None of the respiratory symptoms assessed were significantly more common in influenza, and for mild-ARI, sore throat and runny nose were significantly less common in those testing positive for influenza (Table 4).

For instance, in those aged <60 years, severe influenza was significantly more likely than mild influenza to meet ILI-W criteria (68.6% vs 48.6% respectively, p = 0.018), but non-influenza causes of severe-ARI were also more likely to have febrile presentations, with 32.6% meeting ILI-W criteria (vs 8.9% for non-influenza mild-ARI, p < 0.001).

Post episode onset, the proportion positive for influenza decreased (Ct value increased) faster in community-ARI as compared to inpatient-ARI, but no such pattern was observed for non-influenza panel viruses; likewise, others have found slower viral clearance in inpatients compared to outpatients for influenza A(H1N1)pdm0921, and a lack of association between days post-onset and Ct values for adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus 1\u2013322.

In contrast to multiplexed PCR-based technologies which rely on a set of primers that target a finite number of specific pathogens, the PathChip is designed to detect a wide array of pathogens simultaneously by detecting signatures in the pathogen genome sequences. While costly, our results suggests that it has the potential to complement existing technologies as a diagnostic tool. Sim\u00f5es et al previously evaluated the diagnostic value of the PathChip using paediatric nasal wash samples and reported variable sensitivity ranging from 30.8% to 95.0% and reasonable specificity from 88.4% to 100%18. In our study, the PathChip was a valuable addition in community-ARI where it substantially increased the proportion positive for respiratory etiological agents, so that only about 20% of febrile episodes did not have a viral aetiology identified. Notably, the vast majority of additional viruses detected were those known to cause ARI. It may thus help in ruling out more sinister causes of ARI if added to MRT-PCR for surveillance in community settings; it may also help detect unexpected but dangerous infections such as SARS and MERS-CoV following further validation on actual patient samples with such infections. However, due to the high cost of the assay (about four times MRT-PCR) and the imperfect sensitivity for some pathogens (as low as 30.8% for adenovirus), we opted to test only the RT-PCR negative samples with the PathChip. As such, we are unable to comment on its sensitivity for samples from adults, which may be inferior to the previously published results which used samples from paediatric subjects, who are known to have higher viral loads for some viruses2324. However, given its current cost, variable sensitivity and slower turn-around time as compared to MRT-PCR (about 20 hours for PathChip), we believe this technology is most appropriately used in the way we designed our study, which is to detect additional respiratory viral pathogen positive episodes as an adjunct to more widely available MRT-PCR panels designed to cover the most common pathogens from community-based samples.",

            "text": "Finally, our study highlights how the same clinical case definitions, which have been used in both community11 and inpatient settings25, may actually perform differently in the two settings for distinguishing influenza from other respiratory infections, identifying influenza cases, and increasing the yield of diagnostic assays. We found that, while respiratory symptoms themselves are poor in distinguishing influenza from other ARI causes, clinical case definitions using fever or temperature cut-off points demonstrated good discriminatory value in our mild-ARI episodes, which should reflect what can be anticipated in primary care settings. However, for ARI severe enough to require hospitalisation, the case definitions had poorer discriminatory value. This was partly because, while a good majority of older individuals (87.2%) with severe influenza had self-reported fever (as in FRI), only about half met the temperature criteria used for ILI case definitions (Table 5). The use of such high temperature cut-off points would hence substantially reduce sensitivity for detecting influenza in the elderly. Also, non-influenza episodes in ARI severe enough to require hospitalization are more likely to also have a higher temperature than non-influenza episodes in mild ARI; this further reduces the ability of ILI case definitions to distinguish influenza from other respiratory causes in the inpatient setting. The choice of an appropriate case definition hence depends on the objectives and setting of the application. If the aim is to diagnose as many influenza cases as possible (e.g. for identifying patients for antiviral treatment or outbreak management), ILI case definitions have inadequate sensitivity, particularly in older age groups. However, the discriminatory value of ILI criteria finds application when aiming to reduce background noise during syndromic surveillance, either in community type settings or even a healthcare worker population26. The ILI case definitions are also useful for optimizing the yield of influenza viruses from samples tested, and particularly efficient in settings where milder ARI presentations are encountered (Fig. 2A); and if the aim is to identify all types of respiratory viruses for surveillance, ILI criteria would also modestly improve the probability of obtaining a positive result as compared to sampling all ARI in both mild as well as severe presentations (Fig. 2B,D).",

While not ideal, Supplementary Table S1 suggests that influenza cases from this historical dataset which were classified as mild were reasonably similar to those from the community cohort, and likewise those classified as severe were similar to those from the later inpatient study. A sensitivity analysis without the influenza cases from our historical dataset gave a similar result. However, even with these additional influenza cases, the numbers remained inadequate to assess the performance of the case definitions for mild influenza in older age groups, and we are also unable to assess performance in paediatric subjects. Secondly, the panel of viruses tested on the multiplex PCR assay was not comprehensive; while this was supplemented by the PathChip, there is no means of ascertaining what proportion of the remaining ARI episodes are truly not due to an infectious viral aetiology. We also recognise that our study population, in particular the community cohort, may not be representative of the general community, which was further complicated by fluctuations in the rate at which participants notified us of ARI episodes, as well as intra-seasonal variations within each year and sporadic outbreaks of particular respiratory pathogens27.",
