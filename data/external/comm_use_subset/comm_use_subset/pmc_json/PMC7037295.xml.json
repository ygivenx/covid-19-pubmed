When people communicate in forums or discussion groups, fierce disputes or mutual affirmation of different views will lead to the popularity of public opinion and generate one or more extreme attitude values, which are called public opinion polarization. Generally speaking, the effective usage of public opinion polarization can improve the public\u2019s trust in government, and also increase customer loyalty to enterprises [1]. For example, in the Spring Festival of 2020, when China\u2019s novel coronavirus broke out, the Henan provincial government acted decisively and responded effectively. Soon afterwards, topics such as \u201cHow to Steal the Governor of Henan Province\u201d and \u201cHenan Province hand over the full score answer sheet\u201d appeared in the network to occupy the top of the hot search list, which greatly enhanced the credibility of the Henan provincial government. However, since every coin has two sides, the phenomenon of public opinion polarization also easily results in network violence and even extends such behavior from online to offline, such as sit-downs, protest marches, and other social group behaviors that are not conducive to social stability. As a result, research on the emergence mechanism of public opinion polarization is of important theoretical and practical significance.",

            "text": "At present, there are relatively few studies on the public opinion polarization, and most of them mainly adopt methods such as macro statistics [2] or mathematical modeling [3,4] to analyze the main characteristics of the formation and propagation of polarization phenomena at the macro level. However, these methods generally lack studies on the interaction mechanism of micro individuals. In fact, only by fully exploring the internal driving force for individuals to participate in the interaction of views in the network, as well as analyzing the direct reasons behind their decision-making behaviors, can the internal mechanism of polarization phenomenon be further understood. In the process of micro-individual interactions, every individual is different, which makes him/her have different social preferences. These differentiated social preferences will bring different revenues for individuals to participate in the interactions, thus prompting them to take different interactive behaviors driven by revenues, and ultimately affecting public opinion polarization on the whole network. Currently, the social preference theory [5,6] has widely applied to individual behavioral decisions in the field of social and economic activities but is rarely used in the field of public opinion evolution. In this paper, we introduce the social preference theory and build a public opinion polarization model for analyzing individual interaction behavior from the perspective of gain for different individuals. As far as we know, it is the first time that the social preference theory has been adopted for public opinion polarization. Subsequently, the effects of different social preferences, network structure, and individual revenues on public opinion polarization are explored by simulation experiments and some observations are obtained through simulation experiments. Finally, the practicability and effectiveness of the proposed model are verified by a real case.",

            "text": "For research on group polarization, Professor Sunstein [1] proposed in 2002 that if there was some bias in the opinions of group members at the beginning, such bias would be strengthened after discussion, and finally, an extreme opinion would be formed, which is the public opinion polarization. Subsequently, many scholars have also studied the phenomenon of public opinion polarization and have made some achievements. For example, Liu et al. [7] studied the overconfidence problem in viewpoint interactions among different individuals in 2019 and proposed that overconfidence would have a negative impact on large-scale group decision-making and reduce the consistency of decision-making. In 2017, Dong et al. [8] explored the issue of consensus under the guidance of multiple leaders and found that the dynamic change process of leaders could promote public opinion polarization. Dandekar et al. [9] proposed in 2013 that if individuals in the network had enough prejudice at the initial moment, such prejudice would lead to public opinion polarization after a lot of interactions. Etesami and Basar [10] studied the public opinion polarization phenomenon in high dimensions in 2014 and found that whether it forms single polarization, bi-polarization, or multi-polarization depended on the openness of the mind. In 2013, Li et al. [11] discussed the internal characteristics of the gradual shift of public opinion from bi-polarization to single polarization by analyzing its convergence characteristics. Leon-Medini [12] established a new multi-agent model to study the final trend of public opinion evolution in 2019. In 2017, by comparing networks with different structures, Li and Xiao [13] found that the increase of average network would raise the polarization degree, and the viewpoints of different dimensions would affect each other in the network evolution, thus reducing the polarization phenomenon. In 2019, Chen et al. [14] considered the influence of heterogeneous individuals in the network on the public opinion polarization, and also introduced the concept of dynamic conformity to discuss the influence of \u201csilent spiral\u201d phenomenon on the polarization of public opinion. However, the driving force for individuals to participate in the interaction was not considered in the above paper.",

However, studies are rarely related to individual interaction mechanisms at the micro level. Due to the complexity of netizens, there are many influence factors involved in their interactions, so quantitative analysis is difficult to deal with in this issue. Considering that every individual is driven by revenue during interactions, individuals are only willing to engage in perspective interactions when they can obtain certain benefits. Individuals with different social preferences have diverse benefits from each interaction. Based on this, the benefits brought by different preferences can explain the essential motivations of the different behavior choices of individuals in public opinion communication. Therefore, it is of great practical significance to use the social preference theory to study the public opinion polarization phenomenon so as to better explain the interrelationships among various factors that affect the public opinion polarization phenomenon.",

            "text": "There are also many existing studies on the social interaction, social conflict, and social impact of public opinion analysis. For example, in 2019, Zhou [15] used a structural equation model to explore the impact of social interaction on users\u2019 social and commercial willingness. In 2019, Kim et al. [16] studied the relationship between offline social interaction and online shopping. In 2016, Szczecinska-Musielak [17] discussed the usefulness of social conflict theory as a theoretical framework for analyzing the conflict in Northern Ireland. In 2018, Cuppen [18] emphasized the value of social conflict in energy policy and planning and discussed several basic characteristics of social conflict. Zhou [19] proposed in 2019 that social support, including information support and emotional support, had a significant impact on social influence. Peng et al. [20] presented an evaluation model to measure both direct and indirect influence based on the social relationship graph, by introducing friend entropy and interaction frequency entropy to describe the complexity and uncertainty of social influence. All the above literature study network public opinion from macro perspectives and mainly use qualitative methods to analyze opinion evolution. However, micro individual interactions can determine the macro emergence of group behavior. As a result, it is necessary to explore public opinion polarization from micro individual interactions. That is why we introduce social preference theory to measure individual revenues in interactions.",

            "text": "In addition, some scholars have attempted to explain the evolution mechanism of public opinion through the preference theory. For instance, in 2015, Alizadeh et al. [21] investigated the interplay of homophily, rejection, and in-group cooperation drivers on the formation of opinion clusters and the emergence of extremist, radical opinions. Their model was to explicitly explore the effect of in-group favoritism on the macro-level, collective behavior of opinions. In 2019, Banisch and Olbrich [22] analytically characterized sufficient conditions for the stability of bi-polarization with the consideration of the social feedback process. Comparing with previous models, their model highlighted an effective experience-based route to polarization. In 2019, Dong et al. [23] believed that while interacting with their views, interlocutors often hid their real preferences and expressed different preferences to different persons. Furthermore, by dividing the individual preferences into real preference, communication preference, and public preference, they studied the deceptive interaction and the preference evolution of heterogeneous trust in the network. In 2018, Navarro-Martinez et al. [24] incorporated the expected utility theory to build a model of the dynamic preference where the preferences selected by the decision-makers for each interaction were recorded and compared with the previous preferences. In 2018, Guevara et al. [25] measured the dynamic change of individual preference values during interaction by establishing a continuous opinion space. In 2010 and 2014, Cabrerizo et al. [26,27] described a concept of a granular fuzzy preference relation and gave the influence of individual preference on decision results in a fuzzy group. In 2007, Herrera-Viedma et al. [28] studied the impact of information shortage for incomplete fuzzy preference relations. P\u00e9rez et al. [29] presented a novel model in 2016 that gathered the experts\u2019 initial opinions and provided a framework to represent the influence of a given expert over the other(s). With this proposal, it was feasible to estimate both the evolution of the group decision-making process and the final solution before carrying out the group discussion process and consequently foreseeing possible actions. In 2018, Gayle and Khorunzhina [30] put forward an extended model based on fuzzy consensus while evaluating resources. By this model, rational decisions could be made so as to reduce the impact of individual preference on evaluation accuracy. Barseghyan et al. [31] studied the family risk preferences through expectation utility theory in 2016. All these studies mentioned above are of great significance to the field of public opinion, but they mainly focus on qualitative analysis and lack quantitative modeling and analysis process, leading to shortages of intuitiveness and validity of the characterization of complex and changeable public opinion evolution.",

Actually, the interaction of micro individuals determines the emergence of macro groups. At present, studies on the applications of social preference theory to the phenomenon of public opinion polarization are still rare. During the public opinion evolution, individuals with different preferences will get different benefits, which will drive them to make different decisions while interacting with each other. However, the diverse interaction behaviors of these individuals ultimately lead to different public opinion polarization effects. In addition, in terms of individual interaction, the intimacy and friendliness of the participants must be considered. In general, individuals tend to interact with ones with similar views or close friendships, and their interaction yields will be higher. Therefore, this paper firstly introduces the concept of the intimacy as well as friendliness and then establishes individual revenue function. Subsequently, a new public opinion polarization model to explore opinion propagation rule is set up. In addition, according to the individual revenue function, a network structure considering node exit mechanism is built on the basis of a BA scale-free network [32], which expands the static network in previous studies [33,34] into the dynamic one, making it more realistic. Finally, the influences of different social preferences and individual revenue functions on the public opinion polarization effects are analyzed through simulation experiments, and a real case is also given to verify the practicability and effectiveness of the proposed model.",

Based on this, when measuring the social mainstream revenue of the network polarization phenomenon, it is not accurate to calculate the average attitude value of all individuals in the network.

However, there are significant differences between online and offline social methods. First of all, the connections among individuals in a network are extremely unstable and the degree of intimacy between two individuals will be related to the benefits of their interaction. When an individual i interacts with j in a network, if the revenue he/she obtains is very small, then at the next moment, individual i will not want to interact with j anymore. Specifically, if the interaction intention of i to j is reduced, the intimacy of i to j will also be reduced. We believe that there exists a positive correlation between willingness to interact and intimacy. Secondly, due to the existence of heterogeneous preference individuals in a network, these individuals will present different manifestations when interacting shown in Figure 5.",

Based on this, individuals with altruistic preferences have a greater willingness to interact in the network, and this willingness will be further increased after multiple interactions, which manifests the improvement of intimacy degrees. In contrast, individuals with egoistic preferences tend to reduce their willingness to interact after multiple interactions, which shows the reduction of intimacy degrees. Moreover, individuals with fair preferences fall somewhere in between. However, it can be seen from Figure 10 and Figure 12 that the polarization percentage (i.e., the proportion of the number of individuals of |xi| > 0.9 to all individuals) in the network composed of individuals with fair preference is the highest, followed by altruistic preference, mixed preference, and egoistic preference in descending order.",

These three vertices show dark color, representing low polarizability, while the light color in the middle points indicates high polarizability. Simulation results show that opinion polarization is low when there is only one social preference in the network. In addition, the change trend of polarizability shown in Figure 14 is slightly different from that in Figure 13. This is because, in Figure 13, when analyzing the influences of the proportion of individuals with different preferences on the public opinion polarization effects, other individuals are treated as ones without preferences, that is, revenue is not adjusted according to their preferences. In the three-dimensional diagram shown in Figure 14, if the proportion of individuals with one preference increases, the proportion of individuals with other preferences decreases accordingly so that the sum of the three equals to 1.",

However, if the total gain obtained by individual i in interacting with these individuals is negative, then at the next moment, individual i will no longer be willing to participate in the interaction and express his/her own views.

From the vertical comparisons in Figure 19, we can see that the connections among individuals with fair preference and altruistic preference change little in the network, while the connections among individuals with egoistic preference almost completely break. The horizontal comparisons in Figure 19 show that individuals with different preferences are more likely to interact. Figure 19a,d,g represents the interactions among individuals with the same preference, respectively. At this point, the attitude distance among individuals with the same preference almost only has two extreme values, |xi \u2212 xj| < 0.4 or |xi \u2212 xj| > 2.0. In contrast, the interactions among individuals with different preferences represented in Figure 19b,e,h appear more connections of intermediate attitude distances, which illustrates that after the emergence of public opinion polarization, the existence of more differentiated individuals is easier to stabilize the network. Moreover, Figure 19c,f,i shows the degree distribution of individuals with different preferences, in which the network degree distribution of egoistic individuals is significantly smaller than that of the other two preferences, while the difference between fair preference and altruistic preference is not obvious.",

However, with the further evolution of public opinion, polarization gradually emerges, and the growth trend of revenue begins to slow down. Moreover, when the revenue decreases, the number of isolated individuals exiting interactive behaviors starts to increase. In Figure 21d\u2013f, when individuals can only benefit from the interaction, due to dispersion of views at the initial time, it is very difficult for them to find like-minded individuals to interact, so the profit is very low, making individuals unwilling to interact once again. Thus, the number of isolated individuals grows fast at the initial time.However, when time = 4, almost 85% of individuals are out of the communication of events, and at the same time, due to the weak interaction willingness, it is hard for the polarization phenomenonto appear. As can be seen from Figure 21g\u2013i, when individuals can only get benefits by expressing their own opinions, they have strong desires to interact with each other, so the number of isolated individuals grows slowly. Most individuals are willing to express their own opinions in the network, so polarization is more likely to occur.",

Based on this, we assume that social preferences have dynamic variability and define rules as follows. When the revenue of the individual in the network is greater than the threshold d1, his/her preference will turn into altruistic preference. When the revenue of the individual in the network is less than the threshold d2, his/her preference will turn into egoistic preference. Similarly, when the revenue of the individual in the network is between the middle, his/her preference will convert into fair preference. The results are shown in Figure 22, Figure 23 and Figure 24.

Because many netizens prefer to support the weak, when the information is not clear at the beginning, almost all of them supported pregnant women one way. However, with the truth gradually revealed, there were many individuals who still maintained their preferences and did not change their views. Therefore, we simulate the event using the public opinion polarization model which considers individual heterogeneity preference and compares the macro polarization model in [14]. The parameters we used in the simulation are as follows: \u03b1 = 0.15, \u03b2 = 0.8, \u03b3 = 0.05, the network is a BA scale-free network with clustering C = 0.324. The results are shown in Figure 26.",

            "text": "From Figure 26a, we can see that at the initial time, almost all individual attitudes are positive, that is, they support the pregnant woman\u2019s viewpoint, but with the evolution of public opinion, some individuals\u2019 attitudes begin to shift to neutrality. Finally, when time = 18, their attitudes change again, and most of the individual attitudes turn negative, that is, they support \u201cSaya\u201d, which is roughly consistent with the trend shown in Figure 25. At the same time, as shown in Figure 26b, we use the macro model proposed in [14] to simulate and get simulation results. Comparing these two figures, we can see that the evolutionary trends of these two are basically the same. Whereas, the model considering individual heterogeneity preference can polarize public opinion more quickly than the one proposed in [14], the reason may be that, in such a typical case as \u201cInternet red beating pregnant women\u201d, individuals have obvious preferences which make individuals with the same preference form similar viewpoints. For example, at the beginning of this incident, a very large percentage of people prefer to support the weak. After that, with the disclosure of information, most individuals hold fairness preference and supported Internet red. As the result, in the evolution of public opinion, the opinion polarization phenomenon can occur quickly, which is roughly consistent with the model proposed in this paper. However, the model proposed in [14] considers the dynamic conformity of individuals, which make individuals have a relatively low tendency to conform to the crowd. Therefore, more interactions are needed to eventually form opinion polarization.In fact, this paper focuses on the analysis of individual micro interactions. Through the model in this paper, we can accurately analyze the different performance of different preference individuals under the effect of heterogeneity revenue.",
