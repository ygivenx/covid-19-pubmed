Patients were to rate eight common cold symptoms (headache, muscle ache, chilliness, sore throat, blocked nose, runny nose, cough, and sneezing) on a 0 to 3 rating scale [8] (0 = no symptoms, 3 = maximum severity) and were to have a total symptom score (the sum of these eight common cold symptoms at baseline) of \u22649.

Further pre-specified endpoints included TSS at each study day (Days 1\u201310) and viral load (change from baseline) on Day 3 or 4 for various virus types. After trial data were unblinded, three exploratory analyses were performed: assessment of TSS2\u20134 excluding a patient with aberrantly high symptom scores (TSS2\u20134, ex 1pt); the mean of the TSS over Days 1\u20134 (TSS1\u20134); and change in TSS1\u20134 relative to baseline (TSS1\u20134, rel) to adjust for the potential impact of baseline TSS (TSS0) on TSS1\u20134 (TSS0 scores ranged from 3.00\u20139.00 in the I-C group and from 2.00\u20139.00 in the placebo group). To calculate TSS1\u20134, rel, TSS0 was subtracted from TSS1\u20134 and the result was divided by TSS0. In addition, TSS2\u20134 scores were calculated for the virus positive subset and the HRV/HEV positive subset (see Analysis sets below for definition). Safety was assessed on the basis of incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) and overall tolerability was assessed by the patients themselves and recorded by the investigator at the final visit.",

Viral presence was to be determined for all patients using both qualitative and quantitative tests for respiratory viruses. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used for qualitative determinations of the presence of influenza A and B, picornaviruses, HRV/HEV, human bocavirus, human metapneumovirus, coronaviruses 229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43, adenovirus, human parechovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza virus types 1\u20134. Quantitative viral loads for HRV and HEV were determined using the panenterhino/Ge/08 assay [10, 11]. Quantitative viral loads for influenza A and B and coronaviruses 229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43 were assessed according to Garbino et al. [12, 13]. The panenterhino/Ge/08 assay provided quantifiable HRV and HEV viral load results; however, in some patients, virus was detectable but viral loads were below the level of quantification of the test. Such patients were considered to be virus-positive, but non-quantifiable (that is, a qualitative positive result). The total number of virus-positive patients was obtained by summing up the number of patients who had a positive result on any qualitative assay, or who had a detectable quantitative (quantifiable or non-quantifiable) result on the panenterhino/Ge/08 assay.",

            "text": "There may be several reasons for the unexpectedly low power of the trial, which resulted in trends rather than statistically significant outcomes for the primary endpoint and HRV/HEV viral load reductions. First, the proportion of patients for whom a respiratory virus could be detected was smaller than anticipated; respiratory viruses (all groups/types analysed) were found at baseline in only 54.9 % of patients (54.1 % in the I-C group and 55.7 % in the placebo group). Efforts were made to recruit patients with the earliest onset of a common cold. Thus, self-reported cold symptoms were used for patient inclusion criteria, without the requirement for demonstration of virus positivity to enter treatment. Since the early symptoms of common colds may be rather non-specific for respiratory virus infection, these symptoms may present in other conditions such as vasomotor rhinitis, in which certain nonspecific stimuli including changes in environment (temperature, humidity, or barometric pressure), airborne irritants (odors or fumes), dietary factors (spicy food or alcohol) or emotional factors trigger nasal symptoms. Patients inadvertently included with non-infectious conditions would not be expected to respond clinically to antiviral therapy, and therefore are likely to cause an under-estimation of any true antiviral treatment effect. Consistent with this, the ICICC trial demonstrated that among those patients who had quantifiable virus at baseline, the I-C patients had a greater decrease in viral load than did placebo patients, suggesting an antiviral effect of I-C. In addition, TSS2\u20134 scores in the patients who were virus-positive at baseline showed strong trend in favor of I-C. However, since this was a subset of the total enrolled population, the virus-positive subset was underpowered for the TSS2\u20134 score endpoint. In particular, the percentage of patients with HRV/HEV identified at baseline was substantially smaller than anticipated: only 23.6 % had quantifiable virus (22.4 % in the I-C group and 24.7 % in the placebo group). Other studies using both molecular methods and viral culture have demonstrated that human rhinoviruses are the etiologic agent in 50\u201390 % of common colds [1, 15]. The current trial was also conducted primarily in the fall (October until February), which includes the period of greatest HRV infection incidence [1, 15]. Because virus shedding tends to be the greatest in the first several days of infection and generally continues for up to 2 weeks, it is unlikely that the low positive rate for HRV/HEV infection was due to missing the window of HRV shedding. More likely, the current study was conducted during a season of low HRV prevalence, resulting in fewer than expected infections among trial patients. In two previous clinical trials conducted with I-C [6, 7], the number of patients with confirmed HRV infection was higher than in the current trial, at 46 % [6] and 30 % [7] (although these values are as well lower than the percentages reported for other studies [1, 15]). Therefore, the smaller-than-expected number of patients infected with the HRV/HEV viruses likely limited the ICICC trial\u2019s ability to differentiate between the I-C and placebo treatments.",

Data from several experiments suggest that the mechanism of action may be prevention of binding to attachment sites and/or interference of viral entry. First, in vitro studies have demonstrated activity against a variety of viruses \u2013 various strains of HRV and influenza and herpesvirus, denguevirus, and papillomavirus [3, 4, 19\u201321]. This non-specificity suggests the absence of a specific direct-acting antiviral (DAA). Secondly, the observed antiviral effects occurred early in the infection cycle, most likely during the stages of attachment and/or entry, and the antiviral effect tended not to be I-C concentration-dependent. It is, therefore, unlikely that carrageenan\u2019s effect is that of a DAA targeted to the metabolic or reproductive mechanisms. Since a variety of viruses cause the common cold and since the virus infection cycles typically involve binding and entry with nasal mucosal cells, the antiviral properties of iota carrageenan represents an attractive and promising option for treatment.",

It can therefore be expected that in real-life conditions patients/consumers who empirically choose to use the I-C spray have a relatively high likelihood of being infected with rhinovirus or one of a variety of respiratory viruses that manifest with the common cold symptoms. The uncertainty of true infection in such a setting is counter-balanced by the very low intolerance and toxicity rates of the I-C spray and its relative inexpensiveness, thus giving favorable potential benefit-risk and benefit-cost ratios to the empiric use of the I-C spray.",

This observation may be due to the large variability in the disease severity between native infection and patients recruited in the early stages of a cold. When a controlled clinical trial tries to recruit patients at the earliest stages of a common cold - when symptoms are still emerging and are mild - patients may incorrectly believe they are coming down with a cold, prior to full blown cold symptoms. The relatively low frequency of rhinovirus-positive patients in the ICICC study demonstrates that there is often a trade-off when this standard design is used for cold studies. The peculiarities of the outcome of the ICICC study are also useful in that they may trigger a discussion among the scientific community about more suitable study designs to investigate common cold treatments.",

Several rational and important exploratory analyses led to statistically significant and clinically relevant outcome differences. Unfortunately, the relatively low numbers of subjects with demonstrated viral infection limited study conclusions. Nonetheless, the outcome of the ICICC study is supported by previous evidence of I-C\u2019s in vitro antiviral activity and symptom and viral reduction in prior cold studies. The ICICC trial\u2019s outcome supports I-C spray as representing a potentially useful treatment option for the common cold.
