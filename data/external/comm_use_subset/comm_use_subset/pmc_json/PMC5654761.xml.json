However, delays in detection of or response to newly emerged pathogens, combined with increased global urbanization and connectivity, have resulted in recent EIDs causing extensive mortality across cultural, political, and national boundaries (e.g., HIV), and disproportionately high economic damages (e.g., SARS, H1N1). Efforts to identify the origins and causes of disease emergence at local scales, and regions from which novel diseases may be more likely to emerge, are valuable for focusing surveillance, prevention, and control programs earlier in the chain of emergence, containing EIDs closer to their source, and more effectively limiting their subsequent spread and socioeconomic impacts8.",

The EID events were divided into four groups, including wildlife origin zoonoses4. To model the potential risk of disease emergence, these four groups were regressed as a function of human population density and growth, latitude, rainfall, and wildlife species richness. The results suggest that wildlife origin EIDs are more likely to occur in regions with higher human population density and greater wildlife diversity (mammal species richness)8. However, the study is limited in its mechanistic inference due, in part, to the lack of specificity of the predictors. For example, the effect of population density could represent anthropogenic environmental changes (human pressure on landscapes), human-animal contact rates, reporting biases, or a combination of these. Furthermore, a range of potential mechanisms may not be adequately represented by this predictor set; a lack of an effect of rainfall, for example, does not discount the potential for other climatic factors to play a role, and a lack of an effect of latitude could mean that it is simply a poor proxy for other more meaningful factors that nevertheless exhibit some latitudinal variation (e.g., temperature, habitat types, biodiversity, and GDP). Improving the predictor set to better target underlying mechanisms could improve model performance and our ability to explain spatial variation in EID risk.",

We updated the EID database from4, and employed a new modeling framework (boosted regression trees, BRT) to capture high-dimensional interactions and generate response functions for individual variables. We selected a refined set of spatial predictors for their relevance to a priori hypotheses on plausible mechanisms underlying zoonotic EID emergence, including proxies for human activity, environmental factors, and the zoonotic pathogen pool from which novel diseases could emerge, all key features of conceptual models of zoonotic spillover7\u201311. We used an improved data set of mammal species distributions12, and included numerous data sets on measures of land use, land-use change and land cover. Furthermore, all data sets with sufficient temporal coverage were matched to events in the EID database by decade, such that covariates more accurately reflect the prevailing conditions at the time of disease emergence. We also constructed a novel proxy of reporting effort to match the spatial resolution of the other predictors, where previous studies have relied on coarse, country-level measures, and compared EID risk predictions with and without corrections for reporting effort. Finally, we accounted for spatial uncertainty in EID event data by random resampling to explicitly take into account the difficulties of accurately geocoding EID events. Our results suggest that EID events are best predicted by the distribution of tropical forested regions, higher mammalian species richness, and variables relating to shifts in agricultural land use; and appear to occur more often in tropical regions. We identify specific areas and approaches where a research focus may identify more specific trends not apparent in our data.",

Across 1000 iterations of the model, no variables consistently emerged as much stronger predictors than others but an average ranking of predictor importance could be derived. Of the top predictors, evergreen broadleaf trees (representing tropical rainforests) exhibited an overall positive trend, human population density an overall negative trend, the Global Environmental Stratification (climate) an idiosyncratic trend towards warmer and wetter (i.e., more tropical) climates, and mammal species richness showed an idiosyncratic trend, with higher risk values at lower and particularly higher richness values (Fig. 2). After mammal species richness, three variables involving agricultural practices followed in importance: cultivated/managed vegetation (5.6%), pasture change (5.2%), and areas dedicated to pasture (5.1%). In the unweighted model, which did not account for reporting effort (Supplementary Note 3), urban/built-up land was by far the strongest predictor of observed events, explaining a median of 30.6% of the model\u2019s variation and exhibiting a distinct positive trend.\n\n",

Areas with tropical forest and high mammalian biodiversity were elevated on our EID risk index (henceforth \u201cEID risk\u201d), although the uncertainty of the estimates was high. It may be that these variables represent the same mechanism, as tropical forests are generally areas of high biodiversity20, and the apparent association may be attenuated by the presence of both in the model. This trend is consistent with existing hypotheses, which suggest greater host biodiversity, increases the \u201cdepth\u201d of the pathogen pool from which novel pathogens may emerge, which in turn increases the potential for novel zoonotic pathogens to emerge21. There is a large literature on the relationship between biodiversity and infectious disease risk in people, with some studies suggesting that high host biodiversity decreases risk or that biodiversity loss may increase risk (i.e., the dilution effect)22, while others refute the generalizability of this23, 24 or suggest disease richness or prevalence increases with increasing wildlife species richness13. Our findings look at the global scale and a large group of pathogens, and so do not speak directly to this debate: although the dominant trend is an increase in risk of disease emergence with higher mammalian richness, this neither rules out nor substantiates the possibility of a dilution effect for specific diseases. Rather, it is consistent with previous suggestions that the relationship between biodiversity and disease risk is complex, context-specific and idiosyncratic23.",

Similarly, although population density was not found to be an important predictor in the unweighted model (median relative influence 2.2%), weighting the model by reporting effort drove up its importance (median rel. inf. 6.9%), such that EID risk was inversely related to population density. Population density was also included in the reporting effort model, but was not as strong a predictor (rel. inf. 3.6%) as urban land (rel. inf. 45.2%). Theoretically, population has a baseline multiplicative effect on human disease events25\u2014of which EID events are a subclass\u2014and their detection is modulated by reporting effort. Reporting effort appears to be associated with urbanization, but reporting effort and urbanization are also both products of human population.

First, our model building approach explores the explanatory value of a large collection of globally gridded data on environmental, demographic, and host diversity variables, including newly developed models of mammal distributions and richness patterns. This has allowed us to close the gap between predictors and a priori mechanistic hypotheses specifically relevant to zoonotic disease emergence from wildlife reservoirs. Second, we adopted a machine-learning modeling approach (boosted regression trees) suited to the analysis of complex ecological data26, and used various resampling regimes to measure and visualize multiple sources of uncertainty (model uncertainty, spatial uncertainty of EID events, and temporal uncertainty of covariates matching with events) and predictive performance. Third, we have attempted to improve how the model accounts for uneven global distribution of surveillance and research on disease event detection (i.e., report effort). This includes an algorithm-based approach to more realistically map reporting effort and shows the significant implications that a finer-scale, sub-national resolution variable for reporting effort can have for a model. Finally, we were able to temporally match predictors to events.",

However, against a background sample weighted by reporting effort, our weighted model had an AUC of 0.61 and a TSS of 0.18, indicating low\u2013moderate performance.

Multiple factors contribute to this uncertainty. First, analyses were conducted using gridded data at 1\u00b0 WGS84 resolution (c. 100 km at the equator), the same resolution used previously4. Our choice of resolution for predictor data sets was constrained by data availability, since all were downscaled to the lowest common spatial resolution. Second, CIs are widest in regions for each variable where fewer grid cells were sampled. Since our weighted model sampled fewer grid cells proportional with reporting effort, these represent areas where more reporting effort\u2014including ground-truthing studies\u2014may increase confidence. Third, another limitation shared with ref. 4 is the underlying accuracy and suitability of EID event data, which were drawn from a review of published literature. Individual studies carry their own biases, inaccuracies, and different approaches to collecting and documenting data, and this alone adds an unknown amount of imprecision and potential bias to our outcome data set. Finally, our goal of creating a single model, to look for common trends in emerging wildlife origin zoonotic diseases, likely imposes limitations on the specificity of trends we can examine. In reality, different classes of diseases (e.g., viruses versus bacteria) and indeed individual diseases have their own unique biology and ecology, with different drivers and sets of conditions being more or less important in shaping the emergence process27. Because of these limitations, we refrain from making specific (e.g., city by city) interpretations of the model\u2019s output, rather noting broad trends in geographic regions and environment types of intererest.",

In this study we focus only on EID events of wildlife origin (\u201cwildlife zoonoses\u201d) because these represent the majority of EID events in the most recent decade studied, are increasing significantly as a proportion of all EIDs after correcting for reporting bias, include most of the highest impact EIDs of recent decades (e.g., Ebola viruses, Nipah virus) and almost all recent pandemics (e.g., pandemic influenza viruses, SARS). Data on EID events were derived from an updated version of the database originally used by ref. 4 (Supplementary Data 1), which contained EID events ranging from 1940 to 2004 (n = 335 total, n = 145 for wildlife zoonoses (43.3% of all EIDs)). We updated the database to include EID events for wildlife zoonoses through 2008 (n = 224), following the methodology in ref. 4 so as to include only diseases reported in the peer-reviewed literature, where there is evidence that a disease is emerging for one of the reasons laid out above. In addition, we only included the first emergence of a new disease-causing agent, such that the MERS Coronavirus was included, but not reports of new strains of Ebola virus. For each EID event, data were derived from the literature, if available, for date, location (see below), pathogen genus and species, zoonotic origin and type, and associated or hypothesized drivers, following ref. 4. Location data for initial EID emergence events were variable in their geographic specificity, ranging from precise coordinates to broader regions (e.g., municipalities, counties, districts) or entire continents depending on details reported in the primary literature. A spatial polygon was created for each event that represented the most precise municipal region the EID event was known to have occurred in. All EID event polygons, regardless of precision, were included in our bootstrap resampling framework; removing those with geographic uncertainty (e.g., those with only country-level resolution) may artificially inflate the apparent certainty of our model, and our resampling scheme limits their impact to appropriate levels. Events with precise coordinates were also assigned a polygon for consistency of data format, but rather than using a municipal boundary, the event was assigned a 5 km circular buffer zone. EID polygons were subsampled for model fitting as described below. Because our model matches EID events with decadal population and land use data (described below), we restricted our analyses to decades for which covariate data exist, excluding events before 1970 and leaving n = 147 records for analysis (66% of wildlife zoonosis events).",

            "text": "\u201cHuman Activity\u201d data were compiled and eight predictors derived based on the following rationale: (1) Population density likely influences EID risk in two discrete ways. First, as EID events are defined as diseases emerging in the human population, their frequency\u2014before the effects of other predictors\u2014is assumed to be proportional to population density, with the other predictors modifying the per-person risk of EID events. To represent this, we treated human population as a baseline multiplicative factor in our models36. Second, population density may affect transmission dynamics such that EID events in areas of denser population may be more likely to produce outbreaks large enough to be detected37. We used the Global Rural\u2013Urban Mapping Project38 human population data set, which provides gridded estimates of human population every five years for 1970\u20132000. (2) Population change acts as a proxy for changing demands on ecosystems leading to environmental perturbation, which has been hypothesized to drive disease emergence21. We created a measure for population change by calculating the inter-decadal difference of human population per grid cell. (3) Land-use type represents largely anthropogenic influence on the landscape (as opposed to \u2018land cover\u2019 below) and has been hypothesized to play a role in disease emergence and spatial distribution19, 21, 39\u201341. We used the HYDE data set which estimates the percentage of land-use types in each grid cell of a global data set every ten years for 1900\u2013200042 to derive predictors representing percentage of land used for cropland and percentage used for pasture. We also include the layers for Urban Land and Managed/Cultivated Vegetation from the EarthEnv data set, described below under \u201cEnvironment\u201d, in this category, as they index human impact on the environment. (4) Land-use change has been hypothesized as a key driver for disease emergence by perturbing ecosystems and bringing humans into close proximity with wildlife5, 7, 8, 21, 27. We created metrics of change for pasture and cropland by calculating the between-decade difference in values for each grid cell for cropland and pasture.",

The diversity and prevalence in a host population of potentially zoonotic pathogens in an area is hypothesized to be a key factor in the risk of novel pathogen emergence8, 21, 43. However, spatial data on global pathogen diversity do not currently exist, and it is estimated that we have identified less than 1% of mammalian viral diversity35. Consistent with previous studies, we therefore assume that the number of available pathogens in an area is proportional to the diversity (species richness) of wildlife species4, 5, 35, 44. The overwhelming majority of emerging zoonoses have mammalian hosts45, and global biogeographic patterns of human infectious diseases is highly correlated with global patterns of mammalian diversity30. We therefore used mammal biodiversity (species richness), measured as number of mammal species per grid cell as a proxy for pathogen species richness. To do this, we used the most up to date mammal species distribution maps available, derived from species distribution ranges filtered according to species-specific habitat preferences12. These habitat suitability models reflected species preferences for land cover types, their altitudinal limits, their tolerance to human presence, and their relationship with water bodies. The full-resolution mammal biodiversity data (representing all 5291 terrestrial mammal species)12 was rescaled to the study grid by summing the number of species\u2019 distributions that overlapped each grid cell; (2) Domestic animal density. A number of past EID events with wildlife origin have emerged through farmed or domestic animal intermediate or amplifier hosts (e.g., Hendra and Nipah virus, SARS). In addition, there is growing evidence that the global trend of intensification of livestock production increases the emergence risk of novel wildlife origin zoonoses, e.g., Nipah virus in Malaysia46, influenza viruses, and others6. We used the Gridded Livestock of the World (GLW) data set47, which contains data for poultry, goat, buffalo, cattle, sheep, and pig headcounts. We summed mammals to a single predictor (livestock mammal headcount) and retained poultry as a discrete predictor.",

Climatic factors have been repeatedly hypothesized as important in the global biogeography of human infectious diseases, including EIDs30, 48, 49. Climate may influence disease distribution through enhanced suitability for vectors of wildlife origin zoonoses (e.g., West Nile virus), more rapid vector reproduction rates and biting rates, changes in the efficiency or rates of pathogen transmission among hosts and vectors, and changes in the ability of pathogens to persist in the environment, among other factors50, 51. Climate was represented by a single layer in our study, the Global Environmental Stratification52, which uses a quantitative model to stratify the Earth\u2019s surface into zones of similar climate on a single scalar measure, where higher values equate to warmer, wetter (more tropical) regions; (2) Land cover type: Land cover type is associated with the distribution of terrestrial mammals12 and other taxa53, potentially exposing humans present to different assemblages of viral species. It is also likely that the types of contact between wildlife and people vary with land cover type. For land cover, we used the EarthEnv data set54, which divides the Earth\u2019s surface into 12 classes. These include different classes of natural ecosystems, urban land and cultivated vegetation (grouped with \u201cHuman Activity\u201d above). We excluded barren areas, open water and snow/ice due to a lack of biologically plausible mechanisms for disease emergence. EarthEnv represents each class as a percentage per grid cell.",

PubCrawler uses a set of heuristics, based on textual and geographic features of the identified toponyms, to minimize the number of false positives and select amongst ambiguous matches. We selected articles matching terms from the Human Disease Ontology59 and exported extracted toponyms. After excluding a further round of potentially spurious matches, place name matches were assigned a weight, normalized by article, and then summed to the study grid. To impute missing data (resulting in a number of zero-value grid cells) and smooth noise in the raw output, we fit a Poisson boosted regression tree model (using human population, accessibility, urbanized land, DALY rates, health expenditure, and GDP as predictors), and used this to represent reporting effort in our model. This approach produced a layer that adequately represented the underlying data while achieving a similar coverage of grid cells to other layers.",
