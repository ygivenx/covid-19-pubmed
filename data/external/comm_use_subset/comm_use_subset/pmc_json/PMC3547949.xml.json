            "text": "The synthesis and maturation of eukaryotic mRNAs are crucial events for gene expression. Following mRNA synthesis, eukaryotic mRNAs undergo a series of critical modifications before being exported to the cytoplasm where they are translated into proteins. These processing events include the addition of a cap structure at the 5\u2032 terminus, the splicing out of introns, the editing of specific nucleotides, and the acquisition of a poly(A) tail at the 3\u2032 terminus. The cap structure found at the 5\u2032 end of eukaryotic mRNAs is critical for the splicing of the cap-proximal intron, the transport of mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and for both the stability and translation efficiency of mRNAs [1]. Synthesis of the cap structure occurs co-transcriptionally on nascent mRNAs and involves three enzymatic reactions. First, an RNA 5\u2032-triphosphatase (RTase) hydrolyzes the \u03b3-phosphate at the 5\u2032-end of the nascent pre-mRNA to generate a 5\u2032-diphosphate end. An RNA guanylyltransferase (GTase) then catalyzes a two-step reaction in which it initially utilizes GTP as a substrate to form a covalent enzyme-GMP (EpG) intermediate, with the concomitant release of pyrophosphate (PPi). The GMP moiety is then transferred to the 5\u2032-diphosphate end of the nascent RNA transcript in the second step of the reaction to form the GpppRNA structure. Finally, using S-adenosyl-methionine as a substrate, an RNA (guanine-N7) methyltransferase catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group to the N-7 position of the guanine to produce the characteristic m7GpppRNA cap structure [2]. In humans, a bifunctional RNA capping enzyme catalyzes both the RTase and GTase reactions through distinct domains, while a separate polypeptide mediates the subsequent N-7 methylation [3]. The importance of the cap structure for RNA metabolism is highlighted by genetic analyses in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that showed that the triphosphatase, guanylyltransferase and methyltransferase components of the capping apparatus are essential for cell growth [4], [5], [6].",

Transcription initiation is associated with the RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) Ser 5 phosphorylation, which recruits the capping apparatus [7]. Nascent mRNAs are rapidly capped (as they are only 20\u201330 nt long), followed by RNA Pol II CTD Ser 2 phosphorylation, HCE dissociation and mRNA elongation [8]. Messenger RNA capping represents a quality control checkpoint as uncapped RNA are degraded by the Xrn2 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 exonuclease in order to avoid generation of uncapped mRNA which are not likely to be translated [9], [10], [11]. Uncapped mRNAs are not recognized by the initiation factor eIF4E and are degraded by the 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 Xrn1 [12], [13]. Given that the RNA Pol II synthesizes 10\u201330 bases per second, the entire fate of an unsuccessfully capped mRNA can be sealed within few seconds, stressing the importance of rapid and efficient mRNA capping [14].",

A general mechanism for phosphoryltransfer involving conformational changes between an open and closed form of the enzyme has been previously solved based on various GTases crystal structures [17], [18]. The first step of the reaction is initiated by the binding of GTP to the open form of the enzyme followed by the closure of the C-terminal oligomer-binding (OB) fold domain and the N-terminal nucleotidyl transferase (NT) domain. This closure is stabilized by interactions between the bound nucleotide and residues from both NT and OB fold domain. Once in the catalytically active close conformation, the GTP substrate is hydrolyzed to produce the enzyme-GMP covalent intermediate. Interactions between the bound guanylate and the OB fold domain are disrupted upon GTP hydrolysis, which leads to the reopening of the enzyme concomitant with the release of pyrophosphate. The open conformation exposes the RNA-binding site, thereby allowing the subsequent transfer of the GMP moiety onto the acceptor RNA. Figure 1 summarizes the mechanistic and structural pathway used by GTases.",

            "text": "Very few inhibitors of the GTase activity have been identified. Recent in vitro studies have shown that foscarnet, an antiviral drug that targets the DNA polymerase of human cytomegalovirus, is a potent inhibitor of the GTase reaction [19]. Inhibition of the GTase reaction likely occurs through binding of foscarnet to the active site of the enzyme on account of its analogous nature to pyrophosphate, a product of both the polymerase and the RNA guanylyltransferase reaction. The intracellular triphosphorylated form of ribavirin, a broad-spectrum antiviral nucleoside analogue, can also inhibit the activity of viral GTases. Mechanistic studies have demonstrated that ribavirin triphosphate can actually be used as a substrate by viral GTases [20]. However, RNAs capped with ribavirin are relatively inert to methylation by viral RNA (guanine-N7) methyltransferases, thus resulting in mRNAs that are stable but not efficiently translated into viral proteins [21]. Ribavirin is a pleiotropic agent that can also inhibit the cellular inosine-5\u2032-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), which is critical in the metabolism of nucleic acid precursors [22]. The enzyme catalyzes the conversion of inosine monophosphate (IMP) to xanthosine monophosphate (XMP) with the concomitant reduction of NAD via a covalent intermediate (E-XMP). This conversion has been shown to be the rate-limiting step in de novo guanine nucleotide biosynthesis [23]. This reduction in intracellular concentrations of guanosine is a key factor which contributes to the decrease in viral replication [22].",

Crystallographic studies have demonstrated that the binding of MZP to IMPDH results in a transition state analogue complex reminiscent of the E-XMP intermediate formed during the conversion of IMP to XMP [25]. MZP is therefore a highly potent antagonistic inhibitor of IMPDH that blocks the proliferation of T and B lymphocytes that use the de novo pathway of guanine nucleotide synthesis almost exclusively. Guanosine nucleotide depletion impairs G protein coupled receptor transduction and cyclic GMP signaling, ultimately resulting in the interruption of the S phase of the cell cycle through specific inhibition of IMPDH [28].

In this context, the HCE protein is fused in frame with an N-terminal 6-His tag, and expression of the protein is driven by a T7 RNA polymerase promoter. Upon transformation of the pet-HCE plasmid into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3), cultures were grown at 37\u00b0C in Luria-Bertani medium containing 30 \u00b5g/mL kanamycine until the A\n600 reached 0.5.

In order to address if it was the presence (or the activity) of the RTase domain that could influence the susceptibility of the HCE GTase domain to MZP inhibition, we generated a point mutation of the catalytic Cysteine 126 of the RTase domain from the classical phosphatase core motif (I/V)HCxxGxxR(S/T)G [30]. Our results show that this RTase-defective full-length HCE mutant (HCE-C126S) displayed a similar inhibition profile than the wild-type enzyme (Fig. S1).

Interestingly, for the complete GTase reaction, the Km appears to be independent from the inhibitor concentration, which would suggest a non-competitive mechanism of inhibition (Fig. 3F). It should be noted that HCE was not able to use the MZP as a substrate and transfer it onto a radiolabeled acceptor RNA to form an atypical cap structure (Fig. S2).

The mammalian vaccinia virus GTase (D1R), the Saccharomyces cerevisiae GTase (Ceg1) and the GTase (A103R) from Chlorella virus (PBCV-1) were submitted to MZP inhibition for both the complete GTase reaction and the EpG formation (GTase first step). As compared to the HCE (IC50 = 80 \u00b5M), the other GTases showed reduced susceptibility to MZP inhibition for the complete GTase reaction. This difference ranges from 5-to 25-fold for the GTase from the mammalian vaccinia virus (IC50 = 500 \u00b5M), the Chlorella virus (IC50 = 750 \u00b5M), and the yeast S. cerevisiae (IC50>2 mM) (Fig. 4A). MZP also inhibited the EpG formation by all GTase assessed, albeit with smaller variations (Fig. 4B). Both the human and vaccinia virus GTase (HCE and D1R) had IC50 values of 3 mM, the Chlorella virus GTase (A103R) presented an IC50 of 2 mM, while the yeast GTase (Ceg1) seemed slightly less affected by MZP. Unlike the complete GTase reaction, the low potency inhibition of the EpG formation by MZP is fairly similar for all GTases assessed. These results support the hypothesis that the inhibition of the HCE-GMP complex by MZP could only account for a minor contribution to the complete GTase activity inhibition. This raises the possibility that a conformational change hindrance could be the mechanism of action by which MZP inhibits HCE. This hypothesis will be further investigated in the discussion.",

            "text": "We next set out to investigate if the in vitro inhibitory potency of MZP on HCE could be translated into the inhibition of the capping apparatus in living cells. Monitoring the capping efficiency in mammalian cells is a great challenge. RNA quality control systems ensure that unsuccessfully capped mRNAs are rapidly degraded. As a net result, capping inhibition would not lead to uncapped mRNA accumulation, but rather to a global decrease of mature mRNAs. This potentially allows to indirectly evaluate the ability of MZP to inhibit RNA capping by monitoring the transcription and translation of a reporter gene in a controlled environment. On average, an mRNA is transcribed every 30 min, has a half-life of 9 hours, and is translated 40 times per hour to yield an average of 500\u20131000 proteins over its life span [31]. This gives nearly 3 orders of magnitude of amplification over every capping event and provides a very sensitive assay. As an attempt to rescue the capping inhibition induced by MZP, we chose four identical human embryonic kidney (HEK 293T) cell lines, diverging only by the over-expression (or not) of HCE-WT-HA, HCE-K294A-HA (GTase defective mutant) or GFP protein (Fig. 5C). Unlike HCE-WT-HA, HCE-K294A-HA might be slightly toxic (negative dominant effect), which would explain its lower over-expression, nevertheless, HCE-K294A-HA can be over-expressed in mamalien cells and is easily detectable. Both the activity and the stability of the reporter gene (firefly luciferase) are not influenced by high concentration of HCE (Fig. S3). The mizoribine prodrug was added to a final concentration of 0, 40 or 120 \u00b5M to the four cell lines. The reporter gene expression was initiated upon transfection of the PGL3 vector (bearing the firefly luciferase reporter gene under the control of an RNA Pol II promoter). Luminescence quantification of the reporter level was performed after 30 h of reporter protein expression (Fig. 5A). Our results indicate that cells treated with 40 \u00b5M or 120 \u00b5M mizoribine show a global reduction in protein expression, likely due to the partial GTP depletion induced by IMPDH inhibition. Interestingly, the translation of the reporter gene was partially rescued only in cells over-expressing HCE-WT-HA when compared the HCE-K294A-HA, GFP, and control cells. In the presence of 40 \u00b5M and 120 \u00b5M of mizoribine, the cells over-expressing HCE-WT-HA maintained a significantly higher reporter gene translation rate compared to all the other cell lines that did not harbor a functional capping apparatus (Fig. 5B). Although this experiment does not allow for precise quantification of the capping inhibition, it demonstrates that the over-expression of the active capping apparatus in human cells was partially able to rescue the mizoribine-induced phenotype on a reporter gene that is dependent on the cap structure for its proper transcription and translation.",

            "text": "The GTase catalysis is a two-step reaction. Interestingly, the inhibition of the complete GTase reaction by MZP could not be explained completely by the inhibition of its individual steps. While the GMP transfer onto an acceptor RNA (second step) does not contribute significantly to the general inhibition effect caused by MZP, the EpG formation (first step) is inhibited by MZP with an IC50 25-times higher than the complete GTase reaction. This weak inhibition, led us to hypothesize that two distinct MZP binding sites could be present on HCE. The main binding site responsible for the drug inhibitory potency is speculated to be allosteric and will be further discussed. The second would be the active site and is believed to bind MZP with a lower affinity, likely due to the drug chemical similarity with GMP. The weak binding of MZP to the active site would be coherent with EpG complex formation being competitively inhibited by MZP. In silico docking of MZP on the highly conserved active site of an open conformation homology model of HCE GTase domain provides additional information on the mechanism of MZP binding to this site (Fig. S4 and Table S1). MZP appears to be coordinated by the most conserved amino acids, which would thereby explain the low inhibition specificity toward various GTase (Fig. 4C and D). Nevertheless, the mechanism of inhibition of the enzyme-GMP complex, which is mediated by the weak binding of MZP to the active site, is fundamentally different and weaker than the mechanism of the complete GTase inhibition. A complete GTase catalytic round does not only imply the formation of the EpG intermediate complex and the transfer of the GMP moiety to an acceptor RNA, but also involves complex conformational changes where the OB fold domain leans toward or away from the NT domain. MZP could bind HCE and block this conformational change, possibly through stabilization of the closed conformation, thereby preventing the reopening of the protein upon GTP hydrolysis. This hypothesis would likely imply an allosteric MZP binding site. Interestingly, the kinetics studies, although performed in steady-state condition, point toward a non-competitive mechanism of inhibition, which would indicate that MZP binds elsewhere than the active site. This is also coherent with the inability of MZP to be used as a substrate and transferred onto an acceptor RNA. Despite the very high degree of conservation among this specific family of nucleotidyltransferases, MZP harbors a 5-to 25-fold gain in specificity for HCE when compared to other GTases. This result additionally supports the presence of an allosteric MZP binding pocket. Oddly enough, the lone GTase domain of HCE (HCE-G229\u2013597) is less susceptible by 10-fold to MZP inhibition than the full-length HCE. This evidence, not only supports the presence of an allosteric site, but can also provide additional information about its localization on HCE. It is tempting to speculate that MZP could bind near the N-terminal of the GTase domain (close to the RTase-GTase interdomain) or on a region of interaction between both the RTase and GTase domains since the abolition of the RTase domain reduces HCE MZP susceptibility. In order to gain additional details on the MZP main binding site, molecular docking could be used. Unfortunately, the structure of both the RTase and the GTase domain are separately available, but the structure of the full-length protein is still not available. Nevertheless, we ran a molecular docking experiment of MZP on the GTase domain from HCE. The lack of RTase domain, which is predicted to participate in MZP binding, and the moderate flexibility of the N-terminal domain, which introduces a structural incertitude, does not allow for definitive conclusions to be reached but it is interesting to note that, in preliminary experiments, MZP favorably docks on the N-terminal region of the HCE GTase (near the RTase-GTase inter-domain). Together, our results reveal that MZP inhibits the HCE GTase activity with a 5-to 25-fold specificity in comparison to other GTases. Although more work is yet required to confirm our hypothesis, these results raise the possibility that the GTase inhibition could be mediated by a conformational change hindrance upon binding of MZP to an allosteric binding site that is speculated to reside near the RTase-GTase inter-domain. Nevertheless, mizoribine is one of the first compounds to demonstrate a certain degree of specificity toward a single GTase, despite the high degree of conservation of this crucial family of enzyme.",

This may simply be due to our experimental conditions (5 mM Mg2+ and low nucleotide triphosphate concentration) where the RTase activity of HCE, which is partially inhibited by free Mg2+, becomes the rate-limiting step [30]. However, in cellulo the RTase harbors a higher turnover rate than the GTase, which catalyzes the limiting step in RNA capping [15].

The current study identifies MZP as a novel allosteric GTase inhibitor, which is speculated to block a crucial conformational change.

Numerous studies have demonstrated the potency of MZP to inhibit the cellular IMPDH and to lower the intracellular guanosine nucleotide pool thereby limiting cell growth [28], but none have addressed its impact on the capping apparatus. Monitoring the capping efficiency in living cells is a great challenge as the cellular quality control machinery degrades unsuccessfully capped mRNAs [9], [10], [33]. Since proper capping is crucial for mRNA transcription, export, stability and translation, it is possible to monitor the capping efficiency based on the translation of a reporter protein. In order to evaluate if MZP could impair in cellulo capping, we monitored its indirect impact on the translation of the firefly luciferase reporter gene. As cellular protein levels are not only dictated by capping efficiency, we selected a cellular model where all variables unrelated to capping were constant. Cells originating from the same population were trasfected in order to over-express either the active HCE-WT-HA, the GTase-defective HCE-K294A-HA mutant, the GFP control protein or no protein (Control vector). They were submitted to concentrations of 0 \u00b5M, 40 \u00b5M or 120 \u00b5M of mizoribine. All cell lines treated with mizoribine showed a global reduction in reporter protein expression when compared with untreated cells. This expected effect is likely due to partial guanosine pool depletion induced by IMPDH inhibition [28], [34], [35]. Interestingly, the reduction in transcription and translation of the reporter was significantly less severe only in cells over-expression HCE-WT-HA for both mizoribine concentrations. The ability of HCE-WT-HA over-expression to partially rescue the luciferase expression in the presence of mizoribine demonstrates that HCE is one of the mizoribine pharmacological targets. Furthermore, the inability of the GTase defective mutant HCE-K294A-HA to rescue the reporter expression under mizoribine treatment further demonstrates, in agreement with our in vitro results, that in a cellular context it is the GTase activity of HCE that is targeted by MZP. Although indirect, this is strong evidence that mizoribine is able to impair capping in a cellular environment. As expected, capping could not be fully inhibited in cellulo at mizoribine concentrations of 40\u2013120 \u00b5M, which is approximately the in vitro IC50 of 80 \u00b5M. Despite its oral bioavailability (underlying membrane permeability) and its low binding to serum proteins (2.3%), mizoribine was not expected to reach intracellular concentration higher then its IC50\n[36], [37], [38], [39]. Of notice, the effect of mizoribine on cellular capping was however greater than anticipated. We hypothesize that the competition between HCE and Xrn2 for the nascent mRNA 5\u2032 end could explain the potency of MZP in cellulo, as slowing (or inhibiting) the capping activity could be sufficient to shift the balance towards quality control take-over (degradation) and reduce downstream protein expression.",

This question has yet to be addressed, but the immunosuppressive effect of mizoribine on T-cell is mainly mediated by GTP depletion (which not only blocks T-cells proliferation but also promotes T-cell apoptosis) and might be exacerbated by the reduction of mRNA capping and downstream cap-dependent translation [40], [41]. Our study clearly demonstrates that the therapeutic agent mizoribine monophosphate inhibits the human RNA guanylyltransferase in vitro and impairs mRNA capping in cellulo.",

The apo-enzyme (structure 1) first binds GTP (grey sphere, structure 2) which promotes the closure of the OB fold domain toward the NT domain (structure 3). In the catalytically active close conformation, the enzyme hydrolyzes the GTP to form the hallmark enzyme-GMP covalent intermediate complex (black sphere, structure 4). The lost of interactions between the bound guanylate and the OB fold domain, upon GTP hydrolysis, destabilizes the close conformation of the enzyme and leads to its reopening (structure 5) concomitant with the release of the pyrophosphate product. This exposes the RNA-binding site of the enzyme (exact location unknown), thereby allowing 5\u2032-diphosphate RNA binding (structure 6) and subsequent GMP moiety transfer onto the acceptor RNA (structure 7). The capped RNA is then released and the apo-enzyme (structure 1) is regenerated allowing reinitiation of the pathway. (PDB: 1CKN).",
