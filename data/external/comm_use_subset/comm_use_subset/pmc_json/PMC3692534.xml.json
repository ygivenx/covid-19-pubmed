The concept of differentiation therapy has been considered as a promising approach for the treatment of AML since 1970s [3]. In 1980s, the successful use of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) that elicited complete remission (CR) of more than 90% of APL patients has brought differentiation therapy from theoretical exploration to clinical application [4], [5]. Although great breakthrough in clinical oncology has been achieved by differentiation therapy with ATRA, ATRA-based therapy showed poor results in non-APL AMLs, thus tremendous efforts have been conducted to explore novel molecular targets as well as identify efficient differentiating compounds in AML treatment.",

            "text": "The off-target effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) on inducing AML differentiation have been a topic of considerable interest in the last few years. Imatinib, the first BCR/ABL inhibitor, has been revealed to exert an unexpected effect on potentiating ATRA-induced AML differentiation [6]. The EGFR inhibitor gefitinib has also been demonstrated to enhance ATRA-induced differentiation of leukemic cells [7] and to trigger the differentiation of AML cell lines (HL60, kasumi-1 and U937) that lack the expression of EGFR [8] when used alone. Dasatinib, which targets a variety of tyrosine kinases, most notably the BCR/ABL fusion protein and the Src Family Kinases (SFKs), is used for the treatment of BCR/ABL+ CML and acute lymphocytic leukemia with imatinib resistance or intolerance to previous therapy [9], [10], [11], [12]. In vitro studies have shown that dasatinib significantly inhibited the growth of a variety of AML cell lines and primary blasts when treated alone or in combination with cytotoxic or molecular-targeted agents [13], [14]. Of note, dasatinib was also reported to promote ATRA-induced differentiation of AML cell lines and restore differentiating response of non-APL primary AML cells to ATRA, while dasatinib alone could not promote leukemic cell differentiation [15], [16]. In contrast, Lainey et al.\u2019s study demonstrated that dasatinib by itself could overcome the AML-typical differentiation blockage as evidenced by dasatinib-induced differentiation of MOLM13 and HL60 cells [17]. This effect was further confirmed by a clinical study which provided proof of prolonged differentiation of myeloid blasts bearing the t(8;21) to mature after dasatinib treatment [18]. Inhibition of c-Kit and induction of CAAT-enhancer binding protein-\u03b1 (C/EBP\u03b1) was demonstrated to contribute to this remarkable response-induced by dasatinib [18]. However, the mechanisms by which dasatinib trigger AML differentiation remains largely unknown.",

            "text": "In the present study, we first reported that dasatinib-induced differentiation of AML cells was accompanied with the activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), which was evidenced by the augmented phosphorylation of STAT1, the redistribution of STAT1 from cytoplasm to nucleus and the enhanced transcription of STAT1 direct target genes. We then showed that STAT1 knockdown significantly decreased the differentiating effect of dasatinib, indicating a potential role of STAT1 in dasatinib\u2019s off-target effects. We further found that dasatinib-induced STAT1 activation was MEK/ERK cascade dependent since MEK inhibitors not only inhibited dasatinib-triggered phosphorylation of STAT1, but also abrogated dasatinib-induced differentiation of AML cells. In summary, our results suggested a novel mechanism associated with the differentiation-induction effect of dasatinib on leukemic cells, which may provide theoretical support for the anticancer approach of dasatinib in AML.",

However, high concentrations (5 and 10 \u00b5M) of dasatinib did not induce an enhanced expression of CD11b (Fig. 2A). This could be attributed to dasatinib-induced increase of hypodiploid cells at 72 h. Upon high concentrations (5 and 10 \u00b5M) of dasatinib treatment, approximately more than 30% of NB4 cells were accumulated in Sub G0 phase. Actually, dasatinib-induced cell-cycle blockade was manifested before the accumulation of Sub G0 phase cells. An obvious G0/G1 phase arrest was already detectable at 24 h after dasatinib treatment (2.5\u201310 \u00b5M), when no hypodiploid cells were observed (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, the ability of dasatinib to induce AML differentiation was also confirmed by morphologic changes of HL60 and NB4 cells, namely a reduction of nucleus to cytoplasm ratio and an obvious nuclear segmentation compared with control group (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these results indicated that dasatinib exerted a differentiation effect on AML cells.",

HL60 cells were incubated with dasatinib (10 \u00b5M) for indicated times and then analyzed for the phosphorylation of STAT proteins. As shown in Fig. 3A, dasatinib treatment led to an increased phosphorylation of STAT1 (Y701 and S727) within 1 h, which was then augmented with time, whereas dasatinib significantly decreased the phosphorylation of STAT3 (Y705), which was almost undetectable after 3 h treatment. In addition, dasatinb exhibited little effects on the phosphorylation of STAT3 (S727) and STAT5 (Y694) (Fig. 3A and data not shown). Given that phosphorylated STAT1 will translocate into the nucleus to exert its gene regulation effects, we then determined the localization of STAT1 by immunofluorescence assay. In the absence of dasatinib, STAT1 was predominantly cytoplasmic, while dasatinib treatment induced the redistribution of STAT1 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (Fig. 3B). To further confirm the ability of phosphorylated STAT1 on gene transcription regulation, the expressions of two direct STAT1 target genes (RIG-G and CXCL-10) [25], [26] were tested by real time PCR. As shown in Fig. 3C, the transcription of both genes was enhanced by dasatinib in a time-dependent manner. In consistence with these results, dasatinib-induced activation of STAT1 was also observed in NB4 cells. A modest increase of p-STAT1 (Y701) and p-STAT1 (S727) were virtually detectable at 0.5 h after dasatinib treatment, but the level of p-STAT1 (Y701) returned to baseline by 48 h, while the level of p-STAT1 (S727) returned to baseline by 12 h (Fig. 3D). These results indicated that STAT1 might play a role in dasatinib-induced differentiation of AML cells.",

The endogenous expression of STAT1 was knocked down by shRNA. Of the 5 shRNA clones, two shRNA sequences that exhibited the strongest knockdown efficiency were selected to silence STAT1 expression in HL60 cells. As shown in Fig. 4A, expression of shSTAT1-1 and shSTAT1-2 significantly reduced STAT1 expression in HL60 cells compared with Vector or Non-target shRNA. As expected, silencing of STAT1 expression significantly inhibited dasatinib-induced AML differentiation. In detail, STAT1-knockdown HL60 cells showed markedly reduced NBT positive cells after dasatinib treatment compared with Vector and Non-target shRNA-expressing cells (78.5\u00b11.4, 83.1\u00b12.1, 48.7\u00b12.3, and 65.0\u00b13.4 for Vector, Non-target shRNA, shSTAT1-1, and shSTAT1-2, respectively; Fig. 4B). STAT1-knockdown HL60 cells also demonstrated significantly reduced CD11b expression after dasatinib treatment compared with Vector and Non-target shRNA-expressing cells (56.0\u00b16.3, 54.5\u00b16.1, 24.7\u00b18.5, and 36.5\u00b14.7 for Vector, Non-target shRNA, shSTAT1-1, and shSTAT1-2, respectively; Fig. 4C). Moreover, STAT1 shRNA-transduced cells exhibited less mature granulocyte morphology compared with Vector and Non-target shRNA-transduced cells, as evidenced by a decreased ratio of cytoplasm to nuclear (Fig. 4D). These results indicated that knockdown of STAT1 in HL60 cells resulted in a significantly decreased differentiation response to dasatinib stimulation.",

We then determined the effect of dasatinib on the phosphorylation of other MAPK family members, p38 and JNK.

The concentration of PD98059 to treat HL60 and NB4 were 20 and 10 \u00b5M, respectively, at which no cytotoxicity was observed in both cell lines when treated with PD98059 alone or in combination with dasatinib (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 7A, PD98059 significantly inhibited dasatinib-induced CD11b expression in both cells. In detail, the population of CD11b-positive cells decreased from 50% to 16% in HL60 cells and from 57% to 12% in NB4 cells in the presence of PD98059, respectively. In addition, PD98059 also significantly inhibited dasatinib-induced G0/G1 phase arrest, especially in NB4 cells of which the percentage of G0/G1 phase cells decreased from 80% to 40% (Fig. 7B). As expected, the activation of MEK and ERK was successfully inhibited by PD98059 (Fig. 7C and D). Interestingly, the phosphorylation of STAT1 on both sites (Y701 and S727) was strikingly inhibited by PD98059 in HL60 and NB4 cells. These results were further corroborated by another MEK inhibitor U0126. Dasatinib-induced CD11b expression decreased from 50% to 11% in the presence of U0126 (Fig. 5A). Western blotting analysis also confirmed that U0126 not only inhibited dasatinib-induced serine phosphorylation of STAT1 (S727), but also abrogated the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 (Y701) (Fig. 5B). Taken together, dasatinib-induced activation of STAT1 was dependent on MEK/ERK activation, thus leading to the differentiation of leukemic cells.",

            "text": "STAT family proteins, activated by cytokines, hormones, and growth factors function as transcription factors that mediate a variety of biologic processes, such as cell proliferation and apoptosis [31]. Among at least seven members, STAT1 has been reported to play essential roles in myeloid differentiation. STAT1 activation was first identified in ATRA-induced myeloid differentiation of various leukemia cell lines [32]. In addition, STAT1 was also reported to be activated by Bryostatin 1 to mediate the differentiation of chronic lymhocytic leukemia cells (CLL). Here we observed a significant increase of tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of STAT1 after dasatinib treatment, accompanied by the translocation of STAT1 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, thus leading to the enhanced transcription of STAT1 target genes. Silencing of STAT1 expression by shRNA significantly lessened dasatinib-induced differentiation, suggesting an essential role of STAT1 in dasatinib\u2019s differentiation effect. In addition, the phenomenon that the phosphorylation of STAT1 (Y701 and S727) returned to basal level or even lower in NB4 cells at late time after dasatinib treatment might be resulted from intracellular signals that triggered apoptosis of NB4 cells. In contrast to the tumor suppressor function of activated STAT1, STAT3 is mainly identified as an oncogene [33], [34]. Constitutive tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of STAT3 has been demonstrated in many different malignancies, including AML [35], [36]. Inhibition of STAT3 activation induces apoptosis in AML cell lines and primary samples [36]. However, the important roles for STAT3 in granulocytic differentiation have also been reported in vitro and in vivo studies [37], [38]. Thus, the exact role of STAT3 in leukemogenesis remains controversial. In our study, the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 was significantly down-regulated by dasatinib, while the serine phosphorylation of STAT3 was unaffected. A previous study has demonstrated that constitutive phosphorylation of STAT3 on serine 727, not tyrosine 705, was required for DNA-binding and transcription activation of target genes for survival [39]. Thus the serine phosphorylation of STAT3 here might disrupt apoptotic signal pathway caused by the decrease of tyrosine phosphorylation, thereby conferring a survival advantage that was necessary for differentiation of HL60 cells.",

In detail, dasatinib did not cause any changes in the levels of JAK1, JAK2 or Tyk2 phosphorylation and neither dasatinib-induced CD11b expression nor dasatinib-enhanced phosphorylation of STAT1 (Y701 or S727) was affected by JAK inhibitor AG490. Previous studies have shown that STAT1 was phosphorylated at serine site by several kinases, including MEK, ERK, JNK, p38 kinases and PI3K/AKT pathway. Here we found that MEK and ERK were significantly activated in dasatinib treated AML cells. However, the phosphorylation of p38 was totally abrogated by dasatinib except a recovery at 72 h and the phosphorylation of JNK and AKT were hardly changed after dasatinib treatment. We extended those observations to show that activation of MEK/ERK cascade was indispensible for dasatinib\u2019s differentiating effect. Critically, we showed that dasatinib-induced expression of CD11b and G0/G1 arrest were significantly inhibited by MEK inhibitors PD98059 and U0126. In line with these facts, dasatinib-induced phosphorylation of STAT1 (both tyrosine 701 and serine 727 sites) were inhibited by MEK inhibitors, indicating MEK/ERK-dependent STAT1 activation might be indispensable for the differentiation effect of dasatinib.",

On the contrary, dasatinib significantly induced the phosphorylation of MEK and ERK, which was approved to be indispensible for dasatinib\u2019s differentiating effect. This phenomenon could be partially explained by the fact that dasatinib is also a weak RAF inhibitor. Packer et al. [42] reported that the binding of weak RAF inhibitors (imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib) to BRAF and CRAF drives BRAF:CRAF heterodimer as well as BRCF and CRAF homodimer formation in the presence of oncogenetic RAS, thus leading to paradoxical activation of both BRAF and CRAF, followed by the activation of MEK and ERK. Considering the complex mechanisms involved in activation of Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway, further studies will be performed to better understand the effect of dasatinib-induced activation of MEK/ERK kinases in our future work.",
