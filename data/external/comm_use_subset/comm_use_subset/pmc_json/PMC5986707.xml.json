Patients were asked to score the severity of their dyspnea and cough by using the visual analog scale (VAS). The VAS is a horizontal line that is 100 mm in length and anchored by word descriptors at both ends. It uses absence of breathlessness or cough on one end and maximum breathlessness or cough on the other end. It is scored by measuring the distance from the left end to the mark indicated by the patient. A bacterially associated exacerbation was defined as colony-forming units greater than 107/mL sputum or a positive culture result. Microbiome communities were obtained from 16S rRNA sequencing of bacterial genomic DNA extracted from the sputum samples by using the Qiagen DNA Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif), as described previously.4 The sequencing reads were processed by using the QIIME pipeline.13 RNA was extracted from selected sputum plugs, and an RT-PCR panel for all common respiratory viruses (rhinoviruses, other picornaviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, human parainfluenza viruses 1-3, adenoviruses, influenza viruses A and B, coronavirus 229E and OC43, human metapneumovirus, and human bocavirus) was undertaken for the COPD samples, as described previously.4 For the asthma samples, the same methods were used, but virus detection was limited to rhinoviruses, other picornaviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza viruses A and B. A virus-associated exacerbation was defined as those exacerbations in which a virus was detected.",

First, factor analysis was applied to the panel of sputum inflammatory mediators and reduced to small independent factors. Sampling adequacy for factor analysis was assessed by using the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test. Optimal factors were retained based on scree plots (factors above the break in the curve) and eigenvalue of greater than 1. Subsequently, corresponding factor scores representing each patient were generated and used as input variables into the k-means clustering algorithm to identify the clusters. The optimal number of clusters was chosen based on a scree plot (clusters above the break in the curve) by plotting within the cluster sum of the squares against a series of a sequential number of clusters.",

Each cluster had different percentages of asthmatic patients and patients with COPD. Interestingly, the clusters seemed to demonstrate 3 distinct and biologically plausible inflammatory profiles. Cluster 1 was a COPD-predominant group, with evidence of neutrophilic inflammation, increased proinflammatory mediators, bacteria-associated exacerbations, and proportions of Proteobacteria and P/F ratio at the phylum level. Patients in cluster 2 exhibited evidence of eosinophilic inflammation, with increased levels of T2 mediators and proportion of Bacteroidetes. Patients in cluster 3 had greater T1 mediator levels and greater proportions of Actinobacteria and Firmicutes at the phylum level. Importantly, comparisons with assessments performed while the patients were stable demonstrated that levels of the proinflammatory, T2, and T1 mediators were increased at exacerbation in clusters 1, 2, and 3, respectively, whereas eosinophilic inflammation and T2 mediator levels were decreased in clusters 1 and 3 at exacerbation. In clusters 1 and 2 proinflammatory and T2 mediator levels were also increased in the stable state, respectively. Therefore our findings indicate that 3 exacerbation biologic clusters are shared between asthma and COPD. In addition, the inflammatory profiles in these clusters are increased compared with those in the stable state and are associated with distinct airway bacterial ecologies.",

This biologic cluster with high levels of interferon-inducible chemokines was not observed previously in patients with stable asthma and those with COPD.7 Because these chemokines have been identified as biomarkers of virus-associated exacerbations,4, 38, 39 it would seem likely that viral infections are possible triggers and that this cluster would be most amenable to future antiviral interventions. Consistently, the proportion of virus-associated exacerbations was greater in cluster 3, but this did not reach statistical significance between clusters with asthma and COPD combined or independently. Viral identification is challenging, especially because sputum viral load can peak before the peak of lower respiratory symptoms.40 Therefore our findings likely underrepresented the proportion of virus-associated exacerbations.",

The remaining patients were unable to produce sufficient sputum for analysis. The clinical characteristics between those who did versus those who did not provide samples for microbiological assessment were similar, suggesting these groups were comparable. We cannot exclude the possibility of an acquisition bias toward a microbial ecology associated with more sputum production. Notwithstanding this limitation, we did find consistent differences in the microbial ecology between the clusters.",

Therefore these findings need to be explored in larger multicenter studies. Another limitation of the size of the study is that we could not analyze the patients according to the severities of their asthma or COPD or the severities of exacerbations. We did not control for baseline therapy between asthmatic patients and patients with COPD; however, the corticosteroid dosages were very similar between the groups, which indicates this was unlikely to have had a differential effect on the underlying inflammatory or microbial profile. A limitation of cluster analysis is that it is specific to the data set studied, and therefore neither the asthma and COPD groups nor the stable visits can be analyzed independently to generate the proportions of the same clusters. This means cluster stability cannot be simply determined. However, we found that the patterns of the inflammatory profiles were similar for those asthmatic patients or patients with COPD between clusters; the patterns were similar between the stable and exacerbation state for the proinflammatory (cluster 1) and eosinophilic (cluster 2) phenotypes, with amplification of an underlying inflammatory profile at the exacerbation event. However, the T1 mediators that were increased at exacerbation in cluster 3 were not increased in the stable state. Whether the stable state mediator profiles can identify subjects most likely to respond to specific anti-inflammatory or antibiotic therapy to reduce future exacerbation risk requires further study. We included a large number of cytokines and chemokines in the analysis, but this still only reflects a minority of the number of mediators present in the sputum and serum samples. Because of limitations of the available sample, we could not extend the study to include other important mediators, such as eicosanoids and \u03b2-interferons. Metabolomic approaches, such as somologics, might provide more insight into the inflammatory mediator network and should be considered in future studies.",

We identified a COPD-predominant cluster with evidence of neutrophilic inflammation, increased proinflammatory mediator levels, and bacteria-associated exacerbations, a cluster with evidence of eosinophilic inflammation and increased T2 mediator levels and a cluster with increased T1 mediator levels. Our study aids in the understanding of the heterogeneity of asthma and COPD exacerbations and suggests that endotype might be more important than an asthma or COPD diagnosis. It highlights the need for further research in developing novel biomarkers to predict disease outcome and guide targeted therapies.Clinical implicationsSputum mediator and microbiome profiling can determine the distinct and overlapping asthma and COPD biologic exacerbation clusters, highlighting the heterogeneity of these exacerbations.",
