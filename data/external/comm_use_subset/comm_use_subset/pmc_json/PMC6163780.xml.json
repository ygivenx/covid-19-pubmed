            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea is characterized by severe watery diarrhea which causes dehydration and high mortality among piglets. The disease is due to porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which belongs to the family Coronaviridae and genus Alphacoronavirus, and has an envelope surrounding a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome [1]. The disease was first described in the United Kingdoms in 1971 [2], and has since widely spread not only to other European countries, but also to Asian countries including China, Korea, and Japan [3,4,5,6,7,8]. Notably, severe outbreaks caused by a strain genetically distinct from the prototype strain CV777 based on analysis of S genes, which encode spike proteins, have been reported in China since late 2010, with considerable morbidity and mortality among suckling piglets [9,10,11,12]. In April 2013, the disease was detected for the first time in the US, and was rapidly dispersed over 30 states in just one year [13,14]. There were mainly two different types of PEDV strains in the US based on analysis of the S genes: the original highly virulent strain (North American type), which is genetically closely related to strains that emerged in China since 2010, and a mildly virulent strain (S INDEL type) with insertions and deletions at the 5\u2019 end of the S gene [15,16]. US-like epidemics have also occurred in Canada and Mexico in North America, Korea and Taiwan in Asia, and Germany and Belgium in Europe [16,17,18,19,20,21,22].",

            "text": "In Japan, porcine epidemic diarrhea was first reported in 1982 [4]. In 1996, outbreaks occurred in 80,000 pigs at over 100 farms in nine prefectures, of which approximately half died. Although no cases were reported beginning in 2006, the disease re-emerged in October 2013. Thereafter, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (http://www.maff.go.jp) has reported over 1000 outbreaks across almost all (39/47) prefectures, killing approximately 500,000 pigs until July 2018. To investigate the cause of re-emergence, we analyzed the S genes in 38 PEDV strains collected from 18 prefectures between 2013 and 2014, and detected the North American type (n = 33), the S INDEL type (n = 4), and the S large-DEL type (n = 1), a novel variant with a large deletion of 582 nucleotides (194 amino acids) at the 5\u2019 end [23,24]. In addition, this analysis revealed that the strains are more similar to global PEDV strains detected in recent years than to classical strains detected in Japan decades ago. Moreover, a phylogenetic dendrogram constructed from complete genomes indicated that the strains are genetically closely related to strains widespread in the US and Korea in 2013\u20132014, and that the S large-DEL variant may have spontaneously arisen from strains already circulating in domestic pigs [24,25]. On experimental infections with the North American or the S large-DEL type, colostrum-deprived piglets, which are highly susceptible to pathogens, developed acute severe or moderate watery diarrhea, although the former was lethal while the other was not [26]. Moreover, the strains propagated in varying fashion to different tissues and formed different intestinal lesions.",

Especially, 52 nucleotides deletion in Spike/ORF3 junction in the CV777-niah can be predicted to result in the removal of seven amino acids from C-terminus of spike protein and loss of ORF3 protein expression as reported in a previous study [37]. In addition, we generated the recombinant and chimeric PEDV strains which replaced their ORF3 genes with GFP genes and, hence, these strains can also be expected to be complete loss of their ORF3 functions. Piglets inoculated with the CV777-niah and its recombinant form showed similar symptoms and patterns of fecal virus shedding, and survived throughout the experiment. In contrast, Pensaert et al. reported that pathogenicity of piglets inoculated with the prototype stain CV777 is identical to those observed by the North American PEDV stains [38]. The difference of pathogenicity between the CV777-niah and the prototype CV777 might be involved in nucleotide change by cell adaptation, especially loss of ORF3 function, because there are previous reports that ORF3 differentiation through cell adaptation is associated with reduced virulence [39,40,41].",

In contrast, in the second experiment, three five-day-old gnotobiotic piglets inoculated with the same S-chimeric strain (105.8 TCID50/head) died at 7 DPI after exhibiting anorexia, lethargy, severe dehydration, weight loss, and astasia in addition to severe watery diarrhea (Table 3). Moreover, two of three five-day-old gnotobiotic piglets inoculated with the S1-chimeric strain, rPEDVGFP-S1-OKN1 (105.8 TCID50/head) died at 5 DPI, and the other died at 7DPI with similar clinical signs as piglets inoculated with the S-chimeric strain. The discrepancy in mortality of piglets with the S-chimeric strain suggests to be associated with the difference of viral titers inoculated with piglets or the difference of age in onset of two experiment.",

Moreover, necropsy at 2 DPI indicated that viruses were predominantly restricted to the intestinal tract from jejunum to rectum, and to mesenteric lymph node (Figure 5). Previously, we reported that six-day-old colostrum-deprived piglets inoculated with OKN-1/JPN/2013, which is the source of S and S1 fragments inserted into chimeric PEDVs, showed severe clinical signs such as dehydration, weight loss, acute viral shedding in feces and sera from 1\u20132 DPI, and high virus titers in small and large intestines and mesenteric lymph node, and ultimately died by four days post-infection [26]. Thus, the chimeric strains with S and S1 genes from OKN-1/JPN/2013 appear to reproduce its virulence. Consequently, our data strongly suggests that the S gene, especially the S1 subunit, is an important factor of severe symptoms and mortality in piglets. The difference of pathogenicity in piglets using these recombinant viruses might be caused by the function of spike protein in virus entry or process of budding. In future, we would perform in vitro assay using these viruses to elucidate the mechanism.",

This results strongly supports the hypothesis that the S1 subunit is an important determinant of virulence, especially since we now demonstrate the opposite effect, in which virulence is conferred via S1 from a highly virulent strain upon an avirulent strain CV777-niah. In contrast, Wang et al. reported that the S gene is necessary but not sufficient for the virulence, based on experimental infections with various chimeric PEDVs [33]. However, these experiments were based on conventional piglets, while we and Hou et al. used gnotobiotic piglets, so results may not be directly comparable, especially since there were clear differences in pathogen susceptibility between conventional and gnotobiotic piglets. In any case, further studies based on reverse genetics are needed to clarify the function and role of other PEDV genes.",
