Previous studies [2\u20134] have shown the importance of RSV in hospitalized children in Vietnam. Hospital records from the two main paediatric referral centers in Ho Chi Minh City show that 77% of hospitalized children with LRTI are under 2 years old (unpublished data). In addition, severe disease from RSV infection seems to exclusively occur in this population [3, 5]. However, information on detailed clinical, epidemiological features and virological characteristics of RSV infections (e.g. disease burden, demographics, seasonal variations of RSV and other viral infections, circulating genotypes and subgroups, viral load) or on the frequency / impact of other respiratory viruses among Vietnamese children under two years old are limited [6].",

Patients admitted to the RW are typically those that initially present to the outpatient clinics and were subsequently indicated for admission, while those admitted to ECU or ICU typically presented with more severe symptoms. Inclusion criteria were age between 1 month to 2 years, cough, a clinical diagnosis of LRTI based on WHO criteria [7], and onset of symptoms \u2264 4 days prior to hospital admission. Exclusion criteria were patients with known non-respiratory or non-infectious respiratory diseases such as asthma.",

Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient was used to assess a general monotonic trend between two continuous variables. A simple linear regression model was used to measure linear associations between RSV viral load and age or day of illness or number of leucocytes in blood. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to assess risk factors for severe disease or long hospitalization. The following variables were considered for the models: age, sex, premature birth, previous hospitalization for respiratory illness, other household members sick at home, living with smoker(s), number of members at home, fever, RSV infection (RSV positivity, viral load, and subgroup) and RV infection (RV positivity as single infection or co-infection with RSV). The models\u2019 predictive ability was investigated by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the model (AUC), i.e the higher the AUC the better prediction power the model has. The Hosmer\u2014Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test was done to assess model adequacy. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test of goodness-of-fit tests the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the observed and predicted values of the response variables. Therefore, when the test is not significant (p>0.05) the null hypothesis cannot be rejected and this means that the model fits the data well. Risk factors for disease severity or long hospitalization were further assessed using odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). All statistical tests were performed as two-tailed tests at 5% significance in either R version 2.13.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) or Intercooled Stata version 9.2 (College Station, TX, USA).",

We observed that RSV load at enrolment was significantly related to long hospitalization in univariate analysis, but this was not confirmed in the multivariate analysis; and RSV infection, RSV viral load, RSV subgroups and RSV slope (i.e RSV load dynamic between two time points: admission and discharge, it was calculated by dividing the difference of viral load at admission and at discharge by the number of days between these two time points\u2014data not shown), did not correlate to disease severity or long hospitalization. Only young age and fever were independent predictors for disease severity in both populations (study population and RSV population). Reports about the relation between RSV infection [30, 31] or RSV load [12, 26, 32, 33] or RSV subgroups [34\u201338] and disease severity have been contradicting. Marguet et al. reported that RSV infection caused more severe disease than RV infection among children under 1 year of age. In a study by Tran et al. conducted in Children Hospital 2, Ho Chi Minh City, targeting hospitalized children under 15 years, RSV positive children had significantly higher clinical severity scores compared to RSV-negatives. However, this comparison was based on univariate analysis without considering other confounding factors such as age [6]. Papadopoulos et al. found, among children less than 18 months, that the presence of RV increases the risk for severe disease significantly, by approximately five-fold. RSV infection was also correlated with severity, however, this did not reach significance [30, 31]. RSV loads at the second collection had a significant negative correlation (correlation = -0.33, p-value = 0.009) with day of illness, while this correlation was not found for the enrolment samples which were collected on any day during the first days of illness (S2 Fig). This RSV load trend during RSV infection was also observed in other studies [39] and confirmed the study samples were collected on the early day of RSV illness.",

Similar to other studies, we observed a significantly lower proportion of co-infections in severe cases compared to non-severe cases [21, 41]. However, among RSV infected cases, we did not observe significant differences in disease severity between single and co-infected cases. In addition, there were significant differences between RSV-RV coinfections (3/45, 6.6%) versus RSV-EnV (9/27, 75%)\u2013Fisher\u2019s exact p-value = 0.006 but no significant versus RSV-AdV co-infections (2/18, 11%). Interestingly, and in agreement with Papadopoulos et al. [31], although RV was detected mostly as a coinfection, RV single infection was identified as an independent risk factor of severe disease. This finding should be interpreted with caution because the role of RV in the pathogenesis of severe LRTI remains a topic of debate [30, 31, 42\u201347]. Cross-reactivity in the PCR detection of EnV and RV using 5\u2019UTR primers is a known problem, particularly for EV-D68 which has a rhinoviral 5\u2019 UTR sequence, and this complicates ascertainment of EnV and RV diagnoses [48].",

The clear shift of RSV subgroups was not observed during the period 2005 to 2007 [3] but we observed this in our current study and Tran et al. also confirmed the dominance of RSV A during the same period [6]. In many studies, RSV has been reported as a highly seasonal infection and RSV outbreaks are frequently associated with the rainy season in areas with tropical and sub-tropical climate [5, 49]. Possible explanations for this include meteorological effects such as humidity and UVB radiation on the environmental stability of RSV viruses. The stability of RSV in aerosols was shown to increase with higher humidity [50]. Moreover, population behaviors as staying indoors during cold or rainy seasons may facilitate transmission of RSV.",

Secondly, only a limited number of patients were enrolled as compared to the total number of LRTI hospitalizations in two hospitals during the study period (632/45134, 1%) although the number of enrolled patients followed a similar pattern as the total number of patients (Fig 1).",
