            "text": "Influenza A virus is a common cause of respiratory disease in swine. The virus also infects other species including humans and birds. Influenza A viruses are classified into different subtypes based on the surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). So far, 17 different HA and 10 different NA subtypes have been described [1-4]. The predominant swine influenza virus (SIV) subtypes worldwide are H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2, all of which show considerable diversity within each subtype. Until the emergence of the pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 (H1N1pdm09) virus, which possesses a \u201cclassical-swine\u201d H1 HA gene, the European H1N1 SIV belonged exclusively to the \u201cavian-like\u201d lineage of SIV with all eight gene segments of avian origin [5] or they were reassortants hereof retaining the \u201cavian-like\u201d H1 HA. European H3N2 SIV are human-avian reassortants retaining the HA and NA genes from human H3N2 virus, whereas the remaining gene segments originate from \u201cavian-like\u201d H1N1 SIV [6]. H1N2, which is the most recently recognized new European SIV subtype, was first reported from Great Britain in 1995 [7]. This virus possessed an HA closely related to that of human A/England/80-like H1N1 viruses, an NA probably derived from a swine H3N2 virus, and internal gene segments of avian origin [8]. Subsequent spread of related \u201chuman-like\u201d H1N2 viruses has been reported from several European countries (Italy and France [9], Belgium [10], Germany [11] and Spain [12]) including reassortments containing HA from the \u201chuman-like\u201d H1N2 [13]. \u201cHuman-like\u201d H1N2 viruses (so-called delta clade viruses) have also been reported from North America [14] but other H1N2 viruses that are circulating in North America and Asia [15-19] contain HA genes of \u201cclassical-swine\u201d H1N1 origin descending from the very first SIVs, which were isolated from pigs in USA in 1930 [20] and resemble human viruses responsible for the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. Since the emergence of the H1N1pdm09 virus in swine, several descendant reassortant viruses have been recognized, including H1N2 with all genes from the pandemic virus except the N2 [21] and an H1N2 with HA and NA from the \u201chuman-like\u201d swine H1N2 and the rest of the genes from H1N1pdm09 virus [22]. H1N2 viruses with \u201cavian-like\u201d H1 have earlier been reported from France and Italy [9,23], but without having been established in the regional pig populations. In Denmark, the H1N2 subtype was first recognized in a lung tissue sample from a pig with coughing, fever and panting, showing indications of bronchopneumonia. This pig was submitted to the National Veterinary Institute for diagnosis of SIV in 2003. The detected virus (A/swine/Denmark/12687/2003(H1N2) had an \u201cavian-like\u201d H1, and this reassorted H1N2 subtype has since then continuously been detected from lung tissue and nasal swabs from Danish pigs throughout the country, and is now established in Denmark (unpublished data). Prior to 2003, only the H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes had been isolated in Denmark [24]. The \u201cavian-like\u201d H1N2 has been reported previously from Sweden and Italy [25-27]. The aim of the present study was to make a genetic characterization of the Danish reassorted \u201cavian-like\u201d H1N2 virus and to compare the cross-protection and infection dynamics of the reassorted \u201cavian-like\u201d H1N2 with the older endemic \u201cavian-like\u201d H1N1 virus.",

            "text": "Viruses included in the study are listed in Table 1 with GenBank accession numbers. The phylogenetic analysis at the nucleotide level showed that the HA of the Danish H1N2 SIV\u00b4s was closely related to the HA gene of concurrently circulating Danish H1N1 viruses, whereas the NA gene was closely related to that of concurrent H3N2 viruses (Figures 1 and 2). The HA gene was of the avian-like lineage and the identity to the concurrent Danish H1N1 viruses was 93\u201396% (Table 2). The identity of the HA gene between the Danish H1N2 viruses and the reference virus A/swine/Scotland/410440/1994(H1N2) as well as contemporary European human-like H1N2 viruses from Germany were ~73%. The NA gene of the Danish H1N2 viruses clustered phylogenetically with concurrent Danish H3N2 viruses with an identity between 91\u201399% (Table 2). The nucleotide sequence comparisons of all gene segments are shown in Table 3 and phylogenetic trees for the internal genes are shown in Figure 3. The nucleotide sequences of the internal genes of two H1N2 isolates were determined and they showed a high degree of identity with those of either the H1N1 and/or H3N2 Danish contemporary SIV isolates (93\u201399% nucleotide identity). The comparisons also revealed that A/swine/Denmark/13608/2004(H1N2) had more genes with high identity to A/swine/Denmark/14348-9/2003(H3N2) than to A/swine/Denmark/14348-3/2003(H1N1), whereas A/swine/Denmark/12687/2003(H1N2) was more identical to A/swine/Denmark/14348-3/2003(H1N1). The phylogenetic analyses (Figure 1, 2, and 3) supported two clusters represented by A/swine/Denmark/13608/2004(H1N2) and A/swine/Denmark/12687/2003(H1N2), respectively. In general the internal genes of the Danish reassortant H1N2 viruses clustered phylogenetically with European viruses and separated from American \u201cclassical-swine\u201d H1 and H1pdm09 virus strains. In all gene segments, A/swine/Denmark/13608/2004(H1N2) had a very high nucleotide identity (HA gene ~96%, NA gene ~96%) to H1N2 reassortant viruses detected in Sweden and Italy in 2009 and 2010 (Table 2) containing avian-like H1 and N2 from H3N2 SIV, and they group closely together in the phylogenetic trees. At the amino acid level, seven N-glycosylation sites (positions 28, 40, 71, 179, 291, 498, 557) were predicted for A/swine/Denmark/13608/2004(H1N2) in the HA protein, whereas only 4 sites (positions 28, 40, 498, 557) were predicted in A/swine/Denmark/12687/2003(H1N2). The Italian A/swine Italy/58769/2010(H1N2) had conserved glycosylation sites similar to A/swine/Denmark/13608/2004(H1N2), but had an additional predicted site at position 212. The Swedish viruses showed all the predicted glycosylation sites of the A/swine/Denmark/13608/2004(H1N2) virus except for 71 or 179 in 2010 and 2009, respectively. In the receptor binding domain of the HA protein, all Danish H1 viruses as well as the Swedish and Italian viruses had a D in position 190. In position 225, A/swine/Denmark/13608/2004(H1N2) and the Italian virus had K, whereas the A/swine/Denmark/12687/2003(H1N2) had an E. The Swedish viruses had a 225 T motif similar to the Danish A/swine/Denmark/13411/2004(H1N2) and A/swine/Denmark/13880/2004(H1N2) viruses. The NA sequences of the Danish H1N2 viruses showed no indication of resistance to NA-inhibitors, whereas all the Danish M sequences deduced resistance against amantadine.",

The phylogenetic analyses showed that the genes of the reassorted H1N2 virus had very high identity to contemporary H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes circulating in Danish pigs in 2003. Based on the sequence analysis, the Danish H1N2 subtypes apparently arose by two independent reassortment events. This is sustained by the full-genome sequencing analysis which revealed a closer relationship of the two analysed H1N2 isolates internal genes to Danish H1N1 and H3N2, respectively, than to each other. It is also interesting that all of the other sequenced Danish H1N2 viruses phylogenetically grouped together with A/swine/Denmark/13608/2004(H1N2), and that A/swine/Denmark/12687/2003(H1N2) formed a separate cluster. Interestingly, H1N2 viruses with high sequence similarity to the Danish H1N2 in all gene segments were recently reported from Sweden (A/swine/Sweden/1021/2009(H1N2) and A/swine/Sweden/9706/2010(H1N2)) and Italy (A/swine/Italy/58769/2009(H1N2)) [25-27]. The viruses from Sweden and Italy had the highest level of similarity to the A/swine/Denmark/13608/2004(H1N2) based on phylogeny and amino acid markers. The A/swine/Denmark/13608/2004(H1N2) had seven predicted glycosylation sites in the HA-protein compared to the A/swine/Denmark/12687/2003(H1N2) which had 4 sites. Glycosylation of the HA protein is important for virulence and antigenic masking of influenza A virus and could be the reason for the more successful establishment of the A/swine/Denmark/13608/2004(H1N2) virus [28,29]. At the receptor binding domain of the HA-protein, a different motif at position 225 was seen for the A/swine/Denmark/12687/2003(H1N2) compared to the other H1N2 viruses confirming a difference between the clusters. The H1N2 virus was detected in Denmark for the first time in 2003, approximately 6\u20137 years before it was found in Sweden. A publication from 2012 regarding Italian H1N2 SIV reports a retrospective finding of the \u201cavian-like\u201d H1N2 in samples from 2002 [27]. Before the discovery of the Danish H1N2 subtype, subtyping of SIV in Denmark was performed using HI-test. The HI-test only subtypes the HA of influenza A virus and the reassortant H1N2 virus may easily have been missed. Thus, due to the lack of systematic surveillance data in Europe at that time, the exact geographical origin of the new H1N2 subtype cannot be documented. Nevertheless, we speculate that the reassortment event happened between two Danish strains of H1N2 and H3N2 and subsequently spread to other European countries by export of living pigs. This hypothesis is supported by the full genome characterisation of the new reassorted viruses which showed that all gene segments were almost identical to genes of contemporary Danish H1N1 or H3N2 isolates. Furthermore, Denmark has a minimal import of live pigs from other countries which hamper introduction of new isolates. Accordingly, Denmark is free from the \u201chuman-like\u201d H1N2 SIV which has been prevalent in central Europe for the last decades. The introduction of the virus into Sweden and Italy can be explained by the import of pigs from Denmark since pigs are not routinely tested for SIV in connection to export. Indeed, according to the National Association of Pig Breeders in Italy (ANAS), the import of living swine to Italy from Denmark is substantial. Taken together the Danish \u201cavian-like\u201d H1N2 subtype may be the first H1N2 subtype established within a pig population which possesses an HA of avian-like H1N1 origin.",

Most European H1N2 viruses are closely related to A/swine/Scotland/4104/1994(H1N2) having an HA of human origin [9]. As an exception, A/swine/Italy/2064/1999(H1N2) has an HA gene related to the Danish H1N2 HA gene, and to concurrent Italian H1N1 and other European avian-like H1N1 viruses [9]. However, the NA gene of A/swine/Italy/2064/1999(H1N2) is closely related to NA genes of European H1N2 viruses, contrary to the Danish subtype which has an NA gene closer related to that of concurrent Danish H3N2 viruses. Thus, A/swine/Italy/2064/1999(H1N2) may be a reassortment of avian-like H1N1 and A/swine/Scotland/4104/94(H1N2)-like viruses. There have been no further reports on this virus, so this reassortant virus probably was unsuccessful in becoming established in the local and regional pig population. Recently, reassortments containing genes from the H1N1pdm09 virus have occurred i.e. an H1N2 with all genes from the pandemic virus except the N2 [21] and an H1N2 with HA and NA from the European swine H1N2 and the rest of the genes from the pandemic virus [22]. These findings further sustain the need for continuous SIV monitoring nationally and sharing of SIV surveillance data internationally.",

The virus load in the lungs and the nasal excretions were slightly higher for the H1N2 infected pigs, however, the difference between groups was not statistically significant. In the pigs euthanized PID 4, virus was present in high amounts in most of the lung sections and did not show a predilection for any particular lung lobe, even though the macroscopic changes were more pronounced in the cranial parts. This is in accordance with findings of De Vleeschauwer et al.[30] who also were unable to demonstrate a particular pattern in virus titres in cranial and caudal lung lobes after an H1N1 infection in pigs. Initial reports from the field in 2004 claimed that the severity and duration of clinical signs elicited in response to the H1N2 virus was more severe compared with the H1N1 or H3N2 viruses, respectively (unpublished data). However, the results only provided a non-significant tendency for the H1N2 virus to be more virulent than the H1N1 virus. Apparently, the pigs elicited no clinical signs in response to experimental inoculation. The pigs were specific laboratory raised animals of high sanitary status free from the majority of pathogens known to cause disease in pigs [31]. They were kept in isolation without any contact to other animals eliminating the risk of exposure to new pathogens during the experiment. Furthermore, the pigs were not exposed to the same stress as pigs housed under field conditions and they had plenty of room and grooming material. This is probably the explanation for the lack of clinical signs even though the pigs clearly were infected as revealed by a slight rise in body temperature 1\u20133 days after challenge, the development of specific SIV antibodies, and the induction of an acute phase protein response following both the primary and the secondary inoculations. These observations further sustain that the clinical consequences of swine influenza virus infections under field conditions are highly dependent on management and the general health status of the herds.",

After the second inoculation at PID 28, no or very low levels of nasal virus excretion was detected and only for one day which firmly indicate that there is a high level of cross-protection between the subtypes. An antibody response was elicited after inoculation of the first virus isolate and the response was boosted when the pigs were re-inoculated with the second virus isolate. Haptoglobin and CRP responses to primary infection with H1N1 and H1N2 were very similar. In contrast, no SSA response to primary infection with H1N2 was seen. Pomorska-M\u00f3l et al.[32] showed data on the induction of pig acute phase proteins CRP, haptoglobin and SAA after single experimental infection with a Polish \u201chuman-like\u201d H1N2 SIV subtype and found a rapid and substantial increase in CRP, haptoglobin, and SAA. In the present study sampling was not performed at PID 2 and 3, therefore an SAA response to the primary H1N2 infection might have been missed. The results, however, corroborate well the results of Pomorska-M\u00f3l et al. showing pronounced haptogobin and CRP responses at day 4 post infection with H1N2. Taken together, these data indicated that infection with either H1N1 or H1N2 induces a high level of cross-protection against infection with the other virus. This was expected since the HA of the two subtypes is of the same \u201cavian-like\u201d origin.",

The duration of virus excretion following the primary H1N1 and H1N2 inoculation was comparable; however, the amount of virus excreted was approximately six-fold higher for pigs infected with H1N2 compared to H1N1 infected pigs. The H1N2 subtype has been very successful in spreading and constitute now 20% of the circulating subtypes in Danish pigs (own unpublished observations). The reason for this is not known but it\u2019s interesting that this virus has succeeded in spreading despite existing immunity against the H protein of the H1N1 subtypes that has been circulating in Denmark since the mid-1980s.",

The \u201cavian-like\u201d H1N2 differs from other H1N2 subtypes in most of Europe and USA. There are two clusters of the Danish H1N2 variant and one of them seems to have spread to countries like Sweden and Italy. The experimental study shows comparable infection dynamic between the \u201cavian-like\u201d H1N2 and \u201cavian-like\u201d H1N1 with a tendency of the H1N2 to have a slightly larger impact on lungs. There were no clear clinical sign except elevated body temperature under the experimental conditions. Systemic responses to both virus subtypes were recognised by a clear antibody and acute phase response and there were a clear cross-protection between the two subtypes of \u201cavian-like\u201d H1N2 and \u201cavian-like\u201d H1N1.",
