            "text": "The chicken reproductive tract is divided into five histologically distinct parts, the ovary, infundibulum, magnum, isthmus, and shell gland (uterus). The shell gland is an expanded pouch-like part of the oviduct where an egg remains for approximately 18\u201320 hours, during which shell formation takes place [1]. The next ovulation occurs 0.5 hour after the preceding oviposition [2]. Calcification of the eggshell is associated with stimuli initiated by ovulation or by neuroendocrine factors that control and coordinate both ovulation and calcium secretion [3]. The eggshell is a highly ordered bio-ceramic (about 5 g calcium) of fused calcite crystalline cones, formed on a protein skeleton with distinct layers and regular pores [4]. Like other epithelial cells, the shell gland epithelium provides antimicrobial protection for both hen and egg; thus, it is a rich source of anti-microbial proteins [5].",

            "text": "Approximately 437 peptides and ion transporters have been identified as being involved in the formation of three distinct layers of the eggshell [6, 7]. However, the mechanisms of egg and eggshell biogenesis in relation to the origin and flow of the precursors at various stages of egg formation are not fully understood. The biosynthetic pathway of protoporphyrin IX (PP IX) is important in the formation of the eggshell as it contributes to the shell colour. PP IX is an immediate precursor of heme and a major component of brown eggshell pigment. To date, there is little information about the origin of its precursors and how PP IX is inhibited from converting into heme through the enzymatic activity of ferrochelatase in the shell gland of laying hens. Furthermore, it is not clear how many genes are involved in the PP IX synthesis, ultimate transportation across cell membranes and subsequent deposition into distinct eggshell layers. In the shell gland, hundreds of genes that are differentially expressed between juvenile and mature laying hens have been identified [8]. It is assumed that some genes express differentially in relation to the formation of distinct layers of the eggshell. Furthermore, the expression of genes associated with epithelial differentiation and tissue remodelling may vary with different levels of estrogen secretion in the presence or absence of an egg [9].",

            "text": "Nicarbazin is one of the various factors that causes lower production and/or deposition of PP IX into eggshell, when fed at recommended dosages (50\u2013125 mg/kg of feed) to brown-egg laying hens [10, 11]. It is a chemically produced drug composed of a complex equimolar amount of 4,40-dinitrocarbanilide (DNC) and 2-hydroxy-4,6-dimethylpyrimidine (HDP) and is registered for use in poultry fattening and for treating coccidiosis [10, 12]. It is used either in pure or combined forms as a feed additive in poultry production [13]. Its effects on eggshell colour, which are dosage and time dependent, are reversible [14]. The pharmacodynamics of nicarbazin in the shell gland are not yet known, and the way it acts at the molecular level to alter the synthesis and/or deposition of PP IX into eggshells at different stages of shell formation needs to be further investigated. Therefore, we anticipate that the responses of the genes involved in the PP IX synthesis pathway to nicarbazin will shed some light on its actions in the alteration of eggshell colour deposition. Nicarbazin was used as a model as residues of this drug in feed are still a problem of loss in shell colour particularly in Australia. In addition, investigation of the molecular basis of nicarbazin effects on shell colour may shed light on the mechanisms of shell colour loss in commercial laying flocks from other causes.",

            "text": "The transcriptional profiling in the shell gland is different from other parts of the oviduct, such as the magnum and isthmus [7]. Thus, data on differential gene expression in the shell gland are needed and, therefore, selection of reference genes for gene expression analysis as a normalization approach is paramount. To the best of our knowledge, no studies have been performed to identify suitable reference genes for the normalization of quantitative PCR (qPCR) gene expression data in the shell gland of chickens. Traditionally, the most commonly used housekeeping genes, such as ACTB, TUBB, and GAPDH have been selected as generic reference genes. However, ample evidence has shown that the expression of these genes may not be constant across a range of experimental conditions and tissues under investigation [15\u201320]. Thus, it is now recommended to use these genes only as reference genes for normalization when prior analysis of their expression stability has been carried out [21], to ensure that cellular expression level of the reference genes is virtually identical under different conditions in the study. It is also recommended that more than one reference gene be employed to achieve more robust, accurate and reliable normalization of gene expression data [22].",

            "text": "Of the available statistical software, three distinct tools have been frequently reported in the literature for ranking the overall expression stabilities of the reference genes as normalizers for gene expression studies. The geNorm module in qbase+ software version 3.0 (Biogazelle, Belgium) calculates the gene expression stability (geNorm M) as the arithmetic mean of the pairwise variation (geNorm V) between all tested genes [22, 23]. The geNorm V for any given two genes is the standard deviation calculated from the log2 transformed relative quantities between those two genes [22]. Before analysis, qbase+ pre-processes the data for efficiency correction, inter-run calibration, bad replicates removal and conversion to relative quantities [23]. The relative quantities are then converted to either linear or log transformed scale. The current geNorm tool does limit the minimum number of genes to 8, unlike to its previous Excel based version. qbase+ allows easy exchange of data between users, and exports tabulated data for further statistical analysis using dedicated software. The most stably expressed gene produces the lowest geNorm M value. The most stable reference gene is determined by step-wise exclusion of the least stable genes [22]. geNorm eliminates the genes sequentially and thus a differentially expressed gene does not affect the ultimate outcomes from the analysis. Therefore, geNorm is usually less sensitive to differentially expressed genes initially included in the assay. Good reference genes have an M < 0.5 and CV (Coefficient of variance) <0.2, while M values up to 1 are acceptable for more difficult samples [23]. The cut-off value for geNorm V is 0.15. geNorm does not consider treatment groups and all samples are treated as being from a single population. NormFinder (GenEx version 6.0.1) calculates the standard deviation (SD) of the genes relative to the mean expression of all the genes in the panel [24]. It calculates a global average expression of all the genes in all the samples, to which the individual genes are compared. Based on this comparison, SD for each reference gene is estimated. Furthermore, if the samples are from different treatment groups, NormFinder separates the variation into an intragroup and an intergroup contribution [24, 25]. Hence, a low stability value reflects low inter- and intra-group variation. Similar to qbase+, GenEx does have an option to highlight bad replicates during data analysis and thus bad replicates can be excluded from the analysis easily. In the GenEx version 6.0.1, the data pre-processing is very similar to that explained in the qbase+ section. In addition, the data in GenEx, can be also converted to logarithmic scale, such as log2, log10, 1n and log(X+1). An Excel based BestKeeper (Version 1) software is used to determine the best stable reference genes based on Pearson correlation coefficient (r), coefficient of variance (CV) and standard deviation (SD). Only genes with a high r and low SD values are combined into BestKeeper index (BKI) value using the geometric mean of their Cq values [26]. The BKI is calculated from the geometric mean of the candidates Cq values for each specific sample [26]. The most stable reference genes are the ones with the lowest SD values and highest coefficients of correlation with the BKI [26]. BestKeeper also uses a statistical algorithm wherein the Pearson correlation coefficient for each candidate reference gene pair is calculated along with the probability of correlation significance of the pair [26]. Overall, a generalized opinion from the literature and scientific forums can be summarised: geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper basically provide similar outcomes for the overall stability of candidate reference genes.",

The most stable genes were selected on the basis of the stability of the genes across the three software. Furthermore, four candidate target genes encoding either enzymes or peptide transporter were chosen to compare the outcomes from the data by the two most and the two least stable reference genes. The solute carrier family 25, member 38 (SLC25A38), located on mitochondrial membrane, transports glycine into mitochondria for the synthesis of aminolevulinic acid, the first step in the synthesis of PP IX [27]. The delta-aminolevulinate synthase 1 (ALAS1) gene encodes a rate limiting non-erythroid enzyme that catalyses the reaction of succinyl co-enzyme A with glycine to form delta-aminolevulinic acid within the mitochondrial matrix [28]. Coproporphyrinogen oxidase (CPOX) gene encodes an enzyme in the PP IX biosynthetic pathway that converts coproporphyrinogen III into protoporhyrinogen III [29]. Ferrochelatase (FECH) gene encodes FECH enzyme, which converts PP IX into heme [30, 31]. The outcome of the study provides a set of reference genes that are expressed in a relatively constant level for all the birds sampled at different time-points of eggshell formation and in response to treatment with nicarbazin.",

The input data for qbase+ were generated using the relative quantities based on comparative quantification cycle (Cq). To be consistent, the Cq values for 18S rRNA, which were from 10\u22124 dilutions, were adjusted according to 1:100 dilutions. Any triplicate reaction with difference more than 0.5 cycle was excluded from the analysis. To select the most stable genes, geNorm re-calculates the M stability measures after removing the least stable genes and repeats the process until the one most stable gene remains [22, 23]. To test the minimum number of reference genes, geNorm calculates a pairwise variation (geNorm V) based on Vn/n+1 and a higher value indicates a significant effect of additional gene on data normalization. Normally, the benefit of using an extra (n+1)th reference gene is limited as soon as the Vn/n+1 value drops below the 0.15 threshold. Due to its sequential elimination of less stable genes so as to produce less bias on the output of analysis, this program was used as the primary base for the selection of the reference genes.",

The pairwise variation (geNorm V) also chose HPRT1 and HMBS as the best set of genes to be used for expression data analysis (Fig 3B). The geNorm V value of HPRT1 and HMBS, which was 0.086, indicated that stepwise inclusion of the next most stable reference gene (18S rRNA) is not necessary for data normalization. In line with geNorm M results, all ten reference genes showed geNorm V <0.15 (a default cut-off value). The results of NormFinder and BestKeeper analyses were slightly different from those of the geNorm. NormFinder ranked 18S rRNA and RPL4 as the two most stable reference genes, while the two most stable reference genes in BestKeeper were 18S rRNA and HPRT1 (Table 5). Nevertheless, all the genes analysed by NormFinder and BestKeeper had SD < 1.0, showing that these genes were overall stably expressed in the tissue under investigation. The two least stable reference genes across all the three statistical tools were CA2 and ACTB (Table 5).

NormFinder ranked HMBS and RPL4, while the BestKeeper showed HPRT1 and HMBS as the two most stable genes (Table 6).

In fact, most of the ten reference genes tested in the current study were in the acceptable range as reference genes with geNorm M value <0.5 and SD <1.0. B2M was the only exception that showed slightly higher geNorm M value in the time-points and nicarbazin treatment study. Taking time-points separately, or together with the nicarbazin treatment, the pairwise variation (geNorm V) showed that the variation between the first two most stable genes was under the cut-off value (<0.15). In qbase+, geNorm V indicates level of variation in the average values of reference gene stability with the sequential inclusion of the next stable reference gene to the equation Vn/n+1 (for calculation of the normalization factor). The analysis starts with the two most stably expressed genes being compared to the pair including the third (V2/3), and the process continues until the least stable gene is added (for example, V9/10). Generally, if a geNorm V (V2/3) of 0.300 is achieved using two most stable genes and a geNorm V (V3/4) of 0.14 is achieved with three most stable reference genes, then the average of the most stable three genes would be the optimal normalization factor for further data analysis. In the current study, the first two most stable reference genes were under the cut-off value (<0.15) of geNorm V and thus adding the third most stable reference gene for expression data normalization was not necessary. However, as indicated by the geNorm V, all of the genes (V2/3 to V9/10) showed pairwise variation < 0.15 and thus all could be used for accurate data normalization. Based on the geNorm V results, this demonstrates that all the genes analysed had relatively high stability in the shell gland tissue in response to nicarbazin treatment of chickens as well as to the cyclic changes in shell gland tissue during the egg lying cycle. Based on geNorm M results, B2M showed low expression stability in response to the stages of egg formation in the nicarbazin treatment experiment and therefore should be ruled out from being used in the normalisation of expression data while different stages of egg formation are involved in the study.",

In different species, different reference genes under different treatments have been validated in other tissues of the reproductive system. For example, in geese, HPRT1 and GAPDH were ranked as the two most stable reference genes in the ovary [42]. In bovine, the two most stable reference genes in the uterus were YWHAZ and GAPDH in relation to developmental stages of an embryo [43]. Similarly, under various toxicological treatments, in the ovary of mouse, the two most stable reference genes were RPL13a and GAPDH [44]. Based on limited studies already being performed, it appears HPRT1 may be more stable in the reproductive system of avian species while GAPDH is more stable in mammalian species [40].

Similar discrepancies have been observed elsewhere with different species and treatments [42, 45, 46]. So far, there is no consensus as to which software is more powerful in the ranking of expression stability of candidate reference genes and researchers have given the same weight to all three programs. We have shown in this study a comparison in the consistency of the ranking of candidate reference genes among all the three software used in both experiments, indicating that all of them gave similar results and can be used for the analysis of expression data. As has been stated previously, the stability of all the chosen reference genes was in the acceptable range for reference genes. Therefore, the stability levels of these genes are essentially very close. With different algorithms in different programs, slight change of their stability orders can be expected by the analyses using these programs.",

            "text": "It is worth noting; however, that these three programs do not have an option for analysing the reference gene expression data generated from a factorial design, but can only perform analysis based on individual group as independent treatment. To the best of our knowledge, the optimisation of reference genes has not been performed in such a factorial design so far. Therefore, it is questionable whether the programs possess the capacity to generate a reliable ranking for an experiment designed in a factorial fashion. The gene expression stability analysis of reference genes has been reported in experiments exploring the roles of multiple factors; for example, geographical locations and ventilation in new born lambs [47], multiple stress conditions and different developmental tissues in pear millet [48] and different developmental stages and hormonal stimuli on leaves of tea [49]. However, multiple factors have not been considered as independent effects in the analysis of stability of reference gene expression or for their interactions. We suggest these programs should add such a capacity or new programs should be available for the analyses of data produced from factorial design experiments. This would permit the role of treatments in the expression stability of the reference genes to be more robustly investigated and their interactions explored. Such investigations are warranted to provide a more powerful statistical analysis protocol.",
