Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) caused by infection is a typical condition within which proinflammatory mediators released from infected cells and persistent hypercytokinemia may result in progression to multiple organ failure [2]. It is known that activation of cytokine networks increases levels of various cytokines in blood. The burst of cytokine release that follows sepsis, toxin-mediated shock syndrome (e.g., Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus) [3, 4], some virus infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [5], influenza [6], dengue virus [7], and Epstein-Barre virus [8] induce an overwhelming stimulation of innate and/or immune responses that storm the physiology of the body.",

            "text": "Human enterovirus (EV71) is member of the genus Enterovirus, family Picornaviridae, which consists of a nonenveloped capsid surrounding a core of single-stranded, positive-polarity RNA approximately 7.5 kb in size and 27\u201330 nm in diameter [9, 10]. EV71 produces a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations. The majority of infected individuals have asymptomatic infection. Mild cases are characterized as cutaneous diseases such as hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) and herpangina. However, potentially life-threatening neurological complications such as brain stem encephalitis (BE) are of the greatest clinical and public concern [11\u201314]. EV71 has been recognized as highly neurotropic and associated with a diverse range of neurological diseases, such as aseptic meningitis, BE, encephalomyelitis, acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), and postinfectious neurological syndromes. During the 1998 Taiwan epidemic several clinical stage categories of disease were developed for the severity of BE to help monitor the clinical course of EV71 infection and to aid management. These systems are not, however, widely used, possibly because they are not always easy to follow by primary care physicians. In 2010, World Health Organization Regional Office (WHO) for the Western Pacific and the Regional Emerging Diseases Intervention (REDI) Centre documented guide for clinical management on hand, foot, and mouth disease that has proposed simple clinical stages of disease manifestation to describe the disease severity as we suggested previously [15, 16]. The EV71 BE was stratified into three important critical stages by disease severity, including uncomplicated BE, autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysregulation, and pulmonary edema (PE). It is a continuous and dynamic disease sequence. It may be a reversible disease because each critical stage is a turning point. Through this staging, the pathogenesis of BE was explored and then effective ways to manage the patients were developed. BE is defined as an illness characterized by myoclonus, ataxia, nystagmus, oculomotor palsies, and bulbar palsy in various combinations, with or without neuroimaging. ANS dysregulation is defined by the presence of cold sweating, mottled skin, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypertension. PE is defined as respiratory distress with tachycardia, tachypnea, rales, and frothy sputum that developed after ANS dysregulation, together with a chest radiograph that showed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates without cardiomegaly. If the diagnosis of EV71 BE once was delayed, usually because of the clinical symptoms are not recognized in the early stages. Myoclonic jerks are seen more often in EV71 than in other serotypes of enteroviruses and could be an early indicator of brain stem involvement. Diagnostic workup of EV71 BE should include the search for one or more neurological symptoms, especially myoclonus jerk and limb paralysis, and the measurement of disease markers, such as peripheral white blood cell count, platelet count, glucose level, inflammatory cytokines, immune cell subsets, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis [17\u201322]. In the 2008 outbreak of Taiwan, 238 virologically and clinically confirmed severe cases were identified, including 41% uncomplicated BE, 44% ANS dysregulation, and 15% PE [23].",

            "text": "Both innate and adaptive immune mechanisms are important for host defense against viral infection. The innate immune system provides the first line of defense against virus through activation of adaptive immunity through antigen presentation as well as secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. The pathogenesis of PE and hemorrhage in EV71 infections has been studied, with some important findings. Destruction of vasomotor and respiratory centers in the medial, ventral, and caudal medulla by EV71 leads to ANS dysregulation and PE. It is similar to that observed in bulbar poliomyelitis and produces sympathetic hyperactivity, with surge catecholamine and autonomic dysfunction [19, 24]. Catecholamines are among the neurotransmitters that affect immune responses humorally through circulating epinephrine, as well as locally through neuronal release of norepinephrine [25]. Local release of neuroendocrine mediators coupled with specific receptor expression in immune cells establishes a functional neuroimmune connection capable of modulating various responses, including cytokine production. PE might be the result of increased pulmonary vascular permeability caused by the brain stem lesions and/or a systemic inflammatory response syndrome produced by the release of cytokines and chemokines. The clinical presentation of EV71 PE is caused by a hyperinflammatory syndrome resulting from hypercytokinemia and central nervous system inflammation of various inflammatory mediators. Some studies have shown that proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2) are associated with BE that is complicated by PE [17, 20]. A significant elevation of plasma IL-10, IL-13, and interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 levels is observed in patients with PE [19].",

However, Khong and coworkers reported that administration of anti-IL-6 neutralizing antibodies, at day 3 or 6 postinfection, after the onset of the clinical symptoms successfully improved the survival rates and clinical scores of the EV71-infected mice [31]. Compared to untreated infected controls, anti-IL-6-treated mice displayed reduced tissue damage, absence of splenic atrophy, and increased CD4+, CD8+ T cells, and B cells activation. Further, the anti-IL-6 antibody-mediated protection is independent of the virus load. However, anti-IL-6 treatment at the time of infection is detrimental to the mice. It means that IL-6 production is beneficial to the host early postinfection to trigger the antiviral host response through attraction of various immune cells; however, sustained high levels of IL-6 may cause tissue damage and immunopathology.",

A close relationship exists between catecholamine and IL-10 release [33]. IL-10 can be modulated in several acute and chronic neuropathological conditions. This suggests that IL-10 plays a role in the immune-regulatory functions of the CNS. Thus, the systemic IL-10 increase in patients with PE appears to be triggered by persistent sympathetic activation as a consequence of direct brain stem destruction by the virus. IL-10 inhibits production of several proinflammatory mediators, including IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, granulocyte colony stimulating factor, and TNF-\u03b1, and upregulates the expression of the naturally occurring IL-1 receptor antagonist [32]. In an animal study of EV71 infection, anti-IL-6 treatment resulted in dramatically increased IL-10/IL-6 ratios, reflecting the upregulation of IL-10 production in the treated animals. Therefore, upregulation of IL-10 likely helped balance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines and subsequent tissue damage [31].",

It is essential for both innate and adaptive immunity [34]. Elevated serum levels of IFN-\u03b3 in patients with uncomplicated BE and PE were found. Moreover, the kinetic analysis in patients with PE showed that the production of IFN-\u03b3 occurred 24 h after IL-10 production. Increased pulmonary vascular permeability may play a pivotal role in PE. IFN-\u03b3 can exhibit enhanced vascular permeability [35]. IFN-\u03b3-mediated microvascular leakage occurs as a result of the reduced endothelial barrier and tight junction [36]. IL-10 is a cytokine synthesis inhibitor that will terminate the production of IFN-\u03b3. IFN-\u03b3 production appeared later than that of IL-10 in PE patients, which suggests that IFN-\u03b3 might play an important role in the development of PE. Recently, IFN-\u03b3 was found to be significantly elevated in infected AG129 mice, which lack type I and II interferon receptors, that are susceptible to infection with a non-mouse-adapted EV71 strain via both the intraperitoneal and oral routes. The defect in IFN signaling may lead to some compensatory changes in the pattern of immune responses, which implies this model may not accurately reflect the immunopathogenesis seen in immunocompetent patients [37].",

Plasma level of IL-4 was not changed in EV71-infected patients, but IL-13 levels were consistently elevated in all groups, uncomplicated BE, ANS dysregulation, and PE. Because IL-13 can act alone in the pulmonary model [42], overproduction of IL-13 might contribute to the pathogenesis of PE by increasing pulmonary vascular permeability. Further, exogenous treatment of IL-6, IL-13, and IFN-\u03b3 at day 3 postintracranial infection could induce mild PE and exacerbate pulmonary abnormality of EV71-infected mice. A synergistic proinflammatory cytokine response and damage to specific brain regions may be necessary for the development of EV71-induced PE [43].

Elevated IL-1\u03b2 levels were found only in the CSF and not in the plasma of EV71-infected patients with PE [21]. Hosoi et al. [53] found increased levels of IL-1\u03b2 mRNA in the brain in the absence of an increase in circulating IL-1\u03b2 in rats. These findings support the notion that IL-1\u03b2 is probably synthesized in the CNS in response to severe EV71 infection. IL-1 can also regulate neurotransmission mediated by amines such as norepinephrine and dopamine. The activity of the locus coeruleus, which is the most important source of norepinephrine inside the brain, was increased after in vivo IL-1\u03b2 microinjection in this area; this effect was blocked by IL-1\u03b2 receptor antagonist [54]. This may provide explanation of elevated IL-1\u03b2 level in CSF of PE patients, following the stage of ANS dysregulation.",

Increased IP-10 concentration in CSF in patients with enteroviral meningitis was observed [55]. CSF levels of IP-10 and IL-8 in patients with EV71 BE were significantly higher than the plasma levels in the control subjects [22]. IP-10 is prominently expressed within the CNS of mice after infection with viral encephalitis [56]. Early expression of IP-10 within the CNS after virus infection is important in initiating and maintaining a protective Th1 immune response. This is characterized by high-level production of the antiviral cytokine IFN-\u03b3 [56, 57]. Early expression of IP-10 appears to be beneficial by attracting Th1 T lymphocytes into the CNS, which participate in viral clearance. Further study is needed to determine how IP-10 neutralizing agents or CXCR3 receptor antagonists might be applied to treating human disease.",

There is considerable evidence linking cytokine-mediated severe systemic inflammatory responses to PE and the other adverse outcomes in patients with EV71-associated BE [17, 19, 21]. Modulating cytokine expression by IVIG may offer a strategy for clinical practice. A previous study demonstrated a decrease in the plasma concentration of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-13, and IFN-\u03b3 following administration of IVIG in patient with ANS dysregulation and PE [29].
