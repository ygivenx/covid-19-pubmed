Our corresponding estimate in symptomatic cases\nwas 13\u00b75 days. In a subset of the children whose start of symptoms could be established from\nthe clinic records, the Okiro et al. study reported a longer duration of\n7\u00b77 days [12]. Given that RSV shedding has been\nreported to start before illness [6], the actual\nduration in the symptomatic children would have been an underestimate and our estimate of\n13\u00b75 days is likely to be more accurate. A Rochester family study, in the USA, with similar\ndesign as the present study (collecting samples every 3\u20134 days regardless of symptoms)\nreported lower estimates of duration of shedding of 3\u00b74\u20137\u00b74 days [10]. The Okiro et al. and Rochester study used the\nimmunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT) and culture, respectively, which are less sensitive\nmethods [14]. As a counter argument, it is not\nknown to what degree PCR positivity equates with shedding of viable and infectious virus.\nThus, while the molecular methods might be more sensitive, the resultant increase in\nduration of shedding over more traditional methods such as culture (which directly measures\nviral infectivity) may not necessarily translate to increased period of infectivity. Further\nwork relating virus infectiousness and detectability is warranted. In the Okiro et\nal. study, sampling started when participants were symptomatic and stopped at the\nfirst negative follow-up sample. The present study revealed instances where negative samples\narose within RSV infection episodes. Even though this observation raises, again, questions\non the relationship between infectivity and shedding duration, accounting for periods of\nRSV-negative samples would still result to longer shedding duration compared to previous\nestimates. Alternative estimation of the shedding patterns by calculating the area under the\nCt (viral load) curve would have some additional advantages and will be\nexplored in future.",
