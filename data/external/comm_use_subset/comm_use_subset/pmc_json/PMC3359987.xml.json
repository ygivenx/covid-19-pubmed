            "text": "West Nile virus (WNV) is a blood-borne pathogen that can cause serious systemic and neurological disease in human and animals. In order for this to occur, the virus must cross multiple polarized cell layers after mosquito borne transmission. Resistance to movement of macromolecules and pathogens across epithelia and endothelia is mediated in large part by tight junctions. The latter are apically located protein complexes which are composed of integral membrane proteins including claudins, occludins and junctional adhesion molecules (JAM) that form intracellular interactions with cytoplasmic components such as ZO-1, ZO-2, ZO-3 and the actin cytoskeleton (reviewed in [1]). Homotypic interactions between claudins, occludins and JAMs on apposing cells constitute the main barrier to intercellular passage of macromolecules. Tight junctions are highly dynamic and paracellular permeability can be affected by a variety of physiological and pathological conditions. With respect to the latter, it is thought that the pathogenicity of notable human viruses such as severe acute respiratory coronavirus, influenza and ebola viruses is related to their abilities to negatively impact the barrier function of tight junctions [2], [3], [4]. Interestingly, each of these viruses interferes with tight junctions through different mechanisms.",

For example, one group reported that expression of capsid protein inhibits the barrier function of tight junctions by inducing degradation of claudin proteins in lysosomes [5]. In contrast, Verma et al report that infection of endothelial cells by WNV per se does not reduce levels of tight junction components, but rather, matrix metalloproteases that are secreted from infected astrocytes cause breakdown of these structures [6], [7]. Moreover, they indicate that WNV infection actually results in a small but significant increase in claudin-1 levels. Finally, data from another laboratory which conducted pathogenesis studies in mice, support a role for matrix metalloproteinase 9 in WNV-induced disruption of the blood brain barrier through degradation of basement membranes [8]. However, the effects of viral infection on tight junction components were not investigated in this study.",

            "text": "Lysosomal degradation [5] and matrix metalloproteases [6], [7] have been implicated in WNV-induced turnover of tight junction proteins. However, because a large pool of the WNV capsid protein is targeted to the nuclei of infected cells [9], [10], transcription of claudin-1 and JAM-1 genes could also be affected by WNV replication. Therefore, we used RT-PCR to assess the relative levels of tight junction-specific mRNAs in WNV-infected cells. Data in Figure 2 indicate that WNV infection does not decrease the levels of claudin-1- or JAM-1-specific or other mRNAs that encode tight junction proteins such as claudin-3, claudin-4, ZO-1 and occludin. Instead, levels of tight junction-specific mRNAs were significantly increased as a result of WNV infection. For example, at 24 h post-infection, claudin-1 mRNA levels were >1.8 fold higher than in mock-treated cells and at 72 h post-infection, they were 3.9 times higher (p = 0.039). Claudin-3 and claudin-4 mRNA levels steadily increased during WNV infection and between 48 and 72 h, were as much as 2.2 (p = 0.005) and 4.6 (p = 0.043) fold higher respectively than mock samples. Levels of JAM-1 and ZO-1 mRNAs also increased significantly with peak expression levels observed at 48 h post-infection. Accordingly, we conclude that WNV-induced loss of specific tight junction membrane proteins results exclusively from protein degradation. Moreover, it is likely that this process occurs in all polarized cells regardless of whether they of epithelial or endothelial origin.",

There are a number of ways in which integral membrane proteins of the plasma membrane can be targeted for degradation, the most common of which involves clathrin- or caveolae-dependent endocytosis followed by lysosomal degradation. Moreover, because it has been reported that in response to various physiological and pathological stimuli, tight junction barrier function can be modulated by selective endocytosis of components such as claudins [11], [12], [13], we elected to investigate this pathway first. Internalization of plasma membrane proteins via clathrin-coated vesicles or caveolae requires the action of the GTPase dynamin [14]. As such, if WNV-induced degradation of tight junction membrane proteins involves their removal from the cell surface by canonical endocytic pathways, blocking dynamin function should inhibit the turnover of claudin-1 and JAM-1 in infected cells. Indeed, treatment of cells with the dynamin-specific inhibitor Dynasore [15] completely protected these proteins from degradation during viral infection (Figure 3).",

However, we cannot rule out the possibility that viral infection causes misrouting of nascent claudin-1 and/or JAM-1 to lysosomes. For example, the nef protein of human immunodeficiency virus downregulates cell surface expression of MHC 1 complexes by stimulating their endocytosis as well as diversion of nascent MHC 1 complexes from the trans-Golgi network to the lysomes [18]. Similar to endocytosis, trafficking of proteins along this route is sensitive to nocodazole [19] and also requires dynamin for vesicle scission from the trans-Golgi network [20]. Therefore, to differentiate whether WNV infection induces endocytosis of tight junction membrane proteins from the plasma membrane or re-routing of nascent claudin-1 and JAM-1 from the trans-Golgi network to the lysosomes, we monitored the localization of these proteins in WNV infected cells that had been treated with Dynasore or nocodazole. If WNV infection causes re-routing of nascent claudin-1 from the trans-Golgi network to lysosomes using a mechanism that requires dynamin activity and microtubule-dependent transport, then treatment of infected cells with Dynasore or nocodazole should result in their accumulation in the trans-Golgi network and/or associated vesicles in the juxtanuclear region. Based on the data shown in Figures 4 and 5, this does not appear to be the case. When infected cells were treated with these inhibitors, there was no significant build up of claudin-1 or JAM-1 in the juxtanuclear region but rather, we observed that the plasma membrane localization of these proteins was preserved. Therefore, we conclude that the primary mechanism by which WNV induces turnover of tight junction membrane proteins is through dynamin-dependent endocytosis followed by microtubule-dependent transport to lysosomes.",

Infection by DENV can result in vascular leakage by affecting tight junction permeability through a process involving cytokines [21]. For example, macrophage migration inhibitory factor, which is secreted by virus-infected cells, can directly affect tight junction permeability by activating MAP kinase pathways or indirectly by inducing monocytes to secrete tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) and other cytokines that influence the barrier function of endothelial cells. DENV has also been shown to cause neuroinvasive disease which requires the virus to breach the blood brain barrier (reviewed in [22]). In contrast to WNV, DENV infection did not significantly alter the localization tight junction membrane proteins such as claudin-1 (Figure 6A) or JAM-1 (data not shown). A discernable reduction in claudin-1 protein levels (Figure 6B) was observed but this decrease was very small compared to the loss of claudin-1 in WNV-infected cells. Similarly, JAM-1 and occludin protein levels were not significantly affected by DENV infection.",

As the first step in this process, it was necessary to confirm that expression of capsid protein in the absence of other WNV proteins results in degradation of claudin-1. For these experiments, we used lentiviral pseudoparticles to transduce CACO-2 and MDCK cells with a cassette encoding the mature form of WNV capsid protein. In contrast to Medigeshi et al [5], we did not observe significant degradation of claudin-1 or JAM-1 in capsid-expressing cells (Figure 7A, B), nor was there any appreciable loss of tight junction membrane proteins from the cell surface (Figure 8). We also examined if capsid interacts with claudin-1 and/or JAM-1 in WNV-infected cells. Data from reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that capsid does not form a stable complex with either of these proteins (Figure 7C). Moreover, consistent with what was observed in WNV-infected cells, significant colocalization between capsid and claudin-1 or JAM-1 in the transduced cells was not evident (Figure 8).",

With respect to the latter, it is evident that the pathogenic effects of many viruses are due to loss of tight junction barrier function. Indeed, disruption of these structures is associated viral spread, circulation shock and infiltration of immune cells into compartments such as alveolar space and the central nervous system. Interestingly, there are a wide variety of mechanisms by which viruses can negatively impact tight junctions. For example, the E protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus interferes with lung epithelial tight junction assembly by binding to the PDZ domain of PALS1 [2]. Similarly, NS1 proteins from highly virulent strains of avian influenza virus bind and sequester PDZ domain-containing proteins such Scribble and Dlg1, MAGI-1, MAGI-2 and MAGI-3 resulting in their mislocalization from tight junctions [3]. As well as allowing influenza viruses to cross the epithelium, loss of tight junction barrier function is a major underlying factor in pulmonary edema. The examples cited above involve scenarios in which virus replication and expression of viral proteins are required for interfering with tight junctions. In contrast, the lethal circulation shock caused by Ebola virus may occur in the absence of virus replication or interaction of virus proteins with host cells. Disruption of tight junctions in this case may be due to binding of virus particles to endothelial cells which in turn activates them resulting in loss of barrier function [4].",

There are numerous reports indicating that WNV infection compromises the integrity of the blood brain barrier [6], [7], [8], [23] and collectively, these data suggest that both viral and host factors are involved. With respect to the latter, WNV infection induces expression of matrix metalloproteinases such as MMP9, a host factor that is necessary for viral infection of the central nervous system [8]. One theory is that MMP9 compromises the blood brain barrier by degrading the extracellular matrix. This scenario does not rule out virus-mediated effects on tight junctions nor transcytosis as being important for crossing this barrier because once the virus breaches the endothelium, it must still traverse the extracellular matrix before it can access the central nervous system. Immunomodulatory cytokines are also thought to play a role in WNV neuroinvasion. For example, WNV infection of immune cells results in secretion of TNF\u03b1 which dampens viral replication in peripheral tissues [24]. However, this anti-viral cytokine also induces endocytosis of the tight junction membrane protein occludin [25] which may inadvertently facilitate transmission of the virus across the blood brain barrier. Similarly, cytokines released from DENV-infected cells can directly or indirectly influence the permeability of endothelial tight junction complexes [21], [22].",

Moreover, we observed that infection of endothelial cells (HUVECs) results in loss of claudin-1 and JAM-1 proteins.

Whereas Medigeshi et al used stably transfected cells expressing capsid protein for their experiments, we used lentiviral transduction to induce robust transient expression of capsid in cells which arguably, more closely parallels the expression kinetics of capsid protein in WNV-infected cells.

Because capsid protein does not appear to be physically involved in this process, we hypothesize that WNV replication and/or assembly triggers a signalling event that leads to endocytosis of a subset of tight junction membrane proteins. Endocytosis of these proteins is in fact a normal process that is used to regulate the permeability of tight junctions in response to physiological stimuli [1]. For example, inflammatory cytokines such as TNF\u03b1 induce caveolae-dependent endocytosis of occludin [25]. Even though cytokine expression and secretion is a common cellular response to virus infection, it is unlikely that this is the primary mechanism by which WNV induces lysosomal degradation of selected tight junction membrane proteins in epithelial cells at least. First, we are unaware of any data showing that WNV infection of MDCK and CACO-2 cells results in production of proinflammatory cytokines. Moreover, infection of these cells with other RNA viruses does not significantly affect production of cytokines such as TNF\u03b1 and interleukins [26], [27]. Second, while treatment of CACO-2 cells with TNF\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 can lead to tight junction failure through degradation of occludin and possibly other mechanisms [28], exposure to IL-1\u03b2 actually increases levels of claudin-1 [29].

These include; stimulating endocytosis and degradation of key transmembrane proteins of the tight junction; inducing production of matrix metalloproteases that degrade basement membranes; stimulating immune cells and possibly endothelial cells to secrete proinflammatory cytokines that disrupt tight junctions. A clearer understanding how WNV causes these events may lead to therapeutic treatments that block viral spread or design of attenuated vaccine strains.",
