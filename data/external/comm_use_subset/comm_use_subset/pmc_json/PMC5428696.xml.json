CRF is a syndrome characterized by progressive and irreversible deterioration of renal function2. In humans, CRF is mainly caused by hypertension, glomerulonephritis, and diabetes mellitus3, 4. This condition is made worse by a deterioration in nutrition level caused by accumulation of uremic toxins and reduced food intake, which could be attributed to many factors, such as gastrointestinal congestion, loss of appetite, and reduced glomerular filtration rate4\u20136. Compared to patients with other chronic diseases, patients with CRF tend to require longer and more frequent hospitalizations which are associated with higher morbidity and mortality7. Therefore, it is urgent to develop alternative medicines and novel therapies for the treatment of CRF.",

These enzymes have been identified in the kidney and are responsible for endogenous renal H2S production10\u201312. An increasing number of studies indicate that H2S plays an important role in renal physiology and pathology11, 13, 14. The physiological level of H2S leads to vasodilation and increases glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow, which causes an indirect increase of the urinary excretion of K+ and Na+ \n13. Under pathological conditions, H2S exerts the protective role in a number of experimental models of renal disease, including obstructive nephropathy11, renal ischemia-reperfusion injury15, and diabetic nephropathy16. Recent studies demonstrated that H2S is significantly lower in plasma and tissues of uremic patients and 5/6 nephrectomy rats17\u201319. Considering the beneficial effects of H2S in renal physiology and pathology, we hypothesize that the application of exogenous H2S may effectively protect against CRF.",

In this study, we investigated the effects of H2S on the nephrotoxicity induced by GEN in NRK-52E cells. The adenine-induced CRF model in rats is a standard method for inducing metabolic abnormalities closely resembling those observed in uremic patients23, 24. Therefore, a rat model of adenine-induced CRF was used in the present study. We also investigated the effects and mechanisms of H2S on adenine-induced CRF in rats.",

In addition, this method produces more pronounced reductions in glomerular filtration rate compared with the model of 5/6 nephrectomy41. Thus, adenine-induced CRF in rats was adopted as a disease model for the evaluation of the effect of H2S on CRF. The results showed that the rats fed on the adenine diet for 4 weeks showed increased water intake, urine production, urinary protein, and relative kidney weight, which were similar to the signs and symptoms in rats with adenine-induced CRF41, 42. In addition, a previous study has reported a reduction in body weight in adenine-fed rats which could be attributed to the reduced food consumption43. Our results were in good accordance with the findings. Administration of H2S effectively ameliorated all the above adenine-induced changes.",

Our results indicated that the levels of ROS and MDA were markedly increased, and the activities of anti-oxidative enzymes, SOD and GSH-Px, were significantly decreased compared with the control group, suggesting that ROS could induce apoptosis in the kidney of CRF rats. All these changes were reversed by administration of H2S. Recent studies have proven that ROS can activate MAPKs and apoptotic cell death induced by ROS is mediated by MAPK pathway52\u201354. The present study identified that CRF increased the phosphorylation of p38, JNK, and ERK, whereas H2S treatment significantly reversed the CRF-induced increase in MAPKs phosphorylation. These results demonstrated that H2S was able to reduce the apoptotic levels induced by CRF through ROS-mediated MAPK pathway.",

            "text": "Inflammatory cytokines play important roles in the development and progression of CRF55, 56. It is well documented that the levels of several inflammatory cytokines were higher in CRF patients compared with control subjects, such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-10, and MCP-155\u201357. Similarly, our data indicated that the levels of these cytokines were significantly increased compared with the control group. High levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and MCP-1 indicated activation and increased production of cytokines, which can lead to an inflammatory state in the kidney of CRF rats. High levels of IL-10 in the kidney could be suggestive of an aberration in the pro anti-inflammatory adjustment. Administration of H2S effectively alleviated renal inflammation in CRF rats. The NF-\u03baB network is involved in a wide range of inflammatory, autoimmune, and malignant disorders37, 58, 59. The p50/p65 heterodimer is considered the most important transcription factor of the NF-\u03baB pathway and is specifically referred to as NF-\u03baB59, 60. A recent study indicated that the expression of NF-\u03baB was upregulated in the kidney of CRF rats61. Our results showed that CRF increased kidney p50, p65, and p-p65 protein expressions as well as the p-p65/p65 ratio, suggesting that CRF induced an inflammatory state in the kidney of rats. However, treatment with H2S significantly reversed the changes induced by CRF, suggesting that H2S could reduce kidney inflammation through the downregulation of NF-\u03baB expression.",
