In the primary care setting, infectious diseases pose a particular challenge. Specifically, patients with emerging, re-emerging, or highly infectious diseases may develop nonspecific symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, rash) subacutely. Thus, these patients may be more likely to present to a primary care clinic compared with patients affected by a relatively acute emergency (e.g., natural disasters, fires, radiation, or chemical attacks), who are more likely to present to a hospital emergency room [1, 2]. Hence, primary care clinics are especially important for screening and isolating patients with potentially infectious disease in order to prevent transmission to other patients, health care workers, and the community.",

These studies enabled assessment of current emergency preparedness protocols, evaluation of the effectiveness of specific procedures within protocols (e.g., use of electronic health record workflows to guide screening), and identification of strengths and areas for improvement. Activities that assess and improve emergency preparedness for infectious diseases in the primary care setting have been relatively underreported, with most published studies either highlighting this as an area of need [11\u201314] or showing the willingness of primary care practitioners to help in emergency preparedness and response [11, 15].",

Time to screening was measured from the moment the patient\u2013actor entered the clinic to the time she or he was given a mask or referred by clinic staff to the medical team because of concern of infection. Time to isolation was measured from when patient was screened to when she or he was placed in a separate and closed room. As a baseline, both time to screening and time to isolation were considered appropriate if performed in under 10 min. The processes of screening and isolation were also graded qualitatively using adapted HSEEP criteria: performed without challenges (P), performed with some challenges (S), performed with major challenges (M), and unable to perform (U). The PCEPN controller concluded the drill when the health care provider began his or her medical evaluation (e.g., taking vital signs, asking the patient\u2019s permission to examine the reported rash). If the patient waited for 15 min without being seen, a trusted agent would inform triage staff to call the \u201cpatient,\u201d without disclosing the drill, and proceed with screening to determine if isolation was needed, and, if needed, offer the patient a surgical mask and call a clinical staff member to receive the patient and place him or her in a designated isolation room or space for medical evaluation.",

In that study, no clinic gave the patient\u2013actor a surgical mask before or after triage, only 2 (25%) performed chest X-rays, and none reported the suspected case to the local public health department.

After the patient\u2013actor was screened, median time to isolation was only 1 min, with no drill taking longer than 5 min to isolate the patient\u2013actor. However, in terms of quality, 42% of drills had at least some challenges with isolation. Thus, while most clinics screened and isolated efficiently and effectively, there remains substantial room for improvement. In rounds 2 and 3, median time to screening was 2 min compared with 5 min in the first round, though this reduction was not statistically significant. Similarly, there was no statistically significant difference in terms of quality of screening; 65% of drills screened the patient\u2013actor without any challenges in round 1, compared with 75% in round 3. Interestingly, median time to isolation increased in later rounds of the drill, from under 1 min in round 1 to 2 min in round 3 (ptrend = 0.022). However, there was no statistically significant trend in terms of quality of isolation; 50% of drills isolated the patient\u2013actor without any challenges in round 1, compared to 69% in round 3. There are multiple explanations for these findings. This study was likely underpowered to detect smaller but still clinically significant differences. While the increase in time to isolation may be due to random error, it may also be due to a clinically significant (but statistically nonsignificant) improvement in quality of isolation. Supporting evidence for the latter explanation is that clinics identified several areas for improvement regarding isolation (e.g., explaining to the patient the rationale for isolation, performing hand hygiene, using signage to indicate occupied rooms), which clinics may have incorporated in later rounds, thereby lengthening the time to isolation.",

We also found that actors simulating ILI were much more likely to be masked than those simulating measles (93% vs. 59%, p = 0.007), a finding that persisted when restricting the analysis to only patients who were masked at the first point of contact (77% vs. 41%, p = 0.026).

Nevertheless, these findings highlight the importance of ensuring masking indications also include potentially infectious patients without respiratory symptoms. For measles, this is especially important since it is highly contagious and has recently re-emerged in the face of declining immunization coverage [20]. Newly emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (a recent notable example includes Ebola virus disease [21]) may also present without respiratory symptoms.",

We evaluated screening and isolation of actors simulating patients with ILI or measles in 50 drills at 41 clinics in New York City. In almost every drill, the patient was screened and isolated, although 1 of 3 drills had at least some challenges with either process. Patients simulating ILI were more likely to be masked than those simulating measles, which may reflect a causal association. Approximately 95% of participants reported the drill was realistic and prepared them to deal with the hazards addressed. Qualitative analysis revealed several recurring themes for strengths and areas for improvement.
