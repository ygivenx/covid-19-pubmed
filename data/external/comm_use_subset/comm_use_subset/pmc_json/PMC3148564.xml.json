            "text": "Synonymous codon usage is biased and the bias seems to be different in different organisms[1,2]. Many factors are concerned to be the reasons for this bias, such as degree and timing of gene expression, codon-anticodon interactions, transcription and translation rate and fidelity, codon context, and global and local (C+G) content[3,4]. Understanding the extent and causes of biases in codon usage is essential to the understanding of viral evolution, particularly the interplay between viruses and the immune response [5]. More recent studies have revealed that patterns of codon usage bias and nucleotide composition within many cellular genomes are far more complex than previously imagined, and the factors shaping their evolution are still not entirely understood. In general, natural selection and/or mutation pressure for accurate and efficient translation in various organisms are the main reasons to this bias. In addition, compared with natural selection, mutation pressure plays an important role in synonymous codon usage pattern in some RNA viruses [6-10].",

The Cardiovirus genus of the family Picornaviridae consists two distinct species: Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and Theilovirus ThV [11]. The EMCVs comprise a single serotype and have a wide host range [11-21], while the ThV species, probably includes four serotypes: Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), Vilyuisk human encephalomyelitis virus (VHEV), Thera virus (TRV; isolated from rats) and Saffold virus (SAFV; isolated from humans) 1-8., which appear to have much narrower host ranges than EMCV. Like the other virus within Picornaviruses family, the strains in Cardiovirus also consist a open-read-frame (ORF), 5'-untranslate region (5'-UTR) and 3'-untranslate region (3'-UTR). However there are still many complete nucleotide sequences of this type are not reported especially, such as SAFV, therefore there is much more work to study this type virus.",

As shown in Table 1, the EMCV strains seem to like using U, G and C ending codon, while the ThV species seem to like using U and A ending codons. The values of ENC (effective number of codons) (Table 2) among EMCV strains examined are very similar, which vary from 54.40 to 56.11 with a mean value of 54.86 and S.D. of 0.36, while the values of ENC among Theilovirus are a little different, which vary from 48.24 to 54.94 with a mean value of 51.08 and S.D. of 2.17. Because all the ENC values of both EMCV strains and Theilovirus strains are high (ENC > 40), codon usage bias in Cardioviru genome is a little slight. However, there is a marked variation in codon usage pattern among different Theilovirus genes (S.D. = 6.41) compared to the EMCV genes (S.D. = 0.36). The concept is further supported by the values of CG3. The (C+G)3% values of EMCV strains range from 46.47 to 52.11% with a mean of 48.90 and S.D. of 2.18 while these values of ThV strains range from 37.35 to 51.00, with a mean of 43.72 and S.D. of 5.77.",

(C+G)3% has a highly significant correlation with each of A%, U%, C% and G% among the ThV strains but not among the EMCV strains. This indicates that the (C+G)% and (C+G)3% may reflect some more important characteristics of codon usage pattern of ThV compared with EMCV. Then the C+G content at first and second codon positions ((C+G)12%) was compared with that at synonymous third codon positions ((C+G)3%) for both EMCV and ThV respectively. A highly significant correlation is observed in ThV (r = 0.986, P < 0.01)(Figure 1A, Table 4). However for EMCV a highly negative correlation is observed (r = -0.736, P < .0.01)(Figure 1B, Table 4). Then the (C+G)12% and (C+G)3% of both EMCV and ThV were compared with axis f'1 and axis f'2 respectively. The results (Table 4) show that for EMCV there are no significant correlations between (C+G)3%, (C+G)12%, axis f'1 and axis f'2 are observed, while the results of ThV are opposite. The ENC-plot [ENC plotted against (G+C)3%] was used as a part of general strategy to investigate patterns of synonymous codon usage and all of the spots lie below the expected curve (Figure 2). All these results imply that the codon bias of Cardiovirus especially the ThV can be explained mainly by an uneven base composition, in other words, by mutation pressure rather than natural selection and the (C+G) content has a more significant effect for ThV than EMCV",

The coordinate of the complete coding region of each gene was plotted in Figure 3 defining by the first and second principal axes. It is clear that the f'1 values of all EMCV are positive while the ThVs are negative. And the plots of the strains of the same serotype seem at the same region. Furthermore, the EMCV has a tendency to converge tightly while the different serotypes of ThV are dispersed. These findings imply that different serotype may have different codon usage patterns. Interestingly, the plot of EMC-30 is a little far from the other EMCV, but this does not indicate the location is an element that could dramatically influence the codon usage pattern.",

In this study, we used RSCU, ENC, COA, and GC3S, to measure the synonymous codon usage bias in order to compare the differences between EMCV and ThV, the two species within Cardiovirus. The synonymous codon usage bias in coding regions of both EMCV and ThV are low because the mean ENC values of 54.86 and 51.08 respectively (higher than 40). This is in agreement with previous reports about some other RNA viruses, for example, BVDV (mean ENC = 51.42), H5N1 (mean ENC = 50.91) and SARS-covs (mean ENC = 48.99)[6,7,21]. A low codon usage bias is advantageous to replicate efficiently in vertebrate host cells, with potentially distinct codon preferences. However there is a marked variation in codon usage pattern among different Theilovirus genes (S.D. = 6.41) compared to the EMCV genes (S.D. = 0.36). One explanation about this phenomenon is that the ThV probably has four serotypes while the EMCV just has one and the serotype might affect the codon choice.",

            "text": "A general mutational pressure, which affects the whole genome, would certainly account for the majority of the codon usage variation. In this study, the general association between codon usage bias and base composition suggests that mutational pressure, rather than natural selection, is mainly supported by the highly significant correlation between (C+G)12% and (C+G)3% (r = -0.736 for EMCV; r = 0.986 for ThV, P < 0.01), since the effects are present at all codon positions. Also the (G+C) content was another factor which was found to be strong correlated with codon usage bias. In this study, the results indicated the (C+G) content played an important role in codon usage bias for ThV (Table 3), but not for EMCV. This is a little complex for EMCV and we need to do more research for this genus such as each nucleotide composition, gene structure and so on to find the main factor for codon bias of EMCV. Nevertheless we still consider that the mutational pressure rather than natural selection is the one of the main factors responsible for the variation of synonymous codon usage among ORF coding sequences in Cardiovirus genus.",

In this study we found that the EMCV strains seemed to like using U, G and C ending codon, while the ThV species seemed to like using U and A ending codon. Also there was a seemingly random variation in RSCU between amino acids and gene groups. This may be because using these codon with different endings could be advantage for replicating efficiently in host cells with potentially distinct codon preferences for both EMCV and ThV.",
