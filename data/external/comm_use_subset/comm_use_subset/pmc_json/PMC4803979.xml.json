When compared with other medical specialties, emergency medicine (EM) is well positioned to connect biomedical and public health approaches for preventing disease as well as injury and promoting health through population-based strategies targeted at the community (Clancy & Eisenberg, 1997).",

When all the systems are functioning, EM is available for all the patients 24 hours a day, seven days a week, irrespective of their ability to pay. EM offers care for both mental and physical health conditions and links patients with the most appropriate providers and care settings for presenting their conditions (Weissman, 1996).",

It is plausible that the high percentage of non-urgent ER visits in this study is due to ignorance, on the part of patients, of what constitutes an emergency case and lack of a hospital policy to discourage non-urgent visits. It is also possible that the hospital administration is afraid of being sued by patients for refusal to provide healthcare services, which may consequently tarnish the reputation of the hospital. Access to ER services was least for patients who consulted at King Fahd Hospital probably because the hospital has two triage rooms, one of which declines cold cases.",

Patients of the younger age group were more likely to seek ER care for non-urgent conditions probably due to parental worries and its influence. Further, it is possible that the number of single persons is high because of the high proportion of young patients aged less than 15 years. Although there is limited evidence, one report (Uscher-Pines et al., 2013) suggests that younger age affects patients\u2019 decisions to seek care in the ER for non-urgent conditions.

In practice, it takes about a month to get an appointment at a MOH hospital, and it is difficult for patients with low incomes to go to private clinics. These further drive patients to seek care for non-urgent problems. Other studies (Sarver, Cydulka, & Baker, 2002; Harris Interactive, 2006) have also reported the role of convenience factors in driving non-urgent ER use.

These may include prior visit to a doctor\u2019s clinic and the patient\u2019s experience of new-onset symptoms or a flare-up of a chronic condition that is not immediately debilitating, such as symptoms related to diabetes, asthma, or signs of stroke. The patient then has the choice of going to the ER or another location that can provide the same level of care or not seeking care. The results of this study showed that over half of the patients with non-urgent conditions decided to seek ER care. The most common reasons that drove patients to visit the ER care for non-urgent health problems were limited services, resources, and working hours as well as a lack of effective diagnosis at PHCCs. Although the organization of primary care services in Saudi Arabia has improved over the last decades, as confirmed by the reasonable number of staff in most PHCCs, studies point to several obstacles, including staff turnover (Al-Khaldi et al., 2002) and shortage of resources (Al-Khaldi & Al-Sharif, 2002). These obstacles discourage patients from using PHCCs. As an example, the lack of X-ray equipment or a technician at a PHCC would require that a physician transfers the patient to an ED, which would not only be time-consuming to the patient, but also more costly. Furthermore, PHCCs usually open during the day and only a few stay open till midnight, but never for 24 hours.",

Of the 63 patients with insurance, 57.1% had insurance by King Fahd Armed Forces Hospital, 28.6% had private insurance, and 14.3% had insurance by National Guard Hospital. Although other factors may have precluded patients with health insurance from consulting at other hospitals, reasons such as proximity and congestion at other governmental hospitals were most commonly cited by patients, and those who had private insurance reported insurance requirements have not yet been completed and some they would not pay the co-payment. Besides, the data suggest that ER staff do not discourage non-urgent ER visits, as shown by the high percentage of non-urgent cases that were received at the EDs of the hospitals. Findings from other studies suggest that cost sharing decreases use of appropriate and inappropriate health services (Newhouse, 1996), essential medications (Tambly, Laprise, & Hanley, 2001; Roblin, Platt, & Goodman, 2005), and preventive services (Redstone et al., 2008). These effects may occasionally cause worse health outcomes compared with health plans that involve lower out-of-pocket demands. Conversely, some studies (Blustein, 1995; Selby, Fireman, & Swain, 1996; Magid, Koepsell, & Every, 1997; Hsu, Price, & Brand, 2006) show that patients decrease elective services when ER care is subject to cost sharing, and this has not been associated with adverse outcomes. However, these observations may not apply to our context, especially when services are offered free of charge in hospitals such as King Fahd, King Abdul-Aziz, and Al-Thaghor hospitals. Moreover, in a developing country such as Saudi Arabia, there are still challenges in the health care insurance sector and many patients with lower incomes would rather seek care from the ER.",

A significantly high proportion of patients visited the ER three to four times a year and at least six times in one year for non-urgent cases. A significantly higher proportion of patients with non-urgent conditions had experienced symptoms of one to two days duration. A considerable proportion of patients without emergencies had not attempted to see a doctor at an outpatient clinic prior to visiting the ER. In general, most patients would deter from consulting a specialist doctor before seeking emergency care in most cases because of difficulties in getting an appointment at a specialized clinic. A significantly higher proportion of patients without emergencies thought the ER was the first place to consult when they felt symptoms. Compared with patients with non-urgent conditions, a significant proportion of patients with urgent conditions had chronic problems. Although most patients were knowledgeable about PHCCs and the alternatives to seek care, a significant proportion would seek emergency care for non-urgent problems mainly due to negative perceptions about PHCCs and for convenience. A significant proportion of patients who had insurance had non-urgent conditions. Proximity and congestion at other governmental hospitals were the main reasons that drove them to consult emergency services. A significantly proportion of patients with urgent conditions admitted to the ED clinic as they should be admitted to ED room. Non-urgent ER visits resulted in congestion and consequently long waiting times of up to 3 hours. Patients\u2019 educational levels were significantly associated with their knowledge of PHCCs, with those of lower education being more knowledgeable than those with a higher education.",

Re-structure health care delivery systems to provide greater access to primary care and provide more attention to psychosocial aspects of patient care in clinical settings. Develop primary care services in organizations that will assume responsibility for health status, access and coordination of services for individuals and communities in ways that extend beyond their contact with the healthcare system and the provision of walk-in services. Strengthen primary care and promote the integration of service levels requires changing the Canada Health Act, which in fact limits coverage of services to those supplied by hospitals and physicians. Offices with multiple family doctors have to be more accessible. In addition, family doctors\u2019 offices have to be close to the ER so that non-urgent cases can be easily referred to and addressed. Policy makers and healthcare providers should develop a health insurance policy that is commensurate with the expectation of the general population. Educate patients about emergency service use and improve their attitudes toward other health care choices. Introduce designated \u201cfast track\u201d units at Ministry of Health hospitals to entail the expeditious management of low acuity patients as well as the introduction of \u201cfast track\u201d improved waiting time for minor injuries without delaying the care of those with more serious injury. Limit boarding of patients in EDs by expanding hospital capacity. This will help in reducing the number of patients admitted at the ED and hence reduce overcrowding. Implement other strategies to address issues related to overcrowding in the various Ministry of Health hospitals, such as establish emergency centres for 24 hour across neighborhoods. Develop an information campaign to emphasize why and when attendance to the ER is inappropriate, and the negative impacts of this for the communication.",
