            "text": "Influenza poses a major challenge to world health authorities due to high transmissibility and capacity to generate major epidemics. From an epidemiological point of view, influenza epidemics and pandemics are associated with changes in the structure of society that favor the spread of new strains in specific ecological, social, and spatial contexts [1]. The 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus emerged from the combination of genetic segments from the human influenza virus, avian influenza virus, and swine influenza virus, and was first identified in April 2009 in Mexico and the United States [2]. The virus spread rapidly across the globe and on June 11, 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared influenza A (H1N1) as a pandemic [2]. In April 2009, preventive actions were initiated to delay entry of the virus to Brazil. In border regions, seaports and airports began to utilize sound alerts and distribute information for the purpose of early identification of symptomatic individuals. Despite these efforts, on July 16, 2009, the Ministry of Health officially announced sustained transmission of the H1N1 virus in the Brazilian territory [3]. The first cases of H1N1 influenza in Brazil were imported from countries that already had sustained transmission of the disease [4]. According to Ministry of Health data, up to the epidemiological week (EW) 47 (11/22/2009 to 11/28/2009), 30,055 cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) had been registered, with 93% identified as resulting from H1N1 infections. The H1N1 pandemic disproportionately affected the southern and southeast regions of Brazil, with Paran\u00e1 being the most affected state, accounting for 52% of the total cases reported in the country [5]. Despite low lethality rates, the rapid spread of the disease generated panic in Paran\u00e1. As in other parts of the country and the world, preventive measures were taken, such as the closure of schools, restaurants, and public places, in addition to social distancing and changes in hygiene habits [6]. Although the 2009 pandemic provided extensive knowledge and experience for public health professionals, the mechanism responsible for the spread of influenza is not yet fully understood [7]. The present study modeled the spatiotemporal evolution of the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) epidemic in Paran\u00e1, using efficient computational methods to identify climatic and sociodemographic factors associated with the chance of H1N1 introduction and, once introduced, the intensity of spread within the city. The model was further used to identify the most-likely starting points of H1N1 diffusion into the state of Paran\u00e1. These results will contribute to evaluation of timely control measures and decision making by public health authorities.",

The average temperature in the state is 18.5\u00b0C, and the climate is divided into two regimes: a tropical regime that predominates in the North, West, and Coastal areas with average temperatures of 22\u00b0C, and a subtropical or temperate regime in the mid-southern area with average temperatures between 10\u00b0C and 22\u00b0C. Tourism is one of the main sectors of the economy, and Paran\u00e1 has the 5th highest Human Development Index (HDI) in Brazil. The population of Paran\u00e1 is about four times less than in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, with 11 million inhabitants; approximately 2 million reside in Curitiba, the state capital and most populous municipality. Iguazu falls, at the border between Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay, is also an important touristic region attracting people around the world.",

Any medical doctor diagnosing a suspected case should notify to the National Notification System, SINAN [8]. Suspected cases were subsequentely confirmed or discarded based on the results of laboratory tests or by ascertaining an epidemiological link between the suspected case and a previously confirmed one. Laboratory testing was carried out in 27% of the suspected cases. In July 2009, there was a recommendation for restricting notification to patients with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) only. However, in Paran\u00e1, this recommendation was not followed, as the proportion of mild cases remained high throughout the epidemic [5].",

We then calculated the weekly average of each variable by municipality considering the number of pixels of the regular grid contained in each municipality.

One limitation of the ICAR model is that the variance \u03c32 represents both overdispersion and spatial dependence. In order to avoid this restriction, another specification will be used for the covariance structure of \u03c5, which is based on the generalized inverse of the covariance matrix D such that\n\u03c3\u03c52D-=(1-\u03b4)I+\u03b4R,(3)\nwhere I is the identity matrix, R is the intrinsic regression matrix specified in (2) and \u03b4 \u2208 [0, 1] is the parameter that quantifies spatial dependence.

Since then, other areas of dissemination appeared, increasing the risk of spread of the disease, especially to neighboring municipalities.

The upper triangular part of the matrix shows the scatter plots which produced the correlation coefficients for each of the candidate municipalities. As expected, regardless of origin the greater the effective distance of the candidate municipality, the longer the arrival time of the epidemic. It is also easily observable that the municipalities of Pinhais and Curitiba presented the highest correlations and, therefore, are strong candidates for the origin of the process of diffusion of influenza. It is noteworthy that the connectivity matrices and, consequently, the effective distances for both municipalities, are quite similar (correlation equal to 0.94). This is due to the fact that Pinhais has a very strong connection to Curitiba, the State Capital. The number of individuals frequently traveling to Curitiba is 20 times larger than to the second main destination, and concentrates almost 84% of the flow from Pinhais. Therefore, the paths from Pinhais to other municipalities are mostly governed by those from the Capital.",

Temperature may also directly or indirectly influence human behavior with regard to contact rate and aggregation patterns in ways that increase the risk of disease transmission [43]. Our results showed that maximum temperature in the week prior to case reports significantly affected the risk of influenza for several weeks. We found evidence early on that an increase in maximum temperature favored increased risk of influenza, possibly reflecting patterns of human aggregation. This counterintuitive result may be partially explained by the fact that with lower temperatures, people leave the home less, which may reduce the intensity of transmission. In Brisbane, Australia, Hu et al. [44] observed significant increases in the incidence of influenza A (H1N1) associated with decreases in maximum temperature with a one-week lag. Lopez et al. [45] also found a negative correlation between temperature and the prevalence of influenza A (H1N1) in a semi-arid region in India. In this study, a significant increase in the risk of influenza transmission was associated with a drop in temperature from weeks 21 to 28. From an ecological point of view, few authors have verified the impact of climatic factors on influenza in tropical regions, where temperatures and relative humidity are generally higher [46\u201348]. In addition, to our knowledge there are no studies that consider that the effect of temperature on the risk of influenza can vary over time, as proposed in this work.",

Collected during an emergency scenario and restricted to clinical cases, the data do not provide a full picture of the influenza transmission landscape. It is possible that detection differed between municipalities. On the positive side, previous analysis showed that Paran\u00e1 had the most sensitive surveillance system among the Brazilian states, with significantly higher reporting rate of mild cases [5]. Within the state the three metropolitan regions, Curitiba, Foz do Igua\u00e7u and Londrina-Maring\u00e1, presented similar mild-to-severe ratios, suggesting a certain level of homogeneity in the notification pattern. Finally, due to lack of available information the temporal data associated with some explanatory variables differs from that of the dependent variable. For example, the reported cases of influenza refer to 2009, while the covariates poverty rate, municipal HDI, and migration data were derived from the 2010 Census. It is, however, reasonable to assume that sociodemographic information did not undergo significant changes over the course of a single year.",
