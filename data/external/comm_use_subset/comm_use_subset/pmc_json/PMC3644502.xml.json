Two aspects emerging from surveillance and serological data during the initial phase of the outbreak became strikingly clear: (i) international movements of passengers by air travel drove the spatial dissemination of the pathogen at the global level [1-3], and (ii) initial local epidemics mainly occurred in schools [2,4-7]. Country surveillance data from summer 2009 [8-13] show a dramatic difference in the age distributions of imported cases and indigenous cases, with imported cases on average older than the ones generated by local transmission (see Figure 1A). This result strengthens the previous observations and highlights the presence of an age shift between the seeding events established by travelers from affected areas \u2013 mainly adults \u2013 and the local outbreaks mainly occurring among school-aged children. Travel statistics indeed confirm that the vast majority of passengers flying are aged \u226518 years (see Figure 1B).",

Here we aim at fully addressing the interplay between the two factors emerged as empirical evidence during the initial outbreak of H1N1 pandemic \u2013 namely, age-specific seeding events and age-specific epidemic dynamics \u2013 by considering a spatially explicit model that integrates the mobility patterns of flights connecting different populated areas, as well as age-dependent travel behavior in addition to age-specific mixing. We introduce a multi-host stochastic metapopulation model that includes heterogeneous features in: the spatial structure of the population; the travel behavior of individuals depending on their age; the corresponding mixing patterns. We assume a simple two age-groups classification as this allows the analytical treatment of the model to obtain the expression of the conditions for a major epidemic in terms of the age-specific contacts and travel features. By exploring theoretical contact matrices with varying assortativity levels (i.e. within-group mixing), we assess the role of assortativity on the risk of a major epidemic and compare it to scenarios informed with estimates from the H1N1 pandemic. We find that the assortativity observed in real data tends to drive the system to extinction, and is counterbalanced by the heterogeneity of the air mobility network structure, by the travel behavior of adults and by the relative proportion of contacts established by adults, all aspects that favor the virus spread. Through a systematic exploration of the role of the various ingredients considered in the system, the presented results allow the risk assessment analysis of a specific epidemic scenario and can be extended to other infectious diseases where the population partition may play a relevant role.",

In the case of air travel the coupling is given by the direct flights connecting different airports and the number of passengers flying on those connections. Analyses of air transportation data have shown the presence of large variability in the number of connections per airport, and of broad fluctuations in the traffic handled by each airport or flowing on a given connection between origin and destination [15,16]. In the Additional File we report the example of the European air transportation network [20], showing the probability distributions of the number of connections k per airport (i.e. the subpopulation\u2019s degree) and of the flows of passengers wij travelling between any pair of linked airports i and j. These flows can also be expressed in terms of the number of connections of the origin/destination airports, where the average weight wij along the link connecting airports i and j is a function of their degrees ki and kj, \u2329 wij\u232a \u221d (kikj)\u03b8, with \u03b8 \u2245 0.5 in the worldwide air-transportation network [15].

These are typically obtained from travel surveys at airports, and collect a variety of information about passengers and their travel behavior including demographic data. Figure 1B shows the percentage of travelers in the younger age class for a variety of sources and for different airports in various countries. If we consider a classification of the younger age group that includes individuals up to 18\u201321 years old (where the upper value of the range depends on the specific limits imposed by the age classification adopted by each survey), the fraction of children traveling by air is on average equal to 7%, with a maximum variation between 0.7% (observed for Teheran airport, Iran) and 9.2% (Luton airport, UK). Other statistical sources have larger age brackets, with no breakdown below 25 or 30 years old, as shown in the Figure. In these cases, we can still estimate the fraction of traveling individuals in the age class [0\u201318] years old, by rescaling the statistics assuming a constant ratio across countries between the percentages of travelers in the [0\u201318] years old and those of travelers in the [0\u201324] or [0\u201329] years old classes, as obtained from sources with a finer age classification.

A variety of different assumptions can be done to describe the social mixing pattern, as the variables of the contact matrix of the above expression are not uniquely defined and need to be parameterized through available demographic and serologic data [23]. Here we focus our attention on assortative mixing, indicating the tendency of individuals in a given class to preferably interact with other individuals of the same class. This is indeed observed in real data where contacts patterns are found to be highly assortative with age [22,24,25], with a remarkable similarity across different European countries [22]. By indicating with \u03b5c (\u03b5a) the average fraction of contacts that a child (adult) establishes with an adult (child), i.e. across age groups, we can simply express pc (pa) in terms of \u03b5c (\u03b5a) as pc = 1 - \u03b5c (pa= 1 - \u03b5a), thus the contact matrix can be rewritten as",

Here we introduce the age structure in order to consider different mixing patterns and travel probabilities depending on the age class, based on the results presented in the previous subsections. We consider a simple SIR compartmental model to describe the infection dynamics of the influenza epidemic, where individuals are assigned to mutually exclusive compartments \u2013 susceptible (S), infectious (I), and recovered (R) individuals [23]. Susceptible individuals may contract the infection from infectious individuals and enter the infectious compartment; all infectious individuals then recover permanently and enter the recovered compartment. The disease dynamics is encoded in the next generation matrix R = {Rij} i.e. the average number of secondary infections in age group j generated by a single primary case in age group i in a fully susceptible population, with i, j \u2208 {c, a}. We assume that the infectious period is exponentially distributed (with average value \u03bc\u2212 1) and that both transmission rate and recovery rate are independent of the age group, thus neglecting age-specific susceptibility or infectiousness, as in [14]. We consider a fully susceptible population, and also the case of an age-specific prior immunity, as detailed in the next subsection. If we assume that disease transmission may only occur along the contacts captured by the matrix C = {Cij} [24,31], we can express the generic entry of the next generation matrix as Ria=\u03b2\u03bcCia\u03b1 and Ric=\u03b2\u03bcCic1\u2212\u03b1[32,33] with i \u2208 {a, c} and Cij the contact matrix defined in Eq. (1). In the application of the contact matrix of Eq. (3) to the metapopulation model, we assume that all parameters used to define the partition of the population into age classes are independent of spatial features, being therefore constant across subpopulations (e.g. the children population fraction of a subpopulation with degree k is given by Nk,c = \u03b1Nk). Similarly, we assume that the age-specific travel behavior does not change with the subpopulation of the system. The travel behavior is thus modeled by rescaling the per-capita diffusion rates dkk ' with the corresponding age-specific probability of travel and the population sizes of the age classes. If we indicate with r the fraction of children traveling (see Table 1), the per-capita diffusion rate for children traveling from a subpopulation with degree k  to a subpopulation with degree k ', dkk',c, is expressed as",

First, this value is used here to provide a comparison between the effects that school holidays may have had in the transmission scenario in Europe during Summer 2009 due to the altered contact pattern with respect to school term [36,37]. Indeed, contact data in the UK collected during school term and school holiday periods for 2009 showed that changing mixing patterns resulted in a decrease of approximately 25% to 35% in the reproductive number of influenza during the holidays, considering physical or conversational contacts, respectively [36]. With an estimated R0 for the UK in the range [1.4, 1.6] when schools were open, such reductions would thus correspond to approximately R0 = 1.05 during school holidays [36]. A second reason for considering the value R0 = 1.05, is also for testing scenarios where a higher value of R0 may have been reduced following the application of intervention strategies that do not alter the interaction or travel behaviors of individuals, such as e.g. through vaccination or antiviral treatment.",

The condition for global invasion is however made more complicated by the interplay between the local transmission dynamics and the mobility process that is responsible to seed non-infected subpopulations. Even in the occurrence of a local outbreak, given R0 > 1, the epidemic may indeed fail to spread spatially if the mobility rate is not large enough to ensure the travel of infected individuals to other subpopulations before the end of the local outbreak, or if the amount of seeding cases is not large enough to ensure the start of an outbreak in the reached subpopulation due to local extinction events. All these processes have a clear stochastic nature and they are captured by the definition of an additional predictor of the disease dynamics, R* > 1, regulating the number of subpopulations that become infected from a single initially infected subpopulation [28,43-46], analogously to the reproductive number R0 at the individual level. An expression for R* has been found in the case of metapopulation epidemic models with different types of mobility processes, including homogeneous, traffic-driven, and population-driven diffusion rates [28,46], commuting-like processes [47,48] and origin\u2013destination processes with adaptive behavior [49] or heterogeneous length of stay at destination [50]. In all those cases the population is assumed to mix homogeneously and to travel according to rates that are uniform across individuals. Here we go beyond those assumptions and examine the relationship between the occurrence of a global outbreak and the age-dependent transmission dynamics coupled with the age-specific travel behavior, through the calculation of the global invasion threshold R*.",

Figure 3A shows the behavior of the final attack rates zc and za as a function of the reproductive number R0, considering the partition of the population in children and adults observed in the 8 European countries of the Polymod dataset [22] and their mixing properties. Variations between countries, depending on the age profile and the mixing patterns, are observed. Countries are generally predicted to have significantly larger epidemic sizes in children, as shown, for example, by the case of Italy. This would correspond, on average, to a larger number of individuals in the children class that could potentially seed other subpopulations and sustain the spatial invasion. However this effect is counterbalanced by the age-specific traveling probabilities that are much lower in the children class. In the case of Belgium the final epidemic sizes in the two classes are found to be almost equal, with the size of the epidemic in the adult population being slightly larger than the one in the children population. This is the only country in the dataset under consideration that has a ratio \u03b7 larger than 1, indicating a larger average number of contacts established by adults with respect to children, likely induced by the specific survey methodology adopted [22].",

Here the two processes are considered as independent since we assume a multi-type branching process approximation. The probabilities of epidemic extinction given the introduction of a single case are determined as the solutions of the quadratic system dependent on the elements Rij of the next generation matrix [14], \u03c0i = [1 + Rii(1 \u2212 \u03c0i) + Rji(1 \u2212 \u03c0j)]\u2212 1, with i = c, a. If R0 < 1, the only solution is \u03c0c = \u03c0a = 1, i.e. the epidemic dies off. Otherwise, the system has solutions (\u03c0c, \u03c0a) in the range [0,1], as shown in Figure 3B. All countries (except Belgium) display a larger probability of extinction related to the introduction of a single adult case in the population, with respect to the introduction of a single infectious child. Given the mixing patterns, children are therefore more likely to start an outbreak than adults. \u03c0a ranges between 96.5% in the case of Italy and 99% in the case of Poland for R0 = 1.05, and between 83.5% and 88% for R0 = 1.2, showing that there were small chances for the H1N1 pandemic outbreak to start in the summer in those countries, in agreement with the observed unfolding [53]. In general, a large dependence of the probability of extinction on the reproductive number is observed. Analogously to the behavior discussed for the epidemic size, also for the probability of extinction Belgium represents a special case for which \u03c0c is slightly larger than \u03c0a, again induced by the larger average number of contacts in the adult class, differently from all other countries for which the data is available. Finally, in the case of homogeneous mixing in a non-partitioned population, we recover the probability of extinction to be equal to R0\u22121 (dashed line in the figure).",

To solve the system analytically, we simplify the recursive relation of Eq. (5) in the assumption of mild epidemics (i.e. in the limit of R0 close to 1), introduced or emerged in the system through a localized seeding event (so that the number of infected subpopulations can be neglected at the early stage of the spatial invasion), and considering the case of a mobility network lacking topological correlations (in this approximation the conditional probability P(k|k') can be simplified, see the Additional file 1). By manipulating the Equation (see the Additional file 1 for the full details of the calculation), we obtain a condition allowing the increase of the number of infected subpopulations and a global epidemic in the metapopulation system only if",

Equation (7) defines the threshold condition for the global invasion: if R* assumes values larger than 1, the epidemic starting from a given subpopulation will reach global proportion affecting a finite fraction of the subpopulations of the system; if instead R* < 1, the epidemic will be contained at its source and will not spread further to other locations. The global invasion threshold is a complex function of the disease history parameters, and of the parameters describing the age-specific mixing patterns and travel behavior through \u03c0c, \u03c0a, r, zc, za. Its dependence on the population spatial structure is embodied by travel fluxes and the topology of the mobility network, through w0, \u03b8, and the degree moments \u3008ka\u3009. However it is important to note that this indicator does not depend on the number of subpopulations V of the system, therefore it may be applicable to a variety of countries for which data is available, independently of their size. In the following we explore the dependence of R* on these multiple factors, examine their role in driving the pandemic extinction or invasion, and provide possible applications examples for a set of countries considering the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.",

The large degree fluctuations found in real transportation systems and mobility patterns [15-19] constitute one of the mechanisms responsible for driving R* to considerable high values, even when small values of the reproductive number are considered. Figure 3C shows the dependence of R* on the reproductive number accounting for changes in the topological heterogeneity of the mobility network (\u03b3 = 2 and \u03b3 = 3) and in the traffic heterogeneity along the air connections (\u03b8 = 0.5 and \u03b8 = 0, the latter being the homogeneous traffic case). The larger degree fluctuations obtained in the case \u03b3 = 2 strongly increase the ratio  (k2 + 2 \u03b8 \u2212 k1 + 2 \u03b8)/k, leading to values of R* ranging from ~10 for R0 = 1.05 up to approximately 103 for R0 = 2, a value of the reproductive number consistent with the estimate for the 1918\u20131919 pandemic [54]. It is important to note that, besides the threshold condition R* > 1, the absolute value of the estimator R* provides a quantitative indication of the effective reduction that needs to be reached through public health interventions in order to bring R* below its threshold value, i.e. the difference R* \u2212 1. The R* values for \u03b3 = 2 are roughly one order of magnitude greater than the values recovered in the case \u03b3 = 3, and in addition the condition for the epidemic invasion is more sensitive to variations in R0 in the case of larger heterogeneities in the air mobility patterns (\u03b3 = 2 vs. \u03b3 = 3).",

The partition into classes, though lowering the epidemic sizes and increasing the probability of extinction [35,55,56], is not able to drive the system below the threshold of the global invasion for the range of values explored. In addition, the contribution of the topological heterogeneity of the mobility network (k2 + 2 \u03b8 \u2212 k1 + 2 \u03b8)/k in increasing the value of R* is so large that it cannot be easily counterbalanced by reductions of the mobility scale w0 corresponding to interventions through air travel restrictions.

R* is an increasing function of the across-groups mixing \u03b5, indicating that a decrease in the assortativity level of the mixing pattern (corresponding to an increase of \u03b5) favors the spatial invasion. If a larger fraction of contacts is indeed established between adults and children, the local transmission dynamics mainly driven by children is able to spread to a larger fraction of the adult population, thus increasing the chances for the spatial dissemination of the pathogen. Here we study a situation in which r = 0, i.e. only adults travel, in order to isolate the effect of changes in the local transmission while neglecting the role of children in the mobility process.",

During school holiday period (panel A), European countries are found to be close to the critical level, with a portion of the parameter space for Europe in the extinction region, thus confirming the results presented before regarding variations in the country-specific risks of major epidemics. These findings are compatible with the heterogeneous transmission of H1N1 influenza virus in summer 2009 that was not sustained across continental Europe [53] and identify the main mechanisms responsible of these effects in the interplay between demographic/mixing features and the seeding during school holidays (due to similar school calendars, with the exception of the UK). If instead we consider that the influenza pandemic arrived in the UK during school term, our predictions indicate that the risk of a major epidemic with community and spatial transmission was expected to be very high even during summer period (Figure 5B), as observed in the country. Other factors undoubtedly played a role in producing the different transmission across countries, and they include humidity conditions [53], and the timing and magnitude of the coupling of the European continent to Mexico and the United States through international travel [3], both factors being country-specific and not considered here.",

As an example, we also explored the situation for the United States, considering synthetic information on individual contact networks built from activity surveys and simulations for the city of Portland [25]. By assuming the validity of this synthetic information for the whole country, we can compare the global invasion threshold in the US with the one studied in Europe from real country-specific data. Similar properties are found in the air transportation networks of the two regions, and the slight differences in the age partition (\u03b1 = 0.24 in the US vs. \u03b1 = 0.20 in Europe) do not lead to great discrepancies in the behavior of the global threshold as a function of the parameter \u03b7 (Additional file 1).",

Such a small change in r may also be enough to drive the system from the extinction phase to the major epidemic phase, for certain values of the other parameters. For example, an epidemic starting in a subpopulation in Italy, where the across-groups mixing is equal to \u03b5 = 0.08, would reach pandemic proportion if a small fraction of children would travel by air, with respect to the case in which such fraction is neglected (see the vertical line in Figure 6A). Given the specific seeding role of children vs. adults, age-targeted entry screening of travelers at airports may be envisaged in an attempt to prevent spatial transmission. The mild and self-limiting nature of most influenza infections, in addition to the presence of asymptomatic infections, is however likely to prevent a perfect identification and notification of cases at entry ports. Given that even a small percentage of children traveling would considerably increase the risk of spatial transmission, leading only to small delays in the invasion process [63], such interventions should be evaluated with respect to their actual efficacy in specific epidemic emergencies and balanced against the resources required for their implementation.",

The country seed of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mexico, has for instance a larger fraction of the population in the younger age class compared to the population of Europe, \u03b1 = 0.32 vs. \u03b1 = 0.20 (where the age classification used for Mexico is up to 15 years old instead of up to 18 years old as adopted in Europe, due to data availability) and is characterized by a larger number of contacts established by children with respect to adults (\u03b7 = 0.32 vs. \u03b7 = 0.79). Our predictions indicate that, for the same assortativity values, there exists a range of values of the epidemic transmission potential that is compatible with epidemic containment in Mexico, whereas Europe may experience spatial propagation of the disease (see Figure 6B for R0 = 1.05). Remarkably, the increase of the fraction of children and the change in the contact ratio, with no change in the across-groups mixing pattern (i.e. same \u03b5), is able to drive the system in the Mexican scenario to the extinction phase, reducing of 94% the global invasion threshold obtained for Europe if we consider a pathogen with a transmission potential compatible with the seasonal estimates of the H1N1 pandemic in Europe during summer 2009 [3]. Such results would be particularly important when considering the country where a new epidemic may emerge, as predictions obtained from previous works considering hypothetical seeding countries would be hardly applicable if demographic features are different. National preparedness plans may be informed by country-specific recommendations through the present approach, and an extensive exploration of the model\u2019s results in terms of classes of demographic and contact pattern features would help in providing more general insights on classes of seeding scenarios.",

Figure 7 addresses the comparison between the two cases, immunity and no-immunity, by showing the two corresponding critical curves R* = 1 in the \u03b1, \u03b5 plane for Europe and Mexico (panels A and B, respectively). The effect of pre-existing immunity in reducing the probability of a global epidemic spread is shown by the increase in the value of \u03b5 corresponding to the invasion condition R* = 1; a larger mixing across age classes is therefore needed for the pathogen to spatially propagate in case a fraction of the older age class is immune, whereas a more assortative population is predicted to be able to contain the emerging epidemic. The effect is very small for the case of Mexico, while for Europe it is more visible given that the considered European population is, on average, older than the Mexican one, and thus a larger fraction of the adult population is assumed to be immune in Europe with respect to Mexico (9.6% in Europe vs. 4.4% in Mexico). The points (\u03b1, \u03b5) parameterized with the average European data and with Mexican data (corresponding dots in the Figure 7) both lie in the spatial invasion phase when we consider R0 \u2265 1.2 in Europe and R0 \u2265 1.4 in Mexico.",

We consider this approximation a reasonable one for regions characterized by population features that are quite uniform across space, for instance if we consider the subpopulations within a given country; already at the European level we noticed how small variations in demographic features and mixing patterns may be responsible for diverse outcomes regarding extinction or invasion, and additional layers of heterogeneities need to be considered when variations among populations within the system are larger (e.g. regarding travel behavior per age class, as shown in Figure 1B).

On the other hand, given the relevance of demographic profiles, mixing patterns and age-specific travel resulting from the present study, it would be important to further extend large-scale spatial transmission computational models to include such features. While computationally feasible, the main limitation nowadays is represented by the availability of mixing data and travel behavior for a large set of countries, given a global level objective.

We introduced and solved a multi-host stochastic metapopulation model to quantify these aspects and characterize the conditions of the population partition and heterogeneous travel behavior that lead to the pandemic global invasion. Notwithstanding the high level of assortativity observed in contact patterns data by age, that increase the probability of pandemic extinction, the model explains the spread at the global level observed in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic as induced by the interplay between the heterogeneity of the air mobility network structure, favoring the spread, and the population partition. A major epidemic is always achieved for R0 \u2265 1.2 even in the case children are assumed not to travel, when the model is parameterized with European countries data and statistics. Results are also consistent with the occurrence of sporadic outbreaks in continental Europe during summer 2009 and widespread transmission in the UK, once the model is informed with the substantial reduction in transmission associated to school holidays.",
