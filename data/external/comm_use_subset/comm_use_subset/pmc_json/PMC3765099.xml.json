First, they are mostly managed in primary care and are extremely common and costly to service providers, families and employers [1,2]. Second, there is clinical uncertainty in primary care regarding the diagnosis and best management of RTIs, as reflected by the variation in the use of antibiotics in primary care for RTIs between nations [3], general practitioner (GP) practices [4] and clinicians [5,6]. Thirdly, antibiotic prescribing by primary care clinicians in the UK is again on the rise [7] and finally combined with the slowing in the development of new antibiotics, the overuse and misuse of existing antibiotics is associated with the development and proliferation of antimicrobial resistance between [8] and within [9] nations as well as individuals [8-10]. The use of antibiotics also leads to the subsequent \u2018medicalisation of illness\u2019 in which patients believe they should consult for similar symptoms in the future [11]. Thus, the increasing or decreasing use of antibiotics can lead to vicious or virtuous re-consultation cycles.",

This criterion was set to reduce the effect of what is known as \u2018confounding by indication\u2019. This is the phenomenon whereby the way primary care clinicians already decide to which children they will prescribe antibiotics is to an extent associated with any clinical prediction tool that might be developed. This plausible possibility will of course in itself alter the risk of the hospitalisation outcome amongst children in the study, and hence in turn reduce the apparent associations between some risk factors and the outcome. In addition, in order to ensure an unbiased sample of the full illness spectrum, clinicians are asked to identify a systematic recruitment strategy. Clinicians are asked to specify how many children per week they expect to recruit. To measure the success of clinicians\u2019 recruitment strategies, and to establish the generalisability of recruited children to the population as a whole, clinicians are asked to complete some brief details on those children that they invited to participate but declined and those they missed. Clinicians are asked to use the online database or complete and send postcards to record the child\u2019s illness severity and the reason for decline or missed opportunity to recruit. A \u2018missed\u2019 opportunity to recruit is defined as those children who would have normally met the clinician\u2019s own strategy criteria and the study inclusion criteria but where the clinician decided not to recruit for whatever reason (for instance, the clinician forgot or was too busy).",

For outcomes such as hospitalisation, re-consultation, lengthy symptom duration and antibiotic prescribing testing will include chi-square for categorical variables (or Fisher\u2019s exact test when the expected cell is less than 5) and both a parametric and non-parametric approach for continuous variables depending on the nature of the distribution. Internal validation will be used for assessing the value of a derived rule [34]. We will also explore alternative approaches including bootstrapping and subdivision of the sample on a selective rather than a random basis so as to assess the robustness of the rule in different circumstances (such as geographical location). The clinical prediction rule will be developed based on the linear predictor in a logistic regression model in which the outcome variable is hospitalisation among children not treated with antibiotics. Candidate prognostic variables will be categorised into demographic background, and symptoms and signs (for example, overall illness severity, fever, shortness of breath). Variables included in logistic regression models will be based on an \u2018inclusive\u2019 p-value threshold of 0.1 in the univariable analysis. Significance in the multivariable model will take into account the number of variables tested using multiple testing methods such as the Bonferroni Correction. We will check for nonlinear effects of continuous variables, and will examine candidate interactions specified a priori. Such effects will be included in the final models as necessary. We will begin by examining the predictive value (based on diagnostic odds ratios and confidence interval (CI) statistics) of the best predictors from the socio-demographic variables.
