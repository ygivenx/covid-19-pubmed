Bacterial pathogens are well known as principal causes of HAP. Such species include Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter species, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Escherichia coli\n[3], [4]. Traditionally, respiratory viruses have been given minimal attention as a cause of hospital-acquired infection [5]. Although several previous investigators reported on the role of respiratory viruses, those studies were mainly confined to patients with hematologic malignancy [6], or hematopoietic stem cell or solid organ transplant recipients [7]\u2013[13]. Also, these studies included both upper respiratory tract infections and lower respiratory tract infections, and did not distinguish between hospital-acquired and community-acquired infections. Hospital-acquired respiratory viral infections, including influenza virus [14], [15], human respiratory syncytial virus [16], [17], human metapneumovirus [18], and SARS-coronavirus [19] outbreaks, have been demonstrated previously in non-immunocompromised patients as well as immunocompromised patients.",

Several previous investigations that compared PCR with conventional methods (viral culture, antigen detection, and serological assays) for virus identification showed that the incidence of viral infection has been considerably underestimated in the absence of PCR [9], [10], [22]. Using multiplex reverse-transcription PCR methods, we previously showed that viral infection is as common as bacterial infection in adult patients from the community with severe pneumonia requiring ICU admission [23].",

Viral infection was associated with comparable mortality rates to bacterial infection. To our knowledge, this is the first study that was focused on respiratory viral pathogens in adult patients with severe HAP. The strength of our study is that viruses were detected from BAL fluid specimens in nearly two-thirds of our subject patients (62.7%, 37/59), which suggests that considerable numbers of identified viruses can be regarded as actual pathogens.",

Prior studies regarding patients with hematologic malignancy or hematopoietic stem cell transplant, or solid organ transplants [9]\u2013[13], also showed that respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus and parainfluenza virus were major viral pathogens in those populations. Rhinovirus, a well-known cause of the common cold, is increasingly being recognized as an important cause of lower respiratory tract infection, mainly in severely immunocompromised patients, such as hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients [13], [29]. In our current study cohort, rhinovirus was found to be the third most commonly identified pathogen and to be more commonly associated with severe HAP compared with influenza virus. However, the significance of rhinovirus detection in respiratory specimens from pneumonia patients is a subject of some debate. Earlier studies have indicated that chronic shedding of rhinoviruses for more than 4 weeks is not uncommon in both immunocompetent individuals and immunocompromised patients [30], [31]. In our present study, rhinoviruses were identified in the BAL fluid from 10 out of 15 rhinovirus-positive cases, which suggests that, at least in these cases, these viruses would be significant pathogens rather than colonizers. In our present study, compared with our previous results regarding CAP or HCAP [23], the proportion of human metapneumovirus was found to be much lower in severe HAP cases (CAP or HCAP, 18.1% [13/72] vs. HAP, 3.4% [2/59]). Notably, viral infection in non-immunocompromised patients was not uncommon (11.1%, 16/143), although it was not as frequent as that in immunocompromised patients (36.4%, 43/119). Compared with immunocompromised patients, non-immunocompromised patients were older and more likely to have underlying COPD, tuberculous destroyed lung disease, and/or chronic kidney disease (Table 4). Taken together, our data suggest that, even in patients who are not known to be immunocompromised, viral infection should be considered when patients are elderly, especially in those with structural lung disease or chronic kidney disease.",

Prior studies of viral pneumonia in patients with hematologic malignancy or who received haematopoietic stem cell transplant have reported a lower incidence of coinfection ranging from 8.8% to 14.3% [6], [32]. In our present analyses, as found previously in adult CAP [23], coinfection was commonly identified. Of 59 patients with identified viral pathogens, 23 (39.0%) were infected by a single virus, 21 (35.6%) were coinfected with bacteria and 11 (16.9%) were coinfected with another virus. In CAP, some reports have shown that polymicrobial infection can be associated with poorer outcomes [33]\u2013[37], most of these coinfections were influenza plus pneumococcal infections [36], [37]. In our results, however, clinical manifestation and outcomes in patients with or without coinfection were not significantly different (Table S2) and none of the combinations of polymicrobial pathogens were dominantly observed. The 28 day mortalities of our patients with bacterial infections, viral infections and bacterial-viral coinfections were 29.5% (46/156), 35.6% (21/59) and 19.0% (4/21) (p = 0.321), respectively. However, considering the relatively small number of patients with various combinations of pathogens, the severity of underlying disease and comorbidities, further investigation is required with larger populations.",

First, the study was conducted at a single center and included only patients with severe pneumonia who were admitted to the medical ICU; thus, the results may not be generalizable. Second, since our study was an observational one, we could not intervene in terms of specific procedures or laboratory tests. Therefore, some patients did not undergo bronchoscopic BAL or testing for respiratory virus. This means that the actual rate of viral infection might be higher than that indicated by our results. Third, among 59 patients with viral infection, viruses were isolated solely from nasopharyngeal specimens in 22 patients (37.3%). These cases might include cases of coincidental upper respiratory viral infection. Finally, we did not perform virus testing for herpes simplex virus, which is known to cause pneumonia, especially in immunocompromised patients with hematologic malignancy [38].",
