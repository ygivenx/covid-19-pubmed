The causative pathogen, a novel human Betacoronavirus (HCoV-EMC), was quickly identified from the sputum samples of the earlier case [1] and the gene sequence of this virus was 99.5% identical to that of the virus isolated from clinical samples of the later case.",

However, most of these vaccine candidates may also induce immunopathology or other harmful immune responses [7,8], raising concerns about their safety. On the other hand, recombinant proteins containing the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV S protein could be developed as a safe and effective SARS vaccine. This potential is based on the ability of receptor binding domain-based vaccine to induce stronger cross-neutralizing antibody responses and protection against SARS-CoV [9], with a correspondingly lower probability of inducing immunopathology, in contrast with the other SARS vaccine candidates mentioned previously [6].",

Fortunately, however, according to the \u2018Animal Rule\u2019, a pivotal animal efficacy study can be conducted for evaluating the in vivo efficacy of the anti-SARS vaccines using two animal species that exhibit pathophysiology of the disease and host immune responses that closely match those of humans [12].
