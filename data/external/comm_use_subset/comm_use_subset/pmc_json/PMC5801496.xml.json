            "text": "Human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) is the leading cause worldwide of severe acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRI, mainly bronchiolitis and pneumonia) in infants and very young children. The estimated new cases of ALRI each year owing to hRSV infections are more than 33 million in children younger than 5 years, with 10% of these resulting in hospital admissions. hRSV infections also cause 60,000\u2013120,000 deaths each year in young children, with 90% occurring in developing countries (Nair et al, 2010; Shi et al, 2017). Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is also a virus of clinical significance (van den Hoogen et al, 2001), second only to hRSV as a cause of ALRI in young children (Edwards et al, 2013; Schuster & Williams, 2013). Both hRSV and hMPV also have a clinical impact in the elderly and in adults with cardiopulmonary disease or impaired immune systems (Hall et al, 1986; Dowell et al, 1996; Falsey et al, 2005; Panda et al, 2014). hRSV and hMPV have been recently reclassified in the orthopneumovirus and metapneumovirus genera, respectively, of the newly created Pneumoviridae family, which was detached from the original Paramyxoviridae family (Afonso et al, 2016). Hence, hRSV and hMPV share clinical and biological features, although they also have important differences, for example, in the number of genes or in the proteolytic processing of their respective fusion (F) glycoproteins (van den Hoogen et al, 2002).",

SH is a small hydrophobic protein whose function is still unclear and is incorporated in low amounts into the virus particle (Bao et al, 2008; Gan et al, 2012). G is a heavily glycosylated and highly variable type II glycoprotein that resembles mucins and serves as the viral attachment protein (Levine et al, 1987; Thammawat et al, 2008). Finally, F is a type I glycoprotein that fuses the viral and cell membranes at the initial stages of an infectious cycle and is the main target of neutralizing antibodies (for a recent review Melero & Mas, 2015).",

Both hRSV F and hMPV F are trimers of disulfide\u2010linked heterodimers, and these F proteins initially fold into a metastable prefusion conformation. During membrane fusion, the F glycoprotein refolds through a series of unstable intermediates into a highly stable postfusion conformation that shares some neutralizing epitopes with the prefusion conformation (Lamb et al, 2006; McLellan et al, 2013b).",

A wealth of data support the conclusion that neutralizing antibodies are the major players in protection against hRSV and hMPV infections (for a recent review Melero & Mas, 2015). The majority of these antibodies are directed against the F glycoprotein (Walsh & Hruska, 1983), and it was recently shown that most of the hRSV\u2010neutralizing activity present in human sera was due to antibodies specific for the metastable prefusion F conformation (Magro et al, 2012; Ngwuta et al, 2015).",

Stabilized soluble forms of prefusion hRSV F were shown to induce higher levels of neutralizing antibodies than soluble postfusion hRSV F in mice, cotton rats, and non\u2010human primates (McLellan et al, 2013a; Krarup et al, 2015; Palomo et al, 2016). However, postfusion F, which has the advantage of being highly stable, can induce sizeable levels of neutralizing antibodies and afford protection against hRSV because it shares certain epitopes with prefusion F (Swanson et al, 2011). Recently, the structure of a soluble form of postfusion hMPV F was determined, revealing extensive similarity with postfusion hRSV F despite having only ~38% sequence identity (Mas et al, 2016). In addition, the purified postfusion hMPV F protein was able to elicit high titers of neutralizing antibodies in mice (Mas et al, 2016).",

Based on knowledge gained about the antigenic structure of these two proteins, we engineered a series of chimeric proteins in which certain epitopes of hRSV F were grafted onto hMPV F and vice versa. When mice were inoculated with the purified chimeras, they elicited antibodies that neutralized both hRSV and hMPV. Furthermore, in cases that were tested, immunization of mice with the chimeric proteins afforded protection against a challenge with the virus used for grafting of the heterologous antigenic site. Passive transfer of the mouse sera also reduced significantly lung virus titer after challenge, demonstrating the prominent role of antibodies in the protection provided by the chimeric F proteins.",

In other cases, the aim is to develop vaccines that will cross\u2010protect against related viruses from the same family, such as the Flaviviridae Zika and dengue viruses (Barba\u2010Spaeth et al, 2016).

The structure of hRSV F site II is a helix\u2013turn\u2013helix motif (Toiron et al, 1996) conserved in the prefusion and postfusion conformations of the F protein. Thus, hRSV F site II has been grafted onto different protein scaffolds to focus the antibody responses elicited against those unnatural antigens to a site in hRSV F, which is recognized by neutralizing antibodies (McLellan et al, 2011a; Correia et al, 2014; Luo et al, 2015). The results obtained so far have had limited success, since the antibodies induced in mice were not neutralizing despite being able to bind hRSV F. Only in one case, in which site II was grafted onto an immunoglobulin scaffold, did the resulting immunogen induce antibodies in mice that neutralized hRSV in vitro, although with relatively low efficiency (Luo et al, 2015). In another case, the site II scaffold induced hRSV\u2010neutralizing antibodies in macaques, but not in mice, after repeated doses (Correia et al, 2014).",

            "text": "While the protection afforded by the chimeric proteins in the experiment of Fig 4B cannot be ascribed exclusively to antibodies, the relevance of antibodies in protection was substantiated by the results of the adoptive transfer experiment of Fig EV3. Since other studies have already demonstrated the capacity of postfusion hMPV F to induce protective immune responses in cotton rats (Cseke et al, 2007), hamsters (Herfst et al, 2007), mice (Aerts et al, 2015), and macaques (Herfst et al, 2008), the chimeric proteins could have the advantage over the epitope scaffolding approach in that they would confer protection simultaneously against more than one virus. This possibility however needs to be tested directly in perhaps more permissive animal models such as cotton rats where protection in the upper and lower respiratory tract against hRSV and hMPV could be assessed. Additionally, non\u2010human primates may be a more decisive model to test an optimized chimeric F candidate.",

Grafting of other antigenic sites, like those specific to prefusion hRSV F, deserves being tested. The yield of certain chimeric proteins, as shown in Fig EV1, turned out to be extremely low. In that sense, it is worth noting that grafting of hRSV site II yielded proteins that could be expressed and purified while incorporation of hMPV F site II into either postfusion or prefusion hRSV F ablated the expression of the matching chimeric proteins (Fig EV1). Thus, fine tuning of changes introduced in chimeric proteins may be critical for their expression and immunogenicity. The use of other expression systems or incorporation of chimeric proteins into viral vectors (Liang et al, 2017) or virus particles (McGinnes et al, 2015) are alternatives to improve production and/or immunogenicity of chimeric F proteins. Nonetheless, the results presented here represent a proof of principle to design chimeric proteins that may be used as single immunogens to induce cross\u2010neutralizing and cross\u2010protecting immune responses against the important Pneumoviridae members, hRSV and hMPV.",
