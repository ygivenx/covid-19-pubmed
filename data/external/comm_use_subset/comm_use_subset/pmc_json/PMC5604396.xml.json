The pathogenesis of HFMD has been widely reported to be associated with viral infection\u2010induced cell death.3, 4 Experimental results verified that HEV71 enters permissive cells via a receptor\u2010mediated endocytosis. Two receptors for HEV71 have been identified: human P\u2010selectin glycoprotein ligand\u20101 (PSGL\u20101) and human scavenger receptor class B member 2 (SCARB2).3, 5 During this process, the plasma membrane invaginates to form vesicle, which is pivotal for wrapping the virus. Filament growth and membrane deformation generate forces that promote invagination of the virus.6 Many simulation studies have focused on this process of endocytosis, and provided useful information for understanding this process.7 Cell membranes are considered as the first barrier to defend cells from external harms.8 To complete the replicative cycle, virus must penetrate cell membranes. However, the real dynamic parameters for this step, such as forces that generated in the process of endocytosis and the time of wrapping virus by cell membranes, of single\u2010virus invagination are still unclear. The lack of dynamic parameters of single HEV71 invagination severely hinders the research on HFMD, because the infection of HEV71 is directly related to its endocytosis. Therefore, the dynamic parameters (force and wrapping time etc.) of the HEV71 invagination process at its initial infection can provide the missing information to understand the viral infection mechanism, which will pave the way for the future diagnosis and treatment of HMFD.",

These conditions make it necessary to perform experimental operations related to live HEV71 virus in biosafety level 2 (BSL\u20102) facilities,9 an inconvenience, considering the disposal of samples and use of instruments. As an alternative, virus\u2010like particles (VLPs) are empty particles consisting of viral structural proteins without viral genetic material. They are similar to the authentic virus structurally and can mimic authentic virus to elicit strong and broad immune responses; therefore, they are noninfectious and safe for experimentation in ordinary labs.10 Many types of VLPs have been expressed and applied for clinical research, such as Influenza,11 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus12 and Hepatitis B virus,13 and to investigate the interactions between viruses and cells by colocalization and single\u2010particle tracking.14 Here, we use force tracing technique to directly record the endocytic force and wrapping time of single VLPs via cell membranes. Combining with simulation, we reveal the dynamic process of single VLPs invagination, which provides critical hints for further understanding the mechanism of viral infection.",

In order to examine whether the VLPs can be used to replace the authentic HEV71 virus for infection in Vero cell, we used the anti\u2010HEV71 monoclonal antibody for locating virus infection (Figure S2, Supporting Information). These results demonstrated that HEV71 VLPs do not alter the entry property and can be used for further research. Then, the purified VLPs were covalently conjugated onto an atomic force microscopy (AFM) tip via a heterobifunctional polyethylene glycol (PEG) linker and the VLP could not enter the cytoplasm, thus the cell viability remained constant after performing force tracing curves. The tip modification is shown in Figure\n\n1\na. To verify the viral density on the AFM tip, the silicon surface was functionalized with virions under the same conditions as those on the AFM tip. The AFM image shows that the silicon surface is covered with a dense monolayer of about 120 virions per square micrometer (Figure 1c). The diameter of a single virion is 26 \u00b1 2 nm which is measured by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (400 particles were analyzed), as shown in Figure 1d. Taking into account a tip radius of about 20\u201330 nm, the density of virions on the silicon surface confirms that, in most cases, only a single virus particle was attached on the tip apex for force measurement, which is suitable for investigating the single viral entry.",

Figure\n\n3\na shows the typical curves before (lower) and after (upper) blocking with reagents. After injecting cytochalasin B (CB), a cell\u2010permeable mycotoxin, into the AFM liquid chamber during force tracing measurement, most of the force signal disappeared, and the probability of tracing curves with force signal decreased from 10.8% (Figure 3b(A)) to 1% (Figure 3b(B)). We also engaged force tracing curves on the Vero cells by the clean AFM tip (without being modified with VLPs), and the probability of force tracing curves with force signals was about 0.3% (Figure 3b(C)). The force value of force tracing curves engaged by the clean tip was obviously decreased to about 20 pN (Figure 3c,d), which is much smaller than that from a virus\u2010tethered tip (58 \u00b1 16 pN). At last, we measured the fluctuation of the living cells, and the force signal was easily distinguished from the fluctuation of living cells (Figure\n\n4\n). To measure the fluctuation of a living cell, the clean AFM tip was approached to the cell surface and gently touched the cell membrane with a force of about 20 pN. Then the feedback system was switched off and the cantilever moved free. The fluctuation of the cell could be detected (Figure 4a). The long\u2010lasting experiment for recording the cell fluctuation with clean AFM tip is shown in Figure S4 (Supporting Information). The force caused by cell membrane fluctuation is much smaller than the endocytosis force (Figure 4b). We also noticed that the time of cell membrane fluctuation was at the level of several seconds (Figure 4c), which is larger than that from the endocytosis force in Figure 2a. These control experiments confirm that the force tracing signals were caused by the viral invagination.",

            "text": "We further investigate the atomic mechanisms of viral entry by using molecular dynamic simulation (details are shown in Figure S5, Supporting Information). Initially, a sphere rigid nanoparticle (represents the virus) with diameter of 30 nm is created and put 27 nm above the bilayer membrane. The system is relaxed for 10 ns, while the virus is fixed at its initial position. Then through steered molecular dynamics,18 the nanoparticle is pulled down toward the bilayer membrane with a constant pulling velocity 0.1 r\nc/\u03c4 until it reaches to the surface of the bilayer membrane. In order to measure the force required by the cell membrane to endocytose the nanoparticle, the nanoparticle is assumed to attach to a virtual spring on the boundary with its spring constant as 0.5 k\nB\nT/\u03c32 and its equilibrium distance R\n0 = 20 nm as shown in Figure\n\n6\n. At the beginning of the simulation, the membrane is under zero tension with the lipid per area A\n0 = 1r\nc\n2. During the simulations, in order to keep the membrane surface under zero tension, the size of the box in the X\u2013Y plane is tuned to maintain the zero\u2010tension condition. For example, if the new area per lipid A\nb is greater than A\n0, the simulation box will be compressed in the X\u2013Y plane until A\nb = A\n0, while if A\nb < A\n0 the box will be stretched in the X\u2013Y plane until A\nb = A\n0. Meanwhile, the box length in the normal direction of the membrane will change correspondingly to keep the box volume fixed. It has been widely revealed that the receptor on the cell membrane could facilitate the endocytosis process of exotic nanoparticles.19, 20 Before contact with the virus, the receptors in the cell membrane are assumed to be uniformly distributed. Thanks to the strong attraction between the virus and receptors on the bilayer membrane, once the contact between virus and cell membrane starts, the receptor density within the contact area increases and the receptors in the neighborhood of the contact region are driven to the contact zone by diffusion.21 The relatively large nanoparticles compared with the membrane thickness (5 nm) may easily increase the adhesion area and strength with the membrane which further increase the diffusive motion of receptors toward virus.20 Our simulation shows that the nanoparticle is quickly (7.82 ns) endocytosed by the cell membrane after attaching onto the membrane (Figure 6b,c). Previous studies have shown that there is an optimal nanoparticle radius for endocytosis by cells resulting from the competition between the thermodynamic driving force and receptor diffusion kinetics.21 In this study, the nanoparticle cannot be fully engulfed due to its large size. The upper surface of the virus is eventually covered by the receptors traveling over a longer distance; hence, a longer wrapping time (30.9 ns) is required for the process (Figure 6c,d).",

The molecular epidemiology, evolution, and molecular genetics of HEV71 have been studied widely,1 however, the dynamic process of viral invagination is still unclear because of the limitation of current approaches. HEV71 is a small and round virus with the shape of regular icosahedron and the size of \u224830 nm, which is suitable for tip functionalization and particle tracking analysis. By force tracing with constant piezoceramics position, the process of viral invagination via cell membranes was recorded until it reaches the balance between endocytosis force and pulling force of AFM cantilever. The force tracing technique occupies several advantages: (i) It allows the single virion investigation, which provides a potent approach to study viral behaviors at the single particle level; (ii) The force of viral invagination is obtained, which is unavailable by real\u2010time fluorescence microscopy,17, 22 (iii) It enables to extremely fast record the viral invagination at the microsecond level and provide detailed dynamic information, which is unachievable by other current techniques.",

The duration for viral invagination is \u2248280 ms, which is shorter than the theoretical predicted wrapping time of nanoparticle with a diameter of about 30 nm.21 Our simulation shows that the virus can reach a partially wrapped state very fast (Figure 6b,c), then it takes almost four times as long (30.9/7.82) for the membrane traveling over a longer distance to completely wrap the virus (Figure 6c,d). Although the time scale between experiments and simulations is always disparate,23 the simulations in this work provides a hint for understanding why the viral internalization time we detected is shorter than theoretical prediction. In this work, the time we detected is that it takes for the HEV71 to be partially wrapped; hence, it is much shorter than the theoretical predication (2 s).21 According to the process provided by simulation, it may take a much longer period time to completely wrap the virus. Combining the experiment with the simulation, it is speculated that the wrapping of HEV71 occurs in two phases. First, the wrapping of virus is dynamically trapped at a partially wrapped state rapidly, and the main mechanical pulling force is generated in this step. Then, the upper surface of the virus is covered by the receptors traveling over a long period of time.",
