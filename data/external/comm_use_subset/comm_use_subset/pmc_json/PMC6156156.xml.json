The presence of an exceptional ornamental plumage with large tail-coverts in peacock, which makes it vulnerable to predators attack, posed a question on his theory of natural selection. Darwin\u2019s problem was to explain the presence of peacock\u2019s train through his theory of natural selection as it seemed to be disadvantageous to male peafowl. Subsequently, Charles Darwin justified the presence of such ornamental traits including peacock\u2019s train by proposing the theory of sexual selection according to which these ornamental characters provide advantage to an individual over others of same species by providing higher reproductive success (Darwin, 1888).",

The Blue peafowl (Indian Peacock) is endemic to the Indian subcontinent, whereas, the Green Peafowl is found across Southeast Asia. Peacock (male peafowl) is one of the largest known bird among pheasants and flying birds. It shows sexual dimorphism, polygamy with no paternal care to offspring, and an elaborate male display during courtship (Zahavi, 1975; Ramesh and Mcgowan, 2009). Sexual selection is considered extreme in peacock, which is dependent upon both the ornamental display (glittering train and crest plumage) and behavioral traits (Loyau et al., 2005b). These ornamental features are also used as an honest signal about their immunocompetence to the peahen, which helps in the selection of individuals with better immunity (Loyau et al., 2005a). Though, the male traits are testosterone-dependent in peacock, the large train is the default state since the peahen also shows the development of this train after ovariectomy (Owens and Short, 1995).",

However, the genomic details about the phenotypic evolution of this species are still unknown. Therefore, we carried out a comprehensive comparative genomics analysis of P. cristatus (Blue Peafowl) to decipher the genomic evolution of this species. The ornamental and sexual characteristics of peacock are distinct from other birds and are absent in closely related species such as chicken and turkey; this presents an ideal set-up to look for the genomic changes underlying the phenotypic divergence of peacock. Moreover, the origin of ocelli in the peacock feathers is relatively recent and independent of the other ocellated genera of birds such as Argusianus and Ploypectron in the Phasianidae family (Sun et al., 2014). Thus, studying the molecular evolution of peacock at genome-wide level is crucial to have a holistic understanding about these phenotypes. We also carried out a comprehensive comparative genome-wide analysis of the peacock genome (order Galliformes) with the high quality genomes of five other birds under the class Aves: chicken and turkey (order Galliformes), duck (order Anseriformes), and flycatcher and zebra finch (order Passeriformes). The comparative genome-wide analysis of peacock with five other related birds provided novel genomic insights into peacock genome evolution.",

This study protocol was carried out in accordance with the approval of Institute Ethics committee of IISER Bhopal. The permission to collect blood samples was obtained from Principal Chief Conservator of Forests Bhopal. The fresh blood sample was immediately brought to the laboratory at 4\u00b0C and genomic DNA was extracted using DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, United States) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Sex of the bird was determined to be male by morphological identification and was confirmed using molecular sexing assay (Supplementary Text S1). Multiple shotgun genomic libraries were prepared using Illumina TruSeq DNA PCR-free library preparation kit and Nextera XT sample preparation kit (Illumina Inc., United States), as per the manufacturers protocol. The insert size for the TruSeq libraries was selected to be 550 bp and the average insert size for Nextera XT libraries was 300\u20131,200 bp (average 650). The sequencing library size for both the libraries was assessed on 2100 Bioanalyzer using High Sensitivity DNA kit (Agilent, United States). The libraries were quantified using KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR Master mix with Illumina standards and primer premix (KAPA Biosystems, Wilmington, MA, United States), and Qubit dsDNA HS kit on a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Life Technologies, United States) as per the Illumina suggested protocol. The normalized libraries were loaded on Illumina NextSeq 500 platform using NextSeq 500/550 v2 sequencing reagent kit (Illumina Inc., United States) and 150 bp paired-end sequencing was performed for all the libraries.",

The autosomal data of the peacock diploid genome sequence was filtered by excluding sites at which the inferred consensus quality was below 20, and the read depth was either one-third or more than twice of the average read depth across the genome. Since, mean coverage and percentage of missing data, both are important filtering thresholds in PSMC analysis, the minimum length of the contigs selected for carrying out the analysis was 5,000 bp based on no more than 25% of the missing data as suggested by Nadachowska-Brzyska et al. (2016) (Supplementary Figure S1). The resultant filtered genome sequence used for the analysis was 76% of the total genome. The parameters for PSMC were set to \u201cN30 -t5 -r5 -p4+30\u221724+610,\u201d which were used previously for the 38 bird species (Nadachowska-Brzyska et al., 2015). Generation time and mutation rate are necessary to scale the results of PSMC analysis to real time. Hence, a generation time of 4 years was used in this analysis and was calculated as twice of the sexual maturity, which is 2 years for peacock according to \u201cAnAge\u201d database (Nadachowska-Brzyska et al., 2015). The mutation rate of 1.33e-09 was used as calculated in a previous study (Wright et al., 2015). It is known that the estimates of Ne from PSMC can be influenced by the quality of the genome and sequencing coverage. To ensure that our results are not strongly influenced by such artifacts, 100 bootstrap runs were performed to estimate the Ne from different parts of the genome to ascertain variability in the estimates of Ne.",

The final peacock gene-set using the combination of homology and de novo based approach comprised of 24,831 transcripts corresponding to 15,970 genes. All these gene sequences were translated and checked for premature stop codon. It was observed that 187 coding gene sequences corresponding to 136 genes had a premature stop codon in their sequence. Out of these, 130 genes had at least one valid coding transcript and were included in the analysis performed in this study.",

The phylogenetic tree analysis was carried out to determine the phylogeny from the concatenated alignments of orthologs including peacock, and to compare this phylogeny with other known phylogenies derived from different types of data. The likelihood-based tree-searching algorithm was used for phylogenetic tree reconstruction using PhyML version 3.1 (Guindon et al., 2010). In the case of nucleotide sequences, the default HKY85 model was used to construct the phylogenies of individual genes and mitochondrial genome, whereas the optimized GTR model was used to construct the phylogeny of concatenated alignments of orthologous genes. JTT model was utilized for constructing the phylogeny of protein sequences. The RY-coded phylogeny was constructed using PhyML version 3.1 with the default model of HKY85, whereas the Binary-coded phylogeny was constructed using RAxML version 8.2.10 (Stamatakis, 2014) with the default model \u201cBINGAMMA\u201d for binary data. To test for the robustness of the constructed phylogenetic trees, bootstrap technique was employed. A bootstrap value of 100 was used for individual gene based trees, RY-coded tree, and binary-coded tree. A bootstrap value of 1,000 was used for the mitochondrial and concatenated alignment-based trees (Hillis and Bull, 1993; Dunn et al., 2008). Time for the horizontal axis of the phylogenetic trees were derived from the TimeTree database (Hedges et al., 2006). The Robinson and Foulds distance (Robinson and Foulds, 1981) between individual gene trees and the concatenated alignment trees was calculated using the \u201cRF.dist\u201d function in R package \u201cphangorn v2.0.3\u201d (Schliep, 2010).",

Based on the alignment and the phylogenetic tree, the calculations of likelihood scores with revised branch-site model A was performed to identify the signatures of positive selection in peacock for the considered coding gene sequence. This model tries to detect positive selection acting on specific sites on the particular specified branches (foreground branch) (Yang et al., 2005; Zhang J. et al., 2005). The \u201cforeground branch\u201d consisted of peacock, and the other branches constituted the \u201cbackground branch.\u201d The codons were categorized into previously assumed four classes in the model based on the foreground and background estimates of dN/dS (\u03c9) values. The alternative hypothesis, according to which the foreground branch show positive selection with \u03c9 > 1 was compared with the null hypothesis, according to which all branches have the same \u03c9 = 1 value. The comparison was performed using Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) values based chi-square test. The genes with FDR q-value (after multiple testing correction of LRT p-values) less than 0.1 were considered to be positively selected in peacock. Additionally, the amino acid sites under positive selection were identified using the Bayesian Empirical Bayes values for the branch-site model A (Zhang J. et al., 2005).

Out of these protein-coding gene sequences of peacock, the pair-wise orthologs for 18,314, 10,232, 9,900, 9,097, and 9,887 genes could be identified in chicken, turkey, flycatcher, zebra finch and duck genomes, respectively. A total of 5,907 combined orthologs could be identified across all the six bird species.",

Since many miRNAs also bind to the target 3\u2032-UTR with imperfect complementarities and function as translational repressors, miRNA targeting sites in the upstream regions of the genes were identified for peacock and other five bird genomes. A total of 306 miRNAs targeting 2,379 genes were identified using this approach in peacock. These genes predominantly belonged to the functional categories such as signal transduction, protein modifications, and transcription (Supplementary Figure S4) for all the birds including peacock. The peacock genome was found to have less repetitive DNA (8.62%) as compared to chicken (9.45%) (Supplementary Data S7). The comparison of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) between chicken and peacock revealed 2,051,161 heterozygous SNVs at a rate of 2.05 SNV per Kb. The observed SNV rate in peacock was closer to turkey in comparison to the other avian species (Supplementary Text S4 and Supplementary Data S8). PSMC analysis suggested that the peacock suffered at least two bottlenecks (around four million and 450,000 years ago), which resulted in a severe reduction in its effective population size (Figure 1). It was also interesting to note that the results of PSMC analysis of peacock were similar to the demographic history of the tropical bowerbird and turkey vulture that show long-term decrease in the effective population size (Nadachowska-Brzyska et al., 2015), perhaps because all three birds are native to the tropical rain forests.",

From the phylogenetic tree obtained in this study, it is apparent that Galliformes and Anseriforms are monophyletic, forming the known group Galloanserae (Figure 2). Moreover, peacock was found closer to chicken than turkey in the Galliformes order (Figure 2). These results are in agreement with a number of previous studies such as Wang et al. (2013). However, these results contradict the studies based on the retroposon insertion phylogeny and the chromosomal evolution study (Stock and Bunch, 1982; Shibusawa et al., 2004; Kaiser et al., 2007).

A total of 2,581 (43.7%) orthologs showed the support for topology t1, 1,674 (28.3%) orthologs showed the support for topology t2, 1,376 (23.3%) showed the support for topology t3, and 263 (4.4%) showed support for topology very different from t1, t2, and t3. The histogram for the RF distance from the topology t1, t2, and t3 is shown in Supplementary Figure S5. However, the categorization of these genes supporting different topologies based on their molecular function GO categories did not show any pattern of enrichment (Supplementary Figure S6). We observed that the maximum support is obtained for the t1 topology. A similar topology was reported by different studies using different kinds of data such nuclear regions, intronic regions, mitochondrial regions, and genome-wide sampled ultraconserved elements (Kimball and Braun, 2014; Sun et al., 2014; Hosner et al., 2015, 2017; Wang et al., 2017a). Although a recent report have shown that the data-type used for constructing the phylogeny may have a major impact on the tree estimate, and have observed that the phylogeny based on coding regions and non-coding regions were very different (Reddy et al., 2017), the most supported topology \u201ct1\u201d in this study is also supported by the phylogenies constructed using different types of data such as non-coding intron (Kimball and Braun, 2014), ultraconserved elements (Sun et al., 2014; Hosner et al., 2015, 2017; Wang et al., 2017a), and 3\u2032-untranslated regions (Bonilla et al., 2010).

Thus, the divergence point between flycatcher and zebra finch was derived from the species divergence time from TimeTree (Hedges et al., 2006). The phylogeny of the other birds used in this study is already well-resolved, and thus, the aim of this study was to resolve the phylogenetic position of Peacock in the Gallliformes order with respect to the other known genomes. The divergence time is derived from the TimeTree database (Hedges et al., 2006), where the divergence time of peacock and chicken is \u223c33 MYA, the divergence of turkey and common ancestor of peacock and chicken is \u223c37 MYA, divergence between duck and common ancestor of Galliformes bird species is \u223c78 MYA, and the divergence between zebra finch and flycatcher is \u223c44 MYA (Hedges et al., 2006). The early divergence of Galliformes and Anseriformes is supported by the studies where the origin of Galliformes and Anseriformes is reported to be during the period of Paleocene (Claramunt and Cracraft, 2015; Cracraft et al., 2015). This early divergence of Galliformes and Anseriformes is also supported by the Next-generation DNA sequencing data from 259 loci (Prum et al., 2015). The divergence time of peacock and chicken, and the divergence of the common ancestor of peacock and chicken with the turkey, was suggested to be during the period of Oligocene (\u223c23\u201335 MYA) based on fossil and DNA sequence (nuclear and mitochondrial) data (Wang et al., 2017b), which supports the divergence time from TimeTree. However, in a recent study based on four mitochondrial and six nuclear genes, the divergence of peacock and chicken was estimated to be \u223c25\u201330 MYA, which is slightly earlier than the TimeTree reported divergence time of \u223c33 MYA (Cai et al., 2018).",

We observed the same anomaly (finding the earliest divergence between the Passeriformes and all of the other birds) in our mitochondrial tree of 22 species that has been attributed to difficulties in analyzing the mitochondrial genomes (Braun and Kimball, 2002). In fact, this topology has also been observed previously with the mitochondrial genomes since late 1990\u2019s (Mindell et al., 1999). However, the RY-coding (A and G coded as R, C and T are coded as Y) has been shown to reduce the problem to some extent (Braun and Kimball, 2002; Slack et al., 2007). Thus, we have also constructed the mitochondrial phylogeny for these 22 species with RY-coding and Binary-coding (A and G are coded as 0, C and T are coded 1). The RY and Binary coded phylogenies are mentioned in the Supplementary Figures S7B,C. Both, the RY-coded and Binary-coded phylogenies, showed the earliest divergence between a clade that comprises Galloanseae as well as the only Palaeognathae included in our study and Neoaves (the remaining living birds). This topology is more consistent with the well-accepted modern bird phylogeny (Jarvis et al., 2014) that places the root of living birds between Palaeognathae and Neognathae (Galloanserae and Neoaves). Thus, in this study also, the RY or binary coding appear to better resolve the mitochondrial phylogeny as reported in earlier studies (Braun and Kimball, 2002; Slack et al., 2007).",

The phylogenetically corrected analysis is usually more preferred but could include only 5,907 orthologs, however, the pair-wise analysis allowed the inclusion of more than 9,000 orthologs for each species pair. Therefore, the phylogenetically corrected branch-specific \u03c9 or dN/dS values were derived for the concatenated alignments for each of the extant taxa and for the ancestral nodes in the phylogeny. The values were lower for chicken and peacock in comparison to the other extant bird genomes (Figure 2). Furthermore, the pair-wise \u03c9 or dN/dS values were estimated for the individual orthologous alignments. The genes were categorized into different KEGG categories, and the median value of \u03c9 or dN/dS was determined for each KEGG category (Supplementary Text S5). The distribution of the median values plotted for the different pairs showed that the categories involved in signal transduction and transcription regulation have evolved at a very different rate in peacock in comparison to other birds (Supplementary Figures S9\u2013S11).",

It is apparent that the common ancestor to the birds in the phylogenetic tree show a loss of 2,295 genes, which is also supported by a previous report mentioning the loss of around 2,000 genes in the ancestor as compared to other vertebrate lineages (Huang et al., 2013; Lovell et al., 2014). However, such observations needs further confirmation as they could arise as an artifact of poor genome coverage in the GC-rich regions and incomplete genome assemblies (Bornel\u00f6v et al., 2017), leading to an over or under-estimation of gene counts due to fragmentation of genes on multiple contigs and gaps in the assembly (Denton et al., 2014). We observed that contraction has been more prominent in comparison to expansion for the common ancestor of Galliformes and Anseriformes, and the same pattern has also been observed for turkey and duck (Figure 3B). These observations corroborates with the previous study (Huang et al., 2013). However, an opposite pattern of expansion in gene families was observed for peacock and chicken (Figure 3B). The top 20 protein families featuring gain and loss in the peacock genome are listed in Supplementary Datas S10, S11. Genes from different bird species belonging to these selected families are mentioned in Supplementary Table S1. All the top 20 families that showed contraction in peacock, belonged to the hypothetical protein family or had no known function. Whereas, among the top 20 categories that showed expansion in peacock, only one family had a known function (i.e., immune system development and regulation).",

Another interesting observation was that in several interacting protein pairs, both the interacting proteins showed sequence divergence in the peacock (Supplementary Text S9) hinting toward their similar evolution (Moyle et al., 1994). These protein pairs were majorly involved in early development pathways such as Wnt, BMP, and TGF-\u03b2 signaling, cell cycle regulation, DNA replication, GPCR signaling, and gene expression regulation (Supplementary Table S8).",

Among these pathways, the TGF-\u03b2 pathway is known to regulate the cartilage connective tissue development (Loveridge et al., 1993), and also functions as an activator of feather development in birds. In this pathway, TGFBR3 gene showed MSA, and TGF-\u03b23 preproprotein, TGFBRAP1, and TAB3 genes showed multiple unique substitutions. The Wnt signaling pathway is involved in development, regeneration, aging process (Brack et al., 2007; Klaus and Birchmeier, 2008), and also regulates the initial placement of feather buds and their consolidation within the feather field (Lim and Nusse, 2013). Multiple regulators of Wnt signaling such as WNT2, WIF1, and DKK2 genes had positively selected amino acid sites and showed signs of adaptive evolution. The WIF1 and DKK2 genes also harbored multiple unique substitutions. Furthermore, the DKK2 and WNT2 genes were found to be positively selected in peacock. APCDD1 gene, which is an inhibitor of Wnt signaling pathway, showed MSA. The Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling is involved in the development of skeletal muscles, bone and cartilage connective tissue (Nie et al., 2006; Nishimura et al., 2012), neurogenesis (Groppe et al., 2002), and feather formation and patterning. Multiple genes such as BRK-3, BMP5, BMP3, BMP10, and CRIM1, which are involved in the regulation of BMP pathways and the corresponding early development, showed unique substitutions that may affect their function in cellular pathways as compared to the other birds.",

However, the phylogenetic position of peacock using the complete genome-wide data including non-coding parts such as introns is yet to be resolved. The most significant results emerged from the adaptive sequence divergence analysis, where a major fraction of genes involved in early development and immune system showed multiple signs of adaptive evolution (Figure 4). Similarly, the genes involved in the early development of feathers showed signs of adaptive evolution in the feather-specific gene set. In addition, the adaptive divergence observed in the genes involved in bone morphogenesis and skeletal muscle development perhaps explain the large body dimensions, stronger legs and spurs, and the ability to take short flights despite of a long train. Taken together, the evolution in the early development genes emerges as a prominent factor for explaining the molecular basis of the phenotypic evolution for Indian peacock.",

In the case of peacock, the resistance to a new viral strain Massachusetts prototype like coronavirus, which is pathogenic to chicken and turkey, also appears to be a case of species-specific immunity (Sun et al., 2007). This could perhaps be attributed to the adaptive divergence observed in the components of the innate immune system (complement and pathogen recognition system), adaptive immune response (B and T cell development), and other genes responsible for the overall immune system development. Moreover, the adaptive evolution observed for immune genes in peacock also appears consistent with the predictions of Hamilton\u2013Zuk hypothesis (Hamilton and Zuk, 1982; Balenger and Zuk, 2014). Though the results were obtained from the comparative genomic analysis of peacock, some of the insights are applicable to the other related species in the pheasant group.",

Therefore, the results should be interpreted with care and the identified positively selected genes should be considered as the candidate genes. This problem is common in genome-wide analysis and some approaches to address the problem can inflate the false positives, whereas others may increase the rate of false negatives (Redelings, 2014; Tiley et al., 2018); that said, the inferences provided by such methodology are worthwhile and have clearly provided insights into peacock evolution.",
