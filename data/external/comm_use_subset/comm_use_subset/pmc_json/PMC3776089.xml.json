TCM has sustained a strong institutional basis in contemporary China, with large medical universities, specialized hospitals, purpose-built divisions within general hospitals, and private clinics around the country. Approximately 2,000 TCM companies produce plant-based and synthetic therapeutics in forms ranging from teas to pills. Systematic research efforts are underway to characterize TCM therapies using modern analytical chemistry instrumentation and to run formal clinical trials of TCM drugs (Li et al. 2008).",

If they became ill, the doctor returned part of the fee. In contemporary hospitals and TCM clinics, patients pay on a fee-for-service basis. Thanks to a concerted government effort to sustain TCM alongside Western medicine, some physicians employ both therapeutic approaches. In most hospitals, however, patients choose whether to be seen by a practitioner of TCM or of Western medicine. Physicians of either therapeutic direction routinely prescribe a combination of drugs as in the West and herbals or teas from the TCM materia medica. Hospital pharmacies stock TCM treatments alongside small molecule drugs. In addition, specialized TCM clinics can be found across the country at which people can build long-term relationships with their doctor, in contrast to crowded hospitals where patients typically must see the next available physician (Xu and Yang 2009).",

More complex or emergency cases were directed to the second tier of commune-based health clinics funded by local residents. A commune health clinic typically had 10 to 30 beds and one or two trained junior doctors. When more serious care was needed, patients were transferred to larger county or city hospitals; by the mid-1970s, each county in China operated a general hospital (Wen 1974).

The Cultural Revolution undermined medical services in the cities, especially when some senior physicians were branded as bourgeois counter-revolutionaries and many younger doctors were sent to rural areas. Medical education experienced significant setbacks when universities were closed for long periods. Broadly, health policy from the 1950s through the 1980s was characterized by a focus on meeting the basic health needs of peasants, soldiers, and workers. Healthcare was seen as an integral component of the communist system and important to the development of a collective Maoist Chinese identity. Private firms and market incentives were eliminated throughout the system, from hospitals to drug manufacturing (Yang 2010).",

Subsequent economic reforms in the 1980s ended the commune system and reduced foreign investment and trade restrictions (Meessen and Bloom 2007). In 1985, the ministry of health phased out support for barefoot doctors (Zhang and Unschuld 2008). Those able to pass qualifying examinations were now termed \u201crural doctors\u201d, while others were re-categorized as health workers or medical aides. Rural Chinese began to pay for care out of pocket, as was already common in cities. With policymakers focused on economic development and managing the introduction of market capitalism, healthcare was largely ignored and the Cooperative Medical Scheme collapsed (Zhang 1999; Liu et al. 2006). Between 1980 and 2000, out-of-pocket spending by individuals thus increased from 21 percent to 60 percent of all health expenditures (see Table 1). The government\u2019s share, by contrast, shrank from over 36 percent to 14 percent (Ministry of Health 2012a). Nevertheless, hospitals remained dominated by state ownership and government control. Few private clinics were opened.",

Physicians and trained medical personnel likewise moved to cities; in the space of fifteen years, township health centers across China lost nearly all of their qualified doctors (Gong and Wilkes 1997). As the economy grew at double-digit rates, a middle class emerged. However, few employers provided health insurance and only expatriates had access to private insurance. Even in cities, health insurance became rare, with a decline in the number of people covered during the 1990s that eventually bottomed out at 40 percent (Liu et al. 2000).",

A follow-up study by health economists found a 44 percent increase in the number of rural households living in poverty as a result of out-of-pocket medical spending (Liu et al. 2003). According to a national survey conducted in 2003, nearly 50 percent of Chinese reporting an illness did not seek outpatient care and 30 percent of those advised by a physician to be hospitalized did not do so; in both cases, the majority cited financial concerns as the primary reason (Yip and Mahal 2008).",

A series of pilot projects begun in 300 rural counties in 2003 subsequently evolved into the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) on the national level (Zhang et al. 2010). Restricted to rural participants, NCMS offers very basic subsidized insurance to households. At its origin, a typical insured member paid an annual contribution of 10 RMB ($1.60)b, with additional contributions by the central and local governments of 20 RMB each; premiums and coverage subsequently rose, though only modestly. Administration of NCMS and coverage decisions are the responsibility of local governments, who manage budgets by setting reimbursement limits. At present, coverage is limited to inpatient care and annual ceilings per patient are used to control expenditures. In 2012, the government set a common formula for coverage limits of eight times average annual farm income, but not less than 60,000 RMB ($9,600). NCMS operates on a local basis, and deductibles and copayments typically increase for treatment away from home (Brown and Theoharides 2009).",

The central government encouraged provinces to actively build membership through a baseline requirement of 80 percent participation for receipt of subsidies (You and Kobayashi 2009). While payment models such as capitation were used on an experimental basis in the early 2000s, fee-for-service emerged as the dominant approach by the end of the decade. Studies of NCMS have found that the utilization of services rose, but its implementation also increased out-of-pocket spending since insurance did not cover chronic disease care or most branded prescription drugs (Yip and Hsiao 2009; Wagstaff et al. 2007).",

The structure of healthcare expenditure varies internationally, but China stands out for prescription drugs taking up over 40 percent of all spending (compared to approximately 12 percent in other countries), while hospitalizations and outpatient care are far lower. As overall health spending in China rises, the mix of private spending on drugs and public spending on hospitals will undergo a shift.

The system instead relies heavily on baseline insurance under government programs and co-insurance by individuals out of their savings. Health economists have suggested that in an optimal co-insurance model, individuals are covered for unexpected or financially catastrophic disease, but do not pressure physicians for excess treatment since they must pay for it directly (Ma and McGuire 1997; Eggleston 2000). In China, however, out-of-pocket spending is extremely high and contributes to a world-leading savings rate. In effect, the Chinese are deferring present consumption out of concern for future medical bills. Proposals for new government-backed catastrophic plans seek to create a broader redistribution system. Under this scenario, China will have public insurance at the top and bottom of the cost scale, and out-of-pocket or private insurance for the middle. However, that development may severely constrain the development of private insurance by making it too difficult for insurers to create profitable patient pools. Catastrophic insurance also may drive up costs as procedures price at or above the coverage baseline.",

For insurers to expand and sell price-differentiated plans, clinics need to offer high-quality services covered by the insurance. Public hospitals, which bill patients at government-set prices at the point of service are not equipped to handle post-hoc private insurance reimbursement. But investors need to be convinced of the viability of private insurance plans in order to underwrite new private clinics. An integrated insurance and care delivery model could break through this dilemma only if it simultaneously recruits respected physicians and a broad enough pool of customers that pay annual insurance premiums. If private insurance develops in this manner, it will reduce some of the pressure on the public system but raise tensions concerning inequality of access to top care facilities and providers.",

Alternatively, a fully free-market system might better reward physicians and promote innovation, but at the expense of universal insurance and access.
