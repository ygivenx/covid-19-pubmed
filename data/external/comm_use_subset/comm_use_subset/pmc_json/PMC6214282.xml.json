Given a graph G=(V,E) with weight function w:E\u2192\u211c+, the goal of community detection (or graph clustering) is to partition the vertex set V into an arbitrary number of disjoint subsets of V called communities (or clusters) such that the vertices within a community are tightly connected with each other but sparsely connected with the rest of the graph. Clustering on G can be represented as C(G), which is a unique mapping of each vertex to a community. We restrict our work here to undirected, unweighted graphs and to the disjoint partitioning of vertices into communities. For a detailed treatment of this topic, the reader is referred to the work by Fortunato (2010).",

The inherently dynamic nature of such data (Fenn et al. 2012) leads to dynamic graph representations. A dynamic graph changes over time through the addition and deletion of vertices and edges. A snapshot of this graph, Gn, consists of the vertices and edges that are active at a given time step n. Modifications from time n to n+1 are represented by \u0394Gn. Clustering can be performed at each time step, C(Gn), and as the graph evolves, so do its communities. Temporal communities can undergo several different transitions: growth via addition of new vertices, contraction via deletion of vertices, merging of two or more communities, splitting of a community into two or more communities, birth and death of a community, and resurgence or reappearance of a community after a period of time. Efficiently detecting these transitions is a challenging problem.",

Current approaches for dynamic community detection broadly fall under two headings: incremental community detection and global community detection. The approaches in the first category focus on the systematic propagation of communities through time, whereas the approaches in the second category attempt to simultaneously optimize for multiple metrics on several snapshots of data. Stability of computation and accuracy of results are the fundamental limitations of the incremental approaches, while memory (space) and computational requirements are the main limitations of the global approaches (Cazabet and Amblard 2014). Incremental approaches are fundamentally combinatorial in nature (Tantipathananandh and Berger-Wolf 2011; Nguyen et al. 2014) and involve methods to track communities through time. The stochastic nature of these algorithms makes these methods unstable leading to inaccurate results. Mucha et al. (2010) build on the seminal work of Lambiotte et al. (2014) for community detection in dynamic multiplex networks by specializing null models in terms of stability under Laplacian dynamics.",

The challenge is to develop methods that vary continuously in time, like the graphs themselves, between snapshots. Moreover, if existing methods are extended through time, it will be beneficial to do so in a way that provides new insight or analytical tools as well. With that in mind, we propose a Riemannian geometry approach that views dynamic graphs (and thus dynamic communities) through the lens of Laplacian dynamics on a matrix manifold. Riemannian geometry provides ways of calculating quantities such as distances between Laplacians and trajectory speeds on the matrix manifold. As such, it provides a clear and consistent way of representing graph dynamics. This framework is also modular with respect to existing static community detection methods.",

We use Riemannian geometry to interpolate between snapshots of dynamic graphs (using geodesics) and to calculate averages of those snapshots; we explicitly show the formulae for performing these calculations. The interpolated and average graphs are then amenable to existing static community detection methods. This allows us to use a consistent approach to track community behaviour both between snapshots, via interpolation, and across snapshots, via averaging.",

Consider a flight from Vancouver, Canada to London, England: the two cities are at similar latitudes, so on a Mercator projection map, the shortest flight would seem to be a straight West-to-East trajectory. In reality, however, flights between the two cities traverse the Pole because that is a shorter route \u2013 it is the great circle route. The discrepancy is due to the curvature of the Earth, which is distorted on a flat map.

Pennec et al. (2006) developed a metric for the manifold of symmetric positive-definite matrices with corresponding expressions for distances, geodesics, and tangent vector inner products in closed form. These formulae are valuable because even when there is a well-defined metric on a manifold, distances and geodesics between points do not usually have closed-form expressions. Such quantities have to be solved for numerically.

Secondly, directed graphs do not have symmetric Laplacians, and thus they cannot be considered within this framework without symmetrizing them somehow (e.g., by ignoring the directionality of edges). For the purpose of community detection, though, edge direction may not be important.",

For the trajectory L(t) on that manifold, though, the trajectory speed is not constant, the trajectory direction is not constant, and it is not the shortest path from LA to LB. It is precisely analogous to the Mercator projection map example given earlier \u2013 moving at a constant velocity (i.e., constant speed and direction) on the map would not correspond to moving at a constant velocity on the earth because of the earth\u2019s curvature. Experimentally, we have observed that the linear interpolation begins and ends its trajectory moving very quickly while the bulk of its trajectory moves relatively slowly. The difference between maximum and minimum velocities can be orders of magnitude, depending on the size of the graph and the distance between the two graphs being interpolated.",

If the two points are far enough apart, this product will go through a maximum between the two points. This maximum can, again, be orders of magnitude greater than the product at either endpoint; like the trajectory velocity, this variation will depend on the size of the graphs in question and their distance apart. The geodesic interpolation, however, provides a linear variation in the product of the eigenvalues. Pennec et al. (2006) comment on this in more detail. For a graph, this product relates directly, by Kirchoff\u2019s matrix tree theorem, to the number of spanning trees in the graph (Harris et al. 2008). In other words, the linear interpolation increases the overall connectivity of the graph between snapshots.",

With these metrics, matrices with zero or infinite eigenvalues essentially exist at infinity. For matrices with finite eigenvalues greater than zero, the distances between matrices are relative and directly tied to the matrices\u2019 spectra. For example, the distance from \u03bb=10\u22126 to \u03bb=10\u22125 is comparable to the distance from \u03bb=1 to \u03bb=10. This means that a geodesic, which is a minimum-distance path between points, will not significantly alter the part of the spectrum associated with \u03bb=\u03b5 values unless it is absolutely necessary to do so in order to reach the destination.

As we increased \u03b5, though, we found that the geodesic interpolations approached the trajectory of the linear interpolation; at, say, \u03b5=106, they were almost identical. This, too, makes sense: as the eigenvalues become uniformly larger, the manifold becomes flatter, and the differences between the data points become smaller. The flatter the manifold, the closer the geodesic is to the linear interpolation. However, the geodesic interpolation is still guaranteed to remain positive definite, and the linear interpolation is not. This suggests that if the linear interpolation were more desirable in a particular application but the application also called for the use of extrapolation, then using a geodesic with a large bias term could provide the desired capabilities.",

Thresholding produced better results. Generally speaking, the AI geodesic produced too many communities while the linear interpolation produced too few, and neither produced a steady deformation from one data point to the next. The LE geodesic showed an intermediate behaviour in this regard, and a threshold of 0.02 produced best performance. The number of communities produced by the interpolation did not vary smoothly, but there was a general progression from data point to data point. Changing the threshold value had a small effect on the AI geodesic, but it did nothing to improve the linear interpolation, and using a threshold value of 0.5 actually produced an odd spike in the number of communities halfway between data points.

Using a larger bias value to more closely approximate a linear interpolation may ameliorate the problem, but it would be valuable to look in more detail at why these transients occur and how to interpret them from a graph theoretic perspective. For example, does it make sense to say that the \u2018shortest\u2019 or \u2018least energetic\u2019 path from one graph snapshot to another might involve some transient edges?

However, one of the error terms disappears for the AI geodesic interpolation; all other things being equal, it is reasonable to expect that the error on the geodesic interpolation will be, at the very least, less variable than the error on the entry-wise linear interpolation. For extrapolation, the error estimate is no longer relevant for the entry-wise linear method because such an extrapolation is not guaranteed to remain positive-semidefinite. However, the error on the AI geodesic extrapolation is well-defined by the remainder formula in Taylor\u2019s theorem.
