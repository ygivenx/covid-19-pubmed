            "text": "Cypoviruses (CPVs) belong to the family Reoviridae (genus Cypovirus) and typically have genomes comprising 10\u201311 double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) segments [1,2]. The icosahedral virions are embedded within a characteristic crystalline occlusion body (OB), which is formed by the polyhedrin protein encoded by the viral genome [3,4]. In the highly alkaline environment of the midgut, the OBs are cleaved to release virions which can infect midgut epithelial cells, resulting in delayed growth and even death of the infected larvae. During the period of illness and disease, the virus is continuously excreted in the feces and infects other healthy insects. CPV can also be passed on to the next generation of insects, contributing to a viral epidemic in the pest population [5]. Dendrolimus punctatus cypovirus (DpCPV) is a pathogen of D. punctatus and is considered the most destructive pest of pine forests worldwide [6]. DpCPV can infect 35 insect species spanning 10 Lepidoptera families [6]. This species has been applied in commercial insecticides to control the pine caterpillar, D. punctatus, since 1970 in Japan [7] and since 2010 in China [8].",

            "text": "Previously, a temperature-sensitive reovirus strain was rescued using an RNA-based reverse genetics system and rotaviruses bearing engineered changes in the viral attachment proteins were isolated using a partially plasmid-based reverse genetics system. Only one or two rotavirus genomic fragments could be replaced with other viral genes from different species [19]. In 2007, Kobayashi et al. developed an entirely plasmid-based reverse genetics system for animal double-stranded RNA viruses by co-transfecting murine L929 fibroblast cells with 10 plasmids encoding gene segments of mammalian orthoreovirus cDNAs flanked by the T7 RNA promoter and hepatitis delta virus ribozyme sequence (HDV Rib) and a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing T7 polymerase [20]. Several years later, an improved reverse genetics system for mammalian orthoreoviruses was developed by cloning the cDNAs encoding multiple reovirus genome segments into a few plasmids, reducing the number of recombinant vectors required from 10 to 4 and improving the efficiency of virus recovery [21]. Subsequently, other reoviruses, such as rotavirus [22] and bluetongue virus [23], were successfully recovered using a similar approach. Recently, it has been demonstrated that rotavirus can be rescued by overexpression of some viral genes without the need for a helper plasmid [24]. An RNA-based reverse genetics system for BmCPV was developed by co-transfection of cultured BmN cells with in vitro-transcribed S1\u2013S10 RNA segments [25].",

The linear pFD-PPH-T7pol segments were PCR-amplified with primers F-pFD-delp10 annealing upstream of the p10 promoter and R-pFD-delp10 (Table 1) annealing at the HSV TK poly(A) signal to delete the p10 promoter and the multiple cloning site. The T7pro-mCherry segments were PCR-amplified from the pFD-VP39-mCherry plasmid using primers F-T7pro-mCherry and R-mCherry (Table 1) bearing 16-bp homologous fragments of pFD-PPH-T7pol at both ends. The pFD-PPH-T7pol-PT7-mCherry vector was obtained by transforming competent Escherichia coli HST08 cells with a mixture of the vector and insert using the FastCloning method [27]. Briefly, the vector and insert were PCR-amplified with 16-base terminal overlapping sequences. After digesting the mixture of amplified vector and insert with DpnI to eliminate the DNA template used in the PCR reaction, competent cells were directly transformed with the mixture. The AcBac-PPH-T7pol-PT7-mCherry was obtained by transforming DH10B competent cells harboring the pMON7124 helper plasmid and the AcBacmid bMON14272 with the pFD-PPH-T7pol-PT7-mCherry plasmid via the Bac-to-Bac\u00ae Baculovirus Expression System (Invitrogen). The bacterial cells were cultured (37 \u00b0C, 225 rpm, 4 h), after which they were serially diluted 10-fold (10\u22121, 10\u22122, and 10\u22123) in SOC medium (0.5% yeast extract, 2% tryptone, 10 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM MgSO4, 20 mM glucose), and 50 \u03bcL of each dilution was plated onto an LB agar plate containing 50 \u03bcg/mL kanamycin, 7 \u03bcg/mL gentamicin, 10 \u03bcg/mL tetracycline, 100 \u03bcg/mL X-gal, and 40 \u03bcg/mL IPTG. White colonies were picked from the plate, re-streaked on fresh LB agar plates, and incubated for 48 h at 37 \u00b0C. The plates were then incubated overnight at 37 \u00b0C. Next, a single clone was picked, inoculated in liquid culture, and grown overnight. The resulting AcBac-PPH-T7pol-PT7-mCherry bacmid was isolated according to the Bac-to-Bac\u00ae Baculovirus Expression System protocol (Invitrogen).",

Initially we tried to construct an insect cell line that stably expressed T7 polymerase, but due to the large size of the protein, we found that it could not be fully transcribed and expressed by several promoters (e.g., OpIE-1 [36], OpIE-2 [37], Drosophila metallothionein [38], Densoviral P9 [39]). Therefore, a helper virus like the recombinant vaccinia virus was adapted for expression of T7 polymerase. After transfection of Sf9 cells with AcBac-PPH-T7pol-PT7-mCherry and infection with helper virus, the red fluorescence indicated that T7 polymerase could be expressed under the polyhedrin promoter, indicating that it might recognize and initiate transcription of reporter genes in Sf9 cells (Figure 1B). In reverse genetics systems using recombinant vaccinia virus as a helper virus, the helper virus can be removed from the rescued virus by differential temperature sensitivity or cellular tropism. It has been reported that the vp80-knockout bacmid does not produce infectious baculoviruses, and does not affect expression of exogenous genes [34]. Thus, we utilized AcBac-T7pol-\u0394vp80 to express the T7 polymerase to diminish the effects of the baculovirus (Figure 2A). Using FastCloning technology, 10 DpCPV cDNA fragments were constructed in three vectors (Figure 3). DpCPVs were rescued by co-transfecting Sf9 cells with the vectors and AcBac-T7pol-\u0394vp80. By morphological comparison and detection of genetic markers, we have developed a robust and efficient reverse genetics system for DpCPV (Figure 5).",

In this system, the LC50s (95% CI) of DpCPV-WT and rDpCPV viruses were 2.47 (0.97\u20138.06) and 25.7 (7.6\u201375.3) \u00d7 106 OBs/mL, which is in accord with the rescued RNA viruses mentioned above.

According to the RT-qPCR and TEM results, there was no significant difference in the copy numbers of viral nucleic acids (Figure 6B) and the ratio of solid particles (Table 3) among the rescued and wild-type viruses, indicating that rDpCPVs contain the same genomic sequences as the wild-type DpCPV, while its virulence is much lower than that of wild-type DpCPV. For rDpCPV and rDpCPV-S9M, the mutation of S9 to S9M in the ORF region did not affect genome assembly. Through RNA structure prediction, we found that the S9M caused a structural change of the RNA segment, which may have caused the decline in virulence. We speculate that this structural region may be involved in some viral processes, but the specific mechanisms need further study. Though the virulence of rDpCPV-S9M was lower than that of rDpCPV, the S9M null-mutation was used to confirm the rescue system worked correctly, did not contaminated by wild-type DpCPV.",

The DpCPV genome consists of 10 dsRNA segments, while the capsid contains 12 turrets, and thus we speculated that the capsid could accommodate more foreign genes. When T-S10UTR-egfp was added to the transfected mixture, co-localization of green fluorescence and OBs was observed in transfected Sf9 cells by fluorescence microscopy (Figure 5B). However, no green fluorescence was observed in OBs purified from the midguts of S. exigua larvae. The assembly of CPV particles may adapt a precise mechanism, thus it was not proposed that the exogenous EGFP might be incorporated into virions or OBs. We speculate that the egfp RNA was encapsulated in the virions as an extra fragment and that the gene could be expressed in Sf9 cells. The RT-qPCR results showed that some of the egfp genetic material was indeed encapsulated into rDpCPV-egfp particles, whereas not every rDpCPV virion encapsulated an additional gene. The ratio of the egfp to S2 gene RNA segment copy number in rDpCPV-P1 was 14.37%, indicating that virions containing egfp accounted for 14.37% of the total, and this ratio decreased significantly in successive passages. We speculate that this reduction was due to the lack of resistance screening during passages. There was no significant difference in the copy number of the S10 gene between rDpCPV from P1 to P3 (Figure 5C). Though the untranslated regions (UTRs) of T-S10UTR-egfp and S10 were identical, they were not competitively encapsulated in virions. The UTRs of rotaviruses have been shown to be key regions for recognition of viral genes packaged into virions [41]. When we replaced the ORF regions of S1\u2013S10 with the egfp gene, we found that the predicted RNA structure of the UTR region did not change when the S2 and S10 ORF regions were replaced (Figure S2). When the ORF region of the S2 gene was replaced with the egfp gene, co-localization of OBs and green fluorescence could also be observed in cells. The plasmids where egfp replaced the ORF region of the other DpCPV fragments were constructed and performed similarly in co-transfections. However, although OBs could be observed for the S7 and S9 substitution, no co-localization of green fluorescence and OBs was observed (Figure S3).",

Images were obtained by fluorescence microscopy with 488-nm light excitation at 7 days post-transfection. OBs were observed, and some OBs co-localized with green fluorescence. Scale bars, 10 \u03bcm. (C) The rDpCPV-egfp successively infected S. exigua larvae for three generations and the copy numbers of the S2, S9, S10 and egfp genes in equivalent numbers of OBs were determined by RT-qPCR. With passaging, there was no significant change in the copy numbers of the S2, S9 and S10 genes, while the copy number of egfp in the P2 and P3 generations was significantly lower than in the P1 generation (NS indicates p > 0.05, *** indicates p < 0.001, Tukey\u2019s multiple comparison post F test).",

(A) S. exigua larvae were infected with different concentrations of DpCPV-WT, rDpCPV, rDpCPV-S9M and rDpCPV-egfp. Mortality induced by viruses was related to the concentrations used for inoculation. The virulence of DpCPV-WT and rDpCPV was greater than that of rDpCPV-S9M and rDpCPV-egfp in which S9 was replaced with S9M. (B) The S2, S9 and S10 gene copy numbers in equivalent numbers of OBs of different DpCPVs were determined by RT-qPCR. There was no significant change in the copy numbers of the S2, S9 and S10 genes between DpCPV-WT and recombinant DpCPVs (NS indicates p > 0.05, F test).",
