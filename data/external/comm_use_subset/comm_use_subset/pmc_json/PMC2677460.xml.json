The response is initiated when pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), present in microbial proteins or RNAs, engage cellular pathogen-recognition receptors (PRRs) such as RIG-I, MDA5, or the toll-like receptors [1]. Upon engagement, these PRRs activate proteins such as IRF3, IRF7, and NF-\u03baB, which translocate to the nucleus and induce the type I interferon (IFN) response [2]. Type I IFNs in turn induce the expression of numerous IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), including IFN\u03b3, interleukin (IL)-6, and the dsRNA-activated protein kinase, PKR [3]. Downstream targets of PKR include the \u03b1 subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2\u03b1), NF-\u03baB, and additional ISGs [4]\u2013[6], thus amplifying the IFN response via a positive feedback mechanism.",

The activation of P58IPK results in reduced levels of PKR-mediated eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, which has long been thought to benefit influenza virus by maintaining a high rate of viral protein translation [8],[9]. P58IPK is also activated at the transcriptional level in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. During ER stress, P58IPK inhibits another eIF2\u03b1 kinase, PERK, which functions to regulate protein synthesis during the unfolded protein response [10],[11]. P58IPK also plays a larger role in the protein processing efficiency of the ER by binding to misfolded proteins and acting as a co-chaperone [12]\u2013[14].",

This effect was due to P58IPK functioning through a PKR-dependent mechanism that is independent of PERK. We also showed that P58IPK functions similarly during infection with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) or reovirus. These findings again suggested that influenza virus benefits from P58IPK activation, presumably to the detriment of the host.",

To this end, we infected mice lacking P58IPK with either the mouse-adapted A/PR/8/34 (PR8) strain or the reconstructed 1918 (r1918) pandemic influenza virus. We then examined viral replication, lung pathology, PKR and eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, cytokine expression, and global gene transcriptional profiles. We found that influenza virus infections were more lethal in mice lacking P58IPK, due to increased lung pathology and inflammation. Therefore, just as P58IPK plays a role in restoring homeostasis during ER stress through its interaction with PERK, P58IPK may function during virus infection to restore homeostasis during the antiviral and inflammatory response through its interaction with PKR. Our findings suggest that P58IPK represents a new class of molecule that is activated during virus infection to help regulate the host antiviral response. While a number of host proteins exist which are crucial in determining the antiviral response, P58IPK is the first to be identified in a mammalian system which inhibits the defense response for proper development of the antiviral state. We coin this new class of regulators \u201cCellular Inhibitors of the Host Defense\u201d (CIHDs).",

Although P58IPK\u2212/\u2212 and wild-type mice exhibited similar weight loss (morbidity) over time (data not shown), mortality was markedly increased in P58IPK\u2212/\u2212 mice. This phenotype was particularly pronounced at lower infectious doses (Figure 1A). When infected with 102 PFU, all P58IPK\u2212/\u2212 mice died by day 5, whereas only 33% of wild-type mice died by day 6, and the others recovered. This corresponded to a fifty percent lethal dose (LD50) of 101.3 PFU for P58IPK\u2212/\u2212 mice and 102.0 PFU for wild-type mice. The increased mortality in P58IPK\u2212/\u2212 mice was not due to increased viral load, since viral titers in the lungs of all infected mice were similar at each time point (Figure 1B). Furthermore, mortality was not caused by viral attachment or initial infection alone, since experiments with a replication-deficient virus (PR8\u0394NS1) [15] did not produce disease in either mouse genotype (data not shown).",

This was marked by moderate to severe alveolitis and peribronchiolitis, macrophage and neutrophil infiltration, and associated hemorrhage and edema (Figure 2A). By contrast, wild-type mice had mild alveolitis and peribronchiolitis with lower levels of neutrophils, where infiltration of inflammatory cells is scant (Figure 2B). Alveolitis was observed as early as day 1 post infection in P58IPK\u2212/\u2212 mice and inflammation increased in severity until day 5 (Figure S1). Other histological features which were more pronounced in P58IPK\u2212/\u2212 mice were multifocal intraluminal inflammation with necrotic debris and the formation of hyaline membranes adjacent to alveolar walls (Figure 2C\u2013D).

Therefore, to determine if apoptosis was induced in the lungs of P58IPK\u2212/\u2212 mice, we looked for the presence of cleaved caspase 3. Caspase 3 is downstream of cleaved caspase 8, and it cleaves other caspases as well as poly(ADP) ribose polymerase [18]. This analysis revealed increased staining of cleaved caspase 3 in the lungs of P58IPK\u2212/\u2212 mice compared with that detected in wild-type mice (Figure 2I\u2013J), but no cleaved caspase 3 was observed in the lungs of mock-infected animals (Figure S4). Increased apoptosis in the lungs of P58IPK\u2212/\u2212 mice is consistent with our previous findings that P58IPK has anti-apoptotic properties [19]. Our observation of increased apoptosis and mortality in mice lacking P58IPK is also consistent with previous reports of increased apoptosis being a marker for fatal influenza virus infection [20].",

In addition, GSEA indicated that the GO categories were significantly perturbed, even if the genes within the categories were not highly regulated.

Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), we found that IL-6 levels were increased in the lungs of P58IPK\u2212/\u2212 mice compared with wild-type animals throughout the course of infection (Figure 5A). Furthermore, we detected increased levels of IL-6 in the serum of infected P58IPK\u2212/\u2212 mice at day 5 post infection (Figure 5B). This increase in IL-6 protein in the serum and lungs of infected P58IPK\u2212/\u2212 mice was accompanied by a drastic increase in IL-6 mRNA. (Figure 5C). Furthermore, levels of IFN\u03b2 mRNA were significantly increased in the lungs of P58IPK\u2212/\u2212 mice at day 3 post infection (Figure 5D). IFN\u03b2 induction results in the increased production of IL-6 [29], and together, the expression of these two cytokines suggests that a greater IFN and cytokine response contributes to the increased lung pathology and higher mortality rate associated with influenza virus infection of P58IPK\u2212/\u2212 mice.",

We began our analysis by comparing lung gene expression profiles of r1918-infected and mock-infected P58IPK\u2212/\u2212 mice and selecting for genes that were expressed at a higher level during virus infection. We then determined which genes among this group were expressed at a lower level in r1918-infected wild-type mice. Because these genes were induced in P58IPK\u2212/\u2212 mice in response to virus infection, but were expressed at a lower level in virus-infected wild-type mice, the infection-induced expression of these genes appears to be impacted by the presence or absence of P58IPK.",

Of the annotated genes in this set, 65 were also present in the final set of genes identified from the r1918 virus infection data. The majority of these genes (47 of 65) are associated with inflammatory, immune response, and cell-death pathways and their expression patterns in P58IPK\u2212/\u2212 and wild-type mice are shown in Figure 7A. Because these genes were all expressed at a higher level in P58IPK\u2212/\u2212 mice, they may therefore be associated with the increased pathology and mortality rate observed in these animals. However, of particular interest are the set of genes present in the middle panel of this Figure, which were induced in P58IPK\u2212/\u2212 mice in response to infection with either PR8 or r1918, but which were induced in wild-type mice only in response to the r1918 virus. To evaluate the functional relationships of these genes more closely, we used Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) to create a network of the set of genes in the middle of Figure 7A, showing direct or indirect interactions reported for these cell-death- and inflammatory-response-related genes (Figure 7B). The network is centered around tumor necrosis factor (Tnf), which is interesting because activation of Tnf-related pathways has been shown to be associated with H5N1 influenza viral infections of macrophages [31]. This pattern of expression suggests that these genes may also contribute to the exceptional virulence of the r1918 virus, but, more importantly, they may contribute to the virus' exceptional virulence in animals lacking P58IPK.",

Here, we have specifically shown, through detailed high-throughput and biochemical analysis, how P58IPK may protect the host during influenza virus infection. In previous reports, we demonstrated that P58IPK is activated upon infection with influenza virus [32] and that P58IPK binds to and inhibits PKR [7],[33]. We also showed that cells devoid of P58IPK exhibit higher levels PKR activation and eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, yet lower levels of viral mRNA translation during influenza virus infection [8]. Together, these results suggest that P58IPK activation is required for more efficient influenza virus replication in vitro and that the virus usurps P58IPK activation to the detriment of the host. However, our current study has expanded and changed our understanding of how the activation of P58IPK impacts viral replication since we have now shown that the absence of P58IPK did not affect levels of viral load in vivo, although we did not examine rates of viral replication. Nevertheless, influenza virus infection in P58IPK\u2212/\u2212 mice resulted in increased mortality due to a heightened inflammatory response marked by increased lung pathology and apoptosis. Furthermore, at the lowest doses of influenza virus, wild-type mice recovered from infection, suggesting that P58IPK benefits the host during infection.",

A model describing these results is presented in Figure 8, which is divided into two categories: the apoptotic and inflammatory responses. P58IPK functions through each via its inhibition of PKR. P58IPK inhibits the apoptotic response via its inhibition of PKR-mediated caspase activation and eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation. P58IPK also inhibits the inflammatory response via its inhibition of PKR-mediated NF-\u03baB activation, which ultimately activates IFN-stimulated genes. Therefore, P58IPK is necessary to counterbalance the activities of PKR, and together, the over-activation of pathways downstream of PKR results in increased host pathology and mortality [20],[28]. While our analysis revealed that neither PERK nor its downstream targets were activated during influenza virus infection, we regard these negative results as inconclusive due to the difficultly in performing these experiments, especially with regard to sample preparation [34]. Since influenza virus hemagglutinin has been shown to cause ER stress [35], we are performing experiments with more sensitive assays to look for markers of ER stress in influenza virus-infected mice.",

Although a definite connection between PKR and FADD-mediated caspase 8 activation remains to be determined, apoptosis is induced by the over-expression of PKR [38]. Additionally, caspase 8 activation results in caspase 3 activation, resulting in apoptosis [39]. Fas ligand (FasL), Tnf, and caspases 1 and 7, which activate caspases 8 and 3 [40]\u2013[43], were identified in our microarray analysis as being more up-regulated in P58IPK\u2212/\u2212 mice during influenza virus infection. We also previously demonstrated that P58IPK is anti-apoptotic, as nude mice injected with cells over-expressing P58IPK undergo malignant transformation [19]. Finally, P58IPK\u2212/\u2212 mice, which have basal levels of ER stress [12],[13], exhibit increased caspase 3 activation and apoptosis of \u03b2-cells in the pancreas [44]. We have now shown that the stimulus of influenza virus infection in lung tissue contributes to increased apoptosis in the absence of P58IPK. This was marked by increased and prolonged eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation [21] and increased caspase 3 activation in the lungs of these mice.",

Each of the downstream NF-\u03baB responses shown in Figure 8, among many others, was up-regulated in P58IPK\u2212/\u2212 mice as compared with wild-type mice. Again, this is likely due to uncontrolled activation of PKR in the absence of P58IPK. Treatment of bronchial epithelial cells with dsRNA activates both PKR and NF-\u03baB, which results in the secretion of pro-inflammatory interleukins and chemokines [47]. This response could lead to increased lung pathogenesis during a viral infection, which was a striking difference between influenza virus-infected P58IPK\u2212/\u2212 and wild-type mice. While only one lung lobe was analyzed for each mouse, and neither step sectioning nor bronchoalveolar lavages were performed, pathogenesis in P58IPK\u2212/\u2212 mice was marked by increased macrophage infiltration and hyaline membrane formation. Hyaline membranes obstruct the exchange of oxygen across the alveolar walls and is characteristic of diffuse alveolar damage [48]. It is also a characteristic sign of lethal influenza virus infections in cynomolgus monkeys [49]. In culture, influenza virus infection of macrophages stimulates the release of IL-6 [50], and we observed an increase in IL-6 mRNA and protein levels in the lungs of virus-infected P58IPK\u2212/\u2212 mice due to increased macrophage infiltration in the lungs of these animals. Increased levels of IL-6 have also been associated with fatal influenza virus infections [51],[52], which is consistent with the increased mortality observed in P58IPK\u2212/\u2212 mice. This is especially significant because it was at day 5 post infection, when IL-6 levels were highest, that mice lacking P58IPK died from infection. IFN\u03b2 expression has been shown to be correlated with IL-6 expression during influenza virus infection and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus infection [53],[54], and IFN\u03b2 expression was also elevated in influenza virus-infected P58IPK\u2212/\u2212 mice.",

            "text": "Antiviral and inflammatory responses are typically necessary to clear the virus and to recover from infection [55]. However, during infection with a virus such as Ebola virus, the marked over-expression of genes associated with the immune and inflammatory response may contribute to disease pathology and death [56],[57]. We have also shown that infection of mice or macaques with H5N1 avian influenza viruses, or the 1918 pandemic virus, results in rapid disease and death, most likely due to an early and dysregulated host inflammatory response, which is associated with severe lung disease and mortality [22],[31],[52],[58],[59]. Our current genomic profiling data suggest a similar phenomenon is occurring in P58IPK\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with influenza virus, where the significant expression of immune response-related genes at 1 day post infection was correlated with eventual death of the animal. In contrast, the expression profiles from wild-type mice exhibited increased expression of inflammatory response genes, but not until later times post infection, which was correlated with prolonged survival. Not only did these observations hold for the mouse-adapted PR8 virus, but also for the human 1918 pandemic strain. This is noteworthy, because two strains of influenza virus, each with different species specificity, produced the same disease phenotype in P58IPK\u2212/\u2212 mice via the same pathway. Furthermore, we identified a subset of genes, focused largely around Tnf and matrix metallopeptidase 3 (Mmp3), which were up-regulated in wild-type mice only during r1918 infection and not PR8 infection. Although it has been shown that Tnf activation increases the expression of Mmp3 [60], and that matrix metallopeptidases are up-regulated in airway epithelium disease in which macrophages and eosinophils are highly present [61], it has not previously been shown that Mmp3 activation is a function of influenza virus infection. This suggests that even by 1 day post infection, lung cells are undergoing a remodeling process which will ultimately lead to pathogenesis and mortality, by a potentially novel pathway, during pandemic influenza virus infection.",

            "text": "Together, our results show that P58IPK plays an important role in regulating the innate immune response, as its presence results in a more controlled response to influenza virus infection. While P58IPK benefits the host through reduced lung pathology and prolonged survival, it also provides the virus with additional time to replicate and spread among other hosts. The results of our study are therefore somewhat different than those observed in plant virus infection models, where plants lacking P58IPK also exhibited increased host death. Since plants lacking P58IPK exhibited lower levels of viral replication, it was concluded that P58IPK is required for virulence and acts a susceptibility factor [9]. However, unlike animals, plants do not invoke cell death as part of their immune response to virus infection. Since we have shown that in wild-type mice P58IPK functions to modulate the innate immune, inflammatory, and cell death responses during viral infection, resulting in decreased pathology and a lower mortality rate, activation of mammalian P58IPK actually functions to reduce the virulence of influenza virus infection. Thus, we have identified P58IPK as a new class of molecule that is activated during virus infection to inhibit the over-activation of inflammatory and cell death responses in order to prolong host survival. Further studies as to how to modulate the P58IPK pathway, and thus the host's antiviral and inflammatory response, may lead to the discovery of novel therapeutics for targeted intervention during a pandemic influenza virus infection.",
