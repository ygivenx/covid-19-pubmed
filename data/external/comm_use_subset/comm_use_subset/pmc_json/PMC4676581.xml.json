Studies have shown that type A and B viruses co\u2013circulate in the same area during epidemic periods and have various patterns of predominance [25\u201328]. However, the prevalence of each type may shift yearly and can vary among different communities [28\u201330]. Our analysis showed that type A was the predominant serotype accounting for 63.1% of all RSV infections. However, it is difficult to know how the sero\u2013epidemiological trend changed in the recent years in China. This is because the study periods and locations varied substantially among included studies.",

In our study, only 42 studies presented detailed criteria for case\u2013definition. In addition, only 54 out of the 135 included studies used immunofluorescence for RSV detection. RSV was identified less frequently (17.0%) if only the results of studies based on immunofluorescent detection were included. In comparison with immunofluorescence, molecular diagnostics are more sensitive and specific [31,32]. In recent years, the introduction of nucleic acid based diagnostic tests has markedly improved our understanding of viral etiology among ARTI patients [33]. Therefore, the real burden of RSV in China is likely to be higher than our findings if more sensitive diagnostic methods are used.",

Therefore, a random effects model was applied to take into account the heterogeneity between studies resulting in wider 95% CIs with more conservative estimates of the overall results [34]. In addition, the etiology data in the present study should be interpreted with caution. This is because restricting RSV to the title and abstract in the search criteria is a potential source of bias and might not be representative of all studies reporting other viruses. However, all included studies in current review tested for multiple viruses. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the use of correct denominator and numerators allow us to present the useful and informative etiology data available in these studies.",
