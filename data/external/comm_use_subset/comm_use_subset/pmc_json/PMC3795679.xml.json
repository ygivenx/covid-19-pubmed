Following infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), patients develop acute hepatitis, which may progress to fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) in a small number of patients or chronic end stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) depending on age of infection and immune status of the host [2]\u2013[3]. Although conventional treatment of patients with chronic HBV reduces hepatitis activity and disease progression, HBV is rarely eliminated and lifelong anti-viral therapy is required [4]. Similarly, despite major advances in the development of anti-viral therapy for HCV, 40\u201350% of patients chronically infected with HCV remain nonresponsive to treatment and will progress to developing liver cirrhosis or HCC within 15\u201320 years [5]\u2013[8]. Viral clearance depends on robust early innate and adaptive immune responses. Patients who do not respond to current HCV treatment appear to have reduced anti-viral immune responses due to an increased number and activity of Treg cells and their suppressive molecules [9]\u2013[12].",

Inhibition of FGL2 by antibody or an siRNA to exon 1 of the mouse fgl2 gene enhanced the survival of susceptible animals [21], whereas adoptive transfer of wild-type Treg into resistant fgl2\n\u2212/\u2212 mice accelerated their mortality [15]. Studies from our laboratory have now also suggested that FGL2 is also involved in the pathogenesis of human chronic HBV and HCV infection [16], [19]. Previously we demonstrated that patients with chronic HBV disease have elevated plasma levels of FGL2 and increased expression of fgl2 mRNA in their livers [16]. We recently reported that increased plasma levels of FGL2 in chronically infected HCV patients are associated with increased severity of liver disease and a poor outcome to anti-viral therapy [19].",

However, the MHV-3 model of FHF did not allow us to examine the role of FGL2 in adaptive T and B cell anti-viral immunity [15]. In the current study, we utilized the well-established murine model of acute viral hepatitis caused by LCMV WE [22], [23] to examine the influence of FGL2 on adaptive T and B cell immunity. We provide evidence here for the first time that FGL2 plays a critical role in regulating both anti-viral T and B cells immune responses in acute viral hepatitis. Deletion of fgl2 resulted in enhanced DC maturation as well as increasing virus-specific T cell responses and humoral B cell responses to LCMV. Collectively, these data provide important insights into the biology of FGL2 and its regulation of both innate and adaptive anti-viral immune responses. These studies also underscore the potential to use strategies to target FGL2 to enhance viral clearance in patients with acute and chronic HBV and HCV infection.",

Dendritic cells (DC) isolated from the spleens of fgl2\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with LCMV WE had increased expression of the DC maturation markers CD80 and MHC Class II compared to wild type controls (fgl2+/+ mice). Frequencies of CD8+ IFN\u03b3+ and CD4+IFN\u03b3+ T cells isolated from the spleen and lymph nodes were also increased in LCMV WE infected fgl2 \u2212/\u2212 mice.

Enhanced anti-viral immunity in fgl2\u2212/\u2212 mice was associated with increased levels of serum ALT, hepatic necrosis and inflammation following LCMV WE infection.

When expressed on the surface membranes of RE cells have been shown to have a potent prothrombinase activity, which is important for both initiation and localization of fibrin deposition. The prothrombinase activity of FGL2 has been shown to be important in containment of viral spread. Previously, we and others have show that following MHV-3 infection, C57BL6 susceptible mice generate a robust FGL2 prothrombinase response, which resulted in sinusoidal fibrin deposition, hepatic necrosis and death [23], [27]. In A/J mice, which are known to be resistant to MHV-3, FGL2 was generated at significantly lower levels and all mice cleared the virus and recovered. Fgl2\u2212/\u2212 mice failed to generate a procoagulant response following infection with MHV-3, and had increased viral replication within the liver suggesting that FGL2 as part of innate immunity is important in limiting viral replication and the early spread of MHV-3 prior to the development of adaptive T and B cell anti-viral responses. In the present study, we also observed increased viral titers on day 4 pi in the liver of LCMV WE infected fgl2\u2212/\u2212 mice prior to the development of adaptive T and B cell immune responses which is in agreement with our previous results in studies of MHV-3 infection [15]\u2013[16]. Lang et al have recently reported that Kupffer cells play a crucial role in regulating viral uptake and elimination. They showed that defects in macrophage function are associated with widespread dissemination of LCMV and subsequent immune mediated pathology [28]. The results from our experiments were consistent with their results. That IFN\u03b1 was increased in fgl2\u2212/\u2212 mice was also consistent with a recent report by Teijaro et al. [29] who showed that the expression of type I interferon reflects the level of viral replication, as well as the interplay between immune activation and suppression by negative regulators. Thus, the enhanced expression of type I interferon seen here is consistent with enhanced viral replication secondary to loss of FGL2 expression by reticuloendothelial cells.",

Consistent with this, targeted deletion of fgl2 leads to impaired Treg activity and enhanced reactivity of DC, T and B cells and autoimmune kidney disease (glomerulonephritis) [14]. Of note, numbers of Treg in na\u00efve fgl2\u2212/\u2212 mice are increased compared to fgl2+/+ mice..Treatment with recombinant FGL2 inhibits the maturation of DC and effector T cell responses as well as induces B cell apoptosis [14]. FGL2 mediates its regulatory effects through binding to the inhibitory FC\u03b3RIIB receptor, which is expressed on DC and B cells [20]. In the absence of FC\u03b3RIIB, the suppressive effects on immune responses are abrogated [20]. Based on these studies we postulated that interference with the FGL2-FC\u03b3RIIB inhibitory pathway would enhance anti-viral immune innate and adaptive immune responses in the experimental model of acute viral hepatitis caused by LCMV-WE.",

Infection of mice with LCMV WE results in an acute, self-limiting viral infection. Cellular and humoral immune responses are known to be critical for clearance of LCMV. APC present viral antigens to T cells leading to the generation of both virus specific CD8+ T cells, which can lyse virally infected cells and virus specific CD4+ T cells, which can produce immunostimulatory cytokines such as, IFN\u03b3 and IL-2. CD4+ T cells also provide the necessary signals to stimulate the secretion of protective neutralizing antibodies to LCMV by B cells [33]\u2013[34]. A recent study has reported the contribution of Treg to the impaired CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses to LCMV WE through modulation of DC activity [35]. Following infection with 2\u00d7106 PFU LCMV WE, we observed enhanced activity of DC in fgl2\u2212/\u2212 mice as early as day 1 pi as shown by increased expression of the maturation markers CD80 and MHC-II on the isolated cells and increased plasma IFN\u03b1 levels. These results are consistent with previous studies from our laboratory, which showed that uninfected fgl2\u2212\n/\u2212 mice have increased expression of maturation markers on DC derived from bone-marrow and spleen. We propose that the increased maturation of DC in fgl2\u2212/\u2212 in the early stage of the infection contributed to the augmented anti-viral T cell responses compared to fgl2\n+/+ mice. Increased frequencies of intrahepatic CD8+ T cells and virus-specific CD3\u03b5+CD8\u03b1+GP33+ and CD3\u03b5+CD8\u03b1+NP396+ T cells were found in fgl2\u2212/\u2212 mice which had been infected with LCMV WE. In addition to the increased frequencies of virus-specific T cells, loss of FGL2 enhanced IFN\u03b3 responses of both CD8+ CTL and CD4+ T-helper cells upon in vitro stimulation with LCMV peptides.",

At this time we cannot determine unequivocally whether loss of prothrombinase with associated increased viral replication or loss of the immunosuppressive FGL2 produced by Treg accounts for the increase in adaptive T and B cell anti-viral immunity seen. Furthermore, it has been reported that high levels of LCMV virus results in a reduction in both CTL and antibody responses [37]\u2013[43] through increased expression of PD1 and immunosuppressive cytokines leading to T cell exhaustion. Thus, these data collectively would support that the increase in adaptive T and B cell anti-viral immunity was secondary to loss of suppressive FGL2 Treg activity rather than increased viral replication secondary to loss of FGL2 prothrombinase.",
