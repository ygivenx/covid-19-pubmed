While mice have been extremely helpful in modeling human diseases, in some cases they are inadequate due to species-specific differences in the cell biology of the affected organ and/or the evolutionary divergence of their genome. The domestic ferret (Mustela putorius furo) has proven an excellent species for modeling certain human diseases when mice have failed, and technologies for genetic engineering in ferrets have expanded the potential use of this species for human disease research. However, until now, techniques for generating transgenic and knockout ferrets have predominantly relied upon genetic manipulation of fibroblasts followed by somatic cell nuclear transfer1,2. Such an approach is labor intensive and expensive. More recently, both clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9- and transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN)-mediated approaches have been used to generate knockout ferrets3,4. Here, we present a rapid method for generating transgenic ferrets using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted insertion at the ROSA26 locus in ferret zygotes.",

Additionally, ferrets develop multi-organ lethal disease following Ebolavirus infection6 and can replicate and transmit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus7. The similar cellular distribution of viral receptors in the lung between humans and ferrets likely accounts for the ability of the ferret to serve as a good model of influenza infection8,9. Further, the conserved stem cell biology in the lung between these two species also likely contributes to the ability of ferrets to model bronchiolitis obliterans in an allograft lung transplant model10,11. Ferrets have also been used to study aspects of cortical neuronal development and neural progenitor cells12\u201314, and recently, knockout ferrets enabled the discovery an evolutionary mechanism involved in determining cerebral cortical size in humans for which conservation in mice is lacking4.",

            "text": "The completion of the ferret genome24 has aided our understanding of why ferrets model human lung diseases so well. Generally speaking, mice are genetically more distant from humans at the protein level than ferrets24. For example, with respect to several classes of proteins potentially important for lung inflammation and remodeling, humans and ferrets exhibit significantly greater protein conservation than that observed between humans and mice (GO Terms: Cytokine Activity (Figure S1A, P = 1.47E-12), Receptor Complex (Figure S1B, P = 9.24E-9), and Extracellular Matrix (Figure S1C, P = 1.05E-13)). In this context, mice lack a direct ortholog of the IL-8 gene, which is present in ferrets and humans, and instead have three IL-8 paralogs (CXCL1/KC, CXCL2/MIP-2, and CXCL5-6/LIX)25. Moreover, given the conservation in ferret and human genes related to brain development (Figure S1D, P = 7.85E-9) and visual perception (Figure S1E, P = 8.14E-9), it is not surprising that disruption of the ferret abnormal spindle-like microcephaly-associated (ASPM) gene accurately models the most common recessive microcephaly genetic disease3,4, and that this species has binocular vision26 that closely models multisensory visual processing in humans27,28. Notably, both of these attributes are not conserved in mice. Thus, an opportunity exists to create new genetically defined ferret models that share disease-relevant characteristics with humans and better predict the clinical success of therapeutics.",

Recently, the CRISPR/Cas9 system has become a mainstream tool in which to quickly generate transgenic models using zygote injection29. CRISPR/Cas9 enables efficient sequence-specific mutations via the homology-directed repair (HDR) and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathways. Typically, the HDR-mediated gene repair strategy has been used to establish targeted knock-in alleles with donor DNA templates, whereas the NHEJ pathway has been used to generate loss-of-function alleles by frame shift-mediated mutations30. NHEJ is the dominant DNA repair pathway in dividing and non-dividing cells, whereas HDR-mediated editing has a comparatively low recombination rate (reported in the range of 0\u201320%)31,32. More recently, NHEJ-mediated targeted insertion in zygotes and embryos has evolved as a method for knock-in transgenesis in C. elegans33, zebrafish34,35, and Xenopus tropicalis36. While CRISPR/Cas9-mediated HDR methods of large transgene-directed insertions have been reported in the literature for mouse zygotes32, to our knowledge, NHEJ-mediated targeted insertion in zygotes has yet to be evaluated in mammals.",

Using this approach, a Cre-reporter transgenic ferret with a convertible fluorescent reporter system was generated. The Cre-recombinase dual reporter system contains a CAG promoter, membrane-bound tdTomato (mT), terminator, and membrane-bound EGFP (mG) elements. Additionally, this transgene insertion is flanked by a Dual Integrase Cassette Exchange (DICE) system39 to allow for rapid insertion of additional transgenes flanking the Cre-reporter or the directional exchange of the Cre-reporter for another transgene. The DICE system utilizes two phage integrase enzymes that recognize specific DNA sequence motifs within the donor and genomic target locus to facilitate recombinase-mediated cassette exchange. If one recombinase is utilized it will direct insertion only at the DNA recognition motif. This system offers complete control of gene knock-in, including orientation and copy number without a size limitation39. This flexible transgenic ferret model will enable highly efficient gene manipulation in ferret zygotes and facilitate both lineage tracing and stem cell therapy studies in ferrets.",

Of note, this approach utilized self-inactivating gRNA target sites that theoretically should direct insertion of the transgene cassette in the reverse, but not forward, direction at the ROSA26 gene. This PCR analysis demonstrated that five (A1, A3, B2, B5 and D1) out of the six tdTomato-expressing transgenic ferret kits had targeted insertions at the ROSA26 locus (Fig. 3). However, no PCR product was amplified from genomic DNA of the sixth kit (E1) when using standard primers that flanked the insertion site (data not shown). We hypothesized that a large deletion may have occurred in both flanking region for the E1 insertion and thus walked primers up to 1 kb away from the targeting site and still could not amplify a PCR product. Thus, we assume that the E1 transgenic animal randomly integrated the transgene. Of the five-targeted knock-in kits, three demonstrated a forward orientation of the transgene and two demonstrated a reverse orientation of the transgene at the ROSA26 locus (Fig. 3, Table 1). Of note, all examined transgenic founders were heterozygotes for the transgene insertion at the ROSA26 locus, and three of these founders (B2, B5 and E1) contained random transgene integration events of which a subset appeared to be mosaic based on the  intensity of Southern blot banding patterns presented below (Table 1).",

As expected, a 6.4-kb band corresponding to the endogenous ROSA26 locus was detected in all ferret genomic DNA samples using intronic probes, confirming the presence of a non-transgenic allele in all examined ferrets (Fig. 5B). Of importance, a specific band with a predicted size of 9.6 kb for a forward insertion of the transgene cassette was observed in A1, B5 and D1 animals using the 5\u2032-intron and the internal EGFP probes (Fig. 5B). Equally noteworthy, results of Southern blotting for the A1, B5, D1 transgenic animals also showed different sized unpredicted bands (4.8 kb; 2.8 kb; 2.3 kb) with the 3\u2032-intron probe, suggesting that large indels likely occurred at the 3\u2032 junctional integration site of the ROSA26 locus (Fig. 5B,C). Additionally, the B5 transgenic ferret also exhibited an additional band that hybridized to all three tested probes (a ~8 kb band using the 5\u2032-intron probe, a ~6 kb and an over 12 kb band using the EGFP probe, and a ~8 kb band using 3\u2032-intron probe), suggesting an additional random integration event. A specific banding pattern with expected sizes for a reverse orientation insertion (9.0 kb, 3.9 kb and 9.0 kb) of the transgene was observed in the genomic DNA of the B2 ferret using the internal EGFP, 5\u2032-intron, and 3\u2032-intron probes, respectively. This animal also has an unexpected 12 kb band detected by the EGFP probe, suggesting the occurrence of another random integration event (Fig. 5B,C).",

Fluorescent images of sectioned organs further demonstrated broad expression of membrane-bound mT in brain cortex, cardiac muscle, liver hepatocytes, skeletal muscle and spleen (Fig. 6B). Ubiquitous expression of mT fluorescent protein was also observed in epithelial tissues, including tracheal epithelium and cartilage, distal lung alveoli, kidney epithelium, retinal epithelium and intestinal epithelium, but not in non-transgenic animals (Fig. 7).

Primary fibroblasts were derived from ear biopsies of transgenic ferrets and infected with a recombinant adenoviral vector expressing LacZ (Ad.LacZ; negative control) or Cre recombinase (Ad.Cre). As expected, there was efficient conversion of mT to membrane-bound EGFP (mG) following Ad.Cre infection in all the primary fibroblasts evaluated from live founders (Fig. 8A\u2013C and data not shown). By contrast, uninfected fibroblasts (Fig. 8A) and Ad.LacZ-infected fibroblasts (Fig. 8B) retained the expression of mT with no conversion to mG. However, the B5 founder had a subset of mT negative cells in both the Ad.Cre and Ad.LacZ infected fibroblasts (Fig. 8G,H), suggesting that this founder was likely a chimera with most, but not all, fibroblasts containing the integrated ROSA26 transgene. This B5 founder was the only transgenic founder that produced fibroblasts lacking mT expression. Southern blotting of genomic DNA from these fibroblasts using an EGFP probe further confirmed Cre-mediated excision of dtTomato as indicated by a reduction in the size of the transgene cassette following Ad.Cre infection as compared to non-infected fibroblasts (Fig. 8D). FACS analysis of Ad.Cre-mediated recombination in fibroblasts from the four surviving transgenic ferret founders demonstrated highly efficient conversion of mT to mG (89.2% for A1, 96.1% for B2, 58.9% for B5, 93.5% for D1) (Fig. 8E\u2013H, and data not shown).

By using this protocol, transgenic ferrets harboring LoxPtdTomatoStopLoxPEGFP dual reporter genes were generated using an sgRNA that concurrently cleaved both the ferret genomic ROSA26 locus and the donor plasmid, allowing for targeted insertion without the need for long homology arms. In comparison to conventional homologous recombination46 and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated HDR approaches in mice31,32, results from Southern blotting analysis and germ-line transmission demonstrate that the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated NHEJ approach increased the efficiency of targeted integration in ferret zygotes. Despite this increased efficiency over HDR-based approaches, NHEJ-directed targeting integration has several drawbacks. First, although the approach is designed for directional insertion of the donor DNA, we observed that the insert effectively integrated in both the forward and reverse orientations. Second, indels at both the 3\u2032- and 5\u2032-junctions occurred, limiting the application for precisely introducing reporter constructs into genes. However, this can be circumvented using an intron-based insertion strategy that is compatible with capturing expression of a gene locus through the introduction of a splice acceptor within the transgene cassette.",

The strategy incorporates the Cas9 gRNA sequences targeting the ROSA26 intron 1 into the flanking sequence of the donor plasmid. After injection of the Cas9 RNP complex into zygote pronuclei, the donor plasmid and chromosome are synchronously cleaved, allowing for efficient integration of the donor DNA.
