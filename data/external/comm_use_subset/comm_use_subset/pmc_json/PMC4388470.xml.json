In humans the type I IFN family encompasses 13 IFN-\u03b1, a single IFN-\u03b2 and a few minor IFN subtypes (IFN-\u03ba/\u03b5/\u03c9) that all bind to a single heterodimeric cell surface complex known as IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor [6]. IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor engagement activates the Jak-STAT signaling pathway and induces the expression of several hundred IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), many of which exhibit direct antiviral activity [7\u201310]. In 2003, the type III IFN family (IFN-\u03bb), encompassing 3 similar IFN-\u03bb molecules, was discovered [11,12]. It quickly became clear that the induction and mechanism of action of IFN-\u03bb and type I IFN are very similar [13\u201316], although IFN-\u03bb uses a distinct receptor for signaling. These observations raised the question why two seemingly redundant antiviral systems may have evolved.",

Accordingly, IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor-deficient mice show enhanced susceptibility to a large panel of different viruses [2,4]. On the contrary, mice lacking functional IFN-\u03bb receptors control systemic viral infections quite well and are only slightly more susceptible to respiratory viruses than wild-type mice [14,16]. Interestingly, mice deficient in both IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN-\u03bb are extremely susceptible to various respiratory viruses, demonstrating redundancy of the two IFN systems in the lung that is rich in epithelial cells [14].",

For example, IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 plays an important role in restricting virus-induced disease after oral inoculation of mice with poliovirus or human reoviruses, but it is of moderate importance in restricting rotavirus that exhibits a high tropism for gut epithelial cells [17\u201323]. We recently demonstrated that the IFN-\u03bb system is essential for efficient control of rotavirus replication in intestinal epithelial cells [23]. This finding was surprising, considering the fact that receptors for IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 are believed to be expressed on all nucleated cells and raised the question of why the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 system was unable to compensate for IFN-\u03bb deficiency in this case.",

Interestingly, besides responding strongly to IFN-\u03bb, intestinal epithelial cells also readily produced IFN-\u03bb but not IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b2 in response to viral triggers, suggesting that IFN-\u03bb functions as an autonomous antiviral defense mechanism in the gut epithelium that requires no assistance by type I IFN. Virus challenge experiments of mice lacking functional receptors for either IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 or IFN-\u03bb confirmed the concept of a compartmentalized intestinal mucosal IFN system and highlighted the exceptionally dominant role of IFN-\u03bb in antiviral protection of intestinal epithelial cells and bile ducts.",

We analyzed the purity of isolated cell fractions by measuring the expression of marker genes of epithelial cells (Cdh1 encoding E-cadherin) and leukocytes (Ptprc encoding CD45) (S1A and S2 Figs), as well as by flow cytometry using antibodies against CD45 and the epithelial marker EpCAM (S1B Fig). As expected, Ifnlr1 and Il10r2, coding for the two chains of the IFN-\u03bb receptor complex, were highly expressed in IECs but not in LPLs (Figs 1A and S2). Both components of the type I IFN receptor complex, Ifnar1 and Ifnar2, were highly expressed in LPL that are well known to readily respond to type I IFN. By contrast, in IECs, we observed only low expression of Ifnar1 and Ifnar2 (Figs 1A and S2). Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the IEC fractions contained about 5% CD45+ cells (S1B Fig). Thus, we used fluorescence-activated cell sorting to purify epithelial (EpCAM+CD45-) cells from crude IEC and LPL fractions (S1B Fig). RT-qPCR analysis revealed strongly decreased expression of Ifnar1 and Ifnar2 in purified epithelial cells when compared to leukocytes (EpCAM-CD45+) (S1C Fig).",

We hypothesized that if IECs predominantly responded to IFN-\u03bb, IECs of Ifnar1\n-/-, but not Ifnlr1\n-/-, mice should exhibit low steady state IFN responses. To evaluate this hypothesis, we measured the expression of two representative ISGs, Isg15 and Oasl2, in IEC and LPL fractions isolated from intestinal tissue of wild-type, Ifnar1\n-/- and Ifnlr1\n-/- mice (Fig 1C).

Similar to the gut mucosa, IFN-\u03bb induced Mx1 exclusively in epithelial cells of respiratory tissues (S1F Fig). In IFN-\u03b1-treated animals, however, a broad range of cell types from the lung and trachea, including the E-cadherin-positive epithelial cells, showed prominent nuclear Mx1 staining (S1F Fig), indicating striking differences in type I IFN responsiveness in cells from the gut and the respiratory tract. No Mx1 staining was observed in tissue from the respiratory tract after combined treatment with IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03bb of Ifnar1\n-/-\nIfnlr1\n-/- double knockout control mice (S1G Fig).

To determine why the IFN system is compartmentalized in the intestinal mucosa, we employed reovirus as a model [17,31\u201333]. Mammalian reoviruses have a wide cell tropism and exhibit a low degree of species specificity. After infection by the oral route, type I IFN signaling is of crucial importance for restricting systemic reovirus dissemination. By contrast, in IFN-competent hosts, reovirus-induced disease is mostly mild [17,34,35]. Indeed, intra-gastric inoculation of adult Ifnar1\n-/- mice with the human reovirus type 3 Dearing strain led to severe neurological symptoms such as hind limb paralysis, and all Ifnar1\n-/- animals had to be sacrificed by day 4 post-infection. By contrast, no symptoms were observed after infection of adult Ifnlr1\n-/- and wild-type mice (S4A Fig). Accordingly, reovirus replication in the terminal small intestinal tissue at day 4 post-infection was significantly higher in Ifnar1\n-/- mice compared to Ifnlr1\n-/- or wild-type animals (Figs 3A and S4B).",

In Fig 1 we demonstrated that IFN-\u03bb, but not type I IFN, induces a strong antiviral response in the epithelial barrier that separates the gut lumen from sterile host tissues. To examine the role of type I and type III IFNs in virus excretion, we quantified reovirus shedding in feces on day 4 post-infection. We observed high titers of infectious virus in feces of adult Ifnar1\n-/- and Ifnlr1\n-/- but not wild-type mice (Fig 3B). Considering the largely different virus titers in the intestinal tissue (Fig 3A), Ifnar1\n-/- mice excreted relatively small amounts of virus when compared to Ifnlr1\n-/- mice. Animals lacking both IFN receptors (Ifnar1\n-/-\nIfnlr1\n-/-) had comparable virus titers in the tissue to Ifnar1\n-/- mice, whereas virus shedding in feces was even higher than from Ifnlr1\n-/- mice (S4C Fig). Together, these results suggested that excreted virus may originate from different cell types in Ifnar1\n-/- and Ifnlr1\n-/- mice. Immunohistochemical staining of tissue samples from the small intestine confirmed this view. Reovirus antigen was almost exclusively found in IECs of Ifnlr1\n-/- mice at day 4 post-infection (Fig 3C, right panel), whereas reovirus was restricted to lamina propria cells in Ifnar1\n-/- mice (Fig 3C, middle panel). Reovirus specifically adheres to M cells and initially replicates in cells of the Peyer\u2019s patch (PP) mucosa [36]. Accordingly, we detected reovirus antigen in cells of the PP of all three mouse strains (Fig 3D). In infected Ifnar1\n-/- mice the PPs were enlarged, and massive changes in the structure of the follicle-associated epithelium was observed (Fig 3D, middle panel) as previously described for reovirus type 1 [17]. In infected Ifnlr1\n-/- mice no such changes of the PP structure were noted. Interestingly, reovirus antigen in Ifnlr1\n-/- was detected in the follicle-associated epithelium as well as in the underlying tissue (Fig 3D, right panel). In contrast, reovirus staining in wild-type animals was restricted to few PP cells located under the epithelium (Fig 3D, left panel). These data indicate that reovirus produced by IECs of Ifnlr1\n-/- mice may more easily reach the feces than virus produced by cells in the tissue below, a mechanism accounting for the observed enhanced virus shedding in feces in Ifnlr1\n-/- mice.",

We therefore asked whether the compartmentalized IFN response pattern, unique for the intestinal mucosa, might have more pronounced consequences for young animals. Two-days-old wild-type, Ifnlr1\n-/- and Ifnar1\n-/- animals were orally infected with reovirus, and viral titers in small intestine and colon were analyzed on day 4 post-infection. Contrary to the situation in adult mice, reovirus grew extremely well in the gut tissue of suckling Ifnlr1\n-/- mice, and virus titers in the small intestine (Fig 4A) and colon (S5A Fig) of such animals were significantly higher than in Ifnar1\n-/- mice. Immunohistochemistry revealed heavy infection of IECs in the terminal small intestine (Fig 4B) and colon (S5B Fig) of Ifnlr1\n-/- mice, whereas the virus was largely localized to the lamina propria region of the small intestine (Fig 4B) in Ifnar1\n-/- mice. Quantification of virus-infected cells demonstrated a striking differential cell tropism of reovirus to epithelial and non-epithelial cells in the small intestine depending on whether the receptors for IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03bb were defective (S5C Fig). Low levels of infectious reovirus were measured in intestinal tissue of wild-type mice (Fig 4A), but no viral antigen was detected by immunostaining (Fig 4B).",

To determine whether the oily hair syndrome, observed in infected Ifnlr1\n-/- mice, was due to preferential replication of reovirus in biliary epithelial cells, we stained the liver and extrahepatic biliary tubules for virus antigen at day 4 post-infection. In these animals, large amount of reovirus antigen was indeed detected in extra- and intrahepatic cytokeratin-positive biliary epithelial cells, but seemingly not in any other cell type (Fig 4D and 4E). By contrast, reovirus-positive cells were present throughout the liver and detected adjacent to epithelial cells of the extrahepatic bile ducts of Ifnar1\n-/- mice, whereas the epithelium was largely virus free (Fig 4D and 4E). No virus antigen-positive cells were present in either the liver or the bile ducts of wild-type mice (Fig 4D and 4E). Analysis of tissues from Ifnlr1\n-/- mice that succumbed to the disease revealed destruction of the biliary epithelium, accumulation of virus antigen and blockade of the bile ducts (Fig 4F). H&E staining of the liver tissue on day 4 post-infection revealed inflammatory cells in all reovirus-infected animals with infiltrates localized predominantly around intrahepatic bile ducts in Ifnlr1\n-/- mice (S5D Fig). Taken together, these infection studies demonstrated a clear functional separation of the type I IFN and the IFN-\u03bb system in antiviral defense of the gastrointestinal mucosa. They further revealed that reovirus can specifically target cholangiocytes of Ifnlr1\n-/- mice which prominently express functional IFN-\u03bb receptors [44].",

Virus was largely cleared in wild-type mice by day 4, but was still present in guts of Ifnar1\n-/- and Ifnlr1\n-/- mice (Figs 5A and S6A). RT-qPCR analysis of RNA isolated from the whole intestinal tissue revealed strong expression of the IFN-regulated genes Isg15 and Oasl2 in wild-type and Ifnar1\n-/- mice on day 1 (Fig 5B). By contrast, Ifnlr1\n-/- mice failed to mount a proper IFN response on day 1 and showed a strongly attenuated response on day 4 post-infection (Fig 5B). A similar picture emerged when isolated IEC fractions rather than whole tissues were analyzed (S6B Fig), indicating that the protective response in the gut is predominantly mediated by IFN-\u03bb, which is produced quickly after virus infection.",

At day 1, a large number of virus-positive IECs were detectable in the terminal part of the small intestine of wild-type, Ifnar1\n-/- and Ifnlr1\n-/- mice (Fig 5D). High levels of nuclear Mx1 were detectable in the majority of IECs in tissue samples from wild-type and Ifnar1\n-/- animals already at day 1 post-infection. In contrast, no Mx1 signals were detected in tissue from Ifnlr1\n-/- mice at this time point (Fig 5D, right panels), confirming that early responses are due to IFN-\u03bb in the epithelium. At the early time post-infection, lamina propria cells that readily respond to exogenous type I IFN (see Fig 1) did not contain detectable levels of Mx1 in wild-type or Ifnlr1\n-/-, suggesting that type I IFN production was low. By day 4 post-infection, wild-type animals had largely cleared the virus, whereas the intestinal tissue of Ifnar1\n-/- and Ifnlr1\n-/- mice was still heavily positive for reovirus antigen. Interestingly, on day 4 post-infection the vast majority of infected cells in Ifnar1\n-/- mice were located in the lamina propria region and not the epithelium as on day 1, whereas virus antigen remained associated with IECs in Ifnlr1\n-/- mice (Fig 5D, right panels). Virus clearance from IECs of wild-type and Ifnar1\n-/- mice by day 4 correlated with a strong IFN-\u03bb-induced antiviral state, visualized by strong epithelial Mx1 staining. In Ifnlr1\n-/- mice, however, only a small fraction of villi were positive for Mx1 at this late time point, indicating that IFN-\u03bb-independent antiviral responses were induced in only a small fraction of IECs by day 4 (Fig 5D). These data, together with RT-qPCR analysis of ISG expression (Fig 5B), demonstrate that during enteric virus infection type I IFN cannot compensate for the loss of IFN-\u03bb, leading to prolonged replication of the virus in epithelial cells.",

Nevertheless, these cells remained protected from reovirus in wild-type and Ifnlr1\n-/- mice, suggesting that type I IFN production during reovirus infection was low but protective (Fig 5D). Type I IFN that restricts systemic reovirus spread and protects mice against lethal infection is produced by dendritic cells [17]. IFN-\u03bb production in virus-infected gut has to date not been analyzed. Earlier observations suggested that cells derived from the gut epithelium are potent producers of IFN-\u03bb (see Fig 2). We therefore directly measured the expression of IFN genes by RT-qPCR in IEC fractions isolated from mock- and reovirus-infected mice. Ifnl2/3 but not type I IFN genes were significantly induced in cells from wild-type mice on day 1 post infection (Fig 5C). In IEC preparations from Ifnlr1\n-/- mice that are highly susceptible to reovirus infection, induction of the Ifnl2/3 genes was nearly 100-fold higher than in infected wild-type mice, whereas type I IFN genes were not expressed at enhanced rates at this early time point (Fig 5C). Our data demonstrates that IFN-\u03bb produced by cells of the gut epithelium drives the early antiviral response that largely clears the virus from epithelial cells by day 4. Type I IFN appears to play no major role at this early stage of the reovirus infection. It rather prevents systemic virus spread.",

We found that IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 was unable to induce the expression of antiviral genes in the intestinal epithelium and failed to protect these cells from infection with an enteric virus due to low expression of the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor complex. In contrast, IFN-\u03bb induced robust antiviral protection in IECs. IFN-\u03bb but not IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 genes were expressed at low but detectable levels in the gut mucosa of uninfected animals, and the gut epithelium produced high amounts of IFN-\u03bb but not IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 in response to treatment of mice with an IFN-inducing chemical or after reovirus infection. Thus, the intestinal epithelium and the lamina propria are two compartments of the gut that not only preferentially produce but also preferentially respond to different types of IFN.",

However, it appears as if the contribution of IFN-\u03bb at these other sites, including the lung, is mostly inferior to that of type I IFN. The reovirus data presented here explain our earlier observations with murine rotavirus which had pointed toward a non-redundant role of IFN-\u03bb in epithelial cells of the intestinal tract [23]. Because reovirus can vigorously replicate in the epithelium of IFN-\u03bb receptor-deficient mice, it has easy access to the gut lumen and is excreted in feces at high levels. The comparatively low fecal shedding of reovirus observed in IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor-deficient mice might be explained by a barrier function of the largely virus-free epithelial layer that physically separates virus-producing lamina propria cells from the gut lumen.",

We further reported that the respiratory SARS-CoV can be detected in feces of mice lacking both IFN receptor systems, but not in mice that only lack receptors for IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 [14]. Consistently, the Stat1 and Ifnlr1 but not the Ifnar1 genes were recently shown to limit fecal norovirus shedding in mice [45]. Collectively, these results point to a substantial importance of IFN-\u03bb in restricting virus excretion. We assume that other cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3 might also contribute, but this was not investigated here. Since the fecal-oral route is the major mode for transmission of enteric human viruses, such as poliovirus, norovirus, rotavirus, hepatitis E and A viruses, it is tempting to speculate that IFN-\u03bb helps limiting excretion of these important human pathogens.",

Several recent studies suggested that cells of epithelial origin, such as the respiratory epithelium, keratinocytes and hepatocytes are potent producers of IFN-\u03bb in virus-infected hosts [48\u201355]. We found that both IECs and hematopoietic cells in the epithelium strongly expressed IFN-\u03bb but not IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 genes quickly after stimulation with poly (I:C) and in response to reovirus infection. Thus, the mucosal epithelium has evolved mechanisms to specifically produce IFN-\u03bb. As similar signaling pathways are believed to control the expression of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN-\u03bb genes [56], this observation is surprising and suggests that the induction of genes encoding IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 is specifically blocked in IECs by an unknown mechanism. In polarized intestinal epithelial cells peroxisome-bound MAVS may preferentially trigger expression of IFN-\u03bb genes [57], offering a potential explanation for our observations.",

We found that suckling mice lacking functional receptors for IFN-\u03bb showed a milder disease than IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor-deficient mice, although virus titers in the gastrointestinal tract of the IFN-\u03bb receptor-deficient animals were substantially higher. This can probably be explained by the fact that severe damage of the gut epithelium has no immediate lethal consequences. Interestingly, reovirus-infected suckling mice deficient in functional receptors for IFN-\u03bb showed symptoms resembling biliary atresia [58], which included oily fur syndrome and liver inflammation. Biliary atresia is a rare disease affecting one in 10,000 infants with etiology and pathology largely unknown. Infection with various viruses, including reovirus type 3, has been proposed to be associated with the disease in children [59,60]. Infection of mice with certain strains of rota- and reoviruses can reproduce most features of the human disease [61,62]. We detected virus antigen in cholangiocytes of our IFN-\u03bb receptor-deficient but not wild-type or IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2-deficient mice that were infected with reovirus at early age, strongly suggesting that IFN-\u03bb plays a decisive role in defending the biliary tract against viruses. This conclusion is consistent with our recent finding that mouse cholangiocytes are readily responding to exogenous IFN-\u03bb [44]. Based on the results of our mouse model system, it is conceivable that children with biliary atresia may have genetic defect in their IFN-\u03bb system.",

Besides inducing and regulating innate and acquired immunity against pathogens and tumors, IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 can also induce excessive inflammation (reviewed in [63])[64]. Chronic virus infections, such as HIV or LCMV, can lead to lymphocyte dysfunction due to prolonged IFN signaling [20,65] or refractoriness to IFN stimulation in hepatocytes in the case of HCV [66].
