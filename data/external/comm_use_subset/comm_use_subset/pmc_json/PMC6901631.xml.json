To date, there are 171 rhinovirus (RV) genotypes recognized and classified into the three species as RV-A (83 types), RV-B (32 types), and RV-C (56 types) (Royston and Tapparel, 2016; Pan et al., 2018). RV-A and RV-B were discovered by isolation on monkey kidney cells in 1950s (Price, 1956) while RV-C genotypes, which are not cultivable using ordinary culture methods, have been identified decades after following the rise of molecular techniques (Lamson et al., 2006; Lau et al., 2007). There are also differences between RV species in utilization of cell entry receptor: a majority of RV-A and RV-B attach to the intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 (classified as the major receptor group) and the others alternatively bind low density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) (minor receptor group), whereas RV-C utilizes human cadherin-related family member 3 (CDHR3) (Bochkov et al., 2015; Royston and Tapparel, 2016).",

ORF encodes a poly-protein which is cleaved by virally encoded proteases in 11 proteins. Four proteins \u2013 VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4 \u2013 make up the viral capsid and account for the virus\u2019 antigenic diversity, while the remaining non-structural proteins are involved in viral genome replication and assembly. A rather conserved 5\u2032 UTR region that harbors internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) is usually utilized for RV detection from clinical samples, while more precise genotyping is based on VP4/VP2 or VP1 sequence analysis.",

Introduction of sensitive and technically simple molecular detection assays, especially multiplex PCR, enabled affordable RV detection in line with other common respiratory viruses in clinical samples. Together with coronaviruses, RVs are indeed responsible for majority of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), but also for substantial rate of LRTIs in all age groups (Lauinger et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2018, \u010civljak et al., 2019). Many studies showed that RV is one of the leading causes of pneumonia, bronchiolitis and other form of severe respiratory disease (Zhao et al., 2018), standing side by side with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in children and influenza in elderly (Esposito et al., 2013; Ning et al., 2017; \u010civljak et al., 2019). There are several studies that report increased rates of asthma exacerbations and LRTIs among children with RV-C when compared to those infected with RV-A and RV-B (Bizzintino et al., 2011; Lauinger et al., 2013); however, recent studies did not find any relationship between a specific RV species and the severity of clinical presentation (Jacobs et al., 2015; van der Linden et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2018).",

Multiplex RT-PCR for 15 respiratory viruses using Seeplex\u00ae RV15 detection kit (Seegene Inc., Seoul, Korea) was performed. Briefly, multiplex PCR and cDNA synthesis as one-step reaction was performed and set up in three different tubes with three sets of primers. More specifically, \u201cA set\u201d contained primers for simultaneous amplification of target sequences of adenovirus (AdV), human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E/Nl63, parainfluenza virus (PIV) types 1-3, and PCR internal control to check for the presence of substances that may interfere with amplification; \u201cB set\u201d contained primers for HCoV OC43, RV groups A/B/C, RSV type A and B, influenza (Flu) type A, and PCR internal control; and \u201cC set\u201d contained primers for human bocavirus (HBoV), Flu type B, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), PIV type 4, human enterovirus (HEV), and the overall process control (human RNase P was included throughout the entire process as a control from nucleic acid extraction to amplification). Amplification was performed on thermal cycler GeneAmp\u00ae 9700 PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, United States). Detection of PCR products was done by microchip electrophoresis on the MCE\u00ae-202 MultiNA device (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) \u2013 including software analysis showing results in the form of electropherograms and virtual image gels.",

Conversely, some other author groups pointed out how RV can predominate in practically all age groups (Tsagarakis et al., 2018).",

Moreover, it has been shown that 5\u2032 UTR RT-PCR demonstrated greater sensitivity than VP4-VP2 PCR, as reflected by the higher positivity rate in amplification of clinical isolates, and further, no need for a nested PCR or multiple primer pairs \u2013 reducing in turn the contamination rate, cost and turnaround time (Kiang et al., 2008). Despite using primers which target the region widely used for typing purposes, more than half of the samples produced no amplicons suitable for sequencing. Such low rate of successful RV sequencing from clinical samples may be a consequence of mutations in primer regions or low viral load in original sample, but most probably arises due to RNA degradation during freezing/thawing cycles.",
