Although not required for EBOV replication [7], Late (L) domains (which contain PTAP and/or PPxY amino acid sequence motifs) are conserved within EBOV and MARV VP40 and promote efficient egress of VLPs and virus by recruiting host proteins that facilitate virus-cell separation [3,4,6,8\u201311].

Using this unbiased approach, we identified WW-domain containing protein BAG3 as a novel eVP40 interactor. BAG3 is a stress-induced molecular co-chaperone involved in regulating cellular protein homeostasis by CMA. Since in general, viral PPxY-containing proteins tend to bind WW-domains with good specificity and selectivity [40], our identification of BAG3 suggests that this protein may play a biologically relevant role in the lifecycle of EBOV. Indeed, we confirmed that hypothesis by first using co-IP to validate the specificity of the PPxY/WW-domain physical interaction between VP40 (both eVP40 and mVP40) and BAG3, and functionally demonstrated that expression of BAG3 inhibited VP40 VLP production, as well as budding of a VSV recombinant virus containing the EBOV VP40 PPxY L-domain motif. To our knowledge, this is the first identification of a VP40-interacting mammalian WW-domain bearing protein that negatively regulates budding. Mechanistically, our data suggest that BAG3 binds VP40 and not only sequesters it away from the site of budding at the plasma membrane, but also directs a fraction of VP40 into aggresomes, thus reducing VLP egress.",

Input and pulldown proteins were detected by Western blot. Indeed, we found that GST-BAG3WW, but not GST alone, pulled down eVP40 in a PPxY-dependent manner (Fig 2A, top right panel), and also pulled down mVP40 that contains a single PPxY L-domain motif (Fig 2B, top right panel).

            "text": "Finally, we sought to identify the functional domains of BAG3 that mediate its interaction with eVP40 and mVP40. BAG3 contains a number of functional domains including: a single N-terminal WW-domain, two IPV regions that bind to HspB8 and function in protein quality control, multiple PxxP motifs that binds to SH3 domains, and a C-terminal BAG domain that interacts with the ATPase domain of HSP70 (Fig 4A) [41\u201345]. Briefly, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with eVP40 plus His/myc-tagged BAG3 WT, BAG3-\u0394N (WW-domain deletion mutant), or BAG3-\u0394C (BAG domain deletion mutant) (Fig 4A and 4B). Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with either non-specific IgG, or anti-eVP40 antiserum as indicated (Fig 4B), and cmyc-tagged BAG3 was detected in precipitated samples by Western blot using anti-cmyc antiserum (Fig 4B). BAG3-WT (lane 4) and BAG3-\u0394C (lane 6) were detected in eVP40 precipitates; however, BAG3-\u0394N (lane 5) was not. No appreciable levels of BAG3 WT, BAG3-\u0394N, and BAG3-\u0394C were detected in preimmune IgG precipitates (Fig 4B, lanes 1\u20133). Similar results were obtained in HEK293T cells transfected with mVP40 plus the indicated BAG3 plasmids (Fig 4C). Indeed, BAG3-WT (Fig 4C, lane 4) and BAG3-\u0394C (Fig 4C, lane 6) were detected in mVP40 precipitates, whereas BAG3-\u0394N lacking the WW-domain was not detected (Fig 4C, lane 5). Western blots of the three BAG3 proteins, eVP40, mVP40, and actin are shown as expression controls (Fig 4B and 4C). These data demonstrate that the BAG3 WW-domain specifically mediates interactions with both eVP40 and mVP40 in mammalian cells.",

To test this, we used our well-established VP40 VLP budding assay to determine whether expression of BAG3-WT, BAG3-\u0394N or BAG3-\u0394C would affect VP40 VLP egress. Briefly, HEK 293T cells were transfected with eVP40 or mVP40 alone, or in combination with either BAG3-WT, BAG3-\u0394N or BAG3-\u0394C, and both cell extracts and supernatants containing VLPs were harvested at 24 hours post transfection (Fig 5). All proteins were detected at equivalent levels in cell extracts (Fig 5A and 5C Cells). Interestingly, we found that expression of BAG3WT or BAG3-\u0394C consistently resulted in a significant decrease in egress of both eVP40 (Fig 5A and 5B) and mVP40 (Fig 5C and 5D) VLPs. Importantly, we did not observe a significant decrease in egress of either eVP40 or mVP40 VLPs in the presence of WW-domain deletion mutant BAG3-\u0394N (Fig 5A, compare lanes 1 and 2; Fig 5C, compare lanes 1 and 3). Intriguingly, the inhibitory effect of BAG3 appeared to be more pronounced on budding of mVP40 VLPs (Fig 5D), compared to that on eVP40 VLPs. This may reflect the presence of a single PPxY L-domain within mVP40 in contrast to the presence of overlapping PTAP and PPxY motifs within eVP40.",

Cell extracts and supernatants were harvested as described above (Fig 6). Appropriate expression levels for all proteins were confirmed by Western blotting of cell extracts (Fig 6, Cells). We observed a clear dose-dependent inhibition of both eVP40 (Fig 6A and 6B) and mVP40 (Fig 6D and 6E) VLPs in the presence of increasing amounts of either BAG3-WT or BAG3-\u0394C. In contrast, increasing expression of WW-domain deletion mutant BAG3-\u0394N had no effect on budding of either eVP40 or mVP40 VLPs (Fig 6C and 6F). Once again, the level of inhibition mediated by BAG3-WT and BAG3-\u0394C appeared to be more pronounced on mVP40 VLPs compared to that on eVP40 VLPs, with mVP40 VLPs being virtually undetectable in samples expressing the highest amounts of BAG3. Taken together, these results demonstrate a functional role for BAG3 as a negative regulator of eVP40 and mVP40 VLP budding via a WW-domain dependent mechanism. To our knowledge, this is the first host WW-domain containing protein shown to inhibit filovirus VP40 egress.",

For this, we used an siRNA approach to knockdown levels of endogenous BAG3 in HEK293T cells expressing eVP40 (Fig 7). HEK293T cells were transfected with eVP40 plus either random or BAG3-specific siRNAs, and both cell extracts and VLPs were harvested and analyzed by Western blotting (Fig 7). We were able to achieve suppression of endogenous BAG3 by approximately 60% (Fig 7A, Cells), which led to a reproducible and significant increase in eVP40 VLP egress compared to control siRNA samples (Fig 7A and 7B). It should be noted that a similar ~3-fold increase was also observed for mVP40 VLPs from cells treated with BAG3-specific siRNAs. These results correlate well with those described above (Figs 5 and 6) and further confirm the inhibitory effect of BAG3 on VP40-mediated budding.",

Representative images of live cells transfected with GFP-eVP40 alone revealed the expected pattern of expression in the cytoplasm with pronounced localization around the cell periphery and in PM projections (Fig 8A, top row). In contrast, the pattern of GFP-eVP40 changed in cells co-expressing BAG3-mCherry, resulting in a more diffuse pattern of cytoplasmic localization with little to no PM projections (Fig 8A, middle and bottom rows). Indeed, this contrast in VP40 localization can be visualized in neighboring cells expressing GFP-eVP40 plus either low or high levels of BAG3-mCherry (Fig 8A, middle row).

Representative images of live HeLa cells once again revealed the typical pattern of GFP-eVP40 predominantly at the PM in cells expressing mCherry-LC3, but lacking expression of BAG3-WT (Fig 8B, top row). Once again, the altered and more diffuse cytoplasmic pattern of GFP-eVP40 was observed in cells co-expressing BAG3-WT and mCherry-LC3; however, in addition, a fraction of GFP-eVP40 was observed to co-localize with mCherry-LC3 in puncta most likely representing cellular aggresomes (Fig 8B, bottom two rows).

In contrast, eVP40 localization at the PM was less pronounced in the presence of BAG3-WT compared to control cells (Fig 9E, middle row). Importantly, the PM localization pattern of eVP40 in the presence of BAG3-\u0394N (Fig 9E, bottom row) was virtually identical to that in cells expressing eVP40 alone (top row). The levels of eVP40, BAG3-WT and BAG3-\u0394N detected at the cell surface by indirect immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy correlate well with results from the cell fractionation studies. Taken together, our results suggest that the general mechanism by which BAG3 inhibits VLP egress is unique and involves sequestration of a fraction of eVP40 away from the PM and into aggresomes in a PPxY/WW domain-dependent manner. Although we focused on the PM, it is important to note that we cannot completely rule out the possibility that sequestration of eVP40 away from internal membranes may also contribute to the mechanism by which BAG3 inhibits VLP egress.",

Toward this end, we utilized our live infectious VSV recombinants; VSV-M40 and VSV-M40-P2728A [10]. Recombinant VSV-M40 expresses the WT L-domain motifs (PTAPPEY) and flanking residues from eVP40 in place of the L-domain of VSV M protein and buds efficiently, whereas recombinant VSV-M40-P2728A expresses mutated eVP40 L-domain motifs (PTAAAEY) and is budding defective [10]. Briefly, HEK293T cells were first transfected with vector alone, BAG3-WT, or BAG3-\u0394N for 24 hours, and then infected with either VSV-M40 or VSV-M40-P2728A at an MOI of 0.1 for 8 hours (peak time of budding). Infected cell extracts were analyzed by Western blot for expression controls, and virus production was quantified by standard plaque assay (Fig 10). We found that the levels of infectious VSV-M40 released from mock- and BAG3-\u0394N-transfected cells were virtually identical; however, titers of VSV-M40 released from cells expressing BAG3-WT were consistently and significantly reduced by >50% compared to controls (Fig 10A). In contrast, expression of BAG3-WT did not have any significant effect on budding of mutant VSV-M40-P2728A (Fig 10C). Importantly, these data demonstrate that the inhibitory effect of BAG3 on budding extends to infectious virus, and confirms the involvement of the viral PPxY/BAG3 WW-domain interaction in this negative regulatory mechanism.",

Three minimal functional domains of VP40 are required for efficient VLP egress, including a membrane (M) binding region, a self-interaction (I) domain, and one or more late (L) domain motifs. The L-domain motifs hijack or recruit specific host cell proteins that facilitate or promote efficient virus-cell separation [3,4,6,48\u201353]. Here, we have identified host WW-domain containing protein BAG3 as a novel interactor with the PPxY L-domain motif of both eVP40 and mVP40. Moreover, we confirmed the physical and functional interaction between the WW-domain of BAG3 and the viral PPxY L-domain motif by using L-domain and WW-domain mutants in GST-pulldowns, co-immunoprecipitation, siRNA analysis, and/or VLP/virus budding assays. Intriguingly, unlike previously identified host WW-domain proteins that interact with VP40, including Nedd4 [2,28,32,35] and ITCH [37], BAG3 is the first host WW-domain interactor to negatively regulate egress of eVP40 and mVP40 VLPs, as well as infectious virus containing the eVP40 PPxY L-domain motif.",

            "text": "BAG3 is a member of the BAG family of proteins (BAG1-BAG6) which are characterized by a BAG domain that interacts with the ATPase domain of heat shock protein (HSP) 70 [54]. BAG3 is the only member of this family that contains a single N-terminal WW-domain. As a co-chaperone and cell survival protein, BAG3 regulates multiple cell pathways, including, apoptosis, autophagy, cell development and cytoskeleton organization [45,55,56]. Indeed, BAG3 is induced under conditions of cell stress and plays a major role in sequestering misfolded and/or foreign proteins to the proteasome for degradation by CMA [45,55,56]. Our data imply that the CMA function of BAG3 acts as a novel host defense/response mechanism to sequester a fraction of VP40 from the site of budding at the PM and into aggresomes, thus reducing VLP/virus egress and spread. Whether sequestration of VP40 away from the PM results in degradation of VP40 remains to be determined. Interestingly, selective autophagy of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER-phagy) was recently shown to regulate EBOV replication in murine cells [57].",

Indeed, BAG3 has been shown to regulate an aggresome-targeting pathway by interacting with the microtubule-motor dynein to selectively direct target proteins to the aggresome [56,59,70]. A more precise determination of whether sequestration of VP40 correlates with its degradation, and/or whether BAG3 may disrupt trafficking of VP40 along the cytoskeletal architecture of the cell to the PM, remains to be determined. Since BAG3 interacts with the viral PPxY motif, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that BAG3 may competitively inhibit VP40 from interacting with other host WW-domain containing proteins such as E3 ubiquitin ligases, Nedd4 and ITCH, which may impair ubiquitination and subsequent egress of VP40 VLPs. This is likely not the primary mechanism of budding inhibition since the intracellular localization of VP40 was altered significantly in the presence of BAG3 as judged by PM fractionation and confocal microscopy.",

As a stress-induced, cell survival protein, BAG3 may represent a key component of a novel host defense mechanism to dampen virus egress via CMA and protein sequestration. These findings provide new insights into the roles that host proteins play in regulating filovirus VP40-mediated egress, and a more comprehensive understanding of these virus-host interactions may be helpful in the design of future antiviral therapies. For example, it may be possible to identify small molecules that could bind to VP40 in a manner that mimics the inhibitory effect of BAG3. Alternatively, the WW domain of BAG3 alone (per se) could be used to inhibit VLP and virus egress as documented previously for cis-expressed YAP WW domain that inhibited PPxY-mediated budding of Rous Sarcoma virus [71].",
