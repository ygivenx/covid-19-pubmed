            "text": "Lectins are proteins found in nature. This can have several disadvantages, including expensive production and scaling-up, poor oral bioavailability, hemagglutination of human red blood cells, mitogenic activity, cellular toxicity and stimulation of differentiation/activation markers.11,12 The cyanobacterial lectin cyanovirin is a well-known example for several of these properties.13 However, these potential compromising properties are highly dependent on the exact nature of the particular lectin. For example, many lectins agglutinate red blood cells derived from several animal species such as mice, rats, rabbits, but not of human origin.11,14 Microvirin, an alpha(1,2)-mannose-specific lectin from Microcystis aeruginosa has been shown to have comparable anti-HIV activity as cyanovirin, but a much higher safety profile. It proved 50-fold less cytotoxic than cyanovirin, and it did not increase the level of activation markers in CD4+ T lymphocytes.15 Also, the highly potent antiviral red algal lectin griffithsin was reported to have an outstanding safety and efficacy profile as a potential microbicidal drug candidate.16 It induces only minimal changes in secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by epithelial cells and human PBMCs, does not markedly upregulate T cell activation markers and gene expression, and has no measurable effect on cell viability. Even in the case of the mitogenic activity of a particular lectin such as the banana lectin BanLec, it was recently shown that its mitogenic activity could be uncoupled from its antiviral activity by engineering this lectin through site-directed mutagenesis. Thus, lectins can be modulated to remove a non-desirable activity (i.e. mitogenicity) while preserving a beneficial activity (i.e. antiviral activity).17 Moreover, since carbohydrate-binding agents such as lectins are prime candidate drugs for preventing sexually-transmitted viral infections (i.e. HIV, HBV, HCV, herpes viruses), oral bioavailability of such drugs is not required, and it can even be an advantage to have poor absorption through cell layers in order to avoid undesired systemic side effects.18 Evidence that lectins can realistically be used to treat pathogen infections in vivo has recently been provided by several investigators. Scalable manufacture of cyanovirin19 and griffithsin20 and validation of the safety and antiviral efficacy of griffithsin in mice and rabbits as a topical microbicide has been reported by O'Keefe et al.,21,22 Takebe et al.,23 Kouokam et al.,24 Farr Zuend et al.25 and Girard et al.26 Interestingly, Castillo-Acosta et al.27 recently demonstrated that Pradimicin, a mannose-specific agent purified from Actinomyces madura, can cure mice suffering from acute sleeping sickness caused by trypanosomes.",

The EC50 values for legume lectins (ConBr, ConM, DLasiL and DsclerL) were found to be in the nanomolar range and were generally somewhat lower (higher activity) for HIV-1 than HIV-2 (2- to 4-fold).

The EC50 values to prevent giant cell formation in the co-cultures in the presence of different concentrations of the lectins proved to be quite similar to the range of EC50 values for HIV-1 infection in the previously mentioned set (Table 1). These results indicate that leguminous lectins most likely block the adsorption/entry of the virus in the infection step, presumably by binding to the heavily glycosylated gp120/gp41 that is expressed on persistently HIV-1-infected HUT78/HIV1 cells. The antiviral activity concentrations of the leguminous lectins were usually well below their toxicity threshold (Table 1).",

These preliminary SPR studies suggest that HIV-encoded surface glycoproteins are potential antiviral targets for the lectins. No attempt was made to determine binding constants (KD) and related association (ka) and dissociation (kd) rates since the interpretation of data is complicated by the known auto-proteolysis of the leguminous lectins (Fig. S1\u2020). The glycoproteins were bound on the sensor chip surface and binding of lectins flowing over the surface was recorded. The mannose-specific red algae-derived griffithsin lectin was used as a positive control for the assay. We selected only those lectins with promising EC50 values against HIV-1 including DLasiL, DSclerL, ConBr, ConM, SfL and HML. The leguminous lectins (DLasiL, DSclerL, ConBr, ConM) appeared to show higher binding to the three glycoproteins than the algal (SfL, HML) lectins (Table S1\u2020). Also, the lectins appeared to bind to a higher extent to gp120 and gp41. Interestingly, there appears to be a positive correlation between the antiviral potential of the lectins in both primary infection and co-cultivation assays, and the binding of the lectins to gp120, gp41 and CD4. These preliminary SPR studies suggest that HIV-encoded surface glycoproteins are potential antiviral targets for the lectins and that future detailed measurements on a low density ligand sensor chip to determine KD, ka and kd values would be worthwhile, if the problems of auto-proteolysis and glycation can be controlled.",

Surprisingly, DLasiL, which was highly active against HIV, showed the poorest activity against all influenza virus strains.

At the surface of the virus, the glycosylated glycoproteins gp120 and gp41 are imbedded in, and part of, the viral envelope at the start of the infection. Glycoprotein gp120 binds to the CD4 receptor present on T-cells. CD4 binding induces changes in gp120 resulting in the exposure of envelope domains, which were previously hidden at the moment it binds to the host cells. Such uncovered domains may then bind to the CXCR4 or CCR5 co-receptors on the cell membrane. It is difficult for antibodies to reach the initially-uncovered surface protein domains efficiently, which also means that efficient vaccines are not available yet for HIV.31 The HIV surface glycoprotein gp120 is one of the most heavily glycosylated proteins known so far, and its molecular weight consists of \u223c50% of glycans. Therefore, targeting these glycans by carbohydrate-binding agents (CBAs) has been proposed earlier as a potential therapeutic approach to suppress HIV.32 Indeed, due to their high specificity for binding to carbohydrate chains on cell surfaces, lectins are widely studied in the glycobiology field, and participate in many important physiological processes.31 Several lectins have been reported as antiviral agents, but relatively few types of viruses have been investigated so far.9 The best-studied cases of lectins with potent antiviral (i.e. HIV) activity have been the cyanobacterial cyanovirin N algal lectin and the red algal lectin griffithsin, which have picomolar potency against HIV-1.33 Interestingly, several lectins with anti-HIV activity show recognition of different carbohydrates. For example, Polygonatum citronella and Ophiopogon japonicus lectins have affinity for sialic acid.31,34 Griffithsin binds to mannose/glucose structures, cyanovirin N predominantly binds to alpha(1,2)-mannose structures, Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA) and Hippeastrum hybrid agglutinin exhibit \u03b1(1,3)/\u03b1(1,6)-mannose-binding activity33 and Musa acuminata agglutinin (BanLec) binds to high mannose carbohydrate structures.35 The latter lectins showed different degrees of anti-viral activity in the high picomolar range (i.e. griffithsin) or low nanomolar range.33 They block viral entry as the major mechanism of antiviral activity.",

These findings are highly suggestive for virus adsorption/entry as the underlying mechanism of antiviral action. The binding of the lectins to HIV-1 gp120 (and gp41), as measured by SPR, and the marked positive correlation between binding of gp120 (and gp41) and antiviral activity strongly corroborate this hypothesis. The fact that the lectins also measurably bind to CD4 might explain their strong overall anti-HIV activity, but may make these lectins somewhat less selective than griffithsin (that strongly binds to gp120/gp41, but interacts poorly with CD4). Further studies should reveal whether the additional binding of the lectins to CD4 eventually turns-out to be an advantage (in terms of antiviral efficacy), or a disadvantage (in terms of potential side-effects).",

In particular the influenza A strains are very susceptible to antigenic drift and/or shift. They are subdivided based on the type of envelope substructures, e.g. influenza virus type A consisting of a well-defined hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), which can be subdivided into 18 (H1\u2013H18) and 11 (N1\u2013N11) types.55 Influenza virus binds to sialic acid structures present on the host cell surface, through the viral envelope.6 According to the literature, humans and other vertebrates including wild birds, bats and pigs, can contract these type of viruses. Their infection can become pandemic and has been responsible for more than fifty million deaths. They can also cause highly destructive loss in domestic poultry and pose risks for humans.6,55 Lectin ESA-2 from red alga Eucheuma serra inhibits infection by influenza A H1N1, with an EC50 of 12 nM, by recognizing high mannose N-glycans (HM) on the HA surface glycoprotein.40 ConA also binds to HM glycans and showed a somewhat weaker activity with an EC50 of 41 nM, while lectins from Aspergillus oryzae (AOL) and Aleuria aurantia (AAL) that bind to fucose were less potent with EC50 values of 50 to 100 nM.40 Our results are quite remarkable, since we identified a leguminous lectin DSclerL, with exquisitely high activity against influenza A (H3N2) infection with an EC50 as low as 0.4\u20131.2 nM (Table 2). Also, ConM exhibited very low EC50 values (high activity) of 0.2 to 1.5 nM against influenza A (H3N2) and influenza B viruses. Beyond that, a high degree of selectivity for these lectins regarding their target influenza virus strain, was noticed, which, for ConM, showed about 50-fold higher activity toward influenza A (H3N2) than influenza A (H1N1) (Table 2). These striking differences in antiviral potential between different strains of influenza virus may most likely be due to (often subtle) differences in glycan structures and glycan content on the HA and/or NEU surface glycoproteins.",

The lectins DLasiL, DSclerL, ConBr, ConM, SfL and HML were used at 100 nM in PBS (pH 7.4), except for DLasiL and HML that were also used at 500 nM, and injected for 2 min onto the gp120-, gp41-, CD4-bound surface of a CM5 sensor chip at a flow rate of 5 \u03bcL min\u20131 (association phase). Then, the change of the SPR response was monitored at 25 \u00b0C for another 8 min in the absence of the compound (dissociation phase). For immobilization, gp120, gp41 and CD4 were immobilized at 4690, 2300 and 5569 RU's in 10 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.0).",
