This coronavirus is genetically related, but not identical, to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus which emerged in southern China in 2002 [1]. As of 21 March 2017, 1,917 human cases have been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) with at least 684 deaths [2]. Most zoonotic infections have occurred in the Arabian Peninsula, particularly in Saudi Arabia, although nosocomial outbreaks arising from travellers coming from the Arabian Peninsula have been reported in Africa, Asia, Europe and North America. For example, between May and June 2015, 186 human infections in South Korea arose from one returning traveller [3], highlighting the cause for global public health concern.",

Dromedary camels are strongly suspected to be the source of human infections [4]. It is believed that humans can get infected via direct contact with mucous membranes of infected camels [5,6] or by consuming unpasteurised camel milk [7]. However, the virus has not been detected in camel urine [8] or in raw camel meat [9]. Secondary infections in humans are reported, especially within nosocomial settings [10,11] or to a smaller extent, within households [12], suggesting that human-to-human transmission may become efficient enough to trigger outbreaks beyond the current epicentre in the Middle East. The WHO has identified MERS-CoV as one of the pathogens of greatest concern for global public health for which few or no medical countermeasures exist [13]. To date there are no vaccines or antivirals available for MERS-CoV in humans [14]. Camel vaccines have given promising results with the use of a vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vectored vaccine [15].",

High levels of seropositivity and virus detection rates have been observed in dromedary camels in the Arabian Peninsula [16,17]. MERS coronaviruses detected in camels are genetically very similar or identical to those infecting humans [18]. MERS-CoV antibodies have also been detected in dromedary camel populations of many countries outside the Arabian Peninsula. Serological studies in Africa indicate high seropositivity rates and the testing of retrospectively collected serum samples provide evidence that this virus has been infecting camels in East Africa since as early as 1983 [19]. More recent specimens collected between 2009 and 2013 show high rates of detection of MERS-CoV antibodies in camels in Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Sudan and Tunisia and also in the Canary Islands [20,21].",

Possible reasons for the absence of reports of MERS-CoV infections in humans in Africa may include (i) underdiagnosis in humans due to a possible lack of awareness, lack of viral diagnostic capacity and weak healthcare systems, (ii) differences in virus strains or in camel breeds resulting in low infectiousness towards humans, (iii) differences in cultural practices in interaction between humans and dromedary camels, or any combination of these. Research recommendations from workshops on MERS-CoV in Doha April and Cairo May 2015, organised by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), the Organisation of the United Nations for Animal Health (OIE) and the WHO identified the apparent absence of human MERS-CoV infections in Africa despite intense virus circulation among dromedaries as a key research question [23]. In order to address this question, it is important to understand the ecological and farming husbandry factors that may promote the likelihood of MERS-CoV infection in camels in Africa.",

            "text": "Nomadic, sedentary, mixed lifestyles and extensive, semi-extensive and intensive camel breeding systems occur in African ecosystems. Extensive system/nomadic lifestyle are characterised by the use of natural resources, low inputs, and herd mobility [24]. However, camel husbandry practices and the use of camels have changed in the last five decades in the following ways: (i) increasing camel populations in settled livestock farming systems, (ii) use of camels in agriculture-related work, (iii) camel trade being more closely market integrated and (iv) increasing importance of camels for the sustainability and resilience of farms which traditionally relied on cattle [25]. These changing camel herding practices lead to sedentary or mixed lifestyles with intensive or semi-intensive camel production systems (milk, meat, skin etc.) [26]. Usually, camel calves are suckled by their mother during the first year of life. Camels are considered as young and sexually immature until 2\u20134 years-old. Males represent 20 to 40% of the herd [27]. Adult males are separated from females and young camels in non-extensive systems because of their aggressiveness associated with sexual behaviour. In extensive systems, the male is let with non-lactating females for reproduction only and during the rutting season. The contacts of adult males with young (less than 4 years-old) camels is not common.",

The results from the abattoirs were not included in the risk factor modelling due to the difficulty to get reliable information on the farms where the animals were raised. However, data from the abattoir were included for the statistical modelling of geographical variations of serological and virological rates. Indeed, the presence of an abattoir in a region may strongly influence the likelihood of infection in that region. In the statistical models, the dependent variable was binary: the serological and virological status of an individual was designated either positive or negative according to the result of the tests presented above. Because individuals were aggregated in herds, independence of statistical units was questionable. Herd random effects were thus included in the models. Goodness of fit was assessed through the Pearson overdispersion test [31].

Higher seropositivity rate was found in large or medium size herds as compared with small herds, suggesting that the transmission of the virus is density dependent. More studies are now necessary to better describe the virus transmission dynamics within herds and between herds, with mechanistic models accounting for a disease transmitted through close contact and the possibility of reinfections [38]. Such a model would allow to determine the minimum size of a camel herd required for the MERS-CoV to persist in that herd without \u2018fadeouts\u2019: i.e. critical community size [39].",

The higher seropositivity rate in females bred for milking could be related to the high viral RNA detection rates in younger animals, e.g. calves [37]. A plausible hypothesis could indeed be that young camels who lack antibodies have a high probability of being infected and in turn expose the mothers to infection or reinfection. The lower seropositivity rate in camels bred for their meat or for transport activities, which are mostly males, could also be linked with the fact that males are often separated from the herd (the two sexes are only mixed during the reproduction activities) and have thus less contacts with other camels (i.e. females and calves).",

Firstly, the sedentary lifestyle is found in animal production systems where animals live at high density in \u2018commercial\u2019 farms. In such situations the virus may be introduced more easily to the herd with animals being bought from other sources and the virus once introduced will amplify to infect most of the susceptible animals, since they are in close contact with each other. The virus appears to have a density dependent transmission pattern. In contrast to this, nomads are long-distance travellers who connect different regions. Consequently they have multiple opportunities to come into contact with other camel populations during their travels, or through indirect contacts with water points and thus increasing the probability of encountering animals shedding MERS-CoV. In support to these interpretations, the lowest seroprevalence was found for the mixed lifestyle which is associated with medium herd sizes and relatively small range movements.",

Such data contribute to understanding factors contributing to MERS-CoV infection in camels, which in turn might also have an effect on zoonotic infection. While we carried out our study in different parts of Africa, due to the fact that we have encompassed diverse geographical and ecological variables, our study findings may well be relevant in regions such as Saudi Arabia where zoonotic MERS remains a recurrent threat. Furthermore, it is not clear that transmission of MERS-CoV to humans is absent in Africa. A recent study has reported evidence of humans with MERS-CoV seropositivity in Kenya [22]. Further studies are needed to assess whether or not zoonotic MERS-CoV transmission occurs in Africa and our epidemiological data provide identification of situations of highest risk. Better understanding of the risk factors and virus transmission dynamics of MERS-CoV within camels is important in responding to the global health threat posed by MERS-CoV.",
