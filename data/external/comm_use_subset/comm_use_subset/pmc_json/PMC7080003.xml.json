Up to 7 November 2014, there have been 935 laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV human infections, including 371 deaths, in 23 countries [1] (Figure 1). All cases have occurred in individuals in the Middle East, or in persons with recent travel to the Middle East, or who had contact with a person who had traveled to the Middle East [2]. Two thirds of all reported cases have been in males, and the outbreak peaked in April 2014 [2]. Since then, the number of reported cases has been decreasing, and human infections now appear to be sporadic (Figure 1).",

            "text": "Infection with MERS-CoV generally presents as an influenza-like illness. Typically, MERS rapidly progresses to viral pneumonia about a week after the onset of the infection [3]. Individuals with underlying chronic conditions or immunosuppression are at higher risk of severe disease [4]. MERS-CoV infection has mortality rate of 35\u201350% [5]. There is a lack of proven effective therapies and possible therapeutic are based on therapies used for SARS coronavirus, a phylogenetically related virus [6]. MERS is caused by a newly identified \u03b2-coronavirus, lineage C [7]. MERS-CoV genomes are phylogenetically classified into two clades, clade A and B clusters [8]. The viral genomes detected in the earliest human infections (clade A) are genetically distinct from the others (clade B). Taxonomically, MERS-CoV belongs to the same viral species as the African Neoromicia capensis bat coronavirus (NeoCoV) [9] with which it shares 85% of its genome at the nucleotide level [9] and up to 95% homology for genes encoding structural proteins [9]. Although infections with MERS-CoV and SARS coronavirus have similar clinical presentations, the two viruses belong to different lineages [10]. While the SARS coronavirus can be aerosolized [11] and sustained airborne transmission is possible [11,12], MERS-CoV human-to-human transmission has so far been limited and unsustained [13]. Recent camel and human MERS-CoV genetic sequences show no significant mutations compared with previous sequences from this outbreak [2], and the virus does not appear to have adapted toward sustained human-to-human transmission [14]. The current patterns of MERS-CoV transmission suggest repeated introduction of the virus in the human population with limited, unsustained human-to human transmission, mainly in hospitals, and in close family members [2], both of which are self-limiting because of the low reproductive number of the virus [14].",

            "text": "Camels are thought to be an important reservoir for MERS-CoV. Anti-MERS-CoV antibodies have been detected in samples that have been collected from dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia since 1992 [15] and the genomes of MERS-CoV viruses isolated from camels and humans are similar [16]. Phylogenetic data suggest that camels act as sources of virus for humans rather than vice versa [9]. In Egypt, over 90% of camels had antibody to MERS-CoV [17] and 3.6% were hosting the virus at the time of screening [7], suggesting that it is commonly circulating in the camel population. The virus has not been isolated from other mammal species tested [17]. Strengthening the hypothesis that camels infect humans, MERS-CoV with an identical sequence was identified in a camel herd and its owner who died of severe respiratory disease [18]. Early results from an ongoing investigation in Qatar suggest that compared with others, those working closely with camels were at higher risk of MERS-CoV infection [19]. The route of transmission between humans and camels is however not established [19]. MERS-CoV RNA and anti-MERS-CoV antibodies have been isolated from camel milk [20] and camels have been shown to shed the virus through nasal secretions and feces [20]. The similarity between genetic sequences of the viruses isolated from humans and camels suggests direct transmission from camels to humans [14]. These findings are not direct evidence for a transmission route, and identifying direct or indirect transmission routes from camels to humans is crucial to stop disease transmission [19]. No consistent pattern of animal exposure has been observed among cases [14]. Clusters of human-to human transmission are well-documented, but are restricted to close contact within a family [21,22] or are healthcare-associated, where other patients and healthcare workers have been infected [23\u201325]. Healthcare clusters account for the majority of cases [19]. No community-wide outbreaks have been documented after extensive follow up of contacts of confirmed cases [25], and only two tertiary cases have been reported [19]. MERS-CoV was circulating in Saudi Arabia during several mass gathering events (Hajj pilgrimage in 2012 and 2013, Umrah in 2013), with no outbreaks among pilgrims reported during those events [26] in spite of extensive surveillance [27]. In light of the lack of sustained human-to-human transmission, in its latest risk assessment in October 2014 the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) deemed the risk of human infection and sustained transmission in Europe to be low [2]. WHO has recommended that no specific screening or restriction to travel or trade are necessary [19]. In October 2014, the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee concluded that the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) have not yet been met [28]. As the estimated reproductive number is below one [29], MERS-CoV does not appear to have pandemic potential.",

Epidemiological analysis of the distribution of cases over time suggests MERS-CoV could be seasonal, with an upsurge expected in the spring [28]. The spring peak corresponds to the end of camel calving season in Saudi Arabia [30], potentially suggesting a particular role for young camels in zoonotic transmission. This theory is supported by the higher frequency of infection and higher viral shedding in young camels compared with older ones [15,31\u201332]. The majority of reported cases have likely occurred through contact with another case, and only about a fourth of all cases are considered as primary [19]. Since the onset of the outbreak, the proportion of cases acquired from other humans has increased, which has been hypothesized by some to be caused by an increase in transmissibility [19]. There are several knowledge gaps surrounding the transmission of the virus. For example, there are reported cases with no recorded animal contact nor contact with other human cases [19]; and despite a low reproductive number, the virus still circulates in the human population more than 2 years after the initial case was reported. In contrast, the SARS coronavirus, which had a higher reproductive number, remained in the human population for less than a year [26]. Of further concern, rapid onset nosocomial outbreaks with a reproductive number over one have been recorded [23] and the virus has been isolated in the air of a camel barn where transmission occurred [33] raising the question of airborne transmission. Airborne transmission or sustained human-to-human transmission would profoundly alter the nature of the outbreak, with a much more severe impact and international spread.",

Up to November 2014, MERS-CoV has been mainly sporadic [2]. Ongoing surveillance will allow detection of any increase in disease. Early detection of a disease peak, should one occur in the future, may enable early response, thus limiting spread and mitigating the impact. Furthermore, analyzing routine surveillance data for patterns of transmission may help to identify sustained human-to-human transmission, were it to occur. Early detection of such an event would be key to preventing a much larger outbreak. Although human infection is thought to have only originated in the Middle East, worldwide surveillance is important as camels harboring antibodies to MERS-CoV have been identified in other parts of the world, specifically Ethiopia, Nigeria, Kenya and Spain (Canary Islands) [38\u201340]. WHO has identified the detection of early human-to-human transmission and the identification of geographical risk areas as two key MERS-CoV surveillance objectives [40]. An integrated, one health approach to MERS-CoV surveillance involving communicable disease surveillance in humans and veterinary services is essential, ensuring systematic communication between the two, especially in \u2018hotspots\u2019 areas such as the Middle East and other areas with a significant camel population, especially where humans and camels are in close contact. Although camels have been identified as a reservoir for the virus, it is possible that there are other unidentified species asymptomatically hosting the virus.

The current definition of probable cases focuses on respiratory symptoms and epidemiological links to either another confirmed case or travel or residence in the affected region [19]. While most reported MERS-CoV cases presented with severe respiratory infection, atypical presentations, such as gastrointestinal symptoms have occurred, particularly in immunocompromised individuals, creating a diagnostic challenge for clinicians [25]. As the understanding of the disease constantly progresses, such evidence should be considered when revising case definitions. There is a risk otherwise that infected individuals could be admitted to hospital without a suspicion of MERS-CoV infection, thus infecting unsuspecting healthcare workers and other patients. In May 2013, the French case definition was changed to include severe febrile clinical signs, including febrile diarrhea in immunocompromised persons or in those with chronic underlying conditions, returning from an at-risk country [25]. Understanding and monitoring MERS-CoV must extend beyond analyzing notified MERS-CoV cases. The ECDC advises that any person diagnosed with an acute respiratory infection and having been possibly exposed to MERS-CoV by visiting affected countries, working in an affected facility, having contact with dromedary camels or being part of an unexplained cluster of severe respiratory infections should be tested for MERS-CoV [2]. This approach ensures the detection of the emergence of MERS-CoV in a different part of the world.",

This suggests that, although there is no sustained human-to-human-transmission, the majority of cases are acquired from another person. In addition, a third of cases with an onset between May 2013 and May 2014 were healthcare workers [4]. Therefore, strict case management, and particularly strict infection control measures should be implemented in order to decrease the incidence of infection. WHO recommendations include the early triage and isolation of suspected cases, regular cleaning and disinfection of hospital rooms, restrictions on the number of visitors and healthcare workers in contact with suspected or confirmed cases, the use of hand hygiene, the use of personal protective equipment, including particulate respirators and face shields, the use of ventilated rooms and restricting patient movement [43]. WHO has also issued recommendations for care at home [44].",

In April 2014, the number of reported cases increased more than fourfold compared with the previous month, to more than 140. In contrast only two cases were reported between 10 July and 20 August 2014 [2]. These variations are not yet understood. In light of this, continuing and regular risk assessments are necessary in order to tailor advice locally and internationally to an evolving situation. ECDC's 12th risk assessment was released in October 2014 and WHO's latest was in June 2014. Regular updates are important, to ensure the situation is actively monitored, and are still useful to the international community even if the level of risk remains constant. The International Health Regulations emergency committee has had seven meetings on MERS-CoV between July 2013 and October 2014. Regularly reassessing whether MERS-CoV meets the conditions to be declared a Public Health Event of International Concern will enable the timely introduction of evidence-based prevention measures in the event the criteria are met. While these conditions are not met, regular statements from the International Health Regulations committee reinforce the message that travel restrictions are not required, thus potentially mitigating any economic impact caused by planned cancellation of trade or travel arrangements. Even as the risk remains constant, WHO's re-iteration of recommendations around good infection control and prevention practice, enhanced surveillance around religious pilgrimages in Saudi Arabia, harmonization of testing algorithms and veterinary surveillance [28] ensure that heightened awareness is maintained.",

Even in the context of limited human-to-human transmission, nosocomial MERS-CoV outbreaks are not rare events and have been reported in Saudi Arabia [23], Qatar, Jordan [45] the United Arab emirates [46], the UK [47] and France [25]. In order to prevent such events, hospitals should prepare for the possibility of receiving MERS-CoV patients and have a plan in place to ensure the virus does not spread to other patients or to healthcare workers. The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention have designed preparedness checklist for healthcare facilities [48] and frontline healthcare providers [49] that help prevent the introduction of a patient with MERS-CoV in a healthcare facility without a diagnosis. Other countries, especially those with a high volume of travel to and from the Middle East, should have similar preparedness checklists in place.",
