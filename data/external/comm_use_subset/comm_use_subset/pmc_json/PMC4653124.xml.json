            "text": "The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was initially identified in September 2012 from samples obtained from a Saudi Arabian patient who developed severe acute respiratory infection and subsequent acute renal failure leading to death (Zaki et al. 2012). As of September 30, 2015, a total of 1589 cases have been identified with 567 related deaths (World Health Orgnization 2015). To date, there is no specific treatment of proven effect for MERS-CoV infection. Public Health England and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC) have published a decision support tool for clinicians managing cases of MERS-CoV infection. The document suggests that current evidence is strongest for testing convalescent plasma (CP) or other therapeutics which contain neutralizing antibodies (such as hyperimmune immunoglobulin) for treatment of serious MERS-CoV illness (Public Health England 2015). Prior experience in SARS and severe influenza suggest that CP may be considered for patients who are deteriorating (despite other specific and supportive therapy) and in whom the virus remains detectable (Hung et al. 2011; Luke et al. 2006; Cheng et al. 2005; Kong and Zhou 2006; Yeh et al. 2005). A recent systematic review of 32 reports from SARS and severe influenza concluded that CP therapy appears safe and may reduce mortality, especially if administered early in the illness (Mair-Jenkins et al. 2015). An exploratory post hoc meta-analysis showed a statistically significant reduction in the pooled odds of mortality following treatment compared to placebo or no therapy (odds ratio 0.25; 95 % confidence interval 0.14\u20130.45; I2 = 0 %) (Mair-Jenkins et al. 2015). Citing case series, the authors commented that (1) patients with severe presentations appeared to demonstrate temporal clinical improvements after treatment with CP and (2) administration as early as possible in the diseases course appears to be associated with greatest potential clinical effect. One randomized clinical trial (RCT) in critically ill influenza A (H1N1pdm09)-infected patients found a survival benefit when hyperimmune globulin was administered within 5 days of symptom onset (Hung et al. 2013).",

While an RCT will be required to evaluate effectiveness, evaluating effectiveness on clinical endpoints such as mortality will likely require several hundred to several thousand seriously ill MERS-CoV patients in order to achieve sufficient statistical power, anticipating reasonable potential effect sizes. Additionally, CP from different MERS-CoV survivors will likely contain differing levels of neutralizing anti-MERS-CoV antibodies. Since seriously ill MERS-CoV-infected patients may have detectable viral RNA in various locations that can be sampled (for example lower respiratory tract secretions) for prolonged periods, it might be possible to first determine the relationship between neutralizing antibody dose and antiviral effects on clinical and laboratory features in a small open-label study. This information would be very helpful to design of an RCT and in determining the most appropriate neutralizing antibody dose, or dosing range for the study. This may also inform dose selection for follow-on anti-MERS-CoV antibody preparations currently in pre-clinical development (for example, neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal human neutralizing immunoglobulin derived from transchromosomic cattle (personal communication, Thomas C. Luke).",

In the CP collection phase subjects will be enrolled from 4 different cohorts, in order to explore all potential donors. It is unknown, at this point, which subjects are likely to have high antibody titers and therefore be CP donors. We are hoping that this feasibility study will help identifying a group of superdonors who have very high titers. By identifying the characteristics of such individuals, a more focused approach for donation can be followed. The CP therapy phase is not designed to establish efficacy; such objective requires an adequately powered randomized controlled trial. However, we believe performing this feasibility study is an essential step to examine the safety, clinical and laboratory effects and the pharmacokinetics of the MERS-CoV antibody response. The study involves giving critically ill patients this therapy in a controlled monitored setting. However, a recent systematic review suggested that early treatment with CP is likely to be more effective than late treatment (Mair-Jenkins et al. 2015). Therefore, if the feasibility study shows that CP is safe and feasible, the next step should be a randomized controlled trial that is sufficiently powered to detect effect on mortality and enrolls patients early in the course of the disease.",
