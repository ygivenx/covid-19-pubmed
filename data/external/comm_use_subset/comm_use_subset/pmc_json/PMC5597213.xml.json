Dromedary camels (camels), also known as Arabian or one-humped camels, inhabit the Middle East and parts of Africa and constitute 94% of all the camels on earth [1]. Like other animals, camels are frequently infected with viruses, but the risk of camel-to-human spread was thought to be low until the recent emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), apparently from camels [2\u20134]. Before 2013, viruses of at least ten virus families, including Nairoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Flaviviridae, Herpesviridae, Papillomaviridae, Picornaviridae, Poxviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Reoviridae and Rhabdoviridae, have been found to infect dromedary and Bactrian camels [5\u201313].",

The discovery of widespread MERS-CoV infection in camels on the Arabian Peninsula has intensified the search for viruses in camels. In 2014, a human OC43-related betacoronavirus 1 species named dromedary camel coronavirus HKU23 was identified in camels [15]. In 2016, another coronavirus, camel alphacoronavirus (alpha-CoV), was identified in camels, sharing around 90% nucleotide (nt) identity with the human alpha-CoV 229E [16, 17]. Until now, three coronaviruses have been identified in camels: MERS-CoV, human OC43-related camel coronavirus HKU23 and human 229E-related camel alpha-CoV. Camels have been suggested to play an important role in the emergence of MERS-CoV and the evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) [16, 17].",

            "text": "Methods for virus identification in camels have often been based on traditional serological methods and virus isolation, and more recently, molecular detection methods, such as RT-PCR and DNA sequencing have been applied. For example, novel camel enteroviruses and camel astroviruses were identified using RT-PCR [18, 19]. The advancement of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies and metagenomic analysis have facilitated large-scale detection of known and novel viruses from a wide variety of animals such as bats [20, 21], cats [22], ducks [23], pigs [24] and other mammals [25]. NGS was also used to facilitate full genome sequencing of CoVs in nasal swab samples from camels in Saudi Arabia and Kenya [16, 17]. The first and only metagenomic study of the camel virome was carried out by Woo et al. on a pool of fecal samples from 203 adult camels [26]. Woo et al. obtained a total of about 29.25 million 151-bp sequence reads that were assembled into 159,388 contigs. 4.6% of these contigs were viral sequences. More detailed analysis of this pooled fecal sample revealed the presence of known as well as novel species of mammalian viruses from the viral families Picobirnaviridae, Circoviridae, Picornaviridae, Parvoviridae, Astroviridae, Hepeviridae, Reoviridae and Caliciviridae.",

MERS-CoV RNA and antibodies have been detected in camels from UAE [28\u201330]. Molecular epidemiology investigations of the MERS cases and outbreaks in 2013\u20132014 in Abu Dhabi, UAE identified direct links between viruses recovered from human cases and camel MERS-CoV sequences sampled from UAE (publication submitted). In 2015, WHO reported a German MERS patient who was believed to have contracted the virus from an infected camel during a visit to a live animal market in the UAE in February, 2015 [31]. MERS-CoV testing and sequencing in camels from the same market identified almost identical MERS-CoV sequences and also showed a much higher MERS-CoV positive rate (publication submitted). Taken together, these results suggested that camels at UAE live animal markets may actively participate in the spread of MERS-CoV among animals and/or humans and that camel exposure is a risk factor for zoonotic transmission of MERS-CoV and potentially other viral agents.",

Library construction was done either manually or on an automated NGS workstation, Zephyr G3 NGS Workstation (PerkinElmer). Quality of the libraries generated was evaluated using a 2200 TapeStation Nucleic Acid System (Agilent Technologies) and library DNA concentrations were measured using Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Unclassified reads were de novo assembled, and the resulting contigs and unassembled reads were classified based on translated nucleotide similarity to the NCBI NR database. Reads were binned by taxonomy, and the viral reads and contigs classified by either method were assigned, per genus per sample, to the most similar available reference in that genus, using BLAST. In cases where there were more than one virus identified per genus, reads from that genus were mapped using BWA-MEM to an index of the candidate references. For positive hits, we used relative read count thresholds based on an empirical overall barcode contamination rate (0.01%) to exclude hits with low viral read counts when other samples with high read counts for that taxon were sequenced on the same HiSeq lane. In addition, positive hits from the SURPI summary report with fewer than 100 reads were aligned to the NCBI nt database using BLASTN and manually reviewed to ensure the accuracy of virus classification before the final calls were made. The positive samples that had low number of viral reads from NGS were further confirmed by PCRs followed by amplicon sequencing (S2 Table). In addition, all samples were screened for coronaviruses [34], parvoviruses, orthonairoviruses, paramyxoviruses [35], polyomaviruses [36], and astroviruses by PCR for better sensitivity. When possible, BWA-MEM [37] and samtools [38] were used to generate consensus sequences from reads and contigs for phylogenetic analysis and further genomic analysis.",

Thus, it is important to understand the repertoire of viruses that camels harbor and their zoonotic potential. Here we report the first study of camel respiratory viromes. Our results demonstrate that camels carry a wide variety of mammalian viruses. Among the different viruses detected in this study, some were similar or nearly identical to previously described camel viruses (96\u201399.7% nt identity), such as camel MERS-CoV, camel alpha-CoV, camel CoV HKU23, dromedary astrovirus, Camelus dromedarius papillomavirus, Orf virus, and camelpox virus. We also identified viral sequences that were similar or identical (92\u2013100% nt identity) to viruses known to infect humans or animals other than camels, such as AAV, kobuvirus, and caribou feces-associated gemycircularvirus. Some viruses identified in this study, such as camel CCHFV Abu Dhabi, camel PIV3 Abu Dhabi, camel PIV4 Abu Dhabi, and camel bocavirus 3 Abu Dhabi, only shared a moderate similarity to the known viruses (84\u201389% nt identity), and are potentially novel. Complete genome sequencing of these viruses including camel CCHFV Abu Dhabi and camel PIV4 Abu Dhabi would further ascertain whether they should be considered novel strains or novel species. Finally, we identified sequences of a novel camel polyomavirus, camel polyomavirus Abu Dhabi most closely related to a sheep polyomavirus, with 62\u201369% nt identity in different gene regions.",

In this study of camels from a single live animal market in UAE, we identified co-infection of camel alpha-CoV and MERS-CoV at a significantly higher rate of 92.6%, and co-infection of camel alpha-CoV, camel CoV HKU23 and MERS-CoV in 22.2% camels. This higher co-infection rate observed could be due to different camel population tested or sampling bias. Previous studies have shown that inter- and intra-coronavirus species recombination events happen frequently and are important for coronavirus evolution [47, 48]. Natural recombination between distantly related African bat coronaviruses resulted in a NL63-like virus, an ancestor of the human pathogen, human CoV NL63, suggesting that inter-species recombination may play an important role in CoV evolution and the emergence of novel CoVs with zoonotic potential [49]. In camels, recombination events between different MERS-CoV lineages in camels have been reported [17, 50]. A more recent study provided evidence for a cross-viral family recombination of a bat coronavirus and a reovirus [51]. The observation that camels are co-infected with different coronaviruses at a high rate further supports that camels may be a rich source for recombination and emergence of novel coronaviruses.",

The close relationships of these camel viruses to viruses of other species suggest that these viruses may have the capacity to infect multiple species or that they have only recently diverged after cross-species transmission, highlighting the potentially important role that camels play in emergence and evolution of these viruses. This phenomenon might also be a reflection of the fact that these camels were sampled from a live animal market, which houses several other species, such as cattle, sheep, and goats routinely, as well as other animals (chickens, dogs, cats) sporadically. As a result, this camel population may have been particularly prone to exposure to viruses from other species. If these viruses are actively replicating in camels, it is possible that they may act as intermediate hosts, or \u201cstaging grounds,\u201d for these viruses, similar to what has been seen with civets for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [52]. Interestingly, we identified a paramyxovirus genome most closely related to the human virus HPIV4, for the first time in camels.

Coronaviruses and paramyxoviruses were not detected in the camel fecal virome study. On the other hand, picobirnaviruses, rotaviruses, noroviruses, hepatitis E virus, and several picornaviruses were found in the fecal virome study, but were not detected in the present study using the respiratory samples. These differences were likely due to different expected tissue tropisms of the viruses. Moreover, in this study we analyzed individual samples, rather than pools of samples, to capture frequencies of detection and sequence variation among the population for any given virus or viral group (Fig 1, Table 1, S1 Table). One potentially unusual characteristic about the camels in this study is that they were all positive for MERS-CoV with moderate to high viral loads. As a result, the virome in these camels may or may not be representative of the diversity of viruses in normal camels. As a next step, it will be important to look at samples from MERS-CoV-negative camels from the same market to understand the viral diversity and compare the relative prevalence of these viruses.",

            "text": "It is hypothesized that camels are the intermediate animal host that allowed the ancestral MERS-CoV in bats to cross the species barrier to enter humans. A similar mechanism was proposed for SARS-CoV: the bat ancestor SARS-CoV replicated in palm civets as an intermediate and gained the capacity to infect humans [52]. Anthony et al. reported the identification of a MERS-CoV-like CoV from a bat sampled in Uganda and suggested that this virus is unlikely to pose a zoonotic threat as is; rather, recombination was likely the critical step that allowed MERS-CoV to emerge in humans [73]. Additionally, a recent study suggested possible zoonotic transmission of camelpox virus from camels to humans [74]. Therefore, it is important to consider all the viruses that are present in camels and the risk they may pose to humans in close proximity. The data presented here describes camel viruses that are similar to those that are known or thought to cause disease in humans. Multiple viruses were detected in many of the camels, indicating widespread co-infection. The fact that these types of viruses can and do co-exist in the same animal further suggests that camels serve as hosts for the diversification and evolution of mammalian viruses and are intermediate in the transmission of viruses between animals and humans.",
