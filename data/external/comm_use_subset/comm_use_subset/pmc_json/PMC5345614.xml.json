Most of these deaths were the result of thrombotic occlusion of coronary artery, with aneurysmal rupture occurring in ~15% of fatalities. Currently, this disease, referred as to Kawasaki disease (KD), is known to predominantly affect young children (80% of cases occur between 6 months and 4 years) with a male predominance (approximately 1.2\u20131.7 times commoner) 2, 3.",

Indeed, the use of synthetic antibodies derived from oligoclonal IgA gene sequences has identified intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies with virus\u2010like particles in intact tissue sections from children with KD, specifically in the ciliated epithelium of medium\u2010sized bronchi 13. These studies suggested, therefore, a putative viral aetiologic agent as a cause of systemic vasculitis in KD patients. Moreover, pathologic studies identified three distinct, but linked basic KD vascular processes: necrotizing arteritis, subacute chronic vasculitis and luminal myofibroblastic proliferation 15. Necrotizing arteritis is an acute synchronized neutrophilic process of medium\u2010sized arteries that could be responsible for the saccular aneurysms that can lead to the formation of thrombi or ruptures within the first month. It starts at the endothelium of medium\u2010sized muscular and elastic arteries and progresses peripherally. Luminal myofibroblastic proliferation occurs in close association with subacute chronic vasculitis. It is a unique process that involves medial (smooth muscle cell\u2010derived) myofibroblasts and their matrix products, which form a concentric mass that can progressively obstruct the arterial lumen. Both subacute chronic vasculitis and luminal myofibroblastic proliferation can persist for months to years following the onset of KD. Furthermore, giant aneurysms are most likely to develop stenosis resulting from repetitive layering of thrombi, which eventually become occlusive, whereas dilated coronary arteries that preserve some portion of the media most likely undergo luminal myofibroblastic proliferation with or without thrombosis 15.",

For instance, the formation of heterotypic platelet\u2013leucocyte aggregates, which is dependent on platelet activation 16, cannot be ruled out. Leucocyte\u2013RBC\u2013platelet aggregates could at least partially be associated with the release of pro\u2010aggregating factors, e.g. arachidonate 17, and/or with changes in cell surface molecules expression, including P\u2010selectin. This crosstalk between activated platelets and leucocytes operates through several systems, including the interaction of P\u2010selectin with P\u2010selectin glycoprotein ligand\u20101 (PSGL\u20101). P\u2010selectin and PSGL\u20101 are vascular adhesion molecules that play an important role in the inflammatory response by mediating the interaction of leucocytes with stimulated endothelium and platelets bound in the vicinity of vascular injury. P\u2010selectin captures leucocytes from the blood to bring them into contact with the endothelial cell surface on the blood vessel wall, where P\u2010selectin\u2013PSGL\u20101 interaction supports leucocyte rolling 18. On the other hand, neutrophils can interact with adherent platelets and leucocytes in a process called secondary capture, which is often followed by neutrophil\u2013endothelial interactions. During inflammation neutrophils recruited by platelets contribute, through Toll\u2010like receptor 4, to neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation that function as a barometer for systemic infection 19. Importantly, while platelets stimulate NET formation, NETs cause platelet activation and aggregation, thus linking inflammation and thrombosis 20. The occurrence of circulating platelet\u2013neutrophil aggregates 21, the alteration of fibrinogen cascade 22 and its content 23, previously observed in patients with KD, seem to support the relevance of this mechanism in the pathogenesis of the disease.",

            "text": "For decades, KD researchers attempted to identify candidate genes conferring susceptibility to the illness. In particular, genes related to innate and acquired immune functions or to vascular remodelling have been studied 24. Although incidence of KD varies in different ethnic population, genetic polymorphisms of 1,4,5\u2010trisphosphate 3\u2010kinase C (ITPKC) and caspase 3 (CASP3) have been shown to associate with coronary artery lesions formation in both Japanese and Taiwanese populations of patients with KD 25. ITPKC gene is located on chromosome 19q23 and acts as a negative regulator of T\u2010cell activation. CASP3 gene, located on chromosome 4q35, is profoundly related to the apoptosis of immune cells. Both ITPKC and CASP3 are involved in Ca2+/nuclear factor of activated T\u2010cells pathways, indicating the potential role of this signalling pathway in immune system 25. Furthermore, in 2011, Shimizu et al. suggested that genetic variations in the transforming growth factor\u2010\u03b2 (TGF\u2010\u03b2) signalling pathway influenced the susceptibility to the manifestation of KD, to the disease outcome as well as to the response to therapy 26. In the immune system, TGF\u2010\u03b2 modulates the balance of pro\u2010inflammatory/anti\u2010inflammatory T cells, through a complex set of interactions. Genetic variations in the TGF\u2010\u03b2 pathway may lead to an imbalance of pro\u2010inflammatory and regulatory T cells (Treg) by affecting the expression of the forkhead/winged helix transcription factor P3 (FOXP3) that is involved in the differentiation, function and survival of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells.",

BLK is a Src family tyrosine kinase expressed primarily in the B\u2010cell lineage. It is located on chromosome 8p22\u201023 and its expression pattern during the acute and convalescent stages of KD correlates with the percentage of B cells in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

IL\u201010, located on chromosome 1q31\u2010q32, is a potent cytokine that exerts pleiotropic effects on immunoregulation and inflammation.

A large number of T cells, mononuclear cells, macrophages and plasma cells, with a smaller number of neutrophils, are observed in various organ tissues of fatal cases of acute KD 34. An imbalance of Th1 and Th2 subsets during the acute stage of KD has been suggested by Matsubara et al. 35. In particular, a decrease in the numbers of Th1, producing interferon (IFN)\u2010\u03b3, but not of Th2, producing IL\u20104, has been observed. As a general rule, Th1 cells play an important role in cellular immunity by secreting IL\u20102 and IFN\u2010\u03b3, whereas Th2 cells have the helper function for the development of antibody\u2010producing B cells by secreting various cytokines such as IL\u20104, IL\u20105, IL\u20106 and IL\u201010. Some of these cytokines play an important role in the progression from systemic activation of the immune system to local inflammation in coronary vessels. Recently, it has been demonstrated that KD patients may be non\u2010responsive to IVIG when, after IVIG treatment, the serum levels of IL\u20106 and IL\u201010 decrease slowly and the levels of IL\u20104 and TNF\u2010\u03b1 increase 36.",

These cells could mediate the damage to the arterial wall through the recruitment of pro\u2010inflammatory cells 40. Furthermore, also hepatocyte growth factor, together with VEGF, might play an important role. Their serum levels could be a powerful predictor for the development of coronary artery lesions in KD 41. It must, however, be stressed that, although KD is surely characterized by a marked activation of the immune system with elevations of serum pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, mainly in the acute phase, the major sources for these chemical mediators remain yet controversial.

In fact, oxidative/nitrative stress has been measured in KD inflamed blood vessels, as revealed by the high levels of reactive oxidizing species (i.e. superoxide anion and nitric oxide), protein 3\u2010nitrotyrosine and MPO levels in the blood 51. Protein 3\u2010nitrotyrosine is the covalent post\u2010translational modification identifying the formation of nitric oxide\u2010derived nitrating agents used as a specific biomarker of oxidant burden in many pathological conditions from acute to chronic diseases. Increased levels of MPO, the pro\u2010inflammatory enzyme released from activated leucocytes, could support the pro\u2010inflammatory status forming highly oxidizing species and protein oxidation products, such as 3\u2010nitrotyrosine, promoting lipid peroxidation and inducing an autoimmune response mediated by MPO autoantibodies 52.

In particular, decreased glycophorin A and CD47 expression as well as the externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS) were measured in RBCs from KD patients 51. Glycophorin A, a glycoprotein widely expressed at the RBC surface, is down\u2010regulated during cell senescence; CD47, an integrin\u2010associated protein known as the thrombospondin receptor, acts as a marker of self; PS, a phospholipid normally localized to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, is externalized to the outer leaflet during cell remodelling, leading to RBC ageing and cell death. The appearance of these ageing and death biomarkers on RBCs from KD patients was related with clinical evaluations. Indeed, during the first 5 days of hospitalization, the number of RBCs and the values of haemoglobin, the mean corpuscular volume and the haematocrit were significantly decreased in KD patients 51. This could be of relevance as RBCs can act as physiological scavengers of ROS in circulating blood and can be considered as \u2018biosensors\u2019 for monitoring oxidative imbalance in inflammatory diseases 53. Importantly, alterations in RBC structure and function may independently and synergistically impair blood flow and induce vascular occlusion, whereas premature ageing of RBCs, and their consequent removal from circulation, might be a risk factor for anaemia.

This can exert a pathogenetic role in the cardiovascular complications that characterize KD. Recently, it has been suggested that thrombocytosis in KD could depend on platelet stimulation and defective apoptosis, probably bolstered by nitrosative stress 55. This hypothesis is supported by the detection of circulating platelets\u2013neutrophils aggregates in KD patients 21 and by the increase in markers of platelet activation, such as the shedding of P\u2010selectin and the externalization of PS. P\u2010selectin is a cell\u2010adhesion molecule constitutively expressed in the \u03b1\u2010granules of resting platelets that translocates at the surface during platelet activation. Its release as a shedding phenomenon modulates leucocyte adhesion to both platelets and endothelial cells during inflammatory responses and thrombus formation 56. The externalization of PS in platelets, i.e. its presence on outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, is usually associated with a sort of programmed cell death 57, but it has also been correlated with their hyperactivation 58. Importantly, specific studies on platelet activation identified two different platelet subpopulations in the peripheral blood of na\u00efve patients with KD: (i) platelets with PS externalization (annexin V positive platelets), characterized by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (considered as pro\u2010coagulant), and (ii) platelets without PS externalization (annexin V negative platelets), characterized by mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization. This latter subpopulation become pro\u2010coagulant when stimulated by mediators normally released from activated platelets, e.g. adenosine diphosphate 59.

Increased levels of ADMA, a specific endogenous inhibitor of the endothelial NOS, induce dysfunction of the endothelium, which becomes clinically evident by impaired endothelium\u2010dependent vasodilation, hyperaggregability of platelets and enhanced monocyte adhesion. Soluble P\u2010selectin, a cell\u2010adhesion molecule considered as a marker of in vivo platelet activation, has been associated with thrombus growth. Soluble annexin V, released by endothelial cells or platelets, is a calcium\u2010dependent protein. Its activity is based on phosphatidylserine binding and includes membrane damage repair 60. Peripheral blood diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers are listed in Table 3.",

In addition, KD patients share their features, e.g. inflammatory markers, with several other chronic and acute diseases. The consequent absence of a pathognomonic laboratory test allows the diagnosis of KD depending almost exclusively on recognition of clinical criteria, slowing down or often losing the chance of monitoring and identifying suitable KD pathogenetic determinants.",

Specific basic research and clinical studies should be undertaken to optimize KD clinical diagnosis based on corroborated laboratory data, allowing the compilation of universally suitable guidelines. Laboratory analyses could then allow an earlier and focused diagnosis, and prompting treatments also improving appropriateness of the cures. These aims could be reached by: (i) supporting a more stringent clinical surveillance, (ii) creating multicenter clinical networks facilitating enrolment of patients with this uncommon disease and efficiently test for new therapies aimed at preventing the disease progression, (iii) creating database registries for long\u2010term follow\u2010up of KD patients, (iv) improving clinical studies aimed at discovering the aetiology of KD and (v) deciphering genetic influences on disease susceptibility and outcome.",

These include some type of bacterial or viral infection, genetic determinants, immune system as well as haematological alterations. Altogether these factors can play a role in the onset and progression of the disease. In fact, all these determinants or some of them, when acting synergistically, could give rise to the disease but, in addition, they can also be considered as useful tools for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. Hence, at least as haematological manifestations of KD are concern, we are far from the understanding of the complexity and the intertwining of the cellular and molecular cross\u2010talk leading to the cardiovascular risk in these patients. Furthermore, in this scenario, genetic predisposition seems to represent a key background capable of impacting on clinical outcome of KD.",
