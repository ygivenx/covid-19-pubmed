Each year, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are responsible for the deaths of more than 50,000 elderly individuals in the United States [10]. ARIs caused by other respiratory agents, including human rhinovirus (HRV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human coronavirus (HCoV), human parainfluenza virus (HPIV), and human adenovirus (HAdV), have also been described, but the data are scarce and fragmentary [2\u20139]. This lack of data could be because of the atypical presentation of ARI in elderly patients, which complicates and potentially delays clinical and laboratory diagnoses, as well as low viral loads and difficulties in implementing laboratory-based surveillance systems in nursing homes (NHs) [11, 12].",

Nasopharyngeal flocked swabs were collected. ARI detection was carried out by nurses, and the diagnoses were confirmed by a physician. Patient information, including demographic characteristics (sex, age), symptoms, risk factors of severe influenza, treatment, influenza vaccination status, and hospitalization, was documented in case report forms (CRFs). The risk factors associated with severe influenza infection were chronic disease and obesity (Body Mass Index > 40 kg/m2). The nasopharyngeal swabs and CRFs were sent by mail daily to the virology laboratory of the University of Corsica [6]. Seventeen NHs enrolled at least one ARI resident, with a total catchment population of 1113 and a mean of 65.5 (min = 56.7 and max = 75.1).

In line with a recent study [7], no coinfections were detected among ARI residents.

In France and other European countries, the 2014/2015 and 2016/2017 influenza outbreaks were characterized by the genetic evolution of circulating A(H3N2) strains and by reports of low-to-moderate influenza vaccine effectiveness in the elderly [19, 20]. Moreover, as previously described [6], the suboptimal influenza vaccination coverage of healthcare providers and the suboptimal antiviral strategies applied (less than 5%) could increase the vulnerability of NH residents to influenza infection. In France, when an influenza outbreak is suspected in an institutionalized setting, antiviral drug treatment is recommended for those individuals exposed [21]. In the present study, even when the virological results had been communicated to a physician within 24 hours after reception of the nasopharyngeal sample, influenza antiviral treatment was only administrated to three patients. These results are in agreement with the low prescription rate of neuraminidase inhibitors to patients with a severe influenza risk factor reported in French primary healthcare settings [22].",

Influenza B/Victoria viruses, which dominated during the 2015/2016 influenza outbreak [24], were not included in the trivalent influenza seasonal vaccine and, in this study, were only detected in three residents. This is in line with knowledge that influenza B, when present as a seasonal circulating virus within a geographic area, mainly occurs among younger persons and school-aged children [25]. Although the A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses circulated in France during the 2013-2014 (47%), 2014-2015 (19%), and 2015-2016 (19%) influenza outbreaks, no A(H1N1)pdm09 positive samples were detected among the ARI residents enrolled in the present study. This result is in agreement with previous studies reporting the apparent limited circulation of A(H1N1)pdm09 in NHs [2, 26, 27] as a consequence of a degree of cross-protection acquired by residents from previous exposure to influenza A(H1N1) virus, particularly with strains that circulated before 1957 [28].",

We found that the presence of fever remained important in the elderly to retain specificity for the diagnosis of influenza A(H3N2). This result is in agreement with those from previous studies [11, 29\u201331], in which fever was associated with influenza among older adults. The number of deaths was significantly associated with influenza A(H3N2)-positive ARIs residents.

These difficulties could lead to biased clinical assessments and decisions regarding whether to take a swab, thus underestimating the number of positive patients. Although RT-qPCR is a valid diagnostic assay with high sensitivity and specificity for respiratory viruses, the clinical implications of positive laboratory results are less straightforward.
