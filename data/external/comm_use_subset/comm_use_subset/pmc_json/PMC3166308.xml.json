Limited information released in government reports [5] later confirmed that these outbreaks were caused by H5N2 virus. Although there had not been any highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 cases reported in Taiwan, yet considering the geographical location of Taiwan being an important stopover for migrating birds [6] and previous H5N1 outbreaks in neighboring Asian countries such as Thailand and China [7], plus increasing travel and direct transportation links with other countries, Taiwan is at risk for HPAI outbreaks as well. The most worrisome scenario is that human-to-human transmissions may begin to take place if there is a change in the viral genome [8], and according to a relatively conservative estimate by the World Health Organization (WHO), such transmissions may cause 2 million to 7.4 million deaths [9].",

            "text": "In Taiwan, people have the habit of shopping at traditional markets for live poultry [10], and such traditional markets with live chicken for sale provide a possible AI viral reservoir [11], thereby placing traditional market workers and shoppers at risk for contracting AI. Poultry are usually selected and purchased by shoppers while they are still alive and slaughtered on site as shoppers in Taiwan commonly believe that live poultry preserves the freshness [11]. During the purchasing process, shoppers may come into contact with live poultry, thereby exposing shoppers to risk of contracting AI, and thus it is important that shoppers wash their hands after any contact with poultry. Normally, a poultry vendor would not sell other foods; however, in a traditional market, a poultry stand could be adjacent to any other food stands without any partitions separating them. Notably, AI viruses can also be transmitted to humans through the particles raised up by the movement of the poultry [12], and therefore, regardless of whether the shoppers are purchasing live poultry, they are advised to wear a face mask while in a traditional market. Given the modes of AI transmission as described above, WHO [13] and Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (Taiwan CDC) [14] both recommended washing hands after any contact with poultry and using a face mask when coming into contact with poultry to prevent AI infection and its spread. Handwashing [15], [16] and wearing face masks [17] have been documented as effective preventive measures against respiratory disease in community settings. In addition, these two preventive behaviors are relatively easy to practice. Taken together, both handwashing and wearing face masks could be a cost-effective way of preventing AI in the general public. Therefore, an enhanced understanding of the factors associated with AI preventive behavior could inform renewed prevention efforts to more effectively promote the recommended preventive behavior in different target populations.",

Another study in Italy focused merely on poultry workers, exploring the relationships of their knowledge, attitudes, and compliance with precautions at work, such as self-reported use of face masks and gloves [19]. An earlier study reported its findings in a letter to the editor, presenting regional differences in AI knowledge, risk perceptions, and AI-related behavior changes among Laotians after HPAI outbreaks [20]. Further, a telephone survey in the Hong Kong general population examined participants' AI risk perception in relation to their live chicken purchasing behavior [21]. Similarly, a study in Taiwan conducted by marketing and business management researchers assessed consumer knowledge and risk perceptions of AI in association with chicken consumption behavior, instead of AI preventive behavior under the threat of AI [11].",

As described in the Introduction, there were major AI outbreaks in Kaohsiung (in southern Taiwan), and therefore, the current study aimed to explore the risk perception about AI, as well as the recommended AI preventive behavior, among traditional market workers and shoppers in central and northeastern Taiwan, where there have not been reported AI outbreaks. Accordingly, two traditional markets were selected in central Taiwan and two others were selected in northeastern Taiwan. Since this study sought to examine simultaneously both groups of participants (i.e., traditional market workers and shoppers), we decided to interview market workers and shoppers with a one-to-one ratio. With this particular purpose in mind, purposive sampling was employed in traditional markets: market workers were interviewed by trained interviewers during their breaks; because there were far more market shoppers than workers, market shoppers were randomly selected for an interview at the market entrance if they happened to step into the market when an interviewer just became available to conduct a survey after completing the previous interview. The interviewer-administered survey using a structured questionnaire was conducted in December 2009 through January 2010. A total of 352 anonymous interviews were completed with a response rate of 95.1%. Each interview was conducted by a trained interviewer and took the participant 5\u201310 minutes to complete the questionnaire. Traditional market workers and shoppers were first approached and informed of the study's goals and procedures by our interviewers to obtain verbal informed consent before each interview. Every attempt made to approach potential participants, be it successful or unsuccessful, was documented in order to calculate the response rate. We also provided a gift worth approximately US $1 as incentives to increase the response rate. The study protocol and verbal consent procedure were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the National Taiwan University College of Public Health.",

It is noteworthy that the AI risk classification above takes into account the nearness in space to live poultry. For example, meat and seafood stands are normally located in the same section as poultry stands in a traditional market, and hence are closer to poultry vendors than are flower and vegetable vendors. As such, pork vendors, beef vendors, etc. are classified as medium risk market workers, whereas flower vendors and vegetable vendors are classified as low risk market workers.",

The survey also evaluated the participant's risk perception of AI, including whether the participant anticipated an AI epidemic in Taiwan, whether the participant knew about severe cases of AI, and whether the participant knew about AI outbreaks in Kaohsiung (a region located in southern Taiwan). The variables regarding knowledge and risk perception of AI were binary (e.g., yes/no, correct/incorrect). The outcome measure of recommended AI preventive behavior was assessed by asking: \u201cWhen you are in a traditional market, do you wear a face mask and also wash your hands after any contact with poultry (yes/no)?\u201d Notably, each participant's response to this behavioral outcome measure was validated by the interviewer through direct observation in regard to the face mask wearing aspect of the preventive behavior. In other words, since all interviews were conducted in traditional markets, only participants who were wearing a face mask at the time of the interview would be coded as adopting the recommended AI preventive behavior as defined in this study. Several theoretical models have been used for understanding protective health behaviors, including the Health Belief Model (HBM) [22]\u2013[24]. The risk perception measures in this study were derived from theoretical constructs of the HBM, which posits that risk perceptions such as perceived severity and perceived susceptibility are associated with adoption of health-related behaviors [25]. This model has also been used in a recent AI study [26].",

Such regional differences in preventive behavior were also reported in a Laotian population [20] and were attributed to different participant characteristics in urban and rural areas. In light of such findings, the present study also took into account gender, age, education, and other covariates in the multivariate regression model. However, the regional differences still remained. A possible explanation is that participants in northeastern Taiwan, which is more rural and has fewer healthcare resources than central Taiwan, may choose the relatively easy and cost-effective measures such as wearing face masks and washing hands to protect against AI. Another study in China also found differences between Guangzhou and Hong Kong in regard to participants' AI risk perception and live poultry purchase [29]; while its outcome variable of interest was not AI preventive behavior, regional differences were present and were ascribed to cultural differences. Notably, the current study found that participants who lived in rural areas were more likely to practice the recommended AI preventive behavior (i.e., both face mask wearing and handwashing) than those who lived in urban areas; however, prior research has found that people living in rural areas were more likely to practice the AI risky behavior (i.e., live poultry purchase) than those living in urban areas [29]. Caution needs to be exercised in interpreting such inconsistency, because different behaviors could have different determinants, and therefore, it is possible that these two studies found inconsistent results due to the different natures of these behaviors in question. These findings suggest that future studies may investigate potential cross-national differences in AI preventive behavior, and that qualitative research is also needed to explore regional differences caused by cross-cultural differences as well as other possible causal mechanisms.",

Similarly, in a limited number of AI studies which included gender as a variable, its effect on the AI preventive behavior was generally found to be not statistically significant [e.g.], [19,26]. On the other hand, higher education levels have repeatedly been reported to be associated with increased knowledge and intention to adopt the recommended AI preventive behavior [e.g.], [18], [19,26]. Consistent with these findings, our study also found participants with higher education levels to be more likely to practice the AI preventive behavior. Interestingly, while gender difference was not statistically significant in the current study, we found significant interactive effect between gender and education among participants with a senior high-school education, males being less likely to adopt the recommended AI preventive behavior than their female counterparts. To our knowledge, such findings have not been reported in previous research and warrant further investigations to elucidate possible mechanisms.",

Taken together, more attention should be paid to this group of high-risk market workers. It is worth noting that the aforementioned \u03c72 comparison of AI preventive behavior was not statistically significant, possibly owing to relatively smaller cell counts of high-risk market workers and hence reduced statistical power.

Also, combining wearing face masks and handwashing as the outcome variable without assessing them separately could be a limitation of this study because determinants of these two practices could be different. On the other hand, however, in view of the modes of AI transmission through contact and air particles, practicing both face mask wearing and handwashing behaviors could provide better protection against AI infection. Another potential limitation is that this study was not based on national data but on data from northeastern and central Taiwan; yet, regional differences were uncovered. Therefore, future studies should consider drawing a national sample to explore other possible cross-regional differences in Taiwan. In addition, cross-national comparisons may also reveal interesting differences across various countries and cultures in preventive behaviors associated with such emerging infectious diseases. Lastly, while self-efficacy (a construct borrowed from Bandura's Social Learning Theory) was not added to the HBM until 1988 [30], it has increasingly become an important construct in the HBM but was not included in our study. Hence, future research should consider measuring all other HBM constructs, including self-efficacy, when examining AI preventive behavior.",
