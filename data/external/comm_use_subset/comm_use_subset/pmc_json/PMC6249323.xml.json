CCA lectin binds to both sialoglycoproteins and gangliosides when these are 9-O-acetylated13,14, and thus we were not able to determine unambiguously if pre-B ALL cells express 9-O-Ac-glycoproteins.

We here report that nucleolin (NCL) is expressed on the surface of pre-B ALL cells as a sialoglycoprotein which is modified by 9-O-acetylation. NCL has no enzymatic function and can be best described as \u201cmulti-functional\u201d15,16, in the sense that it can have multiple subcellular locations (nucleus/nucleolus, cytoplasm and plasma membrane), bind to multiple biomolecules (RNA, other proteins)17,18, and has been implicated in a variety of biological processes including angiogenesis, migration, apoptosis19,20 and regulation of cell size21. Increased NCL expression is associated with worse prognosis of, among others, acute myeloid leukemia22, chronic lymphocytic leukemia23, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma24 and pancreatic ductal cancer25. Interestingly, NCL is viewed as a target for cancer therapy, and our studies further show that some pre-B ALL cells are sensitive to anti-NCL treatment using AS1411, a DNA aptamer that specifically binds NCL.",

Treatment with PNGase F, which only cleaves N-linked glycans, replaced the 100 kDa NCL band with a 90\u201395 kDa band, indicating that CCA lectin-binding NCL contains N-linked glycans (Fig. 2a).

The 100 kDa NCL band was found in the flow-through as well as in the elution fraction, indicating that Sia is attached via an \u03b12,6 linkage on only some of the NCL (Supplementary Fig. S2). The 100 kDa NCL glycoforms captured by the CCA lectin column were reduced in size by treatment with OSGPase (Fig. 2a). This enzyme digests proteins with clustered patches of O-linked sialoglycans26 such as present on sialomucins27,28. Interestingly, treatment of CCA lectin column fractions with C. perfringens sialidase reduced the molecular mass of both the flow-through (non O-Ac-Sia) as well as the entire 100 kDa CCA lectin-binding (O-Ac-Sia) NCL fraction to around 75 kDa (Fig. 2b, right panel). This suggests that the 100 kDa NCL glycoforms are all sialylated. Proteolytic products smaller than full-length NCL were also seen (Fig. 2b). We confirmed that most of the 100 kDa NCL is sialylated by treatment of an unfractionated RIPA buffer cell lysate with sialidase (Supplementary Fig. S2).",

The recombinant porcine torovirus HE(mut) -lectin primarily detects 9-mono-O-Ac modified sialic acids whereas the bovine HE(mut) -lectin also detects 7,9-di-O-Ac-Sia. Both are largely insensitive to linkage of Sia (\u03b12,3 or \u03b12,6)30. The esterase moieties of these probes were mutated to inactivate their 9-O-acetyl esterase activities and they are tagged by fusion to human IgG1-Fc. Similar to the CCA lectin affinity column, columns with both porcine torovirus and bovine coronavirus HE-Fc retained the 100 kDa NCL protein (Fig. 2c). We also immunoprecipitated NCL from a lysate of US7 cells. Reaction of the membranes with a NCL antibody confirmed its immunoprecipitation and retention on the membrane (Fig. 2d, lower panel). The M-T6004 antibody detected NCL (Fig. 2d upper panel). The triplicate Western blots were then incubated with either porcine HE(wt) -Fc or porcine HE(mut) -Fc, or control buffer. The HE(wt) -Fc as an active sialate 9-O-acetyl esterase is expected to remove 9-O-Ac from the sialic acids on NCL. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 2d (middle panel), the lectin part of the HE protein was no longer able to bind to NCL after the esterase moiety had cleaved the 9-O-Ac group. Binding of the HE(mut) -Fc to non-treated NCL was detected as expected.",

Moreover, Bates et al.32 hypothesized that normal cells only transiently express NCL outside the nucleus, in response to specific stimuli, whereas cancer cells would hijack this and express non-nuclear NCL constitutively. This places a specific significance on glycosylated NCL at the plasma membrane of cancer cells, where it can engage and transport a variety of cargos. We therefore examined cell surface NCL on pre-B ALL cells in more detail. Based on Western blotting (Fig. 3a, compare left and right panels), we confirmed that the 75 kDa NCL core protein was exclusively detected in the cytoplasmic and not in the membrane fraction. Cell surface NCL had an apparent molecular mass of 100 kDa and the non-biotinylated, intracellular protein fraction also contained 100 kDa NCL protein, which could represent glycosylated NCL in different endocytic compartments.",

For example, TXL2 had the lowest percentage, whereas in other pre-B ALL populations such as LAX56, more than 80% of cells were positive. The mean fluorescent intensity (MFI), as a measure of the number of NCL molecules per cell, was comparable among the different pre-B ALLs (not shown), indicating similar levels of NCL expression on those cells that did express it. Interestingly, all cultures seemed to contain discrete populations that either expressed or did not express cell surface NCL. The percentage of cells positive for cell surface NCL appeared to be a relatively stable property of each individual pre-B ALL, as sampling of the cells on multiple occasions gave a consistent result (Fig. 3c). In agreement with the results of Western blotting for intracellular NCL (Fig. 3a) after an additional permeabilization step to also detect intracellular NCL, all pre-B ALLs were almost 100% positive for NCL (not shown).",

We next measured cell surface 9-O-Ac-Sia on pre-B ALL cells using FACS, the HE-Fc lectins and anti-human IgG Fc-FITC secondary antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4a, there was a large difference among pre-B ALLs in the percentage of cells positive for surface 9-O-Ac-Sia, ranging from nearly all cells (RS4;11) to only about 8% of the cells (US7). When the same pre-B ALL was examined in several independent experiments, a large variation in the percentage of positive cells was measured (Fig. 4b). Interestingly, pre-B ALL samples highly positive for surface 9-O-Ac-Sia tended to also be highly positive for cell surface NCL (compare Fig. 3c with Fig. 4b). The co-localization of the 9-O-Ac-Sia signal with that of NCL was further investigated using ImageStream flow cytometry (Fig. 4c). The 9-O-Ac-Sia signal appeared as punctate structures on the surface of both US7 and ICN13 pre-B ALL cells. Part of NCL signal was also concentrated in punctate structures, and co-localization of NCL and 9-O-Ac-Sia was evident on some areas of the plasma membrane (Fig. 4c, arrows, merged). Of the \u22484000 cells analyzed, 36.6% were clearly positive for both NCL and 9-O-Ac-Sia, with a small percentage of cells singly positive for only NCL (3%) or only for 9-O-Ac-Sia (4%). Their location was also compared on normal human bone marrow CD19+ CD10+ pre-B precursors. Consistent with Fig. 3e, Fig. 4d shows that fewer normal precursor B cells expressed cell surface NCL than leukemic pre-B cells. Moreover, on average only around 10% of normal pre-B cells expressed both NCL and 9-O-Ac-Sia on the same cell, compared to around 60% for ICN13 pre-B ALL cells. Interestingly, whereas around 37% of ICN13 pre-B ALL cells that were positive for both NCL and 9-O-Ac-Sia had a co-localization of the two signals, this was the case in only 1.5% of the normal double positive pre-B cells. Taken together, this suggests that NCL on normal pre-B cells contains less 9-O-Ac-Sia.",

However, cell surface NCL levels were not reproducibly different on pre-B ALL cells grown with OP9 stroma in complete growth medium, on pre-B ALL cells that were incubated in complete medium but without OP9 stroma for up to 72 hr, and on pre-B ALL cells that were kept overnight in culture medium without FBS (data not shown). We also analyzed cell surface and cytoplasmic NCL in pre-B ALL cells with or without OP9 stromal support, using Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 5b, stromal OP9 cells alone contained comparatively low levels of NCL. Whether pre-B ALL cells were kept in suspension or were adhered to the OP9 cells had little effect on their NCL total levels, 9-O-acetyl sialylation of NCL or its subcellular distribution (Fig. 5b). Per \u00b5g of lysate, more NCL was present in the cytosolic than in the membrane fraction yet the signals from both porcine HE(mut) -Fc and bovine HE(mut) -Fc detecting the 100 kDa NCL were stronger in the cell surface fraction than in the intracellular fraction. Taken together, these results indicate that cell surface NCL carries more 9-O-Ac-Sia than intracellular 100 kDa NCL.",

Consistent with this, we here also measured increased levels of 9-O-Ac-Sia on the pre-B ALL cells using the porcine HE(mut) -Fc.

NCL has not been studied in pre-B ALL although it is viewed as a possible target for treatment in other cancers. In this context, the subcellular location and distribution of NCL protein appear to be key factors, seeing that normal cells were reported to express NCL mainly in the nucleus whereas some cancer cells constitutively express NCL on the cell surface32,33. Thus the question of what regulates expression of NCL on the surface of cells is of significant interest. Hovanessian et al.33 showed that NCL needs to be glycosylated to appear on the surface, indicating that cancer cells that express high levels of cell surface NCL must also maintain high glycosylation levels on NCL. As Hovanessian et al.33 also reported that the half-life of cytoplasmic and cell surface NCL in carcinomas is only around 45 minutes, cancer cells either recycle NCL very efficiently, with minimal deglycosylation, or rapidly synthesize and glycosylate it de novo. Regardless of the exact mechanism, we found that in pre-B ALL cells, only the 100 kDa glycosylated NCL and not the core 75 kDa NCL is located on the surface, which is in agreement with other reports31.",

These include five O-linked glycosylation sites in the N-terminal end of NCL, and two N-linked sites N317 and N492, in T-ALL Jurkat cells41,42. We found that most, if not all of the 100 kDa NCL glycoprotein band contains Sia, and that the Sia in NCL can be terminal on both the N- and the O-linked glycans. Because the \u2248100 kDa NCL glycoform bound by CCA lectin was completely cleaved by OSGPase, all 9-O-Ac-Sia-modified NCL contains clustered O-linked sialic acid, probably on glycans attached to T84, T92, T105, T106, and T113 in the N-terminal part of NCL41,42. Finally, the finding that antibodies raised against 9-O-Ac-GD3 cross-react with sialylated NCL, as seen here, suggests that NCL could contain disialic acid (Sia-2,8-Sia-) structures. Although not common, these have been reported on glycoproteins other than NCAM including the leukocyte common antigen CD4534. In summary, we conclude that all NCL on the surface of these pre-B ALL cells is sialylated, sialylation is found both on N- and O-linked glycans, and all 9-O-acetylated NCL sialoglycoforms contain clustered O-linked glycans.",

Fox et al.43 reported that UM4D4 monoclonal antibodies which recognize 9-O-Ac-GD3 actually detect sialoglycoproteins of 94\u201370 kDa Mw in T cells. The Jones antibody, which reacts with 9-O-Ac-GD3, also detected glycoproteins, in the 100 kDa and 37 kDa range44. In our studies, D1.1 and M-T6004 mAbs, which are sold as antibodies against 9-O-Ac-GD3, detect glycoproteins, and both reacted with 100 and 70 kDa proteins binding to CCA lectin. As immunoprecipitated NCL reacts with M-T6004, we conclude that NCL is one of the principle O-acetylated sialoglycoproteins detected by M-T6004. We cannot exclude the possibility that both D1.1 and M-T6004 recognize additional O-acetylated sialoglycoproteins in the 75 kDa range that are not sensitive to sialic acid removal by treatment with C. perfringens sialidase, which prefers \u03b12,3-linked Sia and may be inhibited by 9-O-acetylation45. Thus, studies that use such antibodies and FACS to report on the presence of gangliosides on the cell surface such as 9-O-Ac-GD3 may actually also, or even mainly, be detecting 9-O-Ac Sia modified glycoproteins including NCL.",

Conversely, some cell surface NCL did not co-localize with signals from 9-O-Ac-Sia, supporting our biochemical analysis in which a substantial amount of glycosylated (100 kDa) NCL was found in the flow-through of CCA lectin, bovine HE(mut), and porcine HE(mut) affinity columns. Thus, although 9-O-Ac-Sia-NCL clearly constitutes a part of all the structures detected by these lectins, not all of the sialylated NCL is modified by 9-O-Ac and not all of the 9-O-Ac-Sia-bearing structures are NCL. It is therefore not surprising, that increased extracellular Ca2+ or lipid raft disruption by M\u03b2CD markedly affected cell surface NCL, but minimally changed 9-O-Ac-Sia-bearing structures.",

            "text": "We also investigated if the sialylation of cell surface NCL regulates its location. We found, surprisingly, that a very brief treatment with C. perfringens sialidase caused an increase in NCL levels detected on the plasma membrane. In principle, de-sialylation can increase the accessibility of epitopes recognized by the anti-NCL antibodies. However, on a Western blot, these antibodies detect both sialylated and non-sialylated NCL. As NCL only has a short retention time on the cell surface33, the detected increased level could be caused by decreased endocytosis, or accelerated exocytosis. For example, removal of terminal Sia could expose glycans on NCL that can subsequently be bound or cross-linked by lectins such as Galectin-346, preventing endocytosis of NCL by its sequestration outside of lipid rafts. Increased exocytosis could also play a role, as sialylation decreases exocytosis of the lysosomal sialoglycoprotein Lamp1 (CD107a)47. However, it is unlikely that C. perfringens sialidase can enter the pre-B ALL cells to remove Sia from intracellular NCL, and therefore a stimulatory effect of this enzyme on putative NCL exocytosis via a lysosomal/endosomal route is improbable. Alternatively, lipid raft partitioning may be regulated by the sialylation state of NCL. Some O-glycosylated cell surface proteins including PSGL-1, CD43, and CD44 need sialylation to be able to associate with lipid rafts48. Because both disruption of lipid rafts using M\u03b2CD and sialidase treatment cause increased retention of NCL on the surface, an alternative explanation is, that sialidase treatment decreases NCL location in lipid rafts and by this mechanism delays endocytosis.",

Based on gene array expression data, pre-B ALLs of different subcategories all express high levels of NCL mRNA, but not significantly higher than normal control CD19+ CD10+ pre-B cells, with the exception of the MLL subcategory (Supplementary Fig. S1). We also detected cell surface NCL protein on normal CD19+ CD10+ precursor B cells although this was lower than levels on malignant pre-B ALL ICN13 cells. Other studies have shown that NCL directly or indirectly regulates expression of a large number of genes in normal hematopoiesis: Mahotka et al.49 found significant changes in levels of around 24% of all expressed genes when they overexpressed NCL in normal human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells. Nonetheless, as reviewed in Bates et al.32 numerous anti-NCL therapeutics including the aptamer AS1411 and its derivatives have been extensively used and even evaluated in a clinical trial32. AS1411 has shown surprisingly low systemic toxicity in animal models or in humans, indicating that interference with NCL activity in normal cells has few consequences or, alternatively, that the therapeutic window consists of the differential expression levels on the cell surface between normal and malignant cells. In this context it is important to note that some therapeutics such as anti-NCL antibodies50 are completely dependent on NCL on the plasma membrane to be able to stimulate antibody-dependent cytotoxicity of immune effector cells and that for such a therapeutic, the presence or absence of NCL on the cell surface will be a critical factor.",

Conversely, LAX56 with the highest sensitivity also had a high percentage of cell surface NCL. Thus from the therapeutic anti-NCL perspective, prolongation of NCL occupancy or retention time on the cell surface would be desirable. Although we found that sialidase treatment of pre-B ALL cells would produce this effect, such a treatment cannot be applied as a therapy. In contrast, our finding that vincristine, a conventional chemotherapeutic, also produces this effect, suggests that combination treatments of vincristine with an anti-NCL agent such as AS1411 or an anti-NCL antibody may be more effective than treatment with a single agent.",
