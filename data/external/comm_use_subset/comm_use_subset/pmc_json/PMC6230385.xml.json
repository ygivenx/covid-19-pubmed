The incidence of influenza-like illness (ILI) is almost similar between developed and developing countries like Nepal; the mortality rates are higher in developing countries. The frequency of mixed infections of noninfluenza ARI viruses with influenza virus varies from 10 to 30%, and studies have suggested an association between mixed viral infections could increase the disease progression or clinical severity [3].",

However, epidemiology and etiology for ILI is poorly understood in Nepal. A laboratory-based ILI surveillance system is well established in Nepal and has greatly contributed to outbreak investigation, surveillance, and timely response since the emergence of pandemic influenza in 2009. The influenza viruses circulating in Nepal have many similarities with our neighboring countries and the regions. We reported year-round transmission of influenza with a peak activity during the rainy and winter seasons is similar to Thailand, Northern Vietnam, and Lao PDR [7]. An efficient detection method is of great importance for laboratory diagnosis. Rapid antigen detection, viral cultures, and molecular methods, such as PCR assays, are currently used as the viral detection method [8]. In clinical settings, rapid and reliable PCR assays are particularly helpful in making early decisions regarding management and treatment of the patients. In this study, we attempt to characterize the influenza and other ARI pathogens by the multiplex PCR assay in children with influenza-like illness cases.",

Of the total, 175 throat swab specimens positive for influenza virus were further tested for detection of other respiratory copathogens. Influenza-like illness was defined as an individual with an acute respiratory infection with history of fever (\u226538\u00b0C), cough, and/or sore throat with onset within the last 10 days [9]. Throat swab specimens were collected in viral transport medium (Copan, Italy) and transported in triple-package containers at a proper temperature (2\u20136\u00b0C). Specimens were processed in biosafety cabinet class II type A2 (Esco, Singapore) for nucleic acid extraction of influenza and other respiratory pathogens at NIC.

Finally, nucleic acid was eluted in 50 \u00b5l of the elution buffer and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use. The real-time rRT-PCR assay for respiratory pathogens was performed on 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher scientific, USA). Extracted nucleic acid was screened by rRT-PCR with Fast Track Diagnostic (FTD) Respiratory pathogens 21 kit (Biomerieux, Luxemburg) following the manufacturer's protocol using five multiplex PCR for viruses: influenza (InfV) type A-B, influenza A/H1N1, rhinovirus (RV), coronavirus (CoV) OC43, NL63, 229E, and HKU1, parainfluenza virus (PIV) type 1\u20134, metapneumovirus (MPV) A-B, bocavirus (BV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A-B, adenovirus (AV), enterovirus (EV), parechovirus (PeV), and one bacterial pathogen: Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Two positive controls for viral and bacterial multiplex PCR assay, internal control (IC), and a negative control (NC) tubes were provided in the kit. Briefly, 10 \u00b5l of the extracted nucleic acid was used as a template in each reaction for the FTD Respiratory pathogens 21 multiplex PCR following the manufacturer's instructions. The thermal cycle amplification condition includes reverse transcription for 15 minutes at 42\u00b0C, denaturation for 3 minutes at 94\u00b0C followed by 40 cycles for 8 seconds at 94\u00b0C, and 34 seconds at 60\u00b0C.
