This new virus had a genome similar phylogenetically to that of a chicken A(H7N9) virus isolated from an epidemiologically linked live poultry market1 and was thus identified as an avian (H7N9) virus1\u20133. H7N9 viruses can cause severe illnesses in persons with contact to poultry, including pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with high case fatality rates2,4. As of August 31, 2016, a total of 795 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus had been reported in China4. The infections were also detected in the travelers of Canada (two) and Malaysia (one) to China4. Although the clinical features of hospitalized patients with H7N9 virus infection are generally similar to those of patients with severe pandemic H1N15 or H5N1 virus infections6, the mortality rates of H7N9 and H5N1 have been reported to be 37.1% and 53.2%, respectively7, whereas that of H1N1 was <1%5.",

Imaging showed improvement in inflammation over time, especially during the first 6 months after hospital discharge. However, no further significant changes in interstitial fibrosis or ground-glass opacities were detected at the 12- and 24-month visits. An autopsy study of patients with H7N9 infection suggested that lung histology varied according to the duration of illness. After acute diffuse alveolar damage, post-inflammatory changes such as pulmonary pneumocyte hyperplasia and parenchyma fibroproliferation occurred during the later course of the disease10. We speculate that changes during the 6-month convalescence period are irreversible. Absorption occurred slowly and was coincident with clinical symptoms. In survivors of H5N1 virus infection, radiologic abnormalities including ground-glass opacities with a reticular pattern remained evident at the 12-month follow-up visit10. Moreover, in a study of the long-term outcomes of pandemic 2009 H1N1-associated severe ARDS, the patients also had abnormal imaging findings, with mildly distorted septal lines, parenchymal bands, pneumatocele and distal bronchiectasis, at 1 year post-ICU discharge11. At the 3-month visit, ground-glass opacities were evident in 85.7% of patients5. These features are generally similar to those of survivors of H7N9 infection in this study.",

Pulmonary function has been reported to be near normal, with the exception of decreased diffusion capacity, in H1N1 patients11. In our study, approximately half of the survivors had ventilation dysfunction at 24 months. Hybrid patterns and restrictive ventilation dysfunction accounted for most types of dysfunction, which may be caused by muscle weakness and fatigue13. 78.9% of patients exhibited decreased DLCO levels at the 1-year follow-up visit, which was higher than reported previously14\u201317.

Thus survivors have significantly lower HRQoL than that of the general population and are likely to have social functioning and mental health deficits19. Similarly, H7N9 survivors experience persistent HRQoL decrements after discharge. Thus, the disease affected HRQoL mainly in the RP, BP, SF, and RE domains compared with normal controls. A meta-analysis showed that recovery in the HRQoL of ARDS survivors occurred during the first 6 months after discharge20, but no significant improvement was evident at the 2-year follow-up in our study. These findings suggest that the quality of life of survivors with ARDS was lower than that of those without ARDS. The severity of the diseases may influence the quality of life the patients.",

This study had several limitations. First, most H7N9 infections occurred in China between 2013 and the present. This was a single-center study involving a limited number of patients over a 1-year period in Zhejiang Province, China. Second, follow-up visits were offered to all patients discharged from the hospital, but some refused to attend and some did not complete follow up. The follow-up rates for LFT were 76%, 71%, 75% and 37% and those for HRQoL were 69%, 78%, 75% and 37% at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months, respectively. Although many indices did not change significantly after 1 year, the study population may not be representative of the entire population of H7N9 survivors. Third, this was a prospective study on the impact of H7N9 on the physical and psychological health of survivors. However, no information on the baseline lung function and quality of life of these patients was available. Although some patients may have underlying pulmonary diseases, most of them received the medicine without further examination. So we cannot compare the index of lung function before and post infection of H7N9. In particular, this group of patients had pre-existing conditions, which may also have affected the HRQoL results. Patients who had suffered acute pathologies reported significant decreases in quality of life, whereas other patients with pre-existing conditions reported significant improvements in terms of reduced BP and improved MH, VT and SF scores21. In our study, H7N9 survivors had significantly higher VT and MH scores than the population norms. Thus, those scores may have been higher at baseline, i.e., prior to admission. Finally, after discharge from the hospital, there was no significant improvement; however, whether improvements in physical and mental health would have been detected had the follow-up duration been longer is unknown. Thus, further expanded research is needed.",
