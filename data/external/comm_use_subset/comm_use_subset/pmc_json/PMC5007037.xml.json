An immune correlates analysis of the partially efficacious RV144 vaccine trial identified that V1-V2 IgG antibodies correlated with decreased risk of HIV-1 infection [3, 4, 6, 13]. These V1-V2 antibodies were not broadly neutralizing but were capable of multiple antiviral functions, such as ADCC, virion capture, and tier-1 neutralization [14\u201316]. Notably, the RV144 vaccine regimen elicited antibodies that were non-broadly neutralizing but that exhibited coordinated Fc-mediated effector responses [5, 6]. FcR polymorphisms also influenced RV144 vaccine efficacy [17]. Other HIV-1 vaccine efficacy trials that showed no efficacy either lacked a coordinated Fc-mediated effector response [5] or lacked evidence of strong Fc-mediated antibody functions [18, 19]. In rhesus macaque challenge models, non-broadly neutralizing antibody functions, including phagocytosis, correlated with vaccine protection [8\u201310]. Thus, the results from human and non-human primate HIV-1 vaccine clinical trials raise the hypothesis that Fc-mediated antibody effector functions are an achievable and potentially protective antiviral immune response to induce by preventative vaccines.",

Although broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) are defined based on their ability to neutralize a broad range of viruses, recent passive immunization trials show that their protective activity is not solely due to neutralization, but also in part due to Fc-mediated function. In non-human primate (NHP) passive immunization studies, with both high and low dose vaginal challenge of rhesus macaques with SHIV162p3, protection decreased by about 50% when the administered passive antibody was incapable of binding Fc receptors [20, 21]. Similarly, in murine passive immunization studies, antibodies with enhanced ability to bind activating Fc receptors gave greater protection than their epitope-matched counterparts [22]. These findings have also been demonstrated for other viral pathogens. For instance, broadly neutralizing antibodies against influenza demonstrate a dependence on Fc-FcR interaction to mediate protection in vivo [23]. A nonfucosylated glycovariant of the anti-RSV IgG, Palivizumab also showed significantly improved protection in vivo [24].",

            "text": "In this study, we focus on the antibody Fc effector function of phagocytosis. Antibody-dependent phagocytosis is best known for its essential role in defense against extracellular bacterial and fungal pathogens, but has also been shown to play important roles in clearing viral intracellular infections, including influenza [25\u201331], West Nile Virus [32], adenovirus [33], SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [34], and foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) [35, 36]. Notably, for both SARS-CoV and FMDV, protection is mediated not by neutralization but by antibody-dependent phagocytosis despite the presence of neutralizing antibodies [34\u201336]. Further, in FMDV, antibodies mediating antibody-dependent internalization show greater breadth of activity against heterologous strains compared with neutralizing antibodies [36]. In the HIV-1 field, antibody-mediated phagocytosis correlated with reduced risk of infection in NHP vaccine studies and in humans was associated with an IgG3 response that correlated with decreased risk of infection [5, 8, 10]. Since phagocytes are present at the mucosal surfaces that are the sites of transmission for HIV [37], antibody-dependent phagocytosis may play a role in preventing mucosal HIV-1 transmission. A role for phagocytosis in influencing disease progression has also been demonstrated. Polymorphisms in Fc\u03b3RIIa, which is one of the major receptors responsible for IgG-mediated ADCP [38, 39], correlated with HIV-1 progression and susceptibility [40].

            "text": "Different antibody isotypes and subclasses appear to vary in their ability to protect against HIV-1 infection, and one key question in HIV-1 vaccine design is which antibody isotypes/ subclasses should be induced by vaccines to maximize protection. For instance, in the RV144 vaccine trial, serum Env IgA correlated with increased risk of HIV-1 infection [3]. This was potentially due to monomeric circulating IgA blocking IgG mediated ADCC by Natural Killer (NK) cells [44, 45]. Also, V1-V2 IgG3 antibodies correlated with decreased risk of HIV-1 infection. These IgG3 antibodies were associated with Fc mediated antiviral activity by ADCC [4] and phagocytic activity [5], though it is unclear whether the IgG3 profile directly contributed to antiviral activity [6]. Differences between IgG1, IgA1 and IgA2 have also been found for various other effector functions including neutralization, virus capture, and transcytosis inhibition [46, 47]. Differences in antibody physiological localization may also play a role\u2014HIV-1 infection occurs primarily via the mucosal routes, where IgA can be present in higher concentrations than IgG. Thus, the mechanisms behind how antibody isotypes/subclasses affect protective efficacy remain unclear, and require further study. Given that each FcR has varying affinities for each immunoglobulin subclass Fc domain [48, 49], and that Fc-FcR affinity has been found to correlate with phagocytic activity [39], phagocytic activity is likely to vary depending on the FcR and antibody subclass involved. Detailed evaluation of the Fc-mediated antibody function of different specificities and forms of vaccine-induced antibodies and passively administered broadly neutralizing antibodies will improve strategies aimed to prevent and/or control HIV-1 infection in vivo. Although the potential protection of antibody-mediated phagocytosis in HIV-1 infection has been discussed previously in several studies, the impact of antibody structure, including both paratope and isotype/subclass, on phagocytosis potency has not been directly assessed. Further, these studies used model systems comprising HIV-1 antigen conjugated beads and monocytic cell lines instead of infectious virions and primary human phagocytes [5, 6, 8\u201310, 12, 37, 39, 50, 51]. In this study, we assessed the role of antibody in mediating phagocytosis of infectious HIV-1 virions in primary monocytes. We found that antibody-mediated internalization of HIV-1 virions does not require neutralization but is a function of both antibody paratope and isotype/subclass. These findings raise the hypothesis that antibody isotype/subclass profiles may differ in their protective efficacy due to differing potencies in antibody-mediated phagocytosis, which has implications for current vaccination and passive immunization strategies.",

Briefly, 9\u00d7105 beads (equivalent of 0.1 \u03bcl of supplied suspension) or 10 \u03bcl diluted fluorescence labelled HIV-1CM235, HIV-192TH023, or HIV-1BaL (containing 4.4 ng to 495 ng p24) were mixed with 10 \u03bcl (25 \u03bcg/ml final concentration) monoclonal antibodies in a 96 well round bottom plate. Each experiment, with positive and negative controls, was performed with the same stock concentration of virus. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 2 hours, 5 x104 (THP-1) or 6 x104 (primary monocytes) of CD4-blocked cells were added to each well with final volume 40 to 200 \u03bcl each, then spinoculated at 1200 g for 1 hour at 4\u00b0C. CD4 blocking was performed in order to reduce background levels of virus internalization due to Env-CD4 interactions, and blocking was achieved by pre-treating the cells at 10 x106 cells/ml with 20 \u03bcg/ml anti-human CD4 antibody (clone SK3) (Biolegend) for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0C before adding them to the antibody-beads/virus mixture. Nevertheless, similar patterns of antibody-dependent signals were observed when sCD4 blocking was omitted from the experimental setup. Following spinoculation, antigens/viruses and cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour for phagocytosis/virion internalization. After incubation, supernatant was removed and cells were washed with PBS. Cells were then fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde. To calculate phagocytosis scores for both the bead based phagocytosis assay and the virion internalization assay, a cutoff was first assigned based on the 95th percentile of the no-antibody control. For each sample, the % of cells above this cutoff was multiplied by their mean fluorescence intensity (MFI), and then normalized to the corresponding result for the no-antibody control to give the final score. A background level of phagocytosis was determined based on the mean + 3 standard deviations (SD) of non-HIV-specific antibodies. To confirm the robustness of the calculated scores, alternative methods of calculation were also used, including dividing the sample MFI by the no-antibody control MFI without assigning a positivity cutoff, as well as subtracting the sample MFI by the no-antibody control MFI. These alternate methods of calculation gave similar results. Robustness of the assay was confirmed by multiple scientists obtaining similar results with control antibodies and also replicating key phagocytosis experiments. We have obtained a range of phagocytosis scores between 2 to 20, giving a 10-fold assay dynamic range. Where relevant, fold differences in phagocytosis score are calculated by a division of the antibody-dependent internalization components of each phagocytosis score (baseline-subtracted), using the formula (Phagocytosis Score A\u20141) / (Phagocytosis Score B\u20141). This calculation is used only when both conditions have an antibody-dependent component.",

Indeed, phenotyping the Fc receptor (FcR) expression of monocytic THP-1 cells as well as freshly isolated blood derived monocytes from HIV-1 negative healthy donors, we observed that monocytes and THP-1 exhibited a different FcR profile (Fig 1B). For the IgA receptor Fc\u03b1RI (CD89), lower expression was found on THP-1 cells compared to primary monocytes (median MFI 1.40 x103 and 2.8 x104, respectively). THP-1 and primary monocytes expressed similar high levels of Fc\u03b3RI (CD64) (median MFI 2.9 x104 and 2.4 x104 respectively). In contrast, THP-1 cells expressed 2.5-fold higher levels of Fc\u03b3RII (CD32) than primary monocytes (median MFI 1.6 x104 and 6.2 x103, respectively). Both THP-1 cells and primary monocytes expressed very low levels of the IgG receptor CD16 (Fc\u03b3RIII) (median MFI of 0.7 x103 and 0.4 x103 respectively), similar to previous reports for classical monocytes [67]. These results suggest that using infectious HIV-1 virions in primary phagocytes instead of HIV-1 envelope-conjugated beads in THP-1 may better mimic in vivo conditions and thus provide more precise information about antibody-mediated virion internalization.",

To date, the ability of HIV-1 specific antibodies to mediate internalization of infectious HIV-1 virions has not been characterized. Thus, to investigate this effector function, we developed a flow cytometric assay capable of demonstrating direct internalization of infectious HIV-1 virions. To allow visualization of internalized HIV-1 virions, they were labelled with the fluorescent proteins mcherry or Tomato [52]. Both THP-1 cells and primary monocytes were capable of internalizing HIV-1 virions in an antibody-specific manner (S1A and S1B Fig).

The erosion of pixels from cell images to identify the internal area of the cell is a part of the standard data analysis software (\u201cInternalization Wizard\u201d) for the ImageStream instrument [77\u201379]. Since the acquired cells are gated on image focus, analyzed cells fall within a particular depth range at which the acquired image represents a cross-section of the cell with consistent membrane thickness [80]. We additionally confirmed this technique by showing that surface-binding fluorescent probes have less fluorescence excluded after erosion compared to internal probes (S2A Fig). After the 5-pixel erosion, some fluorescence was lost in all conditions, since intensity is the sum of all fluorescence observed within the measured area, which decreased. However, the pattern observed between antibody isotypes and subclasses remained unchanged, with CH31 IgG3 having the highest mean virus fluorescence intensity (7.5 x 103 MFI), followed by CH31 IgG1 (5.1 x 103 MFI), then CH31 mIgA1 (3.8 x 103 MFI), and these remained higher than the negative controls (Fig 4D). Furthermore, the percentage of fluorescence lost as the image was eroded was consistent across antibody isotypes/subclasses, indicating that average depth of internalization was similar (Fig 4E, S2B Fig). Thus, ImageStream analysis confirms the antibody-mediated internalization of virus particles.",

Additionally, two IgG1 antibody forms were produced for each epitope\u2014a wild type (SEK) and an ADCC-optimized (AAA/4A) form [58, 59]. We tested these antibodies for phagocytosis of HIV-192Th023-Tomato virions. No differences were found between the two IgG1 forms, so results from IgG1_SEK and IgG1_AAA/4A were aggregated. All antibodies that were positive for phagocytosis in the IgG1 backbone showed higher phagocytosis scores in the IgG3 backbone (Fig 5A and 5B). Specifically, for broadly neutralizing antibodies CH27, CH28 (gp120 CD4-binding site core-specific) [56], non-broadly neutralizing antibodies HG107 (V1/V2-specific, isolated from an RV144 vaccinee) [14] and 7B2 (gp41 PID-specific) [7], IgG3 showed enhanced internalization of infectious HIV-192TH023-Tomato virions (median phagocytosis scores 2.0 to 3.1) compared to their IgG1 counterparts (phagocytosis score 1.2 to 1.7), with an overall 3.2-fold higher phagocytosis score for IgG3 compared to IgG1. For mAbs targeting epitopes not present on virions, such as the C1-conformational epitope and the gp41-conformational epitope, neither IgG3 nor IgG1 internalized virions. Aggregating the paratopes that were positive for virion internalization (CH27, CH28, HG107, 7B2, CH31) allowed statistical comparison of IgG3 and IgG1_SEK subclasses for HIV-192TH023-Tomato virion internalization using a linear mixed effects model, which showed that IgG3 has significantly higher phagocytosis potency than IgG1_SEK across multiple epitopes (p<0.0001) (Fig 5C).",

We previously reported the capacity of mucosal IgG from vaginal wecks to bind infectious virions (i.e. virus capture) [16] and here we selected clinical samples with evidence of virion recognition to test for internalization by phagocytes. Thus, we isolated IgG from vaginal wecks from 14 HIV-1+ women to test for infectious virion capture and binding to different parts of the HIV-1 envelope, including gp41, gp120, gp140, the V1/V2 loop, and the CD4 binding site. Mucosal IgA was not tested, due to low yields of HIV-1 specific IgA in these samples, confirming previous reports [4, 81, 82]. 4/14 samples (total IgG concentration range: 50.2 \u03bcg/ml\u2014129.2 \u03bcg/ml) showed both infectious and non-infectious virus capture. All four samples had high levels of gp41, gp120 and gp140-binding antibodies (Fig 6A). Two of the four participants (PTID16 and PTID34) had V1/V2 loop binding. Two (PTID16 and PTID01) showed CD4bs binding specificity, as represented by differential binding to resurfaced core protein (RSC3) compared to mutants that decrease VRC01-like CD4bs binding specificity (RSC3\u0394371, RSC3G367R, RSC3\u0394371P363N) [64]. Purified IgG from these four participants captured 47\u201361% of total HIV-1BaL virus particles. Purified IgG from these four participants were then evaluated for their ability to mediate virion internalization. Indeed, HIV-1+ mucosal IgG mediated HIV-1BaL virion internalization in monocytes, with median phagocytosis scores of 2.1 to 2.7 (Fig 6B and 6C). Thus, human mucosal IgG from HIV-1+ individuals are capable of mediating both virion capture and IgG-mediated internalization of infectious HIV-1, demonstrating proof of concept that easily elicited antibodies can mediate these potential antiviral effector functions at the portal of HIV-1 entry.",

Here, we identified substantial differences in IgA, IgG1, and IgG3 in mediating virion internalization. Using both flow cytometry and ImageStream cytometry, we demonstrate enhanced virion internalization by IgG3 compared to IgG1, and reduced virion internalization by IgA1 and IgA2 compared to IgG1. A previous report of improved protective functions for IgA1 over IgA2 were determined with antibodies specific for the V3 region of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein and did not include examination of antibody-mediated phagocytosis [46]. Later work by this same group also demonstrated protective capacity for dIgA2 when combined with IgG1 [47]. Our work differs from these prior studies in that we examined a different epitope specificity (i.e. CD4bs vs. V3), monomeric vs dimeric forms of IgA, and a different type of antiviral function (phagocytosis vs. virion capture and transcytosis). Further work is needed to understand if the structure of the IgA (i.e. the longer hinge region of IgA1 over IgA2) is beneficial for some, but not all, epitope specificities and antiviral functions, depending on how occluded or exposed their target site is on the presenting pathogen.",

IgG3 was more potent than IgG1 for all epitope specificities in mediating virion internalization, indicating that the observed effects were not epitope-dependent. Our identification of enhanced IgG3 mediated phagocytic function supports findings in both virus controllers [12] and in RV144 vaccinees [4, 5] that this antibody response is associated with a more functional antibody profile. However, unlike Chung et al. who concluded that IgG3 may only be a surrogate of a functional IgG1 response [6], our data present an additional potential role for direct IgG3 effector function via enhanced antibody-mediated phagocytosis activity, and raise the hypothesis that the correlation of Env IgG3 with reduced HIV-1 risk may be in part due to this improved Fc mediated antiviral function.",

The mechanisms behind the differences among antibody subclasses/isotypes to mediate virion internalization remain to be determined. Potential mechanisms can be divided into effects from paratope binding and effects from Fc receptor engagement by the antibody Fc region. Regarding paratope binding, antibody isotypes/subclasses differ in hinge length, flexibility, and the angle of their Fab arms, and these differences may result in avidity effects that lead to increased virion engagement and internalization, especially in light of the relatively few number of Env spikes on the HIV-1 virion surface. For example, IgG3 has more potent neutralization activity than IgG1 and IgG2, attributed to the longer and more flexible hinge region [83]. Other examples include studies showing that dimeric IgA1 better mediates virus capture compared to IgG1 and dimeric IgA2 [46], although IgG1 and monomeric IgA are equally capable of mediating virion aggregation [84]. Regarding differences in Fc receptor engagement, IgG and IgA engage different Fc receptors, but it is not known how the different signals contribute to internalization. Comparing IgG1 and IgG3, it is known that IgG3 shows stronger binding to several Fc receptors [48], which may have resulted in the observed enhancement in phagocytic activity. In understanding the contributions of each Fc receptor, it is notable that we observed no difference in virion internalization was observed between CH31 IgG1_SEK and CH31 IgG1_AAA antibodies (Fig 5A and 5B). Given that the AAA mutations are designed for optimal binding to Fc\u03b3RIII [58, 59], it is unlikely that differences in phagocytic potency are contributed by binding to Fc\u03b3RIII. This is consistent with the known low expression of Fc\u03b3RIII on classical monocytes [67], as well as previous studies which showed that HIV-1 internalization by IgG is primarily mediated by the interaction of Fc\u03b3RI and Fc\u03b3RII, and not Fc\u03b3RIII in primary monocytes and THP-1 cells [39, 50]. Given that the AAA mutation enhances ADCC, the finding that the AAA mutation does not enhance phagocytosis provides an example demonstrating that interactions which enhance one Fc-mediated function do not necessarily also enhance other Fc-mediated functions. Further studies of the relationship between FcR signalling and antibody-dependent internalization are needed to understand the differences in effector functions between antibody isotypes and subclasses.",

IgA is the dominant antibody isotype in the gut mucosa, and we demonstrate that HIV-1 specific IgA mAbs could mediate infectious virion internalization by primary monocytes.

Advances are needed in characterizing each of these to inform strategies of HIV-1 prevention and cure. One potential method of separating these internalization processes is to utilize the difference in target size, which has been associated with different mechanisms of internalization, where smaller particles are taken up by endocytosis dependent on clathrin, Cbl activation, ubiquitinylation, and proteasome function, while larger particles are taken up by phagocytosis dependent on actin as well as activation of Src, Syk, and PI3K [69\u201371, 73, 74]. We found a similar dichotomy between smaller and larger particles, where smaller particles including 0.2 \u03bcm beads, 40 nm beads, and HIV-1 virions (~0.1 \u03bcm) had higher phagocytosis scores in primary monocytes compared to THP-1 cells, while larger particles (1 \u03bcm beads) had higher phagocytosis scores in THP-1 cells compared to primary monocytes (S3 Fig). These differing phenotypes may point toward different internalization mechanisms for viruses compared with beads, raising the hypothesis that the virus-based and bead-based assays represent phagocytosis of different kinds of targets in vivo. Given that when beads were used as internalization targets instead of virions, we observed no differences between IgG1 and IgA and a non-significant trend toward higher IgG3 than IgG1 phagocytosis potency (Figs 2A, 3A and 3D), antibody isotypes and subclasses may have differing effects in mediating cell and virion phagocytosis. Further work comparing the mechanisms of bead and virion uptake is needed to better understand the HIV-1 correlates of risk that have been identified in non-human primate models using the 1 \u03bcm bead-based phagocytosis assay [8, 10] to determine whether this represents phagocytosis of infected cells or virus particles.",

To count viral foci, a mask determined by the ImageStream IDEAS Spot Wizard algorithm was applied, representing the areas with peak brightness defined by a spot-to-background ratio of 2.0. Spots within this mask were counted. Two representative cells are shown, the upper row showing a cell with 1 virus foci, and the bottom row showing a cell with 14 virus foci (left, bright-field; middle, virus fluorescence; right, virus fluorescence with blue mask demarcating the applied mask for peak brightness). G. The distribution of spot counts is shown for the cells in each CH31 antibody condition. H. The mean number of viral foci is shown for each condition.",

Horizontal black dashed line indicates limit of detection, as calculated using the mean + 3 SD of negative controls in the corresponding assays. B. Data from antibody paratopes positive for phagocytosis (CH27, CH28, HG107, 7B2, CH31) were aggregated by subclass. Box-and-whisker plots indicate 25th and 75th percentiles by box and minimum and maximum scores by whisker. C.

Binding responses to gp41 and ConSgp140 reached saturation. Specific activity for BaL gp120, gp70_B.CaseA_V1_V2, and RSC3 is shown, and samples with FI-background<100 were classified negative. Classification of VRC01 like CD4bs binding antibodies is indicated by the ratio of binding MFI of the CD4bs-exposed RSC3 to CD4bs mutants RSC3\u0394371, RSC3G367R, and RSC3\u0394371P363N, and classification of CD4i antibodies is indicated by CD4i differential, the ratio of binding MFI of HxB2 core to HxB2 core I420R. B. The ability of the mucosal HIV-1+ purified IgG samples to mediate uptake of HIV-1BaL-Tomato by THP-1 cells was analysed by flow cytometry. A representative flow cytometry diagram of virion internalization mediated by mucosal IgG isolated from a vaginal weck from a HIV-1+ woman (PTID16) is shown alongside a representative diagram for a negative control (RSV-specific Palivizumab). C. The ability of mucosal IgG in chronically infected women to mediate virus capture and virion internalization was quantified. Blue circles represent phagocytosis scores for HIV-1BaL-Tomato virions in THP-1 cells (N = 2 independent experiments), while green squares represent virus capture percentages as measured by RT-qPCR (N = 3 independent experiments).",
