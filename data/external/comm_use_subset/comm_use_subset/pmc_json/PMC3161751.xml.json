However, TBP remains difficult to identify despite numerous diagnostic tools [3]. Currently, the definite diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) pleural effusions depends on the demonstration of acid-fast bacilli in the sputum, pleural fluid, or pleural biopsy specimens [4]. Moreover, high levels of IFN-\u03b3 are detected in tuberculosis pleural fluid [5], [6]. Therefore, measurement of IFN-\u03b3 in the pleural fluid has also gained wide acceptance in the diagnosis of TB pleural effusions [7]. However, these assays did not provide information regarding antigen-responsive cells. An abundance of immunocompetent cells in the pleural effusion provides investigators with a good model to study the correlates of a protective immune response at the site of infection. The enrichment of Th1 cells in pleural fluid has been previously documented [8]. However, detailed phenotypic and functional characterizations for these cells are still unknown.",

Previous data have demonstrated that almost all of the CCR5+ and CCR3+CD4+ T cells recruited to the lungs of patients with active TB express the memory T-cell phenotype and that the majority may have been recently activated [21]. CD69 is a membrane molecule transiently expressed on activated lymphocytes, and its selective expression in inflammatory infiltrates probably suggests that it plays a role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases [22]. Previous studies have also demonstrated the usefulness of the determination of CD69 on CD4+ T cells after in vitro stimulation with tuberculin as a rapid indicator of immune sensitization against MTB [23], [24]. However, these studies did not directly assess the function of CD69+ cells.",

We found a significant increase in CD69 expression on CD4+ T cells in PFCs. Importantly, CD4+CD69+ cells were mostly Th1 cells specific for ESAT-6 and CFP-10 peptides. The phenotypic and functional analysis of CD69-expressing cells strongly suggested that CD69 could be a useful marker for the identification or enrichment of antigen specific Th1 cells at local sites following MTB infection.

Our initial experiments indicated that stimulation of PFCs with ESAT-6 and CFP-10 peptides resulted in increased surface CD69 expression that is difficult to elucidate (Data not shown). Short-term stimulation of these cells includes incubation with secretion inhibitory brefeldin A (BFA), which can block the transport of newly synthesized CD69 molecules to the cell surface and thus allows for the direct assessment of the relationship between in vivo CD69 expression and cytokine production. After culturing PFCs with ESAT-6/CFP-10 peptides and BFA, we analyzed the production of Th1 cytokines by intracellular cytokine staining and polychromatic flow cytometry. As shown in Fig 3A and B, CD4+CD69+ T cells produced greater amounts of IFN-\u03b3, IL-2 and TNF-\u03b1 than did CD4+CD69\u2212 T cells. Statistical results demonstrated that the percentages of IFN-\u03b3, IL-2 or TNF-\u03b1-producing CD4+CD69+ T cells were significantly higher than those for CD4+CD69\u2212 T cells (P<0.001, Fig 3C). In order to further confirm that the responses of T cells were specific for MTB, we also stimulated PFCs from tuberculous pleurisy patients with other irrelevant antigens such as SARS-CoV S peptides (STFFSTFKCYGVSATKL) and (NFSQILPDPLKPTK RSFI) as well as hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg). We found that these irrelevant antigens could not induce the production of IFN-\u03b3, IL-2 and TNF-\u03b1 by neither CD4+CD69+ nor CD4+CD69\u2212 T cells. However, following stimulation with MTB-specific peptides of ESAT-6/CFP-10, CD4+CD69+ T cells from the same patients expressed high levels of IFN-\u03b3, IL-2 and TNF-\u03b1 (data not shown).",

We therefore compared the expression of IFN-\u03b3, IL-2 and TNF-\u03b1 in CD4+CD69+, CD4+CD69\u2212 and total CD4+ T cells after short-term in vitro stimulation with ESAT-6/CFP-10 peptides. We showed that CD4+CD69+ and CD4+CD69\u2212 T cells concurrently and individually produced IFN-\u03b3, IL-2 and TNF-\u03b1 (Fig 4A, B). This assay also identified cells that expressed CD69 but lacked expression of any cytokine measured (as evidenced by a subset of CD4+CD69+IFN-\u03b3\u2212IL-2\u2212TNF-\u03b1\u2212 cells). These cells probably contained other effector functions, for example, the secretion of MIP-1\u03b2 or other cytokines. The total antigen-specific responses were defined as the percentages of T cells expressing any combination of IFN-\u03b3, IL-2 or TNF-\u03b1, and thus, seven distinct functional populations could be delineated (IFN-\u03b3/IL-2/TNF-\u03b1 triple expressers; IFN-\u03b3/IL-2, IFN-\u03b3/TNF-\u03b1 or TNF-\u03b1/IL-2 double expressers; or IFN-\u03b3, IL-2 or TNF-\u03b1 single expressers). Interestingly, polyfunctional T cells (IFN-\u03b3/IL-2/TNF-\u03b1 triple expressers) dominated the CD4+CD69+ T cell response. However, frequencies of T cells producing only TNF-\u03b1 were the highest when analyzing the distribution of the seven subsets within either the CD4+CD69\u2212 population or all CD4+ T cells (Fig 4C, D). The percentages of double expressers were similar within CD4+CD69+, CD4+CD69\u2212 and total CD4+ T cells. Our results demonstrated that total MTB-specific CD4+ T cells were not dominated by polyfunctional T cells. However, polyfunctional T cells were primarily enriched within CD4+CD69+ T cells. We further analyzed the correlation between the percentages of CD69-expressing CD4+ T cells and polyfunctional T cells. Interestingly, significant positive correlation between CD4+CD69+ T cells and polyfunctional T cells was observed (Fig 4E, p = 0.0003).",

Moreover, we also examined the expression of CD127 and CD27 and found that CD4+CD69+ T cells had significantly lower expression of both markers (Fig 5B). To further validate whether MTB-specific CD4+CD69+ T cells were memory cells, we tested the phenotype of IFN-\u03b3-secreting CD4+CD69+ T cells by assessing typical memory T cell markers.

We first purified CD4+ T cells and CD14+ cells by positive selection with microbeads. Thereafter, CD4+CD69+ and CD4+CD69\u2212 T cell fractions were obtained by flow cytometry-based cell sorting (Fig 6A). We then cocultured CD4+CD69+ or CD4+CD69\u2212 T cells with CD14+ cells (as antigen-presenting cells) in the presence of ESAT-6/CFP-10 peptides (P1\u2013P6) and measured the production of Th1 cytokines. Notably, considerable levels of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 were produced by CD4+CD69+ T cells, whereas little was observed from the CD4+CD69\u2212 fractions. However, TNF-\u03b1 production was readily detected in unstimulated cells, and significantly higher TNF-\u03b1 was measured following stimulation of the CD4+CD69+ fractions (Fig 6B). Moreover, significantly higher levels of IFN-\u03b3, IL-2 and TNF-\u03b1 were produced by CD4+CD69+ cells than by CD4+CD69\u2212 T cells (P<0.001, Fig 6B).

We further confirmed this observation by incubation of sorted CD4+CD69+ or CD4+CD25+ T cells with CD14+ T cells, respectively. The result demonstrated that neither IFN-\u03b3 nor TNF-\u03b1 was produced by the CD4+CD25+ T cells, whereas CD4+CD69+ T cells produced large amounts of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 upon coculture (Fig 7B), confirming that CD4+CD25+ T cells were hyporesponsive and represented regulatory T cells.

CD4+CD69+ cells stimulated with ESAT-6/CFP-10 peptides (P1\u2013P6) produced considerably greater amounts of Th1 cytokines compared with unstimulated cells.

The development of IFN-\u03b3 release assays (IGRAs) has emerged as an attractive alternative to the tuberculin skin test for detection of latent TB infections and might also contribute to assisting in the diagnosis of TBP [31]. IGRAs are based on the principle that T cells of individuals sensitized with TB antigens produce IFN-\u03b3 when they re-encounter highly MTB-specific antigens such as ESAT-6 and CFP-10. However, this assay precludes further analysis because it is lethal to cells. Moreover, the IGRAs are not recommended on either the blood or the pleural fluid for the diagnosis of TBP [31].",

In order to further confirm that CD4+CD69+ cells were mostly MTB-specific T cells, we performed intracellular cytokine staining. We noted that stimulation of PFCs resulted in increased surface CD69 expression. We overcame this limitation by incubation with BFA during short-term stimulation. Using this method, we were able to directly assess the relationship between in vivo CD69 expression and cytokine production. Using polychromatic flow cytometry, we demonstrated for the first time that the majority of MTB specific Th1 cytokine-producing cells were enriched within the CD4+CD69+ subset, whereas CD4+CD69\u2212 cells scarcely produced cytokines. In addition, PFCs from tuberculous pleurisy patients were stimulated with SARS-CoV S peptides (STFFSTFKCYGVSATKL) and (NFSQILPDPLKPTKRSFI) as well as hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg). These irrelevant antigens could not induce the production of IFN-\u03b3, IL-2 and TNF-\u03b1 by neither CD4+CD69+ nor CD4+CD69\u2212 T cells. However, following stimulation with MTB-specific peptides of ESAT-6/CFP-10, CD4+CD69+ T cells from the same patients with tuberculous pleurisy expressed high levels of IFN-\u03b3, IL-2 and TNF-\u03b1, indicating that the response was MTB-specific.

Our results demonstrated for the first time that the expression of CD69 may be a useful marker for the definition of MTB-specific polyfunctional T cells in vivo. A number of studies in humans suggested that polyfunctional T cells may indeed be involved in mediating protection in TB[34]\u2013[39]. However, it has also been indicated in the recent studies that polyfunctional CD4+ T cells may be a useful biomarker of active TB and that polyfunctional responses are not associated with protection against TB[40].

In our study, however, CD4+CD69+ T cells represented effector or effector memory cells and quickly produced large amounts of cytokines following short-term stimulation. Moreover, we also assessed other markers (Foxp3 and CTLA-4) essential for the suppressive function of regulatory T cells and found that these molecules were not differentially expressed by CD4+CD69+ and CD4+CD69\u2212 T cells, further confirming that CD4+CD69+ T cells were not regulatory T cells (data not shown). These differing results were probably associated with discrepancies in local circumstances, including cytokines, chemokines and antigen presenting cells that differ between tumor and inflammation contexts. Moreover, it remains to be determined if CD69 is induced by the pleural fluid environment or if CD4+CD69+ T cells are selectively recruited from the circulation.",

The majority of CD4+CD69+ T cells but not total CD4+ T cells, were dominated by polyfunctional T cells. Importantly, significantly positive correlation was observed between CD69-expressing CD4+ T cells and polyfunctional T cells, suggesting that CD69 is a good marker for the identification or enrichment of polyfunctional T cells in PFCs.
