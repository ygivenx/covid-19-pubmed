Since the initial identification of PEDV, it has been reported in Canada, Korea, China, Thailand, Italy, Hungary, and Vietnam [4].

Moisture content of feed and ingredients is also impacted by the type of processing method used. The interactions between temperature, time, and moisture play a role in virus inactivation in feed. Ingredients of porcine origin have been thought to have the greatest risk for disease transmission [9]. When processing rendered ingredients for animal feed, the processing conditions vary based on the composition of the raw material. In general, the National Renderers Association suggests temperatures between 115\u00b0C and 145\u00b0C for 40 to 90 min for most rendering systems. Such temperatures are deemed effective in inactivating pathogens such as Salmonella spp. [11]. Similarly, the enveloped classical swine fever RNA virus is readily inactivated in pasteurization processes after only 1 min at 71\u00b0C [12]. High temperatures (around 100\u00b0C) are also used in other processes including micronization to prepare cereal grains [13,14]. The high temperatures used in processing rendered products and cereal grains may also be effective in inactivating PEDV in contaminated feed, but no research has been conducted to compare PEDV survival at temperatures greater than 80\u00b0C.",

More recent applications of ionizing radiation technology such as electron beam (eBeam) are now used to routinely pasteurize foods and decontaminate animal feeds from pathogens [16,17]. The main characteristics of eBeam technology include its non-thermal nature (thereby reducing potential nutrient losses), utilization of commercial electricity (does not rely on radioactive isotopes), high speed processing, and the ability to precisely control the dose delivered [17,18]. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recognized this process as a treatment method for food and animal feed for doses up to 50 kGy [19]. All of these attributes make the eBeam technology attractive for a wide variety of applications, including pasteurization of animal feed.",

The cells were washed three times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.2). After virus inoculation, the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, allowing virus adsorption using maintenance medium (DMEM with gentamicin, neomycin sulfate, fungizone, streptomycin and 10 \u03bcg/mL trypsin). The cells were washed again 60 minutes after inoculation. The washing medium was Hanks' balanced salt solution containing no trypsin. However, the maintenance medium did contain trypsin. Inoculated cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C under 5% CO2. Cells were examined daily under an inverted microscope for the appearance of virus-induced cytopathic effects (CPE) for up to five days post-infection. The virus was harvested by subjecting the infected cells to three freeze-thaw cycles (-80\u00b0C/25\u00b0C) followed by centrifugation at 2500 \u00d7 g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C.

A dose-uniformity ratio was calculated by maximum dose/minimum dose for each experiment. Under ideal circumstances, the dose-uniformity ratio (DUR) should be about 1.0. During commercial processing of animal feed using eBeam technology, the size of the final package needs to be optimized to assure dose uniformity. The optimization involves adjusting the dimensions and weight to ensure adequate penetration of the eBeam electrons as well as dose uniformity within the package. Under commercial processing conditions, the goal is to try to attain as uniform a dose as possible. At the eBeam facility on the TAMU campus, the DUR of a commercial pet food product is 1.78. Aliquots of complete phase II pig starter feed (5 g amounts) were prepared in several 50 mL plastic centrifuge tubes followed by the addition of 1 mL of PEDV to each tube. After mixing, the virus-spiked feed was placed into individual plastic bags. The bags were flattened to remove all of the air and create a thin, even layer of the feed sample. The bags were triple-sealed to meet the biosafety procedures at the eBeam irradiation facility. The sealed bags were shipped on ice via overnight shipping to the National Center for Electron Beam Research at Texas A&M University, College Station, TX.",

A follow-up epidemiological investigation suggested that a batch of spray-dried porcine plasma (SDPP) used in swine nursery feed was the potential source of PEDV infection. In a bioassay experiment, a contaminated SDPP sample was able to infect pigs, however, when added to the complete feed no additional pigs were infected. This was potentially caused by a dilution effect or an extended time period between virus contamination and bioassay [9]. A similar conclusion that feed or feed ingredients could be spreading PEDV between farms was made during an investigation of a PEDV outbreak in Ohio. In this situation, virus was detected in the feed through RT-PCR on a farm with infected sows. In a follow up bioassay, none of the pigs developed an infection after consuming the contaminated feed [7]. In this study, the source of feed contamination was not found, although the RT-PCR test was positive for PEDV. Dee et al. [10] showed that feed experimentally contaminated with PEDV RNA could cause an active infection in pigs when feed was consumed via natural feeding behavior. The collection of references indicates that if complete feed happens to be contaminated with PEDV, it is possible for the contaminated feed to cause an active infection on a farm. In summary, these results suggested that additional research is needed to evaluate potential mitigation strategies to control transmission of PEDV through feed processing methods.",

One study found that a cell culture-adapted strain of PEDV was moderately stable at 50\u00b0C for 30 min, with only a reduction of 0.4 log10 PFU/mL at 50\u00b0C when compared to the control [1]. A further investigation indicated that treating PEDV at temperatures between 60 to 80\u00b0C for 30 min caused a complete loss of infectivity, but the log reduction in virus concentration was not reported [1]. In another study, the survival of a wild type strain of PEDV in fecal samples required only 10 min of exposure at 71\u00b0C to be inactivated to the extent that it was not able to cause infection in live pigs [27]. This variability in virus inactivation could be possibly due to differences in moisture content between the different samples tested.

            "text": "Although the exposure times and temperatures varied in these studies, their results correspond with previous data indicating that PEDV is a low thermally stable virus [4]. Our hypothesis was that the thermal treatment of feed would reduce the survival of PEDV in swine feed. This hypothesis was confirmed by our experimental results which demonstrated that a 3 log (99.9%) reduction of the PEDV concentration is achieved within 25 min of exposure at 120\u00b0C. These results also highlight the finding that temperatures over 130\u00b0C don\u2019t increase the inactivation of PEDV. This is an important observation because excessive heating of high protein feed ingredients results in reductions of amino acid digestibility through Maillard reactions [28]. In addition to the log reduction of PEDV in feed at high temperatures, the production of a shoulder in the inactivation curve produced by the Weibull model also help determine PEDV survival at high temperatures. The observed shouldering phenomenon observed in the inactivation curves may indicate that virus is resistant to a certain temperature-time level combination and a threshold needs to be surpassed to see a significant level of inactivation. Another possible reason for this shoulder in the curve could be the possibility that the feed was cooled when the room temperature inoculum was added. This would mean the first few min the feed was placed back in the oven was spent heating back up to oven temperature, which could explain the plateau in virus concentration. Overall, the results from our experiment confirm that the concentration of PEDV in complete feed can be reduced through the application of heat.",

            "text": "When exploring non-thermal treatment processes to reduce PEDV in feed, an eBeam irradiation dose of 50 kGy was found to be effective in reducing virus concentration by 3 log (99.9%). Currently, the Food and Drug Administration has stipulated an upper dose limit of 50 kGy of ionizing irradiation doses in animal feeds [19]. The use of eBeam processing of animal feeds and diets has been shown to be an effective process for inactivating pathogens in the US [16,17]. Animal feed and bags (weighing about 20 kg) are routinely treated using eBeam processing. Process controls are in place to measure the maximum and minimum doses in these sample bags to meet customer needs and adhere to regulatory limits. Though we have shown that eBeam treatment is effective in reducing the concentration of PEDV in swine feed, follow-up studies are needed to verify the results seen in this study with different types of feed. Our experimental data, suggesting that a target dose of 50 kGy will achieve approximately 3 log10 reduction in PEDV, are important in that it highlights the criticality of ensuring low viral bioburden during feed formulation by adhering to Good Manufacturing Processes. These results suggest that if the initial PEDV bioburden is greater than 4 log10 TCID50, the FDA mandated 50 kGy dose upper limit may not be effective in complete inactivation of virus in these feeds. Furthermore, if the maximum titers of PEDV in commercial swine feed are known, then the dose can be calibrated to theoretically achieve the total elimination of PEDV in commercial swine feed. In addition to more research investigating maximum PEDV titers, it may also be necessary to investigate the use of irradiation on individual feed ingredients. Our experiment only measured the impact of irradiation on complete swine feed, and so it cannot be confirmed if the same results would be seen in individual feed ingredients.",

Organic acids have been used to reduce the prevalence of bacterial pathogens such as Salmonella in poultry feed [21]. In an additional experiment, the antimicrobial product SalCURB, which is used to control Salmonella in feed, was tested for its ability to decrease the presence of viable PEDV in feed. In this experiment, a bioassay showed that the feed treated with the SalCURB product was not able to cause an infection in na\u00efve pigs [30]. A proposed method for how the SalCURB inactivated the PEDV was not reported. Differences in PEDV survival in feed has not only been observed in the presence of additives, but also in the presence of different feed ingredients. In an experiment testing 18 different feed ingredients, it was determined that the survival of PEDV in these ingredients was ingredient specific with an extended survival being observed in soybean meal [31]. This indicates that variation as small as changes in ingredients could change virus survival in feed.",

            "text": "It has been reported that PEDV is stable at a pH of 6.5 to 7.5 at a temperature of 37\u00b0C [32]. Because intestinal viruses must survive the acidic conditions of the stomach, they are generally more resistant to acidic pH. With this being said a change in pH outside of ideal conditions for an extended period could cause an increase in virus inactivation. A previous review reported that the pH of the diet was decreased from an average pH of 5.96 to 4.71 when organic acids (fumaric, propionic, formic, citric, sodium citrate, hydrochloric, sodium fumaric, or malic acid) were added to feed [33]. This pH decrease of the diet was hypothesized to decrease the survival of PEDV in the presence of additives. The results from our study did not necessarily support this hypothesis. Activate DA and KEM-GEST were the most effective in reducing virus survivability and also had the most acidic pH values when added to feed, which confirm the original hypothesis. However, Ultracid P did not result in a different diet pH compared with KEM-GEST, yet it had the highest delta value of all additives evaluated. In addition to this, the feed sample would require a type of liquid to be added to the feed for pH to even play a role, as a dry substrate will not have a pH. In the experiment, 1mL of virus media was added to the sample and mixed. This means it could be possible for the pH of the media to change because of the additive when the virus was initially added. If this single change were to explain the differences in survival for our experiment, there would be a more prominent pattern between the pH of the feed solution and the delta value observed. With a lack of a clear pattern between pH and virus survival, and in some cases no difference between the pH of the solution with the control and with some of the additives tested, there is another aspect causing the changes in virus survival between the feed additives used.",

We hypothesized that specific active ingredients play a role in differences in virus survivability among additives. Many of the less effective additives contained citric acid and lactic acid as active ingredients. It has been previously shown that citric and lactic acids only have moderate antimicrobial activity because they are solely effective at a low pH in the environment [34]. Because most swine feed samples have a neutral pH, it is not surprising that additives containing citric acid as an active ingredient may not have been as effective in inactivating PEDV. In contrast, fumaric acid has been shown to be a very effective antimicrobial, and is extremely effective in reducing the survivability of E. Coli [35]. No studies have been published to show that fumaric acid is an effective anti-viral compound, but its presence in KEM-GEST, which resulted in the second lowest PEDV survivability in our study, implies it may also be an effective ingredient in reducing survivability of PEDV. The active ingredient of Activate DA, the most effective additive in our study, is 2-hydroxy-4-methylthiobutanoic acid. This ingredient has been researched exclusively as a cost effective supplement in low methionine diets for swine [36]. Although it has not been approved for use as an antimicrobial or antiviral agent, the results from our study suggest it could have potential in reducing virus survivability. Overall, careful selection of additives containing the most effective active ingredients is necessary for achieving reduced PEDV survivability in complete swine feeds. Further research is needed to confirm the relative effectiveness of each active ingredient and how they may interact with each other.",

This increase in moisture potentially caused changes in the inactivation of the virus when exposed to heat that may not be observed in the low moisture conditions of animal feed. It has been demonstrated that PEDV inactivation using heat treatments and changes in pH differs in liquid media compared with a dried plasma product [37]. Because our experiments investigated both change in pH through an additive and change in heat treatment, our increased moisture from inoculating the sample could cause different inactivation kinetics than what would be seen in dry feed without media. In addition to this, the humidity in the environment was not controlled and the water activity of the samples were not measured. Without measuring these variable there is no way to tell the role they played in the inactivation of PEDV in the feed samples. In addition to unknown water activity, this experiment also had the limitation of low starting virus titers. This made it impossible to reach the standard of complete inactivation (typically 7 log reduction) because the starting virus titers were only 4 logs.",
