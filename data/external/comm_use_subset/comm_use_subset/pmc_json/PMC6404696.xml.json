Clinicians should also contemplate asthma, bronchiolitis (respiratory syncytial virus) or adenovirus in the differential diagnosis for children.13 Of special note, in infants nearly all fatal cases of pertussis present with an extreme leukocytosis with lymphocytosis.17 Thus, obtaining a CBC may be helpful to distinguish between causes of cough in pediatric patients; however, its utility remains limited. Adults presenting with cough may have non-infectious causes for their symptoms such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, or gastroesophageal reflux disease.22 Foreign body aspiration is also possible in patients presenting with cough and is sometimes associated with cyanosis or apnea.",

Patients who have had a persistent cough for weeks, and perhaps months, may be in the convalescent phase. All of the aforementioned presentations may represent a patient with pertussis, making careful reviews of exposure history and immunization status essential.

The Pertussis 3I tool can also alert the healthcare workforce to the appropriate isolation protocols for use during contact with a symptomatic patient. With this added knowledge, healthcare workers can protect both themselves and others (especially infants and pregnant women) from contracting disease. Further, they can educate patients, in addition to exposed individuals, on the importance of early antimicrobial therapy as well as notify the appropriate hospital and public health agencies.
