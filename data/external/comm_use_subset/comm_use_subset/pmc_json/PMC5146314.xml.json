            "text": "Rotavirus (RV) infection is the leading cause of moderate to severe acute diarrheal disease in young animals [1]. Since its discovery in 1973, RV has been established as the most common cause of acute viral gastroenteritis among human infants and the neonates of most farm animal species worldwide [2,3]. In piglets, 25-30% mortality is seen during the preweaning period [4,5]. Among infectious agents associated with neonatal enteric disease, RV, Coronavirus, Cryptosporidium, and Escherichia coli collectively are responsible for 75-95% of infection in which RV alone accounts for about 27-36% [2]. RV belongs to the genus RV under the family Reoviridae[6]. They are nonenveloped, icosahedral particles consisting of eleven segments of double-stranded RNA enclosed in a triple-layered protein capsid [7]. RVs are classified into G-type and P-type based on the VP7 and VP4 structural genes, respectively [8]. RV is highly infectious and may be transmitted via the fecal-oral route and in respiratory droplets [9,10]. Infected viruses preferentially multiply in the intestinal epithelia and cause extensive damage to the enterocytes. This results in malabsorption leading severe to acute diarrhea [11].",

Almost all rural household has minimum of one to two or more pigs in their backyard [12]. Pig meat (pork) is very popular among all the tribes of the state. Despite having enormous potential of pig farming in Arunachal Pradesh, due to lack of proper technical knowledge and guidance most of the pig farmers suffers heavy loss due to various kinds of diseases, of which neonatal diarrhea caused by RV is one of the most important diseases in piglets. The prevalence of RV infections in animals has been well documented from different parts of India [5,13,14]. However, no data on distribution of RV among pig population of Arunachal are available as no systematic study has been carried out so far. Studies conducted in Assam, a neighboring state of Arunachal Pradesh, have clearly indicated the presence of RV among pig population of the state [4,15]. In Assam, the overall prevalence of RV was found to be 41.5% where maximum numbers of positive cases were found in piglets (46.3%) followed by human (40%) and cattle (37.1%) [16]. To protect and reduce the prevalence of the disease, epidemiological studies in Arunachal Pradesh are of utmost importance besides developing technologies for the virus isolation, identification and above all molecular characterization of the virus for future vaccine strategy.",

In organized farms, animals were maintained mostly on concrete floors while wooded floors are used in unorganized farms. Further, in organized farms, animals were reared following modern scientific managemental practices such as regular deworming, proper vaccination, etc. In unorganized farms, such practices were not followed. The piglets (2-4 months age) and corresponding sows (mothers\u2019) were targeted for studying the RV prevalence.

This is in agreement with the findings of earlier study carried out by Nath[22]. Higher prevalence of RV antibodies in adult pigs might be due to repeated exposure to RV infection at different stages of their life. Highest seroconversion rate (up to 1:640) recorded in adult pigs in the present study also supported this view. In piglets also, a highseropositivity (63.20%) for RV was detected in the present study. In preweaned pigs, RV specific antibodies were recorded up to 72.5% and piglets also possessed comparatively higher antibody titer (up to 1:160). High percentage of seropositive clearly indicated that piglets acquire RV specific antibody via colostrum. These findings are in accordance with that of Hess and Bachmann [24]. They also reported a high percentage of RV seropositivity in piglets, which was due to colostralantibody. Considering the samples from different districts, Papumpare district of Arunachal Pradesh showed highest numbers of seropositive animals (68.75%) followed by upper Subansiri (64.91%) while West Siang district showed lowest positivity rate (61.22%). Higher seropositivity in the said districts may be due to the more pig population density in these districts in comparison to the other districts of Arunachal Pradesh [20] and the unorganized type of farming followed by the farmers as reported by earlier worker [22].",
