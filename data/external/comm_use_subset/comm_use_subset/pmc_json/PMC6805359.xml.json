The name rotavirus is derived from the Latin word \u201cRota\u201d (wheel) because of their wheel-like appearance under the electron microscope (EM) [2]. RVs are associated with more than 100 million infections in humans, and 2 million hospitalizations and 210 000 deaths annually in children < 5 years old [3]. In animals, RV infections result in slow growth, lethargy and mortality, causing significant losses to farmers [4, 5].",

Within the RV genus, ten genogroups/serogroups (A\u2013J) have been identified to date based on the molecular and antigenic characteristics of VP6, the inner capsid protein. RVAs, RVBs and RVCs infect humans and a wide range of mammals, RVDs infect chickens and turkeys, RVEs infect pigs only, RVFs and RVGs infect chickens, and RVHs infect both humans and pigs [8, 9]. RVIs and RVJs were recently detected in dogs in Hungary and in bats in Serbia, respectively [10, 11].",

Porcine RVC is common in contaminated environments and normally is spread by acutely or subclinically infected animals shedding the virus via feces. RVC replicates in mature enterocytes near the tips of the villi, causing diarrhea [14]. Previously known as pararotavirus, porcine RVC was first detected in a 27-day-old piglet with diarrhea from a herd in Ohio in 1980 [12]. RVC was initially thought to cause only sporadic diarrhea outbreaks in swine, but recent studies have shown that its prevalence is much higher than previously estimated, especially among nursing, 1- to 10-day-old piglets, causing significant economic loses to farmers and the pork industry [15, 16]. Currently, RVC is a major cause of gastroenteritis in neonatal (< 1 week of age) piglets. Additionally, recent studies utilizing molecular diagnostic techniques revealed an increase in the prevalence of porcine RVC in pigs of different ages, with or without diarrhea in the US, Canada, Brazil and Europe [15\u201320].",

            "text": "Piglets are born immunocompetent and their mucosal immune system is equipped with innate immune defense mechanisms, which provide the first line of defense against pathogens [22]. However, they are agammaglobulinemic at birth and their adaptive immune system is immature. Thus, they cannot rapidly mount protective immune responses against infections including RV [23, 24] and rely on protection by colostrum and milk-derived Abs during early life [25]. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) is the most prevalent isotype in colostrum and protects against systemic infections, while secretory IgA (sIgA) is prevalent in milk and is associated with the local (mucosal) defense system [26\u201328]. Isotype switching from IgM to IgA occurs mainly in the germinal centers in the gut-associated-lymphoid tissue (GALT). The transfer of IgA plasmablasts from the gut to the mammary gland and the eventual release of sIgA into milk in swine is documented but not well understood [29\u201331]. Although some knowledge of lactogenic immunity against RVA and enteric coronaviruses was generated using porcine and rodent animal models [32\u201337], lactogenic protection of piglets against RVC has not been evaluated. In contrast to RVA, RVC pathogenesis is poorly understood and the role of maternal passive immunity in alleviating the clinical disease not been studied. Intriguingly, although RVA diarrhea is rare in suckling piglets and becomes more prevalent after weaning, suckling status does not seem to mitigate RVC diarrhea in piglets. However, whether it is associated with insufficient levels of maternal RVC Abs or with low minimum RVC infectious dose (compared with other swine enteric viruses) is not known [15, 18\u201320, 38, 39].",

Samples were collected from one farm with 5000 gilts/sows and with all-in-all-out biosecurity measures and requiring 3 days without other pig contact for admission. Diarrhea determination was as follows: Solid or pasty feces = healthy, while liquid and watery feces = diarrheic. Milk and serum were collected once from sows ranging from day 2 to day 11 after farrowing (Additional file 1). Blood was centrifuged at 2095 \u00d7 g for 10 min to obtain serum and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until use. Milk samples were filtered through a 70 \u03bcm pore filter and centrifuged at 1800 \u00d7 g for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C to separate fat, skim milk and cell pellet portions. Fat was removed utilizing sterile plain-tipped applicators (Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH). Skim milk was collected, centrifuged at 28 000 \u00d7 g for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C to separate the whey that was then stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until tested. Rectal swabs from piglets (2\u201311 days, n = 4/L) were collected once by inserting Dacron swab 3\u20135 cm into the rectum and rotating it against the rectal wall several times. In total, 113 piglets\u2019 rectal swabs, 30 sows\u2019 milk and 30 sows\u2019 blood samples were obtained.

Gilt/sow serum and milk were serially diluted fourfold in PBS (1:25, 1:100, 1:400 and 1:1600 for cocktail mix and 1:400, 1:1600, 1:6400 and 1:25 600 for genotype specific) and added (100 \u00b5L) to the duplicate wells of washed immunoassay plates. The plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h and washed 3\u00d7 using wash buffer. Anti-swine IgG or IgA conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:250 in PBS, 100 \u00b5L) were added and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h then washed 3\u00d7 with washing buffer. 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine substrate (100 \u00b5L) (Life Technologies) was added and reaction was stopped with 1 m hydrochloric acid (100 \u00b5L) after 15 min. The plates were read using an ELISA microplate reader (Molecular Devices SPECTRAMAX 340 PC 384, Sunnyvale, California) at 450 nm. The ELISA Ab titer was expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution that had a corrected A450 value (sample absorbance in the serum/milk samples wells minus sample absorbance in RVC negative serum (serum collected from Gn piglets with no virus) greater than the cut-off mean corrected A450 value of negative controls plus 3 standard deviations).",

            "text": "Traditionally, RVA was thought to be the major group of RVs causing diarrhea in nursing piglets. For decades, RVA epidemiology, pathogenesis and immunity were studied extensively [45\u201347]. However, recent studies have shown that RVC is endemic in swine worldwide and its economic importance can no longer be neglected [15, 18\u201320, 48, 49]. Continuous screening of RVC infections in swine is necessary to estimate RVC prevalence and to understand the protective potential of maternal RVC Abs to develop better preventive and control measures. Recent studies have shown that porcine RVC prevalence in nursing pigs is high and we hypothesized that higher prevalence would be observed in diarrheic piglets when compared with healthy piglets. Our results show that overall RVC prevalence in nursing piglets was 76.1%, in agreement with recent studies that demonstrated high RVC prevalence in nursing piglets [15, 19]. The increased RVC shedding in diarrheic piglets (82.5%) when compared with healthy piglets (69.9%) coincided with increased diarrhea prevalence suggesting its pathogenic role. Although, our results suggest that not only nursing piglets with clinical signs shed RVC RNA, but also asymptomatic nursing piglets, we observed significantly higher (p = 0.0419) shedding titers in fecal samples of diarrheic piglets when compared with healthy RVC positive piglets. Our finding that RVC prevalence was much higher in these samples when compared with porcine RVA and RVB is in agreement with previous data by Marthaler et al. [19] showing that porcine RVB is more often detected in older pigs whereas RVC is more frequently detected in very young piglets. Because RVA-associated diarrhea is more prevalent in older, suckling and weaned piglets, it was suggested that maternal Abs confer sufficient early protection to nursing piglets [50\u201353]. In contrast, RVC diarrhea prevalence was highest and increasing in nursing piglets, suggesting that RVC lactogenic protection and pathogenesis of RVC might be distinct from that of RVA and needs to be evaluated further.",

            "text": "To evaluate the influence of lactogenic immunity on the development of clinical RVC disease, accurate tools for serodiagnosis are required. Due to the lack of a cell culture system permissive to various RVC strains (except Cowden G1 strain) and insufficient information on pathogenesis, diversity and immunity for porcine RVC, commercial porcine RVC Ab detection ELISA assays have not been developed [54]. RVC G3 (RV0104) and G6 (RV0143) genotypes were recently identified as dominant in Ohio swine farms [15]. Additionally, Marthaler et al. [16] has recently demonstrated that G6 was the main G-genotype currently circulating in the US (70% of all RVC strains tested) G6 (70%), followed by G5 (17%), G1 (12%), and G9 (1%). In this study, we confirmed that these new circulating RVC strains (RV0104 G3 and RV0143 G6), and the historic Cowden G1 possess distinct P-types of P18, P5 and P1 respectively, suggesting that VP4 proteins from all three strains also need to be included in VLP preparations used for Ab ELISA. To our knowledge, this is the first RVC VLP-based antigen ELISA for Ab detection against the three major G-type genotype [G1 (Cowden), G3 (RV0104), G6 (RV0143)] of RVCs circulating in the US. This ELISA was further used to evaluate whether insufficient levels of maternal RVC Abs are associated with clinical disease in nursing piglets.",

            "text": "Because there is no transplacental transfer of immunoglobulins in swine, piglets are born agammaglobulinemic which makes availability of colostral/milk Abs critical for their survival, growth and protection against invading pathogens [24]. Because RVC is an intestinal pathogen, the presence of maternal Abs (mainly IgA) in sufficient quantities in the gut is of utmost importance. Our results show that gilts had significantly (p = 0.0002) higher numbers of diarrheic litters when compared with sows (multiple parity), supporting previous findings showing that piglets born to gilts\u2019 had increased mortality rates following PEDV infection and that mortality rates declined with increased sow parity number [55]. Also, previous studies demonstrated that IgG and IgA Ab levels in serum, colostrum and milk of multiparous sows, as well as in serum of their piglets, were higher than those of first parity gilts and their piglets, respectively [56\u201358]. Studies of porcine RVA have shown that maternally derived Abs play a significant role in mitigating clinical disease following RV infection in neonatal swine and that the protection afforded by these antibodies is titer dependent [59]. We observed that milk IgA and IgG Ab titers were significantly higher (p = 0.0251 and p = 0.0286, respectively) in sows with healthy piglets when compared with gilt/sows with diarrheic piglets. Although some studies showed that serum IgG and IgA Abs levels were higher in sows than in gilts [56, 57], we observed no differences in RVC serum IgG and IgA Ab levels between sows with heathy piglets and sows/gilts with diarrheic piglets. Thus, as noted in studies of immunity to TGEV and PEDV [60, 61], our current results suggest that the local secretion of RVC Abs in milk, and not the levels of systemic RVC Abs contribute to piglet protection against clinical RVC disease. Lastly, we observed significantly higher IgA (p = 0.0231) and IgG (p = 0.0184) Ab titers in milk of multiparous swine when compared with gilts, suggesting that local secretion of IgA in milk or trafficking of IgA plasmablasts from the gut to the mammary glands might be influenced by the parity number [61]. Interestingly, in Cowden genotype specific ELISA, we observed higher IgA and IgG Ab titers in serum, but lower levels in milk when compared with the RV0104 G3 genotype suggesting that currently circulating RVC strains may stimulate anamnestic immune responses and gut-mammary trafficking of the infecting RVC genotype more efficiently. More studies are needed to determine the mechanisms involved in the maternal Ab transfer in milk via the gut-mammary axis.",

In addition, we have developed the first RVC multi-genotype VLP-based Ab ELISA for quantitation of RVC Ab. Further, we used this ELISA to measure the levels of RVC IgA and IgG Abs in sow/gilt milk and serum samples and established that lower levels of milk IgA/IgG Abs were strongly associated with the development of clinical disease and the increased RVC shedding in piglets. Finally, our results suggest that piglets born to gilts vs. multiparous sows are at higher risk of diarrheal disease induced by RVC and possibly other pathogens. Thus, our findings provide new knowledge relevant to the management of infectious diarrhea in piglets to reduce its impact on the swine industry.",
