HBV is also an important public health issue in China [2], as national surveys conducted since the 1970s have repeatedly showed high morbidity from HBV infections in the general population [3,4]. To address this challenge, many scholars now to study the disease using different approaches (e.g., pathology, immunology and epidemiology), but none of these approaches incorporate spatial information [5]. With the development of Geographic Information System (GIS) technology and its applications in epidemiology [6], it has become clear the spatial information has great value in Epidemiology. Spatial epidemiology is a branch of epidemiology that uses spatial information to extend the analysis of disease distribution and risk factors. This information serves as a powerful analytical tool for epidemiological studies and will likely show greater significance in the future [7]. Our team have done some works on spatial epidemiology [8,9,10].",

Spatial epidemiology also explores the decisive elements that can impact public health and provides strategies and measures for disease prevention and cure and health promotion and hygiene services [7,11]. Research on this subject mainly utilizes four elements: disease mapping, risk assessment in relation to a point or line source, disease clustering analysis and geographical correlation studies [11]. Disease mapping is the most important tool in spatial epidemiology and is used to describe and evaluate disease area distribution [7]. The most typical example of disease mapping is the epidemiological investigation of a cholera outbreak caused by street water pollution in London in 1854 [12,13]. The assessment of risk factors is similar to geographical correlation studies in that they both focus on studying cause of geographical phenomenon. Moreover, analysis of disease clustering uses statistical methods to identify disease spatial aggregation, thus providing corresponding methods to search for etiologic clues [7,14,15].",

However, exploring the risk factors for disease is complex and difficult, especially for diseases in which it is difficult to obtain patient exposure information, and data involving patients\u2019 privacy [7]; this challenge represents a weak link in epidemiological studies. Compared with other infectious diseases such as schistosomiasis [19,20], most respiratory system diseases [21] and cardiovascular diseases [8], the spatial risk factors for hepatitis B are less obvious, and there have been few studies on this aspect. In view of this problem, this study sought to explore the spatial risk factors for hepatitis B and to discover the relationship between these risk factors and hepatitis B morbidity.",

Spatial access to health services refers to overcoming spatial obstacles to medical facilities [22,23]. Based on different application environments and requirements, many different research methods are used to measure spatial access. Among the numerous methods, the gravity model (also known as the potential model) and the two-step floating catchment area method are the most widely used [24,25]. However, both methods have flaws; the gravity model is somewhat abstract and difficult to understand, and the two-step floating catchment area method ignores the spatial access differences in demand points within the same search scope and the spatial access values in demand points outside of the search scope [26]. It is also difficult to set a reasonable search radius for each medical facility [27]. This current study used an improved two-step floating catchment area model to overcome these limitations. In particular this model considers the effect of distance decay by setting weighted distance values, and this improved method is also an effective method for setting a reasonable search radius for each medical facility. These two changes significantly improve the accuracy of measuring spatial access to health services.",

Similarly, the values in Figure 8b,c were 9, 4, 2 km and 12, 5, 2.3 km, respectively. These values showed the same corresponding relationship with hospital level. Within the three groups, Cuizhu, Huaqiang North and Huafu were the sub-districts with the most spatial access. Figure 8d\u2013f shows three contour maps, for which kriging interpolation was used, that were also based on the different search radius values. The locations of high and low spatial access were approximately the same, and the distribution of access was uneven as well. In general, there were three centres with high spatial access, which were concentrated in the southwest, south and northeast, and two low-access centres, which were concentrated in the northwest and southeast. The reason for this distribution pattern is that most of the high-quality medical resources are concentrated in the southern area, which is the economic centre of Shenzhen. In addition, most of the level-A hospitals which have sufficient paramedics, advanced medical facilities, and professional medical staff, are located in the same region, whereas in areas with low spatial access, there is a lack of medical resources to meet the demands of the surrounding population.",

It can be seen from these three figures that regardless of the search radius, in sub-districts with high hepatitis B morbidity, the spatial access index was generally higher; whereas in sub-districts with low morbidity, the spatial access index was generally lower.
