A decrease in CMV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells has been associated with progressive CMV-replication [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. More recently, additional T-cell subsets have been recognized to have important roles [9]. For example, internal regulatory mechanisms such as regulatory T-cells (T-regs; CD4+CD25+FoxP3+) may modify CMV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell functions leading to an increased risk for progressive CMV-replication [10]. T-regs primarily function through the release of inhibitory cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 [10]. T-regs play an important role in maintaining self-tolerance and are being studied as a potential means to promote an immunotolerant state post-transplant [11]. Following liver transplantation, high frequencies of T-regs in peripheral blood and hepatic tissue were associated with a more aggressive recurrence of hepatitis C virus [12].",

The kinetics of virus replication however, is only weakly associated with future outcomes such as progressive replication and the development of tissue-invasive disease. Novel immunological biomarkers, such as virus-specific T-cell responses might bridge this gap in our knowledge. The full repertoire of T-cell responses including absolute T-regs and Th-17 subsets has not been studied in transplant recipients with active CMV-replication. We hypothesized that following transplantation significant alterations occur in T-regs and Th-17 dynamics in the setting of CMV-replication. The present study aimed to prospectively assess CMV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, total T-regs, and Th-17 frequencies in transplant recipients with concurrent CMV-replication. These immunological parameters were assessed simultaneously with clinical parameters such as CMV viral-load, kinetics of clearance, and relapse rates. We aimed to use those markers to predict clearance at onset of viremia and relapse after stop of treatment.",

Patients, who commenced antiviral treatment, underwent follow-up blood sampling at regular time intervals (see below, Figure S1). Those who did not start treatment only had an initial sample drawn at the time of first viremia detection, unless later in the follow-up anti-viral treatment was required. Clinical outcomes and follow-up data were collected for a minimum of six months post-enrollment. The decision to use anti-viral treatment and the type of therapy used was at the discretion of the treating physician. The management of patients was guided by the local institutional protocol in which patients with low-level viremia (<10,000 copies/mL) are managed by surveillance without antiviral treatment.

The assay has a lower limit of quantification of 500 copies/mL and a dynamic range of approximately 6-log10 copies [20] and has been validated against the commercially available COBAS Amplicor CMV Monitor assay. After initial detection, all patients had weekly viral-load testing performed. For patients who commenced anti-viral treatment, individual viral kinetic calculations were performed. Viral-load was plotted against time and best-fit exponential decay curves were applied to generate appropriate mathematical descriptions of virologic outcomes [21]. The slope of the decay curve was calculated based on this best-fit line. In this context, the more negative the decay slope, the more rapid the viral clearance. Positive initial decay slopes indicate increasing viral-loads co-incident with the initiation of treatment.",

The median time to CMV-replication post-transplant was 151 days (range 26\u2013644 days). The majority (93.3%) of patients were receiving immunosuppression with a calcineurin inhibitor [tacrolimus or cyclosporine], prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) at the time of initial CMV detection. No patient was on sirolimus [Table 1]. Previous anti-CMV prophylaxis had been administered to 73.3% of patients. No patient had biopsy proven acute rejection within a three-month period of follow-up after the initial detection of CMV. No statistically significant difference in CMV serological status was present between patient groups. There was a higher percentage of D+/R\u2212 patients in the progressive viremia group vs. the spontaneous clearance group (45% vs. 30%; p = 0.69) although this was not statistically significant. No significant difference in type of immunosuppression or transplanted organ was observed between the two groups [p = n.s.].",

ROC curve analysis has been used to determine cutoffs for prediction of disease that have optimal sensitivity and specificity. We found that the best predictor of both spontaneous clearance of viremia and relapse after treatment was the frequency ratio of CMV CD4+ T cells: T-reg.

Sester et al. determined that CMV-lysate specific CD4+ T-cells above 0.25% were protective against CMV-replication. In our study, we found that CMV-specific CD4+ T-cells greater than 1.4% were associated with spontaneous resolution of viremia, whilst a value below 1.5% (one month after treatment discontinuation) was associated with an increased risk of relapse. A positive correlation was also found between the frequency of CMV-specific CD4+ T-cells and the speed of viral decay. Stable CMV-specific CD4+ T-cell responses have been associated with control of late CMV reactivation in transplant recpient [4], [8], [22]; whereas CMV-specific CD8+ T-cells seem to be more important in primary infection and during early phases after transplantation [3], [6].",

This can occur in acute infections, but is predominantly observed in chronic viral infections. During chronic infection, T-regs may play two potential roles: a beneficial role limiting collateral tissue damage, and a detrimental role impairing antiviral immune responses [27], [28]. Virus-specific T-regs have rarely been examined, but it is likely that the whole T-reg population contains at least some virus-specific cells. These populations are probably generated in parallel with virus-specific effector T-cell responses. This concept has recently been illustrated in a coronavirus infection model [29] and may represent a mechanism that serves to protect against an excessive immune response post exposure. Other acute viral infection models provide further support to this proposed role of T-regs in limiting immune-mediated pathology e.g. West Nile virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza A virus replication [30], [31], [32].",

An important factor in the generation of \u2018induced\u2019 T-regs appears to be TGF-\u03b2 [38], [39]. There are limited in vitro data for the role of CMV-proteins in the regulation of T-reg generation. In a co-culture model of T-cells and murine-CMV infected fibroblasts, an up-regulation of TGF-\u03b2 and IL-10 expression was observed which subsequently induced T-cell differentiation to T-regs [40]. Our study is unable to answer in detail the question as to whether CMV-replication influences T-reg development or function. Nevertheless, the observed correlation between T-reg frequency at baseline and viral-load quantification over the ensuing two weeks (R2 = 0.61) would suggest that T-regs may play an important role in regulating CMV-replication. The role of Th-17 responses during viral infection are poorly characterized, but virus-specific IL-17-producing CD4+ T-cells have been detected in mice following infection with murine-CMV, herpes simplex virus, and influenza virus [15], [16], [17]. The generation of polarized Th-17 cells during viral infection has been correlated with high levels of IL-6 and may also be influenced by transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) [41]. Th-17 cells are implicated in driving harmful inflammation during autoimmunity, and IL-17 may contribute to immunopathology during host responses against viruses. In our study, we did not find Th-17 cell frequencies correlated with CMV outcomes.",

We tried to minimize this effect by studying two very distinct groups of patients (those who required anti-viral treatment compared with those who spontaneously cleared viremia). However, until these results are confirmed in a larger subset of patients, this study should be considered preliminary, since the effect of co-factors such as transplant type, immunosuppressive regimen and D/R serostatus may only be apparent with larger sample sizes. These factors were not significant predictors of outcome in this group although the immunosuppression used was relatively homogenous. In a study of 259 patients with CMV disease, neither D/R status nor transplant type had an effect on viremia clearance [42]. The intensity of immunosuppression had a modest effect on time to viral clearance but showed no association with overall clearance rates or recurrence [43]. Secondly it would be interesting to measure CMV-specific T-regulatory and CMV-specific Th-17 cells. Unfortunately, the frequency of these cells is very low in peripheral blood and in vitro cultivation could well generate an expansion bias. Thirdly, the precise effects of T-regs on CMV-specific T-cells can be assessed in various ways. We chose to evaluate the frequencies of CMV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells by using interferon gamma as the predominant cytokine produced in response to specific stimulation. Production above background was used to identify responsive virus-specific T-cells (>0.2%). However, the functional impact of T-regs could primarily affect other markers such as interleukin 2 or T-cell proliferation.",

Larger multicenter studies are required to further explore the predictive value of CMV-specific T-cell and T-reg monitoring after transplantation. This may help individualize patient management.
