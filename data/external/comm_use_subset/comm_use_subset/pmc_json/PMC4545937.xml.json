Furthermore, studies have been limited to viruses affecting the respiratory tract even though there is evidence that enteric viruses [i.e porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), human-noroviruses, adenoviruses and enteroviruses] can also be transmitted through the air [17\u201320].",

These viruses were selected because of their differences in pathogenesis and modes of transmission. IAV, important because of its zoonotic potential, is shed only in respiratory secretions of pigs, and it is well established that it can be transmitted through aerosols. Porcine reproductive respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a systemic virus that can be shed in many body secretions [21], is exhaled in air, and has been detected in air as far as 9.1 km from swine herds [22]. Lastly, PEDV, an emerging virus in North America [23], is an enteric virus that primarily replicates in large quantities in the small intestine, is largely concentrated in feces of diarrheic pigs and can replicate in alveolar macrophages [24]. The information from this study may contribute to the understanding of airborne transmission of viruses of different pathogenesis and routes of transmission, which is necessary to fully prevent the spread of infectious diseases.",

This procedure was repeated 3 times each day and final scores were averaged. The respiratory disease score was defined as the number of pigs with coughing and/or sneezing episodes (i.e. one or several episodes in a sequence by an individual pig) registered in 3 minutes. The respiratory score was calculated as a percent by dividing the number of animals with coughing and/or sneezing episodes by the total number of animals observed and multiplying the result by 100 [30].",

Furthermore, because virus isolation is typically unsuccessful for North American variants of PEDV, a bioassay was performed by inoculating three susceptible piglets with air samples that tested PEDV RT-PCR positive. Briefly, four 10-day-old pigs from a PEDV-negative farm were purchased and each pig allocated to a separate isolation room. Each pig was intra-gastrically inoculated as described earlier in methods with PBS only (negative control) or 2 ml of pooled air samples containing the collection media of the cyclonic air collector diluted 1:10 with PBS to obtain a total of 20 ml of inoculation material per pig. All pigs were euthanized 4 days post-exposure by injection of 2 ml of pentobarbital (Fatal-Plus, 100 mg/kg IV) into the external jugular vein. Histomorphology analysis was then performed.",

However, virus viability was particle size dependent with IAV and PRRSV isolated only from particles larger than 2.1 \u03bcm. PEDV, primarily an enteric virus, was found in larger concentrations than PRRSV and IAV while suspended in the air. Our results support the relevance of the aerosol route in the transmission of IAV, PRRS and PED viruses.",

This is important because it shows that viruses in airborne particles emitted or generated by animals can be transmitted simultaneously across both short and long distances. Although various conditions, including environmental temperature and relative humidity can affect the size distribution of aerosols, the findings from this study are relevant given that the viruses were emitted by pigs housed under environmental conditions similar to those found in environments where pigs and people interact.",

The association of increasing virus infectivity and concentration, with increasing particle size, has been reported before, and it has been shown to follow a power law relationship greater than 3 [4]. The bigger the particle, the higher the probability that it will carry virus and be infectious. In this study, viability was only shown for PRRSV and IAV in particles bigger than 2.1 \u03bcm in diameter, indicating that measures should be considered to mitigate transmission across both short and long distances.",

Infectious particles sized less than 10 \u03bcm tend to have more serious health implications as they are able to penetrate into the lower respiratory tract to establish infection, and in the case of enteric viruses they may deposit in the upper respiratory tract (i.e. tonsils) or the enteric tract by inhalation.",

In this case, we speculate that both, the quantity of PEDV shed per gram of feces in acutely infected pigs, as well as the volume of liquid found in the diarrheic material may explain the higher quantities of RNA copies of PEDV compared to IAV or PRRSV. Furthermore, comprehensive personal protective equipment including respiratory protection should be considered for potential exposures to both respiratory and enteric viruses, in particular in settings where animals and people interact. In addition, other biosecurity measurements such as air filtration could be considered to protect nearby at risk populations as previously demonstrated [39].",
