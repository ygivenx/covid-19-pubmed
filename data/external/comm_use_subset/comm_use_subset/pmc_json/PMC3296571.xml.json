The goal was to simplify communication and establish lines to authority and command [7,8], also, to provide more effective onsite utilization and management of resources [9]. The Incident Command System typically consists of five system functions as follows: Command, Planning, Operations, Logistics, and Financial/Administration [5,6].",
