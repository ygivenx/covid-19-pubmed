            "text": "Much of our understanding of how HRV replicates and induces host antiviral responses, is based on studies using non-airway cell lines (e.g. HeLa cells), or is inferred from studies of other picornaviruses. HRV replication requires virus entry into cells and genome release [11]. The viral polyprotein is then translated from the positive sense RNA genome and the viral RNA polymerase subsequently generates negative strand copies of the HRV genome. These negative strands serve as templates for replication of positive strand genomes for packaging in the virus capsid [12]. Thus, during RV replication, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is generated which, according to dogma, not only regulates levels of viral replication but also is recognized by pattern recognition receptors that mediate the induction of proinflammatory and antiviral responses [13]. Viral release from infected cells then occurs via cell lysis [12]. Although it is generally held that innate immunity plays a key role in regulating the outcome to HRV infections, it is thought that immune cells also play an important role in viral clearance [14].",

We exposed highly differentiated cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells (HBE) to varying initial infectious doses of HRV and monitored responses for 144 h. We show that, contrary to existing dogma, HBE clear HRV infections without the need for immune cells. In addition, we observed that levels of dRNA, assessed by quantification of negative strand template RNA, correlate temporally and quantitatively with maximal intracellular viral genome loads. In marked contrast, maximal levels of type I and type III interferon (IFN)s, as well as of some other host defense molecules, are not related to peak negative strand template levels but, rather, vary depending on the initial infectious dose of HRV used.",

Negative strand template was detectable by 8 h after infection and increased to peak levels at 24 h (Fig. 7), Interestingly, increased expression of IFN-\u03bb1 mRNA was not observed until 24 h, when it was already comparable to the maximal level observed in Fig. 6.",

At the highest initial infectious dose (104 TCID50 of HRV-16), peak expression of both viperin and ISG15 was slightly delayed relative to those of IFNs and CXCL10. Moreover, the dependence on infectious dose was less clear, as comparable viperin expression was observed at all initial infectious doses (except 104 TCID50 of HRV-16), and the reduction of ISG15 expression at lower doses was less marked. Generation of all of the host defense molecules examined depend upon viral replication, since exposure of HBE to 104 TCID50 of HRV-16 that was rendered replication deficient by exposure to UV light did not induce epithelial expression of any of the molecules studied (not shown).",

The physiological relevance of such studies of HRV replication must be questioned, however, since HRV selectively infects the airways. HRV infection studies in vivo demonstrate that epithelial cells are the natural site of HRV infection and replication [5, 6, 21], and the use of human airway epithelial cell lines [22], and subsequently primary HBE grown in submersion culture [23, 24], or at ALI [25, 26], have provided important insights into the inflammatory and innate immune responses to HRV infection. HBE in submersion culture are not suited, however, for studying the complete HRV replication cycle, as confluent cultures cannot be maintained for extended periods. Initially, ALI cultures of HBE used cells grown in \u201cbronchial epithelial differentiation medium\u201d for 3 weeks yielded cultures that were multi-layered and expressed some cilia but did not reproduce the in vivo pseudostratified columnar morphology [25, 26]. By contrast, 5-week ALI cultures grown in PneumaCult medium recapitulate in vivo morphology. Moreover, these cultures can be maintained for months at ALI, permitting the current studies examining the HRV replication cycle in response to varying initial infectious doses of HRV. Although well differentiated cultures of human airway epithelial cells have been used to study kinetic responses to infection with respiratory syncytial virus [27, 28], to our knowledge this is the first use of such cells for extended kinetic studies of responses to HRV infection.",

Whether the peak levels of intracellular (and shed) virus observed with all infectious doses represent the maximal viral replication that can be supported by the cells is unclear. Given that the initial infectious material removed from the cells contains levels of HRV that are not distinguishable from the dose applied (not shown), it would appear that few virions are taken up by cells. Thus, it is unclear why a delay in replication is observed with lower doses. One could speculate that fewer cells are initially infected with lower doses and that it takes longer for all cells that can support replication to be infected. Regardless, a major observation from the current studies is that highly differentiated HBE can clear HRV-16 infection by 144 h after infection, regardless of the initial infectious dose used. This is reflected both by intracellular and shed virus levels. It should be noted that the general time course of shed virus in these cultures resembles that observed in nasal secretions following experimental HRV-16 infection of normal volunteers [17]. Overall, these data indicate that epithelial antiviral responses on their own are adequate to clear HRV-16 infections and that, while recruitment of inflammatory and immune cells to the airway mucosa in vivo may contribute to symptoms, these cells are not essential for virus clearance.",

            "text": "To our knowledge there has been no prior quantitative assessment of the level of dsRNA achieved in airway epithelial cells infected with HRV. We examined absolute copy numbers of negative strand as a means to quantify dsRNA. Prior studies of single strand genome viruses have shown that conventional RT-PCR targeting the negative strand does not provide strand-specificity. The phenomenon of \u201cfalse priming\u201d yields signals even in the absence of primer during reverse transcription [34, 35], and studies using single strands generated by in vitro transcription from plasmids have shown that RT-PCR for negative strand is not specific in the presence of excess positive strand [36]. We therefore modified a previously published strategy [36], in which the primer for reverse transcription contains a non-viral sequence at the 5\u2032 end of the specific sequence targeting the negative strand of HRV-16. This non-viral sequence is then used as a primer to selectively amplify the negative strand specific cDNA at the PCR stage. This technique showed that similar levels of negative strand (and, thus, presumably, dsRNA) were achieved regardless of the initial infectious dose, albeit with varying time-courses. This implies that a defined level of negative strand is required for optimal replication of genomic RNA. If the concept put forward for poliovirus that genomes that have not been translated cannot function as templates for negative strand synthesis [37, 38] also holds true for HRV, this would suggest that a defined level of virus polyprotein strands are translated after infection in order to support optimal viral replication. Given that copy numbers of negative strand were about 10,000-fold lower than those of positive strand, transcription of positive strand from template must be highly efficient. Our data differ from a previous report of a ratio of only about 70 positive strands per negative strand in cells infected with poliovirus, assessed using an RNase protection assay [39]. This difference may be due to specificity of the natural cell host (the cell type used in the prior poliovirus study was never defined), differences between viruses, or the sensitivity and specificity of the methods used.",

            "text": "The dsRNA generated during viral replication is recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to induce innate immune responses. Studies have reported varying roles of the dsRNA receptors, toll-like receptor-3, retinoic acid inducible gene-I and melanoma differentiation associated gene-5 in inducing epithelial responses to HRV infection [19, 40, 41]. Type I and type III IFNs are both produced by epithelial cells in response to viral infections but recent studies have indicated that type III IFNs, particularly IFN-\u03bb1, are the dominant IFNs produced by human airway epithelial cells in response to HRV infection [10, 42]. We confirmed this observation in highly differentiated epithelial cells, showing that induction of mRNA and protein for IFN-\u03bb1 are considerably higher than levels observed for IFN-\u03b2. Interestingly, however, despite the relatively constant level of negative strand template generated with each initial infectious dose of HRV-16, levels of mRNA and protein for type I and type III IFNs decreased markedly as the initial infectious dose of HRV decreased. Interestingly, levels of IFNs produced had no bearing on the time to HRV clearance, implying that neither of these types of IFNs control viral clearance. No IFNs were generated in cells exposed to HRV rendered replication deficient by exposure to UV light (not shown). Since HRV treated in this way can still engage its receptor, this implies that induction of IFNs requires viral replication and not just engagement of ICAM-1, the receptor for HRV-16. For each infectious dose of HRV-16, the kinetics, but not the quantity, of IFN induction mirrored that of negative strand template. Thus, the degree of induction of IFNs is not simply regulated by levels of dsRNA, as reflected by levels of negative strand. This implies that other factors generated during the replication cycle must play a role. The identity of these factors is unknown but single-stranded RNA, other replications intermediates, or other components of the viral genome, may contribute. Induction of CXCL10 mRNA and protein closely mirrored the induction of IFNs, both in terms of kinetics and quantity. Since we have previously reported that induction of CXCL10 by HRV-16 is not mediated via IFN signaling [17], it may be that induction of both CXCL10 and IFNs occur via shared pathways. It is of interest that there was a different vectoriality of release for IFNs (mainly apical) and CXCL10 (mainly basolateral). We have also observed this for other epithelial mediators (not shown). At this point the reasons for these differences are unknown.",

The persistence of mRNA expression for these two genes at lower infectious doses, despite the profound decline in IFN levels, suggest that their induction is not mediated by type I or type III IFNs. Although both viperin and ISG15 are usually referred to as members of the group of \u201cIFN-stimulated genes\u201d (ISGs), there is precedent that ISGs can be induced independently of IFNs. Such IFN-independent induction occurs via direct viral induction of key transcription factors, particularly members of the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family. Thus, cells deficient in both type I and type III IFN receptors still showed induction of multiple ISGs in response to influenza infection [43]. Similarly, it has previously been show that viperin can be induced independently of IFN signaling via an IRF-1 mediated mechanism [44]. Consistent with this, we have previously shown robust induction of IRF-1 and IRF-7 in HRV-infected human airway epithelial cells [45, 46], and have demonstrated that induction of ISG15 by HRV is dependent upon transcriptional control by IRF-1 [19].",

Histological integrity was not different compared to cells exposed to medium for 144 h, or to epithelium prior to infection (Fig. 1a). We cannot rule out that death or shedding of a small percentage of cells occurs during infection, but if so, the epithelium either generates replacement cells or else adjacent cells expand to maintain an intact epithelium. In terms of alternative means for HRV to escape epithelial cells, there is precedent for HRV and other enterovirus species to leave other cell types via phosphatidylserine rich membrane vesicles with properties of either exosomes or autophagosomal like vesicles [48\u201350].
