AS and CB infected mice showed comparable iRBC loads (parasitemia multiplied by total RBC numbers), despite the fact that higher peak parasitemias were observed in the acute CB infection (Fig. 1b,c). A more severe RBC loss with a significantly lower hemoglobin concentration was observed in CB infection at 10 days post infection (dpi) compared to that in AS infected mice, agreeing with previous observations, which showed more severe anemia in CB infected BALB/c mice4. Moreover, the RBC loss in CB infected mice is longer lasting, even after the peak of infection at 12 dpi (Fig. 1d,e). In addition, at 10 dpi, CB infected mice showed greater temperature and weight loss (Fig. 1f,g).",

At any of the post-infection time points examined, there were 6226 differentially expressed transcripts with a greater than 2-fold change in the infected mice compared to the na\u00efve mice (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Fig. 1a). Consistent with correlation analyses of unfiltered transcripts (Fig. 2a), only a few transcripts were differentially expressed at 2 and 4 dpi (Fig. 2b). Strikingly, at 6 dpi, a large majority of transcripts were down-regulated compared to na\u00efve controls in both AS and CB infections. However, the number was greater in CB infected mice compared to AS (AS 1856 out of 2265 transcripts, CB 4306 out of 4471 transcripts) (Fig. 2b). The number of down-regulated transcripts increased steadily from 6 to 12 dpi in AS infection (Fig. 2b). While down-regulation of transcripts was also observed at 6\u20138 dpi in the CB infection, the level of down-regulation was significantly lower at 10 dpi and there was a sudden up-regulation of transcripts occurred only in CB infected mice at this time point (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Fig. 1a), a critical time point when infected animals were either recovering from acute infection or suffering from severe pathologies leading to death (Fig. 1), indicating that these up-regulated transcripts may relate to the manifestation of severe pathology in the CB infection. Indeed this higher level of transcriptional up-regulation was further confirmed in 4 CB infected mice that had reached humane end points at 9 dpi (Supplementary Fig. 1b). This up- or down-regulation of gene expression in whole blood are due to both the leukocyte population changes and transcript regulation during the infection (Supplementary Fig. 1c).",

A self-organising map (SOM) clustering method was used to generate clusters of co-expressing transcripts (Supplementary Fig. 3, Supplementary Table 3)6.

Several clusters, C8, C10, C13, C15, C16 and C20 showed greater up-regulation in CB infection during 9\u201310 dpi, indicating their association with lethality/severe pathology in CB infection (Fig. 3d, indicated in red).",

            "text": "Two clusters, C16 and C17 contained 21 genes related to anemia (Fig. 5a). For most of these genes, their down-regulation is associated with anemia, and up-regulation is associated with alleviation of anemia (Supplementary Fig. 4). The anemia signature was already present at 6 dpi in both infections (Fig. 5a), prior to clinical observation of RBC and hemoglobin loss at 8 dpi (Fig. 1). The mean normalised intensity of these 21 genes was significantly down-regulated compared to na\u00efve controls, and CB infected mice had even significantly lower values (Fig. 5b). The peak activation Z scores calculated by IPA for this anemia signature of CB infection was 1.6-fold higher compared with that of AS (Fig. 5c, 3.6 vs 2.2, 6 dpi), agreeing with the more severe RBC loss (area under the curve analysis) in CB than AS infection (1.5-fold, 36.0 vs 23.5) (Fig. 1d). Interestingly, at 8 dpi, 13 out of the 21 genes within this signature were already up-regulated in AS infections compared to na\u00efve controls; by contrast, the majority (15) of these genes were still down-regulated in the blood of CB infected mice (Fig. 5a, Supplementary Fig. 4). The activation Z score was \u22122.0 in AS infected mice indicating anemia alleviation at this time point, compared to that of 2.0 in CB infected mice (Fig. 5c), which indicates a longer-lasting anemia. This is consistent with the more severe RBC and hemoglobin loss in CB infection at 10 dpi compared to AS (Fig. 1d,e). Moreover, in support of this data, IPA Canonical Pathway Analysis of heme biosynthesis II pathway also showed that genes in this pathway were more down-regulated or less up-regulated in CB than in AS infected mice at 8 dpi compared to na\u00efve controls (Fig. 5d). Together, these data suggest a deregulated or stressed erythropoietic response in CB infected mice, leading to a stronger and prolonged severe anemia (Fig. 1d,e).",

The hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained sections of perfused lungs from both AS and CB infected mice showed signs of leukocyte infiltration. In the lungs of some CB infected mice, patches of dense leukocyte accumulation between epithelial walls were observed in close proximity to hemozoin (Hz) crystals (Supplementary Fig. 5b).

One of the top up-regulated genes, S100A9 (MRP14, myeloid-related protein 14), indicates that neutrophils may be involved in the lung pathology of the CB infection. We therefore investigated whether the up-regulation of MRP14 transcript in the blood is associated with higher protein level and neutrophil infiltration in the lungs. We analysed the concentration of MRP14 protein in the serum at 9 dpi. While high level of MRP14 protein was also detected in sera of all (12) CB infected mice, it was below detection limit by ELISA in the sera from 5 out of 12 AS infected mice and all (12) from na\u00efve mice (Fig. 6f). We next measured the amount of MRP14 in the whole lung lysates, and found that CB infected mice contained more than twice the amount of MRP14 protein compared to that of lungs of AS infected mice at 9 dpi; moreover, this upregulation was observed as early as 6 dpi (Fig. 6g). IFNg, IL6, KC (CXCL1) and LIX (CXCL5) were higher in the lungs of CB infected mice, indicating a heightened proinflammatory response in the CB infection (Supplementary Fig. 7a). Immunohistochemical staining of MRP14 on lung sections showed more MRP14+ cells present in the lungs of CB infected mice compared to na\u00efve and AS infected mice (Supplementary Fig. 7b), and flow cytometry analysis confirmed a greater than two fold increase of MRP14hiLy6G+ neutrophils in CB compared to AS infected mice (Fig. 6h).",

To investigate the level of sequestration of iRBCs in P. c. chabaudi AS and CB infected mice, we generated transgenic parasites, PccASluc230p and PccCBluc230p, expressing luciferase constitutively throughout the Plasmodium life cycle under the control of eef1a promoter (Supplementary Fig. 8). At day 4, 6 and 9 dpi, the total parasite load was determined by measuring luciferase activity from 2 \u03bcL tail blood when the parasites were at late trophozoite stage8, and the level of sequestration in different organs was investigated during schizogony. Consistent with the peripheral load of iRBC (Fig. 1b), there were no significant differences in luciferase activity between PccASluc230p and PccCBluc230p infected mice at 6 dpi either in peripheral blood or by whole body imaging (Fig. 7b). After intensive systemic perfusion, the luciferase activities in isolated organs were measured and relative ratio of sequestration was calculated as the level of luciferase activity per organ (total flux per second) relative to the total parasite load measured in peripheral blood before schizogony (relative light unit, RLU) (Fig. 7c). Consistent with previous findings8, both AS and CB iRBC, sequester/accumulate mainly in the spleen, liver and lungs, with no significant signals observed in the kidney or brain. The relative levels of sequestration/accumulation in the spleen and liver were similar between AS and CB infections. By contrast, a significantly higher level of sequestration in the lungs occurred in the CB infection at 6 dpi, and the trend was still maintained at 9 dpi (Fig. 7c). The higher level of sequestration/accumulation of schizonts in the lungs is consistent with the observation of greater amounts of Hz in the lungs of CB infected mice compared to AS infected mice (Fig. 7a).",

However, there is an increasing amount of evidence showing that genetic diversity of the parasite also contributes to the varying severity of malarial disease. In this study we used a top-down systems analysis of peripheral blood to investigate whether transcriptomic signatures could be identified that would indicate or predict severity of acute blood-stage malaria caused by 2 strains of P. c. chabaudi of differing virulence. Using high-resolution profiling of the whole blood transcriptomics over multiple time points during the acute phase of infection, and data-driven modular analysis, we investigated the involvement of biological processes rather than specific genes, and uncovered several transcriptomic signatures related to severe pathologies in the virulent CB infection. These include distinct signatures for platelet aggregation, anemia and lung inflammation, which can be seen at different time points and distinguished the two infections. This analysis also revealed several signatures common between avirulent AS and virulent CB infections, but they occurred at different time points or were of different magnitude. This highlights the value of studying pathological factors in the host induced by parasites over the course of the infection and not at a single time point.",

This set of genes was up-regulated as early as 2 days post infection in all CB infected mice regardless of eventual survival. It has been shown that in severe P. falciparum infections, platelets mediate iRBC clumping and adhesion1112. These observations of association between infection severity and platelets aggregation suggest that similar mechanisms underlie pathology in both the P. c. chabaudi model of malaria and in human infections, and the experimental model may be useful to explore the underlying mechanisms. It would be of great interest to analyse the platelet aggregation signature in human malarial infections and investigate whether this transcriptomic signature could be used as an early marker to predict development of severe pathology.",

Although sequestration of P. c. chabaudi AS parasites in lungs has been documented8, lung damage has not been previously reported for this experimental model. We confirmed that this SARS-related lung inflammation signature in the blood was indeed associated with a more severe pulmonary neutrophilic infiltration and more cell death in the lungs in CB infections. Furthermore, it was linked to a higher level of sequestration of CB iRBC in this organ. Both P. falciparum and P. vivax can sequester within the pulmonary microvasculature and cause lethal malaria-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (MA-ARDS)13. Members of the PfEMP1 family (P. falciparum Erythocyte Membrane Protein-1) of variant surface-expressed parasite proteins have been shown as parasite ligands mediating parasite cytoadherence14. Although PfEMP1 is lacking in other Plasmodium parasites, another multigene family PIR (Plasmodium interspersed repeat) is present in most, if not all, species of Plasmodium; and there is evidence that some PIRs in P. vivax bind to ICAM-1 endothelial receptor in vitro15. It is possible that differential PIRs expression between P. c. chabaudi AS and CB is responsible for this differential pulmonary sequestration ability. However, it is also possible that AS parasite is removed more effectively from the lung than CB due to the higher inflammation caused by CB infection.",

There is evidence that Hz can directly induce pulmonary proinflammatory responses16. In addition it has been shown that parasite-derived microparticles can induce macrophage activation in a TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4)-MyD88 dependent manner17. In our study, CB infection induced higher level of inflammation (IFNg, IL-6 and MRP14) in the lungs of infected mice. MRP14 (S100A9) is one of the top up-regulated genes identified in the lung inflammation signagure. Together with S100A8 (MRP8), MRP8/14 forms a heterodimer complex that has previously been shown to be a potent chemotactic factor for myeloid cells, especially neutrophils18. MRP8/14 are TLR4 ligands and are recognized as damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMP) involved in many inflammatory diseases and infections19. For example, in tuberculosis and influenza infection, MRP8/14 is shown to exacerbate pro-inflammatory responses, cell-death and pathogenesis2021. Of relevance here, MRP14 protein is significantly increased in P. falciparum and P. vivax infected patients2223. Interestingly, in our P. c. chabaudi mouse model, MRP14 was detectable in all mice infected with the virulent CB strain; by contrast, it was detectable in only 40% of mice infected with the avirulent AS strain. Moreover, when MRP14 was detected in AS infected mice, it was present at significantly lower level than that in CB infected mice. This coincided with a significantly higher number of MRP14hiLy6G+ neutrophils in the lungs of CB infected mice. It is possible that MRP14+ cells respond to the microparticles upon rupture of sequestered CB schizonts, leading to proinflammatory response and recruiting more MRP14+ neutrophils. Our analysis offers evidence that different parasite strains, exhibiting different sequestration tendencies, can lead to different levels of lung inflammation and damage.",
