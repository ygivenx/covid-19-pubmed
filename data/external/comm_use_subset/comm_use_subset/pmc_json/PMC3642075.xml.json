            "text": "There are many circumstances in infectious disease epidemiology where transmission among hosts occurs, but is too weak to support endemic or epidemic spread. In these instances, disease is introduced from an external source and subsequent secondary transmission is characterized by \u2018stuttering chains\u2019 of transmission which inevitably go extinct. This regime can be defined formally in terms of the basic reproductive number, , which describes the expected number of secondary cases caused by a typical infected individual. Stuttering chains occur when  in the focal population is non-zero but less than the threshold value of one that enables sustained spread (i.e. ). Transmission is therefore subcritical, and epidemics cannot occur. However there are many settings where such transmission dynamics are important. A major set of examples comes from stage III zoonoses, such as monkeypox virus, Nipah virus, and H5N1 avian influenza and H7N7 influenza [1]\u2013[6]. Because most human diseases originate as zoonoses, there is significant public health motivation to monitor stage III zoonoses [7]\u2013[10]. Subcritical transmission is also associated with the emergence of drug-resistant bacterial infections in some healthcare settings, such as hospital-acquired MRSA [11]. In addition, stuttering chains characterize the dynamics of infectious diseases that are on the brink of eradication, such as smallpox in the 1960s and 1970s [12] and polio now [13], [14]. Furthermore, stuttering chains are seen with measles and other vaccine preventable diseases when they are re-introduced to a region after local elimination [15]\u2013[17].",

            "text": "A top priority in all of these settings is to quantify transmission, in order to determine the risk that the pathogen could emerge and become established in the human population of concern. This could occur due to demographic or biological changes that increase transmission, such as declining vaccine coverage [15] or pathogen adaptation [18]\u2013[20]. Yet a recent review of transmission models for zoonotic infection identified a marked shortage of models that address the dynamics of zoonoses exhibiting stuttering chain transmission [4]. One major cause of this gap is that high-resolution data describing individual-level disease transmission are rare. The introduction events that trigger the stuttering chains are sporadic, and the transient nature of stuttering chains makes them difficult to track closely. Furthermore, contact tracing is logistically challenging because it requires rapid response surveillance teams and techniques for differentiating specific routes of disease transmission. In contrast, the total size of a transmission chain (i.e. the total number of cases infected) is much easier to obtain, since it does not require detailed contact tracing and can be assessed retrospectively based on case histories or serology. Accordingly, the most common data sets for stuttering pathogens are chain size distributions, which describe the number of cases arising from each of many separate introductions. Such data can be used to make estimates of  (or the \u2018effective reproductive number\u2019 in the presence of vaccination; for simplicity we will use the term  for all settings) [2], [15], [21]\u2013[23]. This strategy has been applied successfully, particularly in the context of vaccine-preventable diseases, but one important simplification is that these analyses typically have not allowed for an unknown degree of heterogeneity in disease transmission among individual cases. This is an important omission, because individual variation in infectiousness is substantial for many infections [24] and can cause significant skews in the chain size distribution [25]. Thus it may be expected to affect conclusions about chain size distributions. For example, failure to account for superspreading events caused by highly infectious individuals can trigger false alarms in systems designed to detect anomalously large chains [2], [19].",

Building upon prior studies we assume that the offspring distribution, which describes the number of secondary infections caused by each infected individual, can be represented by a negative binomial distribution. This has been shown to be an effective model for the transmission dynamics of emerging pathogens [24], and it encompasses earlier models (based on geometric or Poisson offspring distributions) as special cases. The negative binomial model has two parameters: the mean number of secondary infections, , and the dispersion parameter, , which varies inversely with the heterogeneity in infectiousness.",

Monkeypox is an important case study for these methods, because recent reports indicate that its incidence has increased 20-fold since the eradication of smallpox in the late 1970s [28], raising the urgent question of whether the virus has become more transmissible among humans. Meanwhile, challenging logistics make the collection of follow-up data difficult and resource-intensive. Fortunately, surveillance data from the 1980s data set is unique in its detail and it allows us to demonstrate how chain size data yields results that are consistent with harder-to-obtain contact tracing data. This suggests that future monitoring of  can be achieved by monitoring chain size data by itself. We demonstrate that accurate knowledge of the dispersion parameter is important for reliably determining when an apparent change in transmissibility is statistically significant. In addition, our focus on chain size distributions permits us to determine quantitative thresholds for chain sizes that can be used during surveillance to decide if a particular transmission chain is unusually large and likely to indicate an abrupt increase in . Such indications can facilitate targeted, cost-effective implementation of control measures. Lastly, we consider the real-world difficulties that can arise in obtaining transmission chain data, including the possibility that cases remain unobserved and the complications of overlapping transmission chains.

Because the collection of high-resolution epidemiological data is resource and labor intensive, there is great benefit to understanding the type and quantity of data needed for a specific type of assessment. For instance, total incidence data on its own is not sufficient to infer human-to-human transmissibility for subcritical infections, because the contribution of spillover cases is unspecified. However, chain size and contact tracing data can be used to infer . In fact, for our negative binomial model of disease transmission, the ML estimate of  is identical when the likelihood is based on either chain size data only, chain size data coupled with knowledge of the transmission generation when the chain went extinct, or complete contact tracing data (see methods). This shows that for the purpose of estimating , chain size data can be equivalent to contact tracing data.

Specific scenarios that can give rise to such correlations include the existence of clustered pockets of susceptible individuals, impacts of coinfection or immunosuppressive conditions, or transmission heterogeneity that arises chiefly from variation in contact rates rather than variation in the amount of virus shed [36]\u2013[38]. This issue is especially relevant for preventable diseases such as measles, because large outbreaks in developed countries are often associated with particular communities in which vaccine refusal is common [16], [39]. Local depletion of susceptible individuals, which can even occur within a household, can also impact the estimation of  and .

            "text": "The raw cluster data for monkeypox was obtained from table 1 of [26]. Our baseline inference of transmission parameters is based on considering all the possible ways this cluster data can be separated into individual transmission chains. To explore the specific impact of entangled transmission chains on the inference of transmission parameters, we also investigated the impact of three approaches of using the cluster size data to assign an explicit chain size distribution (table 4). In the \u2018simple cluster analysis\u2019 approach, we treat all clusters as though they were a complete stuttering chain and ignore the complications of multiple primary infections. The other two approaches use different algorithms to divide the clusters that have multiple primary infections into constituent chains. In our \u2018homogeneous assignment\u2019 distribution, clusters were divided as evenly as possible. For example, a cluster of total size four with two co-primary cases is tabulated as two chains of size two. Meanwhile, our \u2018heterogeneous assignment\u2019 distribution maximized the number of isolated case counts when disentangling clusters. For this distribution, a cluster of size four with two co-primaries is tabulated as a chain of size one and a chain of size three.",
