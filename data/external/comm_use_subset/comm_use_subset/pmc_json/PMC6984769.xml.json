            "text": "RNA-Protein Interactions (RPIs) play significant roles in various post-transcriptional regulation processes, such as RNA splicing, RNA transport, RNA replication, and mRNA translation [1\u20139]. A variety of functional RNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), usually work biologically through RNA-Protein Complexes (RPC) formed by the interactions between RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and these RNA macromolecules. Invalid interactions or mispairing could lead to human disease [10,11] or pathogen resistance in plants [12,13]. Therefore, determining whether a given RNA and a given RNA binding protein can form interactions or not is an essential prerequisite for dissection of RNA functions and regulatory mechanisms.",

Nowadays, there are 1973 RPI complexes available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB, as of March 2017), which contains over 15,000 protein chains and more than 3,000 RNA chains. However, according to research using high-throughput sequencing techniques (such as RNA-Seq), at least 30,000 lncRNAs were identified by 2013 [16]. This number will increase rapidly every year, and specifically, studies have identified over 60,000 eRNAs in 2015 [17,18]. Obviously, the majority of those are not partnered with their target proteins (if they have partners), which calls for in silico prediction of RPIs.",

In the same year, Bellucci et al. [20] developed a tool, called catRAPID, to give rapid predictions of RPIs by training on 592 RNA-protein pairs from the PDB. They used the physicochemical properties of sequences as features and found three most predictive features: secondary structure propensities, hydrogen bonding, and van der Waals [20]. Thereafter, Muppirala et al. [21] employed an idea from the Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) prediction area, called Conjoint Triad Feature (CTF), to formulate protein sequences and then used normalized 4-gram frequencies to encode RNA sequences. They also constructed two benchmark datasets, called RPI369 and RPI2241, from PRIDB (a database of protein-RNA interfaces) [22] and achieved remarkable prediction accuracies by using CTF and 4-gram features on these two datasets. Two years later, Wang et al. [23] proposed a novel extended naive-Bayes-classifier to predict RPIs using the similar features of Muppirala et al. [21] Similar to catRAPID, Lu et al. [24] used the secondary structure, hydrogen-bonding, and the Van der Waals\u2019 propensities as features and then employed matrix multiplication to give a score for each protein-lncRNA pairs obtained from the PDB database.",

CTF is a fundamental group of features to recognize the interaction of RNA and proteins and was shown to be successful in the majority of published prediction tools [21,23,25,28]. Furthermore, CGR is an important group of features for protein studies and achieved remarkable results in many prediction tools [29\u201333]. Detailed comparisons with existing tools using RPI369 and RPI2241 demonstrated that the combinations of these two features indeed got achieved improvements, suggesting that our prediction model will be an important tool for RPI prediction.",

The first task was to transform the raw protein and RNA sequences into appropriate numerical vectors, which can represent intrinsic properties of their interactions. Here, we studied five different groups of representations of protein and RNA sequences and tried to determine which representation was optimal for predicting RPIs. After that, another important task was to choose a powerful machine-learning algorithm or a classifier to discriminate true RPIs and non-RPIs based on the above representations. We employed random forest as our classifier, which had been proven as a successful tool for predicting RPIs [21,24,28].

Note that for CTF, the feature set contains 343 features of CTFprotein and 256 features of CTFRNA (for details of these 256 features, please see the subsection \u2018Features of RNAs for prediction-Conjoint triad feature\u2019), which leads to 599 features (i.e., 343 + 256) in the total CTF feature set. Similarly, for CGR, the feature set contains 24 features of CGRprotein and 16 features of CGRRNA (for details of these 16 features, please see the subsection \u2018Features of RNAs for prediction- Chaos game representation\u2019), which counts 40 features (i.e., 24 + 16) of CGR feature set.

For example, the value for mtry (the number of input variables randomly chosen at each split) is 476 for CTF, 15 for CGR, and 442 for the combination. Recall that the total dimensions of CTF, CGR and the combination are 599, 40 and 639, respectively; the value of 476 of mtry in the model CTF implies that 476 important features among the total 599 features are selected as the optimal feature set to reach the best prediction result. RF selects 476 optimal features among all the 599 features, which means the unselected features are substitutable and the reasons might be the high correlations between the selected features. Interestingly, the value of mtry falls to 442 and does not equal 491 (476 + 15) when we combine CTF and CGR (the total number of features reaches to 639). Note that the values of mtry of CTF and CGR are 476 and 15 respectively, which means RF selects 476 significant features from CTF and selects 15 ones from CGR. Intuitively, one expect the value of mtry of the combination will be 491 (476 + 15), but the exact value of mtry is 442 that is much smaller. The reason might be the correlations between 476 selected features of CTF and 15 selected features of CGR, which makes RF select representative 442 features of the combination.Together with the best ACC of 0.7995 among all the feature sets, this result implies that CTF and CGR are truly complementary feature sets and that the combination further compresses the redundant information to reach the best prediction result.",

Table 3 shows that our method achieved the second rank when testing on RPI369, and encouragingly, our method ranked first when testing on RPI2241. As RPI369 only contained 369 RNA-protein interaction pairs, the models developed on this small sample size will not guarantee generalization capability. In contrast, models developed on RPI2241 used more training samples and will be more reliable for prediction on blind samples (the samples with no experiment information).

To avoid overlaps between RPI369 and RPI2241, we chose only a subset of those complexes that were reported from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2016. This way, 849 complexes were selected and advanced to the next step. To achieve statistical significance, we removed pairs of protein and RNA chains that were simultaneously shorter than 25 amino acids and 10 bases, respectively. To correctly select RNA-protein pairs that have real interactions, we employed the same strategy as Suresh et al [25]. to confirm that a given protein chain and RNA chain had physical interactions by identifying at least two atoms, one from protein and another from RNA, with an intermolecular distance less than 3.4 \u212b.

We compared our prediction result with the method of Muppirala et al [21]. on the independent test using the measurement of accuracy. The comparison results are shown in Table 4, which indicate that 1092 out of 1449 RNA-protein pairs were correctly predicted in the independent test, leading to a predicting accuracy of 0.7536.

There are two advantages of RF: 1) easy training that requires researchers to tune only two internal parameters, \u2018ntree and mtry\u2019 during the training approach, and 2) powerful prediction ability on various datasets when comparing other machine-learning or statistical methods. These properties have helped make RF become one of the most successful machine-learning tools in the last two decades. Actually, it is an ensemble machine learning method whose prediction result is voted by a certain number of decision trees. Each tree is independently constructed with a bootstrap sample of the training set. Additionally, comprehensive theory and wide applications of RF can be found in a famous paper written by Breiman [37]. Here, we adopt a MATLAB toolbox of RF, which is available at http://code.google.com/p/randomforest-matlab/, to train and test our model. We chose the optimal combination of the two parameters of \u2018ntree\u2019 in [300,500] and mtry in [1,n] (n is the number of the total features in that dataset) and adopted the grid optimization to find the globe optimal solution.",

Compared with four existing tools [21,23,25,28], the prediction model constructed from the combinatorial features of CTF + CGR showed some improvements, especially on RPI2241. Furthermore, a new independent testing dataset, RPI1449, was built using new experimentally validated RNA-protein interactions, and a blind independent test was performed. The corresponding prediction accuracy of 0.7536 demonstrated that our method has some generalization capability. In conclusion, the combinational representation of CTF + CGR appears to be a powerful method for RPI prediction, and our model based on CTF + CGR and random forest may prove to be an important tool for prediction of RPIs.",
