However, typical model forms focus largely on the epidemiological characteristics of the disease at the time of emergence, and while such models may be used as a platform for projection of intervention effects, they seldom explicitly account for the behavioral, regulatory, and informational interventions that are either put into place by public health authorities, or occur spontaneously in a worried public, once knowledge of an epidemic is widespread [12]. Such limitations can be overcome post-hoc through model fitting and calibration, but insights from models would be most helpful early in outbreaks and epidemics, when such data is almost uniformly unavailable. Standard mathematical models that attempt to project outbreak duration and final size based on initial characteristics will predictably overestimate final outbreak size, since reproduction numbers decline not only due to depletion of susceptible individuals, but also to spontaneous and planned control activities and behaviours [1], [13], [14].",

The rate of growth of an epidemic is a function of both R0 and the average serial interval, which is defined as the time between symptoms developing in an index case and symptoms developing in a secondary case [11], [15]. We use a symptom-based interval so that the IDEA model is applicable in situations where microbiological or serological diagnosis is not available.

            "text": "The basic reproduction number thus describes initial exponential growth of an outbreak or epidemic. As this process continues, the effective reproduction number R is often defined as R0 x S/N, where S/N is the proportion of the population that remains susceptible to infection (defined as S  =  number of susceptibles divided by N  =  total population size), and the decline in R with time results in ultimate termination of the epidemic. However, many outbreaks rapidly dampen after a short period of time, in a manner that cannot be attributed to a decline in susceptibles [1], [13], [14], [16]. A potential mechanism driving decline in epidemics in the presence of susceptibles is spontaneous or planned reduction in the components of R0 itself (disease duration, contact rate, and infectiousness of cases) either because of public health interventions, or due to concern about disease among members of the public. As a decline in R for this reason is unlikely to be estimable in real time in the context of an outbreak, we propose that control be modeled empirically in a time-varying manner analogous to a financial discounting function. The impact of this discounting or dampening factor on case counts may be expressed empirically as:(2.0)where d is a discount factor. The model may be fitted to available outbreak data when case counts are aggregated to reflect likely generation times, and can be readily calculated using information on latent and infectious periods, which are available for many pathogens of public health importance [17], or estimated empirically for novel pathogens [1], [18].",

However, Wu and Huberman have previously described an approach similar to that outlined above to describe the growth and decay of interest in news items on the Internet, with exponential growth countered by a \u201cdiscount factor\u201d that damps the \u201creproductive number\u201d for page sharing as a function of time [31]. We found that best-fit projections for the IDEA model for disease dynamic systems with low or intermediate R0 were exceedingly good, with parameters derived within 3\u20134 generations able to project the full extent of simulated epidemics with remarkable accuracy. If validated, the implications of such a finding may be profound (e.g., the ability to project, with a high degree of accuracy, the final size and duration of a seasonal influenza outbreak within 2 weeks of onset).",

Nonetheless, the application of this technique to high R0 epidemics may be useful for a variety of reasons: first, early (pre-epidemic peak) IDEA estimates of R0 closely matched true R0 values in simulations, suggesting that the use of this technique for early R0 estimation when novel diseases emerge may be reasonable regardless of whether R0 is low or high. Furthermore, the \u0394d metric, and the abrupt shift in R0 estimates that occurs with the epidemic peak would provide a helpful signal to epidemiologists that the epidemic is peaking or changing. Finally, as parameter estimates stabilize again for high R0 systems, the IDEA model remains a useful tool for projecting the total size and duration of an outbreak. It is also possible that challenges in fitting the IDEA model to simulated data represent not a limitation of the IDEA model, but are rather an artefact of our use of SIR difference equation models, which tend to peak and collapse suddenly with at high R0.",

The model's main asset is its simplicity and the fact that it does not require consideration of population immune status for parameterization. The model is constructed entirely on a case count time series that is likely to be available to public health professionals charged with outbreak control. IDEA requires no sophisticated knowledge of mathematics or computing, and can be realized using commonly available spreadsheet programs. The model's outputs, which include both cumulative case counts under best-fit conditions, and cumulative outbreak duration, would be valuable to front-line public health professionals seeking to budget material and human resources needed to see an outbreak through to its conclusion. This simplicity may make the model especially useful in resource-limited settings where rapid assessment of both outbreak behaviour, and change in outbreak behaviour is needed.",
