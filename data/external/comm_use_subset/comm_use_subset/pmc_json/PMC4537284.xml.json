            "text": "Influenza caused by highly-pathogenic avian H5N1 virus has been one of the most important zoonotic viral infections of humans during the last decade [1\u20133], with human fatality rates more than 50 percent in some areas of 15 affected countries [4], where outbreaks continue. Influenza viruses belong to the family Orthomyxoviridae, of which the H5N1 type has a broad range of hosts [1,5]. Although H5N1 naturally infects poultry and wild birds, transmission occurs to mammalian species, including humans [6\u20139]. H5N1-infected humans often develop severe clinical respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms and signs; in some cases, symptoms of the central nervous system (CNS) ensue [10\u201313]. Infection of the CNS by H5N1 may be severe, causing encephalopathy and other serious neurological complications and sequelae [14\u201316]. Recent reports found that mice experimentally infected with H5N1 virus developed encephalitic lesions during the acute phase, which was associated with a degree of neuronal degeneration and necrosis. Interestingly, CNS inflammation has not generally been observed in the chronic phase of infection, despite the detection of virus in such lesions [17]. Furthermore, Jang et al. (2009) reported protein aggregation mediated by the influenza virus within degenerated and necrotic neurons. These findings suggest the hypothesis that pathogenic influenza virus might induce a \u201chit and run mechanism\u201d, in which virus infection triggers a cytokine storm resulting in acute CNS inflammation, with consequent chronic Parkinson-like disease, encephalitis lethargica, or other neurodegenerative diseases. Nevertheless, the exact pathologic mechanism(s) of H5N1-induced encephalopathy remains unclear.",

This neurogenesis was shown to be de-regulated by infection with neurovirulent viruses causing Borna disease and Varicella-zoster [20,21]. Thus, it would be essential to determine whether infection by H5N1 virus occurs in neural progenitor cells, and if so, whether such infection plays a role in the pathogenesis of H5N1-induced encephalopathy. In order to shed light on these questions relevant to the pathogeneses of influenza virus-induced neuropathology, we infected human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) with H5N1 avian influenza virus and examined the resulting virus-cell interactions, the induction of cellular mediators, and the phenotypic characterizations of hNPCs following H5N1 virus infection in vitro.",

The hNPCs were infected with either H5N1, or ultraviolet (UV)-inactivated H5N1 virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. Inactivation of H5N1 virus by UV light was done at a distance of 25 cm for 1 hour as previously described [25], and its infectivity was verified by the presence of cytopathic effects (CPEs), and immunofluorescene for influenza A antigen, as described below. Virus propagation and infection were conducted in Biosafety Laboratory Level 3, at the Center for Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases of Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand. Briefly, after 1 hour of virus absorption at room temperature (RT), the inoculum was removed, the cultures were washed once with medium without fetal bovine serum (FBS), and replaced with the complete medium, as mentioned above. At 6, 24, 48 and 72 hpi, the cells and supernatants in 24 wells-microtiter plates were collected, respectively, for RNA isolation and viral growth kinetic study.

This is despite the fact that damaged neurons can be repaired by activation and differentiation of endogenous neural stem/progenitor cells residing in the SVZ of the lateral ventricles and the SGZ of the hippocampus [18,19]. These neural stem/progenitor cells can be classified in vitro or in vivo by stage-specific markers, such as NG2, Nestin, Pax6 and Sox1 [22,32]. The potential of these neural stem/progenitor cells to migrating to areas of damaged brain and differentiate into adult neurons has been hypothesized to be regulated by endogenous and exogenous factors within the environment of the lesions [32]. In patients with the above-mentioned neurodegenerative diseases, however, differentiation of these progenitor cells into mature neurons is usually limited, even though NG2-positive neural progenitor cells have been observed in or around the lesions [33\u201335]. The exact pathomechanisms underlying these neuronal losses and poor differentiation of neural progenitors remain unknown and subject to controversial discussion [31,36]. It has been postulated that inflammatory mediators secreted by other CNS tissues, such as microglia, astrocytes, and even the neural progenitor cells themselves may also play roles in this limited regeneration [37\u201339].",

            "text": "The present study demonstrated that hNPCs support H5N1 influenza virus replication in vitro. Although infections with the avian H5N1 virus of stem/progenitor cells from blood and bone marrow [40,41], or human neuronal and astrocytic cell lines [26], have been reported, the present study appears the first to describe the interaction of H5N1 virus with human NPCs. Infection of the H5N1 virus in human brain cells has been shown previously to bring about up-regulation of mRNA levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines [26]. In addition, infection of monocyte-derived human macrophages by influenza A viruses induced a significant up-regulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 [42]. It is known that interferon response has some potent antiviral effects during H5N1 virus infection [43,44]. The impairment of interferon production caused by H5N1 infection of the hNPCs in the present study suggests an underlying role of H5N1 virus in acute neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Similarly to the previous findings, we observed that infection of hNPCs by H5N1 virus resulted in marked up-regulation of TNF-\u03b1 mRNA expression [26]. Activation of TNF-\u03b1 has been postulated to induce apoptosis and cell death of H5N1 infected cells [26]. Moreover, TNF-\u03b1 seems to play a detrimental role in neural survival and differentiation [45]. Upregulation of TNF-\u03b1 by microglial cells could contribute to necrosis of hippocampal progenitor cells [46]. Furthermore, up-regulation of TNF-\u03b1 is important for disruption of the blood brain barrier (BBB) [47,48]. Such disruption results in leakage and accumulation of blood vessel fluid in the brain and spinal cord parenchyma, leading to CNS edema.",

            "text": "Infection of the neural progenitor cells by neurovirulent viruses such as Borna disease virus (BDV) has been shown in vitro to impair cellular development of progenitor cells [20]. A previous study also demonstrated that BDV infection decreases cell numbers during neural differentiation [20]. In the present study, cell death was observed predominantly in H5N1-infected groups, whereas the phenotype of the remaining hNPCs following H5N1 virus infection remained unaltered. These results could be explained by the facts that the differentiation protocol was not introduced in the present study. Moreover, the differentiation stage of these cells before cell death is unknown. Although we believe that the decrease in cell numbers were not due to experimental artifact, since the same number of cells were seeded into both infected- and mock-infected groups prior to virus infection. Though it is not known whether such an infection could induce differentiation of the hNPCs and, at the same time, triggers cell death of these differentiating cells. Still, it remains to be determined whether susceptible infection of H5N1 virus depends on the differentiation stages of hNPCs, or the differentiation capacity of hNPCs is triggered by H5N1 virus. Previous studies have shown that viruses can induce cellular dedifferentiation by either direct lytic effect or cellular dysregulation following exposure to pro- and inflammatory cytokines [20,21,39,49]. Taken together, the present study showed that hNPCs support H5N1 virus infection in vitro. Infection resulted in significant cell losses and up-regulation of TNF-\u03b1 pro-inflammatory cytokine. Moreover, phenotypic characterization of hNPCs was unaltered following H5N1 virus infection. Although our data did not demonstrate the dysregulation of hNPC development during acute H5N1 virus infection, it remains to be determined whether H5N1 virus or other low pathogenic strains of influenza viruses can deregulate neurogenesis or astrogliogenesis during the acute and chronic phase of infection. The results of the present study further support the role of at least one type of influenza virus in inducing encephalopathy.",
