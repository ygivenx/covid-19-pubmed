            "text": "Ultrasound, alone or combined with contrast agent microbubbles, have numerous applications ranging from being a well-established diagnostic tool (1, 2) to a method of drug delivery (3). The application of microbubbles and ultrasound to deliver nanoparticle carriers for drug and gene delivery is a research area that has expanded greatly in recent years. Recent studies reported that utilization of ultrasound contrast microbubbles causes the so-called \u201csonoporation\u201d effect (4, 5), which has been recognized as a significant factor in transient disruption of cell membrane permeability (6) that allows easier transport of extracellular compounds into the cytoplasm of viable cells (7). Ultrasound therapy now is widely used in clinical practice, and clinical/translational research in the treatment of various human malignancies and pathologies including breast cancer, leukemia, lymphoma, melanoma, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (8), hepatic cancer, nasopharyngeal cancers, glioma, ovarian cancer, colon cancer, gastric cancer (9), sarcoma (10\u201312), stroke (13), prostatic hyperplasia, renal masses (14), treatment of abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (15), bone repair (16), osteoarthritis (17), and carpal tunnel syndrome (18). So far, several therapeutic ultrasound formats have been developed including high intensity focused ultrasound (10) and low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (19). Recently, several clinical trials and experimental data verified the ability of ultrasound to elicit anti-inflammatory and tissue repair/regeneration responses (20, 21), suggesting the potential of using ultrasound as a novel therapeutic method (6, 22\u201325).",

            "text": "Cell death pathways have gained attention as novel therapeutic targets for treatment of cancers (26, 27) and inflammation (28, 29). We and others have reported that activated T cells survive by upregulating anti-cell death proteins such as Bcl-x\u03b3 (30), translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) (31) and inhibiting severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus E protein (32). Moreover, CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells readily undergo apoptosis (33) by upregulating pro-apoptotic protein Bax (34) and downregulating anti-apoptotic regulator TCTP (35, 36). In addition, metabolic disease-risk factors such as hyperlipidemia (37\u201339), hyperhomocysteinemia (40) and chronic kidney disease (41) accelerate vascular diseases by inducing inflammatory cell death (pyroptosis) or pyrop-apoptosis (37, 40). Interestingly, LIUS was reported to induce apoptosis, autophagy or necrosis in cancer cells including nasopharyngeal cancer cells (42), laryngeal cancer cells (43), hepatocellular cancer cells (43, 44), leukemia cells (45), lymphoma cells (46), and osteosarcoma cells (47). In contrast, LIUS affects various non-cancer immune cells and other cells by regulation of inflammation. For example, ultrasound promotes vasodilation, enhances blood flow, promotes fibroblast and osteoblast proliferation, and increases other cellular components leading to wound healing (21). Moreover, LIUS was reported to suppress synovial cell proliferation (48), affect mesenchymal stem cell migration (49), enhance the regeneration of myofibers (50), reduce the expression of inflammatory mediators (25), promote skin fibroblast proliferation (51), and chondrocyte and osteoblast proliferation (52). However, it remains unclear how LIUS can distinguish cancer cells from non-cancer cells and induce differential biological responses. Further, molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying LIUS mediated inflammation inhibition and cancer suppression effects are not understood.",

            "text": "In order to broaden our understanding of LIUS-mediated effects in cellular context, we hypothesized that LIUS may induce differential gene expression patterns of cell death regulators in cancer cells and non-cancer cells. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed the expression pattern of 299 cell death regulators in LIUS-treated cancer cells and non-cancer cells. These genes were responsible for regulating 13 different types of cell death mechanisms including apoptosis, MPT-driven necrosis, necroptosis, ferroptosis, pyroptosis, parthanatos, entotic cell death, NETotic cell death, lysosomal dependent cell death (LCDC), autophagy dependent cell death (ADCD), immunogenic cell death (ICD), mitotoic death, and anoikis. Herein, we will refer to the 299 cell death regulators of the 13 different types of cell death pathways that we included in this study as the cell death regulatome. Our data indicated that LIUS exerts a differential gene expression pattern of the cell death regulatome in cancer cells and non-cancer cells. Furthermore, our data implies that thermal effects and osmotic shear stress (OSS) associated with LIUS may potentially play a role in inducing the differential gene expression patterns of the cell death regulatome that we observed. Also, we observed that LIUS has the tendency to induce antioxidant effects in non-cancer cells, which may also contribute to the differential gene expression patterns of the cell death regulatome in LIUS-treated cancer cells and non-cancer cells. Most interestingly, we observed that the cell death regulator genes modulated by LIUS in cancer cells and non-cancer cells have unique chromatin long range interaction (CLRI) sites. Chromatin looping enables CLRIs, that gives the opportunity to gene promoters to interact with distal regulatory elements (53). Rapid development of technologies such as chromosome conformation capture-sequencing (3C-seq) (54), circularized chromosome conformation capture-sequencing (4C-seq) (55, 56) and chromosome conformation capture carbon copy-sequencing (5C-seq) (57) that capture chromosome conformation allow determination of interactions between the target genes and CLRI sites. The CLRI may enhance and modulate the expression of genes of interest. Differences in chromatin long-range interaction patterns between genes have previously been hypothesized to influence alternative splicing (58) and the transcription of inflammatory genes such as cytokine (59), cytokine receptor (60) and cardiovascular disease-causative genes (61). Therefore, we suggest that the unique CLRI seen in genes modulated by LIUS in cancer cells and non-cancer cells may play a role in producing a differential response.",

Of note, the 31 cell death regulators that were downregulated by LIUS treatment seem to attenuate several pro-inflammatory pathways including neuroinflammation signaling pathway, inflammasome pathway, NF-\u03baB signaling, TREM1 signaling, role of pattern recognition receptors in recognition of bacteria and viruses, role of macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in rheumatoid arthritis, HMGB1 signaling, Toll-like receptor signaling, altered T cell and B cell signaling in rheumatoid arthritis, communication between innate and adaptive immune cells, hepatic fibrosis/hepatic stellate cell activation, type I diabetes mellitus signaling, and role of osteoblasts, osteoclasts and chondrocytes in rheumatoid arthritis (Figure 1).

These findings are well-correlated with our previous publication where we reported that LIUS mediated upregulation of anti-inflammatory regulators (2). Furthermore, this data suggest that the majority of LIUS-downregulated cell death regulators in non-cancer cells are functional as inflammatory regulators, which confirmed our updated understanding that inflammation and cell death pathways are often inter-connected (70). For example, the binary classification of mammalian cell death regulators, such as caspases, as either apoptotic or inflammatory (71) is now obsolete. Emerging data indicate that all mammalian caspases are intricately involved in the regulation of inflammation and immunity (72).",

In order to explain this observation, we hypothesized that LIUS may modulate the expression of cell death-related transcription factors in both cancer and non-cancer cell groups. We found that tumor suppressor gene TP53 (73) was upregulated by LIUS treatment in cancer cells; and that serum response factor (SRF) was upregulated by LIUS in non-cancer cells (Table 6). To determine whether LIUS-induced TP53 plays roles in regulating the cell death regulator genes modulated by LIUS, we examined the expression of cell death regulators in TP53 gene deficiency cell microarray datasets. As shown in Table 7, we found that a list of LIUS-downregulated cell death regulators such as CD47, protein kinase ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) (74), caspase-1 (CASP1) (71), CASP4, CD47, and BCL2 were upregulated in human TP53 knock-down (KD) mesenchymal stem cell datasets. These results suggest that LIUS has the potential to regulate cell death regulator expression in cancer cells partially via inducing tumor suppressor transcription factor TP53 as we reported previously (34). Moreover, we found that SRF deficient cardiomyocytes express higher levels of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which was attenuated by LIUS treatment in non-cancer cells. HGF plays a central role in metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance and in diabetes pathophysiology (75). Therefore, upregulation of SRF may serve as the suppressive mechanism underlying attenuation of HGF seen in LIUS treated non-cancer cells. Taken together, our results have demonstrated that modulation of transcription factors such as TP-53 and SRF-1 may play a role in altered cell death regulator gene expression seen in LIUS-treated cancer cells and non-cancer cells, respectively.",

The biological effects of ultrasound are separated into thermal and non-thermal effects. The thermal effects of ultrasound that arise from the absorption of ultrasonic energy and creation of heat depend on ultrasound exposure parameters, tissue properties and beam configuration. Cavitation, acoustic radiation force, radiation torque, acoustic streaming, shock wave and shear stress are considered non-thermal effects of ultrasound (7) although there are some different opinions in classification of cavitation (7, 76, 77). LIUS is a form of ultrasound that delivered at a much lower intensity (<3 W/cm2) than high intensity focus ultrasound, and it has been considered as removed thermal component or minimal thermal effects due to its low intensity mode (78, 79). However, some publications have reported an increment of temperature by approximately 3 to 4\u00b0C after LIUS treatment (80), meaning that thermal effect is inevitable during LIUS treatment. We also examined the expressions of heat shock proteins in the three LIUS-treated microarrays and found that DNAJ (HSP40) heat shock protein (GAK) is upregulated (6.78-folds, p = 0.02) in one of the microarray datasets (human lymphoma, GSE10212) but is not significantly modulated in other two LIUS-treated microarray datasets. These results suggest that LIUS treatment induces the upregulation of heat shock protein gene and potential thermal stress; and that the differences in the expressions of GAK in three microarrays may be due to the potential differences of used LIUS methods and parameters as well as cell types (Table 1). We then hypothesized that thermal effects partially underlie the LIUS induced modulation of the cell death regulatome. To examine this hypothesis, we analyzed the microarray datasets conducted on cancer cells and non-cancer cells treated with mild hyperthermia (Table 1).",

Additionally, we observed that the expression of cell death regulators such as CYLD, EZR, VAMP1, ANAX1, and FPR1 was increased in mild hyperthermia treated cancer cells, which was similar to LIUS treated cancer cells. Further, we observed that expression of TLR7, MAP2K7, and SRC were downregulated in both data sets. Therefore, there is a possibility that mild hyperthermia associated with LIUS may regulate the expression of a few cell death regulators in cancer cells. Also, upregulation of the transcription factor TP-53 may occur due to mild hyperthermia associated with LIUS in cancer cells. Similarly, we observed that the expression of GCLC, NLRP3 and CD47 are downregulated in both groups of non-cancer cells treated with either LIUS or mild hyperthermia.",

These cell signaling pathways are granulocyte adhesion and diapedesis, Huntington's disease signaling, and molecular mechanisms of cancer. In addition, the down regulated cell death regulators in cancer cells treated by LIUS or mild hyperthermia shared 2 signaling pathways such as macropinocytosis signaling and virus entry via endocytotic pathway (Figure 3). Despite the fact that there are no common upregulated genes attributed to both groups, in non-cancer cells cell death regulators that are modulated by LIUS and mild hyperthermia shared five signaling pathways. These are PTEN signaling, Myc mediated apoptosis signaling, molecular mechanisms of cancer, IL-15 signaling, and PEDF signaling. Furthermore, cell death regulators that were downregulated by LIUS treatment or mild hyperthermia in non-cancer cells affected four signaling pathways including neuroinflammation signaling pathway, inflammasome pathway, TREM1 signaling, role of pattern recognition receptors in recognition of bacteria and viruses, and DHA signaling regulation. Taken together, these results suggest that unlike what was reported previously, thermal effect may play an indispensable role for the LIUS induced modulation of cell death regulators.",

Low grade reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation helps to mediate signaling that maintain the homeostasis of the cells, however, excess production of ROS can be detrimental to the cells by activating cell death pathways. Previously, it was shown that LIUS exerts cytoprotective effects against oxidative injury in human aortic endothelial cells and retinal pigment epithelium cells (85, 86). In contrast, LIUS exerts cancer suppressing effects by inducing ROS generation, which result in mitochondrial damage and subsequent cell death (44, 47, 87, 88). Therefore, we analyzed whether LIUS treatment exerts any expression changes of genes in our datasets that has the potential to regulate oxidative stress (Table 9). Interestingly, we observed that LIUS treatment in cancer cells induced the expression of genes that regulate ROS generation while downregulating the expression of GPX3 that has the potential to exert antioxidant effects. Therefore, this suggests that LIUS may cause changes in the redox status in cancer cells. Further, we observed that LIUS has the tendency to induce antioxidant effects in non-cancer cells by attenuating the gene expression of NOS2 and NOS3, which promote ROS generation, while promoting the expression of antioxidant genes GPX3 and GPX7. It is well-known that ROS can indeed impact the cell viability by affecting activity of caspases, mitochondrial function and activating apoptotic pathways depending on the cellular contexts (89). Therefore, it is a possibility that LIUS-mediated changes in the redox status of the cancer and non-cancer cells may have an impact on cell death regulator gene expression leading to activation of various cell death pathways.",

We then calculated the distances between 555 interacting sites (Figure 4D) with respect to LIUS-modulated gene promoters. If the LIUS-modulated gene promoter was located downstream of its long-range interaction partner, we designated the CLRI as negative. If the CLRI site is located downstream of the target gene promoter, we designated the interaction as positive. The two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of the chromatin long-range interaction distances between gene promoters corresponding to LIUS downregulated and upregulated genes indicated some significant differences between the two distance distributions (p < 0.001) (Figure 4E).",

However, in non-cancer cells, most of the CLRI sites of cell death regulator genes modulated by LIUS were located downstream of the target genes. Similar to the observation seen in genes modulated by LIUS in cancer cells, the CLRIs of upregulated cell death regulators spanned across a comparatively narrower region than that of downregulated genes in LIUS treated non-cancer cells.

We previously reported that LIUS may make use of natural membrane vesicles as small as exosomes which are derived from immunosuppressor cells to fulfill its anti-inflammatory effects by upregulating the expression of extracellular vesicle/exosome biogenesis mediators and docking mediators (2). Taken together, all these factors may profoundly affect cellular sensors that can activate various downstream signaling pathways in tissues exposed to LIUS. However, our findings suggest that cancer cells and non-cancer cells may use distinct signaling mechanisms to activate downstream targets when exposed to LIUS. Our analysis revealed that LIUS can activate more of antioxidant effects in non-cancer cells compared to cancer cells. Such changes in redox status of the cellular environment may lead to activation of sensors that may produce distinct gene expression patterns in non-cancer cells relative to cancer cells exposed to LIUS. Our data indicated that different cell death regulatory transcription factors are induced in cancer cells and non-cancer cells treated with LIUS. For an example, we observed that TP53 and SRF-1 genes were induced in LIUS treated cancer cells and non-cancer cells, respectively. Therefore, it can be hypothesized that LIUS produces differential biological responses in different cellular contexts by activating distinct transcription factors, thus activating specific gene expression patterns. Most interestingly, we observed unique patterns in CLRI sites in genes modulated by LIUS in cancer cells and non-cancer cells. Therefore, LIUS may have the ability to modulate CLRI sites in cancer cells and non-cancer cells, leading to distinct gene expression patterns. Also, mild hyperthermia and OSS associated with LIUS may also play a role in generating distinct transcriptome profiles depending on the cellular context.",
