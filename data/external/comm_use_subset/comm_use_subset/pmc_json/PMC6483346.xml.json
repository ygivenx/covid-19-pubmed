            "text": "Canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD), also known as \u201cKennel cough\u201d, is an endemic syndrome with multiple viral and bacterial pathogens being involved in disease causation [1]. CIRD is most common when dogs are kept in large groups with continuous intake of new animals, particularly in kennels, but also occurs in singly housed pets [2]. Clusters of infection have also been documented in veterinary hospitals [3]. Common clinical signs include nasal discharge, coughing, respiratory distress, fever, lethargy and lower respiratory tract infections [1, 3\u20135]. The clinical signs caused by the different pathogens associated with this syndrome are similar, which makes differential diagnosis challenging. Vaccination plays an important role in managing CIRD, and as such, several mono and multivalent vaccines are available [6]; however, despite the widespread use of vaccines to prevent CIRD, clinical disease is still common in vaccinated dogs [2, 6]. Vaccines are commercially available for some, but not all pathogens, which may explain the occasional lack of protection.",

New or emerging microorganisms associated with CIRD include canine influenza virus (CIV) [11], canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCov) [12], Mycoplasma cynos [13] and Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus (S. zooepidemicus) [14]. Other novel canine respiratory agents include canine pneumovirus [15], canine bocavirus [16], canine hepacivirus [17, 18] and canine picornavirus [19]. There is debate on whether these are truly new emerging pathogens or pre-existing pathogens that are now easier to detect due to the advent of sophisticated molecular diagnostic tools and more frequent diagnostic testing. In recent years, the role of other bacterial agents such as Mycoplasma canis has been questioned [13, 20]. It is unknown whether certain Mycoplasma species such as M. canis act as a commensal, primary or secondary agent.",

Understanding disease prevalence facilitates the improvement or establishment of new vaccination programs and alternative treatments. To aid in addressing this question, we conducted a disease surveillance study using molecular methods to detect nine pathogens currently known to be involved in CIRD using samples from symptomatic and asymptomatic dogs that were received at a veterinary diagnostic laboratory. The aim was to attain information regarding pathogen occurrence according to age, seasonality, sex, clinical signs, and vaccination history. This study also aimed to evaluate the role of co-infections in disease severity, and to develop a novel probe-based multiplex real-time PCR assay to simultaneously detect and differentiate M. cynos and M. canis.",

Clinical samples submitted to the AVDL are accompanied by a paper submission form, which asks questions regarding clinical history, vaccination records and clinical signs. These submission forms are then scanned and partially transcribed to an electronic database. This database was queried to retrieve all submission forms between 2011 and 2017 that requested a canine respiratory PCR panel. Signalment, clinical presentation and history of vaccination were retrieved from 559 of these electronically stored paper-based forms. The majority of these samples were received from the southeastern region of the United States. Submission forms provided no information as to whether the animals had been previously kenneled. From 2011 to 2016, the AVDL canine respiratory PCR panel included Mycoplasma spp., B. bronchiseptica, CAV, CDV, coronavirus (CoV) and influenza A Matrix (H3N2 and H3N8). In July 2017, PCR tests for identification of M. canis, M. cynos and S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus were added to the panel. Since our laboratory stores DNA for 6 months (-20\u00b0C), we were able to perform the new diagnostic tests included in the panel on all clinical samples received in 2017, by reanalyzing stored DNA. In order to investigate the presence of canine respiratory pathogens in dogs without clinical signs of respiratory disease (controls), nasal swabs were prospectively collected 4h to 24h postmortem from carcasses of asymptomatic dogs (n = 52) that were submitted to the AVDL for necropsy. These animals were selected to represent a similar age and sex distribution as the animals with clinical signs of CIRD (~ 50% males, 50% females; age mean \u00b1 SD = 2.1 \u00b1 1.08 years). These control animals had no history of respiratory clinical disease according to the referring veterinarians and available medical records, which covered the entire life span of young animals (< 2-year-old) and at least the last year of life in older (> 2-year-old) dogs. Board-certified pathologists examined the clinical records from the asymptomatic control group, and performed complete postmortem and histological examinations to confirm that the animals were not affected by respiratory disease at the time of euthanasia. All the data collected in this study was part of routine diagnostic work-up in client-owned animals, and no additional testing or diagnostic procedures were performed for the purpose of this study. Therefore, The University of Georgia does not require Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee review and approval of such studies as long as the retrospective records review does not contain animal ID or client information. The animals investigated in this study were not identifiable in the retrospective records (e.g. only sample ID barcoding was used to identify samples).",

For CoV, the primers targeted the replicase gene, which is well conserved among coronaviruses, and therefore, do not allow distinction between respiratory (CRCoV) and enteric (CCoV) canine coronaviruses [28]. Further details of the PCR assays are described in supplementary table 2 (S2 Table).

Synthetic DNA plasmids were purchased from GENEWIZ (South Plainfield, NJ, USA). Each E. coli colony-forming unit (CFU) contained one copy of the plasmid. E. coli was cultured overnight on Luria-Bertani agar with Kanamycin (Remel, San Diego, CA, USA) and isolated colonies were used to prepare a 10-fold serial dilution from a starting 0.5 McFarland concentration. Each dilution was plated on McConkey agar (Remel) in triplicate (100\u03bcl). Colony counting was performed after 24h of incubation at 37\u00b0C. DNA was extracted from each dilution as described above. The limit of detection (LOD) was defined as the lowest concentration at which 95% of the positive samples were detected [30]. The concentration (plasmid copy number) in each dilution was calculated from the plate counts (CFU/mL). The copy number in each PCR reaction was calculated based on the extraction volume (200\u03bcl), the final elution volume (120\u03bcl) and the volume per reaction (5\u03bcl); assuming error free conditions. Dilutions were repeated in triplicate runs for each targeted microorganism and standard curves were constructed from the Cq values. PCR efficiency was calculated according to MIQE guidelines [30, 31].",

To assess the effect of season on the occurrence of CIRD pathogens, seasonality was divided into cold and warm seasons, which are the two clear predominant seasons in the state of Georgia, United States. The cold season was defined as October 15th to April 15th, when temperatures vary from 1\u00b0C to 22\u00b0C. The warm season was defined as April 16th to October 14th, when temperatures vary from 11\u00b0C to 31\u00b0C. The rate of pathogen detection by age was evaluated in four categories defined as puppyhood (1 to 12 month-old), adolescence (1\u20133 year-old), adulthood (4\u20138 year-old) and senior (>8-year-old). Clinical signs were separated in the three following categories: score 0 was given to asymptomatic dogs sampled at necropsy (absence of clinical, macroscopic and histologic signs of respiratory diseases), score 1 was given to dogs with mild clinical signs, and score 2 was given to animals presenting with moderate to severe clinical signs (Table 2). Differences in the rate of detection of CIRD pathogens across life stages, seasons, clinical sign categories and sex were assessed by Fisher\u2019s Exact test using Stata statistical software (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, USA, version 15.1). Pairwise comparisons between categories were performed using the Bonferroni procedure to limit the overall type I error rate to 5%. Confidence intervals for the rate of detection were calculated using the exact method in Graphpad software (http://graphpad.com/quickcalcs/confInterval2/).

In order to determine whether specific pathogens were more likely to be associated with severe clinical disease, a 3D network analysis was performed [34, 35]. Based on the results of these analyses, the associations between clinical scores and CPIV+M. canis, CPIV+M. cynos, CPIV+M. cynos+M. canis, CPIV+B. bronchiseptica, B. bronchiseptica+M. cynos+CPIV, CPIV+M. cynos+M. canis infections were assessed using binomial generalized linear models. Potential predictors included sex, age, the total number of infections, and the presence of M. cynos, M. canis, B. bronchiseptica and CPIV single infections with clinical score (mild vs severe) as a binomial response. Predictors were added and excluded based on the analysis of each model output (Akaike\u2019s Information Criteria, P values, coefficients, and deviance), and all fitted models were ranked based on second order Akaike\u2019s Information Criteria (AICc) using the \u201cMuMln\u201d package in R statistical software [36] (R core development team, Vienna, Austria, version 3.2.2).

Our results indicated that the presence of co-infections and young age were associated with the severity of clinical signs.

In fact, our data show that very few clinically ill animals (n = 17), previously vaccinated against B. bronchiseptica, CDV, CPIV and influenza, were PCR positive for these agents. This result emphasizes the important role of CIRD vaccination regimes and suggests that currently available vaccines against B. bronchiseptica, CAV and CDV are effective.

Previous investigations on canine respiratory viruses have found high prevalence of CPIV in clinically ill dogs [5, 20, 37], and a Canadian study reported CPIV as the cause of a respiratory disease outbreak in a veterinary hospital [3]. Influenza is a newly described CIRD respiratory virus [11, 12]. In the United States, canine influenza is caused by two subtypes: H3N8 and H3N2. Canine H3N8 was first identified in 2004 in racing greyhounds in Florida, United States [11], and it has been reported that this strain developed from an equine H3N8 influenza strain that was transmitted from horses to dogs [11]. Canine H3N2 was first identified in the United States in March 2015, following an outbreak of respiratory illness in dogs from Chicago [38]. Between 2011 and 2017, we found 57 PCR positive samples for influenza A (including H3N8 and H3N2); interestingly, 51/57 of these positive samples were processed in 2015, which coincides with the H3N2 canine influenza outbreak in the United States. To date, there is no evidence of spread of canine influenza viruses from dogs to people [39]; however, special attention is warranted due to the risk of viral genetic reassortment. Therefore, continued monitoring of canine influenza by veterinary and human health agencies is of critical importance.",

Despite the clear involvement of M. cynos in lower respiratory tract infections [4, 13, 41], there is limited information on the prevalence and pathogenesis of this agent. In this study, M. cynos was one of the most prevalent pathogens (24.5%), and it was more commonly identified in symptomatic than asymptomatic dogs. In the first group, there was a significant association between the presence of this pathogen and the development of moderate and severe clinical signs. Similar findings were observed in a large rehoming kennel where M. cynos was most common in dogs with moderate signs of CIRD [13]. The role of other Mycoplasma species in canine respiratory infections, including M. canis, has been a recent topic of research and debate. In this study, we found a significant association between the presence of M. canis and the severity of clinical signs. M. canis is considered part of the microbiota of the upper respiratory tract of dogs [13, 42], and was previously found not to be significantly associated with respiratory disease [13]. Our interest in this microorganism was triggered by a recent study where M. canis was associated with acute respiratory disease in dogs [20], which along with our findings provide further insights into a potential role of M. canis in CIRD. In addition, M. canis appears to be a common co-infection and warrants further consideration by veterinarians and diagnostic laboratories.",

Our approach was to include necropsied dogs in order to ensure the absence of lesions in the respiratory tract. We carefully selected the necropsied dogs based on age, clinical history, macroscopic and histologic findings. The likelihood of detecting pathogens in post-mortem samples may differ; however, based on prior investigations on viral and bacterial persistence on inanimate surfaces and cadavers, we believe that the integrity of the nucleic acid material from the microorganisms was maintained. Our assumption is supported by other studies showing that Bordetella pertussis persisted on inanimate surfaces for 3\u20135 days, influenza virus for 1\u20132 days and adenovirus for 7 days [40] [41] [42,43]. Tubercle bacilli was isolated from cadavers within 24 hours post-mortem [44], and viable human immunodeficiency virus was recovered from patients at autopsy 6 to 16 days after death [45, 46]. Furthermore, the pathogens surveyed in our study are routinely detected from nasal swabs collected during necropsy from dogs diagnosed with respiratory disease in our diagnostic laboratory.",

First, the PCR-based assays could potentially yield false-positive results in dogs that recently received modified live vaccines containing the specific pathogens of interest. This assumption is based on findings from a previous study showing that PCR assays may detect vaccine content within 28 days after vaccination with modified live vaccines against CAV, B. bronchiseptica and CPIV [45]. Since the time between vaccination and the onset of clinical CIRD was not documented in our submission forms, we cannot say with certainty whether positive PCR results corresponded to field or vaccine strains. Secondly, as with any pathogen detection test, the PCR assays may yield false-negative results if samples are collected at a point in the disease process when pathogens are not present at detectable levels [46].",

Key findings were that younger dogs and those with a higher number of co-infections are more likely to develop severe clinical signs, underscoring the importance of vaccination against CIRD at an early age. Our findings also highlight the low occurrence of classical CIRD agents such as B. bronchiseptica, CAV and CDV, while emphasizing the potential role of emerging bacteria such as M. canis and M. cynos. The developed real-time PCR assay for simultaneous detection of M. cynos and M. canis in clinical specimens provided results within 2h in a highly standardized format, representing a fast and efficient diagnosis alternative. The information presented here will help veterinarians obtain a timely etiologic diagnosis, and facilitate the selection of appropriate therapies and disease control measures.",
