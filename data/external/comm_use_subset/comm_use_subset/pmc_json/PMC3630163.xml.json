Epidemiological data show that HFMD had an increasing trend in Southeast Asia in the past 20 years. It is well known that a big outbreak of HFMD occurred in Taiwan in 1998 [1]. In China, the number of HFMD cases and fatal HFMD cases has been increasing every year, and multiple major HFMD outbreaks caused by Human enterovirus 71 (HEV71) had occurred in several provinces in China. HFMD affects more than one million children and is responsible for several hundred children deaths every year, causing widespread concern in society.",

HEV71 and coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) are the two major causative agents of HFMD. It is worth noting that HEV71 may also cause severe neurologic diseases or significant fatalities, especially in young children [2], [3]. Hence, timely detection and differentiation of HEV71 specifically from CVA16 in the early phase of HFMD infection are important, which is helpful to reduce the deaths caused by HEV71. However, as the clinical symptoms of HEV71- and CVA16-associated HFMD are similar, the pathogen diagnosis largely depends on virus isolation and serotyping to differentiate HEV71 from CVA16 [4]. Using conventional RT-PCR strategy, specific detection of HEV71 or CVA16 has been reported [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. However, the two-step RT-PCR process is time-consuming and easily prone to cross-contamination during the experiment, making it unsuitable for pathogen diagnosis in HFMD outbreaks. In recent years, real-time RT-PCR assay has gained wider acceptance for viral diagnosis in laboratories because of high sensitivity and specificity as well as rapid detection. Furthermore, it provides real-time monitoring of the amplification process through fluorescence emission [10].",

The entire procedure for real-time RT-PCR detection required only 2 h, which was more rapid than the tissue culture method and conventional RT-PCR assay. In addition, as the experimental run protocol of the multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay for HEV71 and CVA16 is similar to that of the broad-spectrum real-time RT-PCR assay for HEVs, the two real-time RT-PCR assays could be simultaneously run for detection in the ABI7500 instrument. Combined with the use of these two assays, the pathogens of HFMD could be quickly determined in the early stage of HFMD outbreaks.",

Using BLAST (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST) and DNASTAR program, highly conserved VP1 sequences of HEV71 or CVA16 were utilized to design primers and probes. A pair of primers (HEV71YGF and HEV71YGR) and a hybridization probe [HEV71YG(HEX)PB] were designed for specific detection of HEV71, and another pair of primers (CVA16YGF and CVA16YGR) and a hybridization probe (CVA16YGPB) were designed for specific detection of CVA16. The TaqMan probes of HEV71 and CVA16 were labeled with HEX and FAM fluorescence dyes at their 5\u2032-ends, respectively, and with BHQ1 at the 3\u2032-end. In addition, it must be emphasized that there was no detection channel for HEX fluorescence in the ABI7500 instrument. As VIC and HEX were very similar in the fluorescence emitted, VIC could be used for detection, instead of HEX in the ABI7500 instrument.
