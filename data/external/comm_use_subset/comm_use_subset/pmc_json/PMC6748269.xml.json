Topics of great relevance to global health, such as avian influenza, Ebola, HIV, malaria, Middle East respiratory syndrome, tuberculosis, and Zika, were discussed on Twitter and other social media platforms [23456789]. In the United States, federal, state, and local health agencies use social media to share and disseminate health-related information to the general public [101112]. In particular, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) maintained a portfolio of social media communication efforts [13]. Prior research has studied user engagement of CDC Facebook communication during the Ebola emergency response [1415], as well as individual Twitter chats that CDC hosted during the Ebola and Zika outbreaks [1617]. However, no studies to date analyze how CDC Twitter communication promoted their monthly events and publications. In this case study, we are going to focus on CDC Public Health Grand Rounds and CDC Vital Signs and their related Twitter communication.",

Nevertheless, while attaching visual cues to a CDC tweet increased retweets in nearly one half of the cycles of #CDCGrandRounds tweets and #VitalSigns tweets studied, such effect was not observed in the other half. It raises questions regarding whether the types of health contents may interact with the attachment of visual cues. However, since the confidence intervals of most estimates overlap with each other, we chose not to perform a multivariable analysis, as it would not be informative. Besides, there were many cycles and there would be many levels including each cycle and its interaction with visual cues. This would require estimating many parameters and our sample size is not large enough for that. Given the diversity of topics here, we could not identify with confidence specific topics that attaching images or videos may have an effect. In the future, control experiments could be performed to test the hypothesis that content might interact with visual cues to attract more retweets.",

Therefore, for multiple cycles, we had to manually code more than 30 tweets to obtain a sample of 30 relevant tweets with the highest frequency of retweets. Results of the effect of visual cues reported here are univariable PRs. Given the limited sample size and the nature of our sample, we did not control for the effect of other variables.
