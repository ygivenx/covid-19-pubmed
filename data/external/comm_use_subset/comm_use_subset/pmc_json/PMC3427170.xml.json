            "text": "More than 70% of the emerging infectious disease agents are caused by microbes jumping from animals into human. This has been well exemplified by the highly fatal human infection due to avian influenza A H5N1 in 1997 [1]. The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by a novel coronavirus in 2003 [2], confirmed again that microbes can jump species from animals to humans with unpredictable consequence. The human SARS coronavirus was traced to caged civets in the market [3], and later Chinese horseshoe bat, Rhinolophus sinicus, was suggested to be a likely reservoir of SARS coronavirus [4]. Bats are ideal incubators for new emerging infectious agents as they are mammals which roosted together and can fly over vast geographical distance [5]. This has reignited the interest in seeking for new bat viruses including many bat coronaviruses and the recent discovery of bat influenza virus [6]. Besides the SARS coronavirus, viruses in bats often infect human through intermediate hosts such as horses for Hendra virus, pigs for Nipah virus, and chimpanzees for Ebola virus [5]. It is therefore important to catalogue as comprehensively as possible the animal viruses present in wild life especially the bats and birds, the food animals such as pigs and cattles, the pet animals such as cats and dogs, and monkeys which are phylogenetically close to humans. Using consensus primer polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening, we have been able to discover relatively closely related species of virus in many different animals [4], [7]\u2013[23]. However more distant or novel families of virus can only be found by metagnenomics using deep sequencing with the newer generation sequencers [24],[25]. We report in this paper the discovery and characterization of a novel bat papillomavirus (PV) from rectal swab samples randomly collected from asymptomatic wild, food and pet animals using a metagenomic approach.",

The pairwise identity values from nucleotides and proteins were calculated using MEGA5 [33]. Only the PV core early (E) ORFs E1 and E2 and the late (L) ORFs L1 and L2 were included as only these ORFs are ubiquitous present in all characterized PVs. L1 nucleotide sequences of MscPV1 and 78 PVs with complete genomes, representing all presently classified genera, were used for phylogenetic analysis. Maximum likelihood trees were constructed using PhyML with GTR+I+G model [34]. Modelgenerator was used to obtain the model for the likelihood analysis [35].",

The remaining viral-like sequences shared homology to canary circovirus, anellovirus and densovirus in which densovirus is a linear single-stranded DNA virus.

The genome of HPV41 consists of an additional E5 ORF located between E4 and L2 ORFs and three additional short ORFs, X, Y and Z downstream of L1 [62]. The E5 ORF, which is absent in MscPV1, exists in genital HPVs and in the BPV-1 related fibropaillomaviruses, codes for the E5 protein, which is associated with transformation of host cells and carcinogenesis [62], [63]. The predicted E7 protein of MscPV1 contains a modified zinc-binding domain with 30 amino acids (X30) between the two instances of CXXC. This nonclassical motif was also identified in HPV41 and RaPV1 as well as BPV6, CPV2, CPV7, CcaPV1, HPV4, HPV65, HPV95 and HPV116. The E7 of EdPV1 exhibits the classical CXXCX29CXXC motif, whereas CPV6 has the X28 modified motif. The E1 of MscPV1 contains the conserved ATP-binding site of the ATP-dependent helicase (GPPDTGKS), which is identical to that of RaPV1; in comparison, the motif is GPPNTGKS in EdPV1 and CPV6, and GPSDTGKS in HPV41. This sequence conservation is not unexpected, given the drastic decrease of ATPase activity upon mutation of just the first proline or the lysine residue of the motif demonstrated by a mechanistic study [64]. In the NCR of both MscPV1 and RaPV1, two copies of the 12-basepair E2 protein-binding motif ACCN6GGT are found. The genomes of HPV41 and EdPV1, notably, do not contain this consensus nucleotide sequence; their E2 binding sites are represented by the sequences ACCN6GTT, AACN6GGT, and AACN6GTT [62], [65].",

            "text": "Family Papillomaviridae is a large family of small, non-enveloped, double stranded DNA viruses which infect cutaneous and mucosal epithelium. Given the association between PV and cancers in humans and other animals, it is not surprising that the first bat PV was found in the basosquamous carcinoma of a fruit bat. PVs are stable and slow-evolving viruses, with an estimated mutation rate of 0.73 to 1.2\u00d710\u22128 nucleotide substitutions per base per year [66], [67]. No genomic recombination has ever been documented. Novel PVs, therefore, have been believed to descend from the slow accumulation of point mutations and different ancient PV lineages have possibly co-evolved and co-speciated with their vertebrate host species [68], [69]. Nonetheless, a more recent study showed that recombination of PV contributes significantly to the evolution of PV, and the role of host transfer cannot be neglected. Notably, both were observed in the HPV41-EdPV1 clade [70]. This is concordant with the current study, in which nucleotide and amino acid sequence analysis demonstrated a higher degree of similarity between our novel MscPV1 and EdPV1 in North American porcupine, instead of another bat PV, RaPV1. We note, however, our findings may only represent an additional exception and do not refute the generalization that PVs evolve mainly by co-evolution with hosts instead of interspecies transmission, recombination or other horizontal genetic transfer events. While current evidence suggests that host shift may have contributed to the emergence of this lineage of bat PV, as evidenced by the different clades in which the MscPV1 and we reckon that there may be bat PV lineages that are yet to be discovered, and such \u201cmissing-links\u201d may enable the evolutionary history of MscPV1 to be put into context, i.e. whether the MscPV1 has undergone unexpected, rapid divergent evolution or indeed represents a lineage of bat PVs that has arisen from host shift. Although divergence time estimation using the L1 nucleotide sequence of MscPV1 demonstrated a later divergence compared to the host species (Fig. S1), it differed from the estimate based on E1 nucleotide sequences (Fig. S2) and does not in itself substantiate the host transfer (Supporting Information S1). In the current study, the more convincing evidence seemingly still resides in the sister taxa status of MscPV1 and HPV41/EdPV1. The relative importance of virus-host co-divergence and interspecies transmission in driving the genomic evolution of PV remains to be debated [71].",

M. schreibersii is a cave-dwelling bat with body weight ranged from 11 to 18 g. It roosts in abandoned mines, water tunnels, drainage and weep holes of the water catchment. According to the baseline surveys of the AFCD of Hong Kong, M. schreibersii is considered as common and widespread throughout Hong Kong countryside with a colony size from 50 individuals to several hundreds, often associated with M. pusillus, Myotis pilosus and M. chinensis in their roosting sites in summer. In overseas studies, it is reported as a migratory bat species which may travel a fairly long distance in spring to find their breeding sites [72]. Given the possibilities of asymptomatic carriage and long-distance, interspecies transmission, further studies are warranted to elucidate the evolutionary origin and epidemiology of this newly proposed genus of bat PV.",
