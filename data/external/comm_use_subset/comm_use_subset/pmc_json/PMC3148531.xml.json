Further development of cross-serovar vaccines would benefit from a molecular understanding of APP pathogenesis, which is a complex process involving a number of different potential virulence factors. The most commonly associated virulence factors [8] i.e., ApxI, ApxII, ApxIII, and ApxIV, have been tested as subunit vaccine candidates offering potential cross-serovar protection [9,10]. DNA vaccines encoding multiple Apx toxins offer a novel strategy for protecting against APP infection [11]. In addition to Apx toxins, several other APP proteins have been researched as vaccine candidates, such as the 48 kDa outer membrane protein [12] and the 30 kDa membrane protein of the ABC transporter family [13]. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-based vaccines are alternative to protein antigens [14].",

In this study, we overcame this challenge by using the layer function of PhotoshopCS to compare western blot and 2DE gels with the ponceaus S stain as an intermediate state. The same membranes used for western blots were also stained with Ponceau S to visualize all proteins. Digital images of the western blots and Ponceau S-stained membranes were compared with the 2DE gels by aligning the images with the layer function of Photoshop CS (Additional file 1, Figure S1, Additional file 2, Figure S2, Additional file 3, Figure S3, Additional file 4, Figure S4). Using this method to align developed membranes and 2DE gels in the pH 4-7 range (Figures 1, 2) and the pH 7-11 range (Figures 3, 4), we found 42 immunoreactive protein spots that represented 32 different proteins. The identified spots were labeled on each gel (Figures 1, 2, 3 and 4).",

Descriptive data for the identified spots are listed in Tables 1 and 2. Only the proteins ranking first in each matching search are shown. Western blot analysis with convalescent sera from swine naturally infected APP serotype 1, led us to identify 32 immunoreactive spots, representing 25 proteins, including 21 that separated in the pH 4-7 range (Figure 1) and 4 that separated in the pH 7-11 range (Figure 3). Western blot analysis with hyperimmune sera raised in an S259-immunized rabbit revealed 10 immunoreactive spots that represented 7 proteins, including 5 that separated in the pH 4-7 range (Figure 2) and 2 that separated in the pH 7-11 range (Figure 4).",

Furthermore the test allows clear differentiation between pigs infected with APP and healthy pigs that were vaccinated against APP. In addition, we have traced the background of corresponding swine.

Briefly, the PVDF membranes were submerged in Ponceau S stain solution (0.1% w/v Ponceau S, 5% v/v acetic acid) with gentle agitation for 5 min. The membranes were washed several times with distilled water (dH2O) until the protein spots were visible; the Ponceau S-stained membranes were digitally scanned with a Umax scanner (TE77, GE Healthcare, Shanghai, China).
