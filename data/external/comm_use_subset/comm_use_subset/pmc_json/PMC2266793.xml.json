Rhinovirus is the most common virus associated with the common cold and is also the most common virus implicated in asthma exacerbations [1], [2]. There is a need to quantify cold symptoms in the assessment of an asthma exacerbation, both to detect viral causes and to monitor progress. These measures are especially needed to evaluate responses in treatment studies. Several scales have been developed to discriminate those with and without a viral infection [3], monitor symptoms in response to treatment of the common cold [4], and to assess the impact of symptoms on quality of life [5], [6] and disease severity [7], [8] in people without asthma. However, the ability of these questionnaires to discriminate viral infection in acute asthma from a non-infectious exacerbation is not known, and their responsiveness in acute asthma is also unknown. This needs to be directly evaluated since the overlap between symptoms of asthma and common cold symptoms could limit the utility of common cold questionnaires in an asthma exacerbation. Such measures may be particularly important in the assessment of anti-viral and anti-inflammatory therapies in asthma exacerbations. The aims of this study were to assess whether the common cold questionnaire (CCQ) [9] could detect a respiratory viral infection during asthma exacerbation in both adults and children, and to describe the ability of the CCQ to monitor recovery from a viral induced asthma exacerbation.",

Subjects were classified by CCQ as \u2018no virus\u2019 if there were no symptoms, as a \u2018possible virus\u2019 if they had mild symptoms in one domain plus a cough, and as a \u2018probable\u2019 virus if there were moderate symptoms in at least two domains or mild symptoms in three domains. The asthma history questionnaire detailed the age of diagnosis and the history of the subject's asthma over the past year. This included the number of exacerbations, doctor and hospital visits, episodes of worsened asthma and the number of days missed from work or school due to asthma. Asthma control was assessed over the previous week using an asthma control questionnaire that scored symptoms, activity limitation and rescue beta agonist use on a 0\u20136 scale[11].",

People with asthma respond to other triggers that can cause nose symptoms such as allergens, and rhinitis is a common comorbidity in asthma. Chest symptoms are also a feature of an asthma exacerbation, and constitute one of the domains of the CCQ. Thus non-infectious exacerbations of asthma could cause chest symptoms and reduce the specificity of the CCQ. Recent data indicate an altered pathogenesis of viral infection in asthma compared to controls. RV infection is considered to be an upper airway infection. However, people with asthma experience lower respiratory symptoms more often in viral infection [20] and RV is frequently isolated from the lower respiratory tract in asthma [21], [22], [23]. This altered pathogenesis may be due to impaired innate antiviral responses in the respiratory epithelium in asthma [24]. The result is a greater overlap between common cold and asthma symptoms. Consequently there are several possible explanations for the limited discriminant validity of the CCQ in asthma.",
