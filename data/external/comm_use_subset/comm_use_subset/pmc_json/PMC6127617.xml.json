            "text": "Influenza A virus (IAV) is a common respiratory pathogen that undergoes seasonal antigenic drift continually giving rise to variant strains that can escape existing immune protection. This viral drift detrimentally impacts public health as well as the economy within the United States, which is exemplified by the ~310,000 hospitalizations, 12,000 deaths, and an $87 million-dollar financial burden observed during the 2015\u20132016 season (1, 2). Traditionally, the spread of IAV has been prevented by two vaccination strategies: inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) and live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). Both IIV and LAIV primarily provide systemic immunity by inducing IAV-specific antibody responses (3, 4). However, it is less clear if these vaccination strategies generate robust de novo IAV-specific CD4 or CD8 T cell responses within the lower lung mucosa (4\u20137). Due to its intramuscular delivery, IIV is not thought to drive airway-resident effector T cell responses (6). Although LAIV has been shown to induce T cell responses within the lungs of mice following whole lung inoculation (6), when LAIV vaccination has been limited to the upper respiratory tract in animal models, similar to its replication location in humans, it does not induce T cell responses within the lower lung mucosa (7).",

However, infection-induced immunity also confers protection through underlying T cell responses that can provide cross-strain protection. T cell-mediated heterosubtypic protection has been well described in animal models (10\u201313) and was shown to confer increased protection in humans during the most recent 2009 H1N1 pandemic (12). Furthermore, studies in animal models of IAV infection have demonstrated that the pulmonary immune system imprints effector T cells with lung homing capabilities as well as induces the formation of local tissue-resident memory T and B cells that are thought to provide optimal protection (13\u201318). This tissue-resident phenotype is thought to depend on antigen longevity, antigen presenting cells (APC), and tertiary structures within the tissues (18\u201323). Therefore, vaccines that utilize tissue-specific factors and pathways critical for the induction of pulmonary T and B cell responses to generate local as well as systemic immunity by mimicking IAV infection would be predicted to confer more robust protection.",

(24\u201326). This platform offers several distinct advantages: the particles degrade into biocompatible products, activate APC, maintain the stability of encapsulated antigen, enable dose sparing of the antigen, and may be stored at room temperature or higher for up to 4 months thus breaking the cold chain (27, 28). Another important feature of our nanoparticle technology is that it provides a sustained release of encapsulated antigen via surface erosion and acts as a long-term antigen depot. Therefore, it could mimic the antigen depot that occurs after IAV infections and potentiate tissue-resident memory formation (21, 22, 29). However, the capability of intranasal (i.n.) administration of polyanhydride nanoparticles to induce local (i.e., lung) and systemic adaptive immunity, drive tissue-resident memory formation, and offer cross-strain protection against IAV has not yet been explored.",

Our results illustrate that i.n. vaccination with IAV-nanovax induced robust lung-resident germinal center (GC) B cells along with systemic and lung localized IAV-specific antibody responses. Notably, similar to IAV infections, i.n. administered IAV-nanovax induced lung-resident memory CD4 and CD8 T cell responses.

Next, 20:80 CPTEG:CPH nanoparticles containing 1% H1 HA, 1% NP, and 2% CpG1668 were synthesized via solid-oil-oil double emulsion (32). Briefly, HA and NP protein antigens (Sino Biological, Beijing, China) were dialyzed to nanopure water and lyophilized overnight. The 20:80 CPTEG:CPH copolymer, along with HA, NP, and CpG (ODN 1668, Invivogen, San Diego, CA), was dissolved at a polymer concentration of 20 mg/mL in methylene chloride.

The HA protein was included as it is a primary component of current vaccination strategies and is a focus of neutralizing antibody responses. In addition, NP protein was incorporated as it has been shown to drive NP-specific T cell responses that provide protection against heterologous infection as well as induce non-neutralizing antibody responses that facilitate more rapid T cell responses upon subsequent exposures (41, 42). These nanoparticles were then administered i.n. in water along with 2.5 \u03bcg of free HA and NP proteins in a prime+boost regimen as previous work from our laboratories (25, 26) has shown that the additional soluble antigen together with the nanovaccine during a prime+boost vaccination enhanced the immune response and protection following subcutaneous vaccination.",

            "text": "Since the generation of IAV-specific antibody responses are frequently used to determine IAV vaccine efficacy, we began by analyzing B cell responses in the lungs following i.n. IAV-nanovax vaccination and compared the response to mice i.n. infected with IAV (PR8; H1N1), mice i.m. vaccinated with IIV, or mice that were left untreated (na\u00efve). In order to distinguish between lymphocytes embedded in the lung interstitium from those in the vasculature, we utilized an in vivo fluorophore-conjugated antibody labeling technique (34) (Supplemental Data Sheet 1). To this end, mice were intravascularly (i.v.) infused prior to lung harvest with a fluorescent antibody to label B cells within the circulation (CD45i.v.Abpos) vs. those in the lung parenchyma (CD45i.v.Abneg) (Supplemental Data Sheet 1). Using this technique, we observed that total lung-resident B cells (CD19posB220posCD45i.v.Abneg) were significantly higher for IAV-infected and IAV-nanovax vaccinated mice compared to na\u00efve and IIV controls at 32 and 45 days following infection/vaccination (Figures 1A,D). Consistent with the increase in total numbers in IAV-infected and IAV-nanovax treated mice, lung-resident GC B cells (CD19posB220posCD45i.v.AbnegPNApos) were also significantly elevated at both time points (Figures 1B,E and Supplemental Data Sheet 1). Similar trends were also observed in the lung draining lymph nodes (data not shown). As GC B cell reactions result in class-switched B cells that produce higher affinity antibodies, we next compared the frequencies of IgMneg lung-resident GC B cells between IAV-infected and IAV-nanovax treated mice. As previously shown, IAV infection induces a substantial proportion of the GC response in the lungs to switch to IgG (IgMnegIgGpos) (36). Similar to IAV-infected mice, approximately 70% of lung resident GC B cells were IgMneg in IAV-nanovax mice, a finding consistent with a robust, mature GC response (Figures 1C,F). These results suggest that i.n. administration of IAV-nanovax induces lung-resident GC B cell responses capable of producing class-switched B cells to levels commensurate to those found in IAV-infected mice at 45 days following infection/vaccination.",

            "text": "To determine if the observed B cell responses generated IAV-specific antibodies, we quantified total IAV-specific IgG and IgA antibody following infection or vaccination. As expected, IAV-specific IgG responses were detected locally [i.e., bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)] and systemically (i.e., serum) in IAV-infected and IAV-nanovax vaccinated mice at 32 and 45 days following infection/vaccination (Figures 2A,B,D,E). Interestingly, serum levels of IAV-specific IgG antibodies were ~2\u20133x higher in animals after IAV-nanovax and IAV infection than in mice receiving IIV (Figures 2A,D). Mice receiving IIV also lacked robust IAV-specific IgG within the BAL as observed in IAV-nanovax and IAV infected mice (Figures 2B,E). This difference in measurable IAV-specific IgG within the BAL between IIV and IAV-nanovax is likely related to the lack of a local lung GC response in the IIV vaccinated mice (Figure 1). Previous studies have demonstrated that IgA is present in the BAL after IAV infection (36). Consistent with this idea we found that both IAV-infection and IAV-nanovax, but not IIV, induced IAV-specific IgA levels in the BAL (Figures 2C,F). To determine the potential of these IAV-specific antibodies to contribute to protection from lethal dose IAV infections, we measured the capability of serum and BAL antibodies to inhibit IAV-hemagglutination. At 32 and 45 days post infection/vaccination, both IIV and IAV-nanovax vaccinated mice had serum hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers that were similar to IAV infected mice and well above the >1:40 mark that is associated with protection against subsequent IAV infection (Figures 2G) (43). However, only IAV infected and IAV-nanovax vaccinated mice possessed protective levels of HAI antibodies within the BAL (Figure 2H). Altogether, these results suggest that i.n. administration of IAV-nanovax induces both local and systemic IAV-specific antibody responses capable of providing protection against IAV infection.",

            "text": "Generation of GC B cell responses and class-switched antibodies are often associated with antigen-specific CD4 T cell responses. It has also been shown that IAV-specific CD8 T cells are important for control of IAV. Therefore, we determined the capacity of IAV-nanovax to elicit IAV-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses within the lungs. The CD4 T cell response to IAV has been shown to encompass a large number of epitopes, each only being expressed at low frequency (44). Thus, in order to not bias the response by examining a single epitope specificity we utilized a surrogate marker staining strategy. This strategy identifies total antigen-experienced T cells (Figures 3A,B), including those where epitopes have not been identified or are limited (38, 39). Compared to na\u00efve mice, IAV infection and IAV-nanovax vaccination generated an increased frequency of antigen-experienced CD4 T cells (AgExp CD4; CD4posCD11ahiCD49dpos) and antigen-experienced CD8 T cells (AgExp CD8; CD8loCD11ahi) within the lungs at days 7, 32, and 45 (Figures 3A,B). We further observed that a vast majority of these AgExp CD4 and AgExp CD8 T cells were resident within the lung tissue (CD45i.v.Abneg) based on in vivo antibody labeling in IAV-nanovax vaccinated mice, similar to that observed following IAV-infection (Figures 3A,B). Importantly, these lung-resident AgExp CD4 and CD8 T cells in IAV-nanovax vaccinated mice were found in higher numbers compared to na\u00efve and IIV vaccinated mice at 7, 32, and 45 days post vaccination (Figures 3C\u2013H). Although numbers of lung-resident AgExp CD4 and CD8 T cells were higher early (day 7) in IAV-infected mice compared to IAV-nanovax mice (Figures 3C,F), IAV-nanovax was capable of inducing T cell responses of a similar magnitude to those observed in the IAV infected lung at later time points (Figures 3D,E,G,H)",

Therefore, we next determined whether the robust lung-resident AgExp CD4 and CD8 T cell responses generated by IAV-nanovax vaccination shared phenotypic characteristics with canonical lung-resident memory T cells (Trm). In the IAV-infected lung, the expression of CD69 was prominent in lung-resident (i.e., CD45i.v.Abneg) AgExp CD4 T cells at 32 and 45 days following IAV infection, a change that is associated with establishment of lung-resident memory cells (45) (Figure 4A). This trend was also observed in IAV-nanovax vaccinated mice; however, IAV-nanovax induced a greater fraction of canonical CD69pos AgExp CD4 Trm cells as well as a subset that co-expressed CD103 (Figures 4A,C). Nevertheless, both the CD69posCD103pos and CD69pos CD103neg lung-resident AgExp CD4 T cell subsets were elevated in IAV-nanovax, but not IIV vaccinated, mice to levels equal to or higher than those observed in IAV-infected mice (Figure 4C). In contrast to lung Trm CD4 T cells, lung Trm CD8 T cells have been reported to co-express CD69 and CD103 (46). By day 32 following IAV-infection or IAV-nanovax vaccination, the fraction and number of CD69posCD103pos AgExp CD8 T cells resident within the lungs were significantly increased relative to na\u00efve and IIV vaccinated mice (Figures 4B,D). Albeit the number of CD8 Trm were initially higher in IAV-infected mice, IAV-nanovax vaccinated mice exhibited similar CD8 Trm responses to IAV-infected mice by day 45 post infection/vaccination (Figure 4D). Overall, these data suggest that IAV-nanovax vaccination induces CD4 and CD8 Trm responses of similar magnitudes to IAV infection.",

Further, since IAV-nanovax induced pulmonary CD4 and CD8 T cell responses within the lungs by day 7 post vaccination (i.e., prior to the boost, Figure 3) we additionally compared protection after a prime only vs. a prime+boost vaccination schedule. Forty-five days after the initial vaccination, mice were challenged with a lethal dose of homologous IAV (A/Puerto Rico/8/34). As expected, na\u00efve mice displayed substantial disease associated weight-loss (>20%), mortality (60%), and respiratory distress, as measured by increases in airway resistance (~6 Penh); however, mice that received either prime only or prime+boost IAV-nanovax administration exhibited reduced signs of morbidity and were completely protected against mortality (Figures 5A\u2013C). This alleviation of disease is commensurate to IIV vaccinated mice as similar trends of reduced morbidity and mortality were also observed for IIV prime+boost vaccinated mice compared to na\u00efve (Supplemental Data Sheet 2A\u2013C). Strikingly, IAV-nanovax prime+boost mice exhibited little to no weight loss or increases in Penh demonstrating that this strategy provides more robust protection compared to prime only mice (Figures 5A,C). Consistent with this disease amelioration, the IAV-nanovax prime+boost mice had significantly reduced lung viral titers 3 days following challenge indicating early control of viral replication (Supplemental Data Sheet 3).",

To this end, prime only and prime+boost IAV-nanovax vaccinated mice were challenged with a lethal dose of a mouse-adapted heterologous strain of IAV (A/Hong Kong/68, H3N2). Early (days 1\u20135) following challenge, IAV-nanovax vaccinated mice showed similar levels of weight-loss but reduced respiratory distress (Penh) compared to na\u00efve mice (Figures 5D,F). Furthermore, while 100% of na\u00efve mice succumbed to the highly stringent IAV challenge, both prime only (40%) and prime+boost (80%) IAV-nanovax mice were protected from mortality (Figure 5E). Additionally, the protection mediated by IAV-nanovax appears durable as protection was still observed in mice challenged with homologous and heterologous virus at 100 days post vaccination (Figure 6). The ability to IAV-nanovax to confer protection against heterologous virus challenge is likely due to the local lung adaptive immune response induced by IAV-nanovax as IIV vaccinated mice, which lack lung Trm (Figure 4), had limited to no protection from a heterologous challenge (Supplemental Data Sheet 2D\u2013F). Furthermore, this protection appears to require adaptive immunity specific to influenza as mice vaccinated with polyanhydride particles that only contained CpG and no IAV protein (CpG Particles) showed no pulmonary B or T cell responses (Supplemental Data Sheet 4A\u2013D) and were not protected upon subsequent viral challenge (data not shown). Overall, these data suggest that IAV-nanovax induces a long-lived adaptive immune response that may confer significant protection against subsequent homologous and heterologous IAV exposures.",

Likewise, IAV-specific IgG antibody titers in the serum were similar. Finally, no differences were observed in the ability of the vaccine to confer protection against a subsequent lethal dose homologous IAV challenge when IAV-nanovax vaccines were administered with or without a free antigen component were compared.

Therefore, in order to determine if IAV-nanovax could likewise confer protection in outbred populations, we next i.n. vaccinated groups of outbred Swiss-Webster mice with IAV-nanovax. Groups of non-vaccinated mice were included as controls. These groups were then subsequently challenged on day 45 post vaccination with either lethal dose homologous (Figures 7A\u2013C) or heterologous (Figures 7D\u2013F) IAV. IAV-nanovax vaccination significantly reduced/ablated morbidity (weight loss, Figures 7A,D; Penh, Figures 7C,F) and protected from mortality (Figures 7B,E) upon subsequent challenges.

While the protection provided by IAV-nanovax was found to be more robust after a prime+boost strategy, the prime only vaccination substantially reduced morbidity (Figures 5A,C) and completely prevented mortality (Figure 5B) following a homologous IAV challenge. Likewise, the prime only vaccination reduced initial airway distress (Figure 5F) and provided a significant level of protection from mortality during a lethal-dose heterologous IAV challenge (Figure 5E). This protection against homologous and heterologous virus appears to be long lasting as IAV-nanovax vaccination also conferred protection in mice challenged at 100 days post vaccination (Figure 6). While the IAV-nanovax formulation tested herein contained only IAV HA and NP proteins, studies have demonstrated that immunity directed against additional IAV proteins such as NA and M1 can enhance protection (47, 48). One of the benefits of our nanovaccine platform is the ability to easily \u201cplug and play\u201d new antigens within the formulation. Therefore, by incorporating IAV NA and M1 protein within future IAV-nanovax formulations we may be able to drive even more robust immunity and further improve protection against homologous and heterologous IAV infections.",

However, at some time points we did observe reduced IAV-specific IgG in IAV-nanovax vaccinated mice compared to IAV infection (day 45 serum, day 32 BAL, Figures 2B,D). This reduction could be related to additional antigens available for targeting following IAV infection since IAV-nanovax only contains IAV HA and NP proteins. Consistent with this idea, HAI titers in the serum and BAL following IAV-nanovax were similar to those observed for an IAV infection and well above the 1:40 HAI titer associated with protection (43) suggesting that HA-specific antibodies are equal.",

These IAV-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells were within the lung parenchyma based on CD45 i.v.Ab exclusion staining (Figure 3) and expressed markers consistent with the canonical tissue-resident memory phenotypes. Lung-resident memory CD4 T cells are primarily identified by CD69 expression following infection or vaccination (45). While we observed CD69posCD103neg CD4 Trm subset within the lungs of IAV-nanovax vaccinated mice, we unexpectedly observed a small proportion of CD69posCD103pos CD4 T cells as well (Figures 4A,C). Although this CD4posCD69posCD103pos resident memory phenotype has not been well characterized, a study has reported this subset within the skin (49). What role these CD69posCD103pos CD4 T cells may play in protection against subsequent IAV infections remains to be determined.",

Preliminary studies also suggest that CD4 and CD8 Trm responses are present in the lungs out to at least day 100 (data not shown). Our prior studies have shown nanoparticles persist within the lungs for \u226514 days and the continual release of antigen from nanoparticles placed into other tissues \u226530 days following vaccination.
