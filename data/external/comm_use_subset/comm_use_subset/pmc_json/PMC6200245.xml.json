The classification of Papillomaviruses (PVs) has been based on L1 gene sequence. They are clinically divided into two groups: low-risk HPVs, like HPV 6 and 11, which cause benign lesions (warts and benign papillomas), and high-risk HPVs (hrHPVs), like HPV16 and 18, which are carcinogenic to humans [5\u20137]. The global ratio of all the malignant diseases attributable to HPV infection is estimated to be 5.2% [8\u201310]. Almost all the cervical carcinomas and a significant part of anogenital and oropharyngeal malignancies are associated with HPV infections [11].",

The early and late regions encode six early genes (E1, E2, E4, E5, E6, and E7) and two late genes (L1 and L2), respectively. Among these early proteins, E5, E6, and E7 play a pivotal role in the cell transformation. They can interfere in several cell cycle pathways, especially the alteration of EGFR signaling pathways [15, 16], degradation of p53 [17] and degradation of pRB [18], respectively. These effects result in triggering several cascade events, which cause cell transformation, immune evasion and cancer progression [6, 19\u201326]. E6 and E7 oncoproteins are known as Ideal targets for the immunotherapy of HPV-associated cancers [27\u201331] since they are consistently expressed in almost all cervical cancer cells, but not in healthy cells, and are essential for the generation and maintenance of malignancy. Additionally, E5, E6, and E7 oncoproteins are structurally different from human cell proteome. Therefore, their side effects on healthy tissues are expected to be negligible [8].",

Generally, the algorithms of these tools range from ones programmed to determine peptide- MHC molecule binding data to those based on structural similarity, molecular modeling, and molecular docking [57]. Peptides that bind to a specific MHC molecule have sequence similarity. Therefore, peptide sequence patterns have been used to predict their binding to MHC molecules [58]. In recent years, the accuracy of these methods has increased strikingly, and more than 90% of natural epitopes have been recognized at a high specificity of 98% [59]. This improvement in performance was achieved by the expanding experimental binding data, available in the immune epitope database (IEDB) and analysis resource (http://www.iedb.org/), and by the improvement of machine-learning algorithms [60].",

Ligand RMSD value shows the differentiation measure between cluster elements. As a guideline; RMSD < 3.0 \u00c5 means high accuracy; RMSD \u2265 3.0 and \u2264 5.5 \u00c5 means medium accuracy and RMSD > 5.5 \u00c5 means low accuracy [88].

The best model, which has the highest CD value, is not necessarily the top-ranked model, because, in some cases, peptides were not attached to their binding site properly. Thus, these malformed models were excluded from the analysis. It is important to note that, due to the different frequency of MHC alleles in human populations, the equal CD value of different MHC alleles, don\u2019t have equal value regarding population coverage. Thus, to involve the effect of population coverage, the CD value of every model was multiplied by its allele population coverage (divided by hundreds for more facility) to obtain a weighted index. Then, the sum of all HLA-I or II weighted indexes of each peptide was calculated to get a total docking score (TDS), used as a score to compare the candidate peptides. It is the first time that the TDS has been formulated and used for this purpose. This formula is also applicable to the similar docking scores obtained from other servers.",

Expression of E5 oncoprotein occurs in the early phase of HPV infection. Evidence indicates that E5 play a prominent role in the genesis of HPV-associated cancers, but is not essential for cancer progression [90], since when HPV genome integrates into the host genome, it usually results in the disruption of E1, E2, and E5 genes. Therefore, targeting E5 protein provides an opportunity for treatment of HPV infections and preventing the precancerous lesions from the progression to established carcinomas [20, 91]. Some genotypes of hrHPVs are more involved in the genesis of epithelial tissue malignancies [61].

            "text": "There are several limitations for epitope prediction: 1) The major drawback of peptide-based vaccines is low immunogenicity [92, 93]. Many studies have focused on enhancing immunogenicity using immune stimulating agents or adjuvants to avoid this problem. Another solution is the use of agonist epitopes [94]. Epitope immunogenicity is a crucial factor in vaccine development. However, many of known natural epitopes when are analyzed in silico by IEDB MHC-I immunogenicity predictor, do not obtain a high score. Therefore, in this study, epitope selection was based on the integrated approach, in which one analysis does not play an important role alone. 2) There are certain drawbacks associated with the function of each method invented for the MHC-peptide binding prediction [95]. For this reason, several predictors and a molecular docking program were used to augment the prediction accuracy. 3) Some web tools have been developed for MHC-II epitope prediction. Since MHC-II groove can bind to peptides with variable lengths, and different peptides have the different number of residues between their N-terminus and first anchor [54], the exact assignment of MHC-II core peptide would be a difficult problem which reduces the success rate of these prediction tools. Therefore, most MHC-II prediction tools did not usually make epitope predictions as accurately noted for MHC-I molecules [64, 96]. In cancer immunotherapy, the CTL-mediated responses play the central role in eradication of malignant cells, and the binding of epitopes to MHC-I molecules is an essential step for antigen presentation to CTLs. Thus, in this study, predicted epitopes were primarily selected by their MHC-I binding and processing scores. However, the MHC-II binding scores were actually of secondary importance to the epitope selection process as an extra advantage. Additionally, there are several other essential determinants which significantly affect the outcomes, such as antigen processing, immunogenicity, population coverage, conservancy and cross-reactivity with host antigens. Vaccine development requires a comprehensive approach to cover all these effectual elements, covered in this study.",

As a general rule, how much the length of the query peptide to be longer, there are more torsions and conformational flexibilities. Additionally, in comparison to Protein-Protein interactions, Protein-peptide dockings are more transient, and their binding affinities are notably weaker [88]. These factors make structural predictions of long peptides very challenging. Therefore, in this study, 9mer peptides were preferred for selection compared to other possible lengths. They are also preferred by all MHC-I molecules as epitope and by MHC-II molecules as the core peptide of epitopes. Moreover, expansion of 9 or 10mer CTL epitopes to longer peptides may create a practical alternative, containing both CD4+ HTL and CD8+ CTL epitopes; Especially, when CD4+ HTL epitopes, covering CTL epitopes, are not recognized [97].",

As well as, several clinical trials have been launched for immunotherapy of HPV-associated cancers [46], although, they have not been so immunogenic, to induce a sufficient cellular immunity and eradicate malignant cells completely. Some studies have suggested that the use of E6 and E7 SLPs, containing both CD4+ HTL and CD8+ CTL epitopes, led to more potency and durability of CD8+ T cell reactivity in vivo, in comparison with the minimal CTL epitopes [97, 105].",

            "text": "As far as we know, this is the first time that in a laborious in silico study for epitope prediction, E5, E6 and E7 oncoproteins of hrHPV16, 18, 31 and 45 have been investigated altogether. Moreover, in previous studies, usually only one predictor tool was used for making epitope prediction, or if several tools were used, no integrated approach was employed to make the conclusion. We believed that our predicted epitopes are valuable candidates for further in vitro and in vivo therapeutic vaccine studies. Additionally, the introduction of the ten epitopes for each HPV genotype oncoprotein in the first step of the study shows which region of each oncoprotein is rich of the epitope, and thus, is more suitable for use in the design of SLPs. Notably, the previous in vivo studies have been conducted using SLPs of hrHPV-E6 and/or\u2013E7 oncoproteins, in particular HPV16 oncoproteins [92, 129\u2013133]. Furthermore, the two-step plan of this in silico study, which each step includes several analyses to find proper epitopes by an integrated approach, would provide a basis for rational epitope prediction. However, it could be more efficient by adding other useful analyses. Further studies are recommended on the peptide binding assays, the design of polyepitope constructions including E5, E6 and E7 epitopes, the expansion of the minimal CTL epitopes to longer peptides (SLPs), the use of various adjuvants, involvement of delivery routes, mouse immunization with the designed constructs, evaluation of immune responses such as cytokines, antibodies, CTLs and tumor growth for finding the best construct for clinical trials. It is important that improper vaccine design and immunosuppressive microenvironment were known as the main reasons of the failure in cancer immunotherapy by therapeutic cancer vaccines [134].",
