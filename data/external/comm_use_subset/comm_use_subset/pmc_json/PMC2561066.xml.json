Immunity is believed to be a major factor in regulating host survival, as under natural conditions, even a mild parasitic infection may weaken an animal sufficiently to increase the chances of mortality through starvation or predation [1]. However, maintenance and up-regulation of the immune system requires energetic and nutritional resources [1], resulting in a trade-off between investment in immunity and other physiological processes, including growth and reproduction [2]\u2013[4]. An appreciation of the extent to which hosts invest in immunity is therefore critical to understanding the strategies through which animals maximise fitness, and how trade-offs are mediated between current offspring production, longevity and future reproductive success [3], [4].",

Both sexes can mate with multiple partners, and females are extremely promiscuous [14], [15]. Females can produce up to three litters of around seven offspring [10], [11], [16], with energy intake during lactation increasing to around three times the non-reproductive level [8].

The extent to which shrews are able to mount immune responses to these parasites is unknown: commons shrews have a fast metabolic rate even for their small body size [31] but store very little energy as fat [32]. Lack of resources may therefore limit the capacity of S. araneus to mount immunological responses, particularly as reproductive adults, and parasitism has been suggested as one of the causes of mortality of adults after breeding [12], [13], [18]. Common shrews possess a large lymphatic organ, known as the Pancreas of Aselli, which may function in defence against parasites, though its exact role is unknown, and remains the subject of discussion [33]\u2013[35]. To date, there have been no studies of spleen or bone marrow function in S. araneus.",

Instead, we predicted that wild shrews would demonstrate only limited responses to parasites, and that their immune system would show signs of deterioration with age. The aim of the study was therefore to evaluate the capacity of sub-adult and adult shrews to mount immunological responses. We examined and compared the structure, composition and function of relevant haemolymphatic tissues including the pancreas of Aselli, in wild-caught common shrews of different ages pre and post maturation, and the extent and type of inflammatory reactions produced in response to naturally occurring parasitic infections. Light and electron microscopy were applied in conjunction with immunohistological characterisation of leukocyte populations. Contrary to our predictions, our results indicated that shrews are capable of mounting immune/inflammatory responses throughout their entire life span. While some degree of lymphatic exhaustion was obvious in adult animals (perhaps as a result of age-related changes, or reduced investment in immunity as a consequence of breeding effort), there was also evidence of some degree of compensation, in the form of storage of plasma cells particularly in the pancreas of Aselli, possibly as a defence against previously encountered parasites.",

Shrews were classified into three age categories: 18 sub\u2013adults, showing no sign of sexual development (11 female, 7 male), 3 animals undergoing sexual maturation (2 female, 1 male) and 22 sexually mature animals (11 female and 11 male) caught during or after the breeding season. Adult females all exhibited signs of mating, pregnancy and/or lactation. All animals appeared healthy when captured, and were killed humanely by overdose of inhalation anaesthetic (Fluothane, Schering-Plough Animal Health, UK). Animals were inspected for ectoparasites (data not presented) before full necropsy was performed and body mass (minus gastrointestinal tract) recorded. Bladder and oesophagus were removed and dissected in Hanks saline (40\u00d7 magnification), with nematode and digenean parasites in both tissues counted and identified using keys [30]. Stomachs and guts were removed, weighed, stored in 10% formalin and later dissected in Hanks saline (40\u00d7 magnification). Recovered helminths were identified as nematodes, cestodes or digeneans [30] and counted.",

The aim of this study was therefore to clarify this matter with up-to-date methodology. In general, the composition of the pancreas of Aselli was very similar to that of a lymph node. Beneath the capsule were marginal sinuses of variable width, containing disseminated lymphocytes (mostly T and B cells in equal proportions), macrophages and neutrophils, the latter either disseminated or as small accumulations. In four adult shrews, the marginal sinuses exhibited focal to extensive fibrosis. Beneath the sinuses lay a cortex containing exclusively secondary follicles (Fig. 3A\u2013C), with the exception of one adult male where both primary and secondary follicles were present (Fig. 4). Germinal centres generally exhibited a high cellular turnover, with variable but high numbers of PCNA-positive, proliferating cells (often more than 50% of cells; Fig. 3E) and often numerous apoptotic cells (Fig. 3F). T cell zones formed a paracortex located immediately beneath the follicles (Fig. 3D) and were generally similar in size and cell density in animals of all age groups. The organ's centre (medulla) contained loosely arranged sinuses with only low numbers of macrophages. The remainder of the medulla was made up almost entirely of plasma cells (Fig. 3G, H).",

In common with a number of species, including the musk shrew Suncus murinus, both bone marrow and spleen were identified as sites of haematopoiesis in S. araneus\n[43]. The results of our study also confirm that the pancreas of Aselli, which is specific to shrews, can be considered as a large, specialised lymph node [33]. The presence of a cortex with both follicles and paracortical T cell zones renders previous controversial assumptions regarding the organ's function incorrect: the pancreas of Aselli is neither a specific site of exclusive B cell production nor a functional analogue of the bursa of Fabricius in birds [35]. However, it differs from normal lymph nodes in that the centre (medulla) contains a very high proportion of plasma cells. In adulthood, the number of plasma cells and the relative size of the medulla seem to increase, until almost the entire organ is composed of plasma cells. Such a feature has not been described under physiological circumstances in any other species, and suggests that the pancreas of Aselli in S. araneus functions as a storage site for plasma cells, particularly in older animals. Lymph nodes in S. araneus were also found to contain a higher number of plasma cells than normally observed in other species [39], [42], which may emphasise a general tendency towards progressive plasma cell storage in common shrews.",

This suggests sub-adults were responding effectively to a diverse array of infectious agents, including the helminth and protozoan parasites detected in a number of tissues. Post-reproductive animals, however, exhibited characteristics indicative of immune system exhaustion: follicles were generally smaller and were often depleted, with a smaller proportion of secondary follicles, particularly in the spleen. This could indicate decreased follicular activity in adult animals, with impaired germinal centre reactions resulting in reduced B cell production [44]. Impairment of germinal centre reactions is a known feature of immunosenescence in vertebrates and has been studied extensively: in humans it has been shown to be a product of defective T cell-dependent B cell activation [44], [45]. Reduced lymphocyte production as a consequence of follicular and T cell impairment could explain why significantly lower numbers of white blood cells, and specifically lymphocytes, have been reported in old common shrews [46].",

This zone is considered to be the site of most intensive blood filtration in the spleen [43], [47], and its loss of integrity/intensity in older animals may indicate a reduction in filtration capacity. This might however be counterbalanced by an increase in the capacity of the peripheral phagocytic response, as represented by an increase in neutrophil numbers within both the spleen (as observed here) and the peripheral blood [46].",

This concurs with similar findings in the musk shrew [43], where both the splenic red pulp and bone marrow have been identified as physiological sites of erythropoiesis, leukocytopoiesis and platelet production over the animal's lifespan. In this aspect, shrews are similar to some reptiles, whereas in other mammals the haematopoietic capacity of the spleen seems to cease after birth [43]. We also found evidence of haematopoiesis in the pancreas of Aselli in adult S. araneus, as demonstrated by the presence of megakaryocytes in the medulla of some individuals. Interestingly, we found no evidence of major thymic involution in S. araneus, even in older animals. The rate of thymic involution is known to vary between species and breeds and with intraspecific factors such as sex and diet [48], [49]. Perhaps in shrews thymic involution is delayed to maintain production of T cells into adulthood.",

            "text": "It has been suggested that short-lived species should limit their investment in immunity to immediate, innate responses, as the energetic costs associated with mounting specific immune reactions are unlikely to be outweighed by the benefits of increased long-term survival [1]. The dependence on innate responses may be greater for species with limited energetic reserves (such as S. araneus), as even a mild immune challenge is likely to result in starvation if allowed to persist for more than a short time [1]. Here, however, the presence of numerous active secondary follicles in the spleen and pancreas of Aselli, the development of small lymphatic follicles in portal areas in the liver and the generally high number of plasma cells in the pancreas of Aselli all indicate that common shrews remain consistently able to mount systemic, specific immune responses. We also observed macrophage-dominated (granulomatous) inflammatory reactions with lymphocyte involvement in both sub-adult and adult shrews, which included reactions to helminths in tissues. The increasing number of plasma cells in the medulla of the pancreas of Aselli and in lymph nodes with advancing age might even suggest a \u2018refocusing\u2019 of the immune system, from reacting to novel antigens in follicles as a young animal, to combating previously experienced parasites or pathogens with appropriate antibody responses as an adult. Plasma cells are long-lived and can survive for weeks after immunisation, particularly when not too tightly packed [50]; perhaps young common shrews invest in long term immunity by producing and storing plasma cells in the pancreas of Aselli, which can then be used to mount efficient responses against previously encountered parasites in adulthood, when reproduction places greater demands on internal resources [8]. While this strategy may allow older animals to react effectively to previously encountered parasites, infection by novel agents or eventual depletion of plasma cell reserves, could still be factors in the near-synchronous mortality of adult shrews observed shortly after the breeding season [12], [13], [18]\n",
