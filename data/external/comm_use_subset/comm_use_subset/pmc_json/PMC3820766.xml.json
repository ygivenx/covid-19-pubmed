CRP is able to activate complement and enhance phagocytosis to facilitate the removal of pathogenic microorganisms and injured, necrotic and apoptotic cells. Therefore, CRP is important in natural immunity (12,13). Originally, CRP was considered to be a nonspecific biomarker of inflammation; however, following ~10 years of investigation, it has been demonstrated that CRP participates in inflammation and atherosclerosis directly and has been indicated to be a prognostic factor and a risk factor (14). In this study, it was revealed that levels of the precursor of CRP were decreased in the patients with CHB and markedly increased in the patients with ACLF. Nearly identical changes were observed for the hemoglobin \u03b2 chain variant Hb S-Wake, which has been implicated in in orphan diseases (15), although not in liver diseases.",

            "text": "VN is another protein that commonly features in studies on liver disease. It is a multifunctional plasma glycoprotein produced by hepatocytes that is detectable in plasma and the extracellular matrix. Glycosylation of VN modulates multi-merization and collagen binding in liver regeneration (20) and alterations in VN glycosylation modulate substrate adhesion to rat hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which is responsible for matrix restructuring (21). Immunoblotting data identified increases in VN levels in cirrhotic livers, and VN immunoreactivity has been shown to be markedly increased in the cirrhotic liver matrix, irrespective of the apparent reduction in plasma VN. VN immunoreactivity in the liver may be considered to be a marker of fibrosis, particularly for chronic/mature fibrosis, paralleling previous observations concerning the enhanced orcein staining of cirrhotic septa (22). These results suggest that VN may be important in the progression of liver disease and/or in hepatic fibrosis through its collagen-binding domain I, and that VN levels are likely to be higher in patients with chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and liver cancer than in controls (20\u201323). In the present study, VN levels decreased in the progression of hepatitis B (from CHB to HBV-induced ACLF). The observation of decreased VN levels was consistent with two other studies (24,25). In one of these studies, it was demonstrated that, in chronic liver disease, the concentration of plasma VN was significantly lower than in healthy controls and was associated with the severity of liver disease. Notably, levels of VN in the liver tissue were significantly increased in patients with chronic liver disease compared with those in normal controls. These results suggested that VN was deposited in injured tissue during the repair process and functioned as an adhesive protein (24). In the other study, it was demonstrated that there were lower levels of plasma VN in chronic liver disease, which was possibly due to a decreased synthesis, deposition in injured tissues or a combination of the two (25). The same group of authors also revealed that decreased levels of plasma VN and fibronectin (FN) and increased levels of serum laminin (LM) P1 in patients with chronic liver diseases were associated with hepatic dysfunction, and that changes in the levels of the glycoproteins involved in cell attachment were significant in the development of hepatic fibrosis in patients with chronic liver diseases (25). Based on the accumulating information on VN and liver fibrosis, it appears that VN requires further study.",
