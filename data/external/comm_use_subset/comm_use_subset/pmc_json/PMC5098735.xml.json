S. aureus causes various suppurative diseases, food poisoning, pneumonia and sepsis [1, 2, 3]. Chemotherapeutic treatment is generally applied to S. aureus infectious diseases. However, the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) represents a serious problem for the treatment of S. aureus infections. Since most clinical MRSA strains exhibit a high level of multidrug resistance, the treatment of MRSA infections is now a serious medical concern worldwide [4, 5].",

For example, it has been shown that tannins from tea leaves or persimmon have antibacterial effects against Streptococcus mutans, S. aureus and Escherichia coli. [15, 16]. Polyphenols are thought to be less likely to induce the emergence of resistant strains than general antibiotics because the mode of action of polyphenols has been demonstrated to cause cytoplasmic membrane destabilization and/or permeabilization [11]. The side effects of these agents are also thought to be less severe than those of traditional antibiotics.",

This plant has been traditionally used as a medicinal agent due to its antibacterial, anti-viral, anti-inflammatory and calming effects [17\u201320]. Glycyrrhetinic acid is a major component in licorice extract. Previous studies have shown that glycyrrhetinic acid has many properties, including anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, anti-peptic ulcer, and anti-viral activities [21\u201325]. Its anti-inflammatory effect is particularly well known and has been applied to clinical therapy. It has been reported that the structure of glycyrrhetinic acid is similar to that of cortisone, a steroid hormone that exerts a strong anti-inflammatory effect [23]. In Japan, a preparation of monoammonium glycyrrhizinate (Stronger Neo-Minophagen C) is used to treat chronic hepatitis [26, 27]. Glycyrrhetinic acid has also been reported to have antibacterial effects against some bacterial species, but the mechanism underlying this activity remains unknown [28, 29]. Additionally, several derivatives of glycyrrhetinic acid exhibit anti-inflammatory activities, but their antibacterial activities have not been elucidated [30, 31, 32].",

Both GR-SU and GR-K have high water solubility, but the antibacterial effect of GR-K is much lower than that of GR-SU. Thus, difference in water solubility is not related to the difference in antibacterial activity among these compounds. Instead, some other structural differences between the two agents (Fig 1) may affect their antibacterial activities against S. aureus strains. GRA and GR-SU have been clinically used as anti-inflammatory agents [21, 32]. Taken together with our findings, GRA and GR-SU are expected to exert two biological activities of clinical importance: antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities.",

Glycyrrhetinic acid derivatives are known anti-inflammatory drugs [30, 31, 32]. Stronger Neo-Minophagen C, which is the most well-known glycyrrhetinic acid derivative drug, contains 2 mg/ml of monoammonium glycyrrhizinate hydrate at the dose used to clinically treat chronic hepatitis; this dose is approximately 4- to 20-fold higher than the concentration used in this study [26, 27].

As shown in the microarray analysis (Fig 4), the expression levels of many phage-related genes were increased by the addition of 1x MIC of GR-SU, and we speculated that the bactericidal effect of a high dose of GR-SU (2xMIC) was due to phage induction-mediated cell lysis.",

Moreover, the expression levels of many genes that encoded transporters were also decreased (S6 Table). These results suggest that GRA and GR-SU-treatments inhibit the uptake of nutrients, which then causes alterations in the expression of genes related to nutrient metabolism. Supporting this hypothesis, S. aureus MW2 required a higher concentration of sugars and amino acids in the presence of GRA and GR-SU than in the absence of these compounds (Table 4). Based on these findings, we propose that GRA and GR-SU have no specific mechanism for antibacterial activity but induce antimicrobial effects by inhibiting nutrient acquisition and affecting bacterial metabolism. Additionally, the expression of several transporters responsible for the efflux and/or influx of compounds was increased in the microarray analysis. The transporters with altered expression levels in the presence of either GRA or GR-SU included some transporters that might be involved in the high susceptibility to gentamicin in the presence of either GRA or GR-SU. GRA and GR-SU had weak synergistic activities with other protein synthesis inhibitors, speculating that transporters specific for gentamicin influx may be influenced by GRA and GR-SU.",

Because RNAIII is related to the agr quorum sensing system, RNAIII expression is growth dependent [35]. We found that GRA and GR-SU suppressed growth in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that RNAIII expression was inhibited. Then, we investigated the expression of several virulence factors in the presence or absence of GRA or GR-SU. As shown in Fig 6, the expression levels of toxins such as enterotoxins (seh and sea), staphylokinase (sak) and hlgC were decreased, whereas the expression levels of cell surface factors such as fnbA and ica were increased. From these results, we hypothesize that GRA and GR-SU can modulate virulence in addition to their antimicrobial effects on S. aureus.",
