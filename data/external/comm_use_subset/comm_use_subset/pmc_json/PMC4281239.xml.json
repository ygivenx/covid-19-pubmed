            "text": "Members of the Paramyxoviridae family are pleomorphic enveloped viruses [1] divided into two subfamilies, Paramyxovirinae and Pneumovirinae. Paramyxovirinae has recently been subdivided into seven genera: Aquaparamyxovirus, Avulavirus, Ferlavirus, Henipavirus, Morbillivirus, Respirovirus, and Rubulavirus (http://ictvonline.org/virusTaxonomy.asp?version=2012). Viruses of this family affect a wide range of animals, including primates, birds, carnivores, ungulates, snakes, cetaceans and humans, and cause a wide variety of infections, such as measles, mumps, pneumonia and encephalitis in humans, and distemper, peste des petits ruminants, Newcastle disease and respiratory tract infections in animals. However, several paramyxoviruses (PVs) have not been classified into any of these seven genera, including Nariva virus (NarPV) [2], Mossman virus (MosPV) [3], Beilong virus (BeiPV) [4], J virus (JPV) [5], [6], Tupaia paramyxovirus (TupPV) [7] and Tailam virus\n[8], all of which belong to a group of novel paramyxoviruses isolated from wild animals, as well as Salem virus isolated from horses [9]. Among them, only JPV has been shown to be pathogenic, causing extensive haemorrhagic lesions in rodents [6]. Horizontal transmission is the principal mode of intraspecies PV infection, suggesting that contaminated faeces, urine or saliva may be responsible for spillover to other species [10].",

A very broad diversity of paramyxoviruses, including Henipa-, Rubula-, Pneumo- and Morbilli-related viruses, have been detected in six of ten tested bat families [11].

Briefly, approximately 100 mg each of this animal's liver and spleen were pooled and crushed in 600 \u00b5l of cold PBS in a ball-mill tissue grinder (Genogrinder 2000, Spex Centripep). Total RNA was extracted using a Biorobot EZ1 and the EZ1 RNA tissue mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. The RNA was then tested for paramyxoviruses, using three heminested reverse transcription-PCR (hnRT-PCR) assays targeting the polymerase gene [17], and also for Marburg virus [18] and Zaire Ebola virus [19].

These bat species are known to live in close proximity. Thus, virus transmission between different bat species is possible [25].

Indeed, virus must not induce pathology to persist or adapt within its reservoir host. Many authors suggested that persistence in the absence of pathology or disease appears to be a common characteristic of bat viruses in their natural host population [28], [29]. However, a severe immunodepression for instance, may increase the risk of infection with opportunistic pathogens. Under some environmental conditions (cool environments for example), some avirulent pathogens, such as Geomyces destructans, causative agent of white-nose syndrome, may become pathogenic in hibernating bats in North America [30], [31]. Nevertheless, infection by BelPV may be mild for bats and thus the pathology observed not directly related. Otherwise, it may also be that this animal had an underlying disease or infection with a different pathogen. Even in this case, we might not draw any conclusions neither establish a link with lesions seen. Therefore, the pathogenicity of the BelPV should be demonstrated by experimental animal infection. Otherwise, viral antigens or RNAs should be detected histologically in the lesions of naturally-infected bats. However, the unavailability of biological tissues from the diseased bat failed to perform these analyzes. Consequently, other captures of Coleura afra species are considered in order to find BelPV again for further studies (pathogenicity to its host, isolation and complete genome characterization). However, Coleura afra is a migratory species living in colonies of several hundred individuals. In Gabon, this species, which has been recently described, is not present all year round in the caves of the north-east of the country, making the studies on this species difficult and thereof partly explaining the lack of virological studies.",

In general, humans are infected through an intermediate amplifying host such as palm civets for SARS-CoV, horses for Hendra virus and pigs for Nipah virus [38]. However, in humans Nipah virus outbreaks linked to bats exposure have been reported [39]. It remains to be shown whether the BelPV reported here presents a zoonotic risk. Nonetheless, like most RNA viruses, for example coronaviruses, characterized by high mutation and/or recombination rates [40], PVs may adapt to novel hosts, including humans. A serological test capable of detecting antibodies to this virus in human populations living in the vicinity of these animals is needed to assess zoonotic potential.",

However, BelPV transmission by blood-sucking vectors within the Gabonese population of C. afra cannot be ruled out. Indeed, a haemosporidian parasite (Polychromophilus) was found in a blood parasite vector (Penicillidia fulvida) in Faucon cave in Gabon in 1977 [42] and also in its host M. inflatus (greater long-fingered bat) from the same cave in 2010 and 2011 [43]. In addition, the methodology used to collect flying hematophagous insects (based on light traps) possibly introduced a bias by selecting only those attracted by light. Therefore, we can not exclude that additional sampling techniques could increase the number of mosquitoes species or groups known to colonize caves such as sandflies or biting midges. Hence, the natural mode of transmission of this unclassified paramyxovirus in bat populations, through bat-bat aggression for example, remains to be determined.",
