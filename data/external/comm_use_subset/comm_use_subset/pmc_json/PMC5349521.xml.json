At any point in time, the population consists of sick and healthy individuals. Healthy individuals are susceptible to contract the disease in the next time step if in contact with an infected individual. Disease contraction from a sick contact depends on the inherent infectivity of the disease denoted by \u03b2. Inherent infectivity level of a disease is reduced by the combined measures taken by the two individuals in contact. Protective measures taken by a healthy individual i, denoted by ai, ranges from 0 \u2013self-isolate\u2013 to 1 \u2013resuming normal activity. Similarly, preemptive measures taken by a sick individual j, denoted by aj, ranges from 0 \u2013self-isolate\u2013 to 1 \u2013resuming normal activity. Individual i contracts the disease from a sick individual j with probability \u03b2aiaj. That is, infection can only occur if neither the healthy nor the sick individual decides to self-isolate, i.e., ai > 0 and aj > 0. The set of contacts of each individual defines a contact network. Accordingly, we refer to the set of contacts of an individual as their neighbors. A healthy individual remains healthy in the next time step if the individual does not contract the disease from any of their sick neighbors. That is, disease transmission from one sick neighbor is enough to infect the individual. A sick individual heals with probability \u03b4 and becomes susceptible again. See Fig. 1 for an example of a contact network and one step propagation of the SIS Markov chain model.",

On the one hand, a healthy individual would like to avoid taking costly protective measures while minimizing their risk of infection. On the other hand, a sick individual would like to avoid taking costly preemptive measures while minimizing the chance of transmitting the disease to their healthy neighbors. We represent the tradeoffs of an individual by a payoff function which is a weighted combination of these preferences (see Equation (9) in the Methods). We represent the cost of measures by a socialization term that an individual maximizes when resuming normal activity. We weight this socialization term by a positive socialization constant c0. The risk of infection of a healthy individual, weighted by a positive risk averseness constant c1, increases with the number of sick neighbors that do not take any preemptive measures. The concern for disease transmission, weighted by a positive empathy constant c2, increases with the number of healthy neighbors who do not take any protective measures.",

In addition to the state of contact neighbors, a healthy individual\u2019s risk of infection or a sick individual\u2019s chance of disease transmission, and therefore, individual\u2019s payoff, depends on the actions of contact neighbors. For instance, a healthy individual is safe from the disease regardless of their own action if all of their sick neighbors self-isolate. That is, a healthy individual can avoid the disutility of protective measures by resuming normal activity if the individual knows their infected neighbors are taking preemptive measures to avoid disease spread. However, their sick neighbors also would like to avoid the disutility of these preemptive measures. Hence, this is a game amongst healthy and sick individuals of the population. In this game, at each stage individuals have to reason about the actions of their neighbors to make their own decisions.",

A Markov strategy is where individuals\u2019 actions depend only on the payoff relevant state of the disease. In addition, we assume individuals take actions considering their current payoffs only. This equilibrium concept, we term the myopic Markov perfect equilibrium (MMPE), is formally defined in the Methods section. An MMPE strategy profile at time t is such that no individual has a preferable unilateral deviation to another action that strictly increases the individual\u2019s current payoff. The assumption of myopic strategies implies that individuals do not weigh their future risks of infection or infecting other individuals in their current decision-making. This is a reasonable assumption considering the computational complexity of accounting for future states of the disease during an epidemic.",

We observe that in cases (a\u2013c) the equilibrium action is unique. When individuals have strong risk aversion and strong empathy in comparison to the socialization constant in (d), there are two alternative stage equilibria: 1) All healthy individuals resume normal activity and the sick individual self-isolates, and 2) the sick individual resumes normal activity and healthy individuals self-isolate. Both equilibrium strategies yield the same outcome of disease eradication\u2013each individual continues to take the same action until the center individual heals. However, the first equilibrium action profile yields an aggregate utility\u2014sum of individual payoffs\u2014of 3 while the second equilibrium action yields an aggregate utility of 1 yielding a ratio of 1/3. The ratio of the worst aggregate utility value attained by an equilibrium action profile to the optimal action profile that maximizes the aggregate utility is referred to as the price of anarchy in game theory34. In Supplementary Section B, we prove a lower bound for the price of anarchy that shows it can scale with 1/n. The set of utility constants in (d) shows that the bound is tight because the price of anarchy equals 1/(n \u2212 1) = 1/3.",

Starting at the state in Fig. 2 for utility constant values given by (b\u2013d), there is no chance of disease spread at an MMPE strategy profile. Therefore, the disease is eradicated when the center individual heals in continuation of the disease dynamics. However, if constant values are as given by Fig. 2(a), there is no guarantee that the disease is eradicated when the center individual heals. We show the continuation of the disease dynamics starting from the cases of (a) weak empathy & weak averseness and (b) strong empathy & weak averseness in Fig. 3. In case (a), the disease takes off after the first time step in the network before eradication at time t = 14. When empathy is strong in (b), disease is eradicated when the center node heals. We also observe that the larger aggregate utility does not always lead to a reduction in disease spread. For instance at time t = 2 in Fig. 3 (bottom), the aggregate utility is higher in the weak empathy case than in the strong empathy case. At the following time t = 3 the number of infected increases to 3 individuals for the weak empathy case. At time t = 3, the aggregate payoff remains higher than the strong empathy case with single infected individual. That is, a larger epidemic size can lead to a better aggregate utility when the empathy constant is different.",

When the empathy term is larger than the socialization constant, i.e., c2 > c0, the initial infected individual will self-isolate (ai = 0) even given a single social neighbor. Therefore, the bound above is most interesting when the empathy term is such that c0/n < c2 < c0. In this case, only the infected individuals with connections smaller than  can spread the disease to their neighbors initially. The degree distribution P(\u00b7) determines the frequency of individuals with number of neighbors less than . We note that all the susceptible individuals will socialize at normal levels initially if c0 > c1. Still, if the disease spreads to their neighbors, their rational actions can include self-isolation. In the derivation of the upper bound, we assume all susceptible neighbors of the initial infected individual resume normal activities. Hence the risk averseness constant c1 does not appear in the bound above. It is natural to think that high risk aversion may help reduce initial spread. Contrary to this intuition, when we explore the effects of c1 in the following sections, we find that the risk averseness cannot stop the initial spread without a critical level of the empathy constant.",

Hence, in the event that the initial individual infects a highly connected neighbor then the spread of the disease from a second infected individual can be fast. To account for this event, we consider the metric  which is defined as the average number of new infections by an initial infected individual when patient zero is selected randomly weighted by their connectivity degree. Consider a network with degree connectivity distribution P(k). The probability that we select an infected individual with degree k is given by . This selection process represents the likely scenario that one of the earliest infected individuals transmits the disease to a highly connected individual. We have the following upper bound for the metric given individuals acting according to an MMPE action profile (Supplementary Section E)",

Hence, accurate modeling of behavior has the potential to help with the prediction of disease\u2019s impact and with the assessment of policy measures. To this end, we considered a stochastic network game where individuals respond to the current risk of disease spread, and their responses together with the current state of the disease and the contact network structure stochastically determine the next stage of the disease. In particular the game is played among the healthy and the sick in an SIS infectious disease. In our scenario, the concern for disease contraction of a healthy individual increased with the number of sick contacts that are not taking any preemptive measures. Similarly, sick individuals had increased concerns for disease spread when there are more healthy contacts that do not take protective measures. This meant that the incentives for a healthy individual taking a measure decreased as more of individual\u2019s sick contacts took preemptive measures, e.g., staying at home. Similarly, the incentive for preemptive measures decreased for sick individuals as the healthy got more cautious. The consequences of these incentives are not trivial in a disease contact network setting where an individual cares about the behaviors of contacts who themselves care about their neighbors and so on.

Yet, for a positive level of empathy, there exists a risk averseness constant above which disease is likely to be eradicated. The intuition for these results is based two key observations. We first observe that before the disease can be eradicated, the number of sick has to become low in comparison to the number of healthy individuals. When the number of sick individuals is low, the healthy individuals need to have a high risk aversion constant for their risk averseness to matter. In contrast, even small values of the empathy constant by the sick individuals can cause behavior change when the number of healthy individuals in the population is relatively high. Second, we observe that self-isolation decisions of sick individuals guarantee the prevention of disease spread to all their neighbors, whereas self-isolation decisions of a healthy individual averts only a single potential infection.

The imbalance of roles played by the response of the infected versus the susceptible individuals in disease eradication affords critical policy insights. In particular, it suggests that public health recommendations should emphasize preventative practices when sick, e.g., covering cough, not going to work. It also highlights the importance of accounting for individual response in predictions of disease spread. It is worth noting that we can interpret the behavior response of infected individuals as altruism as termed and noted empirically926 since their worry is to refrain from infecting their neighbors.",

As a future research direction, it would be interesting to couple the decentralized individual reactions to disease prevalence with centralized policies such as public information, isolating individuals that are sick, or vaccination campaigns. Another potential direction could be to modify the benchmark assumption that individuals behave rationally. Analysis of the sensitivity of the results to deviations from the rationality is of interest but it is not trivial how these behavioral deviations would be modeled37. Finally, the present model considered an SIS disease spread. It would be interesting to extend this model by including exposed individuals who are suspected of being infectious and the behavioral responses of the exposed type. Despite its simplifications, the current model provides a principled approach to connect rational decision making with other complex dynamic disease models.
