            "text": "3D domain swapping is a unique protein structural phenomenon with implications in function, form and disease (Figure 1). Only two scenarios (domain swapped dimer and open-ended oligomeric swapping) of 3D domain swapping are provided in the figure. Other scenarios like double domain swapping, cyclic swapping and entirely swapped structures were observed in proteins with swapped oligomeric architecture. Protein structures involved in 3D domain swapping is characterized by hinge regions and swapped regions. 3D domain swapping is associated with mutual swapping of a structural segment between two or more chains in a protein oligomer. This mechanism was observed in a diverse group of proteins that mediate different structural, functional and physiological mechanisms. 3D domain swapping was primarily defined as a mechanism for functional or structural oligomeric assembly, recently defined as the molecular mechanism behind protein aggregation and thus implicated as a pathogenic basis of diseases like deposition diseases or conformational diseases [14], amyloidosis [15], serpinopathies [16] and proteinopathies [16]. Proteins involved in such diseases have higher aggregation propensities and involved in the formation of highly specific aggregates of a single protein. From a structural perspective, some of these aggregates were generated by 3D domain swapping mechanism [12-14,17-33]. From a clinical perspective, such diverse disease manifestations mediated by this single structural mechanism are of great interest. It still remains elusive whether 3D domain swapping is exclusively associated with such conformational diseases or they may also play a crucial role in mediating complex diseases.",

The mechanism of 3D domain swapping was reported in different evolutionary lineages and structures in swapped conformation were identified in multiple organisms with a large proportion characterized from eukaryotes. Hitherto, proteome-wide analysis of this unique structural mechanism was impossible due to the non-availability of proteome level curated dataset. Recently, we integrated in-depth literature curation and structural bioinformatics analytics to curate proteins involved in 3D domain swapping from Protein Data Bank (PDB) and reported a knowledgebase of proteins involved in 3D domain swapping [53]. 3DSwap offers a compendium of 293 protein structures with delineated hinge regions, swapped regions and offers an ideal resource to study functional and structural implications of domain swapping.",

            "text": "Enrichment analysis plays an important role in knowledge-based bioinformatics approaches [54,55]. In this study, enrichment analysis was performed using annotations derived from Pfam domains [56], GO [57-59], KEGG pathways [60] and Disease Ontology (DO) [61,62]. Enrichment analysis in bioinformatics is a collective term referring to a group of statistical bioinformatics algorithms developed to understand the global trends of a subset of genes or gene products compared to a background population (for example, all genes in the human genome and whole proteins encoded in the entire human genome or all genes tested in a given experiment or genes included in gene expression platforms etc.). Huang et al. [54] suggested a nomenclature to classify enrichment tools in bioinformatics as singular enrichment analysis (SEA), gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) [63] and modular enrichment analysis (MEA) [55]. Fundamental differences between these three classes of algorithms arise in the manner by which the enrichment P-value was calculated. In SEA-based approach, annotation terms of subset of genes were assessed one at a time against a list of background genes. An enrichment p-value was calculated by comparing the observed frequency of an annotation term with the frequency expected by chance and individual terms beyond the p-value cut-off (P-value \u2264 0.05). BiNGO [64], FunctAssociate [65], Onto-express [66,67] are examples of SEA-based enrichment analysis tools. GSEA approaches are similar, but consider all genes during the enrichment analysis, instead of a pre-defined threshold based genes, as in SEA approach. For example, Gene Ontology terms are connected by relationships and MEA based programs like Ontologizer [68] and topGO [69] employ the relationships that exist between the annotations. These programs were reported to attain better sensitivity and specificity due to the consideration of GO term relationships. GSEA is an enrichment-based computational method to determine whether an a priori defined set of genes show statistically significant differences, when compared between two biological states [63]. For example, a set of human genes differentially regulated in a gene expression of analysis for a particular type of cancer can be considered as a prior gene list, and the background can be defined one or more datasets compiled in Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) [70]. A variety of tools are currently available for the functional enrichment analysis, a recent review cited 69 tools for such analysis and the list of tools are rapidly growing. Majority of these tools employ statistical methods using Fisher's test [71,72], hypergeometric function [64], binomial test [72] or \u03c72 tests [73] or combination of such methods as implemented in tools like GFINDER [74] and Onto-Express [66,67] for significant association of the GO terms and the gene list with respect to the background distribution. Concept of gene set enrichment analysis was incorporated in to various programs that use biological or functional annotations of genes and gene products to perform biological enrichment calculations using ontologies and annotations. Gene Ontology enrichment and pathway enrichment analysis employ similar conceptual and statistical methods to understand functional and molecular roles of subset of genes or proteins were found to be very efficient in summarizing functional diversity or similarity trends. Such approaches are routinely employed in gene expression studies, high-throughput screening experiments and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) [75,76].",

Ontologizer was selected due to the improved statistical approximation methods incorporated in it. A brief description of the method is provided here. Generic GO enrichment tools calculate the enrichment of a GO term with respect to the list of genes in the dataset and the background population using the probability of drawing the same or higher number of genes annotated to a given term. This basic concept was implemented using statistical test involving the upper tail of the hypergeometric distribution or one-tailed Fisher's exact test. Such methods do not consider relationships between the annotation terms. GO is defined as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), with various levels of relationships between the terms. Due to DAG architecture of GO, a gene or gene product annotated with a term x is also annotated to all parent terms of x, and this often leads to false enrichment calculations. Such relationships (for example: is a, part of, has part, regulates) were taken into account in Ontologizer 2.0 using parent-child inheritance concepts [84]. Detailed description about the statistical method implemented in the Ontologizer 2.0 can be found elsewhere [68,84]. Dataset consisting of 45 Uniprot identifiers were used for species (Homo sapiens) specific GO enrichment analysis and pathway analysis. GO enrichment analysis was performed using the following parameters using Ontologizer 2.0: Gene Ontology annotations were derived from human-specific annotation data (gene_association.goa_human) [58], multiple testing correction was set to \"Bonferroni correction\" method, enrichment calculation was set to Parent-child-Intersection, re-sampling step was set to 1000. Gene Ontology was defined using 33,738 terms and 59,508 relations recorded in the gene_ontology.obo file (downloaded on February 2011) were used for the analysis. Background population for statistical tests was defined using 18,257 proteins encoded in the human genome with Gene Ontology annotations.",

DAG structure with highlighted GO terms in biological process (Additional file 1: Figure S1), cellular compartment (Figure 4) and molecular function (Additional file 1: Figure S2) categories are provided. Biological process contains several non-specific and specific GO terms that point towards functional understanding of the proteins involved in 3D domain swapping. Top \"Biological Process\" terms include viral reproduction and protein amino acid hydroxylation. Two cellular transport related terms under \"Cellular Component\" category (membrane raft and trans-Golgi network), along with cytoplasm and cell periphery, were also found to be associated with human proteins involved in 3D domain swapping. Enriched molecular function terms indicate that human proteins involved 3D domain swapping is involved in multiple signaling and binding activities including chromatin binding, protein kinase activity and protein dimerization activity. This also indicates specific role of proteins involved in swapping and its association with mechanisms like oligomerization, macromolecular crowding and aggregation which are considered to be cellular mechanisms implicated by 3D domain swapping. GO term enrichment analysis provided a cursory view of biological processes, cellular components and molecular functions associated with 3D domain swapping.",

According to this hierarchy, human pathways were classified into six categories (Metabolism, Genetic Information Processing, Cellular Processes, Organismal Systems and Human diseases). Current analysis reveals that proteins with 3Dswap conformations are present in all six classes, but significantly enriched KEGG pathways were observed in all classes except the Genetic Information Processing. Proteins involved in 3D domain swapping are observed in multiple subcategories of KEGG pathway hierarchy (see Figure 5). KEGG pathway analysis indicated that proteins in the swapped conformation are statistically significant in four subclasses of human disease class viz. Cancers, Immune System Diseases, Infectious Diseases and Neurodegenerative Diseases.

            "text": "Since KEGG pathways represent biochemical pathways and disease pathways in a single framework, a further detailed analysis of human proteins in swapped conformation was performed using a dedicated ontology that defines human diseases. Functional disease ontology annotation tool that uses Disease Ontology-derived \"Disease Ontology-lite\" and GeneRIFs were used in this analysis due to the brevity of the terms and availability of significant gene-disease association data. Enrichment analysis using disease ontology provided a detailed overview of the statistically significant association between gene-products in the swapped conformation with various disease categories. Using the current subset of data, five major classes of diseases were observed in the disease Ontology-based enrichment analysis as follows: cancer (prostate cancer, thyroid cancer, breast cancer and neoplasm metastasis), diseases of the respiratory or pulmonary system (asthma, bronchial hyperreactivity, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis), degenerative diseases of the central nervous system (Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's Disease), vascular disease (atherosclerosis, hypertension) and encephalitis (rabies). Neurodegenerative diseases are well-known to have strong association with 3D domain swapping, but insights into other diseases indicates that there could be more proteins with disease association and 3D domain swapping, beyond the currently well-known group of conformational diseases. Detailed table with Disease Ontology term (disease), genes associated with each disease and P-value for the association is provided in Table 6. Five of the significantly enriched diseases in the dataset and the genes associated with the diseases are provided as a network (Figure 6). Network is defined using genes as nodes and disease shared between the genes are considered as common edge between two genes. Disease ontology is useful to map disease relationships across human genes and diseases. To expand this disease association to clinically relevant information, we curated the disease ontology terms associated with 3D domain swapping to derive the associated International Classification of Diseases - 9 (ICD-9) codes. Diseases under the following ICD-9 codes 001-139 (infectious and parasitic diseases), 140-239: (neoplasms), 320-359 (diseases of the nervous system), 390-459: diseases of the circulatory system, 460-519 (diseases of the respiratory system). This further helped to understand major classes of clinically relevant disease phenotypes mediated by a unique molecular mechanism.",

We performed a knowledge-based analysis of human proteins involved in 3D domain swapping to find the key functions, pathways and diseases associated with 3D domain swapping. Our study was limited to 45 unique proteins involved in 3D domain swapping. 3D domain swapping is a functionally relevant phenomenon due to its primary role in protein oligomerization; proteins with swapped oligomeric states are being identified on a regular basis using crystallography experiments. Effective algorithms that can predict swapping from structural and sequence information may also help to identify more proteins in swapped confirmation. As more proteins are being characterized in swapped conformation, performing such knowledge-based analysis using new proteins, improved annotations and enhanced ontologies may reveal additional functional classes, pathways and disease. In summary, we showed results from an initial investigation to understand conserved protein domains, functional repertoire, pathways and diseases mediated by 3D domain swapping in human proteome.",
