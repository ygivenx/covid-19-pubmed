Upon providing written consent, participants were asked to complete a short, self-administered questionnaire and to provide a serum specimen for determination of antibodies to SARS-CoV. Questionnaires were translated into Vietnamese and responses were back-translated into English. Information was collected regarding the participant's contact with the index patient during his stay in the hospital from February 26th (evening) to March 5th, as well as their symptoms from the time the index patient was admitted to the hospital until 10 days after he was transferred (~1.5 incubation periods [3-5]). Self-reported symptoms were checked against case investigation forms for 42 staff members. Participants were asked about whether they had ever engaged in a series of activities relating to exposure to the index patient. Questions were simplified in order to minimize translation errors, ensure that the activities would apply for multiple different staff job categories (e.g., nurse and security guard), and to facilitate self-administration.",

SARS Co-V infections resulting from exposure to the index patient were presumed to have resulted in antibody conversion on or before March 24th (18 days after the index patient's discharge) based on a conservative estimated timeline that includes a 6 day incubation period plus a 12 day interval to seroconversion. The estimated 6 day incubation period is based on the observed median number of days from exposure to illness onset among persons in Vietnam who reported only a single potential exposure to a SARS patient (n = 28). The 12 day estimated interval to seroconversion is based on the observed median number of days from illness onset to SARS-CoV antibody seroconversion among cases in Vietnam for whom the date of seroconversion is known within 48 hours (n = 17). This time frame is expected to exclude individuals who contracted infection from someone other than the index, while capturing the majority of individuals who were infected during index case's hospitalization in Hanoi, including a proportion of those who could have been infected on the last day of exposure to the index patient.

The potential benefits of enhanced infection control practices and barrier protections are also in evidence when looking at differences among workers at Hospital A who provided direct patient care. Among nurses at Hospital A, those who administered clinical care to critically ill or post-operative patients (Op.Rm./ICU nurses) experienced the lowest attack rates among all nursing categories, and though few (3 of 8) reported having engaged in any of the activities identified as being associated with risk for SARS-CoV infection (Table 3), it is possible that the lower overall attack rate for this group of nurses reflects the fact that routine infection control precautions employed by Op.Rm./ICU to protect vulnerable patients in the ICU also provided these nurses with protection against exposure to SARS-CoV. Studies from other SARS outbreaks have shown that nurses charged with providing intensive care to patients experienced relatively fewer instances of SARS-CoV infection [5], unless assisting with a high risk procedure such as an endotrachael intubation [12,13].",

In addition, because of the need to minimize the complexity of the questionnaire, we were unable to assess either the duration, or the intensity of potential exposures, both of which are likely to be important modifiers of absolute risk. However, our streamlined approach using generalized questions allowed us to rapidly survey a large fraction of the hospital worker population, rather than just medical professionals. Finally, there were several potential sources of bias in this study which could have affected our results and conclusions. Although we performed the study prior to closure of the hospital, while the staff were still actively engaged in the outbreak investigation, we failed to achieve full staff participation, particularly among physicians and certain categories of nurses. This could have introduced a selection bias favoring enrollment of persons with less opportunity for direct contact with the index patient. Similarly, we questioned individuals about their exposure to the index patient 13 days after he was transferred to Hong Kong, and used a proxy to complete exposure questionnaires for deceased individual. Either of these could have introduced non-systematic information (recall) bias to our findings. We attempted to minimize the influence of these potential sources of bias by using case investigation forms and physician notes to verify self-reported information when ever possible.",
