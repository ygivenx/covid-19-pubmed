With increasing availability of different types of data (e.g. geographical data, time, genetic sequence), each adding their own dimension, and quantities of data rising, transmission-cluster identification of infectious diseases progressively relies on automated algorithms. A transmission cluster can be defined as several cases of an infectious disease which are connected by transmission of this disease from one person to another. A transmission chain is then defined as a series of cases connected by transmission events. Much work has been done on developing algorithms to identify transmission clusters of cases using large datasets [1]. Existing algorithms focus on cluster identification in time [2-9], in space or space-time [10-12], in genetics [13-15], or by combining all three data dimensions [16-18].",

If an algorithm lacks specificity, it finds clusters of cases even though there are no transmission events that link them. If it lacks sensitivity, the algorithm does not find genuine transmission chains. To be on the safe side, most algorithms have a high sensitivity at the expense of specificity and as a result also identify clusters of cases that are not genuine transmission clusters. We therefore propose cluster detection using algorithms as a two-step process: (i) detecting possible clusters of infectious diseases with an algorithm and (ii) assessing the plausibility that an identified cluster represents a transmission cluster.",

Currently, identified clusters are usually assessed by epidemiologists who assess information and verify it through communicating with the municipal health services (MHS). This can be quite labour intensive, especially if there are many identified clusters stretching across multiple regions. Only recently, a study has been published that introduced a framework for computing epidemiological concordance of microbial subtyping data of Campylobacter jejuni [19]. Epidemiological cluster cohesion is based on time, geographical location, and environmental source distances with adjustable weights. This method requires the computation of a disease specific source distance matrix, making it difficult to apply generically. To our knowledge no further tools are available for careful plausibility assessment of automatically detected clusters.",

We propose to assess the variation of clusters in their time, geographical location and genetic profile. The variation on these dimensions can be visualised by projecting cases on an epidemic curve, map, and phylogenetic tree, respectively, as well as by estimating the relative distance between clustered cases on these respective dimensions and comparing the distance to the inter-case distances from non-clustered cases. It is assumed that clustered cases will have smaller inter-case distances on these respective dimensions than non-clustered cases. However, there are exceptions: an outbreak may show large variation in time between the occurrence of cases (single persistent source, e.g. typhoid [20]), large variation in geographical distances between cases (initial cases travel large distances, e.g. severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [21]), or include large genetic sequence variation in the pathogen causing the outbreak (fast mutating strains, e.g. Ebola [22,23]). In order to settle several of these exceptions, intra-cluster correlation between the data dimensions time, geographical location and genetics can be used as another discriminatory characteristic. In genuine transmission clusters, variation on one dimension tends to be correlated with the other dimension. For example, with tuberculosis, cases within a genuine transmission cluster with a larger genetic distance, also tend to have a larger distance in time [24].",

As visualisation techniques support fast processing of large amounts of information, developing tools for visually assessing the plausibility of transmission clusters identified through statistical algorithms may help outbreak investigators [25]. Moreover if data are available in a timely fashion, this may allow pointing outbreak investigators to the most plausible signals first, which, when time is scarce, may facilitate task prioritisation. Finally, outbreak information, such as what is obtained with various available tools (e.g. typical cluster size, typical inter-case distance and correlate estimates between dimensions for a specific disease), might contribute to our current understanding of transmission model parameters [26,27].",

In the Netherlands, mumps is a notifiable disease and symptomatic cases are reported to the MHS by physicians and/or laboratories. Cases are either notified when there is a laboratory confirmation or when there is an established epidemiological link with a confirmed case. In case of laboratory confirmation, the national reference laboratory aims to obtain material from regional laboratories for further sequencing.

The relative distances (dissimilarities) for each dimension are calculated, and the combined dissimilarity (dcombi) between every pair of cases is then defined as the product of the separate dimension dissimilarities. Next, the cases are joined to form a hierarchical tree of related cases, based on dcombi, using single-linkage clustering.

For each of the two clusters nested within cluster 4 in the hierarchical tree, cases are located on two branches of the phylogenetic tree, suggesting that also the nested clusters contain substantial genetic disparity.

While the first step in cluster detection, which identifies possible transmission clusters, can be done by algorithms, as it is a very generic process, the second step needs disease-specific considerations which cannot easily be incorporated in an algorithm. For example, in the case study our tools show that cluster 4 (pink) and cluster 5 (orange) span across multiple branches of the phylogenetic tree.

First, mumps notification does not require laboratory confirmation in the Netherlands, but can also be based on the presence of an epidemiological link to a confirmed case. For these cases no material is available for testing and sequencing. Second, the obtained material is not always suitable for typing; viral loads can be low, which often result in failed sequencing. Third, we specifically chose to include only cases with an available sequenced sample of the SH, HN and F gene. Instead we could also have included cases with a sequenced sample of the SH gene only, as this would have resulted in a higher number of included cases. Nevertheless an earlier study [33] showed that the SH gene alone did not provide sufficient resolution for finding transmission clusters, whereas the combination of the three genes did. Since we aim to find transmission clusters here, including only sequenced samples of the SH gene was not an option. Because of these reasons, it is highly likely that the identified clusters in this study are actually larger or that some clusters are completely missed by the algorithm, as only one or two cases of a cluster might have a laboratory confirmation. This might explain the clusters reported by the NEWC (report 4, 7, 10 and 11), which were not identified by our tool (Table 1).",

            "text": "Our approach can handle incomplete data, such as cases with missing sequences, by performing a partial data analysis as in Supplement S2. Complete data analysis is shown in the main text. Further work can focus on extending the algorithm to allow for missing data on one or more dimensions. Especially considering that genetics information will often be missing if sequences are not available, one could replace sequence information by a categorical variable with pathogen subtype or other lower resolution indication of the pathogen type. Cases with a similar pathogen (sub)type would then have a distance of zero vs a distance of > 0 to cases with another (sub)type. The (sub)type information, however, should still have sufficient resolution to be able to contribute to transmission cluster detection. Similarly, if geographical location information is not available on the latitude/longitude level, one can think of lower resolution solutions. In this study, we use the centroids of the four digit postal codes as geographical location information. The information should have sufficient resolution to be informative. The tool is not limited by the number or type of dimensions. The addition or reduction of dimensions only requires small adaptions in our code and it is therefore straightforward to use our tools in combination with other algorithms, for example, space-time algorithms [10]. By increasing or decreasing the number of dimensions in the algorithm, the relative weight of the included dimensions decreases or increases as well, respectively. Depending on the quality of the data from the additional or removed sources, this may not be desirable. We have specifically chosen not to put weights on the separate dimensions, as determining the size of the weights is a very arbitrary decision. Instead, in the current study, we would rather interpret a cluster, which was primarily identified on the geographical location dimension, as less plausible, as the geographical location data are considered quite unreliable for mumps in the Netherlands. Indeed, information on place of residence (geographical location) is of questionable accuracy as mumps mainly occur among students who often have more than one living address (near the university and their parents\u2019 address). It is then often not clear if the students actually live on the reported address at the time of the outbreak. On the other hand, if we would have had reliable geographical location information, other or more clusters might have been identified that now go undetected. Similarly, for mumps it is very unlikely that a transmission cluster is spread across multiple branches in the phylogenetic tree, so for mumps the genetic dimension might have more relevance than e.g. the geographical one. Instead of putting a weight on this dimension however, we considered cluster 4 and 5 as less plausible. Further work could investigate ways of determining the size of the weights, based either on the quality of the data (as discussed here) or on the type and transmission routes of the disease under investigation. A final issue regarding the internal correlation plots is that they are more useful when cluster sizes are larger. If the algorithm detects very small clusters (n < 4), we suggest to rely on the other tools to determine whether an identified cluster is plausible.",

Timely availability of data are a prerequisite for this. In addition, using visual tools allow for fast and efficient information processing, which facilitates work. Mumps serves as an example in this study, but the algorithm can be transferred to other human-to-human transmissible diseases. ",
