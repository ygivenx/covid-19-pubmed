Big Data analytics is \u201cthe process of collecting, organising and analysing large data sets, to discover patterns and generate useful, actionable information\u201d (Garattini et al. 2017). There are risks and benefits associated with Big Data analytics (Davis and Patterson 2012), but little public understanding of what they are, what they depend on and how, if at all, individuals can influence their use. We often assume that data are anonymous, because they do not contain primary identifiers, such as our name or unique (e.g. social security or healthcare) number. Or we are told they have been de-identified, by removal of primary identifiers and other personal data such as address or date of birth. However, experts agree that data de-identification is, at best, provisional because of the plethora of other \u201canonymous\u201d data and metadata that can be linked, to re-identify individuals (Lubarsky 2017). Even the most sensitive personal data that banks, government agencies, healthcare providers or insurance companies assure us are secure can be accidentally \u201clost\u201d, deliberately leaked, sold or hacked, with loss of privacy, identity or funds (Tanner 2017).",

Wherever such systems have been proposed, there are unresolved controversies about privacy, effects on doctor/patient relationships and trust, whether individuals can opt out, who controls or can have access to data and when consent is required, how to protect data from unauthorised use or accidental loss (Fairweather and Rogerson 2001), and use of \u201cde-identified\u201d data for ethically approved research.

The risks and potential consequences of misuse are likely to be minimal, if optimal technical standards are applied, but there is often little publicly available information on which to base an informed judgement. Nevertheless, universal EHRs could provide substantial benefits for patient safety and health resource allocation. In the following sections, we argue that linking EHRs to person-specific pathogen genomic data (and/or that of relevant nonhuman animal or environmental pathogens) would enhance the timeliness, precision and effectiveness of public health responses to infectious diseases emergencies.",

Many countries still do not comply with the IHR, but WHO has increased their efforts to encourage and support implementation, especially in low- and middle-income countries. In most high-income countries, communicable disease surveillance has been in operation for decades and credited with rapid detection of novel disease incursions, such as Hendra virus in Brisbane, 1994 (Selvey et al. 1995), and West Nile virus in New York, 1999 (Sejvar 2003), and national monitoring of pandemic influenza 2009 (NSW Public Health Network 2009) as well as outbreak control.

This will allow appropriate antimicrobial therapy for a bacterial or fungal infection, to be started much sooner than is currently possible or avoided altogether, if a viral infection is identified. Either way, outcomes will be better, with fewer drug side effects, improved antimicrobial stewardship, less AMR and less frequent pathogen transmission. There are still major barriers to routine culture-based WGS or culture-independent metagenomics, but decreasing costs, faster sequencing, the potential to identify virulence or AMR markers and polymicrobial infections and/or to predict outbreaks with a single assay, make them attractive options for clinical microbiology (Forbes et al. 2017; Gardy and Loman 2018).",

The accuracy and reliability of different types of data, and the methods used to analyse them, are highly variable, e.g. references to \u201cflu\u201d, on Facebook, \u201cflu-like illness\u201d in an experienced GP\u2019s case notes or \u201cinfluenza A virus identified\u201d in a laboratory report could apply to the same, or to very different, conditions. The limitations of novel surveillance systems were illustrated by the demise of Google Flu Trends, which was based on Google searches related to \u201cflu\u201d or symptoms or behaviours interpreted as likely to be due to flu. It was predicted, but ultimately failed, to identify the onset of seasonal influenza 2 weeks in advance of conventional surveillance (Ginsberg et al. 2009; Lazer et al. 2014). Its failure was attributed to the lack of transparency of methods, over-fitting of data and failure to account for changing search behaviours (Lazer and Kennedy 2015).",

Should it be subject to a similar degree of privacy protection as that of her personal (human) genome?Given the public benefits (accuracy, reliability, sensitivity, specificity, timeliness) of using as many and varied types of data as possible, in communicable disease surveillance, outbreak investigation and research, should the use of de-identified personal data from EHRs (which may include personal and/or pathogen genomic data) be permitted, and in what circumstances? Do individuals have a moral obligation to participate? Should individual consent be required and if so in what circumstances?What level of probability and reliability, based on Big Data analytics, should be required before issuing a public alert about an impending infectious disease emergency\u2014e.g. due to a previously unknown emerging or highly virulent, transmissible or drug-resistant pathogen\u2014considering the need to balance the risks of delay against those of a false alarm? (Would a 30% risk of a dangerous infectious disease emergency be morally equivalent to a 30% risk of a category 4 tropical cyclone, for example?)What would be an ethical response to information, based on reliable Big Data analytics that some populations are at increased risk of infection and/or of becoming a risk to others? Considering the risk of stigmatisation, discrimination, loss of autonomy (e.g. mandatory testing) and/or restriction of liberty (e.g. quarantine), who should be told (the affected group; health professionals; the general public)?",
