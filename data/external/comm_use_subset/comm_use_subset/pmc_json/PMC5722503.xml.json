            "text": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a beta herpesvirus that has infected 40% - 100% of the adult population worldwide [1]. Most infections are mild or even asymptomatic and occur in childhood. A primary infection is followed by life-long latency and persistence, mainly in myeloid lineage cells from where it can be reactivated [2, 3]. HCMV infects and replicates in a wide variety of cell types, including macrophages, dendritic cells, epithelial cells of glands and mucosal tissues, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, hepatocytes and vascular endothelial cells [4], and hence all bodily fluids and organs can transmit the virus. While HCMV is not considered to be pathogenic in healthy individuals with a normal immune system, the virus can cause life-threatening disease in immunocompromised patients such as organ and stem cell transplant patients and AIDS patients. Indeed, although ganciclovir has been available for treatment and prevention of HCMV infections for almost three decades, this virus still causes concerning morbidity and mortality in stem cell and organ transplant patients and in AIDS patients. It is also an important human pathogen to cause congenital infection with considerable risk of birth defects. Emerging evidence also suggests that HCMV is highly prevalent in breast, colon, and prostate cancer, rhabdomyosarcoma, hepatocellular cancer, salivary gland tumors, neuroblastoma and brain tumors (medulloblastoma and glioblastoma) [5-12]. This virus is not considered to be oncogenic per se, but rather promotes oncomodulatory functions leading to more aggressive cancer phenotypes and may thereby promote tumor progression. In such scenario, control of HCMV infections may affect the patients\u2019 prognosis. In support of this statement, anti-viral treatment of patients with HCMV positive glioblastoma tumors indicate highly improved patient survival rates [13].",

Instead, the vast majority of proteins aid the virus to interfere with cellular and immunological functions to enable it to coexist with its host [16].

            "text": "Many viruses including HCMV can specifically target the nucleolus to facilitate viral transcription and translation. The nucleolus is a membrane less nuclear organelle that assembles ribosomal subunits in eukaryotic cells [18, 19]. The ribosomal assembly process is triggered by activation of RNA polymerase I (Pol I)-mediated transcription and is regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner in mammalian cells [20]. Mammalian cells contain several hundred copies of tandemly repeated rRNA genes (rDNA), which are transcribed in the nucleoli with high efficiency to meet the cell\u2019s demand for ribosomes and protein synthesis. The Pol I transcription machinery consists of three main components: the Pol I enzyme, the TBP (TATA-binding protein) - TAF (TBP-associated factor) complex SL1 (selectivity factor 1) /TIF-IB (transcription initiation factor-IB) and the transactivator protein UBF (upstream binding factor) (reviewed in [21-23]). During tumorigenesis, the tightly regulated relationship between extracellular signalling and ribosome biosynthesis is disrupted, and cancer cells begin the excessive production of ribosomes necessary for the protein synthesis associated with uncontrolled cancer growth. rRNA is a major component of the ribosome and, as such, carcinogenesis requires an increase in its synthesis [24-26]. The CMV IE72 and pp65 proteins localize to the nucleoli during early infection, co-localize with the nucleolar protein fibrillarin and directly interact with nucleolin [27]. It has been proposed that HCMV induces rRNA synthesis and UBF transcription, as the nucleoli are enlarged in infected cells and change morphology. Upon specific inhibition of rRNA synthesis, both IE72 and pp65 exit the nucleolus resulting in a strong inhibition of HCMV infection [28-29]. HCMV also impacts the function of Rb, p53 and Myc, which would be predicted to interact with the Pol I machinery. However, despite such intriguing links, the effect of HCMV on rRNA transcription and the virus potential ability to utilize Pol I for its own transcription remains to be investigated.",

Pol I inhibition was successfully achieved in two ways: using siRNA against Pol I or by treating cells with the specific Pol I inhibitor CX-5461 (a compound in clinical trials for oncology [30]) or low dose Actinomycin D (ActD).

The cells were thereafter infected with HCMV (MOI 1). At 48 hours post infection (hpi), cells were collected and stained for IE and pp65 proteins. We found that both IE and pp65 protein expression were significantly lower in cells with reduced Pol I activity (Figure 1A and 1B). The strongest inhibition of IE protein expression was observed in ActD treated cells (5 nM). Reduced IE72 and pp65 protein expression was also observed by WB analysis in CX-5461 as well as in GCV treated cells at 72hpi (Figure 1C and 1D). However, IE86 protein expression was not affected at this time point by CX-5461 treatment and ActD treatment did not reduce CMV IE or pp65 protein expression levels as assessed by WB analysis at this time point (Figure 1D). ActD treated cells exhibited strongly reduced UBF staining, while only a mild effect on UBF staining was observed in CX-5461 treated cells (Figure 1A), which imply that these compounds have different effects on rRNA production in the nucleolus.",

At this time point Pol I inhibition had no effect on IE transcript levels. At 48hpi, CX-5461 also significantly reduced 47S transcript levels, HCMV IE, pp65 but not gB transcript levels (Figure 2A). ActD however, only reduced IE transcripts, but did not affect pp65 or gB transcripts. At this time point the transcript levels of 47S were significantly reduced in both CX-5461 and ActD treated cells.",

It was recently suggested that CX-5461 induces p53-independent cell cycle checkpoints mediated by ATM/ATR signalling in the absence of DNA damage [31]. To further assess a specific role of Pol I in early transcription of IE genes, we utilized siRNA to reduce Pol I function. siRNA to Pol I significantly reduced 47S transcript levels at 48 hours post treatment and infection, but not at 6 and 24 hours (Figure 3A). This could be explained by recent observations that knocking down Pol I by greater than 90% after 48 hours of siRNA transfection only reduced 47S rRNA precursor levels by 25% and 50% compared with control at 12 hours and 48 hours of transfection, respectively [31]. At 48hpi, when 47S transcript levels were low, the IE transcript levels were also significantly reduced (Figure 3A). siRNA to Pol I reduced IE protein levels already at 24hpi and maintained significantly lower levels of IE protein expression at 72hpi (Figure 3B). By WB analyses, we only observed significantly reduced IE protein levels at 24hpi with siRNA to Pol I (Figure 3C and 3D). There was no effect by siRNA to Pol I on IE72 or IE86 protein levels at 72hpi by WB (Figure 3C and 3D). siRNA to Pol III did not affect IE72 or IE86 protein levels at either of these time points (Figure 3C and 3D).",

            "text": "The results were unexpected as it has been demonstrated that Pol II is the main RNA Polymerase for HCMV IE transcription. \u03b1-Amanitin is known to inhibit RNA Pol II and III without affecting Pol I activity at concentrations below 100\u03bcg. Pol-II is highly sensitive to 1-5\u00b5g/ml \u03b1-amanitin and Pol-III is sensitive to 10\u00b5g/ml \u03b1-amanitin. To assess the contribution of Pol II and Pol III activity on early transcription of HCMV, fibroblasts were treated with \u03b1-amanitin in low (1\u03bc\u039c) or high (10\u03bc\u039c) concentrations, or with CX-5461 (1\u03bc\u039c) with or without a combination \u03b1-amanitin (1\u03bc\u039c) and then infected with HCMV. Cells were collected at 6h, 24h, 48h and HCMV IE transcript levels were analysed by TaqMan PCR. We found that both low and high concentrations of \u03b1-amanitin almost completely blocked IE transcription (Supplementary Figure 1A). In these experiments, CX-5461 treatment only trended to reduce IE transcript levels at these time points, but the effect was not statistically significant (Supplementary Figure 1A). Low concentration of \u03b1-amanitin also reduced IE protein levels by WB, both in the presence or absence of CX-5461 (Supplementary Figure 1B). CX-5461 treatment did not affect IE protein expression at 72hpi by WB, which is expected as Pol II should act at this time point (Supplementary Figure 1B). As it is well known that Pol I activity fluctuates with the cell cycle, we suspected that the variability of the effect of CX-5461-treatment observed in our present experiments may be dependent on the stage of cell cycle transition. To further address this possibility, we performed a new set of experiments on cells synchronized in G0 by serum starvation and released into the cell cycle by addition of serum-containing medium. We found that under such conditions, CX-5461 treatment significantly inhibited IE transcript levels at all time points investigated (Figure 4), but less pronounced at 24 hours post infection. When analysing the cell cycle status at the indicated time points, there was no major difference between CX-5461 treated and non-treated cells at 6h (most of the cells were in G1), but we observed a shift of more cells in G2/M at 24 hours in CX-5461 treated non-infected cells (mean 7,7% in G2/M phase in non-synchronised/non-treated/uninfected cells versus 23% in CX-5461 treated/non-infected/non-synchronised cells, Supplementary Figure 2). These observations extend published data on the ability of CX-5461 to arrest cells in G2/M phase (31). In synchronised cells, we observed a distinct pattern: at 6h the drug drives more cells to the G2/M phase (16.4% versus 5.7%). In infected cells, we observed that more cells trended to be in G1 phase both in non-synchronised/CX-5461 treated and synchronised/CX-5461 treated cells at 6h and 24h as compared to 48h, where we observed a trend for increased proportion of cells in S/G2/M phases in infected/synchronised and CX-5461 treated cells. These observations suggest that the infection delays the CX-5461 mediated accumulation of cells in S/G2/M phases (see comparison of CX-5461 treated/non-infected and CX-treated HCMV infected cells (R3+R4)). Taken together, these results imply that HCMV engages Pol I for transcription only during certain phases of the cell cycle, a phenomenon that deserves further studies.",

To assess whether the reduced levels of IE transcription and IE protein production mediated by compromised Pol I function also affected virus production, we assessed production of extracellular virus in CX-5461 or GCV treated HCMV infected cells (VR1814 MOI 1). Virus containing supernatants were collected from HCMV infected fibroblasts treated with CX-5461 or GCV at 7 and 10 dpi, transferred to new fibroblast cultures and assessed three days later for HCMV IE positive cells as a measurement of viable virus in the supernatant. CX-5461 treatment resulted in reduced virus production at 7 but not 10 dpi (Figure 6). As expected, GCV completely blocked virus, production at both 7 and 10 dpi (Figure 6).

            "text": "Replication of HCMV is strictly controlled and the virus utilizes host cell factors for its own survival. Earlier studies have demonstrated that HCMV utilizes RNA Pol II to transcribe viral genes and produce viral mRNAs [33]. Previous studies have also shown that HCMV can specifically target the nucleolus to facilitate viral transcription and translation by mechanisms that are not well understood. As Pol I is the specific active polymerase in the nucleolus, and inhibition of rRNA synthesis results in exit of HCMV IE72 and pp65 from the nucleolus and a strong inhibition of HCMV infection [28], we hypothesized that Pol I may play a role in early viral transcription. Consistent with such hypothesis here we found that depletion of Pol I with siRNA or chemical inhibition of Pol I resulted in significantly decreased IE and pp65 mRNA and protein levels in human fibroblasts. Notably, these effects were cell-type dependent, as analogous inhibition of Pol I did not alter transcription of early HCMV genes in human endothelial cells. Furthermore, the reduced IE transcription and protein production that was seen in fibroblasts upon Pol I inhibition appeared to be cell cycle dependent. The reduced IE protein levels observed upon Pol I inhibition in the early phase of infection delayed virus production but this was compensated for at later stages of the HCMV replication cycle and did not significantly affect virus production in fibroblasts when examined at day 10 post infection. Analogous to the scenario seen in fibroblasts infected with HCMV Pol I inhibition also reduced transcription of another Herpes virus - HSV-1, in human fibroblasts. In contrast, inhibition of Pol I failed to affect MCMV transcription tested in murine fibroblasts. Taken together, these observations suggest that the utilization of Pol I by HCMV is cell type dependent and that Pol II produces viral mRNA during virus replication.",

            "text": "Pol I transcription of ribosomal rRNA genes is confined to the nucleolus. While most of the proteins in the nucleolus are dedicated to rRNA transcription, bioinformatic analyses of the nucleolar proteome have suggested that many nucleolar resident proteins also affect mRNA maturation, chromatin structure, cell cycle control, DNA replication and repair mechanisms [34]. The nucleolus may also regulate the activity of tumor suppressors and proto-oncogenes. Since the transcriptional activity of rRNA will be rate limiting for cells under high demand for rapid growth and proliferation, it is not surprising that the Pol I machinery is targeted by many viruses including HCMV and HSV-1 to exploit its efficient transcription for their own benefit. The nucleolus plays an important role in replication of both DNA and RNA viruses [35-40], and it is also exploited by viruses to take control over the cell cycle [35, 41-46]. From the viral perspective, the role of the nucleolus in cell cycle control [19, 47] and ribosomal biogenesis is of special interest for HCMV. The HCMV protein pp65 is rapidly localised to the nucleolus after virus entry [27]. It is delivered by the virus particle and is proposed to play an important role in the early events of HCMV transcription and for the development of a lytic infection [27, 29]. During the G1 phase, rRNA synthesis and ribosomal assembly increases to meet the demands on synthesis of S phase proteins. This is regulated by nucleolar proteins, which can phosphorylate transcription factors that will interact with Pol I [28, 48-49]. Pp65 has a kinase activity [50], and may be able to phosphorylate nucleolar proteins to facilitate this process. Nucleolar accumulation of pp65 is prominent in G1 and G1/S, but very low in S or G2/M phases of the cell cycle [51]. HCMV needs to arrest in G1 phase before replication can be initiated and incoming pp65 may play a role in initiation of this process. The virus may exploit Pol I and Pol II differently in different cell types, and particularly in cells in which HCMV will establish latency in.",

            "text": "Pol II is, apart from being used for production of host and viral mRNAs, highly active during G1 phase and is expected to regulate the expression of host and possibly viral miRNAs. miRUL112-1 is an HCMV encoded miRNA that regulates IE expression by interacting with the IE72 RNA to reduce IE protein production. Premature expression of miRUL112-1 has been shown to decrease HCMV replication [52]. Expression of IE72 is also known to be reduced at late times of infection, which can be mediated by mirUL112-1 that is highly accumulated at late infection [53]. Induced overexpression of IE72 during acute infection also results in reduced production of virus [54]. Thus, it may be essential for HCMV to decrease IE72 expression to maintain a high replication rate. However, the role of miRUL112-1 may be different in cells in which the virus will establish latency. HCMV establishes latency in myeloid lineage cells. HCMV that enters these cells may utilize Pol I in G2/S/M phases to produce IE72 and IE86 proteins. HCMV IE86 is known to induce G1 arrest that is necessary for initiation of DNA replication [29, 55], and this may explain the high utilization of Pol II for viral mRNA production as Pol II is highly active in G1 phase. If Pol II produces miRUL112-1 that inhibits IE72 protein translation, it will result in reduced IE72 mediated activation of late gene transcription. This is expected to facilitate establishment of latency rather than promoting active virus replication. Future studies addressing these aspects would be highly interesting to further understand the molecular mechanisms regulating establishment of HCMV latency.",

These properties are useful for its anti-cancer effects that are currently under evaluation in clinical trials. We observed variable results on inhibition of IE transcripts by CX-5461 during the cell cycle. Depending on when treatment is initiated during the cell cycle, it may have different effects on the outcome of HCMV transcription. As CX-5461 treatment involves an effect on p53 and downstream apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and senescence, it is possible that this compound arrested cells in G2 phase, and that this also negatively influenced HCMV replication. It is also possible that the effect we observed by Pol I inhibition on HCMV transcription is affected by CX-5461s effects on other factors that interact with the Pol I machinery; i.e. Rb, p53 or Myc. Thereby Pol I could act indirectly to inhibit HCMV transcription. However, since similar results of reduced IE transcription and protein production were obtained following Pol I knockdown using siRNA, we favor a viral mechanism involving Pol I directly. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that inhibition of Pol I affects HCMV transcription. Pol I inhibitors are presently evaluated in clinical oncology trials. Whether or not Pol I inhibition would be useful as an anti-viral strategy in CMV positive cancer forms should be interesting to evaluate further, as this virus does not replicate well in cancer cells but express IE proteins.",
