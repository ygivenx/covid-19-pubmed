            "text": "CMV is the most common infectious cause of mental disability in newborns in developed countries [1]. Detection of CMV antibodies is effective for systematic screening for CMV infection [2]. For instance, the CMV immunoglobulin G (IgG) avidity assay can help to distinguish primary from non-primary human CMV infections [3\u20135]. The key immune methods used for CMV antibody detection are: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [6], Elecsys [7], electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) [8], immunofluorescence assay (IFA) [9], flow cytometry (FCM) [10] and immunoblots [11]. Additionally, new immune methods for CMV antibody detection have been developed, such as the chemiluminesent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) [12] and protein microarrays [13, 14]. However, these methods suffer from inherent limitations, such as length of testing time, the needs for expensive equipment, specialist skills, low sensitivity, and complicated sample preparation processes. For example, conventional ELISA is still the main diagnostic test for CMV, and commercial CMV ELISA Kits are available. Although ELISA is often used as a comparison method for CMV antibody detection [13], obvious shortcomings include the need of tracer label, plate washing, the indirect format of detection, and the length of time necessary for testing. Thus, a rapid, simple, direct, and high-throughput method for CMV antibody detection is urgently needed.",

Compared to the methods above, the advantages of BIE are evident, e.g., high-throughput multiplexed analysis and quantitative, label-free rapid testing. Previous applications of BIE mainly focus on the biomedical fields [17,18], such as high-throughput disease diagnosis of hepatitis B virus (HBV) marker [19,20], the detection of avian influenza virus (AIV) [21] and antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) detection [22]. Thus, the biosensor technology offers important tools for disease diagnosis. As such, new applications have recently been developed, including those for the analysis of the interaction between tropomyosin allergens and antibodies [23], and the interaction between soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor (SNARE) proteins [24]. To date, however, BIE has not been applied for the detection of CMV antibody, particularly for the identification of the CMV IgG and IgM antibodies.",

            "text": "Imaging ellipsometry is a display technique for ultrathin film and surface characterization [27], which is used to read and analyze the protein arrays made by microfluidic systems. The incident wave of polarized light irradiates the sample as a probe beam and is thereby modified resulting in a reflective or transmission beam having the ability to carry sample information, such as protein layer thickness. When imaging ellipsometry is used to detect layer thickness, the reflection intensity is represented in grayscale, and the variation in layer thickness leads to changes in the grayscale value. If the refractive index is invariant, the grayscale value is directly proportional to the thickness of the protein layer within the range of 0~30 nm layer thickness, i.e., I = kd, where I is the light intensity and d is the layer thickness [28]. Under these conditions k is a constant and can be determined from a protein layer with known grayscale values and known thickness [29]. There is also a relationship between surface concentration and film thickness: surface concentration (\u03bcg/cm2)\u2248K\u00d7d, where K = 0.12 [27]. Thus, the grayscale value directly reflects layer thickness and surface concentration. The higher the grayscale value, the thicker the layer and the higher the surface concentration.",

A piece of silicon wafer was placed on the microfluidic mold of the microfluidic system so that surfaces of the wafers were patterned to form small, regular cells in an array format. Then, the carboxyl groups were activated by pumping 10 \u03bcL of NE into each cell at a flow rate of 5 \u03bcL/min and passed through the surface of the wafer. In the presence of NHS, EDC transfers carboxyl groups to the Sulfo-NHS ester, which reacts with the amino groups of proteins to immobilize the proteins on surface. Next, the ligand was immobilized: CMV-3A as ligand or probe was pumped into each cell (10 \u03bcL per cell at 1 \u03bcL/min). Third, blocking occurred by pumping the blocking reagent into each cell (50 \u03bcL per cell at 1 \u03bcL/min) and passing it through each ligand area. Thus, a sensing array surface with CMV-3A was formed to catch CMV antibodies. Fourth, targets were detected. PBST was used as blank control (50 \u03bcL per cell at 1 \u03bcL/min) and purified CMV antibody as a positive control (50 \u03bcL per cell at 1 \u03bcL/min) by pumping them into several of the individual cells. Simultaneously, patient serum samples were also pumped into remaining cells (50 \u03bcL per cell at 1 \u03bcL/min). The CMV antibodies in the serum were captured when they interacted with the CMV-3A on the sensing surface. All cells were rinsed with PBST (20 \u03bcL per cell at 20 \u03bcL/min) between every two consecutive operation steps. Finally, the microarray wafers were removed from the microfluidic system. After being rinsed with deionized water and dried with nitrogen, the wafers were analyzed using imaging ellipsometry. If the CMV antibodies in the solution or serum interacted with the CMV-3A on the surface and formed a complex, the layer in that area became thicker. The experimental results were recorded as images in grayscale, and binding of CMV antibodies resulted in a significant increase in grayscale value.",

However, the identification of antibody types may help to determine the course of disease, and BIE may be used as a clinical primary screening tool for CMV patients. IgM is produced in large amounts early in infection (reaching a peak in the first month), and is followed by IgG production [7,31]. Levels of IgM decline in the months following the onset of infection, whereas IgG levels persist for the rest of the patient\u2019s life [32,33]. Determining IgG avidity can provide additional guidance on infection status, and low avidity IgG is initially present but increases over time [34]. A positive result for IgM combined with low-to-moderate IgG suggests avidity a primary CMV infection within the past 3 to 4 months [35]. The visualized BIE image (Fig 2) could reflect types via difference in brightness, so this technology can achieve rapid screening. To date, our work is simply a demonstration for IgG type antibody detection with BIE.

The reference range for detection of CMV antibodies has previously been published. For example, Elecsys (Roche Diagnostics) immunoassays have an equivocal range (0.5\u20131.0 IU/mL) of CMV IgG [12]. In our experiment, ELISA as a control method had a reference range of 0.4\u20130.6 IU/mL.

Samples from these patients displayed stronger signal using ELISA than BIE. In ELISAs, anti-CMV IgG molecules are detected by the addition of polyclonal specific anti-H-IgG antibodies labelled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP). In contrast, the BIE biosensor directly identified the variation of the surface anti-CMV IgG concentration after capturing target without a secondary label. Thus, this label-free method may avoid some interference factor. In addition, the grayscale images offered uniform areas, helping to avoid false positive signals. When the correlation coefficient (r-value) and P-value were calculated after excluding the number of severe mutations (940, 956, 964, and 984), r-value = 0.93 and P = 0.8 the statistical results showed more agreement between ELISA and BIE.",
