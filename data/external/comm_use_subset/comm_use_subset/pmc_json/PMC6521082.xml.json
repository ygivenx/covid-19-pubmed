Bats are exceptionally speciose, comprising 20% of all mammalian species, and they are the only mammals that are capable of true flight [1]. Most bat species are gregarious and roost in large colonies, which can number over one million individuals [2]. They are relatively long-lived for their body size, and temperate species often undergo torpor or hibernation [3]. Bats also act as rich reservoirs of virus diversity with at least 23 families of viruses detected, including double-stranded DNA viruses, single-stranded DNA viruses, and positive- and negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses [4]. Bats are incriminated as the source of several medically important virus families, including filoviruses, coronaviruses, paramyxoviruses, and reoviruses [5,6]. Several recent zoonotic spillover events and outbreaks directly or indirectly originated from bats [1].",

These viruses have the largest genome of any single-stranded RNA viruses that infect vertebrates, and they are capable of recombining to create new strains. They infect a wide variety of mammals and birds, including infectious bronchitis virus in birds and transmissible gastroenteritis virus in pigs [7]. In humans, seasonal coronaviruses can cause both upper and lower respiratory tract infections, with increased disease severity in the elderly, children, and immunocompromised patients [8]. The zoonotic SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak originated in southern China from horseshoe bats, where wet markets permitted atypical contact between species, including subsequent spillover to humans [9]. Recent work showed that all genetic components of SARS-CoV co-circulate among different bat species sharing the same cave, underlying the opportunity for its re-emergence [10]. On the other hand, camels are the putative natural reservoir for MERS-coronavirus, although recent phylogenetic analysis indicated that bats harbor coronaviruses that are ancestral to the MERS-CoV lineage [11]. More recently, an HKU2-CoV outbreak caused by transmission from bats to pigs in China killed nearly 25,000 piglets [12].",

This large dataset was manually aligned and further down-sampled to 248 sequences to reduce redundant and similar sequences.

The Alpha-CoV genus comprises a large number of coronaviruses from diverse hosts, including bats, shrews, dogs, cats, ferrets, pigs, and humans. In Kazakhstan bats, the new CoV sequences were found to be segregated into two different groups. The majority (11 sequences) of the Kazakhstan CoVs formed a strongly monophyletic single clade (bootstrap (BS) = 95%), referred to here as \u201cKZ3\u201d, with the nucleotide sequence identities ranging from 94.7% to 100%. The KZ3 clade was a sister group to three bat CoV sequences from Spain (Miniopterus schreibersii and Myotis blythii) and China (Myotis ricketti). Within the KZ3 clade, two smaller co-circulating lineages (KZ-3a and KZ-3b) were formed that are also strongly monophyletic (BS = 82% and 98%, respectively). The KZ-3b sub-lineage contained seven bat sequences (RIBSP-7, 1, 13, 18, 62, 65, and 66) with 100% nucleotide similarity; however, the samples were collected from two different sites. Bat KZ-3b sequences (RIBSP-7, 11, 13, and 18) were collected from the Qaraungir cave, whereas bat KZ-3b sequences (RIBSP-62, 65, and 66) were collected from the Altyntau cave. This suggests the Kazakhstan bats residing in two different caves appear to harbor highly similar CoV strains.",

The RIBSP-43 sequence is most closely related with Pipistrellus pipistrellus CoV (nucleotide identity: 88.1%) described from France in 2014. These sequences in turn grouped with diverse bat species from broad geographical regions including Spain (Nyctalus lasiopterus and Myotis myotis), China (Pipistrellus pipistrellus), and South Africa (Neoromicia cf capensis). Taken together, our results indicate that Kazakhstan bats may harbor a wider diversity of Alpha CoV, possibly by means of the regional and intercontinental spread of the virus. Although the pooled feces prevented attribution to a singular species, the two lineages of Alpha CoV may be derived from the different species of bats, Myotis blythii and Hypsugo savii. KZ3 is similar to Myotis coronavirus sequences, while the KZ43 is most similar to a Pipistrellus sequence and H. savii is a pipistrelle bat. Our approach was opportunistic sampling in three sites, and the total sample size was 200, limiting the conclusions we can make about bat-borne coronaviruses in central Asia; however, this study provides a baseline for future studies.",

            "text": "Intense coronavirus surveillance is ongoing in China since the SARS-CoV outbreak, and it was demonstrated that co-roosting can maintain all strains with the necessary components to make SARS [10]. There is a paucity of bat-borne virus surveillance efforts across central Asia, even though this region is one of the largest grassland biomes in the world. This area is also of interest because it is where the Eurasian and Asian bat populations may be panmictic, as seen in other bat species with large distributions [21,22]. The range of M. blythii and H. savii is extensive, with both species found from China and northern India through to Spain, and these populations may be co-roosting at multiple sites due to the paucity of roosting areas in the steppe [23,24] (Figure 3). Myotis blythii is considered an occasional migrant, with movement of greater than 450 km recorded. The migratory behavior of Hypsugo savii is not known [25]. The potential panmixia and co-roosting of these bat species may lead to a similar mixing of viruses. These results provide a foundation to study bat-borne coronaviruses in Kazakhstan and highlight the need for collaborative efforts in understudied countries to increase integrated surveillance capabilities toward better monitoring and detection of infectious diseases.",
