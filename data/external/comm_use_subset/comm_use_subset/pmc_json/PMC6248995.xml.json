In particular, air travel has allowed human hosts or carriers of pathogens to move long distances within the incubation period of infections [5], such as the viruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), H1N1, Ebola, Zika, and yellow fever [6\u201311], or the parasites that cause malaria [12\u201314]. Regarding to the continual growth of international tourist arrivals, from 25 million in 1950 to 1.2 billion in 2015 [15], understanding the global dynamics of infectious disease has become a major 21st-century challenge, and mechanistic or mathematical models built with air-transportation data been widely used to measure risks of arriving infected humans, growth rate of an introduced epidemic and the impact of specific surveillance and control strategies [2, 6, 16, 17].",

However, most previous modelling studies have only focused on some of these components, and the seasonal and inter-annual risks of international spread of infectious diseases have rarely been quantified [6, 16, 19\u201322]. Moreover, the relative exposure risk and importation probability in travelers are likely to differ between local residents in endemic regions and residents of non-endemic areas traveling to endemic countries [21, 23, 24].",

However, dengue remains a seasonal disease in China, with epidemics occasionally triggered by imported dengue viruses (DENV) [27]. More than 90% of imported cases between 2005 and 2014 originated from SEA [27\u201331]. Following China\u2019s economic boom in the last two decades, the number of Chinese citizens travelling abroad has increased from 5 million in 1996 to 128 million in 2015 [32]. Recent government led initiatives to further foster international trade may contribute to increased flows between SEA and China [33], which could also increase the number of importations of pathogens including DENV.",

As international travel between SEA and China by airplane is fast and common, based on the assumption that human mobility via commercial air travel is an important conduit for the spread of infectious diseases internationally, we constructed a branching process model by focusing on the seasonal and multiannual movement of DENV from the endemic countries in SEA into China via air travelers of Chinese and SEA residents between 2005 and 2015. We then retrospectively quantified and validated the seasonal risks, ranging from zero to certain (1), of DENV importation from nine SEA countries and leading to autochthonous transmission (introduced transmission) in China, identified geographic and seasonal patterns of emerging origin-destination routes, and estimated the number of imported infections in Chinese travelers and SEA residents into China. With rising concerns about global pathogen dispersal, this study provides approaches and evidence that can inform efforts to mitigate the spread of DENV and other arboviral pathogens including Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever viruses from endemic regions.",

Furthermore, based on the Poisson distribution of DENV importation risk, we derived the expected monthly number of imported infections via air travel, and the Granger causality test [41] was used to examine the performance of estimated time series for predicting the reported time series.",

We have identified the emerging origins in SEA and locations in China that are most susceptible to dengue importation and onward transmission, and we also revealed the seasonal patterns and increasing risks in routes of DENV spread by air travel over a decade. The spatiotemporal heterogeneities of DENV importation risk have also been seen in the travelers of Chinese and SEA residents. The risk of introduced transmission from particular routes identified can be used to inform efforts to prevent and control the spread of DENV, and are particularly important for currently neglected, high-risk locations, i.e. Chengdu, Wuhan and Hangzhou. Moreover, with the increasing risk of dengue importation and transmission from SEA, China can also be the source of exportation, and this was amply shown in the introduction of dengue from Guangzhou into Japan resulting in a small outbreak in Tokyo [43].",

However, the rapid growth of travel abroad for tourism, business and migrant workers from cities in central and southwest China is also sufficient to cause substantial risk of importation. A similar pattern has been described for malaria importation from Africa and SEA into these areas [45]. The increase in imported DENV from SEA has also increased subsequent transmission risk in China, with Guangdong, Yunnan and Fujian provinces frequently reporting outbreaks following dengue importation throughout the last decade. Meanwhile, other provinces (e.g. Henan, Shandong and Shanghai) have reported autochthonous cases of dengue for the first time [27, 46]. The increasing importation risk, together with increasing temperatures and the spatial spread of Ae. aegypti [47], are all contribute to increased risk of introduced transmission and the potential for year-round autochthonous transmission of DENV and other flaviviruses in several tropical and subtropical regions of China (e.g. Hainan, Guangdong and Yunnan). The variation in DENV serotypes introduced from different origins over time is especially relevant considering the potential for adverse effects from dengue haemorrhagic fever after infection with a different serotype of DENV [27].",

Therefore, our findings must be considered in the context of several assumptions and data limitations. First, the quality of incidence data on dengue incidence in SEA and China likely varies due to differences in surveillance systems including case definitions, reporting methods, availability of healthcare and laboratory diagnosis, under reporting, and the completeness and accuracy of data reported. Second, the risk of dengue infection in SEA was assumed to be identical across each country, without considering the immunity of different serotypes in Chinese travelers and SEA residents. Third, we only estimated the risk of the Chinese and SEA residents, but the actual nationalities in travelers might be much complex, not only the Chinese and SEA residents, but also the residents from other countries passing through SEA on their way to China. Fourth, we regarded Ae. albopictus as an equally competent vector to Ae. aegypti for DENV, with similar temperature dependency and extrinsic incubation period. Fifth, our estimates did not address variability in the public health and health-care capacity and resources for different years and locations in China and SEA countries in response to dengue. Furthermore, due to the availability of monthly disease incidence in SEA countries and the absence of monthly travel data by land and water from SEA into China and within China, we only estimate the seasonal risk of introduction through air travel for nine SEA countries. Therefore, the total risk of dengue introductions from all SEA countries into China must be underestimated in this study. To solve these problems in future studies, the monthly dengue incidence for all countries could be estimated by mathematical models based on epidemiological and entomological parameters and climate data, and the seasonal and multiannual cross-border population movements could be further estimated by gravity-type spatial interaction models or using novel sources of data, e.g. mobile phone data or social media data [50\u201352].",

Our model framework is sufficiently flexible to incorporate new forms of data and adapt to different vector-borne diseases. Moreover, it may be used to project into the future given different scenarios and to quantify the effects of different control methods. It also highlights the need for high-quality, accessible travel and surveillance data at national, regional, and global levels. As shown here, travel dynamics have a direct and drastic impact on regional and global infectious disease dynamics and having accessible data to assess those risks in real time can support appropriate risk assessment and prevention, and control activities.",
