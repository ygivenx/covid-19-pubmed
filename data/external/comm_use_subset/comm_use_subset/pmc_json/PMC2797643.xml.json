DNA oligos were synthesized and named as pH1-P2 or pCMV-P2 depending upon the plasmid promoter used for the expression of shRNA. Following a report documenting hypersusceptibility of Dicer-1-deficient mice to VSV infection as a result of impaired miR-24 and miR-93 expression [26], we examined the contribution of miR-93 in the replication of CHPV. Use of bioinformatics tools, RNA22 (http://cbcsrv.watson.ibm.com/rna22_targets.html) and RNAhybrid (http://bibiserv.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/rnahybrid/submission.html) revealed that CHPV P gene has two potential binding site for hsa-miR-93. After confirmation, the role of miR-93 in the CHPV replication was assessed by using the stem and loop of miR-93 in different combinations using pSilencer 2.0 H1 neo vector (Ambion, Applied Biosystems International, Foster City, CA) and named pH1-mir-93 (hsa-miR-93 precursor sequence), pH1-miR-93-P-2 (stem of miR-93 was replaced with P-2 siRNA) and pH1-mir-93-P-2-30 (stem and loop of miR-93 was replaced with P-2 siRNA and miR-30 respectively) was used. All the oligos were synthesized by IDT, USA (Table 3). Sense and antisense oligos were annealed and ligated to either pSilencer 3.1 H1 neo or pSilencer 4.1 CMV neo vectors (Ambion, Applied Biosystems International, Foster City, CA) as recommended by the manufacturer. All the clones were screened by restriction digestion and confirmed by sequencing. Endofree maxi preps were made and quantitated. Different shRNA expressing plasmids (5 \u00b5g) were co-transfected individually with plasmid pAcGFP1N1-CHPV-P (500 ng). 24 hr post transfection, cells were harvested, RNA isolated and real time one step RT-PCR and FACS analysis were carried out. Different shRNA expressing plasmids were individually transfected 24 hr at post transfection, cells were infected with 36 PFU/ml of CHPV. At 12 and 24 hr post PI, supernatants were assayed for the presence of the CHPV by plaque assay and real time one step RT-PCR.",

M gene siRNAs were directly validated with the virus. P-2, M-5 and M-6 siRNAs were equally efficient in inhibiting CHPV induced cytopathic effects (Fig 3). Replication inhibition in siRNA treated cells was also confirmed by 2logs reduction in the virus titer as evidenced by both plaque assay and real time one step RT- PCR (Fig 3b). Unfortunately, use of combinations of effective siRNAs at different concentrations did not yield additive benefit. A possible explanation could be that cells have a limited capacity to assemble the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and siRNA's compete for the available RISC pool present in the cells [30]. Similar observations have been reported for two respiratory viruses, respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus [15], [31].",

Though efficient silencing was observed at 12hr, the efficacy was lost at 24hr (Fig 6b). This could possibly be because of apoptosis and subsequent inhibition of host transcription induced by M protein for both CHPV [34] and VSV [35] infections. Similar to our findings, abrogation of DNA based RNAi was found in apoptotic cells due to caspace-3 mediated inactivation of Dicer-1 without affecting RISC dependent part of RNAi [36]. Therefore, siRNA seems to be a better approach for regulating CHPV replication especially because it is an acute infection with rapid course and long-term treatment is not needed. However, in a recent study, efficacy of shRNA was effectively shown for the treatment of JEV encephalitis in mice by using lentiviral vector. 100% survival was recorded when mice were injected IC with pseudotyped RV-G lentiviral vector expressing shRNA specific for JEV and challenged half an hour later with 4 LD50 of JEV at the same site [20].",

Survival was reduced to 40% and 20% respectively. Considering the rapidity of CHPV replication, these results are significant. If we could introduce large amount of siRNA post-infection, survival of mice seems likely. Due to the limitation of the volume, this could not be tried.

Fig 10a clearly documents excessive upregulation of IFN gene in the early stages of the infection (24hr PI) followed by drastic decrease. Thus, though IFN is produced in large quantities to combat the infection, desired effect was not achieved leading to death. Importantly, no elevation was recorded in virus-infected P-2 siRNA treated as well as control mice receiving the vehicle alone. IL-10, involved in the suppression of the protective immune response was elevated in the initial phase and at the time of death. This cytokine might be playing crucial role in the pathogenesis of CHPV. The elevated expression of TNF and IL-1\u03b2 were found to decrease with time that is consistent with a previous report documenting susceptibility of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 knockout (KO) mice to lethal HSV-1 encephalitis [43]. SOCS-1, the suppressor of cytokine signaling gene playing a critical role in the negative regulation of cytokine signaling was steadily decreasing after initial elevation. These results are similar to a study with rabies virus infection wherein downregulation of SOCS-1 gene was shown [44].",
