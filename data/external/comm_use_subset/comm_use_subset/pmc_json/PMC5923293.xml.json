Measuring the levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA; also known as human kallikrein-3) in serum is the standard first line test to indicate risk of prostate cancer and the most widely used biomarker for prostate cancer diagnosis. The advent of the PSA test in the late 1990s as a tool for prostate cancer diagnosis has enormously benefited prostate cancer patients for more than two decades2,3. However, inadequacies continue to exist over its suitability for use as a diagnostic tool for early detection of prostate cancer due to lack of specificity and high rates of over-diagnosis and over-treatment associated with PSA testing4,5. Therefore, there is an urgent clinical need for better diagnostic tools for prostate cancer.",

Most prostate biopsies are routinely performed taking 12 cores under transrectal ultrasound guidance6, with an increase in the core number found to increase cancer detection rate by only 1.06 fold7. However, the major drawback lies in the possibility of generating false negatives, as the samples are often taken randomly due to the unknown location of the tumour, and patients may require repeated biopsies under MRI guidance or in combination with ultrasound for better sensitivity6. Over recent years, considerable research has led to the development of several molecular and genetic assays that have provided a prospective direction for the development of prostate cancer biomarkers5. Such assays utilise body fluid- or tissue-based biomarkers for the diagnosis, prognosis and risk stratification of prostate cancer5. Despite recent advances, it is still necessary to understand the role of these tests in the overall management of prostate cancer patients and the search for potential new biomarkers continues.",

In the present study, we identified an association of elevated plasma levels of four miRNAs i.e. miR-4289, miR-326, miR-98-5p and miR-152-3p in prostate cancer patients. Initially, we analysed the plasma miRNAome in age-matched prostate cancer patients and healthy controls using a miRNA PCR array approach. We selected sample pooling for initial screening of miRNAs because it minimised cost, reduced analytical run times and compensated for limited amounts of plasma samples enabling us to profile a large number of miRNAs in patient and control samples in a cost effective way, and has been employed in previous studies22,23. Many biological experiments have relied on pooling of biological specimens and the efficiency of this method has also been statistically investigated previously24,25. Although sample pooling has its own advantages, it is not the optimum approach because while mitigating the loss of information, it does not take into consideration biological variation within individual samples. This may lead to the difference observed between miRNA expression in pooled and individual samples. Therefore, subsequent qRT-PCR in single samples from the discovery and validation cohorts was performed for validation of results and only those miRNAs that were deregulated in the same direction in both pooled and individual samples were selected for further analysis by applying a stringent cut-off. The majority of previously conducted studies have used a higher CT cut-off to identify multiple miRNAs, however, we have applied a strict cut-off to our analysis as our goal was to determine the most obvious candidates for rapid identification along the line of clinical translation. Our identified miRNA signature generated ROC curves with AUC values better than the previously reported AUC value for PSA26,27. Similarly, other groups have assessed the diagnostic performance of plasma or serum miRNAs in patients with localised or metastatic prostate cancer, BPH and healthy controls, and in most instances the specificity and sensitivity of the miRNA biomarkers have outperformed the accuracy of the PSA test23,28,29. Although early detection and management of prostate cancer is a complex ongoing issue, there is insufficient evidence to support the benefits of population-based screening for prostate cancer in Australia and in the United States using the PSA test30\u201332. The Cancer Council Australia and U.S. Preventative Services Task Force recommends against the PSA test, partly due to the over-diagnosis and over-treatment associated with it33,34. PSA screening in healthy men is uncommon in Australia and thus, we did not have the PSA values for our control group which limited our ability to perform the miRNA vs PSA comparisons in our study. A pertinent limitation of our study is that some (45% and 42%, respectively) patient samples in cohort-1 and 2 were collected after or during primary treatment. Although miRNA levels are affected by the treatment regimen of patients, we have tried to mitigate this effect by keeping the timing of sample collection consistent between the discovery and validation cohorts, using appropriate statistical methods and relying on the stability of miRNAs in body fluids.",

The expression pattern is in line with our findings in the TCGA dataset where miR-152 is lowly expressed in tumour compared with adjacent non-malignant tissues. A possible mechanism for the decreased expression is likely to be methylation of the miR-152 host gene promoter which prevents transcription of this miRNA in tumour tissues possibly due to its tumour suppressive nature45. Another mechanism could be its release into the circulation to enable tumour growth at metastatic sites which may explain our results obtained through functional assays using miR-152-3p mimics. Elevated levels of plasma miR-152 have been proposed as a diagnostic biomarker for other cancers such as lung, colorectal and breast cancer46, and our findings suggest its potential to detect prostate cancer either alone or in combination with the other three identified miRNAs.",

Studies have reported that circulating miRNAs are involved in cell to cell communication and can be taken up by recipient cells to exert functional effects such as proliferation, invasion and angiogenesis47. For example, tumour exosomal miRNAs were shown to promote metastasis in other sites of the body by modulation of stromal cells in distant organs48. We did not observe any significant effect of miR-152-3p overexpression on the proliferative ability of PC3 prostate cancer cells as previously suggested by Zhu et al.43. In contrast, we found that overexpression of miR-152-3p significantly increased proliferation and migration in LNCaP prostate cancer cells which suggests that regulation by the androgen receptor (AR) may account for the observed differences. This is contradictory to the findings from another study by Theodore et al. where low expression of miR-152 has been correlated with an increase in prostate cancer metastasis44. However, this may provide a clue to the metastatic role of this miRNA at a distant site other than its site of production possibly via exosomal escape as miRNAs are known to play a role in metastasis49,50 and miR-152-3p has been previously reported as an exosomal miRNA51,52. It is also believed that miRNA secretion is a selective process and therefore, circulatory levels are not a true reflection of intracellular levels53. On the contrary, some miRNAs are released by tumour cells as Argonaute (AGO) bound complexes54 or from dead cells in apoptotic bodies55, thus indicating the tumour as one of their sources.",

            "text": "CCND1 is a well-recognised oncogene involved in the direct phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein and promoting cell cycle transition from the G1 to S phase56. CCND1 is over-expressed in a considerable portion of human malignancies such as breast and prostate cancer57,58 and it has been shown as a miRNA target in breast cancer cells and primary prostatic epithelial cells56. Similarly, recent studies by Lynch et al. and Chakravarthi et al. demonstrated an inverse correlation between CDKN1B and miRNAs in prostate cancer cell lines and clinical prostatectomy specimens59,60. However, we did not observe any change in CCND1 and CDKN1B mRNA expression in LNCaP cells with miR-152-3p treatment. KRAS is a well-established oncogenic GTPase protein playing an important role in cell division, differentiation and apoptosis. miRNA targeting of the KRAS 3\u2032UTR in a recent study induced cell apoptosis in vitro and exerted a tumour suppressive effect in vivo in xenograft mice models of colorectal cancer61. This suggests the importance of the miRNA-KRAS axis in prostate cancer where the miRNA has been found to play a tumour suppressive role62. On the contrary, our results suggest the upregulation of KRAS at the mRNA level with miR-152-3p treatment in LNCaP cells which may explain the increase in cell proliferation and migration observed during our functional studies. HSP90AA1 is a molecular chaperone that promotes regulation of specific proteins involved in signal transduction and cell cycle. A recent study by Wilson et al. indicated the importance of histone methylation of AR binding sites of transcriptional targets, such as HSP90AA1 in androgen signalling in prostate cancer progression63. This may result in a positive regulation of HSP90AA1 in metastasis as shown by our Oncomine data analysis, whereas the expression of HSP90AA1 possibly remains unchanged in localised cancer due to more stable complex formation between AR and HSP90AA1. We observed a decrease in HSP90AA1 mRNA in LNCaP cells after miRNA treatment suggesting it as a possible target of miR-152-3p which in turn may play a role in the androgen signalling pathway. SOS2 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor involved in Ras activation which stimulates a series of signal cascades crucial for malignant transformation. A recent study by Alles et al. demonstrated that miRNA overexpression in the HEK-293T kidney cancer cell line lead to reduced levels of endogenous SOS264. Therefore, targeting of SOS factors by miRNAs may potentially inactivate Ras signalling, however, many other factors are involved in signalling cascades resulting in cancer progression.",

Targeting of PTEN by miR-152-3p may therefore, result in increased cell proliferation and migration as observed in our functional assays, however, we did not observe any changes at the PTEN mRNA level with miR-152-3p treatment. Contrary to the previously reported role of PTEN, we also found that PTEN was up-regulated in both prostate cancer vs normal, and metastasis vs primary prostate cancer. The differential expression of PTEN was extracted in particular from the Yu Prostate dataset67 in the Oncomine cancer microarray database68. This dataset was selected over other datasets because it had the largest number of prostate cancer (primary/metastasis) and normal samples for comparison of all the target genes of interest. Although PTEN is generally considered to be a tumour suppressor, it may act as a tumour promoter is some instances69. It is also widely known that in addition to gene expression, genomic instabilities, mutations and copy number variation in the PTEN gene are often associated with prostate cancer70,71, and it is estimated that up to 70 percent of primary prostate tumours have PTEN gene mutations71. The Yu Prostate dataset in the Oncomine cancer microarray database did not take these into account during data analysis and as a result, PTEN may be shown to be up-regulated. Additional data analysis using other datasets in Oncomine taking PTEN deletions and copy number variations into account revealed trends in the opposite direction.",

Some of these miR-152-3p targets are oncogenes while some are tumour suppressors and this suggests that miRNA target modulation is dependent on various aspects such as genetic alterations, transcriptional/ post-transcriptional regulation, post-translational modification, target stabilisation, indirect regulation as well as cell type. Moreover, validation of target genes and further functional studies are necessary to understand the mechanistic role of our identified miRNAs in cancer progression.",

Although it may have been ideal to include similar numbers of patients and controls, several published studies where the control group is smaller in number compared to the patient group have been reported previously20. In addition, we have identified a novel plasma miRNA panel consisting of four miRNAs which have previously not been implicated for early diagnosis of prostate cancer. This was achieved by using higher than normal stringency to identify the most reliable candidates which is unique compared with many other studies. It was beyond the scope of our study to compare miRNA expression levels in BPH patients as analysed in several other studies as discussed in our review article20. Developments in the field of biomarker research are ongoing as stipulated by emerging miRNAs and current tests that have a specific role in prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment. However, a critical need for robustness and reproducible data to implement such biomarkers in clinical practice still remains. Undoubtedly, in the next few decades a substantial number of biomarkers will be available for clinical use in the overall management of prostate cancer.",

The validation cohort of prostate cancer patients (N = 40) were recruited as part of the Australian Prostate Cancer BioResource (APCB) consisting of 3,100 patients including 350 men recruited via collaborations with urologists, 2,000 men from the QLD node of APCB, and 750 men recruited in collaboration with The Cancer Council Queensland73. Healthy male control participants for both the discovery and validation cohorts (N = 37) were recruited through the electoral roll as part of the Queensland Men\u2019s Health Study (QLDMen), a cross-sectional population-based study consisting of 1,300 men including 450 age- and postal code- matched controls to complement participants in the ProsCan and APCB studies. The patient and control numbers were selected depending on the availability of samples from participants with similar clinical characteristics, as well as with reference to previous studies that we have discussed in our published review article20. The patient group in each cohort is further divided into metastatic (\u22645 and >5 years survival) and non-metastatic patients. This subdivision ensured that each category of participants i.e. metastatic, non-metastatic and healthy in each cohort consisted of about 20 samples. Follow-up data for ~10 years was available for the patients including those who survived for less than 5 years after prostate cancer diagnosis. Details of age, PSA levels, clinical grade (Gleason scores), pathologic state (TNM stages) and family history have been collected to document clinical characteristics of the disease. ~19\u201322% of the patients and ~11\u201315% of the healthy controls in each cohort had a family history of prostate cancer. 52.4\u201362.5% patients and 84.2\u201388.9% controls in both the cohorts did not have any family history of prostate cancer.",

For miRNA screening (Fig. 7), eight random plasma pools (two pools per group) were generated before RNA extraction for the control group and three patient groups in the discovery cohort using a randomising web-based tool (https://www.miniwebtool.com/random-picker/). In this way 150 \u00b5l of plasma required per pool was generated by dividing the total volume required (i.e. 150 \u00b5l) by the number of samples per pool. For example, the control group consisting of 19 healthy males was divided into two plasma pools of 10 and 9 controls. Each of the 10 controls in pool-1 contributed 15 \u00b5l of plasma, while each of the 9 controls in pool-2 contributed 16.67 \u00b5l of plasma. Similarly the three patient groups consisting of 12, 16 and 14 samples were divided into 6 \u00d7 2, 8 \u00d7 2 and 7 \u00d7 2 samples/pool respectively, and each patient per group contributed 25 \u00b5l of plasma in pools-3 and 4, 18.75 \u00b5l of plasma is pools-5 and 6, and 21.43 \u00b5l of plasma in pools-7 and 8. Therefore, total RNA was extracted from 150 \u00b5l of pooled plasma from each of the two pools per patient/control group in the discovery cohort, and eluted in 14 \u00b5l of RNase-free water using the miRNeasy Serum/Plasma kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. 0.5 \u00b5g of bacterial ribosomal RNA (Roche) was added to each sample for increased RNA recovery, and 3.5 \u00b5l of miRNeasy Serum/Plasma Spike-In Control i.e. cel-miR-39 (at 1.6 \u00d7 108 copies/\u00b5l) (Qiagen) was added to each sample as an internal control for plasma miRNA expression profiling and normalisation of qRT-PCR data as previously described19. 5 \u00b5l of extracted RNA from pooled plasma samples was reverse transcribed using the miScript II RT kit with HiSpec Buffer (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Fig. 7).",

The qRT-PCR was run on a ViiA7 system (Applied Biosystems) and the data analysed using the GeneGlobe data analysis software (Qiagen). The cel-miR-39 Spike-In control was used by the program to calibrate the data sets, and the miRNA PCR array data was normalised by the global mean normalisation method75. This method automatically calculated a global CT mean for the miRNA targets that were commonly expressed in all the samples being analysed after an initial calibration to the exogenous cel-miR-39 Spike-In control. For plasma miRNA expression profiling in individual samples, the cel-miR-39 Spike-In control was used as an internal control for normalisation of qRT-PCR data as previously described19. Fold regulation represents fold change values generated during miRNA expression profiling in a biologically meaningful way. The fold change was calculated using the equation 2\u2212\u2206\u2206CT. For fold regulation, the fold change values less than 1 (meaning that the miRNA is down-regulated) was transformed by calculating the negative inverse. Therefore, the values remain the same while their representation is changed only. All CT (number of cycles required for fluorescent signal to cross the set threshold; inversely proportional to miRNA levels) values >30 were considered as a negative call by the software. Therefore, the lower limit of detection was \u226430 CT to avoid false positives. The final values of miRNA expression levels were generated in a biologically meaningful way as fold regulation i.e. the negative inverse of fold change. A 2.5 fold-regulation cut-off was used to shortlist deregulated miRNAs.",

The p-values were adjusted for multiple testing using Bonferroni correction. Univariate logistic regression was performed to determine the ability of individual miRNAs to predict disease occurrence in prostate cancer patients. The RNA concentration was set as an offset variable to account for the differences in the starting amounts of RNA. The capacity of combined miRNAs to distinguish between patients and healthy controls was evaluated by ROC curve analysis in the discovery (N = 61), validation (N = 58) and combined (N = 119) cohorts to increase the predictive power of the analysis. For ROC analysis of the miRNA panel, binary logistic regression analysis was performed for all four miRNAs at the same time enabling calculation of predicted probabilities of the miRNA combination which was further used to generate AUC values for the miRNA panel. The AUC is an effective and combined measure of sensitivity and specificity that describes the inherent validity of diagnostic tests. The ROC curve corresponding to progressively greater discriminant capacity of diagnostic tests is located closer to the upper left-hand corner away from the diagonal reference line77. A p-value of \u22640.05 was considered to be significant for all analyses. All statistical analyses were done using GraphPad Prism 7.02, SPSS and RStudio in consultation with qualified statisticians from the Queensland Facility for Advanced Bioinformatics (QFAB, UQ) and the Research Methods Group (RMG, QUT). An overall summary of the methodology is presented in Fig. 7.",
