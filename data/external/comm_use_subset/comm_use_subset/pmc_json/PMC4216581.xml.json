            "text": "Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), as a member of Herpesviridae can cause severe diseases in the neonates, the elderly, patients with drug-induced immunosuppression, and in those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Nowadays, increasing resistance to antiherpetic drugs are reported frequently (1). Due to the drug side effects and HSV resistance to antiviral drugs, especially resistance to acyclovir in high-risk immunocompromised patients, new medications including herbal plants such as Glycyrrhiza glabra (licorice root) have drawn especial interest. This highlights the need for new efficient and safe agents for treating HSV (2). Manuscripts from China, Greece, and India confirm the historical background of the Glycyrrhiza species use (3). In China, licorice (Gan Cao) has been reported as one of the oldest and most commonly prescribed traditional medicine, which has been used in the treatment of several diseases (4). G. glabra natural habitat are Southwest and Central Asia as well as subtropical and temperate areas of the planet, including Europe. The root is termed licorice and has a sweet odor and smell The genus Glycyrrhiza (Leguminosae) includes about 30 species such as G.\nglabra, G.\nuralensis, G.\ninflata, G. aspera, and Persian and Turkish licorices, which are determined as G. glabra var. violace.",

In that research, the scientists recognized glycyrrhizic acid and its antiviral activity in vitro, which suppressed the growth and cytopathic effects (CPE) of numerous DNA and RNA viruses, such as HSV-1, Newcastle disease, Vaccinia virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus (3). Some reports indicated that a few minor constituents of G. glabra such as liquiritigenin and isoliquiritigenin might have some pharmacological functions (4). Acyclovir, a nucleoside analog and an antiherpetic drug, has partially fulfilled the need for treating the infection entirely; however, it leads to viral resistance and consequently, viral latency and recurrence (6). Regarding the increasing rate of HSV resistance to drugs and the evidences of HSV-1 infection in the majority of women before fertility age in Iran (7) finding a novel anti-HSV drugs seems necessary (8).",

Pretreatment of cells with extract for two hours and incubation of virus with extract for one and as well as two hours had significant differences among the study groups (F = 247.412; df = 3.8; P < 0.001). Tukey\u2019s HSD test showed the significant effect of any of the mentioned groups in comparison to the control virus (P < 0.001) (Table 3). Moreover, the comparison between pretreatment of cells with extract for two hours and incubation of virus with extract for one hour showed a significant difference in the antiviral effect of licorice root extract (P < 0.040); however such an effect was not significant in comparison to the incubation of virus with extract for two hours (P = 0.31). Incubation of virus with licorice root extract showed significant difference in antiviral effect of licorice root extract between one and two hours incubation (P < 0.001) (Table 3 and Figure 3).",

In this situation, the HSV-1 was inhibited by either directly inactivation of virus or antiadhesive property of G. glabra aqueous extract, which hampers the adhesion of HSV-1 to Vero, cells in vitro. The latter hypothesis is in agreement with Wittschier et al. findings that confirmed the polysaccharides isolated from the aqueous extract of G. glabra roots present so strong antiadhesive property that is able to suppress the adhesion of Helicobacter pylori to human gastric mucosa. Wittschier et al. believed that this effect was related to the polysaccharides isolated from the aqueous extract of G. glabra (11). Furthermore, glycyrrhizin and glycyrrhizic acid are capable of hampering the growth and CPE of HSV (5, 12).",

Data from another study appears to be consistent with the interruption of genes expression in HSV by a medicinal plant named Chamaecyparis\nobtuse; however, it was effective in the immediate-early stages of gene expression (13). Moreover, traditional Chinese herb, namely, Tripterygium hypoglaucum, has been shown to have anti-HSV properties by suppressing early and late stages of genes expression (14). Other studies have also indicated that licorice root and its constituents, perform an antiviral activity against HSV that permanently inactivates the virus (5, 15, 16). This might be due to the different components of this plant including glycyrrhizic acid, which inactivates HSV particles (5). Moreover, animal studies have reported that glycyrrhizin and its derivatives are capable to decrease viral activity and the mortality rate in HSV encephalitis (3). Another report revealed the key role of glycyrrhizin in improving the impaired resistance of injured mice to the infection by HSV (17).",
