            "text": "Influenza viruses cause severe annual morbidity and mortality [1]. The genome of influenza A viruses is composed of 8 negative-sense single stranded RNA gene segments (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, M and NS) that encode 10 major proteins and several auxiliary peptides. Production of infectious progeny virions requires incorporation of all 8 vRNA segments and occurs at the apical membrane of infected cells [2]. The segmented nature of the viral genome allows for the generation of novel reassortant viruses containing genes from distinct parental viruses in co-infected cells. The 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus arose from a reassortment event between two swine origin viruses [3]. Additionally, the 2013 H7N9 virus responsible for the outbreak in Mainland China and Taiwan is a reassortant virus deriving gene segments from avian H9N2 and H7N9 viruses [4]. Reassortment provides an evolutionary advantage for influenza viruses and thus reassortant viruses pose a major public health risk. Understanding how vRNA segments are assembled and packaged into progeny virions is key for unlocking how reassortant viruses are generated, yet little is known about this process.",

Each newly synthesized vRNA segment is coated with the viral nucleoprotein (NP) and the heterotrimeric polymerase complex associates with each vRNA segment via the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends. This resultant vRNP complex is exported from the nucleus and travels to the plasma membrane for packaging into a budding virion [2], [5]. Recent studies have suggested a role for Rab11a-containing recycling endosomes in the transport of vRNA segments to the plasma membrane for packaging [6]\u2013[9]. However, the dynamics of vRNA transport, including whether vRNA segments are transported individually or as a complex, remain largely unclear.",

Additionally, tracking vRNA movement during a productive infection requires a virus that expresses a fluorescent tag fused to a viral protein involved in vRNA trafficking, which is packaged into progeny virions and is maintained in subsequent generations. Although some fluorescent influenza viruses have been generated, they either contain GFP fused with a viral protein not involved in vRNA transport or as a separate polypeptide used as a marker for infection that fails to highlight any specific process of the viral lifecycle [18]\u2013[20]. An influenza virus with PB2 tagged with split-GFP was recently used to assess the movement of vRNA [21]. However, while split-GFP is useful in studying protein-protein interactions, it is a poor choice for visualizing protein dynamics because 1) visualization is limited to cells expressing the remainder of the GFP molecule; 2) visualization is not possible prior to formation of the complete GFP; 3) split-GFP fragments are unstable compared to intact GFP; and 4) split-GFP is prone to aggregation [22]\u2013[24].",

To assess the dynamics of vRNA assembly in the cytoplasm we generated an influenza virus, A/WSN/1933 (H1N1) (WSN) expressing full-length GFP fused to the viral polymerase PA protein (WSN PA-GFP) and observed that PA-GFP foci colocalize and travel together in the cytoplasm by an inverted selective-plane illumination microscope.

Figure 1 depicts two representative cells displaying all 8 vRNA segments; one cell probed for vRNA segments PB2, PB1, PA, and NP and the other probed for HA, NA, M and NS vRNA segments.

Closer inspection of the cytoplasmic foci in the enlarged areas of Figure 1 revealed foci containing combinations of 4, 3, 2, or a single vRNA segment (various arrowheads). Staining of vRNA segments in the nucleus indicated a high degree of colocalization between the vRNA foci (white pixels in the merged nucleus image); however, the high density of the vRNA segments and their diffuse appearance prevented accurate assessment of potential colocalization between vRNA segments in the nucleus. Therefore, we focused on the fate of vRNA segments after nuclear export. To explore the composition of each cytoplasmic focus we used the imaging software Imaris to mask the nucleus, thus excluding the vRNA nuclear staining from our analysis. Figure 2A shows a 3D rendering of all the cytoplasmic foci in a MDCK cell infected with WT WSN and probed for PB2 (red), PB1 (green), PA (orange), and NP (yellow), which encode proteins that form the viral RNP complex. This image was rotated to provide an axial view of the cell and to highlight the cytoplasmic foci in relationship with the nucleus. To quantify the total number of foci containing a single labeled vRNA segment, 2 distinct vRNA segments, 3 different segments, or all 4 vRNA segments, we determined the signal intensity for each fluorophore in each cytoplasmic focus from three independent cells. We found that a significantly larger number of cytoplasmic foci contained all 4 labeled vRNA segments (Figure 2B). This observation was consistent for each set of four vRNA segments that we tested (Figure S3).",

We found that the majority of the foci near or at the nucleus (within 0.1 \u00b5m) contained more than one vRNA segment (Figure 2C), suggesting that vRNA segments are not exported from the nucleus as individual segments. In general, independent of distance from the nucleus the proportion of foci containing 3 or 4 vRNA segments was much higher than those containing 1 or 2 vRNA segments (Figure 2C). Interestingly, we observed an increase in the proportion of foci containing four vRNA as the distance from the nucleus increased to 0.5 \u00b5m (Figure 2C). Based on the axial view of the cell in Figure 2A, the top of nucleus is very close to the apical cellular membrane, as defined by FISH staining. There may be a bias at 0.5 \u00b5m from the nucleus for foci that are at the plasma membrane being incorporated into progeny virions preparing to bud. The predominance of foci containing all four labeled vRNA segments close to the apical surface of the cell is consistent with the notion that vRNA assembly is selective and that there is a mechanism to ensure packaging of all 8 vRNA segments. However, since the distance from the nucleus to the cellular membrane is not uniform in all directions, we observed many foci located at distances greater than 0.5 \u00b5m from the nucleus that did not contain all 4 of the labeled vRNA segments (Figure 2C).",

A proposed mechanism for assembly includes the formation of a single linear interaction network between vRNA segments for packaging [5]. We multiplexed FISH probes (Table S1) to compare each vRNA segment to each other in an attempt to identify a linear interaction network between vRNA segments, and calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient between each vRNA segment in the cytoplasm (Figure 3). The Pearson correlation coefficient has been used extensively for estimating the colocalization between two channels [25] as it suggests the degree of colocalization: values of 0.5\u20131 are considered high, 0.3\u20130.5 moderate, and 0\u20130.3 low. As a positive control, we probed the same segment with two FISH probes conjugated to different fluorophores. The Pearson coefficient for the positive controls was in the high range, with the exception of the NS gene segment (Figure 3). In general we observed colocalization coefficient values between vRNA segments in the high to moderate range, making it difficult to ascribe a linear order of assembly between vRNA segments. Interestingly, we observed a low correlation of \u223c0.2 between PB2 and HA vRNA segments (Figure 3). This observation is of particular interest since these two gene segments encode the most well characterized virulence motifs of influenza viruses [26]\u2013[29].",

In order to investigate this further, we sought to observe cytoplasmic vRNA trafficking in live cells. Since it is technically challenging to label vRNA segments for live cell imaging, we developed a fluorescent virus that could be used to study viral replication during a productive infection. We generated a WSN virus encoding a full length GFP fused to the viral PA protein, a component of the heterotrimeric viral polymerase complex with endonuclease activity that is associated with the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends of vRNA segments [2], [30]\u2013[32]. Creation of the WSN PA-GFP virus built upon two previously published observations. First, the WSN PA protein, fused to GFP at its C-terminus, functions like wild-type (WT) PA protein in in vitro replication experiments [33]. Second, rescue of viruses with a vRNA segment containing a large fragment of foreign RNA requires duplication of approximately 150 base pairs (bp) of the coding region prior to the 3\u2032 non-coding region [34]. Thus, we generated a WSN PA-GFP virus with a portion of the C-terminal coding region duplicated after the GFP stop codon and prior to the non-coding region of the PA gene segment (Figure 4A).",

Presence of the viral NP protein was used to ensure equal loading of both viruses. The localization pattern of WSN PA-GFP in MDCK cells 16 hours post-infection was diffusely nuclear with discrete cytoplasmic foci that colocalized with the viral NP protein (Figure 4C). We confirmed that PA-GFP colocalized with vRNA segments by using FISH against vRNA segments PB2 and HA in both MDCK (Figure 5A) and human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial (A549) cells (Figure 5B) 16 hours post-infection. Additionally, treatment of infected cells with leptomycin B (LMB) 4 hours post-infection restricted the localization of PA-GFP, NP, and vRNA segments to the nucleus 24 hours post-infection (Figure S4). Nuclear retention of these vRNP components in the presence of LMB demonstrates that nuclear export depends upon exportin 1 (Crm1), as previously suggested [35]\u2013[37].

In order to capture the 3D dynamics spanning a large temporal range, while minimizing photobleaching and photodamage, we used the recently developed inverted selective-plane illumination microscopy (iSPIM) [38] to image the movement of PA-GFP foci every 2 seconds for 30 minutes in MDCK and A549 cells starting 16 hours post-infection (Movies S1 and S2). Multiple WSN PA-GFP trajectories were analyzed from each cell. In order to define the movement of the foci we determined the mean squared displacement (MSD) of each PA-GFP focus during a trajectory [39]. We found that many foci displayed diffusive movement, based on the characteristic linear dependence of their MSDs on time, while a quarter of the foci appeared to undergo active transport, as their MSDs displayed nonlinear time dependence (Figure S5). PA-GFP trajectories with active transport had average speeds of 0.23+/\u22120.06 \u00b5m/s and 0.27+/\u22120.11 \u00b5m/s in MDCK and A549 cells respectively.

A single focus is tracked from near the nuclear edge into the cytoplasm and towards the cell periphery (Figure 6B). After 36 s, the PA-GFP focus (Figure 6C, red arrow) colocalized and fused with another focus (blue arrow). We confirmed that these two foci persisted as a single focus after colocalization by observing 1) a single peak in a fluorescence intensity vs. depth plot at the site of fusion and 2) an increase in fluorescence intensity of the fused focus at the time of fusion compared to a stationary, unfused adjacent focus (Figure 6D and E). While previous studies reported similar average speeds of vRNA trafficking [21] they did not observe dynamic fusion and colocalization events in the cytoplasm. The WSN PA-GFP virus enabled us to extend these previous studies and describe a novel aspect of vRNA transport. The fusion of multiple PA-GFP foci in the cytoplasm may reflect the coalescence of polymerase complexes attached to different vRNA segments, suggesting that the subcomplexes we identified using four-color FISH dynamically associate with each other in the cytoplasm en route to the plasma membrane.",

The data from this study provide insight into vRNA assembly, which is important for understanding the intracellular mechanism of vRNA reassortment. First, our data suggest that vRNA segments are not exported as individual segments since the majority of foci at the external nuclear periphery contain more than one vRNA segment (Figure 2C). Second, we observed many cytoplasmic foci with fewer than 4 vRNA segments (Figure 1, 2A, 2C and Figure S3), implying that all 8 vRNA segments are not exported from the nucleus together. Third, individual vRNA segments do not reach the plasma membrane separately since many foci contain more than a single vRNA segment and foci can fuse together in the cytoplasm (Figure 1, 2B, and 6C). Therefore, we believe that vRNA assembly is an active process that includes the formation of flexible subcomplexes that export from the nucleus and then undergo further assembly en route to the plasma membrane via dynamic colocalization events (Figure 7).",

Selective assembly of vRNA segments into this type of conformation would seem to require either a linear ordering of vRNA-vRNA associations or a the existence of a master segment in the center that can interact with all other segments [5]. In vitro studies exploring the RNA-RNA interactions between all 8 segments have suggested that indeed a linear interaction network between vRNA segments is used for vRNA assembly [13], [16], but these interaction networks are not conserved between different subtypes of influenza A viruses [15]. In this study, we attempted to identify preferences between vRNA segments using the four-color FISH assay and found that most vRNA segments colocalize with each other with a high confidence value; we did not observe a distinct linear preference between vRNA segments (Figure 3). We believe that the high specificity of each FISH probe set (Figure S2) limits the likelihood of false positive results in our colocalization studies. In addition, our data are based on the colocalization profiles of vRNA segments throughout the entire cytoplasm, including the plasma membrane where vRNA segments are localized in high concentration prior to budding. Therefore, our data neither support nor refute the hypothesis that vRNA segments associate in an ordered fashion. Further analysis that carefully examines the colocalization profiles of vRNA segments and the vRNA composition of the cytoplasmic foci at different distances from the nucleus would provide spatially defined colocalization coefficients and interaction networks, which may help to clarify the nature of the selective arrangement between vRNA segments.",

HA mediates attachment and entry into host cells by binding to terminally attached sialic acid moieties on cell-surface glycoproteins; avian influenza viruses predominantly associate with \u03b12,3-linked sialic acids while human viruses bind \u03b12,6-linked sialic acids [41], [42]. Multiple residues of the PB2 protein, a component of the viral heterotrimeric polymerase complex, restrict replication of the virus in mammalian cells; for example the residue at position 627 typically encodes glutamic acid in avian influenza viruses and lysine in most human influenza viruses [26], [43], [44]. Interestingly, the recent studies generating airborne transmissible avian H5N1 viruses described viruses where the HA protein was modified to associate with \u03b12,6 sialic acid moieties and either contained a human PB2 vRNA segment or the PB2 627K residue [45]\u2013[47], demonstrating the importance of these two gene segments in emerging avian influenza pandemic viruses. Based on our data, a low correlation coefficient between the HA and PB2 vRNA segments may indicate that these segments are less likely to reassort together than two segments with a high correlation coefficient like PB1 and HA vRNA, which reassorted together in the 1957 H2N2 pandemic virus [48].",

A recent study [12] proposed a scheme for vRNA assembly based on visualization of only 2 vRNA segments (PB2 and NA), in which they suggest that vRNA segments are exported from the nucleus individually. By visualizing four vRNA segments simultaneously we demonstrate that most cytoplasmic foci contain more than one vRNA segment. While our data support the overall conclusion proposed by Chou et al that vRNA assembly occurs en route to the PM, we not only provide much stronger support for this model but we also extend the observations made in fixed cells by visualizing vRNA transport in live cells during a productive infection. We demonstrate that cytoplasmic foci dynamically colocalize with each other, potentially mediating further assembly of vRNA subcomplexes. In addition, previous studies have shown that influenza vRNA segments colocalize with recycling endosomes containing the small GTPase Rab11a, and that these endosomes facilitate vRNA trafficking in the cytoplasm [7], [9], [36]. We confirmed colocalization of Rab11a and influenza PB2 vRNA segment in A549 cells transfected with Rab11a-GFP (Figure S6). Since WSN PA-GFP foci colocalize with PB2 vRNA segment (Figure 5) it is likely that WSN PA-GFP and Rab11a also associate, suggesting that the dynamic colocalization events observed during viral infection might also involve Rab11a-containing recycling endosomes. Further studies characterizing the importance of the transient or sustained colocalization events in viral replication may reveal novel targets for antiviral therapeutics.",

WSN PA-GFP was constructed by engineering a silent Xba1 site in PA using site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene Santa Clara, CA) into both pHW2000 WSN PA and pCDNA WSN PA-GFP [33] at position 1986 (WT PA 1984- TCA AGA \u2013 1989; PA XBA1 1984- TCT AGA \u2013 1989). The pCDNA WSN PA-GFP plasmid contained an Xba1 site just after the GFP stop codon, so this plasmid was cut with Xba1, and the C-terminal PA-GFP fusion was inserted into the pHW2000 WSN PA Xba1 digested vector. This strategy will result in a duplication of 165 base pairs of the WSN PA coding region after the GFP stop codon as depicted in Figure 4A. WT WSN and WSN PA-GFP viruses were rescued by transfection in 293T cells with TransIT transfection reagent (Mirus Bio Madison, WI) and then plaque purified on MDCK cells. GFP positive plaques were used to inoculate 10-day old embryonated chicken eggs. Infectivity titers for all virus stocks were calculated the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) per mL as described in [52].",
