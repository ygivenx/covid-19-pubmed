Analysis was informed by the Diffusion of Innovations for Organisations framework.",

The initiation activity included two stages: 1) agenda-setting: preparations for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 stimulated the identification of organisational IPCP deficits, and 2) matching: IPCP deficits were identified and the decision to adopt an IPCP innovation package was made. Implementation included three stages: a) redefining/restructuring: identification of the components of an IPCP and how they best fit with the local health structure, b) clarifying: integration of IPCP into the health services and defining an infection control role within the nursing division and, c) routinising: the IPCP became an ongoing element in health service delivery.",
