            "text": "Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disorder that mainly affects the exocrine glands and usually presents as persistent dryness of the mouth and eyes due to functional impairment of the salivary and lachrymal glands [1]. SS occurs in a primary form not associated with other diseases and in a secondary form that complicates other rheumatic conditions, with the most common being rheumatoid arthritis. Positive RF was found in 96% of the patients with main extraglandular SS [2]. On the other hand, circulating monoclonal immunoglobulins (IgM kappa or IgG lambda) were detected in a significant higher frequency (43%) of SS-HCV patients as compared with the primary SS patients [3]. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been demonstrated to be one of the most likely candidates as a potential pathogenic agent causing SS in a subset of patients [2, 4, 5]. Many rheumatologic manifestations associated with chronic HCV infection include arthralgia, myalgia, arthritis, vasculitis, and sicca syndrome [6]. Clinical studies suggest the possibility of a close relationship among SS, HCV, and B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders [2, 4]. This triple association suggests an important role of associated autoimmune and/or chronic viral diseases in the pathogenesis of B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders and reinforces the hypothesis of a link among autoimmunity, infection, and cancer [4].",

Complex formation between RF and IgG may lead to activation of complement and other inflammatory mediators directly [9]. Physiological RF mainly belongs to IgM isotype. It serves a beneficial role in host defense which facilitates the clearance of antigen by enhancing complement activation and phagocytosis. Oppositely, pathological RF is associated with RA and other systemic autoimmune diseases [10, 11]. Monospecific IgG RFs are implicated in causing inflammation and tissue damage in the rheumatoid synovium [1, 7]. Corper et al. were the first group to visualize RF binding by crystal structure directly showing an epitope spanning the junction of the C\u03b32 and C\u03b33 domains on Fc fragment [12]. In another study, Duquerroy et al. determined a different epitope recognition site using their IgM RF [13]. Their definite C\u03b33-C\u03b33 interface, including the C-terminal region of both heavy chains, is distant from the previously identified C\u03b32-C\u03b33 interface [12]. Both complexes were generated from IgM RF origin and indicated the involvement of somatic mutations in the interaction interface.",

The combinatorial methodologies have been improved rapidly and dramatically [14, 15]. Particularly, the expression of combinatorial antibody Fab fragments on phage surfaces allows for rapid enrichment of the desired Fab fragments against target antigens. This technique has been used to study pathogenic autoantibodies in various human autoimmune disorders [16\u201318]. To study IgG RFs in Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome patients with HCV infection, we used the combinatorial antibody technique and characterized isolated RF Fab molecules. The results allow us to further define the pathogenic role of RFs played in autoimmune diseases complicated with viral infection. In addition, from the insight on the genetic level, clues are expected to reveal the association of the cause of autoimmune disorders.",

By analyzing and comparing the X-ray crystal structures of antibody-antigen complexes retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), many researches have demonstrated that sufficient information is available for analysis to indicate critical residues of great influence on the binding sites from antibody-antigen recognition interfaces [19]. In this study, we demonstrated that the isolated IgG RF has a better binding affinity than the existing complex generated by the IgM RF molecule. We managed to construct antibody models via homology modeling and used structural alignment and loop minimization to illustrate the possible role of somatic mutation induced in the CDR areas during the interactions. The logical and reasonable predicted results provide a probable explanation and further insights into the diversity and origin of these IgG RFs.",

Next, bound phages were eluted with 0.1 M HCl/glycine (pH 2.2) and neutralized with 2 M Tris-base. Eluted phages were used to infect E. coli XL1-blue strain growing in log phase. Phagemid particles were rescued from infected E. coli cells with 1011 pfu of VCS-M13 helper phage (Stratagene). After culture amplification, 4% PEG-8000 and 3% NaCl were used to precipitate recombinant phage particles. Finally, the phages were resuspended in PBS and used for the next round of panning. Panning processing against human Fc fragment was repeated four times. Thereafter, total phagemid DNA was prepared and digested with Nhe I and Spe I (NEB Biolab) to remove the phage protein III gene. The digested DNA with compatible cohesive ends was self-ligated and electroporated into E. coli XL1-blue cells. Individual clone was grown overnight in the presence of 0.5 mM isopropyl b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for Fab protein induction.

After a comparison of the heavy chain and light chain variable gene sequence with germline counterpart, RFL11 was identified by ten probable somatic mutations, two in frameworks (Tyr88Phe (VL) and Gln16His (VH)) and eight in CDRs (Asp93Gln and Ser95Asn (L3); Tyr54Phe and Lys58Asn (H2); Asn108Thr, Tyr109Thr, Tyr110Asp, and Tyr111Phe (H3)) (Figure 6). Unlike the antibody gene variations isolated in our previous works, where a substantial amount of somatic mutations occurs in CDRs or even in the framework regions in order to fight against exogenous pathogens, these pathogenic RFs caused by immune system disorders, however, possess a sequence similar to the endogenous germline sequence on the genetic level, except that critical mutations occur on the CDRs to provide a binding-specific ability to the IgG Fc domain. This implies that the generation of RF autoimmune antibodies is attained by critical changes which convert physiological RFs into pathogenic RFs.",

At lower enrichment levels, nonspecific and low affinity binders could cause outgrowth in the output phage after amplification. Moreover, in the panning process, although eluted phage titer with mild increasing only raised one order of magnitude after final round of panning, we still enriched and isolated specific phage binders from the original library successfully (Figure 1(a)). It is interesting to show that the output phage numbers in our panning process had instant increment after the third cycle, although it dropped slightly in the second round (Figure 1(a)). This result agrees with other studies [28, 29]. After sequencing of isolated clone following the final panning, almost all clones were identified to be similar. It is another verification to convince an efficient panning process resulting in high affinity clone to become dominant in the final library pool.",

RFL11 shares high similarity with the L chain amino acid sequence of RF61 autoantibody, which has been reported, but is different from another autoantibody (PDB id: 1ADQ, lower binding affinity K\nd ~ 6 \u00d7 10\u22125 M) already published [12]. In addition, CDRs H2 and H3 on the H chain of RFL11 have two and three more amino acids than those of RF61, respectively, but the amino acid sequences on the frameworks are highly similar. Despite the fact that RFL11 and RF61 come from different immunoglobulin isotypes (IgG and IgM types, resp.), their antigens are both IgG Fc; accordingly, it can be reasonably inferred that the epitopes recognized by RFL11 and RF61 have a high similarity, and the docking simulation of RFL11 antibody and IgG Fc antigen by using zDOCK program [23] also revealed an epitope highly similar to that corresponding to RF61. In order to establish a reliable structure model of RFL11 antibody-Fc complex, we used structural alignment and CDR loop minimization to replace docking. From this approach, the dominating interactions of H2 and H3 loops between RFL11 and IgG Fc can be more clearly observed to further investigate why RFL11 demonstrates a superior binding affinity to RF61, as indicated from the experiments.",

However, from the paratope of the CDR-H2 loop, Asn52 and Phe48 on the RFL11 CDR-H2 loop, generated by somatic mutation, respectively, form H-bonding and anion-pi interactions with respect to Gln438 and Asp356, indicating the importance of somatic mutation to the CDR-H2 loop. Compared with the RF61 CDR-H2 loop, the two additional amino acids Ser51 and Asn52 on the RFL11 CDR-H2 loop both interact with Gln438 on Fc with a strong H-bonding, showing that the RFL11 CDR-H2 loop has a binding affinity stronger than the RF61 CDR-H2 loop to IgG Fc.",

H-bonding and hydrophobic and ion interactions are formed between IgG Fc and the four amino acids, among which Asp104 forms a critical strong ion interaction with IgG Fc Arg355. Moreover, Tyr106 and Tyr107 also both contribute to the formation of cation-pi interaction with Arg355. As shown in Table 1, ion interaction is formed between RF61 and Arg355 of IgG Fc via Asp98 and Asp100c. Thus, Arg355 is a key residue to the IgG Fc epitope. Based on the comparison made according to Table 1, it is inferred that the RFL11 CDR-H3 loop has a binding affinity to IgG Fc similar to that of the RF61 CDR-H3 loop, but there might be some difference in the Fc epitope. Also, from the structure model, it is observed that the RFL11 CDR-H3 loop forms a finger-like structure extending into the bottom of a deep pocket of IgG Fc, which is different from the ellipse-like structure bound to the IgG Fc formed by RF61. Due to the finger-like structure, the CDR-H3 loops of RFL11 can interact with each other as a dimer and together form interactions with IgG Fc (See Figure 7), providing a binding affinity to the CDR-H3 loops of RFL11 higher than the RF61-H3 loops. From the binding structure of RFL11 and RF61 with Fc, although a novel epitope was not found, we confirmed that IgG type RF is different from IgM type RF and discovered a different CDR loop, particularly a substantial difference between H2 and H3 paratopes. Our study showed that RFL11 has a stronger binding affinity than RF61, and both the somatic mutation and computational structural biology investigation are in line with the experiments.",
