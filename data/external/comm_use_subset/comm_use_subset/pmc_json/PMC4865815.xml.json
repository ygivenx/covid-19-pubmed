As reported for both human coronavirus 229E 3CLpro and SARS-3CLpro, PEDV-3CLpro is a homodimer containing three domains in each monomer (Fig. 1)1112. The active site of PEDV-3CLpro, which contains a catalytic dyad formed from residues Cys144 and His41, is located in a cleft between domains I and II (Fig. 1a). Domain III is involved in monomer dimerization, which is ultimately responsible for forming the active protease (Fig. 1a)1213. In the absence of substrate, water and solvent molecules (MPD, DMSO, and IPA) reside in the active site of PEDV-3CLpro, which is solvent exposed on one side (Fig. 1a,b). Interestingly, different solvent molecules are found in the respective active sites of the PEDV-3CLpro monomers composing the PEDV-3CLpro dimer, where the a single DMSO molecule resides in the Chain A active site and the Chain B active site houses both isopropanol (IPA) and 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD) (Fig. 1b). The presence of different solvent molecules in each of the active sites of the dimer supports the assignment of one biological dimer in the asymmetric unit.",

SARS-3CLpro belongs to a different phylogenetic lineage than PEDV-3CLpro and shares lower sequence identity (45.4%) with PEDV-3CLpro; however, we reasoned that the similar tertiary structure and conserved active site architecture of 3CLpro\u2019s would allow for inhibition by the same molecule. We therefore tested the inhibition of PEDV-3CLpro by (R)-16, which was developed as a non-covalent inhibitor against SARS-3CLpro with potential broad-spectrum activity (Fig. 3a)15. We found (R)-16 to inhibit PEDV-3CLpro with an IC50 value of 25.4 \u00b1 1.4 \u03bcM, where the representative curve for (R)-16 inhibition of PEDV-3CLpro is shown in Fig. 3a and the data for (R)-16 inhibition of SARS-3CLpro has been previously published15. The previously reported IC50 of (R)-16 against SARS-3CLpro is 1.5 \u00b1 0.3 \u03bcM15, which indicates a ~17-fold weaker interaction of (R)-16 with PEDV-3CLpro. The inhibition of PEDV-3CLpro by (R)-16, though weak, is significant because it indicates that the development of non-covalent broad-spectrum inhibitors of 3CLpro\u2019s may be possible.",

The superposition shows that (R)-16 similarly occupies the S2-S1\u2032 subpockets in each of the 3CLpro active sites, where the tert-butyl amide resides in the channel leading to the active site, the tert-butylanilido group (P2) sits in the S2 pocket, the 3-pyridyl group (P1) resides in the S1 region, and the tetrahydrofuran (P1\u2032) occupies the S1\u2032 subsite (Fig. 3c,d).

This interaction is likely conserved in the inhibition of PEDV-3CLpro by (R)-16 as His162 of PEDV-3CLpro is in an almost identical structural location as that of SARS-3CLpro His163.

We were therefore curious if the difference in position of the S2 loop between PEDV- and SARS-3CLpro may be important for (R)-16 binding. A structural alignment of the ligand-bound structures of FIPV- and SARS-3CLpro (4ZRO and 3V3M, respectively) shows that compounds 6 and (R)-16 bind to the respective 3CLpro\u2019s by positioning their sterically bulky, hydrophobic groups in the S2 subsite (leucine and t-butylanilido, respectively; Fig. 4a). This suggests that hydrophobic interactions between the inhibitor or substrate and residues of the S2 loop are important for their binding.",

A sequence comparison of the S2 loops of FIPV-, TGEV-, NL63-, 229E-, PEDV-, and SARS-3CLpro shows that the SARS-3CLpro S2 loop is one residue longer than those from the alpha-coronaviruses and shares no sequence identity with FIPV-, TGEV-, NL63-, 229E- and PEDV-3CLpro (Fig. 4b). Additionally, the S2 loop of SARS-3CLpro contains anionic amino acids, Glu and Asp, at positions 47 and 48, respectively. These variations in the S2 loop between the alpha-coronavirus 3CLpro\u2019s and SARS-3CLpro may explain the large observed difference in the IC50 value of (R)-16 against PEDV-3CLpro as compared to SARS-3CLpro (25.4 \u00b1 1.4 \u03bcM vs. 1.5 \u00b1 0.3 \u03bcM, respectively). Furthermore, the combination of the increase in length and charge properties of the S2 loop of SARS-3CLpro relative to that of the alpha-coronavirus 3CLpro\u2019s likely changes the size and shape of the S2 binding pocket and therefore may allow for increased variability at the P2 site of inhibitor and substrate molecules.",

The S2-subsite residue preference is identical for PEDV- and SARS-3CLpro in most all cleavage sites, with the exception of nsp5/6 and nsp12/13. SARS-3CLpro can accommodate a larger P2-phenylalanine, e.g. at the nsp5/6 cleavage site, while PEDV-3CLpro recognizes residues only as large as a P2-leucine at this position in the polyprotein. At the nsp12/13 cleavage site, PEDV polyprotein 1ab has a serine at the P2 site, while SARS polyprotein 1ab has a P2-leucine. A larger size of the S2 pocket in SARS-3CLpro is consistent with the SARS polyprotein 1ab having a phenylalanine residue at the P2 position of the nsp5/6 cleavage site. This larger S2-pocket in SARS-3CLpro may allow for better binding of (R)-16, allowing the bulky t-butylanilido group to take full advantage of hydrophobic interactions within the S2 subsite and position (R)-16 to optimize hydrogen-bonding with SARS-3CLpro Gly143 and His163.",

We observed little difference between the active site architectures of unbound PEDV-3CLpro and the inhibitor-bound form of FIPV-3CLpro, except for differences in the position and composition of a loop comprising the S2 subsite, which was also observed in comparison to the 229E-3CLpro structure.",

Structural comparison of SARS-3CLpro bound with (R)-16 and PEDV-3CLpro in its unbound form revealed that the residues that directly interact with (R)-16 in SARS-3CLpro are conserved in PEDV-3CLpro. Additional analysis of the S2 loop across alpha-coronavirus 3CLpro\u2019s and SARS-3CLpro proved that the sequence identity of the S2 loop is not conserved across alpha- and beta-coronaviral 3CLpro\u2019s and the SARS-3CLpro S2 loop is one residue longer than that of the alpha-coronaviral 3CLpro\u2019s, which likely increases the effective volume of the SARS-3CLpro S2 protease subsite relative to the alpha-coronaviral 3CLpro S2 subsites.

The assays were carried out in triplicate using Costar 3694 EIA/RIA 96-Well half-area, flat bottom, black polystyrene plates from Corning Incorporated. 1 \u03bcL of 100X inhibitor stock in DMSO was added to 79 \u03bcL of enzyme in assay buffer and the enzyme-inhibitor mixture was incubated for 10 minutes. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 20 \u03bcL of 10 \u03bcM UIVT3 substrate, a custom synthesized F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer peptide substrate with the following sequence: HilyteFluorTM488-ESARLQSGLRKAK-QXL520TM-NH2, producing final concentrations of 100 nM for the 3CLpro enzyme and 2 \u03bcM UIVT3 substrate. The increase in fluorescence intensity of the reaction was then measured over a period of 10 minutes as relative fluorescence units (RFUt). An excitation wavelength of 485 (bandwidth of 20 nm) and an emission wavelength at 528 (bandwidth of 20 nm) was used to monitor the reactions using a BioTek Synergy H1 multimode microplate reader. The percent inhibition of the PEDV-3CLpro was determined using the following equation (1):",
