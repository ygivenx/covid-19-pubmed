New complications have however emerged as key issues within this population. HIV/ Hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection, for instance, affects more than 30% of HIV-infected patients in developed countries. Although the impact of HCV on HIV disease progression is minimal, it is known that HIV accelerates HCV-related liver disease [2, 3]. The effects of HIV on HCV infection include higher rate of viral persistence and increased HCV viral loads (VL). Studies have shown that HCV\u2013associated liver diseases such as fibrosis, cirrhosis and end stage liver disease (ESLD) are accelerated in HIV-infected individuals [4\u20137]. The mechanisms underlying rapid liver disease progression in HIV/HCV co-infected patients are likely multifactorial and are presently not completely understood.",

It is characterized by distortion of the liver architecture and the major determinant of morbidity and mortality in the patients with liver disease [8]. In many countries the degree of hepatic fibrosis is the principal determinant to access highly efficacious HCV treatment, known as direct acting antivirals [9]. Liver biopsy remains the gold standard for staging HCV-associated liver disease [10, 11]. However, liver biopsy can result in serious complications, is costly and not feasible to repeat serially, and is subject to sampling error [12]. These problems have prompted a search for non-invasive methods for liver fibrosis staging such as Fibroscan, a transient elastography technology which is based on the assessment of liver stiffness [13]. Several factors can limit this examination such as morbid obesity, ascites, and small intercostal spaces and better result are shown in patients with severe fibrosis [8, 14]. Safe, reliable and simple alternatives are needed to diagnose and monitor fibrosis caused by HCV infection.",

The baseline was subtracted using a setting of 15 times the expected peak width. Noise was subtracted at 2,000 Da for low-energy and at 10,000 Da for high-energy acquisition. All data were normalized by total ion current for either low intensity (2 to 100 kDa) or high intensity (10 to 200 kDa) using an external coefficient of 0.2. Spectra with normalization factors of more than double the mean were deleted. Analyses were performed in two steps. First, automated peak detection was applied, using cluster features of Biomarker Wizard software (Bio-Rad). Cluster with p values <0.05 (Mann-Whitney U test) were visually inspected, followed by manual peak relabeling. After relabeling, exact p values for differences in average peak intensity between two groups were calculated (Wilcoxon exact test): 1) negative population with F1 (no/mild fibrosis), 2) positive population with F3-F4 (significant fibrosis). Peaks with p values < 0.05 and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) values > 0.75 or < 0.25 were considered as potential biomarkers. Biomarker Pattern software (Bio-Rad) analysis was applied to the cleaned cluster data. This program uses a supervised pattern classification method (classification and regression tree (CART)) to identify peaks with the greatest contribution to discrimination between groups. The CART procedure seeks to minimize a cost function that balances prediction errors in either sense and the total number of biomarkers used. The relative importance of each peak in any given algorithm is measured by the order in which it is selected in the decision tree and the number of correct predictions credited to it. Similar analysis was performed to find discriminator peaks between the four stages of fibrosis (F0-1, F2, F3 and F4).",

Due to the difference in parameters (age and duration of HCV infection) between HCV mono-infected and HIV/HCV co-infected individuals, the spectra of each group were analyzed separately. Most biomarker programs focus on a single disease and have a dichotomous pattern (i.e. either positive or negative). Our primary comparison was non-fibrotic patients (F1) to more advanced fibrotic patients (F3-F4). Due to the relatively small number of samples in F4 group we pooled F3 and F4 groups together for analysis. Using Biomarker Wizard software, sixteen potential biomarkers with significant intensity difference and good area under curve (AUC) from ROC curve analysis were identified (Table 2). Six of these individual biomarkers were down-regulated in the group with advanced fibrosis, while eight were up-regulated with moderate changes between the two groups (1.33 to 2.55-fold). When we tested the ability of these 14 biomarkers to differentiate patients with regards to their stage of liver fibrosis (F1, F2, F3 and F4), 8 out of 14 had significant intensity differences with a p value < 0.01. The three biomarkers demonstrating the most significant difference in expression (6.4, 9.3 and 66.6 k(m/z)) are shown in Fig 1. The cumulative data illustrate how changes in multiple protein biomarkers can be used as \u201cfingerprints\u201d reflective of a particular disease state. Similar analysis was performed with HCV mono-infected samples. Fourteen classifiers with significant intensity differences between F1 and F3-4 were identified (S1 Table).

To evaluate the possible influence of HIV disease activity on these biomarkers, we assessed the correlation between these biomarkers and the markers of HIV progression (HIV RNA and CD4 counts). Except for the peak at 22.8 k(m/z), which was correlated with HIV RNA, no other correlation was observed (S2 Fig). Using the same 4 biomarkers we created a new algorithm to try to differentiate individual states of liver fibrosis (F1, F2, F3 and F4) in co-infected individuals. The decision tree only achieved 59.0% (49/83) accuracy demonstrating that our algorithms can quite reliably diagnose patients with significant fibrosis (vs. non-fibrotic) but are much less accurate for distinguishing between the middle stages of fibrosis.",

Several studies have reported that co-infected individuals progress more rapidly to ESLD than mono infected individuals [4\u20137]. Therefore, it is possible that biomarkers we observed in co-infection are, in fact, markers for accelerated fibrosis.

It is important to emphasize that, even though we have detected biomarkers that can be used to stage liver fibrosis in mono- and co-infected individuals, we cannot affirm that these biomarkers are specific for HCV-induced fibrosis. In order to establish specificity, we will need to validate our algorithms with non-HCV liver anomalies such as alcoholic liver disease, hepatitis B-induced fibrosis or HCC. It is very likely that several of our candidate biomarkers are \u2018general\u2019 markers for liver damage since most are liver-derived and some have already been found in liver infection [21].

Extending its use does not depend on identification of the proteins in the discriminating peaks. However, protein identification is still possible, and adds biological relevance to the findings. We were able to identify, Ig kappa chain C region, haptoglobin, a truncated form of ApoA1 and plasminogen. It is interesting to observe that most of these proteins have already being identified as biomarkers for fibrosis. For example, the Fibrotest is based on haptoglobin, alpha-2 macroglobulin, gamma globulin, ApoA1, gamma glutamyl transferase and total bilirubin measurement in serum specimens [36]. Ig kappa C region is known to be a good biomarker for inflammation and malignancy [37], it is a predictor of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma in patients with HIV [38] and patients with HCV [39]. Our data demonstrate that using SELDI-TOF MS technology we could stage discrete levels of liver fibrosis as changes of intensity of these biomarkers are detected. Even when we used peaks from already known markers, we weren\u2019t able to obtain an optimal algorithm compare to the unidentified peaks.",

In addition, Yang et al [41] found complement C4-a and inter-alpha-trypsin inhibition to heavy chain H4, as biomarker candidates for predicting hepatic fibrosis using Isobaric Tags for Relative and Absolute Quantitation (iTRAQ) and differential gel electrophoresis (DIGE). The authors also found ApoA1, Ig kappa chain C region, haptoglobin and others as potential biomarker candidates. However, this study only included pooled serum samples of 24 people with chronic HCV and 6 non-infected individuals. Using SELDI-TOF MS serum profiling, Schwelgle et al [23] found 4 biomarkers (5.8, 8.9, 9.5 and 11.7 k(m/z)) that helped differentiate between healthy controls and HCC patients. In this study, they did not fractionate samples but they concentrated on low-mass proteins that have a metal-binding affinity. Our study differs significantly in that we only tested HCV infected individuals, we looked at high- and low-mass proteins after fractionation of the samples and we used 3 different types of ProteinChips (metal binding, weak cation exchange, and hydrophobic/reverse-phase).",

It would be interesting to see if by scaling each biomarker and adding to obtain a score, we could accomplish a better correlation with the stage of liver fibrosis in these patients. The CCC study has enrolled co-infected individuals since 2003. We are in the process of studying longitudinal changes of these biomarkers in co-infected individuals during the progression of fibrosis. In addition, we wonder if these biomarkers may vary after treatment of HCV infection as it has been shown with other markers [42, 43].",
