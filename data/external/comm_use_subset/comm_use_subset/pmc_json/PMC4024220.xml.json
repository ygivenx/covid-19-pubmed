The transition begins with a fall in the death rate, mainly from acute infectious diseases of childhood. As a higher proportion of children survive to adulthood, parents choose to have smaller families, but the decline in fertility lags behind the decline in mortality. Through time, infectious diseases of childhood are replaced by the chronic, non-infectious diseases typical of adulthood in larger, older populations. In Western Europe, North America and other parts of the industrialized world, this transition has taken place over centuries. In some low- and middle-income countries, such as Mexico, there have been substantial reductions in mortality and fertility in just a few decades (figure 1) [2].\n",

Worldwide, the number of deaths caused by pathogens and parasites is falling slowly (figure 2a). In 1990, an estimated 16 million people died from infections (plus maternal and nutritional disorders). In 2010, the number of deaths had fallen only to 15 million (a decline of only 1% per year). And the World Health Organization (WHO) forecasts 13 million deaths attributed to these causes in 2050 [3]. The fall in the number of people who died between 1990 and 2010 was small, because the drop in mortality per capita (\u221253%) was offset by population growth (47%) [4]. The majority of these deaths have been and will be caused by just a few pathogens: among the 1400 or so recognized human pathogens and parasites [5], two-thirds of deaths from infections in 2010 were caused by around 20 species, mainly bacteria and viruses (figure 2b). Set against the slow rate of decline in deaths from infections, the number due to non-infectious diseases has been steadily rising: there were 31 million deaths from non-infectious causes (including injuries) in 1990 and 43 million in 2010 (an increase of 1.6% per year). That number is expected to rise to 83 million in 2050 [3].\n",

This large injection of cash from wealthy countries has supported all areas of health, but particularly the control of HIV/AIDS, malaria and TB. It has led to a proliferation of donors, global funds and partnerships, non-governmental and civil society organizations, philanthropists and commercial investors, and heightened interest from the pharmaceutical industry [11]. Within the past decade, domestic expenditure on health per capita has also increased in virtually all countries [12]. This period of rapid expansion has now ended, but a return to the funding patterns of the 1990s seems unlikely.\n",

The 10 million HIV-positive people receiving ART in 2012 represented only two-thirds of the 15 million targeted [13]. Drugs to treat helminth infections have been donated in large quantities by pharmaceutical companies, and yet the proportion of eligible children receiving treatment is still far below target.

Under-nutrition increases the risk of TB by approximately 14% for every unit reduction in body mass index (BMI) [38] (left side of the triangle in figure 4). Individuals with greater BMI are less likely to develop active TB, even to the point of obesity (base of triangle). But overweight is a risk factor for diabetes, which is also associated with a higher risk of TB [39,40] (right side of triangle). The biological basis of these interactions is not fully understood. The implication, however, is that better nutrition and the management of diabetes could contribute to the prevention of TB. Reciprocally, the clinical management of TB presents an opportunity to identify people who are undernourished or who have diabetes. To illustrate, if the prevalence of diabetes in a population is 10% and the relative risk for TB among diabetics is 3, then the prevalence of diabetes among TB cases will be (0.1 \u00d7 3)/[1 + 0.1 \u00d7 (3\u20131)] = 0.25. So, 25% of TB cases come from 10% of the population. The interaction is a chance to improve the efficiency of both infectious and non-infectious disease control programmes [41\u201343].\n",

For instance, the large-scale delivery of single-administration medicines by non-medical personnel (teachers, volunteers and community drug distributors) for the control of neglected tropical diseases [76] is an innovative approach in primary healthcare, based on practical and socially acceptable methods [77]. Similarly, the supervision and treatment of cohorts of TB patients on long-term therapy has inspired a similar approach for chronic, non-infectious diseases such as diabetes [78].",
