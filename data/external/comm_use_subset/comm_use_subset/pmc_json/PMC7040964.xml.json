            "text": "Influenza A viruses (IAVs) circulate in waterfowl as their natural reservoir and are categorized based on the antigenic properties of their hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins. There are 16 different HAs and nine different NA present in wild birds.1 Frequently, wild birds infect poultry resulting in the culling of millions of birds and significant economic losses. However, wild birds rarely show disease symptoms while IAV in poultry usually exhibits respiratory tropism and is able to mutate into a more highly pathogenic form.2 Influenza is also a zoonotic disease, and the virus is occasionally transmitted from infected poultry to humans. Certain HA/NA combinations, however, seem to be more favorable for human infections. H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2 have caused several devastating outbreaks in humans in the past such as the 1918 \u201cSpanish flu,\u201d the 1957 \u201cAsian pandemic,\u201d the 1968 \u201cHong Kong pandemic,\u201d and the 2009 \u201cSwine flu,\u201d respectively.3\n",

Low\u2010pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) H7N9 was first discovered in humans in 2013 in China when three patients were hospitalized with severe and fatal influenza.4 Since then, there have been six epidemic H7N9 waves that resulted in 1567 laboratory\u2010confirmed human infections and 615 deaths and a seventh wave is currently ongoing.5 Intriguingly, the virus isolated from the 2013 outbreak was suggested to be derived from chickens that did not show any (or only very mild) symptoms of disease. Further investigations revealed that the viral genes were exclusively from avian origin.4 To this date, there are no reports of H7N9 human to human transmissions even though it cannot be excluded in very few cases. However, most cases of human H7N9 infections were attributed to exposure of humans to infected wild birds or poultry and live animal markets.5\n",

            "text": "A crucial step in the life cycle of H7N9 (and all other influenza subtypes) is the cleavage of its HA fusion protein by host proteases. HA is synthesized as a precursor and requires proteolytic processing to exert its fusogenic activity. Cleavage occurs at the C\u2010terminus of the fusion peptide and results in its exposure allowing HA to induce fusion of the viral and cellular membrane and subsequent release of the RNA into the host cell.6, 7 LPAI viruses have a monobasic cleavage site that consists of a single arginine, which is preceded by three amino acids that are influenza subtype\u2010specific. While LPAI viruses in wild birds are usually cleaved by trypsin in their gastro\u2010intestinal tract, there are trypsin\u2010like serine proteases in humans and poultry that reside in the respiratory tract and which are able to process these viruses. Therefore, the disease is usually confined to this tissue.8\n",

Previously, it was reported that the type II transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 plays a role in the cleavage of H7N9 HA and activation of the virus in mice.9, 10 Both studies showed that TMPRSS2 knockout (KO) mice were highly tolerant to H7N9 infections. When KO mice were complemented with human or mouse TMPRSS2, their susceptibility to the virus was restored.9 We recently reported that human matriptase/ST 14 was able to very efficiently cleave a H7N9 cleavage motif peptide mimic.11 Matriptase/ST 14 is a membrane\u2010bound protease localized in epithelial cells of various tissues in humans that seems to play a significant role in the activation of various influenza A subtypes such H1N1 and H9N2.12, 13 However, results obtained using cleavage site peptide mimics do not always reflect the in vivo situation and need to be validated.11, 14\n",

However, it requires the information by which proteases distinct influenza HA subtypes are proteolytically activated.",

However, the mice still exhibited low titers of virus several days post\u2010infection suggesting that other proteases are able to cleave LPAI H7N9 HA. Our data strongly suggest that matriptase/ST 14 has a major role in cleaving LPAI H7N9. The fact that TMPRSS2 KO mice did not show clinical signs of disease may not translate to human infections since there is no evidence that TMPRSS2 is the sole enzyme responsible for the spread of the virus in humans. Matriptase/ST 14 has been identified as one of the important host proteases cleaving HA directly in a subtype\u2010specific manner or indirectly by activating HA\u2010processing zymogens.12, 13, 14 To date, there are reports demonstrating matriptase/ST 14\u2010mediated cleavage of H1N1 and H9N2 HA.

We analyzed 1352 LPAI H7N9 sequences from human isolates collected between 2013 and 2019 that are available at the GISAID database (https://platform.gisaid.org/epi3/frontend#1001b7). Only seven sequences showed changes in the HA cleavage site motif; six strains exhibited a K to R substitution in the P3 position, and one strain had a K to Q change at the P3 position, too (data not shown). This emphasizes that requirements for virus activation largely remain the same even though antigenically different strains have evolved over the past 6 years. However, we have no data to predict if matriptase/ST 14 would be able to proteolytically process these changed cleavage sites.",

A limitation of this assay is that peptides may produce false\u2010positive results because the structural interaction between protease and cleavage site might be altered compared to the full\u2010length HA protein. Matriptase/ST 14, for example, was reported to proteolytically process the A/Aichi/2/68 H3N2 HA cleavage site motif in peptide assays.12, 14 When matriptase/ST 14 was then tested with the A/Aichi/2/68 H3N2 HA full\u2010length protein expressed in cells, only little cleavage that did not produce fusogenic HA or no cleavage was observed. Here we demonstrate that human matriptase/ST 14 cleaves H7N9 HA expressed in cells resulting in a fully fusogenic active protein validating our results from the previously published peptide assay. Matriptase/ST 14\u2010mediated cleavage of H7N9 HA also promoted the infectivity of pseudovirions and A/Shanghai/2/2013 virus in cell culture. Our data indicate that human matriptase/ST 14 is a relevant protease to cause LPAI H7N9 infectivity in humans and may represent an important pathogenicity determinant and target for therapeutic intervention.",
