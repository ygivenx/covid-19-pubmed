            "text": "The consequences of annual influenza outbreaks are often underestimated by the general public. This circumstance may be due in part to a large proportion of healthy young adults experiencing only minor symptoms [1], which has contributed to a lack of public awareness and complacency regarding the severity of its effects on vulnerable populations such as the elderly and individuals that are immunocompromised. Despite this misconception, influenza poses a serious public health threat around the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that annual influenza epidemics cause 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness worldwide, along with 250,000 to 500,000 annual deaths [2]. These epidemics are also associated with overwhelmed clinics and hospitals, many of which need to account for increased staff absenteeism and productivity losses due to illness of health care workers (HCWs) [2].",

During the influenza seasons of 2010\u20132012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that influenza vaccination helped reduce children's risk of influenza-related intensive care unit admissions by 74 % [4]. The use of vaccinations has also been associated with a 77 % reduction in influenza-related hospitalization among adults aged 50 or over [5]. In addition, rates of influenza infections were found to be lower in vaccinated HCWs versus unvaccinated HCWs [6] and other healthy adults [7]. However, while vaccination may reduce the risk of influenza in HCWs, a recent systematic review reported the reduced risk to be less than 50 % as compared to HCWs who are not vaccinated; which suggests the need for additional solutions beyond HCW vaccinations [6]. Furthermore, recent reviews highlight the lack of clear evidence to support the benefit of vaccinating HCWs [8] to prevent the spread of influenza to elderly [1].",

For example, in Canada, voluntary uptake of the seasonal influenza vaccine by HCWs remains below the 90 % recommended level [12] and varies substantially across health care organizations [13]. Other studies have reported that in some locations more than 50 % of physicians also fail to take advantage of the annual influenza vaccination [13]. Inadequate levels of HCW immunization can place the vulnerable populations they care for at greater risk of health complications [14].",

For instance, the attitudes of HCWs in the United States toward whether to be vaccinated against influenza or not remains divided, prompting a backlash against suggestions of any mandatory policies [15]. Surveys have revealed multiple reasons why HCWs disapprove of mandated vaccination. These include beliefs that the decision to be vaccinated is personal, fears of side effects, and concern that influenza vaccines are ineffective [15]. There have also been legal obstacles to mandating vaccination as worker unions and professional associations have argued that such policies violate individual rights and freedoms [16]. Specifically, in Canada, it has been argued that mandated immunization violates one's right to refuse unwanted medical treatment under section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms [16].",

Through the use of relevant frameworks, theories, or models, policy analysis can provide a greater understanding of the various processes involved and, in turn, enhance the likelihood of recognizing and seizing opportunities for new policies to be adopted [17]. In this vein, Kingdon\u2019s [18] three process streams framework helps to explain how three elements or \u201cstreams\u201d\u2014problems, politics, and policies\u2014affect policy agenda setting dynamics. Kingdon argues that, while there is some interplay among the streams, they are largely independent of one another [18]. This framework can be used to explain how issues may make their way onto the government\u2019s decision agenda, which is a key step in the policy adoption process. The purpose of this paper is to identify the likelihood of adopting a policy for mandatory immunization of HCWs in Ontario based on a historical review of barriers to the agenda setting process.",

All individuals who live, work, or attend school in the province, and are 6 months of age or older, are covered by the program [20]. In recent years, UIIP has increased the accessibility of vaccinations by making them available at a variety of locations such as employer-sponsored clinics and pharmacies [20].",

Additionally, reductions in the number of hospitalizations have helped decrease the costs of health care services by 52 % [21]. As a result of changes brought about by UIIP, Ontario exceeded the target coverage rate of 70 % among the elderly in 2005, which surpassed rates from other Canadian provinces and the United States [22]. Despite broad public acceptance and substantial participation in the voluntary immunization program, pockets of HCW resistance persisted (politics stream), and outbreaks in long-term care facilities and hospitals continued to occur, resulting in preventable illness and death [23]. As a consequence, Ontario\u2019s MOHLTC attempted to promote voluntary vaccination of HCWs by requiring health care facilities to report vaccination rates [24].",
