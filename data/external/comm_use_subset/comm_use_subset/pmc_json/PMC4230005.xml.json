Abo-Elkhier introduced a 3D graphical representation of protein sequence based on a right cone of a unit base and unit height on protein sequences interfaces [30]. El-Lakkani and El-Sherif [31] proposed a graphical representation of protein sequence to help similarity analysis of protein sequences based on 2D and 3D amino acid adjacency matrices. Ma et al.

Comparing with the alignment methods, existing graphical representation methods can also display the inner structure of the protein sequences and can be utilized to find the similarity/dissimilarity more visible according to their graphics.

And, in addition, to validate the effectiveness of our ADLD based method, we adopt it to analyze the similarity/dissimilarity of both the 16 different ND5 proteins and the 29 different spike proteins, respectively, which are widely used as the test data [16\u201326].

            "text": "In this paper, a novel ADLDs based graphical representation of protein sequences is proposed, which is utilized to analyze the similarity/dissimilarity of protein sequences. To validate the performances of the new method, we select two groups of well-known protein sequences as examples, and, additionally, in order to observe the similarity/dissimilarity of protein sequences more intuitively, we construct the phylogenetic trees of protein sequences. The results show that our ADLDs based method not only has good performances and effects in the similarity/dissimilarity analysis of protein sequences but also does not require complex computation, since there are no high dimensional matrixes required. Therefore, it means that our ADLDs based method can work well in the analysis of protein sequences.",
