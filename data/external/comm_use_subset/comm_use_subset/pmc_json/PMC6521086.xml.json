            "text": "Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes and it is an important growing human health concern in many countries, causing significant outbreaks of acute febrile illness and long-term arthropathy [1]. Its origins are traced to Africa as an enzootic spillover, belonging to the Semliki Forest Complex of the Alphavirus (Togaviridae) [2] and was first isolated from a human patient in Tanzania in 1952 [3]. It currently exists as four lineages. The two African enzootic lineages are the West African (WA) and the East Central South Africa (ECSA) lineages. The additional two lineages originated from the ECSA lineage and are called the Asian and the recently emerged Indian Ocean lineage [1,4,5,6]. CHIKV is composed of a positive, single-stranded genomic RNA of 12 kilobases, encoding four non-structural (ns) and five structural (s) proteins [7,8]. The non-structural proteins, nsP1, nsP2, nsP3 and nsP4, are required for virus replication [9]. A sub-genomic RNA encodes the structural proteins: capsid (C), E3, E2, 6k and E1, and thus a polyprotein is produced which is then processed by the capsid auto-proteinase and signalases [10]. The CHIKV surface is mainly composed by E1\u2013E2 heterodimers [11] where E1 glycoproteins mediate fusion [12] and E2 glycoproteins interact with the host receptor [13]. Since its discovery the virus has spread to Asia, Oceania/Pacific, Europe, and mostly recently to the Americas, where there have been more than a million reported cases since its detection in late 2013 [14,15,16,17], whilst major outbreaks continue to be recorded in the Asian and African continents. Although chikungunya vaccines have been under development for several decades, no licensed option is yet available and CHIKV still causes substantial morbidity, overwhelming public health systems and contributing to poverty [18]. In the meantime, current control strategies rely on reducing human exposure to potentially infected mosquito vectors. Several institutions are now engaged in the development of a safe and cost-effective CHIKV vaccine; such vaccines [18,19,20] are based on live-attenuated or inactivated CHIKV, chimeric CHIKV, DNA, subunit, virus-like particle (VLP) and viral-vectored platforms. They are mainly designed to induce humoral responses against the structural viral protein E2, as well as E1, due to strong correlates of protection with neutralising antibodies against structural CHIKV proteins in asymptomatic cases [21]. In addition to that, passive transfer of sera from convalescent humans to mice prevented infection [21] whilst neutralising antibodies against E1 and E2 were able to protect immunocompromised mice [22]. In humans, an early IgG3 neutralising response is associated with reduced clinical symptoms [23] and asymptomatic cases have been associated with high neutralising antibody titres [24]. Here, we describe the design and development of CHIKV vaccines based on the clinically relevant adenoviral vector, ChAdOx1 and the Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) platforms [25,26,27,28,29]. Viral vector expression of the sCHIKV proteins is able to form chikungunya viral particles, thus mimicking a real exposure of CHIKV, whilst being an in silico designed mosaic protein, aiming to represent all four CHIKV lineages. In mice, ChAdOx1 vaccines candidates expressing sCHIKV antigens are able to induce strong humoral and cellular responses upon a single and non-adjuvanted immunisation approach. Importantly, we present evidence of in vitro neutralising activity in sera from vaccinated mice. Finally, whilst durability of humoral responses was achieved upon a single immunisation, MVA vaccines expressing sCHIKV were produced to be used as an alternative heterologous booster regime (ChAdOx1/MVA), in order to increase neutralising antibody titres. Taken together, a viral vectored vaccine for CHIKV, based on the ChAdOx1 platform is a good candidate for further pre-clinical and clinical studies.",

A neighbour-joining tree was created which identified three distinct clades (A, B, C; Figure 1a). Subsequently conservation was assessed within each clade (intra-clade; Figure 1b) using a sliding window approach, in which a conservation value between 0 and 1 was assigned, 0 being fully conserved. Anything lower than the first quartile (Q1) was classed as conserved. Lastly, the number of windows conserved across each clade and the degree of conservation were identified and used to create a normalised mosaic consensus. Figure 1c illustrates the level of shared conservation between clades, from 0 to -100, with -100 being fully conserved. The resulting sequence mosaic sCHIKV was synthesised (Figure 2a). We constructed chimpanzee adenoviral vector vaccines expressing the full structural cassette (ChAdOx1 sCHIKV), the capsid-deleted structural cassette (ChAdOx1 sCHIKV \u2206C) and a non-structural sequence from CHIKV (ChadOx1 NS), the latter being used as a control vaccine (Figure 2b). In addition, Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) viral-vector was used to construct the MVA sCHIKV, the MVA sCHIKV \u2206C and the control MVA NS (Figure 2c).",

            "text": "After cloning and production of ChAdOx1 vaccines encoding the genomic sCHIKV cassette, we verified the formation of adenoviral particles by transmission electron microscopy (Figure 3a). Because it has been described that cellular expression of the full structural CHIKV cassette is capable to self-assemble VLPs for CHIKV, as well as for other alphaviruses [34,35,36,37], we collected supernatant from HEK293 cells expressing the sCHIKV antigen. The supernatant was then subjected to sucrose gradient showing a characteristic sedimentation band, which is representative of VLP accumulation (Figure 3b, left). Further electron microscopy preparations revealed particles of approximately 70 nm in size (Figure 3b, right), which resembled wild-type CHIKV particles. Alternatively, we transduced Vero cells with ChAdOx1 sCHIKV and ChAdOx1 sCHIKV \u2206C, and verified their expression in cells and supernatants. Specific detection was achieved by western blot, using an anti-CHIKV mice serum and an anti-E1 monoclonal antibody (Figure 3c,d, respectively). In cells transduced with ChAdOx1 sCHIKV, we detected bands at approximately 55 kDa in the supernatants (Figure 3c, lane 1,2,3), with a band of approximately 35 kDa only in the concentrated supernatant (Figure 3c, lane 3). In cellular extracts, we detected specific bands of 35 and 18 kDa (Figure 3c, lane 4). In cells transduced with ChAdOx1 sCHIKV \u2206C we also detected bands at approximately 55 kDa in supernatants (Figure 3c, lane 5,6,7), but no bands of 50 kDa or 18 kDa were found in the concentrated supernatant nor in the cell extracts. Therefore, it is suggested that the 35 kDa or 18 kDa band may represent the capsid protein, as previously demonstrated [38], which are not present in ChAdOx1 sCHIKV \u2206C-transduced cells. As a positive control, we used a commercially available CHIKV E1 protein (Figure 3c, lane 9); therefore, it is suggested that the 55 kDa band detected in our blots is E1 protein. In addition, a western blot was performed using a monoclonal antibody against CHIKV E1 (Figure 3d); we detected a specific band in the positive control E1 protein (lane 9), as well as a 55 kDa band in all the supernatant fractions from both ChAdOx1 sCHIKV- and ChAdOx1 sCHIKV \u2206C-transduced cells. No signal in cell extracts was detected (Figure 3d, lane 4,8), probably due to conformational epitope masking. Taken together, our results suggest that our adenoviral-vectors are able to express the sCHIKV antigens which are able to induce the formation of chikungunya viral-like particles. Thus, we aim to mimic a real antigen exposure of CHIKV particles.",

Two weeks after immunisation, T cell responses were quantified by ex vivo IFN\u03b3 ELISpot, using a specific pool of overlapping peptides spanning the full CHIKV structural cassette, as well as a pool of overlapping peptides related to the control NS vaccines (Figure 4). BALB/c mice receiving vaccines encoding sCHIKV antigens showed high T cell frequencies after stimulation with the sCHIKV peptide pool (ChAdOx1 sCHIKV = mean of 6013 spot-forming cells (SFC)/106 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and ChAdOx1 sCHIKV \u2206C = mean of 6,422 SFC/106 PBMCs); with no statistical difference between both groups, using one-way ANOVA analysis (Figure 4a). The control group ChAdOx1 NS showed low specific T cell responses against the NS peptide pool and no responses to specific sCHIKV peptide pool. In addition, we analysed the responses towards specific peptide sub-pools for C, E3, E2, 6K, E1 and NS (Figure 4b). sCHIKV peptide deconvolution ELISpot allowed the identification of an immunodominant region located in the 6K region which is induced upon ChAdOx1 sCHIKV and ChAdOx1 sCHIKV \u2206C vaccination (4,325 and 5,177 SFC/106 PBMCs, respectively). As expected, we detected specific cellular responses towards the capsid in animals vaccinated with ChAdOx1 sCHIKV (mean=984 SFC/106 PBMCs) in comparison with those animals vaccinated with ChAdOx1 sCHIKV \u2206C in which low background responses were recorded (Figure 4b). Modest responses were detected in PBMCs against the E2 and E1 peptide pools. Taken together, we conclude that a single injection of ChAdOx1 sCHIKV or ChAdOx1 sCHIKV \u2206C is immunogenic and able to induce specific T cell responses in BALB/c mice.",

We performed ELISA assays to identify the immunogenic properties of ChAdOx1 sCHIKV and ChAdOx1 sCHIKV \u2206C, upon a single and unadjuvanted vaccination strategy (Figure 5A). Two weeks after a ChAdOx1 sCHIKV or ChAdOx1 sCHIKV \u2206C vaccination, specific IgG antibody binding to CHIKV E2 protein was detected in sera from vaccinated animals (Figure 5A, left). Six weeks after prime (Figure 5A, right) all the animals increased the levels of OD405 binding to the E2 protein. Of particular interest, 10 months after a single immunisation, sera from vaccinated animals showed specific IgG antibody binding to CHIKV E2, similar to that of six weeks prime group (Figure 5A, bottom). ChAdOx1 NS was used as control as it does not generate antibody responses towards the sCHIKV antigens. Log reciprocal antibody titre analysis (Figure 5b) showed that levels of anti-E2 antibodies increased over time for both ChAdOx1 sCHIKV or ChAdOx1 sCHIKV \u2206C prime-vaccinated animals and remarkably they were maintained after 10 months upon a single vaccination strategy. Interestingly, our results indicated that the deletion of capsid in the ChAdOx1 sCHIKV \u2206C- vaccinated group did not impair the ability to elicit anti-E2 CHIKV antibody titres. Finally, Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) viral-vector technology has been shown to be a potent booster of immune responses [39,40]. Therefore, we have constructed MVA sCHIKV and MVA sCHIKV \u2206C to test their boosting immunogenic potential in a prime-boost heterologous strategy. Mice immunised with either ChAdOx1 sCHIKV or ChAdOx1 sCHIKV \u2206C were boosted with MVA sCHIKV and MVA sCHIKV \u2206C at six weeks after prime, respectively; and sera was collected two weeks after boost. Prime-boost vaccinated mice showed high endpoint titters of >4 of anti IgG-E2 antibodies (Figure 5b, Prime-Boost section). MVA NS was used as control to boost animals vaccinated with ChAdOx1 NS vaccines. Taken together, we conclude that a single vaccination with no adjuvant strategy is able to induce early, specific and long-lasting B responses in BALB/c mice towards CHIKV-E2 protein.",

The method we used is based on the virus replicon particle-based (VRP) chikungunya virus neutralisation assay to determine NT50 values [33]. Na\u00efve and control ChAdOx1 NS sera were included alongside the assay. At two weeks post-vaccination, sera from the ChAdOx1 sCHIKV- and ChAdOx1 sCHIKV \u2206C-vaccinated groups showed high neutralisation activity against VRP CHIKV with a NT50 titre of 5.39x103 and 3.18 x103 respectively (Figure 6a). In a prime-boost regime (Figure 6b), ChAdOx1 sCHIKV/MVA sCHIKV showed a further 2.8-fold increase of the NT50 titter (1.53x104), in comparison to the prime vaccination regime of ChAdOx1 sCHIKV. A similar increase of NT50 titre was found in the sera from mice vaccinated with a prime-boost ChAdOx1 sCHIKV \u2206C/MVA sCHIKV \u2206C, with a 6-fold increase (1.87x104), when compared to that of the NT50 titre from single ChAdOx1 sCHIKV \u2206C vaccinated animals (Figure 6b). These results indicate that when the capsid is deleted from the CHIKV structural genes, a decrease in the antibody NT50 titre is observed, upon a single ChAdOx1 vaccination. Conversely, when a prime-boost regime is used, the deletion of the capsid is beneficial to increase the CHIKV NT50 antibody titres. Taken together, our results confirm that our viral-vectored vaccines elicit functional neutralising antibodies against CHIKV-infective particles, tested by an in vitro model.",

            "text": "In this work we have constructed CHIKV vaccines based on viral-vector platforms, such as ChAdOx1 and MVA vectors. The immunogen was designed based on a mosaic consensus sequence from the Asian, East, Central and South African and West African regions. Although individual strains are antigenically related and CHIKV vaccines previously reported have been developed using heterologous strains [34], a mosaic-based approach ensures a high coverage aimed at raising neutralising antibodies against all variants circulating worldwide. Here, we have developed two different vaccine immunogen candidates: a vaccine encoding the full structural CHIKV polyprotein (sCHIKV) and a vaccine in which the capsid antigen was deleted (sCHIKV \u2206C). One of the functions of the capsid is to auto-cleave from the E3-E2-6K-E1 polyprotein. This proteolytic process exposes a signal leader which is contained in the amino-terminal region of E3 and promotes the entry of the polyprotein into the endoplasmic reticulum [41]. There are several advantages in comparing these two different antigenic cassettes. Genetic vaccines, such as DNA vaccines, RNA vaccines, and viral-vectored vaccines, are often limited by the number of nucleotides that can be inserted into the antigenic cassette. Exploring the minimum sequence length able to induce immunogenicity and efficacy (either by in vitro neutralisation or by sterile protection after a viral challenge), will inform the vaccine development of new generation of vaccine candidates against CHIKV. In addition, optimising the minimum number of genetic antigens could allow the inclusion of further antigens to create combined vaccines (either homologous or heterologous) to induce immune response against different pathogens, all in a single genetic vaccine approach. Based on this assumption, efforts are underway to create ChAdOx1 vaccines expressing shorter versions of the CHIKV polyprotein, such as E2 and E1 proteins from CHIKV and other alphaviruses. E2 protein is involved in receptor recognition, while E1 protein is involved in membrane fusion [12,13]. Therefore, exploring single-protein CHIKV vaccines in ChAdOx1 or in other viral-vectored platforms seems feasible and promising, since anti-E2 and anti-E1 antibodies are high in convalescent CHIKV-immune populations [21]. However, ensuring proper antigenic folding in such developments, identical or similar to those antigenic structures in virions from CHIKV is paramount. Here, we have demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy, that our adenoviral vaccine ChAdOx1 sCHIKV is capable of expressing chikungunya-VLPs, which promotes the correct conformational antigens to be presented upon vaccination, therefore mimicking a real exposure to wild-type CHIKV. It will be interesting to explore and compare the neutralisation efficacy between encoded chikungunya-VLPs, E2 or E1 proteins in viral-vectored vaccines.",

Our data shows that the T cell immunogenicity elicited by ChAdOx1 sCHIKV and ChAdOx1 sCHIKV \u2206C is directed primarily to a peptide region located in the 6K protein, by IFN-\u03b3 production. It will be interesting to explore the development of T-cell based vaccines against CHIKV. The role of T cell immunity in alphavirus infection, especially in CHIKV is not very well understood. Importantly, antigen design and the modulation of its intracellular expression will play a major role at inducing T cell responses directed to the antigen. A clear example is the comparison between CHIKV and CHIKV \u2206C ELISpots, in which T cell responses directed to capsid were detected in the CHIKV groups but it was ablated in the CHIKV \u2206C groups. It will be interesting to explore the protective and immunological relevance of the T cell response directed by the capsid in pre-clinical models. Although we identified 6k as the immunodominant region in BALB/c, this observation may differ in other inbred or outbred mouse strains; or in the case that vaccines comprise only E3, E2 or E1 antigens. For example, CHIKV-specific CD8+T cells were directed mainly against E1 and E2 proteins in C57Bl6 mice [42,43,44]. T cells induced after CHIKV infection in C57BL/6 mice were not essential to control viremia but CD4 T cells were involved in CHIKV pathology [45]. Furthermore, T cell adoptive transfer did not confer protection against CHIKV challenge [46]. Finally, T cell responses in human CHIKV infection is also poorly understood. T cell responses (CD8+ > CD4+) have been found in chronic and convalescent CHIKV patients [47], in which specific responses were detected for E2, capsid and ns protein 1 (nsP1). Further studies using CHIKV challenge models would be informative to further dissect the role of cellular responses in protective efficacy using ours or other vaccine platforms.",

E2 protein has been shown to be a primary target for neutralising antibodies, since E2 functions for recognition and attachment to cellular receptors. Here, we have demonstrated that our vaccines are able to mount anti-E2 antibody responses. The level of antibody responses after a single immunisation of ChAdOx1 sCHIKV or ChAdOx1 sCHIKV \u2206C were maintained for up to 10 months, highlighting the suitability of our vaccine approach to promote long-lasting immune responses against CHIKV. Nonetheless, we have tested a boosting strategy using MVA chikungunya vaccines to further increase the anti-E2 antibody titres.",

Here we utilised a widely used neutralisation assay, using a non-infectious CHIKV particle which is fully capable of packing CHIKV replicon RNA, which carries the Gaussia Luciferase (Gluc) gene located in the subgenomic RNA region [33]. Therefore, infected cells secreting Gluc can be detected as a surrogate detection of CHIKV infection. In this study, we tested a rather early time-point after a ChAdOx1 sCHIKV or a ChAdOx1 sCHIKV \u2206C prime vaccination, with the hope to demonstrate efficacy of neutralisation after two weeks post-vaccination, as vaccines should be aimed to guarantee protection in a shortest window of time between vaccination and pathogen exposure.",

Since the NT assay presented here has been used in several vaccine development studies for CHIKV, we are able to afford a comparative assessment between our NT50 titters and other vaccine developments. Garcia-Arriaza et al. reported a MVA-CHIKV vaccine expressing the full structural cassette, in which the mean of NT50 titters were <103 in a 6-week prime post-immunisation strategy [44]. Halleng\u00e4rd et al., developed an attenuated CHIKV vaccines in which they achieved >104 when using the vaccine \u22065NsP3 [48,49]. Finally, CHIKV neutralisation titres have been assessed in human sera yielding NT50 titres of 2.6x104, 1.8x104 and 1x104 in three different CHIKV patients returning from Mauritius, La Reunion and Seychelles, [33,50] respectively. Therefore, the mean of the NT50 titres we have achieved in both prime (>103) and prime-boost regimes (>104) reflect the capacity of our viral-vectored vaccines to induce physiologically relevant NT50 titres.",

Another development consists of a recombinant live attenuated measles virus (MV) expressing surface CHIKV antigens [52]. The vaccine was immunogenic and safe in humans, but it also requires >2 doses. Regarding adenoviral vectors, only one human adenovirus expressing CHIKV structural antigens has been published [35].
