            "text": "Egress of enveloped viruses is typically associated with the cell secretory pathway guiding the particles and/or their precursors through cellular organelles, in particular the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi cisternae [1]\u2013[7]. In this regard, enveloped viruses usurp the cellular secretory machinery in order to achieve the efficient transport of progeny viruses to the plasma membrane and the maturation of precursor particles into infectious virions [8]\u2013[14]. In contrast, non-enveloped viruses are thought to be released as mature virions through a cytolysis burst at the end of infection [15]\u2013[17]. However, there is evidence on non-enveloped virus egress through active transport besides the major lytic pathway. A few non-enveloped lytic viruses were shown to be actively transported to the cell periphery and released prior to cell lysis. For instance SV40 was detected in intra-cytoplasmic smooth membrane vesicles and described as being released from the cell before cytopathic effects are seen [18]. Similarly, cocksackie B3 virus was found to be transferred from cell to cell through microvesicles [19]. We also recently reported that in the case of non-enveloped lytic parvoviruses that progeny virions are actively transported from the nucleus to the plasma membrane (PM) through vesicles in a gelsolin-dependent manner [20].",

Once in the ER, transport of cargos is mediated by coat protein complex II (COPII) vesicles. Engulfment of cargos into COPII vesicles at ER exit sites is triggered by the activation of the small GTPase Sar1, a process which in turn induces the recruitment of two heterodimeric complexes, Sec23\u2013Sec24 and Sec13\u2013Sec31, and their assembly into a protein coat. In this complex, sec23\u2013sec24 is responsible for the selection and binding of the cargo. Sec24 can either bind directly to the transported protein if it features a transmembrane domain, or interact with a transmembrane receptor specific to the cargo in the case of a secreted protein. In both cases, sec23\u2013sec24 bound to the cargo forms a ternary complex which concentrates the cargo and bends membranes. The budding vesicle is then enveloped by the Sec13\u2013sec31 cage and released from the ER by fission.",

Targeting of cargo-vesicles to distinct organelles/compartments through the cytoplasm is achieved by distinct small GTPases, Rab-proteins, which are associated with the surface of moving vesicles. For instance, Rab1 targets vesicles from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, while Rab6 is responsible for transport within the Golgi cisternae and for retrograde transport from the Golgi apparatus to ER. Transport from the transgolgi-network (TGN) to the plasma membrane (PM) can take different routes and is accordingly controlled by a variety of Rab proteins. Among these, Rab8 is responsible for guiding the vesicles along the direct route from the TGN to the PM, while Rab11 shuttles TGN-vesicles through recycling endosomes to the PM [22]. A number of other Rab proteins are also involved in vesicle targeting to the endocytosis and secretion pathways, and new routes are constantly being discovered. When the vesicles reach the periphery of the cell, the release of the cargo is generally achieved by fusion of the vesicular membrane with the PM [31], [32].",

During productive infection, PVs induce dramatic morphological and physiological changes in their host cells, culminating in cell death and lysis [17], [33], [34]. This is mainly attributed to the large non-structural viral protein NS1, a multifunctional protein involved in particle production and spread (reviewed in [35]). NS1 was shown to modulate cellular pathways by physical interactions with distinct cell components [36], [37] and/or induction of post-translational modifications of cellular target proteins [3], [20], [37], [38]. These targets might be modified either directly by NS1/CKII\u03b1, a recently described complex formed by NS1 with the catalytic domain of cellular CKII [36], or indirectly through activation/modulation of the PDK1/PKC/PKB signaling cascade [39]. The latter activation is mediated by the virus-induced association of the ERM family protein radixin with PKC\u03b7, forming a complex that controls the activity and substrate specificity of the PDK1.",

To further characterize this pathway, we analyzed potential association of progeny particles in MVM infected A9 cells with cellular factors known to be involved in generation/loading of perinuclear vesicles. An obvious candidate for viral cargo shuttling out of the cell is the secretion pathway, which starts in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), with sar1, sec23/24 and sec13/31-dependent formation of COPII vesicles. We therefore investigated the role of these factors in the association of progeny PV virions with vesicles and the further transport to the cell periphery. In a first step, we determined whether out-going MVM virions colocalize with sec13, sec23 and \u03b2-COP in infected A9 cells using laser scanning microscopy. Previous reports pointed that progeny particles are associated with lamp2, a protein present in the membrane of lysosomes and late endosomes/multivesicular bodies [20], [41]. We therefore used colocalizations with Lamp2 and mitochondria as positive and negative controls, respectively. The absence of any significant capsid fluorescence at 4 h p.i. was taken as a reference for the selective detection of newly produced virions after onset of virus propagation and not in-coming virus during the infection process. Furthermore, cell reinfection with progeny particles was prevented by addition of neutralizing antibodies to the medium after the initial infection. As illustrated in Fig. 1A, progeny PV particles showed clear colocalization with the cellular vesicle forming complex, giving a first hint that MVM virions may associate with cellular vesicles assembled at the ER membrane.",

Association of progeny particles with vesicles was determined by cell fractionation and monitoring single-stranded virion DNA presence in the corresponding biochemical fractions [20]. To confirm association of virus with membranes structures and to assess internalization into vesicles, cell extracts were treated, or not, with or triton X-100 (disruption of membranes, release of membrane associated proteins into cytoplasm) and proteinase K (elimination of all proteins that are unprotected by membrane structures) prior to fractionation. A 4 h p.i. time-point was chosen to discriminate egress from the infection process. Transfection experiments in the presence of neutralizing antibodies were performed to discriminate egress from (re-)infections. As shown in Fig. 1B and in agreement with the above hypothesis, viruses were found in the subcellular vesicle fractions, from which they were removed by exposing cell lysates to Triton prior to fractionation. This vesicle association was not detected when target cells were either transfected with sec24 neutralizing antibodies or if the cells expressed dominant-negative sar1 mutants. This suggests that MVM progeny virions become engulfed into vesicles by components of the cellular secretory pathway in the perinuclear ER. Similar results were obtained with the related rodent parvovirus strain hgH1-PV after infection of the human glioblastoma cell line NCH149, suggesting that vesicular egress of progeny virions is a general feature of rodent PVs.",

Cells lacking functional sec24 or sar1 were unable to transport progeny virions away from the nucleus, resulting in a marked increase in the proportion of cells showing only nuclear virus (Fig. 1C). While total virus production was not much affected by sec24 and sar1 knockdowns, the observed retention of virions in the (peri)nuclear area correlated with a significant reduction of virus release in the culture medium as determined by measuring the amounts of virion DNA (dot blots) and/or infectious virions (plaque assays) in the supernatant (Fig. 1D).",

            "text": "We next characterized the pathway followed by vesicles carrying PV progeny particles. Many enveloped viruses are transported through one or the other compartment of the cellular secretory pathway before mature virions are released by budding at the plasma membrane [1]\u2013[6]. To determine the mode of parvoviral egress, we first examined the presence of MVM particles within cell organelles, and the association/colocalization of the particles with proteins involved in the targeting of intracellular vesicles. The latter proteins include the small GTPases, Rab that are located on the outside of vesicular membranes and are guiding the vesicles between subcellular compartments. Colocalisation with mitochondria (Mitotracker), ER (Calnexin, Sec23) and Golgi (gm130) as well as the small GTPases Rab1 (ER to Golgi), Rab 8 (Trans Golgi Network [TGN] to PM), and Rab11 (recycling endosomes) were investigated by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Rab6 which is involved in retrograde transport from Golgi to ER and is mainly detectable in the Golgi complex was used as a second marker for this organelle. It was shown previously that PVs become associated with Lamp2-containing vesicles (lysosomes, late endosomes/multivesicular bodies (MVB) [41]. Therefore, this marker served as a positive standard. (Re-)infections were inhibited by addition of neutralizing antibodies after the initial infections. As shown in Fig. S1 and summarized in Fig. 2A, strong colocalizations were observed between MVM particles and the ER resident protein calnexin, the Golgi complex marker gm130, and the small GTPases Rab1 and Rab6, known to control vesicular transfer between these compartments. Interestingly, significant co-staining was seen with Rab11 (TGN-RE-PM), while only background levels were obtained with mitotracker and Rab8 (TGN to PM). The presence of MVM progeny particles in ER and Golgi was then confirmed by biochemical fractionation of cellular extracts, separating ER membranes from the Golgi complex by ultracentrifugation on a nycodenz step gradient (Fig. 2B). Altogether these results strongly argue for the active transport of progeny PV particles through ER and Golgi.",

To this end, A9 cells were transduced with rAAV virions expressing dominant-negative (and for controls functionally active) Rab proteins prior to MVM infection. To ensure efficient expression, the dnRab mutant genes were placed under the control of the parvoviral P38 promoter, and cells were co-transduced with rAAV:P38-dnRab and, in absence of the PV NS1 protein (i.e. in absence of PV infection), with a second recombinant AAV virus expressing a transactivator protein specific for this promoter (rAAV:P4-Transactivator). This synthetic transactivator protein is comprised of two distinct NS1 domains, the N-terminal site-specific DNA-binding domain (aa 1\u2013275) and the C-terminal transactivator domain (aa 545\u2013672) linked by GFP. Dimerization of this polypeptide takes place through an N-terminal GST-tag. In contrast to the natural PV NS1 protein, this polypeptide expressed from the PV P4-promoter proved to be non-toxic as assessed by measuring metabolic activity and cell lysis (Fig. S2A). Under these conditions, selective inhibition of the secretion pathway was first tested independently of MVM infection, using cells transfected with a plasmid expressing secreted Gaussia Luciferase (GLuc). Indeed, this enzyme is known to be transported by vesicles from ER to Golgi and further to the plasma membrane following the regular Rab1 and Rab8 dependent secretion pathway [45]. As shown in Fig. 3A, secretion of GLuc was efficiently blocked as a result of the expression of dnSar1 (driver for the formation of transport vesicles at ER exit sites), dnRab1 and dnRab8 but only marginal dnRab11, demonstrating the functional impact and specificity of these variant proteins. We next tested the effects of Rab1, Rab8 and Rab11 inhibition on the vesicular egress of MVM through ER (sec23) and Golgi (Rab6) by colocalization with corresponding marker proteins (Fig. 3B; Fig. S3), and on the release of progeny particles in the medium by DNA dot blot analyses (Fig. 3C) and plaque assays (Fig. 3D). As expected, none of the dominant-negative mutants prevented MVM particles from entering the ER compartment. In contrast, MVM transport from ER to Golgi, and virus secretion into the supernatant were strongly impaired upon expression of dnRab1. Moreover, a very limited reduction of secreted particles was observed with dnRab11, and nothing at all upon inhibition of Rab8, suggesting that PV particles take a different route from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane as compared to GLuc.",

This observation, together with evidence of moesin being involved in endocytosis [46], led us to determine whether ERM proteins may play a role in the vesicular egress of progeny PV virions. In agreement with this possibility, we first showed that Moe and Rdx protein can be detected together with sec23 and virion DNA in vesicular fractions of MVM-infected A9 cells (Fig. 4A, 4 top panels). To put Moe and Rdx contribution to the test, we (over)expressed mutants thereof previously shown to interfere with endogenous protein functioning [38]. Impact on viral egress was then evaluated measuring virion DNA presence in vesicles (Fig. 4A, bottom), viral capsid intracellular distribution (Fig. 4B) and colocalization with cellular compartment marker proteins (Figs. 4C and S4), as well as progeny virion release into the medium (Fig. 4D). The dominant-negative moesin (MoeT547A) and radixin (Rdxdl[P]) mutants strongly interfered with the loading of progeny virions into cytoplasmic vesicles (Fig. 4A and C), resulting in a dramatic inhibition of virion release into the medium (Fig. 4D). Accordingly, viral capsids were hardly detectable in the cytoplasm under these conditions (Fig. 4B). In the presence of the functionally active RdxY146F mutant (consensus phosphorylation site for receptor tyrosine kinases [47]), MVM virions became associated with the vesicular fractions (Fig. 4A) and were readily found in the cytoplasm of infected cells (Fig. 4B). However, when vesicular egress through ER and Golgi was monitored, a strong decrease was observed in the colocalisation with the Golgi marker (Rab6, see Fig. S4), indicating the use of an alternative route seemingly involving secretory vesicles (increased Rab8 colocalization) and recycling endosomes (preserved Rab11 colocalization). Interestingly, in the presence of RdxY146F, progeny virions were not released efficiently into the medium (Fig. 4D), suggesting that virion transport through ER and Golgi plays an important role in the efficient release and spreading of PVs.",

The involvement of Rdx and Moe in the formation/loading of PV-containing vesicles raised the question, whether these proteins are selectively recruited by PVs or are genuine components of the cellular secretory machinery. This was investigated by expressing the secreted protein GLuc in mouse A9 and human NCH149 cells, and by determining the impact of over-expressing dominant-negative ERM variants on the proportion of enzyme secreted in culture supernatants in the absence of PV infections. As shown in Fig. 4E, inhibition of endogenous Rdx by RdxT564A strongly reduced the amount of GLuc in the medium from both cell cultures. A lesser but significant inhibition of GLuc secretion was also caused by dnMoe (MoeT547A). In contrast dnEz (EzT566A) failed to impair secretion. These data strongly argue for the essential role played by the ERM family proteins Rdx and Moe in the secretion of cellular proteins. The fact that dn mutant forms of these proteins inhibited in similar way PV egress gave further support to the involvement of vesicular transport in this process.",

            "text": "A productive PV infection typically culminates in the rupture of the cell plasma membrane, as apparent from the generation of lysis plaques [15] and the release of intracellular polypeptides into medium supernatants [17]. This final lytic event clearly contributes to virus release and spreading, questioning the role of the vesicular egress of PV particles taking place prior to cell death. The above-mentioned impairment of progeny particle release upon down-modulation of vesicular transport (Fig. 1D, 3D, and 4D) made us wonder whether the latter transport may not only contribute to pre-lytic virion release but also control the lytic process which follows. To this end, time-course experiments were performed with MVM infected A9 cells under conditions where viral egress and release were modulated as shown in previous experiments. Permeabilization of the plasma membrane was then measured by propidium-iodide incorporation using fluorescent microscopy and image J software quantification. Mock-treated A9 cells served as negative controls. In addition, the relation of the lytic activity observed to the presence/absence of PV egress was tested by performing experiments with a recombinant MVM vector (rMVM). This vector produces similar amounts of NS1 as the wild type virus in a single-round infection, yet it fails to produce capsid proteins, and as a result, does not lead to virus egress [48]. Therefore, infection of A9 cells with rMVM was used to measure the mere lytic activity induced upon NS1 expression. The results are summarized in Fig. 5. MVM-induced cytolysis was strongly reduced when (i) the virus lacked the capacity for progeny particle production and in consequence transport to the PM (rMVM), or (ii) vesicular transport was either inhibited (dnSar1, Rdxdl[P], dnRab1) or by-passing the Golgi apparatus (RdxY146F). Inhibition of particle loading (dnGln, MoeT547A) resulted in an intermediate phenotype as apparent from the delayed and significantly reduced PI incorporation. This was also the case of cells expressing dnRab11, correlating with a reduction of virus release into the medium (see Fig. 3C and D), presumably due to inhibition of the Golgi-TGN-RE pathway. In contrast, no or little effects on cell permeabilization were seen with dnRab8, which did not impair egress of PVs (Fig. 3C and D). Altogether these results suggest that vesicular transport of progeny particles through the Golgi complex plays an important role in the induction of cytolysis and to ensure the further release of progeny particles at the end of infection.",

After metabolic 32P-labeling, these phosphorylations resolved into a complex pattern of seven distinct tryptic phosphopeptides in two-dimensional electrophoresis/chromatography analysis (Fig. 6C). To determine the impact of vesicular transport on MVM capsid phosphorylation, effector protein variants known to inhibit viral egress (CKII\u03b1E81A [20], MoeT547A, and RdxY146F [see above]) were tested for their effects on the capsid tryptic phosphopeptide profile. As shown in Fig. 6C, the inhibition of vesicular egress or its re-routing away from the Golgi compartment, led to remarkable changes in the capsid phosphorylation pattern, in particular the characteristic loss of three distinct phosphopeptides (a, c, and e). These data provide strong evidence of parvoviral capsid modifications during egress through ER and Golgi.",

Virus stocks were purified on CsCl-gradients to remove empty capsids, matched for their ssDNA content (Fig. 7A) and tested for their infectivity in A9 cells by counting both NS1-positive cells (Fig. 7B) and lysis plaques (Fig. 7C) in infected cultures. Progeny particles that had transited (at least in part) through the Golgi complex in parental A9 cells proved to be significantly more infectious (lower particle (DNA) to infectivity ratio) than their counterparts that had bypassed this compartment (RdxY146F, MoeT547A, GlnY438A, CKII-E81A). For the same amounts of viral genome, virus produced in the latter four cells gave rise to 3 to 4 times less NS1-positive cells and up to 10 fold fewer plaques than virus produced in vesicular egress-proficient cells (A9). Together with the above finding that egress through ER and Golgi is accompanied by capsid modifications, these results suggest that the transport pathway to the plasma membrane represents an important step in the maturation of progeny virions.",

The present analysis shows that the release of non-enveloped PVs is not a mere consequence of the cellular lytic burst occurring at the very end of the viral life-cycle but involves a pre-lytic active vesicular transport of virions. This transport makes virions transit through ER and Golgi, and appears to have two major implications: the maturation of progeny particles into fully infectious virions, and the induction of cytolysis with the ensuing virus spread. For this transport process, PVs usurp cellular components allowing progeny virion engulfment into COPII vesicles at the ER and moving through the Golgi to the plasma membrane under control of small Rab GTPases. This vesicular trafficking is a general feature of rodent parvoviruses as it was demonstrated for both, the mouse virus MVM and rat virus H-1PV in mouse and human cancer cells, respectively.",

Given their known mediator function between actin and membrane structures [40], we hypothesize that ERM proteins may control the engulfment of viral cargo into membrane structures. In keeping with this possibility, we recently reported that progeny PV particles associate with actin fragments, and that the actin-severing protein gelsolin controls PV loading [20]. Interestingly, the present results indicate that, radixin and (at least in human cells) moesin are essential players not only for PV egress but for the secretion of GLuc as well. This speaks for the fact that ERM family proteins are not simply involved in PV virion sensing, but play a general role in the COPII vesicle-mediated secretion. In contrast, the actin-processing protein gelsolin, whose knock-down had no impact on GLuc secretion, seems to be recruited specifically to promote (parvo)virus egress and is apparently not required for cellular secretion in general.",

This is unexpected, since in contrast with enveloped viruses, PVs do not acquire, during this transit, a lipid envelope harboring proteins mediating cell attachment and/or entry. However, passage through the ER-Golgi pathway still proved to be important for PV maturation in that capsids gained post-assembly modification such as phosphorylations. These capsid modifications did not occur under conditions inhibiting the vesicular secretory pathway. MVM viruses lacking the Golgi-associated capsid modifications were less efficient at infecting na\u00efve cells as compared with viruses produced in cells with an intact secretory pathway. This is not without precedent for non-enveloped lytic viruses. Indeed, tyrosine phosphorylations at the capsid surface of the defective parvovirus AAV also seem to control the infectivity of this agent [50]. Furthermore, other viruses become processed after assembly. For instance, assembled polioviruses present in autophagosomes, were shown to mature upon acidification of these vesicles prior to their fusion with lysosomes. This acidification induces the cleavage of poliovirus capsid proteins, an essential step for these virions to gain full infectivity [51]. Interestingly, MVM and H-1PV virions were shown to colocalize with the late endosomal/lysosomal marker Lamp2 (see also below). This leads us to speculate that the maturation of these viruses may involve the induction of additional post-assembly capsid modifications in these compartments besides the above-mentioned Golgi-associated phosphorylations.",

A number of enveloped viruses (e.g. Filo-, Retro- Rhabdo-, Arena-, Paramyxo viruses) transit through multi vesicular bodies (MVB) during their transport to the PM. A common feature of these viruses consists in the presence in their structural proteins, of (a) short recognition motif(s) facilitating their interaction with cellular factors that participate in MVB sorting. In the case of HIV-1, the PTAP-motif of Gag interacts with Tsg101, thereby inducing the recruitment of the ESCRT1 complex which constitutes the sorting machinery for incorporation of ubiquitylated proteins into MVBs. Thus, this interaction promotes entry of viral particles into MVBs during HIV-infection [52]\u2013[55]. Other motifs known to mediate vesicular uptake include YPx(n)L and PY (PPxY), which bind to the cellular factors AIP1/Alix and Nedd4 ubiquitin ligase, respectively [56], [57]. It is noteworthy that PPxY motifs are present in the parvovirus VP1 protein. Together with the strong and weak colocalization of PV capsids with the late endosome markers Lamp2 [41], [58], and Rab11 (present study), respectively, this feature raises the possibility of late endosomes/MVBs playing a role in the transport of PVs from the Golgi to the PM.",

            "text": "Besides contributing to virus intracellular trafficking, vesicular transport of progeny PV particles through ER and Golgi apparently serves additional purposes. Importantly, this vesicular transit was found to result in post-assembly modification (in particular phosphorylation) of capsids, and in a marked increase in virion infectivity. Furthermore, vesicular egress proved to have an impact on the still poorly understood mechanism of PV-induced cytolysis. The present results indicate that progeny virus transport through ER and Golgi up-regulates this process. This is apparent from the delay in or inhibition of infected cells lysis upon alteration of the virus egress route. The mechanism underlying this dependence of cytolysis on vesicular PV transport remains a matter of speculation. It may be traced back to the co-transport of cellular or viral products involved in cytolysis, which become engulfed into virion-containing vesicles, are brought to the PM and cause its permeabilization. Besides cellular or viral phospholipases, the viral NS1 protein is an intriguing candidate for this process, since it appears to exert lytic activities upon (prolonged) ectopic expression [59] and is known to be present in cellular vesicles [20], [41]. At late stages of infection, the vesicular co-transport of cytolytic factors might not be required anymore since the cytoskeletal collapse [33], [36] would allow direct access of cellular and viral lytic factors to the PM. This would explain the delayed cell lysis and small plaque phenotype observed after PV infection of cells deficient in ER-Golgi vesicular transport.",

The latter processes are of particular importance in the context of the current development of PVs as oncolytic agents for anti-cancer therapeutic applications [60]. It is noteworthy in this regard that tumor cell killing by parvoviruses is immunogenic [61], resulting in an immune bystander effect that takes over from the initial direct oncolytic effect of the viral treatment to complete eradication [62]. It will be of great interest to determine whether the hereby reported vesicular egress of parvovirus particles also contributes to the display and/or release of tumor-associated antigens and/or damage/pathogen-associated molecular patterns that stimulate the immune component of PV oncosuppression.",

PV-infection was limited to a single round by addition of either 0.5 U/ml neuraminidase (Sigma) to remove sialic acid from the cell receptor 1/200 dilution of neutralizing antibody B7 as from 4 h after the initial infection (Supplement S5)o Recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs) were generated in 293T cells in absence of Ad5 by co-transfection with pAAV-P4-X and pDG, purified by iodixanol step gradients and the genomic titers determined by dot blot hybridization [66]. Transduction efficiencies were determined by immunofluorescence microscopy measuring the proportion of trans-gene expressing cells. Toxicity was assessed by measuring metabolic activity through mitotracker incorporation, and cell lysis through PI-staining (Supplement Fig. S6A, B).",

Newly synthesized MVM virions, MVM NS1 and AAV capsids were isolated by immunoprecipitation, purified on SDS-PAGE and analyzed for their phosphor amino acid composition by 2D-electrophoresis. A scheme (upper left corner) denotes the migration of the different phosphorylated products. (B) Double-purified MVM virions and empty capsids (EC) were characterized by SDS-PAGE followed by silver-staining (left panel) and western blotting to detect phosphor-tyrosine residues (right panel), respectively.
