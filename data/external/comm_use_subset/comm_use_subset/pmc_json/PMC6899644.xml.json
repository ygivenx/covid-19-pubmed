Zoonotic outbreaks incur a severe economic burden through patient medical costs and stamping out programmes that can run into billions of dollars, while persistence of AIVs in poultry rearing systems causes poultry morbidity and mortality (Alexander, 2007; Otte, Hinrichs, Hinrichs, Rushton, Roland\u2010Holst, & Zilberman, 2008; Qi et al., 2014). Humans are immunologically na\u00efve to AIVs; however, sporadic human cases are reported each year from countries with high levels of AIV endemicity, and although sustained transmission in humans does not occur, there is a clear ongoing threat of pandemic emergence for these viruses (Uyeki et al., 2002).",

Live bird markets (LBMs) are a traditional aspect of these systems that facilitate the storage and sale of live poultry including chickens, ducks, quail and pigeons. As a consequence, LBMs play a significant role in the maintenance and spread of AIVs and thus pose a zoonotic risk to poultry workers and consumers, and to temporary workers enlisted during stamping out programmes (Bridges et al., 2002; Mounts et al., 1999). LBMs have been a primary target for AIV control strategies; during a zoonotic outbreak of H7N9 in China in 2013, closure of LBMs was shown to be remarkably effective in reducing the risk of human infection by up to 99% (Yu et al., 2014). Control strategies in LBMs have also been shown to significantly reduce AIV detection in chickens: the most effective strategies include monthly rest days that involve routine market closure followed by slaughter of unsold poultry, a ban to the sale of live quail and a ban to overnight storage of live poultry (Kung et al., 2003; Lau et al., 2007; Leung et al., 2012). However, although rest days are effective at breaking the viral amplification cycle in LBMs, they do not prevent reintroduction of virus. Indeed, rest days/nights are an important component of long\u2010term AIV control but are not sufficient alone to eliminate infection (Kung et al., 2003). Furthermore, risk factor studies in LBMs have shown that having a greater variety of poultry species, including ducks being sold alongside other species, having poor sanitary conditions, storing poultry in floor pens instead of cages and having \u22651 wholesaler trading in LBMs, all increase the odds of having AIV\u2010infected poultry and/or having AIV\u2010contaminated environments (Kim et al., 2018; Kirunda et al., 2015; Santhia et al., 2009; Sayeed et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2018).",

Poultry traders are an integral component of poultry production in Vietnam. They transport poultry from farms to LBMs, shaping a live poultry trading network through which AIVs may spread. Traders\u2019 practices may thus impact on the likelihood of introducing AIVs in LBMs and also facilitate the amplification of AIV circulation within marketed chicken populations (Fourni\u00e9 et al., 2012). However, a quantitative assessment of the association between poultry management practices and AIV prevalence in marketed chickens is lacking. To address this gap, AIV infection status of chickens in Vietnamese LBMs was assessed and the practices of traders offering them for sale characterized. This allowed us to assess the extent to which those practices may impact on the risk of viral circulation in LBMs.",

Markets were selected if they had previously been confirmed positive for AIV in chickens within the past 12 months according to FAO\u2010supported surveillance conducted by the National Centre for Veterinary Diagnostics (NCVD) and the Department of Animal Health (DAH, Hanoi). Markets were also selected if they were open seven days per week, facilitated the trade of live chickens, ducks and pigeons, and had more than 10 poultry traders operating in them. There were no quail (live or dead) at any of the LBMs, although this was not by design. Each LBM was sampled daily for seven consecutive days. On each day the LBM was sampled, the first 10 traders to arrive who contained at least five chickens in their flocks were recruited for the study and oropharyngeal swabs were collected from 5 chickens in each of their respective flocks, which were then pooled together. Selected traders were then asked about their recent trading practices in a closed\u2010ended questionnaire (Supplementary information Data S1). A total of 493 pools were collected from 2,465 chickens, and swabs were pooled in 2 ml virus transport medium (VTM) (Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with gentamicin, penicillin, streptomycin, bovine serum albumin, fungizol and HEPES solution) per trader and linked to traders and their questionnaire responses (on some days, less than 10 traders were sampled). Of the 493 sampled poultry traders, seven were removed during univariable and multivariable analysis due to incomplete feedback. Environmental swabs were taken from three discrete areas of markets to determine the level of influenza virus A contamination of LBM environments. These discrete areas represented different poultry\u2010related work activities which had previously been recommended to be included in routine monitoring and surveillance programmes for avian influenza viruses in LBMs (Indriani et al., 2010): (a) slaughter area including equipment used for slaughtering birds, (b) waste area including bins and containers used for disposing of bird waste such as feathers and (c) poultry stall including cages and the vicinity where birds were stored during LBM trading hours. Three swab samples were taken from each area and pooled each day (three separate pools representing three sampled areas generated per day). All pooled swabs were maintained in cold chain for transportation to NCVD, Hanoi, where they were stored at \u221270\u00b0C until further processing.",

Logistic regressions were used to conduct univariable analysis of explanatory variables where Influenza virus A infection status of each pool of 5 chicken swabs was used as the response variable. Explanatory variables with p < .05 were explored for collinearity by computing VIF values with the vif() function in the \u201ccar\u201d package. All variables with p < .05 from univariable analysis had VIF < 5 so were kept for subsequent stepwise variable selection. A final model of explanatory variables with LBMs as random effects was used in multivariable analysis. Final selection of explanatory variables was conducted by backward stepwise variable selection in R. Mantel tests were conducted in the R package, \u201cecodist\u201d, where virus isolates with whole\u2010genome sequencing data were included (Mantel, 1967). For each of the virus isolates, the ORF of each gene segment was concatenated and a dissimilarity matrix, or genetic distance matrix, was constructed from the pairwise nucleotide differences in MEGA (Kumar et al., 2016). Additional dissimilarity matrices were also constructed from the explanatory variables of same dimension as the genetic distance matrix, and related to the characteristics of the poultry from which the viruses were isolated. We refer to them as sample characteristic matrices M. For any of those matrices, an element mij = 1 if strains i and j are from samples with the same characteristic (e.g. poultry sold in the same market, poultry originating from the same type of premise, farm or market, and poultry originating from the same province), if not, mij = 0 (e.g. poultry sold in different markets, poultry originating from different types of premises and from different provinces).",

However, the partial sequencing data for the HA genes of the H5N6 viruses contained the polybasic cleavage motif RRKR/G, classifying them as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses (Chen et al., 1998). All sequenced NA genes of the H9N2 viruses contained a three amino acid deletion between residues 62 and 64. Deletions in the stalk of NA are associated with adaptation of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) to chickens (Sorrell, Song, Song, Pena, & Perez, 2010); however, a functional balance between HA and NA must be maintained which may be reflected here by the retention of a NA stalk deletion, the continued HA1 glycosylation at residues 11, 123, 200 (6/16 sequenced HAs), 280, 287 and 295, and the receptor binding site residues A/T180, L216 and M217 (mature H9 numbering), which may have a variable impact on receptor binding (Baigent & McCauley, 2001; Castrucci & Kawaoka, 1993; Sealy et al., 2019).

As such, traders are classified as retailers or wholesalers based on who they primarily sell poultry to; retailers primarily sell directly to consumers, whereas wholesalers primarily sell to other poultry vendors within the trading network. In our study, we show retailers experienced higher odds of infection due to their trading practices. The retailers in our study were those who sourced their birds from middlemen, sold a relatively small volume of chickens and primarily sold directly to consumers. The risk factors associated with influenza virus A infection in chickens, selling only to consumers and buying from middlemen, can therefore be linked to retailers, which highlights their potential role in disseminating virus through the poultry trade network. In contrast, the wholesalers in our study were those who sourced from large commercial farms, sold a large volume of chickens and primarily sold to other vendors. The protective risk factor of selling more chickens is associated with the practices of wholesalers and identifies this group of poultry traders as relatively low risk.",

            "text": "When considering the potential impact on AIV dissemination that these traders can have, it is important to take note of the position that vendors have in the poultry trade network. Vendors who have strong connections to a network of contacts operating in and around LBMs would be expected to have a more pronounced role in disseminating AIVs, whereas vendors holding a loose link to a network of contacts may have a reduced impact on AIV dissemination (Fourni\u00e9 et al., 2016). Thus, middlemen are mobile, highly connected poultry traders that travel between farms and LBMs to purchase and sell birds, mixing poultry from many different sources. As a consequence, they facilitate a network of LBMs that are tractable to the circulation of influenza viruses (Fourni\u00e9 et al., 2013, 2012). The identification of middlemen supplying poultry to traders as a risk factor for influenza virus infection could be explained by their mobility and propensity to mix poultry, and their high connectivity to the poultry trade network. Likewise, retailers could be associated with higher odds of infection because they may purchase birds that have \u201cchanged hands\u201d multiple times, promoting the amount of time spent by birds within the trade network and facilitating the mixing of birds from different sources. All the LBMs included in this study were open seven days a week, which would allow for greater connectivity between traders as they have more opportunity to interact at LBMs, potentially increasing the risk posed by retailers in particular. Although we did not explicitly capture the structure of the trade network in our study, the trading practices that we assessed can be used as indicators for the position of traders within the trade network.",

These systems necessitate the use of areas with surface water such as river deltas, and therefore introduce the risk of mixing wild aquatic birds with domestic aquatic birds and chickens. Duck farming often involves raising and storing ducks in open bodies of water, which introduces the risk for wild waterfowl to mix with farmed ducks and transmit influenza viruses. In addition, studies have shown longer virus shedding times for LPAI\u2010infected ducks, up to 11.5 days, compared with LPAI\u2010infected chickens, up to 6 days (H\u00e9naux & Samuel, 2011; James et al., 2016). Therefore, poultry traders with larger numbers of unsold ducks could increase the transmission window for ducks to infect chickens, especially as unsold ducks may have repeated exposures to wild waterfowl when traders store unsold ducks at home.",

Avian influenza viruses are frequently detected in shared poultry water (Leung et al., 2007), wooden tabletops, cages, bins and floors (Indriani et al., 2010). In our study, we have confirmed the importance of environmental contamination by showing influenza virus A prevalence in three areas of LBMs: slaughter area, waste area and poultry storage area. Traders who bring infected birds to LBMs play a role in perpetuating environmental contamination, while traders with healthy birds run the risk of contaminating their birds by storing them in contaminated environments.",

Likewise, we may have received feedback on poultry trading practices from the same vendors multiple times over the sampling period. However, the infection status of unsold chickens and associated poultry trading practices of a vendor may have changed as the week progressed, that is chickens may have been free of AIV infection at the start of the sampling week, but by day 2 or day 3, the chickens of the repeatedly sampled poultry trader may have become AIV\u2010positive. This may be reflected by the repeatedly sampled poultry trader having more unsold birds compared to earlier in the week.",

Being able to identify a specific type of poultry trader responsible for impacting AIV dissemination due to their poultry trading practices is novel and could be useful in future surveillance and control programmes. H9N2 viruses continue to cause significant poultry outbreaks and expand their global distribution within poultry producing countries. It is therefore increasingly important to monitor trends in H9N2 epidemiology, by using both active and passive surveillance systems that are already in place for H5 pandemic preparedness. Surveillance of AIVs is particularly important in countries where there is co\u2010circulation of multiple subtypes. Prevention and control of zoonotic risks associated with endemic AIVs require continued surveillance efforts, and cost\u2010effective targeted approaches to identify and protect high\u2010risk poultry traders in highly connected trade networks.",
