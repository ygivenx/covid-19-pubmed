For the computational chemist, an attractive goal is to develop computer programs capable of automatically evaluating large-scale chemical libraries (databases). These computational methods are referred to as virtual screening (VS)[4]. In general, two strategies have been employed in virtual screening: (1), using pharmacophore-based database searching (PBDS) methods to identify potential hits from chemical libraries, mostly in the cases where three-dimensional (3D) structures of the targets are unknown; and (2), using molecular docking approaches to screen the libraries in cases where the 3D structures of the targets are available[4,5]. Because more and more 3D structures of drug target proteins are available, VS with molecular docking approaches has become promising, as demonstrated by numerous recent examples[2,6-10].",

Since Kuntz et al.[11] published the first docking algorithm DOCK in 1982, numerous docking programs have been developed during the past two decades [12-25]. Several comprehensive reviews of the advances of docking algorithms and applications have been published [26-30]. Scoring (ranking) the compounds retrieved from a database is performed simultaneously with the docking simulation. Molecular docking is a typical optimization problem, for it is difficult to obtain the global optimum solution. As the fitness during the optimization process, scoring function should be fast and accurate enough, allowing simultaneous ranking of the retrieved poses in the optimization process. Based on this idea, several scoring functions have been developed [31-33]. Unfortunately, there is no scoring function developed so far that can reliably and consistently predict a ligand-protein binding mode and the binding affinity at the same time[31,32,34]. Therefore, heuristic docking and consensus score strategies are often used in virtual screening [34-36].",

One is the computational cost; only docking programs capable of docking a flexible ligand within a reasonable time scale are acceptable for virtual screening[34]. The other one is the ability to discriminate between true actives and inactive compounds; only those docking approaches able to distinguish the active molecules rapidly and accurately, are suitable for virtual screening applications in practice. Although the consensus score strategy has demonstrated an advantage over single scores, it is actually based on the results of single scoring optimization. This means that consensus scoring only re-scores a limited molecules or conformations (generally 30 or more), thereby inevitably losing a number of true positives[33,34]. To some extent, consensus scoring seems to be far-fetched and artificial [37].",

However, real-world problems normally involve multiple objectives (possibly conflicting ones) or optimization criteria, which should be satisfied simultaneously, and suitable solutions to the overall problem cannot be found by using individual optimization algorithms with single objectives[38]. For example, an optimization solution for the binding affinity (energy) between a ligand and a receptor is usually not the optimization solution for other criteria (e.g. shape or chemical complementarity, etc.). Similar problems in combinatorial library design and structural superposition of three-dimensional molecules have been reported[39,40]. Thus, there is a need for an optimization algorithm compromising several objectives, which may result in more reasonable and robust binding modes between ligands and receptors. In fact, it is a problem of multi-objective optimization (MO)[41], which tends to find a set of alternative good compromises, generally known as pareto-optimal solutions. These solutions are optimal because no other solutions in the search space superior to them when all objectives are considered. Then, the 'optimum' is chosen by the design which fits better in a certain application.[42] There are more than twenty mathematical multi-objective optimization techniques[43,44]. However, due to their inherent parallelism, evolutionary algorithms (EAs) and genetic algorithms (GAs) are still the top priority in terms of finding multiple pareto-optimal solutions for multi-objective optimization problems[45].",

Different from consensus score, MOSFOM does not re-score or re-rank the candidates from the primary virtual screening with one or several other scoring functions, but scores all the molecules in a chemical database with two or more scoring functions simultaneously during the binding pose optimization. Testing results indicate that MOSFOM, which is able to enhance hit rates and greatly reduces the false-positive rate, is more robust and reasonable than the consensus strategy as an alternate tool for large-scale library virtual screening. Here, MOSFOM emphasizes a new strategy to obtain the most reasonable binding conformation[46] and increase hit rates with several scoring functions rather than to accurately predict the binding free energy or the combination of several scoring functions. Consequently, MOSFOM can be used in the prioritization of ligands in high-throughput virtual screening.",

Certainly, compared with single objective optimization, the solution obtained here may be worse than any single objective solution, but more reasonable than any extremum obtained by a single objective method because it has considered multiple-objective functions.

Consequently, shape complementarity was expected to be very important. MOEA_Nrg efficiently eliminates conformations that could not satisfy shape complementarity although they displayed good energy scores. The maximum enrichment was 2.8-fold over random, which was reached at the top 8.8% of the database when using a single energy score for optimization, but the maximum enrichment was 3.9-fold over random, and moved up to the top 2.6% of the database when using MOEA_Nrg (Figure 3a). MOEA_Cnt also got a good enrichment (EF = 3.4485) at the top 0.4% of the database, but it was worse than single contact score with EF = 6.9 at the top 0.2%. There are several possible explanations; first, the conformation with highest contact score cannot satisfy energy score, that is, the conformation that has the best contact score but a bad energy score not among the pareto-optimal solutions will be eliminated; second, the scoring function is imprecise which is the common disadvantage for all the scoring functions. Interestingly, although contact score maintained higher enrichment among the top 2% of the database, the same enrichment as that of MOEA_Nrg was obtained at the top 2% of the database, and from this point, the enrichment peak of MOEA_Nrg became broader.

Therefore, if not knowing which scoring function will work better for the test system in advance, more enrichment can be obtained with EFMOGA in the most interesting section (generally 2%) of the database. It should be noted that EFMOGA, with different weights for different test systems through experimental protein-ligand complex, is more reasonable and different from the simple linear combination (LC)[68] of several scoring functions or ScreenScore through a combination of scoring terms[69]. EFMOGA seems more pertinent and advantageous, and will be a tendency for scoring and ranking to consider different scoring functions focusing on diverse aspects for different systems.",

With different preferences, MOEA_Nrg and MOEA_Cnt all outperformed their corresponding individual scoring function, i.e., MOEA_Nrg corresponding to energy score and MOEA_Cnt corresponding to contact score. A higher enrichment and hit rates of the active compounds were obtained using MOEA_Nrg than using individual energy score in COX-2 and ER system, but there is an inverse phenomenon for thrombin case. There are several strong hydrogen bond interactions between the ligand and the residues in S1 pocket for thrombin system. If we select the one with lowest energy score from the docked conformations with acceptable shape complementarity, more compounds will have good shape complementarity conformations but are only slightly different in energy score, since the energy score does not pay more additional attention to the H-bond interaction. In this case, it will be more difficult to distinguish the active compounds. On the contrary, MOEA_Cnt performed well for the thrombin and ER case, where an open cavity exists, accommodating enough orientations or conformations of a ligand, therefore, it seems more reasonable that MOEA_Cnt selected the best shape complementarity conformation with differences in energy score. So, if one does know which scoring function will work better for the test system in advance, more enrichment and better performance can be obtained using \u03b5-MOEA through relative preference.",

Although MOSFOM performed better than individual score, there will be more choices for MOFSOM in specific test system if more interactions were considered. We can determine different weights of scoring functions because EFMOGA can be determined to deal with different cases and maybe prefer others (e.g. chemical complementarity or hydrogen bonds) for \u03b5-MOEA if we know which scoring function will work well for specific test system in advance.

Considering protein flexibility to acquire correct protein-ligand binding conformation is crucial for medicinal chemists to find out the structure-activity relationship. We will fulfil this work in the future. Also, computational time of multi-objective optimization is another issue to be solved. There are numerous multi-objective optimization methods, however, they are not suitable for large-scale virtual screening because of the huge time consumption, in this paper, \u03b5-MOEA, which is a steady-state MOEA based on the \u03b5-dominance concept, fulfilled virtual screening quickly within about one minute for one molecule, and EFMOGA, which is a multi-population MOGA based on information entropy, accomplished one docking within 40 seconds using one CPU on SGI origin3800 hardware.

A set of pareto-optimal solutions were obtained which can simultaneously satisfy energy and shape complementarity using \u03b5-MOEA method, then through two different preferences, the binding conformations of pareto-optimal solutions with lowest energy scoring or best shape complementarity were ranked among all selected conformations. However, EFMOGA acquires different weights of each scoring function for different systems based on experimental X-ray complex structure, that is, for different system, EFMOGA regards the varying weight as the degree of contribution of individual scoring function, which generally focuses on one aspect for a special type of binding sites, this means the scoring function with bigger weight is more suitable for the binding site. We used 10000 random compounds as the decoys, active compounds selected from MDDR database were randomly merged into the decoys, respectively. To ensure justness of comparison, GAsDock, based on an improved genetic algorithm, was used as a benchmark for single-objective optimization. Results show that MOSFOM can enhance the enrichment and greatly increase the hit rates compared with individual score (see Results). For three different kinds of binding sites, MOSFOM represents excellent ability of distinction of active compounds with energy and shape complementarity. EFMOGA specially performed well at the top 2% of the database, MOEA_Nrg and MOEA_Cnt performed better than individual scoring function if a proper type of binding site was selected.",
