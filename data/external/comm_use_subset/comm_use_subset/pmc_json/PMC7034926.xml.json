In RNAi screens, genes are perturbed with small interferring RNAs (siRNAs). These are 20-25 nucleotides in length, complementary to mRNAs, and cause post-transcriptional gene silencing [1, 2]. The absence of certain host proteins has been shown to have an impact on the life cycle of pathogens [3, 4, 5], e.g., by reducing the ability of the pathogen to grow or by enhancing it.",

First, the virus enters the host cell and releases its RNA genome into the cytoplasm. Translation of the RNA results in the expression of viral (nonstructural) proteins that assemble into a replication complex that drives the synthesis of new viral RNA. Newly synthesized genomic RNA is encapsulated by capsid protein. Eventually, new virions are assembled and released from the infected cells [7, 8, 9]. For virtually all of these steps, the virus strongly depends on host proteins due to the small RNA virus genomes with limited coding capacity. Another common feature of +RNA viruses is that their RNA synthesis takes place in specialized structures that are associated with modified host membranes [10]. In order to understand the virus-host interplay reliable identification of potential host factors involved in virus replication is crucial.",

Prioritizing host factors on a viral group level, such as the group of positive-sense ssRNA viruses, has until now not been pursued in detail, even tough it seems promising, because viruses of the same group often have very similar replication cycles. Pathogens of one group might utilize the same, or at least functionally related, host factors and cellular pathways for replication. Consequently, development of anti-viral drugs targeting common host factors would have the potential for broad-spectrum activity. Despite its potential there are only very few pan-viral drugs under clinical investigation, for instance inhibitor development for PI4K\u03b2 targeting various human enteroviruses [25]. One of the reasons could be that the overall success rate for inferring pan-viral hits seems to be low, since even for single viruses the identified host or restriction factors have shown to be highly variable between different studies (e.g. between [22] and [23]). Interestingly, if hits found against one virus are tested against other viruses of the same group, it may well be observed that they are effective in the other viruses as well [23], which speaks for the hypothesis that analyses on a pathway-level could be promising or even necessary approaches.",

Network approaches have admittedly been used for various gene prioritization tasks [30, 31, 32, 33], but so far have found only little attention in virology. For instance, Maulik et al. [34] have presented a clustering approach to detect modules in a bipartite viral-host protein-protein interaction network to identify host factors.

First, we apply a maximum likelihood approach for joint analysis of viral host factors using a random effects model. Then, we propagate this information over a biological graph using network diffusion with Markov random walks in order to account for genes of importance on a pathway level, reduce the number of false negatives and possibly stabilize the ranking of host factors. With our approach it is possible to detect novel pan-pathogen host factors, while also considering prior information in the form of networks. Our model has been designed for heterogeneous data sets by accounting for various confounding factors within the data. When applying our method to six different RNAi screening data sets of the four positive sense ssRNA viruses, CHIKV, DENV, HCV and SARS-CoV, we found that the procedure is able to recover the host factors for single viruses that have been described in the literature before, and to predict novel pan-pathogen host factors. We validated the host factors for which compounds were commercially available experimentally using pharmacological inhibition screens for five virus, i.e., HCV, DENV, CHIKV, Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and Coxsackie B virus (CVB). Moreover, we validated the newly predicted host factors, UBC, EP300 and PLCG1, using another siRNA knockdown on the Hepatitis C virus.",

In this study we use the functional protein interaction network from [40]. They define a functional interaction as one in which two proteins are involved in the same biochemical reaction as an input, catalyst, activator, or inhibitor, or as two members of the same protein complex, i.e. functionally significant molecular events in cellular pathways and not mere protein-protein interactions which rarely show direct evidence of being involved in biochemical events. The network consists in part of expert-curated, high-quality functional edges and in part of edges that have been trained and validated with a naive Bayes classifier. Unlike many other biological networks, the high quality of the annotations does not necessitate choosing edges with care, such as edges derived from computational annotation or inference with older yeast-two-hybrid technologies which are frequently false positives. Moreover, due to the biological interpretability of the edges in a pathway-context, a functional network like this should serve as a good choice to infer novel restriction and dependency factors and stabilize our rankings, because it associates genes connected with a disease and separates genes with mere physical interaction as in conventional pairwise networks. We stochastically normalized the weighted adjacency matrix of this network and then use the normalized matrix as transition matrix W. After convergence of the Markov chain, we use its stationary distribution p\u221e as new ranking of host factors by sorting genes accordingly.",

For a success probability of r = 0.2 the average number of trials is E[l]=5, which yields an average path length of 5. Consequently, choosing a high success probability reduces the average number of edges travelled automatically and ranks the starting genes higher than genes farther away. We chose to use a restart probability of r = 35%, opting for on average approximately 3 travelled edges.

To account for these effects, we use a combination of different normalization techniques for every screen separately (Supplement S1 Text for details). Briefly, the CHIVK and SARS-CoV screens use a pooled Dharmacon library on 96 well plates. We normalized the two data sets by first taking the natural logarithm over all samples, then substracting the mean background signal and finally computing a robust Z-score over the whole plate readout. The procedure has been applied separately for every plate. Since genes were not randomized on plates we did not use B-scoring or other methods that account for spatial effects [2, 29, 38]. For the HCV and DENV genome screens, we computed the natural logarithm for every readout of the complete data set, B-scored the plates using two-way median polish and, in a last step, calculated robust Z-scores. The HCV and DENV kinome screens have been normalized by first taking the natural logarithm of the well readouts and then fitting a local regression model to correct for cell counts. Since the HCV and DENV screens have randomized plate designs, we also corrected for spatial effects using two-way median polish using B-scores and eventually computed robust Z-scores (see Supplement S1 Code for the exact procedures).",

For high error levels and the first n = 10 genes, two sets of bootstrap samples have on average 60% similarity and a correlation of around 90% for the random effects model.

In order to assess if the top inferred gene products really have a pan-viral effect, inhibitors were tested on DENV, CHIKV and HCV as before and two novel positive-strand ssRNA viruses, MERS-CoV and CVB. Of the top 20 host factors from Table 2 inhibitors were available for the dependency factors CAMKK2, CDK5R2, DGKE, DUSP1, DYRK1B, PIK4CA, PKN3 and PLK1. The inhibitors were tested in dose-response CPE reduction assays on cells infected with the viruses. In parallel we assessed cytotoxicity of the compounds and discarded measurements that led to a significant reduction in cell viability (below 75% of the signal obtained for untreated control cells). For every host factor, virus and compound concentration, we tested if inhibition of a protein reduced viral replication in comparison to a negative control significantly (one-sided two-sample Wilcoxon test). We adjusted all p-values for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction [45]. We found that inhibition of several host factors showed significant reductions in replication on subsets of the five viruses and specific compound concentrations. For instance, CDK5R2, PKN3 and DYRK1B were significant at the 10%-level after multiple testing correction for at least some compound concentrations in four of the five viruses. However, none of the tested compounds had a significant effect on the replication of all of the five viruses (Supplement S6 Fig). Note that PLK1 was discarded due to cytotoxicity of the inhibitor at higher compound concentrations. For that reason, we point out that PLK1 should possibly also be discarded in the analysis of the primary screens.",

Of the top 20 host factors (Table 2), we were able to find commercially available compounds for nine of them, which we then biologically validated. While the screen confirmed the importance of these genes on the pan-viral replication cycle of subsets of viruses, no host factor could be found that is significant for all viruses. In general, viruses usurp defined cellular pathways. Even closely related viruses may use different entry points to the pathway. One example are the Dengue and Zika viruses which both depend on the host factor STT3A, but only DENV requires STT3B for replication [22]. The degree of similarity of the molecular biology of the viruses seems to determine the success of finding pan-viral genes in contrast to finding relevant pathways. While it makes theoretical sense that all positive-sense ssRNA viruses use the same host factors, detection of these has proven to be complicated and, as already mentioned in the introduction, yields variable results even for the same virus. A lack of overlap between screens, flexibility of the cell in several aspects and the possibility of viruses to just take different routes to achieve replication corroborates this hypothesis and makes pathway-analyses even more important. The broader the targeted group of viruses, the more central a target gene would have to be (e.g. UBC), but in that case it gets increasingly unlikely to find a inhibitor condition that only harms the virus but not the host cell. For bacteria, antibiotics are only specific to a more or less related group of bacteria (e.g. gram-positives), because of the metabolic similarity of the group. For viruses, it is likely that these groups need to be much narrower because in many cases only closely related viruses might actually share enough similarity in the metabolic or regulators pathways they exploit. Additionally, it has to be emphasized though that a protein inhibition screen like the one we conducted is not perfectly able to validate the inferred genes and their function in the replication cycle of the viruses. Thus a more rigorous validation could shed light on the biological importance of these genes.",

Exceptions are single candidates such as UBC which is central player in cell biology. Ubiquitination of proteins can target them for degradation in the proteasome which is an important homeostatic process in every cell. The proteasome has come up frequently as host factor for many viruses, albeit not always the same genes [46]. Inhibition of the proteasome, while being vital for the cell, is already done therapeutically, for instance in cancer treatment [47], or in studies for antiviral treatment [48].

Moreover, utilizing biological prior knowledge in the form of protein-protein interaction networks could possibly bias and corrupt results, especially when networks with incorrect edges are used. The use of multiple, different networks may improve this situation [33].",
