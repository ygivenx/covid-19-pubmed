            "text": "In the majority of patients with acute coronary syndromes, the adverse cardiovascular events are caused by rupture of vulnerable plaques16. Pathologically, vulnerable plaques are characterized by a large necrotic core, a thin fibrous cap, abundant macrophages and scarce collagen and SMCs17. Although an ideal animal model of unstable plaques has yet to be established, rupture-prone plaques in NZW rabbits receiving aortic balloon injury and a high cholesterol diet exhibited many human pathological features of unstable plaques as shown by our previous studies1418. In several previously published reports, a fibrous cap thickness less than 100 \u03bcm has been identified as a marker of unstable plaques1920. Thus, we used this cut-off value to differentiate unstable from stable plaques in the present study. As expected, TACE expression was found to be significantly higher in unstable than stable plaques, and positive TACE staining was located mainly in macrophages and intimal SMCs. Moreover, TACE expression in aortic plaques correlated significantly with macrophage content and neovessel number in plaques. These results suggest that endogenous TACE may play an important role in the progression and instability of atherosclerotic plaques. On the other hand, gene silencing of TACE in our rabbit model significantly reduced macrophages and lipid content while increased collagen content and SMCs in atherosclerotic plaques. As a consequence, plaque vulnerability index, a pathological parameter reflective of the likelihood of a given plaque to develop rupture, was greatly diminished by TACE gene silencing. These results demonstrated for the first time that TACE has a causative role in the pathogenesis of plaque instability. Moreover, the remodeling index and plaque burden in the aortic plaques were also substantially decreased in the TACE shRNA group, suggesting that TACE gene silencing is capable of not only stabilizing but also attenuating atherosclerotic plaques.",

Our previous study found that TNF-\u03b1 directly inhibited P4H\u03b11, a rate-limiting enzyme for collagen synthesis, via ASK1-JNK-NonO pathway13, which may partially explain why gene silencing of TACE remarkably increased collagen production in the aortic plaques. In addition, increased MMP activity in plaques appears to be the most important risk factor of plaque rupture. Both MMP9 and MMP2 localized in human vulnerable plaques are capable of active collagenolysis and have been reported to contribute to plaque expansion and rupture2122. In the present study, we found that gene silencing of TACE substantially down-regulated the activities of MMP2 and MMP9, which was in accordance with a previous report that TACE may promote the transcription of MMP223. Moreover, activated TACE may drive macrophage homing by generating soluble TNF-\u03b1, while gene silencing of TACE may decrease macrophages infiltration, which may also contribute to the attenuation of MMP activities2. Furthermore, recent studies showed that inhibition of TACE resulted in an increased expression of TGF-\u03b21 signaling24, while TGF-\u03b21 signaling played a crucial role in collagen production. In this study, we found that protein expression of TGF-\u03b21 was significantly up-regulated in the TACE shRNA group. These results suggest that decreased activities of MMP2 and MMP9 and increased expression of TGF-\u03b21 are probably the two major mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of TACE gene silencing on collagen production in the aortic plaques observed in this study.",

            "text": "A wealth of evidence indicates that an intensified inflammatory response is the major mechanism responsible for plaque instability. TACE reportedly triggers the release of a large variety of substrates, including cytokines, adhesion molecules and growth factors5. Recently, it has been reported that angiotensin II may activate TACE which induces shedding of ACE2, a negative regulator of angiotensin II, thus leaving the pro-inflammatory effects of angiotensin II unopposed25. More recently, we found that C-reactive protein may activate TACE that releases soluble lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 from macrophages into circulation15. These results suggest that inflammatory factors may activate TACE which in turn leads to increased release of soluble inflammatory factors, forming a vicious cycle of \u201cinflammation begetting inflammation\u201d. The release of adhesion molecules by TACE may stimulate adhesive leukocytes to migrate and infiltrate into the inflamed tissue26. In this study, we found that gene silencing of TACE markedly decreased the serum levels of sTNF-\u03b1, sICAM-1, sVCAM-1 and sMCP-1 with the most significant reduction of sTNF-\u03b1, suggesting that TNF-\u03b1 is likely the most important substrate of TACE. Previous studies found that the deficiency of TNF-\u03b1 in ApoE\u2212/\u2212 mice reduced the lesion size of atheroma27, and a recent elegant study by Federici M\u2019s group clearly demonstrated that patients with a higher ADAM 17 score including sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 exhibited increased cardiovascular events28. The present study revealed the independent role of sTNF-\u03b1 and sICAM-1 in plaque vulnerability in our animal model, which lent support to Federici M\u2019s study. In addition, we found TACE activity correlated more closely than sTNF-\u03b1 with plaque vulnerability index, suggesting that the salutary effects of TACE gene silencing observed in this study were probably due to inhibition of multiple substrates of TACE.",

In the present study, we found that gene silencing of TACE substantially decreased ERK and P38 phosphorylation, and P65 and iNOS expression, suggesting that the ERK-NF-\u03baB signaling pathway was suppressed by TACE shRNA treatment. Thus, the powerful inhibition of local inflammation may be a major contributor to the therapeutic effect of TACE gene silencing in our rabbit model. In addition, recent studies reported that neovascularization in the adventitia plays an important role in creating a conduit for lipids and inflammatory cells to be transported into plaques to enlarge the necrotic core and enhance plaque instability3233. Analysis of the atherosclerotic plaques has demonstrated that areas of tissue injury are spatially associated with infiltrating macrophages, in association with neovascularization of the media and adventitia34. Moreover, VEGF/Flt-1 pathway is known to enhance the production of pro-inflammatory, chemotactic mediators and adhesion molecules35, and potentiate their functions in an autocrine or paracrine manner36. Our experiment in vivo demonstrated that the increased protein expression of VEGF and its receptor Flt-1 as well as neovascularization in atherosclerotic plaques were reduced by TACE gene silencing, which lent support to a recent study that pathological neovascularization was attenuated by inactivation of TACE in endothelial cells3637. Our experiment in vitro also revealed that after HUVECs co-cultured with TACE downregulated THP-1 cells, neovessel tubes derived from HUVECs were dramatically decreased. These findings suggest that activated TACE and neovascularization contributed synergistically to the development of vulnerable plaques by increasing chemotaxis and transportation of inflammatory cells. Thus, attenuated neovascularization by TACE gene silencing also contributed considerably to the stabilization of atherosclerotic plaques. It has been claimed that TACE is unlikely involved in normal developmental angiogenesis, and thus TACE may offer a promising target for the treatment of pathological neovascularization23.",
