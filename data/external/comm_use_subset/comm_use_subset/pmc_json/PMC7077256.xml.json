Its genome, about 28 kb in length, encodes two nonstructural polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab), four structural proteins\u2014the approximately 200 kDa glycosylated spike (S) protein, 8 kDa envelope (E) protein, 24 kDa membrane (M) protein, and 58 kDa nucleocapsid (N) protein\u2014and one known accessory protein, the ORF3 protein [7,8]. Pp1a and pp1ab are the precursors of several enzymes and cofactors that together carry out PEDV genome replication and transcription. The S glycoprotein, trimers of which protrude from the viral membrane providing the coronaviruses their typical appearance, functions during cell entry by binding to cellular receptors and causing fusion of the viral and host cell membranes. The E protein has ion channel activity [9] and plays an important role in virion morphogenesis. The M protein is the main component of the viral envelope and interacts with all structural components during viral particle assembly. The N protein packages the genomic RNA to form the helical nucleocapsid (RNP). ",

PEDV ORF3 encodes a protein of 224 residues, which is about 25 kDa, but the gene is prone to undergo a 49\u201351 nucleotide (nt) deletion mutation when the virus is adapted to growth in cell culture, e.g., by serial passaging [11,12]. The 49-nt deletion leads to a premature translation stop at nt 274 giving rise to a naturally truncated ORF3 protein of 92 residues designated ORF3trun, as is the case with ORF3 of the attenuated DR13 strain (DR13att), which was used as the backbone of the recombinant viruses generated in the present study. Another type of ORF3 variant, as occurring in PEDV strains 85-7 and AVCT12, has a 30 nt deletion at the 5\u2032-end giving rise to a truncated ORF3 protein missing 70 residues at its N-terminus [13,14]. Field isolates with longer-length deletions of ORF3 have also been documented [15]. ",

The protein has been reported to function as an ion channel in both Xenopus laevis oocytes and yeast cells. Suppression of ORF3 expression by siRNA was found to inhibit the production of wild-type PEDV but not that of attenuated-type PEDV [16]. Using a Vero cell line stably expressing ORF3, it was demonstrated that PEDV ORF3 protein prolonged the S phase of the cell cycle besides augmenting vesicle formation in the cells. Interestingly, constitutive expression of the ORF3 protein exerted a positive regulatory effect on the proliferation of attenuated PEDV but not on that of virulent PEDV [17]. In a more recent study, both the wild type and a mutant ORF3 protein lacking residues 82\u201398 were found to co-localize with the S protein intracellularly and at the cell surface, both in infected cells and during co-expression in transfected cells [18]. Additionally, a direct interaction of the S protein with each of these ORF3 proteins was demonstrated in such transfected cells by co-immunoprecipitation, leading the authors to suggest that the ORF3 protein might be involved in virus assembly.

We generated four isogenic recombinant porcine epidemic diarrhea viruses (rPEDVs) based on the genomic backbone of strain DR13att, three of them carrying an intact ORF3 derived from different virus strains and one from which ORF3 had been entirely deleted. With these rPEDVs and DR13att, we studied the function of ORF3 by comparing the titers of the viruses and the biological characteristics of the infected cells. We found that the ORF3 protein enhanced the proliferation of PEDV by a mechanism most likely involving inhibition of apoptosis in infected cells. ",

Briefly, LR7 cells were grown to 90% confluence and infected with mPEDV (a recombinant PEDV in which the S gene was substituted by that of a mouse hepatitis virus, which enabled the recombinant virus to infect murine LR7 cells rather than Vero cells) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1.0. When obvious cytopathic effect (CPE) appeared, cells were trypsinized to produce a single cell suspension and washed 3 times with PBS. Capped runoff RNA transcripts (donor RNA) were synthesized from PacI-linearized pDR13att-\u2206ORF3, pDR13att-ORF3wt, pDR13att-ORF3CV777, and pDR13att-ORF3NY, respectively, using a T7 RNA polymerase kit (Ambion, Carlsbad, CA, USA), as specified by the manufacturer. Then the donor RNAs were transfected into the above mPEDV infected LR7 cells by electroporation (300 V, 975 \u03bcF, 2 consecutive pulses) using a Gene Pulser apparatus (SCIENTZ-2C, Ningbo Scientz Biotech Co, Ltd, Ningbo, China). Finally, the electroporated cells were resuspended in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS and co-cultured in a 25 cm2 flask with a monolayer of Vero cells. After 4\u20135 days of incubation at 37 \u00b0C, the cultures were harvested by 3 cycles of freeze-thawing and candidate recombinant viruses were purified by 3 rounds of end-point dilutions on Vero cells. Finally, virus stocks were grown in Vero cells, titrated, and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. The viral RNAs were then extracted with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and cDNAs were synthesized using primer 2 (Table 1) and the extracted RNA. RT-PCR was performed by using primers 1 and 2 (Table 1) and TransScript One-Step RT-PCR SuperMix (TransGen Biotech Inc., Beijing, China). The amplified genes were sequenced and assembled using the MEGA 6.0 software. For identification of rDR13att-\u2206ORF3, cDNA was synthesized with primer 2 (Table 1) and RT-PCR was performed by using primers 4 and 5 to amplify the S-E-\u2206ORF3 fragment for sequencing.",

The three rPEDVs carrying a wild type ORF3-rDR13att-ORF3wt, rDR13att-ORF3CV777, and rDR13att-ORF3NY reached a maximal titer of approximately 105.7 TCID50/mL at ~24\u201332 h.p.i. The rDR13att-\u2206ORF3 grew less efficiently throughout the testing process, reaching a peak titer of 105.3 TCID50/mL, which was approximately 90% compared to the viruses having wild type ORF3. The DR13att vaccine strain reached a titer of 105.8 TCID50/mL at 40 h.p.i., the highest titer among the five PEDVs examined. Statistical analysis indicated the difference between the peak titers of rPEDVs with an intact ORF3 and that of the rPEDV without ORF3 to be significant (p < 0.05). Because all these PEDVs had the same genetic backbone except for their ORF3, the results indicated that the presence of an intact ORF3 protein-enhanced PEDV proliferation. In addition, also the naturally truncated ORF3 protein as it occurred in strain DR13att exhibited this enhancing effect on virus proliferation. ",

No significant difference was observed between DR13att infected cells and cells infected with the full-length ORF3 expressing viruses. This result indicated that full-length ORF3 protein and its C-terminally truncated form may have the same anti-apoptotic effects. To directly observe the different apoptotic states of the cells infected with the PEDVs, a TUNEL assay was carried out following an earlier used method [21]. While no apparent TUNEL-labelling was detected in the PEDV S protein-positive cells at 8 h.p.i., the TUNEL signal was obvious in these infected cells at 16 h.p.i. and even more so at 24 h.p.i.

Whereas the extent of TUNEL labeling in cells infected by rDR13att-ORF3wt and DR13att was similar, the TUNEL signal in the cells infected with rDR13att-\u2206ORF3 was significantly higher, particularly at the later time point (p\n< 0.01).",

            "text": "Apoptosis is considered to be a host innate defense mechanism that disrupts viral replication by eliminating virus-infected cells. Viruses have consequently developed strategies to reduce apoptosis, which, in turn, prevents premature cell death, thereby maximizing progeny virus production [26]. In this study, we observed the use of such a strategy by PEDV. The viruses carrying an ORF3 not only grew to higher titers than the virus lacking the ORF, but their infection also caused less apoptosis, as judged by apoptotic indicators such as TUNEL labeling, translocation of phosphatidylserine from the inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane and activation of caspase-3. The observations indicate inhibition of procaspase-3 activation to be the possible mechanism of ORF3 protein-mediated host cell apoptosis. On the other hand, many viruses have the ability to actively induce apoptosis to facilitate the release and dissemination of viral progeny to neighboring cells. This pro-apoptotic property is one of the cytolytic effects of viral infections causing CPE in vitro, and it supposedly plays a pathogenic role by contributing to cell damage, tissue injury, and disease severity in vivo. This process has been observed particularly in RNA viruses, including Coronaviridae [27,28]. In addition, for PEDV, the induction of apoptotic cell death has recently been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. The process was found to be caspase-independent but to be mediated by activation of the mitochondrial apoptosis-inducing factor [21]. While apoptosis facilitates the release of virions from infected cells, proper timing of its induction seems desirable for the virus, as a too early breakdown of the cells would reduce the time and space for its propagation. Hence, we propose that, while PEDV apparently takes advantage of the effects of cellular apoptosis, its ORF3 protein may function to delay these processes in order to extend time and space for the virus to multiply. This may be a built-in mechanism of PEDV to maximize the production of its offspring. ",

It is tempting to speculate that this selection aims to maintain the favorable growth phenotype of the virus. Loss of the downstream C-terminal part of the protein is associated with attenuation of virulence in the natural host, suggesting that, as earlier proposed by Wang et al.

            "text": "Earlier studies on the function of the PEDV ORF3 protein have not yielded a consistent picture. Wang et al. used a siRNA approach targeting the viral sub-genomic mRNA3, which encodes the ORF3 protein to study its role in viral replication. While they did observe a strong reduction in infectious virus production for the wild type CV777 strain, no effect was detected for its attenuated derivative, which carried an ORF3trun [16]. Though the actual effect of the siRNA treatment on mRNA3 or ORF3 protein levels was not assessed, their results were consistent with a positive role in virus production for the wild type but not for the truncated ORF3 protein. In a study by Ye et al. a Vero cell line stably expressing the wild type ORF3 protein was established [17]. Virus yields in these cells were found to be similar to those in the parental cells when infected with field strain CH/YNKM-8/2013. A clear increase in infectious virus production was, however, observed with attenuated PEDV strains CV777 and AH-M. Quite a mysterious ORF3 protein was described by Jongkaewwattana\u2019s laboratory [13,30]. This intact ORF3 protein, named ORF3NP12 and derived from the Chinese strain JS-2004-2, was found to block the rescue of the infectious virus when its gene was incorporated into strain PEDVAVCT12. The rescue was, however, successful when the full-size gene was replaced by its truncated form. The inhibitory effect of ORF3NP12 on replication, which was even observed in the context of infection by a totally different virus (porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus), was attributed to two residues (F81 and M167) which, when mutated (F81L or M167S), restored the normal phenotype. It remains puzzling, however, how the strain JS-2004-2 carrying ORF3NP12 was able to cope with the inhibitory of effects of this ORF3 protein.",
