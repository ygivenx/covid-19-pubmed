            "text": "In early 2010, the prominent general scientific society in the US, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), recognized that international scientific collaboration is critical to addressing complex societal challenges in health, agriculture, environment, energy, and global security, and organized a series of four conferences under the common theme of \u201cInternational Engagement: Responsible Bioscience for a Safe and Secure Society.\u201d In a period of 2 years, these conferences examined the critical issues and explored the potentially sustainable approaches for collaboration between the scientists in the US and other countries, with the focus on the broader Middle Eastern and North African region. The major themes resulting from these conferences revealed a clear desire for cooperative research and development with responsible scientific practice and progressive action to enhance the infectious disease surveillance under the One Health concept (1). Although the AAAS conference series was focused on one region, the concept derived from the meeting and approaches that can be taken are undoubtedly applicable to many other countries and regions. Successful and sustainable partnerships that build upon mutual interests, complementary capabilities, and supporting infrastructure are essential to addressing complex global challenges, such as approaching the One Health concept. Scientists with interest and resources to initiate and maintain partnerships with colleagues in other countries, and who are able to overcome existing barriers to collaboration, serve as the foundation for successful international cooperation.",

            "text": "A well-suited scientific approach complementary to the above activities is next-generation sequencing-enabled genomics research for global health security applications. Genomics is a relatively new scientific discipline but is fundamental to many approaches to health security. Aided by highly automated Next-Generation DNA Sequencing (NGS) technologies, the field has been advancing dramatically, both in the depth of understanding genome structure and function of living organisms, and in the breadth of applications in areas, such as medicine (disease mechanisms, diagnostics, and therapeutics) and agriculture (2, 3). Using high-throughput DNA sequencing for pathogen detection during an infectious disease outbreak or for biosurveillance was previously slow, cost prohibitive, and required in-depth training and expertise. In the past decade, due to the advancement of highly automated instrument platforms, streamlined operational procedures and protocols, available reagent kits, and data analysis pipelines (4), NGS has been in effect democratized, expanding from central sequencing laboratories to individual institutions. As a result, genomics has become a highly desirable area that inspires broad international collaborations targeting diverse applications (5). Examples of global health security related applications include infectious disease diagnosis, previously unknown pathogens identification, sample archive characterization, and biosurveillance. Even though NGS technology has made high-throughput DNA sequencing more accessible, the existence of the automated instruments and streamlined procedures cannot replace the in-depth knowledge and expertise to use the instruments with high proficiency and accuracy; nor can the analytic algorithms analyze the experimental outcomes with precise interpretation. Without specialized training and technical expertise, these technology advancements cannot be fully utilized.",
