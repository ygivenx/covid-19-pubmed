In May 2009, the first cases of Influenza-A (H1N1)pdm09 were confirmed in the country. With the beginning of the epidemics, the Secretariat of Health Surveillance elaborated a system of online reporting through the web application SINAN-flu to make the registration of cases easier and more opportune. After confirmation of transmission in the country in July, the guidelines for influenza surveillance gave priority for notification and investigation of cases of influenza-associated severe acute respiratory syndrome. During that year, 48,978 cases were confirmed and 2,051 deaths occurred, mainly in Southern and Southeastern regions, with mortality rates of 3.0 and 1.2 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, respectively [6]. In S\u00e3o Paulo state, 12,002 cases were confirmed, of which 578 resulted in deaths, with a mortality rate of 1.4 per 100,000 inhabitants [7]. The epidemic initially spread through the metropolitan regions of S\u00e3o Paulo and Campinas, subsequently reaching the inner cities of the state, with a peak of transmission in the first week of August [8].",

Some studies have analyzed risk factors for severity of the disease and deaths, comparing patients hospitalized in ICUs and in wards [13,14,20\u201323], whereas one study used the rate of mortality from influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in two epidemic waves [24]. A study conducted in Australia analyzed risk factors for hospitalization due to influenza, comparing cases with controls without infection in the community [25]. Other studies have analyzed epidemiological surveillance data, including mortality rates and comparisons among deaths, hospitalizations, treatment and other factors [9,10,12,26\u201335]. Some of the factors associated with death identified in this study have been described by other authors, such as the presence of comorbidities [31,35], age\u226518years [13], obesity [15,19,20], neurological and developmental diseases [23,24,31] and immunosuppression [15,21,24,34]. Children showed lower risk of death, despite a similar proportion of treatment than adults. A similar result was observed in a study of systematic review and meta-analysis, where the risk of death was 0.28 (95% CI 0.19\u20130.141), when compared to young adults [36]. In contrast, other factors associated with severity of infection that have been reported by different researchers, such as diabetes [19,34]; other chronic pulmonary diseases, excluding asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [20]; chronic pulmonary disease, including asthma [31]; and chronic cardiovascular disease [21,24,34], were not associated with mortality in the present study. The population assessed, which was restricted to hospitalized patients with severe influenza could at least partly explain these differences. Diabetes, chronic cardiovascular and kidney disease, associated with death in univariate analysis, did not remain risk factors after multiple analysis. The design of this study, with data collected on medical charts and household interviews, allowed for adjustments in the analysis that can also explain part of these differences.",

Underreporting of SARI by health professionals is likely to have occurred, as reporting this disease was not compulsory in Brazil before the pandemic. However, during the pandemic, professionals were more sensitive to reporting it. The system for notification, which was mandatory during the epidemic, was facilitated to allow for rapid notifications. The availability of samples from autopsies of cases (deaths) could have resulted in greater access to the laboratory diagnosis of this infection. Household data collection could also have caused information bias, as data on cases were collected through interviews with family members, while data on controls were obtained from the patients themselves, when they were adults. The proportion of refusals of household interviews was higher among cases (7.3%) than controls (1.6%), p = 0.001. Another possible limitation was memory bias, as a result of the time between the hospitalization and interview. However, the information analyzed from household interviews was about socio-demographic characteristics, which is less vulnerable to information and memory bias. Data on preexisting diseases were obtained from medical charts in hospitals, where they are completed at the moment of hospitalization, in the presence of the patients. The quality of completion of medical charts can differ between hospitals. Nonetheless, information about the presence of chronic diseases, clinical management of patients, laboratory results, radiological tests and treatment was available in these charts. The difficulties encountered during data collection were minimized by the use of a standardized questionnaire.",

Another relevant result was the antiviral treatment within the first 72 hours of onset of symptoms as a protective factor, also emphasizing the need to warn the population about the importance of seeking early medical care when an influenza-like illness appears, especially among high-risk groups and those with signs of disease aggravation. Training of health professionals, especially physicians, is required for adequate clinical management of patients and early antiviral treatment.",
