In Australia a birth cohort study of Indigenous infants found a limited benefit of 7vPCV on OM compared to historic controls. No effect was observed on the proportion of children with otitis media with effusion (OME), AOM or AOMwiP at 12 months of age, however, significantly fewer vaccinees (14%) than controls (23%) experienced chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) and vaccinees experienced delayed onset of TMP [11].",

The interaction between FLUA and S. pneumoniae is well noted [17,18]. Influenza neuraminidase is demonstrated to increase pneumococcal adhesion and invasion in the Eustachian tube and middle ear [19,20]. RSV can also facilitate bacterial adhesion. Studies reveal that in the presence of RSV, certain strains of M. catarrhalis have an enhanced ability to adhere to epithelial cells [21]. Additionally, viral mediated inflammation congests the Eustachian tube and further reduces cilial function, inhibiting bacterial clearance [22,23], while viral immunosuppression can lead to bacterial superinfection [24]. Recent evidence suggests that pneumococcal load is driven by FLUA, HRV and RSV infection, and that enhanced transmission and acquisition occurs in the presence of FLUA [18,25].",
