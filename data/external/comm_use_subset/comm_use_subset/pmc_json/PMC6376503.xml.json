Ten microliters of each compound were then added using a Bravo liquid handler (Agilent), resulting in a final drug concentration of 10 \u00b5M (0.1% DMSO). Four hours after compound addition, cells were infected with 10 \u03bcL of HMPV using the MultiDrop Combi (multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 PFU/cell) and incubated for 48 h. Positive and negative controls were included on each plate. After incubation, 70 \u03bcL of 10% buffered formalin was added using a MultiDrop Combi, fixed at room temperature for 60 min, and washed 3\u00d7 with PBS-0.05% Tween (PBS-T). Plates were blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk in PBS-T for 30 min, stained with primary mAb 54G10 for 30 min, washed 3\u00d7 with PBS-T, stained with secondary anti-human IgG for 30 min, washed 3\u00d7 with PBS-T, stained with plasma membrane cell dye FM4-64 (Life Technologies) for 10 min, and washed 3\u00d7 with PBS-T. Plates were read on an Odyssey Infrared Imager (Li-Cor) using the Automatic mode with a dynamic range of 22 bits. Virus signal was read in the 800 nm channel and cell signal in the 700 nm channel. Raw fluorescence data were analyzed using an algorithm to adjust for variability across the controls on each plate and to compensate for the degree of cell toxicity in relation to the degree of viral suppression in each well. We then categorized potential hits as those that exhibited a statistically significant reduction of virus signal \u22652 standard deviations (SD) from the mean (50% inhibition of virus signal by mAb DS7).

DS7 exhibited micromolar activity, with 60% neutralization at 1.1 \u00b5g/mL and complete inhibition of HMPV at >3 \u00b5g/mL, as previously shown.10,11 To establish the reproducibility of the assay, we measured fluorescence in cells infected with HMPV and treated with or without neutralizing mAb DS7, performed in triplicate on different days, allowing us to determine well-to-well, plate-to-plate, and day-to-day variation. We used these data to measure the mean fluorescence from mAb-treated and untreated samples for determination of the coefficient of variation, which was \u00b10.17% for negative signal (cells alone) wells and \u00b10.01% for positive signal (cells + virus) wells.

HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are associated with milder disease and improved outcomes of influenza infection in humans, although the mechanism is unknown and clinical trials have offered conflicting results.16\u201319 Statins have been shown to inhibit endocytosis of influenza virus28 and HMPV enters cells by endocytosis,29 making the identification of statins and the endocytosis inhibitor chlorprothixene interesting. Indeed, statins inhibited HMPV infection by \u223c50%. However, HMPV is capable of entering cells both at the plasma membrane and via endocytosis.29\u201331 Thus, the only partial inhibition of HMPV by statins (Figure 4) may be due to preserved viral entry at the cell surface that is not inhibited by endocytosis inhibitors. Statins are competitive inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, a rate-limiting step in the mevalonate pathway. In addition to their role in inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis, statins also impact other cellular processes. Statins can inhibit prenylation of proteins as well as inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis. While there are no data on prenylation of HMPV proteins, prenylation of viral proteins is proven to be important for hepatitis D virus and thought to be important for HIV and HSV.32 Future studies may elucidate the mechanism of HMPV inhibition by statins.",
