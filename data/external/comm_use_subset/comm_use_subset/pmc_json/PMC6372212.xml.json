MHC proteins are endowed with highly variable peptide-binding domains that bind short protein fragments. The MHC region is one of the most polymorphic gene clusters in vertebrate genomes [2]. Co-evolutionary arms race with pathogens is considered largely responsible for the observed exceptionally high levels of genetic diversity [3\u20136], yet it cannot fully account for the observed geographic differences in human MHC genetic diversity [7, 8]. This indicates that, beyond MHC allelic diversity, other MHC-related factors contribute to the capacity of human populations to withstand pathogens. In this paper, we argue that peptide-binding repertoire size (or, shortly, promiscuity) of MHC alleles is one important factor.",

            "text": "Recent empirical studies demonstrated that there is a substantial variation in the size of the bound and presented antigen repertoire across MHC class I alleles. Certain MHC class I alleles appear to be promiscuous and are capable of binding an exceptionally large set of epitope peptide segments [9, 10]. For example, Paul and colleagues carried out bioinformatics analysis to predict the binding capacity of common HLA-A and HLA-B alleles to a set of 30,000 dengue virus\u2013derived peptides [11]. The analysis revealed over 16-fold variation in the number of peptides bound by the different alleles, indicating significant variation in epitope repertoire size across HLA molecules. The authors selected three alleles for further study in an in vivo transgenic mouse model. Immunization of the corresponding HLA transgenic mouse strains with a set of dengue virus\u2013derived peptides revealed a positive relationship between epitope repertoire size and immunogenicity. Similarly, Kosmrlj and colleagues computed the fraction of self-peptides that bind to various HLA-B molecules, and found that this fraction varies extensively across four HLA-B alleles [12]. The authors then demonstrated that the self-peptide\u2013binding repertoire of HLA-B shapes the native repertoire of T-cell clones developed in the thymus, with implications for recognizing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epitopes. Their results could explain why individuals carrying HLA-B*57 alleles can maintain low HIV RNA without therapy. Remarkably, analogous MHC class I alleles with the HLA-B*27 superfamily is widespread in Chinese rhesus macaques, animals which show especially slow progression of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)/HIV [13]. Finally, by focusing on seven chicken MHC class I haplotypes and four human HLA-B alleles, Chappel and colleagues demonstrated that MHC class I molecules that can bind a wide range of viral epitopes show lowered expression on the cellular surfaces of immune cells, such as monocytes and lymphocytes [9]. The authors suggested that the breadth of epitope-binding repertoire shapes genetic susceptibility to Marek\u2019s disease virus in chickens and HIV disease progression in humans.",

Prior case studies in chicken indicate that this may be so [14\u201317]. However, it remains to be established whether this relationship generally holds across MHC class I and II alleles and a wide range of infectious diseases. Specifically, we propose that in regions of high pathogen diversity, human populations should carry promiscuous MHC alleles. Moreover, as migrating human populations have been exposed to changing sets of pathogens [18], shifts in MHC promiscuity level should have occurred repeatedly and in a rapid manner during the course of human evolution.",

            "text": "To test these predictions, we first focused on the human HLA class II DRB1 gene, for several reasons. First, DRB1 is the most variable HLA class II locus, with over 2,000 registered alleles [19]. Together with HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB1 encodes the heterodimeric HLA-DR protein complex, but HLA-DRA is basically invariant. Second, DRB1 shows the strongest general signature of selection among HLA class II loci [20], while at the same time showing the weakest evidence for divergent allele advantage, an alternative mechanism at the genotype level for presenting a broader set epitopes [21]. Third, DRB1 has diversified very rapidly in the human lineage [22]. Many of the DRB1 alleles appear to be human specific and most likely evolved after the migration of ancestral human populations out of Africa [22]. These periods have been associated with human populations encountering numerous new pathogens [18, 23]. For other HLA class II loci, the level of genetic diversity is lower [19, 24], probably driven by selection for functions partly unrelated to pathogens. Notably, HLA-DQ has a fundamental role in the development of immune tolerance [25, 26], while HLA-DP contributes to the presentation of epitopes of intracellular origins [27\u201329]. Fourth, epitope-binding prediction algorithms show higher accuracy for DRB1 than for other HLA class II loci [30, 31]. Finally, the abundance of DRB1 on the cell surface is especially high compared with other HLA class II molecules [32\u201334]. Subsequently, we also evaluated promiscuity patterns of HLA class I molecules.",

The set of investigated epitopes was derived from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) and contains 2,691 peptide epitopes of 71 pathogens known to be bound by certain HLA class II alleles [38] (S1 Data). Epitopes showing high levels of amino acid similarity to each other were excluded from the analysis (See Methods). Most included epitopes are 15 to 20 amino acids long and are found in only one of the 71 pathogens (S1 Fig, S1 Data). The NetMHCIIpan algorithm was used to predict individual epitope\u2013MHC interactions [30], not least because it outperforms other prediction algorithms [31]. The breadth of epitope-binding repertoire or, shortly, the level of promiscuity of individual HLA-DRB1 alleles was estimated as the fraction of epitopes with a binding affinity stronger than 50 nM to the given MHC molecule. This threshold corresponds to high-affinity binding, which is frequently observed in MHC molecules displaying immunodominance [39]. We found large variation in promiscuity levels across HLA-DRB1 alleles (S2 Fig, S2 Data). Using a smaller dataset with information from both approaches, we show that the computationally predicted and the empirically estimated promiscuity values are strongly correlated with each other (Spearman\u2019s rho: 0.78, P = 0.004, S3 Fig). Moreover, our results are robust to changes in the affinity threshold (S4A to\nS4C Fig), usage of other prediction algorithms (S4D Fig), and variation in the epitope data employed (S4E Fig). As expected, promiscuous HLA-DRB1 alleles can present epitopes from a broader range of pathogen species (S5 Fig). Reassuringly, there was no correlation between allele promiscuity values and the amount of data per allele used for the training of the algorithm (Spearman\u2019s rho: \u22120.38, P = 0.21).",

However, these results do not exclude the possibility that the geographical link between pathogen diversity and promiscuity is indirect. More direct support on the causal relationship between the two variables comes from analysis of prior human genetic studies. To investigate this issue, we focused on two geographically widespread allelic groups with exceptionally high (HLA-DRB1*12) and exceptionally low (HLA-DRB1*03) promiscuity values, respectively, and conducted literature mining on their reported associations with infectious diseases (S3 Table). As expected, HLA-DRB1*12 was associated with protection against at least five infectious diseases, while HLA-DRB1*03 was associated with susceptibilities to eight infectious diseases, which is highly unlikely by chance (Fisher test, P = 0.003) (S3 Table, S5 Data). The data also indicate local adaptation towards elevated promiscuity under diverse pathogen pressure. The HLA-DRB1*12:02 allele is prevalent in specific regions of Southeast Asia. Compared with other alleles detected in this region, HLA-DRB1*12:02 has a relatively high promiscuity value (top 20%, Fig 2A, S2 Data). The high frequency of HLA-DRB1*12:02 has been previously suggested to reflect pathogen-driven selection during the migration of a Mongolian population to South China [43]. Indeed, this allele is associated with protection from recurrent pulmonary tuberculosis, recurrent typhoid fever, and hepatosplenic schistomiasis (S5 Data), all of which are endemic diseases in Southeast Asia [44\u201346]. Remarkably, the frequency of this allele increases with extracellular pathogen diversity in this region (Fig 2B). Together, these observations support the hypothesis that promiscuous epitope binding of HLA-DRB1 alleles is favored by selection when extracellular pathogen diversity is high.",

Under the assumption that local pathogen diversity drives the evolution of epitope recognition of HLA class II alleles, promiscuity as a molecular trait should have evolved rapidly as human populations expanded into new territories. To investigate this issue, we combined an established phylogeny of HLA-DRB1 alleles [47] with predicted epitope-binding promiscuity values. We found that alleles with a high promiscuity level have a patchy distribution across the tree (S6 Fig), indicating that high promiscuity has multiple independent origins. To investigate this observation further, we selected a set of 96 HLA-DRB1 alleles with a detectable frequency in at least one human population and appropriate sequence data (see Methods). A comparison of all pairs of these alleles revealed that even very closely related alleles show major differences in promiscuity levels (Fig 3A). For example, alleles belonging to the HLA-DRB1*13 group show over 98% amino acid sequence identity to each other, but display as much as 57-fold variation in the predicted promiscuity levels. We conclude that the switch between high and low promiscuity levels has occurred repeatedly and in a rapid manner during the allelic diversification of the HLA-DRB1 locus.",

To quantify protein sequence variability at each amino acid position, we calculated the Shannon entropy index based on the alignment of the 96 selected HLA-DRB1 alleles from above. For each position, we also calculated promiscuity fragility, that is, the median impact of single amino acid substitutions on promiscuity (see Methods). A strong positive correlation was found between Shannon entropy and promiscuity fragility (Fig 3B, Spearman\u2019s rho = 0.76, P = 0.0001). Importantly, this conclusion does not depend on how sequence polymorphism was estimated (S7 Fig). Accordingly, amino acid positions with a large impact on epitope-binding promiscuity are highly variable in human populations. Furthermore, those sites in the epitope-binding region that are under positive selection [48] tend to have high promiscuity fragility values (Wilcoxon rank sum test, P = 0.0012, Fig 3B; see also S8 Fig). The above data suggest a link between allele promiscuity and HLA-DRB1 diversification, probably as an outcome of selection for locally optimized promiscuity levels.",

In agreement with expectation, we report a positive correlation between local intracellular pathogen diversity and the HLA-A promiscuity level of the corresponding human populations (S9A and S9B Fig, S3 Data). No marked positive correlation was found for two other MHC class I genes (HLA-B and HLA-C, see S9C to\nS9F Fig, and S3 Data).

By binding short peptide segments (epitopes), MHC molecules guide both immune response against pathogens and tolerance to self-peptides. The genomic region encoding these MHC molecules is of special interest, for two reasons. It harbors more disease associations than any other regions in the human genome, including associations with infectious diseases, autoimmune disorders, tumors, and neuropsychiatric diseases [52, 53]. A growing body of literature is now revealing that certain MHC class I alleles can bind a wider range of epitopes than others, but the functional implications of this variation remain largely unknown [10]. By recognizing a larger variety of epitopes, such promiscuous MHC alleles promote immune response against a broader range of pathogens at the individual level. Therefore, promiscuous epitope binding of MHC molecules should be favored by selection in geographic regions where extracellular pathogen diversity is high. Importantly, this mechanism is conceptually distinct from the well-established concept of heterozygote advantage at the MHC [54], as it concerns individual alleles and not allele combinations or genotypes.",

First, high promiscuity may not be able to cope with the rise of novel and highly virulent pathogens. In such cases, displaying a particular epitope might be the most efficient way to achieve resistance, and high promiscuity might be suboptimal due to a reduced specificity [9, 10]. Second, high promiscuity level may elevate the risk of immune reactions against host tissues and non-harmful proteins [9, 64]. Clearly, future work should elucidate the evolutionary trade-offs between protection from pathogens and genetic susceptibility to autoimmune diseases.

Only epitopes of these species were analyzed further. All proteomes were scanned for each epitope sequence, and epitope sequences found in only one proteome (i.e., species-specific epitopes) were kept for further analysis. Highly similar epitope sequences were identified using Clustal Omega [72] and excluded as follows. A protein distance matrix was created and epitopes were discarded iteratively. In each iteration, the epitope pairs with the lowest k-tuple distance were identified. Then, the epitope with the highest average similarity to all other sequences was excluded. Iterations were repeated until distance values less than 0.5 (corresponding to greater than approximately 50% sequence identity) were eliminated from the matrix [73].

Next, populations were merged using a network-based approach. Populations were treated as nodes and two nodes were connected if their genetic distance was under a cutoff value. Populations were grouped in an iterative manner. In each iteration, all maximal cliques (i.e., subsets of nodes that are fully connected to each other) in the network were identified. Maximal cliques represent groups of populations in which all populations have similar allele compositions to each other. Then, mean genetic distance within each clique was calculated. The clique with the lowest average distance was selected and its populations were grouped together. Then, this clique was deleted from the network. Iterations were repeated until no maximal cliques remained in the network. Grouping of populations was carried out using different distance value cutoffs (1st, 5th, 10th, and 15th rank percentile of all distance values). The resulting population groups and the individual populations that remained in the network were treated as independent data points in subsequent statistical analyses.

To this end, nucleotide sequences of DRB1 alleles that contained full exon 2 and 3 regions were downloaded from the IPD-IMGT/HLA database [19]. To limit our analyses to alleles that have an impact on the inferred promiscuity level of a population, we considered only those sequences that had a nonzero frequency in at least one human population (see above). From allele groups that code for the same protein sequence (synonymous differences, differentiated by the third set of digits in the HLA nomenclature), one of the alleles was randomly chosen. This selection procedure resulted in 96 alleles. Multiple alignment of nucleotide sequences was performed using the MUSCLE algorithm as implemented in the MEGA software [77] and converted to protein sequence alignments. Amino acid distance was calculated using the Jones-Taylor-Thornton substitution model in MEGA [77] (Fig 3A). Epitope-binding region sites\u2014as defined previously [30]\u2014were excluded when calculating amino acid distance. The rationale behind this exclusion is that these sites are known to be under positive selection [78, 79] and are therefore less informative on evolutionary distance. Additionally, by removing these sites, the amino acid distance remains independent of promiscuity predictions. Finally, as intragenic recombination may distort the inference of evolutionary distance, we identified such events across all alleles following the protocol of Satta and colleagues [80] using GENECONV [81] and RDP algorithms [82] as implemented in the RDP software [83]. Recombinant alleles were removed when calculating amino acid distance.",

Large differences in promiscuity can be observed even between closely related pairs of alleles (e.g., at zero amino acid distance). As a result, there is no correlation between amino acid distance and promiscuity fold difference (Spearman\u2019s rho = 0.02, P = 0.19). Amino acid distances were binned as shown on the figure (n = 308, 1,168, 564, 654, 1,492). Violin plots show the density function of promiscuity fold difference values for allele pairs in the given bin. White circles show median values; bold black lines show the interquartile range. (B) Sequence variability of an amino acid site in the epitope-binding region of HLA-DRB1 (measured as Shannon entropy) correlates positively with the site\u2019s promiscuity fragility, measured as the median predicted promiscuity fold difference caused by a random amino acid change at the given site (see inset, Spearman\u2019s rho: 0.76, P = 0.0001). Sites that have a larger impact on promiscuity are more diverse in human populations. Line in inset represents linear regression between the two variables. The same result was obtained when promiscuity fragility was calculated based on nucleotide substitutions instead of amino acid substitutions (Spearman\u2019s rho: 0.73, P = 0.0004, see Methods) or when sequence variability was measured as nonsynonymous nucleotide diversity (\u03c0A) instead of sequence entropy (S7 Fig). Sites under positive selection as identified by Furlong and colleagues [48] show significantly higher promiscuity fragility (Wilcoxon rank sum test, P = 0.0012) and are marked with asterisks (see also S8 Fig).
