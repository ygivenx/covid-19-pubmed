From organisations that published more than five guidelines in that period (considered as regularly publishing RGs), all RGs were selected and assessed. Six investigators (RLM, MF, IDF, II, YZ, WW) independently screened titles and abstracts, and the full text of potentially relevant articles was obtained to determine eligibility. We developed and pilot tested a data abstraction form to extract information about the topics of interest. The abstraction form collected information on (1) condition evaluated; (2) guideline group member composition, (3) number of research questions requiring recommendations; (4) number of recommendations; (5) guideline\u2019s timeframe (including time spent in each step and time to completion); (6) evidence review process; (7) quality of evidence assessment procedures; (8) factors considered when formulating recommendations; (9) considerations about costs and stakeholder involvement; and (10) reasons for developing a RG instead of a standard guideline. An additional file shows the information collected in more detail (Additional file 1). For the pilot phase, four investigators (MF, II, YZ, FS) abstracted data from two RGs, namely \u2018Osteoporosis: assessing the risk of fragility fracture\u2019 and \u2018Rapid advice: Diagnosis, prevention and management of cryptococcal disease in HIV-infected adults, adolescents and children\u2019 [6, 7]. Subsequently, eight investigators (RLM, MF, IDF, II, YZ, FS, SK, LI) independently and in duplicate reviewed eligible studies and abstracted data.",

The rationale for developing RGs on influenza, Zika, anthrax, and Ebola control and management was based on the uncertainty about the disease evolution and transmission, the lack of an effective vaccine, and high mortality and morbidity. The scope of the CDC RG was broad and varied from case definitions, surveillance for different settings (e.g. schools) and treatment with antivirals. The CDC also produced RGs related to other infections (e.g. osteoarticular infections, polio vaccination, HIV prevention and prophylaxis) [20, 21, 23, 24, 29]. The reasons to develop these RGs, in general, were to present new evidence and provide recommendations to reduce the risk of disease transmission and infection. References for the tools used to assess the quality of evidence were found in RGs of WHO and NICE, but not in the CDC.",

The reasons to develop the guidelines were not explicit in the text or supplement materials; however, we suspected the impetus for formulating guidance was to benefit healthcare organisations and workers in the management of people with suspected avian influenza. Generally, these institutions did not assess the quality of evidence, except for the \u2018Interim UK guidelines for management of close community contacts of invasive group A streptococcal disease\u2019, which used the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network approach [9, 53]. The WHO Global Malaria Programme published three RGs related to malaria, varying from larva control, drugs management and pregnancy [15\u201317]. There was no description of the WHO Global Malaria Programme RG timeframe, the number of questions was not clear and the reason to conduct a RG was not reported.

Similarly, regarding group composition, patient participation was identified in all NICE guidelines, in 30% of WHO guidelines, in only one CDC guideline, and was not reported in the guidelines from other institutions. NICE guidelines described public consultation. Experts in guideline methods participated in all NICE guidelines and in 30% of WHO guidelines, but other institutions did not mention their participation. The use of tables summarising the characteristics and effects across studies or frameworks occurred in most of the NICE guidelines and approximately half of the guidelines from WHO; however, there was no description of these in the guidelines from other institutions. WHO reported the methods used to achieve consensus among members of the guideline development group in the majority of their guidelines; no other organisations mentioned their decision-making processes. Within the domain \u2018rigor of development\u2019, both WHO and NICE guidelines scored higher than the CDC and others. WHO guidelines had lower scores in the applicability domain. Only WHO and NICE consistently described the external review process for their guidelines. Regarding editorial independence, WHO guidelines achieved the highest scores compared with NICE, CDC and others. In addition, AGREE II scores for clarity of presentation were high for both WHO and NICE guidelines. The median (minimum and maximum) AGREE II overall assessment score was 6.0 (5.0\u20136.5) for NICE, 6.0 (4.5\u20136.5) for WHO and 4.5 (3.5\u20135.0) for CDC. The overall assessment score for other institutions was 5.0 (2.5\u20135.0).",

The timeframe in which guidelines are required differentiates the planning for the development of standard or rapid advice guidelines. The methods for guideline development should follow the same basic steps as for a standard guideline with modifications as required to meet the timeline dictated by the emergency. The WHO approval and quality control processes may be accelerated for this type of guideline. For example, rapid advice guidelines may be described as evidence based, but are not necessarily supported by a standard systematic review of evidence, whereas standard guidelines are expected to be supported by standard systematic evidence reviews. Additionally, the peer-review process for rapid advice guidelines may be limited to a review of the completed draft only, immediately before final clearance. Peer review may occur just before clearance and reviewers may be limited in number to between three and six experts rather than more, and precluded in some situations based on time constraints. Standard guidelines require a more complete peer-review process. In comparison, more comprehensive peer review is required for standard guidelines, including a review of the questions, a review of the evidence tables and draft recommendations, and a record of responses to the peer review and changes made to the document. Rapid advice guidelines require a defined date and plan for updating or conversion to a standard guideline.",

Standard systematic reviews often take from 6 months to 1 year to complete [58]. To address requests for literature reviews in shorter time periods and to facilitate informed decision-making and understand the credibility of rapid reviews, their methods should be explicit and transparent [59]. Butler [60], studying rapid assessments, identified that selection bias, publication bias and language of publication bias may be introduced when using literature that is readily accessible to a researcher. Ganann et al. [58] noted that rapid reviews with shorter timeframes (1\u20133 months) were often less systematic in their search for evidence than those with longer timeframes (3\u20136 months). Another study by Watt et al. [61] showed that full reviews were more likely than rapid reviews to report clinical outcomes, economic factors and social issues, and to provide greater depth of information and detail in recommendations. The authors suggested that using rapid reviews might lead to uncertainty around the conclusions drawn and inability to answer certain types of questions (e.g. economic analyses). However, they found that, although the scope of rapid reviews is limited, they can provide adequate advice for clinical and policy decisions. For RG developers, considering the amount of resources required to maintain quality in a short timeframe remains a challenge but can be overcome by working in larger and qualified teams [59, 60]. In fact, remaining systematic in the identification and use of evidence is equally important for RGs as it is for standard guidelines and RGs should not rely on expert opinion without stating the evidence from which this opinion is formed.",

Shekelle et al. [66] suggest that identification of potential barriers to the implementation of recommendations and strategies for guideline dissemination should be addressed in the guidelines. WHO emphasised that the RGs should be developed only for situations where dissemination and implementation would be feasible when considering the health systems, acceptability of the intervention, training and resources available [1]. While RGs may be developed in a transparent manner and with methodological rigor, the implementation should also be evaluated to assess the impact of RGs.",

There are a wide variety of terms and definitions used among the organisations for RGs, which made it difficult to identify them and assess their methodology and characteristics.

In response to the avian influenza pandemic (H5N1), WHO developed a RG within 4 months using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. When assessed using AGREE II, this guideline was determined to be of high quality. Although one of the authors of the current article was an author of that guideline, the assessment of the guideline using AGREE II was conducted by authors not involved in developing that guideline. Preceding uptake of rapid guideline development in the WHO handbook, the authors of the guidelines explicitly reported the methods used. The authors attributed the transparency and the short amount of time used to prepare the guideline (4 months) to utilising the GRADE approach and methods developed for the WHO shortly before the guideline work began [55]. They suggested that the time can be reduced by identifying collaborating centres capable of elaborating evidence profiles and also by building up in-house capacity to reduce the time needed to organise a review team. The use of tools such as the GRADEpro Guideline Development tool (www.gradepro.org) that keep records of evidence, decisions and judgments, facilitates the development of updated RGs, as recently demonstrated in WHO delamanide and bedaquiline guidelines for multi-drug resistant tuberculosis [67].",

The methods used to assess the quality of evidence, the consensus process and the management of the conflicts of interests were not always transparent.
