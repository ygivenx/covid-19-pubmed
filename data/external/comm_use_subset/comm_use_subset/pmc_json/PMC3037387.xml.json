            "text": "In the event of the emergence of a new human influenza A strain with a high case fatality rate indicating the possibility of a global pandemic with severe impact, control strategies primarily aim at limiting morbidity and mortality rather than halting transmission completely. This is because transmission of influenza A is difficult to block due to its short generation time and efficient transmission characteristics [1]. In the early days of the H1N1 influenza pandemic in Mexico in 2009 [2], social distancing measures were implemented with the aim of slowing the epidemic during its early stages. For any future pandemic of a directly-transmitted infectious agent, it is expected that similar strategies will be used in high resource settings while the pathogen is being identified, epidemiological studies to both characterize transmission [3], [4], [5], [6], [7] and determine pathogenicity are completed [8], [9] and strain-specific control options, such as vaccines, are being developed [10], [11]. For influenza, policy options are clearly outlined in national pandemic plans, but there is rarely any clear statement of policy objectives\n[12]. The problem is that these different objectives are potentially conflicting in their effects, and clear prioritisation is therefore necessary. Is the aim to minimize mortality and morbidity, is it to limit the peak prevalence of serious disease so that public health resources are not overwhelmed or is it to minimise the impact of the intervention on society and economy? In this paper we form a framework for policy makers to consider these potentially conflicting objectives.",

However, none of these studies have addressed how multiple policy objectives are met by the common interventions, or how a clear statement of the key policy aims guides which set of interventions work best. It is typically assumed by policy makers that the more intervention measures implemented as early as possible in the course of the epidemic the better the outcome in terms of mitigation. Reservations about this strategic approach rest on the costs, and societal impact plus economic implications of sustaining control measures over a long period of time. In recognition of this the USA pandemic plan, for instance, mentions a maximum duration of 12 weeks for many transmission-reducing interventions [21]. However, there has been no quantitative analysis of when such an intervention should be initiated. Should it be as soon as the first cases are discovered, or later in the outbreak when more cases have arisen? Neither has it been acknowledged that planned levels of coverage with antiviral treatment or pre-pandemic vaccines may implicitly determine the magnitude of social distancing interventions required.",

Similar measures were arguably effective for H1N1 in Mexico in 2009 [3]. Strategies used then, and to be considered in future, include social distancing measures, such as school closures [24], [25], restaurant and cinema closures [26], and transport restrictions [27], [28], [29]. There are a number of other measures, such as hand washing and the use of face masks [30], which may reduce contact rates [31], [32]. Transmission will also be affected by changes in human behaviour in response to a pandemic, as was observed in travel and mixing patterns during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 [29].",

Elimination was possible due to the characteristics of the virus - post-symptomatic transmission and a long generation time [1]. Large scale reductions in the transmission rate of SARS (>70%, Figure 1, [33]) were brought about by a number of public health interventions. These interventions were held in place for several weeks. The small amount of data available perhaps suggest a trend towards lower impact interventions being held in place for longer to achieve elimination (Figure 1, open triangles), but an important driver of the duration of these interventions was the number of cases that were present when the interventions started. These empirical data from two severe outbreaks suggest that moderate reductions in influenza transmission can be achieved and maintained at a population level for a number of weeks.",

The use of antivirals for severely ill patients could have implications for occupancy and therefore availability of isolation units and high dependency beds. Whilst this might change the infectious profile of the few severely ill patients who would have access to these facilities, it does not affect the majority of cases and detailed consideration of these logistics is outside the scope of this study.

Use of an imperfect vaccine can, however, also lead to increased incidence if reductions in infectiousness are associated with corresponding increases in the infectious period [50], [51]. Effectiveness estimates for a pre-pandemic vaccine are not available, but evidence from cross-protection studies led to the assumption that both susceptibility to infection and infectiousness may be reduced by 30% [13], [52].

The use of a pre-pandemic vaccine means that interventions which contain the total number of cases and peak prevalence can be rolled out later (Figure 5A), compared to the non-vaccination scenario. Also, as can be seen from the simple cost function (Figure 5B), the level of intervention can be reduced if pre-pandemic vaccines are used. The true economic value of this reduction in costs depends on the relative costs of vaccination, cases and interventions. The general picture remains the same as without vaccination. To minimize peak prevalence, the intervention should be initiated earlier than to minimize costs, but both objectives require interventions that commence several weeks into the epidemic growth phase (Figure 5B). Sensitivity to the value of R\n0 or the effectiveness of the pre-pandemic vaccine highlights that once again the most robust strategies are those that are minimize peak prevalence (Figure 5C).",

There may be delays before control strategies are implemented due to difficulties in identifying the early stages of a novel outbreak [53], as well as other logistical, political and economic constraints. Of course, if interventions are held in place until a pandemic vaccine is available a greater level of reduction and earlier start of intervention will result in fewer cases, and a lower peak prevalence and incidence if intervention starts before the peak. However, not only are the costs of an intervention held for a long time likely to be high, but high demand for health services will be extended over a longer time period. Our results indicate that an intervention starting at a few weeks into the epidemic is almost as effective at reducing epidemic size and peak prevalence as one starting at week 0. As such, given that the social and economic burden will be greater when starting earlier, starting a little bit later may be a better policy option. However, this will crucially depend on the socio-economic costs of both cases and interventions and on the estimated severity of the epidemic, which may be uncertain in the early stages of the epidemic [8].",

Interventions of limited duration are very likely to result in a resurgence of the epidemic once they are lifted, unless it is imposed late in the epidemic or with low effectiveness. However, the height of this resurgence can be managed. A twelve-week interventions minimizing peak logistical pressure (peak prevalence and incidence) need not be very strong but require a timely start. On the other hand, an intervention that minimizes total epidemic size needs to be stronger and can start later, preventing a second peak.",

It has not previously been highlighted that the level of stockpiles will quantitatively affect the required magnitude of social-distancing interventions so that all those who require treatment will receive it. Any level of stockpiled antiviral drugs will reduce morbidity and mortality and therefore reduces the need for transmission-reducing interventions, as not all cases need to be prevented, but the availability of drugs means that demand for these drugs should not exceed supply.

Detailed investigations are required to tailor general policies to particular settings, and therefore we are not attempting to make quantitative policy recommendations (see Box 1). However, uncertainties with regard to characteristics of the next pandemic strain will make it difficult in general to do very detailed optimization analyses. Decisions on stockpiling must be based on knowledge from previous pandemics and seasonal influenza, but when a pandemic is at hand one has to work with the stockpiles available. Intervention measures can be additionally imposed if a shortage of drugs is expected, or lifted to reduce the impact of intervention on society and economy, if drug supplies permit. Our analyses show that there is indeed some time to choose the appropriate level of control, as very early commencement of intervention is hardly ever optimal for these time-limited interventions.",

This highlights the need to include more robust economic constraints into future epidemiological model analyses for public health policy support. In our view, this is a more urgent need than that of increasing the complexity of epidemiological description within models of infectious disease control. Concomitantly, there is the associated need for measurement of the appropriate cost functions. Data is available for both drug and vaccine purchase but this is regarded as confidential at present as neither the pharmaceutical industry nor government health departments are keen to say how much was paid per dose as a function of total volume purchased. Future research must address the detail of cost and benefit, both in terms of measurement of direct and indirect socio-economic costs, the costs of stockpiling and the benefits of reducing the impact of the epidemic and in terms of using a template for analysis that reflects the dynamics of virus transmission and the impact of control measures.",

C Excess number of cases for the five strategies if the parameters of the epidemic are different to those for which these interventions were designed: the pre-pandemic vaccine is less effective (black), transmission has been overestimated and R\n0 = 1.7 (dark grey), or transmission has been underestimated and R\n0 = 2 (light grey).",
