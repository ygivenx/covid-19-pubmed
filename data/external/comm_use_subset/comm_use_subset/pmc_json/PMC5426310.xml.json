            "text": "There is little doubt that Chan and other senior WHO officials were too slow to realise the extent to which the outbreak in Guinea-foresti\u00e8re posed a wider epidemic threat or that the virus would rapidly spread across borders, overwhelming the health capacities of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone \u2013 three of the poorest countries in West Africa \u2013 to infest three cities simultaneously (Conakry, Monrovia, Freetown). However, if so, then they were not alone. In 2014 most experts considered Ebola a disease of remote forested regions of equatorial Africa. Indeed, the key observation from the previous eleven large outbreaks of Ebola was that such outbreaks tended to be self-limiting and that it was only when the virus entered a nosocomial setting with low standards of hygiene and sanitation that it became a source of epidemic amplification. This was particularly the case where hospital workers failed to employ appropriate barrier-nursing techniques and ignored standard hygiene measures, such as bans on the reuse of syringes and hypodermic needles.\n16\n As David Heymann, the head of Chatham House\u2019s Centre on Global Health Security and a veteran of several Ebola outbreaks in Africa, explained at a meeting at Chatham House in May 2014 called to \u2018measure the risk\u2019 of the outbreak in Guinea, with proper hygiene controls and barrier nursing Ebola was \u2018it\u2019s own worst enemy\u2026[because] it\u2019s too virulent to sustain its transmission\u2019.\n17\n Pierre Rollin, a French-born viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF) expert at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, was similarly unconcerned by the outbreak in Guinea. Dispatched to Conakry in March to build bridges with the Guinean government and assess the situation on the ground, Rollin returned to Atlanta in May believing that cases had peaked and that the virus would rapidly burn itself out. \u2018It looked like, smells like, tastes like regular outbreaks in previous areas,\u2019 he recalled thinking to himself at the time.\n18\n This was despite his awareness of a 1982 paper in the Annales de L\u2019Institut Pasteur which had found that people treated for Lassa fever at a hospital in Lofa county, Liberia, just across the Guinean border, carried antibodies to both Lassa and Ebola, suggesting the filovirus had been present in the region for some time and that earlier Ebola infections might have been missed.\n19\n\n",

            "text": "The framing of Ebola as a \u2018hot virus\u2019 owes much to the work of New Yorker journalist Richard Preston and the simultaneous outbreaks that occurred in 1976 at a Catholic mission in Yambuku in the DRC (Democratic Republic of Congo, former Zaire) and Sudan. Although Ebola outbreaks had most likely occurred before in other parts of central Africa, this was the first to come to the attention of international health responders and result in the identification of the filovirus.\n20\n In his 1994 bestselling book The Hot Zone, Preston had focused on the most lurid and visually shocking symptoms of Ebola, such as the way that in the last stage of illness patients sometimes \u2018bled out\u2019, leaking blood and haemorrhagic fluids from their eyes, noses and intestines. Even though such symptoms occur in only about half of Ebola cases they helped fix the idea that Ebola was, as Preston put it, \u2018a perfect parasite\u2026[that] transforms virtually every part of the body into a digested slime of virus particles\u2019.\n21\n Through the imaginative use of flypapers marked with biosafety hazard warnings, Preston also reinforced the impression of Ebola as a potential biowarfare agent, one that could emerge from the jungles of Africa, or the laboratory of a deranged terrorist, to threaten global health security at any time. As King points out, this framing of Ebola owes much to an outbreak that occurred in 1989 at a primate quarantine facility in Reston, Virginia, just across the Potomac from Washington DC.\n22\n Triggered by an Ebola subtype harboured by monkeys imported from the Philippines, the Reston ebolavirus spread rapidly between primates kept in different rooms in the quarantine facility, raising the prospect that Ebola was capable of aerosol transmission and prompting scientists to euthanise the monkeys and decontaminate the premises. Although the outbreak resulted in four subclinical infections in laboratory workers, in the event no humans died and it was concluded that concerns that Ebola might be a viable aerosol were overblown. Nevertheless, the proximity of the outbreak to the US capital underlined Ebola\u2019s threat to US national security, resulting in its selection for a war-game exercise at a meeting of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene in Honolulu the same year.\n23\n\n",

            "text": "More significantly, the Reston incident contributed to Ebola appearing alongside an iconic list of EIDs highlighted in an influential report on \u2018Emerging Infections\u2019 by the Institute of Medicine (IoM). Prior to 1992, epidemiologists had referred to Ebola as a \u2018new\u2019 infectious disease.\n24\n Its inclusion in a list that contained HIV, the cause of the recent AIDS pandemic, immediately elevated its political status. According to the IoM, EIDs were a special group of new diseases associated with \u2018clinically distinct conditions whose incidence in humans has increased\u2019 and for which \u2018emergence may be due to the introduction of a new agent, to the recognition of an existing disease that has gone undetected, or to a change in the environment that provides an epidemiologic \u201cbridge\u201d \u2019.\n25\n Interestingly, at this point it was not clear how many of these criteria applied to Ebola as its presumed animal reservoir was, and still is, unknown, making the role of environmental change in the transfer of the virus from animals to human hosts speculative. Indeed, the virus\u2019s inclusion in this list appears to have been largely a result of the Reston incident and the way that the outbreak revealed the risk that the commercial trade in research primates posed for the carriage and spread of potentially deadly rain forest pathogens across international borders \u2013 a theme that would assume increasing importance in books on emerging infections published subsequent to the IoM report.\n26\n It is also worth noting that the authors of the report took pains to challenge the assumption that such emergence events were always or largely due to spontaneous mutations in animal viruses and their adaptation to new hosts. On the contrary, the authors pointed to the significance of several other factors, including changing human demographics and behaviour, economic development and land use, and the breakdown of public health measures.\n27\n All three of these would prove highly relevant to the emergence of Ebola in West Africa in 2013\u201316.\n28\n\n",

            "text": "Unfortunately, these perspectives would be obscured when, after a nearly twenty-year hiatus, Ebola emerged for a second time in 1995, causing an outbreak in Kikwit, a city in the DRC. Coming in the wake of the popular success of The Hot Zone, the outbreak sparked tremendous press interest, transforming the emergency response into a media circus.\n29\n The result was that it was Preston\u2019s and not the IoM\u2019s more measured assessment of the risks posed by EIDs that shaped the view of Ebola in policy circles in Washington in the mid to late 1990s, resulting in what one virologist described as a \u2018shower of funding\u2019 for vaccine research.\n30\n The highpoint of this trend came in around 2008/09 when, in the wake of the 2002 anthrax attacks and the Bush administration\u2019s war on terror, the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) was awarded $4.7 billion for research into vaccines for Ebola and other VHFs. However, by 2013, following the conclusion of the war in Iraq, NIAID\u2019s funding had fallen to $4.3 billion, the same level as in 2009.\n31\n In the absence of compensating investment from the private sector, this funding freeze was later blamed for the fact that when Ebola re-emerged in West Africa in 2014 there were no licensed vaccines or drugs ready for deployment to the Ebola zone.\n32\n\n",

            "text": "King and others have argued that the IoM report marked the moment when infectious diseases began to be regarded as security threats, rather than merely as threats to health and free trade, and their surveillance became the object of a new paradigm of global health governance.\n33\n Tracing this paradigm shift is beyond the scope of this paper but a key moment came in 1994 when the WHO established the Division of Emerging and Other Communicable Diseases Surveillance to improve surveillance of EIDs and co-ordinate relations with NGOs, expert advisors and collaborating centres on the ground. This was followed, six years later, by the establishment of the WHO\u2019s Global Outbreak and Response Network (GOARN) to enable the rapid mobilisation of knowledge and expertise relating to EIDs.\n34\n However running alongside these securitisation discourses, was a very different construction of Ebola, one that configured it as just another haemorrhagic fever endemic to the central African rainforest. By 2004 genomic analysis had demonstrated that while the genes of Ebola subtypes were sufficiently different from one another to warrant their own place on its phylogenetic tree, overall the virus showed a high degree of genomic stability.\n35\n According to some experts, this suggested that concerns that Ebola might mutate into an \u2018Andromeda strain\u2019 were overblown.\n36\n Rather, the genetic differences suggested that each subtype had emerged from an animal reservoir in an area geographically isolated from other subtypes in or near the site where transmission to humans and non-human primates had first occurred.\n37\n Moreover, while the Yambuku outbreak had seen case mortality rates as high as 90 per cent, in Kikwit the mortality rate had been 78 per cent, while in an outbreak in Gabon the following year the mortality rate had been 57 per cent.\n38\n Clearly, for all the concerns about Ebola\u2019s virulence, infection was not an automatic death sentence. Even in large outbreaks, such as had occurred in Gulu, Uganda, in 2000\u201301, or in Gabon and Congo in 2001\u201302, casualties had numbered in the hundreds. Indeed, in the two dozen outbreaks of Ebola prior to 2014, the virus had been responsible for a total of just 2200 infections and 1500 deaths.\n39\n Compared to AIDS, or more widely prevalent tropical diseases such as malaria, this made Ebola more of a nuisance than an urgent public health threat, one that, it was thought, could be managed through close epidemiological and laboratory surveillance, coupled with the rapid deployment of experts trained in the containment of VHFs to the foci of outbreaks. As Daniel Bausch, a haemorrhagic fever specialist based at Tulane University, and Pierre Rollin put it in a 2004 review of the lessons learned from the Ebola outbreaks in Uganda, Gabon and Congo: \u2018In most instances, what likely converts low-level endemic transmission to an epidemic is nosocomial amplification in the context of the incomplete health care infrastructure commonly found in tropical Africa in recent decades\u2019. The problem, they thought, was that all too often ill-equipped \u2018Western-style hospitals\u2019 staffed by doctors and nurses with little experience of Ebola had created a \u2018fertile ground for epidemic EHF [Ebola Haemorrhagic Fever]\u2019. But rather than adopt a more critical epistemology of EIDs \u2013 one that took seriously the other factors in emergence identified in the IoM report, such as broken health systems and changing land use patterns \u2013 they simply called for the WHO to adapt GOARN to the technical exigencies of Ebola. Even as Bausch and Rollin bought into this emergency response model, however, they could not help but express doubts about the WHO\u2019s ability to rapidly detect Ebola outbreaks and judge whether they necessitated the activation of GOARN. Crucially, this had as much to do with the shifting construction of Ebola as it did with the WHO\u2019s management expertise and choices about the allocation of resources. \u2018EHF poses a unique problem \u2013 too rare to merit a large investment in each African community, yet too virulent to completely ignore,\u2019 they concluded. The result was a \u2018predicament\u2019 in which the international community was faced with \u2018attempting to balance the inevitable preponderance of false alarms across the African continent with readiness for rapid action when the real emergency occurs\u2019.\n40\n\n",

            "text": "Though the rarity of Ebola outbreaks coupled with the virulence of the virus presented a problem for the governance of Ebola, it should not have been insuperable. As the above review demonstrates, the measures needed to control and limit the spread of Ebola were well known to VHF experts. Moreover, through GOARN and agencies such as the CDC, there was plenty of expertise that could be brought to bear on the problem of an Ebola epidemic. Indeed, during the SARS outbreak the WHO had won plaudits for its rapid mobilisation of international experts, thereby averting what could have been a much worse crisis.\n41\n In the case of Ebola, however, GOARN does not appear to have functioned in the way it was intended. Following the confirmation on 22 March 2014 of EBOV in blood samples forwarded by MSF from Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou to the Institut Pasteur in Lyons, the WHO dispatched an interdisciplinary team equipped with diagnostics and protective equipment to Guinea-foresti\u00e8re. By mid-April Geneva was co-ordinating some sixty-five foreign epidemic experts in Guinea, including a team from the CDC.\n42\n Those numbers doubled as Ebola spread to Sierra Leone and Liberia, but by mid-May, as people presenting with Ebola at clinics and treatment centres declined, GOARN was wound down. Kamradt-Scott points out that in previous Ebola outbreaks the WHO had dispatched an average of just two to five experts to the foci of Ebola epidemics and that it is unfair to blame the WHO for not mobilising a more comprehensive technical response in 2014 given that the organisation\u2019s \u2018primary task has always been to coordinate, only assisting governments upon request\u2019.\n43\n Moreover, when in June epidemiological evidence pointed to a resurgence of infections in the tri-border region, the WHO rapidly increased the deployment of personnel to the Ebola zone. The result was that by the conclusion of the epidemic the WHO had deployed 1000 experts to West Africa.\n44\n However, David Heymann, the WHO\u2019s former Executive Director for Communicable Diseases and one of the architects of GOARN, believes that officials in Geneva could and should have done more. \u2018For some reason, after the initial response was made, GOARN and the partners, including the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the US, thought there was no longer a concern and so they left,\u2019 Heymann said. \u2018Normally, what GOARN does is waits until they\u2019ve been able to verify for two full incubation periods, a time period of in this case 42 days\u2019.\n45\n\n",

            "text": "Why this did not happen in Guinea is unclear. One explanation suggested by the emails obtained by AP is that a key factor may have been the reluctance of the Guinean government to acknowledge the full extent of the outbreak, coupled with the understandable concern of WHO officials in Geneva that declaring a pheic might trigger negative measures, such as border closings and travel bans, that could hinder business and the dispatch of health workers to the Ebola zone.\n46\n However, another is that in the previous two decades Ebola had undergone what Lakoff calls a \u2018conceptual mutation\u2019 so that by 2014 the virus was no longer seen as \u2018the source of a potentially catastrophic global epidemic\u2019. Instead, Lakoff suggests that experts approached the West African outbreak with \u2018relative confidence\u2019, believing that Ebola could be \u2018managed via localized humanitarian care combined with straightforward public health techniques\u2019. In short, Ebola was no longer \u2018the novel and fearsome virus that helped spark attention and resources to the phenomenon of \u201cemerging infectious disease\u201d in the late 1980s and early 1990s\u2019.\n47\n\n",

Ever since the 2003 SARs outbreak, the central challenge facing global health authorities has been to detect and contain outbreaks of novel pathogens before they spark international emergencies, without compromising the sovereignty of states over the regulation of epidemic risks. Under the IHR (2005), which revised and replaced the earlier 1969 regulations, this was to be achieved by encouraging WHO member states to take greater responsibly for the ongoing management of disease threats within their borders, by increasing surveillance and risk assessment at ports of entry and exit, and by strengthening core health capacities. At the same time, the regulations provided a framework for co-ordinated and proportionate responses to urgent disease threats that were beyond countries\u2019 core capacities and which the WHO deemed presented a significant risk of regional or international spread. In such circumstances, affected countries would gain access to GOARN, enabling the WHO to dispatch up to 300 technical and operational experts to the site of an outbreak and feed information back to Geneva. Once apprised of this information, the WHO\u2019s director general would then be in a position to determine whether a country\u2019s response was adequate or whether there was risk of international spread, in which case the director general had the authority to declare a pheic.\n48\n\n",

            "text": "To the extent that the revised regulations encouraged states to become active managers of the health of their populations they can be seen as part of what Elbe calls a late twentieth-century trend towards the \u2018medicalisation of security\u2019.\n49\n Taking up these insights, Bingham and Hinchcliffe suggest that one of the characteristics of modern biosecurity regimes is that they seek to regulate the flow of \u2018good\u2019 things (trade, tourists, political refugees) across territorial boundaries, while simultaneously limiting the flow of potential security threats (pathogens, terrorists, economic migrants). Underpinning these biosecurity regimes are both active and passive forms of surveillance, with the latter, in theory, acting as a check or failsafe on the former.\n50\n Such regimes are far from perfect, however. Furthermore, to the extent that they require state and non-state actors to make nuanced judgements as to when an outbreak constitutes a risk of \u2018international spread\u2019 they are open to interpretation. This was precisely the dilemma that faced Chan in 2009 when the sudden emergence of a new swine influenza A virus in Mexico raised the prospect of a global flu pandemic. In response, Chan convened an advisory committee of experts, known as the Emergency Committee, to weigh the evidence and declare a pheic. However, that decision backfired when it became clear that the H1N1 virus was no more severe than a seasonal flu and that many committee members had associations with vaccine manufacturers \u2013 the principal beneficiaries of Chan\u2019s announcement.\n51\n\n",

It was the GEMT\u2019s job to conduct risk assessments and decide when an event with public health consequences required a response from the WHO. Once the ERF had been triggered, it was for committee members and officials in Geneva, together with the appropriate country office, to decide to what extent the WHO was required to provide emergency support, the urgency of the response and the appropriate grading level. However, this grading process was separate from other international emergency classification procedures, including the procedures laid out in the IHR (2005), and was the responsibility of a separate managerial team within the WHO headed by Bruce Aylward, assistant director-general for polio and emergencies. Infectious disease outbreaks other than polio were the remit of Keiji Fukuda and were subject to another set of procedures.

To see how such considerations can influence the WHO\u2019s assessments of infectious disease risks one only has to contrast Chan\u2019s decision not to raise the alert level for Ebola with her decision in May 2014 to declare a pheic in relation to polio. Unlike Ebola, polio is a highly eradicable disease. An easy to administer oral vaccine has existed since the 1950s and although mutations in vaccinated individuals can lead to the emergence of new vaccine-derived strains of the disease these can be neutralised by immunisation with killed polio vaccines. Indeed, since the launch of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative in 1988 the world has seen dramatic declines in the incidence of polio. By 2013 this effort had led to the near cessation of polio transmission. However, in 2014 there was a resurgence of polio in Afghanistan and Pakistan. In addition, outbreaks were recorded in six previously polio-free non-endemic countries, including Somalia, Equatorial Guinea, Syria and Iraq, due to the spread of the virus across international borders. Interestingly, these were states that, like Sierra Leone and Liberia, had been plagued by war and civil conflicts \u2013 some of which were ongoing \u2013 and which had left the countries with severely compromised immunisation services and weakened health systems. However, the key reason the Emergency Committee gave for the declaration of a pheic was not that without outside intervention these states would be unable to prevent the re-infection of their populations, but because \u2018if unchecked, this situation could result in failure to eradicate globally one of the world\u2019s most serious vaccine-preventable diseases\u2019.\n54\n No such programmatic goals or bureaucratic interests were threatened by the sudden emergence of EBOV in Guinea-foresti\u00e8re, however. Nor, when Ebola began to spread across the border to Sierra Leone and Liberia and calls mounted for the WHO to take more robust action, did the agency alter its policy of maintaining a watching brief. Had there been a vaccine or an arsenal of drugs ready to be deployed, as had been the case during the 2009 swine flu pandemic, things might have been different, but by 2013 Ebola research had ground to a halt.\n55\n Nor, despite repeated calls for a network of reporting laboratories in Africa equipped with emergency diagnostic tests for Ebola and other EHFs, had such calls been heeded.\n56\n In short, Ebola had become a neglected disease.",

Initially, this Ebola was only apparent to the early responders on the ground.

Present at those briefings was Oliver Johnson, a medic and global health specialist from King\u2019s College London who had arrived in Freetown a year earlier to establish a partnership with the Connaught Hospital. Mindful of the reports coming out of Guinea, Sierra Leone\u2019s then health minister Miatta Kargbo convened an Ebola task force and invited WHO officials and representatives of MSF, the Red Cross, GOAL and UNICEF to participate. As a newcomer to the NGO sector with no experience of Ebola, Johnson was looking to more experienced hands for guidance, but the message he took home from both WHO and MSF officials was that there was nothing to fear because \u2018there\u2019s never been a major urban outbreak of Ebola, there\u2019s no risk of this\u2019. By late April, as the initial surge in cases in Guinea began to slow and WHO experts thought the epidemic had peaked, officials became even more complacent. \u2018People were saying, \u201cOh it\u2019s in Liberia and Guinea, but we\u2019ve done such a good job, we\u2019ve dodged a bullet,\u201d Johnson recalled. \u201cMaybe Sierra Leone won\u2019t have too many cases\u201d\u2019.\n57\n The complacency of officials in Sierra Leone contrasts with the urgent messages from WHO fieldworkers in Conakry who by mid-April were warning of spreading \u2018panic and fear\u2019 and urging Geneva that containment of the outbreak required a \u2018drastic change of course\u2019.\n58\n These communications appear to have had little impact, however. On 17 April, 2014, Geneva upgraded the emergency to grade 2 and warned that the outbreak might require intensive surveillance and response activities for a further two to four months, but by mid-May the WHO was reporting that the outbreak was slowing, persuading several international NGOs, although not MSF, to redeploy their staff to other countries.\n59\n\n",

Muyembe, who was in Liberia at the time, immediately returned to Kinshasa and dispatched community relay teams to the site of the outbreak in Jeera County, Equateur Province, to facilitate safe but dignified burials in accordance with traditional customs.

Retrospective genetic analysis of virus samples taken from 78 Ebola patients in Sierra Leone between May and mid-June subsequently showed that at least 14 had been infected at the healer\u2019s funeral, giving rise to two distinct lineages of the virus.\n79\n Tragically, one lineage was traced to a nurse who, instead of seeking treatment at a clinic in Kailahun, where staff had been trained to watch out for Ebola patients, had bypassed the hospital and driven through the night to Daru, her home village. In the process, she infected a truck driver and four other people, setting off new transmission chains all over Sierra Leone.\n80\n The result was that there was a delay of at least four weeks between Ebola entering Sierra Leone and recognition of the first cases, a period in which infectious contacts were able to diffuse the virus throughout Kailahun and Kenema, challenging Sierra Leone\u2019s capacity to contain the outbreak on its eastern borders.

However, Kenema was also a stronghold of the opposition Sierra Leone People\u2019s Party and during the civil war it and Kailahun had been centres of rebel activity. The result was that when ambulances carrying Ebola patients began arriving in Kenema, rumours began spreading that the epidemic was a plot by the ruling All People\u2019s Congress party and that nurses on the wards were deliberately infecting patients with Ebola in order to attract foreign aid for the benefit of the political elite in Freetown.\n84\n Dr Sheik Humarr Khan, the hospital\u2019s chief physician and the country\u2019s leading Lassa specialist, who managed the Lassa Fever Research Programme with Tulane, attempted to counteract these rumours by travelling to the epicentre of the outbreak in Kailahun to hold a series of educational workshops. But villagers resisted his entreaties to evacuate suspect cases to Kenema for testing. Opposition was particularly fierce in the healer\u2019s home town of Koindu where the population erected roadblocks and broke the windshield of Khan\u2019s government-issued Toyota. \u2018There were rumours that we were coming to give them disease,\u2019 said Robert Garry, a VHF specialist from Tulane who had flown to Kenema to assist Khan. \u2018They said we would take people away and never come  back\u2019.\n85\n Tragically, it would take the death from Ebola of several Kenema nurses and laboratory staff, followed, at the end of July, by the death of Khan himself, to convince WHO officials in Freetown that this was unlike previous Ebola outbreaks and required exceptional measures (see Figure 2).\n86\n\n",

A good example came at Foya Borma hospital in Lofa district, the site of what is widely believed to have been Liberia\u2019s index case. CDC epidemiologists traced the introduction of Ebola there to a woman who had arrived from Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou in April.

By contrast, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea had escaped the worst of the AIDs pandemic but also missed out on many of the HIV-related investments that have had positive health benefits for the control of other diseases.\n93\n Indeed, when Sawyer fell sick he reportedly used his influence with Liberian finance ministry officials to board a flight to Lagos calculating he would receive better treatment in the Nigerian capital.

Expressing bafflement as to why \u2018early warnings\u2026did not result in an effective and adequate response\u2019, Stocking concluded that what had been lacking was \u2018independent and courageous decision-making by the Director-General and the WHO Secretariat\u2019. Stocking recommended that to avoid such mistakes in future the WHO should consider an intermediate level of alert to draw the attention of the global health community to events falling between routine public health risks and those that might require the declaration of a pheic.\n102\n\n",

Rather than focusing on the relationship between officials in Geneva and AFRO and the structure of the WHO, I have suggested it would be more profitable to examine the discursive and non-discursive practices that produced Ebola as a \u2018problem\u2019 for global health security. Answering that question, has led to a consideration of the history of Ebola and the shifting medical and security constructions of the virus. Central to those constructions was Ebola\u2019s framing as an iconic EID and potential biowarfare agent in the early 1990s \u2013 constructions that can be traced back to the Reston incident, the IoM report, and the popularity of books like The Hot Zone. However, while these constructions of Ebola were highly effective at unlocking research dollars and mobilising political attention, they also obscured other constructions of the virus and ways of responding to Ebola outbreaks. The result was that as haemorrhagic fever experts became familiar with the clinical management and containment of Ebola, and as Ebola began to be configured as a rare disease of remote forested regions of central Africa, so the virus slipped down the ranking of global health and international security concerns.",

            "text": "This relegation of Ebola to the fringes of global health security is nowhere better illustrated than by the position it occupied in the decision instrument for pheics in the IHR (2005). Unlike outbreaks of smallpox, polio or new influenza subtypes, which required automatic notification to the WHO, Ebola was subjected to a set of algorithms and triage mechanisms that enabled officials to judge when and at what point and an outbreak might pose a \u2018significant risk of international spread\u2019 and might require a higher grade alert and, possibly, the declaration of a pheic. By applying managerial procedures contained in the ERF to these determinations, the aim was to introduce transparency into the deliberations of expert advisors, thereby avoiding the accusations of conflicts of interest that had greeted the WHO\u2019s declaration of a pheic during the 2009 swine flu outbreak. At the same time, the IHR (2005) sought to encourage member states to strengthen core health capacities and take greater responsibility for the regulation of EID risks originating within their borders. The net result was to shift the burden for biosurveillance onto states that were ill-equipped to make such judgements and to de-emphasise the threat posed by Ebola at precisely the moment when the virus was crossing international borders for the first time.",

That they chose not to is testimony to the extent to which by 2014 Ebola had become an object of medical and political neglect. Unlike polio, Ebola did not threaten to undermine long-standing WHO programmes and investments in disease eradication. Nor were there vaccines and drugs ready for deployment to the Ebola zone. On the contrary, research into promising investigational Ebola products had ceased to be a priority.",

            "text": "Even if Ebola medications had been available, WHO officials, like other experts, had little reason to believe that Ebola posed a wider epidemic threat to the region. This was because in the past the rapid isolation of infectious patients and the speedy burial of victims, coupled with contact tracing and other control measures, had greatly foreshortened transmission chains. And even where, as in Kikwit in 1995, the virus had been circulating in the community for thirteen weeks before the deaths of health workers brought it to the attention of international experts, once GOARN had been activated the outbreak was quickly brought under control. In short, as WHO officials informed Oliver Johnson in Freetown in March 2014, \u2018Ebola doesn\u2019t cause urban outbreaks\u2019. But, of course, Ebola had never been observed as far west as Guinea before. Nor had previous outbreaks occurred close to the borders of three countries or in a region where protracted civil wars had left weakened and fragmented health systems and a legacy of distrust between rural populations and urban political elites. Nor had previous outbreaks visited border regions with such mobile populations or where new road and transport systems had greatly reduced travel times between villages and cities.",

This paralysis is best understood as a result of the misleading early media reports from Guinea and Liberia \u2013 reports that played on the popular image of Ebola as a highly infectious hot virus with the ability to cause severe haemorrhaging and other terrifying clinical symptoms. By contrast, communities in the affected countries did not buy into this image of Ebola; instead, their fears were driven by rumours about the \u2018real\u2019 motivations of foreign medical teams and distrust of ETUs. Social resistance was further aggravated by bans on traditional burials and the failure to adopt community engagement methods that had proved so effective in winning the trust of rural populations during Ebola outbreaks in other parts of Africa \u2013 evidence of yet another aspect of the neglect of knowledge of Ebola. The net result was to depress the true level of Ebola infections in Guinea and persuade WHO officials that there was no need for further deployment within GOARN.",

On the contrary, like the \u2018false alarm\u2019 over swine flu in 2009, such \u2018missed alarms\u2019 may be an inescapable consequence of pandemic preparedness systems that seek to rationalise responses to novel emergence events.",
