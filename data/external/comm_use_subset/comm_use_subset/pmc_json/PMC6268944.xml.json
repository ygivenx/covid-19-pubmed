The final compounds are 14-membered macrocycles with variations in stereochemistry and amino acid side chains. The side chain variations are limited in comparison with those possible, but nonetheless illustrate the ability to form the macrocycles regardless of stereochemistry or larger side chains. Indeed, macrocycles are underrepresented in screening libraries due in part to their synthetic challenge [28,29], and this work is an important first step in the development of imidazole-4,5-dicarboxylic acid-based macrocycles for screening efforts. The value of the imidazole-4,5-dicarboxylic acid scaffold in drug discovery has been previously reported [30], as have other libraries for screening efforts that were built around this scaffold [31,32,33].",

Their features mimic those of known bioactive natural products, and we anticipate that such compounds would have reasonable pharmacokinetic properties. Thus, we reason the macrocycles will be valuable for screening efforts in a variety of bioassays and these results will be reported in time.",

These are monoprotected with benzyloxycarbonyl chloride by using an excess of the diamine to yield 2{1-2} following workup and purification as similarly reported [39]. However, this method worked poorly for 1{1} and resulted in significant amounts of diprotected diamine. An alternative synthesis was therefore used that employed N-Boc protection first [40] followed by benzyloxycarbonyl chloride protection to give the orthogonally protected diamine. Subsequent removal of the N-Boc protecting group with CF3CO2H in CH2Cl2 [31] yielded 2{1}. These intermediates were coupled to the Boc-amino acid building blocks, 3{1-4}, with EDC and DMAP in CH2Cl2 [29], providing chemset 4. Hydrogenolysis of chemset 4 in MeOH [31] yielded chemset 5 following workup. The pyrazine building blocks, 6{1-4}, were prepared as previously described [33], and reacted with chemset 5 in CH2Cl2 to yield acyclic chemset 7 following purification by column chromatography. The stoichiometry of the reaction between chemset 5 and chemset 6 is 2:1, respectively, and yields 2 equivalents of chemset 7. The tert-butyl ester and N-Boc protecting groups were removed by using CF3CO2H in CH2Cl2 [31]. The trifluoroacetate was exchanged for a chloride by adding dilute HCl, freezing the solution, and lyophilizing to give chemset 8. Macrocyclic ring closure to chemset 9 was affected by dissolving chemset 8 in CH2Cl2 and adding EDC with DMAP [31]. The final macrocycles were also purified by column chromatography and characterized by both LC-MS and 1H-NMR spectroscopy.",

A single reaction trying to form the macrocycle 9{1,1,2} with HBTU and Et3N in DMF was attempted [41], but no product was observed by LC-MS analysis. Indeed, no final product was identified for nine attempted macrocyclization reactions, and the starting material was not isolated for an additional four macrocycles, leaving 19 of 32 planned macrocycles being synthesized in the study. The yields to the chromatographically-pure macrocycles are given in Table 1. Importantly, we did not observe a clear trend relating stereochemistry or size of the side chain in preventing the formation of the macrocycle, so we reason it would be possible to expand this library in the future to include greater diversity in these areas. This result is nonetheless an important and critical first step in the goal of targeting screening libraries of these and closely related compounds, especially given the general challenge in the synthesis of macrocycles [28,29].",

This is not particularly surprising as glycine is quite flexible relative to the other natural amino acids. Yet, it was surprising to find considerable variability in both the \u03d5 (C4-N5-C6-C7; \u2212108.4 \u00b1 12.5\u00b0) and \u03a8 (N5-C6-C7-N8; 106.1 \u00b1 7.6\u00b0) torsion angles of the leucine, along with striking similarity in the torsion angles of the N,N\u2032-diethylethylenediamine linker. We would have expected the diamine torsion angles to be the observed site of differences more so than the amino acid residues. In hindsight, we reason this has some relation to the strong intramolecular 7-membered hydrogen bond [44,45], which is seen in each of the conformers of the asymmetric units across the crystal structures, although crystal packing influences cannot be ruled out. The observed NH\u2026O distances of this hydrogen bond across conformers A\u2013D in the X-ray crystal structures of both 9{2,4,1} and 9{2,4,3}, as well as for conformers A and B in 9{2,1,3} are provided in Table 5.

Interestingly, a majority of the torsion angles in the energy-minimized model deviate from the observed ranges seen across conformers A\u2013D of 9{2,4,1}, and only two torsion angles connecting the intramolecular hydrogen bond acceptor (C12=O) with the imidazole ring fall into the observed range. Yet, the parameters for the intramolecular hydrogen bond in the energy-minimized structure do not compare with the ranges of the four conformers (A\u2013D) in the crystal structure (Table 5). While the source of these differences is not clear at this time, the variability in the torsion angles is considered advantageous in the future screening applications of the macrocycle libraries. The thinking is that the macrocycle will provide overall preorganization of the scaffold, but retain enough torsion angle variability about the amino acid residues to help optimize the binding interactions of side chain pharmacophores at targets.",

To 20 mL of CH2Cl2 in a dry roundbottom flask was added dropwise over 1 h a solution of one intermediate, 7{1-32} (1 equiv.) in 20 mL of CH2Cl2 concurrent with the dropwise addition of a solution containing EDC.HCl (2.2 equiv.) and DMAP (0.2 equiv.) in 20 mL of CH2Cl2. The resulting solution was stirred for a period of time before removing the solvent under vacuum and purifying the macrocycle by column chromatography on silica gel. The chemset numbers for the final products and their associated names are provided in Table 6.",

            "text": "Macrocyclic peptides are useful tools in the drug discovery, owing in part to the conformational preorganization of their pharmacophores, reduced proteolytic degradation and metabolism, as well as increased bioavailability compared to acyclic peptides. Imidazole-4,5-dicarboxylic acid is a useful scaffold for drug discovery that is readily diversified with amines to yield imidazole-4,5-dicarboxamides. We now illustrate the ability of such derivatives to be further modified into 14-membered peptide-like macrocyclic rings. These final products are natural product-like and the synthesis accepts modifications in stereochemistry and amino acid side chains. The yields to the chromatographically pure final products are poor at this time, but efforts to optimize the macrocyclization and extend the types of substituents presented by the macrocyclic ring will be undertaken. The products may also be valuable in screening collections looking for hits against a wide variety of drug targets, and these efforts too will be reported on in due time.",
