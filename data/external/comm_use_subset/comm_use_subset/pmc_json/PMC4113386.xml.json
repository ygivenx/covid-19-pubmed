Isolation of antibacterial peptides from natural sources is inefficient and time-consuming. The biosynthesis of recombinant antimicrobial peptides in vivo is currently the most popular technique of preparing polypeptides. The Escherichia coli expression system is still the most commonly used because of its high level of expression, the relative simplicity of the DNA manipulations, and the short time required to produce product. Because of their natural destructive behavior toward microorganisms and relative sensitivity to proteolytic degradation, antimicrobial peptides are often produced by being fused to a fusion partner in heterologous hosts to neutralize their innate toxic activity and increase their expression levels [9].",

            "text": "Small ubiquitin-related modifer (SUMO) is an ubiquitin-related protein that functions by covalent attachment to other proteins. SUMO has 18% sequence identity with ubiquitin [29]. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has only a single SUMO gene (SMT3) that is essential for viability [30]. In contrast to yeast SMT3, three members of SUMO have been described in vertebrates: SUMO-1, SUMO-2, and SUMO-3. Human SUMO-1, a 101 amino acid polypeptide, shares 50% sequence identity with human SUMO-2/SUMO-3 [31], which are close homologues. It is known that SUMO, fused at the N-terminus with other proteins, can fold and protect the protein by its chaperoning properties, making it a useful tag for heterologous expression [12], [32]. All SUMO genes encode precursor proteins with a short C-terminal sequence that extends from the conserved C-terminal Gly\u2013Gly motif. SUMO proteases remove SUMO from proteins, by cleaving the C-termini of SUMO (-GGATY) in yeast to the mature form (-GG) or deconjugating it from lysine side chains [33], [34]. The former activity (protease) is useful for removal of SUMO as an expression tag. In this study, we expressed scorpine as SUMO fusions in E. coli to evaluate its anti-bacterial and anti-plasmodial activities. The SUMO fusion protein was successfully expressed in E. coli. The SUMO/scorpine fusion protein could be completely cleaved using SUMO protease, as shown in Fig. 2C. The Scorpine, which is about 8 kDa, was recovered with 95% purity using nickel affinity chromatography again.",

To further confirm the potential clinical values of Scorpine, we investigated effects of recombinant Scorpine on biofilm formation ability of bacteria, using the CV method [22]. As shown in Fig. 4, the recombinant Scorpine was able to inhibit the biofilm formation of bacteria. The biofilm formation as a bacterial survival strategy leads to increased resistance to heat, acid, preservatives, and antibiotics [35], [36]. Bacterial infections can mainly occur after consumption of contaminated foods. The ingested bacteria are exposed to acidic stress and bile salt under oxygen-limited conditions during transit through the stomach, the small intestine, and the colon. These stress conditions can influence antibiotic resistance patterns, biofilm-forming abilities, and virulence properties [37]. Moreover, antibiotic-resistant bacteria can possibly reside in biofilms and lead to enhanced tolerance to adverse environmental conditions, causing serious infectious diseases [38]\u2013[40]. Our data showed that the recombinant Scorpine was able to inhibit not only the growth of bacteria but aslo the biofilm formation of bacteria, suggest that the potential clinical use of Scorpine in the future.",
