            "text": "Controlled human malaria infections (CHMIs) have been used for nearly a century for treatment of neurosyphilis and for assessing interventions like drugs and vaccines for treating and preventing malaria. However, the modern era of CHMIs began in the mid 1980s, when laboratory reared Anopheles sp. mosquitoes were infected by feeding on cultures of Plasmodium falciparum-infected blood [1]. During the past three decades CHMI has been shown safe, well-tolerated and useful in evaluation of potential new anti-malarial drugs and vaccines [2]. After exposure to bites of laboratory-reared mosquitoes infected with P. falciparum sporozoites (PfSPZ) clinical symptoms and signs of malaria are generally mild to moderate and last for a few days. The most commonly reported symptoms are headache, fever, myalgia and fatigue, and common laboratory abnormalities include clinically insignificant thrombocytopaenia and leukopaenia [3,4]. Subjects, who undergo CHMI, are closely monitored and immediately treated with anti-malarials upon detection of parasitaemia. Due to frequent and intense clinical monitoring, initiation of treatment almost always occurs at parasite densities of less than 0.001% and often at 0.0001% [5], a density which is more than 1,000-fold lower than parasite densities associated with causing severe malaria.",

This immunization approach is called \u201cChemoProphylaxis with Sporozoites\u201d (CPS). Since CPS depends on inoculation of PfSPZ by mosquito bites, it cannot be an implementable vaccine. Recently, subjects were infected by needle and syringe inoculation of aseptic, purified, cryopreserved PfSPZ, a product called PfSPZ Challenge [8,9]. Subsequently, a clinical trial was initiated in which volunteers taking chloroquine chemoprophylaxis were injected intradermally (ID) at four-week interval with PfSPZ Challenge, an approach called the PfSPZ-CVac approach (=PfSPZ Chemoprophylaxis Vaccine), and then underwent CHMI.",

However, patchy midwall and subepicardial delayed enhancement was still present in four myocardial segments (i.e., the basal-inferolateral, mid-inferolateral, basal-inferior, and mid-inferior segments). Follow-up ECG did not show any abnormalities except for a minimally widened QRS complex compared to the pre-trial ECG and the persistence of incomplete right bundle branch block (see Additional file 4). In addition, ECG during a cardiac stress test did not show ST-T-segment changes, rhythm abnormalities, or other changes with respect to the pre-trial ECG. The cardiac stress test used a cycling protocol starting at 50 watt and with increasing steps of 20 watt per minute. He reached a maximally achieved power of 270 watt (i.e., 122% of expected for his age group and gender). He had an adequate increase in blood pressure and heart rate. His heart rate pressure product was 35,854 mmHg/min (normal is > 25,000 mmHg/min). Metoprolol 25 mg once daily was stopped and the volunteer has remained without complaints in good condition.",

The retrosternal chest pain [11], kinetics of increased troponin T plasma concentrations, ECG and echocardiogram findings, and MRI findings, which are consistent with the guidelines of the International Consensus Group on MR Diagnosis of Myocarditis [12], support the diagnosis of acute myocarditis. Moreover, improved myocardial function, disappearance of oedema and reduced delayed enhancement after almost five months correspond to the natural course of acute myocarditis; the residual delayed enhancement is consistent with contrast retention in fibrous tissue [13]. In addition, BNP and NT-proBNP were temporarily elevated and their elevation has also been found in patients with myocarditis and is associated with reduced left ventricular function [14,15].",

A few cases of malaria and concomitant myocarditis have been reported in the literature, albeit restricted to patients with severe or fatal infection with P. falciparum [16-22] and Plasmodium vivax malaria [23]. In literature, myocarditis has never been reported in patients with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria, even in those patients who present with P. falciparum parasite densities 20 to 30 times higher than the parasite density in this volunteer. In addition, troponin T plasma concentrations have never shown elevations above background in an unselected group of 167 volunteers when daily measured after CHMI using a highly sensitive assay (personal communication by RW Sauerwein (Radboud university medical center, The Netherlands)). Consistent with this finding, troponin T was very rarely (0.6%) elevated when assessed retrospectively in patients with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria [24]. In contrast, 31 \u2013 80.5% of African children with severe and/or fatal P. falciparum malaria exhibited high to very high levels of circulating cardiac proteins indicating myocardial injury and impaired left ventricular function [25].",

In the current volunteer, diagnostic tests for the most common infectious causes of myocarditis were negative (see Table 2 and 3). However, negative convalescent antibody titers do not exclude a post-infectious myocarditis. Furthermore, a throat swab, taken two days after the initial increase in troponin T contained rhinovirus, and rhinovirus has been occasionally associated with myocarditis [33,34].

In most such cases one would expect to find markers of inflammation elevated. However, markers for nonspecific inflammation and haemolysis, D-dimer, CRP, and LDH, were normal or only slightly elevated when the troponin T levels were highest (see Table 1). Nonetheless, it is possible that an overall hyperreactivity induced by the six standard vaccines (i.e., diphtheria, poliomyelitis, tetanus, parenteral typhoid fever, hepatitis A and hepatitis B) the volunteer received between the immunization period and CHMI, and the subsequent CHMI could have generated a hypersensitivity myocarditis. Such post-vaccination myocarditis has been rarely reported for the administered vaccines and usually manifests with fever and/or other nonspecific inflammatory symptoms within several days of the hyperimmunizations [37], which did not occur in this volunteer.

However, the volunteer denied excessive use of alcohol, and urine drug tests for cocaine, amphetamines and cannabinoids were negative, making such factors an unlikely explanation. Alcohol intake was not quantified during follow-up visits after CHMI, but volunteers were repetitively instructed to restrict alcohol intake. Since the urine drug test was performed five days after the first rise in troponin T, the detection of metabolites of cocaine and amphetamines after single use is quite limited at this time and could have been missed [40].",
