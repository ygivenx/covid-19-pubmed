The enteropathogenic coronavirus causes watery diarrhea, severe villous atrophy, high mortality in piglets, and severe morbidity in different stages of pig development. In the epidemic form, TGEV causes significant economic losses to the global pork industry1\u20134. In 1946, TGEV was first reported in the United States (US)5 and was later identified in Europe (Belgium6, England2, France7, Germany8, The Netherlands6, and Spain9), Asia (China10 and Japan11), Africa (South Africa4 and Uganda12), and South America (Brazil13). Recent TGEV epidemiological studies are lacking in the US while sporadic outbreaks have been reported from China14\u201316.",

The single segment genome is organized as 5\u2032UTR-ORF1a/1b-S-ORF3a-ORF3b-E-M-N-ORF7-3\u2032UTR3. The ORF1a/b can be divided into 15 ORFs, encoding non-structural proteins (NSP)1-10 and NSP12-16. The NSPs contribute to regulation of host translation and localization of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) during viral replication3. In coronavirus, NSP1 is a major factor associated with pathogenicity17. The NSP2, 3 and 8 of TGEV can incorporate into the viral articles18 while the NSP3 is also associated with protease and ADP-ribose 1\u201d-monophosphatase activities19. The functions of other NSPs of TGEV are unknown. The S glycoprotein attaches to the host cellular receptor porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) or sialic acid, induces cellular fusion, stimulates neutralizing antibodies, and has hemagglutination activity20\u201323. The pAPN-binding domain of the S protein has two major antigenic sites, A and B24. In addition, deletions in the ORF3 gene led to attenuation and reduced pathogenesis of TGEV and in vivo25.",

Compared to the S gene of TGEV strains, the S gene of PRCV has 621\u2013681 nt deletions at N-terminal, including in strains from Asia26 (UF-1 [n = 672 bp]), Europe7,27 (AR310 and LEPP [n = 621 bp] and RM4 [n = 672 bp]) and North America7,25,28 (OH7269 [n = 648 bp], IA1894 [n = 678 bp], and ISU-1 [n = 681 bp]). Thus, the S gene is used to differentiate PRCV from TGEV. Recently, a novel strain of PRCV (OH726928) was identified in the US, but the origin and evolutionary relationship to current TGEV strains in the US is unknown. While the decline of TGEV is believed to occur in response to partial immunity from PRCV infections29\u201332, the United States swine industry also made significant changes (increased biosecurity, 3 site production model, etc.) to raise healthier pigs, which may have contributed to the reduction of TGEV infections as well.",

However, a virulent TGEV or PRCV strain could emerge since the epidemiology of TGEV and PRCV is different in China. In 1992, PRCV was first reported in China46 and was not identified or reported in China afterwards while TGEV is constantly reported as a significant viral pathogen for the Chinese pig industry10,15,16. The different clinical status of TGEV in China and the western countries could be due to the stringent biosecurity measures in western countries compared to China. TGEV was consistently detected in the US between 2008 and 2016, but after the introduction of PEDV into the US, the swine industry significantly increased their biosecurity to prevent and control PEDV infections and the prevalence of PEDV were reduced after March 2014 in US39,47,48, which indirectly may have reduced the prevalence of TGEV to less than 0.1%.

In addition, the first TGEV genome from Mexico was characterized, which helps us to understand the evolutionary relationship of TGEV strains from different countries. Surprisingly, the Mex/148 strain is phylogenetically related to the traditional TGEV, and not the variant TGEV strain. Given the close geographical proximity of Mexico and US and that the Mexican and US PEDV strains are phylogenetically related51, the variant TGEV strains could be circulating in Mexico, but were not represented in our study since our study had only a single TGEV strain from Mexico. The circulation of TGEV and PEDV in the US indicates a chimeric virus could emerge in the US similar as the chimeric virus emerged in Europe. Characterizing of the current TGEV strains will aid in understanding the emergence of virulent or chimeric TGEV strains in the US, if such an event would occur in the future.",

The evolutionary relationship between the recently identified PRCV strain (Ohio-OH7269/2014) and our PRCV strain (Minnesota155/2016) was unclear given the limited number of globally available PRCV strains. Ideally, additional PRCV strains would have been sequenced, but routine screen of PRCV does not occur since PRCV is not considered as a significant pathogen in swine. The lab accidently isolated the PRCV strain, which was added to the study since the genetic and evolutionary relationship of PRCV is unknown in the US. The variant TGEV strains shared the same nucleotide mutations and amino acid deletions with the novel PRCV strain Ohio-OH7269/2014, and a recombination event between PRCV and TGEV was identified, illustrating the complex evolutionary relationship between TGEV and PRCV strains in the US. Hopefully, future US studies will assess the genetic and evolutionary of PRCV strains to fully elicit the complex relationship with TGEV.",

In this study, NGS technology generated the whole TGEV genome, revealing a total of 8 unique INDELs located in NSP3, S, ORF3a, ORF3b and M protein, and these regions, excluding the M protein, had high entropy levels in our study (Fig. 3A). The NSP3, S, ORF3a and ORF3b proteins of TGEV are associated with enteric tropism, immunogenicity, neutralization, sialic acid and other receptor binding activity ability, virulence, protease and ADP-ribose 1 \u2033-monophosphatase activities18\u201325, and changes in these proteins might reduce INDELs efficacy to cause clinical disease. Mutations in the spike gene in other coronaviruses has impact on initiation of membrane fusion54, sialic acid binding activity22, confer resistance to virus neutralization55, and render trypsin independent for cell entry and fusion56, which could be contribution to a reduction of the overall fitness of the INDELs. The attenuation of murine coronavirus in the natural host occurred due to deletion of the HE, 2a/HE, and 4/5a genes57, epidemics of feline infectious peritonitis were contributed to deletions in the ORF7a and ORF7b of feline coronavirus58,59, and disruption of functional expression of accessory protein occurred due to deletion of ORF8 in human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses60. Given the results from the previous studies, we hypothesis the INDELs are significantly attenuated compared to the traditional strains of TGEV. Further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis and investigate the effect of these deletions and mutations on the biological characteristics and fitness of the new TGEV genotype.",

Entropy values higher than 0.7 in the nucleotide and amino acid alignments were identified as high variation positions43. Recombination analysis was performed using Recombination Detection Program (RDP)66 v4 with RDP, BootScan, GEENECOV, SiScan and MAXCHI algorithms (Window size is 100 bp). Recombination event was represented using similarity plot, with Oklahoma147 as the query strain. The similarity plot was implemented in the SimPlot, v. 3.5.1 package67, using the two-parameter (Kimura) distance model with a sliding window of 1000 bp and step size of 30 bp.",
