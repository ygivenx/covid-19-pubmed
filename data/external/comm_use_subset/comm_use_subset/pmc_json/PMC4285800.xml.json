The analysis of microbial communities has been until recently a complicated if not untractable task due to their high diversity and to the fact that many of these organisms cannot be cultured. Harnessing the major advances achieved in sequencing technologies, metagenomics has emerged as the only currently available approach to extensively characterize these largely unculturable communities. Besides vastly enriching our knowledge of microbial diversity in a varied range of environments, and providing information on the dynamics and on the overall functioning of microbial communities, metagenomics is also shedding light on many important biological processes and, in particular, on the role of the microbiome in biological functions essential for the development of higher order organisms harboring it (Blotti\u00e8re et al., 2013; Manor et al., 2014), or in the development of pathological problems (C\u00e9nit et al., 2014; Vayssier-Taussat et al., 2014). In addition, metagenomic efforts also vastly enrich the repertoire of genes available for biotechnological applications (Ni and Tokuda, 2013).",

Consequently, the viral part of the microbiome has been shown in a number of situations to have a major impact on the dynamics and on the evolutionary processes of their host populations.

In virome studies the latter task is greatly facilitated when targeted sequencing of purified viral particles is performed (Hall et al., 2014), but the former is particularly difficult for complex samples containing both eukaryotic and viral sequences and when, as is very frequently the case, unknown viral species are present.

From the biodiversity point of view, the identification of unknown viruses representing novel higher order taxa (genera, families\u2026) is of clear interest as evidenced, for example, by the discovery of the Mimiviruses with genomes exceeding in size those of many bacterial genomes (Claverie et al., 2009).

Alignment-based methods suffer from two limitations: speed and lack of sensitivity (e.g., Bazinet and Cummings, 2012; Wood and Salzberg, 2014). Recently, novel solutions have been suggested to overcome these limitations. These methods are based on long k-mers (words of size k) and conceptually rely on the fact that when k is sufficiently large, k-mers become very specific. Consequently, the idea is to index the databases by long k-mers. This is indeed the foundation of MegaBlast (a general-purpose sequence aligner using long seeds), but also of a number of methods specific for taxonomic assignment such as LMAT (Ames et al., 2013) and Kraken (Wood and Salzberg, 2014). The downside of these approaches is over-specificity, which makes classification of unknown sequences problematic. This limitation can be particularly acute given the known very high intraspecific variability existing in some viral species or higher order taxa. For example, current criteria of the International Committee for the taxonomy of viruses tolerate up to 28% of nucleotide sequence divergence for the polymerase or capsid protein genes for isolates of a same species in the Betaflexiviridae family and a similar level of divergence at the whole genome level in the Potyviridae family (King et al., 2012).",

These methods theoretically are better suited to the task of novel species classification as short k-mers distributions are less prone to over-fitting. However, even these techniques fail to classify about 50% of species absent from the training set (Nalbantoglu et al., 2011).

            "text": "While this approach is feasible for bacterial populations, it is not applicable for the analysis of viral communities due to the absence of such marker genes (e.g., Edwards and Rohwer, 2005). Virome studies concentrate on the viral part of the environmental sample and isolate viral genomes encapsidated in viral particles that are purified by a combination of filtration and (utlra)centrifugation. This now popular approach drastically reduces the complexity of the community, which makes it possible to assemble longer contigs routinely (10 kb and more), and even complete genomes from low-complexity samples (Coetzee et al., 2010; Minot et al., 2012). However, it does not really solve the problem of first-level assignment but merely sidesteps it: given the purification step, all generated sequences are generally considered \u201cby definition\u201d as viral, unless proven otherwise by homology-based approaches. In addition, this strategy is not without some caveats (see for more details Fancello et al., 2012). For example, the purified particles may contain cellular genome fragments rather than viral genomes, because of the presence of GTA (Lang and Beatty, 2007) or as a consequence of generalized transduction (for a review see Frost et al., 2005). Also, while 0.22 \u03bc filtering avoids contamination by bacterial, archaeal or eukaryotic cells, other DNA-containing elements, such as bacterial vesicles (Biller et al., 2014) may co-purifiy with virions. Such filtering-based purification also excludes the largest viruses and therefore results in an incomplete picture of viral diversity. Moreover, both LA (see Duhaime et al., 2012) and MDA amplifications have their downfalls. For the former, adapter ligation is only possible for dsDNA viruses and hence ssDNA viral genomes are mostly absent in the sample. For the latter, the amplification is preferentially performed for circular ssDNA viruses rather than dsDNA. The effect of the presence of cellular genes on the bioinformatics analysis of viral metagenomic data has been described and some approaches to detect their presence have been proposed (Roux et al., 2014).",

Indeed, as mentioned by Suttle (2007) even for relatively long viral reads the homolog frequency between these reads and protein sequences within the Genbank database is only about 30%. The idea is to avoid the strong sequential constraint imposed by alignment methods on nucleotides' similarity and to capture a global similarity signal based on sequence composition (k-mers). Composition-based techniques seem to provide satisfactory results for fine-grained taxonomic classification of filtered viral samples (e.g., Yang et al., 2005; Trifonov and Rabadan, 2010).",

In supervised machine learning, the performance of a classifier is dependent both on the learning algorithm (e.g., SVM or Na\u00efve Bayes) and on the training data. While global metrics recapitulate overall performances of a classifier, they fail to indicate whether moderate performances are a consequence of wrong parameter adjustments, biased resampling for training data or of the intrinsic difficulty of the classification task. However, recent literature on instance misclassifications demonstrates that for a given classification task, some instances are intrinsically hard to classify and that their presence is indicative of the global difficulty (see Smith et al. (2014) for a review). Most studies agree on the hardness of outlier instances or on instances belonging to a minority class, but Smith demonstrated that simple metrics can actually quantify the intrinsic hardness of an instance. One of these metrics is the k-Disagreeing Neighbors (kDN), which measures for a given instance the number of k nearest neighbors that do not share its class label. Smith demonstrated that the kDN measure is strongly positively correlated with the misclassification of an instance over a wide range of learning algorithms and of training data resampling.",

For task (1), only bacterial genomes were considered, for task (2) only viral genomes were considered, while for task (3) a balanced composition of viruses, archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes were considered. Each sequence was represented as a 3-mer frequency vector (i.e., the number of time each possible 3-nt sub-sequence appears in the contig) and we defined the distance between two contig as the Euclidean distance between their respective 64 (43) dimensional vectors. For each contig, its kDN value is the number of other contigs that do not share its class label among its closest 73 neighbors. The corresponding class hardness is then measured as the median kDN of all the contigs in a given class. We also determined whether an observed median kDN is significantly extreme (low value indicating easy classification, high value corresponding to difficult classes), by estimating the distribution of the median kDN under the null hypothesis of no relation between class labels by random permutations.",

For viruses (panels B1 and B2), fine-grained classification to groups (ssDNA, dsRNA etc.) is hard, while assigning a viral sequence to a family level is easier, though less easy than for bacteria.

We investigated whether the classification difficulty could be explained by overlapping k-mer distributions between different types of hosts and viruses that infect them. To this end we sampled 4689 contigs from each first level cellular groups (archaeal, bacterial, plant and fungal genomes); and of viruses known to infect them. Using principal component analysis (PCA), we projected the 3-mers frequencies vectors of these contigs on 2 dimensions. Figure 2 shows that viral and cellular contigs are spread uniformly in these 2 dimensions, with the exception of plants viruses that are more compact. Using local density analysis, we observed that contigs of bacterial viruses indeed are close to their hosts (points 12 and 6, 13, and 7), but that they are also as close to archaeal contigs (points 13 and 3). On the other hand, archaeal viruses are not close to their hosts; while plant viruses are closer to bacteria and archaea than to their hosts.",
