This study investigated the potential antiviral function of TRIM52 against JEV infection. To test whether TRIM52 can influence JEV replication, we transfected BHK-21 and 293T cells with plasmids expressing HA-tagged TRIM52 or with an empty vector as control. The control and TRIM52\u2013overexpressing cells were both infected with JEV at an MOI of 1. The culture supernatants were harvested 24 hour post-infection (hpi), and the titers of the progeny virus were determined using plaque forming unit assay on BHK-21 cells. Figure 1a shows that TRIM52 overexpression reduced JEV titers both in BHK-21 (left panel) and 293T cells (right panel). Moreover, gene copies of JEV C gene and protein level of NS3 in infected cells were detected, demonstrating the antiviral activity of TRIM52 against JEV. As shown in Fig. 1b, the intracellular C gene levels of JEV were significantly reduced in TRIM52-overexpressing cells compared with that in the vector control cells. In addition, Western blot analysis indicated that the NS3 protein levels of JEV were significantly repressed in the presence of TRIM52. These results suggest that TRIM52 exerted antiviral activity against JEV replication both in BHK-21 and 293T cells.",

The results showed that GST-TRIM52 but not GST protein could capture NS2A (Fig. 2d,e). Moreover, we investigated the interaction between NS2A and RING domain-deleted TRIM52.

Li\u2019s group has reported that TRIM56 exhibits a broad antiviral activity against bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV)31, yellow fever virus (YFV), dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2), human coronavirus virus (HCoV)32, and influenza A and B viruses33. These TRIM proteins are among the host antiviral restriction factors. They directly target viral proteins to restrict virus replication. In addition, many members of the TRIM family proteins positively regulate host innate immunity response to develop host defense34. Ubiquitinated TRIM26 promotes TBK1 to interact with NEMO, resulting in the expression of type I IFNs15. Upon infection with viral DNA or RNA, TRIM9 short isoform undergoes Lys-63-linked auto-polyubiquitination and recruits GSK3\u03b2 to TBK1, resulting in the activation of the IRF3 signaling pathway14.",

TRIM79\u03b1 (also known as TRIM30D or TRIM30-3) presents only in rodent, which was the first reported and identified as an INF-induced TRIM protein that serviced as a flaviviurs restriction factor35. TRIM79\u03b1 directly targeted NS5 from Langat virus (LGTV) and Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) for degradation through lysosomes pathway to restrict virus replication. However, TRIM79\u03b1 did not target NS5 from West Nile virus (WNV), nor could it inhibit WNV replication. What\u2019s more, TRIM79\u03b1 is an essential mediator for IFN response specific to TBEV infection. TRIM56 is a virus- and IFN-inducible host antiviral factor. Liu and colleagues firstly demonstrated that human TRIM56 exhibited direct antiviral activity against YFV and DENV by targeting intracellular viral RNA replication32. Although the detail antiviral mechanisms of TRIM56 restricting YFV and DENV remaining unknown. The E3 ligase activity and integrity of the C-terminus of TRIM56 is essential for its antiviral activity against YFV and DENV. In addition, TRIM21 has been demonstrated that it as a negative regulator of IFN\u03b2 production mediated by IRF3 during JEV infection in human microglial cells (CHME3)36. Thus, JEV could exploit TRIM21 to attenuate host antiviral innate immune response during the early stage of infection.",

Moreover, TRIM52 mediated the ubiquitination of JEV NS2A to be degraded via the proteasome-dependent pathway. As shown in Fig. 4b, the protein level of NS2A was repressed in the presence of TRIM52 along with DMSO treatment. Addition of proteasome inhibitor MG132 obviously restored NS2A protein level. Moreover, the results in Fig. 3 indicate that the RING domain of TRIM52 was essential for its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. The RING domain-deleted TRIM52 mutant lost its capacity to degrade NS2A proteins (Fig. 4c), resulting in truncation did not restrict JEV replication (Fig. 6). In summary, our data demonstrated that TRIM52 exerted antiviral activity against JEV replication by targeting the viral NS2A protein.",
