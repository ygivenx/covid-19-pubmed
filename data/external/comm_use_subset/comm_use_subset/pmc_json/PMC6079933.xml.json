It results from a foreign body type of inflammatory reaction due to the presence of lipid material in the lung parenchyma initiating cellular and humoral defence mechanisms 3, 4. Populations at risk include the elderly, children, and those with an underlying swallowing dysfunction or neurological disorder resulting in an unprotected airway. In addition, forced ingestion in the recumbent position in infants and young children who actively refuse oil may result in gagging and aspiration of the oil 5. Common ailments for which oil has been used medically or culturally include constipation, colic, and nasal stuffiness 6.",

Common symptoms at presentation of these infants included: tachypnoea (11/12), hypoxia (9/12), fever (4/12), hyperinflation (2/12), and digital clubbing (2/12). Six of 12 children were hospitalized for pneumonia on at least one other occasion besides the episode in which the diagnostic BAL that was conducted provided histocytological evidence of ELP. Underlying risk factors that were documented included gastro\u2010oesophageal reflux (GOR) confirmed on scintigraphy (3/6), in combination with silent aspiration confirmed on contrast swallow (2/4). Ten of the 11 mothers interviewed confirmed the administration of oil to their children. In five patients, this history was obtained after reviewing BAL findings. Oil administration emerged to be a nearly universal cultural practice by Zimbabweans, even in the Cape Town diaspora. (Table 1).",
