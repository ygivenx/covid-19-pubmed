            "text": "An estimate from the transmission model by Zhang et al. [4] revealed a higher reproductive number for MERS outbreaks in South Korea than other small outbreaks, which was mainly related to healthcare-associated settings. According to Choi [5], approximately 80% of the total MERS patients in South Korea were infected in healthcare facilities by four super-spreaders, who infected more than five individuals each [6]. This indicates the importance of the isolation and treatment of super-spreaders using prompt epidemiologic investigations for the prevention of large-scale infections. Park et al. [6] and Kim et al. [7] analyzed the epidemiologic characteristics of 36 secondary and tertiary patients infected by the initial super-spreader patient at Pyeongtaek St. Mary\u2019s Hospital, and suggested the necessity of additional investigations into the cases of infected patients, for whom close contact was not confirmed as the infection route. Cho et al. [8] examined the infection route by conducting epidemiologic investigations on super-spreaders and secondary infected patients who infected 82 people in an emergency room at the Samsung Medical Center. It was found that several infected patients were not in direct contact with the super-spreaders, and the infection was not caused by a contaminated environment, given that no patient or medical staff was infected after the isolation of the super-spreaders. Nam et al. [9] and Park et al. [10] conducted epidemiologic investigations on the clinical symptoms and medical environment of other super-spreaders and infected patients who spread secondary infections in the Daejeon area, and identified close contact as the main infection route. The study by Wong et al. [11], who compared the super-spreaders of MERS, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and Ebola, revealed that super-spreaders play a significant role in large-scale infection cases. It is important to identify and prevent any possible infection route of such super-spreaders, regardless of its relative probability.",

However, given that close contact does not explain the spread of infection, as suggested by the previously mentioned epidemiologic studies, infections via other routes, such as fomites and air, were suspected [13,14]. In the case of SARS, which spread from Hong Kong and China and resulted in the infection of 8096 patients worldwide in 2003 [15], close contact was identified as one of the infection routes, and the possibility of infection through the air was suggested in several studies [16]. Li et al. [17], Yu et al. [18], and Qian et al. [19] suggested the possibility of infection through the air for secondary infected patients, for whom close contact could not be established as the infection route. In addition, the importance of ventilation in the control of infections indoors was emphasized using epidemiologic investigations and numerical analyses in the Prince of Wales hospital, in which the initial infected patient was known to have infected 125 secondary patients. Previous studies in South Korea were mainly focused on the identification of the infection route via close contact, based on the epidemiologic characteristics of group infections caused by the initial MERS patient. However, it is necessary to examine all possible infection routes with respect to super-spreaders, as with the SARS CoV.",

In each of the adjacent rooms (8103 and 8105), one patient and one caregiver were infected. In two 7-patient rooms (rooms 8107 and 8108) along the same corridor, three patients and two caregivers were infected. Recently, Song et al. [21] conducted a seroepidemiologic investigation and confirmed that one patient in room 8102 was also infected, without the display of symptoms. In addition to the adjacent rooms, nine patients and seven caregivers were infected in room 8109, which is 15 m from room 8104, in addition to the rooms across the corridor (rooms 8110\u20138113). This could be explained by the conjecture that the range of the MERS infection, which is known to spread through droplets, is within 2 m. Although contact by the movement of the infected patients was also suspected, there were many secondary infected patients, for whom contact due to the movement of the initial patient was not confirmed. The initial patient did not walk around the rooms of the other patients, and only used the elevator for transport to medical examinations, in addition to walking outside. Close contact with other patients in the elevator or in the hospital was also limited, according to the interview with the patient and the review of the closed-circuit television footage. It was therefore necessary to examine the possible infection routes through fomites or air. Nevertheless, no infected patients were reported in the maternity ward with single-patient rooms, which is located in the south.",

All other rooms exhibited a concentration increase according to that of room 8104; however, the degree and time of the increase varied, depending on the room. First, the concentration increased in adjacent rooms 8106 and 8103, and room 8110, approximately 8 min after the gas generation. In particular, the concentration increased significantly to 1.59 ppm (3.2% of the average concentration of room 8104) in room 8110 approximately 18 min after the SF6 gas generation, and maintained the highest concentration (average of 2.09 ppm and maximum of 3.74 ppm) among the rooms, with the exception of room 8104, until the SF6 gas generation was stopped. In contrast, the concentration increased to 0.56 ppm in adjacent room 8103, and decreased after the door was closed, thus reaching an average value of 0.18 ppm. In room 8106, the concentration was relatively low, similar to that of room 8103; however, it increased to 2.07 ppm, and maintained an average value of 1.63 ppm until the SF6 gas generation was stopped. In room 8113, which is opposite room 8104 but farther to the south, the concentration increased approximately 15 min after the SF6 gas generation, which was somewhat delayed when compared with those of the other rooms. Moreover, it reached 1.67 ppm, decreased, and then maintained an average value of 0.63 ppm. After the door was closed, the concentration of room 8104 increased by approximately 20%. However, the concentrations of the other rooms did not decrease until the SF6 gas generation was stopped. The airflow through the undercut of the sliding door, which was also verified by the subsequent smoke test, was assumed to maintain the dispersion of the tracer gas to the other patient rooms. In room 8218, which is a single-patient room in the maternity ward to the south of room 8104 where no MERS patient was admitted, the concentration increased to 0.12 ppm after the initial SF6 gas generation, and maintained the lowest concentration with an average value of 0.048 ppm. After the gas generation was stopped, there was a rapid decrease in the concentration in room 8104, in addition to that in room 8106.

The airflow could be attributed to the presence of strong westerly winds when the tracer-gas experiment and smoke test were conducted, given that wind was introduced to room 8104 through the open window and flowed out toward the corridor, as shown in Figure 4. During the tracer gas experiment, the air change rate estimated using the average concentration of 49.5 ppm and the emission rate of SF6 before closing the door during was approximately 20 ACH. A large amount of outside air was introduced by strong westerly winds through the relatively small window of the room at approximately 17 ACH, even after the door was closed. The air change rate estimated by stopping the generation of the tracer gas and using the attenuating concentration was also high, at approximately 15 ACH. When the air change rate is high, the concentration of pollutants can be diluted and dispersed indoors through the corridor if they are not discharged outside through ventilation ducts. Therefore, the causes of the dispersion of the tracer gas from room 8104 to the other rooms through the corridor, along with the introduced wind, could be estimated using the results of the tracer-gas experiment. In addition, the gas from room 8104 did not disperse to room 8218, given that the outdoor airflow in the west\u2013southwest direction was introduced to the maternity ward through the windows.",

This is because droplets containing viable MERS-CoV could be transferred over large distances in certain environments such as healthcare facilities, where large amounts of droplets could be released during coughing or medical treatments, and transferred over distances significantly larger than 1\u20132 m by airflow. The propagation distance and time of droplets or droplet nuclei in the air may increase, depending on the indoor environment [23,24], which may be affected by mechanical or natural ventilation. Bin et al. [25] and Kim et al. [26] performed the environmental sampling of negative-pressure isolation rooms, in which MERS-confirmed patients were hospitalized. Moreover, MERS-CoV was detected in the ventilation ducts in the ceiling. The detection of MERS-CoV in the air-conditioner filter in the ceiling of the room opposite room 8104, among the unpublished environmental sampling results of the hospital, also indicates that the droplets or droplet nuclei from patients can travel over large distances in certain environments. Though investigations were conducted, the operation status of the ventilation system and air conditioner installed in the room of the hospital during the stay of the initial patient could not be clearly determined. The control devices of the ventilation system and air-conditioner were in the room, and the patient had access to them. However, the cooling or heating system was not operated, given that the average temperature of Pyeongtaek was 17.8 \u00b0C (10.3\u201326.4 \u00b0C) from 15 to 17 May when the initial patient was hospitalized, according to the epidemiological investigation. Moreover, it was not clear whether the ventilation system was operated during the outbreak. Furthermore, room 8104 did not have a ventilation system, due to a construction flaw. Apart from the ventilation system, each room had a small project window for natural ventilation, which could be opened or closed by the occupants of the room. The window was opened for ventilation, given that the outside air was mild, with the exception of the night time. It is necessary to examine the effects of the introduction of the outside air through the window, and the effect of the indoor airflow formed by the outside air on the dispersion of droplets or droplet nuclei in room 8104.",

In particular, on May 16, the average wind speed was 2.15 m/s, the maximum wind speed was 10.9 m/s, and the wind was mostly in the west\u2013southwest wind direction. Therefore, it is possible that airborne particles from room 8104 were introduced to the corridor by the outside air entering through the window when the window and room door were open. This is similar to the external airflow observed when the tracer experiment was conducted using SF6 gas. The tracer experiment also confirmed that pollutants from room 8014 were dispersed into adjacent rooms and rooms on the opposite side. Some of the tracer gas was assumed to flow into adjacent rooms 8103 and 8106, in addition to the dominant dispersal into the patient rooms on the opposite side, due to changes in the wind direction and speed, and the inflow of exhaust air to the affiliated toilets of adjacent rooms during the experiment. Previous experiments and the results of the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis conducted in SARS cases also confirmed the possibility of long-distance dispersion due to indoor airflow [17,18,19,27]. In addition, it is also possible that a high concentration of airborne particles, including the MERS virus, accumulated in room 8104, which does not have a ventilation system, given that its window and door were closed at night. Thereafter, the particles may have been discharged in large amounts by the opening of the window and door in the morning.",

However, at sites different to controlled laboratories, it is difficult to derive reproducible results due to the interference from high-concentration airborne particles already present in indoor and outside air. Although the SF6 gas used in the tracer-gas experiment is seldom detected in normal environments, and therefore not subject to interference, it exhibits an aerodynamic dispersion behavior different from that of particles, as it contains gas molecules smaller than particles. In previous studies on SARS [17,27], airflow indoors and outdoors was analyzed using passive contaminant to identify the dispersion of SARS virus based on the assumption that the droplets exhaled from the infected patient are evaporated very quickly and get smaller enough to flow like airflow. For the same reason, SF6 gas is widely used for the dispersion of pollution substances such as gas and airborne particles, or for airflow examinations, as it can be used to simulate airflow [31,32]. Besides, we tried to conduct the tracer experiment in the same condition with the initial outbreak period at the hospital. However, the patients, medical staff and their movements could not be simulated because the hospital was evacuated and they were isolated in other facilities. Moreover, the hospital was still under risk of contamination. The movements and heat generation from the occupants could accelerate the dispersion of air and particles from the initial patient room.",
