China accounted for 17% of the global burden of mental, neurological and substance use disorders in 2013 and this is predicted to increase by 10% by 2025 [2]. The latest nationwide epidemiological survey in China reported that the 12-month prevalence of any mental disorder (excluding dementia) among the Chinese population was 9.3% and the prevalence of anxiety, depression and alcohol use disorders in this population all appear to be increasing [3]. Moreover, mental disorders increase the risk of suicide [4, 5] and China has one of the highest suicide rates in the world [6].",

For example, a community-based survey among the general population in a north-western city of China (Xi\u2019an) found that less than one quarter of individuals with a mental disorder diagnosis had sought mental health services in their lifetime [8, 9]. Structural barriers related to mental health service use include a scarcity of available human and financial resources and disparity in their distribution [10]. Individual factors include widespread stigmatising attitudes, poor recognition of mental disorders, low perceived need for treatment and limited knowledge of available services [8, 11]. These individual factors can be summarised by the concept of \u2018mental health literacy (MHL)\u2019, which has been defined by Jorm et al. as \u201cknowledge and beliefs about mental disorders that aid in recognition, management, or prevention\u201d [12].",

Early surveys in Australia [12] and other high-income countries [13, 14] typically reported relatively low levels of MHL in members of the public, leading to a wide range of interventions and campaigns to improve MHL [15, 16]. Evidence from these interventions has shown that improvements in MHL assisted in promoting early detection of mental disorders, reductions in stigmatising attitudes and enhanced help-seeking behaviours [17, 18].",

However, some components of MHL, predominantly related to attitudes and knowledge, have been studied in China for many years [27]. For example, a variety of research activities on stigmatising attitudes towards mental illness had been conducted among the Chinese population [11, 28]. Examples of culturally specific beliefs about the causes of mental health problems in traditional Chinese culture include viewing mental illness as a punishment for the misconduct of family members and/or their ancestors, or beliefs that mental disorder are inflicted by a supreme being [29]. To further explore and counter these beliefs and to disseminate scientific knowledge, a number of studies focusing on knowledge about mental health problems have been conducted in China [22, 23, 30].",

Initial thematic analysis used the framework outlined by Jorm et al. [12], which was then modified according to the new themes that emerged. As the MHL domains vary among different types of participants, MHL domains were firstly analysed according to the type of participant (i.e. lay people, professionals and patients/carers), followed by three broad categories of MHL (i.e. knowledge, beliefs and behaviours/skills), and then more detailed subthemes.",

However, there are differences in their geographic distribution, with most studies focusing on urban areas (n = 251, 71.7%) (see Fig. 2c) and provinces in the east or south of China (see Fig. 3). Such geographic differences may be related to the uneven distribution of mental health service resources, which are clustered in and around big cities in economically booming areas in China [19]. The lack of locally available mental health service networks and mental health resources make it challenging to conduct MHL-related research in rural, remote or other less-developed regions. On the other hand, due to relatively low levels of education and the strong influence of traditional culture, people in these regions are more likely to have poorer MHL [48], longer delays in receiving treatment, and more premature death related to mental disorders [49]. Therefore, more high-quality MHL research in rural and less-developed regions in China is needed, and could be considered a matter of priority for the Central and local governments of China to achieve the aspirational goal of knowledge awareness rates set by its National Mental Health Plan [20].",

In countries such as Australia where there has been a substantial increase in MHL research over the past 10 years, there has been a major focus on common mental disorders, most notably depression [17, 18]. Given the importance of early help-seeking, self-help and social support in reducing the burden of disease related to depression, this may also be a useful strategy for public education in China. The increasing prevalence of depression [50] and more mass media reports of depression cases or suicide cases related to depression among celebrities may also contribute to the greater awareness of depression among the population [51]. Psychosis has long been a priority in mental health management in China, partly due to its relatively greater burden on individuals and families, as well as its perceived influence on the safety and stability of the whole society [10]. The relatively high number of studies focusing on suicide is likely to be explained by concern about the suicide rate in China, which is among the highest in the world. In comparison, anxiety disorders have been the focus of relatively little MHL research (n = 29), although these disorders are reported to be the second most prevalent category of mental disorders in China [9] (with the first being mood disorders). The limited number of studies on substance use, bipolar disorder, mania or OCD and the gap in trauma/PTSD studies highlight the need for a wider range of mental disorders to be covered in the field of MHL research.",

However, this review suggests that current MHL interventions in China have paid relatively little attention to members of the public but have focused mainly on patients/their carers or non-mental health professionals. While there is a need to further support carers of people with severe mental illness, it is also necessary to improve MHL in members of the Chinese public to enable them to better assist those with mental health problems in their social networks. This is in line with the aims of the World Health Organisation and the Chinese government to improve mental health of the whole population [20, 52].",

For example, a relatively large number of studies targeted university students, which might be explained by a policy focus on mental health in educational institutions and the fact that universities are a relatively convenient setting in which to target young people (the age at which many mental health problems have their first onset). This lays a foundation for developing interventions to assist members of the public to help others with mental health problems in the community. As the Chinese mental health system faces considerable challenges due to the increasing numbers of people seeking help for mental disorders [3, 9] and the severe shortage of mental health professionals [48], such interventions could play a role in building capacity in non-mental health professionals and empower community members to work together to improve population mental health [7].",
