However, these in vitro assays alone are not enough to demonstrate that the identified cells are in fact CICs. Therefore, certain in vivo assays, such as limiting dilution transplantation experiments in animal models, are used to verify the results of in vitro assays [7, 8]. Unfortunately, studies have yielded conflicting identification of CICs in different types of cancer [2, 9]. The discrepancies in CICs identification may be due to the fact that the studied cells derived from different cancer cell lines or well-developed tumors [9, 10]. The phenotypic and functional heterogeneity of clinical tumor samples may exacerbate the difficulty in identifying CICs [10, 11].",

In the K-rasG12D mutation conditional mice model, the stem cells located at the bronchioalveolar duct junction were examined as potential origin for adenocarcinoma after Cre/lox mediated activation [14]. Another study has demonstrated that Oct-4, mediated by IGF-IR signaling, can form a complex with \u03b2-catenin and Sox-2 to play a crucial role in the self-renewal and oncogenic potential of CICs in lung adenocarcinomas [15]. Additionally, co-expressing Oct-4 and Nanog in A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell line can control epithelial-mesenchymal transdifferentiation, regulate tumor initiating ability, and promote metastasis behavior [16]. Moreover, a high level of Oct-4 in non-small cell lung cancer patients has been correlated with metastasis and a lower survival rate [17]. Although these studies have demonstrated that certain pluripotent genes, Oct-4, Sox-2 and Nanog, are closely associated with tumor initiating properties, the connection between aberrant pluripotent genes expression and the generation of CICs is unclear and requires further clarification.",

In previous studies, we enriched for mouse pulmonary stem/progenitor cells (mPSCs) by using serum-free primary selection culture followed by FACS isolation using the coxsackievirus/adenovirus receptor (CAR) as the positive selection marker in the culture. These CAR+/mPSCs exhibited stem/progenitor properties, could differentiate into type-I pneumocytes, and possessed angiogenic potential [18, 19]. We hypothesized that CAR+/mPSCs could be transformed via the overexpression of Oct-4 and would then develop the typical CICs phenotype and we tested type-I pneumocytes derived from CAR+/mPSCs as well. In the experiments described here, we examined the characteristics of the transformed cells using in vitro assays, including cell cycle and telomerase activity analysis, sphere forming assay, detection of CD133 expression and ALDH activity, and chemoresistance assay. In addition, in vivo assays, including limiting dilution transplantation and tumor metastasis assays in SCID mice, were used to further study the characteristics of the transformed cells. Since the capacity to induce angiogenesis is another trait of CICs, endothelial tube formation assay and in ovo chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay were used to evaluate the angiogenic potential of the transformed cells. Our results help elucidate a possible origin and pathway for the generation of CICs, and help uncover how CICs may regulate blood vessel formation.",

CAR+/mPSCs showed the potential to differentiate into type-I pneumocytes at day 7, evidenced by their flattened cellular morphology and by the presence of the type-I pneumocyte markers, T1\u03b1 and AQP5 (Supplementary Figure 1D).

At day 28, the well-developed colonies exhibited phase-bright borders, and cells within the colonies had high nuclear/cytoplasmic ratios and prominent nucleoli (Figure 1A-iv). The colonies were then picked and expanded to generate cell clones (Figure 1A-v). The frequency of cobblestone-like colony formation in CAR+/mPSCs ranged from 0.05-0.13% (Figure 1B). Meanwhile, no cobblestone-like colonies were observed in the sham control transfection in CAR+/mPSCs (data not shown). Retroviral transfection of CAR+/mPSCs-derived type-I pneumocytes was performed at day 8 when type-I pneumocytes were well-differentiation (Supplementary Figure 2-i, 2-ii and 2-iii), and feeder cells were supplied at day 10 (Supplementary Figure 2-iv). Oct-4 transfected type-I pneumocytes had no detectable colony formation until day 42 after induction. These results indicate that overexpression of Oct-4 can induce cobblestone-like colony formation in CAR+/mPSCs; and that cell status, stem/progenitor stage rather than differentiated stage, appear to be critical for the induction of colonies via Oct-4 overexpression.",

To evaluate phenotypic alterations, cell clones from 3 independent experiments, named C1, E9, and C7, were selected for further examinations. Western blot analysis showed that Oct-4 was highly expressed in the C1, E9, and C7 clones; thus, we referred to them as CAR+/mPSCsOct-4_hi clones (Supplementary Figure 3-i). The Oct-4 expression levels of C1, E9, and C7 clones were similar to that of the mouse embryonic stem cell line (E14), whereas CAR+/mPSCs exhibited low Oct-4 expression (Supplementary Figure 3-ii). In primary cultures, CAR was specifically expressed in pulmonary stem/progenitor cells and served as the marker for CAR+/mPSCs isolation. In CAR+/mPSCsOct-4_hi clones, CAR was expressed in > 95% of cells and these cells had lost the capacity to differentiate into type-I pneumocytes (data not shown). Cell cycle analysis showed significant G1-, S- and G2/M-phase shifting between CAR+/mPSCs and CAR+/mPSCsOct-4_hi clones (Figure 2A). Additionally, the C1, E9, and C7 clones could propagate for more than 50 passages, with a doubling time of 23\u00b11 h. While telomerase activity was detected in the 12th, 20th and 50th passages of the C1, E9, and C7 clones, it was not detected in CAR+/mPSCs (Figure 2B). These results demonstrate that Oct-4 hyperexpression in CAR+/mPSCs was sufficient to produce immortal effects, such as G1 cell cycle progression, proliferation potential, and telomerase activity.",

Moreover, the tumors exhibited typical malignant phenotypic characteristics, such as a high cellular density; small, round immature cell proliferation; pleomorphic cells with a high nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio; and a high mitotic ratio (Supplementary Figure 4A). Using immunohistochemical staining, Oct-4 and CAR were detected in tumors (Supplementary Figure 4B).

Tumor formation potencies were 6/6, 5/6, and 5/6 in 105, 104, and 103 cell concentrations of C1 clone injections, respectively. In addition, a low cell concentration of C1 clone (102) was sufficient for tumor formation (4/6) at an average of 28 d after injection (Figure 4A-i). Tumor size and morphology are shown in Figure 4A-ii. In contrast, no tumor formation was observed in transplants using CAR+/mPSCs (106 cells) despite 56 d incubation (data not shown). In order to examine metastatic potential, 3 \u00d7 105 cells of the C1 clone were transplanted through the tail vein of mice and allowed to develop for 35 d. All mice injected with the C1 clone developed tumor nodules in the lung tissue (Figure 4B). H&E staining of lung tissue revealed extensive hemorrhage and nodule formation in the C1 clone transplants, while no abnormal lesions were detected after CAR+/mPSCs transplantation. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to determine the survival rate following C1 clone or CAR+/mPSCs transplantation. The mean survival of mice injected with the C1 clone was significantly lower than that of mice transplanted with CAR+/mPSCs (Figure 4C).

We utilized these biomarkers to further investigate CICs characteristics in CAR+/mPSCsOct-4_hi clones. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that about 17.4-31.7% of cells were CD133+ among the C1, E9, and C7 clones, whereas CD133+ cells were nearly undetectable in CAR+/mPSCs (Figure 5A). ALDH activity was detected in 18.4-33.2% of the C1, E9, and C7 clones, whereas only 0.8% of CAR+/mPSCs exhibited ALDH activity (Figure 5B). As chemoresistance is also a critical biological feature of CICs, we evaluated the C1, E9, and C7 clones for chemoresistance to cisplatin or paclitaxel treatment. The cell viability is shown in Figure 5C. The IC50 values of cisplatin were 26.4-34.7 \u03bcM for C1, E9, and C7 clones, indicating that CAR+/mPSCsOct-4_hi clones were about 2-3 fold more resistant to cisplatin compared to the A549 cells. For paclitaxel, the IC50 were 43.2-47.2 nM in the C1, E9, and C7 clones, which are approximately 6 fold higher than that of the A549 cells (Figure 5C-iii). It has been well documented that the protein survivin inhibits apoptosis and plays an important role in conferring chemoresistance to CICs [20]. We found that survivin expression was significantly higher in the C1, E9, and C7 clones compared to CAR+/mPSCs (Figure 5D-i). The C1, E9, and C7 clones also exhibited lower levels of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-9 under cisplatin or paclitaxel treatment compared with CAR+/mPSCs (Figure 5D-ii). Taken together, our results suggest that Oct-4 hyperexpression can drive the transformation of CAR+/mPSCs, conferring them with CICs-like properties.",

Therefore, we wanted to evaluate the potential for angiogenesis in the CAR+/mPSCsOct-4_hi clones. We performed real-time PCR analysis and found that proangiogenic factors, including angiopoietin 1 (ANG1), angiopoietin 2 (ANG2), VEGFa, placental growth factor (PLGF), platelet-derived growth factor A (PDGFa), GCSF, VCAM-1, and bFGF, were expressed at significantly higher levels in the C1, E9, and C7 clones compared with CAR+/mPSCs (Figure 6A). To further confirm angiogenic potential, we used the C1, E9, and C7 clones and CAR+/mPSCs in a CAM assay. When implanted on CAM, the C1, E9, and C7 clones induced extensive blood vessel formation compared with CAR+/mPSCs implants (Supplementary Figure 5A-i). Branch point quantification revealed that implanting the C1, E9, and C7 clones significantly increased blood vessel branching compared with that of CAR+/mPSCs (Supplementary Figure 5A-ii). Immunohistochemical analysis and quantification of the C1, E9, and C7 clone-derived tumors revealed a significantly higher CD31-positive population than that found in A549 derived tumors (Supplementary Figure 5B-i and 5B-ii).

C1 clone-derived spheres labeled with the green fluorescent tracer, calcein-AM, were mixed with SVEC4-10 cells that had been labeled with the red fluorescent tracer, PKH26, and then were co-cultured for tube formation. C1 clone-derived spheres recruited SVEC4-10 cells and established tube network (Figure 6B). Time-lapse and 3D architecture videos using confocal microscopy are shown in Supplementary Movie-1 and -2. Some C1 clone cells were observed to integrate into the SVEC4-10 cells tube network (Figure 6C). A 3D architecture video of tube formation is shown in Supplementary Movie-3. We then cultured the C1, E9, and C7 clones in an endothelial cell growth medium (EGM; Lonza) for 7 d to examine tube formation ability; CAR+/mPSCs were also cultured as a control. EGM cultured C1, E9, and C7 clones exhibited tube formation ability, whereas no such capability was observed with CAR+/mPSCs cultured in EGM (Supplementary Figure 6-i and 6-ii). These results indicate that CAR+/mPSCsOct-4_hi clones not only possess angiogenic potential, but are also involved in tube formation in vitro. To evaluate tumor blood vessel formation potential in vivo, the C1 clone was transfected with GFP expression (C1-GFP clone) and then used to form tumors via subcutaneous implantation in SCID mice. Using immunofluorescence staining, the endothelial antigens, including CD31, vWF, and CD105, were detected in C1-GFP clone-derived tumors. Some blood vessels incompletely expressed the endothelial antigens, and GFP+ cells were directly integrated into blood vessels, exhibiting a mosaic-like pattern. Moreover, some endothelial cells simultaneously expressed endothelial antigens and were GFP-positive (Figure 6D). To confirm the presence of GFP+-endothelial cells, we examined dissociated tumors using flow cytometry. Similar to the results of immunofluorescence staining, 12-18% of the CD31+ population was also positive for GFP (Figure 6E). In order to examine the correlation between CAR+/mPSCsOct-4_hi clones and endothelial cells, we used real-time PCR to analyze gene expression of the angiogenesis associated receptors, VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and Tie2. The receptor, Tie2, which is specifically expressed in endothelial cells, was significantly elevated in EGM cultured C1, E9, and C7 clones compared with CAR+/mPSCs, while gene expression of VEGFR2 showed no significant difference (Figure 7A). Western blot analysis confirmed the involvement of the ANGs/Tie2/GRB2/ERK signaling pathway, showing that ANG1, ANG2, phospho-Tie2, GRB2, and phospho-ERK expression were significantly increased in EGM cultured C1, E9, and C7 clones relative to CAR+/mPSCs (Figure 7B). These data suggest that CAR+/mPSCsOct-4_hi actively participate in tumor angiogenesis, rather than playing a passive role as CAR+/mPSCs do.",

            "text": "Oct-4 is one of the most important transcription factors of embryonic stem cells and is also one of the four Yamanaka factors known to induce pluripotency when overexpressed in somatic cells [21]. In a study by Kim and colleagues, Oct-4 alone was sufficient to induce pluripotency in adult neural stem cells [22]. This result indicates that Oct-4 plays a critical role in maintaining cell pluripotency. However, Chiou et al. demonstrated that co-expressing Oct-4 and Nanog in A549 induced tumor initiating ability and promoted metastasis behavior of lung adenocarcinoma [16]. Beltran et al. indicated that overexpression of Oct-4 in different primary human epithelial breast cell preparations generated cell lines possessing tumor initiating and colonization capabilities, but the origin of these cells was not clearly identified [23]. Furthermore, Hochedlinger et al. reported that ectopic Oct-4 expression caused intestinal epithelial dysplasia. The dysplastic lesions showed expansion of progenitor cells and required continuous Oct-4 expression [24]. Despite these associations, the precise role of Oct-4 in cell transformation remains unclear. In our study, we found that CAR+/mPSCs express low levels of Oct-4, and overexpressing Oct-4 could transform CAR+/mPSCs such that they formed cobblestone-like colonies. In contrast, no colonies were observed when Oct-4 was also overexpressed in well-differentiated type-I pneumocytes derived from CAR+/mPSCs. Thus, compared with the study for the results of Oct-4 overexpression in adult neural stem cells [22], we speculated that the formation of cobblestone-like colonies via Oct-4 overexpression is dependent on cell types and differentiation status.",

We also found that telomerase activity and had continuous expression in the CAR+/mPSCsOct-4_hi clones. Telomerase activity is considered to confer cell cycle progression and immortal growth properties [11]. Taken together, our results demonstrated that CAR+/mPSCsOct-4_hi clones exhibited a general phenotype of immortalized cell properties and may maintain the pluripotency. To evaluate the pluripotency of the clones, an in vivo teratoma formation assay, the standard tool for monitoring pluripotency, was employed [22]. Histological analysis of tissues derived from CAR+/mPSCsOct-4_hi clones showed no differentiation of the three germ layers. H&E staining of the tissues indicated malignant phenotypic characteristics, and immunohistological examination revealed heterogeneous phenotypes. Expression of oncogenes including phospho-Src, phospho-\u03b2-catenin, c-myc, and cyclin D1 were also detected in the tumor-like tissues, as were diagnostic markers for lung adenocarcinoma, such as TTF1, NAPSA, CK7, and CK-HMW [25, 26]. This result indicated that CAR+/mPSCsOct-4_hi clones induced tumor formation and derived heterogeneous tumor cell populations rather than teratoma formation.",

            "text": "CICs are defined by their self-renewal and pluripotency capacities, which contribute to cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, recurrence, and chemoresistance [2]. Assays that measure anchorage-independent growth and sphere formation ability are generally used to evaluate the self-renewal and differentiation capacities of CICs [4, 7]. Our results show that CAR+/mPSCsOct-4_hi clones possessed higher capacities for colony formation in soft agar and for sphere formation compared with the A549 cells. To demonstrate that CAR+/mPSCsOct-4_hi clones share certain traits with CICs, in vivo assays, which are regarded as the gold standard, should be performed, including limiting dilution transplantation experiments in animal models [7, 8]. Here, we used the C1 clone to demonstrate that at low concentrations (1 \u00d7 102 cells), transplanted cells could generate tumors at a frequency of 4/6 within 28 d. This tumorigenicity is greater than that reported for side population of A549 cells, which at a concentration of 1 \u00d7 103, gave rise to tumors at a frequency of 2/4 within 60 d [3]. Thus, CAR+/mPSCsOct-4_hi showed remarkable tumor initiating potential. In addition, these cells displayed the ability for metastasis and malignancy. All mice injected with the C1 clone developed tumor nodules in the lung tissue, and histopathological staining of lung tissue revealed extensive hemorrhage. In addition to the in vitro and in vivo assays, other analytic protocols used for CICs identification in lung cancer, including CD133 expression, ALDH activity, and chemoresistance assays, were used to verify the characteristics of the clones [7]. Although the mechanism underlying transformation by Oct-4 hyperexpression remains elusive, our results show that Oct-4 hyperexpression can directly transform CAR+/mPSCs with CICs-like properties as well as CD133 expression, higher ALDH activity, and cisplatin and paclitaxel resistance. Additionally, in our study, CAR+/mPSCsOct-4_hi also exhibited marked survivin expression and down regulated caspase-3 and -9 expression. It has been reported that survivin functions as a key regulator of mitosis and apoptosis inhibition and acts as an inhibitor of caspase-9 [20]. Li et al. reported that Oct-4 positively regulates survivin expression to promote cancer cell proliferation in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [27]. We speculate that the promotion of cell proliferation and attenuated apoptosis may be critical to Oct-4 hyperexpression induced transformation and may be mediated via survivin.",

            "text": "It is well known that the growth, proliferation, and metastasis of cancer cells are highly dependent on angiogenesis and anti-angiogenic therapy is considered a promising strategy for cancer treatment [11]. The VEGF signaling pathway is the target of three major anti-angiogenic drugs approved for clinical use [28]. However, recent studies have revealed that some endothelial cells derived from tumor cells are resistant to anti-VEGF therapy [29\u201331]. Recent studies have reported that CICs may be a crucial source for key proangiogenic factors in cancers, exhibiting potent angiogenic capacities in glioma and ovarian cancers [32, 33]. In addition, Soda et al. demonstrated that the tumor initiating cells of glioblastomas presented the transdifferentiation potential for generation of tumor-derived vascular endothelial cells through hypoxia stimulation [29]. In our previous study, CAR+/mPSCs were demonstrated to express proangiogenic factors, such as VEGF and bFGF, and induced tube formation of endothelial cells both in vitro and in vivo [19]. In this study, we found that CAR+/mPSCsOct-4_hi clones expressed more abundant proangiogenic factors and induced angiogenesis in both the tube formation and the CAM assays. Surprisingly, we found that CAR+/mPSCsOct-4_hi clones actively participated in tube formation, creating a mosaic-like pattern, in which the C1 clone cells integrated into the tube network of SVEC4-10 cells. In an early report, Chang and colleagues showed that both endothelial cells and tumor cells formed the luminal surface to presence of \u201cmosaic\u201d vessels [34]. Tomaso et al. demonstrated that there was mosaic structure for endothelium of vessels in human colon carcinoma xenografts in mice [35]. In animal model studies, C1 clone derived GFP expressing cells could also participate in forming the tumor blood vessels in C1-GFP clone derived tumors. Flow cytometry analysis of C1-GFP clone derived tumors revealed that 12-18% of CD31+ endothelial cells also expressed GFP, indicating that a population of CD31+ cells was derived from the C1-GFP clone. Collectively, the results indicated that CAR+/mPSCsOct-4_hi exhibited remarkable angiogenic potentials and actively participated in tumor angiogenesis. In order to speculate the mechanism for CAR+/mPSCsOct-4_hi clones to participate in angiogenesis, our study found that CAR+/mPSCsOct-4_hi effectively switched on a novel angiogenic mechanism, the ANGs/Tie2 signaling pathway. ANGs are the ligand for endothelium-specific receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2 [36]. In cancer research, ANGs/Tie2 signaling plays critical roles in vascular development and maturation, which are crucial for tumor angiogenesis [36]. The underlying mechanism of ANGs/Tie2 activation in CAR+/mPSCsOct-4_hi clones warrants further exploration. The tumor vasculature derived from cancer cells may be regulated differently than regular vasculature, offering potential new therapeutic targets.",

In this study, we demonstrated that Oct-4 hyperexpression is sufficient for CAR+/mPSCs to gain the hallmarks of cancer cells and acquisition of CICs-like properties. CAR+/mPSCsOct-4_hi clones may be valuable cell models for further studies on the properties of CICs. Moreover, the easy manipulation of CAR+/mPSCsOct-4_hi clones may enable large-scale cultures for the development of new therapeutic approaches targeting CICs. Although Oct-4 hyperexpression induced transformation of CAR+/mPSCs has been well documented, the identification of naturally occurring environmental factors that can induce Oct-4 expression warrants additional research. Recent studies have reported that a hypoxic microenvironment induced Oct-4 expression through HIF2\u03b1 activation and deregulation [37]. Notably, CAR+/mPSCsOct-4_hi actively participated in tumor angiogenesis and activated the ANGs/Tie2 signaling pathway. These findings provide novel insight regarding the origin of CICs and offer new strategies for anti-angiogenic therapy in lung cancer.",
