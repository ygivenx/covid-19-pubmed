While reliable estimates of the reproduction number and the death risk associated with COVID-19 are crucially needed to guide public health policy, another key epidemiological parameter that could inform the intensity and range of social distancing strategies to combat COVID-19 is the asymptomatic proportion, which is broadly defined as the proportion of asymptomatic infections among all the infections of the disease. Indeed, the asymptomatic proportion is a useful quantity to gauge the true burden of the disease and better interpret estimates of the transmission potential. This proportion varies widely across infectious diseases, ranging from 8% for measles and 32% for norovirus infections up to 90\u201395% for polio [5-7]. Most importantly, for measles and norovirus infections, it is well established that asymptomatic individuals are frequently able to transmit the virus to others [8,9]. Currently, there is no clear evidence that COVID-19 asymptomatic persons can transmit SARS-CoV-2, but there is accumulating evidence indicating that a substantial fraction of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals are asymptomatic [10-12].",

If asymptomatic cases were missed as a result of this, it would mean we have underestimated the asymptomatic proportion. Second, it is worth noting that the passengers and crew whose data were employed in our analysis do not constitute a random sample from the general population. Considering that most of the passengers were 60 years and older, the nature of the age distribution may lead to underestimation if older individuals tend to experience more symptoms. An age standardised asymptomatic proportion would be more appropriate in that case. Third, the presence of symptoms in cases with COVID-19 may correlate with other factors unrelated to age including prior health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and/or immunosuppression. Therefore, more detailed data documenting the baseline health of the individuals including the presence of underlying diseases or comorbidities would be useful to remove the bias in estimates of the asymptomatic proportion.",
