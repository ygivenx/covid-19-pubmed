PEDV was identified as the causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) in 1978 [1]. This disease is characterized by severe diarrhea, vomiting and dehydration. PEDV infections can occur in pigs of any age, but infections are most serious in piglets, with morbidity and mortality often reaching 100% [2]. At the end of 2010, a PEDV outbreak occurred in several pig-producing provinces in southern China. Since then, the disease has spread throughout other provinces of China and has resulted in enormous economic losses within the pork industry [3]. Thus far, PEDV infection has been reported in swine-farming countries in Asia, Europe, and North America [4\u201311].",

In December 2013, an S-INDEL strain, OH851, with reduced virulence was reported in the USA. Strain OH851 showed the same insertions and deletions in the spike gene (called S-INDEL) as the classical CV777 strain when compared with highly virulent US prototype strains [12, 13]. Yamamoto et al., (2015) reported one PEDV S-INDEL strain with a low pathogenicity in Japan [14]. While Stadler et al., (2015) reported that the S-INDEL strains, similar to the OH851 strain, were identified in southern Germany [15]. Boniotti et al., (2016) reported a new swine enteric coronavirus generated by recombination of PEDV and swine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) [9]. At present, both S-INDEL and non S-INDEL strains co-circulate in the USA, China, and Japan [14, 16]. The accumulating data have revealed the genetic diversity and complex change tendencies of PEDV strains circulating in a global context.",

As a result of the high sequence variation in the S1 gene, the more conserved ORF3 gene is widely used for diagnosis of PEDV infection. While the more variable S1 gene has been widely applied to studies of PEDV genetic diversity and evolution. Although researchers have continued to do epidemiological monitoring of PEDV infections in China, there is fairly limited information available on currently circulating PEDV viruses in 2015. In this study, molecular epidemiological investigation of PEDV was carried out in seven regions of China in 2015. We used the ORF3 and S1 genes to analyze the genetic evolution of the identified PEDV strains. Our aim was to provide insights into the genetic evolution of PEDV strains circulating in China in 2015.",

The intestinal tissues samples of the dead animals were collected by veterinarians of each farm, and were stored at \u221220\u00b0C. The diseased piglets exhibited the clinical manifestations of acute diarrhea and vomiting. The antibiotic therapy was not effective for the diseased animals. The 41 farms covered seven administrative districts of China including the Northeastern, Northern, Northwestern, Southwestern, Central, Eastern and Southern regions. Farms were selected as PEDV-positive using the colloidal gold immunochromatographic rapid test strip for PEDV (BioNote, Inc., Republic of Korea) or using RT-PCR. The PEDV infection status of all 165 intestinal samples was further confirmed using the conventional RT-PCR method which targets the ORF3 gene [19]. Briefly, 1 g of intestinal tissue was placed in 5 ml of PBS (pH 7.4), ground up and clarified. The viral RNA was then extracted from the supernatant of each sample using the TIANamp Virus RNA Kit (Tiangen Biotech Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The viral cDNA was synthesized by using Moloney murine leukemia virus (RNase H-) reverse transcriptase (Novoprotein Scientific Inc., Shanghai, China) in conjunction with six random nucleotide primers according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The PCR amplification of the ORF3 gene was carried out according to the protocol described by Kim et al., (2015) [19]. One positive sample from each farm was selected for sequencing of the ORF3 gene. All nucleotide sequences generated in our study were submitted to GenBank. Sequence analysis was performed using the EditSeq tool in Lasergene DNASTAR\u2122 5.06 software (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI, USA). Multiple sequence alignments were performed using the Multiple Sequence Alignment tool of DNAMAN 6.0 software (Lynnon BioSoft, Point-Claire, Quebec, Canada).",

This region was chosen based on the alignment of published PEDV genome sequences obtained from the NCBI GenBank database. The alignment revealed a 2396 bp fragment (partial nsp13 gene +S1 gene) covering the S1 gene. The primer positioning was determined according to the complete genome sequence of PEDV strain CV777 (GenBank accession no. AF353511). PCR amplification was undertaken in 50 \u03bcL reaction volumes containing 0.1 \u03bcM of forward primer, 0.1 \u03bcM of reverse primer, 4 \u03bcL of cDNA (synthesized as described previously), 5 \u03bcL of 10 \u00d7 buffer, 0.5 U of ExTaq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa), and an appropriate volume of ddH2O. PCR products were amplified using the following cycle conditions: 30 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 1 min, 51\u00b0C for 1 min, and 72\u00b0C for 3 min, with a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. The reaction was carried out by using an automated GeneAmp PCR System 9700 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems). The purified PCR products were subjected to Sanger sequencing, and all nucleotide sequences generated in our study were submitted to GenBank. A total of 29 S1 genes, corresponding to the previously sequenced ORF3 genes, were obtained. The epitopes of these 29 S1 genes were analyzed using SS2 (Y748SNIGVCK755) SS6 (L764QDGQVKI771) as described by Sun et al., (2008) [20]. These 29 S1 genes were compared with the PEDV S-INDEL reference strains, and assigned as S-INDEL or non-INDEL strains [16]. The amino acid substitutions in the pAPN receptor-binding region (aa 490\u2013615) of PEDV S1 protein were analyzed and compared to the reference strains [17]. Finally, recombination analysis of the 29 identified S1 genes was carried out using the RDP4 software with parameters similar to those described by Geng et al., (2015) [21, 22].",

After sequencing of the ORF3 and S1 genes, the molecular characterization of the identified PEDV strains was analyzed. Sequence analysis of both the ORF3 and S1 genes revealed that the PEDV strains identified in our study exhibited high similarity to the Chinese PEDV variant reference strains when compared with the CV777 prototype strain or early Chinese PEDV strains. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these identified PEDV strains have different genetic lineages, but that all of the strains have a close relationship with other non-INDEL strains, and are distinct from the \u201cCV777\u201d and \u201cUS\u201d S-INDEL strains. Previous reports showed that the PEDV S-INDEL strain had a lower pathogenicity than the North American prototype strain [13, 14]. In our study, the identified PEDV strains and selected Chinese PEDV reference strains were divided into three strain types: (1) \u201cCV777\u201d S-INDELs (early Chinese PEDV strains), (2) \u201cUS\u201d S-INDEL (Chinese PEDV field strains), and (3) non S-INDEL (Chinese PEDV field strains) strains. These groupings were similar to those observed for Japanese PEDV strains. This result demonstrates that the PEDV strains from China and Japan are more genetically diverse than those from North American countries. In our study, these PEDV reference strains belonging to the \u201cUS\u201d S-INDEL subgroup showed a close relationship to the PEDV strains that fall within the global non S-INDEL subgroup, and differed genetically from the PEDV strains belonging to the \u201cCV777\u201d S-INDEL subgroup. The differences in the pathogenicity among the \u201cCV777\u201d S-INDEL subgroup, the \u201cUS\u201d S-INDEL subgroup, and the global non S-INDEL subgroup are an interesting topic and require further studies. Additionally, co-circulation of S-INDEL and non S-INDEL strains should be investigated in an effort to better understand the genetic and pathogenic variability of global PEDV strains.",

All the PEDV strains identified in our study were genetically distinct from the \u201cUS\u201d S-INDEL subgroup which includes OH851, and instead clustered with the highly virulent non S-INDELs subgroup which contains the USA/Colorado/2013 strain. This clustering suggests that those PEDV strains identified in our study should possess high pathogenic potential. However, Chinese highly virulent strains (CHYJ130330 and YN15), Chinese variant attenuated strain (YN144), and Chinese variant strain with reduced virulence (FL2013) were also found in the same subgroup [24\u201326]. This data implies that the pathogenicity of these Chinese PEDV strains and the type strain of the non S-INDEL subgroup can diverge in pathogenic potential, which means that phylogenetic clustering is not sufficient on its own to predict virus pathogenicity, which would make this an ideal topic for future research. Meanwhile, sequence analysis of ORF3 and S1 genes may not be sufficient to fully reveal the genotype of pathogenic PEDV strains.",

In our study, the SS2 epitope (Y748SNIGVCK755) was found to be highly conserved in the 29 identified PEDV strains, which is in line with previous studies [7, 28, 29]; while the SS6 epitope (S764QSGQVKI771) exhibited amino acids substitutions, all of which have been reported in other studies [7, 28, 29]. The C-terminal domain (CTD) of the S1 domain is bound to porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) [27], and when the pAPN receptor-binding region of the 29 identified S1 genes was evaluated, we identified 7 different amino acid substitutions when compared with the PEDV CV777 strain. Amino acids substitutions within the SS6 epitope and pAPN receptor-binding region are presumed to be responsible for pathogenic changes of PEDV [21, 30]. Recently, the PEDV variant strains with large deletions in the S gene have been reported in South Korea and Japan [31, 32]. Similar mutant strains have not yet been reported in the pig population of China. In our study, the HLJ2015/DP1-1 strain contains a novel twelve nucleotide deletion (A1130CAACTCCACTG1141) within the S1 gene when compared with the CV777 strain, other non S-INDEL strains, and S-INDEL strains. The 12 nucleotide deletion within the S1 gene was further confirmed as unique when a global survey of PEDV strains was undertaken using the nucleotide BLAST tool from the NCBI. The S1 gene of the strain HLJ2015/DP1-1 was identified in a vaccinated population suffering from long-term diarrhea caused by a single PEDV infection (data not shown). This unique deletion of the S gene was relatively rare in the global non S-INDEL strains, and may result from long-term immune pressure.",

            "text": "Since the outbreak of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the recombination and variation of the coronavirus, especially as it concerns the cross species transmission of the coronavirus, has become a hot research topic [33]. In all of these coronaviruses, the S protein initiates infection by mediating receptor-recognition and membrane fusion and plays a key role in tracing the evolution of coronaviruses. In the past, phylogenetic analysis and identification of nucleotide or amino acid substitutions within the S gene were widely used for evaluating the genetic evolution of PEDV. There were little quantitative measures for evaluating PEDV variation. In our study, the divergences were identified by comparison of specific target sequences within the S gene between the selected Chinese PEDV field strains and the prototype CV777 strain. Using this approach, we were able to show that the selected Chinese PEDV field strains between 2011 and 2015 show a significant increase in diversity when compared to early Chinese PEDV strains, which is in line with previous reports about PEDV variants [4]. The amount of genetic divergence within the selected Chinese PEDV strains showed a downward trend from 2013 to 2015, which may be associated with recent effective control strategies for PEDV in China. Recombination plays a pivotal role in the evolution of coronaviruses, it allows the emergence of new strains with altered virulence, and potentially broader host ranges [9]. In our study, six out of a possible nine recombination events occurred between the 29 identified non S-INDEL strains. The remaining three recombination events occurred between the 29 identified non S-INDEL strains and three early Chinese S-INDEL strains. Recently, the recombination between PEDV and TGEV has generated a new swine enteric coronavirus which has been reported in pig population in Italy [9], confirming the potential for increased or altered virulence in PEDV as a result of recombination. The limited data presented here demonstrates that there is a potential for recombination and that this can occur between both related and unrelated coronaviruses.",
