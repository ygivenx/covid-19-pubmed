It is responsible for chikungunya fever (CHIKF), a disease characterized by the presence of incapacitating arthralgia3. CHIKV is transmitted by arthropod vectors, such as the Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, with the latter being implicated in the transmission of CHIKV during the 2005\u20132006 Indian Ocean outbreak and in Europe4. For the past decade, re-emergence of CHIKV has led to numerous outbreaks in different parts of the world: Asia5\u201312, Europe4,13,14 and islands in the Indian Ocean15,16. Outbreaks of CHIKV infections have also been reported in the Caribbean islands17,18 and CHIKV has since successfully invaded North, Central and South America19.",

This is a paradoxical phenomenon of antibodies forming complexes by binding to viruses, which then interact with cell surface receptors and promote entry into susceptible host cells, subsequently increasing virus replication21,22. This was observed for rabies virus23, influenza virus24, dengue virus (DENV)25,26, Ross River virus (RRV)27, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)28 and Marburg virus29. Among alphaviruses, although virus enhancement was documented only in RRV infections27,30\u201332, most of these studies were conducted using in vitro murine cell line-based systems27,31,32. The development of a suitable infection system with primary human cells and an in vivo model allows the study of antibody enhancement in clinically important viruses, such as the recently emerged Zika virus (ZIKV), which infection is enhanced with cross-reactive anti-DENV antibodies33.",

At low antibody concentration, antibody-mediated enhancement was shown to occur at antibody concentrations of 3.6 \u00b1 2.9 \u03bcg/ml (Table 1). The presence of CHIKV antigen was detected by flow cytometry, where detection was increased by ~5 fold in monocytes (Fig. 1a) and by ~20 fold in B cells (Fig. 1b). However, active virus replication was not observed (Fig. 1c,d) in both cell types. Next, a Zs-Green tagged CHIKV variant was used for the infection of human whole blood. With this virus, a successful infection would lead to the production of the Zs-Green protein. Levels of infection can therefore be known through the detection of Zs-Green positive cells. It was observed that infection in the presence of patients\u2019 plasma (total IgG concentrations of 1.8 \u00b1 1.45 \u00b5g/ml) led to an increase in the numbers of Zs-Green positive monocytes. However, this was not observed in the B cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) (Fig. S1a). Once again, the viral RNA load did not concur with enhanced infection (Fig. S1b).",

Despite the increased level of Zs-green positive cells, viral RNA load remained unchanged (Fig. 3c and S2b).

Disease progression was monitored daily for viremia and degree of joint inflammation at the footpad. Mice infected under enhancing conditions had significantly higher viral RNA load during the acute phase of the disease (Fig. 5a) and endured a more pronounced inflammation at the infected joint footpad (Fig. 5b). Tissue immune-phenotyping (Fig. S4) further revealed higher levels of infiltration of neutrophils and possibly CD4+ T cells into the joint footpad at 6 days post-infection (dpi) during enhanced CHIKV infection (Fig. 5c). Moreover, a much lower number of CD4+ T cells and monocytes were present in the popliteal lymph node (pLN) draining the right footpad (Fig. 5d), indicating the possible egress of these cells from the pLN into the circulation or infected tissues during enhanced infection. Gene expression studies also revealed higher levels of IFN\u03b3 as well as IL-10 in the inflamed footpad during enhanced infection. This was coupled with a lower expression of \u03b2-defensin 14 (DEF14) (Fig. 5e).",

Utilizing this model, 3 weeks old IFN\u03b1R+/\u2212 mice were infected with 106 PFU CHIKV via the joint footpad to assess the outcome of antibody-mediated enhancement. While a similar degree of joint footpad inflammation (Fig. 6a) was observed in IFN\u03b1R+/\u2212 mice as compared to WT mice, higher viremia was detected in the IFN\u03b1R+/\u2212 animals (Fig. 6b). However, when CHIKV infection was performed in the presence of diluted CHIKV-specific mice sera at a concentration of ~2 \u03bcg/ml total IgG, increased viremia (Fig. 6a) and more pronounced joint footpad inflammation (Fig. 6b) was observed in the IFN\u03b1R+/\u2212 mice. These observations reinforce the significance of sub-neutralizing concentrations of CHIKV-specific antibodies in enhancing CHIKV infection and aggravating disease pathology.",

To assess if these antibodies could exacerbate CHIKV disease severity at sub-neutralizing concentrations, different concentrations of CHIKVIGs were administered intra-peritoneally to CHIKV-infected 11 days old C57BL/6 WT mice at the ventral thorax40 (Fig. 7). Mortality was observed in mice receiving CHIKVIGs at concentrations of 1\u2013100 \u00b5g/kg (Fig. 7a), whereas mice receiving either 1000 \u00b5g/kg or 0.1 \u00b5g/kg of CHIKVIGs survived the infection. Unexpectedly, approximately 30% of mice receiving a control non-CHIKV-specific polyvalent IgG also died from infection (Fig. 7a). Nevertheless, viral RNA load in serum, liver and muscles was determined in CHIKV-infected mice receiving 10 \u00b5g/kg of CHIKVIGs. It was observed that enhanced CHIKV infection led to a more significant viral burden in the muscles at 3 dpi (Fig. 7b), but not at 6 dpi (Fig. 7c). Taken together, these findings highlight that enhanced CHIKV infection is detrimental in young animals.",

            "text": "This study provides the first documentation of antibody-mediated enhancement in CHIKV infection in vitro and in relevant in vivo mouse models. Despite the increased detection of CHIKV antigen in primary human monocytes, B cells and MDMs when infection was performed in the presence of sub-neutralizing levels of CHIKV-specific antibodies, viral replication was not increased. Antibody-mediated enhancement in viral infections has been reported to mostly involve Fc\u03b3Rs22. The involvement of Fc\u03b3Rs in enhancing CHIKV infection may lead to two outcomes: the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways (Fig. 8). In the extrinsic pathway, virus attachment and possibly entry is facilitated without much significance to viral replication and manipulation of host immune responses22,50. Results obtained with infection in the whole blood, primary human monocytes, B cells and MDMs supported that the extrinsic pathway is at play. The increase detection of Zs-Green signal in MDMs during the later time points is suggestive of viral entry and initiation of viral replication, as the Zs-Green is cloned under a duplicated sub-genomic promoter42,51. However, no further increase in both Zs-Green signal and viral RNA load may suggest that enhanced CHIKV infection do not necessary augments viral replication. This quick shutdown of viral replication may actually indicate a putative mechanism employed by CHIKV for chronic persistence. While it is known that CHIKV could persist chronically using macrophages as possible cellular reservoirs38,39, its exact mechanism is not known. As such, the restricted replication observed in monocytes and MDMs could be a form of immune subversion by the virus to achieve chronic persistency52.",

Intriguingly, enhanced CHIKV infection in murine RAW264.7 macrophages was even more prominent when the virus started replicating (6 hpi). Subsequently, this led to the high expression of several pro-inflammatory and anti-viral genes. This observation is enthralling as similar studies in DENV and RRV reported the down-regulation of these pro-inflammatory responses31,32,53\u201356. While the data in this report differs, it opens up another compelling perspective in which enhanced CHIKV infection in susceptible cells can lead to augmented virus entry and replication, resulting in an active pro-inflammatory response from the infected cells (Fig. 8). While the consequences of the elevated immune response remains to be investigate, it is plausible that CHIKV manipulates this immune outcome to its own advantage to achieve chronicity, as observed for other viral infections57.",

The exact mechanisms of this phenomenon remains to be fully elucidated. However as presented in this study, the disruption of host immune response could be a crucial driving force behind the augmented disease severity. This brings caution to the phenomenon that sub-neutralizing concentrations of virus-specific antibodies can enhance severity of infection and advocates the need for careful vaccine design and extensive pre-clinical trials. In fact, it was reported that CHIKV severity was increased in vaccinated mice that presented sub-optimal immune responses65. Unfortunately, it was also observed that a proportion of mice receiving the na\u00efve human polyvalent antibodies succumbed to CHIKV infection. This was definitely an unexpected observation and could be due to the presence of unknown artifacts present in the control antibodies that resulted in this outcome. These na\u00efve polyvalent antibodies had previously been shown not to exhibit any immuno-reactivity against CHIKV49.",

For whole blood and human MDMs, CHIKV infection was directly quantified by the detection of Zs-Green signal under the FITC channel. For detection of CHIKV antigen in RAW264.7 cells, staining was performed with rabbit anti-CHIKV nsP2 antibodies followed by secondary staining with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated Goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) (Invitrogen). For primary human cells, an additional staining step was performed. Surface markers Pacific-Blue-conjugated mouse anti-human CD45, Qdot-605-conjugated mouse anti-human CD19, PerCP Cy5.5 mouse anti-human CD14 and PE-Cy7-conjugated mouse anti-human BDCA2 (all antibodies were from eBiosciences) were stained following manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Human monocytes, B cells and pDCs are defined by the specific surface expression of CD14, CD19 and BDCA2 respectively. Data was acquired using either BD FACS Calibur or BD FACS Canto II (BD Biosciences). Softwares used include BD CellQuest Pro software (for FACSCalibur) and BD FACSDiva software (for FACSCanto II) (BD Biosciences). Gating strategy is shown in Fig. S5. A total of 30,000\u201350,000 cells were acquired and results were analyzed with FlowJo (version 10) (Tree Star).",

Virus-antibody complexes are formed when antibodies are present in sub-neutralizing concentrations and are taken up by cells expressing Fc\u03b3Rs via either extrinsic or intrinsic pathways. Extrinsic pathways result in increased virus attachment and possibly entry with no visible benefits to virus replication. Whereas in intrinsic pathways, it can lead to enhanced anti-inflammatory or enhanced pro-inflammatory infection. Enhanced anti-inflammatory infection downplays the inflammatory response associated with normal infection and instead upregulates the anti-inflammatory response leading to heightened infection and viral replication. In enhanced pro-inflammatory infection, it leads to an increased in active infection, without negative suppression of pro-inflammatory immune response.",
