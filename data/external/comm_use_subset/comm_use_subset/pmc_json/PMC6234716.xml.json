Influenza virus and RSV are spread by droplet and contact transmission. Therefore, nosocomial acquisition may occur due to exposure to another infected patient, visitor or healthcare workers (HCWs), as well as by contact with contaminated, inanimate surfaces. Immunocompromised patients with underlying hemato-oncological disorders or cancer are at risk for increased mortality, especially in the case of lower respiratory tract infection due to these viruses [5], [6], [7]. Both community and nosocomial acquisition of influenza and RSV are possible in this patient group. Nosocomial outbreaks in oncologic care facilities have been described [8], [9] in spite of multiple infection control measures to prevent nosocomial transmission. These measures include stringent hand hygiene, patient isolation, and use of barrier precautions such as surgical masks or vaccination (influenza) [5], [10], [11], [12]. ",

During the winter season, acquisition of these viruses typically occurs in the community, and patients may be admitted with symptoms of infection or infection to a hospital. Nosocomial acquisition due to transmission occurs as well [15], [16], [17], [18]. Recommendations and suggestions for controlling the spread of influenza and RSV in healthcare settings in general and especially in hemato-oncological patients exist (e.g. [5], [10]), but should be adapted to each hospital\u2019s specific needs. To extend our existing standard infection control measures, we introduced a prophylactic screening program for asymptomatic patients targeting RSV and influenza on an adult and a pediatric hemato-oncological ward. The screening was intended to detect patients that shed the virus without having signs or symptoms of disease. Shedding my occur before the onset of disease (incubation period), during an asymptomatic clinical course, or following disease as a result of prolonged viral shedding, particularly in the immunocompromised host [19]. These groups of asymptomatic patients, who often remain unnoticed, can contribute to nosocomial spread. Of the 23 asymptomatic shedders, we detected an increased viral load in 6 patients in follow-up specimens (see Table 2 (Tab. 2)). It is likely that these patients were in the incubation period. This group of patients is of particular interest for infection control strategies, since with increasing viral load, the risk of transmission also rises. ",

Other studies found a similar prevalence in asymptomatic individuals for influenza (8.3%) and RSV (4.4%) using RT-PCR [20], [21]. Campbell et al. examined samples from asymptomatic and symptomatic patients prior to hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) in a study to evaluate the clinical outcomes associated with respiratory virus detection before HSCT [22]. During a 5-year period, 308 asymptomatic adult and pediatric patients were screened, but only one patient with RSV and none with influenza virus were identified. Interestingly, this study found other viruses (e.g., human rhinovirus or coronavirus) in 23 patients. These respiratory viruses were not included in our screening program, as they rarely cause severe lower respiratory tract disease. ",

The majority were moved to single rooms (one-bed rooms) or cohorting was used. Droplet and contact precautions were used for all affected patients. Isolation and barrier precautions regarding virus shedders is important, as transmission to roommates has been described [16]. The transfer to single (one-bed) rooms was challenging in some cases, due to the lack of single-room availability. Nonetheless, because of the high mortality rate of RSV and influenza infection in hemato-oncological patients, isolation and barrier precautions were enforced. With these measures, we aimed to lower the risk of patient-to-patient transmission by reducing the exposure of contact patients. The usage of droplet and contact precautions (such as surgical mask and gown) was also intended to reduce exposure of HCWs. All HCWs, whether vaccinated against influenza or not, wore masks when they performed care in patients with RSV or influenza virus. A further benefit of early detection of influenza virus is the possibility of early antiviral therapy for infected patients and prophylaxis with antiviral agents for contact patients [5]. An additional effect of the screening program and the associated audits and feedback talks was the heightened awareness among HCWs and visitors for respiratory viral infections in this highly susceptible, immunocompromised patient population. During the screening period, no nosocomial cluster of influenza virus or RSV was observed on the two wards. ",

Infection control is based on standard precautions (e.g., compliance with hand hygiene, cough etiquette, etc.) together with RSV and influenza pathogen-specific precautionary measures (e.g. droplet precautions, isolation). In special high-risk settings such as hematology and oncology units, additional measures can be useful to lower the risk of hospital acquisition of RSV and influenza. Therefore, we implemented a prophylactic RT-PCR-based RSV and influenza screening program targeting asymptomatic patients. This seasonal screening program enabled us to identify 23 patients who lacked symptoms for respiratory disease, but were infected with either RSV or influenza during a period of about 4 months. For these patients the same infection control practices were implemented as for symptomatic patients with RSV and influenza infection. In our view, this screening program proved useful for identifying asymptomatically infected patients with viral shedding, thus reducing the risk of transmission and potential nosocomial clusters of RSV and influenza virus on hemato-oncological wards. Nevertheless, future studies on larger cohorts, including the analyses of clinical data, are necessary to further validate the use of a seasonal screening program as suggested here.",
