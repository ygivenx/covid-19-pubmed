Parvovirinae was further divided into eight genera, including Protoparvovirus and so on [3]. Canine parvovirus (CPV) and feline parvovirus (FPV) are potentially fatal pathogens for domestic dogs and cats as well as for various wild species, characterized by vomiting, fever, leucopenia, and diarrhea in carnivores, especially life threatening for young animals up to the age of 6 months.",

Thirteen years later, a variant of an FPV like virus named CPV was identified in the fecal samples of dogs with diarrhea and spread worldwide rapidly [5]. Since then, the original CPV-2, which cannot infect cats, was subsequently replaced by three different but closely related antigenic variants (CPV-2a, CPV-2b, and CPV-2c), which can infect cats [5, 6]. CPV has evolved more rapidly than FPV, the substitution rate for the CPV and FPV clade was 1.7 \u00d7 10\u2212 4 and 9.4 \u00d7 10\u2212 5 substitutions per site per year, respectively [7].",

            "text": "Recently, it was reported that 80% of parvovirus isolates from domestic and leopard cats in Vietnam and Taiwan were CPV [8]. Compared with cases that 32.5 and 33.9% infection rates of CPV were demonstrated in a feline-only shelter and a mixed canine and feline shelter in the UK, respectively [8, 9]. In addition, Battilani et al. reported a co-infection case, which was identified to be infected by a new parvovirus variant inter CPV and FPV [10]. Furthermore, studies revealed the inter-FPV subspecies recombination and inter-antigenic recombination of CPV in vaccinated pups were demonstrated, which elucidates a novel mechanism for the emergence of CPV and the evolution of parvoviruses in nature, instead of the high and positive selection theory of parvovirus evolution [11, 12]. Thus, it\u2019s important to develop a diagnostic method that can detect and differentiate CPV from FPV in the same sample. However, traditional methods, such as DNA sequence and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay using a panel of monoclonal antibodies, are expensive, labor-intensive and time-consuming [13, 14]. Afterward, taking into account a single polymorphism G3752A of the viral genome (reference strain: CPV Laika-1993 GenBank accession no. JN033694), a set of primers and probes, FPV/CPV-For, FPV/CPV-Rev and FPV/CPV-Pbs (VIC and FAM), was designed to develop a TaqMan MGB real-time PCR method for differentiating CPV from FPV [15]. However, this TaqMan MGB real-time PCR method was not used for all the prevalent isolates in China, because there are variants of CPV with nucleotide mutant at site 3752, e.g. the HB3 isolate, with the nucleotide mutant of A3752G, (GenBank accession no. GU392238) (Zhang, L. and Yan, X. J., unpublished data). With the application of saturated fluorescent dye, fluorescence data are collected by qPCR instruments at finer temperature resolution and the data are processed in the intuitive software platforms. High resolution melting analysis (HRM) assay is becoming a new method to quickly, inexpensively and efficiently scan clinical samples [16\u201318].",

And clinical diagnosis is always indecisive and slow, due to the fact that a lot of viral pathogens can cause similar clinical signs like diarrhea in cats such as CDV, coronavirus, adenovirus, and rotavirus. Likewise, diseases associated with FPV and CPV are concurrent [20], giving rise to the difficulty of specific pathogen detection of the pathogen. At present, various diagnostic methods were developed for detection of CPV and FPV, such as PCR, quartz crystal microbalance biosensor, hemagglutination, hemagglutination inhibition, immunochromatographic, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and so on [21\u201324]. However, the traditional diagnostic methods cannot detect the pathogen with complete accuracy and are time-consuming and expensive. Thus, the study developed a rapid, inexpensive, sensitive and accurate diagnostic method for discrimination of CPV and FPV with a single PCR.",

A single base change from a purine to pyrimidine was easily identified, which results in a change in Tm of about 1 \u00b0C caused by changes of hydrogen bond number. However, a mutation of A/T or C/G is difficult to discern causing a small change of Tm of about 0.4 \u00b0C [27]. In this study, we designed a pair of primers targeted to amplify 101 bp segment which contains the SNP C4408A to specifically screen CPV and FPV. The data that the qPCR instrument generated were auto-analyzed in HRM analysis software. The HRM assay developed herein is an extremely sensitive, accurate technique to detect and differentiate the CPV and FPV variants. The detection limits of CPV and FPV were both 4.2 copies/\u03bcl (Fig. 4b and c). On the other hand, viral load can be determined by a standard curve. Although it\u2019s not essential for illness diagnosis, quantitation of virus load is of the greatest usefulness in some respects of describing the relationship of viral load and disease progression by monitoring the change of viral titer during infection, surveying vaccine efficacy in vaccine production and assessing the effectiveness of therapy.",

The results show aligned melt curve analysis of pEASY-FPV-H, pEASY-CPV-2a and the mixtures of the two standard plasmids at the ratio of 1:1 (v/v)",

The results showed FPV and CPV were successful distinguished in the dilution range. Standard curves obtained for FPV (b) and CPV (c) indicating the linearity and efficiency for detecting both viruses by qPCR. The dilutions of standard DNA are indicated on the x-axis, whereas the corresponding cycle threshold (Ct) values are presented on the y-axis. The assays were linear in the range of 4.2 \u00d7 100 to 4.2 \u00d7 108 template copies/\u03bcl, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.999 for both FPV and CPV and reaction efficiency of 97.76 and 95.24%.
