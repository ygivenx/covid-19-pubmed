            "text": "Emerging and re-emerging human viral pathogens pose one of the major public health concerns since effective countermeasures are not available to detect, prevent, and treat these viral diseases [1]. The 2013\u20132015 West Africa Ebola epidemic, with more than 25,000 people infected and more than 12,000 deaths, underlines the global challenge dealing with the infection and diseases associated with these viruses. To develop prophylactic and therapeutic options, it is important to understand how these viruses interact with their hosts. Therefore efforts have been made to identify and characterize host factors which are involved in viral replication and infection for different viruses. A recently developed technology, referred to as genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) based screening [2], has been employed by different groups to identify host factors systematically, and a large number of host factors have been implicated as critical for infection for viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1 [3\u20135]) and influenza H1N1 virus [6\u20139], providing mechanistic insights on the virus/host interactions. However, the hit overlaps between screens by different groups are pretty low, with 3\u20136 % for HIV-1 screens and 1\u201312 % for influenza virus screens [10], raising concerns about the potential high false positive rates and even some skepticism on the utility of this technology. Thus, to avoid potential screening artifacts and other issues, it is prudent to carefully design high throughput RNAi screening strategies and to optimize the parameters in the pilot experiments prior to the large-scale screens.",

However this problem can be often circumvented by an HIV-1 based surrogate system in the entry studies and in the drug discovery efforts to identify and develop antivirals targeting the entry process [11\u201317]. This HIV-1 based surrogate assay is particularly amenable for high throughput screens because it is safe and robust. In this report, we describe a genome-wide RNAi high throughput screen strategy, referred to as parallel genome-wide RNAi screen, which allows us to quickly identify host factors important for the entry process of highly pathogenic viruses. This strategy was used for an RNAi screen to identify host proteins specific for the entry process of Marburg virus (MARV) or avian influenza virus H5N1 (AIV), demonstrating the utility of this approach.",

The basic principle of this surrogate assay is based on the following two aspects: (1) AIV and MARV viral envelope glycoproteins (HA and GP, respectively) are necessary and sufficient to mediate virus entry, and (2) these glycoproteins can be efficiently incorporated into HIV-1 viral particles. Therefore these pseudovirions retain the entry property dictated by avian influenza virus H5N1 glycoprotein (HA) or Marburg glycoprotein (GP). Thus, aspects of these entry mechanisms can be evaluated despite of the surrogate nature of the viral particles. Furthermore, the pseudovirions carry a luciferase reporter gene which can be used to measure the entry activity of AIV and MARV [18].",

The key feature of the protocol is that AIV and MARV pseudovirions were used in parallel in the RNAi screen which allowed us to reduce the number of false positives and to quickly identify Marburg-specific and flu-specific host factors (which will be further discussed below). Briefly, human A549 cells (~1000 cells/well) were reverse transfected with 10nM small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in two identical 384-well plates simultaneously. These plates were incubated for 48 h for target gene expression knockdown, followed by challenging one plate with AIV pseudovirions and the other plate with MARV pseudovirions. Virions were replaced with fresh medium 24 h post infection and the plates were incubated for additional 24 h. Luciferase assays were then performed to quantify virus infection.",

The samples show a broad bell-shaped signal distribution, with a little positively skewed. The signal distribution of the non-targeting control was expected to overlap with that of samples.

Theoretically, an siRNA with relative infection index equaling to zero means no bias of the siRNA on the infections of both viruses; an siRNA inhibiting MARV infection or enhancing AIV infection results in a minus value, and an siRNA with an the opposite effect results in a positive value.",

The robust z-score, a robust version of z-score which indicates the number of standard deviations from the mean, was employed to represent data variance. The robust z-score distributions of the normalized signals for the columns and rows from both AIV and MARV screen plates are shown in Fig. 3. Consistent with what we show in Fig. 2b, the distributions from the columns and rows are skewed towards the high z-score value area, with the outer two columns and rows more severely affected. When the relative infection index was introduced, the excess variations of the peripheral positions were greatly reduced and the distributions of columns and rows were corrected to be more symmetrical. The same is true regarding the distributions of the all siRNAs. As shown in Fig. 3 (the bottom panel), the robust z-scores of the normalized signals from both screens are heavily skewed to the right, with almost no siRNAs showing robust z-score less than \u22122, a recommended criterion for picking inhibitory hits. The robust z-scores of the relative infection index, however, are evenly distributed, reducing the skewed distribution caused by the positional effects and making the data more suitable for the hit selection.",

As presented in Fig. 4a, the hit selection began with normalizing the measured luciferase signals by the plate signal medians for MARV and AIV, respectively. These normalized scores were used for calculating the relative infection index, from which a robust z-score was then computed for each siRNA. Thresholds of \u00b12 were adopted for filtering the hits. From the total 64,775 individual siRNAs, 3,036 siRNAs targeting 2,858 genes had robust z-scores less than \u22122, while 2,409 siRNAs targeting 2299 genes had robust z-scores greater than 2. Another criterion (2 siRNAs per gene rule) that a gene must have at least 2 siRNAs showing similar effects was applied to further filter the hits, with the aim of reducing false positive numbers. Accordingly, 173 genes with 351 siRNAs for MARV and 109 genes with 219 siRNAs for AIV were selected, respectively. The individual virus infection rates (the normalized signals) were then employed as a reference to distinguish an inhibitory hit from the one that enhances virus infection. The robust z-scores are plotted against normalized signals of each virus in Fig. 4b and c. A robust z-score less than \u22122 in Fig. 4b means that the MARV infection rate is much less than AIV infection rate for the corresponding siRNA. This may be a result of inhibited MARV infection or of enhanced AIV infection. Thus a MARV score (normalized signal) below 0.5 was used to indicate a MARV inhibitory hit, which is represented in area I in Fig. 4b. A gene with at least two siRNAs\u2019 MARV scores < 0.5 was used to filter the hits in area I, with 106 genes being identified as host factors that inhibit MARV entry. On the contrary, MARV scores greater than 0.8, which means the siRNA has little effect on inhibiting MARV infection, were used to indicate a hit enhancing AIV entry. Area III in Fig. 4b represents these hits and 4 host factors were identified with the 2 siRNAs per gene rule. Similarly, area I in Fig. 4c represents AIV inhibitory hits and 42 genes were identified; area III represents the hits enhancing MARV entry with 12 genes finally identified.",

The other three proteins were identified in our screen as \u201cshared\u201d host factors for both AIV and MARV (data not shown). Proton-transporting V-type ATPase was implicated as the host factor for influenza virus infection by the previous screens [8], and we show that only two subunits of ATPase, APT6V0C and ATP6AP2, are AIV-specific. A number of other subunits (i.e. ATP6AP1, ATP6V0B, ATP6V0D1, ATP6V1A and ATP6V1B2) are not specific to AIV but are \u201cshared\u201d host factors by both viruses. As for MARV, a few essential MARV-specific host factors were identified by the screen in this study. Cathepsin L (CTSL), which primes the filovirus glycoprotein in the endosome [22], EXT1 [23], which is involved in biosynthesis of heparan sulfate, and Niemann-Pick disease, type C1 (NPC1 [24, 25]), showed strong bias against MARV entry (Table 1). Also, HOPS complex, which mediates fusion of the endosome and lysosome, was identified as a host factor for Ebola virus infection in a gene-trap based screen [24], and we identified VPS 16, a subunit of HOPS complex, as a MARV-specific hit in the current screen.",

More importantly, the parallel nature of the strategy allows us to easily identify the host factors for a specific virus with a greatly reduced number of false positives in the initial screen, which is one of the major problems with high throughput screening. The power of this strategy is well illustrated by a genome-wide RNAi screen for identifying the host factors important for MARV and/or AIV as described in this study.",

However, it is clear that these RNAi screens, even performed on the same virus by different groups, do not always identify the same set of host proteins, suggesting that high throughput RNAi screening strategies need to be carefully developed and optimized prior to the actual screening. Thus several features of the screening strategy described here are attractive to identify host proteins involved in viral entry of highly pathogenic enveloped viruses. One obvious advantage of this strategy is that it can distinguish virus-specific hits from the \u201cshared\u201d hits. Because each virus in the screen also serves as a control for the other virus, an siRNA showing effects on one virus but not on the other one will be tentatively classified as a specific hit, as illustrated in Fig. 1. On the other hand, if an siRNA shows similar inhibitory effects on both viruses, the scenarios are more complicated: (1) the siRNA may be toxic to the cells; (2) it may induce an off-target effect; (3) it may target an HIV-1 related process after the pseudovirion is released from the endosome/lysosome; (4) it may target the shared host factors by both viruses (i.e. AIV and MARV in this study).",

The reasons for high false positive rates in a genome-wide RNAi screen are due to a lack of replicates and siRNA off-target effects. In this study, each siRNA was actually tested twice, but with two different viruses. For an siRNA specific to one virus entry, the possibility of obtaining similar results for two different viruses is pretty low, greatly decreasing the false positive rate. For shared hits, the false positive rate also decreases owing to the duplicate nature of this strategy. Further, an siRNA hit due to an off-target effect is likely to affect both viruses' infection and can thus be classified as a \u201cshared\u201d hit, resulting in a lower false positive rate for the virus-specific hit. In addition, it has been recently shown that virus infection rate is largely determined by the population context (e.g. local cell density) of the target cell which can be affected by gene perturbations through RNAi [29]. Because the screens in this study were performed in parallel, the cell population context was, to a large extent, the same for the two viruses, making the results from the two screens highly comparable.",

It has been suggested that the controls evenly scattered over an assay plate by careful plate design can be used to adjust the systematic errors [30]. However, most commercial available siRNA libraries only have the peripheral wells reserved for controls; in our case, only the outer 23 and 24 columns are available for controls, leaving little room for control-based systematic error adjustment. Also, a few mathematical algorithms have been proposed to reduce the effects [31]. These methods usually assume a large difference between a positive and a negative response and the sparseness of positive responses, which is not true for RNAi screens. In fact, RNAi is a very complicated biological phenomenon; even an siRNA targeting an unrelated gene may induce somewhat positive phenotype. Thus modifying the original screen data with additional correction factors by those proposed mathematical treatment may lead to more man-made artifacts.",

The positional effects are largely due to the different evaporation rates across the plate which leads to a multiplicative bias to the measured signal. Because the screens were performed in parallel, the duplicate wells with a same relative position in two plates were screened simultaneously, making them subject to a similar positional effect. This multiplicative bias can thus be corrected by simply dividing virus infection rate by the rate of the other one. In our case, the relative infection index was used to reduce the bias and the results we presented in Fig. 3 have clearly validated this approach.",
