They are common pathogens in children and cause a variety of diseases [1]. HAdV accounts for at least 5 to 10% of pediatric and 1 to 7% of adult respiratory tract infections (RTIs) [2]. There are currently seven different HAdV species (A to G), some of which specifically attack the conjunctiva (species D), the upper and lower respiratory tracts (species B, C and E), and the gastrointestinal tract (species F and G) [3]. Of the 90 AdV serotypes, 55 are known to cause human diseases, with AdV3, 4, 7 and 14 being the most common types to cause respiratory disease outbreaks [4]. HAdV has caused respiratory tract adenovirus outbreaks in Jiangsu and Taiwan provinces of China, as well as in Korea, Singapore and Malaysia [5\u20137]. Such infections have been estimated to cause 2\u20135% of RTIs overall and 4\u201310% of all pneumonias in City of Bethlehem [8].",

At present, China has not yet established a nationwide epidemiological surveillance program for adenovirus infections, and infections with it do not need to be legally reported, so the institutions for disease control and prevention cannot conduct early detection screening or issue early warnings. Neither are there any U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved antivirals for adenoviral infections [10]. HAdVs play an important role in respiratory infections, particularly in children. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the epidemiological, clinical, and molecular characteristics of HAdV infections occurring among children with RTIs in a Chinese tertiary hospital from April 2017 to March 2018. Collectively, the findings from this study underscore the importance of monitoring the epidemiology of HAdV infections and protecting vulnerable patients as part of the suite of infection prevention strategies in hospitals.",

HAdV detection was performed using qPCR assay targeting the highly conserved gene region (132-bp) of the HAdV hexon. TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, USA) was used to amplify HAdV hexon DNA using specific primers (Forward:5\u2032- GCCCCAGTGGTCTTACATGCACATC-3\u2032; Reverse: 5\u2032-GCCACGGTGGGGTTTCT AAACTT-3\u2032) and probe (5\u2032-FAM-TGCACCAGACCCGGGCTCAGGTACTCCGA- 3\u2032-TAMRA) [12]. Each 20 \u03bcL reaction mixture comprised 10 \u03bcL of 2 \u00d7 TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix, 1.8 \u03bcL of each primer (10 pM), 0.2 \u03bcL of probe (10 pM), 4.2 \u03bcL of sterile water, and 2.0 \u03bcL of the nucleic acid components extracted from each sample. The qPCR cycling program was as follows: 50 \u00b0C for 2 min, 95 \u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 15 s, and 60 \u00b0C for 1 min. Samples with a cycle threshold (Ct) < 38 were regarded as positive. 10-fold serial dilutions of pMD18-T/Hexon plasmid from 1010 to 100 copies per \u03bcL were prepared to establish a standard curve to measure the HAdV load. qPCR were performed using the Mx3005P qPCR System (Agilent Stratagene, USA). HAdV-positive samples were subsequently screened for the following pathogens: influenza A (FluA) and B (FluB) viruses, parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) 1\u20134, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human rhinovirus (HRV), WU polyomavirus (WUPyV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human coronaviruses (HCoV) NL63, OC43, 229E, HKU1 and human bocavirus (HBoV), as described previously [13\u201315]. Additionally, mycoplasma pneumonia is determined by the detection of mycoplasma pneumoniae IgM antibody. As for bacterial pneumonia, it was confirmed by sputum culture.",

Viral pneumonia and bacterial pneumonia accounts for 3.23% (2/62) and 4.84% (3/62) of the pneumonia, respectively. In addition, the remaining 10 cases were diagnosed with acute tonsillitis (5), acute upper respiratory infection (2), acute bronchitis (2), as well as 1 with Epstein-Barr virus-associated infectious mononucleosis. The main clinical signs in the HAdV-positive patients were fever (97.22%, 70/72) and cough (75%, 54/72), while the other clinical presentation were vomiting (18.06%, 13/72), gasping (15.28%, 11/72), diarrhea (4.17%, 3/72) and angina (5.56%, 4/72).

Similarly to what has been found in Asia by other authors, HAdV-B3 was the most common type (56.06%, 37/66) followed by HAdV-C2 (19.70%, 13/66) and C1 (10.61%, 7/66). HAdV-B3 has been identified as the causative pathogen for severe acute respiratory illness outbreaks in Korea [31], Brazil [32] and Taiwan [33], and it was the main type of respiratory HAdV infections from 1981 to 2002. Moreover, HAdV-B3 was the pathogen causing epidemic respiratory disease outbreaks in Europe, America, and Oceania. Last, HAdV-B3 is known to cause a characteristic syndrome in older children and adults, as manifested by acute pharyngo-conjunctival fever, especially after contact with summer camps and swimming pools [34]. HAdV- C1 and HAdV-C2 have been frequently reported to cause endemic, sporadic and epidemics cases [35, 36].",

Although the viral load from children mono-infected with HAdV was slightly higher than those co-infected with HAdV and other respiratory viruses, no significant difference was seen between the two groups. The severity of HAdV infection varies according to age, socioeconomic status, environmental status and, above all, the immunological characteristics of the patient. Therefore, the etiological significance of co-infections with HAdV and other respiratory viruses and its association with disease severity require further study. It was reported HAdV can cause more severe illness in immunocompromised patients, so it would be very valuable to know about pre-existing conditions in HAdV-positive children. Except for 4 cases of asthma, there were no other comorbidities in our study. Taken together, our results provide a foundation for further clarification of the role played by HAdVs in RTIs and for defining the clinical and public health significance of HAdV infections.",
