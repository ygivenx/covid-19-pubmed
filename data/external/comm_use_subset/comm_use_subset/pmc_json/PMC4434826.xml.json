Although such devices can be applied clinically [1], plethysmographs designed for small animals provides an effective means to study phenotypes that can be expensive or impossible to carry out in humans. There are several variants of plethysmographs which differ in whether the animal is wholly contained within the chamber and whether they are restrained during the measurements [2]. For whole body plethysmographs [3] a common parameter of interest is enhanced pause (Penh), which can be considered a measure of airway resistance [4]. Some examples of the applications of these devices include studies in asthma [5], sleep apnea [6], cystic fibrosis [7], respiratory viral infection after radiation injury [8] as well as the assessment of host immune response to Respiratory Syncytial Virus after vaccination [9].",

This dataset is available as an R package at https://github.com/dbottomly/plethyData. Demonstration of these features and reproduction of the tables and figures is shown in Additional file 1 and Additional file 4. As is described in the \u2018Parsing\u2019 section of Additional file 1, the plethysmography files we work with are large and structured. Previously sections of these files would be loaded and manipulated in Excel by investigators, a process which was both tedious and error prone. The plethy package simplifies this process and enables efficient exploration and analysis of the data with only a handful of R functions. Assuming the data has been loaded into a database and a BuxcoDB object exists, we can first perform QA/QC of the data followed by exploratory data analysis and model fitting.",

For example, the expectation is that the Flu, SARS and mock infected animals were first allowed an acclimation period of 30 minutes in the chamber followed by 5 minutes of experimental readings. As shown in Additional file 1, these data can be labeled with their inferred run type (acclimation or experimental) and these labels can then be checked for similarity to the experimental design. If deviations are detected, the data can be re-labeled, keeping the old labels for provenance. The plethy package comes with procedures to provide basic checks of the measurement timestamps. One such check is performed internally while parsing and loading the data. This check emits a warning if observed experimental time intervals are greater than a specified tolerance. Similarly, the exact timepoint of an experiment can be computed from the measurement timestamps which are captured in the SQLite database. This enables automatic checking of the labeled experimental timepoint. In the case of the SARS, Flu and mock data, no such anomalies exist but we provide a simulated dataset where they do in the \u2018Quality Control\u2019 section in Additional file 1.

This results in a very rich multivariate experimental dataset which is also potentially longitudinal in nature. As our main use case is the change in respiration measurements over time, we provide two key plotting methods for longitudinal data: tsplot and mvtsplot. Arguably the most common way to visualize longitudinal data is using a simple line plot of the mean response per each animal and time point as is shown in Figure 1 for the Penh phenotype which can be produced using the tsplot method. Additionally, the mvtsplot method produces an adaptation of the multivariate time series plot [11] which combines a heatmap with boxplot-like summaries and a basic line plot to provide a detailed overview of a given experiment (Figure 2). Note that as is shown in both Figures 1 and 2, one of the SARS samples (908_L_s) appears to be anomalous compared to the others in terms of its Penh measurements and bears a greater similarity to the mock samples.\n",

We provide a summaryMeasures method which can compute a wide variety of summaries for each curve as demonstrated for animal \u2018907_B_f\u2019 below in Table 2. Also as mentioned above, retrieveData can provide the user with a data.frame and similarly data can also be returned in matrix form using the retrieveMatrix method. Importantly, either data.frames or matrices can serve as the input to almost all modelling functions in R. For example, we may be interested in assessing the effect of time and infection status on Penh values. As shown in Figures 1 and 2, the Penh response over time is non-linear showing a peak around Day 7 for Flu and 3 for SARS followed by a decline to roughly the level shown by the mock infected animals. An initial model for this might involve infection status and polynomial terms for time. Any such model should also account for the presence of many technical measurements for each sample. For the example code below we make the initial assumption that samples will differ only in terms of the intercept. Assuming bux.db refers to a BuxcoDB object we can fit a cursory mixed effects model [13] (only keeping the last 30 seconds of measurements) as:\n",
