            "text": "A wealth of methods has been developed to interpret quantitative peptide sequence data representing specific biological problems. By way of examples, SignalP, which identifies the presence of signal peptidase I cleavage sites, is a popular method for the prediction of signal peptides [10]; LipoP, which identifies peptidase II cleavage sites, predicts lipoprotein signal peptides in Gram-negative bacteria [11]; various prediction methods predict phosphorylation sites by identifying short amino acid sequence motifs surrounding a suitable acceptor residue [12], [13], [14], [15] etc. In general terms, these methods can be divided in two major groups depending on the structural properties of the biological receptor investigated, and of the nature of the peptides recognized. The simplest situation deals with interactions where a receptor binds peptides that are in register and of a known length. In this case, the peptide data is pre-aligned, and conventional fixed length, alignment-free pattern recognition methods like position specific weight matrices (PSSM), artificial neural networks (ANN), and support vector machines (SVM) can be used. Peptide-MHC class I binding is a prominent example of the successful use of such methods to characterize receptor-ligand interaction represented by pre-aligned data (reviewed in [16]). Another more complex type of problems deals with interactions where either the motif lengths, and/or the binding registers, are unknown. In these cases, the peptide data must a priori be assumed to be unaligned and any bioinformatics method dealing with such data is faced with the challenge of simultaneously recognizing the binding register (i.e. performing an alignment) and identifying the binding motif (i.e. performing a specificity analysis). Peptide-MHC class II binding is a preeminent example of a receptor-ligand interaction represented by unaligned data. Several bioinformatics methods have been developed to identify binding motifs in such peptide data including Gibbs sampling [17], hidden Markov models (HMM) [18], stabilization matrix method (SMM) alignment [19], and alignment using artificial neural networks [20] (for more references see [21]). Another example of unaligned peptide data is that of antibodies interacting with linear peptide epitopes. Although B-cell epitopes frequently are conformational and three-dimensional in structure, some do contain linear components that can be represented by peptide interaction with the corresponding antibodies [22], [23], [24].",

We have recently described a neural network-based data driven method, NN-align, which has been specifically designed to automatically capture motifs hidden in unaligned peptide data [20]. NN-align is implemented as a conventional feed-forward neural network and consists of a two-step procedure that simultaneously identifies the optimal peptide-binding core, and the optimal configuration of the network weights (i.e. the motif). This method is therefore inherently designed to deal with unaligned peptide data, and it identifies a core of consecutive amino acids within the peptide sequences that constitute an informative motif. Note that the method does not allow for gaps in the alignment. Although NN-align was originally developed with the unaligned nature of peptide-MHC class II interaction in mind \u2013 and independent validations have shown that NN-align indeed performs significantly better than any previously published methods for MHC class II motif recognition [25] \u2013 the unique ability of this method to capture subtle linear sequence motifs in quantitative peptide-based data and its adaptability makes it extremely attractive for other applications as well. Here, we have adapted and extended the NN-align method so that it can handle quantitative peptide-based data in general. Making this method generally available for the scientific community, we have embedded it into a public online web-interface that facilitates both handling of input data, optimization of essential training parameters, visual interpretation of the results, and the option of using the resulting method to predict on user-specified proteins/peptides. Through the server the user can easily set up a cross-validation experiment to estimate the predictive performance of the trained method, and automatically reduce redundancy in the data. The logo visualization is also improved with an algorithm that aligns individual neural networks to maximize the information content of the combined alignment. This web-based extension of the NN-align method empowers experimentalists of limited bioinformatics background with the ability to perform advanced bioinformatics-driven analysis of his/her own sets of large-scale data.",

The predictive performance of NNAlign on 12 human MHC class I alleles from data by Peters et al. [27] is shown in \nTable 1\n (see the table footnote for the parameters used). The benchmark data sets contain quantitative binding data of a given length (9 amino acids) covering the whole spectrum from non-binding to strong-binding peptides, hence serving as a perfect illustration of the strength of the NNAlign method to handle pre-aligned peptide data. The overall performances of the three methods are comparable demonstrating that NNAlign competes with state-of-the-art methods designed specifically for MHC class I prediction.",

Binding of a peptide to an MHC class II molecule is primarily determined by a core of normally 9 amino acids, but the composition of the regions flanking the binding core (peptide flanking region, PFR) has been shown to also affect the binding strength of a peptide [29], [30]. Identifying the binding motif and binding register for MHC class II binding peptides is thus a problem that inherently requires simultaneous alignment and binding affinity identification. Here, an MHC class II benchmarking was obtained from the recent publication by Wang et al. [25]. The performance was estimated for each allele using a 5 fold cross validation, where at each step 4/5 of the data were used to train the neural networks, and 1/5 were left out for evaluation. For cross-validation, we preserved the same data partitioning as used in the original publication. In \nTable 1\n, the performance of NNAlign on the Wang set is compared to other publicly available methods for MHC class II prediction. These include SMM-align [19], ProPred/Tepitope [31], [32], as well as the original version of the NN-align algorithm [20]. The NN-align-based methods outperform their competitors on all alleles, confirming the ability of the neural networks in dealing with alignment problems. The difference with the original NN-align method, which is due to differences in network architecture, is small and not significant (p>0.2, binomial test). For this example involving unaligned data, the NNAlign server competes with comparable state-of-the-art methods.",

            "text": "Different positions in a binding motif can be more or less informative, and the ends of a motif can often not be clearly delineated. This prompts the question of how many positions are necessary and sufficient to represent a given motif and how the length of a motif is defined. NNAlign allows searching for the optimal motif length in a quantitative peptide data set. Here, the best motif length is the one that yields, in a cross-validation experiment, the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) between observed and predicted values. By this token, a terminal position is included in the motif if it contributes with information at a level above what could be considered to be noise. In contrast, if the inclusion of a putative terminal position does not lead to a reduction in the RSME then it can be concluded that it does not add useful parameters to the model; rather, it lowers the predictive performance and should be omitted. This approach was used to suggest the motif length of the 14 MHC class II HLA-DR alleles, which were searched for optimal predictive performance by scanning through possible lengths from 6 to 11 amino acids. NNalign will report the length associated with the lowest RMSE value as the optimal motif length (see Figure 2, left hand panel). Nonetheless, the user is advised to inspect the sequence logo as well as the performance plot of the RMSE as a function of the motif length to evaluate whether the dependence upon length appears significant. As defined here and illustrated in Figure 2 right panel, the 9-mer preference of HLA-DRB1*01:01 is significant, whereas the apparent 8-mer preference of HLA-DRB1*15:01 is not significant. In fact, for the 14 HLA-DR molecules included in the benchmark, only one was found to have a single consistent optimal motif length (DRB1*0101 with a motif length of 9 amino acids). For all other molecules the method did identify more than one possible optimal motif length. However, all motif lengths fell in the range of 7 to 10 amino acids, and in all cases a 9-mer motif was compatible with being the optimal motif length.",

As a consequence of different architectures and starting conditions, individual networks might disagree on the exact boundaries of the motif. This disagreement would complicate the visualization of the motif if this was represented as a simple overlay of the individual motifs as exemplified in Figure 3, where sequence logos for four different networks from the ensemble trained on HLA*DRB1-04:01 binding data are shown in panels A through D. The individual networks agree on identifying the same strong primary anchor residues and positions, however, each single network identifies different ends (i.e. suggests different registers of the same motif; in casu starting at positions 1, 2, 2 and 3 of the predicted nonamer peptide). The weak C-terminal primary anchor residue of HLA*DRB1-04:01 probably explains why the boundaries are difficult to determine. A simple overlay of the predictions from individual networks would result in a muddled motif as depicted in Figure 3, panel E. Implementing a Gibbs sampler approach, where matrix representations of the core motifs of different networks are aligned, we introduced an off-set correction for each network aiming at maximizing the information content of a combined logo representation of the motif. This approach led to a considerable improvement in the visual logo representation of the binding motif (Figure 3, panel F). Offset correction is included as an integral part of the method to enhance motif visualization.",

These parameters were found to be optimal in the original NN-align paper for MHC class II binding prediction [20], with the only difference that here we choose a single value for hidden layer size for a matter of prediction speed. Individual networks are aligned to a common register using the offset correction strategy previously described. The sequence logos obtained are shown in Figure 4. The sequence logos reflect the overall consensus of the binding motifs for HLA-DR molecules, namely a prominent P1 anchor with strong amino acids preference towards hydrophobic amino acids in general, and aromatic amino acids as F and Y in particular, and the presence of two or more additional anchors at P4, P6 and/or P9 each with a unique amino acid preference. Even though most of these motifs exhibit a strong preference for hydrophobic and neutral amino acids at most anchor positions, some dramatic deviations from this general pattern exist. Examples of this are the motifs of DRB1*0301 and DRB1*1101 molecules that have strong preferences for charged amino acids at P4 and P6, respectively.",

            "text": "A peptide microarray containing a total of >100,000 peptides (49,838 of which were unique) was digested with the protease trypsin. The peptide sequences had been synthesized using the theme Ac-GAGAXXXXXGAGA, where Ac- is acetyl blocking the peptide alpha-amino group prior to digestion, and X represents amino acids chosen randomly from the 20 natural amino acids (except lysine, as this residue contains an epsilon-amino group, which even without digestion would be detectable (see Materials and Methods for details)). As a result, free amino groups can only be expressed by trypsin cleaved peptides, which then can then be labeled with Dylight549 and quantitated by fluorescence microscopy. A fluorescence microscopy picture of such a digested and stained peptide microarray (Figure 5a) demonstrates both the resolution of the photolithographic peptide synthesis strategy and the dynamic range of the free amino group detection strategy. The resulting data was log-transformed and rescaled to obtain a data distribution covering the spectrum between 0 and 1, which - along with the corresponding peptide sequences encoded as Blosum scores without flanking regions - were used to train an NNAlign method. Training was done with a motif length of 5, a fixed number of 3 hidden neurons, 5-fold exhaustive validation, and stopping at the best test set performance. The prediction method yielded a Pearson correlation between measured values and predictions of r = 0.971, a Spearman correlation of \u03c1 = 0.910, and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) of 0.997 (using a target threshold of t = 0.5). The very high performance measures of the resulting NNAlign method demonstrate both that the recorded peptide digestion data contains a consistent and intelligible signal, and that the NNAlign method is capable of deciphering and predicting this extraordinary large number of sequence-dependent peptide signals. The correlation scatterplot feature of the NNAlign web-server output, which compares predicted vs. observed values, further supports the validity of both the peptide microarray and of the NNAlign method. The correlation scatterplot for the trypsin digestion data reveals two major populations of peptides, one composed of non-degradable, non-predicted peptides and one containing weakly to strongly degradable, predicted peptides (Figure 5b). Few (0.7%) of the former peptides contained Arginine, whereas most (97.1%) of latter peptides contained Arginine. This is exactly what one would have expected from a peptide digestion with trypsin, which is known to cleave at the C-terminal side of amino acids Arginine (and Lysine, which has been excluded here, see above) [34]. For illustration purposes, Figure 5b includes a color-enhanced visualization of certain dipeptide sequences (note, this is not a standard feature of the NNAlign server) showing that RP sequences are resistant, RA sequences are quite susceptible, and RR sequences appear extremely susceptible to trypsin digestion. Thus, the known trypsin resistance of RP sequences is both demonstrated by the peptide microarray and subsequently captured by the NNAlign method. Note, that both the peptide microarray and the NNAlign generate a continuous set of measurements and predictions showing that trypsin cleavage involves a more complex interaction than a simple recognition solely of an Arginine residue (and by inference a Lysine residue), which would have resulted in a cleaved/non-cleaved classification [35]. It is also important to note that the detection strategy employed here does not reveal where the protease cleavage has occurred, but merely that the protease has recognized the peptide as a substrate and cleaved it somewhere.",

As shown here, NNAlign easily competes with state-of-the-art methods for identifying peptide-binding motifs of aligned (exemplified by MHC class I) as well as unaligned (exemplified by MHC class II) quantitative peptide sequence data. Further, demonstrating the general utility of NNAlign, we have used it to characterize the cleavage specificities of proteases from high-throughput peptide array data. If a sufficient number of training examples can be generated, including negative instances, we could envision applying the method also on data generated by phage display peptide libraries. Other instances of recognition of short specific peptide motifs occurs frequently in biology where they are involved in molecular interaction, recognition, signaling, internalization, modification etc (e.g. phosphorylation, dephosphorylation, trafficking motifs, SH2 and SH3 domains, glycosylation, lipidation, etc. In contrast to domain recognition, short linear peptide sequences are thought to be particularly difficult to identify due to their unordered structure [40]. NNAlign appears to be ideally suited to identify such short linear peptide targets. Due to its simple interface and robust performance, we believe the method to constitute a significant tool providing the non-bioinformatician end-user with the ability to perform advanced bioinformatics-driven analysis of large-scale peptide data sets.",
