Similarly, it is widely agreed that risks to participants must be minimized and proportionate to any potential clinical benefits for them and/or the social value of the research [4]. Yet, the Zika challenge studies reveal unresolved questions about upper-risk limits in research with competent consenting adults, and the value of research that could justify exposing them to significant risks [5]. The answer to these questions will shape the conduct of clinical research in future disease outbreaks and requires global ethical debate.

Moreover, there has been a clear push to share not just research but data. This revolution is occurring on all levels, from digitizing primary field or clinical data, to sharing genomic sequence or experimental data, to developing standards for compiling and disseminating epidemiological data from local health departments up to the World Health Organization.

In June 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration approved sofosbuvir/velpatasvir as the first oral, single-tablet, pan-genotypic cure, based on the findings of ASTRAL-1 through -4 that were, in part, carried out in Hong Kong [7].

Although influenza vaccines are updated to keep abreast of this rapidly mutating virus, the virus continues to be unpredictable with newly circulating strains evading strain specificity, leading to vaccine failure. An international team led by Yoshi Kawaoka at the Universities of Tokyo and Wisconsin [8] reported a strategy that may potentially allow us to keep one step ahead of the virus. Using random mutagenesis of the viral hemagglutinin together with human immune sera to mimic in vitro the immune selection pressure that occurs in nature, they were able to anticipate which way the virus was likely to evolve, thereby assisting seasonal vaccine strain selection. Separately, Poon and colleagues examined within-host virus genetic diversity when influenza is transmitted in Hong Kong households and demonstrated that multiple virus strains are cotransmitted in the community [9]. The future antigenic drift variants were found to cocirculate as a minor virus population years before they finally emerge as an epidemic strain. Thus, the vaccine virus candidate of tomorrow is hiding as a minor variant within the influenza strains circulating today; and we now have the means to look for them.",

First, we must look at workforce diversity using a scientific lens\u2014and second, we must insist that all our efforts are informed by data. Which programs and strategies work, and in what contexts? How can successful approaches be shared? Third, we must accept the fact that science is a human endeavor that is affected by sociocultural factors. Often, these influences, like bias, are unintentional. Yet they can make and break careers, and individuals from under-represented groups, including women, are especially vulnerable.

The poor implementation and lack of enforcement of the NIH Revitalization Act has led to worsened health outcomes among patients and, as a result, greater racial/ethnic health disparities. African American patients, and by proxy their family members, are more likely than Whites to be incorrectly diagnosed as having a serious heart disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, because the diagnostic clinical studies underlying the test for this life-threatening heart condition did not include enough African Americans as healthy controls [12]. Similarly, the widely successful heart drug clopidogrel (Plavix) was developed mostly among Whites yet was successfully marketed in Hawaii, a Pacific Island, despite being ineffective for 45% of Asians and 77% of Pacific Islanders [13]. On the other hand, clinical studies that embrace the ethos of the NIH Revitalization Act ultimately benefit all people. The discovery of PCSK9 missense mutations in African Americans with unusually low LDL cholesterol allowed for the development of a new class of drugs that have revolutionized cholesterol therapy regardless of race/ethnicity [14].",

These children are especially at risk when US funding organizations and scientists are not held accountable for recruiting populations that truly reflect the diversity of America. Asthma is the most common and disparate chronic health condition among children [16]. Asthma prevalence in the US is highest among Puerto Ricans (36.5%), intermediate among Blacks (13.0%) and Whites (12.1%), and lowest among Mexican Americans (7.5%) [17]. Asthma mortality is 5.5-fold higher in Puerto Ricans compared to Mexican Americans [18]. Despite these striking disparities, less than 4.5% of NIH-funded pulmonary studies in the last 20 years have included minority populations [19].",
