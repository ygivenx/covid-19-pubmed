Lack of inhibition leads to excessive inflammation and autoimmunity and other severe disease symptoms. One of the receptors regulating this balance is CD200 Receptor (CD200R) [1]. CD200R was originally described as a myeloid receptor [2], being expressed on macrophages, granulocytes and DCs, but later we and others recognized that it is also expressed on T cells, B cells and NK cells [3], [4]. The CD200R intracellular domain is devoid of the classical immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) present in most immune inhibitory receptors but it does have three tyrosine residues that can be phosphorylated, one of which is embedded in an NPXY motif. CD200R-downstream signaling is dependent on the recruitment of Dok2 and RasGAP [5].",

We monitored viral spread using bioluminescence imaging (BLI) at day 2 and 4 after infection [14], [15]. Interestingly, at both time points we observed a decreased viral spread in female WT mice when compared to males. Moreover, lack of CD200 resulted in a significantly lower level of viral replication in females (\nFigure 1A,B\n and Figure S1A,B,C). The viral RNA load in the livers at day 4 was assessed by quantitative PCR and confirmed the imaging results: WT female mice had significantly lower viral RNA levels than WT male mice (\nFigure 1C\n). Again, CD200-deficiency greatly decreased virus load in female mice. This was confirmed in histological liver sections stained with a monoclonal antibody against MHV (data not shown). The number of focal lesions in the liver, typical for MHV was also lower in female mice and again CD200-deficiency had a significant effect on these lesions only in female mice (\nFigure 1D,E\n).",

Our observed sex difference in IFN-\u03b1 production and viral clearance upon MHV infection in mice is likely due to a similar sex bias in TLR7 responses. We hypothesized that CD200R signaling suppresses TLR7 responses in WT mice. Release of this inhibition would further reveal the intrinsically higher TLR7 responses in females and result in more rapid viral clearance. To test this hypothesis, we first administered a TLR7 ligand in vivo. As described previously [18], intraperitoneal injection of a synthetic TLR7 ligand (imiquimod) leads to rapid release of type I IFN into the circulation. One-hour after injection we only detected significant amounts of IFN-\u03b1 in the sera of female Cd200\u2212/\u2212 mice, confirming the notion that CD200R inhibits the intrinsic potential for a higher TLR7 response in females (\nFigure 2B\n). We sacrificed the mice at 24 hrs after ligand injection, at which time point no serum IFN-\u03b1 was detectable (data not shown) but type I IFN mRNA could be detected in the livers of these mice. Again, females expressed more IFN-\u03b2 mRNA than males, with CD200-deficient female mice displaying even more elevated IFN-\u03b2 mRNA levels (\nFigure 2C\n). Thus, release of CD200-mediated inhibition leads to increased production of type I IFN in response to TLR7 ligands, particularly in female mice.",

We generated a chimeric construct containing a LAIR-1 receptor in which the intracellular tail was replaced by that of CD200R. This allows for efficient cross-linking using anti-LAIR-1 antibodies to induce signaling via the CD200R cytoplasmic tail. We transfected HEK 293 cells with plasmids encoding a LAIR-1-CD200R chimeric receptor, human TLR7 and a luciferase reporter under control of a NF-\u03baB driven promoter. Cross-linking of the chimeric receptor by anti-LAIR-1 antibody, but not by isotype-matched control antibody, resulted in robust inhibition of imiquimod-induced NF-\u03baB activity (\nFigure 3A\n). CD200R contains three intracellular tyrosine residues. A chimeric LAIR-1-CD200R protein in which all three tyrosines are mutated to phenylalanine (FFF) did not suppress TLR7 responses upon cross-linking, indicating that the observed inhibitory effect is indeed dependent on CD200R-signaling (\nFigure 3A\n). In a cell line with stable ectopic expression of TLR7 and transient expression of the NF-\u03baB-reporter and the LAIR-1-CD200R constructs we also observed that TLR7 signaling was inhibited through CD200R-mediated signaling. A similar effect was observed when luciferase expression was driven by an IFN-\u03b2 promoter (\nFigure 3B\n). Thus, the enhanced type I IFN production and viral clearance of MHV in female Cd200\u2212/\u2212 mice can be explained by the release of CD200R-mediated inhibition of the intrinsically higher TLR7 responses in females.",

Although male Cd200\u2212/\u2212 mice lost more weight than WT males, the weight loss started later and the difference was not as prominent (\nFigure 4D\n). This may indicate that lack of CD200 results in a more severe pathology in females. We observed an increased level of cellular infiltration in lung tissue of females (Figure S2A). Therefore we determined lung cellular influx by differential cell count in BAL fluid (Figure S2B\u2013D). The total number of cells in BAL fluid was higher in all female groups but differences were not significant (Figure S2B). The number of lymphocytes was increased in females of both genotypes (Figure S2D). At day 4 after infection, the number of lymphocytes was increased in females of both WT and Cd200\u2212/\u2212 groups. At day 8, the number of neutrophils in the BAL fluid was decreased in all groups, still the WT females displayed elevated numbers over males. Importantly, lack of CD200 resulted in significantly higher neutrophil counts in females but not in males (\nFigure 4E\n). As an additional parameter of lung damage we measured the total protein content in the BAL fluid. Lack of CD200 resulted in increased protein levels in the BAL fluid of both males and females, especially at day 8 after infection (\nFigure 4F\n). Overall these data indicate that female mice experience increased lung pathology upon influenza A virus infection, which is aggravated by the lack of the CD200R-regulatory pathway.",

This study is the first to report a significantly enhanced viral clearance in female mice due to a sex bias in TLR7 responses. Sex differences in TLR7 induced type I IFN production have previously been reported for humans [16], [17] and our data show that in mice this has a strong impact on the course of a viral infection. The mechanism for this is not understood. On the one hand, incomplete inactivation of the Tlr7 gene, on the X chromosome, resulting in higher TLR7 expression in females has been proposed [19], [20]. In our experiments, TLR7 mRNA expression was equal in male and female mice (Figure S3). This is consistent with a prior report in which no evidence for escape from X-inactivation of the Tlr7 gene in humans was found [16]. There are conflicting reports concerning the influence of sex hormones on TLR7 responses [16], [17]. Alternatively, sex-dependent epigenetic mechanisms may contribute [16].",

CD200R is a unique inhibitory receptor, since its intracellular tail does not contain ITIMs. CD200R does contain three intracellular tyrosine residues. Mutation of all three tyrosine completely abrogates its inhibitory function [23]. The most distal tyrosine is located in an NPXY motif, to which the adaptor molecule Dok2 is recruited [24].

Neutrophil responses to influenza virus infection were shown to be dependent on TLR7 [25]. Since neutrophils express CD200R, the strongly increased neutrophil influx in female Cd200\u2212/\u2212 mice is in line with our finding that CD200R inhibits sex-biased TLR7 responses. In contrast to MHV infection, clearance of influenza A virus is not dependent on plasmacytoid dendritic cells [26]. Although influenza RNA triggers TLR7 [27], the main source of type I IFN is the infected respiratory epithelium [28].

As a result of this, inhibitory immune pathways have become therapeutic targets to strengthen anti-tumor responses and develop (adjuvant) therapeutic strategies in cancer treatment. The successful application of anti-CTLA4 (Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4) in melanoma is followed up with blocking agents for other checkpoints, among which the CD200-CD200R immune inhibitory pathway. Strong evidence for a role for CD200 in tumor progression comes from studies in patients. Expression of CD200 is an independent prognostic factor for multiple myeloma and acute myeloid leukemia predicting worse overall survival of these patients [29], [30]. A clinical trial with a blocking anti-CD200 antibody aims to enhance anti-tumor responses towards CD200-expressing malignancies (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00648739). On the basis of our data, one of the predicted side effects would be severe immune pathology to infections.",

We are the first to demonstrate a strong sex bias in type I IFN production and viral clearance in mice utilizing two different models of virus infection. This is of importance for scientists studying these widely used models and may result in a completely different interpretation of data obtained, depending on the sex of the mice used. Moreover, sex biased clinical responses to virus infections have been reported in humans [31]. For influenza A virus (H5N1) a significantly enhanced case-fatality rate was found in women [32]. In agreement with these findings we now show increased lung damage, enhanced neutrophil influx and elevated IL-8, IL-6 levels in BAL fluid of female mice upon influenza A virus infection. A few reports discuss the possibility of a sex bias in severity of SARS-CoV infection [33], [34]. Also for HIV-1 infection, sex-related differences have been well-established [35], [36]. Our results underscore the importance of the issue of sex bias in scientific research, clinical trails, and vaccine studies, previously raised by others [19], [37]. Particularly, CD200 blocking antibodies are currently entering clinical trials for cancer treatment. Our data point to a possible pathological outcome of e.g. influenza virus infection in women as a result of CD200 blocking therapies.",
