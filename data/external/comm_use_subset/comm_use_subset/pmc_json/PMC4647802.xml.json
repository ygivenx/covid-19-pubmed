Knowledge on contact patterns is therefore important for the design of optimal outbreak control strategies [1\u20134]. To accurately understand and explain epidemic dynamics, information is required on the underlying contact network of a host population, i.e., a network that contains all contact persons potentially at risk for infection. For example, the number of contacts an infectious individual has with susceptible persons determines among others the basic reproduction number R0 (i.e., the number of secondary cases one case generates in a susceptible population) [5].",

Previous empirical studies of contact patterns used different methods of data collection, including direct observation, contact diaries and electronic proximity sensors, to quantify social mixing behaviour for a variety of populations [7, 8]. For example, the POLYMOD study, a large randomized study in eight European countries, used contact diaries to analyse mixing patterns of independent respondents [9]. Despite controversies on the different modes of transmission of respiratory infectious diseases [10], face-to-face conversations and physical contact are often used as proxies for potential infectious contacts [9, 11]. Close contact persons such as family, friends and colleagues are thereby assumed to capture the majority of contacts for potential transmission events [12].",

Respondent-driven detection, a method of detection derived from snowball sampling, is a chain recruitment method that allows for systematic sampling of contact persons of participants. Previously, we demonstrated that under certain conditions such a recruitment method can be applied online to extract topological properties of contact networks in an anonymous manner [15, 16]. This approach provides novel insights in contact network structures compared to studies that sampled participants independently of one another and collected no information about the network beyond the contact persons reported by participants [7]. In these earlier studies \u2018seed\u2019 individuals of similar age groups and backgrounds were sampled at convenience [15, 16]. Furthermore, complex mechanisms may play a role when participants choose from amongst their contact persons and when contact persons decide whether to join the survey [11]. For example, with an offline (i.e., paper based) chain recruitment method participants have a tendency to recruit spatially proximal peers [17]. This determines the type of contact networks being sampled. Note that we distinguish respondent-driven detection from respondent-driven sampling as our main objective was to study contact networks, and not to estimate population proportions from the sample.",

We showed that such respondent-driven approach can be used to improve the detection of symptomatic cases [19]. In this paper we were interested in the contact networks of respondents and the association with self-reported disease. In particular, we aimed to determine correlations between participants linked by recruitment chains (i.e., who recruits whom) with respect to sociodemographic characteristics, vaccine-induced immunity and self-reported symptoms. In addition, we investigated the effect of spatial peer recruitment on these correlations. If recruitment of contact persons by participants is random, these statistical relationships reflect the underlying contact networks in the general population that are relevant for the transmission of respiratory pathogens.",

A larger household size was associated with a higher number of contact persons. Participants with ILI had less contact persons than persons without these symptoms. Such reduction in numbers of contacts has also been observed among ILI cases during the 2009 influenza epidemic and may be explained by people staying at home and avoiding social activities when ill [29].

Symptomatic participants showed a tendency to recruit other symptomatic participants, at least for one or more symptoms and self-reported influenza. This observation lends some support to our hypothesis that via respondent-driven recruitment we reached contact persons whom a participant may infect or by whom a participant may get infected in case of an infectious disease outbreak. The self-reported symptom data by pairs of participants provides an indication on disease clustering in contact networks.

A stratification on distance of the relationships between recruiter-recruit pairs showed differences in the type of recruited contact persons. There may be several explanations why a participant invited certain contact persons [35]. For example, symptomatic participants may have been biased towards inviting symptomatic contact persons who lived further away than contact persons whom they more frequently meet. A proper assessment would require to investigate the \u2018pool of contact persons\u2019 from which a recruiter can choose, and which contact persons were invited but did not join the survey. Furthermore, identifying different types of relations (e.g., family members, friends or colleagues) by asking recruits about their recruiter would allow further clarification of the observed correlations. Such information can only be collected with a non-anonymous survey design, which would also make it possible to measure transitivity, i.e., the extent to which contact persons of a participant are also contact persons of each other [36]. This network property is known to reduce the rate at which an infection can spread through a network [36\u201338].",

In addition, proportions of contact persons at different locations were similar to POLYMOD and the regression analysis showed similar covariates such as age, household size and days of week to affect degree. This suggests for online recruitment that invited contact persons are in general representative for the contact persons daily encountered by participants and that respondent-driven detection can indeed provide accurate information on the underlying contact network. However, despite the fact that recruitment criteria were set the same for all participants, regardless of whether they reported symptoms, we cannot preclude a bias in how participants chose from their contact persons. The age matrices were statistically not comparable. There may be several explanations for this statistical discrepancy, such as a difference in the age distributions of the samples and the fact that POLYMOD participants were able to report an unrestricted number of contact persons, while our survey participants could only invite a maximum of four contact persons.",

The mean number of contact persons per participant was therefore likely higher than in previous studies [9, 39]. More importantly, we did not collect information on contact intensity and duration. The probability of transmission between individuals requires different levels of contact for different infectious diseases, e.g., influenza and measles require only spatial proximity between individuals to transmit, while Ebola is believed to require physical contact to cause infection [7, 14]. Note that the survey did not include questions on other potentially important transmission routes, such as exposure not involving physical contact or conversation (e.g., sneezing passenger in public transport) or indirect fomite transmission from shared contaminated objects [7]. Earlier studies explicitly linked contact intensity and duration with infection risk and showed their importance for understanding transmission dynamics [40, 41]. Contact duration also influences the likelihood that a certain contact is reported, e.g., contacts of long duration are substantially more likely to get reported than contacts of short duration [42, 43]. It is possible to derive these contact metrics from earlier studies, but not to exclude the effect of heterogeneities in motivation or recall capabilities on reported numbers of contacts, e.g., between male and female participants [42].",

For comparison with POLYMOD, the sample was weighted for the size of POLYMOD age groups (weights are displayed in Additional file 1), and the category \u201cat the home of family and friends\u201d was combined with \u201cother\u201d. POLYMOD was regrouped as \u201chome\u201d, \u201cwork\u201d (at work and at school combined) and \u201cother\u201d (leisure, travel and other combined), frequency of contact with the same person was ignored and for contact at multiple locations only the first entry was counted (equivalent to our questionnaire)",
