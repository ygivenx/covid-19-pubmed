The spread of antimicrobial drugs resistances demands rapid and yet reliable characterization of causative agents to prevent treatment failures and evitable occurrences of resistances [1\u20133]. Regular identification of emerging pathogens [3] and implementation of new molecular techniques [4] bring greater technical complexity, while prompt results and better cost-efficiency are expected [5\u20137]. Besides these evolutions, the awareness about medical errors and their consequences emphasizes the great importance of quality in health [8,9]. Indeed, clinical laboratories and related quality management programs have a role in preventing deaths due to evitable medical errors [10].",

CA programs can be simple, such as direct observation of technicians and quizzes to complete, or more sophisticated, with for instance, submission of blind challenge samples [23\u201328]. Despite the different approaches evaluated in the literature, most suffer of similar limitations as QC, with a primary focus on individuals performing defined analytical phases and limited insight on the overall quality of laboratory processes. CA programs can also certainly be biased when the workers identify the time of evaluation. Interestingly, blind resubmissions of previously analyzed samples, which is one of the methods suggested in literature for CA purposes, seem to suffer of less limitations but are only seldom used [24].",

This approach was retained to increase the number of samples for which the adequacy of bacterial identification and antibiotics susceptibility could be investigated. The analysis request forms were replicated with anonymous identification data, which are commonly used in our institution for clinical research purposes (and thus not assimilated by our technician to a quality control). Part of the original sample material was taken into a new container and handed back in secret at the reception of the laboratories.

For each parameter, the amplitude of discrepancies was classified according to S1A Table. The most important discrepancy between all parameters of a pair of samples was recorded. We examined the discrepancies for each parameter by linearly weighted Kappa score using GraphPad QuickCalcs website [35]. Kappa score quantifies the level of correspondence between the ratings of two observers, considering the natural probability to obtain the same level of concordance only by chance [36]. The weighted version of Kappa score is used to consider the partial agreements within ordered scales [37]. We adopted the weighting suggested by Cicchetti et Allison [38], which sanctions discrepancies in a linear and not in a quadratic method [39].",

The 123 tests were often completed within panels of multiple tests detecting antibody reactivity for the same pathogen (in total 76 different pathogen-specific panels), sometimes reducing the negative impact of discordant results. Thus, this first discordant result was accompanied by electrochemiluminescence (ECLIA) results, which were both times positive for anti-CMV IgG antibodies (4.84 and 4.78 U/ml with a cutoff of 1 for positivity). The second discordant pair of results was in the titers of a syphilis test (TPPA) obtained manually, being twice positive but with titers of 1/2'560 initially and 1/10\u2019240 when redone. The clinical impact was considered significant in this 2nd case since a high titer of 1/10\u2019240 generally reflects an acute infection and since this difference of two dilutions might be considered as clinically relevant [40,41].

Even though all these six qualitative discrepancies were expected since being below the level of sensitivity of our PCRs, we considered that such results may have a significantly different clinical impact (Table 1).

However, this difference was not considered clinically significant (Table 1). A Parainfluenza 2 also tested in a nasopharyngeal secretion was initially reported at 505\u2019000 copies/ml and then reported at only 50\u2019000 copies/ml when redone, a difference not considered to be associated with a significant clinical impact; this one log10 difference in viral load quantification was likely due to a technical error when redone since the CT difference was of 2.4 (31.0 versus 33.4) (Fig 1e and Table 1). The third quantitatively discordant result corresponded to the detection of HSV-1 in a vaginal swab with a viral load of 9.6\u00d71010 copies/ml versus 1.6\u00d7108 copies/ml, a difference identified to be due to a human transcription error since the Ct values were similar (19.8 and 19.0) (Fig 1f). This error was sufficient to lead to a change of process with implementation of automated data transfer from the PCR automated system to the Laboratory Information System (LIS), but was not considered to have a significant clinical impact (Table 1). The fourth quantitative discordance had little clinical impact (Table 1) despite the Ct difference (39.1 versus 35.4) since the calculated EBV viral load exhibited a difference of less than one log10 (182 versus 771 copies/ml) (Fig 1g).",

Major discordances were observed in 5.3%, 4.9% and 3.7% for Gram-negative coccobacilli, Gram-negative bacilli and Gram-positive bacilli, respectively (Table 2). Overall agreement of the microscopy was of 75.2% (560/745) of all evaluated parameters, whereas the occurrence of a major error occurred in 6.4% of cases (48/745) (Tables 1 and 2). However, this relatively high overall agreement rate should be weighted by the common negativity of some parameters such as Gram-positive diplococci (100% of negativity), yeasts (96.3%) and Gram-negative coccobacilli (93.0%). Thus, after excluding those parameters, the obtained overall agreement would drop significantly from 75.2% to 67.6%. True rate of concordance is better assessed by weighted Kappa scores, shown in Table 2 for each parameter. As many as 13 out of 71 (18.3%) samples exhibiting at least one discrepancy were considered as having a clinically relevant discordance, corresponding to a rate of 16.0% (13/81) for all Gram stain results investigated (Table 1). The discrepancies were considered by our experts to be possibly related to reading or reporting errors in 8 out of 13 significant and in 11 out of 58 negligible discrepant pairs of samples, while the rest seemed compatible with natural biological variations (e.g. sample and coloration heterogeneity). It should also be noted that for two samples, the Gram stain reading was done only for one of the replicates because of pre-analytical disagreement on the aspect of urine (urines are examined under microscopy only if considered cloudy). Regarding the effect of the time delay between the management of the original samples and their replicates, no significant differences were observed, when comparing the identical and negligible discrepant results versus the minor and major discrepant results. This absence of difference was recovered both when comparing all parameters together and bacteria and yeasts only.",

Most discrepant results were due to the stochastic variability of qPCR occurring around the limit of detection, where by definition qPCRs lose part of their sensitivity [42]. Accordingly, these discrepancies should not be considered as technical errors or insufficiencies. Yet, this variability for weakly positive samples may be overlooked by clinicians who often give too much importance to negative results, even when the negative predictive value is known to be low (i.e. for M. tuberculosis detection and for Listeria PCR in cerebrospinal fluid). While such discrepancies are of limited implication in terms of quality assurance, the single quantitative discrepancy of a 610-folds factor between copies/ml, with almost identical Ct number, was worrisome. Investigations revealed that this difference was the consequence of an error in the manual transcription of the result. In this specific situation, this error did not have clinical impact, since both results would be interpreted as highly positive by clinicians. However, this error highlighted a weak point in our procedures and led us to integrate our automated PCR system with a middleware capable of two directions data transfers from the Applied Biosystems PCR machine to the LIS, in order to definitively abolish any risk of human errors during results retranscription. Made worthy, no false positive seem to have resulted from PCR contaminations. This is particularly remarkable considering the high sensitivity of PCR and likely results from the advanced automatization of our qPCR platform [19]. Moreover, our IQA process proved itself useful to detect potential errors in this laboratory.",

According to this score, we conclude that in our laboratory the counts of host cells (leukocytes, erythrocytes) is less reliable than the counts of bacteria.

Errors were typically suspected when discrepancies were not compatible with biological variations because they were of very large amplitude or when confusion was suspected (e.g. ++++ Gram-positive cocci versus ++++ erythrocytes). Nevertheless, the factors leading to result heterogeneity and errors are numerous for Gram stains. Indeed, the important heterogeneity of samples such as sputa or fragments and the heterogeneity induced by the staining process can already bring a lot of variability before the reading phase itself, which is a task known as subjective and complex. Moreover, despite the high proportion of discrepant cases, our experts concluded that most of them would have no clinical impact, mainly because they involved host cell quantifications and not detection of bacteria (Table 1). Furthermore, the clinical impact of Gram stains itself is subject to discussion, as for the diagnosis of pneumonia [48,49]. Nevertheless, if the importance of Gram results can be relativized, our work also showed that discrepancies in microscopy results can influence subsequent analytical steps, with significant impact on final culture and AST results transmitted to the clinicians (Tables 3 and 5).",

They are centrifuged and the supernatant is directly transferred into new tubes. This implies that the replicates could only come from already treated samples and that their visual aspect was different from almost all routine samples. The technicians of this facility are routinely checking anterior results from the tested patients to integrate the new results within their serological status. Because we were using a limited pool of anonymous patient profiles, our technicians eventually faced multiple anterior results corresponding to IQA samples processed earlier. Both the visual difference of samples and the anterior results from anonymous patient\u2019s profile led to strong suspicions of the staff working in the serology laboratory about our ongoing experimental IQA process, which finally obliged us to discontinue the IQA in this laboratory. This specific issue did not concern the two other facilities where our process could be completed in secret and on samples that were not pretreated. Despite this limitation, we consider that our process could still have an interest for IQA in serology laboratories, but that it would need to be partly redesigned. A proposition would be to duplicate samples before their arrival in the laboratory. It would solve the problem of visual impact and improve the coverage of pre-analytical steps. It would also be necessary to use more sophisticated fake patient identities, without previous IQA results to prevent their recognition by our coworkers.",

Thus, we intend to extend this quality assurance project by collaborating with three other Swiss hospital laboratories. Each laboratory would challenge the others with split samples sent into containers accompanied by etiquettes and identifications used by the receiving laboratories for their external demands. This way, each laboratory would play the role of reference laboratory for one fourth of all samples. This approach would resolve the limitations of our scheme concerning the pre-treatment of the serology samples, the recognition of the samples and the lack of reference results. Such interlaboratory shared quality assurance would also help to provide \u201cexternal assurance\u201d for some serological and molecular parameters for which there is currently no EQA available (i.e. Tropheryma whipplei).",
