Like many other mycoplasmas, M. alkalescens is a normal inhabitant of the upper respiratory tract, but it has also been associated with disease. M. alkalescens has mostly been implicated in mastitis in cattle. It has been isolated from bulk tank milk samples, as well as from outbreaks and sporadic cases of clinical mastitis [2-5]. Furthermore, M. alkalescens has been isolated from cases of severe arthritis, and its ability to induce joint lesions has been confirmed under experimental conditions [6,7]. Rosenfeld & Hill [8] isolated M. alkalescens in pure culture from abomasum and lung of an aborted bovine foetus, while Lamm et al. [9] found M. alkalescens in association with otitis in calves. Finally, M. alkalescens has occasionally been found in association with disorders of the respiratory tract [10,11].",

The samples were examined for the presence of bacterial pathogens, bovine respiratory mycoplasmas, as well as for the presence of bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine coronavirus and parainfluenza-3 virus (PI-3). The samples were not examined for infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus, as Denmark is considered free of this infection. Thereby, eight arginine-metabolizing mycoplasmas were isolated. In the present study the identification of the isolates as M. alkalescens is presented. This is the first report of isolation of this species in Denmark.",

The isolates were filtered through 0.45 \u03bcm membrane filters (Millipore), cloned and submitted to serologic identification, which was performed by the disc growth inhibition test (DGI) with 6 mm filter paper discs prepared with rabbit hyperimmune antisera against M. alkalescens PG51T (ATCC 29103; NCTC 10135), Mycoplasma arginini G230T (ATCC 23838; NCTC 10129) and Mycoplasma canadense 275CT (ATCC 29418; NCTC 10152), as well as by the indirect epi-immunofluorescence test (IF) on colonies on solid medium. Molecular identification of the isolates was performed by amplification and sequencing of their 16S rRNA genes by using universal primers [14].",

The reactions were clear-cut for the DGI tests showing approximately 3\u20135 mm broad zones of total or nearly total inhibition around the disc. In the IF test some minor cross reactions were noted when three of the isolates and the type strain of M. alkalescens PG51T were tested with anti-M. canadense 275CT hyperimmune serum. The 16S rDNA sequences of the analysed isolates were identical to each other and to the 16S rDNA sequence of the type strain M. alkalescens PG51T (GenBank accession no.

            "text": "Previous studies have shown that H. somni, M. haemolytica and P. multocida are the bacteria that are most commonly associated with bronchopneumonia in calves in Denmark, although they are also part of the normal bacterial flora of the respiratory tract [16,17]. Also, S. Dublin, which is predominantly found in cattle, is capable of causing pneumonia in calves. Isolation of these bacterial species in the submitted samples most likely indicate their role as the primary cause of respiratory disease in the herd, probably in combination with unidentified environmental factors. In addition to the bacteria, M. bovirhinis and M. alkalescens were also isolated. M. bovirhinis is commonly found as a part of the normal respiratory tract microflora of cattle and is not considered to be pathogenic. M. alkalescens, however, has been found in association with disorders of the respiratory tract but its role as a respiratory pathogen remains equivocal. Experimental infections have demonstrated that M. alkalescens has the ability to colonize lung tissue [18], but the two strains used in the study apparently failed to produce pneumonia [18]. In the present study, we found M. alkalescens in pure culture in five of the analysed bronchoalveolar lavage samples. This finding is, however, not sufficient to warrant a role of M. alkalescens as a cause of bronchopneumonia, since we also found two samples containing only a non-pathogenic M. bovirhinis, and two samples without any bacterial or viral pathogens, despite the fact that they derived from calves with clinical signs of a respiratory disease. The failure to detect respiratory tract pathogens in these samples may be due to i.e., their absence in a particular disease stadium when sampling took a place or due to antibiotic treatment. Taking into the consideration the overall bacteriological findings of this study, it seems likely that M. alkalescens may have had a role either as a secondary invader or as an opportunistic pathogen rather than suggesting a causal role of the organism in the pneumonia complex.",
