            "text": "Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) virus is a highly attenuated poxvirus with promising properties as a vectored vaccine. MVA initiates but cannot complete a full replication cycle in human recipients and is therefore immunogenic similar to live virus vaccines (Gomez et al. 2013) but with safety properties resembling inactivated virus vaccines (Gilbert et al. 2006; Cebere et al. 2006; Webster et al. 2005; Stickl et al. 1974; Mayr 2003). MVA recombinants expressing different viral heterologous antigens have been tested in pre-clinical and clinical trials as candidate vaccines against infectious diseases such as AIDS, influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection (Boukhebza et al. 2012; Gilbert 2013; Gomez et al. 2011, 2012). Conventionally, MVA seed virus stocks considered for vaccine manufacturing are produced in chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) that are fully permissive for MVA. Using well-established protocols (Altenburg et al. 2014; Cotter et al. 2017), large-scale production of MVA recombinants for immunization campaigns would also have to rely on propagation in CEF (Altenburg et al. 2014). However, because supply with the primary cell cultures can be challenging for large scale manufacturing, production of MVA recombinants is being investigated for continuous suspension cell lines, such as the duck cell lines AGE1.CR and AGE1.CR.pIX (Jordan et al. 2009; Lohr et al. 2009), or the duck embryonic stem cell-derived EB66 cells (L\u00e9on et al. 2016).",

Production of influenza vaccines in the past 70 years relied on embryonated chicken eggs. Disadvantages associated with this substrate are the use of an animal-derived substrate and the potential shortage of eggs especially in case of a pandemic emergency. Recently, two cell culture-based vaccines produced either in MDCK cells or in insect cells using the baculovirus expression vector system were approved by the FDA (Buckland 2015). In addition, efficient production of influenza virus has also been shown for other suspension cell lines including Vero cells (Litwin 1992; Paillet et al. 2009), PER.C6 cells (Pau et al. 2001), HEK293 cells (Le Ru et al. 2010), EB66 cells (Brown and Mehtali 2010; White et al. 2018), and AGE1.CR as well as AGE1.CR.pIX cells (Jordan et al. 2013; Lohr et al. 2012; Lohr 2014).",

            "text": "Cell culture-derived viral vaccines are typically produced in biphasic processes. They comprise an initial cell growth phase and a virus replication phase that initiates with inoculation by seed virus. After the viral genome is amplified and viral proteins are produced, virions are assembled and progeny virus particles released (Aunins 2000). Typically, cells are first cultivated in batch mode and infected in the late exponential growth phase at concentrations in the order of 105\u2013106 cells/mL, with or without a partial exchange of culture medium (Aunins 2000; Tapia et al. 2016). Titers of wild-type MVA obtained in adherent cultures of CEF cells in serum-containing medium are in the range of 107\u2013109 infectious units (IU) per mL (Gilbert et al. 2005; Meiser et al. 2003). The avian cell lines AGE1.CR.pIX (Jordan et al. 2009; Lohr et al. 2009; Lohr 2014), EB14 (Guehenneux and Pain 2005) and EB66 (L\u00e9on et al. 2016) also yield titers in the order of 108 IU/mL but with the advantage of enabling suspension cell culture processes. However, one caveat is that these processes require induction of suspended cell aggregates for efficient replication of MVA. A novel MVA derivative, MVA-CR19, was adapted to propagation in true single-cell suspension cultures without the requirement for addition of medium to induce cell aggregation (Jordan et al. 2013).",

Processes at high cell density (HCD) allow the use of compact bioreactors with high volumetric production rates and can be adjusted to viable cell densities of 107\u2013108 per mL (Clincke et al. 2013). Such cell densities can be achieved in perfusion mode, which allows for a continuous addition of fresh medium and removal of toxic by-products (such as lactate and ammonium) while retaining cells in the bioreactor using different retention systems. The production of recombinant proteins in perfusion is typically performed at high-medium exchange rates of 1\u20133 media volumes per reactor volume per day (1/day) or 0.05\u20130.5 nL/(cell \u00d7 day) (Konstantinov et al. 2006). To maintain cultures in a proliferative state at constant high cell densities, a controlled and continuous removal of cells from the bioreactor is performed, the so-called \u201ccell bleed\u201d (Clincke et al. 2013; Desch\u00eanes et al. 2006; Hiller et al. 1993). Novel cultivation strategies such as n-1 perfusion/high-seed fed-batch (Yang et al. 2014), concentrated fed-batch (FB) (Yang et al. 2016), and hybrid perfusion FB (Hiller et al. 2017) have been developed to minimize media use while maintaining cell-specific and volumetric productivities as well as guaranteeing consistent product quality.",

            "text": "Several improvements were reported for the HCD production of influenza A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) virus. Cultivations were performed in perfusion cultures for both cell and virus propagation phases using an acoustic filter (Petiot et al. 2011) or an alternating tangential flow (ATF) system for cell retention (Genzel et al. 2014). The perfusion systems differed in the partitioning of the virus. Whereas the acoustic filter allowed a continuous virus harvest, ATF systems with membrane pores sizes < 0.5 \u03bcm retained most released viral particles in the bioreactor. In addition, the continuous permeate flow through the hollow fiber membrane resulted in product losses due to unspecific binding or membrane fouling by entrapment of cellular debris and virus particles within the membrane pores (Genzel et al. 2014). Although cell-specific virus yields comparable to conventional batch processes were obtained for both cell retention systems, the volumetric productivity (the amount of virus per volume of medium spent and time) was lower (Genzel et al. 2014). This strategy would therefore be less competitive because of the increased cost of goods (COGs) for its implementation in large-scale (Pollock et al. 2013). In an attempt to produce MVA virus (MVA-CR19 strain) at high concentrations in AGE1.CR.pIX cells (5 \u00d7 107 cells/mL), perfusion using a medium free of animal-derived components was implemented (Vazquez-Ramirez et al. 2018). This method resulted in virus retention and yielded lower cell-specific and volumetric productivities compared to conventional cell density cultivations. A detailed analysis of several cultivation strategies in shake flasks demonstrated that a FB phase followed by a daily medium exchange of 90% can result in an improvement of both cell-specific yield and volumetric productivity, even surpassing conventional cell density processes performed as a control (Vazquez-Ramirez et al. 2018). While shake flask experiments are essential for the characterization of production processes, they are insufficient for establishing strategies for large-scale manufacturing of vaccines.",

These were also in accordance with the target values of 0.06 nL/(cell \u00d7 day) and 0.026 1/h. In contrast to the Hybrid 1 cultivation, the cell suspension was concentrated twofold before infection by reducing the working volume to 0.3 L (Fig. 1d), and one reactor volume was exchanged with fresh medium. This procedure shortened the cell growth phase to 2 days and obviated discarding half of the volume of the produced cell suspension (Fig. 1e). Afterwards, the already described hybrid strategy was applied. The on-line VCV monitoring implemented in Hybrid 2 correlated well with off-line measurements up to late stages of the MVA virus propagation phase (Fig. 1e). This demonstrated the robustness of on-line capacitance measurements when the VCD exceeds 40 \u00d7 106 cells/mL, and expanded measurement to stages where virus-induced cell damage and apoptosis are widely spread within the infected cell population. In general, both the manually controlled CSPR during the cell growth and the hybrid strategy applied during virus propagation prevented the glucose limitation and the excessive accumulation of lactate (Fig. 1f).",

For Hybrid 1, the virus particles were harvested using the same ATF hollow fiber module (0.65 \u03bcm pore size) as in the cell growth phase, whereas for Hybrid 2 a 0.2-\u03bcm module was used during the cell growth phase and replaced by a new 0.65-\u03bcm module for perfusion and virus harvest at 36 hpi. The relatively low virus harvest observed in Hybrid 1 (Fig. 2a) suggested that membrane fouling might have occurred during the cell growth phase. Nevertheless, a similar maximum virus titer, cell-specific yield, and volumetric productivity were obtained compared to the reference process in shake flasks (Table 2, F + D), which involved daily harvesting of virus (Vazquez-Ramirez et al. 2018). Even more significant is the more than tenfold increase in both the cell-specific yield and the volumetric productivity of Hybrid 1 compared to the use of only perfusion during virus propagation (Table 2, Perfusion) (Vazquez-Ramirez et al. 2018). Given the suboptimal virus harvesting for Hybrid 1, the product collected in the permeate was not considered for the calculation of the cell-specific yield and the volumetric productivity.",

This is in agreement with previous reports (Jordan et al. 2013; Vazquez-Ramirez et al. 2018). Changing the hollow fiber module during the virus production phase enabled a quantitative harvest of virus particles from the supernatant only during the first 12 h of perfusion (i.e., 36\u201348 hpi) (Fig. 2b). From 48 hpi, the virus particle concentration in the permeate decreased considerably with respect to the apparent virus content in the culture supernatant. The virus titer in the permeate reached 1 \u00d7 106 IU/mL at 72 hpi, when the maximum virus titer of 1 \u00d7 1010 IU/mL was reached in the culture supernatant (Fig. 2b). A further decrease in the permeate virus concentration to 1 \u00d7 105 IU/mL was observed up to 120 hpi, while the titer in the bioreactor remained almost stable in the order of 109 IU/mL (Fig. 2b). Similar to the Hybrid 1 cultivation, these observations suggest significant membrane fouling at 48 hpi (24 h after begin of perfusion), preceding the most productive period of the virus propagation phase that occurs 48\u201372 hpi (Fig. 2b). This phase also coincides with a fast drop of cell viability and, very likely, with increasing in cell lysis. The resulting massive accumulation of cell debris and the aggregation of MVA-CR19 viral particles (200\u2013400 nm) may eventually have led to the obstruction of the ATF membrane (0.65 \u03bcm nominal pore size). Maximum titers were reached 72 hpi, and infectious virions appeared to remain stable in the supernatants and as well in the total cell lysates, as no obvious decay in titers was observed up to 120 hpi (Fig. 2b).",

Similar to the Hybrid 1 variant, a very low amount of product was collected in the permeate line and, therefore, was neglected for the calculations of the cell-specific yield and the volumetric productivity. The reduced process time of Hybrid 2 (8.2 days) led to a twofold higher volumetric productivity compared to cultivation Hybrid 1. However, virus yields in the order of 1011 IU/(L \u00d7 day) would still be expected for a process operated at a similar time period as cultivation Hybrid 1 (10.9 days). As the cell-specific virus yields were comparable to Hybrid 1 (Table 2), the use of both strategies seems reasonable.",

However, overall volumetric productivity of these processes was higher in batch cultivations performed at conventional cell densities. The AGE1.CR cell line is the parental cell line of CR.pIX cells and has shown higher productivities for influenza A virus.

In addition, an alternative perfusion control was evaluated for the cell growth phase based on the glucose consumption, lactate accumulation, and the resulting medium acidification. To accomplish this, harvest and medium feeding pumps were activated when pH dropped to values below 7.2 and turned off when the pH increased to 7.2. Under this condition, glucose is replenished at the same time that lactate is removed from the bioreactor. This perfusion control allowed for an average CSPR of 0.119 nL/(cell \u00d7 day) (Table 1, Fig. 3a) and cell viabilities above 92% (Fig. 3b). Additionally, it enabled to maintain glucose concentrations above 10 mM (Fig. 3c), similar to a previous report in shake flasks, where the pH was controlled in a range of 7.2 \u00b1 0.2 when applying a CSPR of 0.06 L/(cell \u00d7 day) with fresh CD-U3 medium (Vazquez-Ramirez et al. 2018). Different to the HIPCOP strategy proposed by Hiller et al. (2017), which operates at glucose limitation and a lactate consumption regime in CHO cell cultivations, this strategy allowed for a perfusion control without reaching low glucose concentrations that might negatively affect the growth of CR.pIX cells.",

Despite the low medium utilization, the average cell-specific growth rates for both Hybrid 1 and 2 cultivations were comparable to the 0.023 1/h achieved previously in shake flasks (Vazquez-Ramirez et al. 2018). Accordingly, it also took only about 8 days to reach a minimum VCD of 50 \u00d7 106 cells/mL. Petiot et al. (2011) reported a medium utilization of about 3.5 reactor volumes to expand HEK293 cells within 9 days from 0.25 to 15 \u00d7 106 cells/mL (before infection with influenza virus). Genzel et al. (2014) reported a medium consumption of 11.3 reactor volumes to propagate AGE1.CR cells to 50 \u00d7 106 cells/mL before infection with influenza virus. Therefore, the results here represent a significant reduction in medium consumption before virus infection, which is an important contribution towards lower COGs in large-scale production.",

In Hybrid 1 cultivation, one-half of the cell suspension (0.3 L) was removed before infection at 50 \u00d7 106 cells/mL (Fig. 1 a).This cell suspension could possibly be used to start a second bioreactor in parallel. In contrast, in the Hybrid 2 cultivation, cells were cultivated to 25 \u00d7 106 cells/mL in 0.6 L and concentrated to 50 \u00d7 106 cells/mL prior to infection (Fig. 1 d). In both cases, the subsequent FB phase required the addition of almost three times the starting volume to avoid substrate limitations. This ratio was lower than the 1:4 reported by Pohlscheidt et al. (2008) for the high-yield production of Parapoxvirus ovis at large scale, which\u2014in addition\u2014required transferring the cell suspension to a second larger bioreactor to perform the dilution steps. Since the initial FB phase of the hybrid strategy seems to be a critical operation also for MVA-CR19 virus propagation (Vazquez-Ramirez et al. 2018), further studies could focus on the development of an optimized feed medium to enable a higher starting volume (preferably 60% of the maximum working volume) and a lower maximum dilution ratio (about 2:3) to simplify the hybrid strategy for implementation in large-scale bioreactors.",

With respect to cultivations performed at conventional cell densities using CR.pIX cells (Jordan et al. 2009; Lohr et al. 2009; Lohr 2014), EB14 cells (Guehenneux and Pain 2005), and EB66 cells (L\u00e9on et al. 2016), up to tenfold higher titers were obtained. Cell-specific virus yields obtained with the hybrid strategies (410 and 352 IU/cell) were also competitive regarding the 500 IU/cell obtained with CEF cells (Carroll and Moss 1997), the 50\u2013200 IU/cell with CR.pIX cells (Lohr 2014), and the 25\u201350 IU/cell with EB66 cells (L\u00e9on et al. 2016) at conventional lower cell densities. Batch production of MVA virus with CR.pIX cells (Jordan et al. 2009; Lohr 2014) and EB66 cells (L\u00e9on et al. 2016) requires more or less the same time and the same media volumes. Accordingly, its volumetric productivity of about 2.0 \u00d7 1010 IU/(L \u00d7 day) is clearly surpassed by the 1.3 and 2.8 \u00d7 1011 IU/(L \u00d7 day) obtained with the hybrid strategy. Applying such a strategy would allow for 100,000 doses per liter of cell-free supernatant, considering that single doses of 1 \u00d7 108 PFU (1 PFU = 1 IU) per individual are currently used in clinical studies involving recombinant MVA-based vaccines (Gomez et al. 2013).",

It is promising that titers were found to remain stable from 72 to 120 hpi (Fig. 2b). This suggests a low virus inactivation rate for the specific cultivation conditions chosen. While continuous virus harvesting failed for the chosen ATF system, the use of other cell retention devices including acoustic filter and settlers might be evaluated again for large-scale production to avoid product losses. One major property of the MVA-CR19 virus, its capacity to propagate in true single-cell suspension cultures, may additionally help to facilitate the recovery of infectious units directly from the culture supernatant without the need of cell disruption (Jordan et al. 2013). The Hybrid 2 cultivation showed that the maximum titer at 72 hpi accounted entirely for virus in the supernatant (Fig. 2b) with most of the cells showing a viability > 70%. Hence, a clarification step at this point with a carefully chosen cell retention system would suffice to recover the MVA-CR19 virus from the bioreactor. Based on the very high performance of the hybrid strategy in upstream processing and further options to reduce costs in downstream processing, it can be assumed that higher costs related to the implementation of \u201ccomplex\u201d perfusion processes (purchase of dedicated equipment and training of staff) can be more than compensated even at industrial scale.",

Similar to the Hybrid 2 process for MVA-CR19 virus, on-line VCV estimations correlated well with off-line measurements up to late stages of the influenza A virus propagation phase (Fig. 3b). No glucose limitation nor significant lactate accumulation was observed for the pH-based perfusion control during the cell growth phase (Fig. 3c). The high average CSPR of 0.119 nL/(cell \u00d7 day) (Table 1, Fig. 3a) obtained in the cell growth phase led to an increase in medium consumption (16.7 reactor volumes) compared to the reference perfusion process (3.9 reactor volumes).

In case conventional batch production processes are already established, the implementation of HCD strategies can significantly increase manufacturing capacities, e.g., in emerging and developing countries where vaccines are most urgently needed. A possible solution using a hybrid FB/perfusion strategy during the virus production phase for MVA and influenza A virus in small stirred tank bioreactors is described here. The application of this strategy resulted in a 7- to 20-fold increase in virus titers without compromising cell-specific yields and volumetric productivities that often hinder the establishment of intensified processes. The high titers of 1010 IU/mL obtained for MVA virus demonstrated, in particular, the potential of this approach as an alternative to the current technology that relies on primary chicken embryo fibroblasts as a substrate. The results achieved here for the two different viruses may be also instructive for modernization of conventional approaches in viral vaccine production.",
