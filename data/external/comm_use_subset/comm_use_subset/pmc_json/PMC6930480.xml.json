            "text": "AMP ectodomain is composed of four sub-domains (I\u2013IV) with the three N-terminal domains (I\u2013III) being evolutionary conserved [4]. Particularly, sub-domain-II houses the highly conserved active site with the zinc-binding motif HEXXHX18 and GXMEN catalytic motifs, which has common mechanistic features with thermolysins and other peptidases [5]. Human and porcine AMP ectodomains share 79% of residue identity, together with the same domain architecture and dimerization pattern [2]. Human/porcine aminopeptidase proposed mechanism of action involves the peptide bond hydrolysis in two steps (illustrated in Figure 1 and based on the literature [6,7]). The first step involves proton abstraction from the water molecule, coordinated with the catalytic Zn2+ and stabilized Glu350 (not depicted in Figure 1), by the Glu384, which then allows the substrate entrance. The carbonyl oxygen of the substrate\u2019s peptide bond is activated by zinc and Tyr472, while the alpha-nitrogen is stabilized by the Ala348 main-chain oxygen, in an intermediate state. As a last step, the peptide bond is hydrolyzed, by the catalytic water attack on the carbonyl carbon of the peptide bond, while the Glu384 shuttles a proton from the catalytic water to the leaving nitrogen group (Figure 1). Such a coordinated mechanism heavily relies in protonation state of individual residues, as shown by the work of Chen et al., 2014, where the porcine AMP loses activity in high pH solutions (likely due to the deprotonation of Tyr472) and in very low pH (due to the protonation of Glu384) [6,7].",

Specifically, the relevance of AMP as a drug target against cancer has been supported by its role in promoting angiogenesis, tumor growth, and metastasis [8,9]. AMP overexpression on neovasculature of certain tumor cells, such as thyroid carcinomas and myeloid, also justify the drug discovery efforts [10,11,12] and, in this sense, aminopeptidase inhibitors have been considered potential targets for cancer therapy [13]. Furthermore, antitumor drugs, which bind to AMP site, are currently being evaluated in clinical trials [14,15]. Among the comprehensive list of AMP inhibitors (reviewed by Amin et al., 2018 [16]), amastatin (Figure 2A) figures as a slow-binding, competitive inhibitor, from which the hydroxyl group/carbonyl system contributes to interaction with Zn2+ ion and, therefore, complex stabilization mimicking the transition state and chelating the catalytic ion. Other peptide-mimetics, both synthetic and from natural sources can also be employed as AMP inhibitors.",

Overall, the active site pocket has a D-score of 1.16 on the SiteMap predictions (Schr\u00f6dinger Inc, implemented in Maestro Drug Discovery Suite 2019), which is consistent with other validated drug targets [22]. AMP active site has several points likely to have hydrogen bond interactions (Figure 3D\u2013E), which highlights the role of hydration within this active site. However, comparatively, there are less hydrophobic interactions (Figure 3C), mainly within a specific pocket composed by Ala346, Phe467 and Phe893. This back-pocket could be exploited for selectivity. Phe893 have been previously described as involved in the big conformational changes of AMP activation, from an open and receptive towards a closed and active conformation [1,2]. It was suggested that Phe893 would hinder the peptide release after the hydrolysis, despite the long distance apart from the active site (4.5 A\u00b0 away from the Zn2+).",

Amastatin ligand co-crystallized with the human aminopeptidase structure (PDB ID: 4FYT, hAMP) was used as the basis for cross-docking validation. The root means square deviation (RMSD) differences between the best-scored docking pose and the ligand coordinates from the crystal were employed as initial quality criteria (1.9 \u00c5 [25]). However, due to big conformational differences between the hAMP and pAMP, only cross-docking was not sufficient to evaluate docking quality. Therefore, the observation of important interactions, such as the distance towards the zinc ion (3.9 \u00c5), further supported the use of docking, which was also analyzed by molecular dynamics simulations. The proposed binding mode involves hydrogen bond between amastatin\u2019s hydroxyl group with the side-chain of the Glu406 residue, which is responsible for the Zn-binding domain along with His383 and His387. Based on the simulation results, we hypothesize that amastatin interaction with Glu450 could help with the initial orientation the coordination of the vicinal carbonyl/hydroxyl pair in a conformation that stably interacts the Glu406/His383/His387/Zn2+ complex.",

The twin tyrosine residues from microginins are longer and uncharged substituents to the double charged moieties of amastatin, it is observed that those residues are highly flexible and are not restricted to a single binding mode within the binding site (Figure 7A and Figure 8A, highlighting the hydrogen interaction profile), however, longer simulations would be required to understand the full effect of this in the protein dynamics. The crystal structure of hAPN (PDB ID 4FYS) co-crystallized with AngIV substrate peptide shows poorly fitting electron density and high-temperature factors for the last three amino acids (His-Pro-Phe residues and occupying the pockets P3\u2032\u2013P5\u2032), as well as for the amastatin\u2019s second amino-acid (Leu\u00dfN, PBD 4FYT); those are in line with highly disordered regions and fit to our increasingly RMSF values along the molecule (Figure 7A).

Simulations with the ionized amine state of MG756 shows increased ligand flexibility on Ahda atoms (Figure 7A), which would interact with the active site, but also overall binding instability. However, the same is not observed in MG770 ionized simulations. We hypothesize that the additional charge on MG756 could prevent the conjugation with Zn2+, despite the additional electrostatic interaction with the Glu450, which was not stable during simulations (Figure 8E). Furthermore, amastatin isopropyl moiety proximity with specific side-chains (Figure 6D) reveals a small unoccupied hydrophobic pocket composed by Phe467 and Phe893 (with distances larger than 5 \u00c5), which accommodates the larger microginin\u2019s acyl substituent (Figure 8B).

However, just molecular size cannot explain the differences in inhibition. Comparatively, the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, another member of the aminopeptidase family with the similar catalytic domain and zinc ion as a cofactor, shows an inverse correlation between molecular volume and activity [29,30,31]. As observed by the SiteMap analyses (Figure 3E), the closed conformation of the pAMP active site have small contributions of hydrophobic residues and, therefore, the insertion of a methyl group (increasing hydrophobicity), could be deleterious, when not addressing proper pockets. Controversially, the amino-ionized forms of MG770 maintained stable interactions with residues around the Zn2+ ion, whereas the MG756 equivalent does not. Recently, the work from Lodin-Friedman and Carmeli (2018) demonstrated the activity of other microginins, purified from Microcystis spp. collected from the Kishon Reservoir in Israel, against the porcine aminopeptidase M [32]. Those new microginins differ among themselves not only in terms of sequence, but also in absolute configuration of the Ahda moieties\u2019 chiral centers, and also on the N-methylation of the Ahda amine group (Ahda stands for the modified amino acid 3-amino-(2-hydroxy)-decenoid acid). They conclude that Ahda-N-methylation, and even the chlorination of the Ahda terminal methyl group, did not influence the extent of the aminopeptidase M inhibition, which is in line with our observations that apolar groups would not lead to inactivity.",

The simulation was performed under the NPT ensemble for 5 ns implementing the Berendsen thermostat and barostat methods. A constant temperature of 310 K was maintained throughout the simulation using the Nose-Hoover thermostat algorithm and Martyna-Tobias-Klein Barostat algorithm to maintain 1 atm of pressure, respectively. After minimization and relaxation of the system, we proceeded with a single production step of 100 ns. The representative structure was selected by clustering the structures from the RSMD values, using 1 \u00c5 as a cut-off (Supplementary material, Figure S2 represents the variation of the RMSD values along with the simulation and the RMSF variation for the protein backbone, on Figure S3), small RMSF variation between the simulated systems was observed, this could be justified by the short simulated time, which allows for the observation of small time-scale events, but not big protein conformational changes. In this sense, simulations were used only to validate the initial docking results and evaluate the ligand stability within the protein active site. Interactions and distances were determined using the Simulation Event Analysis pipeline implemented in Maestro (Maestro 2019v2). The current geometric criteria for protein-ligand H-bond is distance of 2.5 \u00c5 between the donor and acceptor atoms (D\u2014H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7A); a donor angle of \u2265120\u00b0 between the donor-hydrogen-acceptor atoms (D\u2014H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7A); and an acceptor angle of \u226590\u00b0 between the hydrogen-acceptor-bonded atom atoms (H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7A\u2014X). Similarly, protein-water or water-ligand H-bond are a distance of 2.8 \u00c5 between the donor and acceptor atoms (D\u2014H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7A); a donor angle of \u2265110\u00b0 between the donor-hydrogen-acceptor atoms (D\u2014H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7A); and an acceptor angle of \u226590\u00b0 between the hydrogen-acceptor-bonded atom atoms (H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7A\u2014X). Non-specific hydrophobic interactions are defined by hydrophobic side-chain within 3.6 \u00c5 of a ligand\u2019s aromatic or aliphatic carbons and \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions required two aromatic groups stacked face-to-face or face-to-edge, within 4.5 \u00c5 of distance. Trajectories and interaction data are available on Zenodo repository (under the code: 10.5281/zenodo.3458133)",
