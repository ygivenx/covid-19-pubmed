M. pneumoniae infections develop in persons of all ages, especially in children and teenagers [4]. M. pneumoniae infections range clinically from mild, self-limiting respiratory symptoms to radiographically confirmed pneumonia in an estimated 30% of cases [5]. In rare cases, M. pneumoniae can cause extrapulmonary manifestations, including neurologic, dermatologic, hematologic and cardiac syndromes which can result in hospitalization and death [6, 7]. Macrolide antibiotics are commonly used drugs for the treatment of M. pneumoniae infection. With the widespread or inappropriate use of antibiotic, macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae (MRMP) has become an emerging threat worldwide [8\u201310]. In recent years, MRMP has become very serious in Asia [11\u201314].",

MRMP strain has been identified in some pneumonia outbreaks in recent years [10, 17]. In China, M. pneumoniae infection is not a notifiable disease, most patients infected with MP are seldom symptomatic, patients rarely seek medical attention, and the clinical syndrome overlaps with other pneumonia etiologies, so the M. pneumoniae infection prevalence in the community was widely underestimated. However, several recent outbreaks of M. pneumoniae infections among children and adults have been reported, and macrolide-resistant strains have emerged [18, 19].",
