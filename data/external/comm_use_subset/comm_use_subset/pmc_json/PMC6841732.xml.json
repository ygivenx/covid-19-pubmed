            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified in 2012 from a pneumonic patient who subsequently died in Saudi Arabia. Since its emergence, the virus has infected more than 2200 individuals in 27 countries1. Outbreaks occurred mainly in the Arabian Peninsula in large crowded hospitals with one large outbreak in the Republic of Korea2. Although bats have been proposed as a possible natural reservoir of the virus3, dromedary camels are the only confirmed animal host so far. More than half (54.9%) of human primary cases have reported contact with camels4 and the index patient in the Korean outbreak travelled back from the Gulf countries where MERS-CoV is endemic and circulating in dromedary camels5. Several studies of camels showed 74\u2013100% seroprevalence rates of MERS-CoV in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula6\u201310. The mean seroprevalence was higher in older camels than juvenile ones9. Furthermore, dromedary serum samples collected between 1983 and 2010 and archived in different countries in Africa and Arabia tested positive for MERS-CoV neutralising antibodies (nAbs)11\u201316. Moreover, a recent study in Saudi Arabia showed that 70% (n = 584) of dromedaries associated with confirmed human cases were seropositive with viral RNA being isolated from 12% of these dromedaries5,17. Importantly, sequencing the viral RNA from both patients and their camels confirmed genetic similarity in every paired case5,17. Therefore, it seems clear that MERS-CoV has been circulating in dromedaries in Africa and Arabia for the past three decades and has been causing human infections since 2012. Unlike the Arabian countries, there have been no reports of human cases in Africa, which could be due to under-diagnosis or differences in camel husbandry practices. One study has recently demonstrated that the virus in Africa may be genetically and phenotypically distinct18.",

In camels, the MERS-CoV infection is mild, transient and does not require veterinary care. There is therefore little encouragement for camel owners to vaccinate their animals against MERS-CoV. However, there is an increasing body of evidence on asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic human cases amongst people who regularly have contact with camels, suggesting that these people may transmit the infection to the community4,19. Therefore, successful vaccination of camels would reduce virus circulation in this animal host and thereby reduce human exposure, leading to a reduction in the number of human cases. In addition, developing a vaccine for humans and vaccinating humans at risk, such as camel keepers and health care workers, would further control the number of human infections and prevent the spread of the virus to the general population. The same vaccine may be developed for use in both camels and humans.",

It consists of a receptor-binding domain (RBD)-containing S1 subunit that binds to dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) on target cells, and a S2 subunit which contains the fusion peptide involved in viral fusion with target cells20,21. Several vaccine candidates have been developed and tested in multiple animal models including mice, rabbits, non-human primates and dromedaries (reviewed in22\u201324). While many of these vaccines were designed based on full-length S protein, some others were targeting the S1 subunit or the RBD of the protein to focus the immune response on the critical neutralising epitopes to induce nAbs. Nonetheless, non-neutralising antibodies (Abs) could also aid in protection against MERS-CoV by inhibiting essential steps in viral replication such as virus-target cell fusion. Furthermore, it has been shown that nAbs alone could not confer sterilising immunity but could provide partial protection in camels probably due to several factors including waning of nAbs and genetic change of viral lineage25\u201329. Thus, developing a camel vaccine based on full-length S protein could potentially elicit more robust antibody and T cell response compared to shorter targets.",

The ChAdOx1 viral vector of this vaccine is replication-deficient and has been assessed in different animal models, including dromedaries33, and in human clinical trials34,35. Here, we evaluated the immunogenicity and efficacy of ChAdOx1 MERS in dromedaries that are either seropositive or seronegative for MERS-CoV. We also evaluated the age effect on vaccine immunogenicity in seronegative dromedary calves. We have for the first time utilised a natural infection model of challenge to evaluate MERS vaccine efficacy in camels in a \u2018real-world\u2019 setting rather than a single exposure to MERS-CoV in a challenge experiment conducted within biocontainment facilities. This is also the first study to evaluate a MERS vaccine in dromedaries in endemic countries.",

Interestingly, older seronegative calves (1\u20132 years) responded to a single dose of the vaccine and elicited systemic and local nAbs. As the history of MERS-CoV exposure in these camels is not known, it is possible that older camels found here to be seronegative may have had some natural exposure to MERS-CoV but their Abs had then declined prior to their inclusion in the study as reported previously25,27. Nonetheless, it is also possible that these seronegative calves were truly immune naive to MERS-CoV and that greater vaccine responsiveness occurs in older animals with a more mature immune system. It is very unlikely that maternal Abs play any part in the lack of vaccine responsiveness in younger calves because ChAdOx1 MERS is a viral vectored vaccine that does not express MERS S protein on the virion surface and so will not be affected by pre-existing Abs at the time of vaccination.",

Whereas virus shedding was minimal from seropositive vaccinated camels, further optimisation is required to enhance protection in seronegative camels including the number of doses and route of immunisation. Indeed, assessing the ability of an MVA-vectored MERS-CoV vaccine to protect camels against contained MERS-CoV challenge required administering multiple doses by both intramuscular and intranasal routes to significantly reduce virus shedding36. Therefore, protective effects of vaccine administered by either the intranasal or intramuscular route should be assessed. Of note, we show here that in older seronegative camels, nAbs in nasal secretions were induced after a single intramuscular vaccination of ChAdOx1 MERS, but cannot rule out the possibility that these camels had previously been exposed to MERS-CoV despite proving seronegative on entry to the study, and the effects of intramuscular boosting after initial mucosal priming may be different from intramuscular priming of truly MERS-naive camels. The mechanism of vaccine-mediated or naturally acquired protection against MERS-CoV in camels is not yet known and further work will be required to study T cell responses as well as the possible contribution of immunity to antigens other than the S protein. However, there is lack of commercially available dromedary antibodies against immune cell markers, making T cell immunity in camels difficult to assess appropriately.",

Even under these stringent conditions one camel in group +V demonstrated complete absence of virus shedding, with two others (out of a total of 5) in the same group shedding extremely low levels of virus, indicating that high levels of protective immunity can be achieved. Importantly, this group had high level of nAbs that plateaued for a year, unlike the +C group that had decreasing nAb titres overtime. These results suggest that vaccinating seropositive camels with S-based vaccine could boost their pre-existing MERS-specific immunity and minimise viral shedding. Nonetheless, following single dose vaccination, virus shedding was reduced in both seropositive and seronegative camels, which would reduce the likelihood of transmission to other camels or humans.",

Nonetheless, non-neutralising S-specific Abs could also interfere with MERS-CoV entry and fusion in a similar manner to stem-specific anti-influenza hemagglutinin Abs38, but this has not yet been assessed for MERS-CoV. Similarly, S1-based ELISA have shown excellent correlation with live virus neutralization assay although both nAbs as well as non-neutralising binding Abs could be detected by ELISA39,40. In the current study, we found that induction of S1-binding non-neutralising Abs alone is insufficient to reduce viral shedding and only the presence of nAbs can minimise virus excretion. Nonetheless, previous studies suggest that only presence of high levels on nAb titres may provide sterilising immunity in dromedaries as even seropositive camels could be re-infected as nAbs wane over time25\u201328.

Endpoint titres of serum Abs were also determined using an in-house indirect ELISA as previously described43,44. Briefly, 96-well Nunc ELISA plates (Thermo Scientific, USA) coated with 50 \u03bcl/well of 1 \u03bcg/ml of recombinant S1 protein (IVI, Seoul, Korea) overnight, were washed and blocked for 1 h. Then, 50 \u03bcl/well from each serum sample was added in duplicates in a 3-fold serial dilution starting from a 1:100. After 1 h of incubation, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-llama IgG (Agrisera, USA) were added at 1:3000 dilution. Finally, p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate (pNPP) (Sigma Aldrich, Germany) was used for colour development and the OD was measured at 405 nm. The endpoint titre for each tested serum was determined as the reciprocal value of the serum dilution with OD value converging with the cut-off determined as the average OD of a seronegative camel serum plus 3 SD as described previously. The fold increase in Ab titres was calculated by dividing titres from each time point over the titre of the same camel on day 0, pre-vaccination titre (0 d.p.i.).",

First, a mixed model for repeated measures design of the log-transformed MERS-CoV GE (TCID50/ml) values was employed to account for the covariance among repeated measures and assess the change in virus titres over time. Virus titres in all animals (subjects) were measured daily (equally spaced time points), the within-subject association among the repeated measures is modelled by assuming a first-order autoregressive correlation structure matrix. The same analysis model was also applied on the nasal discharge scores collected over time (from 1 to 14 days post challenge). Next, areas under the curve (AUC) of log-transformed MERS-CoV GE (TCID50/ml) values and nasal discharge scores collected from 1 to 14 d.p.c. for the two experimental groups (vaccinated and control) across the two conditions of seropositivity status (seropositive and seronegative) was reported. This analysis was conducted to display whether there are differences in virus titres nasal discharge scores between groups; it also includes Cohen\u2019s f2 test, which is a standardised measure of effect size, ensuring the suitability of our study sample size for the statistical testing that we performed, see Supplementary statistic file.
