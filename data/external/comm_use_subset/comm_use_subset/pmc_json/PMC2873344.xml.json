            "text": "To date, cDNA microarray and quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) have become the most important and reliable tools to study differential gene expression in fish, where species-specific antibodies are scarce. Although qRT-PCR combines advantages of specificity, sensitivity, speed, throughput and reproducibility over conventional methods an accurate normalization of data is fully required [1]. Errors in the quantification of mRNA transcripts arise from any variation in the amount of starting material between samples. A common strategy to overcome this problem is to simultaneously amplify a non-regulated housekeeping gene with those targeted to allow quantitative normalization of the experimental cDNA inputs. However, it has also been demonstrated that expression levels of these genes may vary considerably depending on cell types, tissues, experimental treatments and even under different diseases [2]. Moreover, the use of a single reference gene for normalization is nowadays discouraged by an increasing number of authors [3-5]. Consequently, it is highly necessary to validate their constitutive expression for a particular experimental setting and therefore a crucial component when assessing a new model [6].",

We are currently developing SYBR Green based real-time assays for studying the host immune response influenced by the infection with the facultative bacterium Piscirickettsia salmonis and with the IPNV, respectively. The in vitro models CHSE-214 (an epithelial-like embryo cell line derived from Chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawitscha) and RTS11 (monocyte/macrophage-like cell line derived from rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss) have been of great help for this purpose because they have been shown to be susceptible to a wide range of viral infections [7,8] and to P. salmonis [9,10]. The potential reference genes we have examined are beta-actin (ACTB), elongation factor 1-alpha (EF1A) and glyceraldehyd-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), which have been previously validated in several studies on diverse fish species including salmonids [11-13], and ubiquitin (UBQ) and tubulin alpha (TUBA), which have been reported for fish species like the three-spine-stickelback (Gasterosteus aculeatus [14]) and zebrafish (Danio rerio [15]), but not in salmonids. The five housekeeping genes were selected based on their previous use as internal controls for gene expression studies, the availability of housekeeping gene sequences for salmonids and related teleost species, and because they have roles in different cellular functions (Table 1), thus reducing the likelihood that they exhibited regulated covariation.",

In agreement with several other studies on teleosts, GAPDH was one of the least stable genes in our panel [13,15,28]. In mammals GAPDH was shown to be influenced by a large number of physiological states and to play a role in a broad range of cellular mechanisms [29]. GAPDH expression was increasingly upregulated in RTS11 cells infected with P. salmonis and was slightly upregulated over 48 h in both control and IPNV-treated CHSE-214 cultures. This regulation on non-infected cells was not perceptible in the long-term experiment with P. salmonis or in the assays with RTS11. Schmitten and Zakrajsek [30] demonstrated that the addition of serum to serum-starved human fibroblast cultures increased the mRNA amount for GAPDH. Although in our experiments, cells were maintained in a low serum concentration (5% fetal bovine serum), the addition of fresh media prior to infection could stimulate slightly the expression of GAPDH in the first few hours. Therefore, an important point to consider during the selection of a reference gene is whether expression could be eventually regulated by other factors than the challenge self. This differential regulation in the reference gene could lead to over- or sub-estimations of target gene expression. As well, TUBA showed increased expression over 48 h in both control and IPNV-infected CHSE-214 cultures, while in infected RTS11 cultures, TUBA was downregulated. Then, TUBA gene expression was influenced by IPNV infection but the direction of the influence depended on the cell type.",

Phase contrast microscope appearance of cultures of CHSE-214 (top row) and RTS11 (bottom row) after the addition of either Piscirickettsia salmonis (middle column) or IPNV (right column). The cytopathic effect is seen as morphological changes (arrows) and as homotypic aggregation [highlighted by a box] in the case of RTS11 and P. salmonis. In CHSE-214 cultures, P. salmonis infection displayed the characteristic vacuolisation of cells. This CPE was visible in small groups of cells as early as three days after infection. Five days post-infection, vacuolisation was extended to approximately 40% of the population and nine days later around 80% displayed CPE. At this point some cells were detaching from the monolayer. In contrast to CHSE-214, RTS11 showed no evidence of vacuolization after infection, but homotypic aggregation of these monocyte-like cells became perceptible as infection advanced. Significant cell death and lysis took place at least 12 days post-infection. IPNV infection was evidenced by rounding up and blebbing of the plasma membrane in CHSE-214 cultures. As infection advanced, apoptotic bodies could be seen. Two days post-infection, over 50% of the population displayed CPE. For RTS11 cultures, strong homotypic aggregation became apparent 24 h post-infection followed by significant morphological changes such as plasma blebbing.",
