            "text": "Research in contextEvidence before this studyWe searched PubMed for all original research articles published in English or Chinese between Jan 1, 1997, and Dec 31, 2015, using the search term \u201c([maternal mortality]) AND China\u201d. Of 603 papers identified, 22 empirically addressed maternal health and health-care issues at the regional or national level or inequalities in access to maternal care across socioeconomic groups. Results from these studies confirmed the substantial decline in maternal mortality in China over the past 20 years and also showed the persistent gap between the eastern, central, and western regions. Factors such as educational achievements, household income, traditions, and geographical access were found to be determinants of uptake of hospital delivery care. However, no study provided a systematic analysis of the health systems inputs and outputs that might explain the regional variation in maternal mortality in China, and no study examined inequalities in access to maternal health care among the poorest population groups.Added value of this studyWe used the standard framework developed by Countdown to 2015's Health Systems and Policies Working Group to examine the health systems and contextual factors that might have contributed to the substantial decline in maternal mortality between 1997 and 2014. We took advantage of a unique data source on the maternal mortality ratio collected by the Chinese National Health and Family Planning Commission from 1997 to 2014 for all 31 provinces in China and a population-based survey in 42 poor counties in western China in 2011. We examined equity in access along the continuum of care among women and children in rural western China to inform strategies for further improvements in maternal health in the region, as well as time trends and regional variation in maternal mortality ratio between 1997 and 2014.Implications of the available evidenceMany countries can learn lessons from China's remarkable improvement in maternal survival. Central to China's progress has been a firm commitment from the Government to long-term strategies to ensure access to delivery care in health facilities, with a strong focus on the professionalisation of maternity care in large hospitals, effective referral systems for women at high risk, and financial subsidies for antenatal and delivery care. The Chinese Government was also able to implement its policies with enough authority and accountability to make professional delivery care accessible to all women. As China is on the road to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, attention now needs to be paid to the unmet need of those not yet able to access care: the poor, less educated, and ethnic minority groups in remote areas in western China.",

We chose to focus on western China, a region where poverty, ethnic diversity, and geographical access represent particular challenges to ensuring universal access to maternal care. We also examined equity in access along the continuum of care among women and children in rural western China, so as to inform strategies for further improvements in maternal health in the region. Equity in access is important, not only because aggregate geographical data can hide individual variation, but also because China is the only Countdown country that does not report individual socioeconomic variation along the continuum of care in its Countdown profile.1",

The survey also included a census of all health institutions providing maternal and child health care in the 42 counties, including information on the number of obstetric care providers, capability for providing basic or comprehensive emergency obstetric care,20 and capability for providing emergency newborn care.

The model included fixed effects for region and time, with a random intercept for each province. The model calculated the mean of the log maternal mortality ratio within each region, and results from the model (coefficients) were then exponentiated to obtain the geometric mean ratio, which was used as the measure of change so that the assumption of linearity was fulfilled. The geometric mean ratio estimates should be interpreted as the proportional change in the maternal mortality ratio, so a value of 1 indicates no difference between groups and a value of less than 1 indicates a decrease in the maternal mortality ratio. For instance, if a region has a maternal mortality ratio of 100 per 100 000 livebirths and an estimated geometric mean ratio of 0\u00b780 per year, then this would indicate a 20% decrease in the maternal mortality ratio each year. Data from Tibet were excluded from the model because maternal mortality was substantially higher than that in any other province and thus not compatible with the assumptions of the random-effects model. The following health systems and contextual factors were considered for inclusion in the adjusted model: GDP per capita, length of highways, female illiteracy, proportion of ethnic minority population, crude birth rate, total tax revenue, government health expenditure per capita, the number of licensed doctors per 1000 population, and hospital beds per 1000 population. Covariates were selected by using a threshold of p=0\u00b705 and by considering the effect on the region coefficients. To investigate different time trends in each of the regions, we fitted the model described above with an interaction between region and time. We imputed missing data for ethnic minority population for each province in 2014 using data from 2013. For provinces that did not report data on ethnic minority population in the statistical yearbook, we imputed data from the 2010 census.",

The programme was effective in reducing maternal mortality through the enhancement of hospital delivery.28 In 2009 the programme was nationalised to ensure free hospital delivery for all women in China.29 The programme was funded mainly by the central government with some financial inputs from provincial governments. Equity was an important focus: in 2009, the central government provided 80% of the funds for the poorest provinces but only 10% for the richest provinces. In total, the central government invested nearly \u00a52\u00b75 billion (US$1=\u00a56\u00b731 in 2012) in the programme in 2000\u201312.30",

Second, a fast channel referral system for pregnant women who were either medically or socially at risk was introduced (appendix p 10). Medical risk factors included young age (<18 years) or old age (>35 years), previous stillbirth, anaemia, and previous caesarean section, and women were considered socially at risk if they lived far from the hospital or had no family support at home (eg, no husband or the husband was working elsewhere). Responsibility for the referral system lay with the highest administrative authority within the county (usually the director of the health bureau). All women screened as high risk by the village doctor or township hospital staff were informed about when and which hospital to go to before the expected date of birth. Women in emergency situations were offered transport, and once they arrived in hospital, designated staff ensured that prompt care was given. Third, specific standards and basic requirements for hospitals at the county and township levels were introduced. For example, township hospitals were only authorised to provide vaginal deliveries, whereas county hospitals were also authorised to perform caesarean sections. Fourth, financial subsidies were provided to encourage women in rural areas to give birth in hospital (see below). Fifth, accredited medical specialists from prefecture or provincial facilities were sent to county and township hospitals to provide supervision and training to doctors. Finally, township and village doctors were responsible for providing health education to pregnant women and their families. Doctors put up posters in villages and worked with village cadres to advocate for safe birth, which included specifying under what circumstances the family should take a pregnant woman to the hospital.",

Since then, major health sector reforms\u2014particularly the expansion of health insurance schemes for both rural and urban residents\u2014have reduced exposure to out-of-pocket payments through greater health financing from government tax revenue and social health insurance contributions. (appendix p 12). The rural New Cooperative Medical Scheme was introduced in 2003 in response to increasing rates of impoverishment due to health service user charges.38 The main objective of the scheme is to provide universal coverage and to improve equity and access to health care to the rural population. It is a voluntary insurance scheme funded from a mix of flat-rate household contributions and subsidies from the central and local governments.38 This scheme operates at the county level, with different counties having different designs and benefit packages.38, 39 According to the 2012 Report on the Work of the Chinese Government,40 the scheme had covered 832 million rural residents, or 97\u00b75% of Chinese farmers, by 2012. This high level of participation has partly been attributed to government efforts to encourage participation and to features in the design of the scheme to avoid adverse selection (such as compulsory enrolment of all members in a household).38 The government contribution to the insurance premium increased from \u00a510 per person in 2003 to \u00a5380 per person in 2015. The New Cooperative Medical Scheme has resulted in increased use of village clinics and inpatient and outpatient services.38, 39 Despite the expansion of social health insurance, medical care expenditure has continued to represent a great proportion of total household spending, with substantial variation in total and out-of-pocket health expenditure across provinces. For example, per-capita health spending is four times greater in Beijing than in Guizhou. Perhaps surprisingly, in view of the regional disparities in health outcomes, health expenditure is greater in the eastern provinces and only slightly less in central provinces than in western provinces (figure 1). Moreover, with the exception of Tibet, western provinces seem equally reliant on out-of-pocket expenditure as a source of health financing as the rest of the country.",

Out-of-pocket expenditure on antenatal care was low, reflecting the fact that households received free care for the first five visits under the national basic public health programme. Second, although variation existed by education level of the mother, the least educated women still faced high costs of delivery care. Third, caesarean sections were much more expensive than vaginal deliveries. These findings are broadly consistent with older data available for the whole of China.41",

Five factors confounded the association between region and maternal mortality: GDP per capita, length of highways, female illiteracy, the number of licensed doctors per 1000 population, and the proportion of ethnic minorities. All p values in the final model were p<0\u00b705 except for the proportion of ethnic minorities (p=0\u00b7055), but it had a large effect on the coefficients for region.

            "text": "No other country has seen an expansion of facility-based births at this rate or scale, and the comprehensive policies and programmes underpinning China's facility-based strategy, particularly in rural areas, are worth spelling out. First, births are increasingly concentrated in large, well staffed, and well equipped county hospitals, whereas smaller township hospitals focus on antenatal care and screening of women at high risk. This concentration of births in high-volume facilities ensures an efficient organisation of obstetric care, including training, supervision, and the maintenance of skills. Second, the huge investment in human resources has resulted in a density of licensed doctors that is close to the 2\u00b75 per 1000 population threshold that is deemed necessary by UN health agencies to achieve a high coverage of skilled attendants at birth.59 China does not officially have a midwifery cadre, but the doctors and nurses who routinely attend deliveries are effectively the so-called midwifery workforce.60, 61 Although the level of training is variable and many providers only have a basic medical or nursing degree,62 the strict system of birth attendant certification ensures that most staff have the minimum skills to ensure safe childbirth. Third, an effective referral system ensures that women developing unexpected complications or those found to be at high risk antenatally can reach the hospital in time and receive a timely response once admitted. Screening for social and medical factors allows women without family support to go to hospital before labour starts\u2014effectively a maternity waiting home strategy.63 Fourth, financial barriers have been reduced through a system of social health insurance and extra childbirth subsidies in remote parts of the country. Antenatal care has also been recognised as one of the essential public health services that should be free at the point of care. Fifth, the Chinese Government's commitment to rigorous health information systems across the country has ensured that most child and maternal deaths are counted.64 Such a reporting system not only enables direction and evaluation of ongoing strategies, but also provides a mechanism to hold health-care providers and administrators accountable. Responsibility for maternal health lies with the highest authorities within the province or county, and achieving a specified maternal mortality target is one of the key performance indicators for government officials.",

            "text": "We focused our analysis on western China because its relative poverty, remote geographical location, low literacy, and ethnic diversity pose difficult challenges. Although the western region is not homogeneous in terms of socioeconomic development, variation in maternal mortality and coverage of maternal care is relatively small. By 2014, the maternal mortality ratios between provinces were remarkably similar, except for Tibet, which was still lagging behind. Despite undoubted success, maternal mortality remained higher in the western region than in the eastern and central regions, and socioeconomic inequalities in access to maternal care persisted at the individual level. The reasons why western China remains behind is not entirely clear. Total health expenditure and human resource density differed between the western and eastern provinces, but these factors did not explain the excess mortality in the western region. Indeed, in our regression model the only factors that partly explained the regional differences were the proportion of ethnic minorities and female illiteracy, although their effect was small. The variation in access to antenatal and delivery care at the individual level by education of the mother in the western provinces was surprisingly large and much greater than previously reported.65, 66 Illiterate women are more likely to be poor, to belong to ethnic minorities, and to live in remote villages. Maternal health services might still remain beyond the financial reach of poor farmers.67 County hospitals might be too far away and too reliant on advanced technology for uneducated women to choose to give birth there. Whether traditional customs add further barriers to facility delivery among ethnic minority populations is uncertain, although results from studies among Tibetan and Yi minority populations suggest that this might be the case.68, 69, 70 The stark contrast between inequalities in access to maternity care and the relative equality in immunisation coverage might provide further insights. Immunisation is offered in township hospitals close to the woman's home, is entirely free of cost, is being actively promoted by village doctors, and is organised at times when women gather together such as on market days.71 Although many township hospitals are poorly equipped for delivery care, strengthening their obstetric capacity might be one way of making delivery care more accessible to women in remote rural areas.",

Large county hospitals are replete with the most advanced technology and costly interventions, and many women have highly medicalised pregnancies and births, including unnecessary ultrasound, fetal monitoring, antibiotic use, and caesarean sections.72, 73, 74, 75, 76 China has one of the highest caesarean section rates in the world,77 although the difference in caesarean section rates between the richest and poorest provinces (63% in urban Beijing vs 5% in rural Tibet), or between the highest and lowest education level (44% vs 8%) in rural western China suggests that extreme excess goes hand in hand with unmet need. The problem of overmedicalisation is not unique to maternal health.36, 78 The Chinese Government is well aware of these problems and has recently taken measures such as monitoring of caesarean sections in hospitals, setting up a midwifery cadre to conduct deliveries, strengthening obstetric training, and offering health education to communities.79 Whether these measures will have an effect remain to be seen.",

            "text": "Very little is known about the quality of the provision of maternity care in China, and particularly whether the care adheres to international standards. Results from one study80 of county and township hospitals in seven rural counties in Shanxi province in 2005, showed that the management of complications was not evidence-based, and the quality of emergency obstetric care was poor and needed improvement. However, the study only audited the medical records of 118 women across the seven counties to assess the quality of care received during their complicated deliveries. In 2010, a WHO multicountry survey was done in 21 hospitals that had more than 1000 livebirths per hospital per year and could provide caesarean section (excluding township hospitals) in China, with a sample size of more than 10 000 births. Results of this survey showed adequate use of drugs such as surfactant administration for preterm birth, oxytocin for the prevention of post-partum haemorrhage, and magnesium sulphate as anticonvulsant for eclampsia.81 Results from studies in rural Sichuan province (western region)66 and rural Hebei province (eastern region)82 showed delayed antenatal care, lack of adherence to antenatal care standards, and long waits for emergency referrals to better equipped hospitals. To our knowledge, our study is the first to report differential standards of antenatal care by education level of the mother. Although less educated women might have difficulties recalling which tests were done, the progressive gradient across educational groups suggests that recall bias is unlikely to fully explain the pattern. Whether providers discriminate against poorer women or whether poorer women are less willing or able to demand services is not known.",

            "text": "Our study has important limitations. First, maternal mortality estimates are known to be prone to bias, and caution is needed in their interpretation.83 The maternal mortality estimates from the National Maternal and Child Health Routine Reporting System are consistent with those from the National Maternal and Child Mortality Surveillance System, an independent system collecting data on births and maternal and child deaths in a representative sample of counties and districts in China.84 More recently, however, reported data have diverged: in 2014, the Routine Reporting System reported 13\u00b73 maternal deaths per 100 000 livebirths, compared with 21\u00b77 per 100 000 in the surveillance system.15 Under-reporting of maternal deaths is therefore likely, and if more deaths have been missed in more remote areas, the difference between the western and eastern regions might well have been greater. Second, the coverage of facility births might have been inflated, particularly since specific targets were introduced in 1995. Large population-based surveys5 in 2008 and 2011 have confirmed the near-universal coverage of facility births, but aggregate data might hide huge disparities, and further breakdown is necessary to fully understand inequalities across socioeconomic strata. The proportion of births in health facilities (81%) in poor western counties that we report from the 2011 survey was higher than that reported for the poorest rural region in a national survey in 2008 (61%), at a time when the national coverage was 95%.85 Third, the linear regression model has to be interpreted with caution. Province-level data are crude, and urban\u2013rural variation could not be assessed because data were not available for key variables. We excluded Tibet for statistical reasons, but the inclusion of Tibet in our model did not alter the findings (data not shown). Collinearity between health systems inputs was substantial, and the choice of one factor (eg, licensed doctor density) over another (eg, hospital bed density) was arbitrary.",

Such progress was underpinned by a firm commitment from the government to long-term strategies to ensure access to delivery care in health facilities, particularly on the professionalisation of maternity care in large hospitals, effective referral systems for women who are medically or socially at high risk, and financial subsidies for antenatal and delivery care. Furthermore, these policies were implemented with enough authority and accountability to make professional delivery care accessible to all women. As China is on track to meet the Sustainable Development Goals, attention now needs to be paid to the unmet need of those not yet able to access care: the poor, less educated, and ethnic minority groups who live in remote areas in western China. Whether China's highly medicalised model of maternity care will be an answer for these populations is uncertain. A strategy modelled after the immunisation programme, whereby care is provided closer to the women's homes, might need to be explored, with township hospitals taking a more prominent role.",
