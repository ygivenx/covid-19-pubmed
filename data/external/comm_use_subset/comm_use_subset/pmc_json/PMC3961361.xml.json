During infection with a RNA virus, the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS/VISA/Cardif/IPS-1) has been recently uncovered to seed a critical protein complex on the mitochondrial outer membrane [1]\u2013[4]. This signalosome consists of TNFR-associated factors (TRAF2/3/6) [5], TNFR-associated death domain protein (TRADD) [6], translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 70 (TOM70) [7], ubiquitously expressed transcript (UXT-V1) [8], Autophagy proteins (Atg5/Atg12) [9], Mitofusin-2 (Mfn2) [10]\net.al. The MAVS signalosome activates TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), which then phosphorylates interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 3(IRF3). In addition, the MAVS signalosome can also activate the I\u03baB kinase (IKK) complex and nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB). Synergistically, these transcription factors (IRF3 and NF-\u03baB) induce the early production of type I interferons and inflammatory cytokines [11].",

Several recent studies suggested that MAVS mediates virus-induced cell apoptosis and that this function is independent of the interferon pathway. MAVS, as well as UXT-V1/V2, have been reported to promote the clearance of infected cells [13]. MAVS overexpression causes cell apoptosis and several viral proteins, such as hepatitis C virus NS3/4A and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nonstructural protein (NSP15), are inhibitors of the MAVS-induced apoptosis [14]. Borna disease virus (BDV) X protein can also interact with MAVS to inhibit MAVS-mediated apoptosis [15]. In addition, MAVS decreases the K48-linked ubiquitination of voltage-dependent anion channel 1(VDAV1) [16]. Activation of MAVS by Bunyavirus infection upregulates the adaptor protein SARM1, leading to neuronal death [17]. However, the molecular mechanism of how MAVS regulates apoptosis remains poorly understood.",

Sendai virus (SeV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) are enveloped negative-strand RNA viruses, which are able to trigger acute infection in rodents and induce robust cell apoptosis [18]. As such, these infections represent effective models for studying virus-induced apoptosis. Due to the central role of mitochondria in apoptosis and the mitochondrial localization of MAVS, it is important to explore the putative function of MAVS in the apoptotic signaling pathway. This work will be instrumental towards understanding the molecular mechanisms regarding host decisions on cell survival and apoptosis, and shedding further light on the cross-talk between innate immunity and apoptosis.",

            "text": "In this study, we report that MAVS plays an essential role in virus-induced apoptosis. Upon SeV infection, MAVS recruits MAPK kinase 7 (MKK7) onto mitochondria via its 3D domain, which specifically activates c-Jun N-terminal kinase 2 (JNK2) and triggers cell apoptosis. SeV was unable to trigger apoptosis in either Mavs\n\u2212/\u2212 cells or Mkk7\n\u2212/\u2212 cells. In addition, Jnk2\n\u2212/\u2212 cells, but not Jnk1\n\u2212/\u2212 cells, failed to initiate the virus-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, RIG-I and MDA5 (melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5) were not required for this apoptosis. Consistently, Jnk2\n\u2212/\u2212 mice, but not Jnk1\n\u2212/\u2212 mice, displayed marked inflammatory injury in both lung and liver after viral challenge. This study identifies a novel signaling pathway, MAVS-MKK7-JNK2, to mediate virus-induced apoptosis, revealing the indispensable role of the mitochondrial outer membrane in host defense.",

To explore this possibility, we overexpressed MAVS in HEK293 cells and then checked the activation of JNK, extracelluar signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38. Interestingly, the phosphorylation of JNK exhibited a dose-dependence on the expression of MAVS, whereas similar effects did not apply to either ERK or p38 (Figure 1A), suggesting that MAVS may specifically activate JNK. Using siRNA to knock down endogenous MAVS, we further explored the SeV-induced activation of JNK. As expected, SeV could induce the phosphorylation of all the MAP kinases (JNK, ERK and p38). Notably, knockdown of MAVS appeared to attenuate JNK activation, whereas this did not influence the activation of ERK or p38 (Figure 1B). In addition, the knock down of MAVS did not affect tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1)-triggered phosphorylation of JNK, ERK or p38 (Figure 1B). These observations suggest that virus-induced activation of JNK is dependent on MAVS.",

Ectopic-expression of RIG-I, TBK1, IKK\u03b1 or IKK\u03b5 did not influence JNK phosphorylation (Figure 1C). RIG-I and MDA5 are the viral nucleic acid sensors and are both upstream of MAVS signaling. We used Rig-i\u2212/\u2212 MEF cells to determine whether RIG-I also mediated JNK phosphorylation. Surprisingly, knockout of RIG-I didn't influence the SeV-triggered JNK phosphorylation, although it did abrogate IRF3 activation (Figure 1D). We also prepared siRNA sets to specifically knock down RIG-I or MDA5. The results showed that a decrease in either RIG-I or MDA5 did not impact SeV-induced JNK phosphorylation (Figure S1A). The absence of TBK1 also had no effect on JNK phosphorylation (Figure 1E). In contrast, MAVS deficiency completely blocked SeV-induced JNK activation (Figure 1F). Taken together, the SeV-induced activation of JNK is dependent on MAVS, yet independent of RIG-I/MDA5 and TBK1/IKK. These results suggest that MAVS is the converging point for activating JNK, TBK1 and IKK during viral infection.",

It was observed that the general inhibitor for JNK1/2(SP600125) markedly attenuated the SeV-induced PARP/caspase-3 cleavages (Figure 2D). Consistently, the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD effectively blocked the PARP/caspase-3 cleavages, whereas the inhibitor did not affect the phosphorylation of JNKs upon SeV stimulation (Figure S2A and S2B), suggesting that JNK activation is primary, not secondary to cell apoptosis. Unexpectedly, knock down of endogenous JNK2 alone significantly attenuated the SeV-induced PARP/caspase-3 cleavages, whereas knockdown of JNK1 alone did not appear to influence apoptosis (Figure 2E). These observations were further substantiated by using Jnk1\n\u2212/\u2212 and Jnk2\n\u2212/\u2212 MEF cells after SeV infection (Figure 2F) or VSV infection (Figure S2C). Collectively, these data differentiate the functions of JNK1 and JNK2, revealing the specific role of JNK2 in SeV-induced apoptosis.",

Given that both MKK4 and MKK7 could phosphorylate JNK1/2 in response to TNF-\u03b1, growth factors, DNA damage et.al, we tested whether MKK4/7 is essential for the SeV-induced JNK phosphorylation. To do this, we used Mkk4/7\n\u2212/\u2212 or Mkk3/6\n\u2212/\u2212 double knockout MEF cells. As expected, JNK1/2 phosphorylation was abolished in Mkk4/7\n\u2212/\u2212 cells, whereas this was not the case in Mkk3/6\n\u2212/\u2212 cells (Figure 3A). In addition, we individually knocked down MKK4 and MKK7 in HEK293 cells. MKK7, but not MKK4, was both necessary and sufficient for JNK phosphorylation (Figure 3B). Consistent with these results, SeV-induced apoptosis was significantly impaired in Mkk4/7\n\u2212/\u2212 MEF cells, in contrast to Mkk3/6\n\u2212/\u2212 MEF and wild type cells (Figure 3C). The specific knock down of MKK7, but not MMK4, further attenuated apoptosis in HEK293 cells (Figure 3D).

JNKs can quickly induce the expression of pro-apoptotic genes via their activation of specific transcription factors. In addition, they can directly regulate the pro- and/or anti-apoptotic activities of mitochondria-related proteins via distinct post-translational phosphorylation [20]. Whether the activation of JNKs leads to cell proliferation or apoptosis is dependent on the stimuli and cell type involved [21]. Further investigation is needed to dissect the manner by which JNK2 triggers the relevant apoptosis effector mechanism, downstream of MAVS-mediated signaling. One possibility is that JNK2 is integrated into the well-characterized effector responses, such as the induction of pro-apoptotic genes, cleavage of Bid, BAD/Bim phosphorylation, or the Bax clustering on mitochondria et.al. It is also intriguing to probe the potential cross-talk among these various apoptotic pathways.",

Several DNA sensors have been reported recently, including Absent In Melanoma 2 (AIM2) [26], DNA-dependent activator of interferon regulatory factors (DAI) [27], DEAD box polypeptide 41 (DDX41) [28], interferon inducible protein 16 (IFI16) [29], and cGAMP synthase (cGAS) [30], [31]. Each of these sensors activate the endoplasmic reticulum protein called stimulator of interferon genes (STING). Like MAVS, STING activates both IKK and IRF3, thereby turning on the NF-\u03baB and IRF3 signaling pathways [32], [33]. In the current study, we established the role of MAVS-MKK7-JNK2 signaling in mediating RNA virus-induced apoptosis. Future studies will address whether STING plays a role in JNK activation during DNA virus-induced apoptosis.

            "text": "Figure 8: MAVS is a critical converging point of the host response to RNA virus infection. By engaging RIG-I or MDA5, MAVS forms a mitochondrial signalosome, dynamically composed of TRAF2/3/6, TRADD, TOM70, UXT-V1 and so on. This signalosome leads to the activation of TBK1 and IKK and then the ultimate induction of type 1 interferon and inflammatory cytokines, thereby establishing the antiviral state. In addition, MAVS also recruits MAPK kinase MKK7 onto the mitochondria via protein-protein interaction. MKK7 subsequently induces the phosphorylation of JNK2 at its threonine-183 and tyrosine-185 positions. Finally, JNK2 initiates cell apoptosis to sacrifice the virus-infected host cell, thereby dampening virus-induced inflammatory injury.",
