However, detailed information on the epidemiology and evolution of viruses co-circulating in human and animal populations in the absence of significant outbreaks or epidemics is generally lacking. To help overcome this deficiency, the Vietnam Initiative on Zoonotic InfectIONS (VIZIONS) project ran between 2011 and 2016 with the overall aim of improving understanding of the epidemiology and evolution of zoonotic virus infections (particularly emerging infections) in Vietnam in south-east Asia.",

The main aims of the study were to characterise the diversity of viruses circulating in high-risk human populations and in the animals with which they were in contact (including those that were asymptomatic or caused only mild illness that would not be picked up in a hospital-based study), estimate the incidence of virus infections in the human cohort, and identify possible instances of cross-species transmission. Subjects were selected based on high levels of exposure to animals (mainly on farms, in wet markets or slaughterhouses) and were sampled routinely at regular intervals over a three-year period and during episodes of diarrhoea.",

Metagenomic sequence data would allow in-depth characterisation of virus diversity in the study populations. Subsequent phylogenetic analysis would provide insights into the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of the identified viruses, including their spatial and temporal spread through human and animal populations and the inference of any zoonotic transmission events.",

Dong Thap has an area of 3,379 km2 and is inhabited by just under 1.7 million people, approximately 4.7 million ducks, chickens and other poultry, 233,000 pigs, and 26,000 cattle and buffalo3. Additionally, there is a vibrant rat trade, with many tonnes of live rats sold for human consumption each year2.

This included keepers of both domestic and exotic animals, but excluded keepers of cold blooded animals. Poultry, pig and cattle farmers were originally selected at random from the animal farm census. Exotic animal farmers were actively sought as a group of special interest with the aim of maximising diversity of animals sampled. Up to four family members, including children, were enrolled from 61 farms.Pig and poultry slaughterers, representing people with more intense occupational exposures (particularly to blood). These were recruited from the three major abattoirs and slaughter points in Dong Thap Province.Animal health workers, representing people with intense occupational exposures to sick animals. These were recruited through the Dong Thap Sub-Department of Animal Health and District Veterinary Stations.Rat traders and sellers from three marketplaces.
