We aim to investigate the strength of the recombination signals reported by Yun et al.\n[16], since if proved valid their discovery would lead to a radical departure from the classical understanding of the evolutionary dynamic in MTBFG. Although, we could not confirm the previously described recombinations, we did identify a strong recombinant signal in the LIV lineage.

We used the available full length coding genomes for dating, but this small sample may limit the power of the molecular-clock analysis. There are a large number of E-sequences available from molecular epidemiological studies. Unfortunately, E-sequence cannot be used directly to date recombination events, as we estimated that the substitution rates for the E-gene is significantly lower than for other viral genes. This means that dates obtained from E-sequences alone tend to be younger and do not represent accurately the temporal dynamic of this viral lineage. We suggest that a large dataset that includes sonly E-sequences could nevertheless be used to date additional divergence events by specifying informative priors on the ages of some important nodes. We describe an incremental analytical strategy that bases these priors on posterior distributions derived from the analysis of full-length coding sequences following removal of the E-sequences.",

Each dataset was evaluated individually for best fitting substitution model, which ranged from HKY+\u03934+I to GTR+\u03934+I. However, analyses performed under GTR family models neither converged nor mixed well, possibly due to an insufficiency of data to estimate these highly parametric substitution models. Hence, the simpler, less parameter rich, HKY+\u03934+I model was used throughout the BEAST investigation. We tested the impact of using a GTR model by running an analysis for 20\u00d7106 generations. Estimates for the parameters of interest were largely concordant (data not shown), albeit the analyses returned very low ESS and much wider confidence intervals. Pairwise comparisons of Bayes factors calculated in Tracer selected the uncorrelated lognormally distributed relaxed-clock (UCLN) and the Bayesian Skyline coalescence model [36] as the best fitting clock and demographic models following the procedure in Hon et al.\n[37]. We defined two partitions that separated first and second positions from third codon positions. For each analysis, four independent MCMC chains were run for 20\u00d7106 generations and their log output combined with 10% burn-in samples discarded. Tracer was used to determine the degree of mixing, shape of the probability density distribution, median and highest posterior density regions at 95% (HPD) for the relevant parameters. The modes and parameters of the posterior distributions were estimated using the distribution fitting software EasyFit 5.3 (MathWave Technology). For all analyzed parameters, we modeled the posterior distributions with gamma distributions. The analytical framework of the BEAST analyses is presented in Figure 1 and the details are explained below.",

In contrast, LIV is well embedded within the W-TBEV clade and is placed together with Neudoerfl for the recombinant partition. Although the two most supported nodes that identify close evolutionary relationships between LIV and a strain from W-TBEV display moderate BS and PP (78% and 0.92 for the branching with Neudoerfl, 89% and 0.99 for the inclusion of LIV within W-TBEV), they are among the most significantly supported nodes in this tree. We tested the three putative recombinant fragments obtained by different methods in RDP3 and found that the shorter segment branched together with Neudoerfl with higher support values. Hence, we proceed with further characterization of this mosaic history under the assumption that crossovers occurred at nucleotides 5787 and 5991, which places the 204 nt long recombination in the highly conserved helicase domain of NS3 (subdomain 3). At the nucleotide level, the comparison of the daughter with its parental strains revealed 23 variable sites within the putative recombinant element, while the rest of the NS3 gene contained 274 variable sites.

For the sake of studying the recombination event, ideally three nodes should be scrutinized: Node \u201cr\u201d on Figure 3 estimates the actual recombination. It refers to the clustering of the LIV recombinant segment with the Neudoerfl strain which places tRE at a median of 76 (HPD: 45\u2013160) years before origin. Accordingly, this time point is paramount and constitutes the lower bound of the estimate, but caution is advised when interpreting it as the definitive estimate. Indeed, it suffers from being inferred from a dataset comprising very short sequences. Moreover this analysis, carried out with a low level of prior enforcement, demonstrates a systematic bias towards younger antiquity. \u201cM\u201d and \u201cm\u201d are time points that refer respectively to the oldest estimate for the emergence of the major and minor parental lineages. Point \u201cM\u201d corresponds to the split of SSEV and LIV lineages, dated at a median of 1017 (HPD: 664 to 1510). Point \u201cm\u201d refers to the emergence of Neudoerfl, which corresponds to its split with the most closely related strain Hypr. However, few substitutions among the nine W-TBEV strains leads to poor phylogenetic resolution. Hence, a more conservative estimate for the onset of the minor parent would coincide with the divergence of the W-TBEV clade, placed at a median of 307 (HPD: 208 to 444) years.",

We analyzed the largest available dataset for TBEV strains with collections dates (161 sequences); unfortunately, it only covers the Envelope glycoprotein (E) obtained from epidemiological studies. This brings on two problems: Firstly, this dataset is unable to target the actual recombination that occurred within the NS3 gene. Secondly, inference 1 has demonstrated that the E-gene presents the lowest rate of substitution among the viral genes, therefore it estimates older divergence dates than other portions of the genome. Although the former issue cannot be avoided, E-sequences can nevertheless pinpoint which lineages would carry the recombinant element in a much larger tree. The latter issue can be tackled in a Bayesian framework by incorporating posterior information on divergence times derived from full-length coding sequences as prior distributions in an E-sequence analysis. The underlying rational is that by injecting information that pertains to all genes, bar E and the recombinant segment, we would be able to downplay the influence of the low substitution rate, while still combining all available evidence and avoiding circularity. We used BEAST inference 3 to calculate prior distributions for the root age and tMRCA(W-TBEV). The prior on the substitution rate was derived from the literature and not from BEAST inference 1 in order to avoid circularity in the use of data.",

The low positive selection is a well documented aspect of the mode of evolution of vector-borne RNA viruses [45]\u2013[47], which demonstrate a lack of immune-driven positive selection [46] and a very effective purifying selection [48]. Our analyses did not identify any site under positive selection. Moreover, the substitution rate analysis yielded a median of 3.3\u00d710\u22125 (HPD: 1.5\u00d710\u22125\u20136.1\u00d710\u22125) subs./site/year for E, significantly lower than the previously reported rates of 1.6\u00d710\u22124, within S-TBEV [49] and FE-TBEV [50] and the 8.0\u00d710\u22124 found W-TBEV [21]. The main difference with the previous studies can be pinpointed to our use of a relaxed clock, which was chosen because Bayes factor comparisons indicated that the strict clock performed significantly worse than relaxed models. It is known that incorrect clock assumption may lead to spurious rate estimates [51] and dating analyses effectuated under a strict clock and the same set of priors as in inference 1, yielded a mean rate estimate twice as high as under a relaxed clock and, consequently underestimated all divergence times by about a factor two (data not shown).",

The second relates to the differences in replication strategies within the two hosts, with the virus mostly persisting in the tick in a dormant noncytolytic state, while it actively replicates in the mammalian environment. The third addresses the differences in immune response in the two host types: Mutations facilitating immune escape or tolerance in the first host might cause the opposite effect in the second. In the present analysis the Envelope gene displays the lowest substitution rate. As it encodes the protein responsible for the induction of protective antibody response in mammals [52], the reported rate could be explained by the third trade-off mechanism. Accordingly, the other surface-exposed structural proteins do not interact with hosts environment as strongly as the E protein (the M protein is buried under a scaffold of E dimmers and the Capsid is covered by the Envelope) and could accumulate more mutations. We conjecture that the C-gene reaches the highest substitution rates because the Capsid is not directly involved in the replication or in the mounting of an anti-viral immune response. Rate differences for nonstructural proteins could in turn be explained by the first and second trade-offs.",

It is a form of incremental induction wherein the belief at the end of an investigative step is injected as a prior belief for the next step. This new belief will in turn be modified by conditionalizing upon new evidence. In order to reach credibility interval for drawing conclusions about the temporal setting of the RE, we were compelled to apply several informative priors on our final BEAST analysis. In the first step it is beneficial to place a weakly informative prior on the root [56]. This prior obtained from the literature had the effect of concentrating the probability density around its mean so it could be captured by a narrow shaped gamma distribution. In the following steps, formal probability distributions were retrieved from posteriors in the previous step and used as prior assumptions about rates and node antiquity. Although, the overlap of datasets between iterations was kept minimal, our strategy imposes to maintain some sequences across datasets in order to identify the nodes to which the derived prior should be applied. The reduction of the credibility intervals for the date parameters indicates that our approach succeeded to improve the accuracy of the time estimates by combining different lines of information coming from informative data and from the literature.",

Using a strict clock Zanotto et al. found four to five times younger divergences than those presently reported (Table 5) [38]. Due to the rejection of the strict clock model, we argue that our approach provides a better estimate of divergence times given the data at hand, although some notes of caution should be raised. Our molecular dating could be hampered by sequencing errors, especially since sequence variation is low. In addition, the low substitution rates, could lead to inaccurate rate estimations [57]. Indeed, our estimates for individual genes approaches the limit of 1\u00d710\u22125 substitutions/site/year below which the temporal signal for heterochronous sampled virus begins to break down [58] and tend not to converge on the true rate when analyzed with BEAST. On that account, the least reliable time estimates are produced by the shortest alignment, which casts doubts on the tRE lower bound that was derived from 204 nt long sequences from the recombinant region. Therefore, although our dating estimates are more accurate than those relying on a poorly fitted molecular clock, more full-length genomes with a wide temporal sampling are required for a definitive assessment of divergence events in the Tick-borne encephalitis virus.",

Birds on a longitudinal migrating route have been found to carry infected ticks through Scandinavia [59]. However, phylogenetic analyses have not shown any clear admixture of Northern and Southern strains that would point towards bird distribution. Therefore, livestock importation from central Europe to the UK seems a more likely explanation for the footprint of past W-TBEV presence observed in the LIV genome. It is not clear why W-TBEV strains did not form stable foci in the British Isles; possibly the number of continental strains was too small to find its way from infected sheep to the small rodents that are their natural vertebrate hosts.",

For recombination to occur, a vector can become infected with multiple strains during co-feeding in close proximity on the host skin with other ticks carrying different strains. Co-infection is then mediated via the tick saliva [60]. Alternatively, ticks can engage in multiple feeding on viraemic hosts that have been previously infected with different strains [14]. For both situations, sheep are an ideal milieu for recombination to occur when they are fed upon by several vectors carrying both W-TBEV and LIV strains. Indeed, unlike TBEV, LIV can induce a high-titer viraemia in sheep which enables tick re-infection during bloodsucking [8], [11].",

Dating recombination events is challenging, due to high sequence similarity, low substation rate and condensed temporal sampling. In order to refine this analysis, additional full-length genomes of LIV strains are necessary. Now that the recombining fragment has been identified, it can readily be researched in LIV genomes. Finally, although sequencing the E-gene in order identify strains is a standard practice, the low substitution rate observed in this gene does not supply enough information for robust phylogenetic/phylogeographic studies. We would therefore recommend to sequence, together with E, a faster evolving marker such as the Capsid-gene.",
