Defensins, expressed in leukocytes and/or epithelia of most mammals studied, are 2\u20134.5 kDa cationic peptides that are further divided into three structural families (\u03b1-, \u03b2-, and \u03b8-defensins) based on their distinctive tridisulfide motifs [1], [2]. \u03b1- and \u03b2-defensins, though genetically distinct, share similar peptide folds and are widely expressed in mammals including humans [3], [4]. Defensins of all three structural families were first recognized for their antimicrobial properties in vitro. Collectively, the antimicrobial spectrum of defensins includes bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and viruses [5], [6], [7]. Defensins also function as \u201calarmins\u201d which elicit adaptive responses to infection and tissue injury [8], [9], [10].",

The peptides have a macrocyclic backbone that is post-translationally generated by pair-wise excision and head-to-tail splicing of two nine-residue segments derived from truncated \u03b1-defensin-related precursors [12]. The nonapeptides may be identical (homodimeric splicing) or derived from different precursors (heterodimeric splicing) thus amplifying the diversity of \u03b8-defensin gene encoded products. Six rhesus macaque \u03b8-defensin isoforms (RTDs 1\u20136) are expressed in neutrophils where they are packaged in cytoplasmic granules. Specific neutralization of RTDs in lysates of macaque neutrophil granules markedly reduced the antimicrobial activities of this preparation against E. coli, S. aureus, and C. albicans, indicating a prominent role for these peptides as components of the PMN antimicrobial armamentarium [13].",

The protective effect in vivo correlated with the reduction of pulmonary inflammation and the suppression of several pro-inflammatory cytokines in lung homogenates. To further characterize the immunoregulatory properties of \u03b8-defensins, we analyzed the effects of natural \u03b8-defensin isoforms on cytokine/chemokine responses in stimulated human leukocytes and THP-1 monocytes, and tested the efficacy of RTD-1 in two mouse models of bacteremic sepsis. The results of these studies also demonstrate that cyclic \u03b8-defensins have sequence-specific anti-inflammatory properties that distinguish them from human neutrophil \u03b1-defensins.",

Approved anesthetics were used for surgeries, recommended analgesics were used for post-operative care, and every effort was made to minimize suffering. Chimpanzees were housed in social groups in indoor/outdoor housing and cared for in accordance with the U.S. Public Health Service Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the U.S. Animal Welfare Act. They were fed standard monkey chow supplemented with fruits and vegetables twice daily. Potable water is available to each enclosure using lixit mechanisms. There is a very active environmental enrichment program for all animals and animal training is implemented to reduce stress and accomplish animal husbandry procedures cooperatively.

We initially tested the effect of RTD-1 on ssRNA (TLR8 agonist) induced responses of PBLs to compare human cell responses with those obtained in mouse SARS-CoV (a single stranded RNA virus) pneumonitis. As shown in Figure 1, ssRNA stimulation of human leukocytes induced cytokines/chemokines similar to those observed in murine SARS-CoV pneumonitis including IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF, CXCL8 (IL-8), CCL2 (MCP-1), CCL3 (MIP-1\u03b1), and CCL4 (MIP-1\u03b2).

To better understand the sequence of peptide-mediated TNF blockade, mixing experiments were performed wherein blood, peptide, and E. coli cells were pre-incubated in varied combinations (see Methods), and TNF release was quantified as described above. Pre-incubation of RTD-1 with blood for up to 2 h had no effect on the magnitude of TNF-release inhibition which was quite stable (70\u201380%) over the pre-incubation time course (Fig. 4A). This is consistent with the effect of RTD-1 on TNF release when RTD-1, E. coli, and blood were mixed simultaneously (Fig. 2). In contrast, pre-mixing of blood and E. coli cells for up to 2 h, followed by addition of RTD-1, showed a time-dependent increase of TNF release in both control and peptide containing mixtures (Fig. 4B). However, at each time point the presence of RTD-1 reduced TNF levels (46\u201393%; Fig. 4B). These results indicate that RTD-1-mediated blockade of E. coli-stimulated TNF release is very rapid, occurring immediately after addition of the peptide to leukocyte-containing mixtures (Figs. 2 and 4). When E. coli cells were incubated with RTD-1 prior to addition of blood, complete blockade of TNF release was observed at all time-points (Fig. 4C), whereas E. coli alone elicited increasing levels of TNF as a function of pre-incubation time. During the 120 minute pre-incubation interval, bacterial counts increased 3.2-fold, consistent with the temporal rise in inducible TNF release following the addition of blood (Fig. 4C). On the other hand, the absence of viable bacteria in samples containing RTD-1 revealed that E. coli was efficiently killed by the peptide by within 30 min. The potent inhibition of E. coli-stimulated TNF release by blood leukocytes at T = 0 in this experiment further demonstrates the rapid blockade of bacteria-stimulated TNF release by RTD-1 (Fig. 4C). Moreover, the bactericidal effect of RTD-1 terminates further production of bacterial antigen which, based on bacterial cell numbers, tripled in 2 h in the absence of RTD-1 (Fig. 4C). Taken together, the data summarized in Figures 2 and 4 suggest that RTD-1 interacts with leukocytes to suppress TNF in response to microbial antigens.",

To determine the relative anti-inflammatory activities of other \u03b8-defensins isoforms (RTDs 2\u20135; Fig. 5A), we analyzed the effects of these peptides on TNF levels in E. coli-blood assays described above. As shown in Figure 5B, all \u03b8-defensin isoforms suppressed supernatant TNF levels with potencies, based on estimations of IC50, ranging from 1\u201310 \u00b5g/ml (0.5\u20135 \u00b5M). RTDs 2 and 5 were substantially more effective than RTD-1, whereas RTDs 3 and 4 were less active. Analogous experiments were performed to assess the effects of \u03b8-defensin isoforms on LPS-stimulated THP-1 monocytes. In these experiments RTD 1\u20135 inhibited stimulated TNF release and the IC50s once again varied ca. 10 fold (Fig. 5C). Of note, the hierarchy of anti-TNF potencies was the same as that obtained in E. coli-stimulated blood experiments, i.e., RTD-5>2>1>4>3. Human \u03b1-defensin HNP-2 had no inhibitory effect on TNF release in either assay (Fig. 5B & C; also see Fig. 2), and a physiologic mixture of HNP 1\u20133 also lacked TNF inhibitory activity (data not shown). In each of the in vitro experiments described above, we confirmed that the reduction of cytokine expression was not the result of cytotoxic effects on the target cells as trypan blue staining confirmed that cell viability was >99% at the end of each incubation interval. Lack of cytotoxicity was further confirmed by the finding that VEGF-A expression increased following RTD-1 treatment (Fig. 1; discussed further below).",

In a previous study, RTD-1 suppressed pulmonary bronchiolitis and the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by SARS-CoV, an ssRNA virus. RTD-1 treatment of ssRNA-stimulated PBLs suppressed the levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (Fig. 1), and the anti-inflammatory profile was similar to that obtained in the SARS-CoV pneumonitis model. RTD-1 also suppressed cytokine/chemokine release by PBLs stimulated with other TLR agonists, including those for TLRs 2, 4, and 5, and the peptide suppressed TNF release stimulated by both Gram-positive (S. aureus) and Gram-negative (E. coli) bacteria. Based on these findings we speculated that the effects of RTD-1 were due to the modulation of early interactions of leukocytes with inflammatory stimuli. RTD-1 was ineffective in neutralizing LPS, indicating that peptide binding of this TLR4 agonist is unlikely to be an important anti-inflammatory mechanism. This differentiates \u03b8-defensins from other antimicrobial peptides that bind and neutralize LPS [24]\u2013[26].",

            "text": "Pre-incubation experiments described above (Fig. 4) revealed that RTD-1 very rapidly blocked E. coli-stimulated TNF release in human blood, and temporal analyses of these mixing experiments implicated peptide-leukocyte interactions to be the critical determinant of TNF blockade. The time scale of the inhibitory effects (minutes) suggests that \u03b8-defensin may disrupt the mobilization of TNF from the surface of stimulated cells. Since TNF plays a central role in triggering and sustaining inflammatory cascades [22], [23], [27], \u03b8-defensin blockade of TNF may suppress subsequent inflammatory responses, thereby reducing levels of other inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in vitro (Fig. 1) and in vivo (Fig. 7B). Alternatively, \u03b8-defensins may interrupt TNF autocrine circuits that amplify the effect of this acute phase cytokine. While suppression of RTD-mediated TNF release was a common feature of antigen-stimulated leukocyte responses in vitro, we have yet to identify downstream mechanisms that result in the down regulation of secondary pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines. In this context, the effects of inflammatory mediator blockade is highly complex and context dependent, and likely involves crosstalk of signaling factors that are differentially induced by distinct TLR agonists and other stimuli to produce protective and/or pathologic responses [28]\u2013[30]. Thus it is not surprising that the immunomodulatory effects of RTD-1 varied as a function of inflammatory stimuli.",

            "text": "Correlation of in vitro effects, such as those analyzed using whole blood, PBLs, and monocyte-macrophages, with effects observed in vivo (e.g., sepsis models) must be interpreted with caution. In this regard, the relatively modest effects of systemically-administered RTD-1 on plasma cytokines in bacteremic mice contrasts with the dramatic down regulation of cytokines that occurred when leukocytes were treated with \u03b8-defensins in vitro; this apparent discrepancy is observed in many if not most in vitro/in vivo model comparisons. It is evident that the pathways induced by \u03b8-defensins in vivo (e.g., Fig. 7A and 8) require further investigation to delineate the mechanisms that confer efficacy in these models. In this context, RTD-1 treatment of PBLs produced a reproducible elevation of VEGF-A. However, the peptide had no such effect in vivo, and in fact significantly reduced VEGF-A levels in bacteremic mice (Fig. 7B). In the lung, both protective and pathologic roles have been ascribed to VEGF and its physiologic regulation appears to play a critical role in the outcome of pulmonary acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome [31]. The induction of leukocyte VEGF-A by RTD-1 may represent a new mechanism whereby circulating cells are stimulated to release this vascular growth factor by locally expressed \u03b8-defensin. It is of interest to note the human neutrophil \u03b1-defensins inhibits VEGF-dependent neovascularization [32], [33], potentially highlighting another difference between \u03b1- and \u03b8-defensins. Studies are underway to analyze the mechanisms underlying the induction of VEGF-A in \u03b8-defensin stimulated leukocytes.",

RTD-1 was also well-tolerated when administered intravenously or subcutaneously to mice, rats, and chimpanzees. Following repeated injections, neither of two chimpanzees produced anti-RTD-1 antibody. The biocompatibility of RTD-1 enabled an evaluation of its therapeutic potential in animal models of systemic inflammation. The discovery of antimicrobial peptides and their proven roles in host defense has prompted studies to evaluate diverse peptides derived from human cells (LL-37 [39], [40]), ungulates (indolicidin [41])*** and sheep myeloid antimicrobial peptide (SMAP)-29 [42]), and pigs (protegrins [24], [43]) in preclinical bacteremia models. Protection against lethal bacteremia by LL-37 [40], indolicidin [44], and SMAP-29 [42] was observed following a single systemic administration of peptide at the time of bacterial challenge and therapeutic effects in each case were attributed to anti-endotoxic activities of the respective peptides. In contrast, in CLP sepsis, multiple doses of porcine protegrin PG-1 had little endotoxin-neutralizing effect and the treatment regimen produced no therapeutic effect compared to vehicle control [45]. Data presented here suggest that RTD-1 alters the course of disease in two models of bacteremic sepsis in a manner different from the above examples. Single dose administration of RTD-1 in either E. coli peritonitis or CLP sepsis produced a therapeutic response. In the former model, simultaneous but modest reductions in inflammatory cytokines were observed in RTD-1 treated animals. Surprisingly, a single dose of RTD-1 rescued mice rendered septic by CLP surgery even when treatment was delayed for 24 after peritonitis was induced. Efficacy of \u03b8-defensins in these models appears to be independent of direct anti-endotoxic effects since the peptide was ineffective in blocking the effects of endotoxin in the limulus amoebocyte assay. Current studies are underway to further characterize the mechanistic bases for the immunomodulatory activities of \u03b8-defensins in vitro and in vivo. The lack of immunogenicity and toxicity across species raises the possibility that \u03b8-defensin may have utility as human therapeutics.",
