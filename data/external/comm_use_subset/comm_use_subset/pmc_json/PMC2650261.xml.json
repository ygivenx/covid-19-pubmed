The prevalence is approximately 1 in 12,000\u201320,000 [1]\u2013[3]. About 50% of patients affected by PCD have a situs inversus which results from monocilia dysfunction at the embryonic node [4]. This association is referred to as Kartagener's syndrome (OMIM #244400) [5]. PCD causes chronic sinus and bronchial respiratory infections that begin early in life, leading to nasal polyps and bronchiectasis. Males are frequently sterile due to dysfunctional spermatozoa flagella [6]. Other symptoms can also be associated with PCD like hydrocephalus, anosmia, retinitis pigmentosa and congenital heart diseases [7]\u2013[10].",

To introduce genetic material into cells we focused on lentiviral gene transfer because lentivirus has the property to integrate its genetic material into host cell genome even in non-replicating cell [22]. Moreover, lentivirus is weakly immunogenic unlike recombinant adenovirus which efficiency was reported to decrease after several administrations in a clinical study of patients suffering from cystic fibrosis [23]. Lentiviral-derived vectors used in gene therapy were principally based on SIV (simian immunodeficiency virus) or HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). For this latter one, gene transfer efficiency into bronchial epithelium in mice was already demonstrated [24].",

Three parameters were investigated: (1) the multiplicity of infection (MOI), (2) the moment of infection and (3) whether using a polycation, Polybrene, or not. Two different moments of infection during Jorissen's culture were tested: at J+1, cells were ciliated and in suspension or at J+3, cells were de-differentiated and adherent. Two days post-infection, reporter gene expression was analyzed by FACS (Figure 1). In any of the selected conditions, HAECs were transduced but the proportion of transduced cells seemed to be dependant on MOI irrespective of the other parameters, and apparently higher at MOI 75. Then, transduction of cells infected at J+1 seemed more efficient compared to cells infected at J+3. At MOI 75, approximately 38% of cells infected at J+1 were transduced versus 20% for cells infected at J+3. Moreover, these results seemed to be improved by the use of Polybrene. Finally, at MOI 75, transduction efficiency was quantified at about 38% for cells infected at J+1 without Polybrene compared to approximately 50% for cells infected at J+1 with the use of Polybrene. These experiments which were not repeated, demonstrated that HAECs could be transduced in a variety of conditions and that J+1 with Polybrene at a MOI of 75 were presumably the best experimental conditions for HAECs infection. Therefore, we selected these conditions for further experiments.",

First, mRNA extracts from transduced HAECs were controlled by PCR with alpha-tubulin specific primers for absence of genomic DNA (gDNA) contamination (not shown). Second, we confirmed that non-ciliated HAECs (NC) do not express DNAI1 because DNAI1 specific RT primer (P5) led to an absence of amplification by contrast to re-ciliated HAECs (RC) template (Figure 3, lanes 1 and 2). Third, DNAI1 mRNA was not amplified using a HA-tag RT specific primer (HA) from non-infected re-ciliated HAECs (Figure 3, lane 3). To test DNAI1 transcription from lentiviral vectors, HA-tagged DNAI1 gene transcription was revealed by RT-PCR using HA-DNAI1 specific primers. Re-ciliated HAECs infected by particles containing HA-tagged DNAI1 with either an exact Kozak sequence (pK+HA) or a modified Kozak sequence (pK-HA) both transcribed HA-tagged DNAI1 (Figure 3, lanes 4 and 5). Non-ciliated HAECs infected by pK-HA particles also expressed HA-tagged DNAI1 (Figure 3, lane 6). In conclusion, DNAI1 transcription is efficient from vectors containing a conserved or a modified Kozak sequence and transcription of the transduced DNAI1 cDNA driven by Elongation Factor-1 promoter is active in non-ciliated and re-ciliated HAECs.",

Previous studies showed that Murine Leukemia virus (MuLV) [28] and Feline Immunodeficiency Virus pseudotyped with VSV-G envelope [29] could transduce HAECs in culture. Though, this transduction was only possible from the basolateral surface of polarized HAECs. We did not know whether a Simian Immunodeficiency Virus would transduce although we could foresee that transduction would be more efficient from the basolateral surface of HAECs since it was pseudotyped with VSV-G. We did not know also whether de-differentiated cells would be transduced. It appeared that whatever the conditions used in this study, a certain proportion of cultured HAECs were infected. We then selected the conditions that seemed to provide the higher percentage of infected cells in culture. In any case, these conditions are strikingly different from in vivo situation where HAECs are a component of a complex epithelium recovered by a thin layer of mucus. Moreover, Polybrene which seemed to improve viral infection in cultured cells cannot be used in vivo due to side-effects. In a next step, we demonstrated transcription and translation of the transduced DNAI1 cDNA. Finally, we showed that DNAI1-mutated HAECs treated by DNAI1 gene transfer recovered ciliary beating whereas GFP-treated cells' cilia remained immotile, thus supporting our concept that PCD gene therapy was possible using DNAI1 gene. This conceptual proof is essential in the perspective of a human gene therapy.",

To produce viral particles which would preferentially target human airway ciliated cells, the VSV-G large cell tropism protein could be replaced by another envelope protein from one of the various viruses known to infect airway epithelium, ie. coronavirus or Influenza virus [31],[32]. Influenza virus receptors, as \u03b12,3-linked sialic acid receptors, were described to be specifically localized on ciliated airway and type II alveolar epithelial cells in both mouse and human respiratory epithelium, and on a subpopulation of basal cells in humans [32]. By contrast, \u03b12,6-linked sialic acid receptors are expressed on human ciliated and goblet cells but not in the mouse. Therefore, it should be interesting to evaluate on our current culture model, the use of hemagglutinin (HA) from selected Influenza viruses which preferentially bind to ciliated cells. Finally, Szecsi et al. demonstrated that HA envelope protein of H7N1 and H5N1 avian viruses was successfully associated with retroviral-based vectors resulting in higher titres of infected cells than with VSV-G [33].",

In the mouse model, ciliated cells renewal was reported to be provided by Clara cells which are also essential in the alveolar type II cells generation [34]. Nevertheless, Park et al. reported that after an injury event, murine ciliated epithelial cells could transdifferentiate into other cell types and restored the airway epithelium [35]. In the human airway epithelium, Hajj et al. demonstrated that basal cells were able to regenerate as well as to differentiate into secretory and ciliated cells [36]. Targeting these basal cells with a lentiviral vector would result in the stable integration of the therapeutic gene with no need to repeat infections. The specificity of cells' targeting has been recently improved by taking into account the presence of proteases at the cell surface [37]. Thus, cell transduction can be achieved only in cell types that have the capacity to bind viral surface glycoprotein and to cleave the protease substrate because the surface glycoprotein of several enveloped viruses are expressed as precursor proteins that need to be cleaved into two subunits by cellular proteases to promote cell entry.",

            "text": "Finally, DNAI1 gene transfer could be applied to other genes causing PCD, as DNAH5 mutations are responsible for at least 28% of PCD cases [21]. However, another vector should be considered for this gene because of size limitation of lentivirus. As an alternative, AAV vectors offer a good safety profile in particular because viral DNA does not integrate into the genome of transfected cells. However, AAV repeated administration triggers anti-viral immune response and its packaging capacity is too limited to hold the DNAH5 gene (13.9 kb). High-capacity episomal vectors offer the possibility to deliver not only a large gene but also the whole genomic locus including regulatory regions which ensures a physiological expression with tissue and time specificity. However, delivery of extrachromosomal DNA with non viral or viral strategies is so far limited to cell lines. This system, tough, is appropriate for long-term treatment as in PCD because chromosome-based episomal systems contain elements enabling the cell to process episome as an additional chromosome with a mitotic stability >99% in cell lines [38].",
