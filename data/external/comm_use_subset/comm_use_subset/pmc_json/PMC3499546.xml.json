More recently, these genes were identified as novel types of antiviral restriction factors with a wide spectrum of antiviral activity against influenza A viruses (e.g. H1N1 viruses), West Nile virus, dengue virus, filoviruses, HIV-1, HCV, venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and even SARS-coronavirus [8], [13]\u2013[18]. The main function of IFITM5 is associated with bone development in vertebrates [4], [19], [20]. IFITM6 seems to be involved in macrophage functions in tumor suppression [20]. To date, however, there is no information about the functions of IFITM7 and IFITM10.",

As important virus inhibitors, IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3 may have also undergone a similar co-evolutionary process, such as other antiviral restriction factors do. Despite this connection, relationships between antiviral functions and adaptive evolution in IFITM family have seldom been reported and although previous reports had illustrated the phylogenetic history of IFITM family in some eukaryotic species [2], [30], [31], there has been no detailed information about IFITM genes in vertebrates.

The taxa included ten non-mammalian vertebrates (five fishes: stickleback, tetraodon, medaka, fugu, zebrafish; one amphibian: frog; one non-avian reptile: lizard; three birds: chicken, turkey, zebra finch) and 17 mammals covering six primates (human, chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, macaque, marmoset), four glires (mouse, guinea pig, rat, and rabbit), five other mammals (tree shrew, cow, horse, dog and elephant), 1 metatherian (opossum) and 1 prototherian (platypus). We divided the newly identified genes into three types based on the following criteria: (i) functional genes, which contain full-length ORFs with intact CD225 domain and C-terminal TMDs; (ii) putative functional genes, which have CD225 domains but contain incomplete ORFs; and (iii) pseudogenes, which are sequences with pre-mature stop codons.",

Furthermore, some IR-IFITM genes from same species cluster together and form species-specific sub-clusters, indicating that the IR-IFITM sub-family experienced a rapid expansion through gene duplications after the divergence of primates. Interestingly, a species-specific cluster was formed by the 25 IR-IFITM genes from marmoset, suggesting a rapid expansion of IR-IFITM genes by gene duplication. This speculation is supported by the four pairs of marmoset IFITM genes (IFITM-like8 and IFITM-like24, IFITM-like10 and IFITM-like29, IFITM-like14 and IFITM-like26, and IFITM-like11 and IFITM-like27) that exhibit very close genetic relationships, possibly indicating relatively recent gene duplication events.

Because IFITM7 has chromosome location independent from any other IFITM genes, and only mouse and rat have IFITM7 gene, we did not take it into account in this analysis. Orthologous relationships between IFITM family members were well confirmed with conserved syntenies (Fig. 4A). All these genes are located in one chromosome and form two loci in terrestrial vertebrates, except in cow that has two loci in two different chromosomes. With the exception of IFITM10, that is located at one locus, all other IFITM genes gather together and form a gene-cluster in the other locus. In teleosts (e.g. zebrafish), the two loci are dispersed in two different chromosomes. Although we identified two loci in two scaffolds of frog, whether they are dispersed in two different chromosomes is still unknown. We investigated genes flanking both sides of the two IFITM loci, and found that the two loci have almost completely same flanking genes from lower (e.g. zebrafish) to higher (e.g. human) vertebrate species. These findings suggest that chromosomal fusion might have occurred during the vertebrate evolution from aquatic to terrestrial species. Furthermore, all these IFITM genes have two exons, and the IFITM gene-clusters exhibit consistent gene order in four hominids, two rodents and three birds, supporting the syntenic relationship of IFITM genes.",

Because positive selection is generally associated with the occurrence of gene duplication [35], and a large number of gene duplications were observed in the marmoset IR-IFITM genes, we also performed site-specific analysis on marmoset IR-IFITM genes. As expected, one significant PSS was detected in marmoset IR-IFITM genes.",

PSSs identified by MEME method are consistent with those identified by PAML. Furthermore, positive selection can be also confirmed by branch-site REL method in both IR-IFITM and IFITM10 clades (Fig. S7). The major lineages that have undergone positive selection in the IR-IFITM clade are primate and rodent (Fig. S7A). Additionally, IFITM10 in lower vertebrate lineages also experienced strong selective pressure. Positively selected branches were detected in both teleost and frog lineages (Fig. S7B).",

Substantial functional divergences occurred between IR-IFITM, IFITM5 and IFITM10 genes, indicating that IR-IFITM, IFITM5 and IFITM10 experienced individual evolutions. IR-IFITM, IFITM5 and IFITM10 genes are usually located in two loci (Fig. 4). One locus contains only the IFITM10 gene, and the other locus contains various numbers of IR-IFITM genes with a syntenic location with IFITM5, forming an IFITM gene-cluster. The two loci can be used as good markers to trace the evolutionary history of IFITM family. They are located in two different chromosomes in lower aquatic vertebrates, and evolved to lie in one chromosome by chromosomal fusion in higher mammals (Fig. 4A). The syntenic relationship of IR-IFITM genes and the presence of more IR-IFITM genes in mammals than other vertebrates suggest that IR-IFITM gene sub-family experienced a rapid expansion via tandem duplication during evolution from lower vertebrates to mammals.",

IFITM5 is involved in bone formation and considered as a bone-specific modulator of mineralization. The vertebrate IFITM5 genes form an independent clade in IFITM family (Fig. 2A). Neither gene duplication nor positive selection was identified in IFITM5 sub-family (Fig. 6B and Table 3), implying the functional conservation of IFITM5 in vertebrate evolution. Interestingly, no IFITM5 gene was found in the genomic data of two primate species, gorilla and marmoset. Gorilla has a close phylogenetic relationship with human and chimpanzee. In human and chimpanzee, IFITM5 is located upstream of the IFITM1-IFITM2-IFITM3 gene-cluster in chromosome 11. IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3 in gorilla are also located in chromosome 11, and form a similar gene-cluster to those of human and chimpanzee (Fig. 4). Therefore, gorilla is also presumed to have an IFITM5 gene upstream of the IFITM1-IFITM2-IFITM3 gene-cluster. In fact, we found a region with incomplete sequencing at the corresponding locus of human or chimpanzee IFITM5 genes in chromosome 11 of gorilla, explaining why we could not identify IFITM5 gene locus in current gorilla genome dataset. In contrast, marmoset has special IFITM gene organization and experienced rapid gene expansion, thus forming unique species-specific gene cluster (Fig. 3). Considering that marmoset is one of the smallest monkeys in the world, as well as that IFITM5 plays a crucial role in bone formation [19], [36], we inferred that marmoset most likely lost its IFITM5 during the long period of evolution. Nevertheless, whether the loss of IFITM5 gene contributes to the tiny size of the marmoset needs to be determined by future studies.",

The other one contains IFITM10 from aquatic vertebrates, as well as four frog IFITM10-like genes. Significant signal of functional divergence was observed between the two sub-groups (Table 2), possibly suggesting an association with terrestrial and aquatic environments. In particular, both gene duplication and positive selection can be detected in IFITM10 or IFITM10-like genes from the aquatic vertebrates (Fig. 6D and Table 3), indicating that IFITM10 is associated with the adaptation to aquatic environments. There are one IFITM10 gene and four IFITM10-like genes in frog (Fig. 2C). An episodic adaptive evolution was found on the branch leading to three frog IFITM10-like genes (Fig. S6), supporting the association of IFITM10 with terrestrial and/or aquatic environments.

Apart from these biological functions, human IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3 have a broad-spectrum of antiviral activity, possibly brought on by inhibiting the viral entry processes [14], [18], [39]. In particular, human IFITM3 and IFITM2 appear to have higher antiviral activity than IFITM1 [14] and IFITM3 has been reported to inhibit virus replication in other mammals [40].

The species-specific pattern mainly seems to have occurred in macaque and marmoset, giving rise to seven IFITM2&3-like genes in macaque and 29 IR-IFITM genes in marmoset (Fig. 3). Large scale of duplication and pseudogenization events suggest that the IR-IFITM clade evolved under birth-and-death model [41], [42]. Interestingly, however, marmoset does not possess any one of IFITM1, IFITM2 or IFITM3, and macaque possesses IFITM1 but not IFITM2 and IFITM3. Why marmoset and macaque evolved so many IR-IFITM genes remains unclear and should be explored in more detail in future studies.",

We detected positive selection acting on marmoset IR-IFITM genes (Table 3). Macaque and marmoset are susceptible to infection by many contemporary viruses and are often used as suitable non-human primate models for viral infectious disease studies [9], [43]\u2013[58]. Cell lines (e.g. kidney cells) from marmoset can be infected by most primate viruses, such as flaviviridae family of viruses (GBV-B), lassa virus, peste des petitis ruminants (PPR) virus and so on [59], [60], [61]. These imply that marmoset and macaque might be able to be infected by the ancestors of contemporary primate viruses and/or some unknown viruses during early evolution of primates. Additionally, relative to pig IFITM3 that has been demonstrated to have an antiviral activity [40], IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3 genes from macaque and marmoset have higher similarity to human IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3 in sequence and domain organization. These imply that although lacking experimental support, the IR-IFITM genes from macaque and marmoset might have similar antiviral activity to human IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3. Therefore, the rapid expansion of IR-IFITM genes might be ascribed to the infection of marmosets by viruses.",

To avoid the possible error in pseudogene identification, the PSEDOPIPE approach (http://pseudofam.pseudogene.org/pages/main/about.jsf) [63] was further used to confirm identified IFITM pseudogenes. On the other hand, because authentic IFITM proteins are in a range of 102 to 157 amino acids [2], the candidates that are outside above range and have complete open reading frame, complete CD225 domain and the C-terminal TMD were identified as functional genes and referred to as IFITM-like genes.",

Type I sites represent amino acids conservation in one cluster, but high variability in another, suggesting that these residues have been subjected to different functional constraints. The coefficient of functional divergence, \u03b8, ranging from 0 to 1, was used to test the statistical significance of functional divergence that has occurred between different clusters. A null hypothesis of \u03b8 = 0 indicates that the evolutionary rate is virtually the same between two clusters at each site.
