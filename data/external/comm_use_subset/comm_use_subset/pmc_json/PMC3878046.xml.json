However, kidney infection has not been compared between MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and no post-mortem investigations on patients who succumbed to MERS-CoV have been done. To assess the potential role of kidney affection in MERS-CoV infection, we reviewed all peer-reviewed or communicated reports on MERS cases for information on kidney involvement.

The broad search term was chosen due to inconsistencies of nomenclature before the consensus name MERS-CoV was announced [13].",

All identified publications were reviewed in order to identify clinical descriptions of MERS-CoV infection that included information on kidney function, irrespective of whether they were pointing to normal or impaired function. In cases where two reports on the same patient were available, only the report with the more detailed clinical description was selected. From all identified reports, we extracted information on patient sex and age, country of patient origin and travel route, onset of illness, presence or absence of ARF, date of onset of ARF, day of illness on which ARF occurred, as well as clinical outcome (death or survival). Among 21 publications describing a total of 111 MERS-CoV patients (double-reporting of the same patients could not be excluded), a total of 7 publications were identified that specifically addressed kidney function [2,3,5-7,14,15]. In these 7 publications, a total of 12 MERS patients were described with disease onset dates ranging from April 2012 to March 2013 (Table 1). All patients were male with a mean age of 47 years (range 25\u201373 years), originating from Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar, including imported cases to the United Kingdom (UK), Germany and France. Nine of those 12 patients (75%) developed ARF during the acute course of MERS-CoV infection. For 6 of those 9 patients, dates of onset of ARF were available, suggesting a median time of 11 days (SD \u00b12,0 days) from first symptoms to onset of ARF. Six of 9 (67%) patients with ARF had a fatal outcome, while one of three patients without ARF died. However, the differences found for the fatality rates in cases with and without ARF during MERS-CoV infection were not statistically significant.",

As summarized in Figure 2, primary cells up to passage 4 were seeded at densities of 4x105/mL and inoculated with either MERS-CoV strain EMC/2012, or SARS-CoV strain Frankfurt-1 at multiplicities of infection (MOI) of 0.5 for 1 hour. Cells were washed twice and supernatants were harvested immediately after washing, as well as 20 and 40 hours later. Cells were checked regularly for appearance of cytopathic effects (CPE) by light microscopy. Replication of both viruses was quantified by titration of supernatants in duplicate plaque assays on Vero cells as described previously, as well as by real-time RT-PCR [9,16].",

Virus replication was nevertheless detectable by real time RT-PCR in all experiments, confirming successful infection (Figure 1D). The CPE in HREpCs consisted of rounding and detachment of cells, leading to cell death in the majority of cells already after 20 hours. Comparative quantification of infectious virus production between SARS- and MERS-CoV showed that MERS-CoV replicates to high titers in HREpC with almost 1000-fold higher concentrations of infectious MERS-CoV progeny than in HBEpCs.

In a retrospective analysis of 536 SARS cases, only in 36 (6.7%) patients acute renal impairment was diagnosed. ARF occurred rather late in the course of disease after a median of 20 days from the appearance of first symptoms [17]. In our literature review of MERS cases, ARF occurred much earlier, namely in 6 of 9 sufficiently-described patients after a median of 11 days. To date, it is difficult to compare these clinical data with experiences from animal models. The only animal that exhibits clinical signs similar to human MERS-CoV infection is the rhesus macaque, but none of the available studies reported kidney failure in macaques [18-20]. Only very small amounts of viral RNA were detected in kidney tissue, and none in urine. Macaques might be of limited value for the study of MERS-CoV-specific kidney pathology as seen in humans.",

            "text": "While no autopsy data have become available for patients infected with MERS-CoV, post-mortem studies have been done systematically in SARS victims. Histopathological findings revealed mainly acute tubular necrosis without evidence of glomerular pathology, which is considered to be a consequence of systemic inflammatory response in the context of multi-organ failure, rather than a specific effect of viral infection of the kidney [17]. SARS-CoV has never been successfully isolated from post mortem kidney tissue of infected patients [21]. In-vitro studies of SARS-CoV with immortalized human proximal tubular epithelial cells showed replication without cell impairment as seen in our study, while no infection of podocyte cell lines and only low-level replication in glomerular mesangial cells (MC) was seen, providing further evidence against specific involvement of the renal tract in SARS-CoV infection [22]. In contrast, MERS-CoV was shown to efficiently replicate in a broad range of bat, primate and also human kidney epithelial cell lines that are commonly used as laboratory models [9]. The abundant expression of both viruses\u2019 entry receptors in kidney epithelium argues against receptor-dependent limitations to viral kidney tropism. Specific interference of MERS-CoV with the induction of the interferon response provides one of many possible explanations for an increased capacity of MERS-CoV to replicate in kidney cells [23]. The clear differences in viral permissiveness of primary kidney epithelial cells suggest these cells to be appropriate models for the identification of host-specific restriction factors in the future. We are aware that cell culture resembles a limited model of viral infection which will not reflect the complexity of infection in-vivo. Nevertheless, our results have some congruence with clinical observations in a well-investigated MERS case [5]. Virus in the urine has been detected as late as day 12 of illness, albeit at low concentrations. Virus was detected in the urine but not in the blood, which could indicate autonomous virus replication in the kidneys. Of note, by using a model to assess the ability of CoVs to persist in the environment, it was shown that MERS-CoV has similarities to viruses that are transmitted via the fecal-oral route [24]. The authors suggest that this could hint for oral-urine transmission of MERS-CoV. Further data on virus shedding in the urine over the course of disease are urgently needed. If the kidney should indeed constitute a site of primary virus replication, shedding of virus in the urine might provide a possible source for human-to-human transmission, especially in health-care settings or among close family contacts [3,6,7]. Clinical guidelines should consider the possibility that MERS patients may benefit from early induction of renoprotective treatment.",
