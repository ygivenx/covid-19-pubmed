Sequence analysis suggests that these coronaviral strains can be classified into three main groups \u2013 alphacoronavirus (group 1), betacoronavirus (group 2), and gamacoronavirus (group 3) [12]. The sequence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), discovered in 2003, was found to be diverse from any existing groups of CoVs. The group 2 CoVs are then further divided into 2a and 2b sub-groups, with the original group 2 CoVs assigned to group 2a and SARS-CoV to group 2b [13], [14]. Most of coronaviral strains are group 1 and 2a members. They include the four human coronaviruses (HCoVs) strains, NL63, 229E, OC43 and HKU1, that associate with up to 5% of total respiratory tract disease cases [15], [16]. The most infamous strain in group 3 is infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which can cause lethal infections in birds [17], [18].",

The cleavage process can be acted in cis and in trans [19]. This enzyme is a good drug target for anti-coronaviral infection, as inhibiting the autocleavage process can inhibit viral replication and reduce virus-induced cytopathic effects on host cells [20], [21], [22], [23]. A detailed knowledge of substrate specificity of 3CLpro is helpful in the rational design of inhibitors. Substrate specificity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro was extensively investigated after the outbreak of SARS in 2003. Fan et al. measured the protease activity against 34 single-substituted variants at P5 to P1' positions, while Goetz et al. profiled the specificity at P4 to P1 positions by using a fully degenerated library of tetrapeptide mixtures [24], [25]. Chuck et al. profiled the substrate preference of SARS-CoV 3CLpro by measuring the activity of 3CLpro against substrate variants with single substitutions at P5 to P3' positions [26].",

The values of kobs/[3CLpro] of the proteases against this WT sequence were 443\u00b111, 124\u00b113, 180\u00b15 and 174\u00b119 mM-1 min-1 for HCoV-NL63 (group 1), HCoV-OC43 (group 2a), SARS-CoV (group 2b), and IBV (group 3), respectively. That all proteases can cleave the WT sequence efficiently justifies that we can use our substrate library to profile the substrate specificities of 3CLpro from other groups of CoVs. Based on the FRET assay we developed, we measured the activities of 3CLpro from HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV and IBV against the 19\u00d78 substrate variants (Figure 1, Table S1) [26]. To identify the structural basis of substrate preferences for different CoVs, the protease activities were correlated with side chain volume [28], hydrophobicity [29], and \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-sheet propensities [30] as described [26]. The correlations were quantified in terms of correlation coefficients and p-values (Figure 2, Table S2).",

Interestingly, our results showed that 3CLpro from all groups of CoVs can cleave His at P1 position reasonably well.

In the crystal structure of SARS-CoV 3CLpro in complex with a peptide substrate, the P5 residue adopts an extended \u03b2-strand conformation to avoid clashing of P5-P6 residues with the protease [31]. Residues with high \u03b2-sheet propensity may stabilize the extended conformation at P5 and improve enzyme-substrate interaction. As shown in Figure 1, a number of substitutions at P5 position resulted in a substrate better than the WT sequence (i.e. with relative activity >1). Consistent with the suggestion that P5 position favors residues with high hydrophobicity and \u03b2-sheet propensity, Val-substitution consistently yielded substrates with higher than WT activities for all 3CLpro.

This results in a wider substrate-binding pocket in IBV 3CLpro. We further docked the substrate variant A4P into the substrate-binding pocket of IBV 3CLpro. Due to the cyclic structure of Pro residue, the backbone \u00d8 dihedral angle of the P4 residue is restrained to ca. \u221260\u00b0, which causes the substrate peptide to bend towards the strand-11 of 3CLpro. Such conformation of substrate is much better accommodated by IBV 3CLpro, which has a wider substrate-binding pocket near the P4 and P5 positions.

A broad-spectrum inhibitor is desirable for a first line defense against coronaviral infection because CoVs are capable of generating novel strains with high virulence through high frequency of mutations and recombination [34], [35], [36], [37].. Based on the autocleavage sequence of SARS-CoV 3CLpro (i.e. AVLQ\u2193), Rao and co-workers designed broad-spectrum peptidomimetic inhibitors that can inhibit 3CLpro from different groups of CoVs [20]. Their results are consistent with our observation that the autocleavage sequence of SARS-CoV 3CLpro can be well cleaved by all 3CLpro. The substrate preferences profiled in this study will provide a rational basis to improve the broad-spectrum 3CLpro inhibitors. For example, by combining favorable substitutions at P3 to P5 positions, we identified a substrate sequence \u2018VARLQ\u2193SGF\u2019 that can be cleaved with high relative activities by 3CLpro from all groups of CoVs (Table 1). This substrate sequence may serve as a good starting point of the design of broad-spectrum peptidomimetic inhibitors for 3CLpro.",

Protein expression was induced by addition of 0.1 mM of isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside. After overnight incubation at 25\u00b0C, cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in buffer A (20 mM Tris, pH 7.8, 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine) with 30 mM imidazole and disrupted by sonication. Soluble fraction was subject to immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography for purification as described for SARS-CoV 3CLpro\n[26]. The His6-SUMO or His6-MBP tags were removed by protease digestion using sentrin-specific protease 1 or factor Xa, respectively, followed by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography.
