Due to lack of therapeutics against majority of viruses, there is always a need to develop more effective antiviral agents [2]. Lately, RNA interference (RNAi) has emerged as a potential therapeutic tool for targeting human viruses. RNAi or gene silencing is a process by which sequence-specific degradation of mRNA takes place [3]. In this process, long dsRNA precursors are chopped into shorter (19\u201323 resides) units by a ribonuclease enzyme called dicer. These short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) possess two terminal nucleotide 3\u2032 overhangs. After that a ribonucleoprotein machinery called RNA induced silencing complex (RISC) incorporates one of the siRNA strands and cleaves the complementary target mRNA using ATP [4].",

Also, siRNAs targeting the influenza virus nucleocapsid and RNA transcriptase genes restricted its transcription and replication [9,10]. Similarly, siRNAs directed against the Hepatitis B virus surface regions prevented the virus production [11]. siRNAs employed against SARS-CoV envelope and genes were able to effectively block their expression [12]. In another study, siRNAs targeting Dengue virus genes were able to impede the viral infection [13]. In addition, siRNAs have been shown to curb many other viruses like Human papillomavirus (HPV) [14], West Nile virus (WNV) [15] etc.",

It can target diverse types of viral genomes, whether it be double/single stranded DNA or RNA, which make it a suitable candidate for broad-spectrum antiviral therapy [16]. Also, siRNA aims at small length of the target mRNA instead of a functional domain of a protein, therefore, even a small viral genome can lend many targetable regions [5]. Further, many siRNAs may be expressed simultaneously to increase inhibition in a coordinated manner [17]. They are also harnessed to degrade mRNAs which generate disease causing proteins [6]. siRNA based drugs have also entered the clinical trials for various human diseases e.g. kidney disorders, LDL lowering, ocular/retinal disorders, cancer and viral diseases [18]. Specifically for Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), ALN-RSV01 has completed Phase II trial. Yet another drug named SPC3649, developed by Santaris Pharma targets Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and was also under Phase II clinical trial [19,20]. Many researchers have further reviewed the importance of RNAi in inhibiting viral infections [20,21].",

The best performing hybrid model with frequency-binary-thermo feature vectors gave a correlation of 0.50 and thus performed better on the validation dataset. Other machine learning techniques performed in a similar trend but their correlation was less as compared to SVM.

Our model employed various siRNA sequence features particularly nucleotide frequencies, binary patterns, thermodynamic features, secondary structure and their hybrids as these parameters play a vital role in predicting efficient viral siRNAs. Mononucleotide composition can, for example, account for GC contents separately while higher nucleotide compositions can account for presence of any long GC stretch. Similarly trinucleotide composition can be useful in codon preference considerations. Studies have suggested that thermodynamic features of nucleotides at the beginning and at the end of the siRNA strands are important to their potency [53]. An increase in Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) from 0.19 to 0.55 was observed using different approaches. The increase in performance could be attributed to the fact that as we increase the length of siRNA fragment (e.g., from 4 patterns in mono to 1024 patterns in pentanucleotide frequencies) more and more input information is available for processing not only in terms of composition but also other features like base stacking and positional effect to a significant extent. However secondary structural features of nucleotides showed minimal performance during training and were thus not included in the final model. Hence, the sequence frequencies combined with binary and thermodynamic features as hybrid approach we could achieve a maximum PCC of 0.58 during LOOCV. Thus, individual siRNA features provide marginal but cumulative increase in the probability of selecting a potent siRNA which is consistent with previous findings [32,33].",

Since viruses are known to be genetically diverse [54] some variation in performance is expected, however, the hybrid features allow different siRNA features to complement each other during the training process, which eventually makes the efficacy prediction better than when the features are used individually. LOVOCV performances are similar to that of PCC (0.55 and 0.50) of 10-fold cross validation of T1380 training and V345 validation datasets using best hybrid siRNA features reported in Table 1. Despite exclusion of individual virus siRNAs from the training dataset, SVM model predicts siRNA appropriately for that particular virus. Therefore, VIRsiRNApred would function as a general viral siRNA efficacy predictor even for viruses currently not included in the training and testing. Besides, we also checked the performance of general mammalian siRNA predictors (siRNApred and siExplorer) on the above datasets and their performance PCC ranged from 0.10 to 0.16 only. This again accentuate that VIRsiRNApred perform competently for prediction viral siRNA efficacy.",

It could be because of high viral genome heterogeneity. Besides that the researchers often target a particular viral strain and the target site may not be conserved among all other strains. However conservation analysis of highly and least effective siRNAs showed that number highly effective siRNAs are more in the fully conserved regions (0 mismatch) whereas the number of ineffective siRNAs is more in the least conserved regions (>4 mismatches). This suggests that siRNAs selected in the conserved regions tend to be more effective. However siRNAs designed from highly conserved virus genome regions as available in our experimental dataset display all ranges of siRNA inhibition efficacies ranging from 0-100%. This implies that not all siRNAs chosen from conserved regions are highly effective as many other factors like nucleotide frequencies, binary and thermodynamics features etc. contribute to the efficacy of a siRNA besides conservation as used in the VIRsiRNApred development. Nevertheless, selecting potential siRNAs from conserved genome regions is advantageous as it will target multiple viral strains.",
