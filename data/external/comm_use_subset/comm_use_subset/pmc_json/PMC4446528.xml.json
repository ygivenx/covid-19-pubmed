Such metrics, from now on referred as homology-independent (HI) metrics, can be easily calculated for virtually any fragment of any genome that fulfills a few criteria, such as minimum length and complexity. These metrics usually detect biases by comparing the observed frequencies of nucleotide words, especially dinucleotide and codons, with expected frequencies for the same words. The dinucleotide usage patterns in a given genome are commonly referred in the scientific literature as genomic signatures, since they are also taxon-specific and highly conserved in a given genome [12\u201314]. Here we also highlight the relative strengths and weaknesses of such metrics and report comparative genomic studies that applied such metrics to extract biologically meaningful information that would be otherwise impossible to obtain using common HD comparative genomic methods.",

In fact, several nucleotide motifs (such as the \u201cTATA box\u201d) interact with the transcription/translation machinery and are classic examples of conservation of nucleotide words in genomic sequences due to selection pressure [18]. Another classic cause of variation in nucleotide words (codons) induced by selection pressure is the more-than-expected usage of synonymous codons that corresponds to the more abundant aminoacyl-tRNAs in cell cytoplasm in order to increase translation speed/efficiency, a selection pressure particularly strong in single-celled organisms [19] and in highly-expressed genes [20]. A final broad class of factors known to influence the use of nucleotide words in genomes is the occurrence of neutral processes such as genetic drift during the course of evolution [21]. Therefore, if properly modeled and interpreted, the results obtained through HI metrics in comparative genomic studies can highlight broad patterns of mutational and selective forces as well as random variations acting in the genomes under analysis.",

An interesting property is that most HI metrics contain null models that take into account major factors already known to influence the frequencies of nucleotide words. Different HI metrics consider factors such as GC content, observed frequencies of smaller words that compose the word under analysis, degeneracy of the genetic code and amino acid usage, among others, when calculating null models. Therefore, any bias detected using HI metrics with proper null models is not explainable by factors already taken into account when computing null models, and represent biological phenomena that require further explanation/investigation. Also, several HI metrics are pervasive in the sense that values for whole genomes should persist at smaller scales. Some HI metrics remain reasonably constant for fragments with as few as 125 base pairs when compared with values calculated for entire genomes, or even when comparing coding and non-coding regions of genomes, making HI metrics a robust option to develop procedures to classify nucleotide sequences to taxonomic units, as in the case of genomic signatures [13].",

The patterns of DOR and codon usage bias in complete genomes of prokaryotes present a strong correlation with phylogenetic trees of 16S ribosomal RNA and housekeeping genes [14,23]. Comparative genomics using HI metrics may better reflect the global phylogenetic relationships between complete genomes by considering, for instance, events of horizontal transfer (HGT, one of the many factors known to change local frequencies of nucleotide words in genomic sequences) as part of the evolutionary signal in opposition to the reductionist analysis of single genes as proxies to faithfully represent the phylogenetic history of the entire genome.",

However, using longer DNA words as genomic signatures adds more dimensions to compare and stratify sequence data (e.g. there are, respectively, 16, 64, 256 and 1024 different DNA words of lengths 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively).

The authors observed that the two host groups possess very distinctive dinucleotide and codon usage patterns. A pronounced CpG under-representation was found in the vertebrate group, possibly induced by the methylation-deamination process, exclusive of vertebrate genomes, as well as a prominent TpA decrease. The invertebrate group displayed only a TpA frequency reduction bias, with no CpG bias. Flaviviridae viruses mimicked host nucleotide motif usage in a host-specific manner. Vertebrate-infecting viruses possessed under-representation of CpG and TpA, and insect-only viruses displayed only a TpA under-representation bias. Especially, single-host Flaviviridae members which persistently infect mammals or insect hosts (Hepacivirus and insect-only Flavivirus, respectively) were found to possess a codon usage profile more similar to that of their hosts than to phylogenetically related Flaviviridae. Vertebrates and mosquito genomes are under very distinct lineage-specific constraints, and Flaviviridae viruses which specifically infect these lineages appear to be subject to the same evolutionary pressures that shaped their host coding regions, evidencing lineage-specific coevolutionary processes between viral and host genomes that could not be surveyed using HD metrics.",

Besides being used for their original purpose (classification of biological sequences to a taxonomic space), several other layers of biologically meaningful information are available through these metrics. In common, all these metrics are: 1) calculated from genomic sequence data alone; 2) do not rely on homology inference and 3) add a new layer of biologically meaningful data to the genomes under analysis, such as taxonomic information in the case of genomic signatures, but also other information such as putative gene expression profiles and convergent coevolutionary patterns.",

For this reason, we argue that these metrics are better described as homology-independent (HI) metrics for comparative genomics. Genomic sequences from disparate groups that contain some niche superposition, such distinct species of microorganisms belonging to the same ecological community or viruses and their respective hosts coexisting in the same environment, were found to possess surprising patterns of coevolutionary events not known before HI metrics were applied to investigate them. The use of HI metrics as tools for comparative genomic analysis, if correctly understood and applied, can reveal important pieces of biological information in genomic sequences without priorhomology inference.",
