            "text": "Introduction: Mechanical Insufflation-Exsufflation (MI-E) by using a specific device is commonly used to increase weak cough, as in patients with chronic neuromuscular weakness or in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with ICU-acquired neuro-myopathy. The assessment of the efficacy of MI-E device is commonly done by measuring peak cough flow (PCF). Upper airways collapse is frequently associated with neuromuscular disease and may compromise MI-E efficacy. Tracheomalacia is another disease that may impede PCF to increase with MI-E device. The goal of present study was to carry out a bench study to assess the effect of MI-E on PCF with and without the presence of a collapsible tube. Our hypothesis was that PCF was lower with than without collapsible tube.",

For each C-R combination, we set \u00b1 30, \u00b1 40 and \u00b1 50 cmH2O inspiratory expiratory pressure at the MI-E device. MI-E device was set in automatic mode with inspiratory time of 3 s, expiratory time of 3.2 s and pause of 2 s. Each set was recorded by using a data logger (Biopac 150, Biopac inc.) and the last 5 cycles were used for the analysis done by using Acqknowledge software (Biopac inc.). The peak expiratory flow during the first 100 ms after onset of expiration was taken as the surrogate of PCF. The corresponding pressure was also recorded.",

Physiotherapists may also follow the larynx movements (in coronal and sagittal planes) evaluating the displacement of the hyoid bone (6). A decrease in the hyoid bone displacement and contraction of the tongue may explain a dysphagia (7).

All patients with both severe (KDIGO 3) and non-severe AKI (KDIGO stage 1, 2) were enrolled. Patients with prior CKD were excluded. The primary outcome was the 3-years prevalence of CKD (defined by estimated glomerular filtration rate lower than 60 mL/min 1.73m2) in the non-severe AKI group. Secondary outcomes were risk factors for 3-years CKD, renal survival during follow-up and to identify the proportion among CKD patients followed by a nephrologist. Renal recovery was defined as return of creatinine at ICU discharge to < 26.5 \u00b5mol L above baseline.",

In the early strategy, RRT was started within 6 h after randomization criteria. In the delayed one, RRT was initiated only if one or more following criteria occurred- severe hyperkalemia, severe acidosis, severe pulmonary edema due to fluid overload resulting in severe hypoxemia, oligo-anuria > 72 h or serum urea concentration > 40 mmol/L. We assessed long-term (> 2 years) outcomes of the patients who survived 60 days after randomization. We collected vital status, last renal function value and health-related quality of life.

While diaphragm electrical activity has been proposed as a valuable tool to assess inspiratory effort, it requires a dedicated tool, namely the NAVA (Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist) catheter that is not widely available. By contrast, the use of ultrasound to evaluated diaphragm contractile activity has been growing in the ICU. However, the relationship between diaphragm contractility activity, i.e. diaphragm thickening fraction (TFdi) and diaphragm electrical activity (EAdi) has not been explored so far. Our hypothesis was that TFdi correlates with EAdi. In the present study, we sought to investigate the correlation between TFdi and EAdi through several conditions of ventilatory assistance.",

First-line aminoglycosides were distributed into amikacin (61%), gentamicin (37%) and tobramycin (2%). Patients receiving aminoglycoside combination therapy were more frequently immunocompromised (40.4% vs. 31.84%, p = 0.005), had more positive blood cultures (39.1% vs. 25%, p < 0.0001) and had a higher creatininemia at admission (144 [95 + 228] vs. 131 [80 + 201] \u03bcmol L, p = 0.007).

Of these, 121 had an underlying immune defect and were ultimately included. Two third of the patients had hematological malignancy, chiefly non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (37%), and acute leukemia (21%). Respectively, 10% and 7% of included patients underwent autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantations. Most patients had one or more risk factors of candidemia. During ICU stay, 91 (75%) patients needed invasive mechanical ventilation, 71 (61%) patients needed renal replacement therapy, and 91 (75%) patients needed vasopressors. One out of five patients (21%) was considered as emergency surgery patients. Candida albicans (54%) was the predominant specie, followed by glabrata (19%), tropicalis (11%), parapsilosis (7%) and krusei (7%). One third of identified Candida was resistant to Fluconazole (30%) and 8% to Echinocandins. ICU mortality was 52% and hospital mortality was 60%. Candida specie or susceptibility was not associated with outcome (figure). Median time from feature of candidemia onset to first antifungal therapy was 3 (1\u20133) days. After adjustment for confounders, need for vasopressors (HR- 1.8 + CI95%- 1.1\u20133.1), need for mechanical ventilation (HR- 2.0 CI95%- 1.1\u20133.8) and allogeneic stem cell transplantation (HR- 2.5 + CI95%- 1.1\u20136.0) were independently associated with hospital mortality. Half the patients (58%) developed candidemia more than 24 h after ICU admission and 42% were admitted in ICU for severe candidemia.

We confirmed the impact of some previously described risk factors (i.e. septic shock, multifocal colonization, SOFA score, hospital stay before ICU, parenteral nutrition, corticosteroids, blood transfusion, mechanical ventilation and surgery). Those risks were differently associated with candidemia and IVC. Some variables such as corticosteroids therapy, blood transfusion and mechanical ventilation were only associated with candidemia. Risks were time dependent with some having more impact on early state (landmark time < 5) or on late onset (landmark time > day 5). Antibiotherapy (broad spectrum, piperacillin-tazobactam), number of PPI days of use and a medical history of cancer were only associated with IVC after landmark time 5.

Higher physician scores were significantly associated with the following factors- availability of a dedicated information room, joint family information with the nurse, total rather than partial family information, joint implementation with the nurse of the decision to withdrawing withholding therapies, open visiting policy. Higher scores were also associated with patients\u2019 characteristics- McCabe \u2264 1, not immunocompromised, no dementia, no liver failure, no haematological disease and no use of psychotropic medication.

Causes of acute respiratory failure were sepsis (48%), pulmonary flare-up (28%) and miscellaneous (24%). Fifty-five patients (77%) required mechanical ventilation, 38 patients (53%) vasoactive drugs and 24 (34%) renal replacement therapy. One patient had an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Occurrence of severe, moderate and mild ARDS was 39%, 21%, 28% respectively. Thirty-seven survived at hospital discharge and 24 one year later. By univariate analysis, the following factors were significantly associated with mortality- ICU admission SAPS II (p = 0.009), PaO2/FiO2 ratio (p = 0.007), vasoactive drugs (p = 0.01) and mechanical ventilation requirement (p = 0.02). Among these factors, multivariate analysis showed that only low PaO2 FiO2 ratio (OR 3.63, 95% CI [3.59\u2013298.74]) was associated with one year- mortality.",

Biological assessment revealed lower platelet levels (p = 0.001) and lower P F ratio in the early group (p = 0.008). Our study showed that early PE was associated with more transfusions (p = 0.002) and surgical treatment measures (p = 0.023). The incidence of long bone fractures in lower extremities was higher in those with early PE compared with the other patients (p = 0.039). Using the multivariable logistic regression model, higher age (p = 0.028), SOFA score (p = 0.013), BMI over thirty (p = 0.002), and the use of surgical treatment measures (p = 0.046) were predictive of early timing of PE in trauma patients.

For each patient, four EIT-based PEEP were defined- PEEP ODCLmin (pressure with the lowest EIT-assessed collapse lung [CL] and overdistension [OD]), PEEP ODCL15 (the lowest pressure able to limit EIT-assessed collapse below 15% with the least overdistension), PEEP Comp (PEEP with the EIT-based compliance maximum), and PEEP GI (PEEP with EIT-based global inhomogeneity (GI) index minimum).

Twelve patients (40%) presented one or more complications related to the PP. The most common complication was decubitus ulcers in 27% of cases. The comparaison between responders and non responders to PP shows no differences in demographic characteristics, co morbidities and PaO2 FIO2.

The scale was printed on a label and stuck on the back of the care sheet. All children were to be screened twice a day over a two-month period.

Monte Carlo simulations were performed to provide the highest probability of reaching the target of 50% fT > MIC and 100% fT > MIC depending on renal function. Continuous infusion (both 60 and 120 mg kg per day) seemed to be the best dosing regimen for high MIC value (> 4 mg L) without risk of accumulation except in children with severe renal failure without CRRT. Usual dosing regimens (20 mg kg 8 h over 20 min) are adequate for only patients with a severe renal failure regardless of the MIC value.",

One patient out of two had sequelae in at least 2 of the 3 domains of post intensive care syndrome. Only 1 patient (3%) had no sequelae at all (Figure 1). Fifteen patients were reevaluated 3 months after discharge, showing a global improvement in their status but with persistent deficiencies.

This test has been proved to be feasible and fast to do in university hospitals or university affiliated teaching hospitals. It would be of high value to confirm this in a non-university ICU. The main outcome of this study was the predictive ability of E-PRE-DELIRIC to diagnose delirium. Therefore, a correlation between a positive E-PRE-DELIRIC score (> or = 50%) and an ICDSC score < or = 4 (Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist) was searched. In a subsequent analysis, the performance of E-PRE-DELERIC was used in the cardiac surgery vs other patients. We also compared the abilities of E-PRE-DELERIC and APACHE II score to predict delirium.",

The PSL was decreased by steps of 2 cmH2O from 20 to 6 cmH2O. Flow, airway and esophageal pressures, and electrical impedance tomography (EIT) signals were continuously recorded during the titration. P0.1 was measured at each step. Indices of respiratory effort, including muscle pressure (Pmus) and esophageal pressure\u2013time product (PTPes) were derived from recorded signals. The calculated Pmus (Pmuscalc) and PTPes were computed using the equation of motion of the respiratory system and respiratory mechanics previously collected while patients were under controlled ventilation.",

Vt values remained relatively stable during normal or underassisted efforts (PTPes above 50 cmH2O.s.min-1) and increased dramatically in case of overassistance (PTPes below 50 cmH2O.s.min-1) (Figure 1). The Pmuscalcl calculated at peak inspiratory flow correlated with the actual peak of Pmus (r = 0.34 + p < 0.0001). In addition, P0.1 seemed better correlated with Pmus (r = 0.76 + p < 0.0001) than Pmuscalcl. Definitive results, including EIT assessment, will be presented at the meeting.",

After multivariate Cox analysis including initial oxygenation strategy, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score without respiratory item, PaO2 FiO2 ratio < 100 at ICU admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, pattern of chest X ray and etiology of ARF, higher BMI was significantly associated with lower mortality rate (Adjusted HR (aHR) = 0.98(0.97\u20131.00), P = 0.02). No centre effect was observed. Two BMI groups were separated- low (< 28 kg/m2) and high (BMI \u2265 28 kg/m2), the adjusted risk of dying being lower in the high BMI (\u2265 28 kg/m2) group compared to the low BMI (< 28 kg/m2) group- (aHR = 0.81(0.65\u20131.00), P = 0.05).

The analysis of the 47 questionnaires filled in by 5 doctors, 6 residents, 29 nurses and 10 nurse aids shows global satisfaction regarding the organization, duration, exchanges and consideration of the participants\u2019 opinions. While nurse aids are often absent from the deliberations and show moderate implication in the decision making, their contribution on very specific aspects of individual care is desired by other healthcare professionals. Caregivers also deplore the limited involvement of an external consultant whose role would be to provide neutral expertise on the patient\u2019s conditions. Based on the examination of responses to the open-ended questions, it seems necessary to reposition the collegial procedure within a complex deliberative process which gradually leads, throughout the hospital stay, to contingent and revocable decisions of foregoing certain treatments deemed useless, disproportionate or having no other object than the artificial preservation of life.",

In France, its use has significantly increased during the last ten years, with two main modalities- the recreational snorting of cocaine hydrochloride and the inhalation of smoked \u201ccrack\u201d (free-base form of cocaine, obtained by cocaine salification using common baking soda or ammoniac) in highly dependent and dissocialized users. The neurological, cardiovascular, respiratory and metabolic complications of cocaine are relatively well-known + however, differences between cocaine hydrochloride and crack-related toxicities have been poorly investigated. Our objectives were to describe and compare the circumstances and the resulting complications of cocaine use in the patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in relation to the route of exposure, i.e. snorting versus inhalation.",

Both AKIKI and IDEAL-ICU showed no mortality difference between an early and delayed RRT strategy. Pending results of STARRT-AKI (which is ongoing), the bulk of evidence suggests that, in the absence of severe complications of AKI, delaying RRT is safe. Duration of anuria and serum urea concentration were among criteria mandating RRT in the delayed strategy of AKIKI. The validity of such criteria is open to debate. We designed a study that compares the AKIKI \u201cdelayed strategy\u201d with a further delayed one.",

All eligible personnel (n = 58) were included in SNA survey. Team members reported the frequency (0 to 10 + times) of professional discussion with every other coworker during the last 48-hours. To examine the structure of the network, density, degree and betweenness centralization, degree and betweenness centrality were calculated. Scores range from 0 to 100%. Higher Value indicated, the more dense, more centralized is the network, and most central are team member in the network respectively. We examined the homophily of the network using E-I index (from -1to 1), where -1represented communication only between staff of different function and 1 communication only between staff with Similar function. P-value was obtained based on 1000 quadratic assignment procedure QAP permutations of the network. The network analysis was used to construct network maps using multidimentional scaling and generates a visual representation of networks through network diagrams.",

As a consequence, the administration of sodium bicarbonate, long considered as first-line therapy for acute hyperkalemia, was recently re-assessed for the treatment of either hyperkalemia. Regarding the high prevalence of hyperkalemia and acidemia in resuscitated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients, we share here our experience of severe acute type I lactic acidosis, the most frequent cause of metabolic acidosis in this setting.",

The circumstances of occurrence can be explained by-A dilution related to the infusion of hypotonic solution too abundant with a flow not monitored by our nurses due to lack of personnel. Prolonged preoperative fasting (more than 8 h) in our series that may be accompanied by hypovolemia responsible for the secretion of ADH, a component added to the iatrogenic factor.",

Uncontrolled inflammatory response in the lung is a key factor in the transition from pneumonia to ARDS. However, the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. To assess this, a heterogeneous population of T lymphocytes called \u201cunconventional T cells\u201d (UTC) deserves greater attention. These cells comprise Natural Killer T (NKT) cells, mucosal-associated invariant T cells (MAIT) and Gamma Delta T cells. Pre-clinical studies have shown their versatile properties and their key role in immune responses against invading pathogens. Thus, we hypothesize that a tight regulation of their functions is mandatory to fine-tune the host inflammatory response in the infected lungs, and, subsequently to prevent emergence of an aberrant response leading to tissue damages. Despite this strong rationale, human data are however lacking.",

In addition, circulating MAIT cells of patients expressed high levels of CD69 and PD-1 (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, the proportion of CD69 + MAIT cells decreased with clinical improvement, while proportion of PD-1 + remained stable.

The collapse (CL) is maximum at PEEP5 29% [21\u201345.8], and the distension is maximum at PEEP20cmH20 34% [24.5\u201340]. There is no significant difference between the different optimal PEEPs. The agreement is average between PEEPlung and optimal PEEP calculated from the EIT parameters (kappas 0.41 and 0.47). Our choice of PEEPlung is questionable because based on the global static respiratory compliance parameter that is measured on a single respiratory cycle. Measuring transpulmonary pressures could precise our measurements. PEPlung is statistically higher than the PEPheart + lung (p < 0.05), reflecting a bad hemodynamic tolerance of high levels of PEEP due to a complex phenomenon of heart\u2013lung interactions.",

To insure this, optimizing cardiac output is required and can be obtained, among others, by volume expansion.

Inferior vena cava (IVC) diameter variation is one of the several indicators proposed to predict fluid responsiveness. However, the efficacy of this indicator remains controversial.

Since the recent publications describing the benefits of using ultrasound-guided technique for subclavian-vein catheterization and the reduction of bloodstream infections in subclavian site compare to jugular and femoral sites, we have modified our central venous catheters insertion protocol. Instead of privileging femoral and jugular sites we decided to implement a new protocol where the operator considered the three sites of insertions (femoral, jugular and subclavian) taking into account the clinical parameters (coagulation disturbance, obesity\u2026) and the results of the ultrasound first look (visualization and diameter of the vein). The objective of our study was to compare the number of catheters placed in the subclavian position between the two periods and the rate of mechanical complications.",

On ICU admission, mean SAPSII was 30.7 \u00b1 11.7 and mean SOFA score was 5.6 \u00b1 2.8. Causes of trauma were dominated by traffic injury in 18 patients. Mean Glasgow Coma Scale score was 9.8 \u00b1 4 (median- 10). Extracranial injuries were found in 10 patients. The brain CT scan presented- subarachnoid hemorrhage in 19 patients, basilar skull fractures in 16 patients, cranial vault fractures in 15 patients, cerebral contusion in 16 patients, subdural hematoma in 10 patients, extradural hematoma in 7 patients and diffuse axonal injury in 7 patients. The CSTV was diagnosed fortuitously on full-body CT in 14 patients. In the other 8 cases- 2 were diagnosed on MRI and 5 in control CT angiography. The CSVT was located in the transverse sinuses in 15 patients, the internal jugular vein in 10 patients, the superior sagittal sinus in 4 patients and cavernous sinus in 2 patients. Intravenous unfractionated heparin was used in 17 patients with a mean dose of 161.7 mg \u00b1 54.5 mg per day (range 100\u2013300 mg). Low molecular weight heparin was used in 5 patients. The delay of anticoagulation was 3 \u00b1 1.4 days (range 0\u20136 days). The outcome was favorable in 20 patients.",

The training objectives were the improvement of individual and collective skills for DC strategies for management of terrorist attacks casualties. The tools selected for training concerned e-learning on a dedicated digital teaching platform (including a core section of 4 modules with types and mechanisms of injury, basic DC techniques, triage, organization of emergency medical response + and 2 complementary modules for doctors with DC resuscitation and DC surgery), hands-on workshops with procedural simulation and full scale simulation exercises, technical (tourniquets, hemostatic gauzes, needle thoracostomy, chest tube drainage, management of airway, coniotomy) and non-technical (leadership, communication, coordination and triage, decision-making, appropriate use of resources) skills.

TCD8 did not undergo any significant functional changes. Among NK cells, LPS induced an expansion of the cytotoxic CD11b + CD27 + and CD11b + CD27- subsets along with increased expression of the activation marker NKG2D. Tumor-infiltrating NK cells obtained from septic mice exhibited enhanced antitumoral properties. NK cells obtained from CLP-operated mice displayed increased expression of IFN-&#947 + . The behaviour of NK cells obtained from LPS-challenged mice was consistent with an active degranulation process, as suggested by increased CD107a membrane expression along with decreased intracellular expression of perforin and granzyme. MHC1 expression was low in MCA205 cells, similar to that in YAC-1 cells.

We subsequently realized a propensity score analysis including 40 matched patients, 20 in the NIV arm and 20 receiving other ventilation strategies, excluding initial MV patients. ICU mortality rate was significantly lower in patients treated with NIV (10%), versus 50% in patients receiving other ventilation strategies (p = 0.037).",

Twelve patients (25, 53%) had hepato-biliary imaging and the diagnosis of cholecystitis was retained only in one case. All patients had serology of hepatic viruses, they were all-negative except one. Fifty-nine episodes have been collected. Median number of hepatic dysfunction episodes per patient was one [1 + 2], ten patients had two episodes. Retained etiologies were- multifactorial in forty cases (sepsis, hypoxia, drug toxicity), sepsis in seven cases and drug toxicity in two cases. Compared to group control (25 patients), mortality was higher (34% vs 16%, p = 0.09) and length of stay was more prolonged (15 vs 13 days, p = 0.7) but the difference was not significant.",

Except carbapenems, these germs expressed high levels of resistance to almost all antibiotics- 11 of 12 were resistant to fluoroquinolones, also 11 12 to aminoglycosides and fosfomycin. The C3G resistance rate was 100%, and 50% of the strains were susceptible or intermediate to cefepime. Of these 12 isolates, 9 were sensitive or intermediate to the piperacillin-tazobactam and all were sensitive to aztreonam. All of these strains were sensitive to temocillin and the EDTA test was positive for 11 of 12. Eleven of these isolates had hyperproduced cephalosporinase, and one an ESBL.

While immune modulating diets (IMDs) containing nutrients displaying immunoregulating properties such as arginine are conceptually appealing, data from individual trials and several meta-analyses have failed to produce convincing results. Different studies found that early enteral administration of l-arginine to patients in ICU increased ornithine synthesis suggesting a preferential use by the arginase pathway, while citrulline NO synthesis was barely stimulated and immune functions were unaffected. Recent data suggest that citrulline supplementation may be more efficient to increase arginine availability and NO production than arginine supplementation. Our hypothesis is that supplementation with citrulline is more efficient than arginine to increase systemic arginine availability and decrease post-sepsis immunosuppression.",

Alveolar macrophages (AM) are tissue-resident lung cells that play a crucial role in innate immunity.

Although we observed a significant decrease in sepsis associated mortality over the last decade, clinical trial of adjuvant therapies failed to demonstrate an improvement in mortality despite significant effect in animal studies. These discrepancies might be due to the lack of recommendations in pre-clinical sepsis models. To enhance translational value of sepsis models in experimental studies, guidelines have been recently published (1). However, there is no data regarding the effectiveness of such recommendations. The aim of our study is to demonstrate that, when following newly published Minimum Quality Threshold in Pre-Clinical Sepsis Studies, a mouse model of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) can mimic sepsis induced immunosuppression that worsen secondary infections.",

Quantitative pupillometry was performed using the NPi\u00ae-200 pupillometer (Neuroptics\u00ae), which calculates the Neurological Pupil Index (NPI), pupillary contraction, latency, constriction velocity and dilation velocity. The mean value of these variables measured on each eye was calculated. Transcranial Doppler (DWL, Germany) was performed insonating the left middle cerebral artery (LMCA) with a 2 MHz probe. LMCA blood flow velocity (FV) and arterial blood pressure (BP) signals were simultaneously recorded&#894 + Pearson\u00b4s correlation coefficient between BP and FV (Mxa) was calculated using MATLAB (MathWorks, USA). Impaired CAR was defined as Mxa > 0.3.",
