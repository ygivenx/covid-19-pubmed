            "text": "Viral evolutionary rates can vary strongly depending on the method used to estimate them [1, 2]. Among Baltimore groups, the fastest evolving entities are single-stranded (ss) RNA and reverse-transcribing (RT) viruses, with rates ranging between 10\u22122 and 10\u22125 substitutions per site per year (s/s/y). The rates of double-stranded (ds) RNA and ssDNA viruses range between 10\u22123 and 10\u22126 s/s/y, whereas dsDNA viruses evolve more slowly (10\u22123 and 10\u22128 s/s/y) [3, 4]. It is important to note that only few estimates on dsDNA viruses are published. In fact, higher estimates are based on specific genes, as estimated for human papillomavirus 16 (E6 and E7), human adenovirus (hexon), or JC virus (VP1), which are in the order of 10\u22123 s/s/y [4, 5]. Regarding estimates based on dsDNA complete genomes, all of them range between 10\u22125 and 10\u22127 s/s/y [3, 5]. This finding confirms that viruses are fast evolving entities whereas humans have much lower evolutionary rates (10\u22128\u201310\u22129 s/s/y). However, the well-established co-divergence of viral populations with their hosts suggests the possibility of low evolutionary rates in viruses as well. For example, polyomaviruses were historically considered to be examples of human-virus co-divergence, and have been used as markers for human migration patterns, with proposed estimates ranging from 1.41 \u00d7 10\u22127 to 4 \u00d7 10\u22128 s/s/y [6, 7]. Detailed studies are needed to better understand dsDNA virus evolution in vivo, especially in viruses that can be considered as potential pathogens.",

Consequently, viral escape mutants\u2014i.e., viruses that produce mutated peptides that are no longer able to bind to cognate HLA molecules\u2014have been mainly studied for limited model epitopes in in vitro systems and in highly relevant RNA viruses such as HIV, HCV, influenza or dengue (see the following historical references [10, 11]; for a recent review and full bibliography on the subject see [12]).

Here, we initiate a dual approach using the BK virus (BKV) as a model. BKV, which was detected for the first time in 1971, is a 5.1 kb dsDNA virus of the Polyomaviridae family that harbors six genes (Agnogene, VP1 to VP3, large T antigen \u201cLTA\u201d and small t antigen \u201cstA\u201d) [13]. The primary infection occurs essentially in childhood and the virus infects up to 90% of the human population. The virus remains persistent throughout life, primarily in the urinary tract [14]. High-level replication mainly occurs in immunocompromised hosts and, more specifically in those receiving modern immunosuppressive regimens, notably post-kidney transplantation. BKV-associated diseases, especially BKV-associated nephropathy, affect 1\u201310% of transplant recipients [15, 16] and may lead to loss of the allograft and even death [17]. There are no specific prophylactic or curative treatments, and early diagnosis, as well as quick restoration of immunity (through dampening of immunosuppression), remain the most effective strategies to control the disease.",

Here, we present evidence that BKV is under strong purifying selection even in the immunocompromised host. Several specific features of the Polyomaviridae (e.g., limited size of the genome, small number of genes and overlapping transcription units) likely account for this outcome. In addition, the prevalence of purifying selection in essential genes is anticipated in all viruses as there is a requirement to complete the viral cycle, even in immunocompromised hosts. Most mutations in coding regions must be deleterious, and a high substitution rate implies the accumulation of mutations with deleterious effects [18]. This phenomenon is well known in RNA viruses, which have high mutation rates and short replication times. Similar results have been shown comparing mutational fitness effects and evolution in ssRNA and ssDNA viruses [19, 20]. Our study supports the hypothesis, in concordance with other recent findings [21], that the evolutionary rate gap between small dsDNA and RNA viruses might not be as wide as previously thought. A recent study in lentiviruses has revealed that the combined effects of sequence saturation and purifying selection can explain the time-dependent pattern of rate variation. Purifying selection acts on the genetic diversity over long timeframes by removing a large number of transient deleterious mutations that are still present within short timeframes [4].",

A similar phylogenetic classification was observed by analyzing only the VP1 gene (Fig 2B). Incidentally, this finding indicated that the current BKV classification should be revised due to inconsistencies between serotyping and genotyping. Next, to establish the genotype of our samples, one reference strain of each genotype and subtype was used for the phylogenetic analysis (Fig 2C). Most of our samples (80.88%) belonged to genotype I, whereas genotypes IV and II/III were less represented (13.78% and 5.3% respectively). The clustering was patient-dependent but independent of the sample origin (urine or blood) and suggested that some samples likely contained a mixture of genotypes. This mixture might be due to multiple lifelong infections or the replication of viruses from the recipient and/or the donor.",

It is important to note that the sampling window of sequences may affect the estimates of evolutionary rates, because very short timescales can inflate them. A recent study has shown that estimates of evolutionary rates were lower for broader sampling levels and longer timeframes for both, DNA and RNA viruses, suggesting that the time dependence of substitution rates is ubiquitous among all viruses [4]. For example, lentivirus evolutionary rates from serial samples over a few years within a single patient or host are in the order of 10\u22123 s/s/y [30], reflecting those observed in this study in a small dsDNA virus.",

Here, we show that small dsDNA genomes can also evolve as fast as single-stranded ones. Although BKV uses the host DNA polymerase for its replication, the virally-encoded Agnoprotein inhibits dsDNA break repair activity, thereby potentially increasing the error rate during BKV DNA replication [71].

A possible mechanistic explanation for this finding stems from the amply documented interaction of HLA-C with natural killer (NK) and T cells expressing the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR). Notably, the relevance of KIR and HLA-C interactions has been described for viral infections [73, 74], and the involvement of NK cells in the immune response against BKV has also been reported [75, 76], although further investigations should be done to confirm this hypothesis.",

A few studies in HPV-16 or herpes simplex virus have been done to improve vaccine design and drug development, but those studies have only examined a fraction of the proteins and not at whole-genome sequencing data [77\u201379]. This work, to our knowledge, is the first in which predicted epitopes from whole genome sequencing have been studied in an in vivo cohort, in conjunction with cognate HLA alleles, to understand the mechanism involved in immune escape in a DNA virus. Our results of viral escape combined with the high evolutionary rate described herein suggest that a combination of drugs should be used as potential treatment against BKV, as commonly used in highly variable viruses such as HIV and HCV, due to the variable viral populations present in a single patient as observed in our study.",

It further offers a blueprint for similar analyses in other viruses and helps to better rationalize anti-viral therapy and candidate vaccine development. Our results suggest that small dsDNA viruses should be treated as RNA viruses due to their similarities in evolution and immune escape. Thus, a combination of drugs might be necessary for the treatment of BKV, as used for fast evolving RNA viruses. It is important to note that new analytic methods for the study of the evolutionary rates are needed to better understand the effect of time spans and improve the comparison between estimates.",

Samples showing mixtures of genotypes were also excluded since they could interfere with the calculation of the substitution rate. To estimate the intra-patient substitution rate, we used urine samples from twenty-five patients collected at different times (the first positive samples and after 6 months). To calculate substitutions per site per year, we considered all the different genomic positions between two different times that were fixed in the populations. All the substitutions that reverted to the reference base were not included since the possibility of them already being present in the ancestral population at a low frequency could not be ruled out. Thereby only substitutions appearing de novo and exhibiting a high proportion in the population (fixed substitutions, more than 80% of the reads) were included in this approach.

After being tested by RDP, a dataset of 79 BKV sequences was used to estimate the inter-patient evolutionary rate (sequences from 15 patients were potential recombinants). A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was obtained using Phyml [82] with the GTR model with gamma distribution and invariant sites to account for heterogeneity among sites. This model was determined to be the most appropriate for this dataset with jModeltest [83]. TempEst analysis was conducted to detect a correlation between genetic divergence and sampling time, and it assured a temporal signal in our inter-patient dataset (S2 Fig) [84]. We used Bayesian estimates of the evolutionary rate with dated tips as implemented in BEAST [85]. Based on previous results by Firth et al. [5], we considered three molecular clock models (strict, relaxed log-normal uncorrelated, and relaxed exponential uncorrelated) and two demographic models (constant population size and Bayesian skyline). The GTR model with a gamma distribution and invariant sites was used as the nucleotide substitution model in all combinations. Model selection was performed through computation of the marginal likelihood using path sampling and stepping stone sampling analyses [86]. A lognormalPrior with a mean of 1 \u00d7 10\u22126 and a standard deviation of 1.0 was used for the substitution rate. Two independent runs of 30 million steps with 10% burn-in were used to obtain the median and 95% high probability density intervals for the relevant parameters in each model.
