The C-terminal regions, instead, have similar length (281 and 276 amino acids, respectively) and high sequence identity (41%). The multiple sequence alignment of CG3303 and CG2145 with XendoU and human PP11 homologues, shown in Fig. 1b, highlighted that the 1\u2013250 region of XendoU, comprising most of the residues previously reported to be involved in catalytic activity2, was well conserved in both Drosophila isoforms and PP11. Conversely, the 251\u2013292 region is more variable in both length and sequence. This region contains several residues, including N270, H272, G277, T278 and Y280, involved in binding the RNA substrate based on the experimentally determined XendoU structure3. The high sequence variability in this region indicates that the mode of RNA substrate binding is likely to be different between the two Drosophila proteins.",

They appeared as immature animals bearing unexpanded wings, soft cuticle, unretracted ptilinum, dimpled dorsal thorax, and misoriented scutellar bristles. Remarkably, immature-looking flies also showed severe locomotor defects and marked uncoordination. Compared to control flies (Supplementary video 2), pan-neuronal interfered flies were quite unable to walk or stay upright, and usually became stuck in the culture medium immediately after eclosion. Impaired body posture and overall weakness were so severe that standard climbing assay could not be performed. Therefore, locomotor activity of these flies was assessed by evaluating voluntary locomotion on a horizontal surface (Supplementary video 3). As shown in the video, walking assays revealed substantial impairment of motor capacities. Flies were unable to move and promptly restore themselves to an upright position after being knocked down to the bottom of a dish by gentle agitation. The same immature phenotype and locomotor defects were observed in an independent RNAi line, upon exclusion of any off-target effect (Supplementary Fig. 4a,b and Supplementary video 4).",

We used choline acetyltransferase (Cha) promoter-driven GAL4, which is expressed in both central and sensory cholinergic neurons. DendoU downregulation resulted in the same immature phenotypes observed in pan-neuronal knockdown (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Table 2). This result indicates that dendoU-linked immature phenotype can be, at least partially, ascribed to cholinergic DendoU function. DendoU silencing in cholinergic neurons also produces relevant effects on median lifespan, with 75% decrease (31.06 \u00b1 0.37 days for control flies vs 7.57 \u00b1 0.18 days for cha-G4 > dendoURNAi) (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Table 2), and locomotion, with 70% reduction (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Table 2). To verify whether DendoU effect on locomotion is cell-autonomous, functional inactivation of dendoU in motor neurons was performed by the specific D42-GAL4 driver. Climbing assays showed 25% decrease of performance index (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Table 2), indicating the involvement of DendoU in motor neuron activity.

Remarkably, some of the phenotypes determined by dendoU pan-neuronal silencing, i.e., pupal lethality, strongly reduced fly lifespan, juvenile phenotypes and severely impaired locomotion, overlap with those caused by dTDP-43 deregulation17. TDP-43 is an evolutionary conserved RNA/DNA binding protein, considered to be a neuronal activity-responsive factor and neurodegeneration hallmark2122. As shown in different model systems, TDP-43 cellular levels must be exquisitely regulated since even subtle alterations result in neurotoxicity2324. We demonstrate, through two independent RNAi lines, that dendoU knockdown causes an about 35% decrease of dTDP-43 protein, indicating that one relevant function of DendoU in Drosophila nervous system is to contribute to the control of dTDP-43 levels. These data suggest that DendoU-linked phenotypes are at least in part mediated by dTDP-43 loss-of-function. The involvement of other genes is expected in light of the more severe phenotype observed in dendoURNAi flies compared to dTDP-43RNAi. Moreover, since dTDP-43 mRNA is not a direct DendoU substrate, dTDP-43 regulation must be mediated by still unknown DendoU targets. Ongoing transcriptomics analysis aims at identifying DendoU target genes responsible for the regulation of i) dTDP-43 dependent circuit; ii) other molecular pathways underlying the observed dramatic phenotypes.",

For the walking assay, we examined the behaviour of freely walking upright adult flies on a flat horizontal surface. Newly eclosed female and males were transferred in batches of 15 to fresh vials and aged for 3\u20134 days. The flies were transferred, without anaesthesia, to the centre of 200 mm Petri dish to allow for video recordings using a Nikon D5000 mounted on a WILD M3B (Wild Heerbrugg) stereomicroscope. For the climbing assay we used an apparatus consisting of two empty polystyrene vials vertically joined by tape facing each other. For the lower vial, a vertical distance of 8 cm above the bottom surface was measured and marked by drawing a circle around the entire circumference of the vial. For the climbing assay, a group of 10 male flies were transferred into the lower vial and allowed to acclimatize to the new setting for 1 minute. The climbing assay involved gently tapping the flies down to the bottom of the vial and measuring the number of flies per group that can climb above the 8 cm mark by 15 seconds after the tap, recorded as the percentage success rate. Nine trials were performed for each group and n \u2265 100 flies were assayed for each genotype. Experiments were performed during daylight to minimize potential effects of circadian oscillation. All average data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM and compared with 2-tailed unpaired t-tests. Statistical tests were performed using Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.). For survival assay, homozygous virgins bearing GAL4 were crossed to homozygous UAS-dendoURNAi transgene and control Ore-R males. The progeny from these crosses were maintained on standard cornmeal-sucrose-yeast-agar diet at 29 \u00b0C. Every 2\u20133 days, flies were passed into new vials and dead flies were counted. The survival rate was calculated by the percentage of total flies surviving. Survival curves were analysed by the log-rank method using GraphPad Prism (n \u2265 500 flies for all genotypes except for D42-G4 > dendoURNAi (n \u2265 200)).",

These regions comprise a highly conserved segment (EndoU-like, white boxes) and a variable segment (striped boxes). The N-terminal regions of CG2145 and CG3303 comprise additional segments not present in XendoU. The N-terminal region of CG2145 is significantly longer and comprises a signal peptide (black box), a long disordered and proline-rich region (gray box), and a short glycine-rich segment (light gray box). The N-terminal region of CG3303 comprises a disordered segment (dotted box) and a predicted trans-membrane region (horizontally-striped box). (b) Multiple sequence alignment of CG3303 and CG2145 products with human PP11 and X. laevis XendoU. Residues that are not visible in the experimental XendoU structure are lower-case. Identical residues at the same alignment position have a black background. Positions where all residues are identical are indicated by black triangles. XendoU_SS: secondary structure elements detected in the 3D XendoU structure; \u03b1-helices and \u03b2-strands are indicated with \u03b1 and \u03b2 and a number indicating their progression along the amino acid sequence. XendoU_FR: XendoU residues (i) with a key functional role, i.e., those reported to diminish (d) or abolish (C) catalysis if mutated; affect RNA binding (R); in contact with the phosphate molecule in XendoU 3D structure (P); and (ii) shown to interact with XendoU key-residues in the 3D structure (O). XendoU_%: conservation of XendoU residues in a multiple sequence alignment comprising over 700 family members (see Supplementary Table 1); numbers 0, 1, 2, \u2026, 8, 9 indicate conservation in the ranges: <10%, 10\u201319%, 20\u201329%, \u2026, 80\u201389%, 90\u201399%, respectively; catalytic residues, which are 100% conserved in the extended multiple sequence alignment, are indicated by\u2217.",
