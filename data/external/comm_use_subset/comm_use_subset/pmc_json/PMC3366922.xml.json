Most RT-PCR protocols rely on two DNA polymerase (Pol) enzymes; a retroviral reverse transcriptase (RT) to copy RNA into cDNA and a thermostable DNA Pol to amplify the target sequence. We describe a unique single-enzyme alternative to the traditional format based on the innate reverse transcriptase activity of the thermostable 3173 Pol, which was recently isolated from a viral metagenomic library [1], [2]. We believe this is the first report of a reagent enzyme produced from a viral metagenomic library, the first viral Pol shown to be fully thermostable in vitro and the first single-enzyme RT-PCR protocol with high sensitivity and specificity comparable to two-enzyme systems.",

These deficiencies are associated with cloning errors, amplification bias, poor concordance between and within testing labs, and target dependent variation in amplification efficiency [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. The two-enzyme systems require an initial low temperature reverse transcription step that reduces specificity, increases reaction time, and impairs synthesis through complex secondary structures. The limited shelf stability in solution of retroviral RTs has precluded development of complete RT-PCR enzyme premixes popular for standard PCR. Alternative chemistries based on an improved RT-PCR enzyme are a means of addressing these shortcomings.",

All of these fall into one of two groups of high molecular identity and biochemical similarity; bacterial Pol I-type enzymes and archaeal Pol II-type enzymes [20]. Remarkably, no truly thermostable viral replicase-type Pol has ever been described. The pool of useful RTs consists mainly of retroviral Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (MMLV) RT and its derivatives and Avian Myeloblastosis Virus (AMV) RT. Substantial effort has been devoted to engineering MMLV RT. Truncating the MMLV RT protein to eliminate RNase H activity [21] fortuitously increased thermostability [22]. However, none of the engineered retroviral RTs are thermostable enough for PCR. The alternative bacterial and archaeal Pols also do not fulfill the goal of a facile single-enzyme RT-PCR reagent. Thermus thermophilus (Tth) Pol I was originally induced to reverse transcribe by inclusion of manganese ions in the reaction buffer [23]. However, Tth Pol in the presence of manganese is highly inaccurate and much less sensitive than the two-enzyme systems and therefore not widely used. Notably absent is a thermostable RT suitable for single enzyme RT-PCR that matches or exceeds the performance of two-enzyme systems with regard to fidelity, sensitivity, specificity and low bias.",

These enzymes possess many important and highly useful biochemical characteristics. Bacteriophage T5, T7 and phi29 DNA polymerases are highly processive enzymes [25], [26], [27] and the latter two are less prone to slippage [28]. T4 bacteriophage DNA polymerase is extremely accurate [29]. While all of these properties make viral Pols very useful as molecular biology reagents, none is suitable for thermocycling based amplification due to limited thermostability. The need for new Pols that combine the practical advantages of viral enzymes with improved thermostability has motivated the metagenomic screens of viral sequences from thermal springs described in this report.",

Except where noted, the 3173 Pol reaction buffer used throughout was 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.8 at 25\u00b0C, 10 mM (NH4)2SO4, 10 mM KCl, 2 mM MgSO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 200 \u00b5M of each dNTP (N = A,C,G,T). Construction, sequencing and BLASTx analysis of viral metagenomic libraries have been described [2]. Clones identified by BLASTx analysis as encoding likely pol genes were functionally screened to detect expression of thermostable Pol activity. For these screens, viral proteins were constitutively expressed in the original clones by growth to saturation in 2 ml Luria Broth. Cells were pelleted at 2,800 rcf and suspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5,1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% (v/v) glycerol. Cells were lysed by sonication and host proteins were denatured by incubation at 70\u00b0C for 10 minutes. Soluble proteins were collected from the supernatant after centrifugation at 11,000 rcf for 10 minutes and assayed for DNA Pol activity based on their ability to extend a 5\u2032 fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide primer. The labeled assay primer was annealed at room temperature to the assay template and incubated for 10 minutes at 70\u00b0C with 5 \u00b5l of each clarified lysate. Primer extension was detected using an ABI 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in GeneScan mode. For preparative expression, the coding sequence of 3173 Pol was inserted into pET28 and used to transform BL21(DE3) cells according to the manufacturer (EMD Bioscience, San Diego, CA). Pol proteins were expressed, extracted and heat-treated as described for the functional screen and purified using heparin-agarose and Q-sepharose chromatography.",

Excess activated calf thymus DNA was added simultaneously with nucleotides to capture the Pol in non-detected extension products after enzyme dissociation from the primer/template. Primer extension has traditionally been detected by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Capillary electrophoresis of fluorescently tagged primer extension products allows quantitative determination of processivity by direct measurement of the number of nucleotides incorporated and the amount of each extension product based on electrophoretic mobility and peak integration. Reactions where the observed lengths of extension no longer increased with time were chosen for analysis. This approach showed a mean processivity of 47 nucleotides for 3173 Pol. The same analysis indicated processivity of 9 and 37 nucleotides for Taq and Bacillus stearothermophilus (Bst) Pol I enzymes, respectively. The 3173 enzyme has a half-life at 94\u00b0C of about eleven minutes. In contrast Taq Pol measured under the same conditions lost 45% activity over the two hour assay. The thermal profile of 3173 Pol (Figure 2) shows peak activity at 77\u00b0C, with approximately half maximal activity at 55\u00b0C.",

We used two assays (Figure 3) to compare the RT activities of the wild-type and exonuclease deficient 3173 Pols to those of AMV and MMLV RTs at 37\u00b0C or 65\u00b0C on an oligo dT primed poly A substrate. The AMV and MMLV had higher RT activity at 37\u00b0C while the 3173 Pol RT was much more active at 65\u00b0C using the fluorogenic incorporation assay (Figure 3A). The Taq polymerase and no enzyme controls had no detectable RT activity at either temperature. Extension products from a 5\u2032-fluorophore-labeled dT20 primer were resolved by denaturing polyacrylamide gel to further demonstrate RT activity and to assess the relative lengths of the extension products of the 3173 Pol and MMLV RT (Figure 3B). Both RTs were able to efficiently extend the primer when polyA RNA template was provided. The length distribution of the 3173 Pol cDNAs was visibly shorter than that produced by the MMLV RT, although a subset of the 3173 extension products appeared to be so large that they barely entered the gel. Incubation of the DNA primer:RNA template complex with the Taq Pol negative control resulted in a structure-dependent 5\u2032-3\u2032 exonuclease cleavage product that migrated at the dye front [39]. As an additional test to compare the RT activity of the 3173 Pol to that of MMLV-RT on a complex RNA substrate, a primer specific to bases 714 to 690 of the negative sense RNA MS2 genome [40] was 5\u2032-fluorophore-labeled. The labeled cDNA primer was extended using extracted MS2 RNA as a template (Figure 3C). The 3173 Pol and MMLV RT were both able to extend the primer to produce faint, nearly full-length products although the 3173 Pol product was detectably longer than that of MMLV RT. The 3173 Pol also synthesized a larger amount of several shorter length extension products from 175 to 300 bases in length. The MMLV RT formed a visible template-independent product in the absence of added RNA template that was not resolved by the gel, while the 3173 Pol did not.",

The RNA targets were MS2 bacteriophage and a human mRNA. The 3173 Pol readily synthesized 77 bp MS2 [40] (Lanes A1\u20137) and 144 bp beta-actin cDNAs (Lane B2, 3, 5, 6, 7) but generally failed to synthesize cDNA targets longer than \u223c400 bp (Panel C). Of the two longer target sequences tested, only the 821 bp beta-actin sequence (Lane C3) was reverse transcribed by the 3173 Pol and this synthesis appeared less efficient than that of MMLV RT. Interestingly, both enzymes appeared to reverse transcribe with primers that would not be expected to prime near the target. (A1, A11, B14) and even in the absence of primers (Lane A7, B17, C17). In the case of 3173 Pol, it is likely that both cDNA synthesis and amplification occur during the PCR step so the presence or absence of primers during cDNA synthesis may be inconsequential.

Cultured influenza A Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) RNA was extracted from cell medium and amplified by 40 cycles of one-step RT-PCR (Figure 8B). The results with influenza A were similar to those seen for the MS2 target. All four reagents appeared to have similar limits of detection for the influenza A RNA extract and amplified the intended 60 bp target from the second lowest dilution of RNA. The PyroScript RT-PCR reaction was largely free of extraneous bands. In contrast, the Transcriptor and the Superscript-based mixes produced spurious bands, primarily of a size greater than the expected amplicon size. The Transcriptor kit also produced false products in the negative control reaction. Again the slopes of plots of qPCR cycle threshold versus fold dilution show that all four reagent mixes amplified the MS2 target with similar efficiency. In contrast with MS2, both the qScript and the PyroScript reagent were found to amplify influenza A several cycles later than the SuperScript and Transcriptor master mixes did.",

For example, secondary activities, including RNase H and terminal transferase, are associated with strand switching [4], [6] and insertion errors [42]. Replication of native retroviral genomes depends on specific sequences within the terminal repeats [43], which may be related to a significant bias seen with certain combinations of primer sequences and reverse transcriptases [44] used in vitro. In particular, the two 3\u2032-terminal nucleotides of the primers can account for a 35,000-fold range in the frequency of misincorporation, a measured Km variation of 100-fold and Vmax range of several-fold when used with MMLV or AMV RTs [5]. These preferences are possible causes of amplification errors, amplification bias [8], poor concordance between tests [9], [45] and sequences that are completely refractory to reverse transcription [44], [45].",

Although the thermostability of 3173 Pol is significantly lower than Taq and most other commonly used thermostable Pols, it is clearly adequate for PCR since product continues to accumulate up to forty cycles (Figures 6 and 7). The combination of thermostability and reverse transcriptase activity in one enzyme has practical implications. Because the two enzyme RT systems contain a thermolabile protein component, the use of hot start technologies to improve specificity of reverse transcription is not practical.

Affinity for template influences the sensitivity and specificity of amplification, but has not been widely described for other Pols. This affinity can have an important impact on certain applications. For example, Bst Pol has a higher template affinity for DNA than Taq Pol, allowing use of lower template concentrations when DNA sequencing [53]. Also important is affinity for nucleotides. The nucleotide dissociation constants for Pol I enzymes from T. thermophilus and three thermostable Bacillus species were reportedly between 115 and 85 \u00b5M [54]. Processivity is probably related to affinity for template. The phi29 Pol has a processivity value of greater than 70,000 nt [27]. The processivity of 3173 (47 nt) is comparatively modest but still higher than either Bst or Taq Pols (37 and 9 nt, respectively). While processivity measurements are highly dependent on reaction conditions, the measured result for Taq is comparable with previously published values [50].",

Published methods of fidelity measurement use DNA templates [35]. Using a variant of these methods, the wild-type 3173 Pol had a fidelity of 6.7\u00d7104 similar to our measurements for the most accurate PCR enzymes, Pfu and Phusion Pols (5.8\u00d7104 and 7.5\u00d7104 respectively) when assayed in parallel. An exonuclease deficient mutant of 3173 Pol had a PCR fidelity of 0.9\u00d7104, similar to the value measured for Taq Pol (1.4\u00d7104) and slightly below the reported range of 2.5 to 5.0\u00d7104 for Taq Pol [32], [35]. Published in vitro fidelity measurements for MMLV RT are especially difficult to compare since the assay conditions and temperatures are quite different; however, the reported fidelity for MMLV RT is between 1.7 and 3.0\u00d7104\n[55]. Measurement of the fidelity of 3173 Pol on RNA templates will require extensive studies beyond the scope of this report. If the fidelity on RNA is similar to the fidelity on DNA, 3173 Pol could prove especially valuable as an RNA sequencing enzyme for transcriptomics research. Thus, the determination of 3173 Pol fidelity is the basis of ongoing study.",

            "text": "The PyroScript mix was comparable in sensitivity to three leading commercial two-step RT-PCR kits when used to detect either MS2 phage or influenza A RNA. Background amplification in the absence of target, especially after 40 cycles of PCR, is problematic in clinical diagnostic tests where RNA target copies may approach single molecule levels. This problem is exacerbated in two-enzyme, one-step RT-PCR since the retroviral RTs are not thermostable and background reduction during reverse transcription using hot start methods for these RTs are not possible. We found that both the MS2 and the influenza one-step RT-PCR amplification reactions exhibited some propensity for non-specific product formation. However, all of the one-step kits produced background at similar or higher levels. Furthermore, these background products were often generated in earlier cycles than the 3173 enzyme false products. The yield of end product formed by the Transcriptor and by the Superscript reagents appeared greater than those of the Quanta and the PyroScript mixes (Figure 5), likely due to higher recommended amounts of primers used by these reactions (500 nM vs. 200 nM). However, the higher concentration of primers probably resulted in increased background observed with the Transcriptor and SuperScript reagents. With additional effort, reaction parameters for any of the enzymes could undoubtedly be optimized for specificity or for yield. This higher yield of end product does not appear to affect qPCR results.",

            "text": "While the PyroScript enzyme mix shows utility for a range of detection applications, we noted some limitations. The use of 3173 Pol for amplification of targets greater than about 350 nt is not reproducible although both the 3173 wild-type and exo- mutants generate PCR products from DNA targets up to 5 kb and higher (data not shown). This is consistent with the shorter length of cDNA products that we observed in the labeled primer extension experiments (Figure 3B). Figure 3C indicates a small amount of full-length, 714 nt cDNA product, although the bulk of product is less than 300 nt. Each of these shorter products terminates within a region of secondary structure of the MS2 RNA associated with RNase sensitivity [56] so these apparent size limits may reflect labile sites in target RNA and may have to do with RNA stability at the high extension temperatures used with 3173 Pol (72\u00b0C) than with inherent properties of the enzyme. Most detection modes amplify much shorter targets, but preparative RT-PCR with 3173 Pol will likely be affected by this observed limitation. In contrast to the two-enzyme mixes, use of 3173 Pol in RT-PCR was significantly more reliable when the primers were designed to anneal at the higher (72\u00b0C) annealing/extension temperature of the two step PCR protocol. Throughout the RT-qPCR studies, we used dye binding as the detection mode. An alternative detection chemistry uses hydrolysis probes commonly known as TaqMan\u00ae probes (Life Technologies) [57]. This chemistry was not tested since the 3173 Pol lacks the 5\u2032-3\u2032 exonuclease activity required to cleave a TaqMan probe. Finally, while the 3173 Pol reliably detected high abundance transcripts, as shown in Figure 6, it was noticeably less consistent with less abundant targets. The reason for this inconsistency is not fully understood and is under investigation. One explanation may be that the enzyme is sensitive to high abundances of non-target sequences, typical in total RNA extracts. This effect has been seen to a lesser extent with MMLV RT-based RT-PCR [10] and with optimization may be ameliorated. Such abundant non-target RNA is generally absent in viral RNA preparations and the 3173 Pol has proven especially useful for detection and quantification of RNA viruses. For detection of RNA viruses the PyroScript mix appears to be competitive with two enzymes systems that use a retroviral RT and a thermostable Taq Pol. Since RNA viruses including influenza, HIV, Dengue, West Nile and SARS coronavirus represent a substantial portion of emerging pathogens worldwide, an improved means of detecting and quantifying these viruses could have an important impact on global health care.",
