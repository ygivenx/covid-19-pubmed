Scavenger receptors bind and internalize exogenous and endogenous damage-associated molecules such as microbial lipopolysaccharide and lipoteichoic acid, anionic phospholipids, beta amyloid peptide, modified low density lipoprotein (LDL), and advanced glycation end products [12]. In the atherosclerotic lesion where reactive oxygen species (ROS) and macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) are abundant, macrophages are stimulated to upregulate scavenger receptors and take up modified LDL [13,14]. Clearance of lipids through scavenger receptors is protective in early atherosclerotic lesions, but prolonged exposure to lipids causes cell death, leading to plaque instability and thrombus formation.",

CWE was not toxic to cells for 24 and 48 h, but the maximum concentration assayed here (400 \u03bcg/ml) caused a 10% decrease in cell viability at the end of 72 h culture period (Figure 2A). Then, we measured whether CWE affects gene expression of the scavenger receptors, type 1 macrophage scavenger receptor (SRA) and CD36, and the macrophage-specific integrin, CD11b using real-time PCR. These differentiation markers are upregulated in response to PMA [16-18]. CWE treatment reduced the expression levels of CD11b and CD36 in a concentration-dependent manner (Figures 2B,C).

The expression of SRA and CD36 can be differentially controlled. Peroxisome-proliferator-activated \u03b3, a transcription factor that is involved in lipid metabolism and monocyte differentiation, influences the expression of CD36, but not of SRA [29]. The different response of SRA and CD36 genes to CWE treatment indicate that CWE may separately affect PMA-activated signaling pathways that express these genes. It should be noted here that inhibition of acetyl LDL uptake in THP-1 cells by CWE was more marked than that of SRA and CD36 expression. A similar effect was observed in peritoneal macrophages of which scavenger receptors had already occupied before CWE treatment.

PMA treatment causes cell cycle arrest in THP-1 cells through the upregulation of p21, a negative regulator of cyclin dependent kinases [32]; the increased expression of p21 is due to the generation of ROS and PKC-mediated ERK1/2 activation. ROS inhibitors are reported to inhibit the level of SRA gene expression and acetyl LDL uptake in PMA-stimulated THP-1 cells [17]. This may explain why some antioxidants reduce atherosclerosis [33]. Cinnamon has antioxidant hydrophilic polyphenols such as catechin, epicatechin, and tannins [6,34]. Our previous study showed that the high molecular fraction of CWE (over 10 kDa) occupied most of its phenolics and was responsible for its inhibitory effect on LPS-induced ERK1/2 and other inflammatory signaling molecules [1]. The same components in CWE may exert a similar effect on PMA-mediated ERK1/2 activity. However, the inhibition of SRA and other surface molecules by CWE cannot be fully accounted for by its effect on ERK1/2 because effective inhibitory concentration ranges are different. Presumably, lower concentrations of CWE have more of unidentified stimulatory ingredients that affect the pathways linking ERK1/2 to SRA synthesis.",
