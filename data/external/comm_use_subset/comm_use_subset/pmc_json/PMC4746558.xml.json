Pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) are an important clinical outcome in CF, as they are associated with a faster rate of decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and with an increased morbidity and mortality in patients with CF. Almost 25% of patients fail to recover to baseline FEV1 after a PEx.1, 2 The reasons why these patients fail to recover previous FEV1 after an appropriate treatment are not fully understood even though some risk factors have been identified (pancreatic insufficiency, low body mass index (BMI), chronic infection with CF pathogens, greater drop in FEV1 from baseline at treatment initiation).3 Viruses are frequent triggers of PEx, and rhinoviruses are the most frequent viral agents found in patients with CF.4 An impaired innate host defense may cause an increased susceptibility to viral respiratory infection in patients with CF, and some severe viral infections might be responsible for the exaggerated pulmonary inflammatory response.5, 6\n",

These infections seem to play a significant role in pulmonary morbidity and inflammation in patients with CF. Indeed, patients presenting with concomitant bacterial and viral infections show a greater rate of both hospitalization and antibiotic prescription.7 Unfortunately, the consequences of viral respiratory infections on the evolution of CF lung disease are hard to study on a large scale, because, in order to evaluate such an issue, a close longitudinal follow\u2010up with repeated viral swab assessment is needed. We could therefore speculate that the impact of respiratory viruses is probably underestimated in patients with CF.",

The study EudraCT (2008\u201000451\u201030) has been approved by our local ethic committee (ref 2008.07.06bis). All children and both parents signed the consent form. Patients were longitudinally assessed three times in the CF university center: at baseline (Visit 1, V1), at the diagnosis of PEx (Visit 2, V2), and after PEx treatment (Visit 3, V3). V3 was scheduled between 2 and 6 weeks after the beginning of PEx treatment, because it has been shown that antibiotic response to exacerbation as assessed by PFT is essentially complete 2 weeks after treatment initiation.9 Clinicians working in CF university centers managed PEx, according to the guidelines.",
