Among other functions, G6PD is involved in the regeneration of reduced glutathione (GSH) from its oxidized form (GSSG), a reaction catalysed by glutathione reductase [1]. GSH is a major endogenous antioxidant that protects cells against oxidative damage in several ways. Therefore, G6PD-deficient activity, and consequently lower GSH levels, theoretically, renders cells susceptible to oxidative stress.",

More than 300 G6PD variants have been identified and are responsible for different levels of the enzyme activity. The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies these variants into five classes, according to the level of residual enzyme activity and the associated clinical manifestations [2]. Although in most cases G6PD deficiency causes no symptoms, it may lead to diseases such as neonatal jaundice (hyperbilirubinemia) and acute or chronic haemolysis [3] as red blood cells (RBC) are susceptible to oxidative stress and consequently destruction [4]. Frequency and severity of haemolysis vary depending on the G6PD variant and exposure to various oxidative agents [2, 3, 5\u20137]. Such agents include oxidative drugs, chemicals, foods (fava beans), and even some vitamins (e.g., vitamin K). Moreover, infection is thought to be another common cause of haemolytic anaemia in G6PD-deficient individuals [8, 9]. Redox imbalance has been suggested to contribute to viral replication and virulence [10\u201312], and haemolytic episodes have been reported after various viral and bacterial infections in G6PD-deficient individuals.",

Although G6PD deficiency is well studied in RBC, there is a paucity of information about the activity of G6PD in other cells such as white blood cells and myocytes. Prevalence of diseases and associated complications such as neonatal jaundice, diabetic ketoacidosis, acute renal failure, cataract, and cancer have been claimed to be increased among G6PD-deficient individuals, suggesting that G6PD deficiency may be a risk factor for a wide range of pathological conditions.",

Since the musculature is heavily utilized during exercise and the generation of reactive oxygen species can over exceed the theoretically reduced antioxidant capacity of the G6PD-deficient individual, exercise could have harmful effects on various health aspects in these individuals. Furthermore, since RBC are extremely active during intense exercise [14], G6PD-deficient RBC might not be able to withstand the exercise-induced oxidative stress, and acute haemolytic anaemia could develop. On the other hand, it is well known that exercise confers multiple protective effects on the human body. Thus, advising G6PD-deficient individuals to refrain from participating in exercise without substantial evidence of the harmful effects of exercise to them does not seem prudent. The purpose of this review was to examine whether exercise has any positive or negative effects on individuals with G6PD deficiency. We believe that the topic is very interesting since it relates with the most common enzymopathy and could generate interest for more research that could potentially lead to exercise guidelines being formulated for these individuals.",

Regarding G6PD-deficient individuals, there is some concern about the possibility of negative effects of intense exercise on health due to their increased susceptibility to oxidative stress; however, research on this topic is scarce and does not support that concern. Nikolaidis and colleagues [18] examined oxidative stress after exercise until exhaustion in G6PD-deficient individuals. Nine G6PD-deficient males and nine controls matched for age and maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) participated in two exhaustive treadmill exercise protocols of different duration. The first trial lasted for about 12 min where VO2max was determined, and the second trial lasted for about 50 min (45 min at 70-75% VO2max and then at 90% till exhaustion) with a 7-day washout period between the two trials. GSH, GSSG, haematocrit (Hct), and haemoglobin (Hb) were significantly lower in the G6PD-deficient group than the control group at the baseline. After the two exercise protocols, Hct and Hb levels did not change, GSH decreased, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), protein carbonyls (PC), catalase, and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) increased in both groups. GSSG increased and the GSH/GSSG ratio decreased after the long-duration trial in both groups. The results of this study showed that exercise until exhaustion did not lead to higher oxidative stress and increased haemoglobin oxidation in G6PD-deficient males in comparison to their normal counterparts, despite the lower baseline GSH levels in G6PD-deficient males.",

Nine G6PD-deficient males and nine control males matched for age and maximal isometric torque performed an isokinetic eccentric contraction session of the knee extensors of both legs. GSH and GSSG were lower in the G6PD-deficient group compared to the control group at the baseline. Immediately and till 5 days after exercise, changes in indices of muscle function, redox status, and haemolysis in the G6PD-deficient group were similar to those in the control group. GSH and GSSG were always lower in the G6PD-deficient group. These results suggest that high-intensity muscle-damaging exercise may not cause different fluctuation pattern on muscle function, blood redox status, and haemolysis in G6PD-deficient males in comparison to their normal counterparts. Finally, an experimental study reported that 30 min of moderate intensity (70-75% of VO2max) did not perturbate redox status indices (TBARS, GSH, and GSSG) in a G6PD male individual [22]. However, it has to be mentioned that this individual was well-trained since his VO2max was more than 57 ml/kg/min.",

Furthermore, even though earlier case studies indicated an increased probability for increased haemolysis, more recent experimental studies do not support such findings. Even though it seems that there is less chance for haemolysis with intense exercise, it is unknown whether the assumed compromised ability of the immune system of the exercising G6PD-deficient individual will lead to increased predisposition for upper respiratory tract infection under stressful conditions. Also, it has to be mentioned here that there is a complete lack of studies that have examined the exercise training effects on redox and health status in general on G6PD-deficient individuals.",

Moreover, vitamin E may protect the membranes of RBC from oxidation and consequent haemolysis.

To the best of our knowledge, no study has looked into the effects of supplementation on health aspects in G6PD-deficient individuals after exercise. One study by Tsakiris and colleagues [32] investigated the effect of exercise training and alpha-tocopherol supplementation on G6PD activity in erythrocytes of non-G6PD-deficient individuals. Ten basketball players participated in a game (forced training) before and 30 days after alpha-tocopherol supplementation, with blood samples obtained before and immediately after each game. Alpha-tocopherol supplementation resulted in increased pre- and postgame total antioxidant status (TAS). Postgame G6PD activity was also increased after alpha-tocopherol supplementation compared to postgame G6PD activity at the baseline. These results indicate that alpha-tocopherol supplementation could potentially lead to increased antioxidant capacity in G6PD-deficient individuals after a period of strenuous training. Further research is needed to assess whether supplementation with antioxidants or cysteine donors would increase GSH levels and therefore help cells counterbalance exercise-induced oxidative stress, an effect that could benefit G6PD-deficient individuals that participate in exercise.",

This conclusion stems from results from full-scale controlled research trials that employed the most rigorous and demanding types of exercise, using a large number of parameters that showed no harmful effects after several modes and intensities of exercise on G6PD-deficient individuals. This is of great importance if someone takes into account that exercise has pleiotropic positive effects on health, and G6PD deficiency is the most common enzymopathy. Excluding individuals with this enzymopathy from participating in exercise a priori or based on some case studies does not seem a prudent thing to do. There are some reports of clinical signs of haemolysis, muscle degeneration, myalgia, and myoglobinuria after heavy exercise in G6PD-deficient individuals that come from case studies, and they should be viewed with caution when interpreting them. Deficient G6PD activity in skeletal muscles and other tissues than RBC observed in some individuals may play a role in this phenomenon. Therefore, future studies should examine the responses to exercise of individuals with different levels of G6PD activity in various tissues. Finally, since GSH levels are lower in G6PD deficiency, it would be interesting to examine the effects of antioxidant or cysteine donor supplements on redox status after acute exercise or chronic training in these individuals.",
