At the present time capillaroscopy is recommended as mandatory exam to investigate RP for the diagnosis of early SSc [16, 18, 19].

Adding the radiologic aspects there is a range of differential diagnoses as atypical pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and interstitial pneumoniae [1]. In the presented current case, initially pneumonia was diagnosed. Then, according to the clinical and radiographic aspects she was diagnosed with organizing pneumonia (OP). However, the result of the histopathological examination showed, posteriorly, the AFOP standard. The diagnosis of AFOP is essentially histological. In the series studied by Beasley et al., cases of patients who had only transbronchial biopsy were excluded from the study [1] since, due to the localized nature of the injury, this kind of biopsy may fail on histologic diagnosis [1, 2]. Acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia (AFOP) diagnosis should only be made on large biopsy specimen when it is quite certain that there are not otherwise diagnostic features of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), eosinophilic pneumonia (EP) or OP, histological patterns that make differential diagnosis with AFOP [2]. No hyaline membranes were seen as in DAD, and despite the presence of eosinophils in some specimens, they were never predominant as in EP [22]. Although fibrin deposits have been described in both the DAD and OP patterns, they do not comprise a major component of the process [1].",
