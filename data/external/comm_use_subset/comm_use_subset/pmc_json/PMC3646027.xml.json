            "text": "Neuroinflammatory changes develop with age and are a feature of most neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). Epidemiological studies indicate that long-term non-steroidal anti-inflammatory treatment reduces the risk of developing AD [1] suggesting that inflammatory processes may contribute to very early changes in the pathogenesis of the disease. The inflammatory changes in the central nervous system (CNS) in normal ageing and AD are characterised by microglial activation with resultant changes in microglial phagocytic activity and neurotoxic consequences [2]\u2013[4]; the evidence indicates that some of these CNS changes have systemic parallels. The number of blood-derived monocytes is increased in AD patients [5], and it has been reported that circulating monocytes express specific cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) that are altered with age, and in patients with AD and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) [6], [7]. Interestingly, circulating monocytes readily infiltrate the brain in murine models of AD [8], [9] and evidence indicates that blood-borne monocytes can act as amyloid phagocytes and may be involved in amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) clearance [10]. These findings, alongside others which show that monocytes, in addition to in vitro differentiated macrophages, express several AD-related genes [11], suggest that circulating monocytes may be a valuable model system in assessing the role of microglial cells in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative conditions.",

            "text": "Human monocytes express an array of CAMs and receptors that are crucial for cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, transmigration and innate immune responses. Of these, CD11b is a receptor for intercellular adhesion and is a phenotypic monocytic cell marker, the expression of which increases with age, indicating a more activated phenotype [6]. Monocytes/macrophages also express a diverse array of toll-like receptors (TLRs), a family of signalling pattern recognition receptors that mediate innate immunity by recognising conserved motifs of microbial origin known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and endogenous damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that are released by injured tissue [12]. Human blood monocytes express TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6, TLR8, and TLR9 mRNA, with TLR2 and TLR4 being the most highly expressed [13]. TLRs continue to emerge as key players in CNS diseases and much data link TLRs with AD pathology, with polymorphism in the tlr2 and tlr4 gene linked with the disease [14]. The classical monocyte marker, CD14, a glycosylphosphatidyl inositol (GPI)-anchored myeloid glycoprotein, acts as a co-receptor for TLRs and is responsible for the uptake of Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) via macropinocytosis [15]. Indeed, TLR4 acts as the primary signalling receptor for LPS [16], with TLR2 further required for LPS-induced TLR4 signalling [17].",

The advantage of adopting such an approach is threefold. First, it allows quantification of true age-related changes in the strength or weakness of memory relative to an estimate of lifetime cognitive capacity. Second, it allows one to dissociate domain-specific changes in memory function. Third, it allows classification of individuals as high or low memory performers based on standardised measures of memory relative to IQ that can be utilised, not only in research, but also in a clinical setting. The purpose of the study was to compare the expression of receptors (CD11b, TLR2 and TLR4) on circulating monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and the response of these cells to LPS in samples prepared from the LP cohort and a cohort which we classified as IQ memory-consistent (high-performing, HP) individuals. We show that MDMs isolated from the LP group display enhanced expression of CD11b, TLR2 and TLR4, compared to the HP group. We further show that treatment of MDMs with LPS promoted pro-inflammatory cytokine production in HP and LP groups, but that the effect was exacerbated in MDMs prepared from the LP group.",

The concentration of LPS used is in line with those used in various inflammatory paradigms in human monocytes and macrophages [23]\u2013[25]. The concentration of RNA was determined using a UV/Vis spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter Inc., Ireland). cDNA synthesis was performed on 1 \u00b5g RNA using a High Capacity cDNA RT Kit (Applied Biosystems, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Equal amounts of cDNA were used for RT-PCR amplification. Real-time PCR primers were delivered as \u201cTaqman\u00ae Gene Expression Assays\u201d containing forward and reverse primers, and a FAM-labeled MGB Taqman probe for each gene (Applied Biosystems, USA). Primers used were as follows: CD11b, TLR2 and TLR4 (Taqman\u00ae Gene Expression Assay no. Hs00355885_m1, Hs00610101_m1 and Hs00152937_m1, respectively). A 1 in 4 dilution of cDNA was prepared and real-time PCR performed using an Applied Biosystems 7300 Real-time PCR System. cDNA was mixed with qPCR\u2122 Mastermix Plus (Applied Biosystems, USA) and the respective gene assay in a 25 \u00b5l volume (10 \u00b5l of diluted cDNA, 12.5 \u00b5l Taqman\u00ae Universal PCR Mastermix, 1.25 \u00b5l target primer and 1.25 \u00b5l GAPDH). Human GAPDH was used as an endogenous control and expression was conducted using a gene expression assay containing forward and reverse primers and a VIC-labeled MGB Taqman probe (#4326317E; Applied Biosystems, USA). Samples were run in duplicate and 40 cycles were run as follows: 10 min at 95\u00b0C and for each cycle, 15 s at 95\u00b0C and 1 min at 60\u00b0C. Gene expression was calculated relative to the endogenous control and analysis was performed using the 2\u2212\u0394\u0394CT method. In all experiments no change in relative GAPDH mRNA expression between treatment groups was observed.",

            "text": "Since neurological symptoms are often exacerbated by infection [26], we initially assessed plasma levels of the inflammatory reactant CRP in plasma from HP and LP groups. No significant difference in plasma CRP concentration was found between groups (Figure 1A). PBMCs predominantly constitute lymphocytes and monocytes, with lower numbers of natural killer (NK) and dendritic cells. CD11b is an adhesion molecule primarily expressed on the surface of monocytes, but also on activated lymphocytes and a subset of NK cells, where it mediates leukocyte adhesion and migration to orchestrate an inflammatory response [27]. Indeed, CD11b expression is upregulated by many inflammatory mediators including cytokines [28]. CD11b expression was unchanged on PBMCs isolated from the HP and LP groups (Figure 1B, C, P\n = 0.45) and no difference in MDM CD14 mRNA was observed between groups (Figure 1D) suggesting that differentiation of monocytes to macrophages was similar in LP and HP individuals. However, the percentage of CD11b+ cells in the MDM preparation was significantly greater in the LP group, compared with the HP group (Figure 1E, F, P\n<0.05) and the CD11b staining intensity was also higher on MDMs from the LP group, compared with the HP group (Figure 1G, P\n<0.05). Although CD11b mRNA was also enhanced in MDMs from the LP, compared with the HP, group the difference did not reach statistical significance (Figure 1H, P\n = 0.19). Since macrophages and other cells of the innate immune system recognise distinct microbial products via TLRs, we next assessed the expression of TLR2 and TLR4 since they are specifically implicated in inflammatory changes associated with neurodegeneration [14], [29]. TLR2 expression on CD11b+ cells was similar on PBMCs isolated from the HP and LP groups (Figure 1I, J) but expression in MDMs from the LP group was higher than the HP group, although it did not reach statistical significance (Figure 1K, L, P\n = 0.056); MFI values for the HP and LP groups were 88.1 and 77.2 respectively. TLR2 mRNA was significantly greater in MDMs prepared from the LP group compared with the HP group (P<0.05; Figure 1M). TLR4 expression on CD11b+ cells was similar on PBMCs isolated from the HP and LP groups (Figure 1N, O) but expression on MDMs from the LP group was significantly greater than from the HP group (P<0.05; Figure 1P, Q); MFI values for the HP and LP groups were 37.1 and 28.3 respectively. TLR4 mRNA was significantly greater in MDMs prepared from the LP group compared with the HP group (P<0.05; Figure 1R). Overall, this indicates that differentiated MDMs, but not freshly prepared PBMCs, isolated from the LP cohort display elevated expression of CD11b and TLR2/4.",

Production of the cytokines TNF\u03b1, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-12p70 was similar in unstimulated MDMs from HP and LP groups (Figure 2). However, LPS significantly increased cytokine production in MDMs from both groups, and importantly the production of TNF\u03b1 (Figure 2A), IL-6 (Figure 2B), IL-10 (Figure 2C) and IL-12p70 (Figure 2D) was exacerbated in MDMs prepared from the LP group, compared with the HP group (P<0.05).

Indeed, elderly individuals display reduced B cell production [30] and T cell memory [31], ensuring greater susceptibility than young individuals to bacterial and viral infection. Much data also indicate that ageing affects cells of the innate immune system, particularly associated with alterations in neutrophil [32] and monocyte/macrophage phagocytic capacity [33], and ability to produce cytokines and chemokines [33]. Overall, cumulative data indicates that defective innate immunity is associated with advancing age. Intermediate stages between normal ageing and dementia are recognised by several classification systems; the best recognised are the several clinical subtypes of MCI, a preclinical stage of AD [34]. The lack of diagnostic tools which enable early detection of conditions like MCI and/or AD is a major stumbling block for treatment of disease and a method of detecting early changes in cognitive function relative to previous levels would be a significant advance. Structural changes which are indicative of conversion from normal ageing to MCI and AD have been identified using image analysis [35]. In addition, a number of peripheral blood-based biomarkers have been suggested, however the most compelling data have been obtained from analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in which the ratio of A\u03b2/phosphorylated tau combined with total tau levels yielded a positive predictive value in terms of conversion from MCI to AD [36].",

Monocytes and macrophages not only share the same origin with microglia in the brain, but also have the same antigens, functions, and regulatory mechanisms [37]. Much research has focused on characterising the neurodegenerative role of microglial cells which accumulate at senile plaques in AD [9], secreting proteolytic enzymes that degrade A\u03b2 [38] and expressing receptors that promote the phagocytosis of A\u03b2 [39]. Monocytes and macrophages are professional phagocytic cells and central players in orchestrating the innate immune response. Monocytes/macrophages have pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic properties, with the proclivity to produce inflammatory molecules such as TNF\u03b1 and inducible nitric oxide synthase [37]. Blood-borne monocytes are highly mobile and rapidly recruit to inflamed CNS tissue during bacterial infection [40], autoimmune disorders [41] and neurodegenerative disease [8]. Indeed, circulating monocytes can infiltrate the CNS parenchyma and differentiate into microglia [42], where they are important for clearing amyloid and limiting its deposition in murine models of AD [43]. Furthermore, macrophages display an activated phenotype in neurodegenerative disease, typified by increased expression of cell surface markers such as CD11b [44], CNS infiltration [45] and enhanced production of inflammatory cytokines [46].",

MDMs are a type I or classically activated (M1) macrophage that display a pro-inflammatory phenotype [47]. MDMs are considered a peripheral counterpart of microglia, as they share the same progenitor and antigen markers, and they have similar biological behaviours that mirror microglial function in the brain [48], [49]. Previous evidence has shown that they produce inflammatory cytokines in response to LPS treatment [50] and that they express TLR4 [51], which is confirmed here. Interestingly monocytes from older, compared with younger, individuals have higher intracellular levels of TNF both at baseline and following LPS stimulation [6], while pro-inflammatory cytokine [52] and chemokine [53], [54] levels are elevated in peripheral blood monocytes isolated from the elderly after LPS stimulation. In addition, PBMCs from AD patients have been reported to produce enhanced levels of IL-6 following LPS stimulation compared with controls [55]. These findings suggest that monocyte function is dysregulated both with age and in AD, but the present study significantly extends these observations to show that similar changes can be picked up in MDMs prepared from a group of otherwise healthy adults whose memory performance is discrepant with their estimated IQ.",

Indeed, CD11b expression is increased in monocytes from aged individuals [6] and on microglial cells in aged animals [3]. Furthermore the number of CD11b+ activated microglia is increased in mouse models of AD [56] and MS [57]. The present data indicate that CD11b expression was enhanced in MDMs, but not PBMCs, from the LP cohort, indicating that these cells displayed an enhanced activated phenotype. This cell type-specific effect indicates that altering the phenotype of human monocytes in vitro may provide a mechanism which identifies alterations of myeloid cell function in cohorts with the most subtle cognitive changes. It is of interest to note that modifications of macrophage phenotype have been suggested in conditions where clear pathology is identified, i.e. in chronic inflammatory conditions [58], autoimmune disorders [59] and AD [60].",

In the present study we focused on examining expression of TLR2 and TLR4 since much evidence indicates the role of these receptors in neurodegenerative conditions. Monocytes derived from elderly individuals display defective TLR signalling, particularly TLR1/2, with further decreases in relative TLR1 and TLR4 expression determined on peripheral blood monocytes from older subjects [6], [61]. TLR2/4\u2212/\u2212 mice are protected from cognitive impairment following A\u03b2 immunisation [29] with polymorphism in the tlr2 and tlr4 gene linked with AD [14]. Knockout studies suggest differential effects of TLRs on AD progression; deletion of CD14, a co-receptor for TLR2/4, reduces plaque burden in a murine AD model [62], but deletion of MyD88 enhances memory deficits [63]. Importantly, evidence indicates that A\u03b2 binds microglial TLR2 and 4 [64] suggesting that TLRs function as members of the A\u03b2 receptor complex. Our findings indicate that the expression of TLR2 and TLR4 is increased in MDMs from the LP group, compared with the HP group. Since increased TLR expression does not occur on monocytes in healthy elderly individuals [6], while increased expression of TLR2 and TLR4 has been reported in PBMCs from patients with late-onset AD [65], the data may suggest a role for increased TLR expression in progression from the mildest manifestation of episodic memory loss to more profound cognitive decline.",

Consistent with the increased expression of TLR4, stimulation with LPS promoted enhanced cytokine production in MDMs from this LP group, compared with the HP IQ memory-consistent group. It is important to note that bacterial and(or) viral infections are associated with reduced cognitive performance [26], but no differences in plasma concentrations of CRP were identified between the cohorts in this study. These peripheral cell changes, which are indicative of inflammation, may provide a biological substrate indicative of the earliest discernible changes in episodic memory decline which may be a precursor to more profound changes that are associated with the development of neurodegenerative disease.",
