Their primary functions are to permit nutrient absorption and to balance electrolytes and water levels.

The lumen of the intestine is in constant contact with the \u201cever-present\u201d microbiota and their various pro-inflammatory associated products (e.g., LPS). Surprisingly, this microbial load does not elicit constant inflammation in the intestine under physiological conditions. Several mechanisms have been reported to participate in the tolerance of the commensal flora. Evidence suggests that IECs generate an innate immune response in the gut that is specifically and uniquely tailored with a perfect responsive balance to flare up and control pathogens in the lumen of the gut without causing excessive local inflammation (1, 2).",

            "text": "Interferons (IFNs) are a class of cytokines that are often produced and secreted upon infection, in particular by viruses. IFNs bind to the infected and uninfected bystander cells to induce JAK/STAT-dependent signaling cascades that lead to the production of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). ISGs alert cells against the presence of pathogens conferring them an antiviral state. There are three classes of IFNs: type I, II, and III. While type II IFNs are mostly specific to immune cells, type I and III IFNs are expressed by both immune cells and epithelium cells making them very relevant for viral infection of epithelium surfaces. Type I IFNs are composed of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b5, IFN-\u03ba, and IFN-\u03c9 in humans. All type I IFNs bind to the interferon alpha receptor (IFNAR) complex, which is composed of a heterodimer of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 (2\u20134). There are four subtypes of type III IFNs: IFN-\u03bb1\u20133 (also called IL28a, IL28b, IL29) (5, 6) and IFN-\u03bb4 (7). Type III IFNs bind to a heterodimeric receptor complex composed of the interferon-lambda receptor (IFNLR1) and the interleukin-10 receptor beta (6, 8, 9). Type I and III IFNs, as well as IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, are expressed by most cells. By contrast, the type III IFN-specific receptor IFNLR1 is expressed mainly on epithelial cells (i.e., respiratory tract, intestinal tract, and hepatocytes) (9\u201312). The functions of type I (\u03b2) and III (\u03bb1\u20133) IFNs has been intensely studied in murine systems (13). However, to date, there are only few reports describing how and whether these two IFNs act differently in human organs.",

            "text": "The current view is that both type I and III IFNs are redundant by inducing very similar signaling pathways that lead to the expression of a comparable set of ISGs (14). This model is supported by work in the lower respiratory tract during influenza A virus (IAV) infection where multiple lines of evidence suggest that both type I and III IFNs participate in the protection against IAV (12, 15\u201318). On the contrary, studies focusing on the mouse gastrointestinal tract have shown an age-restricted dependence on IFNs. Neonatal mice have epithelium cells that respond to both type I and III IFNs (19), but adult mice are insensitive to type I IFNs. In adult animals, type III IFN controls local viral infection of the epithelial layer, while type I IFN controls systemic viral spread (20\u201323). Similarly, human hepatocytes become refractive to type I IFN treatment but never lose their ability to respond to type III IFNs (24). These examples of differential regulation of type I and type III IFNs signaling and the epithelium specificity of type III IFN-mediated immunity strongly suggest major functional and regulatory differences between the IFNs at mucosal surfaces.",

Using genetic ablation of either type I or type III IFN receptors, we show that either IFN can independently restrict virus infection in human IECs.

            "text": "The roles of type I and III IFNs at mucosal surfaces and in epithelial cells have been extensively studied in mice (12, 15, 16, 25, 26). Whether and how these two IFN types have antiviral activity in human epithelial cells remains much less characterized, particularly in human intestinal epithelial cells (hIECs). To investigate the functions of both IFN types in the context of primary untransformed human cells, we used human colon and intestinal mini-gut organoids. This ex vivo human model for the gut fully reproduces the structural architecture of the human intestinal tract and contains all major intestinal cell lineages (27, 28). Mini-gut organoids were formed by isolating intestinal crypts containing stem cells from human gut (colon or small intestine) resections from multiple donors. Single crypts were grown in Matrigel and 24 h post-isolation, opened crypts started to re-seal with the evident formation of a lumen within these organoids at 3\u20135 days of culture. At 7\u201310 days, the organoids were significantly increased in size (Figure 1A). After differentiation, human colon organoids displayed the typical organization with a clear and developed lumen, localization of E-cadherin at the basolateral side of the cells, tight junctions located at the apical side, as well as presence of mucin-secreting goblet cells (Mucin-2) and enteroendocrine cells (Syn) (Figure 1B). To address whether type I and/or type III IFNs protect the human gut against viral infection we used mammalian reovirus (MRV). MRV is a well-known virus model that induces immune response in infected cells and is sensitive to type I and III IFNs (29). In the following, we use the terms type I and type III IFNs to describe IFN \u03b21 and IFN \u03bb1\u20133, respectively. Colon organoids were infected with MRV with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5, harvested 16 h post-infection (hpi), and viral replication was assessed by immunostaining of the reovirus non-structural protein \u03bcNS and by quantification of viral replication using quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR. As shown in Figure 1C, MRV efficiently infects human mini-gut organoids as evidenced by the presence of MRV-infected cells (Figure 1C, left panels) and potently replicates over the course of infection (Figure 1C, right panel). Of note, MRV infection severely disrupted the structural integrity of the human mini-gut organoids (Figure 1C, also confirmed later in Figure 3B), which were mostly fragmented pieces of cellular monolayers, compared to the intact structures observed in mock-infected organoids. To characterize the innate immune response generated by organoids, we monitored the upregulation of both type I (IFN-\u03b2) and III (IFN-\u03bb2\u20133) IFNs and of two representative ISGs (Viperin and IFIT1) over the course of MRV infection. We found that viral infection of organoids induces the transcriptional upregulation of type III IFN and to a lesser extent type I IFN (Figure 2A). This was congruent with the detection of only type III IFN in the supernatant of infected organoids (Figure 2B). Additionally, viral infection of organoids was associated with the upregulation of ISGs. The transcriptional upregulation of two representative ISGs (Viperin and IFIT1) over the course of MRV infection is shown in Figure 2C.",

Organoids were harvested 16 hpi for analysis of viral infection/replication by immunostaining and immunoblotting against the reovirus non-structural protein \u03bcNS as well as by quantification of viral replication using qRT-PCR. Compared to mock-treated cells, pre-treatment of colon organoids with either IFN significantly reduced both the number of MRV-infected cells (Figures 3B,C, immunostaining and quantification) and the viral antigen levels within these organoids (Figure 3D). Complementarily, viral replication was severely impaired when organoids were treated with either IFNs as assayed by qRT-PCR (Figure 3E). To ensure that these findings were neither donor nor colon specific, colon organoids from different donors (colon D2\u2013D3) and organoids derived from ileum or jejunum were similarly pre-treated with type I or III IFNs and infected with MRV. Reduced viral infection characterized by the lower expression levels of the MRV \u03bcNS protein and the decreased MRV replication was observed in colon organoids generated from different donors (Figure S1A in Supplementary Material) and in ileum (Figure S1B in Supplementary Material) and jejunum (Figure S1C in Supplementary Material) derived organoids. Similar results were found using vesicular stomatis virus (VSV), an unrelated model virus whose replication is also sensitive to both type I and III IFNs (29, 30). Pre-treatment of human organoids with either IFNs resulted in a significant inhibition of VSV replication as measured by the significant decrease of bioluminescence when using VSV-expressing luciferase (VSV-luc) as a reporter of viral replication (Figure S2 in Supplementary Material). All together, these results demonstrate the antiviral protective role of both type I and III IFNs in colon, ileum, and jejunum derived hIECs.",

Viral infection of T84 cells induces the upregulation of type I and type III IFNs (Figure 4A). Similar to human mini-gut organoids (Figure 2), viral infection induces a higher transcriptional upregulation of type III IFNs compared to type I IFN (Figure 4A; Figure S3A in Supplementary Material). To address whether both IFNs were made at the protein level and secreted by infected T84 cells, we measure the amount of both IFNs in the supernatant of infected T84 cells using ELISA. As observed for viral infection of mini-gut organoids (Figure 2B), only type III IFN was found in the supernatant (Figure 4B). However, type I IFN can be detected in the supernatant if added exogenously to inhibit viral infection (data not shown).",

Conversely, disruption of IFNLR1\u2212/\u2212 specifically abolished the protective effect of type III IFN, but not of type I IFN. Similar results were obtained with several KO clones (Figure S4C in Supplementary Material).

Several MAPKs have also been reported to be activated (34) and contribute to ISG upregulation in type I or III IFN-stimulated cells (35, 36), but the role of the MAPK pathways in the antiviral functions of type III IFN remains unclear. We found that both type I or III IFN treatment induced the phosphorylation of STAT1, STAT2, and STAT3 with similar kinetics in T84 cells (data not shown). Type I or III IFN treatment did not induce STAT5A, STAT5B, or STAT6 phosphorylation (data not shown). We next addressed whether type I and III IFNs activate the MAPKs. We found that both IFNs induce the phosphorylation of the MAPKs, p38, ERK, and JNK to the same extent and with similar kinetics (Figure S5A in Supplementary Material). To determine the role of the STAT and MAPK pathways in the antiviral activity of IFNs, we used specific pharmacological inhibitors in combination with IFN treatment. The specificity of these inhibitors and their toxicity were tested in T84 cells by Western blot analysis (Figure S6 in Supplementary Material) and cell viability assay (Figure S5B in Supplementary Material). Inhibiting the JAK/STAT pathway with a pan-JAK inhibitor almost fully blocked phosphorylation of STAT1 (Figure S6 in Supplementary Material) and strongly impaired the antiviral activity of either type I or III IFNs on both VSV and MRV (Figure 7A). Interestingly, inhibition of the MAPKs with specific inhibitors, had no effect on the phosphorylation kinetics of STAT1 (Figure S6 in Supplementary Material) but strongly affected the antiviral protection conferred by type III IFN only (Figure 7A). This specific inhibition is seen across a range of concentrations (Figure 7B). Of note, a partial inhibition of the antiviral activity of type I IFN was observed at high concentration of JNK inhibitor (Figure 7B) but at this concentration cell viability was severely affected (Figure S5B in Supplementary Material). This type III IFN restricted dependence on MAPKs was independent of IFN concentration (Figure S5C in Supplementary Material), validating that the non-dependence of type I IFN for MAPKs was not the result of differences in the IFN concentration used to stimulate the cells. Altogether, these results demonstrate the fundamental role of STAT-dependent signaling in conferring both type I and type III IFNs antiviral activity, and in addition demonstrate a unique role for MAPKs toward inducing the antiviral state induced by type III IFN but not type I IFN.",

This suggests that dependency on MAPKs might be cell type specific. To ensure that the antiviral activity of type III IFN in primary non-transformed hIECs depends on MAPKs, we used our mini-gut organoid culture system. Colon organoids were treated with pharmacological inhibitors of the JAK/STAT or MAPKs signaling pathways. Following pre-treatment with type I or type III IFNs, organoids were infected with VSV. Eight hpi, organoids were harvested and the impact of the pharmacological inhibitors on the antiviral activities of both IFNs was measured. As expected, inhibition of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway fully restores VSV infection to a level similar to infected organoids in the absence of IFNs (Figure 8). This confirms that the JAK/STAT signaling pathways is key for both type I and type III IFN activity in primary hIECs. Interestingly and similar to T84 cells, inhibition of either p38 or JNK MAPKs partially impairs only the antiviral activity of type III IFNs in human mini-gut organoids (Figure 8). No significant effect of MAPK inhibition on type I IFN-mediated antiviral activity was observed. The effect of inhibiting ERK-dependent signaling on the antiviral activity of both IFNs was not determined (n.d.) since treatment of mini-gut organoids with ERK inhibitor induced disruption and death of the organoid culture (Figure 8 and data not shown). Altogether, these results confirm that MAPK signaling pathways participate in the establishment of the antiviral state mediated by type III IFN in primary non-transformed hIECs.",

In this work, by exploiting human mini-gut organoids, we performed a functional characterization of both type I and III IFNs in a human primary intestinal cell context. We found that, upon viral infection, human IECs strongly upregulate both type I and III IFNs at the transcriptional level. Although only type III IFN was found to be secreted by IECs, we demonstrated that either type I or III IFNs induce the production of ISGs and that this production is associated with the establishment of an antiviral state that efficiently protects IECs from viral infection. Importantly, we revealed that type III IFN-mediated signaling allows for efficient protection against viral infection while limiting ISG production. We propose that this represents a mechanism to limit inflammation in the gut while remaining responsive to pathogens. Additionally, genetic ablation of IFN signaling using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated KO of IFN receptors further demonstrated that type I and III IFNs independently mediate an antiviral activity. Comparative analyses revealed that both IFNs induce the same set of ISGs and that both antiviral states depend on the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Importantly, we discovered that the type III IFN-mediated, but not the type I IFN-mediated antiviral activity depends on MAPK signaling pathways. This work establishes that both type I and III IFNs provide potent antiviral protection in the human gut, and identifies, for the first time, fundamental differences in the mechanism by which these two IFN types establish the antiviral state in primary hIECs.",

Similar observations have been made in lung epithelium, where both type I and type III IFNs participate in the protection against IAV (12, 15\u201318). Our functional characterizations performed in both mini-gut organoids and colon carcinoma-derived cell lines revealed that although these cells transcriptionally upregulate both type I and III IFNs, they secrete very little to no type I IFN. A favored type III IFN response over type I IFN has been observed in other epithelial cells stimulated with various viruses and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (16, 30). It was shown that although both IFNs can protect airway epithelial cells against viral infection, type III IFNs were preferentially made in response to influenza infection (15). Similarly, it was shown that upon stimulation of IECs with the double strand RNA structural analog poly-inosinic:cytidylic acid (poly I:C), only type III IFN was secreted by the cells although both type I and III IFNs were upregulated at the transcriptional level (42). Additionally, it has been reported that human hepatocytes can become refractive to type I IFN, while maintaining their responsiveness to type III IFN (24). Consequently, favoring type III IFN signaling appears to be a common strategy developed at epithelial surfaces (airway, hepatocytes, intestinal tract) to mount an antiviral response.",

On the contrary, the antiviral activity generated following activation of peroxisomal-associated MAVS was insensitive to brefeldin A (29).

This lower induction of ISGs is not cell type specific as recent publications addressing the role of these IFNs in hepatocytes also reported that type III IFN induces less ISGs compared to type I IFN (43\u201345). However, in these studies, the antiviral potency of both IFNs was not addressed side-by-side. As such, type III IFN could be considered a milder IFN favored at epithelial surfaces (at least intestinal epithelium) due to its ability to confer an antiviral state without inducing excessive amounts of ISGs, which might result in the induction of local pro-inflammatory signals. The molecular mechanisms by which type III IFN signaling modulates ISG expression remain unknown. Desensitization is a possible mechanism through which IFN signaling is reduced following stimulation. Different negative regulators of IFN signaling might be used to regulate or turn off ISG expression. Signal transduction strongly depends on the amount of receptor and the affinity of the ligand for its receptor. It is known that type I IFN (IFN\u03b2) has a very strong affinity for its receptor. Differences in the affinity of type I and III IFNs for their respective receptor or differences in the amount of type I and III IFN receptors at the surface of hIECs might be partially responsible for the observed differences in the magnitude of ISG expression.",

            "text": "Functional characterization of type III IFN and comparison to type I IFN suggests that both cytokines are functionally redundant by inducing the same set of ISGs (8, 35, 46). However, the restriction of type III IFN receptor to epithelium cells suggests that type III IFN might have unique functions or provide specific advantages at epithelial surfaces. Several studies have tried to characterize functional differences both in human (hepatocytes) (43, 44) and in murine model systems (lung and intestinal tract) (16, 19, 20, 26). To date, the main difference between both IFNs has been explained by the spatial restriction of type III IFN receptor at epithelial surfaces. In this work, we demonstrate that type III IFN induces less ISGs compared to type I IFN. Most importantly, we unravel, for the first time, fundamental differences in the mechanisms by which both IFN mount the antiviral state in hIECs. We demonstrate that the antiviral activity of type III IFN partially depends on MAPKs, which is not the case for type I IFN. Interestingly, inhibition of MAPKs did not influence the expression of both IFIT1 and Viperin ISGs (data not shown). As such, it remains an important task for future work to dissect how signaling downstream of MAPKs participates in the antiviral activity of type III IFN only. As both IFNs have been reported to activate MAPKs (34\u201336), it will be interesting to address whether the dependency of type III IFN for MAPKs is epithelium cell specific or intestinal epithelium cell specific.",

It was proposed that, during rotavirus infection, IFNs are produced by immune cells and not by epithelial cells (42). Indeed, during rotavirus infection of hIECs, multiple strategies are developed by the virus to inhibit innate immune response particularly the inhibition of both type I and III IFNs production (47). Additionally, blocking IFN signaling in hIECs does not lead to an increased rotavirus replication (42). Our data clearly show, for the first time, that when primary hIECs are infected with viruses that do not block IFN synthesis, hIECs produce and secrete at least type III IFN (maybe some type I IFN but under the detection limit of our ELISA assay) in order to protect themselves. Complementarily, KO of IFNLR renders hIECs more susceptible to viral infection (Figure 6).",

            "text": "Considering our results that only type III IFN is secreted by hIECs, it is tempting to propose that IECs have evolved to favor type III IFN over type I IFN, as it allows for similar protection against pathogens while limiting production of ISGs. From the perspective of an epithelium, which is always exposed to the extracellular environment and commensal challenges, this might represent a \u201csmart strategy\u201d to regulate the immune response in order to achieve the balance between responsiveness to pathogens versus tolerance of commensals. Restricting signaling to type III IFNs allows for response compartmentalization because type III IFN signaling is limited mostly to epithelial cells (11, 12, 35), thereby limiting systematic inflammation. From our findings in epithelium cells of the gastrointestinal tract, we can speculate that the first response to pathogen threats will be generated by hIECs. This response will be characterized by type III IFN-mediated signaling, therefore limiting ISGs and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. This first wave response of type III IFN produced by IECs, alone might be enough to clear enteric virus infection (22, 48). A second wave response might be generated through recruitment of immune cells at the site of epithelium infection, which in turn will produce various cytokines including type I IFN. This IFN will then mediate a strong induction of ISGs and pro-inflammatory signals to powerfully combat pathogen at the infected mucosa and also will provide systemic protection. This uniquely tailored response would be fundamental for the maintenance of human gut homeostasis.",

Reovirus MRV strains Type 3 clone 9 derived from stocks originally obtained from Bernard N. Fields were grown and purified by standard protocols (49). VSV-luc was a kind gift from Sean Whelan (Harvard Medical School) and was produced as described in Ref. (50). An MOI of 1 was used to infect T84 cells and organoids. Titers were determined as described in Ref. (51). For T84 cell MRV infections, MRV were purified on CsCl-gradient and stocks were titred by fluorescence foci forming assay (express in FFU) in T84 cells. Titers were calculated by determining the 50% tissue culture infective dose and expressed in FFU/mL. T84 cells were infected as described in Ref. (49). The MOI was determined as the ratio of infected cells (determined by fluorescence foci forming assay)/total number of cells. An MOI of 1 was used in T84 based experiments resulting in about 50\u201360% of infected as determined by fluorescence assay. For mini-gut organoids MRV infection, Organoids were removed from Matrigel by adding cold-PBS for 5 min, liquefied Matrigel and organoids were separated by centrifugation (400 g 5 min), the total number of cells per organoid samples was measured using an haematocytometer. Organoids were resuspended in culture medium containing or not MRV. When using an MOI of 1 (as determined in T84 cells) to infect mini-gut organoids, very few infected cells were detected per organoid. This discrepancy between T84 and organoid infectivity might be due to the 3-dimensional nature of the organoids and to residual Matrigel that might absorb and neutralize MRV. As such MRV stocks were titred directly in organoids by serial dilution infection and subsequent immunostaining. The MOI was calculated by the ratio of the number of infected/total number of cells/organoid. An MOI of 0.5 was used to infect organoids.",
