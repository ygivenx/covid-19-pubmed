            "text": "Avian coronaviruses (AvCoVs) pose a major threat to poultry health, production, and welfare worldwide. AvCoVs are highly infectious, remain endemic in poultry populations, and, due to their high mutation rate, frequently produce new antigenic variants (1, 2). The best-known AvCoV is infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), causing mainly respiratory disease in chickens. In addition, IBV-like viruses have been detected in other domestic poultry, including turkey and quail (3\u20135). In guinea fowl, coronaviruses were identified for the first time in 2011 as the causative agent for fulminating enteritis (6). Full-genome sequencing revealed that guinea fowl coronavirus GfCoV/FR/2011 is closely associated with turkey coronavirus (TCoV) (7), with both causing gastrointestinal tract infections in their respective hosts (6, 8). Clinical signs related to GfCoV infection in guinea fowl include prostration, ruffled feathers, and decreased water and feed consumption, and GfCoV infection has resulted in a daily death rate of up to 20% in several farms in France (6). Upon necropsy of affected animals, whitish and enlarged pancreases were consistently reported. Histopathological analyses revealed pancreatic necrosis and lesions of various intensities in the intestinal epithelium, with the most severe lesions found in the duodenum of affected animals (6).",

The spike protein is the main determinant for tropism (9), and the N-terminal part of the S1 of IBV has been shown to contain the receptor-binding domain (RBD) (10). Studies using recombinant IBV S1 and/or RBD proteins have demonstrated that the viral tropism is reflected by tissue binding of such proteins (11). Mutations in the spike proteins of IBV might result in either decreased (10) or increased (12) avidity for its receptor present on epithelial cells of the chicken trachea. In contrast to IBV, GfCoV and TCoV target the epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract (4, 6), and recombinant protein binding of their S1 proteins reflects this viral tropism, with predominant staining of epithelial cells of the small intestine (4). Glycan array analysis identified elongated biantennary N-acetyllactosamine (di-LacNAc) molecules on N-glycans as the host receptor for enteric AvCoVs, which are abundantly expressed on intestinal tissues (4).",

Glycan and tissue binding analyses of GfCoV/2011 and GfCoV/2014 recombinant spike S1 proteins revealed that while both proteins had the same specificities, GfCoV/2014 S1 had a much higher affinity toward glycan receptors and tissues of the lower gastrointestinal tract, in agreement with the observed replication of the virus in these tissues from field cases.

To this end, both S1 proteins were applied to a novel glycan array containing N-glycan structures with their linear counterparts, either with terminal galactose or two differently linked sialic acid moieties (F. Broszeit and R. P. de Vries, submitted for publication). Schematic representations of each of the glycans are given in Fig. 4A. The data revealed that both GfCoV S1 proteins bind to longer biantennary LacNAc structures (Fig. 4B, structures 3 and 4), including the diLacNAc structure used in the ELISA (Fig. 3). Furthermore, both GfCoV S1 proteins bound to longer linear LacNAc repeats (Fig. 4B, structure 1), which were not included in the previous array (4). Finally, both GfCoV S1 proteins bound longer linear and biantennary LacNAc repeats with terminal alpha-2,6 sialic acid (Fig. 4B, structures 9 to 12) but not those capped with alpha-2,3-linked sialic acids (Fig. 4B, structures 5 to 8). Erythrina crista-galli lectin (ECA), Sambucus nigra lectin (SNA), and Maackia Amurensis lectin I (MAL1) were used as controls. We observed, as expected, specific binding to galactose and alpha-2,6-linked and alpha-2,3-linked sialic acid terminal glycans, respectively (Fig. 4C). In conclusion, both GfCoV S1 proteins show specificity for the same glycans, ending with either galactose or alpha-2,6-linked sialic acids on the glycan array. However, the relative fluorescence observed for GfCoV/2014 S1 was consistently higher than that for GfCoV/2011 S1, which is suggestive of differences in their affinities for glycan receptors, as observed for diLacNAcs in the data shown in Fig. 3.",

This prompted us to analyze avidity and specificity of GfCoV S1 proteins to glycan receptors in the guinea fowl gastrointestinal tissues. We therefore pretreated tissue slides with Arthrobacter ureafaciens neuraminidase (AUNA) and/or galactosidase to cleave off terminal sialic acids and/or galactose residues from host glycans, respectively. Treatment of the tissues with AUNA had only a minor effect on the binding of both GfCoV S1 proteins, with a slight decrease in binding intensity to the duodenum for GfCoV/2014 S1 (Fig. 6A, second column; Table 2). SNA lectin binding was completely abolished after pretreatment with AUNA, confirming that the treatment did effectively cleave off all sialic acids from the host glycans (Table 2).",

High mutation rates for avian coronaviruses are not uncommon (based on full-genome sequences, around 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22123 substitution/site/year [16, 17]). When the S1 sequences of GfCoV/2011 and GfCoV/2014-S1 are compared, the calculated mutation rate was 5 \u00d7 10\u22122 substitutions/site/year with a ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS) of 0.45. Similar mutation rates of the spike have been reported for IBV (18) and are believed to be driven by selective pressure after vaccination (19, 20). However, no vaccine is available against GfCoV or against the closely related turkey coronavirus, TCoV. Another driver for genetic diversity is the population size (21); however, this is unlikely to explain the observed high mutation rate of GfCoV since flocks are considerably smaller than chicken flocks. It might well be that circulating antibodies against field strains of GfCoV are the main drivers of the observed sequence diversity. Unfortunately, retrospective studies to further elucidate the contribution of virus evolution, the circulation of other virus populations in the last years, or the introduction of novel strains via, for example, trade of birds between farms are impossible due to the lack of archived material.",
