It enables researchers to perform comprehensive spatio-temporal simulations incorporating epidemiological data and models for disease transmission and control in order to create complex scenario analyses. Epigrass is designed towards facilitating the construction and simulation of large scale metapopulational models. Each component population of such a metapopulational model is assumed to be connected through a contact network which determines migration flows between populations. This connectivity model can be easily adapted to represent any type of adjacency structure.",

This goal led to the inclusion of a collection of built-in epidemic models which can be readily used for the intra-node dynamics (SIR model family). Epigrass users are not limited to basing their simulations on the built-in models. User-defined models can be developed in just a few lines of Python code. All simulations in Epigrass are done in discrete-time. However, custom models may implement finer dynamics within each time step, by implementing ODE models at the nodes, for instance.",

The model presented here, took 2.6 seconds for a 100 days run, on a 2.1 GHz cpu. A somewhat larger model with 343 sites and 8735 edges took 28 seconds for a 100 days simulation. Very large networks may be limited by the ammount of RAM available. The authors are working on adapting Epigrass to distribute processing among multiple cpus(in SMP systems), or multiple computers in a cluster system. The memory demands can also be addressed by keeping the simulation objects on an object-oriented database during the simulation. Steps in this direction are also being taken by the development team.",

For example: The spread speed of the epidemic, measured as the time taken to infect 50% of the cities, was found to be influenced by the centrality and degree of the entry node (figures 9 and 10). The dispersion tree corresponding to the epidemic, is greatly influenced by the degree of the point of entry of the disease in the network. Figure 8 shows the tree for the dispersion from the city of Salvador.",

Many infectious diseases can only be maintained in a endemic state in cities with population size above a threshold, or under appropriate environmental conditions(climate, availability of a reservoir, vectors, etc). The variables and the magnitudes associated with endemicity threshold depends on the natural history of the disease [18]. Theses magnitudes may vary from place to place as it depends on the contact structure of the individuals. Predicting which cities are sources for the endemicity and understanding the path of recurrent traveling waves may help us to design optimal surveillance and control strategies.",
