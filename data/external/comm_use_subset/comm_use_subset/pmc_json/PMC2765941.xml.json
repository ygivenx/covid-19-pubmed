Moreover, both the globalization and the environmental impact involving climatic repercussions have accelerated these changes. Throughout the history of mankind, great pandemics have been documented; suffice to remember those caused by the Black Death, small pox, cholera and influenza. The latter, described as early as the Hippocratic times, caused three large pandemics during the 20th century: the one in 1918-19, known as the \"Spanish flu\", the one in 1958-59, and finally the one in 1968 [1,2].",

The date of onset and the main symptoms as well as the sample date, besides the above mentioned time, place and individual data were obtained.
