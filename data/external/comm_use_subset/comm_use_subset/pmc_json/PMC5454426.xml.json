It is characterized by vomiting and lethal, watery diarrhea, and is becoming a global problem [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. PED was first reported in feeder pigs and fattening swine in the United Kingdom in 1971 [8]. Since then, the disease has emerged in many pig-producing countries in Europe and Asia, resulting in tremendous economic losses to the pig industry. PEDV mainly infects the villous epithelial cells of the small intestine, which are rich in proteases, and causes atrophy of the villi, resulting in dehydration and diarrhea. Currently, although PEDV can be propagated in Vero cells treated with trypsin, which mediates the activation of virions for membrane fusion by cleaving the spike (S) glycoprotein [9,10], propagation of PEDV in vitro in a more productive manner remains a continued challenge. Sometimes, PEDV that has been isolated from clinical samples gradually loses its infectivity during further passages in cell cultures [1]. Therefore, the development of novel strategies to control PEDV is urgently required.",

The S glycoproteins of CoVs are class I fusion proteins that are generated in a locked conformation to prevent premature triggering of the fusion mechanism and are subsequently prepared for action by proteolytic processing in a step called priming [12,13]. The S protein can be cleaved by endogenous proteases, which is thought to be necessary for inducing cell\u2013cell fusion and virus-cell fusion [12,14,15,16,17]. Some endogenous proteases present in the pig small intestine potentially facilitate the entry of PEDV virions into intestinal epithelial cells [18]. However, in vitro, PEDV-infected cells produce syncytia only after treatment with an exogenous protease such as trypsin. This exogenous protease cleavage event leads to cell\u2013cell and virus\u2013cell fusion [14,16,19,20,21]. Therefore, the proteases responsible for PEDV activation may be potential therapeutic targets.",

As previously described, transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and human airway trypsin-like protease (HAT) can facilitate the spread of human influenza viruses [22,23,24,25]. TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 play important roles in influenza virus replication, supporting the spread of influenza virus in the absence of trypsin [26]. Subsequent studies confirmed that TMPRSS2 also can activate the spike protein of human coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [27,28,29] and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [30,31]. Zmora et al. evaluated seven TTSPs previously reported to activate the surface proteins of influenza A viruses (FLUAVs), MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV and found that mosaic serine protease large-form (MSPL) and differentially expressed squamous cell carcinoma gene 1 (DESC1) contributed to viral spread in the host [32]. Moreover, the role of TMPRSS2 in the release of PEDV from infected cells was clarified [33]. However, the effects of transmembrane serine proteases on host infection by animal coronaviruses, especially PEDV, have not been thoroughly studied thus far.",

Expression of the four TTSPs in transfected Vero cells was detected via indirect immunofluorescence, western blot assay and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). As shown in Figure 1A,B, the four TTSPs were successfully expressed in Vero cells transiently transfected with pCMV-Myc plasmids expressing TMPRSS2, HAT, DESC1, or MSPL. TTSPs were expressed at the cellular plasma membrane, and the number of HAT-positive cells was lower than that for the other three TTSP-positive cells (Figure 1A). The expression of most proteases was readily detectable with the proper predicted size for each, as previously published [32], but the proteases were not expressed in Vero cells transfected with empty pCMV-Myc plasmid (Figure 1B). TTSPs are synthesized as inactive single-chain zymogens and undergo self-cleavage into active forms during or after transport to cell surfaces [43,44]. DESC1 and MSPL were found to be activated and to form bands presenting the cleaved catalytic domain of mature forms. Moreover, we analyzed TTSP expression levels by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of stained cells. The most prominent signal was measured in TMPRSS2-expressing cells, followed by MSPL- and DESC1-expressing cells. The fluorescence signal obtained from HAT-expressing cells was the weakest (Figure 1C).",

No TMPRSS2, HAT, DESC1, or MSPL mRNA was detected in the Vero cells in this study. Next, the effects of these proteases on PEDV replication in Vero cells exogenously expressing TTSPs were examined. Following transfection, Vero cells were infected with PEDV in the presence or absence of trypsin. As shown in Figure 2A, in the absence of trypsin, the viral titers of PEDV propagated in Vero cells transfected with pCMV-Myc expressing TMPRSS2 and MSPL were clearly higher than those of PEDV propagated in Vero cells expressing HAT and DESC1. Among the TTSPs, the viral titers in Vero cells expressing TMPRSS2 and MSPL were almost 102.5 to 104.5 times higher than those in the empty-plasmid group and even 3- to 30-fold higher than those in Vero cells cultured with trypsin (3 \u03bcg/mL). Moreover, the viral RNA levels in each group were determined by qPCR at different time points post-infection. As shown in Figure 2B, at 72 h post-infection, viral RNA levels in Vero cells expressing MSPL were significantly higher than those in the other groups, and the viral mRNA relative quantity in trypsin-treated cells was slightly higher than that in TMPRSS2-transfected cells. However, the efficacy of TMPRSS2 in activating PEDV replication was almost the same as that of 3 \u03bcg/mL trypsin and was higher than that of HAT or DESC1 at 84 h post-infection. These findings indicate that MSPL and TMPRSS2 play important roles in PEDV infection.",

This assessment was confirmed upon determination of the PCC for TTSPs and S protein signals. The S signals correlated well with those of TMPRSS2 and MSPL, indicating extensive co-localization, whereas little correlation was measured for the S protein and HAT or DESC1 signals (Figure 4B).

Cleavage of PEDV S was detected upon the coexpression of TMPRSS2 and MSPL. The size of cleavage fragments were the same, approximately 35 kDa. In contrast, coexpressing of HAT or DESC1 did not facilitate PEDV S cleavage. Shirato et al. found that PEDV S protein could be cleaved by co-expression with TMPRSS2, the cleavage C-terminal fraction of S protein detected was 160 kDa [33]. Therefore, our study further confirmed the roles of TMPRSS2 and MSPL in the PEDV S protein activation. The effects of TMPRSS2 and MSPL on PEDV S protein cleavage may be responsible for facilitating the replication of PEDV.",

The endogenous TTSP level is up-regulated in IECs after PEDV infection, which was similar to that in piglet small intestine tissues infected with PEDV (Figure 6B).

The effect of trypsin on the isolation of strain B was not significant. However, the effect of strain B cultured in Vero cells expressing TMPRSS2 and MSPL was better than trypsin treatment; the viral mRNA level in Vero cells expressing MSPL was two times higher than that of the trypsin group after three serial passages (Figure 7B).

            "text": "During the 1970s and 1990s, PEDV caused widespread epidemics in multiple swine-producing countries in Europe [5,45,46,47]. Since then, severe outbreaks have emerged in a number of Asian countries, including Japan [48], China [49], South Korea [50], and Thailand [51]. Recently, PEDV has been spreading rapidly among swine farms in the United States, resulting in high piglet mortality in more than 32 states [52,53], and similar outbreaks have also been reported in Canada and Mexico [1,3,4,6]. Currently, severe PED is one of the most important diseases affecting pig farming in China [54]. However, the effectiveness of the CV777-based vaccine has been questioned because PED outbreaks have also occurred in vaccinated herds [55]. Therefore, there is an urgent need to improve the protective efficacy of vaccines and to develop new vaccines. However, PEDV isolation in vitro remains challenging, as the isolated virus may gradually lose infectivity upon continued passaging in cell cultures supplemented with trypsin [1]. Recently, we attempted to isolate PEDV from clinical samples, using porcine intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and found that PEDV isolates were better adapted to growth in IECs than in Vero cells [34], indicating that some trypsin-like proteases present in the IECs facilitated the propagation of PEDV. Moreover, previous research has suggested that several TTSPs located in the mucosal epithelium play critical roles in viral infectivity through the activation of viral surface proteins [23,27,31,32]. At the beginning of this study, we designed primers according to the predicted sequences of swine TTSPs from national center for biotechnology information (NCBI), and attempted to amplify the full-length TTSP genes from the trachea, bronchus, lung, and small intestine tissues of piglet and IECs. However, we failed to obtain the porcine TTSP genes. We speculate that differences may exist between the actual sequences and predicted sequences. Although TTSPs are the host proteases of respiratory and digestive tract mucosa, the TTSP expression levels may be low or limited in some conditions or over a period of time, which results in difficulty in obtaining actual porcine TTSP genes. Therefore, we studied human TTSPs (TMPRSS2, HAT, DESC1, and MSPL) to explore their effects on PEDV replication.",

TMPRSS2 and MSPL are predominantly expressed in the fetal liver and kidney [56] and on the brush-border of the duodenum [57]. HAT is predominantly expressed in the trachea [58,59], whereas DESC1 is restricted to the epithelia of the skin and oral cavity [60,61]. In this study, we confirmed the presence of TMPRSS2, HAT, DESC1, and MSPL in the small intestines of normal piglets and IECs, and we also found that the mRNA levels of these TTSPs increased in PEDV-infected small intestine tissues and IECs. Whether or not the endogenous presence of TTSPs in the small intestines of piglets contributes to viral spread in infected piglets remains to be determined, and knock-out mice, as well as specific protease inhibitors, might be useful tools for these endeavors. Previous studies demonstrated that TTSPs play key roles in hormone or growth factor activation, epithelial differentiation, and the initiation of proteolytic cascades [62,63]. The mechanism underlying the effects of up-regulated TTSPs in PEDV-infected piglet small intestine tissues requires further investigation. The inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and MSPL may be potential candidates for treatment of PEDV. Moreover, according to a comparison of the promotion effects of these TTSPs on viral replication and titers in vitro, TMPRSS2 and MSPL were particularly strong, suggesting that members of the hepsin/TMPRSS/enteropeptidase subfamily may activate PEDV emergence due to their specific structure. Additional research is underway to determine whether other members of the hepsin/TMPRSS/enteropeptidase subfamily are able to activate PEDV.",

MSPL exhibited the strongest effect followed by TMPRSS2. It has been suggested that the addition of trypsin mediates cell\u2013cell fusion in PEDV-infected cells [64], thus demonstrating that TMPRSS2 and MSPL exhibit trypsin-like characteristics that facilitate cell\u2013cell fusion. However, it should be noted that the cell\u2013cell fusion assay allows the interaction of cell surfaces on which large amounts of receptors and proteases may be expressed, and therefore it might not fully mirror virus\u2013cell fusion.",

Thus, we used the previously published TTSP inhibitor AEBSF-HCl [41] to assess whether TTSPs (TMPRSS2, HAT, DESC1, and MSPL) activate PEDV entry into cells in the absence of trypsin. We found that viral RNA levels were decreased in a dose-dependent manner following AEBSF-HCl treatment. Additionally, we found that the level of viral mRNA increased in a dose-dependent manner in Vero cells expressing TMPRSS2 and MSPL, but not HAT and DESC1 at the stage of virus entry [65]. These results suggest that the activating effect of TMPRSS2 and, in particular, MSPL, on PEDV entry into cells was greater than that of HAT and DESC1. Although Liu et al. found that TMPRSS2 did not increase the entry of PEDV pseudoviruses into Huh-7 cells [66], several studies suggested that some candidate cellular enzymes, such as TTSPs could activate PEDV replication [41,64], and that human TMPRSS2 has been shown to enhance the multicycle replication of PEDV [33].",

Thus, an assessment of the co-localization of TTSPs with the PEDV S protein was performed, and our results showed that the PEDV S protein co-localized extensively with MSPL and TMPRSS2, indicating that these TTSPs might interact with the PEDV S protein to promote viral entry into cells. It is worth noting that PEDV-activating TTSPs co-localized with S protein, whereas inactive TTSPs did not, despite robust expression (such as DESC1) in the cellular system analyzed. It is therefore conceivable that the cellular localization of a TTSP, apart from its substrate specificity, might determine whether the protease can activate S and other viral glycoproteins; this possibility deserves further investigation. It has been confirmed that TTSPs cleave and activate the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV S proteins, and the cleaved fragments of the S protein may induce subtle conformational changes that increase its sensitivity for binding to its receptor [15]. We also attempted to verify the cleavage of S protein by TTSPs, and we found TMPRSS2 and MSPL could cleave PEDV S protein with the same size of cleavage fragments, but HAT and DESC1 could not. Therefore, our study further confirmed the roles of TMPRSS2 and MSPL in the PEDV S protein activation. However, the mechanisms of S protein activation by TTSPs for PEDV entry have not been clearly demonstrated, and additional research is under way to further investigate these mechanisms.",
