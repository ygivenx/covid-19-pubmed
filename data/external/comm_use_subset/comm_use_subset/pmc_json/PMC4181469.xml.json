            "text": "The distance distribution within an RNA molecule is of interest in various contexts. Most directly, the question arises whether panhandle-like structures (in which 3\u2019 and 5\u2019 ends of long RNA molecules are placed in close proximity) are the rule or an exception. Panhandles have been reported in particular for many RNA virus genomes. Several studies [1-4] agree based on different models that the two ends of single-stranded RNA molecules are typically not far apart. On a more technical level, the problem to compute the partition function over RNA secondary structures with given end-to-end distance d, usually measured as the number of external bases (plus possibly the number of structural domains) arises for instance when predicting nucleic acid secondary structure in the presence of single-stranded binding proteins [5] or in models of RNA subjected to pulling forces (e.g. in atom force microscopy or export through a small pore) [6-8]. It also plays a role for the effect of loop energy parameters [9].",

            "text": "In contrast to the end-to-end distance, the graph-distance between two arbitrarily prescribed nucleotides in a larger RNA structure does not seem to have been studied in any detail. However, this is of particular interest in the analysis of single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) experiments [10]. This technique allows to monitor the distance between two dye-labeled nucleotides and can reveal details of the kinetics of RNA folding in real time. It measures the non-radiative energy transfer between the dye-labeled donor and acceptor positions. The efficiency of this energy transfer, E\nfret\n, strongly depends on the spatial distance R according to Efret=R06/(R06+R6). The F\u00f6rster radius R0 sets the length scale, e.g. R0\u224854 \u00c5 for the Cy3-Cy5 dye pair. A major obstacle is that, at present, there is no general and efficient way to link smFRET measurements to interpretations in terms of explicit molecular structures. To solve this problem, a natural first step is to compute the distribution of spatial distances for an equilibrium ensemble of 3D structures. Since this is not feasible in practice despite major progress in the field of RNA 3D structure prediction [11], we can only resort to considering the graph-distances on the ensemble of RNA secondary structures instead. From a computer science point of view, furthermore, we show here that the distance distribution can be computed exactly using a dynamic programming approach. Although a crude approximation of reality, our initial results indicate that the graph-distance can be related to the smFRET data such as those reported by [12] and help to explain effects of RNA structures in pre-mRNA splicing and viral subgenomic RNA species.",

Furthermore, only a limited range of distance changes (e.g. 20 \u00c5-100 \u00c5 for Cy3-Cy5) can be reported by the FRET experiments. Thus a more useful formulation of our problem is not to use the full expected quantity for all positions. Instead, we are interested in the average for all distance-values within some threshold \u03b8\nd\n. As the space and time complexity will depend on the number of distances we consider, we will parametrise our complexity by the number of nucleotides n and the number of distances considered D = \u03b8\nd \n+ 1, as well.

In principle, this case looks similar to the case for \u03a90. However, we have to take into considerations the paths between v and w over the base pair {p,q}. Thus, we need to store the partition function for all inside and outside for each \u227a-minimal arc {p,q} that covers v and w, which we will call Zp,qv,w[dO,dI]. In principle, a similar recursion as defined for Z0v,w in equation (3) can be derived, with the additional complication since we have to take care of the additional outside distance due to the arc {p,q}.

Our key observation here is that the dependency between d\n\u2113\n and d\nr\n can be used to reduce the time complexity. Instead of using the variables d\n\u2113\n and d\nr\n in Zi,jB,v[d\u2113,dr], we use the pair d\n\u2113\n,dadd in Zi,jB,v[d\u2113,d\u2113+dadd].

This results in an recursion for Zi,jB,v[d\u2113,d\u2113+dadd] with complexity O(n4D2cb2) time and O (n2Dc\nb\n) space. To be precise, there are three sub-cases as follows. ",

When the arc {i,j} is colored violet, then there is a shortest path that does not use the distance marked in red but uses the other direction together with the arc {i,j}. If -b<d\nadd\n<+b, then we know that neither a shortest path v\u21ddpi nor v\u21ddpj uses the arc {i,j}. The left distance is thus given by d\u2113-d\u2113\u2032. Using the shortcuts d\nr \n= d\n\u2113 \n+ dadd and dr\u2032=d\u2113\u2032+dadd\u2032, then the distance between l and j must be dr-dr\u2032=(d\u2113+dadd)-d\u2113\u2032+dadd\u2032. If, on the other hand, dadd = + b, then we know that there is at least one shortest path that can be composed by using a shortest path v\u21ddi, followed by the arc {i,j}. This of course implies that the shortest path v\u21ddpj is has exactly the length d\n\u2113 \n+ b, or is larger. For a sub-path l+1\u21ddp\u2032j this implies that the length is greater or equal d=dr-dr\u2032=d\u2113+b-d\u2113\u2032+dadd\u2032. Thus, we just have to add all partition functions Zk,jI\u2032[d\u2032] with d\u2032 > d.

In which, where Qi,j\u2032 is Q\ni + 1,j - 1 if j > i + 1, 1 if j = i + 1 and 0 otherwise. Note, furthermore, that all Zi,jI\u2032[d\u2032] for d\u2032< d \u2264 \u03b8\nd\n are calculated when we restrict the distance to \u03b8\nd\n.",

As an example, we consider the graph distance distribution of a Diels-Alderase (DAse) ribozyme (Figure 2A). Histograms of smFRET efficiency (E\nfret\n) for this 49 nt long catalytic RNA are reported in [12] for a large number of surface-immobilized ribozyme molecules as a function of the Mg 2+ concentration in the buffer solution. A sketch of their histograms is displayed in Figure 2B. The dyes are attached to sequence positions 6 (Cy3) and 42 (Cy5) and hence do not simply reflect the end-to-end distance, Figure 2A(c). In this example, we observe the expected correspondence small graph-distances with a strong smFRET signal. This is a particular interesting example, since the minimal free energy (mfe) structure (Figure 2A(a)) predicted with RNAfold is not identified with the real secondary structure (Figure 2A(c)). In fact, the ground state secondary structure is ranked as the 3rd best sub-optimal structure derived via RNAsubopt -e. The free energy difference between these two structures is only 0.1 kcal/mol. However, their graph-distances show a relatively larger difference. The 2nd best sub-optimal structure (Figure 2A(b)) looks rather similar with the 3rd structure, in particular, they share the same graph-distance value.",

Unfortunately, the salt dependence of RNA folding is complex [21,22] and currently is not properly modeled in the available folding programs. We can, however, make use of the qualitative correspondence of low salt concentrations with high temperature. In Figure 2C we therefore re-compute the graph-distance distribution in the ensemble at an elevated temperature of 50\u00b0C.
