            "text": "CEACAM1 (carcinoembryonic antigen related cell adhesion molecule-1) is a type 1 transmembrane protein expressed on most epithelial cells, phagocytes and activated lymphocytes [1], [2]. In the case of epithelial cells, its cell adhesion activity is associated with diverse functions including angiogenesis [3], [4], lumen formation [5], [6], [7] and the binding of extracellular pathogens [8]. In the case of neutrophils, it may play a role in the binding of neutrophils to activated endothelium and extravasation into inflamed tissues [9], [10], and similar to epithelial cells, may bind extracellular pathogens [8], [11], [12]. In the case of activated lymphocytes, it serves as an inhibitory molecule, controlling the strength and duration of the immune response [2]. CEACAM1 is a critical molecule well situated to play a communication role between epithelial cells, that represent the first barrier to infection, and immune cells that control infections that disrupt the epithelial barrier. Thus, pathogens that bind to CEACAM1 may interfere with its normal function, namely maintenance of communication between these two barriers to infection.",

The so-called \u201clong form\u201d has a cytoplasmic domain containing two ITIMs (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs) that, when phosphorylated, may bind Src homology 2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatases SHP1 and SHP2 [13] to convey inhibitory signals to the T-Cell receptor [14], [15], [16], B-Cell receptor [17], and epithelial growth factor receptor [18]. The long form also has a \u03b2-catenin binding site [19] and a filamin A binding site [20]. The so-called \u201cshort form\u201d lacks the ITIMs, but has the ability, like the long form, to bind actin, calmodulin, and annexin II [21]. These activities indicate a strong association of CEACAM1 with actin cytoskeleton [7], [21], [22].",

            "text": "Among the human extracellular pathogens known to bind to human CEACAM1, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis have been shown to bind via the expression of their Opa (colony opacity-associated) proteins leading to adherence and invasion into epithelial cells [11], [23] and engulfment by neutrophils [8], [23], [24], as well as suppression of the T-lymphocyte response [25] and killing human B cells [26] effects that presumably inhibit antibody production. As mentioned above, the inhibitory activity is mediated by phosphorylation of the ITIMs on the long form of CEACAM1 and subsequent recruitment of SHP1/2 [13], [27] that can disrupt phosphorylation of important receptors, including the insulin receptor [28], EGFR [29], TCR [14], [15], BCR [17], and TLR2 [30]. In the case of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, neutrophils, due to their high levels of CEACAM1 expression, are a major target for spreading the infection in the urogenital tract. A major limitation to studying these interactions in vivo has been the lack of an animal model, since murine CEACAM1 is not a receptor for these human pathogens. In order to overcome this limitation, we have generated a human CEACAM1 transgenic mouse that faithfully expresses human CEACAM1 in the expected tissues, including neutrophils. We demonstrate here that the neutrophils from the transgenic mice as well as human neutrophils bind gonococcal Opa52 protein expressed on E. coli. Thus, these mice should serve as an appropriate animal model at least for studying some aspects of the human pathogenesis of Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections.",

BAC2Clone (214 kb) covered a large region proximal to human CEACAM1 on chromosome 19, and two other BAC clones (BAC3 and BAC5; 138, and 211 kb, respectively) covered shorter regions flanking the human CEACAM1 gene. Although litters were obtained from mice fertilized with all three microinjections, only those from BAC2 and BAC5 transmitted the germline gene to their offspring (\nFig. 1A\n\nand data not shown), and only those from BAC2 exhibited expression of the huCEACAM1 protein in their feces (\nFig. 1B\n). Since CEACAM1 is heavily expressed in the GI tract, from the liver throughout the small and large intestine, and is shed into the lumen of the gut like CEA [34], we used its detection in the feces as an early diagnostic test for protein expression. As can be seen in \nFig. 1B\n, both murine and human CEACAM1 were detected in the feces of the founders. Only the offspring from founder 12 (BAC2) expressed the transgene. As expected, roughly 50% of the pups were positive for human CEACAM1 by both PCR analysis of tail samples (\nFig. 1C\n) and western blot analysis of fecal samples (\nFig. 1D\n) of the F1 generation from founder 12 (BAC2). Further breeding of the BAC2-12 transgenic mice demonstrated transmission of an expressed CEACAM1 transgene from the F1 to F2 generation at the expected (\u223c0.5) frequency for heterozygotes. No attempt was made to breed the BAC2-12 line to homozygosity at this stage of the study. Expression of the human CEACAM1 transgene was not detected in any of the BAC5 founders or their F1 offspring. Given the small number of litters obtained from each microinjection, it was not feasible for us to evaluate the success rate in terms of stable integration and expression of the various BAC clones.",

Using human specific probes for CEACAM1, we were able to demonstrate that the human gene is on chromosome 19 of human cells (\nFig. 2A\n), as expected, and the BAC2 clone containing the human CEACAM1 gene was on chromosome 11 of the transgenic mice (\nFig. 2C\u2013D\n). Although we did not confirm the location of the endogenous murine Ceacam1 gene, it has been reported to be on chromosome 7 [35], [36]. Thus, the murine Ceacam1 and human CEACAM1 genes are on different chromosomes of the transgenic mice. Since mRNA from the human CEACAM1 can be alternatively spliced, it was also important to determine if the expected splice forms were present. For this analysis, RNA was isolated from BAC2-12 transgenic mouse liver, kidney and small intestine and analyzed by PCR using specific primers for the major splice forms expected in human CEACAM1. As seen in \nFig. 3A\n, transgenic mouse liver expressed human CEACAM1-4S and -3S isoforms, while transgenic kidney and small intestine expressed the -4L and -3L isoforms. Analysis of the endogenous expression of murine CEACAM1 isoforms revealed the -4S and -2S isoforms in the liver and intestine, while the kidney expressed mainly the -2S isoform (\nFig. 3B\n). Since mice express a highly homologous second allele, namely CEACAM2, mainly expressed in the testes and kidney, we cannot be sure if the kidney PCR products are from murine CEACAM1 or CEACAM2. The differences in tissue specific CEACAM1 isoform expression between mouse and man has been previously described [37], [38].",

First we analyzed heart as a negative tissue to eliminate the possibility that inappropriate expression occurred. Neither murine nor human CEACAM1 was expressed in the hearts of BAC2-12 transgenic mice, and wild type FVB mouse heart is shown as an additional control (\nFig. 4A\u2013C\n). Three tissues that exhibit high expression of CEACAM1 in both mouse and human are the intestine, kidney, and liver. As seen in \nFig. 4D\u2013F\n, the expression of human CEACAM1 is similar to murine CEACAM1 in the small intestine in terms of distribution and intensity. As expected, both the murine and human CEACAM1 are expressed on on the luminal surface of intestinal epithelial cells. In the case of the kidney, the expression of human CEACAM1 is noticeably higher than the expression of murine CEACAM1 (compare \nFig. 4H\n to \nFig. 4G\n, transgenic, and \nFig. 4I\n, wild type FVB). This difference may be explained by the fact that mice have two Ceacam genes (Ceacam1 and Ceacam2) that are differentially expressed in the kidney [35], [37], while humans have a single CEACAM1 gene. Thus, the expression of the human gene in the kidney may reflect the combined expression of the two genes in mouse; however, the anti-murine CEACAM1 antibody used here does not detect murine CEACAM2. The reason for the differential expression of the two mouse genes in the kidney is unexplained, but may reflect a role for the kidney in insulin clearance (see below). In the case of the liver, the staining pattern for murine and human CEACAM1 in the transgenic animals is identical (\nFig. 4J\u2013K\n). The pattern shows highest expression around the portal triads with decreased expression around the portal artery. This may reflect the known function of CEACAM1 in effecting insulin clearance [39]. The observed CEACAM1 expression pattern follows the entrance of blood from the portal circulation and exit via the portal artery. The staining pattern for the murine CEACAM1 of wild type mice liver (\nFig. 4L\n) is similar but less intense. Further quantitative studies are required to determine if there is a real difference in degree of expression of the endogenous murine Ceacam1 gene between the wild type and transgenic animals.",

The pattern is consistent with the highest levels of expression in proximal tubules (less open lumen) and the lowest in distal tubules (more open lumen). In all cases the staining is on the luminal surface of the renal tubules. CEACAM1 is also expressed on the luminal surface of epithelial cells of the Bowman's capsules surrounding the glomeruli in the kidney (arrow, \nFig. 5B\n).

This role has been documented in mammary epithelial cells grown in either a 3D culture [5], [6], [7] or in humanized mammary fat pads in NOD/SCID mice [41], [42]. CEACAM1 is also expressed on the luminal surface of prostate glands [43], and like its expression in the mammary gland, is down-regulated in cancer [44]. As a first step in using these transgenic animals as a model for mammary and prostate cancer we examined its expression in these tissues. In the case of the mammary gland, it was necessary to study pregnant females, since the mammary gland is minimally developed in non-pregnant females. As shown in \nFig. 6A\u2013C\n, there was strong luminal expression of both murine and human CEACAM1 in the mammary glands of pregnant transgenic mice. There was also evidence for cytoplasmic expression, perhaps indicating active transport of CEACAM1 from the site of synthesis to the lumen. Similar results were seen for the prostate glands of male human CEACAM1 transgenic mice (\nFig. 6\n\n D\u2013F). These results suggest that these mice may be an appropriate model for studying the role of human CEACAM1 in tumorigenesis within these organs.",

The situation is especially critical in the case of Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections where there is a pressing need for the development of a vaccine [2]. Since the high expression of CEACAM1 on neutrophils plays an important role in its pathogenesis, we determined the expression levels of huCEACAM1 on neutrophils isolated from the bone marrow and blood of the transgenic animals. As shown in \nFig. 7\n, the expression of murine and human CEACAM1 in the transgenic animals was strong. As shown in \nFig. 8(A\u2013C)\n, the staining of murine and human CEACAM1 was strong for neutrophils in blood smears taken from the human CEACAM1+/\u2212 transgenic animals, while staining for human CEACAM1 was negative for a CEACAM1\u2212/\u2212 littermate. For purposes of comparison, neutrophils from a human blood smear were stained (\nFig. 8D\n). Notably, human neutrophils stain more intensely than those from the transgenic animals, suggesting a possible effect of an expression difference between the species. In addition, we examined the expression of human CEACAM1 in the spleen of transgenic animals. Based on cell surface staining, there was no expression on T-cells and significant expression on B-cells (\nFig. 9A\n). Consistent with these results, CEACAM1 has been shown to be inducible on both murine [45] and human T-cells [14]. The expression of CEACAM1 on murine [46] and human [17], [47] B-cells has been previously reported. Activation of splenocytes from transgenic animals by anti-CD3/28 antibodies for three days revealed increased expression of murine, but not human CEACAM1 in T-cells (\nFig. 9B\n). B-cell expression of murine and human CEACAM1 is shown for comparison.",

As shown in \nFig. 10\n, primed neutrophils from transgenic animals were able to bind E.coli-Opa52 much greater than E. coli-vector control.

Since pathogens that utilize human CEACAM1 as their receptor do not recognize murine CEACAM1, such a model is essential to study their pathogenesis. Furthermore, in order to demonstrate that CEACAM1 specific anti-pathogen vaccines are effective, the model must mimic the human tissue specific pattern of CEACAM1 expression. Thus, our approach was to generate transgenic mice that expressed the entire human CEACAM1 gene rather than a cDNA for CEACAM1. Although we attempted to generate several lines using BAC clones that spanned different regions of chromosome 19 encoding the CEACAM1 gene, only a single line that actually expressed the protein was generated. Given the large number of variables that affect both integration, expression, and transmission of a gene, the reason for this result is unknown. Fortunately, the BAC2-12 line obtained transmitted the transgene from the founder mouse to F1 and F2 generations and demonstrated the expected frequency for heterozygotic expression in subsequent generations. Furthermore, human specific splice forms were found in three major tissues (liver, intestine and kidney) of known CEACAM1 expression and tissue staining for human CEACAM1 demonstrated the expected staining pattern, namely at the lumen of epithelial cells.",

Murine Ceacam1 generates mRNAs having mainly 4 or 2 ectodomains with long or short cytoplasmic domains. Indeed, the expected major splice isoforms of murine Ceacam1 were found in the liver, intestine, and kidney of both control and transgenic mice with a predominance of the -2S isoform. The human CEACAM1 gene, in contrast, generates mRNAs with different splice isoforms, namely -4L/S and -3L/S. The expected human splice isoforms were observed in the BAC2-12 transgenic line, with a predominance of -4S in the liver and -4L in the intestine and kidney. Given the differences in murine and human splice isoforms observed in the transgenic animals, we conclude that the information governing the production of differentially spliced mRNA isoforms must be encoded in their respective genes. A comparison of the gene sequences at putative splice recognition sites may reveal which motifs are responsible for the observed mRNA species and tissue specific splicing. Preliminary studies on the human gene have begun to identify motifs responsible for generation of the long and short cytoplasmic domain splice forms [48]. The ratio of long and short CEACAM1 protein isoforms could critically affect cell function, since the short form lacks the ITIM motif. While the significance of the number of ectodomains is less well understood, the relative strength of cell-cell adhesion may be affected [2].",

Notably, murine CEACAM1 was found in the developing gut, lung, and kidney epithelium. However, the occurrence of two Ceacam genes in the mouse (and not in human) complicates the picture, with the Ceacam2 gene mainly expressed in the kidney and testis [37]. The high expression of CEACAM1 in murine liver is striking and has been shown to regulate insulin clearance [39]. The pattern of human CEACAM1 expression closely mimics the mouse, with perhaps a caveat about the differential expression of the two murine Ceacam genes in the mouse. In our study of the human CEACAM1 transgenic mouse, we were able to compare the staining of tissues for mouse and human CEACAM1. Except for the kidney, the tissue staining patterns and intensities were similar. In the case of the kidney, the patterns were identical but the intensity of staining for human CEACAM1 was greater than for murine CEACAM1. This result probably reflects the higher expression of murine Ceacam2 (not measured) over that of Ceacam1 in the kidney.",

Since Neisseria may adhere to and be phagocytosed by neutrophils via a variety of receptors, we chose to demonstrate Opa52 binding using E. coli expressing this protein. As expected, the Opa52 positive bacteria were bound in greater numbers by the transgenic neutrophils than the Opa52 negative bacteria. Thus, the model appears to mimic what is observed with human neutrophils using Opa52 positive Neisseria.
