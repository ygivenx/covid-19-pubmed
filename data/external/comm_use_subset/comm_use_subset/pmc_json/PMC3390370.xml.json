Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain how rejection of an antigenically foreign fetus is prevented, from the absence of classical MHC class I molecules [2], to regulatory T cell expansion [3] and specific suppression of paternally-derived antigens [4], [5]. Pregnancy is also associated with reduced pathology and alleviation of symptoms in inflammatory autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis [6] and rheumatoid arthritis [7]. The profound immunological changes in these disease states during pregnancy suggests that there exists a broad impact on immune regulation that is not specific to fetal antigens.",

Of these, the increased risk of severe influenza infection is of particular public health concern. Pregnancy has been an acknowledged risk factor for severe complications from influenza virus infection for nearly a century [15], and has been observed during every major influenza pandemic including the pandemics of 1918 [15], 1957 [16], 1968 [17], and 2009 [18]\u2013[20]. Implications of a severe influenza infection during pregnancy are life threatening for mother and child. Significantly increased risks of cardiopulmonary events have been reported [14], and mortality for the mother can be as high as 45% [21]. Moreover, consequences to the fetus range from behavioral alterations and low birthweight, to preterm birth and spontaneous abortion [21]\u2013[24]. Significant effort has been put into determining the safety and efficacy of vaccination during pregnancy [25], [26], as well as the efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors [20], [27], but a deeper understanding of the changes in maternal immunity during pregnancy are needed in order to devise adequate therapeutic strategies.",

Estrogen treatment leads to early reductions in cytokine production, in particular type-I interferon (IFN), impacting downstream activation of adaptive immunity. Additionally, estrogen treatment compromises effective antigen-specific cytotoxicity. Ultimately these deficiencies result in significantly delayed viral clearance in pregnant animals, highlighting the presence of an anti-inflammatory mechanism in the context of enhanced morbidity.",

This weight loss was delayed by approximately 2 days when compared to the weight loss of non-pregnant controls, suggesting that immune-associated morbidities were delayed in pregnant animals (Figure 1B). Significant morbidity was readily evident in measures of gestational health. The number of fetuses per mother were not effected by infection in our model (Figure 1C), but fetuses from influenza-infected mice failed to achieve the weight of their counterparts from mock-infected mothers. By E18.5 they were nearly 35% below the weight of controls (Figure 1D). The length of gestation was also significantly impacted by infection with influenza virus. Infected pregnant mice undergo labor much earlier than their mock-infected controls (Figure 1E). All mock infected pregnant mice continued gestation beyond the bounds of our experiments, while infected mice universally delivered by E19. Pups delivered by influenza-infected mothers were therefore not only premature, but additionally underweight for their gestational age. These results reinforce the evidence that the viability of the pregnancy is negatively impacted by infection with influenza virus, with a significant burden borne by the fetus, as is seen in clinical situations [23], [37].",

IFN-\u03b3 levels were equivalent in both placebo and estrogen treatment (Figure 6E).

Circulating levels of estrogen in female mice have been associated with stimulating immune function in general, including exacerbating influenza virus pathogenesis [48]. This accounts for the relative susceptibility to influenza virus infection in non-pregnant females compared to males. This effect can be abolished by gonadectomy.

Indeed, we saw a strong trend towards elevated levels of the chemokine KC in the steady state of pregnancy, followed by significant deficit in KC expression upon infection. This complex regulation highlights the elaborate mechanisms involved in estrogen signaling [62]. Pregnancy presents additional layers of complexity in cytokine regulation. Several hormones circulating in pregnancy are immunologically active, including progesterone and prolactin [39], [63]. We did not observe identical regulation of all cytokines in pregnancy and estrogen-treatment, and some of these other hormones may account for some of this variation.

The ability of estrogen to suppress cytokine expression has been proposed as protective in influenza virus pathogenesis [48]. Indeed, it may be that estrogen plays a protective role during pregnancy by muting early cytokine responses that would otherwise threaten fetal development [22], [54]. Enhanced morbidities experienced during pregnancy may rely on the failure to clear virus following an impaired immune response. Prolonged infection may result in a late cytokine response triggering premature delivery and significant morbidity. Delayed weight loss in pregnant animals supports the hypothesis of a late development inducing pathology. Alternatively, prolonged infection may lead to significant lung damage. Others have reported that delayed lung repair during pregnancy leads significant cardiopulmonary demands during pregnancy, and may contribute to morbidity [31].",

We did not find any evidence that estrogen treatment interfered with downstream signaling pathways, suggesting that this effect is mediated by reduced type-I interferon expression. ISG levels were reduced not only in the lung, but additionally in the periphery. This is an important observation, as interferon signaling in the periphery is necessary for efficient antiviral immunity [42].

These numbers eventually recovered by 9dpi, correlating nicely with the kinetics of viral clearance in this model. Because the observed phenotype results in delays in CD8 T cell recruitment to the lung, the timing of this observation is critical. Observations made late in infection may not reflect this phenotype and may explain why others have failed to note significant differences in the numbers of cytotoxic T cells in similar models [31].

The key deficit appears to be in priming of dendritic cells that migrate from the lungs to lymph nodes to initiate T cell expansion. This disruption in interferon signaling leads to suboptimal CD8 T cell activation and delayed viral clearance. Estrogen also appears to impair CD8 T cell cytotoxicity independently of dendritic cell activity. It is not currently clear how these anti-inflammatory effects impact the viability of pregnancy, particularly fetal development and premature delivery, but evidence suggests it may play a protective role. Deficits in viral clearance and prolonged exposure to infection may be act as stressors that trigger delayed morbidities despite the anti-inflammatory effects of estrogen.

            "text": "There is overwhelming clinical value to understanding the mechanisms and contributions of sex hormones to immune modulation during pregnancy. Animal models, such as those described in this report, allow for controlled infection conditions and detailed observation of early events during infection. Understanding the mechanisms and immunological outcomes of pregnancy, particularly the role of steroid hormones, may lead to the development of therapeutic options for protection of women, their children, and patients receiving hormone replacement therapy. Establishing the tenets of hormone mediated immune modulation may provide testable hypotheses for treatment of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis.",

Mice were anesthetized with Avertin (Tribromoethanol, Acros Organics) and shaved behind the right ear. The pellet was implanted via small incision between the shoulder and ear and secured with a surgical clip. Mice were monitored for signs of infection. For experiments using a single dose of estradiol, mice received a single 100\u00b5g subcutaneous injection of water soluble 17-\u03b2-estradiol (Sigma) six hours prior to receiving target cells for in vivo cytotoxicity assay.
