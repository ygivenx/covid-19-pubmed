Results of this analysis revealed that the blood, heart, liver, spleen, kidney, Bursa of Fabricius (BF), thymus, and Harder's glands were positive at 4-h postinoculation (PI), with about 104.93-107.57 copies/g.

Numbers of GPV DNA decreased at 6 days, and by 9 days, the level of GPV DNA decreased remarkably. Importantly, the level of GPV DNA was comparable to that in the other organs at 3-days PI; the liver, spleen, thymus, Harder's glands, and BF had significantly higher numbers of GPV DNA than the rest of the tissues, with >1010 copies/g in the former tissues compared to <108 copies/g in the rest of the tissues.

Similarly, our study showed that GPV was distributed in the blood, heart, liver, spleen, kidney, BF, thymus, and Harder's glands at 4-h PI. Subsequently, GPV was consistently distributed in all the segments of the organs at 8-h PI. The copy numbers of GPV in the liver, spleen, thymus, Harder's glands, and BF was significantly higher than that in the other regions.

Tissues were surgically removed from the goslings and frozen at -80\u00b0C, weighed, and homogenized using an Omni PCR Tissue Homogenizer (Omni). Normal tissue sample sizes were 20 mg. For the assays, tissue samples were homogenized in 1 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4). The homogenizer was washed multiple times between each tissue homogenization. DNA was extracted from the tissue samples by using the method described by Cheng [30]. Using this assay, we could quantify the viral load. All the samples were analyzed 3 times. The viral concentrations were expressed as the mean log10 virus genome copy numbers per g or 1 mL of the tested tissue or blood.",
