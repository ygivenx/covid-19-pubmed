Conventional manual extraction methods are labor-intensive, susceptible to contamination and handling variations [4], [5]. The demand for automated systems has grown markedly as a result of increasing PCR testing since the onset of pH1N1 [2], especially at regional clinical and public health laboratories where specially trained staff are limited. Most automated extractors are designed to batch a significant number of samples and are not suitable for smaller laboratories because the costs of equipment, its maintenance, space requirements and need for disposables are prohibitive [5], [6]. Recently, the Maxwell 16 System (Promega, US), a compact and simple desk-top unit, was developed to extract viral total NA automatically from human plasma or serum samples based on a magnetic bead separation technique [7]. Its performance has been evaluated by the manufacturer using hepatitis B and C virus, cytomegalovirus samples, etc [7]. However, no formal assessment of extracting flu-v RNA via this system has so far been reported.",

There were no statistical differences in the Ct values and detection rates. Nevertheless, the Ct values of mock-infected poultry fecal samples (n = 32) and human fecal samples (n = 18) were increased by 1.55 and 4.72 cycles, respectively, for the Maxwell 16-S and 0.71 and 2.65 cycles, respectively, for the QIAamp method compared to those of viral controls. The results indicate that more RT-PCR inhibitors were co-extracted with viral RNA by Maxwell 16-S than by QIAamp Kit, which led to more false negatives. Of the 14 false-negative samples following Maxwell 16-S extraction, 9 turned positive after a 10-fold dilution of their extracts. To improve the capacity of the Maxwell 16 System to remove inhibitors from fecal matrix in a simple and effective way, Maxwell 16-M (100-\u00b5l input and 100-\u00b5l output) was adopted for further investigation. With Maxwell 16-M extraction, RRT-PCR detected flu-v in all fecal samples and gave improved Ct values for weak-positive samples found by Maxwell 16-S extraction (Appendix S1).",

The performance of this automated procedure on the respiratory samples (including throat swabs and BALFs) was largely in agreement with its analytic performance on the virus stock. That is, greater sensitivity reflected by the lower Ct values for both the viral and cellular RNA was obtained from Maxwell 16-S compared with the QIAamp method. In contrast to the reference method and indicated by internal positive control, fewer or no PCR inhibitors existed in the throat swabs after Maxwell 16-S extraction. Similar findings were noted by Reznikov et al. [13], who found that throat swabs were free of PCR inhibitor, and by Loens et al. [4], who validated that a magnetic particle-based automated system extracted NA more efficiently from throat swabs (higher recovery and/or fewer inhibitors) than a QIAamp column method, and observed that PCR inhibitors existed in fewer throat swabs. BALFs contained high concentrations of compounds inhibiting PCR that could not be removed by various methods [14]. In our study, comparison of Ct values between viral controls and the virus-spiked BALFs extracted by the same method clearly revealed that these inhibitory effects of BALFs on RT-PCR were reduced after extraction by Maxwell 16-S compared to the QIAamp method, which might contribute to the higher sensitivity of Maxwell 16-S in this sample matrix.",

            "text": "Fecal material (feces, rectal or cloacal swabs) is an alternative matrix for detection of flu-v in poultry as well as in humans [15], [16], [17]. However, the fecal matrix has been recognized as a difficult and heterogeneous sample matrix for molecular analysis owing to its complex chemical composition and potential for PCR inhibition [3], [17], [18], [19], [20]. In our study, RNA extracts from fecal samples by Maxwell 16-S possessed more inhibitors than those obtained by the QIAamp method, which resulted in the reduced detection sensitivity of the former method. The inhibitors may act not only on the PCR amplification process, but also on pre-PCR processing procedures [21]. Therefore, a proper reduction in starting sample volume may outcompete dilution of extracts alone (also including an increase of elution volume) in removing inhibitors. This concept was supported by the findings that all the same fecal samples that showed false-negative results after Maxwell 16-S extraction and partially positive results when their extracts were diluted 10-fold were detected as positive after Maxwell 16-M extraction. The differential performances of Maxwell 16 System between the respiratory samples and fecal samples suggest that an increase in input and/or a decrease in output is beneficial for NA detection for some sample matrices with concentrated NA, but may be detrimental for other sample matrices that possesses increased inhibitors, and vice versa. Supporting evidence also comes from the detection of SARS coronavirus by RRT-PCR, the sensitivity of which increased with increased input of nasopharyngeal aspirate or human plasma [22], [23], whereas remained the same or decreased with increased input of feces [18]. Moreover, in our study, the Ct values of fecal samples after Maxwell 16-M extraction were improved in samples with higher inhibitor concentrations but delayed in samples with no or fewer inhibitors after Maxwell 16-S extraction (Appendix S1). Therefore, the sample volume should be optimized to balance the recovery of RNA and the removal of inhibitors in the application of the Maxwell 16 System to every sample type.",
