The most efficient and common tick vectors appear to be members of the Hyalomma genus, which commonly infest livestock and other animals. CCHF causes a severe human disease, with a fatality rate of 15\u201370% [3]. Due to the haemorrhagic nature of the disease, it can also cause nosocomial infections of health-care workers [4]. Although clinical predictors of mortality have been developed [5], correlates of protection are not fully understood. Detectable antibody responses are usually required for survival, but are not predictive of recovery [6]. Therefore it is likely that both antibody and CD8-positive T lymphocytes are required for protection.",

Additionally, concerns over the potential use of CCHFv as a bioterrorism agent have led to the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to list the virus as a Category C priority pathogen. Due to the severity of disease, ease of transmission, and the fact that no antiviral compounds or vaccines have been proven to be effective against it, CCHFv is classified as a hazard group 4 pathogen by the UK Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens.",

            "text": "A vaccine based on CCHFv, amplified in suckling mouse brain and inactivated by chloroform treatment, has been used in Eastern Europe, but is unlicensed by the European Medicines Agency or US Food and Drug Administration. A recent study found that it elicited both a cellular and humoral response to CCHFv, but neutralising antibody titres were low, even in people who had received 4 doses [13]. Controlled studies on protective efficacy have not been reported with this vaccine and, due to its crude preparation, it is unlikely to gain widespread international regulatory approval. Development of a vaccine that meets current international standards is needed. The genome of CCHFv is distributed over three RNA segments: small (S), medium (M), and large (L), which encode the viral nucleoprotein, glycoprotein and RNA polymerase, respectively. The M segment is approximately 5.4 kbp in length and encodes a polyprotein precursor that undergoes proteolytic cleavage events [14], [15]. It contains a single open reading frame of 1685 residues (in strain IbAr10200), which is processed into mature glycoproteins GN and GC, and three other domains of as-yet unknown function: a variable mucin-like domain, a GP38 domain, and an NSm domain. The GN and GC glycoproteins of CCHFv bind target cells and influence infectivity [16] and cell tropism, and are the targets for neutralising antibodies [17]. Virus entry is thought to be primarily mediated by GC, which binds the proposed virus receptor human cell surface nucleolin [18].",

This complex series of maturation steps can cause difficulties when attempting to express recombinant GN or GC\nin vitro. The use of a viral vector delivery system bypasses these problems and is more likely to lead to authentic protein expression patterns. As GN, but not GC, contains a Golgi localisation signal, interaction between the two glycoproteins is required for GC to travel to the Golgi [17], [50].

The structural proteins rely on N-glycosylation of GN for their correct folding and transport [52], and GN in turn has a complex maturation process involving sequential cleavage from the accessory domains [14], [15], [38], [49]. The mucin-like and GP38 domains are required for correct transport of GN to the Golgi apparatus [17].

Although the consistent levels of viral load seen between day 32 and day 42 may have indicated ongoing, subclinical viral replication, it is likely that the RNA was released from defective viral particles, or from virus that had been inactivated by effective immunity e.g. neutralising antibodies. Initial attempts to amplify live virus from day 42 tissue samples were unsuccessful; therefore the possibility that this vaccine induced sterilising immunity has not been excluded. Interestingly, prolonged viraemia assessed by RT-PCR has also been observed in convalescent patients, but that study did not report any attempts to recover viable virus [67].",

Furthermore, the adaptive immune response elicited by the vaccine was not substantially affected by the absence of the type I IFN receptor in the A129 mice. Protection correlated with T-cell responses, but not antibody induction, although further studies are required to determine exactly which is the protective component. Further directions for this work could also include testing the longevity of demonstrated protective effects, and investigating whether MVA-GP confers protection against multiple CCHFv strains.",
