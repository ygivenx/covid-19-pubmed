This disease has become the most prevalent in pigs worldwide and is responsible for great economic losses [3]. It has been proposed that the immune response during PRRSV infection is characterized by an altered innate immune response and a weak and delayed adaptive immune response [4].",

It is also an emerging zoonotic agent [5\u20137]. S. suis usually infects pigs via the respiratory tract by colonizing the palatine and nasopharyngeal tonsils, potentially disseminating to the draining lymph nodes of the upper respiratory tract [8]. By mechanisms not well understood, virulent strains of S. suis will cross the first natural lines of the host defense and enter the bloodstream to initiate disease. Among the described potential virulence factors [9], the capsular polysaccharide (CPS) displays anti-phagocytic properties and interferes with internalization of S. suis by dendritic cells (DCs), monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils [10\u201313]. Interestingly, some studies originally suggested that S. suis may eventually be internalized by phagocytes and travel intracellularly in the bloodstream (Trojan Horse theory) [14]. The pathology caused by S. suis has been mainly associated with an excessive inflammatory response [15,16], through the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by cells of the immune system such as monocytes/macrophages [17,18] and DCs [11].",

More precisely, PRRSV and S. suis co-infection cases are frequently observed in the field, but relatively few scientific studies have yet documented this interaction. In S. suis-infected piglets, pre-infection with PRRSV has been shown to induce a higher mortality rate compared to those infected by either PRRSV or S. suis alone [24,27,28]. An enhanced bacteremia and bacterial tissue colonization of co-infected animals was also observed, with both PRRSV and S. suis found in the bloodstream [24,29]. Piglets born from PRRSV-infected gestating sows were also shown to be more susceptible to a subsequent S. suis infection [30]. Although it has been suggested that the higher susceptibility of co-infected animals might be due to an immunomodulation induced by the PRRSV infection, the exact mechanisms involved in such interactions are still unknown [28].",

Data were first processed by analyzing box plot of sample intensity to ensure that signal intensity data were comparable between samples. Data were then processed by applying a variance-stabilizing normalization (VSN) filter in order to normalize the datasets. The VSN method fits the VSN model to raw microarray data. In contrast with other methods of preprocessing two-color microarray data, VSN normalization is a one-step procedure. The data are returned on a generalized logarithm scale to base 2. A principal component of analysis plot was created to observe separation of different treatment groups. No outliers were removed from the data. Scatter plots of expression were then analyzed to ensure that probe data within a treatment group were not differentially expressed but also to verify that some probes were differentially expressed between different treatment groups, indicating possible differentially expressed genes. Afterwards, ANOVA was used to search for differentially expressed genes between infected and mock-infected groups. ANOVA results were then post-processed in flexarray by a FDR correction using a Benjamini Hochberg algorithm. Differentially expressed genes were defined by fold changes greater than 2-folds or smaller than 0.5 fold with an accompanying P-value \u2264 0.05.

Preliminary studies with different bacterial/virus ratios and incubation times were tested and those used in the present study represent the best combination that avoided toxicity. In fact, higher virus or bacterial concentration resulted in high toxicity for cells (data not shown). PRRSV replicated in both cell types, significantly increasing the amount of viral RNAs with time (Fig 1). Following PRRSV infection, viral replication in BMDCs is significantly higher than that in monocytes. BMDCs are more permissive to the virus (P < 0.05), since at t = 0 h (2 h after incubation with virus), PRRSV load was already greater in BMDCs (23.8 \u00b1 1.3 Ct) compared to monocytes (27.2 \u00b1 1.4 Ct). The virus also replicated more rapidly in BMDCs (P < 0.05). Indeed, after 16 h of infection, the viral load in BMDCs reached 14.5 \u00b1 0.6 Ct, compared with 22.7 \u00b1 0.6 Ct in monocytes. The RT-qPCR values corresponded to an increase from 102 at 0 h to almost 105 TCID50/ml in BMDCs after 16 of infection (data not shown). Between 16 h and 24 h of culture, PRRSV replication reached a plateau in BMDCs, whereas for monocytes, a delayed but continuous viral replication was observed after 16 h; viral load was nonetheless still lower than that of BMDCs. Bacterial replication was also highly significant, increasing from originally 105 up to more than 108 CFU/ml after 12 h of incubation time (data not shown).",

When porcine BMDCs were pre-infected with PRRSV, a significantly lower number of bacteria were internalized after all incubation times (Fig 2A). Monocytes were able to very weakly phagocyte S. suis, and no difference was seen in the number of internalized bacteria when cells were pre-infected with PRRSV for any of the time points (Fig 2B). Since the number of monocyte-internalized bacteria was too low, we decided to confirm this result by using a non-encapsulated mutant (S. suis \u0394cps2F) derived from the S. suis strain P1/7, which had been previously shown to be more phagocytosed than its corresponding wild-type strain [11]. As expected, a significantly greater number of non-encapsulated S. suis were internalized by porcine monocytes at all incubation times (P < 0.05); however, the number of ingested bacteria was not modified by a PRRSV-pre-infection (Fig 2C).",

To assess if PRRSV infection had an effect on the intracellular survival of S. suis, the phagocytosis assay was modified as explained in material and methods. The number of internalized bacteria in monocytes was too low to perform intracellular survival studies (data not shown). In order to compare the intracellular survival in mock-infected and PRRSV-infected cells, the data were normalized and a value of 100% was set for the number of surviving bacteria found after 1 h of internalization (Fig 2D). After 3 h, half of the bacteria were killed and no difference was observed between PRRSV-infected and mock-infected BMDCs (49.3 \u00b1 16.7% and 50.9 \u00b1 19% respectively; P > 0.05). Bacterial killing increased until 5 h of culture for both treatments, with around 20% of survival at this last time point. These results suggest that a prior infection with PRRSV would weakly but significantly impair the uptake of bacteria by porcine DCs, but that it does not have any effect on S. suis killing following phagocytosis.",

In fact, earlier incubation times presented low and inconstant results and longer incubation times revealed high cell toxicity (data not shown). Data from infected cells were compared to mock-infected cells. Using an expression threshold \u2265 2 fold with a P < 0.05, a total of 113 and 35 genes were up- and down-regulated in BMDCs following S. suis infection, respectively (Fig 3A). When cells were pre-infected with PRRSV, more than 270 genes were either up- or down-regulated. Among these genes, only a few (40 out of 208) were found to be up-regulated only in the presence of both pathogens, whereas more than half of the down-regulated genes (34 out of 65) were specific to the co-infection (Fig 3A). Differently from BMDCs, monocytes infected by S. suis alone showed more down-regulated (144) than up-regulated (68) genes (Fig 3B). This was also found in the presence of both pathogens, with 79 up-regulated genes and 164 down-regulated genes (Fig 3B). Most of these genes were also regulated in monocytes infected with S. suis alone (53 out of 79 for the up-regulated genes and 111 out of 164 for the down-regulated genes), although some up- and down-regulated genes that were specific to PRRSV and S. suis co-infection (23 and 52 genes, respectively) were also observed (Fig 3B). General response to virus infection was higher in BMDCs than in monocytes (135 and 16 genes modulated, respectively). These results reflect the relatively low response of monocytes, which was probably the consequence of a lower viral infection rate (Fig 1).

The triggering of these receptors recognizing PAMPs leads to the production of type I IFNs and pro-inflammatory cytokines.

In the present study, we evaluated the effect of a PRRSV infection on the response to a subsequent S. suis co-infection with two types of cells: BMDCs and monocytes. We mainly focused the analysis in our study on the inflammatory genes that may be affected during a co-infection. In the bloodstream, PRRSV comes in contact with both cell populations that display different susceptibility to PRRSV infection. While porcine DCs have been reported to be very susceptible to PRRSV infection [44], porcine monocytes may be more refractory to it [45].

            "text": "Once S. suis reaches deep tissues and bloodstream, it is subjected to the action of phagocytic cells of the immune system. However, in the absence of specific antibodies, it is relatively able to resist phagocytosis and persists in the blood with important inflammatory consequences [9]. S. suis also interacts with DCs and monocytic cells [10,11], and a previous infection with PRRSV may have an important influence on cell responses. It has been described that porcine DCs are able, to a certain extent, to internalize well-encapsulated S. suis, despite the anti-phagocytic role of the CPS [11]. Results obtained in this study confirmed such observations, where phagocytosis seems to be time-dependent. However, a pre-infection with PRRSV significantly reduced (around 50%) the internalization of encapsulated S. suis by BMDCs, though it did not affect the killing rate of intracellular bacteria. It is not clear if these differences observed in vitro may have a real influence on the level of antigen processing in vivo. Previous studies showed a decreased phagocytic activity of beads and dextran by PRRSV-infected porcine pulmonary alveolar macrophages and monocyte-derived DCs [45,46]. Interestingly, this is the first study showing the effect of PRRSV on the phagocytic properties of DCs using live bacterial pathogens. Very few studies reported the effect of PRRSV on the phagocytic properties of PAMs against live extracellular bacteria. More precisely, a pre-infection of pulmonary alveolar macrophages with PRRSV induced either a decreased activity or had no impact on their ability to ingest and kill Haemophilus parasuis, depending on the study [25,26]. To date, no study had been carried out with PRRSV/S. suis co-infected cells. On the other hand, S. suis was almost not phagocytosed by monocytes and a pre-infection with PRRSV did not change such observations. Although no differences could be observed between either virus-infected and control cells when a non-encapsulated mutant was used, it remains unclear if herein obtained results are simply related to the low PRRSV infectivity of monocytes. It should be noted that results from the present study are in vitro, whereas in vivo, other factors may also influence the phagocytosis of bacteria by professional phagocytic cells.",

Very few studies have analyzed the complete gene expression profiles of monocytes or alveolar macrophages activated by S. suis [49,50]. Yet, none has determined the activation profile of S. suis-infected DCs. In addition, the transcriptional immune response of porcine cells after a co-infection with PRRSV and S. suis had not been previously addressed. Gene ontology showed that the main groups of regulated genes were pro-inflammatory mediators and related receptors, as well as host defense genes. Regulated genes of these groups were the main focus of this study. PRRSV induced differential expression of a higher number of genes in BMDCs than in monocytes, as a possible consequence of a lower virus infectivity of the latter cell type. As previously mentioned, it has been reported that monocytes may not be optimally infected by some strains of PRRSV [45].",

Interestingly, S. suis also up-regulated IFN-\u03b2 and, to a lesser extent, IFN-\u03b1. Although the up-regulation of type I IFN genes has previously been reported in vitro with swine epithelial cells [54] and in vivo in a mouse model of infection [16], this is the first report of a clear up-regulation of such genes by porcine DCs infected with S. suis. Type I IFNs are now known to play important roles in infections caused by extracellular bacteria, including streptococci [55]. Although the co-infection did not potentiate the expression of type I IFNs compared to cells infected with PRRSV alone, the elevated production of these cytokines by PRRSV could have an incidence on the bacterial infection. IFN-\u03b2 has been shown to potentiate the septic shock syndrome or to induce the inhibition of the myeloid cell response to IFN-\u03b3, an important cytokine for bacterial clearance [56,57].

            "text": "One of the hallmarks of the disease caused by S. suis is an excessive inflammatory host reaction during both systemic (septic shock) and central nervous system (meningitis) infections. Previous studies showed that highly virulent S. suis serotype 2 strains induced high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which resulted in a cytokine storm that induced higher susceptibility to the infection [16,58]. In vitro results obtained in the present study confirmed that BMDCs infected by S. suis induce the up-regulation of potent inflammatory mediators. When cells were pre-infected with PRRSV, a clear additional or synergistic effect on the expression of chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines could be observed when compared to cells infected by a single pathogen. We recently reported that in vitro co-infection of swine epithelial cells with S. suis and swine influenza virus showed an important synergy between the two pathogens regarding the up-regulation of genes coding for inflammatory mediators [54]. A recent study carried out in vivo confirmed such observations, also showing a clear increase in clinical signs observed in co-infected animals [59]. More specifically, PRRSV/S. suis co-infection potentiates the up-regulation of IL-6, CCL5 and TNF-\u03b1. Interestingly, it has already been reported that S. suis is able to induce the production of CCL5 in vivo and in vitro [15,60], and this expression was also synergistically increased when cells were pre-infected with swine influenza virus [54]. Both TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 are known to be key cytokines in the inflammatory response and their over-expression in PRRSV and S. suis co-infected cells could suggest an increased pro-inflammatory response detrimental for co-infected animals. Moreover, the increased expression of the chemokine CCL5 could participate in a positive feedback loop of the inflammatory response by enhancing the recruitment of macrophages, immature DCs or basophils.",

            "text": "Prostanoids (prostaglandins and thromboxane A2) appear to be important regulators of both the onset and resolution of the inflammatory response. These molecules derive from arachidonic acid, an unsaturated fatty acid that is released from the plasma membrane by phospholipases in response to several activation stimuli, including pro-inflammatory mediators [61]. It is subsequently metabolized by cyclooxygenases (COXs) and lipoxygenases to generate, among other products, prostaglandins (PG). The inducible enzyme COX-2 (PTGS2 gene), which catalyzes the first step in the biosynthesis of PGs from arachidonic acid, is known to contribute to the acute phase of inflammation, especially by catalysing PGE2 production. Recent results showed that S. suis infection results in a shift toward an induction of pro-inflammatory lipid mediators and that treatment with fenretinide is able to reduce the levels of arachidonic acid and hence, reduce the excessive pro-inflammatory response in vivo [16]. In addition, S. suis is able to induce the secretion of PGE2 by human macrophages [62]. In the present study, both PRRSV and S. suis up-regulated the expression of COX-2 and the effect was clearly additive when the two pathogens acted together. A synergism concerning this mediator was recently observed in S. suis/swine influenza virus co-infected epithelial cells [54]. It may be hypothesized that lipid mediators play an important role in inflammation during S. suis infection and this role would be amplified during co-infections with important porcine pathogenic viruses.",

DCs, more susceptible to virus infection, are important players in such response. The results of the present study are the first step in understanding the immunological mechanisms explaining the higher susceptibility of PRRSV-infected animals to S. suis. In vivo studies, presently underway, will help to better understand the mechanisms involved during co-infections with these two important swine pathogens.",
