We report that ARI is characterized by dynamic, time-specific transcriptional profiles whose magnitudes of expression are influenced by underlying respiratory disease and the mucosal repair signature evoked during ARI. Most strikingly, people with asthma who experience ARI-induced exacerbations are characterized by a reduced but prolonged inflammatory immune response, inadequate activation of mucosal repair, and the expression of a newly described exacerbation-specific transcriptional signature.",

We also measured at each visit exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) and forced expiratory flow in 1 second (FEV1) by performing spirometry. At the BL visit, participants underwent a methacholine test to assess airway hyper-reactivity and an allergy skin test to determine if they were atopic [23]. Participants were instructed to complete diaries to record severity of common cold and chest (asthma) symptoms and peak expiratory flow rate (PEF, using a MiniWright meter, KW-Med Inc., USA) twice a day as previously described [24]. Virus identification in nasal lavage from visit one was performed using PCR-based techniques as previously outlined [25].

Interestingly, the transcriptional profiles identified in our study were highly similar to those found in lower airway mucosa in response to mechanical injury [37], indicating the same innate repair mechanism likely exists throughout the entire airways.

Although the absence of corresponding cellular composition data of the nasal mucosa (for example, via flow cytometry) and the focus exclusively on the upper airways may have been limitations of our study, these findings represent a significant contribution towards clarifying the complex molecular interactions that characterize ARI-induced asthma exacerbations.",
