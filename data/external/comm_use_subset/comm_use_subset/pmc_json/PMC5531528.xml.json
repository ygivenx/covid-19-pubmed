Early observations made it clear that some nascent chains of \u03b2-galactosidase still bound to the ribosome are enzymatically active [1]. More direct evidence that a polypeptide still attached to the ribosome, can adopt its native fold came from the use of conformational antibodies raised against \u03b2-galactosidase and tailspike protein of phage P22. [2,3] Initial efforts to characterize the folding propensity of nascent polypeptide chains were performed with synthetic fragments of chymotrypsin inhibitor-2 from barley seeds, an alpha/beta protein with 64 amino acids that readily refolds by a two-state mechanism [4,5]. As measured by circular dichroism and ANS binding, the acquisition of secondary and tertiary structure starts simultaneously after completion of 80% of the polypeptide chain. Native-like tertiary structure, measured by intrinsic fluorescence of tryptophan, starts after the polypeptide chain is 95% complete. It is worth noting that even though the experimental conditions used in these studies were native-like, the purification process involved denaturing conditions, mainly because of the poor solubility of the polypeptides. Of special interest is the fact that the longest construct, with 63 residues, was recovered from bacterial inclusion bodies.",

The presence of chaperones is significant but not mandatory in the cellular milieu, and in fact is not sufficient to increase the in vitro folding recovery to the efficiency level of a polypeptide emerging from the ribosome. A well-studied example is the \u03b2-barrel of the green fluorescence protein (GFP), which becomes active after folding from a nascent polypeptide at a much higher efficiency than during in vitro refolding of its full-length polypeptide chain and independently of the cytosolic crowding or cellular chaperones [6].",

This viral protein is expressed as a soluble protein in Escherichia coli only at lower temperatures, such as 18\u00b0C, indicating a strong dependence on cotranslational folding events in order to achieve its native fold. We show that designed nascent polypeptide chains of the nsp1 adopt intermediates with hydrophobic clusters and significant 3D compaction. These intermediates appear with 2 of the 6 \u03b2-strands and the \u03b1-helix, represented by the designed protein nsp1(13\u201366). Additionally, after the presence of 4 \u03b2-strands and the \u03b1-helix, in the designed protein nsp1(13\u2013100), there is the observation of significant formation of secondary structure. These events could be detected since we designed a recombinant fusion protein that allowed the use of complementary biophysical techniques to identify folding intermediates earlier in the translation of a polypeptide than detected previously.",

However, these systems present three intrinsic experimental drawbacks: 1- the ribosomal-bound nascent chain is a complex of more than 2 MDa, precluding studies by many biophysical approaches, including NMR spectroscopic methods, to achieve high-resolution structural data; 2- the free C-terminally truncated chains are very unstable, and are frequently expressed in inclusion bodies.

For instance, the intermediate nsp1(13\u201384) includes \u03b2-strand 3, which is not paired with \u03b2-strand 2 in the native fold, nsp1(13\u2013111) includes \u03b2-strand 5, which is not paired with \u03b2-strand 4, and finally the full-length nsp1 globular domain includes \u03b2-strand 6, which is not paired with \u03b2-strand 5. The constructs ranged in size from 11 to 22 kDa and included, from the N- to the C-terminus (Fig 1B): An nsp1 construct; a spacer, designed to occupy the ribosome exit tunnel before the synthesis of the GB1 domain; a GB1 solubility domain; and a His-tag for purification. These constructs behaved similarly during their purification and provided us with stable samples for at least two weeks, with concentrations as high as 4 mM.",

An further increase in a negative band at 208 nm was noted especially for fusion constructs nsp1(13\u201325), nsp1(13\u201350), nsp1(13\u201366) and nsp1(13\u2013100), which is correlated with the presence of random coil conformation [30]. The full-length nsp1 fusion construct displayed a CD spectrum very similar to the nsp1(13\u2013111) truncated fusion construct, which includes a positive band in the range of 200\u2013205 nm, typical of \u03b2-strand conformation in the presence of coil. This characteristic appeared even earlier, in the fusion construct nsp1(13\u201384), but was somehow obliterated in fusion construct nsp1(13\u2013100). Even though the signal of secondary structure is significantly bigger in the intermediate fusion construct nsp1(13\u2013100) than in the shorter fusion constructs, it does not resemble the CD spectrum of full-length nsp1.

The spectrum showing exclusively the signals of the nsp1 segment in each designed fusion construct was then back-calculated and analyzed for 1H dispersion and number of peaks (Fig 4). The intermediate constructs have much lower dispersion than the well-folded, full-length domain, showing that the intermediates of nsp1 do not have a well-defined fold (Fig 4A). It is clear that the spectra of nsp1(13\u201325), nsp1(13\u201350) and nsp1(13\u201366) proteins do not overlap, indicating that these three fusion constructs have different conformations. Considering the longer fusion constructs, from nsp1(13\u201366) up to nsp1(13\u2013111), there is considerable equivalence among the spectra; however, this can be merely a superposition of peaks from different amino acids and because of that cannot be considered fold similarity. Nevertheless, if we compare the median and the dispersion of signals of each fusion construct (Fig 4B), we see that the medians of the spectra from fusion construct nsp1(13\u201366) towards the full-length construct are very similar, around 8 ppm. On the other hand, the median signals of the two shortest fusion constructs, nsp1(13\u201325) and nsp1(13\u201350), are very similar to the urea-denatured samples nsp1(13\u201384), nsp1(13\u2013111) and the full-length nsp1, all around 8.3\u20138.4 ppm. This indicates that the nsp1 polypeptides from nsp1(13\u201366) onward adopt different conformations than that of an unfolded structure. It is also noticeable that the dispersion of the fusion construct nsp1(13\u2013111) is greater than the other intermediates, or urea-denatured samples, indicating that the nsp1 polypeptide segment of this sample adopted a more compact 3D fold.",

The greater the number of missing peaks in 2D spectra, the more likely it is that the protein adopts an intermediate fold with intermediate conformational dynamics. It is worth noting that there are several examples in the literature showing that for mostly unfolded and highly dynamic proteins their 2D [1H,15N] correlation spectrum will present low dispersion but only a few missing peaks, because of superposition or intermediate dynamics of their 3D structures. This is in fact the case for the fusion construct nsp1(13\u201325), missing only 3% of its peaks. The number of missing peaks increases substantially to 44% with the length of the polypeptide chain from the fusion construct nsp1(13\u201350) to nsp1(13\u201384), and then decreases until it reaches approximately 11% in the full-length nsp1 domain. This increased percentage of missing peaks is an indication for the existence of folding states with intermediate conformational dynamics. The full-length nsp1 fusion protein has only a few missing peaks, indicating a well-folded 3D domain, which causes a wide dispersion of chemical shifts and allows straightforward identification of backbone HN signals.",

The fusion constructs present an average hydrophobicity of 0.51 \u00b1 0.03 (accumulated hydrophobicity divided by the number of residues in each construct \u00b1 SD), ruling out the possibility of the existence of abnormally hydrophobic polypeptide chains that would have more affinity for bis-ANS.

In these calculations we used the equations Calc-RhFOLDED = (0.475 \u00d7 Number of residues0.29) and Calc-RhUNFOLDED = (0.221 \u00d7 Number of residues0.57) for folded or unfolded proteins, respectively (blue and red lines in Fig 6B). The Rg and Dmax of GB1, as well as the designed fusion proteins nsp1(13\u201325), nsp1(13\u201350) and full-length nsp1, follows the expected dependence of dimensional parameter upon the chain length. A pronounced upper-deviation from the theoretical function is evident for the fusion construct nsp1(13\u201384), most likely identifying the expansion of the mean occupied conformational space. The fusion constructs nsp1(13\u2013100), nsp1(13\u2013111) show a reduction in Rg and Dmax compared to the theoretical and to the other fusion constructs, indicating protein condensation upon crossing a given threshold between chain length as of the completion of the segment nsp1(13\u201384)-nsp1(13\u2013100). We assume that this behavior may be attributed to additional structural stability for the previous strands (\u03b21-\u03b23).",

We envisage testing this by comparing a construct lacking this helix with a synthetic polypeptide encoding the native \u03b1-helix.",

This is common sense with regard to the cotranslational fold, including for proteins that have been studied by the use of truncated polypeptides, such as barnase (RNase from Bacillus amyloliquefacies), chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2), staphylococcal nuclease and sperm-whale apomyoglobin [48\u201351]. In polypeptide chains nearing completion (>95% of the final length), these authors identified compact structures with long-range interactions, perhaps non-native, but lacking stable secondary structures. It is worth mentioning that the purification of these truncated proteins involved chemical denaturation; we infer that the results were obtained with refolded samples, which is an additional variable in the experimental setup, not present in the natural cellular environment. Our experimental results indicate a different scenario, where intermediate polypeptide lengths of nsp1, represented by designed proteins nsp1(13\u2013100) and nsp1(13\u2013111), start to adopt stable secondary structure and then tertiary structure before the completion of the polypeptide chain, observed for the designed protein nsp1(13\u2013111) (Fig 8).",

The shortest intermediates nsp1(13\u201325) and nsp1(13\u201350) are mostly intrinsically disordered, but with residual native \u03b1-helix in nsp1(13\u201350). Subsequently, there is the formation of hydrophobic clusters in nsp1(13\u201366) with concomitant formation of residual non-native \u03b1-helices, which reaches a maximum in nsp1(13\u2013100). The fusion constructs nsp1(13\u2013100) and nsp1(13\u2013111) presents a visible condensation of 3D structure, as detected by SAXS, but only the latter has some stable tertiary structure. A hydrophobic collapse to the native 3D fold might happen only after completion of \u03b2-strand 6. The fusion constructs starting from nsp1(13\u201366), which presents \u03b2-strands 1 and 2 and helix \u03b1, until nsp1(13\u2013111), resemble molten globules [52]. It is noticeable that the native amphipathic helix \u03b1 start to be formed within the fusion construct nsp1(13\u201350) and may provide a template to initiate the tertiary structure of nsp1. A second segment with helical propensity in fusion construct nsp1(13\u2013100) does not show amphipathicity (last panel in Fig 9B), which reinforces the argument that this segment is unstable in this conformation, leaving it with more propensity to form strand \u03b24 and the loops flanking it. Based on our experimental evidence and theoretical analysis, we suggest that nsp1(13\u2013100) represents a crucial step in the cotranslational folding of the \u03b2-barrel of nsp1.",
