            "text": "The oriental armyworm, Mythimna separata (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), is an important agricultural pest in Asia and Australia [1]. In China, it is widely distributed except in the far northwest (Xinjiang). The larvae of the armyworm can inflict devastating damage to more than 104 species of plants in 16 families including food crops (wheat, rice, foxtail millet, and maize) [2]. Each year, the nocturnal moths engage in a seasonal long-distance migration between southern and northern China [3]. M. separata has been extensively studied as a model migratory species in China [3\u20135]. The research contents mainly involved environmental, physiological, hormonal, genetic, and molecular factors [3]. The fifth and sixth instars of the larvae (the gluttony period) are the very important stages in which larvae consume vast food to accumulate sufficient nutrition and energy to meet remaining development and migration requirements. Environmental factors such as temperature [6, 7], photoperiod [8], and larval density [9\u201311] can trigger or inhibit the onset of migration. Moths response to larval environmental conditions [12] and are most likely to take off on a migratory flight the first or second night after adult eclosion [13]. Therefore, molecular studies towards environmental factors and specific developmental stages are the focus of migration research in M. separata. Exploring target gene expression profiles in tissues from various environmental conditions or developmental periods will promote a greater understanding of the migration regulation mechanism. Reports on molecular regulation mechanisms of migration for M. separata were relatively scarce.",

An ideal reference gene should be expressed at a constant level in samples from various cells, tissues, developmental stages, or treatment conditions and does not coregulate with the target gene [21]. To date, the reference genes of several insects have been identified and validated for RT-qPCR normalization among different biotic or abiotic conditions, e.g., Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae) [22], Bombyx mori (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae) [23], Schistocerca gregaria (Orthoptera: Acrididae) [24], Bactrocera dorsalis (Diptera: Tephritidae) [25], Tribolium castaneum (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) [26], Spodoptera litura (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) [27], Spodoptera exigua (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) [28], Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) [29], Anastrepha obliqua (Diptera: Tephritidae) [30], and Chilo suppressalis (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) [31]. These findings demonstrate that there is no single gene that meets all requirements of each experimental condition. Therefore, validation of specific reference gene needs to be conducted for each species and experimental background before using them. Up to now, the researches on identification and evaluation of suitable reference genes for RT-qPCR gene expression normalization in M. separata are scare.",

The least stable genes determined by four programs were 18S, 28S, and \u03b2-ACT. According to RefFinder, the stability ranking of the reference genes from the most stable to the least stable across different developmental stages is as follows: EF > CypA > \u03b2-TUB > GAPDH > RPL12 > ATPase > TBP > \u03b2-ACT > 18S > 28S (Figure 2(a)). The geNorm analysis showed that all pairwise variation values were above the proposed 0.15 cut-off value (Figure 3(a)). The lowest pairwise variation was shown at V6/7 (the variation between the normalization factors of six genes in relation to seven genes); thus, six genes are recommended as reference genes for normalization. It is relatively impractical to use excessive numbers of endogenous control genes for normalization. The use of the three most stable control genes was considered to be adequate for normalization of RT-qPCR [34, 38]. To verify this recommendation, the correlation of NF values between the three most stable genes and the optimal number of genes was calculated. As shown in Figure 3(b)-(A), there is a good correlation between two NF measures (proposed number, three; the theoretical optimal number, six) for developmental stages (r = 0.972). This result supports that the three most stable internal control genes are sufficient for an accurate normalization of developmental stages data. Thus, the normalization with the combination EF, CypA, and RPL12 should be suggested by geNorm for a suitable normalization in the different developmental stages. And geNorm is basically in line with RefFinder identifying three out of ten most stable genes (Figure 2(a)).",

However, to date, there are no universal reference genes that are stably expressed in all types of samples under various treatment conditions. Therefore, the evaluation of reference genes must be conducted prior to gene expression profiling experiments. In this study, we firstly examined the validation of ten reference genes commonly applied in all kinds of organisms in M. separata with four algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and the \u0394CT method) under various biotic and abiotic conditions. The ranking orders of investigated reference genes across the four programs were varied based on various conditions (Tables 2(a), 2(b), 3, and 4). RefFinder, a web-based algorithm, integrates all data obtained from the four programs mentioned above and determines the stability of selected reference genes by calculation of Geometric Mean values, and those with the lower GM values are identified as more stable genes. RefFinder proposed that EF, \u03b2-TUB, CypA, and RPL12 are the most stable reference genes for M. separata under all samples (Figure 2(i)).",

Under temperature treatments, the ranking of EF in M. separata is inconsistent with that in P. xylostella [44] and H. armigera [29], in which EF was one of the least stable genes. EF was relatively stable across different treatments in M. separata; however, its expression level was low, with a mean CT of 24.49 (Figure 1). Therefore, the expression level of target gene will decide whether EF may be used as a control gene.",

This result was similar to the stabilities of CypA in Hippodamia convergens [46]. However, it was the least under the developmental stages and tissues in Danaus plexippus (L.) [47]. More remarkably, the expression of CypA was unstable among four densities (Figure 2(d)). Previous study has examined that M. separata larvae reared at high density show higher resistant to nucleopolyhedrovirus (NPV) than those reared at low density [48]. CypA was also reported to regulate several severe viruses in human [49].
