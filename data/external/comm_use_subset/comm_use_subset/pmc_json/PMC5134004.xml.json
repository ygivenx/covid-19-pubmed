After the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China in 1949, the Chinese government made various innovations for better delivery of public health services. For example, at the beginning of 1960s, China launched a village doctor training program to create a front-line workforce, providing public health services and essential medical services including clinical treatment and drugs [1, 2]. In addition, disease prevention and primary care were the two most important tools at that time and people were able to receive some basic vaccines to prevent infectious diseases. All of these interventions lead to great health outcomes in China [3].",

Some infectious diseases such as Tuberculosis (TB), re-emerged as a result of poverty and health inequities [5\u20137]. Fortunately, the Chinese government eventually realized that issues in the health care system must be addressed (particularly public health) and made various corrections.",

In the 2009 health care reform policy, an essential public health package, including nine types of basic services and six types of catastrophic services, was launched. The PCIs including community health care centers, township hospitals and village clinics provided basic services and the specialized public health institutions like centers for disease control (CDCs) provided catastrophic services. The government regulated the guideline for basic services and provided training for public health workers. The financial supports were shared by the central and the local governments. Until 2015, the package included 12 types of basic services and seven types of catastrophic services. The budget per capita for basic services increased from 15 Renminbi (RMB) in 2009 to 40 RMB in 2015. Almost every Chinese citizen has equal access to this essential public health package. By summarizing China\u2019s experiences and lessons learned during development of both public health service systems and financing strategies, especially with regard to improving universal access, the present study will provide significant policy implications for public health development and health systems strengthening in other developing countries.",

The equity analysis methods include Lorenz curves and Gini coefficients, Thiel index, the index of dissimilarity(ID), the slope indices of inequality(SII), relative index of inequality(RII) and concentration index(CI) [8]. Since the policy has been implemented for only 6 years, the process indicators instead of health outcomes will be mainly considered for effects measurement.

As we know, the hypertension is the leading risk factor of haemorrhagic stroke (RR = 2.74) [52]. Total Cholesterol (RR = 2.7) and Triglycerides(Male: RR = 2.5, female: RR = 3.8) are more contributed to ischemic stroke compared with blood pressure (RR = 1.92) [55, 56]. Considering the control of dyslipidaemia is not included in the NEPHSP, it\u2019s easy to understand that the mortality of haemorrhagic stroke decreased slightly and the mortality of ischemic stroke still increased. The gaps for mortality of hypertension and diabetes related diseases between urban and rural areas still existed in 2000\u20132013.\n",
