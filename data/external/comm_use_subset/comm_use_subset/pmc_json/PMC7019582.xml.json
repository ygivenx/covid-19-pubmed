Secondly, age, the influenza type and subtype [5], or the season [18] might be partially responsible for differences in the performance of the variables studied. However, we adjusted for age and season, and it seems improbable that our results are invalid. Thirdly, during epidemic weeks, when physicians are aware of the onset of epidemic activity, the criteria for the sampling of suspected ILI patients might be less rigorous [28], but we have analyzed the performance of case definitions and clinical manifestations during both epidemic weeks and in all weeks, and no relevant differences were observed.
