Cytokines and other soluble mediators in the lymph node and inflamed tissue can further affect the cytokine expression profile of effector CD4 T cells [3], in some cases by changing the differentiation status of the effector CD4 T cells. Primed precursor CD4 T (Thpp) cells, that produce mainly IL-2 and chemokines when stimulated, remain uncommitted with respect to their effector cytokine pattern and can later differentiate into either Th1 or Th2 cells [4]\u2013[6]. Suppressive Treg cells, expressing the forkhead transcription factor Foxp3, can lose the expression of Foxp3 and acquire the ability to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines during autoimmunity [7]. Th17 cells can acquire the ability to produce IFN\u03b3 in Th1 polarizing conditions [8], [9]. Adoptively transferred IL-4-producing Th2 effector cells can produce IFN\u03b3 during viral challenge infections [10]. Th9 cells develop from Th2 populations in the presence of TGF\u03b2 [11], [12] and T follicular helper (Tfh) cells may represent a further differentiation step from several of the other subsets [13].",

Like other EGF members, AR is expressed as a transmembrane precursor protein and released by proteolytic cleavage [21], [22]. Soluble AR binds to EGF receptors and promotes proliferation and differentiation of epithelial cells, fibroblasts and keratinocytes [23]\u2013[25]. AR-deficient mice [26] showed slower kinetics of clearance [27] of the helminth parasite, Trichuris muris, that is cleared most effectively by Th2-biased responses. AR production is also induced in human mast cells by IgE cross-linking [28], [29], in human eosinophils by IL-5 [30], and in human basophils by IL-3 [31]. Thus AR is induced by activation of at least four cell types contributing to Type 2 inflammation, suggesting a role for AR during an allergic immune response. In addition, production of AR by immune cells is potentially important for tissue remodeling and repair [21], [26] during and after damaging immune responses.",

Naive cells (CD45RA+) expressed high levels of IL-2 and AR, but very low levels of either IFN\u03b3 or IL-4 (data not shown). Memory cells produced all cytokines tested, at varying frequencies. To determine whether AR expression was associated positively or negatively with subset-specific cytokines, the frequencies of cells expressing AR plus each of the other cytokines were measured from the ICS results. These values were then compared with the double-producing frequencies predicted for random association of each cytokine pair, by multiplying the individual frequencies for each cytokine. Figure 5B shows that AR was expressed in association with TNF\u03b1, IL-2, IFN\u03b3, IL-4 and IL-17 at slightly higher frequencies than predicted by random association. Similarly, TNF\u03b1 and IL-2 showed positive associations with all other cytokines. In contrast, the subset-specific cytokines IFN\u03b3, IL-4 and IL-17 showed mostly negative associations between each other, as expected. These results were confirmed at the RNA level by sorting SEB-stimulated human PBMC according to surface AR expression. Both AR+ and AR- memory CD4 T cell populations expressed similar levels of IL-4 and IFN\u03b3 as measured by RT-PCR (Figure 5C). IL-2 mRNA levels were higher in AR+ T cells, in both CD45RA- and CD45RA+ cells.",

We therefore examined AR expression within subsets of memory CD4 T cells defined by the expression of these proteins. AR was produced at approximately similar frequencies by CD4 T cells positive or negative for the chemokine receptors CCR4, CCR7, CXCR3 and CXCR5, as well as CD62L and CD27 (Figure 6).

Our results suggest that AR is not a specific product of certain pre-committed effector subsets of human CD4 T cells, but instead is regulated mainly by additional signals present during T cell activation, particularly signals influencing the cAMP signaling pathway. The lack of precommitment suggests that, in contrast to the memory of effector functions carried by T cells committed to Th1, Th2, Th17 etc phenotypes, the amount of AR produced in a particular immune response is regulated by the local environment during that response, but is less influenced by previous immune priming.

Both mediators are produced at sites of immune inflammation, adenosine by degradation of ATP from dying cells, and PGE2 by activated macrophages. PKA activation signals also synergized with TCR signals to induce HB-EGF mRNA and protein expression in human CD4 T cells (data not shown). Thus during the progression of an inflammatory response, there may be a switch from pro-inflammatory cytokine production to AR (and HB\u2013EGF) production.",

During an immune response, initial immune attack mechanisms that destroy the pathogen are superseded at later times by suppression that reduces immunopathology, and tissue repair that restores normal structure and function. T lymphocytes are major cellular contributors to all three phases, and are thought to play a role in repair by producing HB\u2013EGF and bFGF [33]. AR and HB\u2013EGF, as members of the EGF family, promote the proliferation of fibroblasts, epithelial cells, and smooth muscle cells, which are major cell types repaired or remodeled at local tissue sites during an inflammatory response. Tissues with chronic inflammation show extensive cell proliferation, tissue thickening and reduced elasticity. Regulation of the balance between attack and repair cytokines produced by T cells is thus crucial to the successful outcome of the response.",

This contrasts with the requirement for specific effector mechanisms to combat different pathogens, in which pre-commitment to cytokine effector phenotypes (thus linking antigen and effector specificities) may be more effective for regulating clearance functions. Collectively, the coordinate inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines and induction of tissue-remodeling cytokines of the EGF family may represent a switch from pathogen clearance to tissue repair mechanisms by effector human T cells.",
