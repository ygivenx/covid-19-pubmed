In a recent work, we showed that our compounds were also active against HSV-1/2, while they were completely ineffective against HPV, a nonenveloped virus [11]. These results suggested that the mode of action of our molecules could involve the viral envelope. Compounds acting on viral envelopes have been previously described: RAFI compounds inhibit a broad range of enveloped viruses by inserting into viral envelopes and altering the fusion kinetics in the hemifusion stalk due to their inverted cone structure [12]. Liposomes extracting cholesterol from viral envelopes have been reported to inhibit HIV, HCV and HBV [13]. Virolytic antiviral peptides derived from mastoparan were shown to inhibit different enveloped viruses acting on the envelope and causing its detachment from the viral core [14]. The selectivity of these strategies is based on the fact that viral envelopes are static and characterized by an absence of repair mechanisms, in contrast with the biogenic membranes of the cells that are endowed with plenty of tools to repair membrane damage or alteration [15]. Furthermore, since envelope lipids are derived from host cells, it is more complicated to the virus to develop resistance to these compounds if compared to those targeting the classical viral components; for this reason they are extremely promising targets also for viruses with a high mutation rate.",

In these conditions it was possible to observe that the viral infectivity in presence of the compound was decreased at 15\u2019 post treatment and completely abrogated from 30\u2019 on when the virus was exposed to 10 \u03bcM of compound, and at lower doses (Fig 6A). While after 1h of exposure, the EC50 was 37.3 nM (Fig 6B). The irreversibility of the mechanism was also tested with an assay in which the compound was incubated with the virus for 1h and subsequently the mixture has been diluted in drug free medium for additional 1, 2, 3 or 4 hours before the addition on cells (S2 Fig). Also in this condition the infectivity was not regained further verifying the permanent virucidal activity.",

We performed entry and binding assays, evaluating the amount of bound virus through immunostaining or qPCR. The results shown in Fig 7A, 7B and 7C, demonstrate that the compound is not altering viral binding capability, differently from heparin, a known attachment inhibitor [16]. On the contrary, when entry assays were performed, it was possible to observe a reduction in the amount of virus associated to the cells (Fig 7D). With this assay, the signal from the virus could be related to virus in the cytoplasm or blocked in the endosomes, since the treatment with acidic glycine is affecting only the virus at the surface of the cell. For this reason we performed also an in immunofluorescence (IF) in which it was possible to visualize that there is virus signal in discrete dots, possibly endosomes, while in the control the viral signal is diffused in the cytoplasm (Fig 7E), supporting the hypothesis that part of the virus could be blocked in endosomes due to an impaired fusion.",

            "text": "Due to the chemical structure of compound 9d and its affinity for lipids, we envisioned that its mechanism of action might involve the peroxidation of viral phospholipids, which would lead to altered fusion properties of enveloped viruses. To assess this hypothesis, we carried out an in vitro lipoperoxidation assay based on the oxidation of linoleic acid as model lipid substrate, incorporated in a DPPC liposomes. The lipid peroxidation was evaluated by monitoring the production of the lipid degradation end-product malondialdehyde (MDA). After the exposure to compound 9d, the linoleic acid underwent a remarkable lipid peroxidation in the liposome system (Fig 8). The results of the TBA assay suggest the peroxidant activity of the compound. The peroxidation capability of 9d was further confirmed by the reduction of linoleic acid peroxidation extent in a control sample in which in the preparation of liposomes, an antioxidant such as (\u00b1)-\u03b1-tocopherol, was added. Interestingly the addition of 0.05% w/w (\u00b1)-\u03b1-tocopherol in the system reduced the peroxidation of linoleic acid of 50.5%. Blank samples produced negligible lipid peroxidation.",

The selective activity on enveloped viruses and the lipid peroxidation capability of the compound suggest a mechanism of action on the viral envelope that is affecting viral and cell membrane fusion. These results open interesting possible applications for these molecules as antivirals or as components of microbicidal preparations for topical use. This is of particular interest if we consider that all the recent epidemics of emerging and re-emerging viruses are caused by enveloped viruses such as Ebola virus, Lassa virus, Zika virus, SARS and MERS Coronavirus and avian flu [3], without considering the threatening infections of Hendra and Nipah viruses and the emergence of novel mutant strains. Finally, the activity of the reported compounds against HIV [6], HSV-1, HSV-2 and ZIKV, which can be all transmitted through sexual activity, suggest a possible use of this class of compounds as vaginal microbicide components.",

Microwave irradiation experiments were conducted using a CEM Discover Synthesis Unit (CEM Corp., Matthews, NC, USA). The instrument consists of a continuous focused microwave power delivery system with operator-selectable power output from 0 to 300 W. The temperature of the contents of the vessel was monitored with a calibrated IR temperature control mounted under the reaction vessel. All experiments were performed using a stirring option, whereby the contents of the vessel were stirred by a rotating magnetic plate located below the floor of the microwave cavity and a teflon-coated magnetic stir bar in the vessel.",

Absorbances were measured using a Microplate Reader (Model 680, BIORAD) at 490 nm. The effect on cell viability at different concentrations of the compound was expressed as a percentage, by comparing absorbances of treated cells with those of cells incubated with culture medium and equal volumes of vehicle. The 50% cytotoxic concentrations (CC50) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined using Prism software (Graph-Pad Software, San Diego, CA).

In lipid peroxidation, free radicals attack double bonds of polyunsaturated fatty acids forming lipid hydroperoxides, which undergo homolytic scission to form a variety of cytotoxic compounds, such as aldehydes. This oxidative stress plays an important role in damaging membrane lipids. According to previous literature, the potential oxidative effect of 9d was evaluated toward the oxidation of linoleic acid, a carboxylic acid with two double bonds as a model lipid substrate. The lipoperoxidation of linoleic acid, incorporated in dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) liposomes was determined using the TBA assay [20, 21]. DPPC liposomes were prepared with the thin film evaporation method and used to mimic a phospholipid bilayer, and to dissolve linoleic acid. TBA assay, commonly used as an index of lipid peroxidation, is based on the reactivity of malondialdehyde (MDA), a colourless end-product of degradation, with 2-thiobarbituric acid (TBA) to produce a pink adduct (TBA-MDA-TBA) that absorbs at 535 nm. MDA is indeed one of the final products of polyunsaturated fatty acids peroxidation in the cells and is generally considered an indicator of lipid peroxidation. MDA was detected spectrophotometrically according to the method described by Bay et al. with the following modifications [22].",

The mixture was stirred and heated in water bath at 95\u2013100\u00b0C for 45 min to favor the formation of the complex. After cooling in an ice bath, 4.0 mL of 1-butanol were added to each tube and the TBA-MDA-TBA complex was extracted upon stirring and centrifugation. The organic supernatant was evaluated by spectrophotometry. The calibration curve of TBA-MDA-TBA complex was obtained using a MDA precursor 1,1,3,3-tetraethoxypropane. MDA can be obtained by acid hydrolysis from 1,1,3,3-tetraethoxypropane in an equimolecular reaction. For this purpose, standard solutions of 1,1,3,3-tetraethoxypropane in SDS (4% w/w) within the concentration range 5\u2013250 \u03bcM were prepared. The solutions were subjected to TBA assay and analyzed at spectrophotometer. The final concentration of MDA derived from the reaction of linoleic acid, calculated exploiting the calibration curve, was expressed as micromoles of MDA per mg of lipid substrate. To further confirm the oxidant activity of 9d the peroxidation experiment was also carried out using a control sample containing 0.05% w/w of (\u00b1)-\u03b1-tocopherol, molecule with antioxidant properties, added during the preparation of liposomes.
