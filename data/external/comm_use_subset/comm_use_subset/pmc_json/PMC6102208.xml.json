The reported fatality of SFTSV infection, ranging from 10 to 30%, is significantly higher than that of the hemorrhagic fever caused by Hantavirus in the same area3,4. Although the virus is mainly transmitted by tick bites, human-human transmission has been reported5,6. No effective therapies or vaccines are available yet, and the mechanisms of disease pathogenesis are poorly understood. Although previous studies revealed that the impairment of innate immune response as well as inflammatory cytokine storm played important roles in the disease progress7,8, our knowledge of virus-specific humoral response to SFTSV infection and its roles in the pathogenesis is extremely limited.",

Previous studies revealed that dendritic cell (DC)-restricted antigen presentation alone could initiate the Tfh cell program but could not complete ultimate effector differentiation10. However, the cooperation of MHC-II-positive DCs and B cells could realize the optimal effect in Tfh and germinal center (GC) B-cell differentiation in response to viral infection11. Tfh, along with follicular DCs, repeatedly undergo intimate interactions with the antigen-experienced B cells in GC to facilitate the B-cell expansion, differentiation and affinity maturation of plasmablast and memory B cells for the generation of high affinity antibodies12,13. Therefore, Tfh, mainly residing at the GC of lymph node (LN) and spleen (SP)13, play the pivotal role in the production of pathogen-specific class-switched neutralizing antibodies. A number of earlier studies demonstrated that peripheral Tfh (pTfh) cells exhibited transcriptional and phenotypic similarities to lymphoid Tfh cells9,14. We, therefore, investigated the regulatory status of Tfh in the peripheral blood of SFTS patients.",

In addition, IL-4 and IL-21 have been shown to be the fundamental effectors of Tfh cells in Th2 humoral response16. IL-21 has been shown to be a critical marker of Tfh cells in both phenotype and function9,13.

In contrast, NP-specific IgM was positive at early time points after symptom onset and remained positive during the entire hospital stay in all recovered patients.

The quantitative RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that the serum viral loads of all survived patients gradually decreased during acute phase of SFTS, and became undetectable within 7\u201312 days after symptom onset (Fig. 2a). Strikingly, all deceased patients maintained continuously high levels of viremia from symptom onset until they succumbed to the disease. The viral loads of the deceased group were significantly higher than the survived group in the 3-week period post symptom onset (p < 0.005). The mean log10 values of the viral load in the deceased patients were 7.5, 8.2 and 8.0 for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd weeks, respectively, as compared with 5.3, 1.9 and 0 in the survived patients (Fig. 2a). NP-IgG titers had strong association with serum viral load as shown by correlation analysis of the dynamic data of 10 survived and 5 deceased patients (Fig. 2b), suggesting that virus-specific IgG exerted crucial effect in viral clearance. However, the correlation between NP-IgM titers with the viral load was not significant (Fig. 2b). In order to confirm the role of virus-specific antibodies in the clearance of virus, we further investigated the neutralization activity of Gn-specific antiserum from an immunized camel, and sera from a convalescent patient and a deceased patient (Fig. 2c). The results showed that the sera of both Gn-immunized camel and the convalescent patient effectively neutralized SFTSV, with 50% FRNT value at 0.118 \u00b1 0.001 and 0.009 \u00b1 0.002, respectively. In comparison, the serum from the deceased patient failed to show any significant neutralization.",

The regulation of the proportion and numbers of each B-cell subset also exhibited high consistency. The proportion of naive B cells within total peripheral B cells of the deceased and the survived groups was significantly lower than that of the healthy control in the 3-week period post symptom onset (Fig. 3c). Interestingly, the mean weekly frequency of the naive B cells in the deceased group dramatically reduced to only 6.8, 5.7, and 5.2 in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd weeks, respectively, in contrast to 25.4, 23.3, and 21.6 in the survived group.

Although the fraction of MBs in total B cells did not differ between the deceased and the survived groups, the fraction of PBs in the deceased group increased significantly more than the survived group during the entire acute phase (Fig. 3d). The significant increase of PBs is in stark contrast to the absence of serological response in the deceased patients, but nevertheless it is consistent with an earlier report that defective T-cell participation led to a surge of PBs during VSV infection22. The MZ B cells, another relatively small but essential subset, were significantly lower in the deceased group than that in both the survived and the healthy groups, and manifested a decline with the progression of SFTS (Fig. 3f).",

When proceeding to the antibody-secreting phase, B cells significantly upregulate the expression of BLIMP-1, IRF-4 and XBP-1. The result showed that the expression of all three genes in PBs was significantly down-modulated in the deceased group (Fig. 4e\u2013f). To further illustrate the functional regulation of ASC in SFTS patients, we performed an Elispot assay, which captures virus-specific IgG after cell stimulation in vitro using samples from three patients, representing different temporal phases and clinical outcomes. R848, an TLR agonist, was used as the non-specific stimulator28. The samples of two survived patients, P28 and P29, were collected at the early and later phases of acute SFTSV infection, respectively. The sample of patient P30 was collected one day before death. PB of two survived patients, but not of the deceased patient, produced Gn-specific IgG (Fig. 4g). Moreover, the stimulation with the combination of R848 and Gn protein produced more specific IgG secretion than with only R848 in the survived patients.",

To further explore the influence of pTfh on B-cell maturation, we performed a CD4+ B-cell helper assay by placing the pTfh sorted from SFTS patients in co-culture with autologous naive B cells, and assessed proliferation and CD38/IgM expression by FACS (Fig. 5e). Although both CD38 and IgM expression showed no significant differences in B cells between the survived or deceased patients, the greater proliferation of naive B cells was still observed when co-cultured with autologous pTfh from the survived individuals (Fig. 5f).

The expression of co-stimulatory molecule CD86 on mDCs from the 2nd week and the proportion of CD80+CD86+/mDCs in the 3rd week of the survived patients were significantly higher than that of the deceased patients, as the expression of CD80 showed no meaningful difference between both patients\u2019 groups (Fig. 6g, h). These data suggest that the differential activation of mDCs in the survived and the deceased patients was mainly due to the expression of CD86, which may impact on their antigen presentation function. In order to further evaluate the antigen-presentation function of mDCs during SFTS virus infection, we isolated mDCs from peripheral blood of healthy donors and performed allogenic DC/T-cell co-culture and stimulation assay using in vitro infection model35\u201337 (Fig. 6i, j). When mDCs were infected with SFTS virus, the proliferation rate of T cells as measured by CFSE tagging and the level of IFN-\u03b3 in the supernatant were significantly lower than that of the mock infection, demonstrating that mDC activation of T cells could be inhibited by SFTS virus infection.",

A radar plot analysis was presented in Fig. 8b to show the dynamic profile of the cytokine regulation during the three weeks of acute infection. In the 1st week, serum levels of IFN-\u03b3, IL-23, IL-12 and IL-10 increased dramatically in the deceased patients, with IL-4 and TNF-\u03b1 increased to a less extent as compared with these in the survived patients whose GM-CSF level was higher. In the 2nd week, IFN-\u03b3, IL-23, IL-12 and IL-10 showed declining trend in the deceased group, but still had higher levels than those in the survived group except for IL-12. During the same period, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1, two representative inflammatory cytokines, were markedly elevated in the deceased patients. Although nearly all cytokines measured in the deceased patients decreased further in the final week, as compared with those in the previous two weeks, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 still maintained higher level than those in the survived patients. However, serum IL-1\u03b2 and IL-4 in the survived patients markedly elevated accompanied by improved clinical course. Interestingly, the level of IL-21 in the sera of nearly all individuals was undetectable.",

Neutralization assay confirmed the deficiency of functional humoral response in the fatal SFTSV infection, and implicated the potential roles of Gn-specific antibody in infection control.

However, phenotypic analysis of PBs by two different gating strategies showed a consistent but unique phenomenon that PBs in the deceased patients proliferated to a larger extent than that in the survived patients, which is apparently in contrast to the weakened production of the virus-specific antibody. The negative intracellular staining of IgG and IgM in PBs and the absence of virus-specific IgG provides compelling evidence on the dysfunctional proliferation of PBs in the fatal SFTS cases. Furthermore, the inhibited expression of BLIMP-1, IRF-4 and XBP-1, critical for the maturation and antibody production of PBs, indicated that the CD27+CD38+ B subset in fatal SFTSV infection was only phenotypical but not functional PBs. This functional defect of PBs was likely attributable to the inhibition of monocytes and dysregulation of cytokines48, which is under further investigation.",

We found that the pTfh peaked at the early phase of acute infection in survivors, then rapidly declined as the infection proceeded. This phenomenon can be explained that the antigen-experienced Tfh quickly migrates into the GCs to provide systemic T help for the establishment of the humoral response55. Similar phenomenon was observed in SIV-infected Rhesus Macaques, in which an early loss of splenic Tfh resulted in the deficiency of antigen-specific antibody production12. Therefore, we suggest that an early expansion of Tfh is critical for humoral response to SFTSV infection and for the control of viral pathogenesis. Although previous study demonstrated that ICOS played critical roles in protective humoral response against Influenza virus30, ICOS on pTfh exhibited no significant difference between two SFTS patients\u2019 groups, indicating that it is not related to the failure of specific antibody response. However, the expression of PD-1, a crucial inhibitory molecule of T cells, was upregulated and maintained at a high level throughout the entire disease course in the deceased patients. Despite PD-1-mediated CD8+ T-cell exhaustion has been well addressed in chronic infections and cancer56,57, its roles in acute viral infection, especially in the regulation of CD4+ T subsets are poorly understood. A recent study reported that high percentages of CD4 and CD8 T cells expressing CTLA-4 and PD-1 were the unique immune signature in fatal Ebola virus infection29. Our observation illustrated that the lethal SFTSV infection might share this \u201cunique\u201d immune characteristic with Ebola virus infection. Notably, anti-PD-1 immunotherapy has been shown to be effective and safe in controlling persistent HCV infection in chimpanzees56. Therefore, PD-1 may serve as a potential therapeutic target in lethal SFTSV infection.",

Meanwhile, phenotypic analysis of peripheral B cells demonstrated inhibited expression of both HLA-DR and CD80 on memory and MZ B cells, indirectly indicating the impairment of antigen-presentation function of B cells. After all, because the transcriptional and phenotypic similarities between peripheral and follicular B cells involved in antigen-presenting process are still poorly understood, the profiling of co-stimulatory molecules in the peripheral B cells would only serve as an indirect evidence for this process. Therefore, animal model study should be performed to further elucidate the role of B-cell antigen presentation in the pathogenesis of SFTSV infection in further investigation.",

One is that IL-10, IL-12 and IL-23, all immune-suppressive cytokines, were drastically elevated at the early phase of infection64,65, followed by a subsequent inflammatory cytokine storm leading to the cytokine-mediated organ damages. IL-10 has been shown to suppress GC formation by affecting Tfh cell function, in part by altering the expression of transcription factors BCL-6 and BLIMP-166. Additionally, earlier studies showed that IL-10 down-regulated MHC-II expression and co-stimulatory molecule B7, which is consistent with our observations in the present study67,68. The expression of IL-4 and GM-CSF, both absolutely required for the differentiation and maturation of DCs15,16,69, was markedly down-modulated in both monocytes and lymphocytes, especially in severe and fatal cases8. These observations strongly suggested that these cytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of SFTSV infection.",

We propose that during fatal SFTSV infection (Fig. 9), large quantity of naive B cells are continuously primed into PB cells by the presence of persistent viremia. However, due to defective mDC maturation resulting from massive monocytic apoptosis and insufficient IL-4 and GM-CSF, the differentiation of naive T cells into Tfhs is impeded. Lack of cognate Tfh and MHCII antigen presentation by mDCs and B cells, the initially primed antigen-experienced PB cells fail to mature and undergo immunoglobulin CSR, which accounts for a complete absence of virus-specific IgG response to NP and Gn, in the deceased patients. The current study also points to the roles of NP- and/or Gn-specific antibody response in the control of viral pathogenesis and shed light to the potential target for vaccine or therapeutic antibody development.",

Due to insufficient MHC-II antigen presentation by mDCs and B cells, the differentiation and function of Tfh are inhibited, characterized by the decreased numbers and downregulation of IL-21 secretion. Additionally, the expression of PD-1 on Tfh, which act as an important inhibitory molecule of T-cell function, was observed to be persistently upregulated in deceased patients. The expression of three key transcriptional factors, BLIMP-1, IRF-4 and XBP-1, was down-modulated due to the lack of Tfh stimulation. PBs failed to differentiate into non-GC plasma cells and were unable to secret IgM antibodies. b In the GC phase, Ag-experienced B cells interact with cognate Tfh and mDC. However, the B-cell maturation is impaired due to the dysfunction of cognate Tfh and mDC, which, together with the downregulation of TLRs and IL-4, inhibited the induction of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), resulting in the complete inhibition of immunoglobulin class-switch in the deceased patients. Red upward arrow and blue downward arrow denote up and downregulation, respectively",
