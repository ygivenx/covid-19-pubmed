AhR is a basic helix-loop-helix/PAS transcription factor localized in the cytoplasm. Because AhR is expressed in a variety of tissues, it mediates species- and tissue-dependent toxicities, including chloracne, wasting, teratogenicity, immunotoxicity, liver tumor promotion and carcinogenicity2\u20136. More recent studies have shown that AhR activation can not only cause toxicity but also regulate the immune response, specifically the regulation of T cell differentiation7\u20139.",

Several novel computational methods and algorithms have emerged in recent years to predict possible biological targets for ligands22\u201327.

Results from PharmMapper along with their respective normalized fit score, are provided in the Supplementary Table S1a,b. PharmMapper derives the pharmacophore models from the structures within PDB18. Moreover, we submitted TCDD to SwissTargetPrediction server which combines both 2D and 3D similarity measures with known ligands for knowledge-based prediction of potential targets30. Results from molecular target prediction by SwissTargetPrediction tool provided several possible interacting targets for TCDD in Mus musculus and Homosapiens. These include VEGFR1 and AhR, as well as several other targets as detailed in Supplementary Table 2a,b. Among these predicted targets, VEGFR1 and AhR showed a high probability of interaction in Mus musculus whereas in Homosapiens Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3, Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 along with VEGFR1 and AhR showed a high probability of interaction. The other receptors showed low (range: 0\u20130.08) probabilities of interaction with targets based on ChEMBL database. Results from SwissTargetPrediction by homology showed that TCDD was predicted to interact with enzymes (67%), Protease (13%), kinase (7%), transcription factor (7%) and cytosolic (7%) in Mus musculus (Supplementary Fig. S1A). In contrast, TCDD was predicted to interact with enzymes (53%) and kinase (20%) in Homosapiens (Supplementary Fig. S1B).

To elucidate the structural insight of mVEGFR1, we predicted the three-dimensional structure using homology modeling (Fig. 2A) based on the template structure of hVEGFR1 in complex with a ligand (PDB ID: 3HNG). For hVEGFR1, the X-ray crystal structure of placental growth factor in complex with domain 2 of VEGFR131 downloaded from protein databank (PDB ID: 1RV6) was considered for our study (Fig. 2B). The generated three-dimensional model for mVEGFR1 was validated using the Ramachandran plot. Results from Ramachandran plot analysis showed 97.8% of the residues (352 amino acids) in favoured region, 1.9% of the residues (7 amino acids) in allowed region and 0.3% of the residues (1 amino acid) in outlier region (Fig. S2A). One of the parameter to represent and measure the overall quality and deviation of the total energy of the protein structure is Z-score which is dependent upon the length of protein28. Results from PROSA web analysis showed the Z-score of the mVEGFR1 is displayed in the plot with a dark black point (Fig. S2B). The Z-score value of the generated mVEGFR1 model is \u22126.37, which is within the acceptable range \u221210 to 10 and is located within the space of proteins related to the NMR and X-ray (Fig. S2B). This is very close to the Z score value \u22127.44 of the template structure (3HNG) indicating that the generated model is reliable and close to the experimentally elucidated structure (Fig. S2B). Another stereochemical test to assess the quality of a modelled structure is ERRAT, which analyses the dimension of structural error for each residue and statistics of non-bonded interactions between different atoms in a 3D Structure model. Results from ERRAT plot analysis showed an overall quality factor of 80.240 indicating that the generated model is stable and reliable (Fig. S2C). Overall, the results from structure validation parameters demonstrated that the generated 3D model for mVEGFR1 is reliable for our study (Fig. S2A\u2013C).",

Among the different domains of AhR, ligand binding domain plays a key role in binding to the TCDD33,34. Therefore, initially we aligned the sequences of mVEGFR1 and hVEGFR1 with that of the AhR ligand binding domain to predict the conserved amino acids and calculated the total number of atoms belonging to these amino acids, TCa (Supplementary Table S3). To identify the pocket sites and to elucidate the atoms and amino acids lining each pocket, we used three binding pocket prediction servers: CastP, a web server35; Active site, an online server which calculates different cavity sites of a protein and analyses the xyz coordinates on the cavity; and FTsite, a web based server that calculates the binding site residues using solvent mapping algorithm36,37. Scoring results (Supplementary Data 1), of CastP and Active site servers were provided in the Supplementary Tables S4 and S5. Results from FTsite were shown in the Supplementary Fig. S3A,B. Molecular surface representation of pocket residues predicted using scoring function is provided in the Supplementary Fig. 4C,D.",

Results showed that TCDD forms hydrogen bonding interactions with the side chains of Ser 169 residue in mVEGFR1 and with the side chains of Thr 210 residue in hVEGFR1 (Fig. 3). These results indicated that TCDD has stronger binding affinity towards mVEGFR1 compared to hVEGFR1. Further, crystal structure of mVEGFR1 is not available and only a part of mVEGFR1 as recombinant mouse soluble VEGFR-1D7/Fc chimera is available38,39.

Results showed that [3 H]-TCDD levels significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner in VEGFR1-coated wells (Fig. 4A). The detection of [3 H]-TCDD was significantly increased at all three doses (250, 500, 1000 ng/ml) compared to respective non-coated well counterparts, indicating the specific binding of TCDD with hVEGFR1 (Fig. 4B). To check whether this specific binding of TCDD to hVEGFR1 could be blocked using antibody or another ligand, such as VEGF-165, specific for this receptor, we performed blocking studies with VEGF-165. Results showed that the wells, pre-incubated with either VEGF-165 or anti-VEGFR1 (1000 ng/ml) showed decreased levels of [3 H]-TCDD compared to those coated with only TCDD (Fig. 4C). These results indicated that TCDD specifically binds to hVEGFR1 and that this binding can be blocked with either competing ligands (VEGF-165) or antibodies for the receptor. Further, results from the phosphorylation of VEGFR1 in vitro in HUVEC cells, showed that TCDD can induce VEGFR1 phosphorylation (Fig. 4D), suggesting that the receptor may indeed be activated by TCDD. Overall, these results demonstrated that TCDD can specifically bind, block and phosphorylate hVEGFR1.",

MDS has been used successfully in elucidating ligand-induced perturbations in several studies reported previously35\u201339. In the present study, to analyse the conformational changes between hVEGFR1 and hVEGFR1-TCDD complexes, we performed MDS. To determine the stability of interactions and mechanistic aspects of hVEGFR1-TCDD interaction, we performed RMSD and Rg calculations. Figure 5A,B demonstrated the RMSD of the backbone and C-alpha residues in hVEGFR1 and hVEGFR1-TCDD complex. The magnitude of fluctuations indicated that both hVEGFR1 and hVEGFR1-TCDD complex backbone and C-alpha systems attained stable equilibration conformations during the first 20\u201360 ns and showed an increase during the last 20 ns of the simulation (Fig. 5A). Results showed that there is not much change in back bone (0.11 \u00b1 0.0 nm) and C-alpha (0.12 \u00b1 0.0 nm) average RMSD for hVEGFR1-TCDD complex compared to hVEGFR1 (0.11 \u00b1 0.0 nm, 0.12 \u00b1 0.0 nm). These results demonstrated that TCDD doesn\u2019t influence the stability of hVEGFR1 system upon binding. To analyse the compactness or spatial spread of protein mass36 for each protein system upon binding to TCDD during the simulations, we calculated the Rg of backbone and C-alpha alpha atom for hVEGFR1 and hVEGFR1-TCDD complex systems. Figure 5C,D shows the Rg of the backbone and C-alpha residues in hVEGFR1 and hVEGFR1-TCDD complex. Results showed that there is no significant difference in the back bone (1.21 nm) and C-alpha (1.21 nm) average Rg for hVEGFR1-TCDD complex compared to hVEGFR1 (1.21 nm, 1.22 nm). These results demonstrated that TCDD binding doesn\u2019t influence on the stability and compactness of hVEGFR1 system. Overall, these results showed that the binding of TCDD did not affect the overall conformational diversity of the hVEGFR1 protein system significantly.",

Figure 6A shows the RMSF of the backbone residues in hVEGFR1 and hVEGFR1-TCDD complex. Results showed a higher fluctuation in the loop regions (residues around 150, 175) and \u03b2-sheet regions (residues around 200, 216) with largest fluctuations occurring at the loop regions (Fig. 6A). These results again confirmed that the binding of TCDD did not significantly affect the hVEGFR1 protein system overall conformational diversity. Our molecular docking results showed a hydrogen bond between TCDD and Thr 210 residue of the hVEGFR1. Using the g_hbond tool of GROMACS, we determined the number of hydrogen bonds and their occupancy in the hVEGFR1-TCDD complex during the MDS. Figure 6B shows the hydrogen bonds in the hVEGFR1-TCDD complex during the MDS. Results showed that the hydrogen bond formed between Thr 210 and hVEGFR1 was stable during the first 20 ns but fluctuated substantially during the later last 20 ns of MD simulations (Fig. 6B). Overall, these data showed that the hydrogen bonds at the docking level (Fig. 3B) were maintained during the MD simulations. To characterize the global effect of TCDD on the hVEGFR1 dynamics, we calculated the fluctuations of pairwise amino acid distances on all possible residue pairs in both hVEGFR1 and hVEGFR1-TCDD complex. Figure 6C shows mean contact distances between residues observed during MD simulation in hVEGFR1 and hVEGFR1-TCDD complex. Results showed that the patterns of flexibility/rigidity in the hVEGFR1-TCDD complex are highly similar to the ones in the hVEGFR1 only (Fig. 6C). Results showed that there is small difference in the average mean distance between the residues in the hVEGFR1-TCDD (1046.38) complex compared to the hVEGFR1 (1047.92), thereby demonstrating that TCDD binding may be mechanistically relevant and may regulate the functionally oriented aspects of hVEGFR1 conformational dynamics.",

Further, results from the molecular docking studies were validated in vitro using the binding assays and phosphorylation of TCDD with hVEGFR1.

Our results showed that the hVEGFR1-TCDD complex interaction was stable throughout the simulation (Figs 5 and 6).

The VEGF family includes VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, and placenta growth factor (PlGF)50. VEGFs bind primarily to three endothelial transmembrane receptors, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and VEFGR3. VEGFR1/FLT-1 (fms-like tyrosine kinase) belongs to the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) subfamily50. VEGFR1 plays a crucial role in normal development and angiogenesis. Thus, targeted deletion of VEGFR-1, results in early embryonic lethality due to abnormal blood vessel growth42. However, it is noteworthy that VEGFR1 may play both negative and positive roles in angiogenesis43. Because VEGFR1 is expressed on both endothelial and nonendothelial cells such as immune cells and tumor cells, it may be associated with additional functions such as inflammation and tumorigenesis44,45. Recent studies also found that pharmacological inhibition and genetic deletion of endothelial VEGFR1 enhanced adipose angiogenesis and in a diet-induced obesity model, endothelial-VEGFR1 deficiency exhibited a potent anti-obesity effect46.",

It is well established that TCDD is toxic to vascular development especially during embryonic stage, which has been seen in several species tested40. However, there are very few published reports that link TCDD or its receptor, AhR, to VEGF family. For example, AhR agonists or TCDD were shown to increase VEGF secretion in bronchial epithelial cells41 and in the ocular tissues51, consistent with our previous studies demonstrating that treatment of mice with TCDD enhanced the expression of several genes involved in angiogenesis, specifically VEGF52. In contrast, TCDD-mediated coronary vascularization was found to be associated with reduced VEGF-A secretion. A previous report showed that TCDD differentially suppresses the angiogenic responses in human placental vein and artery endothelial cells50. Furthermore, compounds such as [3-(3,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrrol-2-ylmethylene)-1,3-dihydro-indole-2-one] (SU5416) were shown to have activity as a VEGFR-2 inhibitor and an AhR agonist34.

PharmMapper identifies the potential targets for a given molecule using reverse pharmacophore mapping approach where target proteins with highest fit scores between corresponding pharmacophore models and query compounds are predicted as potential targets33. SwissTargetPrediction predicts the targets for bioactive molecules based on combination of 2D and 3D similarity measures with known ligands. The predictions can be carried out in five different organisms including Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Bos Taurus and Equus caballus30.",

The scoring function and parameters used for predicting the residues lining the binding pocket was provided in the Supplementary Data 1. From the top three pockets predicted from the binding pocket prediction programs, we calculated the observed pocket conservation OPc i.e., the observed number of atoms lining the pocket and belonging to amino acids that are identical or conserved in the alignment. We estimated the expected pocket conservation EPc i.e., total number of atoms belonging to conserved or identical amino acids in the alignment with AhR ligand binding domain (TCa) multiplied by the number of atoms lining pocket (Pa) divided by the total number of atoms of the protein (Ta) (EPc = TCa*Pa/Ta). As a descriptor of statistical significance, we used Poisson distribution (\u03bbOPc/EPc e\u2212\u03bb/(OPc/EPc)! where \u03bb is the population mean) and Poisson p-value (e\u2212EPc EPc\nOPc/OPc!) to optimize the amino acids in the pocket.

In these studies, recombinant hVEGFR1 full-length protein (Biolegend, San Diego, CA) that contained the predicted TCDD binding site (Fig. S4) was coated on wells of white 96-well optical plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) at a concentration of 200 ng/ml overnight. For controls, to account for nonspecific binding of [3 H]-TCDD, wells were left uncoated. Once coated, wells were washed 3x with 300 \u00b5l of PBS with 0.5% Tween 20. Plates were then blocked for 2 hours with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA), followed by repeat washing as previously done. Then, wells were incubated with [3 H]-TCDD (250\u20131000 ng/ml) for one hour followed by appropriate washing using a Perkin Elmer 96 cell Filter mate harvester (Waltham, MA). To detect binding of [3 H]-TCDD, 200 \u00b5l of Perkin Elmer Beta plate Scint cocktail was added to each well and counts per minute (CPM) were detected using a Perkin Elmer 1450 LSC & Luminescence Microbeta Trilox counter. To determine specific binding of [3 H]-TCDD, CPM readings of [3 H]-TCDD from non-coated wells (nonspecific binding) were subtracted from CPM readings from respective VEGFR1-coated wells. For blocking assays, the previous steps were repeated until blocking with 2% BSA. After this blocking and subsequent wash step, wells were incubated for 1 hour with either a well-known ligand for VEGFR1, a splice variant of VEGF-A known as VEGF-165 (Biolegend, San Diego, CA)25 or anti-VEGFR1 antibody [AP-MAB0702] (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) at a concentration of 1000 ng/ml. After a wash step, [3 H]-TCDD was added to the wells at 500 ng/ml and incubated for 1 hour before detection of CPM as explained above.

The initial VEGF1, VEGF1-TCDD complexes were immersed in a periodic water box of truncated cubic shape (1 nm thickness) and neutralized with the respective counter ions. We used Particle mesh Ewald method for calculating the electrostatic energy71. Cut-off distances for the calculation of the Coulomb and van der Waals interaction were 1.0 and 1.0 nm. Energy minimization was done using a steepest decent algorithm of a maximum step size 0.01 nm respectively and with a tolerance of 1000 kJ/mol/nm. The system was subjected to equilibration at a temperature 300 K and a pressure 1 bar. Finally, the full system was subjected to 100 ns MDS and the atom coordinates were recorded every 2 ps during the simulation for later analyses. Comparative structural deviations in protein (VEGFR1) and protein-ligand complex (VEGFR1- TCDD complex of Homosapiens) during the simulations were analyzed. We used g_rms, g_rmsf, do_dssp built-in functions of GROMACS package to compute the root mean-square deviation (RMSD), radius of gyration (Rg), root mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) and secondary structure fluctuations. Further, smallest distance between residue pairs were calculated based on the distance matrices generated using the g_mdmat built in function in GROMACS package.
