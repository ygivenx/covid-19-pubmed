Bats have been called global reservoirs of deadly coronaviruses (CoVs) [3] and over 200 different viruses have been isolated or detected in bats [1], with new viruses being detected on a regular basis. Over nine hundred coronavirus sequences from bats have been reported [4] and recently, coronaviruses thought to have spilled-over from bats have caused serious disease in humans and agricultural animals. These include severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, Middle-East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and swine acute diarrhea syndrome (SADS) coronavirus [5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]. The spill-over of these viruses to susceptible hosts, including humans and agricultural animals, often results in severe disease.",

When the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) of a virus are sensed by a cell, the cell activates various signaling pathways to counteract the ensuing infection. During coronavirus infection and subsequent virus replication, the cell recognizes viral nucleic acid through cellular receptors or pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and mounts an antiviral response. This response is mediated through interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), a key transcription factor involved in antiviral interferon signaling. IRF3 exists as a monomer in the cytoplasm of human cells. When PRRs are activated in a cell in response to viral nucleic acids, cellular kinases such as TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) phosphorylate IRF3, which then dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus of the cell. Once in the nucleus, phosphorylated IRF3 binds to its response elements in the promoters of antiviral interferon genes and enhances the expression of interferons, such as interferon beta (IFN\u03b2) (reviewed here [24]).",

Little research has been done to study the virus in human cells, largely due to containment requirements. To our knowledge, there are no studies that have looked at the effect of MERS-CoV infection on IRF3-mediated innate immune responses in bat cells. Since vespertilionid bats have been speculated as evolutionary hosts of MERS-CoV [8,15,33,34], we tested the hypothesis that MERS-CoV cannot effectively shut-down interferon responses in cells from these bats. To test our hypothesis, we infected big brown bat (vespertilionid bat; Eptesicus fuscus) kidney [35] and human lung cells with MERS-CoV. We observed that MERS-CoV propagated to higher levels in human cells than bat cells. Consistent with other studies, human cells infected with MERS-CoV did not express transcripts for IFN\u03b2. In contrast, when Efk3 cells from big brown bats were infected with MERS-CoV, they expressed robust amounts of IFNB transcripts. Moreover, small interfering RNA (siRNA) mediated knock-down of and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of IRF3 demonstrated that IRF3 is critical for poly(I:C) and MERS-CoV-induced antiviral IFN\u03b2 response in bat cells.",

We observed that MERS-CoV propagated to significantly higher titers in human cells than big brown bat cells that were infected with either a low (Figure 1A) or high (Figure 1B) multiplicity of infection (MOI). To rule out the possibility that MRC5 cells were unique among human cell lines in supporting high levels of MERS-CoV, we infected additional human liver (Huh7) and human lung (A549 and CaLu3) cells (Figure 1C and Figure 2). We also infected insectivorous bat lung cells (Tb1-Lu; from the bat Tadarida brasiliensis), the only other commercially available vespertilionid bat cell line (Figure 1D and Figure 2). The virus replicated efficiently in MRC5, CaLu3, and Huh7 cells, but not in A549 cells (Figure 1C). While virus yields from the three permissive human cell lines varied, they were still higher than the yield from bat Efk3 cells. MERS-CoV did not replicate in bat lung (Tb1-Lu) cells (Figure 1D). To determine if the levels of DPP4, the putative cellular receptor for MERS-CoV, influences virus propagation in MRC5 and Efk3 cells, we quantified the amount of DPP4 transcripts in MRC5 and Efk3 cells by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR). Both MRC5 and Efk3 cells had comparable levels of DPP4 transcripts (Figure 1E). The cytopathic effect (CPE) observed as a result of viral infection with an MOI of 10 infectious units/cell was also more pronounced in MRC5 cells 24 h post-infection (hpi) (Figure 1H). A similar effect was also observed at a lower MOI (0.01 infectious unit/cell), where bat cells demonstrated reduced CPE at 72 hpi compared to human cells (Figure 2). ",

However, there is currently no information about the role of IRF3 in interferon signaling in bats. To test if IRF3 is critical for an IFN response in big brown bat cells, we treated Efk3 cells with poly(I:C), a synthetic double-stranded analogue of viral RNA and observed the cellular location of IRF3 by immunofluorescent microscopy. In both human (MRC5) and bat (Efk3) cells, IRF3 localized to the nucleus of the cells after poly(I:C) treatment; a hallmark of IRF3 activation (Figure 3A). We quantified the amount of nuclear IRF3 in mock and poly(I:C) treated cells. In both MRC5 and Efk3 cells, there was significantly more IRF3 in the nucleus of poly(I:C)-treated cells relative to mock treated cells (Figure 3B). We separated Efk3 and MRC5 cells treated with poly(I:C) into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. We performed immune blots for phosphorylated IRF3 (pIRF3), but none of the commercial antibodies that we purchased cross-reacted with the big brown bat pIRF3. However, numerous studies have shown that pIRF3, when detected with an anti-IRF3 antibody, displays several apparent higher molecular weight bands with a lower electrophoretic mobility than the unmodified IRF3 (laddering effect) [47,48,49,50]. We observed a similar laddering effect with IRF3 in the nuclear fractions of poly(I:C) treated MRC5 and Efk3 cells (Figure 3C; arrow), further supporting the translocation of IRF3 to the nucleus of poly(I:C) treated cells. In the figure, the cytoplasmic fraction is stained for calnexin, an integral protein of the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear fractions are stained for lamin, a nuclear membrane protein. ",

The knockdown of IRF3 in MRC5 and Efk3 cells was confirmed by immune blots (Figure 5A; protein panel). Knock-down of IRF3 significantly increased the virus titer by over a hundred-fold in Efk3 cells at 48 hpi. The effect of reducing the IRF3 expression on levels of virus produced by MRC5 cells was not significant (Figure 5A). Knocking-down IRF3 significantly reduced the expression of IFN\u03b2 transcripts in virus infected Efk3 cells (Figure 5B) and increased the levels of virus produced at 48 hpi (Figure 5A). IRF3-reduced Efk3 cells also displayed a dramatic cytopathic effect (Figure 5D) compared to scrambled siRNA-treated control cells. Consistent with the IFN\u03b2 transcript expression pattern, there was a decrease in 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthase 1 (OAS1) transcripts in IRF3 knocked-down Efk3 cells infected with MERS-CoV (Figure 5C). The effects of reducing IRF3 in MRC5 cells was not as dramatic as in bats cells (Figure 5A\u2013D), most likely due to MERS-CoV effectively suppressing IRF3 signaling in these cells.",

This suggests that, at least in some bat species, the effects of infection are not as dramatic as in humans. Munster et al. reported an interferon response in MERS-CoV infected fruit bats [10], but did not explore the mechanisms that might be involved.

We had compared these cell lines previously [38], showing that they differed in their response to poly(I:C), a surrogate of double-stranded viral RNA. We found that as compared to MRC5 cells, the virus grew poorly in Efk3 cells and that this was likely due to continued IRF3-mediated IFN\u03b2 expression in bat cells (Figure 1A,B,F). To rule out the possibility that MRC5 and Efk3 cells were unique in their response to MERS-CoV and did not represent the human and bat response, we examined additional human lung and liver cell lines (CaLu3, A549, and Huh7), and Tb1-Lu (bat lung), the only other commercially available vespertilionid bat cell line. The virus replicated in Huh7 and CaLu3 at lower levels than in in MRC5 cells (Figure 1C). However, in these cells, viral replication was greater than in bat cells. In addition, in contrast to EfK cells, human cell lines tested did not respond with increases in IFN\u03b2 gene expression when infected with MERS-CoV. While some A549 cells displayed a limited cytopathic effect at later time points (Figure 2), MERS-CoV did not replicate to any significant extent in these cells (Figure 1C). This is consistent with other reports that A549 cells lack DPP4, the putative receptor for MERS-CoV, and are therefore not susceptible to productive viral infection [51]. Tb1-Lu cells were also not susceptible to MERS-CoV (Figure 1D). These results are consistent with those of Yang et al., who showed that Tb1-Lu cells do not express DPP4 and are only susceptible to MERS-CoV if transfected to express exogenous DPP4 [52].",

This \u201ccytokine storm\u201d causes a massive infiltration of white blood cells and an over-amplification of the inflammatory response, which in turn damages host tissue [46,55,56]. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) is a key pro-inflammatory cytokine. We have previously shown that the synthetic double-stranded RNA surrogate, poly(I:C), does not induce a strong TNF\u03b1 response in Efk3 cells, unlike in human cells [38]. We observed a similar response on infecting human (MRC5) and big brown bat cells with MERS-CoV. MRC5 cells had significantly higher levels of TNF\u03b1 than Efk3 cells (Figure 1E). Big brown bats can probably limit an excessive TNF\u03b1 response when infected with MERS-like-CoVs and potentially other bat CoVs. In future, ex vivo studies with bat immune cells and in vivo studies in bats will shed more light on the evolutionary adaptations that allow them to co-exist with their viruses.",

As such, several viruses have evolved mechanisms to shut down signaling through IRF3 [28,29]. We and others have shown that bat cells can produce IFN\u03b2 in response to viral infection and poly(I:C) treatment [35,58,59,60,61]. However, the role of IRF3 in the interferon signaling pathway in bats is largely unknown. In this study, we have shown that IRF3 is critical for antiviral IFN\u03b2 expression in big brown bat cells in response to poly(I:C) and MERS-CoV (Figure 4 and Figure 5). We have also shown that big brown bat IRF3 demonstrates classical signs of activation in the presence of an activation signal, i.e., poly(I:C), by translocating to the nucleus after undergoing post-translational modifications (Figure 3A,C). In Figure 3C, although cytoplasmic fractions (C) are free of nuclear contamination (lamin), the nuclear fractions (N) exhibit some cytoplasmic (calnexin) carry-over. This, however, does not affect the observation that increased amounts of a higher molecular weight band are present in the nuclear fractions of poly(I:C) treated human and bat cells. ",

Since MERS-CoV infection led to an increase in IFN\u03b2 transcripts in Efk3 cells unlike in MRC5 cells, we compared different mammalian IRF3 nucleotide sequences to determine their similarity. We observed that bat IRF3 nucleotide sequences (red box) clustered separately from human (arrow-head) and non-human primate IRF3 sequences (Figure 6). In fact, bat IRF3 sequences seem to have evolved from a common ancestor for bats and felines. Bat and feline IRF3 sequences possibly evolved from a common ancestor shared by camels (Figure 6), the likely reservoir of MERS-CoV [9,16,62]. Bats have been shown to be persistently infected with coronaviruses [63] and besides bats, cats have been shown to be persistently infected with enteric coronaviruses [64,65]. There is indeed a need to explore the role of IRF3 in persistent infections.",

Saitoh et al. have shown that peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase NIMA-interacting 1 (Pin1) negatively regulates IRF3 in human cells. Pin1 selectively ubiquitinates and marks phosphorylated human IRF3 for degradation, thus limiting IRF3 mediated signaling [66]. We did not observe a similar degradation of IRF3 in big brown bat cells. Preliminary data indicate that IRF3 in poly(I:C) treated Efk3 cells degrades slower than poly(I:C) treated MRC5 cells. Although we have not detected IFN\u03b1 in big brown bat kidney cells, a delayed or absent negative feedback mechanism in bat cells might explain why cells from some bat species have been reported to have an unusual constitutive expression of IFN\u03b1 [58], which is speculated to prime the bat antiviral responses. More work is needed to confirm the role of IRF3 in constitutive and tonic IFN expression in bats. As we build our capacity to culture immune cells in vitro from big brown bats, we will develop tools to study IRF3-Pin1 interactions in immune relevant cells. ",

However, there could be other signaling molecules or transcription factors in bat cells that activate IFN\u03b2 expression and more studies are required to completely dissect the IFN\u03b2 expression pathway in bats. Knocking down IRF3 in MRC5 cells did not have an effect on the levels of IFN\u03b2 transcript or MERS-CoV replication (Figure 5A,B). This is probably because MERS-CoV can effectively shut down IRF3-mediated expression of IFNs in human cells [19,20,23] and the inclusion of siRNA did not significantly further suppress it. We observed more OAS1 transcripts in cells that expressed higher levels of IFN\u03b2 transcripts. OAS1 is an ISG and its expression is largely driven by IFN expression. This data further supports our observation that IRF3 is critical for IFN and subsequent downstream gene expression in big brown bat cells.",

            "text": "Although there was an increase in the MERS-CoV titer in IRF3 knocked down/out bat cells as compared to wildtype bat (Efk3) cells (Figure 5A,E), IRF3 knockout bat cells did not support MERS-CoV propagation to the same extent as MRC5 cells (Figure 5E) 48 h after infection. Our data indicate that IRF3 is critical for IFN\u03b2 production in big brown bat cells (Figure 4A\u2013C), but it is possible that these cells have alternate and yet unknown ISGs that are expressed independent of IRF3 and IFN\u03b2 expression. DeWitte-Orr et al. have shown that long double-stranded RNA can induce an antiviral response independent of IRF3 [67]. De La Cruz-Rivera et al. have shown that Pteropus alecto kidney cells display an atypical RNASEL induction along with a unique ISG expression profile when infected with vesicular stomatitis virus and yellow fever virus [68]. Similar adaptations may exist in insectivorous bat cells that allow them to co-exist with viruses that can otherwise inhibit these defensive responses in human cells. Further studies using siRNA-mediated knockdowns and CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockouts of known pathways will allow us to identify if bat cells indeed have alternate and novel mechanisms to control virus replication. As more bat cells become commercially available, it will be interesting to test these cells for MERS-CoV susceptibility and downstream signaling events. It will also be interesting to test the role of tonic interferon signaling and basal levels of ISG expression in bat cells. Next generation transcriptomic studies and a better coverage of the big brown bat (E. fuscus) genomic sequence data will allow us to identify unique patterns of ISG regulation and expression in these cells.",

Our data suggest that although MERS-CoV can effectively suppress an antiviral IFN\u03b2 response in human cells, it is unable to subvert antiviral interferon responses in big brown bat cells. IRF3 is activated as a result of phosphorylation by cellular kinases and in the future, as more bat-specific reagents become available, it will be interesting to identify kinases in bat cells that phosphorylate bat IRF3. MERS-CoV blocks IRF3 activation by inhibiting the phosphorylation of IRF3 by cellular kinases such as TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) [22]. The mechanism of kinase inactivation by MERS-CoV is not yet known. Future studies will focus on identifying mechanisms that enable bat TBK1 and other cellular kinases to resist MERS-CoV protein-mediated inactivation. It is also likely that bat cells and MERS-CoV proteins have co-evolved to establish a balance between the activation and suppression of antiviral signaling. This theory will need to be tested and the ability to isolate bat CoVs may allow us to study bat CoV-IRF3 interaction in a more natural setting. This study represents yet another unique observation in cells from an insectivorous bat (E. fuscus) that may explain the ability of bats and their viruses to co-exist. ",
