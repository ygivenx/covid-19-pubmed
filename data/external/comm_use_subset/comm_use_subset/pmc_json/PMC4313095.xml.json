            "text": "Annexin A2 is a phospholipid-binding protein that is widely distributed throughout cell membrane26. It is involved in several important biological processes, such as exocytosis and endocytosis, cell cycle regulation and immunoglobulin transport27. Annexin A2 overexpression has been described in many cancers, including liver, lung and kidney cancers28. This protein might play an important role in tumor cell proliferation and in the regulation of migration29, and it was identified as a vascular endothelial cell plasminogen receptor and plasminogen activator30 on the cell surface. Annexin A2 also plays a pivotal role in the process of thrombosis for antiphospholipid syndrome through mediating endothelial cell activation by anti-\u03b22 glycoprotein antibodies31. Furthermore, deregulation of annexin A2 expression in acute promyelocytic leukemia is an important mechanism for bleeding diathesis32. Recent studies have indicated that annexin A2 may be a target for autoantibodies in SLE, SS, RA, and systemic vasculitis, and it has been hypothesized that anti-annexin A2 antibodies can induce thrombosis by activating endothelial cells and inhibiting plasmin generation323334. Furthermore, another member of annexins has already been described, the serum anti-annexin V antibodies were significantly higher in neuro-BD patients compared to those without11. The homology analysis indicated that amino acid sequence of human annexin A2 protein had about 43% identity with annexin V. Our results related to the reactivity of anti-annexin A2 antibodies in SLE and SS are consistent with the reported literature, which further supports the reliability of this study.",

Sometimes, HSV (herpes simplex virus) considered being involved with the disease and the anti-HSV antibodies can be detected in the circulation serum of BD patients38. Streptococcus sanguis (S. sanguis) mainly inhabits the mucous membrane of the colon, mouth and throat, and the role of these organisms in BD immunopathogenesis has been reported394041. The HSP65 of S. sanguis that is detected in the sera of BD patients is highly homologous with human HSP6041. Additionally, it was demonstrated that there is cross-reactivity between the antibodies from BD patient sera and S. sanguis or recombinant peptides of HSP65 from S. sanguis4243. HSP60 can also elicit an immune response in humans, a response that although directed primarily against the microbial molecule44, providing a link between infection and pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, as suggested for arthritis454647 and multiple sclerosis4849. Moreover, the expression of certain cytokines is up- or down-regulated after infection in BD patients. For example, some inflammatory factors, including IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1 were up-regulated and IL-12 are down-regulated in patients with BD50, an increased level of IFN-\u03b3 was also observed in our patients with BD (data not shown).",
