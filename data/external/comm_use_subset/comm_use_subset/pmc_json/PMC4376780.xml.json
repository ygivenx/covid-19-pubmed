The resulting processed pre-miRNA is recognized by exportin-5 and transited to the cytoplasm [8, 9], where it is then cleaved by Dicer protein [10\u201313]. The miRNA generated by Dicer is incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) containing Argonaute proteins (Ago1\u2013Ago4) [2, 14]. Ago-bound miRNA serves as a guide to specifically recognize cellular mRNA so as to either induce their degradation and/or inhibit their translation [1, 2, 14]. Therefore, Dicer is important for the processing of miRNAs.",

Various cell lines can be infected by VV, including HeLa, CV-1, mouse L, and chicken CEF cells. VV causes major changes in host cell machinery shortly after infection, and the cytopathic effects (CPE) are observed several hours after infection. The miRNA pathway would involve in the pathogenesis of VV infection, e.g. recent reports demonstrated that VV infection suppresses the cellular microRNA machinery [20, 21]. In addition, VV may possess RSS activity through Dicer protein. The relationships between VV infection and Dicer protein have not been established yet. In this study, we are going to study the effect of VV infection on Dicer protein expression.",

            "text": "It is possible that during VV infection Dicer protein is cleaved by a viral protease at the C-terminus and the cleaved products are then degraded by proteasome degradation pathway. VV G1 protein, a predicted metalloprotease, is essential for the morphogenesis of infectious virions but not for the cleavage of major core proteins [35]. In addition, I7 protease is responsible for processing most or all viral core and membrane proteins in the late stage of VV life cycle [30, 36, 37]. These proteolytic events are involved in the transformation of immature virions into mature virions. There are five predicted cleavage sites for I7 protease (AG/X) in Dicer protein sequence. Therefore, I7 protease may involve in the cleavage of Dicer protein. To address this issue, I7 protease gene was cloned and expressed (Figure SII in S1 File). When co-expressed with I7 protease, exogenously expressed Dicer protein was reduced as detected using antibodies against the extreme C-terminus of Dicer protein (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 3). When MG132 was added, full-length Dicer protein was increased in the absence of I7 protease (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 4) while it was further reduced in the presence of I7 protease (Fig. 2A, lanes 3\u20135) as detected using antibodies against the extreme C-terminus of Dicer protein. The same samples were analyzed using antibodies recognizing the N-terminal T7 tag of Dicer protein. A band with smaller size was detected in the presence of MG132 when Dicer and I7 proteins were co-expressed (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 3). Expression of I7 protease could only be detected by Western blotting analysis in the presence of MG132 to stabilize this labile protein (lane 5, Fig. 2A). The plasmid expressing a mutant I7 protease lack of the protease activity was constructed by replacing amino acid residue 328 from Cys to Ala [30]. Reduction of Dicer protein was not detected when it was co-expressed with this mutant I7 protein (Fig. 2C).",

It is possible that Dicer protein was cleaved by I7 protease after a.a. 1817, and the cleaved protein (about 199 kDa) was further degraded through proteasome ubiquitin degradation pathway (Fig. 2D). To this end, a plasmid expressing the Dicer protein with mutation in a.a. 1816 and 1817 was constructed. Compared with the wild-type Dicer protein, the protein amount of mutated Dicer protein was no longer reduced after VV infection (Fig. 2E).",

            "text": "Reduction of Dicer protein in VV-infected cells (Fig. 1) may be caused by several different mechanisms. One possible mechanism is due to mRNA reduction (Figures SIA and SIB in S1 File), which is also reported previously [20]. VV is known to enhance the degradation of host mRNAs by two decapping enzymes encoded by the virus, D9 and D10 [40, 41]. There are still other possible mechanisms. The reduction of Dicer protein during VV infection could be recovered by adding araC to inhibit the VV DNA replication (Fig. 1). Therefore, in addition to the reduction of Dicer mRNA, a viral protease expressed after VV DNA synthesis is also probably responsible for the reduction of Dicer protein. I7 protease is required for AG/X-specific cleavages of viral membrane and core proteins during VV assembly [30]. Our results further demonstrated that Dicer protein was first cleaved by I7 protease after a.a. 1817 and the cleaved product was then degraded by the proteasome-ubiquitin degradation pathway during VV infection (Figs. 1\u20133). Comparing with the I7 protease encoded by VV infection (Fig. 3), I7 protease derived from expressing plasmid is much more labile because it could only be detected by Western blotting analysis in the presence of MG132 (Figs. 2A and 5B). This also indicated that tiny amount of I7 protease should be sufficient for the cleavage of Dicer protein (Figs. 2A and 5B). However, Dicer protein was reduced after the induction of I7 protease protein in the presence of more than 50 uM IPTG but not in less than 50 uM IPTG (Fig. 3), indicating that not only the tiny amount of I7 protease but also other factors (e.g., whether I7 protease interacts with Dicer protein or not) are important to cleave Dicer protein and facilitate its degradation.",

            "text": "There are many different ways of interactions between viruses and miRNAs. Firstly, host miRNAs could suppress or facilitate viral replication [5, 6, 38]. Secondly, many DNA viruses, including herpesviruses, adenovirus, polyomaviruses and papillomavirus, have evolved to encode viral miRNAs to potentially control various phases of the viral life cycle, such as latency, reactivation, replication, etc. [42\u201346]. We do not expect VV would encode its viral miRNAs, similar to those typical cellular miRNAs, because this virus is replicated in the cytoplasm. Thirdly, both our present study and Dr. Grinberg\u2019s report [20] showed that a suppression of host miRNA expression was followed by the reduction of Dicer protein during VV infection. Other DNA viruses may not suppress Dicer protein since this would affect the processing of their own viral miRNAs. Therefore, it is not surprising that VV, different from the other DNA viruses, uses a novel way to interact with miRNAs.",
