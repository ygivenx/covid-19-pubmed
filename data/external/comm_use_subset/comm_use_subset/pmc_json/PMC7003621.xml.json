This results in a substantial additional burden of hospital admissions each winter, both internationally and within Australia [2]. The severity and clinical impact of an influenza season varies from year to year and depends on a number of factors such as vaccination efficacy and circulating influenza strain. Early evidence analysing the 2009 H1N1 pandemic suggested that influenza A/H1N1pdm09 (A/H1) may have more severe clinical impacts than other seasonal influenzas [3, 4]. This evidence continues to be supported in the post-pandemic years with several studies showing that patients with A/H1 have an increased risk of severe disease compared to patients with influenza A/H3N2 (A/H3) [5, 6].",

Age was categorised into three categories (18\u201349 years, 51\u201364 years and 65 plus) to reflect current Australian recommendations for influenza vaccination [19]. For univariate analysis of categorical variables, relative risks and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated and \u03c72 or Fisher's exact test were used where appropriate to assess statistical significance of relative risks. We used the Students t test or Mann\u2013Whitney U test to assess statistical significance of differences in continuous variables between groups. Severity was compared between A/H1, A/H3 and the other viruses using seven outcome variables: diagnosis of pneumonia, admission to ICU, requirement for assisted ventilation, time to discharge, time in ICU, time on assisted ventilation and death. Multivariable models (logistic or Cox regression) were constructed for each outcome, comparing patients with INF-B, RSV, hMPV or PIV to those with A/H1 or A/H3. For the categorical outcome variables of ICU admission, ventilation and pneumonia (all yes/no), logistic regression was used. We used Cox Proportional Hazards Regression to assess differences in the risk of discharge between patients with different viral infections at any particular point in time, as an indicator of length of hospitalisation. Deceased patients were excluded from the Cox regression models. Patients with no virus detected, multiple viruses detected or influenza A unsubtyped, were excluded in all multivariable models. A P-value less than 0.05 was considered significant for all tests. The following variables were included in the initial model: virus type, age group, sex, COPD, CVD, diabetes, immunocompromised, asthma and cystic fibrosis. Variables were removed consecutively from the model in order of descending P-values, so that they were only retained if they were significant (P < 0.05) or showed evidence of confounding, with the exception of sex and age group which were retained for all models. A variable was determined to be a confounder if the difference between the adjusted and unadjusted OR was greater than 15%.",

Previous studies investigating the number of hospitalisations for non-influenza respiratory viruses are conflicting, with some studies showing the number of hospitalisations for influenza are greater than for RSV or hMPV [11, 12, 21\u201323], while others found that respiratory hospitalisations for RSV and/or hMPV are similar to influenza [24\u201327].

In 2015, patients with A/H1 outnumbered those with A/H3 in ICU admissions, despite having nearly 80% fewer hospitalisations (four ICU admissions from nine A/H1 admissions vs. 3/40 H3 admissions). This is consistent with previous studies that have shown that A/H1 has, since 2009, remained the dominant cause of clinically severe influenza, particularly in younger adults [3\u20136, 29], even though A/H3 was the dominant subtype causing hospital admission. In previous influenza pandemics, the pandemic strain has been associated with a high proportion of deaths in patients under 65 years, which continues, albeit at lower proportions, in the decade following the pandemic [30]. Our study provides further evidence that post-pandemic influenza can still cause severe disease in young adults. However, in other populations A/H3 has been a larger contributor to severe illness [31], but this can vary with age [32, 33], so the impact of influenza A will differ from season-to-season [34, 35]. In our multivariable analyses we adjusted for age, and therefore this impact may not be apparent.",

Co-morbidities were also less frequently present in patients with A/H1, however statistical significance was not reached (P = 0.074 and 0.067 for hMPV and RSV respectively). The lower number of comorbidities in patients with influenza may be due to a high proportion of people with comorbidities receiving the annual influenza vaccine, but vaccination status for the patients in our study was not available.

In 2015, influenza vaccination coverage rates in Australian hospitalised patients with acute respiratory illness was estimated to be 80.2% in patients aged over 65, and 57.9% in adults under 65 with comorbidities, with the proportion of patients requiring ICU being slightly lower in the vaccinated group than the unvaccinated group (5.7% vs. 8.6%) [37]. Influenza vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation in the elderly and people with comorbidities varies according to the matching of the vaccine strains with circulating strains [38]. While we found that non-influenza respiratory viruses can cause just as severe disease like influenza, we cannot say if this would be the case in an unvaccinated population. It is possible that influenza vaccination reduced both the frequency and severity of influenza hospitalisations, therefore this should be taken into account when interpreting the results of this study. We did not have information about the influenza vaccination status or antiviral treatment for the cases in our study. Therefore we are unable to assess whether either treatment or vaccination attenuated the clinical picture of influenza cases. In addition, while attempts were made to minimise detections of nosocomial influenza, the presence of nosocomial cases in our study cannot be excluded.",

The selection of ICD-10-CM codes used in this study to identify patients with respiratory illness was broad, which may account for the small proportion of testing. In addition, pathology testing for respiratory viruses was proportionally higher in winter compared to the non-winter months in our study (data not shown). Infections during the non-winter months may have been missed due to lower rates of testing [39]. In our study the rate of ICU admission among tested patients was higher than that of untested patients, therefore we cannot discount that a selection bias may exist for testing of severely ill patients which could skew results. In addition insufficient power may have been a limitation of this study. Additional studies are needed to further investigate the level of severity of disease in hospitalised cases with non-influenza respiratory virus infections.",
