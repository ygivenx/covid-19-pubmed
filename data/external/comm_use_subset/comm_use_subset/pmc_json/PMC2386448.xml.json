            "text": "A time periodic geographical disease surveillance system based on a cylindrical space-time scan statistic has already been proposed by Kulldorff [10]. The cylindrical space-time scan statistic uses a cylindrical window in three dimensions where the base of the cylinder represents space and the height represents time. As with the purely spatial scan statistic, the cylindrical space-time scan statistic imposes a circular base Z on each centroid of regions for each of T time intervals. For each of centroids, the radius of the circle is varied from zero up to a pre-set maximum radius, for example, so that the window never includes more than 50% of the total population at risk [8]. In this paper, we use a pre-set maximum number of regions K to be included in the cluster as an upperbound of the radius. If the base contains the centroid of a region, then that whole region is included in the base. In total, a very large number of different but overlapping circular bases are created, each with a different set of neighboring regions and each being a possible candidate area containing a disease outbreak. Let Zik, k = 1,...,K, denote the base composed by the region i and the (k - 1)-nearest neighbors to i. Then, all the cylindrical windows to be scanned by the cylindrical scan statistic are the cylinders with the base in the set",

The data are geographically aggregated to ZIP codes. The number of ZIP codes used were different for each syndrome, for example cases of the rash were analyzed in 252 ZIP codes and respiratory in 385.

For example, assume that ZIP codes i1 and i2, i2 and i3 are adjacent each other, respectively, but i1 and i3 are not adjacent.

We set K = 20 as the maximum length of the geographical window, and the maximum temporal length to be T = 7 days. The number of replications for the Monte Carlo procedure was set to B = 999. In disease outbreak detection, the recurrence interval (RI) is often used as an alternative to the p-value [14]. The measure reflects how often a cluster will be observed by chance, assuming that analyzes are repeated on a regular basis with a periodicity equal to the period of the study. For daily surveillance such as this analysis, the p-value of 0.001 corresponds to the RI of 1,000 days, i.e., 2.7 years, and an alpha level of 0.0027 corresponds to one expected false alarm every year.",

The tables show results for the days with p < 0.0054, which corresponds to the RI of at least 6 months. When looking at rash outbreaks (Table 1), both tests detected the same cluster with a single ZIP code 01951 on August 7, with the same temporal length (6 days) and the same RI (2.7 years). Note that the clusters detected by both tests from August 8 to 10 are not signals of an outbreak because the number of cases on August 8 must be 0, and on August 9 and 10, the number of cases of the cluster was decreasing. For respiratory syndrome (Table 2), each test detected a different cluster with the same RI of 2.7 years on August 12. The cluster detected by the flexible scan statistic contained 12 ZIP codes, while that from the cylindrical scan statistic contained 18 ZIP codes, with 11 ZIP codes detected in common. On August 13 and 14, the flexible scan statistic detected significant clusters with larger RIs, 333 days and 250 days respectively, while the cylindrical scan statistic detected clusters with short RIs, 91 days and 30 days respectively. The flexible scan statistic also detected a cluster on August 15 (RI = 1.4 years) with a temporal length of 6 days, while the cylindrical scan statistic detected a cluster with a temporal length of 5 days (RI = 200 days). For the 6 days from August 12 to 17 (results on August 16 and 17 are not shown in Table 2 because of shorter RIs), the cylindrical scan statistic kept detecting the same cluster, while the flexible scan statistic detected a similar but slightly different cluster each day. However, we should acknowledge the similar lack of evidence in Table 2 for a continued outbreak on August 13 to 14, because the number of additional cases on those days is very close to the expected number of additional cases. On the other hand, there is some evidence for an excess of cases on August 15 (23 additional cases), although the estimated relative risk is substantially reduced.",

Under the null model, each person living in NYC is equally likely to contract the disease, and the time of each case is assigned with equal probability to any given day. Thus, each case was randomly assigned to ZIP code i and day d with probability proportional to \u03bcid = popi, where popi is the population of ZIP code i. For the alternative models, one or more ZIP codes were assigned an increased risk on Day 31 and, when applicable, on Days 32 and 33 as well. For these ZIP code and day combinations, \u03bcid was multiplied by an assigned relative risk. For all other ZIP code and day combinations, \u03bcid did not change. Each case was then randomly assigned with probability proportional to the new set of \u03bcid to generate data under the alternative models.",

For the small irregular shaped clusters, A5 and Rockaways, the cylindrical performs better on the first day of the outbreak, but as more data accumulates, the flexible scan statistic has certain advantages in determining the precise size and shape of the outbreak. For the large and narrow Hudson River cluster, the flexible scan statistic performs better than the cylindrical one, with slightly higher standard power, much higher PPV and slightly higher or lower sensitivity depending on the type of cylindrical method used. Results may be different for other types of regular and irregularly shaped disease outbreaks, but the four examples used in this paper gives some sense of the proposed methods performance.",

When monitoring an occurring outbreak, on the other hand, geographical accuracy becomes critical and is then the key objective since we already know the outbreak is there. Our results suggest that we may use both the cylindrical and flexible scan statistic for disease outbreak detection, but for different purposes. Specifically, for detecting new outbreak that, one may want to use the cylindrical scan statistic. That is especially if we expect the outbreak to start locally, within a reasonably small and compact area containing only a few ZIP-codes. On the other hand, once the outbreak has spread to a larger area, and we want to monitor that spread, one may want to use the flexible scan statistic, with its ability to accuratly determine the precise geographical extent of irregular shaped outbreaks. This is especially true ones the outbreak has left its local area of origin.",

Also we applied the profile Q(r | s*) proposed by Takahashi and Tango [26]. This plot gave us a detailed description regarding power of cluster detection tests. Needless to say, it is possible to extend it to space-time version if we could consider the penalties for temporal false negatives and false positives, but we leave this problem for future work. Also, for the profile of the extended power, we chose to use a fixed cost of w- = 1/s* for false negatives and a smaller or equal cost for false positives. For more general situations, we could plot the full bivariate extended power function on the unit square.",

The proposed scan statistic works well for small to moderate sized clusters. Although we set the maximum length of the geographical window to K = 20, this is not large enough to detect the 20 ZIP codes of the Hudson River cluster accurately because this cluster is too long to be the subset of the 20-th nearest neighbors of any region. Computation time depends on the size of the data set and K. Indeed, for the August 11 analysis of respiratory syndrome data in Massachusetts, with 385 ZIP codes, a maximum temporal length of T = 7 days, a maximum spatial size of K = 20, and with 999 Monte Carlo replications, the flexible space-time scan statistic took 87.7 minutes to run on a 3.06-GHz Pentium 4 computer, while the cylindrical space-time scan statistic took only 9.8 minutes.",

This does not allow the scanning window to adjust itself as the disease outbreak grows or shrinks geographically over time. Recently, Iyengar has suggested using a square pyramid shape window which can model either growth (or shrinkage) and movement of the disease cluster [30]. For the proposed flexible space-time scan statistic, if we could consider the flexibility in both space and time, that is, evaluating all connected subsets within a cylinder instead of W in (4), we can detect more arbitrarily shaped clusters in space-time. For such an expansion, an efficient computational algorithm will be needed for the scanning process, as well as a more sophisticated mechanism for the interpretation of such complicatedly shaped clusters. The implementation and importance of such methods for disease surveillance and monitoring, is an issue for future research.",
