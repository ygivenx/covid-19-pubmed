            "text": "Porcine circovirus (PCV) is a small, non-enveloped virus with a circular, single-stranded DNA genome, belonging to the family Circoviridae, genus Circovirus [1]. Three genotypes of PCV are known to us, including PCV1, PCV2 and PCV3 [2]. PCV1 is non-pathogenic to pigs, PCV3 is characterized by PDNS, reproductive failure, as well as cardiac and multisystemic inflammation, PCV2 is pathogenic as the agent of porcine circovirus associated disease (PCVAD), which is a globally emerging disease with a huge impact on swine-producing countries [3, 4]. Post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), the first recognized PCVAD in Canada in 1991 [5], appears in growing pigs at the age of 5 to 18 weeks characterized by clinical signs of progressive weight loss, fever, enlarged lymph nodes, respiratory distress, and, occasionally, jaundice and diarrhea [6]. Common measures taken to prevent and control PCVAD were considered as follows: management improvement, control of co-infections, control of breeding and semen quality, improvement of herd nutrition, serum therapy and vaccination [7]. To our knowledge, no effective antiviral therapy has been adopted to control PCV2 infection in clinical settings.",

            "text": "NO is a short-lived and reactive free radical that is chemically able to diffuse within biological systems. In mammalian cells, the production of NO is catalyzed by a family of NO synthases (NOSs), which facilitate the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-dependent reaction of L-arginine with O2, to yield NO and L-citrulline [8]. Besides, NO-generating compounds, such as sodium nitroprusside (SNP), S-nitroso-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), S-nitrosoglutathion (GNSO) and so on, can also release NO. It has been reported that SNP alone provides NO+ as the major form of NO in culture media while SNP in the presence of ascorbate generates mostly the reduced form of NO, NO\u2022 [9]. The antiviral activity of NO activity has been demonstrated against a variety of viruses including Marek\u2019s disease virus, astrovirus, dengue virus type 2, herpes simplex virus type 1 and Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis virus [10\u201314]. Our previous study show that NO-generating compound GSNO suppresses PCV2 infection in vitro and in vivo [15], and the other studies also confirmed that PCV2 replication could be suppressed by L-arginine in vivo [15, 16]. As L-arginine is the natural precursor of NO [17], whether the inhibition of PCV2 induced by L-arginine is associated with NO, it remains unknown to us.",

Inhibitory effects of NO on PCV2 replication were further evaluated by relative infected cells, virus titers, PCV2 DNA copies and PCV2 Cap expression. As shown in Fig. 3, treatment with SNP plus VC led to significant increase in relative infected cells (Fig. 3e), virus titers (Fig. 3c), PCV2 DNA copies (Fig. 3d) and PCV2 Cap expression (Fig. 3f) in relation to infected control (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). However, the above-mentioned parameters showed no significant difference between SNP-treated group and infected control group (P > 0.05).

            "text": "Some events involved in PCV2 replication have been defined by previous studies. Wei (2008) reported that NF-\u03baB activation is important for PCV2 replication [18]. Another report revealed that PCV2 deployed PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) and glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) for its enhanced replication in PK-15 cells [19]. A recent study found that G0/G1 cell cycle arrest induced by PCV2 may provide favorable conditions for viral protein expression and progeny production [20]. Meanwhile, enhancement of PCV2 replication induced by LPS, IFN-\u03b1/IFN-\u03b3 and concanavalin A was demonstrated [21\u201323], whereas decreased PCV2 replication mediated by L-arginine, matrine and selenium was confirmed in vitro and/or in vivo [15, 24, 25]. Although the antiviral activity of NO has been proved by much research work, regulation of PCV2 replication induced by NO remains unknown to us. In this study, treatment of infected cells with NO\u2022 generated from SNP plus VC resulted in suppression of the growth of PCV2 while treatment with NO+ generated from SNP alone had no effect. Our data implied that the inhibitory effect of NO on PCV2 replication was induced by the radical form of NO\u2022, not NO+. Interestingly, A previous report revealed that NO\u2022 released from SNP plus ascorbate could delay and block rabies replication in neuroblastoma cells, while viral replication was not influenced by NO+ generated from SNP alone, and this data was similar to our study [26]. The mechanisms involved in the antiviral properties of NO were partially confirmed in previous studies, indicating that NO played an important role in regulation of viral protease [27], innate immunity of the host [11], as well as viral protein and nucleic acid synthesis [28]. For PCV2, we found that NO generated from SNP plus VC inhibited synthesis of infectious virions by reducing the number of viral infected cells and by downregulation of viral titers and viral DNA copies. Reduction in the number of viral infected cells may be due to the ability of NO to inhibit cytoplasmic penetration by the virus or to suppression of transcriptional steps. However, binding, entry and transcription characteristics of PCV2 influenced by NO was not investigated here. Hence, the underlying mechanisms involved in PCV2 replication induced by NO remain to be discovered in our further study.",
