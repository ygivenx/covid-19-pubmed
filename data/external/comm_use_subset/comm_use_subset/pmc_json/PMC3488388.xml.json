RT-PCR assays are the most sensitive (86%\u2013100%) and specific tests available, but generally require 48 to 96 hours to process [7]. Confirmatory tests include RT-PCR and viral cultures on properly collected upper respiratory tract specimens.

Treatment with oseltamivir should commence as soon as possible and antiviral treatment should be provided even if started later than 48 h.

In the present case, we initially tried to stabilize the patient's hypoxemia using noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV). There was no hemodynamic instability and no multiorgan, thus, there were no contraindications to application of NPPV. Unfortunately, we observed no spectacular results; NPPV temporarily improved oxygenation and reduced the work of breathing, but did not alter the course of the disease. On the other hand, NPPV is a procedure in which there is possibly increased risk of respiratory pathogen transmission [11]. Our patient, in a few hours, required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) support. IMV, with a lung-protective ventilation strategy, is recommended as the appropriate approach for managing patients with pandemic A (H1N1) infection complicated by respiratory failure [10].",
