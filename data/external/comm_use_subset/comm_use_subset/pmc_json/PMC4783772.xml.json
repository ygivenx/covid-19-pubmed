The ANB residue is located near His41 and Arg62, and is able to create two types of interactions: \u03c0-\u03c0 between the ANB and His41 aromatic rings and two hydrogen bonds between the amine group of ANB and the carbonyl oxygen of His41, and between nitro group of ANB and Arg62. The arginine residue in the X1 position is located in the Ser214 binding pocket and is stabilized by two hydrogen bonds with Ser216 and the backbone of Gly217. Additionally, it can form a cation \u2013 \u03c0 interaction with the Phe190 residue. According to experimental data, the preferred residue in the X2 position is Dap(GO1). Our model shows that this residue is located in the cavity normally occupied by the substrate backbone. The guanidinium group of Dap(GO1) is located in the nest created by the side chains of His99, Trp172, His175 and Phe215 (S4 pocket), thus creating strong cation \u2013 \u03c0 interactions. Additionally, we have found a hydrogen bond with the backbone of Trp172. The peptide bond between arginine (X1) and ANB-NH2 is located in the proximity of the Ser195 found within the catalytic triad in an orientation which allows for a nucleophilic attack at the carbonyl carbon. The most preferred residue in the X3 position is Dap(Cbz). It is located near the His57 residue of the catalytic triad and in this case we found backbone-backbone interactions. Additionally, we have found a cation \u2013 \u03c0 interaction with Arg62. The most preferred residue in the X4 position is Dap(O2(Cbz)). The chain Dap(O2(Cbz)) is located in the vicinity of His61, however the phenyl ring of the carbobenzyloxy moiety is located in the nest created by Phe59, Leu88 and Thr90. We did not find any significant interactions of the ABZ residue with NSP4.",

Chasing a single proteolytic enzyme in complex biological systems is a demanding challenge. In this work, the synthetic method used for the development of the library represents novel atypical peptidomimetics based on a submonomeric approach. The presence of a fluorogenic ABZ (2-amino benzoic acid) moiety and ANB-NH2 (amide of 5-amino-2-nitrobenzoic acid) fluorescence quencher pair facilitates in-solution fluorescence screening. The introduction of novel pseudo amino acid side chains such as those functionalized by different chemical entities of polyethylene glycol moieties covers a broad range of interactions between the enzyme studied and the selected substrate. The sequence revealed upon deconvolution of such DAPEG (Dap modified by PEG moiety) library supplement by typical amino acid residues is a novel approach, lacking any similarity to any work reported recently by our group. It has been constructed with two DAPEG units with different functional group on the side chains. Such diversified functional groups together with their glycol side chains offer multiple contacts between the enzyme and the selected substrate. As indicated, in position X4 a long polyethylene glycol side chain terminated by an aromatic group is preferred over other chemical entities at this position. In general, this result is in agreement with data provided by Perera et al.15 since NSP4 prefers an aromatic amino acid in this position. However, the side chain length is an important factor that makes a significant difference between Phe/Tyr and Dap(O2(Cbz)). In the light of data summarized in Table 1 that provides published up to date NSP4 substrate sequences, position P4 is dominated by hydrophobic amino acid residues (hCha, Phe).",

This was demonstrated using a panel of over 20 neutrophil-related proteinases which included NSPs and a family of human kallikreins recently found to be expressed in neutrophils (Fig. 5)20. The kinetic parameters of substrate 1 and together with its low (subnanomolar) detection limit make this peptidomimetic an excellent tool to study NSP4 activity in biological material. Until now, there is a limited set of data regarding the NSP4 specificity. According to Perera et al., the non-primed segment (spanning residues P4 - P1) of the peptide chain interacting with NSP4 should be composed as follows: Gly-Ile-Pro-Arg. The substrate sequence obtained in this study did not display any obvious similarity, except for the Arg residue in the P1 position, which ensures the proper substrate recognition by the enzyme. The exceptional proteolytic stability of the cleaved N-terminal fragment of the peptidomimetic chain is worth highlighting, as this clearly indicates that the only peptide bond susceptible to NSP4-mediated hydrolysis is located between the Arg and amide of ANB. In the molecular docking model, the binding of the P1 arginine side chain is stabilized by the interactions of the guanidinium group with residues building the external surface of S1 pocket, and the NH2 of ANB group forming a hydrogen bond with His41.",

According to Perera et al.16 arginine and serine residues located at the C-terminal part of the ligand display the highest activity toward NSP4. This result is consisted with the proposed model of binding. The arginine residue in the P1 position is long enough to create a hydrogen bond with Ser216 and the backbone of Gly217. A small residue such as ANB is able to create more hydrogen bonds (with His41 and Arg62) in comparison to serine in discussed position (P1\u2032). Our results indicate that the most preferred residue in the P2 position is Dap(GO1) while Perera et al.16 suggest arginine residue in this position. With the proposed mode of binding Dap(GO1) is located in the cavity normally occupied by the substrate backbone. This cavity is highly hydrophobic, created by the following residues: His99, Trp172, His175 and Phe215 (S4 pocket). None of the investigated residues fits better to the described cavity than Dap(GO1). Dap(MO1) and Dap(MO2) can create a set of hydrophobic interactions, however those residues are not able to create any hydrogen bonds. Dap(O1), Dap(O2), Dap(HO1) and Dap(HO1) are able to create hydrogen bonds, however, due to their high conformational flexibility, they are not able to maintain stable and strong interactions. The side chain of the residue in the P2 position cannot be too long, since we did not observe significant activity with Dap(GO2). According to the proposed model of binding, the most preferred residue in the P3 position should be Dap(GO1) and Dap(GO2) since both residues are able to form a salt bridge with Arg62. However, our experimental results showed the opposite effect indicating that Dap(Cbz) was the most preferred residue at the P3 position. The residue at the P3 position is located adjacent to the catalytic triad (especially H57). It might be suspected that the role of the P3 residue is also to protect the catalytic triad from external influence. The most interesting result was obtained in regards to the P4 position which seems to be occupied by an aromatic residue. Moreover, the chain length seems to be important in the activation process: the short chain (Dap(Cbz)) would interact with His61 and/or Pro96 while its elongation would weaken this interaction as a slight decrease in the NSP4 activity with Dap(O1(Cbz)) was observed. When the side chain was long enough to reach the protein surface we observed a major increase in NSP4 activity. Hence, the proposed binding place of the P4 residue is located beyond the ligand binding site; thus position P4 could be considered as a target for the design of specific and highly selective ligands for the NSP4.",

In this work the cellular libraries of peptide substrates (CLiPS) method was modified to support the screening process of peptides that enhance the proteolysis rate of a model peptide substrate. Both the peptide substrate and a peptide library of exosite ligands were expressed on cell surface of E. coli. The eCLiPS approach characterizes the functions of protease exosites and recognizes peptide sequences that are crucial for boosting protease specificity for natural protein substrates.

Standardized trypsin solution was used to titrate BPTI (Sigma Chem. Co., USA) which in turn served to determine the solution concentrations of the produced NSP4. The substrate ABZ-Met-Phe-Pro-Arg-ANB-NH2 recently developed in our lab was used. The deconvolution of peptide libraries was carried out by the iterative solution method25. The lyophilizates obtained for each sublibrary were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to a final concentration of 5 mg/ml, and then diluted tenfold in an assay buffer. The fluorescence tests were performed using a FluoroStar OMEGA fluorescent microplate reader (BMG, Germany). The excitation and emission wavelengths were 320 nm and 410 nm for the ABZ/ANB. Enzymatic hydrolysis of the peptide was performed in 20 mM Tris-Cl buffer supplemented by 150 mM NaCl (pH 7.4) at 37 \u00b0C and continued over 30 min.",
