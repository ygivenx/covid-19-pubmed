The first 27 reported cases were all related to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which sells aquatic products, live poultries, and wild animals [1]. The first batch of cases identified later showed no exposure or even no relation to Huanan Wholesale Market, and the human-to-human transmission was confirmed; moreover, nosocomial infections were reported in some health care workers [2,3,4]. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Chinese health authorities later identified and announced that a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was accountable for the outbreak of this pneumonia in Wuhan [5]. Thereafter, this disease was named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) by World Health Organization (WHO), and the causative virus was designated as SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses [6]. Within one and a half months, as of midnight of 18 February 2020, the novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) had spread from Hubei to 34 provinces in China and another 25 countries, resulting in 75,199 confirmed cases with 2009 deaths (Table 1) [7]. At present, the number of cases is increasing rapidly in China and even around the world, which is a big threat to public health. Thirty-one provinces of China have initiated a level-1 public health response. The aim of this article is to provide a timely review of the characteristics of the COVID-19 outbreak including the epidemiology, pathogenicity, clinical features, and measures of treatment, prevention, and control for this disease.",

According to the characteristics of serotype and genome, the coronavirus subfamily is divided into four genera: \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03b4 [14]. There are six kinds of coronaviruses known to infect humans, including 229E and NL63 of \u03b1 genus [15,16], OC43, HKU1, Middle East respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (MERSr-CoV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) of \u03b2 genus [16,17]. The coronavirus isolated from the lower respiratory tract of patients with unidentified pneumonia in Wuhan is a new type of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) belonging to genus \u03b2, and subgenus sarbe [5]. SARS-CoV-2 is different from the zoonotic MERSr-CoV and SARSr-CoV and becomes the seventh coronavirus to infect humans [5]. The phylogenetic analysis of the coronaviruses based on full-length genome sequences shows that SARS-CoV-2 has the smallest genetic distance from bat coronavirus, but only about 45%\u201390% similarity with SARSr-CoV, and a lower similarity of 20%\u201360% with MERSr-CoV [18]. Therefore, a bat is probably the original host of SARS-CoV-2, although the intermediate host may still exist in the process of transmission from bats to human beings.",
