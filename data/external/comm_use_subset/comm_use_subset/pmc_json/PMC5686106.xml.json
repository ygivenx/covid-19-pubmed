Each new EID crisis reveals our level of unpreparedness that is due to the difficulty to predict which pathogen will emerge and to the impossibility to develop new drugs within a few months. A strategy for broad-spectrum drug discovery is the search for molecules targeting host components indispensible for entry and/or multiplication of many different toxins and pathogens into cells1\u20136. Such drugs may have efficacy against unknown pathogens that will emerge in the future. Moreover, molecules active against host cell components should avoid the risk of drug-resistant pathogens7.",

They bind to cell-surface receptors to trigger their internalization. Then, they follow endocytic and intracellular trafficking pathways. Toxins, viruses and sometimes bacteria enter the cell cytosol from specific trafficking compartments8,9,11. Other bacteria and intracellular parasites may subvert cell compartments and trafficking components to build a comfortable vacuoles in which nutrients conducive for multiplication are found10,12. Thus, small molecules targeting intracellular trafficking pathways (e.g Retro-21,13,14 and EGA2,15\u201317) or host component (e.g amodiaquine3, bithionol4) exploited by infectious agents exhibit broad anti-infectious actions.",

ABMA was identified using a cell-based high throughput screen (HTS) against cell intoxication by the plant toxin ricin14. ABMA protected mice from nasal instillation of an LD90 of ricin. Besides, ABMA protected cells from intoxication by at least four bacterial toxins and from infection by three viruses, two intracellular bacteria and one parasite. In addition, the molecule was not toxic to cells or mice at active concentrations. We further showed that the broad-spectrum anti-pathogenic action of ABMA is associated with the biogenesis of host cells\u2019 late endosomes (LE) without affecting other organelle integrity. Hence, ABMA has the potential to inhibit any toxin or infectious pathogen relying on LE to enter the cytosol or build its intracellular vacuole.",

ABMA was non-toxic to animals after one intra-peritoneal (ip) administration up to 200 mg/kg. A model of ricin intoxication by nasal instillation14 was used to mimic exposure by aerosols, as would occur during an intentional release. Briefly, mice were challenged by an LD90 of ricin (2 \u03bcg/kg) at day 0 (Fig. 1C, closed circles). The first clinical signs of intoxication appeared within 24 h, all mice displaying bristly and greasy hairs. From day 2, weight loss was observed. At later time points other signs were noticed such as prostration, shaking and respiratory distress, with animals needing to be euthanized starting from day 7 post exposure. A statistically significant protection according to survival curves was observed with a single ip dose of 2 mg/kg of ABMA 1 h prior toxin challenge (p < 0.01 versus control, Fig. 1C, open circles). Forty eight % (n = 25; 3 independent experiments) of ABMA-treated mice survived, while in the control group, survival was 11.5% (n = 130, from 10 independent experiments). Based on this result, additional experiments were performed with escalating doses of ABMA. Administration of a single ip dose of 20 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg of ABMA prior to ricin intoxication gave improved, statistically significant, levels of protection as compared to the control group (p < 0.001, n = 5 for both groups). The 20 mg/kg dose fully protected animals through to day 21 (Fig. 1C). The 200 mg/kg dose resulted in 80% of protection of mice against ricin challenge with a single animal succumbing on day 15. The lower protection seen with the higher dose may be due to solubility issues of ABMA in aqueous solution resulting in uncertain biodistribution at the highest dose.",

The inhibitory effect of DT on protein biosynthesis was measured by the incorporation of [14C]-leucine into newly synthesized proteins. We observed higher levels of protein biosynthesis on A549 cells exposed to DT in the presence of ABMA than in its absence (Fig. 2A) with an EC50 of 62.5 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b5M (n = 3). At 90 \u00b5M of ABMA, DT toxicity was reduced more than 100-fold in the assay conditions. We also found that ABMA protected other cell lines (e.g. Vero, PC3, A431 and DLD1) as well as HUVEC primary cells against DT (data not shown). This indicates that the inhibitory effect of ABMA on DT is not cell type-specific. Anthrax LT cleaves the mitogen-activated protein kinase MEK219. Figure 2B shows that MEK2 cleavage by LT in HUVECs was partially inhibited in the presence of ABMA at 30 \u00b5M. TcdB and TcsL inactivate small GTPases by their glucosyltransferase activity. This disrupts the actin cytoskeleton and induces cell rounding20. ABMA reduced Vero cells rounding 4 and 8 folds, respectively, following a challenge by TcdB for 4 h and by TcsL for 18 h (Fig. 2C,D).

We tested Ebola virus (EBOV), Rabies virus (RABV), Dengue-4 virus (DENV4) and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) (Table S2), which bear a surface glycoprotein that mediates fusion of the virus membrane with that of the endosome after which the capsid is released to the cell cytosol to initiate infection26. HeLa cells were incubated 1 h with increasing concentrations of ABMA before infection with a recombinant EBOV Mayinga strain carrying an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP). ABMA treatment inhibited EBOV-eGFP infection with an EC50 of 3.3 \u00b5M (Fig. 3A). Baby hamster kidney (BSR) cells were incubated 4 h with ABMA before infection with the Pasteur vaccins/PV strain of RABV, ABMA inhibited the infection with an EC50 of 19.4 \u00b5M (Fig. 3B). Ribavirin, an antiviral drug inhibiting viral RNA synthesis and viral mRNA capping was used as a reference molecule and exhibited a similar EC50. Finally, Vero cells were incubated 1 h with ABMA before infection with DENV4, ABMA inhibited infection with an EC50 of 8.2 \u00b5M, while Ribavirin was about four fold less efficient in protecting cells from the infection (Fig. 3C). ABMA reduced cell infection by the three viruses up to at least 90% at 20 \u00b5M for EBOV and DENV4 and at 100 \u00b5M for RABV. In contrast, ABMA up to 100 \u00b5M did not inhibit infection of HEK293 cells by Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) (Fig. S5, see discussion section). In summary, we observed that ABMA inhibited three endosomal acidification\u2013dependent viruses.\n",

Proteomic characterization of the Simkania negevensis (Sn) containing vacuole (SnCV) has shown that it contains proteins from several main host transport pathways including the endosomal pathway13. Chlamydia trachomatis (Ctr) recruits multiple Rab proteins from the endosomes to the inclusion membrane and avoids travelling to the phago-lysosome as a final destination27.

Thus, we investigated whether ABMA could inhibit the infection of RAW 264.7 macrophages by Leishmania infantum amastigotes. Amphotericin B and miltefosine, which are approved drugs for the clinical management of Leishmaniasis, were used as reference drugs. Table 1 shows that all three drugs inhibited L. infantum intramacrophage amastigotes development with various EC50s. The EC50 for ABMA was around 7 \u00b5M. Interestingly, the two reference drugs were capable of inhibiting axenic amastigotes with an efficacy similar to that found on intramacrophage amastigotes, whereas ABMA had no direct effect on the axenic parasite, up to 100 \u00b5M. In addition, the ABMA cytoxicity was lower than those of the reference drugs. These results strongly suggest that ABMA blocks L. infantum intracellular development by an action on host cell while the other drugs are directly toxic to the parasite.\n",

            "text": "We have determined that ABMA can inhibit the intoxication or infection of cells by a variety of toxins, viruses and intracellular microorganisms. The toxins and the viruses rely on endosome acidification to enter the cytosol. The bacteria and parasite build a vacuole that incorporates endosome membranes and proteins to acquire their nutrients and proliferate. This may suggest that ABMA targets and modifies acidic endosomes and their homeostasis. We observed by confocal microscopy that live A549 cells treated with ABMA and stained by LysoTracker\u00ae Deep Red exhibited more intensely labeled and enlarged fluorescent puncta than cells treated with DMSO only (Fig. 6A, middle and left panels respectively). In contrast, bafilomycin A1 (Baf A1), a highly specific v-ATPase inhibitor that prevents endosome acidification, decreased fluorescence staining of cells (Fig. 6A, right panel). We obtained similar results with ABMA and Baf A1 on HeLa and RAW 264.7 cells (data not shown). To confirm that ABMA is affecting acidic endosomes, we used acridine orange, another cell-permeant dye for acidic organelles (Fig. 6A, central and lower panels). Similarly, ABMA induced larger and brighter red fluorescent vesicles in A549 cells, in contrast to the effect of Baf A1, which strongly decreased red fluorescence in cytoplasmic vesicles. Altogether, ABMA had an effect on acidic compartments different from that of Baf A1. Baf A1 is known to inhibit DT toxicity by inhibiting endosome acidification. It might be expected that combined effect of both molecules might annihilate the impact of each other: increased endosome acidification for ABMA versus decreased acidification for BafA1. Surprisingly, ABMA combined with Baf A1 had an inhibitory effect on DT cytotoxicity twenty fold higher than for each molecule alone (Fig. S6). This strongly suggests that ABMA and Baf A1 have different mechanisms of action and distinct targets. Moreover, this indicates that the anti-toxin and anti-pathogenic effect of ABMA is not linked to the increase in endosome acidification; otherwise it would be counter balanced by Baf A1.\n",

The efficacy of ABMA is variable according to the pathogens and toxins investigated. EC50 values varied from 60 to 90 \u00b5M in the bacterial toxin assays and down to ~7 \u00b5M against intra-macrophagic L. infantum amastigotes or ~ 3 \u00b5M against Ebola virus and ricin toxin. However, another key parameter must be taken into account to evaluate efficacy: the level of reduction of intoxication or infection for a given pathogen. For instance, DT toxicity was reduced more than two logs by ABMA; cell infection was decreased below 10% for RABV and down to 0 for EBOV and DENV4. The capacity of Ctr progeny to infect new cells was practically abolished by 75 \u00b5M of ABMA. All these agents and the corresponding cell assays to measure the compound efficacy are very different, which make comparison difficult. Finally, the ricin in vivo assay demonstrates that an inhibitor with a limited efficacy in vitro (5 to 10-fold reduction of ricin toxicity) can be enough to protect mice against a lethal toxin challenge. These findings suggest that ABMA may impair Ebola infection in mice, considering its lowest EC50 on Ebola among all tested pathogens and toxins in vitro.",

They all have direct actions on host cells instead of on the pathogen itself, at \u00b5M level1\u20135. Amodiaquine, a clinically approved drug to treat malaria, protects cells against multiple toxins (anthrax lethal toxin, DT, TcdB) and viruses (Ebola, SARS coronavirus, Rabies, Chikungunya) by inhibiting host cathepsin B3. Bithionol, an anthelmintic approved drug, inhibits host caspases and also reduces the toxicity of anthrax lethal toxin, DT, cholera toxin, Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A, botulinum neurotoxin, ricin, and Zika virus4. EGA, an active molecule against anthrax lethal toxin also blocks in vitro trafficking of various toxins (DT, exotoxin A, cytolethal distending toxin, Botulinum Neurotoxins, Clostridium toxins) and viruses (influenza virus and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus) to acidified endosomes2,15,17. Retro-2 was proved to have a broad-spectrum action on toxins (ricin, Stx, cholera toxin), viruses (Ebola, Marburg, vaccinia virus, enterovirus 71, adeno-associated virus, polyoma and papillomaviruses), intracellular bacteria (Sn, Ctr), and parasite (Leishmania) by interfering with the intracellular trafficking machinery at the EE-trans Golgi interface1,34,35. It is worth noting that ABMA and Retro-2 have demonstrated efficacy in vivo. Even if the list of pathogens tested do not overlap in these publications preventing insightful comparisons, distinct mode of action of inhibitors on host cells, and particularly on trafficking pathway, may explain the variety of anti-pathogen spectra observed. Thus, in some instances combinations of these inhibitors may increase, additionally or synergistically, the protection efficacy.",

In addition, MVBs/LE may fuse with the plasma membrane to release exosomes43. The endosomal pathway is essential for several toxins and viruses to translocate into the cytosol41. Importantly, LE could also supply nutrition (i.e. cholesterol, membrane proteins) for the development of bacteria and parasites inside host cells30,44,45. Moreover, similarly to what we observe on human cells with ABMA (Figs 6 and 7), knock-down of Rab7 in HeLa cells results in enlarged MVBs/LE with increased ILVs, which consequently blocks EGFR exiting from MVBs/LE46. Thus, the pharmacologic interference of ABMA with the cellular function of Rab7, a key regulator of late endocytic trafficking, might explain its broad-spectrum anti-pathogen activity.
