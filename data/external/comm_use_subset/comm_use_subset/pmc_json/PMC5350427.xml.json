            "text": "Lysophosphatidic acid (1- or 2-acyl-lysophosphatidic acid, LPA) is a naturally occurring bioactive phospholipid. Under normal physiological conditions, LPA is present at a low level in plasma (~100 nM) [1] and its concentration elevates at sites of tissue injury and inflammation [1, 2]. LPA is produced during phospholipid biosynthesis of cell membranes. LPA is also produced extracellularly by several cell types including activated platelets, leukocytes, epithelial cells, neuronal cells, and tumor cells [3]. Increasing evidence suggests that LPA plays a role in various inflammatory disease [4\u20136]. LPA regulates various developmental, physiological, and pathophysiological processes including cell motility, invasion, proliferation, survival, and production of growth factors [7, 8] through G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). Platelet-derived LPA plays an important role in tissue regeneration and wound healing [9, 10]. LPA also functions as a chemoattractant promoting motility of various types of human cancer cells [11]. Recent studies suggest that tumor cells stimulate the production of LPA from activated platelets, which enhances both tumor growth and cytokine-mediated bone destruction [12, 13], and that specific inhibition of LPA receptors abolishes the migration of cancer cell response to malignant ascites containing LPA [14]. The increased expression of LPA receptors is associated with an increased level of invasiveness in ovarian cancer cells [15, 16]. Thus, LPA has diverse biological activities implicated in tumor initiation and progression, including increasing cell survival, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. Paradoxically, LPA also induces apoptosis in certain cells, such as neuronal cells [17] and epithelial cells from different tissues [18\u201320], myeloid progenitor cells, hippocampal neurons, and PC12 cells [3]. However, the mechanism by which LPA induces apoptosis remains unclear.",

Previous studies indicate that ectopic expression of DR6 in mammalian cells induces apoptosis [21]. Our recent study suggests that DR6 induces apoptosis through a mitochondria-dependent pathway [22]. In the current study, to determine the mechanism by which LPA induces apoptosis, we surprisingly found that LPA induced apoptosis via upregulating expression of the death receptor DR6 in HeLa cells. In addition, our results strongly suggest that PI3K/PKC/MEK/ERK pathway and activation of the transcription factor CREB are responsible for LPA-induced upregulation of DR6 expression and apoptosis.",

Interestingly, as shown in Figure 1(d), the dose-dependent proapoptotic effect of LPA was accompanied by gradual augmentation of expression of DR6, a recently identified death receptor member of TNF superfamily. Treatment with LPA did not change the levels of DR5 and TNFR1, the other two members of the same TNF superfamily.",

HeLa cells were treated with various stimuli including 0.1 \u03bcM angiotensin II (AgII), 20 ng/mL insulin, 25 \u03bcM LPA, 1 \u03bcg/mL LPS, 50 ng/mL NGF-\u03b2, 0.1 unit/mL thrombin, 50 ng/mL TNF-\u03b1, and 100 ng/mL phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). The expression of DR6 mRNA was measured by Northern blot at different time points as indicated. As shown in Figure 2(a), it was noted that only TNF-\u03b1, PMA, and LPA significantly upregulated DR6 expression at 7 hrs. TNF-\u03b1 has been known to induce DR6 in several cancer cell lines [26]. PMA has also been reported to upregulate DR6 expression during T-cell activation [27]. As shown in Figure 2(b), DR6 mRNA expression in HeLa cells treated with 25 \u03bcM LPA increased transiently, with a peak level at 5\u20137 hr. As shown in Figure 2(c), LPA upregulated DR6 mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner and reached a plateau at 25\u201350 \u03bcM. This result is further confirmed by RT-PCR (Supplemental Figure 1). Next, we sought to determine whether LPA regulates DR6 protein expression following a similar time course. As shown in Figure 2(d), 25 \u03bcM LPA treatment transiently increased DR6 protein expression in HeLa cells as early as 9 hr, with a peak level at 15\u201317 hr.",

To determine the mechanism underlying LPA-induced DR6 expression, we first examined the effect of pertussis toxin (PTX), which inactivates the LPA receptor-coupled Gi/o type G protein [28], as shown in Figure 4(a); treatment with PTX inhibited LPA-induced phosphorylation of MEK, ERK, and p90RSK. LPA-induced phosphorylation of MEK, ERK, and p90RSK was also inhibited by wortmannin, a PI3K inhibitor, Ro 31-8220, a PKC inhibitor, and U-0126, a MEK inhibitor (Figure 4(a)). Next, we examined the roles of these kinases in LPA-induced DR6 expression. As shown in Figure 4(b), LPA-induced increase in the level of DR6 mRNA was strongly inhibited by Ro 31-8220, a cell-permeable inhibitor of PKC isoforms PKC\u03b1, PKC\u03b2, PKC\u03b3, and PKC\u03b5. Another PKC inhibitor GF 109203X also significantly inhibited LPA-induced DR6 mRNA expression, but not as strongly as Ro 31-8220. In addition to PKC inhibitors, the MEK inhibitor U-0126 and PI3K inhibitor wortmannin also significantly inhibited LPA-induced DR6 mRNA expression. The G protein inhibitor, PTX, inhibited LPA-induced DR6 mRNA expression too, but to a lesser extent. On the other hand, inhibition of p38 and JNK activity with SB203580 and JNK inhibitor had no effect on LPA-induced increase in DR6 mRNA expression. Together, our results suggested that PI3K/PKC/MEK pathway mediates LPA-induced DR6 expression.",

To determine the specific isoform of PKC that contributes to LPA-induced DR6 expression, we first determined the LPA-induced activation of major PKC isoforms, PKC\u03b1/\u03b2, PKC\u03b5, PKC\u03b6/\u03bb, and PKC\u03b4. HeLa cells were treated with 25 \u03bcM LPA for different time as indicated and the activation of the PKC isoforms was detected by Western blot analysis. As shown in Figure 5(a), upon treatment with LPA, all PKCs examined were activated to various extents. Among them, the high level of basal phosphorylation of PKC\u03b1/\u03b2 was not significantly affected by LPA treatment. Similarly, the phosphorylation levels of PKC\u03b5 and PKC\u03b6/\u03bb were also slightly increased by LPA treatment during the time course. On the other hand, PKC\u03b4 was remarkably activated upon treatment with LPA as determined by the rapid and robust increase in the phosphorylation level of it. Next, we determined the effect of expression of dominant-negative forms of these PKC isoforms on the LPA-induced DR6 expression. As shown in Figure 5(b), expression of dominant-negative forms of PKC\u03b1, PKC\u03b5, and PKC\u03b6 had no effect on LPA-induced DR6 expression. However, expression of dominant-negative form of PKC\u03b4 almost completely blocked LPA-induced DR6 mRNA expression. Together, our data strongly suggest that PKC\u03b4 is the major PKC isoform that is functionally involved in signaling pathway that mediates LPA-induced DR6 expression. These data demonstrated for the first time PKC isoform-specific transcriptional regulation of LPA-induced DR6 expression.",

The serine/threonine kinase p90Rsk is known to directly phosphorylate the transcriptional factor CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) [30, 31]. Thus, we thought to determine whether LPA-induced activation of MEK-ERK-90RSK pathway leads to the activation of CREB and whether CREB is involved in LPA-induced expression of DR6. As shown in Figure 6(a), LPA induced activation of MEK and ERK1/2 at a very early time point. Moreover, LPA also strongly induced the activation of the transcription factor CREB in a time-dependent manner. To determine the role of these molecules in LPA-regulated DR6 expression, we employed a siRNA approach. As shown in Figure 6(b), knockdown of ERK and CREB strongly blocked LPA-induced DR6 mRNA expression. As shown in Figure 6(c), Western blot analysis confirmed the efficient knockdown of the expression of ERK and CREB. As expected, the protein level of DR6 was dramatically reduced in ERK- and CREB-knockdown cells. These observations suggest that LPA induces DR6 expression through activation of the PKC\u03b4-ERK signaling pathway and the subsequent activation of CREB.",

First, to determine the apoptotic activity of DR6, HeLa cells were infected with adenoviruses expressing constitutively active DR6. As shown in Figure 7(a), infection of DR6-expressing adenovirus resulted in a dose-dependent apoptosis as determined by the cleavage of PARP, an indicator of apoptosis [32], and the activation of caspase-3. As a control, no apoptotic sign was detected in cells infected with virus expressing LacZ protein. Taken together, these results clearly indicate that overexpression of DR6 induces apoptosis in HeLa cells. Next, to determine whether LPA-upregulated DR6 expression accounts for the apoptosis induced by LPA, we determined the effect of knockdown of DR6 on LPA-induced apoptosis. As shown in Figure 7(b), as expected, treatment with DR6-specific siRNA strongly inhibited DR6 expression as determined by the reduction in the DR6 protein level. Interestingly, DR6-siRNA treatment also strongly inhibited LPA-induced apoptosis as determined by the reduction of caspase activation and PARP cleavage.

The function of LPA as a cell survival factor has been well studied; however, the mechanism by which LPA induces apoptosis remains elusive. In the current study, using pharmaceutical inhibitors, dominant-negative mutations, and siRNA approach, we explored the mechanism(s) underlying LPA-induced apoptosis. To this end, our results revealed several interesting findings. First, LPA induced apoptosis at pathologic concentrations in HeLa cells. Second, treatment with LPA resulted in remarkable upregulated expression of DR6. Third, knockdown of DR6 strongly blocked LPA-induced apoptosis. Fourth, LPA receptors 1 and 3 antagonist inhibited LPA-induced DR6 expression. Finally, inhibition of various kinases, PI3K/PKC/MEK/ERK, and their regulated transcription factor CREB strongly inhibited LPA-induced DR6 expression. Together, these results strongly suggest that LPA-induced apoptosis is mediated by upregulation of DR6 expression via activation of PI3K/PKC/MEK/ERK pathways leading to the activation of the transcription factor CREB, which controls the expression of DR6.",

DR6 is a relatively less characterized member of the TNF death receptor family of protein. To date, DR6 still remains as an orphan receptor and no specific cognate ligand for it has yet been identified. Most of our current knowledge about the cellular and physiological role and biological function of DR6 comes from studying the effect of DR6 gene ablation in mice or ectopic expression of DR6 in cultured cells [36]. Recent studies reported that DR6 expression is upregulated in neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and the upregulated expression of DR6 may contribute to the pathogenesis of these neurodegenerative disorders [37, 38]. Interestingly, LPA has also been implicated in apoptotic neurodegeneration [17, 39\u201341]; however, the mechanism by which LPA induces apoptotic cell death remains elusive. In this study, our data demonstrated for the first time that LPA upregulated DR6 expression and that knockdown of DR6 strongly blocked LPA-induced apoptosis, strongly suggesting that LPA induces apoptosis via upregulating DR6 expression. Thus, our finding that LPA-induced apoptosis was mediated by upregulation of DR6 expression suggests a possibility that LPA may contribute to neurodegeneration through elevating DR6 protein level.",

Studies have reported that exogenous expression of DR6 could mimic ligand activation and triggered ligand-independent downstream apoptotic signaling cascades [21, 22]. However, although overexpression of DR6 causes apoptotic cell death, it has been found that the expression level of DR6 is elevated in several tumors in humans and the elevated expression of DR6 is regulated through activation of NF-kB [26]. Furthermore, these authors have also demonstrated that expression of DR6 expression could be induced by tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) treatment and TNF-\u03b1-induced DR6 expression is also mediated by activation of NF-kB [26]. In contrast to this finding, it was recently reported that activation of NF-kB inhibited (E)-2,4-Bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butenal-induced DR6 expression in colon cancer cells [42]. These controversial observations might have resulted from the use of different experimental systems, such as different cell lines and different stimuli, in these studies. Interestingly, in the current study, our data demonstrated that LPA-induced DR6 expression is mediated by the activation of CREB. Our finding further supports the assumption that different stimuli activate different pathways and lead to activation of different transcriptional factors that govern the expression of DR6.",

Regarding the seemingly contradictory effects of LPA on promoting cell survival and apoptosis, one possibility is that the concentration of LPA used in inducing apoptosis is higher than that used in cell survival. For example, the concentration of LPA in promoting cell survival is in the 10 \u03bcM range [43, 44]. On the other hand, the concentrations of LPA used to induce apoptosis are mostly higher than 20 \u03bcM [17, 18, 39, 40]. Other possibilities are that different cell types express different isoforms of LPA receptors and have unique gene expression and regulation patterns that are variably altered by LPA signals, as reviewed previously [3].",

HeLa cells were transiently infected with adenoviruses encoding constitutively active DR6 with different multiplicity of infection (MOI); or a control adenovirus carrying the LacZ gene (LacZ). After 24 hr infection, cells were harvested, and the lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blot analysis for DR6 expression, caspase activation, and PARP cleavage. This membrane was also reprobed with anti-\u03b2-actin antibody to indicate relative loading of samples (bottom panel). The blot is a representative of 3 independent experiments (n = 3). (b) Downregulation of DR6 expression by siRNA attenuates LPA-triggered apoptosis. HeLa cells were treated with LPA in the presence of control siRNA or DR6 siRNA. The expressions of DR6 and activation of caspase-7, caspase-3, and PARP cleavage were measured by Western analysis. n = 4. (c) The proposed molecular mechanism of LPA-induced DR6 expression in HeLa cells. LPA ligand binds to its receptors LPAR1 or LPAR3 to initiate the cell signaling by activation PI3K, followed by the activation of PKC \u03b4 and MEK, which phosphorylate ERK1/2. ERK then activates CREB probably mediated by activation of P90-RSK.",
