The msBWTs were constructed using a hybrid combination of ropeBWT (Li 2014) and the msBWT merge algorithm (Holt and McMillan 2014) as described at https://github.com/holtjma/msbwt/wiki. The msBWTs are a lossless compressed form of the raw, sequenced reads that can be efficiently queried to find number of occurrences of and/or the associated read fragments containing any specified subsequence or k-mer. The msBWTs were used to efficiently genotype each of the sequenced samples, in less time than a short-read alignment followed by variant calling. The msBWTs were also used to do targeted genome assemblies in regions to resolve the exact boundaries of genomic deletions, and to resolve the boundaries of recombination events.",

A set of 42.2 million informative variants between the eight CC founders were extracted from the May 2015, version 5 release of the MGP SNPs and indels variant call format (VCF) file. From this set we selected 31.3 million variants that were biallelic among the CC founder strains and with no other variant within 12 bases. We excluded all Y chromosome variants, due to uncertainties in the sex of the samples sequenced by the Sanger Institute. We replaced these with 42 Y chromosome variants from the Affymetrix Mouse Diversity Array (Yang et al. 2009, 2011) that are known to segregate between CC founder males and generate no-calls in female samples. In addition, the msBWTs were used to ascertain 22 additional Y variants. The resulting 64 marker set (available at http://csbio.unc.edu/CCstatus/CCGenomes) was sufficient to distinguish each of the eight founders in the presence of errors and reduced hemizygous coverage.",

            "text": "The concept of the CC was first laid out in 2002 (Threadgill et al. 2002) followed by a white paper (Churchill et al. 2004) and a series of proof-of-principle experiments (Fouldes-Mathes et al. 2011; Aylor et al. 2011; Durrant et al. 2011; Kelada et al. 2012; Ferris et al. 2013; Gralinski et al. 2015). In 2012 the CC Consortium provided the first overview of the genomes of the CC lines (Collaborative Cross Consortium 2012). However, unfettered access to the CC population has only recently become a reality. This reflects the decision not to release a CC strain until it had reached a minimum level of inbreeding (typically >90% of the genome fixed by haplotype) and the need to establish distribution centers to ensure a common level of genetic QC (Welsh et al. 2012). Determination of the level of inbreeding relied on genotyping of select individuals within each pedigree and identification of obligate ancestors (MRCAs) of each strain that jointly fulfilled the requirement for the level of inbreeding. Once a strain is deemed distributable, it is renamed as CCxxx/yyy where \u201cx\u201d are consecutive numbers and \u201cy\u201d are several letter identifiers of the breeding site where the CC strain was initiated and currently maintained (Unc, Tau, and Geni).",

The analysis of the haplotype block size was performed independently in the autosomes and chromosome X (Figure 1C).

In the best-case scenario, breakpoints are resolved to recombination intervals spanned by short sequence reads. In the example shown in Figure 2, the recombination interval in the sequenced sample is 2.5% as long as the one detected by genotyping in the MRCAs (298 bp vs. 11.7 kb, respectively). Given that many of these recombination intervals span known genes, this should also increase power and precision of mapping studies.

In all cases, the distortion results from the underrepresentation of one or more of the three wild-derived strains, CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhJ, and WSB/EiJ. We conclude that the distortion arises through some form of selection (see Discussion). To gain further insight, we plotted the founder frequency along the chromosomes (Figure S5) and the founder frequency of contribution per chromosome (Figure S6). No obvious peaks are present in the autosomes, in contrast with the initial analysis of the CC (Aylor et al. 2011; Collaborative Cross Consortium 2012) of strong distortion in favor of the WSB/EiJ allele at the R2d2 locus (Didion et al. 2015). Although the representation of CAST/EiJ and PWK/PhJ varies among chromosomes, it is lower than the expectation of 12.5% on 16 autosomes for each of these two strains.

To perform this analysis, we calculated the fraction of the genome contributed by each one of the 36 possible diplotype states in both the MRCA and the sequenced sample. We then estimated whether the observed frequency of each one of the 28 heterozygous states is as expected from the overall contribution of the founders to that strain and aggregated data across all 56 CC strains. Interestingly the contribution of the founder strain is not independent of its zygosity status in both cohorts (Wilcoxon rank-sum tests P = 8.5 \u00d7 10\u22123\nP = 9.1 \u00d7 10\u22128 MRCAs and sequence, respectively) (Figure 3). The three wild-derived strains contribute significantly higher amounts to the heterozygous regions than would be expected from their contribution to the homozygous regions. In fact, the maximum discrepancies between the expected and observed values are found for CAST/EiJ and PWK/PhJ heterozygosity. We conclude that although selection systematically has purged CAST/EiJ and PWK/PhJ from the CC genomes, regions of residual heterozygosity are retained by selection (see Discussion).",

Here we focus on the 26,800 private mutations on the autosomes and X chromosome. There are 14,917 SNP variants and 11,883 small indels. Most of the private variants (13,607 SNPs and 9061 indels) are not previously reported in any mouse strains. There are 6.87 private SNPs and 8.33 private indels per megabase on autosomes and 13.78 private SNPs and 15.32 private indels per megabase on the X chromosome. The proportion of indels among private variants (44.3%) is substantially higher compared to the HQHom variants. This suggests that errors among the private variant calls are higher for indel calls and may also be higher on the X chromosome relative to autosomes. The pattern of nucleotide substitutions among private SNPs (Table 2) and the frequency of variants at CpG sites (n = 1343, 9%) are consistent with expectations and similar to the patterns seen in HQHom variants.",

The average frequency of private SNPs across all strains, chromosomes, and haplotypes is 0.0867/Mb and the indel frequency is 0.0690/Mb. However, variant call rates associated with PWK/PhJ and CAST/EiJ haplotype blocks are substantially higher than this average (Table S6). The rate of SNP calls is increased by twofold to \u223c0.13/Mb and the rate of indels is increased by 10-fold to \u223c0.27/Mb. We hypothesize that the excess of variant calls in two wild-derived genomes have resulted from structural differences from the reference genome and paralogous variation. The chromosome and haplotype specific rates of SNP and indels (Figure 5A) are lowest on C57BL/6 haplotypes and moderately increase with genetic distance from the reference strain. Private variant rates on the X chromosome (which are expected to have \u223c1/2 depth of read coverage compared to autosomes in sequence data obtained from male mice) are generally higher than for autosomes. It is interesting to note that chromosome 14, which includes an extensive region of introgression from Mus musculus musculus into the C57BL/6 genome (Yang et al. 2011), has the lowest rates of private variant calls among PWK/PhJ haplotypes in the CC strains.",

Chromosomal differences were primarily due to the autosome vs. X contrast and haplotype differences were due to the contrast between CAST/EiJ and PWK/PhJ (wild strains) vs. the remaining six founders. The average frequency of private SNP variants on nonwild-derived segments of autosomes is 0.0758/Mb. The frequency of SNP variants is increased 1.66-fold (P < 2e\u221216) on chromosome X and is increased 1.70-fold (P < 2e\u221216) in wild-derived haplotypes. The average frequency of private indels is 0.0353/Mb, approximately half the frequency of SNPs. In contrast to SNPs, indel frequency is not substantially different on the X chromosome compared to autosomes (1.18-fold, P = 1.1e\u22125). However, the frequency of indels on wild-derived haplotypes is increased 7.77-fold (P < 2e\u221216) compared to the nonwild haplotype blocks. As there is no a priori reason to believe that mutation rates are higher in the wild-derived haplotype blocks, we attribute the excess of variants to higher calling error rates in the wild-derived blocks and, to a lesser extent, on the X chromosome. To estimate the rate of accumulation of new variants per breeding generation, we obtained estimates of strain-specific variants from the nonwild autosomal haplotype blocks. There is significant variation in the frequency of private SNPs across the CC strains and a significant trend with the breeding generation of the sequenced animal (Figure 5B). The trend corresponds to a rate of SNP accumulation of 2.4 \u00b1 0.4 new SNPs per gigabase per generation (P = 8.7e\u22128). The estimated rate of accumulation of indels is 0.48 \u00b1 0.32 new events per gigabase per generation, but is not statistically significant (P = 0.14). The impact of calling errors on the estimation of fixation rates is reflected in the intercept of the regression, because calling errors should occur at random with respect to breeding generation. For SNP variants, the estimated frequency of SNPs at generation zero (i.e., the intercept which is 17.1 SNPs per gigabase) is not statistically different from zero (P = 0.084); for indel variants, the intercept (21 indels per gigabase) reaches statistical significance (P = 0.0086), consistent with other evidence supporting a higher error rate for calling private indels. Going forward, validation of private variants will provide accurate estimate of calling error rates.",

We used these assays to validate the deletion in the corresponding sequenced sample and test its status in the MRCAs and in a representative cohort of current mice from the corresponding CC strain. The CC007/Unc deletion was fixed in both MRCAs and the current population. The deletion in CC026/GeniUnc was segregating in the MRCAs but fixed in the current population. This is noteworthy as this deletion removes the entire coding region of several genes, including the complement factor 3 gene (C3) (Figure 6). Finally, the CC055/TauUnc deletion was segregating both in the MRCAs and in the UNC Systems Genetics Core Facility colony. This deletion removes eight coding exons of the Npnt gene (Figure 6 and Figure S7). To test the effect of the deletion on Npnt gene expression, we used brain tissue samples collected by our group as part of a survey CC population. Npnt is expressed in the brain of several of the CC founder strains (http://csbio.unc.edu/gecco/) (Crowley et al. 2015). We used two qPCR assays to measure Npnt messenger RNA (mRNA) levels, one assay targets the Npnt transcript outside of the deletion and one targets the Npnt transcript inside of the deletion region (Figure S7 and see Materials and Methods). For the assay within the deleted exons, CC055/TauUnc mice homozygous for the partial Npnt deletion had no gene expression, while the level of Npnt gene expression is negatively correlated with the number of deletion alleles in heterozygous and homozygous mice for the wild-type allele (P = 0.011; Figure S7). Furthermore, consistent with the prediction that the deletion does not alter the open reading frame of the Npnt transcript, the assay outside the deleted region amplified transcripts from RNA isolated from all three genotypes (Figure S7). The results suggest a linear relationship between average steady-state mRNA levels and the number of wild-type alleles. We hypothesize that the deletion either removes a regulatory element or leads to increased levels of mRNA degradation.",

In contrast, the sequenced genomes represent just a single sample of two chromosomes\u2014a diploid \u201csnapshot\u201d\u2014from the CC colony. We are committed to increase the value of the sequenced data by genotyping additional contemporaneous mice and integrating both data sets to identify all regions of residual heterozygosity. We propose to use the first iteration MUGA array as the genotyping platform because although this array is lower resolution than more recent iterations, it was custom designed for the CC and may provide a cost effective platform to complete our goals. As a proof of concept, we genotyped three females from CC018/Unc and identified two additional regions spanning 23 Mb that were segregating in the CC018/Unc colony but fixed in the sequenced sample (Figure S8). We will expand this approach to all CC strains in the near future and make these results public as part of our ongoing efforts to characterize the genome of the CC with increased resolution and accuracy.",

Each one of these might have phenotypic consequences. For example, the chromosome Y from CAST/EiJ contains sequence present also on the X chromosome of other strains, increasing the dosage of a gene essential for early development (White et al. 2012; Chesler et al. 2016). Recombination can resolve whether coding and regulatory variants are inherited from one or another founder or represent a new mosaic combination (Figure 2). Finally, some of the de novo mutations such as large deletions should lead to null alleles in genes of well-known function. Alternatively, they can delete regulatory elements (Yue et al. 2014) and therefore provide a means to test their phenotypic effect. The CC is a mapping population with high levels of genetic diversity. An example of its value is the mapping of unplaced contigs, which improves the accuracy of the mouse reference genome.",

In this initial analysis, we decided to mask these regions to avoid introducing systematic errors in the haplotype reconstruction and mutation detection due to paralogous variation (Morgan et al. 2016b). We believe that this has limited effect on the haplotype assignment because these regions are cold spots for recombination (Morgan et al. 2017) and thus flanking regions tend to be concordant. Regions of recent IBD between the five classical inbred founder strains of the CC, which cover 13% (IBD between all five) to 92% (IBD between any two) of the genome (Yang et al. 2011), pose an additional challenge. By definition, informative variants are few and far between in IBD regions, imposing a fundamental limit on the accuracy of haplotype reconstruction. Incorporation of new haplotype-level variants discovered in the CC population and tuning of the HMM in these regions may help mitigate these issues, but absolute certainty is unlikely to be achieved for all of them. This difficulty is less pronounced in MPP from other species, whose founders tend to have less convoluted ancestry (Kover et al. 2009; Huang et al. 2011; King et al. 2012).",

            "text": "Two related mouse genetic reference populations, the CC and the DO, were designed with the expectation that selection would have a modest effect on their genomes. Based on the massive extinction rate among CC funnels (Shorter et al. 2017), it is obvious that selection has played a major role in shaping the genomes of the CC strains. Here we show that the contribution of CAST/EiJ and PWK/PhJ is significantly below the expectations in the autosomes of the 56 CC strains with contributions from all eight founder strains. This systematic underrepresentation cannot be fully ascribed to drift. Interestingly, the founder contribution in the first generation of inbreeding (Liu et al. 2014), in the pre-CC experiments (Aylor et al. 2011), and in the initial description of the genomes (Collaborative Cross Consortium 2012) was balanced (Figure S9). Furthermore, in 347 extinct funnels reported in a companion manuscript (Shorter et al. 2017), the autosomal haplotype frequencies are very close to the input. We conclude that genome-wide selection against haplotypes from the two wild-derived strains from subspecies underrepresented in the genome of the founders of the CC is responsible for these observations. Inspection of the haplotype frequencies across the genome (Figure S5), the reduced contribution to many autosomes (Figure S6), and the unexpected bias in founder contribution to the residual heterozygosity strongly suggests that selection takes the form of epistatic interactions at multiple loci (Dobzhansky 1934, 1936). We hypothesize that similar epistatic combinations of alleles from different mouse subspecies are not only responsible for extinction in the CC but also for the prevalence of strains with extreme or emerging phenotypes (Rasmussen et al. 2014; Rogala et al. 2014). In other words, the expansion of the phenotypic range in the live CC strains is the positive side to the astounding rates of extinction observed in the project as a whole. If this is the case, then extinct funnels may provide valuable clues to interpret the results in distributable CC strains. Inspection of the founder contribution to each individual strain in the strains with eight founders indicates that selection against castaneus and musculus haplotypes operated in most strains (Figure S1). In fact, in strains with fewer than eight founders but with contributions of CAST/EiJ and/or PWK/PhJ, the deficit in the contribution of these strains is magnified although it does not reach statistical significance.",

However, the ideal of absolute genetic stability cannot be achieved. The inexorable forces of mutation and genetic drift will result in a slow but steady accumulation of new mutations, some of which will have phenotypic consequences. The rate of genetic drift will depend on the effective population size and thus on the breeding and colony-management practices. Breeding strategies that employ cryopreservation to minimize drift can only be partially effective and may themselves result in new, unexpected sources of variation (Bouquet et al. 1993).",

In our analysis of 69 inbred CC strains, we were able to identify and place a lower bound on the rate of fixation of new SNPs and small indel variants. These rates are dependent on our current colony management practices but it is not likely that we can reduce drift to much lower levels. While small in number, the changes are cumulative. The great majority of new variants will be phenotypically neutral but some will have phenotypic consequences that may range from subtle to dramatic. Because new mutations are specific to one strain, they cannot be mapped directly using the strain panel, but they can be localized using secondary crosses. Rather than focus on the negative impacts of new mutations, we would like to emphasize their potential for providing new models for disease-related phenotypes. Identification of mutations and their likely functional consequences is key to leveraging genetic drift to our advantage. This is exemplified by studies in which crosses between very closely related strains have led directly to the identification of causal polymorphisms (Kumar et al. 2013).",

Large deletions are present in approximately one-third of the sequenced strains and are likely to impact coding genes and functional elements in the genome, often resulting in loss of function. Npnt provides an example of a deletion with a likely functional effect on gene function, despite the fact that the deletion is only partial and the open reading frame remains unaffected. Npnt encodes the extracellular matrix nephronectin protein that promotes kidney development. Mice lacking the Npnt gene show kidney agenesis due to its role in ureteric bud invasion and branching during kidney development (Linton et al. 2007). The deletion in the CC055/TauUnc strain appears to be associated with a mild reduction in gene expression (Figure S7), but most importantly, it also deletes the majority of the annotated domains in the NPNT protein (Table S7).",

Changes that accumulate and fix in inbred strains are (relatively) stable and are restricted to the strain in which they arise. In an outbred resource population, there will be a constant turnover of new variants, most often resulting in their loss from the population. However, in some cases, drift or selection could potentially lead to fixation of new variants with a consequent loss of standing variation in the outbred resource (Chesler et al. 2016; Didion et al. 2016) and affect genetic networks through altered interactions (Tyler et al. 2017). Monitoring of inbred vs. outbred genetic resource populations will require different approaches but is important for both ensuring the integrity of the resources and as an opportunity for new discoveries.",
