ALI incidence remains high, and it is associated with high rates of mortality and morbidity worldwide, especially in developing countries [3]. ALI is characterized by intense transepithelial leukocyte infiltration, exudate accumulation in the lungs, loss of integrity of the alveolar-capillary membrane, and tissue damage [4]. This response has been suggested to be due to the increased production of inflammatory mediators including cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6), especially by alveolar macrophages and neutrophils [5].",

Furthermore, Haseeb et al. showed that the pomegranate fruit extract attenuates IL-6 production, reactive oxygen species, IL-1\u03b2-mediated phosphorylation of the inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit beta (IKK\u03b2), expression of IKK\u03b2 mRNA, degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1, and the activation and nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB/p65 in human chondrocytes [9].",

Separation was performed using a Phenomenex Kinetex C-18 column (250 \u00d7 4.6 mm, 5 \u03bcm; Torrance, CA, USA). The column oven was maintained at room temperature. The HPLC was set up with an elution gradient as follows: 0\u20132 min, 5% B; 2\u201310 min, 5\u201325% B; 10\u201320 min, 25\u201340% B; 20\u201330 min, 40\u201350% B; 30\u201340 min, 50\u201360% B; and 40\u201350 min, 70\u2013100% B. Acetic acid (2%) in Milli-Q water was used as mobile phase A, and methanol was used as mobile phase B. The injection volume consisted of 25 \u03bcl of the reconstituted sample at 5 mg/ml, with a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. Detection was achieved in a diode array detector (DAD) at 200\u2013500 nm and with direct mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry, a method in negative electrospray (-ESI) mode with a detector voltage maintained at 4.0 kV, ion source at 40 V, and capillary temperature at 320\u00b0C. The nebulizing gas was nitrogen (N2) flowing at 7 ml/min, a sheath gas provided at a pressure of 27 psi, while helium was used as the collision gas. Analyses were carried out using full-scan mass spectra and data-dependent MS2 scans from m/z 100 to 2000. The compounds were identified on the basis of their molecular ion mass fragmentation. The obtained mass spectrum was compared with that of the literature.",

Four hours after the challenge, mice were culled by anesthetic overdose with ketamine (120 mg/kg, i.p.) and xylazine (10 mg/kg, i.p.), and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected. For this, the trachea of each mouse was cannulated and the alveoli were washed three times with 0.5 ml of ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.5% sodium citrate.

Animals with ALI exhibited an intense inflammatory cell influx surrounding the bronchi (Figure 2(b)). The same mice also presented multifocal areas of collagen deposition (Figure 3(b)) in comparison with those which received i.n. saline (Figure 3(a)). LPS-induced pathological changes were not affected by the pretreatment with EAFPg at 30 mg/kg. On the other hand, pretreatment with EAFPg at 100\u2013300 mg/kg markedly reduced the collagen deposition with leukocyte infiltration, with respect to LPS mice treated with vehicle (Figures 2(d), 2(e), 3(d), and 3(e)). Animals pretreated with dexamethasone also displayed attenuated lung inflammation (Figures 2(f) and 3(f)). In addition, EAFPg (100\u2013300 mg/kg) and dexamethasone markedly diminished the numbers of leukocytes in the bronchial area (12.0 \u00b1 1.0, 13.0 \u00b1 1.0, and 10.3 \u00b1 1.5 leukocytes/130 \u03bcm2, resp.)

Moreover, EAFPg (100\u2013300 mg/kg) and dexamethasone markedly reduced the bronchial (7.5% \u00b1 0.6%, 7.0% \u00b1 0.1%, and 6.7% \u00b1 0.3%, resp.; Figure 2(g)) and the alveolar parenchyma collagen deposition (3.7% \u00b1 0.5%, 3.3% \u00b1 0.7%, and 2.2% \u00b1 0.2%, resp.) when compared with that of the ALI control group (33.3% \u00b1 10.8% and 11.9% \u00b1 2.7%, resp.).",

Initially, the inflammation is provoked by lung-resident macrophages that activate intracellular mediators after interacting with pathogen-associated molecular patterns, such as LPS. It was not observed that increased migration of monocyte-derived macrophages to the lung suggested that 4 hours is not enough for its migration. Large amounts of cytokines were primarily produced and released by lung-resident macrophages in response to LPS [16]. Therefore, to further evaluate the effects of the EAFPg on lung inflammation, we measured the inflammatory markers TNF-\u03b1, IL1-\u03b2, and IL-6. We found that the pretreatment with EAFPg reduces the gene expression of these mediators in the lung tissue. TNF-\u03b1 protein levels were also attenuated in the same mice. Additionally, cytokine mRNA expression was potently attenuated in LPS-stimulated macrophages treated with EAFPg or kaempferol. It was previously demonstrated that the hydroalcoholic extract from pomegranate leaves reduces TNF-\u03b1 mRNA expression in peritoneal leukocytes obtained from rats with LPS-induced peritonitis [8].",
