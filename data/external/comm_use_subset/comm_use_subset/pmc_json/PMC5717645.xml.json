            "text": "Inflammation is the body's natural protective response to tissue injury caused by physical or chemical stimuli or invading microbial toxins. Prolonged inflammation can lead to chronic inflammatory diseases such as asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases and cancer [1\u20136]. Pro-inflammatory cells, mainly activated macrophages, produce inflammatory cytokines and other inflammatory mediators, including overproduction of nitric oxide (NO) during the process of inflammation [7]. Inflammation can be initiated and triggered by the stimulation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-1 (IL-1) or interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) [8,9]. After exposure to stimulants, the production of inflammatory cytokines and NO are increased in active macrophages [10]. Therefore, inhibition of NO production is a major target for anti-inflammatory drug discovery. Nonetheless, there are severe side-effects associated to current anti-inflammatory drugs and it is of the utmost importance to develop new anti-inflammatory compounds with less side-effects and different mechanisms of action.",

            "text": "Metal coordination complexes offer a versatile platform for the design of drugs with potential unique mechanisms of action. The large pool of metal-based drugs arises from the variety of metals, oxidation states and overall coordination geometry that can be used for their design [11\u201324]. The number and types of ligands have a strong influence on the activity of the synthesized metal complex. Although very ancient, the utilization of metal ions and metal complexes in medicine has been quite recently stimulated by the clinical success of cisplatin and other platinum(II) anticancer drugs, and by the utilization of gadolinium complexes as MRI contrast agents and 99 m-technetium radiopharmaceuticals for \u03b3-ray imaging. The large structural diversity of metal complexes is also an attractive platform for drug design for other diseases and conditions, including neurodegeneration, microbial and parasitic infections and inflammation [25\u201328]. We recently surveyed the significant number of clinical trials that involve metal compounds, both for therapy and for diagnosis [29]. In this context, it is clear that metal complexes have the potential to offer an alternative to anti-inflammatory organic drugs. The gold(I) complex auranofin was approved by the FDA in 1985 as an oral anti-arthritic agent. Although still not fully elucidated, [30] its mechanism of action is believed to involve the inhibition of cathepsin B [31]. Bismuth complexes are effective towards a number of diseases, such as syphilis, but the main use of bismuth in therapy is for the inhibition of Helicobacter pylori [32,33]. Helicobacter pylori is a bacterium that can prevent ulcers from healing [34]. Owing to the development of antibiotic drug resistance by H. pylori, triple and quadruple [35] regimens based on two antibiotics, an acid-suppressing agent, and bismuth salts are now being investigated for the treatment of this bacterium.",

            "text": "Half-sandwich metal complexes of ruthenium, osmium and iridium are a versatile family of organometallics [36\u201338]. Their biological properties have raised considerable expectations for the treatment of cancer since the beginning of the 2000s and are considered as a promising alternative to platinum-based chemotherapeutics [39\u201341]. We have recently developed a strong interest in the chemical and biological properties of electron-deficient half-sandwich complexes. In particular, the 16-electron (16-e) complexes based on the carborane ligand [Os(\u03b76-p-cymene)(1,2-dicarba-closo-dodecarborane-1,2-dithiolato)] (1), [Ru(\u03b76-p-cymene)(1,2-dicarba-closo-dodecarborane-1,2-dithiolato)] (2;\nfigure 1) have been shown to be highly active towards A2780 ovarian cancer cells [42,43]. Their benzene-dithiolato analogues [Os(\u03b76-p-cymene)(benzene-1,2-dithiolato)] (4), [Ru(\u03b76-p-cymene)(benzene-1,2-dithiolato)] (5, figure 1) have been recently been shown to exhibit very low reactivity with \u03c3-donor ligands in solution [44]. The lack of reactivity towards pyridine derivatives in particular was found to be related to the aromaticity of the five-membered MS2C2 chelate ring by involving sulfur lone pairs in the bonding in the MS2C2 chelate ring.\n",

In principle, low-spin d6 half-sandwich complexes [(arene)M(X)(Y)(Z)] (arene = benzene or cyclopentadienyl derivative, (M = Ru, Os or Ir) can be relatively inert towards substitution reactions and exert their anticancer activity by binding to target sites through outer-sphere interactions [63]. This inertness depends on the specific ligand sets. Inert octahedral metal complexes are emerging as promising scaffolds for targeting kinase active sites, [64] owing to their rigid and globular shapes, and high synthetic versatility [65]. Meggers and co-workers have demonstrated that specific RuII, [66] OsII, [67] RhIII, [68] and IrIII [69] complexes can serve as highly potent (micromolar to nanomolar range) and selective inhibitors of kinases. Osmium, the heavier congener of ruthenium and a third row transition metal, commonly exhibits slower kinetics than ruthenium, and is often considered to be relatively inert. However, it is possible to tune the biochemical reactivity of the arene OsII complexes through an understanding of their aqueous solution chemistry [63]. We previously reported that the Os complexes 1 and 4 are prompt to react with \u03c3-donor ligands [62]. Ruthenium half-sandwich complexes are usually more reactive than their osmium counterparts, and their activation via redox pathways or by ligand substitution can be finely controlled, offering activation only after the complex has reached its target [70].",

In this work, we illustrated such ability by studying the reactivity of complex 2 with NO, which we hypothesize as being the reason for their anti-inflammatory effects. The absence of cytotoxicity for the iridium complexes 3 and 6 may be due to a greater inertness and slower kinetics of Ir than Ru and Os analogues. This is in accordance with our recent study on the reactivity of complexes 4\u20136 towards \u03c3-donor and \u03c3-donor + \u03c0-acceptor ligands [44]. For example, complexes 5 and 6 are only present as the monomeric 16-e species in solution, while the less kinetically inert complex 4 is present as both 16-e monomeric and 18-e dimeric structures in solution. Therefore, the iridium complexes could react with NO (which is an excellent ligand owing to \u03c0-back bonding and steric considerations) but not with large biomolecules, while the more kinetically active Ru and Os analogues could react not only with NO but also with other targets (e.g. glutathione) leading to cytotoxicity.",

            "text": "One of the main reasons for the intensive research on the synthesis of arene-ruthenium based anticancer drug candidates is their amphiphilic properties provided by the hydrophobic arene ligand counterbalanced by the hydrophilic metal centre. Beyond non-classical bonding interactions [71], dicarba-closo-dodecarboranes possess unusual properties, including high symmetry, remarkable stability and high hydrophobicity. Dicarba-closo-dodecarboranes and dicarba-closo-dodecarborane derivatives have been used as pharmacophores to enhance the hydrophobic interactions of pharmaceutical compounds with oestrogen and retinoid receptors [72]. The hydrophobicity of complexes 1\u20133 is, therefore, expected to be much higher than the one of their benzene analogues. Remarkably, the cytotoxicity results of complexes 1\u20136 on both cell lines highlight a dramatic difference of activity between the two carborane-containing group VIII metal (Ru and Os) complexes 1 and 2 and the other metal complexes studied in this work. Complexes 1 and 2 show a concentration-dependent inhibition towards RAW 264.7 cells treated with LPS (1 \u00b5g ml\u22121), while the activity of the other metal complexes 3\u20136 was found to be concentration-independent. These same two complexes are the only compounds which exhibit a significant cytotoxicity effect on MRC-5 fibroblast cells treated with LPS. It seems clear that the main factor of activity in the two series of electron-deficient half-sandwich metal complexes, therefore, seems to be the role of the metal ion (because the Ir carborane complex 3 is non-cytotoxic despite incorporating the dicarba-closo-dodecarborane non-innocent ligand). The effect of the chelating ligand, although less pronounced than the influence of the nature of the metal ion, is nonetheless of importance, as exemplified by the dramatic difference of behaviour between the carborane- and benzene-containing Os and Ru complexes (1 versus 4, and 2 versus 5). Remarkably, the anti-inflammatory activity of the different complexes follows the same trends of structure\u2013activity relationship as the anti-proliferative one. Carborane- and benzene-containing Ru and Os complexes (1 versus 4, and 2 versus 5) show stark differences in their abilities to decrease the LPS-induced NO production. Finally, it should be noted that all complexes are neutral and have similar solubilities in the mixture 5 : 95 v : v DMSO : water used for the biological testing.",

Both iridium complexes, in addition to being non-cytotoxic, possess the ability to reduce the NO production to the level of the control assay (cells \u2018\u2212 \u2212\u2019, untreated with LPS and complex). This indicates that these two compounds are not toxic and offer a full anti-inflammation protection to the cells. Some differences of anti-inflammatory activity are noticeable depending on the cell types, particularly in terms of inhibition of LPS-induced NO production. Although all complexes displayed dose-dependent inhibitory effects on LPS-induced NO production on both cell lines, the compounds were found to have greater potential to inhibit NO production on MCR-5 cells regardless of the metal ions and ligands, than on RAW 264.7 cells, as evidenced by the molar concentration values (\u03bcM) giving 50% inhibition (IC50) relative to the control in table 1.\n",

The six metal complexes were shown to exhibit dose-dependent inhibitory effects on LPS-induced NO production on both cell lines. Remarkably, the two iridium complexes [Ir(\u03b75-pentamethylcyclopentadiene)(1,2-dicarba-closo-dodecarborane-1,2-dithiolato)] (3) and [Ir(\u03b75-pentamethylcyclopentadiene)(benzene-1,2-dithiolato)] (6) were found to be non-cytotoxic and to trigger a full anti-inflammatory response towards LPS-induced NO production. We hypothesize that the electron-deficient configuration at the metal centre allows binding of the ligand NO to the metal ion. The extent of such binding and its implication towards the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of action of complexes 1\u20136 will be investigated in future work. The anti-inflammatory effect of non-cytotoxic 16-e complexes has the potential to be useful in the treatment of severe infectious diseases which trigger inflammation and fibrosis at the end stage, like SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), [73] which is a fatal disease without effective antiviral agents available now. Another disease enduring similar pathologic changes is chronic liver infectious disease, like hepatitis C, which also has poor prognosis without proper treatment available. Therefore, the two iridium compounds have the potential to be useful in controlling the progression of these severe diseases; in comparison, cortisone has similar anti-inflammatory effect but causes side effects such as osteonecrosis of the femoral head at high dosage.",
