Three-week-old PRRSV-negative piglets weighing from 3.2 to 7.5 kg were randomly divided into five groups with 4 pigs in each group.

The I.N. inoculation was used as PRRSV transmits via respiratory route. The pigs in each group were euthanized on day 14 post infection (DPI14) by pentobarbital overdose (FATAL-PLUS, Vortech Pharmaceuticals, LTD. Dearborn, MI). Visible macroscopic lung lesions and histopathology were scored and recorded as previously described2930. The level of interstitial pneumonia was scored ranging from 0 (absent) to 6 (severe diffuse interstitial pneumonia). Scoring of macroscopic and microscopic lung pathology was done in a treatment status-blinded fashion independently by two veterinary pathologists (TO, PGH). If results disagreed, they were combined and the average was used for further analysis.",

The deletion likely occurred around passage 60 as there were both 719 and 1262 bp bands in the PCR of passage 60, but the 1262 bp band disappeared in passage 61. It appears that the virus with deletion grows faster and quickly became the main virus in passage 61. A2MC2-P90 propagates faster with higher yield in MARC-145 cells than the wild type A2MC2. Our results are consistent with an earlier report that the spontaneous nsp2 deletion contributes to the faster virus propagation in a different strain in vitro35. However, the nsp2 deletion does not have an effect on PRRSV virulence for that strain in vivo.",

Nsp9 and nsp10 were found to contribute to fatal virulence of high pathogenic PRRSV strains in China36. There are one and three different amino acid residues in nsp9 and nsp10, respectively, between A2MC2-P90 and the wild type virus (Table 1). Compared with moderate virulent VR-2332 and its derived avirulent MLV, these residues in the wild type A2MC2 are not unique (Supplemental Table 1), suggesting that their correlation with virulence is unlikely. There is no unique synonymous mutations in nsp9 and nsp10 in A2MC2-P90. It is thus unknown which nucleotide mutations contribute to the attenuation of A2MC2, possibly a combined effect of the multiple mutations has to be considered. Among the 35 nucleotide mutations of A2MC2-P90 in comparison with the wild type A2MC2, only nt13011 is the same as in the MLV but different from VR-2332, leading to serine in both A2MC2-P90 and the MLV, and glycine in strains A2MC2 and VR-2332. The significance of this one amino acid variation between both moderate virulent strains and their avirulent descendants is not known and may need to be investigated.",
