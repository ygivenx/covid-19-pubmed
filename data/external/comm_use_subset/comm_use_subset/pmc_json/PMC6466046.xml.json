The precursor protein GP0 is synthesized on the endoplasmic reticulum, and cleaved in the constitutive secretory pathway into the surface unit GP1, which binds to host cell factors, and the transmembrane unit GP2, which mediates fusion of viral envelopes with endosomal membranes. Filoviruses display a broad cell tropism [13]. Almost any cell type with the notable exception of lymphocytes is susceptible to infection by authentic filoviruses in vitro [14,15], or to transduction by retrovirus particles pseudotyped with GP [16,17]. Moreover, immortalized cell lines cultured in suspension are resistant to filovirus entry, while cell adhesion enhances susceptibility to infection [18,19]. Thus, the broad cell tropism observed in infected primates, where virus can be isolated from all organs but not from lymphocytes [14,20,21], is also recapitulated in vitro.",

            "text": "The availability of host factors on the cell surface that interact with viral envelope GP or with envelope lipids such as phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) often determines viral cell tropism. Such virus\u2013host interactions mediate virus attachment, and are a necessary prerequisite for virus internalization, viral fusion with host membranes, and viral genome release into the cytosol for transcription and replication [16,22,23]. Several plasma membrane proteins have been implicated in filovirus attachment: cellular lectins such as asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGR-R), dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN), liver/lymph node-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (L-SIGN), human macrophage C-type lectin specific for galactose and N-acetylglucosamine (hMGL), or liver and lymph node sinusoidal endothelial cell C-type lectin (LSECtin) [24,25,26,27,28], T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 1 and 4 (TIM-1, TIM-4) [29,30], members of the TAM family (Tyro3, Axl, Mer) of receptor tyrosine kinases [31], integrin \u03b1V\u03b21 [32,33], and scavenger receptor A. However, none of these factors seems to be essential for filoviral infection across cell lines. Rather, their role in cell entry is considered to be cell type dependent, and some of them may promote entry indirectly by regulating downstream processes such as macropinocytosis or GP proteolytic cleavage [34,35,36,37]. In contrast, several intracellular proteins are essential for filovirus infection in all cell types studied thus far. The endosomal and lysosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin B and cathepsin L cleave GP and thereby expose its receptor binding domain [38], and the two-pore channel 1 (TPC1) and two-pore channel 2 (TPC2) mediate endolysosomal Ca2+ efflux [39]. Finally, the endolysosomal cholesterol transporter Niemann\u2013Pick C1 (NPC1) [40,41] binds to processed GP1 [42].",

            "text": "The remarkable diversity of plasma membrane proteins implicated in filovirus cell entry prompted us to analyze twelve cell lines for a potential correlation of host factor expression to filovirus susceptibility. We could show that the neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line is specifically resistant to filovirus infection although all intracellular proteins known to be essential were expressed, and although its overall transcriptome was very similar to that of susceptible cell lines. Heterokaryon assays revealed that SH-SY5Y cells did not express a dominant restriction factor that inhibited filovirus GP-driven cell entry, but recombinant GP could not bind to their plasma membrane. By individual overexpression of a wide range of different filovirus attachment-promoting proteins, SH-SY5Y cells became susceptible to filovirus GP-driven transduction. Our findings demonstrate that filoviruses\u2014in contrast to many other viruses\u2014can highjack a diverse range of different plasma membrane proteins for the critical cell attachment step, which is a mandatory prerequisite for productive infection of any cell and thus any host.",

Particles bearing no GP did not result in any reporter expression, while VSV-G particles lead to strong luciferase activity in all cell lines. Susceptibility to filovirus GP-driven transduction was heterogeneous with the endothelial cell lines HPMEC and EA.hy926 being much more susceptible than the fibroblasts and epithelial cells, and the lymphocytic cell line Jurkat being resistant, as reported before [16]. Remarkably, the adherent, neuroblastoma cell lines SK-N-MC and SH-SY5Y [55,56] were also not susceptible to filovirus GP-mediated transduction.

At 72 h post infection (hpi), the cells were fixed for immunofluorescence microscopy (IF) studies (Figure 2A) or lysed for immunoblotting (Figure 2B), and probed with antibodies (pAbs) directed against the viral nucleoprotein (NP). The HEK293T and SK-N-BE(2)-C cells were susceptible to EBOV and MARV infection, while the SH-SY5Y cells were resistant to both (Figure 2A,B). Of note, tubulin was also degraded in the susceptible SK-N-BE(2)-C cells but not in the resistant SH-SY5Y upon inoculation, a sign of extensive infection previously observed in our lab. The SK-N-MC did not express any EBOV NP protein, but displayed sporadic MARV NP labelling in few cells. Therefore, we focused our further analyses on SH-SY5Y cells.",

For EBOV, we used GPs of 1976 Mayinga strain, 2014 Makona strain (WT), and the cell entry-enhancing Makona variant A82V [59,60]. VSV-Gpp served as positive control (Figure 3A).

While Huh-7.5 cells were susceptible to all pseudoparticles tested, Jurkat cells were effectively transduced only with VSV-Gpp. HEK293T cells were susceptible to all pseudoparticles with the exception of SARSpp, which could only transduce Huh-7.5 cells. LASVpp efficiently transduced epithelial Huh-7.5 and HEK293T cells. SH-SY5Y cells were susceptible not only to VSV-Gpp, but also to transduction driven by RABV-G and CHIKV E1-E3.

This combination allowed us to differentiate between heterokaryons of two different cell types expressing either the transactivator or its inducible counterpart from homokaryons derived from only one cell type. In the latter case, the inducible gene would not be activated, and hence there would be no reporter gene expression even in the presence of Dox (Figure S2). We engineered Huh-7.5 and SH-SY5Y cells to express transactivator proteins, and HEK293T-H6 cells to express the Tet-inducible ZsGreen1 reporter gene. We next assessed whether NoEnvpp, EBOVpp, MARVpp, or VSV-Gpp lentiviral particles expressing the mCherry reporter were able to transduce HEK293T-H6 cells, Huh-7.5 cells, SH-SY5Y cells, HEK293T-H6/Huh-7.5 heterokaryons, or HEK293T-H6/SH-SY5Y heterokaryons. The engineered cell lines exhibited the same susceptibility to GP-driven transduction as the respective parental cell lines (Figure 4B and Figure S3A). Moreover, heterokaryons of susceptible HEK293T and Huh-7.5 cells or of HEK293T and SH-SY5Y cells were susceptible to GP-driven transduction (Figure 4A,B and Figure S3B). Importantly, reporter expression depended on viral GPs, since NoEnvpp did not transduce heterokaryons. Taken together, heterokaryons from resistant and susceptible cells were transduced by pseudoparticles bearing filovirus GPs, suggesting that SH-SY5Y cells do not express a specific restriction factor but rather lack an important enabling filovirus entry factor, which is delivered to resistant cells by fusion with susceptible cells.",

Cathepsin L was expressed to a similar extend in all cell lines, while expression of procathepsin B (44 kDa) and the active cathepsin B isoforms (27 kDa and 24 kDa) varied among cell lines but did not correlate with susceptibility to filovirus infection (Figure 5A). For instance, SH-SY5Y cells expressed the 27 kDa active isoform at a level comparable to that of susceptible HPMEC cells. In addition, we measured substrate-specific cleavage activity of cathepsin B and cathepsin L in the cell lysates (Figure 5B), but the relative cleavage activities did not correlate with susceptibility to filovirus GP-driven transduction. Notably, the resistant SH-SY5Y cells showed cathepsin B and cathepsin L substrate-specific cleavage activity, suggesting that GP-processing can occur on this cell line. Finally, specific inhibition of cathepsin B/cathepsin L with FYdmk [64] confirmed that filovirus GP-driven transduction into susceptible cell lines required cathepsin B and cathepsin L activity as expected (Figure S4A).",

In untreated cells, cholesterol was distributed throughout the entire cells with the highest signal at the plasma membrane. In contrast and as reported before [66,67], cholesterol accumulated more in the cell center in U18666A treated cells, most likely in late endosomes and endolysosomes, indicating that these cells expressed functional NPC1. Finally, U18666A treatment inhibited filovirus GP-driven transduction of susceptible cells (Figure S4B), confirming that entry into these cells is NPC1 dependent.

To test whether TPC2 accounted for the resistance of SH-SY5Y cells to GP-driven transduction, susceptible HEK293T and resistant SH-SY5Y cells were treated with the inhibitor tetrandrine, which blocks TPC1/2 and results in epidermal growth factor (EGF) accumulation in LAMP-1 positive endosomes [39]. Both cell lines displayed larger and brighter organelles after drug treatment, indicating EGF accumulation and suggesting that also TPC1/2 were functional in SH-SY5Y cells. Finally, tetrandrine inhibited filovirus GP-driven transduction of all susceptible cell lines tested as expected (Figure S4C).",

We extracted total RNA from our panel of cell lines as well as from primary human hepatocytes (PHH) and quantified relative mRNA levels by microarrays. We used hierarchical clustering analyses to compare the respective gene expression profiles. Figure 6A represents an unbiased clustering analysis of all detected transcripts and Figure 6B depicts clustering of all filovirus cell surface or soluble extracellular entry factors described so far. The cell lines were grouped in two major clusters by an unbiased analysis (Figure 6A). This observation also hold true for the analysis considering only reported entry factors (Figure 6B), except that the Huh-7.5 cells were outside the cluster closest to PHH. Whereas one cluster contained most of the susceptible cell lines, the other enclosed all resistant cell lines, including SH-SY5Y, together with the susceptible HEK293T, SW13, and Huh-7.5 cell lines (unbiased analysis only). Thus, the gene expression profiles of the susceptible cell lines HEK293T and SW13 were more similar to resistant cell lines than to other susceptible lines. Moreover, neither the global gene expression profiles nor expression patterns of reported filovirus attachment factors correlated with susceptibility or resistance to filovirus GP-driven cell entry.",

Strikingly, ectopic expression of any of the four attachment protein tested was sufficient for robust transduction of SH-SY5Y cells by both, EBOVpp or MARVpp (Figure 8B), but not by NoEnvpp. As expected, NPC1 overexpression did not increase filovirus susceptibility, supporting the notion that filovirus attachment proteins had been missing. Among the ectopically expressed proteins, DC-SIGN increased EBOV GP-driven transduction by 364-fold as compared to SH-SY5Y WT. TIM-1, Axl, and Mer had a less potent yet significant effect on EBOV GP-mediated entry with fold change values of 66.7, 9, or 3.5, respectively. The transduction by MARVpp was stronger than by EBOVpp for both Axl (14.1) and Mer (10.2) tyrosine kinases, but not for TIM-1 (54.4).

These cells were not susceptible to EBOV-GP transduction or EBOV infection but supported a low level of MARV-GP transduction and MARV infection. This disparity might be due to different receptor usage among filoviruses, to different internalization mechanisms, or even indicate a host factor specifically required for EBOV but not for MARV [17]. On the other hand, SH-SY5Y cells, a thrice cloned subline of the neuroblastic SK-N-SH cell line [56,70], were highly resistant to both EBOV and MARV by all assays (Figure 1 and Figure 2). These cells are susceptible to chikungunya virus, dengue virus, varicella-zoster virus, and neurovirulent poliovirus [71,72,73,74]. Our study revealed that SH-SY5Y cells are also susceptible to transduction driven by the G protein of rabies virus (Figue2B). Together, these results suggest that the entry defect observed is largely filovirus specific.",

            "text": "According to the current model on filovirus cell entry, one or several proteins on the cell surface facilitate infection in addition to the essential intracellular endosomal proteins. At the plasma membrane, Ca2+-dependent carbohydrate binding C-type lectins interact with N-glycans attached to filoviral GP [75] and function as attachment factors [34]. Furthermore, members of the TAM (Tyro3, Axl, Mer) and TIM-1 PtdSer binding protein families enhance filovirus cell entry, TAMs likely by enhancing macropinocytosis [37] and TIM-1 by a process depending on GP or PtdSer [30,76]. Finally, the intracellular proteins cathepsin B and cathepsin L, TPC1 and TPC2, and the bona fide receptor NPC1 are essential for productive filovirus infection in vitro and in vivo [38,40,41]. Our panel of cell lines was largely lacking expression of lectins at the mRNA level with the exception of ASGR1 and ASGR2, which were expressed on Huh-7.5 cells, as reported previously [28]. The absence of expression of other entry promoting lectins is in line with the tissue distribution of DC-SIGN, hMGL (dendritic cells and macrophages), L-SIGN, and LSEctin (endothelial cells of the liver and lymph nodes) [24,25,27]. Therefore, although lectins might contribute to the cell tropism of filoviruses [20], clearly they are not essential for filovirus infection. In line with previous studies [30,31,36,68,77], TAM and TIM-1 mRNA expression was heterogeneous among the cell lines studied here, suggesting that they are not essential but may facilitate filovirus attachment and internalization. Indeed, studies on the role of Axl in filovirus cell entry have shown a cell-type-specific effect with antibodies against Axl reducing Axl-dependent filoviral GP-driven transduction in some Axl-positive cell lines but not in others [77]. Similarly, overexpression of DC-SIGN but not of TIM-1 renders Jurkat cells susceptible to filovirus virus-like particles (VLP) [76] and infection studies with TIM-1-/- mice also suggest a dispensable role of TIM-1 since EBOV viral loads are similar in KO and WT mice [78]. Our data clearly demonstrate that TIM-1, Axl, Mer, and DC-SIGN have important yet redundant roles during filovirus entry. This is in line with published studies supporting the function of C-type lectins, TAM tyrosine kinases, and TIM proteins in cell entry [23,24,27,30,31,69,79,80,81]. Prospective further attachment factor protein expression profiling among susceptible and resistant cell lines could provide even a clearer picture on the cellular requirements for productive filovirus cell entry. In sum, expression of TIM-1, Axl, Mer, or DC-SIGN is an important determinant of susceptibility to filoviruses.",

            "text": "The disparity between susceptibility to infection and surface protein expression could be attributed to different reasons. First, resistant cell lines might express a dominant restriction factor that blocks productive internalization or viral fusion (reviewed in [61]). However, this was not the case for the SH-SY5Y cells reported here, as heterokaryons of susceptible HEK293T-H6 and SH-SY5Y cells were also susceptible to filovirus GP-driven transduction. Second, filoviruses might rely on different cofactors in different cell types. In Jurkat cells, this might be conceivable. An overexpression of DC-SIGN but not of TIM-1 renders otherwise resistant Jurkat cells susceptible to EBOV-GP virus-like particles [76]. Moreover, EBOV virions bind to resistant Jurkat and activated CD4+ T-cells in a TIM-1 dependent-manner without productive infection [78]. However, ectopic expression of Axl, an inhibitor of the type I interferon signaling [69], renders Jurkat cells susceptible. This suggests that Jurkat cells might be able to resist filovirus infection because they have an intrinsic antiviral innate immune mechanism activated. This hypothesis could be tested in the future by determining whether heterokaryons of resistant Jurkats with susceptible cells will be susceptible or resistant to filovirus infection. In SH-SY5Y cells, however, an ectopic expression of any potential attachment-promoting plasma membrane protein of filoviruses, such as DC-SIGN, Axl, Mer, or TIM-1, conferred susceptibility to filovirus GP-driven transduction or infection. Interestingly, the enabling potency was different among attachment factors. These differences may be related to the mechanism by which the attachment factors promote susceptibility in SH-SY5Y cells. For instance, TAM receptors may confer susceptibility by enhancing micropinocytosis, whereas TIM-1 or DC-SIGN could bind to the virus GP [26,30,77]. Further mechanistic studies on the role of the studied attachment factors could shed light on the differences observed in GP-mediated filovirus susceptibility in SH-SY5Y cells. Nevertheless, these data highlight the concept that virus\u2013receptor interactions at the cell surface are required for productive entry but several alternative host cell factors can be utilized. To our knowledge, this is the first study which directly shows that several unrelated proteins can be utilized alternatively to initiate filoviral cell entry in one cellular context. These findings may help to explain the broad cell tropism of filoviruses.",

This lack of susceptibility could be circumvented by expression of any one of several unrelated cell surface proteins that had previously been implicated in filoviral cell entry using other cellular backgrounds and experimental settings. We thus provide the most direct experimental evidence to support the current model of filoviral cell entry with alternative unspecific interactions between filoviral particles and plasma membrane host proteins mediating attachment and subsequent infection of target cells. Moreover, the filovirus-specific resistance of SH-SY5Y cells makes this cell line an interesting new tool for studying filoviral cell entry and for potentially identifying new cellular factors in the filoviral entry puzzle.",
