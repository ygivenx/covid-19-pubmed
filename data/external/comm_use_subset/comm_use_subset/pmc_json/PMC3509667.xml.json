The single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of IBV is approximately 27 kb and consists of genes coding RNA polymerase/transcriptase, spike protein (S), nonstructural proteins 3a and 3b, proteins E and M, nonstructural proteins 5a and 5b, and nucleocapsid protein (N) [1]. The spike protein is a protective glycoprotein on the virus envelope surface and a determinant of IBV serotype. The spike protein is proteolytically cleaved into S1 and S2. S1 is hypervariable and plays a role in receptor binding, whereas the more conserved S2 functions during fusion of the virus envelope and host cell membrane. The large RNA genome size permits many possibilities of mutations and recombinations which are important mechanisms of viral variation and diversity [2].",

The protective efficacy of a vaccine is dependent on its antigenicity and immunogenicity, and heterologous protection efficacy varies. Virus recovery rates from the trachea, kidney, and/or oviduct in vaccine efficacy tests and the mortality of birds challenged with nephrogenic IBV strain or IBV and E. coli coinfection have often been used as immunity criteria [12,13,14]. Although the absence of hierarchal ovarian follicles after experimental IBV infection in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) hens and retardation of laying on layer farms have been reported, experimental data describing the gross lesions of ovarian follicles are insufficient [15].",

Furthermore, continuous isolation of K-I type viruses in the field, even since the popularization of inactivated oil-emulsion vaccination, raise questions about the protective efficacy of commercial vaccines against K-I type viruses. Therefore, in the present study, we performed comparative genomics of SNU8067 (identified here as a K-I type virus) and KM91, and an animal model to test the pathogenicity of SNU8067 to the reproductive organs was established by challenge with SNU8067 in 16-week-old (w-o) specific\u2011pathogen-free (SPF) hens. The animal experiment was applied to a vaccine efficacy test by challenging SPF hens which had been vaccinated at 13-w-o. We evaluated vaccine efficacy based on a reduction in the number of gross lesions in the ovarian follicles and oviduct.",

Approximately 70% of the vaccinated chickens were sero-positive for IBV at 3-week-post vaccination, but all chickens in the unvaccinated control group were negative by ELISA. The challenge with SNU8067 (106 EID50/100 \u00b5L/chicken via ocular route) caused moderate to severe retarded development of hierarchal ovarian follicles in 80% of unvaccinated control chickens and moderate to marked retardation of oviduct maturation in 50% of unvaccinated control chickens. In contrast, only 30% of vaccinated chickens showed moderate to markedly retarded formation of hierarchal ovarian follicles and moderate retardation of oviduct maturation (Table 3; Figure 3). The IBV-specific antibody was detected at 5-weeks post-challenge in the control group and increased in the vaccinated group (Figure 4). The levels of antibody titers between the control and vaccinated groups after vaccination and challenge were significantly different (P < 0.05).",

            "text": "Since the first isolation of an IBV in 1980 in Korea, IBVs have caused economic losses due to egg\u2011drop and mortality by nephritis, and the genetic pool of field IBVs has diversified due to the introduction of new viruses from other countries and recombinations between domestic and newly introduced viruses [9,24,25,26,27]. The continuous isolation of K-I type viruses for several years following nationwide inoculation of commercial vaccines composed of KM91 and M41 encouraged studies to understand the genetic backgrounds of evolution and antigenicity of the K-I type viruses and to test vaccine efficacy of commercial vaccines against the K-I type virus in Korea. The results of comparative genomics in this study revealed relatively high nucleotide and amino acid identities between SNU8067 and KM91 strains in most genes except for those encoding S1, 3a, and 3b. The S1 protein is the most important protective antigen in IBVs, and the acquisition of a new SN8067 S1 gene by recombination with an unknown field virus might be the result of virus selection from humoral immunity pressure induced by KM91 type viruses [28]. The S1 amino acid sequence of SNU8067 was different from those of KM91 and M41 by 23% and 24%, respectively, and it may be a different serotype from KM91 and M41 [29]. However, the cross protection of the vaccine containing KM91 and M41 against SNU8067 infection might have occurred because the recombined S1 of SNU8067 was insufficient to evade antibodies induced by KM91 and M41, or that the relatively high identities of the S2 and N proteins conferred cross-protection ability on the vaccine to some extent [30,31,32]. Some IBV serotypes have high amino acid identities with each other and only small portions of S1 proteins form protective epitopes [30,33]. A study on the monoclonal antibody-resistant IBV variants revealed 6 epitopes (D, 24-60; E, 132-149; C/A/B, 291-398; F, 497-543) in S1 and 1 epitope in S2 (G, 548-574) [30].Considering the similar amino acid sequences of SNU8067 epitopes F in S1 and G in S2 to those of KM91 and the decreased isolation frequency of K-I type viruses in the field, SNU8067 might share similar protective epitopes with KM91. The commercial vaccine is successful at diminishing K-I type viruses with the S gene structure of SNU8067. The recombination site between 20,366 and 21,049 of the KM91 genome contained 226 N-terminal amino acids of the S1 protein and was significantly related to the LX4 strain in China. Epitope D and F are present in the region [30]. KM91 was isolated in 1991, is highly nephropathogenic, and causes high mortality in chicks but has been distinguished from previous Korean IBV isolates [34]. Therefore, we could speculate that the KM91-like viruses in Korea might have originated from China where IBVs exchanged their S1 gene fragments to survive under antibody pressure. However, to demonstrate it further study is required.",

            "text": "The 3a, 3b, 5a, and 5b proteins are nonstructural and are unnecessary for virus replication in cell culture and ECEs [35,36]. However, the titers of mutant viruses defective in some of these proteins decline earlier than those of wild type virus in trachea organ cultures. Thus, their function was postulated to be inhibition of innate immunity [35,36,37]. The selective acquisition of new SNU8067 3a and 3b proteins from an unknown virus with retention of the KM91-like virus S2 in the vicinity reflects their biological importance. In addition to the S1, 3a, and 3b genes, 5b showed lower amino acid identities than nucleotide identities, indicating that non-synonymous nucleotide changes causing amino acid changes might occur. Similarly, this protein pattern has been observed in proteins that play roles in host adaptation and evasion of host immune response [37,38]. Therefore, further studies are necessary to reveal the biological functions of 3a, 3b, and 5b. To date, recombination analyses have only focused on the S1 gene but ours and other comparative genomics studies have revealed multiple recombination sites (S2, 3a, and 3b) in IBV genomes [11,39,40,41]. Therefore, further studies on the recombinations of multiple genes, including S1, S2, 3a, 3b, and 5b may shed light on the evolution of IBV and its pathogenicity under host immunity.",

IBV infections in 1-day-old chicks cause permanent lesions resulting in reduced egg production and egg-drop and abnormal eggs with rough, deformed and soft shells, and watery albumen in laying hens [42]. As described in this study, the SNU8067 infection in 16-week-old SPF hens inhibited formation of hierarchal ovarian follicles in 80% of hens and oviduct maturation in 50% of hens in the control group, suggesting that ovarian follicles are more susceptible than the oviduct, and that IBV infection could reduce egg production by affecting ovarian follicle development [15]. Based on the relatively high frequency of lesions and the significant protection rate in the vaccinated group it can be concluded that the ovarian follicle protection model was valuable to test pathogenicity of the IBV strains and the protection efficacy of IB vaccines. The protection rate (70%) of vaccinated hens against ovarian follicle lesions was not high enough but it might be related to the reported innate limitations of inactivated oil-emulsion vaccines in SPF chickens without priming [43]. The correlation of a positive rate as detected by ELISA and the protection rate of ovarian follicles supports application of an ELISA to monitor the protective antibody in the field.",
