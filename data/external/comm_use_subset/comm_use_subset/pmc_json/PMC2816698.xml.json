            "text": "West Nile virus (WNV) is a neurotropic flavivirus and is an emerging public health threat. Infection with WNV now constitutes the leading cause of mosquito-borne and epidemic encephalitis in humans in the United States [1]. WNV is enveloped and contains a single strand positive sense RNA genome of approximately 11 kb in length that encodes three structural (C, prM/M, and E) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5). It cycles enzootically between birds and Culex mosquitoes, with humans infected as dead-end hosts. WNV infection has been modeled in inbred mice wherein infection and pathogenesis recapitulate many of the features of human infection (reviewed in [2]). Following subcutaneous inoculation, WNV replicates in dendritic cells (DCs) at the portal of entry and in the draining lymph node. A primary viremia develops and virus spreads to visceral organs including the spleen, where further amplification occurs, leading to central nervous system (CNS) dissemination and encephalitis. In humans, WNV causes an acute febrile illness that can progress to severe and sometimes lethal neuroinvasive disease, especially in the elderly and immunocompromised [3]. However, healthy young adults are also afflicted with severe neurological disease [4],[5],[6], indicating that virulence can occur independently of immune deficiencies or aging.",

Innate antiviral immune defenses are triggered through the recognition of conserved pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP) motifs within viral products by intracellular pathogen recognition receptor (PRR) proteins in infected cells. PRR signaling directs downstream activation of latent transcription factors, including NF-\u03baB, interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3 and IRF-7, in a cell type-specific manner to induce antiviral response programs that include expression of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, type I IFN, and interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) [7],[8],[9],[10]. The ISG products induced through autocrine and paracrine actions of IFN confer antiviral activity by limiting virus replication and cell-to-cell virus spread. Modulation of IFN signaling has been identified as a virulence feature of pathogenic strains of WNV [11],[12].",

            "text": "The RLRs, retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation antigen 5 (MDA5) [13],[14],[15],[16], are PRRs that play critical roles in triggering immune defenses against RNA virus infection, including WNV. RIG-I and MDA5 are cytosolic RNA helicases that contain an amino terminal tandem caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD). Upon engaging RNA substrates, the RLRs undergo a conformational change and bind to the mitochondrial associated protein, interferon promoter stimulator-1 (IPS-1) through a CARD-CARD interaction, leading to IPS-1-dependent signaling of IFN production and expression of immune response genes [17],[18]. RLR signaling and IPS-1 function have an essential role in triggering IFN defenses during WNV infection of mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) and human cell lines in vitro. Cells lacking either RIG-I or MDA5 were attenuated in their ability to generate an effective innate immune response to infection, whereas cells lacking both RIG-I and MDA5 or those deficient in IPS-1 alone were unable to respond to infection with WNV and related flaviviruses [19],[20],[21],[22]. Recent studies examined the role of another class of pattern recognition receptors, Toll like receptor (TLR)3 and TLR7, and show that these receptors are also important PRRs of WNV infection, as they play a role in signaling IFN production and an inflammatory response upon viral ligand recognition [23],[24],[25]. TLR3 has been shown to contribute to both enhancement and protection of CNS inflammation and neurovirulence of WNV in vivo\n[23],[24], while TLR7-dependent signaling was shown to be essential for directing proper immune cell homing to sites of WNV infection during the adaptive immune response in vivo\n[25].",

However, the specific PRR pathways that mediate this during acute WNV infection have not been delineated nor has the RLR pathway been evaluated in this context. The quantity and quality of the innate and adaptive immune responses after infection must be carefully regulated to avoid aberrant inflammation and immunopathogenesis. Regulatory T (Treg) cells and inflammatory dendritic cell (DC) subsets regulate inflammation during acute virus infection through T cell suppression and by modulating the trafficking and inflammatory cytokine production of immune cells into infected tissues [26],[27],[28]. Thus, the level of local and peripheral Treg cells, and the composition of local DC subsets that develop during WNV infection may determine immune control and WNV disease.",

IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited increased viremia compared to wild type mice (45.7 fold enhancement at day 1 pi, P<0.05) throughout the course of infection (\nFig 1B\n).

WNV infection of IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 mice displayed an expanded tissue tropism as infectious virus was found in the kidneys, a tissue that is not normally permissive to infection in wild type mice (\nFig 1D\n). WNV is typically detected in the CNS of wild type mice after s.c. challenge between 4 and 8 days pi [2]. Consistent with this time course, infected wild type mice exhibited detectable viral loads (average viral titer of 101.8 pfu/gram of tissue) in the brain by day 6 p.i., although virus was not detected in the spinal cord (\nFig 1E and F\n). In contrast, WNV spread to the brain (\nFig 1E\n) and spinal cord of IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 mice (\nFig 1F\n) by day 2 pi, with viral loads rising through day 6 pi. Together these results indicate that IPS-1, likely through RLR signaling of innate immune defenses, limits WNV replication, viremia, and peripheral spread, and is essential for the control of viral invasion of the CNS.",

To define the role of IPS-1 in controlling virus replication and innate immunity in myeloid cells, we analyzed WNV infection and host responses in primary bone marrow-derived DC and M\u03c6 recovered from wild type and IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 mice. DC and M\u03c6 were infected at an MOI of 1.0 (relative to viral plaque assay quantification of BHK-21 cells; see Methods) and evaluated for virus replication, IFN induction, and innate immune triggering of ISG expression (\nFig 2\n). IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 DCs sustained significantly higher WNV replication at 36 and 48 hours pi compared to wild type infected cells (\nFig 2A\n). WNV infection of wild type DCs induced IFN-\u03b2 secretion but this response was completely abolished in IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 DCs (\nFig 2B\n). The lack of IFN-\u03b2 induction in IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 DCs correlated with a lack of ISG expression including RIG-I, MDA5, and STAT-1 (\nFig 2C\n). In addition, expression of ISG54 and ISG49, which are direct IRF-3 target genes [30],[31], were not induced during WNV infection of IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 DCs (\nFig 2C\n). Moreover, ISG56, another IRF-3 target gene [31], was induced late during infection and to lower levels as compared to ISG54 and ISG49 in wild type, infected DCs. WNV infection of IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 M\u03c6 resulted in significantly higher virus replication between 24 and 48 hours pi as compared to infected wild type cells (\nFig 2D\n). Whereas wild type infected M\u03c6 expressed IFN-\u03b2, this response was completely abolished in IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 M\u03c6 (\nFig 2F\n). We also observed a differential expression of ISGs and IRF-3-target genes within WNV-infected M\u03c6. RIG-I, MDA5, and STAT-1 were not induced in IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 M\u03c6, whereas, ISG56, ISG49, and PKR were expressed at reduced levels and with delayed kinetics. These data establish that IPS-1-dependent RLR signaling is the major innate immune signaling pathway that controls virus replication in conventional DCs and M\u03c6.",

To define the role of RLR signaling in restricting virus replication in neurons, primary cortical neurons were generated from wild type and IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 mice. Cells were infected at an MOI of 1.0 with WN-TX and virus yield, IFN-\u03b2 induction, and ISG expression were evaluated. In the absence of IPS-1, WNV replicated faster and to higher levels resulting in a 2.2 and 4.2-fold (p<0.05) increase in viral production at 24 hrs and 48 pi, respectively as compared to infected wild type neuronal cells (\nFig 3A\n). This relatively modest virologic effect in neurons compared to that observed in IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 DC and M\u03c6 was expected, as IFN-\u03b1 or -\u03b2 pre-treatment only inhibits WNV infection in cortical neurons to a maximum of 5 to 8-fold [12], suggesting that the IFN response is comparably less potent in neurons. IFN-\u03b2 expression was induced to lower levels in IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 neurons compared to wild type infected neurons at 24 (10-fold, p<0.05) and 36 hours pi (5-fold, p<0.05) despite the higher levels of virus replication (\nFig 3A and 3B\n). Expression of ISGs, (including RIG-I and MDA5) and IRF-3 target genes (including ISG56 and ISG49) followed this pattern and were dependent on IPS-1 for rapid and high level expression (\nFig 3C\n). The presence of IFN-\u03b2 and ISG transcripts in IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 cells at 48 hrs pi is consistent with the finding that TLR3 has an independent and subordinate role in triggering innate immune responses in cortical neurons at later time points after WNV infection [23]. These results demonstrate that the RLR signaling pathway controls virus replication and induces innate immune responses against WNV infection in cortical neurons.",

In contrast, brain sections from infected IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 mice recovered on day 6 pi displayed extensive injury to neurons in the cortex and granular neurons of the hippocampus. Damaged neurons appeared pyknotic with vacuolation, degeneration and cell dropout. Somewhat surprisingly, we observed extensive inflammation in the brains from infected IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 mice within the cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum (data not shown) displaying prominent perivascular and parenchymal immune cell infiltrates.",

Brains from IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 infected mice showed an 2.9-fold increase in the total number of immune cells as compared to wild type infected mice (\nFig 4B\n), and this was associated with an increase in absolute numbers of infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (\nFig 4C\n). Among the brain CD8+ T cells isolated from IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 mice, there was a remarkable 27-fold increase in the number of antigen-specific cells that expressed IFN-\u03b3 after treatment with an immundominant NS4B peptide (\nFig 4D\n) [35],[36]. Analysis of microglia/M\u03c6 cells, based on relative surface expression of CD45 and CD11b [37], revealed increased numbers of microglial cells (CD45+lo/CD11b+) and infiltrating macrophages (CD45+hi/CD11b+) within the brains of infected IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 mice when compared to wild type mice (\nFig 4E\n). Similar findings were observed in the spinal cords from infected IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 mice (data not shown). Combined with the histological analysis, these results demonstrate that in the absence of IPS-1, WNV infection induces a strong inflammatory response in the CNS. While this response is likely associated with increased viral loads, the failure of this increased inflammatory response to elicit protection or control CNS pathology, in the absence of IPS-1, suggests a role for the RLR signaling pathway as a regulatory program that controls the quality of the inflammatory response to WNV infection.",

Paradoxically, a trend towards more rapid induction and increased levels of type I IFN were observed in the serum of IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 mice compared to wild type mice (\nFig 5A\n). We note that in this case type I IFN was detected and quantified through a mouse-specific type I IFN bioassay, which does not differentiate between the IFN-\u03b1 or -\u03b2 species. This result is consistent with our recent studies showing that serum type I IFN levels accumulate during WNV infection in an IRF-7-dependent but IRF-3-independent manner [8],[9]. In this case IFN-\u03b1 species are likely accumulating through a TLR7-dependent signaling pathway involving plasmacytoid DCs, which do not require the RLR pathway for IFN production [38]. More recently, Town et al. assessed the role of TLR7 and MyD88\u2212/\u2212 during WNV infection and found that mice lacking MyD88 produced elevated levels of systemic IFN during WNV infection [25]. Thus, during WNV infection systemic IFN is regulated through RLR-dependent and independent processes. Correspondingly, when compared to wild type mice, IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 infected animals, which show higher viremia (\nFig 1B\n) produced increased serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in response to WNV infection. Elevated levels of systemic IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, CXCL10, and IFN-\u03b3 were observed at 1 and/or 4 days pi in IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 mice (\nFig 5B\n). Serum cytokine levels were also compared between uninfected wild type and IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 mice and showed no differences in basal cytokine expression (data not shown). These results demonstrate that in the absence of IPS-1, greater proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses are induced during WNV infection.",

            "text": "WNV-specific antibody responses are essential for suppressing viremia and virus dissemination and limiting lethal WNV infection [39],[40]. To determine if a deficiency in IPS-1 modulated the quality and quantity of the humoral immune response, we characterized the antibody profile in sera during WNV infection. In wild type mice, neutralizing virus-specific IgM antibodies are typically detectable by day 4 pi with WNV and production of neutralizing virus-specific IgG antibodies follow between days 6 and 8 pi [40]. A time course analysis in wild type and IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 infected mice showed that between 4 and 6 days pi, WNV-infected IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited significantly higher levels of virus-specific IgM, IgG, and IgG subclasses as compared to infected wild type mice (\nTable 1\n). WNV-specific IgG1 antibodies were detected at low levels on day 6 pi in sera from wild type and IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 mice. Additionally, we observed a \u223c72.9-fold increase in WNV-specific IgG2a levels in infected IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 as compared to wild type mice on day 6 pi and \u223c2.2-fold increase on day 8 pi. Assessment of the virus-specific antibody responses through a PRNT assay revealed that neutralization titers in sera from wild type mice increased dramatically between 6 and 8 days pi. Sera from IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 infected mice exhibited a modest increase in neutralization titer to 1\u22361280, despite having much higher levels of virus-specific antibodies. This difference translated into a serum neutralization index that was \u223c39-fold lower on day 6 pi in the infected IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 mice compared to wild type mice. These results demonstrate that the humoral responses in WNV-infected IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 mice are distinct from responses in wild type infected mice. Thus, RLR signaling and IPS-1 actions likely contribute to regulatory processes that govern the levels, IgG class switching, and neutralizing capacity of antibodies generated in response to WNV infection.",

Wild type and IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 mice were challenged with diluent alone or with WN-TX, and draining popliteal lymph node (DLN) and the spleen were harvested at 1 and 6 days pi, respectively. Analysis of the popliteal DLN provides insight into how IPS-1 modulates the inflammatory response immediately after infection whereas assessment of the spleen elucidates characteristics of the adaptive immune response prior to the infection endpoint. Immune cells were isolated from the popliteal DLN and were characterized by flow cytometry (\nFig 6\n). Analysis of CD8\u03b1 DC subsets, which are phenotypically the major antigen presenting cells within lymphoid tissues and are implicated in eliciting virus-specific CD8 T cell in response to acute WNV infection [41], showed that infected wild type and IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited similar increases in the numbers of CD8\u03b1+ and CD8\u03b1\u2212 DCs compared to mock-infected mice (\nFig 6A, B\n). However, a significant increase (\u223c3-fold; p<0.05) of a proinflammatory DC subset, characterized as CD11c+CD11bhiLy6C+, was observed within the popliteal DLNs of IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 infected mice (\nFig 6C\n). This DC subset is monocyte-derived and typically recruited to sites of acute inflammation where they propagate the inflammatory response [42]. We found that these DC subsets were not significantly expanded and showed no differences in their recruitment to the DLN in either wild type or IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 infected mice at 12 hours pi (data now shown). Thus, as early as 24 hours pi, an elevated cellular inflammatory response is initiated in the IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 mice. In contrast, similar increases in plasmacytoid DCs were observed within infected wild type and IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 infected mice (\nFig 6D\n), demonstrating that an absence of IPS-1 did not directly affect expansion and/or recruitment of this DC subset. Within the popliteal DLNs, mock-infected IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 mice compared to wild type mice generally showed elevated numbers of B cells, CD4+ T cells (p<0.05), and CD8+ T cells (\nFig 6E, F, and G\n). These results suggest that IPS-1 contributes to the homeostasis of lymphocyte populations within LNs. WNV infection of wild type mice increased the number of B cells (3.4 fold), CD4+ T cells (3.1 fold), and CD8+ T cells (2.3 fold; p<0.05) in the DLN within 24 hours pi. Similar increases in B cells were observed upon infection of IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 mice. However, the number of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was reduced in the DLN after WNV infection of IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 mice. Thus, in the absence of IPS-1, WNV infection specifically increases the number of inflammatory Ly6c+ DCs but suppresses the overall expansion and/or recruitment of T cells in the DLN.",

Moreover, a reduction in the number of circulating Treg in mice leads to enhanced lethality after WNV infection [45]. A time course analysis of Tregs in wild type mice revealed that WNV infection results in a significant increase in the numbers of FoxP3+ T cells as compared to mock-infected mice beginning on day 4 and peaking by day 6 pi (\nFig 7C\n), indicating the expansion of Tregs during acute WNV infection. Despite their marked increase in viral load, the infected IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 mice did not display an increase in the numbers of FoxP3+ T cells at any timepoint analyzed. Thus, IPS-1 signaling directly or indirectly impacts Treg proliferation and does so independently of viral load.",

Our studies indicate that IPS-1-dependent RLR signaling functions to establish balanced, effective, and protective innate and adaptive immune responses, and that IPS-1 links adaptive immune regulation with the innate immunity triggered by RLR signaling during WNV infection. In the absence of IPS-1 in vitro, innate immune defense programs of myeloid DCs and macrophages were ablated or severely attenuated. Moreover, in vivo analysis of infected IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 mice showed altered IgG and IgM antibody responses with diminished virus neutralization activity. The inflammatory response to WNV infection is regulated by IPS-1-dependent processes such that a deficiency of IPS-1 resulted in elevated proinflammatory cytokine and chemokines and increased numbers of inflammatory DCs, antigen-specific T cells, natural killer cells, and neutrophils in lymphoid organs, and activated macrophage/microglial cells within the CNS. The dysregulated inflammatory response to WNV infection in IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 mice was associated with a reduction in the numbers of Treg cells and their failure to expand during acute infection. These observations demonstrate the critical role of IPS-1 in mediating RLR signaling of innate antiviral immunity against WNV infection, and reveal novel features of IPS-1 function in regulating immune homeostasis, inflammation, and adaptive immunity to infection.",

This finding agrees with previous studies that indicate both IPS-1-dependent and -independent pathways contribute to the systemic type I IFN production in vivo\n[8],[9],[23],[25]. Most importantly, the enhanced tissue tropism and rapid viral entry into the CNS observed in the IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 mice is not affected by the elevated systemic IFN responses. This suggests that local tissue-specific and intracellular responses triggered by RLR-dependent signaling are more essential for reducing viral burden and dissemination. One possible explanation is that a distinct set of RLR-responsive genes function to control virus replication at the site of infection. This could explain, in part, the elevated levels of virus replication, enhanced tissue tropism and cell-to-cell spread in mice or cells deficient in IRF3 or IRF-7, each of which are downstream transcription factors of RLR signaling [8],[9],[10]. Additionally, it is likely that pDCs, which are specialized dendritic cells for producing systemic type I IFN during a viral infection [46], are likely contributing to the IFN responses observed during WNV infection. Studies by Silva et al. have shown that WNV triggers IFN induction in pDCs through a replication-independent manner [47]. Interestingly, within the DLN, we observed similar expansion of pDCs between wild type and IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 infected mice, yet at the same timepoint (24 hours pi), elevated systemic type I IFN responses were observed in IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 mice. This suggests two possibilities: 1) splenic pDCs or circulating pDCs are likely responding to the high levels virus in the serum from the IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 infected mice to produce IFN at 24 hours pi and/or 2) various other cell types that express TLR3 and/or TLR7 are responding to WNV infection and contributing to systemic IFN responses. Taken together, these studies indicate that RLR signaling and the actions of IRF-3/7 are important in triggering IFN production and ISG expression to limit WNV replication and spread, and that TLR signaling may impart additional, RLR-independent defenses that regulate immunity against WNV infection.",

            "text": "The production of and response to type-I IFN is a major linkage point between innate and adaptive immunity, as IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 sustain B cell activation and differentiation [48],[49],[50], expand antigen-specific CD8+ T cells [51],[52], CD4+ T cells [53], and activation of NK cells [54]. One of the most intriguing aspects of this study was the global alteration of the immune response elicited in the IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 mice, indicating that RLR signaling couples innate immunity with regulation of the adaptive immune response. Infection of IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited increased IgM and IgG WNV-specific antibodies, enhanced WNV-specific CD8+T cell response, and increased expansion of neutrophils, NK cells and NK-T cells. One trivial explanation for these differences is that there is an increased antigen load in the absence of IPS-1 and, as a result, enhanced virus-specific (e.g. CD8+ T cells, IgG and IgM antibodies) and nonspecific (e.g. Neutrophils, NK cells) responses. However, there are several key findings from this study that argue against these responses simply being attributed to higher antigen load: (1) In the absence of IPS-1, the CD4 and CD8 T cells, which are protective against WNV infection [34],[35],[36],[55],[56],[57],[58], were significantly enhanced in the peripheral and CNS compartments but failed protect against infection. One explanation for this observation is that the expansion and migration of CD4 and CD8 T cells to different tissues was itself uncontrolled, resulting in T cell-mediated pathology rather than T cell-mediated protection. (2) While the quantity of virus-specific IgM and IgG antibody responses were greatly enhanced in the absence of IPS-1, there was a marked reduction in antibody quality in terms of neutralization capacity. In contrast deficiencies in TLR3 or MyD88 (data not shown) did not alter virus-specific antibody responses and neutralization capacities. Collectively, these findings suggest that RLR-dependent signaling coordinates effective antibody responses during WNV infection through as yet undefined pathway. (3) While systemic IFN responses provide a link between innate and adaptive immune responses, our studies suggest that the PRR signaling pathways (RLR-dependent vs \u2013independent) and levels of IFN production in combination with production other proinflammatory cytokines or chemokines regulate the quantity and quality of the immune response during virus infection. Thus, in the absence of IPS-1 signaling, infected conventional DCs or M\u03c6, two integral cell types in establishing adaptive immunity, likely do not produce IFN or the normal array and level of proinflammatory cytokines/ chemokines. Instead, IFN and other mediators may be strictly produced by infected or bystander cells during WNV infection, occurring with altered kinetics and magnitude, through TLR-dependent pathways, such as TLR3 and/or TLR7 [23],[25]. (4) In the absence of IPS-1, the enhanced expansion of Ly6C+ \u201cinflammatory\u201d DCs failed to limit early WNV replication and dissemination. This inflammatory DC subset migrates to sites of infection, secretes pro-inflammatory cytokines, and promotes CD8+ T cell expansion during a secondary virus infection, suggesting it sustains the effector T cell response [59]. Our data indicate that Ly6C+ DC recruitment and/or expansion is governed by IPS-1-dependent events of RLR signaling. Thus, the aberrant recruitment/expansion of these inflammatory DCs may contribute to immunopathogenesis and limit development of an effective immune response to control WNV virus infection. (5) The lack of Treg expansion during WNV infection correlated with altered IFN levels, increased proinflammatory cytokines and chemokine levels, and an increased number and distribution of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. These observations implicate an indirect or direct role for IPS-1 in regulating Treg levels during WNV infection, and provide evidence that links a lack of Treg expansion to immune dysregulation.",

            "text": "While their importance in autoimmunity is established [60], recent studies have implicated an integral role for Tregs in controlling inflammation and adaptive immune responses during acute virus infections [26],[43],[44]. During acute infection Tregs function to locally contain and control the immune response with the dual outcome of suppressing viral dissemination while decreasing the likelihood of immune-mediated pathology. In support of this model, infection studies with herpes simplex virus (HSV) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), two well established models of viral encephalitis, have demonstrated the importance of Tregs in limiting proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses to protect the CNS and enhance survival [26],[43]. Recent work also implicates Tregs in the control of WNV pathogenesis, wherein peripheral expansion of Tregs was associated with asymptomatic infection among WNV-infected blood donors but reduced Treg levels associated with WNV disease [45]. Furthermore, these studies revealed that the conditional depletion of Treg cells in mice results in enhancement of WNV virulence and expansion of antigen-specific CD8 T cells. Interestingly, from our studies, type I IFN does not appear to be the major contributor to Treg expansion during WNV infection, as Tregs failed to expand in the IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 infected mice despite their elevated levels of systemic type IFN. These observations suggest that RLR signaling through IPS-1 provides essential signals that directly or indirectly impart the expansion of Tregs during WNV infection.",

The integrity of the innate/adaptive immune interface is central to the eliminating virus but also restricting immunopathogenesis and inflammation during infection. RLR signaling is essential for triggering the innate immune response to RNA viruses that cause human disease, including the influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus and other paramyxoviruses, picornaviruses, reoviruses, flaviviruses, and hepatitis C virus [14],[19],[22].
