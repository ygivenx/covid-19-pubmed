D2 stabilises Core on the surface of lipid droplets and exposes the hydrophilic D1 to the viral RNA, therefore it is essential for nucleocapsid formation in mammalian cells13. However, in vitro D1 is sufficient to form stable proteinase-resistant nucleocapsids when stabilised by interactions with nucleic acids141516. We therefore prepared D1 as a SELEX target by recombinant protein expression. D1 HCV Core (JFH-1) was expressed in E. coli and purified by nickel affinity chromatography against an N-terminal hexahistidine tag. The identity of the his-tagged protein was confirmed by LC-MS/MS of Coomassie stained bands excised from an SDS-PAGE gel. The antigenicity of the final purified protein was also confirmed by immunoblotting for Core D1 and the hexahistidine tag (Fig. 1).",

It should be noted that known PSs in other ssRNA viruses are sequence/structure degenerate and their capsid/coat protein recognition sequences are discontinuous and minimal121920. A consequence is that the pool of binders from SELEX should include a majority of oligonucleotides that, although matching essential features of HCV PSs, are unlikely to match extended regions of the genome. Despite this constraint, there are aptamers that match multiple sites within the genome and occur with statistical significance (a Bernoulli score of 12 or more; red peaks, Fig. 2) compared to the unselected na\u00efve library (grey peaks, Fig. 2). This outcome suggests that the HCV genome does contain multiple PS sites. In order to test this hypothesis, the same procedure was applied to an additional 14 genotype 2 HCV genomes, i.e. they were compared to the aptamers selected against JFH-1, and a similar picture emerged. This suggests that these PS sites are evolutionarily conserved. Such peaks, within 10 nucleotides of the peaks in Fig. 2, which were conserved for at least 60% of these additional strains, are highlighted by green arrows (Fig. 2).",

A similarity analysis revealed the potential formation of stem-loops with similar loop motifs in each of these fragments. An alignment of the loop portions of these stem-loops is displayed in Fig. 3a. This analysis reveals a bias towards a GRRGR loop motif, R denoting a purine, suggesting that PSs should exhibit this motif or close variations thereof. In order to establish the statistical significance of this motif, we compared its occurrence in the loop portion of stem-loops in the wild-type genome with that in randomised versions of the genome, both for JFH-1 and for the other strain variants considered here. This confirmed a significant statistical bias in the wild-type genomes for this motif. We then interrogated sub-motifs of GRRGR in order to identify those with an even higher statistical significance, which revealed a GGRGG motif. The positions of stem-loops with this motif across the JFH-1 genome are displayed in Fig. 3b.",

Lower-affinity motifs may not necessarily be easily identifiable through a SELEX screen, yet their presence at statistically significant numbers within the wild-type genome would be indicative of a potential role in virus assembly. Based on previously-published models, the statistical bias observed for the GGRGG motif would be predicted to encompass at most 25% of the putative packaging signals (pPSs)19. Variations of the motif with statistical bias are the hallmark for PSs with intermediate or weaker affinity for the capsid protein. The same statistical analysis was therefore used to interrogate other variations of the GGRGR motif, in an effort to identify sub-motifs that were more frequent in the wild-type genome than in the randomised version. The motif GXRXR fulfilled these criteria (see Methods for details).",

In contrast to other positive-strand RNA viruses2728 there is no evidence for a single cis-acting RNA structure capable of directing packaging of both viral and non-viral RNAs to a nascent capsid particle. Therefore it is plausible that multiple RNA structures contribute to RNA-Core binding and act cooperatively to drive encapsidation and assembly. The presence of multiple, weak-affinity packaging signals in other RNA virus genomes has recently been reported1929, which represents a novel mechanism for viral packaging in viruses which do not possess a readily identifiable prototypic packaging signal. Here, we provide evidence that the abrogation of short motifs (pPSs) located across the HCV genome has a significant effect on RNA encapsidation, manifested by a decrease in infectious titre. This is only apparent in the multiple pPS mutant (\u03948XSL), consistent with RNA packaging being a cooperative process in the Hepaciviridae. The fact that depletion of all 8 pPSs was required before a significant packaging phenotype was observed may explain why previous mutagenic screens have been unsuccessful in identifying these novel motifs30 \u2013 if the pPSs act synergistically, a threshold of ablation must be reached before significant phenotypic changes are observed. Additional low-affinity pPSs presumably also exist which were not mutated in this analysis. There are multiple occurrences of our described motifs within the JFH-1 genome which were not identified by our original aptamer screen; it may be that a large number of functionally redundant pPSs exist and hence are able to easily compensate for many mutations which may occur during the error-prone RNA replication process in vivo.",

The formation of such regular capsid-like particles in these protocols requires the presence of structured RNA, proving that protein-protein interactions are insufficient to drive Core multimerisation. It is now recognised that these models do not reflect the assembly process in mammalian cells, therefore although investigating the binding kinetics of each pPS and its respective mutant would be of significant interest, future work may have to utilise alternatives to such in vitro assembly models. Additionally, the fact that intact HCV genomes cannot be packaged in in vitro assembly systems15 supports our model wherein the structures of interest may be formed temporarily and potentially only in certain scenarios, such as during presentation of nascent RNA within a replication complex. The NS5A protein (an essential component of the viral replication complex) possesses a broad RNA binding spectrum35 and interacts specifically with Core protein36; this combined with the fact that Core exhibits extensive RNA chaperone activity3738 suggests a highly plausible model of RNA conformational alterations occurring during RNA transfer and subsequent assembly.",

This motif is the only region of the IRES which possesses similar features to the stem-loops selected for mutagenesis; specifically, the internal bulge and a G-rich stretch within the unpaired terminal loop. This suggests that multiple structures, each containing this motif in their terminal loop, may be required to interact with Core during RNA encapsidation. As this IRES subdomain also forms long-range interactions with CREs in the NS5B coding region4546, a model may be envisaged in which packaging, RNA replication and translation are mutually exclusive events, partially dictated by the ligand bound to the IRES IIId loop (Core, CRE RNA or the ribosomal complex).",

Trans-packaging of viral subgenomic replicons has been extensively documented (for review see)47 and it has been noted by other research groups that the functionality of these systems reflects the lack of essential cis-acting RNA elements within the Core to NS2 genomic region48. This is supported by our data wherein only 2 of the 8 mutated pPSs are located in this area (SL733 and SL2899); their removal may not reach a threshold level to affect packaging efficiency. Trans-packaging studies utilising baculovirus-mediated structural protein expression also found that although the presence of the NS2 protein improves the production of replicon-containing particles, this was most apparent when NS2 is expressed in cis (within the replication-cassette), rather than in trans (within the structural protein construct)49. Although this may be due to the protein-protein interactions required for virion assembly50, the fact that the pPS SL2899 is present upon this particular replicon may increase the efficiency of packaging, resulting in higher titres of virus-like particles in this system. In a parallel scenario, naturally occurring mutants with deletions spanning E1-p7 have been found in multiple patient samples; as these subgenomic mutants may be packaged and released5152 an essential packaging signal is definitively not located in those coding regions.",

In addition, the genome of HCV possesses genome-scale ordered RNA structure (GORS); a phenomenon amongst particular RNA viruses which exhibit extensive RNA structure across the entire genome54. Consequently the genome is constrained in its plasticity and evolutionary potential, in contrast to the predicted behaviour of a RNA virus. It has been suggested that GORS contributes to viral persistence or modulates host innate defence mechanisms. It therefore must be considered that these pPS structures may additionally contribute to the overall architecture of the HCV genome and may not be solely involved in the Core-RNA interactions during packaging \u2013 they may have multiple functions, requiring distinct structural conformations to be adopted at precise points during the viral replication cycle. The \u03948XSL mutant may represent a virus which has reached a threshold level of GORS interruption. However this is unlikely; an equivalent effect upon replication and assembly would be predicted if this were the case. It is therefore apparent that our analysis does not merely reflect RNA structures already annotated within the HCV genome, but rather the identification of novel structures utilised for Core-RNA binding.",

Bead immobilised protein was then washed 3 times with selection buffer (PBS, 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20, 1\u00d7 Roche complete protease inhibitor per 50 mL). A Biomek 2000 laboratory automation work station (Beckman Coulter) was used to perform 10 rounds of in vitro SELEX as described previously29, using a N35 2\u2032OH RNA library. This starting library was synthesised according to an experimentally and iteratively optimised protocol. It was purchased from AptaIT (Munich, Germany) who performed three rounds of synthesis, Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and statistical analysis of NGS data from the library using the COMPAS software. In doing so the random region of the library has been optimised in respect of an equal distribution of nucleotide building blocks (25% of G, C, A & T, at each position), as well as in respect of a Gaussian distribution of motifs of length 4\u20138 nucleotides. An equal distribution of nucleotides increases the sequence space on the level of shorter motifs, which finally mediate binding to the target of interest. Consequently, the chance for a successful SELEX experiment increases with a homogeneous random region. Here the library was initially transcribed with a HiScribe T7 High Yield RNA transcription kit (New England Biolabs). Negative selections were carried out at each round of SELEX using bare His-Tag isolation and pulldown beads. The stringency of the aptamer-target interaction was raised by increasing the number of washes from 10 to 15 (slower off-rate) and by decreasing the amount of bead-immobilised protein by half (faster on-rate). Selections were carried out at 37 \u00b0C. Following the final round of SELEX, aptamers were analysed by NGS using a MiSeq Desktop Sequencer (Illumina). The SELEX library was prepared using the MiSeq reagent kit following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Raw sequencing reads were processed using in-house scripts to identify sequences that contained correct 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 primers. Processed sequences were used for packaging signal identification (see below).",

For each such position of the reference frame, the subset of the aptamer sequence with the best alignment to the genome was identified according to the Bernoulli score B, which benchmarks the probability of a non-contiguous alignment to that of a contiguous alignment of B nucleotides. The Bernoulli scores for all reference frames of a given aptamer sequence in the library were rank-ordered, starting from the largest score, and all matches with the genome up to a Bernoulli score of 12 counted.

Peaks which occurred for at least 60% of the genomes within <10 nucleotides of each other were marked by a green arrow to indicate their conservation. These were used as a basis to identify the highly conserved pPS recognition motif. For this, sequences of 60 nucleotides, centred around the peak nucleotide, were extracted and all possible mFold predicted folds were considered. A similarity analysis of these stem-loops was performed, comparing both sequence and structure elements. The foldings of each peak area which had the highest degree of similarity with secondary structure elements in the other peaks was identified. This returned a stem-loop for each peak; an alignment of the corresponding terminal loop sequences is displayed in Fig. 2. In order to identify which features of the consensus motif are statistically significant, the number of occurrence of stem-loops with different types of sub-motifs in the genome was calculated and benchmarked against their occurrence in randomised versions of the genome. The consensus motif was GRRGR; this motif was 2.05 times more likely to occur in the wildtype than randomised genomes. In order to refine this motif, we performed similar statistical tests for submotifs of this consensus motif; we identified GGRGG and GXRXR motifs as being more likely to occur in the wildtype genome than in a randomised version, by a factor of 2.36 and 1.14, respectively, suggesting that pPSs with the former motif could correspond to high affinity PSs, and those with the latter motif could correspond to lower affinity PSs.",
