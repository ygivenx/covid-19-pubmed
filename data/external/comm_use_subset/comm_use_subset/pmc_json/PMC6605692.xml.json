Legionnaires\u2019 disease is caused by inhalation of Legionella species, which are intracellular, Gram-negative bacilli ubiquitously found in the environment [1-2]. Host risk factors for Legionnaires\u2019 disease include male gender, age older than 50 years, cigarette smoking, diabetes, end-stage renal failure, organ transplantation and immunosuppression, such as glucocorticoids or anti-rejection drugs following organ transplantation [1]. Travel is an important and underappreciated risk factor associated with legionellosis in a community setting [1]. Treatment options for Legionnaires' disease include macrolides, fluoroquinolones, or tetracycline; however, preferred therapies for immunocompromised patients with Legionnaires\u2019 disease include levofloxacin and azithromycin [1-3]. We describe an immunocompromised and severely ill patient with Legionnaires' disease and who also has allergies to both fluoroquinolones and macrolides; he was successfully treated using tigecycline, a third generation glycylcycline, indicating that tigecycline may serve as a safe and effective alternative therapeutic option for treatment of Legionnaires\u2019 disease in select cases.",

Blood and sputum cultures are relatively insensitive in diagnosing Legionnaires\u2019 disease; in contrast, urine antigen testing has a sensitivity of 60%-95% and specificity greater than 99% [1]. Urine antigen testing for Legionella only detects Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 (Lp1) and is most sensitive for the detection of the Pontiac subtype of Lp1, which causes the majority of cases of community-acquired Legionnaires\u2019 disease [1]. Legionella urine antigen testing will often be positive on the first day of illness and remain positive for several weeks [1]. Molecular testing of lower respiratory tract specimens can also be used to identify both Legionella pneumophila and Legionella species by PCR [1].",

Furthermore, the one patient in this case series who received 14 days of tigecycline monotherapy had received eight days of azithromycin prior to switching therapy.

This case, however, demonstrates that tigecycline can be effective as a second-line treatment option for Legionnaires\u2019 disease in the setting of allergies to traditional mainstays of therapy. In 2013, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a new boxed warning about the higher risk of death among patients receiving tigecycline compared with other antibiotics, particularly apparent for hospital-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia [10]. While both the FDA and Health Canada have approved tigecycline for treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, complicated skin and soft tissue infections, and complicated intra-abdominal infections, its use should be reserved for situations when alternative treatments are not suitable [10-11].
