            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a contagious and often fatal respiratory illness, was first reported in the Guangdong province in China in November 2002. The disease quickly spread to other Asian countries, North America, and Europe, infecting more than 8000 individuals and causing approximately 800 deaths1. Recently, just as SARS began to fade from public memory, a new coronavirus called Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in 2012. Pathogenic human CoVs, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, killed approximately 36% of infected patients in Saudi Arabia and South Korea2\u20134. It is alarming the new and deadly CoVs can emerge at any time with the potential to become pandemics. Unfortunately, neither a protective vaccine nor an effective antiviral agent for the prevention and treatment of SARS is available. Therefore, continued development of therapeutic and prophylactic countermeasures against potentially deadly CoVs is warranted. The SARS-CoV is a crown-like enveloped virus that contains a positive-strand RNA whose genome sequence exhibits only moderate homology to other known CoVs5. Since SARS-CoV proteases (3-chymotrypsin-like protease [3CLpro] and papain-like protease [PLpro]) are synthesized as large precursor proteins that are cleaved to generate mature active proteins and their structures are conserved across the CoV genera, targeting these proteins is an effective antiviral strategy in suppressing viral genome replication to cure CoV infection1\n,\n6.",

            "text": "As a continuation of our interest in natural product-derived anti-CoV candidates, we report in this study, the inhibitory actions of polyphenols from Broussonetia papyrifera against CoV proteases. We have previously reported that the \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activity of polyphenols from this genus depends on the number of prenyl groups in the molecule7. Many natural inhibitors of various glucosidases have been explored for potential application as medicines for carbohydrate-mediated diseases such as cancer8, diabetes9, and infectious diseases. Endoplasmic reticulum \u03b1-glucosidases are responsible for the stepwise removal of terminal glucose residues from N-glycan chains attached to nascent glycoproteins. These reactions are the first steps in N-linked glycan processing and are essential for the proper folding and function of many glycoproteins10. Because most viral envelope glycoproteins contain N-linked glycans, \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors such as 1-deoxynojirimycin and castanospermine have been proposed as potentially useful broad-spectrum antiviral agents based on their activity on a variety of enveloped viruses11\n,\n12.",

The crude extracts were then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 30 min to remove the insoluble pellet. The supernatant was loaded onto a Ni-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with buffer A and the protein sample was eluted with 100\u2013300 mM imidazole.

The IC50 values of the isolated compounds, which measure their ability to inhibit the catalytic activity of the proteases, were calculated by fitting the data to a logic derivative equation. We also examined the \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory capacity of the isolated compounds7. These compounds showed dose-dependent inhibitory effects on both \u03b1-glucosidase and cysteine proteases. Results of the CoV cysteine protease inhibition assays are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. All tested polyphenols (1\u201310) showed dose-dependent inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV PLpro (Figure 3). As shown in Table 1, the compounds were more potent against SARS-CoV PLpro compared with the other cysteine proteases. The IC50 values of compounds 1\u201310 against trans-cleavage activity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro ranged from 30.2 to 233.3 \u03bcM. Among the isolated polyphenols, the C5-alkyl group (prenyl)-substituted flavan5 exhibited the most potent inhibitory effect against SARS-CoV 3CLpro and was more effective than quercetin (IC50 = 52.7 \u03bcM). General structural\u2013activity relationships can be deduced from these data, for example, molecules with a C4-OH group and a saturated chromenone with a dihydroxy group at ring C showed higher inhibitory activity than those with a closed prenyl group (7, IC50 = 233.3 \u03bcM). Chalcones (1\u20133, IC50: 57.8\u2013202.7 \u03bcM) and biphenyl propanoids (9 and 10, IC50: 43.3\u201364.2 \u03bcM) moderately inhibited SARS-CoV 3CLpro activity. Furthermore, the activity of the compounds was significantly affected by subtle changes in their molecular structure, such as from prenylation and methylation (vide infra).",

The positions of the two prenyl groups had substantial effect on SARS-CoV PLpro inhibition by the corresponding compounds. The SARS-CoV PLpro inhibitory potency of the prenyl flavone was considerably higher than that of flavone derivatives, including keampferol (IC50 = 16.3 \u03bcM), quercetin (IC50 = 8.6 \u03bcM), and quercetin-\u03b2-galactoside (IC50 = 51.9 \u03bcM). It is probable that the presence of a prenyl group within the resorcinol group allows for the formation of strong hydrophobic interactions with the enzyme. Additionally, an increase in the number of hydroxyl groups in the flavone backbone resulted in higher inhibitory activity, which can be noted from the lower IC50 value of quercetin (8.6 \u03bcM) compared to that of kaempferol (IC50 = 16.3 \u03bcM). Among chalcone derivatives with a closed prenyl ring (chromenone, which is characterized by a C5-prenyl group in ring B), diminishing protease inhibitory activity was observed (2, IC50 = 9.2 \u03bcM >1, IC50 = 11.6 \u03bcM > isoliquiritigenin, IC50 = 24.6 \u03bcM>3, IC50 = 35.4 \u03bcM). In contrast, the number of prenyl groups and the degree of saturation did not have any effect on the prenylated flavans. As shown in Table 1, all flavans except 6 exhibited moderate inhibitory activity (IC50 values ranging from 30.4 to 35.8 \u03bcM). Additionally, compound 10, which contains a methoxy group that is also present in the corresponding biphenyl propanoids, was two-fold more effective (IC50 = 15.2 \u03bcM) than the unmethylated 9.",

            "text": "In recent year, PLpro has been the focus of numerous studies on the development of chemotherapeutic drugs against CoV-induced diseases. It is part of the nsp3 protein, and cleaves at the nsp1/2, nsp2/3 and nsp3/4 boundaries by recognizing the LXGG consensus motif. In addition, PLpro exhibits deubiquitinating (DUB) activity and antagonizes the induction of type-1 interferon (IFN). Interferon-stimulated gene 15 is one of the most upregulated genes upon type I IFN stimulation and is involved in tagging newly synthesized proteins during an antiviral response. Both ubiquitin and ISG15 may have important implications in viral replication and pathogenesis. SARS-CoV PLpro can cleave ubiquitin and ISG15 from cellular conjugates. Similarly, MERS-CoV PLpro has also been shown to possess DUB and deISG15ylating activities. Thus, an effective anti-CoV drug is one that inhibits viral protease activity as well as DUB and deISG15ylating activities. Since 4 inhibits SARS-CoV PLpro, we postulated that its efficacy would be higher by having DUB and deISG15ylating activities. Compound 4 strongly inhibited the cleavage of both ubiquitin and ISG15 (IC50 values of 7.6 and 8.5 \u03bcM, respectively). Complete substitution of prenyl groups (4 vs. quercetin, IC50 values of 20.7 and 34.4 \u03bcM, respectively) and introduction of hydroxyl groups strongly affected activity (quercetin vs. kaempferol, IC50 values of 61.7 and 71.7 \u03bcM, respectively). All of the tested compounds display moderate inhibition of in vitro cleavage of ubiquitin (IC50 = 7.6\u2013136.9 \u03bcM) and ISG15 (IC50 = 8.5\u201371.7 \u03bcM) (Table 1). To date, the function of the DUB activity of PLpro\nin vivo is unknown, as is the identity of its in vivo cellular substrate. Thus, further investigation is necessary to determine the specificity of its inhibition by measuring the cleavage of ubiquitin-like protein ISG15, which could reveal whether deISGylation by PLpro is a mechanism by which SARS-CoV inactivates IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2-induced innate immune response.",
