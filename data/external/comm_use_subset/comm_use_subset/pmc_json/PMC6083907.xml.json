In recent years, new influenza viruses have emerged, leading to occasional epidemics or even pandemics. In 2009, a novel H1N1 strain, 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus (pH1N1), was first reported in La Gloria, Veracruz, Mexico (1). It quickly spread all over the world and is still circulating as one of the dominant seasonal influenza viruses in various countries (2). After several seasons of circulation, an overall high (up to 24%) incidence of pH1N1 exists among the populations of those countries (3). Meanwhile, different avian influenza viruses (AIVs) also emerged or reemerged, posing continuously threats to global health. From 2003 to 2015, 844 laboratory-confirmed human cases (with 449 deaths) of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection were officially reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) from 16 countries. Hundreds of human infection cases (with a mortality rate of 40%) were reported for avian influenza A (H7N9) virus since March 2013 (http://www.who.int/influenza). Additionally, H9N2, H6N1, and H5N6 have emerged, all of which are connected with poultry exposure (4\u20136). These AIVs pose a threat to human health, considering the circulation of the viruses in the live-poultry market (LPM) and among wild birds (7, 8).",

            "text": "Cellular immunity plays a key role in the control of influenza virus infection (9\u201313). CD4+ T cells can promote effective immunity by providing secondary signals for antibody (Ab) responses and produce cytokines upon infection (14), while cytotoxic CD8+ T cells can provide partial protection and reduce symptoms by promoting viral clearance (15). Infection with influenza A virus often provides heterosubtypic immunity against other subtypes (16). Although cross-subtype monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against influenza viruses have been reported (17), heterosubtypic neutralizing antibody responses among the populations are rare (18). Influenza A viruses mainly express 14 proteins which are encoded by eight RNA segments (19). Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) specific for influenza A viruses mostly target internal, nonglycosylated proteins, such as NP, M1, and PB1 (20), which are enriched with immunodominant CTL epitopes and markedly conserved among different strains compared to HA and NA. This implies an important role for virus-specific T cells in heterosubtypic immune responses. Influenza virus-specific cross-T-cell reactivities between seasonal influenza virus and a particular AIV, such as H5N1 or H7N9, have previously been investigated (10, 20\u201322). However, a systematic evaluation of cross-subtypic T-cell immunity profiles with respect to different human-infecting AIVs has not yet been performed, and the roles of influenza A virus-derived epitopes in the cross-reactive T-cell responses and heterosubtypic protection are not well understood.",

Increasing the magnitude of memory CD8+ T cells could provide better protection against heterosubtypic infections (24). It was reported that an effective vaccine from modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) encoding the A/Panama/2007/2099 NP and M1 proteins drastically boosts CTL responses in phase 1 and phase 2a clinical trials in healthy adults. The protective efficacy of the elicited CTLs by the T-cell-based influenza vaccine can be confirmed by influenza challenge (25). Nevertheless, combined structural and functional studies based on influenza virus-derived T-cell epitopes demonstrated that minor mutation of an epitope can lead to a profound effect on the antigenicity of the peptide (26\u201328). Although the internal proteins targeted by these potential universal vaccines are quite conserved between different influenza virus subtypes, it is largely unknown whether minor variations in these T-cell epitopes would have an influence on protection.",

We found that certain levels of cross-reactive T-cell responses against H5N1, H6N1, H7N9, and H9N2 viruses were detected. Cross-reactive T-cell responses against H5N1 (36.8 spot-forming cells [SFCs]/105 PBMCs) were found at levels similar to those determined for pH1N1-specific T-cell responses (34.9 SFCs/105 PBMCs), but the levels for both were higher than those seen with other AIVs, i.e., H6N1 (15.1 SFCs/105 PBMCs), H7N9 (16 SFCs/105 PBMCs), and H9N2 (17.7 SFCs/105 PBMCs) (Fig. 2A). Lee et al. synthesized the overlapping peptides covering all proteins and found that M1 and NP possess the major immunogenic sites (20). We evaluated cross-reactive T-cell responses to M1 proteins from different AIVs among the pH1N1 M1-cultured PBMCs for 9 days.

Cross-reactive T cells targeted different CD8+ or CD4+ T-cell epitopes of AIVs covering special sequences of the antigens. Thus, we hypothesized that the phylogenetic relationship in terms of the T-cell epitopes from different AIVs may correspond to the biased cross-T-cell reactivities. We retrieved the previously defined HLA class I-restricted peptides located within the internal M1, NP, and PB1 proteins of pH1N1 and the corresponding peptides within different AIVs and plotted their phylogenetic relationship (Fig. 4B and D and F). The T-cell epitope evolution of pH1N1 is close to that of H5N1 but distant from those of H7N9, H9N2, and H6N1, which is consistent with the biased cross-T-cell reactivity to H5N1 but not to the other strains.",

A total of 266 CTL epitopes were retrieved from IEDB and then mapped to each strain (up to 30 December 2016). We filtered out 129 internal protein epitopes to perform further analysis (see Table S2). Clustering analysis indicated that the H1N1 stains are located in one cluster (see Fig. S3A). For different human-infecting AIV strains, H5N1 strains remained close to pH1N1 compared to the distance of other AIVs (i.e., H7N9, H6N1, H9N2) to pH1N1 (Fig. 4G). The H7N9 and H9N2 strains were intermixed with each other, which may have been related to the shared internal genes of these AIV subtypes in China (5). Seasonal H1N1 influenza viruses before 2009, such as A(H1N1)/Brisbane/59/07, were located in a cluster that was adjacent to but distinct from that of pH1N1, indicating a cellular antigenic transition of pH1N1 compared to previous H1N1 stains.",

In this study, more than half (54.5%) of the subjects had the HLA-A*2402 allele, and M1 protein-derived peptide H1-P25 (M1 99\u2013109; LYKKLKREITF in pH1N1) with HLA-A*2402 restriction is 1 of the 11 peptides.

The overall conformations of main chains were similar in the two structures (Fig. 5D and E). However, in the HLA-A*2402/H1-P25 structure, residue Ile9 inserts inside the E pocket of the HLA-A*2402 groove (Fig. 5F). In contrast, in the HLA-A*2402/H7-25 complex, mutated residue Met9 is too large to be accommodated in the E pocket of HLA-A*2402 and, thus, its side chain protrudes from the peptide binding groove and might be contacted by the TCR (Fig. 5G). Another structural variation is contributed by Lys4. Although this residue is conserved between the P25 peptides of pH1N1 and H7N9, the salt bridge formed between Lys4 and Glu8 in HLA-A*2402/H1-P25 is not present in the structure of HLA-A*2402/H7-P25. Without the constraint of the salt bridge, Lys4 of peptide H7-P25 in HLA-A*2402/H7-P25 is exposed to solvent instead of being partially buried in the C pocket as in the HLA-A*2402/H1-P25 structure. Due to the low resolution (3.3 \u00c5) of the first data set from HLA-A*2402/H7-P25, we collected another data set which had higher resolution (2.3 \u00c5) (see Table S4). Though no clear electron density for residues in the middle portion of H7-25 was observable on the basis of data set 2 of HLA-A*2402/H7-P25, the conformations of residues Lys4 and Met9 from H7-P25 in data set 2 were still different from those from H1-P25 but were similar to those from H7-P25 in data set 1 (see Fig. S1B).",

We used pH1N1 virus at sublethal doses to prime mice, and 28 days later, the mice were intranasally infected with lethal doses of pH1N1, H5N1, or H7N9.

In the pH1N1-infected group, pH1N1-specific neutralizing antibodies were detectable on day 14, and no cross-neutralization antibody titers to H5N1 or H7N9 could be detected (Fig. 6J) and similarly, there was no cross-neutralization antibody titers to pH1N1 detected in serum of the H5N1- or H7N9-infected group (Fig. 6K and L). The pH1N1-specific T-cell response in the mice was found to be 363 SFCs/106 splenocytes at 14 dpi with pH1N1 (Fig. 6M). Meanwhile, cross-reactive T-cell responses to either H5N1 or H7N9 were found in the pH1N1-infected mice. However, the cross-reactive T-cell responses to H7N9 (273 SFCs/106 splenocytes) were lower than those against H5N1 (361 SFCs/106 splenocytes). These results indicated that bias of cross-reactive T-cell responses induced by pH1N1 may lead to different protection efficacies against H5N1 and H7N9. We also prepared the tetramers of two immunodominant H-2Db-restricted T-cell epitopes, NP366\u2013374 and PA224\u2212233, and their H5N1/H7N9 mutants. The tetramer staining of the splenocytes from the mice infected by H1N1 for 28 days showed that the mice possessed robust H1-NP366\u2212374 and H1-PA224\u2212233 peptide-specific CD8+ T cells (1.2% and 0.9%), whereas certain T cells cross-recognizing the H5N1/H7N9 mutants could also be detected (0.31% and 0.40%) (Fig. 6N and O). However, the ratios of mutant peptides H5/H7-NP366\u2212374 and H1/H7-PA224\u2212233 were lower, which may still have contributed to the cross-protection.",

Epitope-based phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the H5N1 subtype possesses a cluster of conserved epitopes with pH1N1 that may lead to the observed cross-antigenicity.

The elicitation of a neutralizing-antibody response is a correlate of protection for vaccines and contributes to protection against many viral infections (33). In particular, HA imprinting in childhood could provide lifelong protection against severe infection and death from emergent viruses (34). However, a previous study showed that no H7N9-specific antibody titers were detected in the 1,544 serum samples collected before the emergence of H7N9 from poultry workers, most of whom were born after 1968, when H3N2 emerged (18). This indicated that cross-reactive serological immunity against H7N9 virus did not preexist among healthy young populations. In our study, the levels of neutralizing antibodies that cross-recognized H5N1 and H7N9 were also undetectable, which may indicate a critical role of T cells in heterosubtypic protection. Recent studies indicated that HA-specific CD4+ T cells do not possess a dominant role compared to the internal proteins such as M1 and NP (20, 35). Therefore, HA-specific immunity may not be sufficient to explain the cross-protection against AIV by the immunity to previous seasonal influenza viruses. According to our bioinformatics analyses, the heat map of all available T-cell epitopes among human-infecting viruses indicated that the accumulation of varied epitopes may hinder cross-T-cell reactivities. In particular, a cluster of conserved T-cell epitopes shared by H5N1 and H1N1 may be related to cross-protection against H5N1. These epitopes could be considered for use in the development of vaccines preventing H1N1 and H5N1 infections. In contrast, T-cell recognition of the mutant viral epitopes in H7N9 was significantly decreased due to the poor T-cell activation threshold and disrupted peptide-HLA interactions. Although low cross-reactivity of the variable peptides may also exist due to TCR conformational plasticity, their protective effect remains to be determined (36). We also detected a certain level of cross-reactive T-cell responses against AIVs existing among different individuals, which may be contributed by conserved T-cell epitopes. Greenbaum et al. showed that a large fraction of conserved T-cell epitopes in seasonal influenza virus could induce significant T-cell responses; as such preexisting T-cell immunity may decrease the severity of a variant strain infection (37). Our previous work also confirmed a dominant role for conserved T-cell epitopes in anti-influenza virus responses (30).",

Lee and others reported that M1 and NP possess the major immunogenicities among the internal proteins, followed by PB1 and PA (20). They also found that the recognition frequency of M1 protein was higher than those of the other internal proteins. However, the identity of the internal proteins which possess a dominant influence on T-cell cross-reactivity was still unknown. On the basis of previous researches, we compared the T-cell responses against H1N1 and H7N9 among healthy donors with overlapping peptide pools of NP and M1, respectively, in the present study. NP-specific T-cell cross-reactivity against H7N9 showed a high level among the members of the pH1N1 Ab+ population. Interestingly, we found biased T-cell cross-reactivities in responses to M1 proteins derived from different AIVs. The similarity of the M1 sequences in the two strains was lower (92%) than those of NP (93%) and other internal proteins (PB1 [96%], PB2 [97%], and PA [96%]). Besides, the influences of the substitutions on immunogenicity would be different among different proteins, which may also contribute to varied cross-reactivity of the internal proteins between H1N1 and H7N9. Mutations in the M1 protein might have a larger influence on its immunogenicity. Considering the immunogenicity and dissimilarity conservation of these two proteins, we proposed that M1 might have a more dominant influence in eliciting T cell immunity among influenza viruses and chose M1 as the stimulus in the experiments that followed that assessed T cell cross-reactivity and heterogeneous protection. Thus, like the humoral response in HA, minor variations among the immunodominant epitopes may impact cross-T-cell reactivities, which should be carefully considered during the development of universal vaccines based on the M1 proteins of influenza viruses.",

Minor substitutions of the residues on the middle bulged region of the peptides can abrogate T-cell recognition (40). Also, the thermal stability of pMHC could influence T-cell activation. Peptide Gag180\u2013188 derived from HIV could be recognized by HLA-B*07:02, HLA-B*42:01, HLA-B*42:02, and HLA-B*81:01. However, Gag180\u2013188 showed poor thermal stability with HLA-B*42:02 and elicited weaker T-cell responses (41). Also, the substitutions of the primary or secondary anchor residues may completely change the antigenicity of the peptides (42). As previously determined in structural studies, mutational escape in T-cell epitopes contributed to the antigenic disaccord (43, 44). Gras et al. investigated the cross-reactive T-cell responses against HLA-B7 supertype-restricted variable epitope NP418\u2212426 in humans (43). They found that cross-reactive CD8+ T-cell immunity did not exist between the pH1N1 virus and recent seasonal influenza viruses due to structural variation of the solvent-exposed residues in T-cell epitopes that can be recognized by TCRs. Mutations of anchor residues (or partially solvent-exposed secondary anchors) can also dramatically decrease CD8+ T-cell responses and result in delayed viral clearance (45). Moreover, the substitutions may also lead to an induced fit on the helices of MHC-I that form the peptide-binding groove (46) and thus impact TCR recognition (47). In the structures of HLA-A*2402 with H1/H5-derived peptide H1-P25 and H7/H9-specific epitope H7-P25, the I9M substitution influenced the solvent-exposed surface and decreased the force of anchoring of the peptide to HLA-A*2402. This indicated that variable antigenicities of nonconserved peptides could be largely influenced by both exposed positions for TCR docking and anchoring positions for MHC binding, which should be investigated in the HLA-A*2402 cohort.",
