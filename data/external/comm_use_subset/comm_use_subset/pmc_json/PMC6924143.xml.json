            "text": "Toll-like receptors (TLRs) represent an ancient evolutionary host immune defense system. There are 13 expressed TLR genes in mice (10 in humans), and each is devoted to recognizing a distinct set of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that are not found in healthy vertebrate cells, making them an important tool to help fight infections [1]. TLRs 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 are extracellular and are situated in the plasma membrane where they bind bacterial cell wall components such as lipoteichoic acids, lipopolysaccharides, lipoproteins, and flagella. TLRs 3, 7, 8, 9 are located in endosomes where they recognize specific nucleic acid sequences expressed by various pathogens [2]. The extracellular signaling domain of TLR9 forms a horseshoe shaped dimer that forms a sandwich that clasps two CpG oligonucleotides (ODN) resulting in the cytoplasmic domains coming into close proximity thereby triggering downstream signaling [2]. Upon activation, TLR9 triggers an innate immune response characterized by the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-12.",

Synthetic TLR9-active ODNs have shown utility as vaccine adjuvants and anti-cancer immunotherapeutic agents. To identify a good TLR9 ligand, typically a large library of ODNs needs to be synthesized and screened on cell lines, which is a time consuming and expensive task. We hypothesized that modern in silico high-throughput screening (HTS) methods may improve the ability to identify novel highly active TLR9 ligands. In silico screening, also known as virtual screening (VS), has been widely used to enrich datasets with compounds that have a higher probability of binding to the target of interest [3\u20135], and has an advantage over traditional screening or physical HTS due to its massively parallel processing ability; hence millions of compounds can be assessed economically in parallel. This is particularly important when the search space for potential ODNs TLR9 ligands is taken into consideration. A typical single-stranded ODN TLR9 agonist is 24 nucleotides in length, which amounts to 424 total number of possible ODNs.",

If the 3D structure of a receptor is known, structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) [6] techniques such as homology modeling, molecular docking and molecular dynamics can be used. However, if the structural information of the receptor is lacking, then ligand-based virtual screening (LBVS) [7] techniques such as quantitative structure-activity relationship and machine learning are more appropriate. SBVS involves molecular complex optimization to find the most favorable 3D binding conformation of the ligand. Consequently, SBVS is unsuitable for high-throughput screening of ligands like 24-mer ODNs, which have over 100 rotatable bonds. On the other hand, LBVS is computationally inexpensive, easy to use and might therefore be useful in the screening of TLR9 activating ODNs.",

The authors reported 21 potential TLR9 antagonists with IC50 lower than 10 \u03bcM, with five of them having IC50 values below 1 \u03bcM. Zhou et al. [10] constructed a 3D structure of human TLR9 ectodomains, complexed with CpG ODNs using homology modeling, then used molecular docking to study the interactions between TLR9 and the ODNs. They reported that leucine rich region (LRR)-11 was the main region in TLR9 responsible for ODN binding. The authors further reported that five positively charged residues within LRR11 were specifically involved in the ODN binding to TLR9. Nagpal et al.

Using the Mann-Whitney U test we compared the median mTLR9 activity score of ODNs with a motif to those without the motif for the two classes and calculated the p values. The significance threshold was set at 0.05. Figure 2 shows the effect of top 20 motifs occurrence in high (Fig. 2a) and low (Fig. 2b) mTLR9 active group of ODNs. The darker colored bars stand for a significant difference in the median mTRL9 activity score (p < 0.05) due to the presence of the motif in the ODNs. The dotted line is the median mTLR9 score of 0.53 and 0.18 for the high and low activity groups of ODNs, respectively. Within the low activity group (Additional file 2), we found that presence of motifs such as \u2018CC\u2019, \u2018GG\u2019, \u2018GGC\u2019, \u2018GCC\u2019, \u2018CCCG\u2019 and \u2018CGGC\u2019 significantly increases the median mTLR9 activity score, while the presence of motifs e.g. \u2018TGT\u2019, \u2018CGCGT\u2019 and \u2018TCT\u2019 further lowers the activity of ODNs.

Since there was no single motif that could account for the mTLR9 activity score of the ODNs, we surmised that the combination of motifs and their interaction with the TLR9 receptor was responsible for determining overall mTLR9 activity.\n",

In this technique, the performance of the model is evaluated on a new dataset not used in training or testing the model. To rigorously evaluate the performance of our model, we randomly generated 6000 24-mer ODN sequences using an in-house written Python script and then screened and ranked these randomly generated ODN for mTLR9 activity using our RF model. These ODNs were not present in our original dataset of 396 ODNs used for model building or training, and as they were virtual we had no prior knowledge of their likely mTLR9 activity at the time of model prediction. Our RF model predicted 545 of these 6000 random ODNs to be of high activity and we selected the top 100 for chemical synthesis, and then experimental tested them for mTLR9 activity using the RAW-Blue reporter cell line that expresses mTLR. Ninety-one (91%) of the predicted high activity ODNs had a mTLR9 activity value above 0.4, confirming the high accuracy of the model in predicting ODN sequences with positive mTLR9 activity (Fig. 4). This demonstrates that our mTLR9-specific RF prediction model is rigorous, with a strong performance on making predictions on a completely independent dataset.\n",

            "text": "In this study we demonstrated the feasibility of using an RF model for in silico screening of synthetic ODNs to detect high activity mTLR9 agonists. Multiple sequence features such as simple counts of nucleotides, the distance between motifs and graphically derived features like the moment of inertia were calculated before building the RF model. We observed higher occurrence of several motifs such as \u2018CGGC\u2019, \u2018CCCG\u2019, \u2018GCC\u2019, \u2018CGG\u2019, \u2018GGC\u2019, \u2018CCG\u2019, \u2018CCC\u2019, \u2018GG\u2019 and \u2018CC\u2019 in high activity as compared to low activity ODNs. This means that these cytosine and guanine rich motifs along with the key unmethylated CpG dinucleotide contribute to strong mouse TLR9 activation. Interestingly, this is in contrast with the thymine rich motifs reported for TLR9 stimulatory ODNs by Nagpal et al. [11]. This may be due the fact that our ODN training set was mouse specific whereas the dataset used by Nagpal et al. [11] was not specific to any organism. On further analysis we found 15 and 4 motifs which significantly increased, or decreased, respectively, mTLR9 activity in the low activity group (Additional file 2), whereas, we found only 3 and 4 motifs in the high activity ODNs which significantly (p value < 0.05) increased or decreased, respectively, mTLR9 activity (Additional file 3). Furthermore, we discovered motifs which significantly decreased mTLR9 activity in both low and high groups. For example, \u2018CGCGTG\u2019 and sub motifs like \u2018GCGTG\u2019 and \u2018CGCGT\u2019, decreased the activity of ODNs in both the high and low groups. However, we were unable to identify motifs that increased mTLR9 activity for both groups of ODNs. This suggests that a combination of motifs might be required to increase activity of ODNs in the high group whereas the activity of low ODNs can be improved even by inclusion of a single motif. Co-occurrence of motifs and their effect on mouse TLR9 activity can be analyzed in the future to discover combinations of motifs responsible for the increase in the activity of ODNs in both groups.",

Missing or insufficient data, mislabeling of the target variable, and irrelevant features may complicate the learning task and hinder the performance of the trained model. The sequences of ODNs with experimentally determined mTLR9 activity were obtained from in-house data we generated on synthesized ODNs that were characterized using a mouse TLR9 expressing reporter cell line (RAW-Blue cells, Invivogen, USA). The dataset consisted of 396 ODNs with mTLR9 activity values ranging from 0.0 (no activity) to 1.14 (high activity). The ODNs were grouped into two classes (Fig. 5) based on their respective activity value (i.e. 0.4 and above: high activity and below 0.4: low activity), resulting in a high activity group (count 117) and a low activity group (count 279). To ensure data quality, it is customary to check and remove any outliers, impute the missing data, check, and assign the variables the correct datatype. Our dataset had neither missing values nor outliers and therefore, no further action was required in cleaning the dataset. However, to avoid overtraining the model with similar ODNs, the diversity of the dataset was increased by limiting the similarity within the group. This was achieved by clustering the ODNs within a group using the binary fingerprint features we developed during this study and applying a clustering cutoff of 0.85 to remove similar ODNs. This resulted in the removal of five ODNs from the low activity group with 274 remaining. All ODNs in the high group (count 117) were dissimilar enough not to breach the similarity cutoff and were retained.\n",

Additionally, constructing models with many features is computationally demanding [14]. Therefore, one of the most important aspects of creating a good ML model is the choice of appropriate features that can help explain the behavior of interest based on Occam\u2019s Razor principle (i.e. simple models are more likely to be closer to reality than complex models.)

While there are a variety of features used in bioinformatics for sequence data, we used the binary fingerprint features and numerical features, including count and position of motifs, distance of the motifs with respect to the start position and graphically derived features such as the moment of inertia and radius of gyration, to train the model [16].",

Constant or near constant features take a unique value across samples and are uninformative. This resulted in the removal of 26 features. Since these features are binary in nature, we also checked and removed any linear combinations of features if present. This resulted in the removal of 31 features. To understand the distribution in the high and low group of ODNs we created a Cricos plot using the circlize package in R [22]. For all numerical features in addition to removing zero and near zero variance features we also calculated the correlation matrix and filtered out features that were highly correlated. The correlation coefficient was set at 0.85 and features with correlation above the cutoff value were removed. We then normalized the remaining features using centering and scaling techniques to make them unit independent. Subsequently, we merged the fingerprint and numerical features to give us a merged set of 40 features, listed in Table 3.\n",

To have a non-biased assessment of the performance, k-fold cross-validation was followed where one instance of the down-sampled training data was further divided into k partitions. The value of k varies from 5, 10, 15 to 20. For each partition, ODNs not included in the training were considered part of the testing dataset. Finally, the testing data of the instance was used to evaluate the classification accuracy of the model, with the best model selected for prediction on an independent validation dataset. A graphic representation of the general procedure is given in Fig. 6.",

The base learners are usually the Classification and Regression Trees (CART) constructed using a sample with replacement from the training data with the controlled variation. RF can be used for both classification and regression tasks. It can manage missing values, outliers efficiently and perform well with imbalanced datasets. The detailed account of RF methodology is present in the literature [23, 24]. Briefly RF takes advantage of two powerful statistical techniques, bagging and random feature selection. In bagging each tree is trained on a bootstrap sample (sampling with replacement) and the predictions are made by the majority vote of the trees. Furthermore, in RF instead of using all the features, RF randomly selects a set of features to split at each node when growing a tree. To assess the performance of the RF algorithm, RF performs a type of cross-validation using the out-of-bag (OOB) samples (samples which are not included in the training set). The concept of variable importance is inbuilt in the RF algorithm and the importance is measured by the Gini impurity criterion index [25]. We used the caret package in R to evaluate the performance and developed an ensemble of 20 different RF models for final prediction. The mtry parameter was tuned using the tuneGrid argument in the train function.",

ODNs were diluted in saline and added to the culture plate containing RAW-Blue cells to the total volume of 200 \u03bcL.
