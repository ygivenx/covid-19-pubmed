Therefore, it is critical to make sure that the dogs used as laboratory animals are free of special pathogens. In China, according to the national standard of laboratory dogs, the rabies virus (RV), canine parvovirus (CPV), canine adenovirus (CAV), and canine distemper virus (CDV) are the items that must be tested. All the laboratory dogs and their living houses should be checked up with these viruses regularly for quality monitoring. However, the currently existing detection method recommended by the industry standard is conventional PCR. To complete the whole check routine, four individual PCR should be carried out, which is time-consuming, especially when dealing with a large scale of samples.",
