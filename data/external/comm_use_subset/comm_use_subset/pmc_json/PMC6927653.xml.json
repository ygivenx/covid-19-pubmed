The burden of morbidity and mortality from emergencies and disasters can be severe, resulting in public health systems investing substantial time and resources toward preparedness [1]. The public health system is the lead in responding to outbreaks and in minimizing the impact of diverse emergencies on health [2,3]. Public health sector activities in infectious disease emergencies include leading other emergency management organizations during outbreaks, conducting surveillance and investigation, implementing control measures, developing guidance for health-care practitioners, and communicating risks [3]. In addition, public health is the lead sector in preparing for the population health effects of non-infectious events incited by natural or anthropogenic hazards. Emergency preparedness levels have been a concern globally in past emergencies; for example, Canada\u2019s response to the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak raised a number of issues: lack of surge capacity in the clinical and public health systems, difficulties with timely access to laboratory testing and results, and weak links between public health and the health care system were clear gaps in preparedness [3].",

While risks vary for different communities, disaster and emergency preparedness is recognized as essential for all nation-states [4,6]. Local and regional public health agencies aim to mitigate risks and protect population health; however, they face challenges to ensure readiness for potential emergencies ranging widely in likelihood and impact. Further, investments change over time with economic and policy priorities, which can influence the resources available for this purpose. Thus, the ability to define and measure essential elements of public health emergency preparedness (PHEP) is important for local and/or regional public health agencies.",

In Canada, the Canadian Institutes for Health Information and Statistics Canada report indicators of health status and health care system performance [8]; in addition, performance measurement has been used in Canada to inform health system decision-making [9]. The precise ways measurement and reporting influence health systems, however, remains unclear [10]. In recent years, increasing attention has been paid to performance measurement for the public health system [11,12]. While preparedness metrics are few in the literature [13\u201315], the pressure for public health agencies to articulate their degree of preparedness is increasing. Globally, countries are asked to meet targets aimed at reducing disaster risks in their communities, which includes health impacts [6], and the International Health Regulations (IHR) require that all nations report on indicators aligned with the IHR [16,17]. As nation-states examine their own readiness, indicators for relevant jurisdictional levels have been developed by some countries. For example, the United States (US) has examined aspects of preparedness in the context of national health security and emergency planning [18,19], including the concept of resilience [20,21], but measurement considering resilience relevant to and actionable for practice in local/regional public health is lacking.",

The all-hazards approach is viewed as essential for public health system-level readiness, enabling effective and efficient preparedness that accounts for the difficulty in predicting the type and severity of events [14,22,23]. The conventional cycle of emergency management includes four phases which are (1) prevention/mitigation, (2) preparedness, (3) response and (4) recovery; public health agency activities relate to all four phases [24]. In this study, we focus on preparedness as upstream activities and actions that promote enhanced public health system capacity and resilience throughout all four phases. It is important to note that in Canada, PHEP addresses population-level preparedness, distinct from clinical care and health care facility preparedness. Communication and integration of preparedness activities between sectors like health care, government and the community is, however, often a responsibility of public health agencies. Relevant levels of the public health system in Canada are local or regional (varies by province/territory), provincial/territorial, and federal. We consider all three as the public health system, and we identify local/regional public health agencies as the primary locus of public health service delivery in Canada [3,25].",

To address the important task of ensuring readiness and creating resilient systems, our previous work developed a framework which identifies the essential elements of PHEP relevant to Canada, and considers the complexity of the public health system and emergency context [26]. The framework for resilience includes eleven essential elements and constitutes an evidence-based approach to defining PHEP for local/regional public health agencies and supporting practice for community health protection from disaster risks. In developing the framework, we noted that promoting resilience for public health systems requires consideration of complex aspects of preparedness such as social infrastructure [26,27]; for example, assessment of workforce capacity is influenced by individual workers\u2019 willingness to respond [28]. In addition, addressing challenges across these systems may require measuring dimensions such as network strength or \u201cconnectivity\u201d of relevant stakeholders [29]. The framework for resilience thus conceptualizes the essential elements to consider in measuring PHEP. The objective of this study is to identify and define a set of PHEP indicators aligned with the framework to advance performance measurement for local/regional public health agencies.",

Rationale for the sample definition is to ensure that key indicators in PHEP were identified by individuals with knowledge and experience specifically in PHEP, and who hold leadership roles and/or have clear responsibility for PHEP within their health unit, agency or jurisdiction, and for whom indicators would be relevant [31]. Medical Officers of Health (MOHs), Associate MOHs, Environmental Health Officers, and other leaders or decision-makers with experience and/or expertise in PHEP from the federal, provincial and municipal levels were recruited. We aimed to identify 20\u201330 PHEP experts across Canada and establish a heterogeneous composition of the panel [31,35]. In the performance measurement indicator literature, selection of expert participants is described through a process of nomination, which we employed to recruit established experts in PHEP [36]. A nomination process by email was thus used to identify experts in the field of PHEP based on experience, scholarship or reputation in their organization or jurisdiction [31,36].",

Importance and actionability were defined respectively as: (1) this indicator is a key priority in public health preparedness for emergencies; and (2) this indicator is under the control of the local or regional public health agency. The survey asked participants to rate each indicator on both criteria on a seven-point Likert scale. Open-ended questions augmented the round one survey to elicit suggestions for additional indicators and obtain feedback on indicator clarity. The round 1 survey was input to the web-based platform Acuity4. The survey was piloted with experts who were not panel members but met criteria as a PHEP expert. Piloting aimed to assess clarity of the data collection instrument, functionality of the online format, and relevance of companion documents.

Comments pertaining to actionability generally related to jurisdictional responsibility, and/or resource/financial constraints out of local/regional level control. The results of round one by indicator are provided in S2 Appendix Tables 1 and 2. Indicators with unclear consensus were revised; however, indicators were not modified to address actionability comments if the indicator reached consensus for importance. Panel suggestions resulted in an additional 14 new indicators. A list of indicators suggested by the panel is found in S2 Appendix Table 3.

Indeed, new knowledge emerged as our study was in progress. Specifically, the European Centers for Disease Control (ECDC) released a report describing PHEP core competencies for European Union member states in 2017 [41]. While a new approach for the ECDC, this work was an adaptation of a US-based model published previously [15,26,41], and the indicators corresponding with the model were derived from similar documents [17,27]. Our indicator development process used a breadth of sources and aligned with an empirically-developed conceptual framework.
