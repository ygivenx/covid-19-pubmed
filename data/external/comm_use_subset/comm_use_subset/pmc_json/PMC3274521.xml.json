            "text": "Glycyrrhizin (GL), the main constituent of licorice extract (Glycyrrhiza glabra), is a natural edulcorant as well as an important ingredient of traditional Chinese medicine [1], [2], [3]. By hydrolyzing one or two distal glucuronides, GL can be transformed into glycyrrhetinic acid monoglucuronide (GAMG) or glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) (\nFigure 1\n). As an important derivative of GL, GAMG displayed stronger physiological functions than GL such as anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor functions, and so on; and it is also 1000-fold sweeter than saccharose [4]. On the other hand, GA is the bioactive substance of GL well known for its pharmacological features [4], [5], [6]. The research on GL biotransformation catalyzed by \u03b2-glucuronidase (GUS, EC 3.2.1.31) was reported mainly in animal tissues such as duck [7] and human [8], whereas studies on GL biotransformation in fungal species are few [9]. In our previous work, a fungal strain, Aspergillus terreus Li-20 was screened, which can use GL as a carbon source and produce GAMG and GA after catalysis by \u03b2-glucuronidase (AtGUS). The main disadvantages of AtGUS were low enzyme productivity, low catalytic efficiency, and pathogenicity, which rendered it unsafe for use in the food and medical industries.",

Several methods of designing new enzymes are available, and gene sequence truncation is also investigated for its effects on enzymatic properties. The non-conservative N-terminal domain of the protein phosphatase1 (PP1), with 1\u20138 residues deleted, showed higher sensitivity to three substrates and influenced the structure and properties of PP1 [10], whereas the truncation of the C-terminal region improved the thermal stability of endo-\u03b2-glucanase from Bacillus subtilis JA18 [11]. However, the loss of the C-terminal regulatory domain resulted in a loss of the ability to catalyze the aldol reaction [12].",

Bioinformatics characterization from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) showed that most \u03b2-glucuronidases belong to the glycoside hydrolase family (GHF) 2, and all of them consist of sugar-binding, immunoglobulin-like \u03b2-sandwich, and TIM barrel domains (triosephosphate isomerase, TIM) [13], [14], [15]. The TIM barrel domain, which is one of the most common catalytic domains, is adopted by about 10% of the enzymes; thus, sequence modification inside or outside the domain to improve the enzymatic property and determine the catalytic mechanism was reported in many studies. The site-directed mutagenesis of seven amino acids (aa) in the TIM barrel domain was performed to investigate the importance of the residue in the catalysis of an exo-\u03b2-d-glucosaminidase from Trichodema reesei\n[16]. Heparanase is an endo-\u03b2-d-glucuronidase, and its C-terminal region, which is not an integral part of the TIM barrel domain, is essential for the enzymatic activity and secretion of heparanase [17].",

Three fungal strains, namely, A. terreus Li-20, P. purpurogenum Li-3, and A. ustus Li-62, were screened in our previous studies and represented three modes of GL biotransformation: (1) GL\u2192GA+GAMG; (2) GL\u2192GAMG; and (3) GL\u2192GA [9]. The three \u03b2-glucuronidase genes were cloned in our laboratory, and the aa sequence alignment showed that the \u03b2-glucuronidase from A. terreus Li-20 (AtGUS) was quite different from the other two \u03b2-glucuronidases(PGUS and AuGUS) in C-terminal non-conservative sequence. AtGUS can hydrolyze GL into two products; thus, the different modes of GL biotransformation of the \u03b2-glucuronidases from the other two fungi may be related to the natural evolution in the sequence. In the present research, Atgus and the partial sequence [Atgus(-3t)] without C-terminal non-conservative sequence behind the TIM barrel domain were amplified in order to investigate effects of non-conservative sequence on enzymatic property.",

In addition, AtGUS(-3t)-E showed higher affinity and catalytic efficiency than AtGUS(-3t)-E. Both of the result might suggest that the spatial structural rearrangement, and the speculation has been proved by CD spectra, which showed great difference between the secondary structure of the two enzymes. It has been reported that the loops above the catalytic face was very important for substrate hydrolysis [23], so we can conclude that the truncation of the non-conservative domain firstly changed the secondary structure of the enzyme and then influenced the substrate affinity, catalytic efficiency and metal ions effects. Moreover, the crystal structure of human \u03b2-glucuronidase was firstly reported in 1996 [24], and the structure of bacterial \u03b2-glucuronidase has also been published recently [25]. Both \u03b2-glucuronidase structures were tetramers. The deleted region of the AtGUS non-conservative sequence lies outside the main three domains, so it was predicted that the non-conservative might change the combination pattern of each monomer.",

Some efforts have been made to modify the enzyme by directed screening but high ratio of negative mutated forms of enzyme in the initial screening is a big hurdle and requires further screening for positive mutated forms of enzyme. Every method has its own advantages and disadvantages that determines the feasibility of a particular method so as sequence truncation [10], [11], [12]. Based on the same hydrolyzing mode, relatively higher thermal stability, and especially the enhanced affinity and catalytic efficiency for GL, deletion of the non-conservative sequence behind the TIM barrel domain was a successful evolution of AtGUS. The truncation of non-conservative region based on sequence alignment could be an effective way of artificial enzyme evolution as it can alter and influence the stability and catalytic efficiency of enzyme, and could help in understanding the relationship between the structural modulation and enzymatic properties.",
