Notwithstanding the prevalence of PE, the pathogenesis of acid\u2010base disturbances of PE have not been well described. Three previous studies utilizing the Henderson\u2010Hasselbalch (HH) model yielded discordant results regarding the etiology of the acid\u2010base disease. One study reported lactate acidosis8 (with concomitant acidemia) as the predominate change, whereas in another study metabolic alkalosis was more commonly observed.9 A third study demonstrated mostly mixed acid\u2010base disorders with a neutral pH.6 In addition, in a retrospective study using the strong ion model (SIM), chloride and albumin were found to be important contributors to the metabolic acid\u2010base changes,5 but the retrospective nature of that study precluded the calculation of the anion gap (AG) and unmeasured anions (UA), and the authors were also unable to compare these findings to the HH model. The authors of that study concluded that the acid\u2010base changes of PE were complex and multifactorial and conjectured that they would be incompletely explained by the HH model.5 The HH model summarizes the metabolic compartment in the HCO3\u2212 deflection from normal, which might be influenced by: metabolic acidosis/alkalosis or by the reciprocal compensation to primary changes in pCO2. Therefore, mixed disorders might be concealed within a modest deviation of HCO3\u2212 that belies the true severity of a metabolic disorder. A paucity of data exists regarding the role of UA in veterinary medicine. UA are associated with a lethargic demeanor in calves,10 but studies in dogs are scarce. In humans there is a relationship between an increased strong ion gap (SIG) and elevated inflammatory cytokines, 11 but this has not been shown in veterinary patients. Increased UA correlates with death in humans 12, 13, 14 but in 1 retrospective study in dogs none of the acid\u2010base perturbations, including elevated UA, were considered to confer a prognostic advantage. 15 The purpose of the present study was to describe the acid\u2010base changes in PE using both the HH and SIM models, and to compare and contrast the findings.",

The diagnosis of PE was confirmed with a point\u2010of\u2010care sandwich ELISA (SNAP Parvo 2015, Idexx Laboratories, One Idexx Drive, Westbrook, Maine) in puppies that were unvaccinated and under 6 months of age. Venous blood (1 mL) was collected in heparinized blood gas syringes (BD A\u2010Line, arterial blood collection syringe, Becton, Dickinson and Company, UK) and blood gas was performed immediately by 2 of the coauthors (AL and RF) within 15 minutes of collection on a bench\u2010top blood gas analyzer (Rapidpoint 405 \u2010 Bloodgas, Siemens, PO Box 198 Isando 1600, South Africa).

However, this model has not been validated in dogs. It has been shown previously that there are key differences in acid\u2010base balance variables between dogs and humans, particularly with respect to the buffering properties of proteins19 and between the nomograms from which the base excess is derived20 (which is used to calculate UA). The comparator data used to generate the calculated acid\u2010base values for the AG and SIM data in the control dog group were derived from the mid\u2010normal reference values of the laboratory of the Department of Veterinary Clinical Pathology at the University of Pretoria. The effects of chloride, free water (sodium), albumin, phosphate, and lactate were calculated and summated (Table 3). The sum of effects (SOE) was subtracted from the base excess (BE) in order to determine the presence of UA. Each of the effects was correlated with pH and the SOE to assess the relationship of each metabolic component with the overall acid\u2010base changes. The number of dogs with changes in each of the aforementioned categories was quantified. To reach a final diagnosis, the chloride, sodium, and lactate effect were evaluated for changes in SID (alkalosis/acidosis), and the albumin and phosphate effect were summated to yield the Atot. The acid\u2010base changes according to the SIM were visually depicted as Venn diagrams. Lastly, to account for possible species differences in the BE (which could affect UA) the blood gas machine calculated BE was compared to the BEcorrected that was calculated using the Van Slyke21 equation (BE = 0.9287(HCO3\u2212 \u2010 24.4 mmol/L + 14.83 [pH \u20107.4]) using a pH 7.35 and a HCO3\u2212 of 23 mmol/L (based on our control dog data) as normal values (as opposed to 7.4 and 24.4 mmol/L).

Accordingly, the authors employed a model using experimentally validated data.19 Briefly, the strong ion difference was calculated as shown in Table 3, and the Atot was calculated using both albumin and total protein for comparison, because of the fact that globulins have been shown to contribute to the Atot to a greater extent than is seen in humans.19 Lastly, the SIG was calculated to detect the presence of UA for comparison, with the UA as determined by the FS approach. Four calculations for SIG were used for comparison, based on equations developed for use in canine plasma.19 It has been previously shown that there are significant differences between SIG when it is calculated using different equations.22 The data generated in the PE group were compared to the control dog data to arrive at an acid\u2010base diagnosis (Table 2). Using this model the following acid\u2010base diagnoses could be reached based on whether SID, Atot, and SIG were increased/decreased according to Table 3; SID acidosis/alkalosis, Atot acidosis/alkalosis, and the presence of UA acidosis as evidenced by an increase in the SIG. For the purposes of diagnostic comparison the SIG calculated from total protein was used, which factors a correction for pH into the equation.19\n",

We specifically chose PE as a disease model, due the diversity of expected perturbations to acid\u2010base homeostasis, which we suspected would have concomitant acidifying and alkalinizing effects, given the fact that diarrhea is often associated with acidemia,10, 28 and vomiting with alkalemia.29, 30 Based on previous work5 we anticipated changes in SID and Atot would be present, but we did not anticipate the presence of UA in severe acidemia as was documented in this study. In accordance with a previous study, using the FS, chloride was the most strongly associated with the SOE (P < .001; rho 0.79) but it was not significantly correlated with blood pH (Figure 3). These results infer the importance of chloride in the changes of the metabolic compartment according to the FS approach, but the lack of association with pH suggested that it was part of a complex and mixed process. Conversely, UA and free water were significantly correlated with blood pH (P = 0.03; rho 0.4 and P = .002; rho: \u22120.46 respectively). Interestingly, hyponatremia has been associated with acidemia in calves with diarrhea23 but not in dogs. In this study, free\u2010water acidosis was present in 22/42 cases (Figure 2). However, in 13/22 cases a concurrent hypochloremic alkalosis was also present, which would have a neutralizing effect on blood pH.",

The VDM detected fewer cases with acid\u2010base abnormities using the SID, Atot\u2010tp, and SIGtp alone. However, when the individual changes in chloride and sodium were scrutinized within the normal SID group, we were able to show that a concurrent hypochloremia (presumably from vomiting) and hyponatremia (presumably from diarrhea) tended to offset changes in the SID as determined by the SID3 and SID4. When the \u0394chloride and \u0394sodium were evaluated in dogs with normal SID (as calculated by the VDM), we were able to identify all of the cases that were judged to be abnormal according to the FS approach. We propose that when the VDM is used, clinicians are cognizant of neutralizing SID effects, and pay attention to the individual contributors of the SID when calculating this. We also propose that the VDM's diagnostic utility could be augmented by calculating the \u0394sodium and \u0394chloride in cases where concurrent changes might be present such as in PE. When UA were calculated using the FS approach and VDM equations, 11 cases were identified by the FS approach and the SIGalb. The SIGalb\u2010simplified identified 13 cases with increases in UA, and the SIGtp identified the fewest, with 5 cases judged to have increased UA. These results confirm the findings and conclusions of a previous study in healthy dogs20 that showed significant differences between SIG calculated using different equations, and emphasize the importance of using equations that have been validated for use in dogs. Further studies are necessary to determine which of these equations for SIG is the most appropriate to use in dogs in various disease processes. The fact that the VDM showed that an Atot acidosis was the most common change further emphasized the need to use a standardized approach with species\u2010specific data validation, as these were likely underestimated by the FS approach which is derived from human data. According to the HH model, metabolic changes were common, which would be expected given the severe biochemical insults associated with vomiting, diarrhea, and sepsis. Interestingly, in many of these cases, the bicarbonate was inappropriately normal (based on pH and CO2), or modestly changed, which would be expected in cases where concurrent acidotic and alkalotic processes are present. Our findings are further supported by a study in critically ill human patients, with normal HH acid\u2010base findings, in which the SIM unmasked profound mixed metabolic effects which were neutralizing.31 Blood lactate was not associated with acidemic pH in PE in contrast to the findings of a previous study.8 The HH model also detected fewer cases with acid\u2010base abnormalities than did the FS approach, but more cases than the VDM did (if \u0394sodium and \u0394chloride were ignored). This might be because of the fact that the FS approach is too sensitive. Acid\u2010base disturbances in normal human patients have been described using a strong ion approach32, 33 and thus it could be argued that in our study, the FS approach over\u2010diagnosed acid\u2010base disease. Conversely, it seems entirely plausible, given the subtle deflections in HCO3\u2212 seen in the face of egregious metabolic perturbations that we observed in this study that the HH model lacks sensitivity in PE where concurrent disturbances causing acidosis and alkalosis are present, as was seen in a previous study in humans.31\n",

The authors postulated that general weakness and hypermetabolic states34 (because of sepsis and fever) might have contributed to the development of respiratory acidosis. Furthermore, deviations in CO2 were not attributable to metabolic perturbations, because they were not in the range consonant with respiratory compensation inferring a true primary disorder in this compartment.

In particular UA, which are calculated using the base excess, which is derived from the Van Slyke equation21, 37 and nomograms that were developed from studies using human blood. It was assumed that the nomograms would be the same for other species, but it has been shown that the canine nomogram differs from that of humans.20 It could be argued that based on this previous study the BE in other species38 might provide inaccurate results. While it was not within the scope of this study to validate the FS model, we felt that by deriving our cutoffs for UA according to the FS from our control dogs that we somewhat overcame this limitation, as we would have expected that these mathematical variations would have been present in both groups, but we cannot be certain of this. The differences in BE estimation because of differences in dog blood or anticoagulant used are unlikely to be of clinical relevance within the physiological pH range.20, 39 Interestingly, as could be expected, we found that when control dog data were used in the BE calculation, there were significant differences between the BE and BEcorrected for the PE group that was less negative than the BE (using standard formulae) group (less acidic). This is consistent with previous findings,20 where dog blood was shown to be slightly acidic according to the BE nomogram at pH 7.4, but our results also seem to confirm that this is unlikely to be of clinical importance. Notwithstanding this finding, we feel this study emphasizes the importance of developing and using validated methodologies and species specific reference data for comparison.

However, the FS was by far the most cumbersome, time consuming, and required a deeper understanding of acid\u2010base physiology to apply. The VDM was the easiest model to apply and understand. The HH model can be challenging to interpret in complex disorders, especially for novice clinicians as acid\u2010base disease can be present in the face of normal HH values. Therefore, we believe that further work is needed to assess the clinical utility of the VDM in other disease models. Future studies should also focus to ascertain if there is any therapeutic or prognostic advantage in using the SIM in dogs. Of great interest would be to determine if in the population of HH \u201cnormal\u201d dogs identified with SIM acid\u2010base abnormalities, whether a SIM approach might serve as an early warning of impending homeostatic decompensation. We identified a number of limitations in our study. First, blood gases and acid\u2010base parameters are labile and proper sample handling is essential17 as variations in the type and amount of heparin used,40, 41 the presence of air bubbles42 improper sample mixing43 might affect the accuracy of the results obtained. While there is no clear gold\u2010standard device for blood gas analysis in veterinary medicine, bench top analyzers, that are used in reference laboratories, with daily quality controls and calibration that are used by trained laboratory personnel are likely to provide more consistent results than point\u2010of\u2010care analyzers.44, 45 Therefore, our data were collected and processed by a single experienced operator, using a bench top blood gas analyzer. A second limitation was the relatively small control dog size for data comparison. Establishment of a reference interval for this study with confidence levels would have been ideal. Reference intervals have already been established for dogs19, 46 and so the purpose of our control group was to ensure that the healthy dogs were within the limits of normal published values, and that our control dog data did not differ significantly from published ranges.",
