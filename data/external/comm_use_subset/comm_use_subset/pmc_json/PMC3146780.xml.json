Successful immunization campaigns have achieved eradication of smallpox and rinderpest (a viral disease of cattle) and poliomyelitis is close to worldwide elimination. In spite of these strides, infectious diseases still kill millions of people every year, with developing countries remaining particularly vulnerable. The development of a human vaccine from concept to licensure currently takes at least 15 years, while introduction plans for global deployment extend in most cases beyond 20 years, with coverage reaching no more than 80 per cent of the target population even in the best-case scenarios. These protracted timelines for much needed interventions against endemic infectious diseases come at a huge human cost and demand serious attention. Furthermore, the recent severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, the continuing risk of a pandemic of severe avian influenza and the recent H1N1 pandemic have reinforced the need for a rapid global response to pandemics. For these reasons, the international community needs to be able to develop and deploy new vaccines more rapidly than has been the case in the past. In aiming to identify a blueprint for accelerated vaccine development, experts considered the current status of vaccine platforms in various parts of the world, reviewed some of the constraints to more rapid development and deployment of vaccines, and finally considered how some of these constraints might be addressed.",

Investments in vaccine development have been very different for infectious diseases that affect both rich and poor countries, for example, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and human papillomavirus (HPV), compared with neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), which are exclusively endemic in low-income countries. Pharmaceutical companies are primarily focused on developing interventions for infectious diseases that affect industrialized nations, while investment in vaccines for NTDs has come largely from philanthropy, with most research and development (R&D) being undertaken by academic teams in alliance with a few product development partnerships (PDPs). While a huge investment in interventions for NTDs has already been made by charitable organizations such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, fear of lack of funding is reducing the size of the infectious diseases research community in some developed countries and weakening capacity for the exploratory and discovery activities that are key to identifying new interventions.",

The economies of China, India, South America, South Africa, Eastern Europe and the Middle East have risen in economic standing and many are investing substantially in state-of-the-art biomedical research infrastructures. These countries are placing substantial emphasis on the build-up of local scientific and technical expertise and are putting increasing resources into nurturing indigenous scientific talent. Pharmaceutical companies are increasingly seeking to manufacture vaccines in countries where the vaccines are to be marketed, leading to a number of productive partnerships between large multi-national companies like GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Pfizer, Sanofi Pasteur and innovative developing country (IDC) governments. As a result, the number of production units for manufacturing drugs and vaccines and international research institutes operating effectively in IDC has expanded. The Developing Country Vaccine Manufacturers' Network (www.dcvmn.com), established in 2005, is increasingly engaged with supplying vaccines at affordable prices through UNICEF tenders to meet the health needs of the poor.",

In contrast to IDC countries, technology transfer to sub-Saharan Africa, with the exception of South Africa, remains low and there is little to no capital support for vaccine R&D. A lack of investment in vaccine and drug manufacturing is resulting in the dismantling of the few pre-existing manufacturing centres\u2014a striking example being the loss of manufacturing capability that was set up in Nigeria for yellow fever vaccine. Given the positive examples of IDC countries, there is a major need to create and support regional centres of scientific and technical excellence in Africa. Programmes that support training of African scientists in partnership with international scientific centres and industry need to be encouraged through new and innovative means. Development agencies should be encouraged to invest in Africa to build capacity in infrastructure, with private and public investors as complementary pillars to that of international aid, and with African business players taking the lead in supporting technological advances that will serve the needs of their continent.",

However, complacency, which dilutes the infrastructure for vaccine development, is very risky, especially at a time when increased international travel, evolution of drug resistance, climate change and the threat of bioterrorism make the age-old battle of humans against infectious disease more challenging. The re-emergence of killer diseases such as drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in Western Europe provides a warning that wealthy nations are not immune to the diseases of the poor. A versatile knowledge base and more frequent flow of information and technology transfer between industry and academia, and between disease endemic regions and knowledge-based economies, are essential, if public health measures are to fulfil their potential to improve the lives of populations globally.",

Most infectious diseases for which vaccines are needed urgently are far from being \u2018easy targets\u2019 and thus accelerated early-phase testing of vaccine candidates developed using a variety of different approaches is necessary to identify efficacious candidates. In the exploratory phase, more rapid and high-throughput testing of new vaccine antigens and delivery platforms is essential to establish early proof-of-concept. Usually, interest in these endeavours is driven by academic groups, but currently most lack access to the long-term investment in infrastructure required to undertake translational studies into humans. Conversely, industry requires a high-level of confidence in technologies and formulations required for product development if it is to permit early \u2018at-risk\u2019 investment. Lack of knowledge regarding protective immune responses, and/or how these can be induced in humans, condemn many difficult and scientifically neglected infectious diseases to the \u2018too high risk\u2019 bracket. Industry generally prefers tried and tested delivery platforms for new vaccines as these can be more easily aligned with established manufacturing capabilities and a commercial target product profile (TPP). This alignment leaves little to no room for innovative but unvalidated vaccine delivery technologies, such as formulations with improved thermal stability or needle-free administration, to enter the product development path. How then can the accelerated testing of new technologies be integrated with new product development? Two main approaches were proposed. Veterinary vaccines could lead the way in validating the performance of new technologies, establishing the amenability of the technology to manufacturing scale-up and to meeting regulatory standards. This would be supported by the lower cost of obtaining efficacy data, usually with microbial challenge studies, in host animal species. The validation and regulatory approval of novel technologies for veterinary interventions could reduce the risk of embedding the new technologies and manufacturing platforms into the development of human vaccines. Alternatively, human vaccine developers could be more proactive in testing innovative formulations and delivering technologies during the development of improved second-generation products. The introduction of new technologies in such a manner could lead into innovative delivery and formulation approaches reaching routine immunizations over the course of time, and overcome the current situation where some innovative technologies lapse because they are not taken up by the industry.\n\n",

Similarly, manufacturing standards and production volumes should be tailored to assist early-phase vaccine development, making these endeavours more affordable and, most importantly, more high-throughput. The cost of good manufacturing practice (GMP) and associated quality control and quality assurance of experimental vaccines can be prohibitively high for academic groups and often similar standards are applied to small-scale manufacturing batches and manufacturing for market supply. The underlying high costs of GMP prevent important comparative testing of vaccine candidates in early-phase, proof-of-concept human clinical trials. An academic centre is fortunate if it secures sufficient funding to take even a single candidate vaccine through GMP manufacture and into a phase I clinical trial. It was stressed that suitable modifications of GMP standards could be identified that would not compromise safety, but could facilitate comparative testing of experimental vaccines. The use of single-product GMP production suites, or GMP labelling systems for experimental vaccines which are equivalent to labelling requirements for commercial vaccines were highlighted as two examples of requirements that could be adjusted for experimental vaccines to facilitate lower cost pilot GMP lot production. Utilization of new and more efficient vaccine production platforms, such as modular bioreactors and mobile clean rooms, could also help to meet this need in the future.",

This approach could lead to the accelerated deployment of new innovative technologies and the establishment of new GMP facilities. This principle is already gaining some acceptance as multiple vaccines based on the new DNA-based vectors are now licensed for veterinary use, including 12 recombinant viral-vectored vaccines as well as four DNA plasmid vaccines (table 1). In contrast, in the human field, the first vectored vaccine, a chimeric flavivirus against Japanese encephalitis, is only just reaching regulatory approval.\n",

Pharmaceutical companies have invested heavily in recent years to provide infrastructure that can cater for twenty-first century needs relating to antimicrobials, therapeutics, vaccines and diagnostics. In developed countries, designated facilities have also been established through public funds to address the needs of biodefence and the threat from newly emerging infectious and zoonotic diseases. It was suggested that similar multi-stakeholder, publicly funded, GMP facilities could be established to provide a cost-effective means to develop multiple, experimental vaccine candidates. These could potentially cater for a wide range of new generation vaccine delivery technologies and, importantly, could provide capacity for very rapid emergency vaccine manufacture in response to disease outbreaks\u2014a so-called model of \u2018PERManEnt facility\u2019 (Pandemic Emergency Response Manufacturing Enterprise) was proposed.

A significant difficulty for vaccine research in academia has been the lack of access to many of the promising adjuvants, developed by companies that have been unwilling to share these with external investigators. Greater ease of access to such adjuvants could significantly accelerate experimental vaccinology and expedite identification of preferred adjuvants for particular vaccines. Lack of access has prevented comparative testing of many adjuvant formulations both in pre-clinical and clinical studies, and has had a particularly adverse effect on vaccine development for diseases for which there is limited commercial interest and for which very strong immune responses are required for protection. In an attempt to remedy this problem, some non-profit organizations, with support from major funding agencies, have established a new Global Adjuvant Development Initiative (GADI) laboratory under the guidance of the World Health Organization (WHO), located at the University of Lausanne. GADI is supporting mechanisms to make adjuvants available to public-sector vaccine developers. It was stressed by delegates from industry that liability issues can prohibit the sharing of adjuvants used for commercial vaccines, but that some adjuvants which are in the R&D pipeline could be shared with academic and public-sector partners.",

Early alignment of key players in the process is essential, and this can help to establish a clear line of sight from product development to vaccine registration. Strides should be made to establish the TPP, essentially defining the \u2018label on the vial\u2019 from the outset, start pilot process development at the same time as R&D and instigate a process of small, rapid, parallel clinical trials to ascertain safety and efficacy in the target population, ideally also identifying a bioassay of vaccine efficacy. In order to expedite vaccine licensure, clinical testing should consist of \u2018rolling\u2019 phase I/II trials leading into a phase III trial in the minimum number of countries with all bioassays performed in a single reference laboratory. The clinical testing of Prevnar-13 in The Netherlands was highlighted as a best-practice example. If all these processes are aligned, candidate vaccines can be advanced to registration in 8\u201310 years (figure 2). It was noted that acceleration of the pathways that lead to product licensure will most probably require a larger set of post-licensure studies (e.g. of performance in special populations, extended safety, impact on other immunizations); however, this was viewed as a favourable strategy in the context of benefits arising from accelerated vaccine deployment.",

Many European farmers are unwilling to pay such high prices, leading to potential loss of vaccine demand or market \u2018pull\u2019 factors. This was contrasted to developing countries where, for example, the Maasai in East Africa are willing to pay relatively high prices for cattle vaccines (up to US$4), owing to their understanding that healthy livestock are a pathway out of poverty.

Identification of positive examples and dissemination of knowledge about the value obtained from successful industry\u2013academia\u2013public-sector partnerships can help in the design of new collective institutions or partnerships. The attendees emphasized that policymakers and funders need to find new ways to create the conditions needed for entrepreneurial, multilateral enterprises and then to initiate and fund them. In Europe, the Wellcome Trust has expanded its funding portfolio to include joint ventures between industry, academic groups and PDPs. The establishment of the MSD-Wellcome Trust Hilleman Laboratories in India in 2009 is a prime example of a research charity and a pharmaceutical company engaging in a joint venture with equally shared funding and decision-making rights to establish a research centre with a focus on developing vaccines for diseases of poverty. This partnership combines the ingenuity of academic research with the know-how of industry, aiming to integrate the best of both in setting up a research centre that operates like a business with product-focused goals, but with a not-for-profit financial model. This is a an ongoing experiment which, if successful, may encourage others to follow this direction and help to address the critical gap that results in promising experimental approaches not getting translated into health interventions because of low profitability. Another model of multiparty collaborative networks is the TRANSVAC infrastructure project (www.transvac.org), funded under the European Commission's 7th Framework Programme and coordinated by the European Vaccine Initiative (EVI), set up to create a cluster of knowledge and research infrastructure for the respective benefit of collaborative partners to have access to adjuvants, animal models, standardized reagents and assays, as well as microarray analysis. The experts recognized that there is a need for various stakeholders to commit knowledge, expertise and funds to ensure that these initiatives prosper.",

There was a consensus that communication and engagement with governments and healthcare workers in disease endemic regions should start as early as possible in vaccine development programmes. A multi-level model of stakeholder engagement needs to be developed, which takes into account the different needs of various target groups as well as any epidemiological changes that may take place during the 10\u201315 years of vaccine development. To better understand the needs of the end-users, emphasis was put on community engagement and the use of culturally appropriate informed consent for clinical studies. The demand for Halal certification to gain consumer confidence in the Middle East was used as an example to highlight the importance of an early appreciation of end-user expectations.",

The possibility of allowing countries to lodge applications for vaccines before pre-qualification was proposed as a means to accelerate vaccine availability. It was also emphasized that GAVI needs to engage with governments of developing countries to ensure that their national health budgets have provisions to support vaccination after GAVI subsidies end.

One proposal was put forward to set up independent vaccine information institutes as information dissemination centres committed to the improvement of public knowledge about vaccines. No matter how strong the science may be and how uniform the expert consensus, the general public will remain sensitive to alarms raised by anti-vaccination movements, and will be swayed by the opinions of friends, actions of their peers and the media. This needs to be accepted and responded to by teaming up independent and informed advisors with parents' groups, opinion leaders and media experts who can address any real or unfounded fears and explain the risks of vaccine apathy as well as vaccine use, adopting the spectrum of modern communication channels to which the younger generation is most amenable.",
