In 2008, rotavirus and measles virus caused the deaths of 570,000 children under the age of five, making them two of the leading killers of children worldwide [3]. In 2009, it was estimated that rotavirus infections alone result in $325 million in medical treatment costs and $423 million in societal costs each year [4]. Further, the implementation of many intervention strategies has either failed or been delayed as a result of the evolutionary dynamics of these pathogens [1], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9].",

We analyzed these rates as a function of seven factors related to virus genomic architecture (i.e., genome length, genome sense, and whether or not the genome is segmented) and virus ecology (i.e., target cell, transmission mode, host range, and whether the infection is acute or persistent). We also evaluated the relationships of viral substitution rates with dN/dS estimates, experimentally measured mutation rates, and estimated generation times. Though recombination undeniably plays a role in shaping viral evolutionary dynamics and could inflate substitution rate estimates [21], [22], we conservatively removed any potential recombinants from our datasets prior to analysis. Through this broad analysis, we were able to demonstrate that cell tropism, and its impact on viral generation time, has the greatest influence on rates of mammalian RNA virus evolution.",

Since these two cell types have some of the highest and lowest turnover rates, respectively, of all mammalian cells [33], [34], [35], [36], we sought to determine if there were any associations between host cell turnover rate and viral generation time. Using the model proposed by Sanju\u00e1n (2012) that relates the long-term substitution rate, K, to the mutation rate, \u03bc, correcting for transient deleterious mutations, we were able to estimate generation times for the few viruses with reliable mutation rate estimates. This model, , with ,  (G = genome length, g = generation time, sH = harmonic mean of the selection coefficient) [15], confirmed that influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and poliovirus, which target epithelial cells, have substantially shorter generation times (<40 hours) than hepatitis C virus, which targets hepatocytes (>200 hours). These results, while based on a very limited dataset, provide quantitative evidence for a link between cell tropism and generation time. Shorter average generation times lead to more rounds of replication per year, which could neatly explain higher per-year substitution rates.",

While positive selection can certainly result in variation among very short-term substitution rates, purifying selection tends to dominate over longer timescales [21], [45], [46], [47]. However, variation is observed in the strength of purifying selection due to differences in host ranges. For instance, as previously mentioned, viruses vectored by arthropods have unique evolutionary constraints placed on them by their host diversity [41], [42], [43], [48]. While previous studies found that arboviruses are under stronger purifying selection than non-arboviruses [1], [41], [49], we found that the dN/dS estimates based on structural genes of arboviruses were not significantly lower than those for non-arboviruses (P = 0.19). The dN/dS estimates based on non-structural genes of arboviruses were only moderately lower than those for non-arboviruses (P = 0.04). Further, we found no significant correlation between the estimated dN/dS and substitution rates, suggesting that detectable differences in selection pressures do not explain the variation in substitution rates of mammalian RNA viruses. To date, there are no data supporting a link between cell tropism and sustained differences in selection pressures.",

Weak negative correlations between genome lengths and viral substitution rates have been attributed to a relationship between mutation rate and substitution rate, as smaller genomes could in theory withstand higher mutation rates than larger genomes [13], [15], [50]. However, while differences in spontaneous mutation rates appear to be significantly correlated to the long-term substitution rates of DNA viruses [15], this linear relationship disappears past a certain mutation rate threshold: around 10\u22126 mutations per site per infectious cycle, the lower end of the mutation rate range of RNA viruses [13], [15]. It is, therefore, not surprising that we found no significant correlation between substitution rates and the available, reliable mutation rate estimates. Additionally, a recent study of the retrovirus HIV-1 found that infection of different cell types did not lead to differences in mutation rate [51], providing some evidence that mutation rate is not correlated with cell tropism. Together, these data suggest that mutation rate variation among different cell types is not driving higher substitution rates in epithelial-infecting mammalian RNA viruses.",

For example, viruses in the acute phase of an infection generally replicate more frequently than those in a persistent infection, and viruses in a latent phase do not replicate at all [39].

However, there is evidence that for at least some RNA viruses, viral genome replication is highly dependent on host cell proliferation, with RNA synthesis occurring at much lower rates in poorly proliferating cells than in rapidly dividing cells [56], [57], [58], [59], [60]. For example, it has been repeatedly demonstrated that hepatitis C virus genome replication is enhanced in proliferating cells, perhaps due to higher levels of available nucleotides [59], or because of higher levels of viral protein synthesis facilitated by nuclear translation initiation factors that only become available in the cytoplasm during cell division [58]. Similar dependence on cell proliferation for viral replication efficiency has been demonstrated in a number of picornaviruses [57], [60], [61], [62]. Further, using the model proposed by Sanju\u00e1n (2012), we found that viruses that infect epithelial cells have generation times that may be as much as 40-fold shorter than a virus that infects non-epithelial cells. This offers a possible mechanistic basis for our finding that viruses that target the fastest-dividing cells in the body (intestinal and respiratory epithelial cells [34], [35], [36], [63]) have higher substitution rates than viruses that infect cells that turnover at very low rates, if at all (neurons [33], [35], [64]).",

These results offer a new perspective on why it has been difficult to create effective vaccines for viruses that infect epithelial tissue, such as rotavirus and enterovirus 71 [65], [66]. Further, as it has been shown that higher rates of viral evolution can result in increased genetic diversity and higher epidemiological fitness [26], [67], [68], the higher substitution rates of epithelial-infecting viruses predict increased evolvability and greater potential for emergence in novel host species [21].",

            "text": "Long-term nucleotide substitution rates of mammalian RNA viruses were collected from the literature, with a focus on finding rates for the outer structural gene containing the major antigenic site(s) and non-structural (preferably the RdRp) genes. While the RdRp genes of the (-)ssRNA and dsRNA viruses are classified as structural, or virion-associated, genes [69], they are generally thought to be more conserved and under very different selection pressures than the structural genes that interact with the host immune system [70], [71]. We excluded retroviruses from analysis because they are known to have highly variable substitution rates due to time spent integrated into DNA genomes, where they evolve at the rate of their hosts' genome [13], [72]. Viruses that predominately infect non-mammals, with mammals serving as incidental, dead-end hosts, were also excluded. Only rates estimated for individual viral species or strains were used, not those that aggregated multiple species into one analysis. Similarly, only rates from single gene analyses were included, not those based on full genomes or multiple gene alignments. In order to minimize any rate discrepancies that could result from variations among datasets (e.g., number of taxa, temporal range, portion of gene analyzed) and/or subtle methodological variations [45], [73], [74], [75], [76], [77], only rates produced by Bayesian coalescent analyses of datasets composed of at least 30 taxa, isolated over a minimum range of 15 years and spanning at least 40% of the analyzed gene were included. Bayesian coalescent analyses provide estimates of viral evolution that are calculated over a longer range than simply the date range over which the taxa were isolated. This is because they determine the likely phylogenetic relationship among the isolates and infer substitution rates over the entire evolutionary history of the sampled taxa: over decades, hundreds, even thousands of years. These rates can therefore be considered \u201clong-term\u201d nucleotide substitution rates.",

The best-fitting clock/demographic model combination for each dataset was determined using Bayes factors as implemented in Tracer v1.5 [85]. For each best set of priors, two independent runs were performed to ensure that the results were replicable, and a control analysis was run without the dataset to ensure that the priors were not controlling the outcome of the analysis.",

For each variable, different base levels were tested to ensure that the chosen base level did not significantly influence the results. Collinearity among the variables was also assessed, with variance inflation factors (VIF) greater than 10 indicating redundancy among variables. Separate ANCOVA analyses were run on the structural and non-structural gene datasets. As there were multiple published rates for some viral species and strains, additional analyses were run for both the S and NS datasets with only one substitution rate per virus species.
