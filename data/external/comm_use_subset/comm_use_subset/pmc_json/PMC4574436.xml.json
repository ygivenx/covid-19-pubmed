            "text": "In the western United States Ixodes pacificus ticks are the vector of Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease [1,2]. I. pacificus ticks are also vectors for several other vector-borne pathogens including Borrelia miyamotoi and Anaplasma phagocytophilum. In addition, I. pacificus ticks have been shown to carry Spiroplasma ixodetis [3], a microorganism that has no known role in human disease. Broad-range PCR and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) can detect multiple pathogens in a single test including tick-borne pathogens [4\u201314]. PCR/ESI-MS can also detect novel and uncharacterized organisms [10,12,15\u201319]. We have previously used PCR/ESI-MS to characterize a large collection of ticks, including I. pacificus ticks from California, for the prevalence of B. miyamotoi [6]. Most studies of I. pacificus ticks have employed tests designed to detect single pathogens and not co-infections. In this study we used PCR/ESI-MS to characterize the breadth of microorganisms carried by I. pacificus collected from throughout the state of California. In the ticks analyzed, we detected several previously described endemic zoonotic pathogens as well as Babesia odocoilei, a protozoan not previously known to be carried by I. pacificus. Many of the microbes carried by ticks are obligate intracellular microbes and have not been cultured but have been identified and characterized genetically such as \u2018Candidatus Rickettsia andeanae\u2019, \u2018Candidatus Rickettsia vini\u2019 and \u2018Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis' [20\u201323]. In our study we identified and genetically characterized a novel and widespread Anaplasmataceae species which is genetically most closely related to isolates from Asia.",

Depending upon the organism(s) present in the sample the resulting amplicons will be comprised of differing composition of bases (the number of A\u2019s, G\u2019s, C\u2019s and T\u2019s aka base count). When these amplicons are analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry the base count of the amplicons can be determined and compared to a database to identify the organism(s) present. Nucleic acid extracts from ticks were screened for tick-borne microorganisms with three variations of a broad-range PCR/ESI-MS assay (Table 1). Primer set A includes 16 primer pairs designed to detect and identify a wide and diverse range of bacterial species. Primer set B includes two primer pairs designed to detect all Babesia species [5]. Primer set C consists of nine primer pairs designed to detect a wide range of bacterial and protozoan tick-borne pathogens that were previously described [5]. PCR amplicons were analyzed by electrospray ionization followed by time of flight mass spectrometry system (Abbott Laboratories, Des Plaines IL) as previously described [10,13,14,24\u201327].",

All ticks were visually pre-identified as I. pacificus, and the species was confirmed in 96.9% of the ticks tested by the detection of the Rickettsia endosymbiont of I. pacificus [10]. No ethical clearance was required to conduct research on invertebrate ectoparasites. All samples were submitted by private collectors or collected by county vector control agencies from locations that did not require specific permission. These studies did not involve endangered or protected species. Ticks were either alive, frozen, or ETOH preserved prior to DNA extraction using a modified Qiagen column-based protocol described previously [28] with the substitution of the Qiagen DNAeasy columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) for the Qiagen Virus MinElute columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). A negative extraction control consisting of lysis buffer was included with each set of extractions and carried through the analysis to monitor for potential contamination.",

The 16S rRNA, groEL, gltA, and rpoB genes were sequenced by single molecule real-time DNA sequencing using the RS II DNA sequencer (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park CA). In addition, a tick positive for A. phagocytophilum from Placer County, CA was also selected for sequence analysis. The previously published primer pair 27F/1492R was used to amplify a 1,459-bp region of the 16S rRNA gene [29]. The groEL gene was amplified using a primer pair targeting an 851-bp region of the groEL gene present in Anaplasma, \u2018Candidatus Neoehrlichia\u2019, and Ehrlichia species (F-groEL: ATCTCTAAAGCTAAAGCTGCTGG and R-groEL: ACACCAACCTTAAGTACAGCAAC). The gltA gene was amplified using a primer pair derived from the published F4b-R1b primer pair [30] (F-gltA: ACCGGGTTTTATGTCTACTGC and R-gltA: CACGATGACCAAAACCCAT). The rpoB gene was amplified using primers designed to amplify a 600\u2013650-bp region across Rickettsiales (F-rpoB: ATCGTTCCTGTTGAAGATATGCC and R-rpoB: GCAATGCCCAGCATTCCAT). PCR amplification of the target genes was performed in a 50-\u03bcL reaction with 1 unit of Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase High Fidelity, 1x High Fidelity PCR Buffer, 2 mM MgSO4, 0.2 mM dNTP mix, and 250 nM of each primer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). All PCR amplification reactions were performed on the MJ Dyad thermocycler (Bio-Rad Inc., Hercules, CA). The following PCR conditions were used to amplify the 16S rRNA gene locus: 94\u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 s, annealing at 47\u00b0C for 30 s, and 68\u00b0C for 2 min for cycle extension. The cycle ended with a final extension of 4 min at 68\u00b0C. Amplification of the groEL and gltA loci was performed using the same conditions with the exceptions of a 50\u00b0C annealing temperature and a 1.5-min cycle extension time. PCR amplification of the rpoB locus was performed as described for the groEL and gltA loci except that a 1-min extension time was used. PCR products from each sample were purified using the Qiagen MinElute PCR Purification Kit. After purification, libraries were prepared using 500 ng of amplicons and a modified version of Pacific Biosciences library preparation protocol that consisted of end-repair, adapter ligation, and exonuclease treatment of the PCR amplicons. The final sequencing library was purified using the Qiagen MinElute PCR purification kit. One SMRT cell was used to sequence each amplicon library following diffusion loading. Sequencing data were analyzed using Pacific Bioscience\u2019s RS_Long_Amplicon_Analysis.1 protocol in the SMRT Analysis v2.2.0 software package to cluster, error correct, filter out chimeras, and build consensus sequences. Sequences were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers KP276585 to KP276611.",

Sequence alignments were generated using ClustalW and were manually curated using secondary structure pairing constraints with Bioedit software [31] (S1, S2, S3 and S4 Alignments) to yield, after exclusion of the primer sequences and non-conserved indels, ungapped alignments for 16S rRNA (1,347 bp, N = 26 sequences), groEL (804 bp, N = 23), gltA (720 bp, N = 23) and rpoB (555 bp, N = 19) (S1, S2, S3 and S4 Text). Identity score matrices were generated with Bioedit from the curated alignments (S1, S2, S3 and S4 Data). Phylogenetic analyses were performed using the online program suite at www.Phylogeny.fr using the \u201cA la Carte\u201d menu [32] on the curated alignments.

Borrelia miyamotoi was found in 2% of the ticks tested, which we have previously reported [6]. Borrelia burgdorferi was found in 1.4% of the ticks, consistent with infection rates that have been reported by others [36]. In this study, Anaplasma phagocytophilum was detected in only 3 of the 982 ticks tested. Two of the A. phagocytophilum-positive ticks came from the same site in Placer County and the third detection was in a B. burgdorferi co-infected tick from Marin County. Spiroplasma ixodetis was found in 2% (16/770) of the ticks tested using the primer set that detects this organism. In addition to the Rickettsia endosymbiont of I. pacificus, 37 ticks tested yielded a PCR/ESI-MS base count signature similar, but not identical, to that of a spotted fever group Rickettsia species (Table 3). Though these signatures are highly consistent with one or more Rickettsia species, further analysis is needed to confirm the identity.",

The bacterium was detected in ticks collected throughout the state with detections in ticks collected in Aliso & Wood Canyons Wilderness Park in Orange County and at Patrick Creek in Del Norte County in the far northern part of the state. The PCR/ESI-MS signature of this novel bacterium was similar to that of A. phagocytophilum (Table 3). Given the breadth of coverage provided by the primer pairs used in the PCR/ESI-MS assay, this signature is consistent with the detection of a novel Anaplasmataceae species. Three representative tick samples containing this signature (samples CP-1, MR-9, and CC-14 from Napa, Placer, and Marin Counties, respectively) were selected for DNA sequence analysis. We also selected for sequencing one of the three ticks positive for A. phagocytophilum (sample MR-23 from Placer County) for sequencing.

The split of Anaplasma species into two branches is also shown in the 16S rRNA, groEL and gltA trees, where all named Anaplasma species are represented [38]. Minor differences are observed within the exact branching order of species within the established clades, in particular for A. bovis [39]. Each tree firmly places the novel Anaplasmataceae microorganism on the branch leading to the Anaplasma clade [37]. The four gene sequences of the A. phagocytophilum isolate (MR-23) had 99.4% to 100% identity to the A. phagocytophilum genome sequence (GenBank NC_007797). The observed deviations from the reference genome sequence in the 16S rRNA gene (1 SNP) and gltA (2 SNPs) were shared with independent sequences of California isolates of A. phagocytophilum (AF172167, AF304137), suggesting that these differences are mostly likely unique to isolates from California.",
