Because of the fleeting herd immunity characteristic of flu, such models typically use a deterministic compartmental disease model, in which individuals move from susceptible, to infectious, to recovered, and once again become susceptible (SIRS). For seasonal flu, which appears in the northern hemisphere every winter and virtually disappears during the summer months, the subtlety involved in modeling relates to the way seasonality is introduced, and how that seasonality may vary for different strains of the virus.9-11 Predictions of upcoming flu seasons are critical to vaccine development but remain imprecise.",

The first model (a control) assumed no differences between the 2 strains; the second allowed for different transmission rates; and the third expanded to include different background transmission and flu season length. Using STEM's automated experiment (Nelder-Mead) plug-in,14 the project team cross-validated the models by fitting them to the historic data for a subset of the 10 years and then attempting to predict the incidence for the remaining years. Results showed the second model, which accounted for variations in transmission, increased the predictive ability for both strains, while the third model did not.",

In 3 weeks, influenza accounted for 90,000 visits to 220 health units and 20 hospitals in Mexico City.11 The mayor's response, controversial at the time, was to implement social distancing measures, closing schools on April 24 and restaurants on April 28. All were reopened by May 11. When de-identified lab data became available, the Mexico City government collaborated with scientists at IBM Research to determine whether the actions taken had in fact limited the spread of the H1N1 virus.15 Using the model validated in the Israeli study, the team ran repeated global simulations, with air travel, using STEM's automated experiment feature. The transmission rate was fit based on the confirmed 2009 H1N1 incidence data for Mexico City and New York (see Figure 1). The differential equations in the SIRS model were solved using STEM's implementation of an adaptive integration algorithm,16 allowing the team to specify a high level of precision. Each simulation explored combinations of epidemiologic parameters, widely studied and reported elsewhere, automatically reducing the parameter step sizes until the solution approached a fit with the local minimum. The analysis determined an average reproductive number based on the values of those parameters over the 28 days between April 13 and May 10, the major epidemic wave.",

Their goal was to identify, prepare for, and respond to all sorts of uncertainties during the H7N9 outbreak in the absence of real-time reporting data. Collaborating with domain experts and scholars of avian influenza in China, the STEM team built a preliminary avian influenza model22 using the common parameter values of avian influenza to answer 2 main concerns. First, if the outbreak of H7N9 establishes sustained bird-to-human transmission, what would be the spatial diffusion pattern of H7N9 and the estimated number of epidemic size (peak infection size, total infections)? Second, if human-to-human transmission is established due to virus mutation, what would be the distribution of disease transmission, and what would be appropriate response strategies for the CCDC?",

For example, if no effective intervention to control the disease is in place should human-to-human transmission become possible, a rough estimated total of infections in China is in the millions. Using the same model and altering particular parameter values would allow public health agencies to make quantitative evaluations of other scenarios for response planning and comparison. In an attempt to develop risk maps for the CCDC, the team ran the model deterministically and stochastically; however, the accuracy of the estimates depends on the data used to calibrate the model, such as accurate and high-resolution population density data, which were not available during the modeling practice.",

In the past 50 years, dengue incidence has increased 30-fold in tropical areas,27 a concern in a time of climate change. The threat is compounded by the fact that immunity is life-long for only the strain responsible for the infection; cross immunity for the other 3 strains is partial and temporary.28 Moreover, reinfection with a different strain carries greater risk of life-threatening complications resulting from antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) with increased risk of hemorrhagic fever.26,29,30",

In this project, individuals arrived at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, the fifth busiest airport in the United States and a common entry point from many international air routes. The number of passengers was varied and modeled to determine the effects of the number of initial cases. Two initial case scenarios were modeled: first, the index case to determine the effect when only 1 passenger is infected, and, second, 10 initial cases, demonstrating passengers with possible in-flight disease transmission or multiple passengers arriving from an outbreak area.",
