A virus was suspected as one possible cause because of virus-like particles in electron microscopic examination of stool from an affected animal, but traditional diagnostic approaches, including virus isolation, failed to identify a candidate viral pathogen. Virochip screening suggested that an astrovirus was present, and subsequently the complete genome was recovered and characterized. Recently, the partial genome sequence of a related virus was recovered from rabbits in Italy\n[22]. The astroviruses form a diverse family of viruses that infect many animals, and metagenomic investigations such as the one described here will continue to reveal the full extent of their diversity and host range.",

The predominant rabbit breeds were angora, satin and mini rex. No changes in diet had occurred in 1.5 years. The rabbits were housed outdoors, on the ground, in an enclosure measuring 8 x 20 feet with an attached hutch. The owner reported voles in the area. Characteristics of the outbreak included a 1\u20136 day history of lethargy, bloating and diarrhea, followed by death. Initially, animals under 5 months old were affected (~15 in the first 2 weeks), then the adults were affected (~75 over the next 3 weeks). Consistent clinical signs included lethargy, dehydration, increased intestinal sounds with intestinal gas (bloating) and cecal impaction with mucoid diarrhea. Severe intestinal coccidiosis (Eimeria spp.) was identified and the entire colony was placed on sulfamethazine in the water (Sulmet, 12.5%, Fort Dodge). Necropsy findings on seven rabbits (2 dead on arrival, 5 euthanized) were all consistent with mucoid enteropathy and cecal impaction. (Table\n1) At necropsy, common gross findings within the intestinal tract included mucoid intestinal contents (5/7), cecal impaction (4/7), serosal hemorrhage (4/7) and gastrointestinal gas distention (4/7). Microscopically, common findings included lymphoplasmacytic enteritis (5/7), necrotizing heterophilic enterotyphlocolitis (2/7), intestinal coccidiosis (5/7), and gastric or cecal candidiasis (2/7). In addition to the intestinal coccidiosis identified in all animals tested, one rabbit had hepatic coccidiosis (Eimeria stediae), two had Trichuris spp., and 4 of 5 small intestinal cultures grew E. coli that was found not to be an attaching effacing E. coli. 30 nm virus-like particles were observed by electron microscopy in the stool of 1 of 2 animals tested (Figure\n1 and Table\n1). Follow-up PCR-based testing determined that this virus was not Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus. Initial attempts to isolate virus from 2 samples in tissue culture were unsuccessful.",

This produced 3x106 sequences of median length 125 nucleotides (standard deviation 17.5). The average Sanger quality score of these sequences was 19.5 at base 1, 17.3 at base 100, and 14.4 at base 150, quality values consistent with previously reported metrics for this sequencing platform\n[42]. Insertions and deletions, which occurred at a frequency of 1.3% (1.3 indels per 100 bases aligned), were more frequent than mismatches, which occurred at a frequency of 0.28%. Retrospective mapping of the sequences revealed that 1.9\u00d7105 unique sequences (6% of sequences) derived from the astrovirus, corresponding to >1000x average coverage of its genome (Figure\n2). The PRICE de novo targeted assembly software (Graham Ruby,\nhttp://derisilab.ucsf.edu/software/price/) was used to assemble the entire viral genome, the sequence of which was validated by RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing (Figure\n2). 5\u2032 RACE was used to confirm that the Ion Torrent-based assembly extended to the 5\u2032 terminus of the genome (Figure\n2). The remainder of the reads in the metagenomic dataset consisted mainly of sequences derived from bacteria (~76% of taxonomically assigned reads), with the Escherichia, Akkermansia, Clostridium, Salmonella, Enterobacter, and Shigella genera being most prevalent. 56 sequences (0.002% of all sequences) aligned best to Eimeria species, consistent with the clinical diagnosis of coccidiosis (Table\n1). A small percentage (0.4%) of human sequences were also evident in the data. These were likely laboratory contaminants, as the majority of them aligned to the breast cancer 1 and 2, early onset genes (BRCA1 and BRCA2), and targeted sequencing of these genes was conducted in the laboratory where the sequencing libraries were prepared. Library contamination was also the likely source of 27 reads with nucleotide sequences nearly identical to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) database sequences.",

It is possible that the subgenomic RNA is present is at higher levels in infected cells than in extracellular virus particles, which are likely the source of the filtered material sequenced. The region defined by the first 70 amino acids of the ORF2-encoded protein is basic, with a predicted isoelectric point of 13.3. This is consistent with related astrovirus proteins, in which this domain has been reported to be involved in nucleic acid binding\n[55]. The N-terminal ~450 amino acids of the capsid protein align by BLAST with other astrovirus capsid proteins, but no recognizable protein domains are contained in the C-terminal 400 amino acids, and the latter half of the protein exhibits a much lower degree of sequence similarity to other astrovirus proteins sequences (Figure\n2). This is in agreement with the model that the N-terminal half of astrovirus capsid polyproteins form a conserved core domain and the C-terminal halves of the proteins are highly variable receptor interacting domains\n[62].
