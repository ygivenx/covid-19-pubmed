Clinical signs in infected sheep included depression, fever, nasal discharge, submandibular edema, and crusted discharge around the nostrils.

Additional 2 samples, one newborn calf and one placenta from case of abortion in sheep, were found positive to in-house conventional RT-PCR unveiling Israeli BTV-4 strain in the both cases. One whole blood sample from sheep and 2 samples from cattle (one whole blood and one spleen samples), were contemporaneously positive for BTV-3 and BTV-4 in specific RT-qPCRs. All samples positive for BTV-4 were received between March and December 2018, while all samples positive for BTV-3 were received between August and December 2018. No BTV-8 positive samples were found in 2018 (Table 2).",

For the next several decades, no evidence of BTV-3 circulation was reported. BTV-3 circulation has been recently reported in Tunisia, Egypt and Italy. Even though detected either in goats or cattle (7, 38, 54) in these countries clinical signs associated to BTV-3 infection were observed and described in sheep only (7, 38, 39). According to the retrospective findings of this study, during 2013\u20132017 BTV-3 outbreaks were restricted to Negev Desert area, in the southern district, while in 2018 it spread among most coastal and some central areas of Israel (Figure 1, Table 3). An additional difference between 2018 and 2013\u20132017 BTV-3 outbreaks was the exposure of Israeli goats and cattle in 2018 outbreaks. In this year, in fact, BTV-3 infection was occasionally associated with BT typical and atypical clinical signs, occurrence which was never observed before either in Israel or in the Mediterranean region (7, 38, 54). These events may imply an increased infectivity and pathogenicity of the BTV-3 Israeli strains circulating in 2018 or/and their adaptation to the local vectors. However, because of the exiguous number of samples from diseased and clinically healthy animals received from the BTV-3 affected farms, it was hard to estimate the real exposure of ruminants and real effect BTV-3 infection on these animals. In Israeli goats and cattle, making any conclusion regarding the role of BTV-3 in causing illness and death was even harder due to involvement of different bacterial and viral agents in the clinical cases or to the absence of bacterial and toxicological investigations in some fatal cases. According to what observed in this survey, all Israeli BTV-3 strains were definitely capable of inducing classical manifestations of BT disease in sheep. These symptoms were more severe in case of BTV mixed infections (BTV-3 and BTV-4, BTV-6, or BTV-8). Notably, cases of acutely affected animal showing classical BT clinical signs were seen in one sheep farm during two-month period and confirmed by successful virus isolation. This fact illustrated presence of newly infected animals and probably infected vector during prolonged period during two seasons 2017 and 2018 (farms number 4 and 9, Table 4).",
