Chest radiography was performed on all patients admitted to the hospital, and radiographic interpretation was performed for all cases by radiologists. Chest CT scan was also taken 1327 (92.9%) cases among all CAP. Additional laboratory investigations were performed based on the results of a routine blood test. Sputum samples were collected for bacterial culture preparation at admission and during hospitalization. Blood cultures were also performed when indicated. Pneumonia severity index (PSI) consisted four parts, demographics including age and sex, co-morbidity, physical examination, and laboratory findings [3].

Due to viral endothelial cell damage and other mechanisms, there is increased concern for bacteremia after viral infection [27\u201329]. Therefore, it can be assumed that in the setting of respiratory virus infection, prognosis might be affected by the 2ndary bacterial infection. The rate of positive bacterial respiratory cultures for patients with virus-detected and virus non-detected CAP remained the same. In this study, 25% of sputum positive bacterial cultures occurred in patients with virus-detected CAP, and was similar or slightly higher than in previous studies.[30, 31] The frequency of blood stream bacterial infection was 10%, and there was no bacteremia rate differences between virus-detected and virus non-detected CAP.
