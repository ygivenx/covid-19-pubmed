In Senegal, the National Influenza Center located in the Pasteur Institute of Dakar (IPD) was established in 1974 and has been part of the Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN) coordinated by the World Health Organization (WHO) since 1996 [2]. The WHO GISN provides virological information used in the process of selecting strains for the production of influenza vaccines [3]. Indeed, until 2011, the major aim of the Senegalese influenza surveillance had traditionally been to identify the predominant circulating strains in the community, and specifically in Dakar [2].",

Indeed, the presence of influenza in Africa has been confirmed, but the impact of the disease has not been established [7]. Data describing the seasonality and epidemiology of influenza in tropical areas are limited [4], [5], [8]. Surveillance is required for non-specific indicators, such as visits to health-care centers for influenza-like illness or hospitalization for pneumonia, to provide an indication of the total disease burden.

Data were collected in an objective of surveillance and are anonymous. The information provided to participants was an informal description of the study. Respiratory specimens were collected, only after informed consent was granted, verbally, to local health care workers by the patients or parents in the case of minors. Oral consent was documented in the patient form with two questions about received information and about oral consent. Patients could refuse to participate, no specimen will be taken. For the surveillance activities, written consent is judged not necessary by the Senegalese national ethics committee, which has also previously approved the work of the National Influenza Center [11]. Collections of non-sensitive data or an observation from normal care in which participants remain anonymous do not require ethics committee review.

However, none of the indicators are accurate measures of incidence. Indeed, although the new tools used by the 4S network since 2011 are convenient, the 4S network is still not yet able to evaluate the relative contribution of influenza and other respiratory viruses to disease burden, or child or adult mortality. Consequently, the influenza surveillance in Senegal could be improved by collecting complementary data. In particular, mortality data and more accurate incidence data would help assessments of the impact of influenza and the design of appropriate preventive strategies. Until such data are available, it difficult to justify the widespread use of influenza vaccine or other influenza control measures. Nevertheless, the health burden associated with influenza may be far greater in Africa than in developed countries, due to co-circulating tropical disease, immunosuppression and malnutrition [15]. Thus, the next step of the 4S network will be to collect data corresponding to hospital admissions for acute respiratory infection (ARI) and to ARI mortality. Hospital-based sentinel surveillance can provide substantial insights into the contribution of influenza infection to the global burden of disease [3]. A clear understanding of the epidemiology of severe influenza-associated disease is essential for decisions about vaccine recommendations.",

As in Madagascar [16], [17], pathogenic respiratory viruses were present in more than 70% of the samples collected from cases of ILI, and the involvement of non-influenza viruses was substantial: adenoviruses (22%), rhinoviruses (19%) and enteroviruses (15%) were the non-influenza viruses most frequently found. In Madagascar[16], HMPV (25%) and RSV (21%) were the most common viruses after influenza viruses. In Tunisia [18], the most common non-flu pathogen circulating in three seasons causing the lower respiratory tract infections especially in children was RSV (45%) but others viruses were also identifed: adenoviruses (20%) during season 2008\u20132009 or rhinoviruses (44%) during season 2009\u20132010. In 2009 in Cameron [19], influenza virus and rhinovirus were the most commonly detected viruses. All these results emphasises the importance of countries being able to test for a suite of respiratory pathogens, not just influenza. However, further investigations are necessary for a better understanding of the annual circulation profile of these different respiratory viruses. Besides, the difference between sampling percentages according with age group shows the difficulty to analyze alone virological data, and highlights the need to link virological and epidemiological data to improve the sentinel surveillance systems.",
