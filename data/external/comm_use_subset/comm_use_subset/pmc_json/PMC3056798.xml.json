Phenotypes associated with mutations of SLC26A4 include deafness at birth and fluctuating hearing loss that progresses toward deafness during childhood [6], [7], [8]. Deafness is associated with balance dysfunction in a subset of patients [9]. The high incidence of this disorder provides a strong imperative to investigate the etiology of the disease with the ultimate goal to develop strategies to preserve hearing in afflicted individuals.",

Studies using this mouse model have revealed that key events in the etiology of deafness are an acidification and enlargement of the membranous labyrinth that includes a \u223c10-fold enlargement of the cochlear lumen [12], [13], [14], [10]. The enlargement of the cochlea lumen begins at embryonic day (E) 14.5, which is \u223c19 days before the onset of hearing at postnatal day (P) 12 [12], [13], [14]. The enlargement is the result of fluid secretion in the vestibular labyrinth that \u2018pumps up\u2019 the cochlea and a failure of fluid absorption in the endolymphatic sac that \u2018drains\u2019 the cochlea at this age [14]. The enlargement and the acidification spread the effect of lacking pendrin-expression from affecting solely pendrin-expressing cells themselves to affecting a multitude of other cells in the cochlea and vestibular labyrinth, thereby ultimately leading to a failure to develop proper hearing and vestibular function.",

            "text": "The question how lack of pendrin affects fluid transport in the embryonic inner ear is complicated by the fact that pendrin is expressed in multiple epithelial cell types that are located in small domains throughout the inner ear. Based on studies in adult mice, pendrin is expressed in the cochlea in outer sulcus and spiral prominence epithelial cells and in spindle cells of stria vascularis [15], [16]. Further, pendrin is expressed in the vestibular labyrinth in transitional cells of the saccule, utricle, and ampullae and in the mitochondria-rich cells of the endolymphatic sac [15], [16], [17]. The onset of pendrin expression and the onset of pH changes associated with a lack of functional pendrin are important toward an understanding of the role of pendrin in fluid transport. Thus, the first goal of the present study was to determine the onset of pendrin expression in different parts of the inner ear, including the cochlea, saccule, utricle, ampullae, and endolymphatic sac and to determine the onset of pH changes that occur in the cochlea and endolymphatic sac when functional pendrin expression is present or lacking.",

            "text": "Loss of functional pendrin expression leads to an enlargement of the membranous labyrinth that displaces mesenchymal cells that normally surround the epithelial duct. This displacement impairs mesenchymal-epithelial cell communication including cochlear thyroid hormone signaling, which is important for the early postnatal development of the cochlea. Disruption of cochlear thyroid hormone signaling in Slc26a4\u2212/\u2212 mice leads to cochlear hypothyroidism in the early postnatal phase of development [13]. The enlargement of the cochlea lumen may not only disrupt communication between mesenchymal and epithelial cells but may also disrupt cell signaling between adjacent epithelial cells. Stretching of epithelial cells can be expected to lengthen diffusional distances, which would dampen or delay the arrival of diffusional signals. Normal cochlear development depends on cell-to-cell communication. Loss of cell-to-cell communication, i.e. due to lack of connexin 26 expression, leads to retarded development and failure to acquire hearing [18], [19], [20]. Impairment of cell signaling and disruption of proper orchestration of development may also be a cause for the failure to develop hearing and balance in mice and possibly in humans lacking pendrin expression. Thus, the second goal of this study was to determine the onset of epithelial cell stretching in the cochlea and the endolymphatic sac and to determine which epithelial cell types are stretched in the cochlea and the vestibular labyrinth of mice lacking functional pendrin expression.",

In the cochlea, apical surface areas of strial marginal cells, outer sulcus epithelial cells, and Reissner's membrane epithelial cells were enlarged in Slc26a4\u2212/\u2212 mice compared to Slc26a4+/\u2212 mice (Fig. 7A\u2013C and I). In contrast, apical surface areas of inner and outer hair cells were similar and not different between Slc26a4+/\u2212 and Slc26a4\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 7D and I). In the vestibular labyrinth, apical surface areas of transitional cells in the utricle and saccule were enlarged in Slc26a4\u2212/\u2212 mice compared to Slc26a4+/\u2212 mice, however, similar to the cochlea, apical surface areas of hair cells did not differ between Slc26a4+/\u2212 and Slc26a4\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 7E\u2013F and J). The epithelium of the endolymphatic sac in Slc26a4+/\u2212 was heavily folded and included tubular protrusions, as shown in Fig. 4J. In contrast, the epithelium in Slc26a4\u2212/\u2212 mice was planar due to cell stretching caused by the enlargement. Mitochondria-rich cells that expressed pendrin in Slc26a4+/\u2212 mice were distinguished from ribosome-rich cells in Slc26a4+/\u2212 and Slc26a4\u2212/\u2212 mice by their dense actin expression near the apical membrane (Fig. 7G).

At E14.5, connexin 26 was expressed in gap junction plaques in K\u00f6lliker's organ and in outer sulcus epithelial cells. The expression pattern at this age was similar in Slc26a4+/\u2212 and Slc26a4\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 8A and B). At E16.5, the region of connexin 26 expression in K\u00f6lliker's organ became distinct from the region of in outer sulcus epithelial cells (Fig. 8C and D). Cell height of outer sulcus epithelial cells was lower in Slc26a4\u2212/\u2212 mice compared to Slc26a4+/\u2212 mice. This thinning of the epithelium is most likely due to stretching. The stretch-related reduction in the area of lateral approximation between epithelial cells was reflected in the staining pattern of connexin 26 that appeared concentrated toward the tight-junction complexes.

This difference is important, because the onset of pendrin expression in the endolymphatic sac at E11.5 coincides with the onset of H+ ATPase expression [25]. H+ ATPase, like pendrin, is expressed in the apical membrane of mitochondrial-rich cells in the endolymphatic sac.

            "text": "In contrast to the endolymphatic pH in the cochlea, the pH of the endolymphatic sac was found to be more acidic than the surrounding fluid. This acidic pH was observed as early as E14.5, which is 3 days after the onset of pendrin and H+ ATPase expression [25] (Fig. 5). The finding of an acidic pH in the developing endolymphatic sac is consistent with measurements in the adult endolymphatic sac [26], [27], [28]. Interestingly, up to E15.5, which is 4 days after the onset of pendrin expression, no difference in the endolymphatic pH was found between Slc26a4+/\u2212 and Slc26a4\u2212/\u2212 mice. It remains undetermined, whether this delay in luminal pH changes is due to compensatory mechanisms possibly consisting of a coupling between the rates of ATPase-mediated H+ secretion and pendrin-mediated HCO3\n\u2212 secretion. Alternatively, the delay in the appearance of luminal pH changes could be related to the enlarged luminal volume found in Slc26a4\u2212/\u2212 mice or simply be a function of luminal pH buffering. Buffering of the luminal pH can be expected to be stronger in the endolymphatic sac compared to the cochlea since the endolymphatic sac, at least in adult animals, contains a higher concentration of proteins [29], [30], [31].",

The observation that the onset of the cochlear enlargement precedes the onset of pendrin expression (Fig. 6) supports the concept that the enlargement is initially driven by fluid secretion in the vestibular labyrinth rather than by defect of local cochlear fluid transport. Nothing is known about ion and fluid transport in the embryonic vestibular labyrinth, although the observation that the endolymphatic sac forms an open lumen at E11.5\u2013E12.5 suggests that fluid secretion in the vestibular labyrinth is present at this time. It is an attractive hypothesis to assume that the cochlea and the endolymphatic sac, which both form as pouches protruding from the otocyst, are \u2018pumped up\u2019 by fluid secretion in the otocyst that forms the vestibular labyrinth. The observation that the onset of the enlargement of the cochlea and the onset of the enlargement of the endolymphatic sac coincide at E14.5 (Fig. 6), is consistent with the hypothesis of a common source of fluid secretion.",

            "text": "The role of the vestibular labyrinth in the control of the cochlear lumen is limited to the phase of development prior to E16.5, since the utricular duct, which connects the utricle to the saccule, is closed after E16.5 [32]. Closing of the utricular duct creates two independent fluid systems. One system consisting of the cochlea, saccule and endolymphatic sac and the other consisting of the utricle, ampullae and semicircular canals [32]. The observation that the cochlear lumen continues to increase after E16.5 suggests the presence of a local defect in fluid homeostasis leading to abnormally high rates of fluid secretion or abnormally low rates of fluid reabsorption [14]. Abnormally low rates of fluid absorption are conceivably due to an impairment of Na+ reabsorption in Reissner's membrane epithelial cells. Reissner's membrane epithelial cells, analogous to principal cells in the renal cortical collecting duct, are engaged in Na+ reabsorption via ENaC Na+ channels and face a fluid compartment that is controlled in its pH and HCO3\n\u2212 concentration by pendrin [33], [34]. Recent observations in the renal collecting duct suggest that a lower HCO3\n\u2212 concentration reduces the abundance of ENaC Na+ channel subunits [35]. How this mechanism works and whether it is present in the inner ear is unknown.",

The enlargement impairs cell communication between mesenchymal and epithelial cells and causes stretching of epithelial cells. Stretching lengthens diffusional distances and thereby may impair cell-to-cell communication among epithelial cells. Interestingly, non-sensory cells are stretched but sensory cells are not (Fig. 7). This difference is most likely the result of differences in the epithelial rigidity. Sensory cells are endowed with a thick actin-ring near their apical tight junctions, which may provide the sensory epithelia with a greater rigidity which limits cell stretching to the more compliant non-sensory cells.",

However, the onset of connexin 26 expression in basal cells of stria vascularis occurred in Slc26a4\u2212/\u2212 prematurely (Fig. 9) and the expression pattern of connexin 26 and Na+/K+ ATPase highlighted stretching and thinning of stria vascularis (Fig. 10). The discrepancy in development of stria vascularis between Slc26a4+/\u2212 and Slc26a4\u2212/\u2212 mice was most apparent at P3 (Fig. 11). The observation that loss of pendrin leads to a retarded development of stria vascularis including a retarded vascularization is consistent with an impairment of cell-to-cell communication. Structural differences between stria vascularis of Slc26a4+/\u2212 and Slc26a4\u2212/\u2212 mice diminished at P7, however, oxidative stress and a reduced endocochlear potential have been found in Slc26a4\u2212/\u2212 mice at P10 and stria vascularis undergoes degeneration at P30 including an invasion of macrophages [36], [37], [11]. Taken together, these observations demonstrate that the retarded development of stria vascularis precludes normal function of stria vascularis in the postnatal cochlea.",
