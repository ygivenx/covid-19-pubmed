From May to December, 1997, the first 18 cases of human H5N1 were reported in Hong Kong, resulting in 6 fatalities [2]. While human-to-human transmissions are considered rare occurrences [3,4], experts are concerned that a pandemic may occur via human-to-human transmissions [5,6], and it has been estimated that 7.4 million deaths may result worldwide [7].",

Random telephone numbers were selected from up-to-date telephone directories. Telephone surveys have been used in a number of SARS and avian influenza studies [11-14]. Telephone calls were made by trained interviewers from 6:30 PM to 10:00 PM each night to avoid over-representation of unemployed persons. For unanswered calls, at least 3 other independent calls were made. The household member whose birthday was closest to the date of the interview was invited to join the study. Verbal informed consent was obtained from the respondents and ethics approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. The response rate, defined as the number of completed interviews divided by the number of eligible households, was approximately 57%.",

            "text": "Currently, we estimate that reasonably half of the general population is washing their hands over 10 times a day (unpublished data). An even higher frequency of handwashing is expected if the anticipated outbreak occurs. This is consistent with the local government campaigns for promoting handwashing [15]. Handwashing has been efficacious in preventing influenza [16,17] and SARS [9] and the vast majority of the respondents (94%) believed that it would be efficacious in preventing human-to-human avian influenza. Such a belief was, in turn, associated with anticipated higher frequency of handwashing. Handwashing may have become a commonly accepted means of preventing infectious respiratory diseases. Approximately 90% of the general population reported face mask use in public venues during the peak of the SARS epidemic [12,13]. The majority of the respondents would do so if there was a human-to-human H5N1 outbreak in Hong Kong. Many believed that face mask use in public venues was an efficacious method of human-to-human H5N1 prevention. However, while 87.1% of the respondents reported that they would report ILI symptoms at health checkpoints as required at times of a human-to-human H5N1 outbreak, 70.8% of the respondents did not do so during the period of April 2003 to January 2004 (during and shortly after the SARS epidemic) (unpublished data) [8]. Studies have demonstrated the limited effectiveness of such measures implemented during the SARS epidemic [18,19]. It is shown that about 90% of the general population with ILI symptoms during the SARS epidemic were wearing face masks [13], which is comparable to the results of this study showing that about 92% would wear face masks. The similarities between various public health responses related to SARS and avian influenza are reported and it is speculated that the public is modeling their responses to avian influenza outbreak to those of the SARS epidemic.",

However, only about 40% of the study's respondents considered human-to-human H5N1 fatality rate to be higher than that of SARS. Hence, the actual magnitude of behavioral responses might be even stronger, since we found perceived fatality to be significantly associated with self-protective behaviors. It is particularly interesting to note that while associations with self-protective behaviors such as mask use and handwashing were highly significant, perceived fatality rate in comparison to SARS was not significantly associated with any of the 4 behaviors directed to protecting others. Therefore, different considerations may be involved in making decisions of whether to practice preventive behaviors, depending on whether such behaviors are self-directed or directed towards others.",

It is less clear whether populations which were relatively unaffected by SARS and populations that demonstrated less frequent face mask use and other relevant public health measures would exhibit the same magnitude of intended behavioral responses as the population of Hong Kong. Cultural and perceptions factors (such as perceived efficacy of prevention means) would also result in different prevalence of behavioral responses. International comparisons are therefore also greatly warranted.",

The magnitude of these behavioral responses may be even greater than those witnessed during the SARS epidemic and would be likely to increase if a high fatality rate or high infectivity rate were reported. These preventive behaviors may be an effective firewall to the continued spread of the virus in the community. Surveillance of public responses is an integral part of the government's H5N1 preparedness plan. It should address issues related to the potentially underestimated fatality associated with human H5N1 cases. Surveillance should also closely monitor prevalence of important public health behaviors such as quarantine compliance and cross-border preventive measures. Up-to-date surveillance information is necessary for the government to implement and make rapid adjustments these public health measures.",
