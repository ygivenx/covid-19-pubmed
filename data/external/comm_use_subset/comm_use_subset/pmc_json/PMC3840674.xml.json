Infectious pestiviruses can be rescued using RNA transcripts derived from these BACs. The pestiviruses have single stranded positive sense RNA genomes, about 12.3 kb in length, which includes a single long open reading frame, encoding a large polyprotein, flanked by 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) that are critical for autonomous replication of the genome [12,13]. The polyprotein is cleaved by cellular and viral proteases into four structural proteins (nucleocapsid protein C, envelope glycoproteins Erns, E1 and E2) and eight non-structural proteins (Npro, p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B). The availability of genetically defined and stable pestivirus BACs facilitates the functional study of viral proteins or RNA structures and also the development of new marker vaccine candidates. Several CSFV vaccines with marker properties based on chimeric pestiviruses have been developed over the years [14]. In particular, chimeric pestiviruses with substitution of the entire E2 protein have been described [15-17] but also mutants with more subtle modifications, such as the modification of the important TAV-epitope [18] within the CSFV-E2 protein [19,20] are promising marker vaccine candidates.",

The use of homologous recombination allows site-directed mutagenesis of BACs [22] and, by employing a counter-selection scheme, specific modifications can be obtained without leaving residual \u201cforeign\u201d sequences [23]. The main advantage of this method is that there are no target limitations (e.g. based on size or location) and no need for suitable restriction sites. The integration of the modified sequence is performed in vivo (within E. coli) thereby potentially being more accurate than in vitro approaches like PCR-based methods. Although in vitro cloning approaches based on the use of high-fidelity polymerases for PCR amplification have significantly improved in recent years, the use of in vivo approaches should allow a more accurate method of mutagenesis due to the use of the cells own high-fidelity replication system which includes proof reading. Whereas BAC recombination has been commonly used for modifying DNA viruses, there are only very few reports about the use of this technology for RNA viruses [7,24,25].",

Immediately after electroporation, pre-warmed LB medium without antibiotics (1 ml) was added to the cells which were then incubated at 30\u00b0C for 1 hour, prior to spreading onto agar plates containing Cam (15 \u03bcg/ml) and tetracycline (Tet) (3 \u03bcg/ml) and then incubated at 30\u00b0C overnight to maintain the pRedET. The presence of the pRedET plasmid (conferring TetR) was verified by visual inspection of BAC-DNA preparations from the CamR/TetR colonies using agarose gel electrophoresis. Step ii) counter-selection marker cassettes with an extra NotI site for screening purposes (rpsL-neo, 1325 bp) were amplified by PCR using primers with 30 nt or 50 nt extensions that were homologous to the target site in the BAC using the rpsL-neo plasmid (Gene Bridges) as template and the Phusion hot start II HF DNA polymerase (Thermo Scientific) with cycling conditions as follows: 98\u00b0C for 30s, followed by 35 cycles of 98\u00b0C for 10s, 60\u00b0C for 20s, 72\u00b0C for 60s, and 1 cycle at 72\u00b0C for 4 min. The PCR products (ca. 1400 bp) were isolated on 1% (w/v) TBE agarose gels and purified using a GeneJET gel extraction kit (Thermo Scientific). Samples (30 \u03bcl), from an E. coli culture containing pRedET and the parental BAC grown overnight at 30\u00b0C in LB media (Cam, Tet), were used to inoculate 1.4 ml of fresh LB media with the same antibiotics to obtain exponentially growing bacteria at 30\u00b0C. Red/ET recombination proteins were induced by adding 50 \u03bcl of 10% (w/v) L-arabinose (Sigma). The PCR product (200 ng) containing the rpsL-neo cassette was introduced into these bacteria using electroporation (as above). Following electroporation, the cells were grown at 37\u00b0C for 70 min (to allow recombination) and then selected on plates containing Cam (15 \u03bcg/ml), Tet (3 \u03bcg/ml) and kanamycin (Kan, 15 \u03bcg/ml) overnight at 30\u00b0C to maintain the pRedET. Note, the rpsL cassette confers Streptomycin sensitivity (StrepS) onto the resistant DH10B strain and the neo confers Kanamycin resistance (KanR). The correct phenotype (CamR, KanR, TetR, StrepS) of the resulting colonies was confirmed by streaking the colonies onto plates containing Cam (15 \u03bcg/ml), Tet (3 \u03bcg/ml) and Kan (15 \u03bcg/ml) and grown at 30\u00b0C. Importantly, for the third step, the replacement of the rpsL-neo cassette (using counter-selection), the selected colonies were also streaked onto plates containing Cam (15 \u03bcg/ml) plus Strep (50 \u03bcg/ml) and shown to be StrepS indicating incorporation of a functional rpsL gene. The structures of the intermediate BACs were verified by restriction enzyme analysis and sequencing around the inserts. Step iii) the replacement of the rpsL-neo selection cassettes from the intermediate constructs using linear DNA fragments was achieved through counter-selection and Red/ET recombination. Again, the homologous sequences at the ends of the DNA fragment were used for Red/ET mediated recombination events to replace the rpsL-neo cassette with the sequence of interest. Counter-selection against the rpsL-neo cassette (phenotype CamR, KanR, TetR, StrepS) was employed using media containing Cam (15 \u03bcg/ml) and Strep (50 \u03bcg/ml) to isolate the required derivatives (phenotype CamR and StrepR).",

Secondly, the rpsL-neo cassette in this intermediate construct was then replaced using counter-selection Red/ET recombination using a single-stranded oligonucleotide, Riems_TAV_Gifhorn (Additional file 1: Table S1) with the same homology arms as used for the rpsL-neo cassette, to introduce the coding sequence for the BDV \u201cGifhorn\u201d epitope sequence (TTVSTSTLA).

Pre-heating of single stranded oligonucleotides at 95\u00b0C for 2 min followed by snap-freezing, prior to electroporation, empirically showed the best results. In each case, the DNA molecules were introduced into E. coli containing the BAC derivatives including the rpsL-neo cassettes together with the pRedET plasmid by electroporation as described above.

BACs containing the complete CSFV cDNAs were identified by restriction digest analysis and following linearization by NotI, RNA transcripts were produced and electroporated into PK15 cells. This screening resulted in the identification of a BAC containing a cDNA insert of 12316 nt, pBeloR26 (Figure 1), which yielded infectious virus, termed vR26, that could be propagated in SFT-R cells (Figure 2, upper panels) and in PK15 cells (Figure 3). The rescued vR26 displayed higher growth rate at the early stage (about 10-fold difference in virus yield at 24 h) compared to the parental vaccine virus, but after 48 hours similar virus titres were obtained (Figure 3). Full-genome sequencing of the cloned BAC template, pBeloR26, revealed a number of differences throughout the genome when compared to the full-length consensus sequence of the cDNA used for the cloning procedure (see Table 1). These differences are non-representative variants within the cDNA. Overall, the BAC sequence differed from the cDNA sequence in 18 positions, 9 of these lead to predicted amino acid substitutions within the polyprotein; one in each of Npro, Erns, E1, E2 and NS3 and four amino acid substitutions in NS5B (Table 1). When compared to the published reference sequence (GenBank accession AY259122.1), the pBeloR26 BAC sequence differed at an additional 11 positions, 1 of these lead to a predicted amino acid substitution and there was one large insertion (27 nt) in the hypervariable region of the 3\u2032-UTR (Additional file 2: Table S2).",

The virus titre (as TCID50/ml) was determined for each passage. Passage of the rescued vR26_E2gif chimeric virus in PK15 cells resulted in rapidly decreasing virus titres and was discontinued after the 2nd passage (Figure 4A).

Virus titers reached more than 106 TCID50/ml after the 1st passage and remained stable for 12 passages (Figure 4A). The rescued vR26 was also efficiently propagated on the SFT-R cells but maintained a slightly lower titer than the vR26_E2gif chimeric virus (Figure 4A).

Cells infected with either the vR26/P-12 or the chimeric vR26_E2gif/P-12 were each detected by the polyclonal anti-pestivirus serum as expected. The anti-CSFV-E2 mAb specifically detected cells infected with vR26/P-12 but not cells infected by the chimeric virus containing the BDV-E2 protein (consistent with the results shown in Figure 2). In contrast, the anti-BDV-E2 mAb specifically detected infection by the vR26_E2gif/P-12 and did not recognize cells infected with vR26/P-12. Each result is in accord with the structure of the viruses.",

            "text": "The 4th passage of vR26 (vR26/P-4) displayed a slower growth rate than the virus obtained after 12 passages (see Figure 5A). It also had a reduced growth rate compared to both the vR26_E2gif/P-4 and vR26_E2gif/P-12. The full-length sequence of pBeloR26 had revealed ten non-silent mutations compared to the reference sequence (AY259122.1) for this virus (Additional file 2: Table S2). Any of these mutations could be responsible for the impaired growth acting alone or in concert. For further investigation of this issue, full length cDNAs prepared from vR26/P-4, vR26/P-12, vR26_E2gif/P-4 and vR26_E2gif/P-12 were deep-sequenced using both the 454 FLX and Ion PGM platforms for comparison and to determine the quasispecies distribution (Additional file 3: Figure S1 and Additional file 4: Figure S2). Sequencing data from both platforms revealed that both the vR26/P-12 and vR26_E2gif/P-12 were close to 100% changed at nt position A10665G compared to the BAC clones (resulting in the predicted amino acid substitution D3431G within the NS5B protein, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, see Figure 5B). This adaptation is a reversion back to the consensus cDNA sequence of the parental vaccine virus, vRiemser (Additional file 2: Table S2). Additionally, vR26/P-4 and vR26_E2gif/P-4 already showed evidence for this reversion being present within the population. For vR26/P-4, the level of reversion was 57%, while for vR26_E2gif/P-4 the extent of change was 73% (see Figure 5B).",

Some of these differences are present in the cDNA derived from the vaccine stock at a detectable level whereas others may represent low-level variants within the cDNA or errors introduced by the RT-PCR amplification. Full-length sequencing revealed that no changes occurred in the cDNA during extensive propagation in E. coli DH10B of the pBeloR26 and the E2-chimeric derivative, pBeloR26_E2gif, indicating a very high stability of these BAC-cloned CSFV cDNAs. This is essential if this system is to be useful for cloning and sequence manipulation, and contrasts with stability problems encountered with conventional plasmids containing full-length pestivirus cDNAs [31]. The stability of these BACs is consistent with previous reports on the stability of BACs containing other viruses of the family Flaviviridae in E. coli[8,10].",

The same reversion to the consensus sequence for the \u201cC-strain Riems\u201d virus was observed in two independent virus populations, derived from independent BACs, and indicates that this substitution is important for efficient growth of the \u201cC-strain Riems\u201d virus in SFT-R cells. In contrast, all other nucleotide positions remained unchanged during the extensive virus propagation including the heterologous E2 sequences (Figure 5B). The glycine (G) residue at position 3431 in the polyprotein is highly conserved amongst CSFV strains; indeed, alignment of CSFV sequences retrieved from GenBank did not reveal any variation at that position (data not shown). Whether this mutation was derived from the cloning procedure or reflects a low-level variant present in the parental vaccine stock is unclear.",
