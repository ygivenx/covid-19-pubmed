            "text": "Recently, IFITMs have become a popular research topic with the discovery that the immune-related IFITMs (IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3) inhibit the early replication of multiple viruses, including influenza A virus (IAV), dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Ebola virus (EBOV), and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) [3\u20138]. IFITMs are a subfamily of a larger transmembrane protein family called Dispanins [9], which are generally considered to be comprised of IFITM1, IFITM2, IFITM3, IFITM5, and IFITM10 [10]. IFITM4P, a pseudogene, is located on mouse chromosome as IFITM6 and IFITM7 [11]. Moreover, IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3, as viral restriction factors, are known as immune-related IFITMs, the antiviral activity of which is conserved from prokaryotes to vertebrates. In addition, the immune-related IFITMs exhibit high constitutive expression in target cells and are strongly induced by types I and II IFNs [12]. IFITMs have common domains that consist of N- and C-termini, two transmembrane domains, and a conserved cytoplasmic domain and share common properties: (1) the proteins contain a CD225 domain composed of transmembrane domain 1 (TM1) and a cytoplasmic domain and (2) two exons encode transmembrane polypeptides [13]. Among these domains, the N-terminal region plays an important role in the correct cellular localization of IFITM3. Removing the N-terminal 21 amino acids of IFITM3 results in a loss of association with the endosomal compartments and relocation to the cell surface, thereby abrogating its antiviral function [14]. IFITM1 possesses a shorter N-terminal region and predominately localizes at the cell periphery and in early endosomes [4]. The different cellular localization of IFITM1 and IFITM3 likely underlies their diverse antiviral efficiency against various viruses [15]. IFITM1 exerts more resistance to viruses that fuse at the plasma membrane or early endosome, such as HIV-1 [8]. However, IFITM3 is more proficient than IFITM1 at preventing infection by the late endosomal- or lysosomal-entering viruses, including IAV and DENV [3]. At present, IFITMs have been widely identified in vertebrates, and homologs of IFITMs are even found in bacteria [16]. However, little attention has been paid to IFITMs in birds. Only a small number of bird IFITM sequences have been deposited in public databases, including Gallus gallus IFITM1-like (GenBank: XM_001233949), Anas platyrhynchos IFITM1 (GenBank: KF584226), Gallus gallus IFITM3-like (GenBank: XM_420925), Anas platyrhynchos IFITM3 (GenBank: KF584228), Serinus canaria IFITM3 (GenBank: XM_009102512), and Nipponia nippon IFITM3 (GenBank: XM_009463652). In addition, it was reported that chicken IFITM3 [17] and duck IFITM3 [18] could restrict influenza viruses, but information regarding goose IFITMs was unavailable.",

            "text": "Tembusu virus (TMUV) is a newly emerging pathogenic virus that, together with DENV, WNV, Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and yellow fever virus (YFV), belongs to the genus Flavivirus [19]. The TMUV genome is a single-stranded RNA with an open reading frame that encodes three structural proteins, namely, the core (C), membrane (prM), and envelope (E) proteins, and seven nonstructural proteins [20]. In China, the virus was initially isolated from ducks and can cause severe egg drop syndrome in laying ducks, resulting in huge economic losses. However, recent studies showed that chickens, geese, and house sparrows are also susceptible to this virus [21\u201323]. Most importantly, serum samples from workers in the duck industry contained TMUV antibodies, which may indicate potential zoonotic transmission [24]. In view of the significant antiviral activity of IFITMs in the IFN-mediated innate antiviral defense and the lack of studies focusing on avian IFITMs, goose IFITM1 and IFITM3 were cloned for the first time. In addition, the amino acid sequences and topological structures of these proteins were predicted. To understand the evolutionary relationship of goose IFITM1 and IFITM3, a phylogenetic tree was constructed. Moreover, the tissue distribution of goose IFITM1 and IFITM3 in healthy geese was identified. It has been demonstrated that IFITMs play an important role in blocking the entry of pathogenic flaviviruses such as DENV and WNV. As TMUV is a novel member of Flavivirus, the interaction between TMUV and IFITM-mediated immune responses is unknown. Interestingly, we observed that goose IFITM1 and IFITM3, to different degrees, positively responded to TMUV infection both in vivo and in vitro. Collectively, our results promote the research of avian IFITMs and may provide the molecular foundation for further research regarding the contribution of goose IFITM1 and IFITM3 to the innate immune responses to TMUV infection.",

For 3\u2032-RACE, the Adapter Primer (AP) was used to amplify the first-strand cDNA. The 3\u2032-end of IFITM3 was also amplified by nested PCR with the primer pairs 3\u2032GSP1/AP1 and 3\u2032GSP2/AP2. The primer IFITM3-3\u2032R, which was used for amplifying the 3\u2032-UTR of IFITM3, was designed according to the predicted IFITM3 sequence from goose transcriptome data [25]. Finally, the complete CDs of IFITM1 and IFITM3 were amplified using Primer STAR Max DNA polymerase (TaKaRa, Japan) and were cloned into the pMD19-T vector (TaKaRa, Japan) for sequencing.",

Neither the N- nor C-terminus of either goose IFITM1 or IFITM3 were predicted to be oriented toward the extracellular space. Multiple amino acid sequence alignments show several conserved residues that are critical for the antiviral function and localization of IFITMs. A highly conserved Yxx\u03a6 motif appears in the NTD of IFITM3, which promotes the internalization of IFITM3. However, IFITM1, with a comparatively short NTD, lacks this Yxx\u03a6 motif. In addition, three other Yxx\u03a6 motifs are conserved in IFITM3 of chickens, ducks, and geese. Two cysteines (C60 and C61) in TM1 are conserved in IFITM3 and undergo palmitoylation [31]. In addition, three lysines (K72, K77 and K93) that are the sites of ubiquitination are also present in IFITM3 [32] (Figure 3).",

In addition, the names of the previously identified duck IFITM3 (GenBank: KF584228) and duck IFITM1 (GenBank: KF584226) were reversed. The pairwise sequence alignment analysis of nucleotide sequences showed that goose IFITM1 shares a much higher identity with its counterparts in duck (GenBank: KF584228) (93.3%) and chicken (GenBank: XM_420925) (70.6%) than with duck IFITM3 (GenBank: KF584226) (63.5%) and chicken IFTM3 (GenBank: XM_001233949) (59.4%). A similar result was observed in the nucleotide sequences alignment of goose IFITM3 with chicken IFITM1 and IFITM3, as well as duck IFITM1 and IFITM3 (Table S2). The phylogenetic analysis indicated that the IFITM1 and IFITM3 clusters were divergent subgroups. Goose IFITM1 and the renamed chicken IFITM1 and duck IFITM1, together with the mammalian IFITM1, were classified into the same subgroup. Meanwhile, goose IFITM3 and the renamed duck IFITM3 were located in the same monophyletic group, which was closely related to the renamed chicken IFITM3. In summary, the results revealed that it was necessary to rename the IFITM1 and IFITM3 in chicken and duck and that goose IFITM1 and IFITM3 have been conserved during evolution.",

In line with the above findings, VSV-G envelope protein-mediated virus entry could not be inhibited by the IFITM3 mutant (the N-terminal 21-amino acid deletion) [14]. These results highlight the important role of the N-terminal region of IFITM3 in antiviral functions [14]. In addition, the 20-Yxx\u03a6-23 sorting signal in the N-terminal region is critical for the internalization of IFITM3 from the cell periphery to endosomal compartments where it acts to impede virus entry [42]. The N-terminal Yxx\u03a6 motif was observed in the N-terminal region of goose IFITM3. We predicted that the conserved motif in goose IFITM3 is also involved in the internalization and antiviral actions. Moreover, three other Yxx\u03a6 motifs that might be required for the endosomal localization and antiviral functions of duck IFITM3 [18] are also conserved in IFITM3 of chickens and geese. However, whether these Yxx\u03a6 motifs in goose IFITM3 are critical for correct cellular localization and inhibition of virus entry has yet to be confirmed.",

In contrast, goose IFITM3 was constitutively and ubiquitously expressed in various tissues. Notably, high expression levels of goose IFITM3 were observed in respiratory tract tissues (lung and trachea), the target tissues of infection with influenza A viruses, compared to the other tissues, which might contribute to the inhibition of influenza A virus replication [43].

Obviously, the expression levels of goose IFITM1 and IFITM3 displayed an upward trend in all the tested tissues, especially the cecum (Figure 7), where TMUV was primarily distributed (Figure 8). High viral copy numbers were also observed in the intestinal tract tissues of TMUV-infected ducks [48]. In addition, goose IFITM1 was intensively transcribed in the TMUV-infected spleen and thymus (Figure 7), where the significant upregulation of the IFNs was previously observed [48]. After TMUV infection, the virus was intensively located in the collected tissues, which reasonably explains why higher expression levels of goose IFITM1 and IFITM3 appeared in the TMUV-infected gosling tissues than those of the mock-infected group. In addition, the lowest viral copy numbers were seen in lung tissues, which might be attributed to the high expression level of IFITM3 in the TMUV-infected goose lungs. In light of the positive response of goose IFITM1 and IFITM3 to TMUV infection, we speculate that goose IFITM1 and IFITM3 might facilitate IFN-mediated defenses against TMUV.",
