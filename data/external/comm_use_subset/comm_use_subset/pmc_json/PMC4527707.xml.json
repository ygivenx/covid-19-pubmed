            "text": "The Chlamydiaceae are a genus of Gram-negative, obligate intracellular bacterial pathogens that cause a spectrum of diseases in both humans and agriculturally important animals. C. pecorum infection, for example, causes clinical manifestations in swine ranging from conjunctivitis to abortion [1]. C. trachomatis infection in humans can cause medically important conditions, such as trachoma, pelvic inflammatory disease, and infertility. Though chlamydial infections can cause acute diseases, they are most associated with chronic inflammation resulting in significant host tissue damage [2]. The chlamydiae also share a complex developmental cycle. The infectious form (the elementary body or EB), binds to and enters the host cell. After host cell entry, the EB transitions into the more metabolically active, replicative developmental form (the reticulate body or RB). The RB then grow and divide within a cytoplasmic, membrane-bound inclusion. After several rounds of division, RB convert back into infectious EB, which are released from the host cell [3]. A third stage, historically termed persistence or more recently the chlamydial stress response, is defined as a developmental stage in which the organisms are viable but non-infectious. Persistent/stressed RB are enlarged, irregularly shaped and non-dividing; these altered developmental forms are sometimes called aberrant bodies (AB). The persistence/stress response is reversible\u2014when the stressor is removed, the chlamydiae resume normal, productive development. A variety of stressors induce chlamydial persistence/stress in culture: these include IFN-\u03b3 exposure; glucose, iron and amino acid deprivation; and host cell co-infection with herpes simplex virus type 2 [4], Human Herpes Virus 6 [5], and the coronavirus porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) [6,7].",

            "text": "Both pathogen infection and sterile trauma can promote release of damage/danger associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) from mammalian cells/tissues. Typically, DAMPs are normal intracellular components or metabolites, the release of which into the extracellular milieu indicates cellular damage or lysis. Once in the extracellular environment, DAMPs bind signaling receptors on mammalian cells and initiate specific responses that promote local inflammation and wound healing. Known DAMPs include heat shock proteins, high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1), uric acid, and purine metabolites (reviewed in [8]) [9]. Extracellular ATP (ATPe) and adenosine (ADO) are two well studied DAMPs, the binding of which to purinergic receptors initiates components of the mammalian defense against intracellular pathogens (reviewed in [10]). Purinergic receptor activation is known to limit chlamydial development in a host cell- and chlamydial species-specific manner. For example, exposure of C. caviae-infected mouse J774 macrophages to ATPe reduces infectious titer by >50% [11]. ATPe-exposure also restricts C. muridarum development in J774 cells by promoting inclusion-lysosomal fusion. However, ATPe-exposure does not kill chlamydiae in peritoneal macrophages elicited from P2X7 receptor knock-out mice, demonstrating a requirement for this receptor. ATPe reduces production of C. muridarum EB in J774 cells [12] and a similar reduction is observed in HeLa cells [13]. Furthermore, C. muridarum infectious burden in P2X7 receptor-deficient mice is 10 times higher than that of their wild-type counterparts [13]. These data suggest that ATPe may play a significant anti-chlamydial role in vivo, as well as in vitro. Extracellular ADO-exposure also reduces infectious EB production by both C. trachomatis L2 and serovar D in HeLa cells, primarily by signaling through the A2b receptor. Though recovery of serovar D was not tested, L2 recovered infectivity post-termination of ADO-exposure. Thus, the authors concluded that ADO-exposure induces the C. trachomatis L2 persistence/stress response [14].",

            "text": "As stated previously, host cell co-infection with PEDV abrogates productive development of both C. pecorum and C. abortus [6]. Furthermore, this effect is reversible and results in AB formation, suggesting that PEDV co-infection induces the chlamydial persistence/stress response. Neither UV inactivation of the virus nor inhibition of viral protein synthesis with cycloheximide ablates this response [7], suggesting that either a virion component (such as an envelope glycoprotein or genomic RNA) or a pre-synthesized host cellular component (such as a cytokine or DAMP) mediates this effect. Viruses induce DAMP release from infected host cells and are, in turn, affected by DAMP-induced responses. For example, infection with the Arterivirus porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) releases the DAMP HMGB1 from infected host cells, resulting in macrophage expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines [15]. Undamaged Influenza A-infected cells release the DAMP S100A9, which activates host inflammatory responses [16]. Influenza A-induced extracellular ATP release may also up-regulate Streptococcus pneumoniae virulence genes\u2013providing one possible explanation for the increased lethality of post-influenza pneumococcal pneumonia [17]. Finally, extracellular ATP is both released from Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected macrophages [18] and facilitates HIV entry into new host cells [19]. Therefore, we hypothesized that release of DAMPs from PEDV-infected cells may influence the C. pecorum developmental cycle. As a first step in testing this hypothesis, we examined the effect of extracellular ATP and adenosine (ADO) on C. pecorum development.",

Exposure of Chlamydia-infected cells to DAMPs reversibly reduced inclusion size, bacteria per inclusion and subsequent chlamydial infectivity upon re-infection of host cells. Notably, aberrant bodies, characteristic of PEDV-induced C. pecorum persistence, were absent upon DAMP exposure. Parallel evaluation of two chlamydial species, C. pecorum and C. trachomatis serovar E, demonstrated that DAMPs exert their effect in a species-specific manner. Comparison of DAMP exposure beginning at 0 hours versus 14 hours post infection showed that similar reduction of inclusions size and lack of induction of aberrant body formation occur independent of the time of initiation of DAMP exposure. This study, to our knowledge, represents the first evaluation of the effects of DAMPs on C. pecorum inclusion development, and as such provides novel information regarding the host/pathogen interactions of this important, though less frequently studied, chlamydial species.",

For EHNA/ADO exposure, both reagents were added to the incubation medium together at the indicated times [T0 or T14]. Diluent alone, sterile distilled H2O, served as mock exposure controls. In preliminary experiments for this study, in HeLa cells, C. pecorum inclusions and host cells begin to burst earlier than C. trachomatis inclusions and host cells. Chlamydia-infected cells were thus incubated until mature inclusions could be evaluated, but bursting of inclusions and cells was not evident: 39 h post infection (hpi) for C. trachomatis-infected cells, as previously reported [22], and 35 hpi for C. pecorum-infected cells, as determined by preliminary experiments (Fig 2). In continued exposure and recovery experiments, incubation medium was changed and cells were incubated for a further 24 hours (Fig 1C).",

Cyclic AMP (cAMP) has not been traditionally categorized as a DAMP, but rather an intracellular \u201csecond messenger\u201d downstream of cell surface receptor stimulation. However, several studies suggest that cAMP can egress from and bind receptors on various cell types, exerting subsequent influence on cellular function (reviewed in [23]). Furthermore, cAMP levels quickly increase in HeLa cells after ADO stimulation, and both cell-permeant and non-cell-permeant cAMP have been shown to inhibit chlamydial development [14,24,25]. Therefore, we also evaluated the effect of cAMP on C. pecorum inclusion development, and refer to it here as a DAMP.",

The decrease in percent infection of host cells by C. pecorum in the presence of cAMP or ATP, though statistically significant, likely represents the small size of these inclusions reducing reticle-delimited, field-based microscopic detection. Thus we expect this small reduction in infectivity is unlikely to be biologically relevant.",

To evaluate the impact of host cell de novo protein synthesis on DAMP-dependent modulation of inclusion development, DAMPs were added at T0, either with or without cycloheximide supplementation of the incubation medium (S1 Fig). IF microscopy showed, as expected, that chlamydiae (S1A and S1Q Fig, C. pecorum, 90 \u03bcm2; S1I and S1S Fig, C. trachomatis; 375 \u03bcm2) cultured in the presence of cycloheximide develop larger inclusions than do chlamydiae cultured in the absence of cycloheximide (S1E and S1R Fig, C. pecorum, 37 \u03bcm2; S1M and S1T Fig, C. trachomatis, 131 \u03bcm2). Each DAMP significantly reduced inclusion size compared to the control, in both chlamydial species evaluated, both in the presence and absence of cycloheximide. However, the DAMP-dependent effect was relatively robust in the presence of cycloheximide compared to in the absence of cycloheximide. Mean C. pecorum inclusion size was reduced, by all DAMPs evaluated, to less than 25% of control inclusion size in the presence of cycloheximide (S1A\u2013S1D and S1Q Fig), but to less than 65% of control inclusion size in the absence of cycloheximide (S1E\u2013S1H and S1R Fig).

TEM analyses of the mean relative proportions of EB, RB, IB (intermediate bodies, differentiating bacterial form intermediate to RB and EB) and AB indicate that cAMP and ATP exposure, but not EHNA/ADO exposure, significantly altered the relative proportion of bacterial developmental forms (Fig 6D and 6E, S2 Fig). Exposure of C. pecorum-infected cells (Fig 6D, S2A Fig) to cAMP and ATP reduced the proportion of EB to 6% and 2%, respectively, compared to the control proportion of 10% (although this reduction was not statistically significant for cAMP exposure). A similar effect was seen for C. pecorum IB, which showed a reduced proportion of 2% and 1%, upon cAMP and ATP exposure, respectively, compared the control proportion of 6%. This was accompanied by a cAMP- and ATP-dependent increase in the proportion of C. pecorum RB to 92% and 97% respectively, compared to the control proportion of 84%. In marked contrast, exposure of C. trachomatis-infected cells (Fig 6E, S2B Fig) to cAMP and ATP increased the proportion of EB to 44% (for both DAMPs), compared to the control proportion of 20%; this was accompanied by a cAMP- and ATP-dependent decrease in the proportion of RB to 51% and 44% respectively, compared to the control proportion of 72% (no effect on IB proportion was observed).

As expected, based on the marked reduction in inclusion size upon DAMP exposure of Chlamydia-infected cells (Fig 3C and 3D), and the reduction of bacteria per inclusion associated with this reduction in inclusion size (Fig 6A and 6B), IFU/ml was significantly reduced in all DAMP exposed groups, compared to the control exposed group, for both C. pecorum (Fig 7A) and C. trachomatis E (Fig 7B). cAMP, ATP, and EHNA/ADO exposure reduced IFU/ml to less than 1% of the control in all DAMP-exposed C. pecorum-infected cells (Fig 7A), to less than 1% of the control in cAMP and EHNA/ADO-exposed C. trachomatis-infected cells, and to less than 3% of the control in ATP-exposed C. trachomatis-infected cells (Fig 7B). Notably, though DAMP exposure decreased chlamydial infectious EB production by at least 97% (Fig 7), reduction in inclusion size ranged from only approximately 61% to 86% of control values for both species tested (Fig 3), suggesting that there is not a strong correlation between inclusion size and infectious EB production.",

To investigate the impact of this restriction on the observed DAMP-dependent anti-chlamydial effect, DAMPs were added at T0, either with or without cycloheximide supplementation of the incubation medium, and processed to determine infectious EB production, presented as IFU/ml (S4 Fig). In contrast to the similar, but less substantial, DAMP-dependent reductive effect on inclusions size noted in the absence of cycloheximide versus the presence of cycloheximide (S1 Fig), reduction, and even reversal, of the DAMP-dependent reductive effect on infectious EB production was observed in the absence of cycloheximide versus the presence of cycloheximide (S4 Fig). C. pecorum IFU/ml, as expected, was reduced to less than 1% of the control IFU/ml by all DAMPs evaluated in the presence of cycloheximide (S4A Fig). However, in the absence of cycloheximide, EHNA/ADO exposure reduced C. pecorum IFU/ml to only 73.5% of the control IFU/ml, while cAMP and ATP exposure increased C. pecorum IFU/ml to 311.2% and 271.8%, respectively (S4B Fig). C. trachomatis IFU/ml, was reduced to less than 1% of the control IFU/ml, in the presence of cycloheximide, upon exposure to all DAMPs evaluated (S4C Fig). In the absence of cycloheximide, however, C. trachomatis IFU/ml was reduced to 12.4% of control by EHNA/ADO, not significantly changed by cAMP (though a reduction to 74.6% of control IFU/ml closely approached, but did not reach, significance; p = 0.0540) and increased to 163.3% of control by ATP (S4D Fig).",

This suggests that the inclusions in cAMP- and ATP- exposed groups (Fig 9) may not produce infectious EB after 24 hours of recovery, despite a relatively normal IF microscopic appearance.

Under host protein synthesis limitations, each of these DAMPs induce similar alterations of the C. pecorum developmental cycle and, in the case of adenosine, of the C. trachomatis serotype E developmental cycle, to those previously reported for C. caviae, C. muridarum and C. trachomatis serotypes D and L2 [11,12,14,27]. These changes include (i) reduction in inclusion size and bacterial density within inclusions, without AB formation; (ii) reduction in release of infectious EB; and (iii) recovery of infectious EB production upon removal of DAMP stimulus. The latter two changes are consistent with the currently accepted definition of persistence or the chlamydial stress response, namely viable, but non-infectious chlamydiae; while lack of aberrant body formation is atypical in chlamydial persistence, but not entirely unrepresented [26]. For example, iron deprivation reduced C. trachomatis inclusion size without inducing AB formation, though RB morphology was affected, exhibiting wavy cell membranes on the normal-sized RB (determined by electron microscopic analysis) [33]. While in interferon-dependent persistence/chlamydial stress induction, host cell species determines a difference in AB formation, with AB formation associated with human host cell lines [26,34] but not with murine cell lines [34,35]. Notably, C. trachomatis serotype E failed to recover infectious EB production within 24 hours after discontinuation of cAMP or ATP exposure, an effect which can be explained as killing of the chlamydiae, rather than persistence induction. Further evaluation of possible recovery over extended times may reveal whether C. trachomatis serotype E is incapable of recovery from cAMP or ATP exposure under certain experimental conditions, or whether species-specific differences exist in the timing of recovery of chlamydiae from DAMPs.",

In fact, as determined specifically by parallel evaluation of DAMPs exposure in the presence or absence of cycloheximide, in the absence of cycloheximide, cAMP and ATP exposure elicited a markedly different effect on infectious EB production, compared to exposure in the presence of cycloheximide, in both species of chlamydiae tested. In the presence of cycloheximide, both species showed dramatic cAMP- and ATP-dependent reductions in infectious EB production. However, in the absence of cycloheximide, this effect was reversed for C. pecorum, which showed cAMP- and ATP-dependent increases in infectious EB production. Likewise, the effect was reversed for C. trachomatis upon ATP exposure, and reduced to statistical similarity with the control upon cAMP exposure. EHNA/ADO exposure, however, elicited a reduction in IFU/ml compared to the control both in the presence or absence of cycloheximide for both chlamydial species evaluated, though a more marked reduction was observed in the presence of cycloheximide for both species. Interestingly, the reductive effect on inclusion size observed for all DAMPs and both chlamydial species in the presence of cycloheximide was also observed in the absence of cycloheximide, though, again, to a lesser extent.",

In fact, the conspicuous reduction in bacterial numbers, with no obvious alterations to EB or RB microscopic appearance suggests that DAMP-induced chlamydial biological changes, though currently unknown, markedly differ from reported changes associated with other persistence inducers such as antibiotic exposure, cytokine exposure, or viral co-infection. For example, smaller-sized inclusions, populated exclusively with grossly enlarged AB, were previously seen in PEDV-induced aberrant C. pecorum inclusion morphology [6]. In the current study, we evaluated the effect on inclusion formation when cAMP, ATP, or EHNA/ADO were added at 14 hpi, specifically to address the possibility that the time after chlamydial infection of exposure to an inducer of persistence/chlamydial stress might influence AB production. However, DAMPs added at 14 hpi, compared to 0 hpi, also failed to induce AB formation, and instead exerted an effect on chlamydial inclusion development equivalent, if somewhat less dramatic, to that seen at 0 hpi exposure. This indicates that the inducer of aberrant chlamydial inclusions, not the time of induction, is responsible for the disparate appearance of aberrant inclusions in Chlamydia-infected cells treated with cAMP, ATP, or EHNA/ADO versus those exposed to PEDV. Furthermore, this suggests that while release of DAMPs from PEDV-infected cells may influence the C. pecorum developmental cycle, the AB formation and persistence/chlamydial stress observed in the previously reported C. pecorum/PEDV co-infection model is not likely to be entirely ATP-, cAMP-, or EHNA/ADO-dependent.",

The phenomenon of interferon-induced persistence/chlamydial stress has been well studied, and it is known that interferon elicits its effects on chlamydiae dissimilarly in human versus murine host cells. In human cells the primary effector of persistence is indoleamine dioxygenase (IDO), the activation of which depletes host intracellular tryptophan levels needed for chlamydial growth; while in murine cells, persistence is induced in the absence of IDO activation and can involve nitric oxide synthase (NOs) activation, lipid acquisition disruption, or increased fusion of inclusions with lysosomes [34,36]. The mechanisms for virus co-infection-induced persistence/chlamydial stress was demonstrated to be imbalanced oxidative stress in the case of human herpes virus 6 [5]. In contrast, herpes simplex virus type-2 mediated down-regulation of host nectin-1 protein appears to induce C. trachomatis persistence [37]. The involvement of these modes of action has not yet been investigated in the context of DAMP-induced persistence/chlamydial stress, and currently, evaluation of possible modes of action for DAMP-induced persistence/chlamydial stress has been limited.",

In an earlier study that reported inhibition of C. trachomatis infectivity in HeLa cells exposed to cell-permeant cAMP before infection, pretreatment with an ionophore which selectively increases the level of intracellular calcium abolished the anti-chlamydial effect of cAMP.

In both macrophages and HeLa cells, ATP signaling via the P2X7 receptor was demonstrated to act at least in part via phospholipase D activation; in the case of macrophages this was associated with lysosome/vacuole fusion [12,13]. Finally, extracellular adenosine-dependent induction of chlamydial persistence/stress was shown to act via A2b receptor stimulation, and although this was demonstrated to be cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)-independent, the authors noted that both cell-permeant and non-permeant cAMP exerted a similar effect as adenosine and postulated that cAMP is downstream of adenosine signaling and might be responsible for the observed effects [14]. Notably, adenosine-dependent induction of chlamydial persistence/stress was reported to occur in both the presence and absence of cycloheximide, leading the authors to conclude that de novo host cell protein synthesis was not required for the observed effects of adenosine [14]. Likewise, the data reported here, in which cycloheximide was included in the incubation medium and remained on the cells for the duration of the experiments, further supports the previous findings and conclusion. Furthermore, we can conclude from parallel evaluation of the effects of DAMPs in the presence/absence of cycloheximide, that extracellular adenosine can exert similar anti-chlamydial effects in the absence or presence of new host cell protein synthesis, while anti-chlamydial effects of cAMP and ATP are abolished, or even reversed, when host cells have uninhibited protein synthesis capabilities.",

In support of this, the exposure of C. trachomatis L2-infected HeLa cells to 1 mM cAMP has previously been reported to inhibit normal inclusion development, with no indicated observation of cytotoxicity or cell loss upon 48 hours of treatment [24]. Additionally, the addition of 25 \u03bcM EHNA/ 50 \u03bcM ADO to C. trachomatis L2- and C. trachomatis D-infected HeLa cells was previously shown to inhibit chlamydial inclusion development, and cytotoxic effects were not reported [14]. In contrast, extracellular ATP, at concentrations including 1 mM, is well known to induce apoptosis in various cell types, particularly immune cells and transformed cells, and causes a characteristic microscopic appearance including reduced cell surface microvilli, shrunken cells with increased membrane blebbing, and nuclear condensation and/or fragmentation [28,29]. However, we observed no signs of ATP-induced cytotoxicity at any concentration evaluated (by fluorescence or electron microscopy). In support of this finding, (i) previous studies have indicated cycloheximide (used at 1 \u03bcg/ml in incubation medium in all experiments shown here) abrogates the morphological effects of ATP-induced apoptosis [28]; (ii) HeLa cells are resistant to extracellular ATP-induced apoptosis, a characteristic thought to be attributable to expression of high levels of a truncated purinergic receptor (P2X7) [13] and/or expression of human papillomavirus oncogenes that may offer additional protection against apoptosis [38]; and, finally, (iii) Chlamydia-infected cells, including epithelial cells, are protected against induced apoptosis [39].",

Both chlamydial species, however, recovered significantly after exposure to ADO, indicating that all DAMPs evaluated in this study might not be exerting an identical effect on the chlamydiae. Additionally, our data suggest that cAMP can exert a similar effect whether or not the molecule is cell-permeant, however, we cannot rule out some entry into the host cells of non-cell-permeant cAMP, making it unclear whether or not cAMP and 8BrCAMP are acting via a shared or distinct mechanism. Also, we showed that exposure of C. pecorum-infected cells to apyrase alone, an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP, added in the absence of addition of exogenous ATP, increased inclusion size compared to mock treated controls, though this reduction did not reach statistical significance.

            "text": "We also report that infectious EB production in DAMP-exposed chlamydiae does not in all cases correlate well with inclusion size or mean bacteria per inclusion. For example, in the presence of cycloheximide, C. pecorum showed a greater than 99% decrease in the production of infectious EB upon exposure to EHNA/ADO, despite the fact that corresponding mean bacteria per inclusion was reduced by only 36%, suggesting that microscopically typical-appearing bacteria were in fact non-infectious after exposure to DAMPs. Because, in the absence of cycloheximide, cAMP- and ATP-dependent reduced chlamydial inclusion size still failed to correlate with reduced infectious EB production, we can conclude that, both in the presence and absence of de novo host protein synthesis, inclusion size is not a good measure of infectious EB production in all cases. This is in agreement with a recent report indicating that chlamydial protein synthesis, but not chlamydial replication, is required for normal expansion of C. trachomatis inclusions [40]. It can thus be speculated that the DAMP-dependent reduction of inclusion size observed for C. pecorum and C. trachomatis serotype E occurs, in part, independently of host cell de novo protein synthesis, and may result from mechanisms requiring bacterial protein synthesis. In contrast, the cAMP- and ATP-dependent reduction of infectious EB release by the chlamydial species evaluated appears to depend on inhibited host cell protein synthesis.",

            "text": "Recovery, as expected, appears to depend upon the re-entry of chlamydiae into the normal developmental cycle, since the two groups that did not recover within 24 hours of discontinuation of DAMP-exposure, namely C. trachomatis exposed to cAMP or ATP, showed a reduction in mean bacteria per inclusion of at least 94%, more in line with the infectious EB reduction. This additionally supports the idea that DAMPs may induce persistence under some circumstances but may cause irreversible inhibition (killing) of chlamydial development under other circumstances. In conclusion, while the mechanisms responsible for DAMP-dependent chlamydial persistence/stress remain to be elucidated, the data presented here, along with that of previous studies evaluating DAMP-induced persistence/chlamydial stress, suggests damage/danger signaling may play a significant role in the host/pathogen interactions that regulate chlamydial infections. In vivo concentrations of the evaluated DAMPs vary, but are generally relatively low. Intracellular ATP levels are typically in the 3\u201310 mM range, with extracellular levels rising into the hundreds of \u03bcM range under physiological stress [41]. Adenosine tissue levels are normally in the nM range, but may rise as high as 100 \u03bcM in inflamed/ischemic tissues [42]. Normal physiological cAMP levels approach the \u03bcM range, however, broad variations in cAMP levels induced by various stimuli in various tissues are of unknown biological importance [43]. Because lysis of host cells during Chlamydia infection, and various other infections, has the potential to markedly increase local concentrations of DAMPs at the site of infection, DAMPs may play a role in the progression of Chlamydia infection in vivo, particularly in the context of poly-microbial infections.",
