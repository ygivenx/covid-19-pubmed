HRVs are a well established cause of the common cold, an upper respiratory illness characterized by rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, cough, sore throat and sneezing; more than half of upper respiratory illnesses are caused by HRVs [4]. Recently, several studies have suggested that HRVs may be associated with more severe illness, including hospitalized lower respiratory disease and asthma exacerbations [5], [6]\n[7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]. Also, some studies suggest that infection with HRV-C may result in more severe illness compared to illness with other species [1], [2], [16], [17].",

The reported prevalence of HRV detection among asymptomatic persons ranges from 12\u201322% among children and 9% among adults with immunocompromising conditions [19], [20], [21], [22]. Consequently, the clinical relevance of detection of HRV among hospitalized patients can be difficult to interpret and better studies are needed to ascertain the role of HRVs as pathogens to spur efforts to develop treatment and prevention modalities. To that end, we took advantage of a study in rural Thailand that concurrently enrolled hospitalized patients with acute lower respiratory illness, a sample of outpatients with influenza-like illness, and control outpatients without fever or respiratory symptoms from the same hospitals to better define the etiologic role of HRV infection and associated disease burden in this community.",

Briefly, residents of Sa Kaeo province, Thailand who were identified in active population-based surveillance for hospitalized acute respiratory illness were approached for enrollment into a pneumonia etiology study during September 1, 2003 through August 31, 2005. Enrollment occurred in all 8 hospitals in Sa Kaeo province. A patient was eligible for enrollment if he/she had at least one sign of acute infection (e.g. fever, abnormal white blood cell count) plus signs or symptoms of lower respiratory tract disease (e.g. cough, abnormal breath sounds) and the physician ordered a chest radiograph within 48 hours of admission. Each enrolled patient had a nasopharyngeal swab, acute and convalescent serum, and demographic information collected. We considered repeat hospitalizations that occurred \u226514 days after the previous discharge date as individual hospitalizations. Chest radiographs were read by an expert panel as described previously [24].",

All specimens were tested by a laboratory blinded to patient status, e.g., hospitalized, outpatient, or control. Nasopharyngeal specimens were tested for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) 1, 2, and 3, influenza viruses A and B, adenovirus, Legionella species, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumonia, and rhinovirus/enterovirus (Table S1). HRV was detected from respiratory specimens by first testing with RT-PCR primers to detect rhinovirus/enterovirus as described in Roghmann, et al [26]. To discriminate between HRVs and human enteroviruses, PCR positive samples were retrospectively subjected to a second round of semi-nested PCR using HRV-specific primers as described in Miller, et al. [11]. Viral isolation was performed for RSV, HPIV, influenza viruses and adenovirus. Paired sera was tested for RSV, HMPV, HPIV 1,2 and 3, adenovirus, influenza, Legionella sp., Chlamydia penumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae as described [23], [27]. For HRV, a positive RT-PCR result was considered a positive result. For other pathogens, a positive culture, RT-PCR, or four-fold rise in serology was considered a positive test result. Serologic testing and PCR assays for Legionella sp., Chlamydia penumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were only performed on patients enrolled during the first study year, September 2003\u2013August 31, 2004 and interpreted as previously described [27]. In addition, diagnostic testing included urine pneumococcal surface antigen assay among pneumonia patients aged \u226518 years. HRV positive samples from hospitalized and control patients during September 1, 2004 through August 31, 2005 were further identified to species by RT-PCR and sequencing of partial region of the VP1 (D. Erdman, unpublished, method available on request). Specimens that were VP1 negative were further tested using primers that amplified partial VP4/VP2 or 5\u2032NCR regions [28].",

However, this age group also had a high frequency of HRV detections among young control children without respiratory symptoms or fever. Thus, our rates may not reflect the actual burden of HRV-associated illness among hospitalized pediatric patients; we cannot differentiate those children who were hospitalized with HRV-associated illness versus those that may not have had symptoms due to HRV despite HRV shedding. Several reports suggest that young children shed HRVs for more than one week [19], [20], [22]. Therefore, it is possible that HRV detection among ill or non-ill children might be from a previous illness. We did not ask controls about illness more than three days previously or follow them to see if they became ill, and no hospitalized patients were asked about prior illness unrelated to the hospitalization. Also, the presence of rhinorrhea was not an exclusion criterion for controls and was not recorded; recording rhinorrhea and previous history of illness would improve the useful of this type of control. Thus, while patients with HRV detections were associated with hospitalized lower respiratory tract illness, it is not possible to determine the actual number or burden of HRV- associated illnesses among pediatric patients. Additional studies, especially those with a longitudinally followed cohort, are needed to better characterize HRV-associated illness among hospitalized children.",

We did not enroll hospitalized patients who met the clinical case definition for acute lower respiratory illness but did not have a chest radiograph ordered within 48 hours of admission or who presented with other clinical syndromes, including those with exacerbations of underlying disease. Patients with acute lower respiratory illness who did not get a chest radiograph tended to be younger and possibly less seriously ill (i.e., fewer intubations and fatalities) (HC Baggett, person. comm.). Some patients with acute lower respiratory illness who did not get a chest radiograph may have had illness due to HRV; thus, our incidence estimates for hospitalized HRV-associated illness may be underestimated. Although only 45% of eligible patients were enrolled, we found few differences in clinical characteristics between those who were enrolled compared to those who were not enrolled. However, young children and those in the intensive care unit were less likely to enroll in the etiology study (HC Baggett, person. comm.). Our study results may not be representative of all young children and seriously ill. Also, we were able to test for limited bacterial co-detections among children and did not have blood cultures. In addition, we only tested for atypical bacteria during one year. Thus, we likely missed some bacterial co-detections. Finally, our outpatient sample was a convenience sample and may not be representative of the population in Sa Kaeo Province; few adults were enrolled in the outpatient setting with influenza-like illness.",

While further studies are needed to characterize the true burden of HRV-associated pediatric hospitalizations, new treatment or prevention modalities effective against HRV would likely reduce what appears to be a substantial morbidity associated with HRV-associated illness.",
