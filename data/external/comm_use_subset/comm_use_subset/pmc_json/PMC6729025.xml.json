            "text": "The American College of Rheumatology and European League Against Rheumatism have been continuously updating the guidelines and recommendations for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment over the last two decades due to the constant development of new anti-rheumatic drugs [1, 2]. Among them, DNA and selected autoantigen- or peptide-based vaccines are some of the most promising new therapeutic strategies for RA treatment [3\u20137]. The recently developed Rheumavax, which is based on autologous dendritic cells modified with a nuclear factor \u03baB inhibitor exposed to four citrullinated peptide antigens, has completed safety trials with promising results in a single-center, open-labeled, first-in-human phase I trial [8]. Additionally, several DNA vaccines based on anti-cytokine and -chicken type II collagen (CCII) and targeting the B7-2/CD28 co-stimulatory signaling pathway have completed pre-clinical trials [3\u20137, 9\u201315]. By comparison, the advantage of DNA vaccines for the treatment of RA is obvious and fascinating. First, compared to immunosuppressants, such as synthetic and biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) [16, 17] even newly marketed oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors [18], DNA vaccines don\u2019t induce generalized immunosuppression which is associated with various adverse effects and thus do not compromise host defense and increase risk of infection [3\u20137, 9\u201311, 14, 15]. Secondly, compared to the emerging antigen-specific immunotherapies involve tolerogenic antigens or peptides, dendritic cells (DCs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs) therapies, small interfering RNAs (siRNA)-based therapy, etc. [19\u201325], DNA vaccines can be prepared in large quantities and at low cost, and they can be stored for long periods due to their good stability [12, 13]. Lastly, more to the point is the fact that the antigen-specific DNA vaccines show good therapeutic efficacy and relative long-term durable responses potentially by inducing immune tolerance targeted specific self-antigens to regulate the whole network of immune system and re-establish immune balance [3\u20137, 9, 14, 15]. For these reasons, DNA vaccines will undoubtedly be an innovative personalized therapeutic strategies in the arena of RA immunotherapy.",

            "text": "Type II collagen (CII) is a critical autoantigen in RA pathogenesis. Native chicken type II collagen (nCCII) was shown to be effective in the treatment of RA patients [26\u201329]. However, the purified nCCII can cause its structural degeneration and loss of biological function, and can also be contaminated by pathogenic viruses. Based on these valuable findings, we previously developed the pcDNA-CCOL2A1 therapeutic vaccine encoding CCII and found that its efficacy was comparable to that of the current gold standard drug methotrexate (MTX) in a rat model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) [9]. More recently, we showed that pcDNA-CCOL2A1 was safe and well-tolerated as a therapeutic vaccine, did not markedly affect the balance of humoral and cellular immune responses, and had no immunogenicity in normal rats when administered by intramuscular injection [10, 11]. Integrated all research evidence from our studies strongly suggest that pcDNA-CCOL2A1 is promising therapeutic DNA vaccine. However, it should be pointed out here that DNA vaccine pcDNA-CCOL2A1 was injected intramuscularly for the targeted DNA delivery in the present study. Actually, there have so far been various vehicles or technologies for DNA delivery used in preclinical or clinical trials [30\u201332]. The viral vector is the earliest and most used carrier to deliver and protect DNA, but its use in gene therapy have been restricted due to the risks of triggering severe immune response and inserting into genome. Consequently, the non-viral DNA delivery systems such as physical methods and chemical vectors have also been developed to transfer DNA into cells. The physical methods do not use carriers but relies on a physical force that enhance the cell membrane permeability to facilitate the gene into cells, including needle, microneedle and jet injection, electroporation, gene gun, ultrasound, and hydrodynamic injection. The chemical vectors are to prepare the carriers by chemical methods to carry DNA into the nucleus, such as electrostatic attraction between anionic DNA and a cationic lipid or polymer, DNA encapsulation using various biodegradable polymers to prepare micrometric or nanometric spherical structures containing DNA by various advanced preparation technologies, and biological transfection mediators for example protein transduction domains (PTDs) namely cell penetrating peptides and exosomes, etc. [31, 32]. All of these technologies will support the development of preparations and formulations for the clinical application of this DNA vaccine pcDNA-CCOL2A1 in the near future.",

According to the vaccine regulations by both FDA and CFDA, the study on pharmacokinetics of any new developed DNA vaccines must be carried out before clinical trial application. These include the evaluation of dynamic profiles or persistence, biodistribution, integration risk, etc. [33\u201335]. To this end, in the present study we evaluated the dynamic profiles of pcDNA-CCOL2A1 in blood and the biodistribution of CCOL2A1 mRNA and CCII protein, and investigated whether plasmid integration occurred in various tissues of vaccinated normal rodent. This is the first time to investigate the pharmacokinetics of this DNA vaccine from both gene and protein level. The revealing of pharmacokinetics and genome integration risk will be very helpful for future clinical trial applications.",

There was almost no bioluminescence in the back and abdomen of rats at 4 h and on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 14, 21, and 28 post injection in all three repeated and independent experiments (Fig. 3a). Considering that the dosage may be too low to generate protein, a higher dosage of 3 mg/kg DNA vaccine was injected intramuscularly in rats including the ones shaved. Likewise, there is still no observable BLI signal appearing (data not shown). Given the weakness of the signal due to the thickness of the fur, we also investigated the dynamic profiles of CCII protein in BALB/c mice injected intramuscularly or intravenously with the vaccine. The signal intensity was significantly higher in mice than in rats at comparable doses of pcDNA-CCOL2A1 (430 \u03bcg/kg). The Fig. 3b showed the results of biodistribution and persistence of CCII protein from three vaccinated MALE mice injected via the intramuscular route. The BLI signals appeared in the injected left hind thigh site starting from 2 h post-injection until day 35. The results from three female mice were not displayed because there were almost no bioluminescence observed in the injected left hind thigh site except abdominal image on day 1 and 2 post-injection. The Fig. 3c showed the dorsal imaging results of CCII protein from three vaccinated FEMALE mice from 6 h to day 42 (signals appeared in the injected tail site from 6 h to day 10) and the abdominal image from three vaccinated MALE mice only at 2 h and 6 h (signals may appeared in the liver) injected via the intravenous route. The signals from tail injection site were weaker and only appeared on male mouse 1# from day 1 to 7; but the signals may from liver were never observed on FEMALE mice in 3 independent experiments. The BLI values each day in Fig. 3d were from one mouse which showed the more continuous expression of CCII protein in injected muscle or tail site, respectively. And the BLI signal intensity varied by 104 fold. In short, the CCII protein had disappeared by day 42 both vaccination via the intramuscular and intravenous route in mice. These results indicate that in vivo imaging using a combination of pcDNA-CCOL2A1 and the luciferase gene can profile the relative biodistribution and persistence of CCII protein in the host.\n",

An analysis of various tissues revealed that the transcript was only present at the injection site\u2013the muscle between days 3 and 14 post-immunization, after which time it was detected in heart, liver, lung, and kidney but not in the spleen or thymus. On day 28, the expression was restricted to the lung. Importantly, there was no CCOL2A1 transcript present in the reproductive organs at any time point. These results confirm the rapid clearance of the pcDNA-CCOL2A1 and underscore its safety advantage over vaccines derived from pathogenic microorganisms that may persistently express an exogenous gene in the host. Our results are mostly consistent with data from other animal species demonstrating that plasmid DNA introduced by injection or electroporation can be cleared within several minutes, hours, or up to 60 days [38\u201340]. Peak times of maximum plasmid DNA concentration at the injection site showed similar variability. In previous studies, the biodistribution of naked plasmid DNA encoding fibroblast growth factor type 1 was limited to the injection site while plasma and serum were negative in the majority of treated patients, which differed from results obtained using vascular endothelial growth factor-A vaccine [41\u201343] and the pcDNA-CCOL2A1 therapeutic vaccine used here. These discrepancies are likely due to the target of different genes and the use of different expression vectors, although in all of these studies a human or animal structural gene was targeted.",

Although other routes of administration can in theory increase the transfection efficiency, the persistence of plasmid DNA in the target tissue may be affected, which could increase the risk of integration into the host genome.

In the present study, we used this approach to investigate the therapeutic action of pcDNA-CCOL2A1 in vivo by evaluating the distribution of CCII protein in real time. We used a luciferase reporter to track the expressed CCII protein. Under conditions of ATP and oxygen, the substrate luciferin is oxidized by the expressed luciferase, and the resultant bioluminescence enabled quantitation and localization of the fused CCOL2A1 gene product while avoiding background fluorescence from fur or from food in the gastrointestinal tract. Thus, BLI can be used to detect expressed proteins with high sensitivity, although the intensity of the signal is weaker than that of fluorescent molecules. For this reason, it was difficult to detect signals in vaccinated Wistar rats. In live imaging experiments of vaccinated mice, there was considerable inter-individual variability. For example, not every mouse had a BLI signal at a given time point; moreover, differences in the signal were observed between the two sexes and between dorsal and abdominal positions of signal acquisition. Besides these inherent factors, the injection speed and site may have contributed to the variability. Therefore, we have presented only relatively consistent results from a few mice.",

            "text": "Plasmid DNA vectors can potentially be incorporated into the host genome via random integration, homologous recombination, or a retroviral mechanism [31]. This can increase the probability of chromosomal insertion mutation, genomic instability, dysregulation of cell growth, disruption/inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, and oncogenesis [30, 50, 51]. Integration of exogenous DNA into germ cells can induce genetic defects in offspring [52]. Although random integration of plasmid DNA into the host genome following intramuscular delivery or electroporation has been reported [53], the probability of such events is considered to be extremely low [44, 45, 54\u201357]. Nonetheless, we investigated the potential for genomic integration of pcDNA-CCOL2A1 and found that no CCOL2A1 transcript was detected in any of the analyzed tissues at a detection limit of approximately 182 copies/\u03bcg DNA, indicating that the risk of integration of plasmid DNA vaccines delivered by intramuscular injection is negligible. The mammalian genome is thought to have a mechanism for identifying and degrading foreign nucleotide sequences [58, 59]; our observations support this possibility [46, 54]. It is worth noting that tissues that were positive for CCOL2A1 transcript were found to be negative in the analysis of plasmid DNA integration. We can therefore conclude that the plasmid DNA remained extrachromosomal and was rapidly degraded, and therefore posed little risk of germline transmission. So far there are several consensus mechanisms by which plasmid DNA vaccines including our pcDNA-CCOL2A1 are cleared from the vaccinated animals or human bodies though we did not do this experiment in the present study. First mechanism is that extracellular and blood plasmid DNA is quickly degraded by enzymes such as nuclease [3, 36]. Second mechanism is that antigen-expressing cells from muscle can be cleared by immune system cells [3, 36]. Third mechanism is that plasmid DNA vaccines are degraded in cytoplasm and then released through exocytosis [60]. Fourth mechanism is that plasmid DNA vaccines by intravascular delivery are quickly degraded in liver [36]. In addition, plasmid DNA vaccines in gene gun bombarded skin are quickly cleared due to the normal sloughing of the epidermis [60].",
