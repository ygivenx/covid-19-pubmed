Henceforth, academic journals, libraries sources, local and internal Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) data, data from research funded or non-funded projects, centers and institutions should be committed to FOA data and results sharing relevant to the current Zika public health crisis and future emergencies for rapidly emergency mobilization and response. Moreover, the approach has proved to be useful in translation and application of proven and reliable knowledge in guiding effective decision making policies, lifestyle adaptations and contextual programs and strategies in improving public health social economic development and well-being of local and global community\n2,\n4,\n6,\n7. Most data and information often used in global policies and initiatives are either guaranteed as free by the World Health Organization (WHO) and partners philanthropic organizations, whereas the bulk of support references and documents are not readily accessible to most African scholars, but mainly to policy-makers and implementers\n8.

Advocacy and mitigation on lack to limited access of existing and emerging data, and information sharing is necessary in embracing regional and global open access. These novelties in information sharing approaches towards collective learning and participative engagement for sound knowledge and empowerment for better health, information exchange for equity in quality education and utilization are paramount for human and societal benefits. It is of fundamental importance to increase multi-disciplinary and inter-sectoral partnerships and collaborations not only to understand and fill the gaps through joint or independent research, but also to be able to use and mine unrestricted data and information for public health good, economic growth and sustainable development\n9,\n10. Although decades of funded and non-funded programs and projects in both developed and developing countries have generated millions of publications and databases on emerging and infectious diseases of poverty\n2,\n4,\n6. The impact of policy-translation of lessons learnt and experiences gained are seldom and limited in applications mostly in developing countries. As most LMICs are still challenged with weak health systems and low literacy mainly in remote rural areas and areas of political instability, inadequacies in health funding allocation and resources capacity, poor accountability and governance are present. Moreover, inefficiencies in management and lack of a multi-sectoral approach to access and use local or national data repositories in a structured manner prevent both mainstream national and regional economic development\n11. Furthermore, the usefulness in forecasting, prevention and management or smart response of emergency situations and disasters are yet to be fully documented and demonstrated in Africa. FOA viability and benefit in most tropical endemics and epidemics-prone developed and developing countries affirmed that the vast majority of metadata and database platforms are still locked (inaccessible and unavailable) for public use and untapped to global community multi-dimensional gains.",

Thus, there is an urgent need for open data and information access promotion, advocacy and awareness. This is critical in strengthening and improving the strategic value and usefulness of knowledge-based innovations, teaching and learning, key sources and assets of policy transformation oriented research and primary care innovations (e.g., routine to universal immunization, essential medicines and nutrition). Adopting and adapting open access proven lessons learnt and experiences to alleviate sufferings and poverty, health literacy access and delivery inequities amongst vulnerable populations in Africa is very important\n2,\n5,\n15,\n16. The evolving use of electronic data and digital delivery platforms to support open access interactive literacy, communication and empowerment of health is a vital need in increasing care acceptability, uptake and scaling up positive cultural ad behavioral changes relevant for communicable and non-communicable diseases vigilance and resilience\n1,\n17,\n18. However, with restricted content access, such anticipated evolution in terms of accurate timing and relevant knowledge among experts remains to be a blatant wish as technology and information are not mutually exclusive. Digital technology is only but a driver of available content and hence it thrives, and finds usefulness in the context of information, particularly transformative evidence for universal global health resources access and sharing benefits for all.",

Predominantly, with the challenges of electricity shortage and costly internet services, most open access African users\u2019 tendency is increasingly familiar with Google and other internet search engines to discover or access information. Hence, any FOA platform should be user-friendly, non-bias choice, interoperability and flexible. That is, accessibility should not depend on articles being accessed via a special portal or proxy server or publishing platforms, or via complex authorization systems, but should be readily and freely available to all re-users or users consumers and redistribution within the ethical and legal framework. Information should be readily reached without barriers targeting all cadres of technocrats from those with basic training and skills to the advanced. Tested models have proved this relevance and lesson for progressive improvement can be adopted\n16,\n17,\n22. One of the implications of not doing so is not being able to find information easily using online systems\n14,\n22,\n23. Consequently, researchers and policy-makers and implementers in LMICs have to spend enough time to be informed, consolidate and synthesize what types of information and knowledge can be adaptable, scalable, cost-effective and translated in intervention and best practices\n14,\n22,\n23.
