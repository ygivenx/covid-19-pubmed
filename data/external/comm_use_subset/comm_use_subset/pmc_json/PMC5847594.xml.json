            "text": "The so-called cellular immune response1 is based on a specific recognition system that is present in virtually every nucleated cell in the organism. As part of regular intracellular protein synthesis, some proteins are marked for degradation and proteolytically cleaved into smaller fragments (called peptides) that are then displayed at the cell surface2. The key molecules in this process are specialized protein-receptors known as class I major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs)1,2, which bind and display these intracellular peptides. Thanks to this peptide-presenting pathway, T-cell lymphocytes that circulate throughout the body scanning cell surfaces can monitor the intracellular content in almost every tissue. This allows for immune recognition of diseased cells (e.g., infected or tumoral). These peptide-MHC (pMHC) complexes (Fig. 1) can then be recognized by direct interaction with T-cell receptors (TCRs), activating T-cell cytolysis and triggering the elimination of the diseased cell3. Note that class II MHC molecules have a distinct structure2, are limited in expression to specialized immune cells, and are involved in a different pathway; they will not be discussed here.",

In fact, the MHC region is the most variable segment of the entire human genome: there are more than 8,000 known protein variants (or allotypes) of class I MHCs in the human population5, with up to 6 different allotypes per individual1. Besides its importance for anti-viral immunity and vaccine development, the recognition of pMHC complexes is a key factor in autoimmunity, response to tissue transplantation, and immunity against tumors6,7. In recent years, analyses of tumor-derived peptides capable of binding to patient-specific MHCs have played an essential role in the development of personalized immunotherapies against cancer7. Although many other molecules are involved in intercellular interactions between T-cells and tumor cells, the structural and biochemical properties of a given pMHC complex represent the central recognition feature and the most important information provided to the T-cell6,8 (Fig. 1). In the context of immunotherapy, this information will define the chances that activated T-cells find and eliminate cancer cells throughout the body9; it will also determine the occurrence of potentially lethal off-target toxicities against healthy tissues (referred to as T-cell cross-reactivity)9\u201311.",

Computational methods such as molecular docking are the most promising tools for this task, given their efficiency and broad use for virtual screening of drug-like ligands18\u201320. Molecular docking allows for the computational prediction of the three-dimensional structure of protein-ligand complexes (i.e., their binding mode)21. Since ligands are flexible molecules that adopt alternative conformations (i.e., different \u201cshapes\u201d), docking tools must consider a ligand\u2019s rotatable bonds (i.e., its internal degrees of freedom, or DoFs), in addition to its position and orientation.",

Therefore, docking methods implement various heuristics to efficiently explore the ligand\u2019s conformational space and quickly find a low-energy docked conformation of the ligand. For that, binding mode prediction is guided by approximated binding energy calculations (through what is called a scoring function)21. Ideally, a docking tool should also be general, in the sense that the accuracy of the predictions should not be impacted by the type of protein receptor or the class of ligands. However, docking methods are known to be much less reliable when applied to larger ligands (e.g., ligands with more than 10 internal DoFs)22,23. For instance, peptides are known to be very flexible ligands24; binding mode prediction of even small peptides, composed of up to 5 amino acids (which means around 24 internal DoFs), can be particularly challenging for available docking methods25,26. This limitation makes the structural prediction of pMHC complexes an impossible task for most docking tools, since a typical MHC-binder is a peptide composed of 8 to 11 amino acids (which translates to more than 30 internal DoFs).",

            "text": "As reviewed in previous publications14,17, early attempts at predicting the geometry of pMHC structures usually divided the problem into smaller tasks, as a way to circumvent the limitations of docking tools. For instance, some methods focus on docking the two terminal residues of the peptide, resolving the central portion later13,14. Others first approximate the backbone conformation, and then predict the side chains of the peptide12,33\u201335. To make these divisions and approximations, these methods require ad-hoc constraints and are usually tailored towards specific MHC allotypes. There also exist methods relying on steps of molecular dynamics (MD)36,37. MD can be useful to explore near native conformations of side-chains, but its higher computational cost makes it a less attractive solution for efficient exploration of the entire peptide conformational space38. An attempt at a more efficient and yet general solution made use of grid potentials and a biased-probability Monte Carlo method14, implemented in the Internal Coordinate Mechanics (ICM) docking tool39. This method uses an MHC-specific scoring function trained on available crystal structures via statistical learning. Despite promising results on a small number of known pMHC complexes, the choice of a more specific scoring function and the assumptions on the location of the peptide\u2019s terminal amino acid residues raise questions about the generality of the method towards less prevalent MHC allotypes.",

The authors used available crystal structures of pMHCs as template for peptide backbone conformations, manually positioning the side chains of anchor residues in the expected locations within the binding site. This is justified by the fact that some peptide amino acid residues are known to stabilize the binding by interacting with deeper pockets in the MHC cleft41. Then, they conducted a backbone optimization step, followed by side chain prediction. Interestingly, good results were obtained for 5 selected allotypes, even when the template was from a different allotype. However, all reported examples involved complexes that had similar backbone conformations. In addition, the use of backbone templates and assumptions on the position of anchor residues represent important limitations of this method, since they might differ across different groups of MHC allotypes35,42. Even for a given MHC allotype, the peptide backbone changes significantly depending on its length. There is also evidence of peptides presenting alternative anchors42,43 or unusual binding modes44. The FlexPepDock refinement protocol was only applied to 9-mer peptides and a limited number of MHC allotypes. Therefore, it is not yet clear how general this method can be, with respect to these limitations.",

With the aim of developing a general tool for de novo pMHC geometry prediction, in this paper we describe a proof of concept study using an incremental meta-docking approach referred to as DINC (Docking INCrementally)23. DINC was previously developed by our group to predict the binding modes of peptidomimetic inhibitors57, based on a divide and conquer approach. In contrast to the methods described above, DINC makes no assumption on the location of particular amino acid residues or the shape of the peptide backbone. To evaluate DINC\u2019s applicability and generality in the context of prevalent human MHC allotypes, we performed a re-docking experiment on a diverse dataset of 25 pMHC complexes with available crystal structures. DINC was able to reproduce the binding modes of these complexes with an average error of 1.92 \u00c5. Our results also show the ability of this incremental method to reproduce non-standard binding modes. Finally, we discuss the benefits of having a general tool for pMHC geometry prediction in the growing field of cancer immunotherapy.",

As a first pre-processing step, all crystal structures were visually inspected and revised as needed20. For instance, water molecules were removed since they are not accounted for in our docking method. Also, in cases of duplicated side chains (i.e., conformational heterogeneity), the subset with lower occupancy was removed. Finally, in cases of multiple molecules per asymmetric unit only the first subset was kept (e.g., chains A, B and C). Revised structures were then submitted to a three steps energy minimization with GROMACS v4.6.560, using the steepest-descent and conjugate gradient methods. The GROMOS96 (53a6) force field was used with the SPC water model; a cutoff value of 1.2 nm was used for both van der Waals and Coulomb interactions, with Fast Particle-Mesh Ewald electrostatics (PME). After this procedure, water molecules were removed from the output files and the coordinates of the minimized complexes were saved into PDB format files. These minimized crystal structures will be hereafter referred to as \u201creference structures\u201d: they are the structures we aim to reproduce in this re-docking experiment. For that, the ligand and receptor in each complex are saved into independent PDB format files, and a docking software is used to reconstruct the original complex. The relevance of re-docking experiments lies in that the conformation and position of an input ligand are systematically randomized by the docking software.",

When computing the RMSD for all atoms of a peptide, between a predicted complex and its reference structure, the two pMHC complexes are first aligned based on the MHC structure. Therefore, the all-atom RMSD captures not only differences in conformation between the two binding modes, but also differences in position of the peptide inside the MHC cleft. While the all-atom RMSD captures changes in both the main chain and the side chains of the peptide, the C\u03b1 RMSD (i.e., RMSD for alpha carbons only) captures only changes in the main chain. Another goodness-of-fit measure is the Least Root Mean Square Deviation (LRMSD), computed after aligning the two peptide structures (as opposed to aligning the two MHC structures), either for all atoms or alpha carbons only. The LRMSD is a more precise evaluation of differences between two conformations of a peptide, irrespective of its position in the MHC cleft.",

The best conformation for this \u201cinitial fragment\u201d is selected using a scoring function, and expanded through the addition of another subset of atoms from the original peptide. This new expanded fragment is then docked, and this process is incrementally repeated until the entire peptide is reconstructed and docked. Note that the word \u201cfragment\u201d is used here with a different meaning than that of fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD). FBDD uses libraries of fragments, which are very small molecules with no more than two functional groups62, to create new drugs or drug-like ligands. DINC was inspired by these methods, but does not use any library of small molecules, and does not dock independent fragments that are later connected. In the context of DINC, the fragments are overlapping sections of the input ligand, docked sequentially to grow the ligand incrementally61.",

Genetic algorithms are a type of evolutionary technique that is commonly used for the stochastic sampling of ligand conformations in molecular docking64. For scoring, AutoDock 4 uses a semi-empirical free energy force field, including terms for dispersion/repulsion, hydrogen bonding, electrostatics and desolvation20,63.

Therefore, in our re-docking experiment, four alternative protocols were defined, exploring other combinations of parameter values.

It is the second most prevalent allotype in humans67,68 and arguably the HLA variant for which the most detailed and comprehensive data is available: more than 42,000 binding assays deposited in the Immune Epitope Database69. As reported in previous studies, HLA-A*02:01 binds mostly 9-mers, but also larger peptides. It was also reported that the HLA-A*02:01 binding cleft is fairly constrained, with little conformational variation across available crystal structures. It also presents a clear pattern of preferred anchor residues41 at both peptide termini: usually positions 2 (p2) and 9 (p9) of the 9-mer ligands (Fig. 5). Comparing available crystal structures, a shared conformational pattern was observed for the backbone of 9-mer peptides bound to HLA-A*02:0135. For example, this typical backbone pattern is observed in the crystal structure 3MRG, involving a virus-derived peptide (Fig. 5A). Some cancer-related peptides, however, are known to present unusual binding modes17. For instance, in the modified melanoma-associated antigen MART1-A27L the amino-terminal anchor to the HLA-A*02:01 binding cleft is p1 instead of p2. This alternative anchoring pattern creates a sideways deviation of the backbone in the middle of the peptide17, resulting in an unusual binding mode (Fig. 5B, 2GTW). In addition, larger peptides are known to present bulging conformations of the backbone, to accommodate a longer chain using the same anchoring pockets (Fig. 5A, 1I4F). DINC was able to reproduce each one of these 3 alternative backbone conformations, with sub-angstrom accuracy (Fig. 6).",

As expected, the conformation of 8-mers is more linear, with almost no bulged region between the two peptide termini (Fig. 5C, 4F7T). Currently, there are only two crystal structures of 9-mers bound to HLA-A*24:02, and they present different binding modes (Fig. 5C). According to the researchers who described these structures, the virus-derived peptide resolved in 3I6L shows an unusual binding mode, with a much more exposed p4 as compared to a regular self-derived peptide (2BCK). Further analysis of other crystal structures shows that the backbone conformation seen in 3I6L is very similar to that of 10-mer peptides bound to the same HLA (data not shown). In our re-docking experiment, DINC was able to reproduce all these binding modes (Fig. 6), as well as other 10-mers bound to HLA-A*24:02 (Supplementary Table S1). In the case of 3I6L, the authors claim that the observed binding mode is stabilized by an internal hydrogen bond established by p3, whose side chain is pointing towards the center of the binding cleft. The binding mode predicted by DINC for this complex does not feature this specific hydrogen bond (as determined by UCSF Chimera), but a similar orientation of p3 is observed (Fig. 6F).",

Therefore, the chances of obtaining different results in independent runs of AutoDock 4 increase with ligand size. A similar variability is observed across independent DINC jobs. However, this is not a problem here, as our goal was only to determine if DINC could predict different binding modes of pMHC complexes within a reasonable time. By providing a proof of concept that this goal is indeed attainable, we can now open new avenues for developing even better algorithms inspired by the meta-docking incremental approach. In fact, since only a few protocols were used in the context of this study, there is great potential for further improvement. As future work, we will perform a thorough evaluation of the parameters and heuristics in DINC in order to improve its efficiency and achieve fast, accurate and reproducible geometry prediction of pMHC complexes.",

For that, we limited our analysis to a re-docking experiment involving a diverse dataset of human pMHCs. Receptor flexibility is another important challenge27 and should be taken into consideration when predicting pMHC complexes83. In fact, MHC flexibility can affect peptide loading, and peptide binding can induce local changes in the MHC receptor84,85. However, the folding of MHC receptors is highly-conserved. Therefore, a docking protocol accounting for receptor flexibility could be combined with homology modeling to predict the binding modes of peptides to MHC allotypes for which no structural information is available14,16.

We argue that the use of incremental docking offers a new strategy to overcome these limitations. Our work shows that incremental docking allows handling different MHC allotypes, predicting unusual binding modes, and obtaining accurate structural prediction for peptides with up to 41 rotatable bonds. In addition, being a meta-docking approach, our method avoids the need for new docking software. We postulate that a similar incremental process could be implemented using different docking software, achieving similar or even better results. As a proof of concept, our study represents a landmark in the advancement of methods for geometry prediction of pMHC complexes. Future developments of these methods are expected to have a positive impact in many fields related to human health, including vaccine development and tissue transplantation. In particular, fast and accurate prediction of patient-specific pMHC complexes will be key for the development of safe and effective T-cell-based immunotherapies against cancer.",

DINC starts by selecting a small fragment of the peptide (top left), with only 6 DoFs (depicted in green), and using it as input for the first round of docking to the MHC binding cleft (cross-section view depicted in gray). The best binding modes are selected across multiple parallel docking runs, and the corresponding peptide fragments are expanded by adding a small number of atoms (depicted in red, top center). These expanded fragments are used as input for the second round of docking (top center), in which a new set of 6 flexible DoFs is considered flexible. These flexible DoFs involve some of the \u201cnew\u201d atoms (in red) and some of the atoms that were already present in the previous fragment (in blue). This process continues until the entire ligand has been reconstructed and docked (bottom right). For this particular 8-mer peptide (composed of 136 atoms), DINC has to perform 9 docking rounds; only the first three (top row) and the last three (bottom row) are depicted.",
