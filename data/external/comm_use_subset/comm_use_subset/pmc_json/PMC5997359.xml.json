After first isolation of CHIKV in 1952 in present-day Tanzania, outbreaks and epidemics were limited to regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. In 2013, CHIKV emerged for the first time in the Americas, with sustained autochthonous transmission and rapid spread through the region [1\u20133]. The acute symptoms of CHIKV infection are similar to those of infection with other arbovirus species, including Dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and Mayaro virus (MAYV), each presenting with a constellation of symptoms including fever, headache, and myalgias/arthralgias. Long-term, CHIKV infections have been linked with persistent arthralgias in a subset of cases[3]; it has also been reported that upwards of 90% of CHIKV-infected individuals are symptomatic, in contrast to findings with ZIKV, where it is estimated that only 20% of infected persons are symptomatic [4,5].",

In a recent literature review, co-infections with CHIKV and DENV ranged from 1% to 34% of patients [6]. However, virtually no data are available on frequency of co-infection with CHIKV and arboviruses other than DENV. Even where good laboratory diagnostic facilities are available, identification of co-infections often does not occur, as there is a tendency to cease investigation once an initial pathogen has been identified, and/or identification of a second pathogen may require facilities for virus isolation, which may not be available.",

We have previously reported isolation of ZIKV [8], DENV [9], Human coronavirus NL63 [10], and Enterovirus D68 [11] from children in this school cohort; however, the cases/outbreaks in these prior publications did not include CHIKV, or cases within the May-August, 2014, time frame of the current study.

Similarly, we designed sequencing primers for MAYV and ZIKV that also amplify approximately 800bp overlapping segments, and used a primer walking method for whole genome sequencing of those viruses [8,18]. For the sequencing of DENV, primers described by Christenbury et al were utilized [20]. Amplification of each segment was performed using an Accuscript high-fidelity first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) followed by PCR with Phusion polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). The 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 ends of the viral genomes were obtained using RNA-ligase mediated (RLM) systems for 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) per the manufacturer\u2019s protocols (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Amplicons were purified, sequenced bi-directionally, then the sequences assembled with the use of Sequencher DNA sequence analysis software v2.1 (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI), and subsequently analyzed in comparison to DENV, MAYV, and ZIKV sequences available in GenBank for nucleotide sequence comparisons. The vRNA sequences we obtained differed from those of the corresponding viruses in our repository, confirming the newly analyzed sequences did not arise from laboratory contamination.",

Two demographic priors were also tested for each analysis: constant population size or non-parametric Bayesian Skyline Plot (BSP). Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) were run for 50\u2013200 million generations (sampled at fixed intervals to obtain posterior distributions with 10,000 data points), depending on the data set, in order to assure proper mixing of the MCMC, which was assessed on the basis of the effective sampling size (ESS) of each parameter estimate, accepting only ESS values >200. The best clock/demographic model for each virus-specific data set was chosen by comparing marginal likelihood estimates (MLE) [35], obtained using path sampling (PS) and stepping-stone sampling (SS) methods [33,36] with Bayes Factor (BF) (S2 Table).

Eight cultures displayed CPE inconsistent with those expected for CHIKV (Fig 2).

As a starting point in unraveling these dynamics, we were interested in better quantifying the frequency of such infections, and exploring possible origins of co-infecting strains. To optimize our ability to identify co-infections (and following standard practices in our laboratory [8,17,19,39]), we continued diagnostic studies even after initial identification of CHIKV or another pathogen in a patient sample. Interestingly, while we identified multiple co-infecting viruses in cell culture, the original patient rtRT-PCR in this study was, in each instance, negative for the second pathogen, suggesting that viral loads for the co-infecting species were low. We also had instances where viral cultures were negative in the setting of a positive rtRT-PCR, possibly reflecting the presence of non-viable virus in the sample, and/or strains that have mutated or which do not grow well in Vero cells. If we are to better understand the role of co-infections in disease occurrence, the diagnostic significance of both rtRT-PCR negative/culture positive and rtRT-PCR positive/culture negative samples will require further study.",

Another study from the Colombian-Venezuelan border reports a CHIKV/DENV co-infection prevalence of 7.6% [43]. In our study, in contrast, the co-infection rate was only 1%, with only two additional dengue cases (both DENV-1) identified among CHIKV-negative patients; this may reflect a low level of circulating DENV in the community during the CHIKV epidemic, and/or a high existing level of population immunity to the virus. We also identified one CHIKV/MAYV co-infection. We have previously reported a mixed MAYV and DENV-1 infection that occurred outside of the time frame of the CHIKV epidemic (January, 2015) in the same school cohort [18]. The high genomic similarity of this Haitian MAYV isolate with a Brazilian strain isolated in 1960 corroborates our hypothesis that MAYV has been criptically circulating in the human population at a sub-epidemic level, most likely in Brazil, for years and that it was introduced just recently onto Hispaniola [24].",

As we have previously reported [39], urine can be positive for ZIKV for a longer period of time than plasma; if we had also screened urine, there is the possibility that we would have identified additional ZIKV-positive patients. We, and others, have previously reported cases of ZIKV/CHIKV co-infection [19,42,44,45], so finding the two together is not surprising. The ZIKV case cluster in the current study would appear to have been relatively widespread within the community (i.e., not a point source at the school), as one of the six co-infections was from a child at a different school campus, ca. 5 miles from the main campus. Interestingly, our molecular clock analysis indicates that the strains of CHIKV and ZIKV found in our patients were both introduced in Haiti within the same short time frame, each one giving rise to a well-supported monophyletic clade, one including all CHIKVs from CHIKV/ZIKV co-infected subjects, the other one including all ZIKVs from the same co-infected subjects. The simultaneous emergence of these two clades in the Haitian population is compatible with a simultaneous co-infection scenario or indicate, at the very least, the sequential infection of a patient with two arboviruses within a relatively short period of time. In light of recent reports that mosquito co-infection with ZIKV and CHIKV allows simultaneous transmission without affecting vector competence [46], it is plausible that the two viruses were co-transmitted by the same mosquito. Given that these are among the earliest, if not the earliest, documented ZIKV infections in the hemisphere, the observation that they appeared together with epidemic CHIKV raises interesting questions about the possible role of CHIKV in the initiation of the ZIKV epidemic in the Americas.",

Nonetheless, our findings are consistent with the idea that there were multiple introductions of CHIKV into Haiti between 2013 and 2014, with identification of three distinct phylogenetic lineages, each clustering with strains from different parts of the Caribbean and/or South America. This was also the case for ZIKV: the ZIKV co-infecting strains did not cluster with the ZIKV strains previously obtained in Haiti in 2014 and 2016, consistent with multiple introductions or re-introductions of this arbovirus in Haiti between 2014 and 2016. Although for DENV-2 and MAYV the data are more limited, the tMRCAs for DENV-2 suggested that the introduction in Haiti happened between 2008 and 2014, a time interval again overlapping with the estimated introduction of both CHIKV and ZIKV co-infecting strains circulating in Haiti. Clustering of both the ZIKV and DENV-2 strains together with ZIKV and DENV-2 strains obtained in Florida in 2016 [38,47], as well as the multiple independent introductions of CHIKV, ZIKV, and MAYV to Haiti inferred from the phylogenies, demonstrate the potential role of the Caribbean as a node for arbovirus infections connecting South, Central, and North America.",

Letters next to arrows indicate ID of co-infected patients. Tips are colored by sampling location as indicated in the legends to the left of each tree; diamonds at each node indicate strong statistical support along branches defined as posterior probability > 0.9.
