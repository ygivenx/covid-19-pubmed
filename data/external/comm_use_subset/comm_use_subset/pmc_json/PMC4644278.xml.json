            "text": "Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality globally, especially in children <5 years of age, and the highest burden is observed in developing nations [1]. In 2000, approximately 2.2 million ARI-associated deaths occurred among children <5 years of age of which 70 % were in Africa and Southeast Asia [2]. Both bacteria and viruses have been identified as the etiological agents of ARI. The viruses most frequently detected in children with ARIs include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus (INF) types A and B, adenovirus (AV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and rhinovirus (RV) [3\u20135]; however, the clinical presentations of respiratory tract infections are similar, making it difficult to distinguish between etiologic agents without a laboratory diagnosis [6]. In addition, the interpretation of a viral detection is complicated by the fact that infections with multiple viruses are common in children with ARI and many viruses are frequently found in asymptomatic children [7]. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) are the most commonly isolated bacteria from ARI cases, while, other atypical pathogens such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae are less frequently reported [8\u201310]. S. pneumoniae and Hib are commonly identified in nasopharyngeal samples from asymptomatic children due to high rates of carriage; however, their identification from the nasopharynx is rarely indicative of invasive disease [11].",

Rhinovirus was the second most commonly detected virus (29 %) with similar rates among infants <1 year of age and children aged 1\u20134 years, which has been reported in previous studies [31, 32]. However, other studies reported RV as the most prevalent virus among children <5 years of age [16, 23, 28, 33]. In addition RV has been commonly detected among asymptomatic persons in several studies indicating that RV can act as both pathogen and by-stander, consequently hindering the ability to infer an association between detection and illness [34\u201336]. Among the PIV and CV detected in this study, PIV type 3 and CV type OC43 were the most common virus types, which has been reported in other studies [12, 16].",

Elevated colonization rates of these bacteria have been reported in children, but only a proportion of colonizations result in invasive disease [9, 11, 37]. The high detection rate of S. pneumoniae in our study is likely due to the fact that S. pneumoniae is a commensal of the nasopharynx [38]. It has been shown that the prevalence of S. pneumoniae carriage in healthy children <5 years of age ranges from 20 % to 93 % in low income countries [11]. The detection of S. pneumoniae from sterile sites like blood or cerebrospinal fluid, reflecting invasive pneumococcal disease, has been shown to be lower (5\u20139 %) [8, 39]. Nonetheless, S. pneumoniae has been reported to be responsible for 12 % of meningitis cases in Niger based on cerebrospinal fluid testing; 26 different serotypes were detected among cases of meningitis prior to the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in 2014 [40]. Hib and S. aureus, the 2nd and 3rd most prevalent bacterial pathogens in our study, have also been shown to be commensal organisms with high nasopharyngeal carriage rates especially in young children [11]. The substantial Hib nasopharyngeal colonization density found in this study should be investigated further as Hib vaccine has been available in the Niger expanded immunization program since 2008.",

            "text": "Our study has limitations that warrant discussion. First, the small sample size of our study hindered our ability to accurately assess the seasonality of the pathogens included in our study. Nonetheless, our results suggest that RSV, PIV and HMPV are more commonly detected during the hot season (October to December), while RV and HBV are detected more frequently during the rainy season (June to September). No difference in the detection rate of the other viruses and bacteria was noted across seasons in our study. The small sample size of our study also hindered our ability to detect patterns of co-detection and the association between specific viral and bacterial co-detections. Second, we did not keep formal records of the proportion of patients consenting to participate in the SARI surveillance. However, a review of the performance of the surveillance system implemented through hospital record review at sentinel sites revealed that only a few patients that met the study case definition were missed by the surveillance program. Third, the lack of controls in our study limited our ability to assess the association of pathogen detection with disease. While most of the viral and bacterial pathogens identified in this study have been described by previous studies as causative agents of ARI, the assignation of causality remains challenging [39, 43]. Fourth, influenza-positive samples were excluded from our study. Co-detection of other viral and bacterial pathogens with influenza is expected and this may have resulted in an underestimation of the prevalence of the pathogens included in this study, especially during the cold season when the majority of influenza-positive cases were detected. Last, we did not systematically collect information on progression of illness (including in-hospital outcome) or risk factors for severe disease, which hindered our ability to evaluate pathogen contribution to the more severe spectrum of illness or to identify groups at high risk for severe disease.",

The high prevalence of certain viral and bacterial pathogens highlights the need for expanded surveillance in Niger so as to inform policies and interventions. Given the high RSV detection rate observed in this study and the reported association of RSV detection with illness [30], RSV should be included in routine surveillance programs in Niger. Other selected pathogens could be considered for routine surveillance in the country following further assessment to determine association with illness. In addition, information on progression of illness, including in-hospital outcome and risk factors for severe disease should be collected routinely through the existing surveillance system.",
