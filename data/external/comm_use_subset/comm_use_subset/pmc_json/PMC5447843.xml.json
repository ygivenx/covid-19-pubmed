Demographic characteristics of cases and controls were compared using the \u03c72 test. All controls, both RTI and non-RTI, were included in the main analysis. All analyses of viral load were restricted to children positive for each virus. Among children positive for each virus, t tests adjusted for site and age were performed to compare mean cycle threshold (Ct) values between cases and controls. For each virus, a trend analysis, using simple linear regression, was performed to test if viral density increased with age for cases and for controls. Among cases only, mean Ct values were also compared by days since onset, severity, vital status, and HIV status. Multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for age and site, was performed to compare odds of being a case for each 3.4-unit drop in Ct value, which was approximately equivalent to a 1 log10 increase in viral copies/mL; Ct values instead of viral density were used for regression because viral density was only accurate within the linear range of the assay (104\u2013108 copies/mL). Kernel density distribution plots were created to show distributions of viral density by case/control status. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the corresponding area under the curve (AUC) were generated to investigate the performance of viral load in determining case status among children positive by NP/OP PCR for each virus, and the Youden index was calculated to determine the optimized diagnostic cutoffs to differentiate cases and controls [18]. To guard against bias in the estimates of sensitivity due to having a small number of some viruses detected among cases, the Youden index was calculated using leave-one-out cross-validation where sample size was sufficient [19]. Redefining positivity using the optimal cutpoints, we calculated odds ratios associated with case status for children above vs below the optimal cutpoint including negatives. The proportion of radiographically confirmed cases attributable to each virus [population attributable fraction: population prevalence \u00d7 (1 \u2013 1 / OR)] was calculated using 2 methods: (1) any positive vs negative and (2) positive above vs below the optimal cutpoint, the former method being optimal for laboratory sensitivity and the latter for a balance of epidemiological sensitivity and specificity. All analyses were performed using SAS software version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary North Carolina) and R Statistical Software 3.2.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).

Despite the low values for the AUC, when redefining positive for a virus as those with viral loads above the ROC optimal cutpoint value as determined by the Youden index, the odds ratio for predicting case status increased substantially for some viruses, approximately doubling for adenovirus, coronavirus 63, PIV2, and RSV (Table 4). Although the odds ratios increased, the population attributable fraction for most viruses did not change substantially, or even decreased (eg, influenza A, RSV) due to the lower frequency of cases with densities above the optimal cutpoint (Figure 3). This is because while the odds ratios are higher at the higher density cutoff, the prevalence of cases above the higher threshold was lower, and thus the proportion of PERCH cases assigned to the virus would not change appreciably by using the higher cutoff.",

Upper respiratory tract viral load might reflect the amount of replication in the local epithelial cells rather than the viral burden in the lung parenchyma.

Due to the high prevalence of viral infections of the URT itself, however, it is difficult to conclude that detection of a virus in the URT of a pneumonia patient is equivalent to having pneumonia due to that virus. In the PERCH study, the viral loads in the NP/OP of pneumonia patients are unlikely to further clarify the role of that virus in causing pneumonia. However, the PERCH study design was not optimal to answer this question definitively. Further research, such as longitudinal studies and animal models, is needed to better elucidate the interpretation of viral load in the diagnosis and clinical management of viral pneumonia.",
