All specimens were first run at SHCRC. One-milliliter aliquots of these specimens were later shipped on dry ice to either Duke-NUS or Duke University for validation. Laboratory staff at Duke-NUS and Duke were blind to the results of the assays at SHCRC. Cycle threshold (Ct) values <38 were considered positive, and Ct values 38 to 40 were considered suspect to acknowledge that positivity could be the result of cross-reactivity or nonspecific amplification. Cycle threshold values >40 were considered negative. All discrepant assays were noted and repeated at both SHCRC and either Duke or Duke-NUS, using the same original assays, and discrepancies were thus resolved. Partial genome sequencing was also performed for several specimens to validate discrepant results.",

The rainy season in this region typically falls between November and February, with December to March seeing the most rain. A drier season typically falls between May and September, with June to August seeing the least rain. Our findings show the peak IAV season falling during that period of the heaviest rains between January and March, with an adjusted odds ratio of 12.3 (95% CI, 2.6\u201358.4) of positive IAV detection between February 15 and March 14, 2018, compared with IAV detection in September 15\u2013October 15. Previous studies have investigated the relationship between relative humidity or absolute humidity and influenza virus transmission, suggesting that increased levels of humidity are linked with decreased transmission efficiency; however, the prevalence of IAV in Sibu and Kapit Hospitals suggest the high humidity associated with the equatorial climate in this region may not constrain IAV transmission [15, 16].",

Although we used rigorously validated real-time PCR assays as the gold standard for virus detection, the study was limited to a panel of 13 viruses and we therefore likely missed other important pathogens present in specimens, including human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, and bacteria.
