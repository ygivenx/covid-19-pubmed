            "text": "Zika virus (ZIKV) was first isolated in monkeys in Uganda in 1947, and then detected in Aedes africanus mosquitoes in 1948. ZIKV belongs to a mosquito-borne flavivirus of the family Flavivirus, which spread from Africa to south-eastern Asia through transmission by Aedes mosquitoes, such as A. albopictus, A. Aegypti, and A. Polynesiensis. ZIKV exhibits genetic variation that is classified into African and Asian lineages [1]. ZIKV infection causes self-limiting, mild illnesses, such as low-grade fever, headaches, rash, myalgia, arthralgia, and conjunctivitis; fewer than 20 human ZIKV cases were reported from the 1960s to 1980s [2]. Recently, the ZIKV Asian-lineage strains spread from south-east Asia toward the Pacific, leading to three large outbreaks on Yap island (Micronesia) in 2007, French Polynesia in 2013\u20132014, in Brazil in 2015\u20132016, and then across the Americas in 2016 [3]. The epidemic ZIKV Asian strains evolved into highly virulent and neurotropic variants, resulting in a dramatic increase in cases of congenital, ZIKV-associated microcephaly in newborns and Guillain\u2013Barre syndrome (GBS) in adults during these three outbreaks [3]. The epidemic ZIKV Asian strains have also been transmitted via vertical, sexual, and blood transfusion routes [4]. Therefore, the WHO Emergency Committee announced that ZIKV is considered a \u201cPublic Health Emergency of International Concern\u201d (PHEIC) in November 2016 [5]. Nowadays, the epidemic ZIKV Asian strains have broadened worldwide; laboratory-confirmed symptomatic ZIKV cases are still reported [6]. ZIKV\u2019s emergence has become an extraordinary and enduring challenge to public health; thus, there is a great need to understand the features of the epidemic ZIKV Asian strains.",

            "text": "ZIKV, like other flaviviruses, such as Dengue virus, Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and West Nile virus, possesses a single-strand, positive-sense RNA genome in a small, enveloped virion [7]. The flavivirus genome, nearly 11 kb in length, encodes a large open reading frame (ORF) flanked by two noncoding regions at the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019-ends, which translates into a large polyprotein that is divided into three structural proteins (capsid (C), membrane (prM/M), and envelope (E)) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) through the proteolytic process of the viral proteases (NS2B\u2013NS3) and host cell proteases. E protein is the surface protein for receptor binding and cell membrane fusion. NS3 is a multidomain protein with an N-terminal protease (NS3pro), C-terminal RNA triphosphatase (NS3 RTPase), and helicase (NS3hel). NS5 consists of an N-terminal methyltransferase (NS5 MTase) and C-terminal RNA polymerase (NS5RdRp). Phylogenetic analysis of ZIKV African and Asian-lineage strains isolated from 1947 to 2017 indicates that some mutations accumulated in the epidemic ZIKV Asian strains in 2015\u20132016 [8,9]. Epidemic ZIKV Asian strains contain 75 amino acid substitutions compared with their African lineage strains, five of which are located in C, nine in prM, 10 in E, four in NS1, five in NS2A, two in NS2B, nine in NS3, one in NS4A, nine in NS4B, and 21 in NS5 [8,9]. The serine-to-asparagine substitution (Ser139\u2192Asn139 (S139N0) in prM increases ZIKV infectivity in neural progenitor cells and the severity of fetal microcephaly in a mouse model [10]. The alanine-to-valine substitution (A984\u2192V984 [A984V]) in NS1 induces the inhibition of interferon-\u03b2 production and leads to viral immune escape [11]. In addition, comparison between pre-epidemic and epidemic ZIKV Asian strains indicated 24 amino acid substitutions within prM (2), E (3), NS2A (1), NS3 (3), NS4B (7), and NS5 (8), such as T773M in E, Y2082H in NS3, L2451S in NS4B, and T2630V in NS5 [8,9]. The mutations in epidemic ZIKV Asian strains in comparison with pre-epidemic Asian and African strains might be determinants for their unique features; considering the increase in virulence and persistent infection, these mutations are worth understandingly thoroughly.",

            "text": "Reverse genetics is an effective tool for preparing replicons and infectious clones of flaviviruses, in order to study their mechanisms of viral replication and pathogenesis and to identify potential antiviral compounds [12,13]. The full-length, infectious cDNA clones of flaviviruses under cytomegalovirus\u2019s (CMV\u2019s) promoter-driven transcription have been widely used to generate infectious particles in vitro. However, full-length flavivirus cDNA clones are highly toxic to Escherichia coli, which causes instability of flavivirus cDNAs and increases the difficulty of constructing flavivirus cDNA clones [14]. DNA-launched replicons of dengue virus, West Nile virus, and JEV contain the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019-noncoding regions, partial C gene, and the complete gene fragment of all non-structural proteins under the control of the CMV promoter [12]. CMV promoter-driven viral RNA subgenomes enable self-replication in transfected cells with DNA-launched replicons, but they possess no infectious particle production due to lacking the coding region of structural proteins. The approach using two plasmids with the structural genes (C, prM, and E) and the remaining genome as the replicon has been established to produce single-round infectious particles (SRIPs). The packaging cells carrying the recombinant plasmid encoding the viral structural proteins are transfected with DNA-launched replicons and then self-replicate viral subgenomes and express all viral proteins, allowing viral assembly and release as SRIPs. Several flavivirus, replicon-based SRIPs, including JEV, dengue virus, West Nile virus, and tick-borne encephalitis virus have been generated and demonstrated as safer vaccine candidates [15,16,17]. Subsequently, replicon-based SRIPs are suitable systems for investigating the mechanism of the ZIKV life cycle, ZIKV-host interaction, and virulence.",

The construction of synthesized DNA fragments, plasmid information, and restriction enzyme digestion analysis of the DNA fragments we purchased are shown in Supplementary Figures S1 and S2 and Figure 1A. To construct the ZIKV Natal RGN replicon, the plasmid pBR322-Linker, described in our prior report [15], was chosen as the vector to assemble fragments A, B, C, and D of the CMVp-driven ZIKV Natal RGN replicon with the EGFP reporter via the cloning sites of EcoRI, NotI, ClaI, RsrII, and XhoI (Figure 1B). Fragments A, C, and D were generated using the Platinum\u00ae PCR Supermix High Fidelity reaction with the DNA segments we synthesized, I and II, as the templates (Life Technology, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Fragment B was produced through two-round PCR with the Gibson Assembly reaction of two first-round PCR products (B1 and B2) as the template (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). The pairs containing the restriction enzyme site(s) indicated, are listed in Supplementary Table S1. The resultant plasmid carrying the CMVp-driven ZIKV Natal RGN replicon with the EGFP reporter was propagated in E. coli DH5\u03b1 and then sequenced by Sanger sequencing assays with sequencing primers (Supplementary Table S2). The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence alignment analysis of the CMVp-driven ZIKV Natal RGN replicon and its parent strain (GenBank accession number KU527068) was performed using the Lasergene DNASTAR Megalign software.",

Two synthetic DNA segments in the pUC18 plasmids comprised the entire ZIKV Natal RGN strain genome\uff0c CMVp, EGFP, FMDV-2A, and BGH-pA sequences (Supplementary Figures S1 and S2 and Figure 1A,B). The synthetic DNA segments were used as templates via PCR to amplify the gene fragments (A\u2013D) that were cloned into the low-copy-number plasmid pBR322 to construct a DNA-launched ZIKV Natal RGN replicon under the control of the CMV promoter (Figure 1B,C). Fragment A consisted of CMVp, ZIKV 5\u2019-UTR, ZIKV C protein, the reporter EGFP, and FMDV-2A. Fragment B containing the 73-residue C-terminal region of ZIKV E protein, NS1, NS2A, NS2B, and the N-terminal region of NS3, was produced using Gibson Assembly cloning (Figure 1C). In order to join fragments B and C, the reverse primer for fragment B and the forward primer for fragment C contained the restriction enzyme site ClaI (Supplementary Table S1), which is recognized as the marker nt5156ATCGAT5161 of the replicon in which thymidine at nucleotide 5156 of the ZIKV Natal RGN genome was exchanged with adenosine, but it caused a silent mutation (Figure 1B). Interestingly, the RsrII restriction site within the NS4B gene (nt7473CGGACCG7479) of the ZIKV Natal RGN genome was a unique restriction site for ligation between fragments C and D. In addition, HDVr was fused with the 3\u2019-UTR of ZIKV in the replicon to verify the accuracy of the 3\u2019-end of the transcribed ZIKV Natal RGN RNA genomes (Figure 1B,C). Furthermore, sequencing analysis of the ZIKV Natal RGN replicon indicated that only two amino acid substitutions appeared within the NS5 protein (L3277R and E3280N) (Supplementary Figure S3). Therefore, the DNA-launched ZIKV Natal RGN replicon was effectively constructed to generate the in-frame fusion of ZIKV C protein, reporter EGFP, FMDV-2A, the 73-residue C-terminal region of ZIKV E protein, and all non-structural ZIKV proteins under the control of the CMV promoter.",

ZIKV Natal RGN SRIPs at a MOI of 0.15 TCID50/cell induced more observable and higher CPE levels in TE-671 cells than those in ARPE-19 and SF268 cells (Figure 6A top). The CPE level induced by ZIKV Natal RGN SRIPs correlated with the fluorescence intensity of the EGFP reporter encoded within the SRIP genome in the following order: TE-671 > ARPE-19 > SF268 cells infected with ZIKV Natal RGN SRIPs (Figure 6A middle). In addition, immunofluorescent staining with anti-ZIKV NS1 antibodies indicated that ZIKV NS1 protein was expressed in these three ZIKV Natal RGN SRIP-infected cell lines, in which the fluorescence intensity of the NS1 protein was consistent with the CPE level induced by ZIKV Natal RGN SRIPs (Figure 6A bottom). Meanwhile, 105 TCID50 of the SRIPs per well was added onto the monolayer of these three cell lines to examine the attachment activity of ZIKV Natal RGN SRIPs (Figure 6B). Interestingly, the SRIPs showed the highest level of attachment activity to TE671 cells, in which the highest viral genome number was discovered 1 h after attachment at 4 \u00b0C. However, the SRIPs showed the lowest level of attachment activity to SF268 cells. Compared to ARPE-19 and SF268 cells, it was found that TE671 cells exhibited the highest susceptibility to ZIKV Natal RGN SRIPs and allowed the highest number of SRIPs to attach to the surface.",

            "text": "The ZIKV Natal RGN strain found in brain tissues from fetal autopsy cases with microcephaly in the Natal region of Brazil has not been isolated [18]. This study, firstly, generated SRIPs of the ZIKV Natal RGN strain using synthetic and reverse genetic technologies (Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4 and Supplementary Figures S1\u2013S3). The viral yield of ZIKV Natal RGN SRIPs in prM-E-expressing packaging cells transfected with the ZIKV replicon was 6.25 \u00d7 106 TCID50/mL (Figure 4), which indicated the replication capacity of the CMV promoter-launched ZIKV Natal RGN replicon. In addition, a green fluorescence reporter, EGFP, encoded within the ZIKV Natal RGN replicon, represented an observable marker to examine replication of the ZIKV Natal RGN replicon and SRIPs (Figure 2, Figure 3, and Figure 5). In our laboratory, the pBR322 plasmid has been used to construct a JEV replicon that is genetically stable in E. coli [15]. The JEV genome sequence encoding for structural proteins (C, prM/M, and E) was toxic in E. coli, which resulted in genetic instability of the JEV infectious clones and replicons [15]. Similarly, construction of ZIKV Natal RGN infectious clones was not accomplished due to the genetic instability of ZIKV Natal RGN infectious clones, particularly within the NS1 gene region (Supplementary Figures S1 and S2). However, the recombinant pcDNA3.1 plasmid containing prM and E genes and the pBR322 plasmid containing 5\u2019 and 3\u2019-UTRs, C, and all NS genes, showed genetic stability. Two ZIKV infectious clones obtained by cloning the entire full-length native cDNA have been reported [20,21], and other ZIKV infectious clones were reported using strategies to avoid the toxicity of the ZIKV genome sequence, including in vitro assembly of viral cDNA fragments and insertion of eukaryotic introns [22,23,24,25,26,27]. Particularly, the ZIKV Natal RGN infectious clone was produced using bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) [27], in which a single-copy pBeloBAC11 plasmid containing the full-length genome of the ZIKV Natal RGN strain under the CMV promoter control was used to maintain ZIKV genome stability and reduce toxicity in bacteria. In addition, our prior report demonstrated that JEV SRIPs carrying the EGFP reporter were a more sensitive, effective, and efficient platform for quantitating antiviral efficacy using flow cytometry compared to the traditional plaque assay [15]. Like JEV SRIPs, the ZIKV Natal RGN SRIPs carrying the EGFP reporter could be applicable as a drug screening platform. Therefore, the reverse genetics system for the production of ZIKV Natal RGN SRIPs provided an alternative, applicable, and rapid approach to studying the biological features of the unique ZIKV strains.",

Interestingly, TE671 cells expressing JEV C, prM, and E proteins were also used as a packaging cell line that was efficient at producing JEV SRIPs post-transfection with the JEV replicon [15]. The recombinant ZIKV Natal RGN SRIPs showed infectivity and self-replication in the packaging cells (Figure 5). Two amino acid substitutions within NS5 (L3277R and E3280N) (Supplementary Figure S3) seemed to have no influence on the activities of NS5 methyltransferase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. A recent study indicated that human embryonic kidney 293T cells had been used to establish different flavivirus prM-E-expressing packaging cells, including DENV1\u20134, ZIKV, JEV, West Nile virus, yellow fever virus, and tick-borne encephalitis virus, and the cells were transfected with the DENV1 reporter replicon to generate a chimeric flavivirus SRIP-based neutralization assay [28].

In this study, recombinant ZIKV Natal RGN SRIPs were rescued using reverse genetic and synthetic biology techniques (Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5 and Supplementary Figures S1\u2013S3). Three cell lines, TE671, SF268, and ARPE-19, were further tested for cell susceptibility to ZIKV Natal RGN SRIPs (Figure 6). The order of cell susceptibility to ZIKV Natal RGN SRIPs was TE671 > ARPE-19 > SF268 cells. The CPE level, EGFP reporter intensity, and ZIKV NS1 protein expression were most obvious (>50% involvement) in TE671 cells, but were mild in ARPE-19 cells and limited in SF268 cells 72 h post-infection with SRIPs at an MOI of 0.15 TCID50/cell. The results indicated that ZIKV Natal RGN SRIPs had a broad range of human tissue tropism with differential cell susceptibilities (Figure 6A). In addition, ZIKV Natal RGN SRIPs had the highest attachment activity to TE671 cells among those three cell lines (Figure 6B). SRIP attachment to TE671 cells was suggested to be involved in the infectivity of ZIKV Natal RGN in TE671 cells. This finding implied that ZIKV Natal RGN SRIPs had tropism for rhabdomyosarcoma/muscle and retinal pigmented epithelial cells, which was consistent with myalgia, arthralgia, retinitis, chorioretinal atrophy, and pigmentary maculopathy in symptomatic ZIKV infection [29,30]. Therefore, the cell line susceptibility results revealed the unique features of ZIKV Natal RGN SRIPs and suggested the possible pathogenesis of ZIKV infection.",

ZIKV Natal RGN SRIPs were rescued by the combination of prM-E-expressing packaging cells and the ZIKV Natal RGN replicon under CMV promoter control, which mimicked self-replicating, positive-sense, single strand RNA viruses. The biological features of ZIKV Natal RGN SRIPs were revealed, including CPE, infectivity, cell susceptibility, and attachment activity. Therefore, recombinant ZIKV Natal RGN SRIPs could be further used to investigate cell tropism, persistent infection, and vaccine candidates, and to establish reliable, effective, and efficient assays for screening antiviral agents and diagnosing viral infections.",
