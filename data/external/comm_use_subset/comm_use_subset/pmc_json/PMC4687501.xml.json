These items included gloves, gowns, masks, hand sanitizer, and bleach wipes. The cost of diagnostic testing was provided by the laboratories contracted by the pLTCF. The vendors and item costs did not change during the study period. The costs of antibiotics and oseltamivir were calculated based on the lowest and most conservative estimate of the average wholesale price listed in the 2010 Red Book Drug Reference.10 Antibiotic and oseltamivir prices were standardized and inflation adjusted to 2013 using the Consumer Price Index (http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm). A pediatric infectious disease consultant is employed by the pLTCF on an hourly basis to assist with the management of healthcare\u2010associated infections. This physician's hourly wages during the respiratory and non\u2010respiratory viral seasons were estimated from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Employment and Wages from May 2013 for pediatricians in New York State.11\n",

Sixty\u2010three infections had diagnostic testing that was negative and 87 infections were clinically diagnosed only. The costs associated with the respiratory viral season and the non\u2010respiratory viral season are summarized in the Table 1. The respiratory viral season was significantly more expensive than the non\u2010respiratory viral season (total costs: $31 224 and $3242 respectively, P < 0\u00b7001).",

The vast majority of the cost burden, nearly 98%, was due to influenza prophylaxis. Our facility prophylactically treats all residents with oseltamivir at the onset of any confirmed case of influenza. During our study period, there were only three cases of influenza. However, this translated into all 137 residents receiving prophylaxis three times, thus resulting in high costs. The added costs of the other infection prevention and control activities we measured including diagnostic testing, physician consulting, and product usage, $644 per 1000 resident\u2010days, were similar to that reported in the pediatric acute care setting during RSV seasons ($760 per 1000 patient\u2010days).6 Surprisingly, the costs related to hand hygiene were greater during the non\u2010respiratory viral season as compared to the viral respiratory season. This may be due to an increase in gastrointestinal disease during the summer months (data not shown). While the cost effectiveness of oseltamivir has not been specifically evaluated in pLTCF, studies in the adult long\u2010term care setting have demonstrated that influenza prophylaxis results in cost savings to facilities overall.12\n",

During outbreaks of ARI, for example, the facility's school is closed to prevent the transmission of infection. This results not only in a financial loss of state funding for days of closure, but also a psychosocial cost for the residents. Additional costs not accounted for include staff absenteeism and overtime, as well as psychosocial costs for the roommates of residents who have an ARI, as all residents within the affected room would be on contact/droplet isolation precautions. Costs of hospitalizations were also not included, as this study examined the costs for the facility only. Transfers to acute care would further increase the costs associated with ARI. For this analysis, the study period was limited to one year, which may not be fully representative of other years or sites.",

Notably, the vast majority of the cost burden, $27 338 for facility\u2010wide influenza prophylaxis, can be avoided if no cases of influenza are introduced into the facility. Thus, further research should investigate ways to limit ARI transmission, specifically influenza, in this unique population and setting through measures such as improved hand hygiene and environmental cleaning, increased vaccination rates for facility staff and visitors, and use of masks during peak respiratory illness seasons.",
