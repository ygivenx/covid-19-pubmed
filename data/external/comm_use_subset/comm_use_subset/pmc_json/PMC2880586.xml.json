            "text": "Dendritic cells (DCs), a highly specialized subset of professional antigen-presenting cells, play a central role in the initiation of innate and adaptive immunity. There are two known major subsets of primary human and murine circulating DCs: myeloid DCs, which function principally in antigen presentation, and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), which secrete the type I interferons (IFN), IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2 [1], as well as a variety of other cytokines and chemokines. Viral induction of type I IFN expression has been well studied in recent years and has been shown to be mediated by multiple pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG)-I, melanoma differentiation-associated gene (MDA)5, toll-like receptor (TLR)3, TLR7 and TLR9. PRR expression is restricted in pDCs, with only TLR7 and TLR9 implicated in viral-induced IFN\u03b1 production through the recognition of single-stranded (ss)RNA or DNA, respectively [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. IFN\u03b1 production by pDCs is also observed following TLR7/8 stimulus with synthetic resiquimods and imiquimods, or TLR9 antagonism by CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN). pDCs are not generally thought to be able to respond to double-stranded (ds)RNA, as stimulation with poly I:C or long (500 base pairs) dsRNA molecules fail to elicit IFN\u03b1 or upregulate activation or maturation markers, such as CD86 and CD83 [10], [11], [12]. However, low levels of IFN\u03b1 production have been reported following pDC stimulation with poly A:U [13] or in vitro transcribed viral dsRNA [11], and a recent report indicates a role for RIG-I-like helicases in recognizing replicating virus in murine pDCs lacking the IFN receptor [14]. Short interfering dsRNAs have also been demonstrated to elicit an IFN\u03b1 response through TLR7, although this appears dependent on a specific sequence, and not on the dsRNA structure [12].",

The outer layer of the virion is composed of the VP7 glycoprotein and protease-sensitive VP4 spikes [31]. Although both triple- and double-layered particles (TLPs and DLPs, respectively) are generated during rotavirus replication, only TLPs are infectious, due to the requirements of VP4 and VP7 for cell binding, and trypsin cleavage of VP4 for viral entry and infectivity [32], [33], [34], [35], [36]. Formation of noninfectious empty TLPs and DLPs, which lack the viral genome, is also observed during infection. The nonstructural proteins (NSP1 through 5) are involved in viral replication, morphogenesis and assembly, but they are not expressed by nonreplicating virus and are not part of the infectious virion [31].",

            "text": "Rotavirus-induced immune responses, especially the T and B cell responses, have been extensively characterized; however, little is known about innate immune mechanisms required to control rotavirus infection. Rotavirus structural and nonstructural proteins have been detected in primary DCs from murine mesenteric lymph nodes and spleens [37], [38], and murine bone marrow-derived DCs have been shown to secrete type I IFN and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u03b1 following rhesus (RRV) or bovine rotavirus (RF-81) challenge, respectively [39], [40]. Mature human monocyte-derived myeloid DCs (moDCs) have been demonstrated to be more susceptible to rotavirus infection than immature moDCs, although infection did not result in substantial cell death [41]. Additionally, infection did not induce moDC maturation, but instead promoted priming of Th1 cells [41]. A recent study of total human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) exposed to RRV or human rotavirus indicated that both myeloid DCs and pDCs are susceptible to infection, and that infection results in the secretion of IFN\u03b1, presumably from pDCs [42]. While increased levels of IFN\u03b1 have also been correlated with a positive clinical outcome in infected children [43], [44], several rotaviruses, including RRV, have recently been demonstrated to antagonize the production of type I IFN through the degradation of interferon regulatory factors (IRF)3, IRF5, and IRF7, and the inhibition of NF\u03baB activation, by a viral nonstructural protein, NSP1 [45], [46], [47], [48].",

We demonstrate that although rotavirus initiates detectable transcription and translation in only a small percentage of pDCs, a significant percentage of pDCs activate and mature following exposure to virus. Importantly, we demonstrate that stimulation of pDCs with live or inactivated RRV effects secretion of IFN\u03b1 and multiple proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. This response is dependent on the presence of the viral dsRNA genome. As IFN\u03b1 production by pDCs is classically triggered in response to ssRNA or DNA, the induction of this response by a replication-incompetent dsRNA virus indicates a potentially novel mechanism of viral sensing by pDCs.",

Expression of NSP2, a viral nonstructural protein expressed only in cells in which rotavirus replicates, was detected by intracellular flow cytometry at 6 and 12 hours post infection (hpi). As illustrated in Figure 1, NSP2 was not detected in pDCs receiving MA104 supernatant (mock-treated; Figure 1A) or iRRV (data not shown), but was expressed in a small but significant percentage (mean \u00b1 SEM, moi 5: 1.18%\u00b10.23 6hpi, 1.43%\u00b10.28 12hpi; moi 10: 1.45%\u00b10.25 6hpi, 3.02%\u00b10.99 12hpi) of pDCs inoculated with live RRV (Figure 1B and 1D). Additionally, NSP2 was detected only after pDCs were permeabilized (data not shown). Two populations of NSP2+ cells, NSP2dim and NSP2bright, were frequently apparent in pDCs exposed to live RRV (Figure 1B and 1C); approximately 20% of donors had only a single NSP2dim population. While the total percent of pDCs expressing NSP2 following RRV challenge increased from 6 to 12hpi, this increase was not significant (moi 5: p = 0.77; moi 10: p = 0.30; Mann-Whitney) (Figure 1D). The percent of NSP2+ pDCs also increased with moi (6hpi: p = 0.26; 12hpi: p = 0.063; Mann-Whitney), but remained a minor proportion of the total pDC population (median: 2.01%, moi 10, 12hpi) (Figure 1D). Further increasing the moi to 25 or 100 modestly increased the NSP2+ population, but it remained relatively small (mean: 4.99%, median: 2.07%, moi 100, n = 4, data not shown). pDCs from multiple donors (n = 5, mean purity: 91.51%) were titered after overnight culture to determine whether rotavirus infection was productive. A significant increase in viral titer (approximately 20-fold, p\u22640.03; Wilcoxon signed rank test) (data not shown) was observed in two of these donors, while the other three showed no significant change over time (p\u22650.17; Wilcoxon signed rank test) (data not shown). While pDC viability was significantly decreased from 6 to 12hpi in cultures receiving mock, RRV (moi 5) or iRRV stimulus (p\u22640.004; Mann-Whitney), viral exposure did not result in significant cell death compared to mock stimulus at a given time point (p>0.063; Wilcoxon signed rank test) (Figure 1E). The low frequency of NSP2+ pDCs shows that the majority of human pDCs are resistant to RRV replication, as defined by evidence of expression of a non-structural rotavirus protein.",

Stimulation with CpG ODN 2395 resulted in activation of a significantly greater percentage of the pDC population than that observed in pDCs exposed to RRV (p = 0.03; Wilcoxon signed rank test). The percent of pDCs matured by CpG ODN 2395 stimulus was also increased, but not significantly compared to those exposed to RRV (p = 0.094; Wilcoxon signed rank test). Viral replication did not inhibit maturation or activation, as pDCs positive for NSP2 expressed CD86 and CD83 at a significantly higher frequency (p\u22640.008; Wilcoxon signed rank test) than bystander pDCs (Figure 2E-H). Expression of both molecules was significantly increased in both populations compared to pDCs receiving mock stimulus.

To assess this component of the pDC anti-rotaviral response, the frequency of cells expressing IFN\u03b1 was determined by flow cytometry. Intracellular IFN\u03b1 was detected within 4hpi of RRV stimulus, peaked at 6hpi and was sustained until at least 12hpi (Figure 3A and 3B). IFN\u03b1 was detected intracellularly at similar frequencies in pDCs exposed to iRRV (which was both infectivity and transcriptionally negative) (p = 0.815; Mann-Whitney) (Figure 3A and data not shown), suggesting that replication or transcription of rotavirus is largely dispensable for IFN\u03b1 induction in human pDCs. Intracellular IFN\u03b1 was abrogated by the addition of RRV neutralizing VP7 or VP4 monoclonal antibodies (either mAb 159 or 2G4), indicating that the observed induction was virus-specific and likely dependent on an event occurring after virus binding and entry (Figure 3C) [49]. To identify and quantify IFN\u03b1 secretion, and to detect other cytokines and chemokines secreted in response to RRV exposure, Luminex assays or ELISAs were performed on supernatants collected from inoculated pDCs at various times post infection. Only supernatants from pDC cultures \u226585% pure (mean: 90.84%\u00b10.75; n = 3\u201318) were analyzed to minimize the contribution of contaminating cells to the cytokine milieu. A significant IFN\u03b1 response, approaching 10,000 pg IFN\u03b1/ml, was detectable 6h following exposure to live or inactivated RRV (Figure 4A). In addition, significant quantities of IFN\u03b2, TNF\u03b1, interleukin (IL)6, IL8, CXCL10 (IP10), CCL3 (MIP1\u03b1), CCL4 (MIP1\u03b2), CCL5 (RANTES) and TNF\u03b2 were detected at various times post infection (Figure 4B-I and data not shown).

NSP2- bystander pDCs produced IFN\u03b1 at a significantly increased frequency (p<0.0001; Wilcoxon signed rank test) compared to pDCs dim or bright for NSP2 (Figure 5A and 5B). The percent of IFN\u03b1+ pDCs was significantly increased in the NSP2dim population compared to that in the NSP2bright (p = 0.0006; Wilcoxon signed rank test), supporting the hypothesis that increased levels of RRV infection are inversely correlated with IFN\u03b1 production. More significant was the sustained production of IFN\u03b1 in uninfected (NSP2-) pDCs following RRV stimulus. A similar correlation between NSP2 expression and IFN\u03b2 production was also observed (Figure 5C). These data indicate that infection in a minor subset of pDCs results in the local suppression of the IFN\u03b1 response in these specific cells.",

            "text": "To further investigate the impairment of the IFN\u03b1 response in pDCs undergoing rotavirus replication, phosphorylation of IRF7, the key transcription factor for the IFN\u03b1 response in pDCs [50], was assessed by phosflow (Figure 5D and 5E). In accordance with the decreased production of IFN\u03b1 by NSP2bright cells compared to that of NSP2dim pDCs, as well as previous findings of IRF7 degradation in rotavirus-infected cells [45], [46], phosphorylated IRF7 (pIRF7) was substantially decreased in pDCs bright for NSP2 (p = 0.03 versus NSP2dim pDCs; Wilcoxon signed rank test) (Figure 5D and 5E), and is similar to that of IFN\u03b1-NSP2- pDCs (p = 0.56; Wilcoxon signed rank test) (Figure 5E). To determine whether this decrease in pIRF7 was due to decreased levels of total IRF7 in pDCs, the MFI of total IRF7 was assessed (Figure 5F). While the total IRF7 MFI was slightly depressed in NSP2bright compared to NSP2dim pDCs, this decrease was not significant (p = 0.44; Wilcoxon signed rank test) and thus does not account for the observed differences in IRF7 phosphorylation. The increased levels of pIRF7 in NSP2dim pDCs may represent continual, direct stimulus of the IRF7 pathway in virus-positive pDCs, as well as a mechanism by which the IFN\u03b1 response is directly initiated. Alternately, pIRF7 may be sequestered in a nontraditional cellular compartment prior to degradation, leading to increased protein accumulation. Interestingly, levels of IRF7 phosphorylation in IFN\u03b1+NSP2- pDCs were intermediate to that of NSP2dim (p = 0.31; Wilcoxon signed rank test) and NSP2bright or NSP2-IFN\u03b1- pDCs (p = 0.0313; Wilcoxon signed rank test) (Figure 5E). The slight depression of pIRF7 in the IFN\u03b1+ population compared to that observed in NSP2dim pDCs may be attributable to the enhanced IFN\u03b1 production in this subpopulation. As pIRF7 is degraded following the initiation of IFN\u03b1 transcription, cells in which IFN\u03b1 has been transcribed would be expected to have lower levels of pIRF7 than those negative for IFN\u03b1. Notably, inhibition of IFN\u03b1 secretion, achieved by simultaneous addition of brefeldin A with viral inoculation, decreased the percent of IFN\u03b1+ pDCs by an average of 63.5% (n = 6, data not shown). This supports the notion that recognition of secreted IFN\u03b1 is an essential component of the IFN\u03b1 response following rotavirus exposure, as has been reported with Newcastle disease virus [14]. Importantly, this is the first demonstration of impaired IRF phosphorylation in primary human cells infected with rotavirus.",

To investigate the role of trypsin-mediated cleavage of VP4 in both rotavirus infection of, and IFN\u03b1 production by, human pDCs, we exposed pDCs to RRV grown in the absence of trypsin (non-trypsinized; NT-RRV). Although subsequent exposure to trypsin (thus cleaving VP4) increased infectivity of the uncleaved NT-RRV preparation 63-fold by plaque titration and intracellular NSP2 staining by 20-fold in MA104s (data not shown), examination of NSP2 staining showed that similar proportions of pDCs were infected with either the cleaved or uncleaved NT-RRV preparations (p = 0.625; Wilcoxon signed rank test) (Figure 6A-C). Likewise, uncleaved NT-RRV induced IFN\u03b1 production by a similar (p = 0.375; Wilcoxon signed rank test) percentage of pDCs, compared to cleaved NT-RRV (Figure 6A, 6B and 6D). Thus, cleavage of VP4 by trypsin is dispensable for both pDC infection and IFN\u03b1 induction by RRV.",

As rotavirus is a dsRNA virus and since psoralen-treated, transcriptionally-inactive rotavirus efficiently induced IFN\u03b1 (Figures 3 and 4A), we investigated the viral requirements for IFN\u03b1 induction. pDCs stimulated with equal quantities (see Methods describing particle quantification) of purified TLPs, DLPs, empty particles, or genome-free recombinant virus-like particles (VLPs) were stained for intracellular IFN\u03b1. As expected, density gradient purified RRV TLPs stimulated similar levels (p = 0.695; Wilcoxon signed rank test; n = 10) of IFN\u03b1 production compared to pDCs treated with unpurified live or inactivated RRV expressing equivalent amounts of VP4, as measured by hemagglutination titer (Figure 7). pDCs exposed to 2/6 genome-containing RRV DLPs expressed neither IFN\u03b1 nor NSP2, indicating a likely dependence on VP4 or VP7 for viral entry, as previously reported [32]. Alternately, one or both of these viral proteins could be serving as the pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) responsible for inducing the pDC IFN\u03b1 response. To address this, pDCs were stimulated with 2/4/6/7 VLPs or 2/6/7 green fluorescent protein (GFP)-VLPs. Both 2/6/7 GFP-VLPs and 2/4/6/7 VLPs were capable of entering pDCs, but failed to induce IFN\u03b1 (Figure 7 and data not shown). 2/6 VLPs were comparatively defective in the ability to enter pDCs (data not shown), thus supporting the hypothesis that DLPs fail to induce IFN\u03b1 due to inefficient viral entry. The ability of infectious SA11, the parental virus from which the 2/4/6/7 VLPs were derived, to induce IFN\u03b1 production (Figure 7) suggests that the lack of IFN\u03b1 following inoculation with 2/4/6/7 VLPs was due to the absence of a viral genome, and not to strain variation in surface proteins. Consistent with this hypothesis, IFN\u03b1 was detected in very few pDCs exposed to empty TLPs, as compared to pDCs exposed to equal quantities of genome-containing TLPs. Instead, IFN\u03b1 production by pDCs exposed to empty particles was consistent with that observed in pDCs inoculated with an equal infectious dose of TLPs, suggesting that residual contaminating viral genome was responsible for IFN\u03b1 production by the empty TLPs. Together, these data indicate that viral entry, mediated by VP4 and/or VP7, and the viral dsRNA genome are likely required for rotavirus-induced IFN\u03b1 production by pDCs.",

Subsequent examination of intracellular IFN\u03b1 production revealed significant inhibition in concanamycin-treated pDCs compared to untreated cells (mean \u00b1 SEM, RRV: 83.3%\u00b14.6; iRRV: 83.2%\u00b14.5; p = 0.01; Mann-Whitney). To determine whether the observed lack of IFN\u03b1 production was due to a defect in viral entry, concanamycin-treated pDCs were examined for NSP2 expression. Interestingly, NSP2 expression was significantly increased in concanamycin-treated pDCs compared to untreated cells (Figure 8D and 8E) (mean fold increase: 5.9; p = 0.03; Wilcoxon signed rank test; n = 6). These data indicate that concanamycin-induced inhibition of endosomal acidification does not inhibit viral infection of pDCs and hence, presumably, does not restrict viral entry. These data support the conclusion that concanamycin A treatment prevents the pDC IFN\u03b1 response at the level of ligand recognition, implicating TLR7 or TLR9. Additionally, the data suggest that the observed low levels of viral replication in pDCs (Figure 1D) are due, at least in part, to suppression by the pDC IFN response, as NSP2 expression significantly increases following IFN\u03b1 inhibition (Figure 8C and 8D). Notably, these experiments demonstrate that endosomal acidification is required for the pDC IFN\u03b1 response to rotavirus, and provide indirect evidence for the involvement of an endosomal receptor, such as TLR7 or TLR9, in the induction of this response.",

Traditional receptors for dsRNA, such as RIG-I, MDA5 and TLR3, are largely thought to not play a role in the initiation of the IFN response in human pDCs [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. Although Newcastle disease virus normally elicits an IFN\u03b1 response in murine pDCs through triggering TLR7, RIG-I-like helicases have been recently implicated in IFN\u03b1 induction by replicating virus in murine pDCs lacking the IFN receptor [14]. Hence, the mechanisms governing efficient IFN\u03b1 induction in these cells by transcriptionally inactivated, replication-incompetent dsRNA rotavirus are not yet understood. As rotaviruses represent a large burden of human disease, it will be important to better understand the immune mechanisms underlying their recognition and subsequent generation of antiviral immunity.",

While productive infection was observed in a subset of donors, this was significantly less than that observed in cells highly permissive for rotavirus infection [53]. As rotavirus is generally a lytic virus [31], [54], [55], the observed lack of significant death in pDC preparations exposed to live RRV, compared to those receiving mock stimulus or inactivated virus, further indicates that few pDCs are permissive to viral replication. These findings are in agreement with previous reports of low frequencies of pDC infection in virus models such as herpes simplex virus 2 [56], Dengue [57], human cytomegalovirus [17], influenza [58], HCV [24] and HIV [59]. The inability of the primary human peripheral pDC population to be uniformly infected by rotaviruses may be attributable to multiple factors, including age of the individual pDC, stage of the cell cycle, or cell-surface marker expression. Additionally, functionally-distinct pDC subsets have been recently identified on the basis of CD2 expression [60]; studies are currently underway to elucidate the role of these subsets in the pDC response to rotavirus.",

Evidence of this functionality was observed primarily in the major NSP2- bystander population, although activation and maturation were significantly enhanced in the few NSP2+ pDCs, as well. The induction of this phenotype by inactivated RRV further indicates that the pDCs are responding to the presence of input virus or to secreted factors, and not to viral replication. The upregulation of DC costimulatory and maturation markers suggests antigen presentation to T cells is preserved, in line with previous reports that pDCs are necessary for stimulation of IFN\u03b3-secreting memory T cells [42]. The antigen presentation hypothesis is supported by increased expression of CD86 and CD83 on NSP2+ pDCs compared to bystander pDCs, indicating that the presence of virus enhances this phenotype. Conversely, IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 production is impaired in NSP2+ pDCs. Combined with decreased IRF7 phosphorylation in NSP2bright pDCs, this suggests the direct inhibition of the type I IFN response by rotavirus replication, as has been previously observed in fibroblasts and epithelial cells [45], [46], [47], [48].",

While it has previously been reported that exposure to rotavirus induces IFN\u03b1 secretion by murine FLT3 ligand-driven pDCs [39] and total human PBMCs [42], and that this response required pDCs [42], it was unclear until now whether pDCs produced IFN\u03b1 directly in response to virus, or if pDCs amplified IFN\u03b1 production in response to type I IFN or some other signal from a non-pDC. In a limited number of experiments, Mesa et al\n[42] observed not only pDCs singly positive for IFN\u03b1 or rotavirus, but also cells double-positive for rotavirus and IFN\u03b1 at a greater frequency than that reported here. It is important to note that Mesa et al used NSP4 as a marker for rotavirus infection. Extracellular NSP4 has been identified on uninfected cells [61]. Conversely, NSP2, employed in this report, to date has only been detected intracellularly. As such, the percentage of cells identified as positive for rotavirus on the basis of NSP4 staining could be inflated versus those expressing NSP2, as NSP4 staining may include pDCs not truly supporting viral replication; in turn, the percent of NSP4+IFN\u03b1+ pDCs would be artificially increased. This, combined with differences in sample size, may explain the discrepancies in the incidence of NSP4+IFN\u03b1+ pDCs (n = 3) observed by Mesa et al and the frequency of NSP2+IFN\u03b1+ pDCs (n = 27) reported here.",

Presumably, the constitutive expression of IRF7 in pDCs [63] allows for rapid induction of IFN\u03b1 following rotavirus exposure, thus effectively suppressing viral replication\u2014and the production of NSPs\u2014in the majority of pDCs through the establishment of a largely paracrine-induced antiviral state. This conclusion is supported by the observed lack of significant increase in the NSP2+ or IFN\u03b1+ pDC populations when the moi is increased to 25 or 100 (data not shown). Importantly, the decrease in IFN\u03b1 and pIRF7 in pDCs expressing high levels of NSP2 illustrates that the local suppression of the interferon response by actively replicating virus [45], [46], [47], [48] is conserved in human pDCs at an individual cell level. However, inhibition in this minor population is unlikely to substantially modulate the amount of cytokine produced by the total pDC population. The present study provides the first formal demonstration of type I IFN inhibition in primary human cells in which rotavirus replicates.",

The long-standing understanding of the requirement for VP4 proteolytic cleavage by luminal trypsin to activate viral entry and infection in the gut led to the assumption that efficient rotavirus infection could not occur systemically due to absence of appropriate extracellular proteases. Rotavirus infection was thought to be largely constrained to the intestine because this was the only anatomical location with substantial amounts of active extracellular trypsin available. The apparent dispensability of this proteolytic requirement for pDC infection may represent an alternate mechanism of rotavirus entry. This \u201cnon-trypsin dependent\u201d mechanism of infectious entry might also account for the low levels of systemic organ infection and spread that normally occurs during rotavirus infection, and the elevated levels seen during rotavirus infection of highly immunocompromised people or animals, where the systemic availability of trypsin to proteolytically activate rotavirus is unlikely. Additionally, this provides a mechanism for the establishment of an antiviral state systemically, where circulating virus would not be expected to be able to infect cells in the traditional, trypsin cleavage-dependent, manner.",

Conversely, viral replication is required for activation of the IFN response in fibroblasts [62]. Indeed, further analysis of the viral requirements for IFN\u03b1 induction suggests that pDCs recognize and respond to input rotavirus dsRNA or some degradation product of the rotavirus genome. This is supported by the inability of genome-free TLPs to effect IFN\u03b1 secretion, indicating that the lack of IFN\u03b1 induction following VLP-stimulus is due to the absence of a nucleic acid ligand and not to the lack of a minor structural protein, such as VP1 or VP3.

            "text": "Importantly, this finding may represent an alternative mechanism of IFN\u03b1 induction in primary human pDCs. The ability of a pDC that takes up rotavirus to mount a vigorous type I IFN response independently of rotavirus mRNA or protein expression provides a potential mechanism by which the host could effectively circumvent the anti-IFN effects of NSP1-mediated IRF degradation [62]. At least three possible mechanisms exist for this phenotype: first, input or self nucleic acid released from necrotic or apoptotic cells may serve as PAMPs in neighboring cells, as has been previously described [64]. As RRV exposure, either to replication-competent or inactivated virus, does not induce substantial pDC death (Figure 1), and as the cytokine response occurs rapidly following infection, this scenario seems unlikely. Secondly, input viral dsRNA may be exposed in the cytosol, the traditional cellular location for rotavirus replication, through the process of viral replication and interact with a cytosolic receptor such as RIG-I or protein kinase R (PKR). Rotavirus and reovirus, both members of the Reoviridae family, have been demonstrated to induce IFN\u03b2 production in epithelial and human embryonic kidney 293T cells, respectively, via RIG-I, but not PKR or TLR3 [65], [66]. The mechanism by which input viral genomic RNA recognition might occur is unclear, however, as viral dsRNA is thought to remain encapsidated in the DLP and not be free in the cytoplasm during viral replication. Finally, rotavirus particles may be taken up by and degraded within the endosome, where dsRNA or its degradation products, including ssRNA fragments or a single strand of the dsRNA [12], would be able to interact with TLR3, TLR7 or TLR9. As a biological role for known dsRNA receptors, such as RIG-I, PKR or TLR3, has not been demonstrated in human pDCs [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], it is unlikely that these receptors are responsible for the observed IFN\u03b1 induction in this system, although RIG-I like helicases have been recently implicated in the generation of a type I IFN response in pDCs from IFN receptor knockout mice [14]. Signaling by a cytosolic receptor should be abrogated if inhibition of endosomal acidification in turn prevented rotavirus entry into the cytosol. However, the persistence and even increase of NSP2 expression following treatment with concanamycin A indicates that pDC entry by rotavirus is conserved under conditions that alter endosomal pH and decrease the pDC IFN response (Figure 8). Thus, the substantial reduction of the IFN\u03b1 response following concanamycin A treatment supports the notion that an endosomal receptor, such as TLR7 or TLR9, is involved in the initiation of the pDC response to rotavirus. Hence we predict that dsRNA derived from input virus is exposed following viral degradation, and not replication, as inactivated RRV, but neither genome-free TLPs nor VLPs, is sufficient for pDC activation/maturation and IFN\u03b1 production. While it is possible that recognition of some combination of VP4, VP7 and dsRNA are required for IFN\u03b1 induction, we instead believe that viral entry\u2014mediated by VP7 and/or VP4\u2014and subsequent recognition of genomic dsRNA or its degradation products are the critical components of this pathway.",

Although the precise kinetics of induction are unclear, both TNF\u03b1 and IFN\u03b1 are also observed in pDC supernatants following influenza infection [24], [68], [69]. Interestingly, production of IFN\u03b1 is delayed until 14\u201320 h following infection with a laboratory strain of H1N1 influenza, at which point \u223c4 ng/mL per million pDCs is detectable; this production was dependent on viral replication [69]. Conversely, we report that pDCs exposed to either live or inactivated rotavirus secrete approximately 10 ng/mL of IFN\u03b1 by 6hpi. In agreement with previous findings [14], the recognition of secreted IFN\u03b1 is an important component of the amplification of the pDC IFN\u03b1 response to both live and inactivated rotavirus. As such, the recognition of input viral genome and subsequent induction of an initial IFN\u03b1 response prior to possible IRF7 inhibition allows for the establishment of an antiviral state by the global pDC population. While inactivated herpes simplex virus also induces IFN\u03b1, replication of vesicular stomatitis virus, Sendai virus and human respiratory syncytial virus has been demonstrated to be required for IFN\u03b1 induction in pDCs [70], [71]. Together, this demonstration of rapid, potent, replication-independent induction of cytokine by a dsRNA virus, largely dependent on endosomal acidification, points to a novel mechanism leading to production of IFN\u03b1 by human pDCs.",

Increased levels of serum IFN\u03b1 have been reported in human pediatric patients infected with rotavirus [43], [44]; levels peaked within two days of symptom onset and disease resolved more quickly in patients with the highest levels of IFN\u03b1 [43]. Likewise, type I IFN responses were observed in newborn calves infected with bovine rotavirus: animals receiving both high and low doses of viral inoculums generated multiple waves of IFN production, with higher doses correlating with both more rapid IFN responses and a lack of clinical signs [74]. As the ability of type I IFN to activate multiple arms of the innate and adaptive immune response is well documented (reviewed in [75], [76], [77]), and recent data have shown that type I IFN plays a critical role in restricting systemic rotavirus infection [78], we predict that pDC-derived type I IFN plays a significant role in confining rotavirus replication to the intestine while initiating the systemic immune response in the periphery.",

            "text": "In summary, these studies show that primary human pDCs are largely resistant to rotavirus replication, but that they remain responsive and functional following viral exposure, as indicated by cellular activation, maturation and production of multiple cytokines, including TNF\u03b1 and large amounts of IFN\u03b1. The pDC response is demonstrated to require both the viral dsRNA genome and acidification of the pDC endosome, implying the likely initiation of the type I IFN response by TLR7 or TLR9. To our knowledge, these data are the first to show that inactivated rotavirus can efficiently induce a type I IFN response, which differs from what has been seen in fibroblasts and epithelial cells exposed to rotavirus [62]. The restricted ability of rotavirus to replicate in pDCs, combined with the ability of the pDC to effect a type I IFN response in the absence of viral replication, likely serves the purposes of enabling the host to mount an innate antiviral response despite the efficient degradation of the IRFs by rotavirus NSP1 in many host cells. Combined with the novel dispensability of trypsin cleavage of VP4 for the initiation of the pDC response, this creates a mechanism for the establishment of an antiviral state in the systemic extraintestinal environment and likely contributes to the substantial restriction of systemic replication compared to that observed in the intestine [38]. These experiments also provide the first indication that rotavirus infection is capable of locally suppressing IFN\u03b1 production in primary human cells. Importantly, these findings demonstrate that rotavirus infection of primary human pDCs provides a valuable experimental system for the study of cellular processes, receptors and signaling pathways underlying pDC-mediated antiviral immunity while revealing a potentially novel dsRNA-mediated pathway of IFN\u03b1 induction.",
