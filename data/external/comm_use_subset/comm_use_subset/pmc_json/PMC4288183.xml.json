The majority of noroviruses express three conserved open reading frames named ORF1\u20133 while MNV has an additional ORF4 (12,13). ORF1 encodes a polyprotein which is processed by proteolysis to generate six non-structural (NS) proteins that replicate and transcribe the viral genome. These include NS7, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (14). ORF2 and ORF3 encode the major and the minor capsid proteins, respectively. ORF4 of MNV is translated from an alternative reading frame within ORF2 to produce virulence factor 1 that targets innate immune responses (13). The proteins from ORF1 are translated from the norovirus genomic RNA. The proteins from ORF2, ORF3 and ORF4 are translated from one polyadenylated RNA of ca. 2.5 kb in length, the subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) (12,13).",

All RNA synthesis reactions were of 20 \u03bcl and contained 20 mM sodium glutamate (pH 8.2), 12.5 mM dithiothreitol, 4 mM MgCl2, 1 mM MnCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100 (v/v), 0.2 mM guanosine triphosphate (GTP), 0.1 mM adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and uridine thriphosphate (UTP), 33.3 nM [\u03b1-32P]- cytidine triphosphate (CTP) (MP Biomedicals), 50 nM of template RNA and 250 nM of recombinant RdRp unless indicated otherwise. The reaction was incubated at 30\u00b0C for 2 h, and then stopped by the addition of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (pH 8.0) to a final concentration of 10 mM. RNA products were directly loaded onto a 24% polyacrylamide gel containing 7.5 M urea. The radiolabeled RNA products were visualized and quantified by using a PhosphoImager (Typhoon 9210; Amersham Biosciences) and ImageQuant software.",

The mass spectrometer was operated in an automated data dependent mode, alternating between an FT-MS scan in the Orbitrap and five collision-induced dissociation (CID) scans in the linear ion trap. The Orbitrap monitored precursor ions from m/z 300 to m/z 2000 at 15 000 resolving power. The five most intense precursor ions in each scan were sequentially isolated in the linear trap with a 2 m/z isolation width and activated at 35% normalized collision energy.

The 11-nt product likely initiated from the initiation cytidylate in the template (to be named T + 1 cytidylate) and terminated at the end of the template sequence in the proscript. The 10-nt product likely arose from correct de novo initiation from the T + 1 cytidylate but terminated one nucleotide before the RdRp reached the final 3\u2032 nucleotide of the template RNA. Premature termination of RNA synthesis has been reported for several recombinant RdRps in vitro (35,36). To confirm that the MNV RdRp can accurately initiate RNA synthesis from the T + 1 cytidylate, we used proscript MpsIM, which has the same sequence as Mps except for an adenylate substitution at the T + 1 position. MpsIM did not direct the synthesis of either the 11- or 10-nt product, but did generate primer extension products longer than the input template (Figure 1D). This result demonstrates that the MNV RdRp can accurately initiate RNA synthesis from Mps. Interestingly, in multiple trials the primer-extended product was more abundant with MpsIM than with Mps, suggesting that the lack of de novo initiated RNA synthesis enabled the RdRp to engage in primer-dependent RNA synthesis.",

Given that the MNV system offers greater flexibility for genetic manipulation than the human norovirus, we focused this mapping effort on the MNV RdRp despite its reduced specificity for its proscript. The mapping studies used the RCAP protocol, which combines reversible crosslinking and peptide mass fingerprinting to identify peptide sequences within the RdRp that can crosslink to the viral RNA (Figure 4A). Briefly, the RNAs and RdRp were crosslinked with formaldehyde, followed by extensive digestion of the complex with trypsin. The RNAs and peptides associated with RNA were precipitated with LiCl and the crosslinks reversed by heating. MALDI-ToF/MS was then used to identify the RNA-associated peptides. Control reactions that contained the MNV RdRp treated with formaldehyde in the absence of RNA, or the RdRp-RNA complex that were not crosslinked with formaldehyde did not yield signals above background. However, 17 peptides derived from the MNV RdRp were identified to be associated with Mps, and 11 with Mhp (Figure 4B and Supplementary Figure S1). Within each data set, several peptides had overlapping sequences due to missed cleavages by trypsin, which is expected to occur when an arginine or lysine residue is crosslinked to the RNA. Eight of the 17 MNV RdRp peptides identified to associate with Mps, only 8 represent unique regions in the RdRp. In addition, all the peptides identified as associated with Mhp were also present in reactions performed with the MNV RdRp and Mps. This should be expected, given that Mps contains the hairpin that is Mph. To visualize the locations of these peptides, we mapped these peptides on the MNV-1 RdRp crystral structure (PDB: 3QID) (39) (Figure 4C). Notably, the majority of the cross-linked peptides are located in the central cavity of the MNV RdRp, where RNA synthesis occurs.",

Three versions of Mhp were chemically synthesized to each contain 4SU at residues 2, 15 or 24 to generate RNAs named, respectively, 2-4SU, 15-4SU, and 24-4SU (Figure 5A). In vitro RNA synthesis assays confirmed that the three RNAs inhibited RNA synthesis from Mps to the same degree as the unmodified Mhp (Supplementary Figure S2). Following crosslinking to MNV RdRp and trypsin digestion, the peptide-RNA complexes were precipitated with LiCl. The RNAs in the complexes were then thoroughly digested to release nucleotides from the peptides, leaving only the crosslinked nucleotide. The identities of the cross-linked peptides were then determined by high-resolution and collision induced dissociation (CID) mass spectra using the LTQ-Orbitrap instrument. Kramer et al. have shown that crosslinking of proteins and 4SU substituted RNAs could undergo the loss of H2S, the loss of the double bond in 4SU, and the loss of phosphates from either or both the 3\u2032 or the 5\u2032 positions (45). All of these structural possibilities were considered during analysis of the Orbitrap mass spectra for the crosslinking reactions between the MNV RdRp protein and the modified RNAs. Three different peptides having one or more 4SU molecules attached to either arginine or lysine residues were identified from the reactions of RdRp with the modified RNAs. The sequence LDRASIDRQLLWTK from residues 409\u2013422 was identified with certainty to bind 15-4SU (Figure 5B). CID data indicated that 15-4SU crosslinked to R411 and R416 side chains and resulted in the loss of its sulfur atom as shown in Figure 5C. Two additional peptides KRLLWGSDLGTMIR (residues 184\u2013197; crosslinked arginine underlined) and WDSTQQRAILK (residues 249\u2013259, crosslinked arginine and lysine underlined) were identified to bind 24-4SU and 2-4SU, respectively (Supplementary Figure S3). However, some signals for both peptides were also observed with 2-SU and 24-4SU, suggesting that the bulged region in the hairpin and the base of the hairpin RNA could contact the RdRp at two different locations. The three 4SU cross-linked peptides identified here were also identified in the RCAP assay discussed previously (Figure 4). The locations of the five cross-linked residues are shown in the model of the MNV RdRp in Figure 5D.",

Interestingly, the abundance of primer extension products made by R411K or R411A was comparable or slightly higher than those produced by the wild-type MNV RdRp. Mutant R416A was severely reduced for both primer extension and de novo initiation (Figure 6B). When the concentration of the WT or the mutated RdRps was increased, R411A restored the de novo initiation activity to a level similar to that of the WT RdRp. Mutant R416A did produce more products when tested at higher concentrations, but both primer extension and de novo initiation remained sharply reduced compared to that of WT RdRp. Surprisingly, of the two major de novo initiated RNA products made by R416A, the product prematurely terminated by 1-nt was more abundant than the full-length product (Figure 6C). Recombinant RdRps that are affected in the recognition of the template-nascent RNA duplex have previously been shown to increase premature termination (46). Quantification of the RNAs synthesized by R411A, R416A or a mutant with substitutions at both R411 and R416 are shown in Figure 6D.

Furthermore, the RdRp sequence alignment shows the GII.4 RdRp has a glutamine at position 408 and an alanine at position 256, which is comparable to R411 and K259 of the MNV RdRp (Figure 5E). These observations led us to determine whether GII.4 RdRp with substitutions of Q408R, A256K or both could improve de novo RNA synthesis with the heterologous MNV proscript. All three mutant RdRps produced comparable amounts of product from Gps when compared to the WT GII.4, indicating no loss of specificity for their cognate proscript (Figure 7A and B). In comparison to the WT MNV RdRp, the mutants directed much lower levels of de novo initiation of the 11-nt RNA from Mps. However, an approximately 2-fold increase was observed with the Q408R and the Q408R/A256K mutant proteins in comparison to the WT GII.4 RdRp (Figure 7C). Although the increase in RNA synthesis is modest, the results are reproducible in three independent assays. These results support the previous data suggesting that residue R411 in the MNV RdRp is important in directing de novo-initiated RNA synthesis by the MNV RdRp from the subgenomic core promoter. This data also suggests that GII.4 RdRp has additional requirements for the recognition of its subgenomic proscript than does the MNV RdRp.",

Sequencing of the R411A and R411K viruses revealed that they retain the engineered mutations and that they have no other mutations. In western blots, all four viruses produced the NS7 protein (Figure 8A). Constructs engineered to express the R416A and R411AR416A viruses failed to produce infectious virus (Figure 8A).

We demonstrated that the recombinant RdRps from the GII.4 human norovirus and from MNV can specifically recognized their cognate subgenomic promoters and template sequences. Within the proscripts, both the hairpin and single-stranded regions that include the template sequence contribute to RNA synthesis.

            "text": "RdRps are one of the four major classes of template-dependent polymerases that also include DNA-dependent DNA polymerases, the reverse transcriptases, and the DNA-dependent RNA polymerases. It is worth noting that core promoter recognition by the recombinant norovirus RdRps is a feature shared with bacteriophage DNA-dependent RNA polymerases (37,58\u201359). Iyer et al. (60) had proposed that the ancestor of the RNA polymerases contains an RNA-binding domain that preceded the acquisition of polymerase activity. Higher resolution analysis of the interactions between the norovirus RdRps and their cognate promoters would therefore provide insight to potentially ancient protein\u2013RNA interaction as well as inform the mechanism of viral RNA synthesis.",

(C) RNA products made by the RdRps from the GII.4 human norovirus, MNV, and the HCV. Products correctly initiated by a de novo mechanism and terminated after the 3\u2032 terminus of the template are identified by asterisks. The gel image was obtained using a Phosphorimager of a 24% polyacrylamide gel that contains 7.5 M urea. The lengths of the de novo initiated RNAs were derived from previous analyses where the MNV RdRp products were electrophoresed along with products of known lengths. (D) Proscripts with substitutions of the T + 1 cytidylate are unable to direct de novo initiation of RNA products by the MNV and the GII.4 RdRps. The products of primer extension (PE) and de novo initiation (DN) are shown. The RNAs that are correctly initiated and terminated from Mps and Gps are, respectively, 11- and 8-nt.",
