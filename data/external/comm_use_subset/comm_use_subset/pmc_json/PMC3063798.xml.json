The most frequently implicated viruses among hospitalized children are respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), influenza A and B viruses (InfV A and InfV B), parainfluenza viruses (PIV1-2-3) and adenoviruses (AdV) [3]. Other commonly implicated causes are human rhinoviruses (hRV), human coronaviruses (hCoV), enteroviruses (EnV) and human bocavirus (HBoV) [4], [5], [6], [7], [8].",

However, limited resources and laboratory capacity precludes the routine use of molecular diagnostics in tropical lower-income countries such as Vietnam. As a consequence, insight into the aetiology of ARIs is lowest in regions of the world where morbidity and mortality are highest. Better understanding of the full spectrum of respiratory viruses causing ARIs in hospitalized patients in these settings is essential for improving preventive and therapeutic strategies and prioritizing diagnostic efforts.",

Children were eligible for inclusion if less than 15 years of age and if admitted for an ARI or ARI-related condition (respiratory distress, pneumonia, bronchiolitis, croup) with an onset of illness less than 5 days before hospitalization. Excluded were patients who were discharged from a hospital in the previous 4 days, newborns who never left the hospital, patients with uncomplicated upper respiratory illness (e.g. rhinitis, sinusitis, otitis media), or patients with proven or suspected non-infectious respiratory symptoms (e.g asthma). Demographic, socio-economic, and clinical data were documented in case report forms (CRFs). Three types of respiratory specimens (nasal swabs, throat swabs, and nasopharyngeal aspirates) were collected on admission by trained personnel using standard operating procedures, and were placed in viral transport medium [10]. Specimens were kept at 4\u00b0C for a maximum of 24 h and then aliquotted and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until further processing.",

Since July 2007, an automated commercial GuSCN-based method was used, according the instructions of the manufacturer (Easy MAG 2.0, bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy l'\u00c9toile, France). For each individual patient, all three respiratory specimens were extracted simultaneously. An internal RNA-virus control (equine arteritis virus (EAV)) was added to each sample prior to extraction at a standard concentration yielding a Ct value of 30 to 35 cycles in real-time RT-PCR. RNA was reversely transcribed using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) and random hexamers (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Each 20 \u00b5l reaction mixture contained 5 \u00b5l extracted RNA, 4 \u00b5l l of 5X RT-buffer, 0.5 mM of each dNTP (Roche), 2 ng random hexamer, 10 mM DTT (Invitrogen), 1 UI of RNAse inhibitor and 2 UI RT Superscript III.

Sensitivity per sample and virus was assessed using the following definitions: true negatives (TN), defined as the number of patients negative in all three specimens and false negatives (FN), defined as a negative sample while an alternative specimen from the same patient tested positive for a given virus. For the comparison of independent groups, we used the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous data and the Fisher exact test for categorical data. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for pairwise comparisons of matched pairs of Ct values of the three types specimens from monoplex real-time RT-PCRs for HBoV, enteroviruses and hCoV NL63. Sensitivities of the different specimen types were compared using McNemar's test. All statistical tests were conducted at the two-tailed 5% significance level.

Compared to PRW admitted patients, a significant higher number of PICU patients were hospitalized for more than 7 days (\nTable 2\n). In addition, they were more likely to have been exposed to cooking smoke and more often had other family members who were sick at home.

Increasing evidence suggests that RSV infections may be related to asthma phenotypes, with progressive disappearance of this effect with increasing age [28]. As such, our findings emphasize the importance of screening for RSV in paediatric cases of asthma. Our results also confirm observations of Allander et al suggesting an association between HBoV levels and symptoms of wheezing [7], indicating that information about viral load may be important for better understanding of disease pathogenesis.",

Indoor pollution due to biomass fuels (wood, crop residues and animal dung) or coal burning is a known risk factor for ARI mortality and morbidity in developing countries[29], [30].

Delays in presentation are typical of health seeking behavior in lower income households of developing countries [31].

Regardless of the diagnostic approach, NPA specimens typically exhibit increased sensitivity (15-31%) relative to nasal swabs or throat swabs. However, the differential increase appears less marked for molecular based methods [32]. Indeed, results of the present study indicate that, although NPAs yielded the highest overall yield of virus detection (78%, 173/222), the differential improvement over nasal or throat swabs was marginal and not statistically significant across all viruses (\nTable 6\n). Nevertheless, NPAs were significantly superior to nasal or throat swabs for detection of influenza viruses (p\u22640.05), whereas throat swabs were superior for enteroviruses (p\u22640.05). Combining the results of nasal and throat swabs rendered comparable sensitivities to NPAs for detection of all respiratory viruses of our panel and increased sensitivity for enteroviruses. As nasal and throat swabs are easier to obtain and less distressing for patients, these samples are preferred in our setting.",

However, this prevented the possibility of addressing key questions about bacterial pathogens and the possible role of viral and bacterial co-infections. As nearly all children in our study received antibiotic treatment, and issues involving judicious use of antibiotics and resistance development is becoming increasingly important in Vietnam, inclusion of bacterial pathogens in future studies will be essential. Second, our testing algorithm did not include measles virus. We suspect there may have been undiagnosed measles cases within our cohort, since 6/18 cases who presented with rash on admission were negative for all viruses tested; furthermore, national surveillance data indicates that Vietnam experienced a rise in measles cases in 2005\u20132006 [38]. Lastly, our sample size was limited and insufficient to allow more refined observations regarding differences in age distributions, clinical characteristics, or determinants of severity between specific viral species. The principle reasons for limited enrollment were a) resource constraints and feasibility (overburdening of doctors and nurses in wards where admission of 2 to 3 patients per bed is common practice), and b) limited familiarity with clinical research among patients and parents in this setting and thus additional challenges to obtaining consent. In total, during the 3-year study period, only 4.1% of all admitted ARI patients at the respiratory ward (40 beds) were enrolled in the study, and 14.2% of ARI patients admitted to the PICU (15 beds). While the sample size of enrolled patients relative to the total number of admitted patients was small, the proportion remained stable throughout the study period and the number of enrolled patients followed a similar pattern as the number of admitted patients over time (\nFigure 2\n). For these reason, we believe that our study population nevertheless provided a reasonable representation of the overall ARI patient population in Ho Chi Minh City at the time.",
