In this study, average time between steroid administration and initial MRI scan was 45.7 \u00b1 25.5 days (range, 10\u201394 days) and between steroid administration and ONFH diagnosis was 199.9 \u00b1 165.8 days (range, 32\u2013762 days). All of these studies indicated that the adverse effects of steroid-induced osteonecrosis are time limited.

Untreated ONFH has a poor outcome and often leads to subchondral collapse within a short period.[20,21] Surgical head-preserving procedures are helpful to relieve pain and improve function of the affected femoral heads only in the early stage.[4\u20139] Most patients must undergo total hip arthroplasty when the femoral head collapsed. Even with great progress in the design and technology of prostheses, revision (with unfavorable prognosis) is needed 20 to 30 years later.[22,23] Thus, early diagnosis is very important for a good prognosis. Knowledge of the time lag between steroid use and MRI-detectable disease can aid us in making a detailed and reasonable screening plan. In this study, 21 cases with discomfort were misdiagnosed because the initial MRI presentation was normal. Twelve hips progressed to the collapsed stage, and 1 received lumbar discectomy after the final diagnosis. All of these events could be avoided if another MRI were performed 6 to 12 months after steroid therapy.",

The latter corresponds to the development and calcification of vascular connective tissue between healthy and necrotic bone. Although granulation tissue development is a physiological response that contains the lesion and promotes healing, the subsequently formed fibrosis and sclerotic bone act as a barrier to revascularization of the bone marrow and the transport of the cytokines and other cellular mediators needed to remodel the bone. Necrotic bone has poor biomechanical properties. When mechanical constraints exceed bone resistance, stress fracture occurs, resulting in femoral head collapse and hip osteoarthritis. The use of some drugs, such as lipid-lowering drugs, anticoagulants, vasodilators, and traditional Chinese medicines, during the time lag period may reduce occurrence of necrosis.[24,25] Other methods, such as electromagnetic stimulation, extracorporeal shock-wave therapy, hyperbaric oxygen, and core decompression, may alter the prognosis of ONFH.[7\u20139]",

Fleeting joint pain may resolve by itself or be treated with calcium antagonists. The mechanism of fleeting joint pain has yet to be elucidated but may be related to corticosteroid impulse therapy. In this study, 12/21 patients complained of short-term pain 4 to 30 days (average 14.7 \u00b1 8.3 days) after steroid therapy. Another MRI was performed when the pain recurred.
