These infections have not only an impact on children\u2019s health and well-being, but also generate high medical costs and indirect costs for the family and the society [4,5]. Indeed, on average, young children experience 4\u20136 upper respiratory tract infections per year [6], but when they grow older, the incidence of these infections decreases, probably as a result of a more mature immune defenses and improved anatomical conditions. The most common pathogens involved in the etiology of recurrent respiratory infections are human rhinoviruses (HRV), adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, enterovirus, human metapneumovirus and coronavirus, in addition to influenza viruses and rhinovirus [6,7]. A major pathogenetic role is played by rhinoviruses, the most frequent causative agents of both upper and lower respiratory tract infections in infants and young children that are able to induce a broad variety of clinical outcomes, ranging from asymptomatic infections to severe respiratory diseases requiring hospitalization [6,8].",

Besides providing a physical and functional barrier to external agents, airway epithelial cells are also actively involved in initiation of the host inflammatory and immune responses through the release of early inflammatory mediators [9,10]. Through the activation of their surface pattern recognition receptors, that detect environmental stimuli, airway epithelial cells secrete endogenous danger signals, thereby activating dendritic cells and bridging innate and adaptive immunity [9-11].",

The availability of PCR techniques has lead to a significant improvement in virus detection rate and shown that HRVs, principally known as the \u201ccommon cold\u201d viruses, are involved in the pathogenesis of wheezing disorders in 41-45% of young children [29]. Approximately 90% of the different HRV serotypes known utilize, as specific receptor ICAM-1, a molecule expressed on the surface of airway epithelial cells [30]. HRV infection upregulates ICAM-1 expression on airway epithelial cells, thus facilitating further viral attachment and entry [31]. Besides being a major receptor for HRVs, ICAM-1 is also involved in the transmigration across airway epithelial monolayers of neutrophils and their activation [32], and in disorders characterized by neutrophil-mediated acute lung injury [33]. Therefore the observation that in our experimental model pidotimod did not increase the constitutive or the TNF-\u03b1 -induced ICAM-1 expression may be interpreted as a \u201cprotective function\u201d, to avoid enhanced susceptibility to human HRV and neutrophil-mediated damage to the airway surface. A similar interpretation can be made for the results on IL-8 release.",

The expression of surface molecules (such as ICAM-1 and TLR-2) is regulated not only by different stimuli [31,37,38] but also by dissimilar intracellular pathways that may be triggered by the same stimulus [38-41]. An example is the activity of IFN-\u03b3, able to have opposite effects on ICAM-1 and TLR-2 expression (up- and down-regulation, respectively) on different cell types [37,38,42]. The characteristics of pidotimod, to be able to regulate differently the expression of surface molecules has already been demonstrated by Gourgiotis D. and co-workers [43]. Using blood mononuclear cells, isolated from atopic asthmatic and normal children, they showed that through unknown intracellular mechanisms pidotimod downregulated the expression of CD30 induced by phytohaemoagglutinin but had no effect on human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR molecules [43].",

            "text": "TLRs are a class of proteins that play a key role in the innate immune system, recognizing structurally conserved molecules derived from microbes [44]. TLRs are a type of pattern recognition receptor and recognize molecules that are broadly shared by pathogens but distinguishable from host molecules, collectively referred to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Of the ten mammalian TLR proteins identified thus far, TLR-2 seems to be the least discriminating, since it recognizes many bacterial, fungal, viral, and certain endogenous substances [44,45]. Recognition of PAMPs results in internalization and phagocytosis of bound molecules and in cellular activation with release of cytokines, chemokines and various interleukins [44,45]. Cytokines participating in this \u201cnonspecific\u201d immune defense include various interleukins, such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-12. PAMPs-TLR interactions on the surface of the cells are sufficient to activate the Ca2+ fluxes associated with induction of NF-kB in the airway [46]. Recent studies have implicated TLR, and especially TLR-2 and TLR-4, as sentinel receptors able to signaling the interaction of the host cells with bacterial pathogens via an NF-kB-mediated pathway [47]. Interestingly, using murine macrophages it was shown that TLR-2 mRNA may be induced after bacterial infection with the involvement of several cytokines, including IL-1 \u03b1, and GM-CSF, but that NF-kB is necessary for maximal TLR-2 transcription [48], further underlining the tight connections between NF-kB and TLR-2.",

Rather than pidotimod, elevated intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in lung epithelial cells can activate these pathways [60,61].
