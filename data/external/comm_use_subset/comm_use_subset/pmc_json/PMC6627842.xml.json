They also contain a rich variety of vitamins, such as A, Bl, B12, C, D, and E; riboflavin; niacin; pantothenic acid; and folic acid, as well as minerals, such as calcium, phosphorus, sodium, potassium, and iodine [6]. Polysaccharides (laminarins and fucoidans), polyphenols such as phlorotannins [7], carotenoid pigments such as fucoxanthin [8] and astaxanthin, sterols, and mycosporine-like amino acids have been isolated from seaweeds in the past.",

According to their linkages, phlorotannins can be characterized into fuhalols and phlorethols having an ether linkage, fucols having a phenyl linkage, fucophloroethols with an ether and phenyl linkage, and eckols having a dibenzodioxin linkage. Ecklonia is the most abundant genus of kelp (brown algae) associated with the Lessoniaceae family having an affluence of eckol-type phlorotannins.",

Through the pathway of phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase/forkhead box O3a (AMPK/FoxO3a), the MnSOD expression was induced by eckol.

Enhancement of the phosphorylated form, nuclear translocation, antioxidant response element (ARE)-binding, and transcriptional activity of Nrf2 was observed in V79-4 cells upon exposure to 10 \u00b5g/mL of eckol. Furthermore, Nrf2 mediated the eckol-induced activation of the HO-1 promoter. The Nrf2 activation and induction of HO-1 expression were due to the contribution of the extracellular related kinase (Erk) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/PKB). To further assess the likeliness of the cytoprotective activity of eckol due to HO-1 induction, the V79-4 cells were pretreated with HO-1 inhibitor zinc protoporphyrin (10 \u00b5M) and transfected with HO-1 siRNA (10\u201350 nM) and Nrf2 siRNA (10\u201350 nM). All of them markedly reduced the cytoprotective effect of eckol against H2O2-induced cell damage suggesting the involvement of Nrf2 transcription factor in eckol-mediated HO-1 induction. Additionally, the cytoprotective effect of eckol was reduced by U0126 (an inhibitor of ERK kinase) (10 nM) and LY294002 (an inhibitor of PI3K) (5 \u03bcM).

Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A\u2013benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor, a well-recognized target for sedative-hypnotics was used to test the binding activity of methanol extracts of 30 seaweeds. Among the seaweeds, the most active ethanol extract of E. cava significantly increased sleep in mice when induced by pentobarbital. Among the four separated solvent fractions, hypnotic activity was related to the content of total phenols and total phlorotannins in the seaweed. The highest activity was exhibited by the EtOAc fraction which constituted of phlorotannins eckol, dioxinodehydroeckol, dieckol, and triphlorethol-A. Eckol (Ki 1.070 \u00b5M) and dioxinodehydroeckol (Ki 1.491 \u00b5M) showed better binding at the receptor than triphlorethol-A (Ki 4.419 \u00b5M) and dieckol (Ki 3.072 \u00b5M).

            "text": "The involvement of G-protein coupled receptors in human pathophysiology and their pharmacological traceability has emphasized on design and implementation of high-throughput G protein coupled receptor functional assays to identify novel drug candidates [98]. Dopamine receptors are specific therapeutic targets for PD, schizophrenia, and drug abuse. According to the stimulatory or inhibitory properties of the secondary messenger, cyclic adenosine monophosphate, dopamine receptors are categorized as G\u03b1s/olf-coupled D1-like (D1 and D5) and G\u03b1i/o-coupled D2-like (D2, D3, and D4) receptors [99]. At a concentration of 25 \u03bcM, eckol conferred a 10.60% and 36.55% of the control agonist effect on the human dopamine D3 receptor (hD3R) and human D4 receptor (hD4R), respectively. At 50 \u03bcM eckol, the agonist response increased to above 50%, giving EC50 values of 48.62 \u00b1 3.21 and 42.55 \u00b1 2.54 \u03bcM for hD3R and hD4R, respectively. However, eckol did not show any modulating effect on dopamine D1, serotonin 1A (5-HT1A), vasopressin (V1A), tachykinin (NK1) or muscarinic (M5) receptors [56]. In the context of molecular docking, negative binding energy (\u22126.41 kcal/mol) was exhibited by eckol, bound to the active site of the hD3R receptor, forming five H\u2013bond interactions. Similarly, eckol bound to the active site cavity of hD4R with a negative binding energy (\u22126.46 kcal/mol) that was lower than dopamine (\u22125.68 kcal/mol), possibly as a result of four H\u2013bond interactions. Even though eckol did not form a salt bridge to the carboxylate group of Asp110 of hD3R and Asp115 of hD4R important for high-affinity ligand binding to dopaminergic receptors [100], it formed an H\u2013bond (O\u2013H) interaction. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation showed that the interaction of eckol with the binding pocket had changed significantly. Through the H\u2013bonds, seven water molecules were involved in the interaction with eckol. In the MD simulation, Ser192 and Phe346 were the two new interacting residues. Eckol formed an H-bond interaction with Ser192 at a distance of 2.82 \u00c5 that was important for the activation of D3R. On the other hand, Phe346 displayed a hydrophobic interaction with eckol initiating a conformational change in the protein and ligand inside the binding pocket. Through \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions, Phe346 also bound to eticlopride and dopamine contributing to the stabilization of ligand inside the binding pocket. The conserved serine residues in helix V also plays an important role as a molecular determinant for agonist-induced signaling from dopamine receptors. The Ser192 of hD3R (Ser197 of hD4R) and a hydroxyl moiety of eckol presented an H\u2013bond interaction, implying eckol as a dual hD3/D4R agonist. A logPo/w value of 2.99, an excellent binding to plasma protein (100%) and a moderate human intestinal absorption of 55.60%, was predicted through in silico pharmacokinetic parameter PreADMET. Also, the in vivo blood\u2013brain barrier penetration calculations showed a moderate absorption (25%) by the central nervous system. [56]. ",

Representing a significantly diminished death rate, 28.6% (4/14) of the irradiated, untreated group survived for 30 days after exposure to 9 Gy of WBI while 86.6% (13/15) of the mice survived for 30 days that received eckol plus irradiation.

The results did not alter for the non-irradiated group when treated with eckol alone. The revival of hematopoietic ability by the splenic progenitor cells due to the eckol was indicated by the 50% increase in the number of CFUs. A decrease in the percentage of tail DNA (14.7 \u00b1 5.6%) after eckol treatment in irradiation-damaged lymphocytes as compared to the content of tail DNA (42.5 \u00b1 8.7%) when exposed only to 7 Gy of WBI was shown by alkaline comet assay.

To assess whether the effectiveness of eckol in inhibiting DNA damage was accountable to apoptotic changes, the nuclear morphology of lymphocytes was assessed in irradiated mice as peripheral blood lymphocytes are easily harmed by ionizing radiation. The number of apoptotic nuclei was reduced dramatically in the eckol treated group in comparison with the irradiated control group (9.95 \u00b1 0.50% versus 14.85 \u00b1 0.39%). Hence, the viability of peripheral blood lymphocyte was protected by inhibiting apoptotic cell death induced by ionizing radiation in vivo. The frequency of apoptotic fragments in crypt cells was reduced in the eckol-treated group by 16.63% compared to the untreated group (4.51 \u00b1 0.30%) after 24 h of WBI treatment revealing the ability of eckol to protect intestinal crypt cells from radiation-induced apoptosis. The increase in the expression level of p53 and Bax, commonly seen after WBI, was also reduced by eckol with the induction in the expression level of Bcl-2, which is involved in apoptosis and DNA repair. In those ways, eckol treatment modulated the immunohistochemical localization and magnitude of apoptosis-related proteins in jejunal crypt cells. Therefore, eckol administration could provide great benefits for cancer patients by effectively preventing the apoptosis of peripheral blood lymphocytes and intestinal crypt cells induced by radiation [62]. Furthermore, eckol pre-treatment scavenged ROS in \u03b3-irradiated V79-4 cells and protected against DNA damage by decreasing 8-OHdG adduct of DNA, a biomarker of oxidative stress. Eckol also decreased the lipid peroxidation in the \u03b3-irradiated V79-4 cells. The apoptosis induced by \u03b3-irradiation was also decreased in eckol (10 \u03bcg/ml) pre-treated cells with a decrease in DNA fragmentation. An increase in Bcl-2 expression and a decrease of Bax expression in \u03b3-ray irradiated cells treated with eckol further inhibiting the caspase-dependent pathway via mitochondria. The SEK1-JNK-AP-1 is the major pathway that is suppressed by eckol for decreasing the \u03b3-ray irradiation-induced apoptosis [65]. ",

Matrix metalloproteinases are zinc-containing proteinases that degrade collagen and the other extracellular matrix proteins comprising the dermal connective tissue [107,108,109]. Proteolytic events in the human system which include embryogenesis, wound healing, inflammation, angiogenesis, and cancer involve MMPs [109,110,111,112]. The connective tissue damage that occurs in photo aging is due to MMP-mediated collagen destruction [113], where MMP-1 is the major factor involved in the deterioration of dermal collagen in the process of aging [114,115]. Evaluation of 29 seaweed extracts for active compounds that can inhibit MMP-1 expression led to seaweeds E. stolonifera, E. bicyclis, and E. cava exhibiting more potent inhibition of NF-\u03baB and AP-1 than seaweeds from other families. They also showed protection against collagen destruction through the TNF\u03b1-induced inhibition of MMP-1 expression. Eckol and dieckol isolated from E. stolonifera diminished the expression of MMP-1 induced by TNF-\u03b1 and basal expression of MMP-1, and reduced both NF-\u03baB and AP-1 reporter gene activity in human dermal fibroblasts. Hence, these results indicate that the reduction of MMP-1 expression is due to the compounds eckol and dieckol [57].",

A decrease in tumor incidence was seen when brown algal polyphenols were administered through diet (79%) and skin (94%) with moderate protection against skin carcinogenesis induced by UV-B radiation in mice. The propagation of tumor decreased from 8.54 \u00b1 0.75 to 4.73 \u00b1 0.74 (p < 0.005) and 3.75 \u00b1 0.54 (p < 0.001) when treated with 0.1% and 0.5% brown polyphenols through diet, in tumors/tumor-bearing mice, exhibiting a 45% and 56% inhibition. On the other hand, topical administration of 3 and 6 mg of these compounds reduced tumor multiplicity from 8.45 \u00b1 1.23 to 3.42 \u00b1 0.56 (p < 0.001) and 4.56 \u00b1 0.56 (p < 0.005), respectively, in tumors/tumor-bearing mice. They also suppressed the gene expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, decreased PGE2 levels in the skin, inhibited the amount of COX-2 protein, and reduced the rate of proliferating cells in the epidermis. In summary, eckol exerts protective effects against skin carcinogenesis induced by UVB radiation [59]. Also in another study, the photo-protective effects of phlorotannins on the cell damage caused by UVB radiation was demonstrated. The E. cava-isolated phlorotannins (phloroglucinol, eckol, and dieckol) and polyphenol were examined for their protective effect against UVB-induced photo-oxidative stress in human fibroblast cells. Eckol exhibited slightly low activity against UVB radiation-mediated ROS (174.4% ROS at 250 \u00b5M) as compared to dieckol (100.7% ROS at 250 \u03bcM) when the level of ROS was recorded as 234.1% in UVB-irradiated cells (positive control). Eckol showed cell survival rates of 45%, 50%, and 56% at concentrations of 5, 50, and 100 \u00b5M, respectively. The comet assay was performed to evaluate whether phlorotannins protected against DNA damage and revealed that eckol had about 21%, 43%, and 53% inhibitory activity at concentrations of 0.5, 5, and 50 \u00b5M, respectively [60].",

However, eckol exhibited very weak inhibition on anti-thrombin III-heparin complex and exhibited no inhibition on plasmin. The inhibitory activity of eckol was reduced in whole human plasma, but at a concentration above 200 \u03bcg/mL, it enhanced urokinase-induced fibrinolysis. The importance of dibenzo-1,4 dioxane skeleton for inhibition of plasmin inhibitors was shown by several derivatives of eckol [16]. As previously stated [120], only the dibenzo-1,4-dioxane skeleton (dibenzo-p-dioxin-1,3,6,8-tetraol) is important for the potent anti-inhibitor activity as compared to the other hydroxyl groups present in eckol. Hence, the results suggest that a simple dibenzo-1,4-dioxane skeleton with other functional groups could be clinically useful in stimulating fibrinolysis [16].",

A study designed to evaluate the combined activity of ampicillin and eckol against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Salmonella isolates revealed the antimicrobial activity of eckol towards all the tested strains. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of eckol towards S. aureus and Salmonella showed inhibition in a concentration-dependent manner, but all concentrations caused a reduction in CFUs over time, showing at least a 4 log10 decrease in the bacterial count after 4 h. Concentrations between 125 and 500 \u00b5g/mL showed bacteriostatic activity while that between 250 and 500 \u00b5g/mL inhibited the expansion of Salmonella for a period of 24 h.

High- performance liquid chromatography revealed both G-CA (4.72 mg/g) and J-CA (12.98 mg/g) to be rich in eckol.

Pancreatic lipase is involved in the absorption of triglycerides by the small intestine which eventually gets secreted by the pancreas. It is responsible for the hydrolysis of triglycerides into glycerol and fatty acids [130]. An investigation of a methanolic extract of E. bicyclis revealed significant inhibition on pancreatic lipase through porcine pancreatic lipase assay (IC50 value 36.4 \u00b1 2.9 mg/mL) leading to the isolation of eckol, fucofuroeckol A, 7-phloroeckol, dioxinodehydroeckol, phlorofucofuroeckol-A, and dieckol. Since eckol lacks ether linkage at the C-7 position of its phlorotannin skeleton, it exhibited much weaker activity against pancreatic lipase than fucofuroeckol A and 7-phloroeckol, having one phloroglucinol element in the same position. Also, the molecular weight difference between the compounds had no impact on their pancreatic lipase inhibitory activity. The existence of a phloroglucinol moiety in eckol structure at the C-7 position and the number of hydroxyl groups in eckol, fucofuroeckol A, and 7-phloroeckol might have positively influenced the inhibition of pancreatic lipase, probably through their unique receptor binding [79].

Eckol treatment effectively reduced the sphere formation, CD133+ cell population and concealed the expression of glioma stem-like cell markers and self-renewal-related proteins in the absence of cell death.The fusion of eckol with glioma stem-like cells diminished tumor formation and the anchorage-independent growth of cells on soft agar in xenograft mice. Eckol decreased the resistance of glioma stem-like cells to ionizing radiation and temozolomide. In addition, both the PI3K-Akt and Ras-Raf-1-Erk signaling pathways were blocked due to the eckol treatment in the glioma stem-like cell. Hence, eckol suppresses stemness and malignancies, and sensitizes glioma-stem-like cells to anticancer treatments, providing a novel therapeutic strategy specifically targeting these cells [75].",

Their inhibitory potential on the release of histamine was evaluated by their ability to inhibit immunoglobulin E (IgE) and anti-IgE antibodies stimulated degranulation of KU812 cells. Fucodiphloroethol G, eckol, and phlorofucofuroeckol-A displayed 23.97%, 44.26%, and 34.54% of relative histamine release, respectively, at the highest concentration (100 \u00b5M).

The molecular structure and amount of phenol groups could be the important factors for fucodiphloroethol G and phlorofucofuroeckol-A for showing strong activity than eckol. Also there was a potent inhibition of the binding activity between IgE and its receptor (30.58% and 34.23%) when treated with the highest concentration of fucodiphloroethol G and phlorofucofuroeckol-A, whereas eckol displayed less inhibiton (47.60%) in the flow cytometric analysis [73]. Thus, eckol from E. cava showed moderate antiallergic activity as compared to other compounds due to the structural differences amid the compounds in terms of the number of hydroxyl groups and the linkages among the phenol units, leading to different inhibitory activity.

            "text": "As outlined in the above review, eckol has been evaluated copiously for a broad spectrum of activities to establish it as a potential therapeutic agent. According to various experimental results, eckol possesses a wide array of therapeutic properties. Through various studies [42,43], eckol had been established as an antioxidant; however, the evidence of its usefulness in cell-based experiments is limited. Hence, the results of the cell-based experiments could act as future references for in vivo experiments to doubtlessly highlight antioxidant potential. Eckol has also shown promising results in diabetes suppression. Since diabetes is incurable and can only be suppressed over time, scientists are always on the verge of finding new compounds and pathways to cure this disease. As eckol has been evaluated for its role in the existing signaling pathways against diabetes, it would be interesting to see the effect of eckol on the newly discovered pathways other than the evaluated ones. Furthermore, eckol had contraindications for not being useful in hepatoprotection at the cellular level [92], while it showed hepatoprotective activity in an in vivo model [48]. The possible reason for this discrepancy could be different toxicity-inducing agents employed in those studies, where eckol was ineffective against tacrine-induced toxicity in human liver cell line but exhibited a protective effect against CCl4-induced toxicity in mice model. Hence, why eckol failed to protect the liver cell against tacrine-induced toxicity needs further detailed research to know the exact mechanism involved. In neuroprotection, the GABAA\u2013BZD receptor and dopamine receptors hold a good future for eckol due to its potent activity against these receptors [55,56]. The high activity of eckol in AChE enzyme inhibition but not in BChE inhibition [26] explains its selective nature, including moderate hMAO-B inhibition [53]. Although these enzyme inhibition effects displays its neuroprotective nature, cell-based and in vivo experiments are imperative to show its actual therpeutics. In several diseases requiring radiation therapy, including cancer, radioprotection is of the utmost importance. Although the in vivo experiments showed eckol as a radioprotector [62,63,64], there are still many complications and considerations while using it for human clinical trials, the correct dose of eckol required against the radiation being the utmost important part. Hence, these studies could be the references through which eckol could be further developed as a pharmaceutical product. Eckol showed a moderate protective role in skin cells against UV radiation [58,60] by scavenging ROS and reducing intracellular oxidative damage induced by UVB radiation. Further, the in vivo experiment [59] also supported eckol as a UV protector against skin carcinogenesis. Hence, eckol could be a potent UV protector in pharmaceuticals or cosmeceuticals. Regarding its anticoagulative property [16,120], the dibenzo-1,4-dioxane skeleton (dibenzo-p-dioxin-I,3,6,8-tetraol) of eckol seems to be one of the major factors involved in the anticoagulative effect which requires further investigation. Although eckol showed potent anticoagulative effect via thrombin activity inhibition, the activity was reduced in whole plasma [16] most probably due to the plasma\u2013protein binding affecting its efficacy. Hence, searching for alternatives to increase its bioavailability could be good future research. Similarly, the antithrombotic activity of eckol [77] also supports the possibility of developing eckol as an anticoagulant. The antihypertensive effect of eckol was attributed to ACE-inhibition, and the closed-ring dibenzo-1,4-dioxane was crucial for the inhibition [28]. Still in vivo study is a requisite for establishing eckol as a pharmaceutical product. Furthermore, following the success in characterizing eckol as an anticancer agent via in vitro cell-based studies [75,76], eckol could further be tested in vivo to establish its full potential against this life-threatening disease. Several contraindications of eckol being less active [19,73] or inactive [74] against the allergic symptoms are reported. The compounds (fucodiphloroethol G, phlorofucofuroeckol A, dieckol, 8,8\u2032-bieckol) other than eckol showed more potent activity, and all of them have the basic skeleton of eckol which could have a crucial role for antiallergic activity. So it is worth confirming the antiallergic property of eckol in vivo. In terms of the antiviral and antibacterial activity, eckol showed eminent results [29,67,124], but the production of proinflammatory cytokines in response to the antiviral activity of extract containing eckol was a contraindicatory point [67]. Even though the increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines may lead to inflammation, the subsequent basal expression levels of these cytokines after a significant increase in the early stage of an oral administration of extract indicate the immunomodulatory activity of the extract. Hence, the extract activated the anti-inflammatory response or suppressed the pro-inflammatory cytokines to control the extent of inflammatory condition. Eckol exhibiting a potent anti-inflammatory activity is a point to be noted, but the introduction of the dimers and isomers of eckol have surpassed the activity of eckol and have appeared to be more potent. Even though they are potent, the geometry of the aromatic ring and main configuration of the eckol skeleton is always critical for the suppressive property. The cell-based experiments related to tyrosinase inhibition by eckol could also be beneficial as future references for experiments on the living subjects. The potent anti-hyperlipidemic activity of eckol compared to probucol [81] and the suppression of high lipid levels in serum of hyperlipidemic rats [80] could be evidence to develop it as a pharmaceutical agent against hyperlipidemia. The anti-hair loss [149] and anti-hearing loss [150] activities of eckol show that it still holds potential in several unidentified fields other than ones that are stated in this review. Hence, a continuous evaluation of eckol in the future is important to increase its spectrum of activity.",

            "text": "Numerous efforts to establish natural biomarkers for the treatment of various ailments have improved our understanding of their functions and activity. Considering the diversity of natural biomarkers such as eckol, a definite push is required to further decode these kinds of compounds for their proper use. Eckol exhibiting several biological activities is extraordinary, particularly the involvement of eckol as an anti-oxidant, anti-diabetic, radioprotective, hepatoprotective, and anti-inflammatory agent to name some. The use of eckol as anti-hair loss and anti-hearing loss is a refreshing new discovery. Increasing the scope of eckol as a neuroprotective agent by evaluating it against G protein coupled dopamine receptors is also a novel exploration for the treatment of major neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s disease. Thus, introducing eckol to various new receptors related to different diseases, other than the usual ones, could be of great interest. Since eckol exhibits activity against life-threatening disease like cancer, further research in this particular field also holds great potential for eckol to be established as an anti-cancer agent. The major reason for the broad spectrum of activity related to eckol is possibly due to its structure. Even the other potent phlorotannins of the same family have a basic backbone of eckol. So, developing eckol as a single pharmaceutical product could be beneficial in the field of medicine. Hence, natural product-derived compounds hold a multitude of opportunities for the discovery of novel therapeutic agents. The shift in focus from synthetically developed agents to natural agents could be a stepping stone for further advancements in the treatment of various infirmities. In conclusion, these kinds of naturally derived drugs have immense potential for advancement in the pharmaceutical and medical fields, leading to a definite change in views.",
