Patients presenting signs of ARI and/or IL had airway secretion collected in a 72hs period, by combined nasal and pharyngeal swab, and viruses detection was performed using real time PCR (qPCR). 44 JIA patients aged 2 to 18 years received trivalent split Flu vaccine A/Solomon Islands/3/2006, H1N1; A/Brisbane/10/200, H3N2; B/Florida/2006 (Sanofi Pasteur SA/ Butantan Institute) in 2008. Thirty-one of the patients (70%) were on MTX or leflunomide and 5 (11%) were on anti-TNF drugs at the time of vaccination. Clinical and laboratory evaluation, including ACRPed30 were performed during the surveillance period, before and after vaccination. Flu titers were determined by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay before and 30-40 days after vaccination. Immune response was defined by seroconversion (a 4-fold or greater rise in HI antibodies) and seroprotection (HI titers at least 1:40).",

Virus co-infections were detected in 15% of the positive samples. During the same period, 49 JIA flares were observed and 8 (16%) had a temporal relationship with ARI without any other plausible cause that may have triggered the events. Seroprotection rates after vaccination were higher than 70% (91-100%) for all 3 Flu strains and seroconversion rates exceeded 40% (74-93%). In general, response to Flu vaccine was not influenced by therapeutic regimens or disease activity, but patients using anti-TNF\u03b1 drugs presented lower response to H1N1 strain. No significant differences were found in JIA activity index (ACRPed30) after vaccination and no patient reported IL symptoms during the 6-month post-vaccine period.",
