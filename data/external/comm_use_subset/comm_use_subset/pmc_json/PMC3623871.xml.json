Massive mortality of Portuguese oysters, Crassostrea angulata, in French stocks from 1967 to 1973 was associated with irido-like virus infections [1,2]. Other viruses infecting molluscs were interpreted as being members of the families Togaviridae, Retroviridae, Reoviridae, Birnaviridae or Picornaviridae[3-9]. Disseminated neoplasia, which was a proliferative cell disorder of the circulatory system in bivalves, was linked to the retroviral infections [10]. However, mollusc virology is still in its infancy and is based largely on morphological features because relevant biological and molecular tools are scarce.",

They were classified into the families Alloherpesviridae, Herpesviridae and Malacoherpesviridae in the order Herpesvirales[11]. The genomes of herpesvirus have been accumulating since the 1980s, and sixty-eight isolated from different species have been deposited in GenBank to date. These genomes have been interpreted to give detailed views of ubiquitous and lineage-specific functions. Herpesviruses and herpes-like viruses have also been attracted particular attention because of their ecological and economic impact on wild and cultured marine molluscs during the last 20 years, and several were reported worldwide [12-27]. The term herpes-like virus tends to be used when a virus has been characterized exclusively on the basis of morphological features. One herpesvirus that infects Pacific oysters, Crassostrea gigas, in France, has been fully characterized on both morphological and molecular basis. This virus was named ostreid herpesvirus 1 and was classified as the founding member of the species Ostreid herpesvirus 1, genus Ostreavirus, family Malacoherpesviridae[11,25]. Although OsHV-1 was first described in the larvae of Pacific oysters in France, further studies have demonstrated that it was able to infect other bivalve species, including Manila clam, Ruditapes philippinarum[27], and French scallop, Pecten maximus[28]. Recently, a distinct OsHV-1 genotype (OsHV-1 \u03bcVar) has been also reported in association with massive mortality in Pacific oysters in France [29].",

The disease has occurred annually in summer and mortality reaches more than 90% within 5\u20138 days after first appearance [30,31]. The causative agent was determined to be a virus and was named acute viral necrosis virus (AVNV) [32,33]. According to the previous data, AVNV seems to be related to OsHV-1 based on morphology [33,34], histopathological features such as basophilic inclusions and cellular changes [34,35], and epidemiological aspects [36]. Therefore, based on the published OsHV-1 DNA sequences as a template, we have sequenced the complete genome of AVNV and have carried out the comparative analysis.",

The results showed that these three AVNV fragments were 99%, 97% and 99% identical to OsHV-1, respectively (data not shown), thus indicating that the DNA sequences of these two viruses may be generally highly similar.

We resolved the sequence of this region in AVNV by using the method described by Weller et al.[38].

The ORFs on the upper (R) and lower (L) DNA strands (53% lower, 47% upper) were numbered following the OsHV-1 nomenclature (Additional file 1: Table S1) and a diagrammatic representation of their arrangement was shown in Figure 1. The proportion of the genome encoding ORFs was about 82%, which was similar to that of OsHV-1 (84%). The average length of AVNV ORFs was 1,260 bp, which was marginally smaller than that of OsHV-1 (1,272 bp). Five pairs of overlapping ORFs were found in the AVNV genome, including ORF56 and ORF57, ORF71 and ORF72, ORF81 and ORF82, ORF92 and ORF93, and ORF94 and ORF95 (Figure 1), with the overlapping regions being 8\u2013251 bp in size. ORF28 and ORF29 overlapped by 125 bp in OsHV-1 [25] but are present as a single ORF 28 in AVNV (Additional file 1: Table S1).",

Therefore, we compared the genome sequence of AVNV with that of OsHV-1. The results showed that AVNV was similar to OsHV-1 in genome organization, DNA sequences and ORF layout (Figure 1). The majority of AVNV ORFs were closely matched in size and orientation with their OsHV-1 counterparts, with identities from 94% to 100% (Additional file 1: Table S1). The AVNV and OsHV-1 DNA sequences were also very similar, exhibiting about 97% identity overall. However, there were several obvious insertions and deletions between the two genomes, the most notable being located in the AVNV genome at positions 1,500-1,700, 60,700-63,350, 183,900-184,100, 187,300-190,300, 192,800-195,100, 203,000-205,100 and 207,800-210,700.

The major deletion consisted of five copies of a trinucleotide repeat (CTA) that was described previously as being a microsatellite region [29]. This trinucleotide was repeated three times in AVNV and eight times in OsHV-1 (Figure 2). Compared to OsHV-1, there were also two deletions of A residues in AVNV at positions 244 and 395, an insertion of an A residue at position 283, and two synonymous substitutions in ORF4 at positions 411 and 516 (both C to T changes).",

For ORF88, encoding a putative glycoprotein [25,28], the modification of GTG (V, valine) to GCG (A, alanine) in AVNV was also reported in an OsHV-1 variant from French scallops by using the Gp3/Gp4 PCR primers to amplify a part of the ORF [28]. It is possible that the polymorphisms in this region might reflect the host-specific, and this needs further investigation. Nevertheless, the fact that OsHV-1 has more than one host species is different to the situation for most vertebrate herpesviruses, which are thought to have co-evolved or adapted in association with single host species, although exceptions have been described [40,51]. Upon successful transmission to new host species, viruses usually adapt quickly to the changed immunological environment [52]. One of the mechanisms of adaptation involves amino acid changes, in particular in proteins that may facilitate transmission [53]. Indeed, a number of proteins have been implicated in determining host specificity for various viruses [54]. For instance subtypes of influenza A virus may be distinguished by two surface glycoproteins, and amino acid substitutions may alter receptor binding to permit transmission from humans to birds [55,56].",

One region located at 60,700-63,350 bp in AVNV is particularly unusual in bearing a large insertion of 2.6 kb compared to the OsHV-1 genome. Several OsHV-1 genotypes have also been described in oysters, scallops and clams based on analysis of various genome regions [27-29,50,57]. The finding that OsHV-1 specimens collected from different locations may have similar DNA sequences [50,57], whereas others collected from the same place showed different genotypes [29], suggests that particular genotypes may be not distributed geographically. More work on genome sequences analysis of different OsHV-1 genotypes would be useful in defining additionally diagnostic polymorphisms. Moreover, sequencing more OsHV-1 strains from different locations and host species may help to elucidate the biological and pathogenic associations of the various genotypes.",

As the sequences of OsHV-1 were highly similar in AVNV, a total of 62 PCR primer pairs were designed based on the OsHV-1 genome sequence (GenBank accession AY509253) and used to amplify overlapping AVNV DNA fragments (from 600 to 5000 bp). The AVNV genome termini were identified using the method described by Davison et al. [25,45]. Briefly, AVNV DNA was treated with T4 DNA polymerase in the presence of the four dNTPs to produce flush ends, and ligated into the partially double-stranded adaptor (the cDNA adaptor in the Clontech Marathon kit). PCR was carried out using an adaptor-specific primer plus a primer specific for the left or right terminal region of the genome (5\u2019-CACGGTGGGAAGGCTGAT-3\u2019 or 5\u2019-GATAGGAGGTTAGACACGC-3\u2019 and Ex Taq polymerase (Takara). The products were purified using a TaKaRa gel purification kit (Takara), and inserted into pGEM-T (Promega, USA). The cloned fragments were sequenced in both directions using universal primers and an ABI PRISM 3770 (Applied Biosystems, Inc., USA). Additional primers (236 in total) were designed for sequencing the internal regions of longer PCR products (>1200 bp). At least three individual clones were sequenced for each fragment in order to exclude potential mutations generated by PCR.",
