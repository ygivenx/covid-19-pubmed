Analysis of antibody isotypes specific for A\u03b2 showed that Alhydrogel\u00ae, AdvaxTM, Montanide-ISA51 and -ISA720 adjuvants induced primarily an IgG1 (Th2) response, whereas AdvaxCpG, MPLA and Quil-A shifted the response toward IgG2ab, a Th1 response associated isotype (Figs 1b and S1). To further explore adjuvant effects on Th1 and Th2 phenotype, we measured the numbers of splenocytes producing IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 cytokines by ELISpot (spot-forming cells, SFC) and found that the AdvaxCpG group produced significantly higher frequencies of IFN-\u03b3+ and IL-4+ Th cells than the other adjuvant groups (Fig. 2a,b). The TLR4 agonist, MPLA was the only other GMP-grade adjuvant that generated significant numbers of both IFN-\u03b3+ and IL-4+ Th cells, although these were approximately 5 and 1.5 times, respectively, lower than those induced with AdvaxCpG (Fig. 2a,b). Calculation of the ratio of IL-4/IFN-\u03b3 positive Th cells (Fig. 2c) supported the antibody isotypes data and confirmed that AdvaxCpG was the strongest combined Th1 and Th2 adjuvant followed by MPLA, while other adjuvants only generated primarily Th2 responses to immunizations with AV-1959R. The level of Th1 responses induced by the control adjuvant, Quil-A were comparable to MPLA, but significantly lower than in AdvaxCpG (Figs 1 and 2). Finally, AdvaxCpG was also well tolerated by all animals with no evidence of either local or systemic vaccine adverse reactions. On the basis of these data, AdvaxCpG was selected as the sole adjuvant for all subsequent studies with MultiTEP-based AD vaccines targeting A\u03b2, tau, or A\u03b2/tau simultaneously or sequentially.",

Of note, no potentially harmful autoreactive Th cells were detected after re-stimulation of immune splenocytes with A\u03b2 or tau self-epitopes, either by ELISpot or splenocytes proliferation assay (data not shown). Importantly, generation of strong cellular immune responses to Th epitopes incorporated in the MultiTEP vaccine platform supported the production of equally high concentrations of anti-A\u03b2 antibodies in mice vaccinated with AV1959R/AV-1980R combination, AV-1959R, or AV-1953R. As expected, immunization with AV-1980R did not generate anti-A\u03b2 antibodies (Fig. 4a). It should be mentioned that concentrations of anti-tau antibodies were significantly lower in mice immunized with AV-1953R compared to mice vaccinated with the AV-1959R/AV-1980R combination or AV-1980R alone (Fig. 4b). These antibody response patterns were mirrored by the frequency of antibody secreting B cells (ASC); numbers of anti-A\u03b2 ASC were similar in mice immunized with single or combined vaccine formulations, while the numbers of anti-tau ASC were significantly lower in mice vaccinated with the dual-epitope AV-1953R vaccine (Fig. 5).",

To address this possibility we undertook in silico structural modeling of the MultiTEP platform-based AV-1980R, AV-1959R and AV-1953R vaccines to examine the surface accessibility of B cell antigenic determinants of A\u03b21-11 (EFRH)26 in AV-1959R and AV-1953R and Tau2-18 (PRQEF; paper in preparation) in AV1980R and AV-1953R (Fig. 6). The modeling data suggested that on AV-1980R, two of three tau epitopes are linear with the side chains of the critical amino acid residues accessible on the surface (Fig. 6a,d), while in AV-1959R, all three A\u03b2 epitopes are linear with the side chains of the critical amino acid residues accessible on the surface (Fig. 6b,e). On AV-1953R, two out of three A\u03b2 and two out of three tau epitopes are linear, however, only side chains of A\u03b2, but not critical tau amino acid residues are easily accessible (Fig. 6c,f). Hence, changes in the epitope structure in combination with alterations in the side chain accessibility of critical residues in the epitopes may have led to the reduced anti-tau immunogenicity of the AV-1953R dual-epitope construct.",

As expected, AV-1980R-immune sera recognized monomeric tau as well as multiple larger and smaller species of tau in both soluble and insoluble fractions of brain homogenates. What is more important, antibodies generated by either the mixture of vaccines (AV-1959R/AV-1980R) or the dual vaccine (AV-1953R) recognized the same species of A\u03b2 and tau that were detected by antisera isolated from mice vaccinated with appropriate single vaccines (AV-1959R and AV-1980R). Similar results have been obtained by IHC analyses of the same brain tissues (Fig. 7c). AV-1959R-immune sera bound senile plaques only, AV-1980R-immunie sera bound NFTs and neuritic threads, yet sera from mice immunized with AV-1959R/AV-1980R mixture or AV-1953R bound both pathologies: plaques, neuritic threads and NFTs. Therefore, both mixture of MultiTEP-platform based vaccines and the dual vaccine could be an effective active immunotherapeutic strategy for targeting both misfolded proteins involved in AD pathology.",

At the initiation of anti-tau immunotherapy AD patient immunized previously with anti-A\u03b2 vaccine would have large numbers of MultiTEP-specific memory Th cells and hence will rapidly generate therapeutic concentrations of antibodies. To simulate this situation, we immunized mice with AV-1959R formulated in AdvaxCpG or injected with AdvaxCpG only (control) and both groups were boosted with vaccine targeting tau B cell epitope, AV-1980R. Boosting of AV-1959R vaccinated mice with AV-1980R, but not sham-injected mice, induced significantly higher cellular (Fig. 8a) and humoral (Fig. 8b) immune responses, thus proving the synergistic effect of sequential immunization with different MultiTEP vaccines.",

            "text": "AD is the most common cause of dementia, and worldwide nearly 46 million people have Alzheimer\u2019s or related dementias and this number is estimated to increase to 131.5 million by 205027. Currently, the majority of neuroscientists agree that the optimal targets for AD immunotherapy are pathological forms of A\u03b2 and tau. The relationship between these molecules in progression of AD pathology is still controversial, with the majority of data supporting A\u03b2 aggregation being the primary event in AD pathogenesis, secondarily triggering production of pathological tau282930313233. Nonetheless, accumulation of pathological tau in the brains correlates with dementia in AD patients. Thus, by the time clinical symptoms appear, there is already substantial tau pathology in the brains3435. Therefore, we propose that anti-A\u03b2 immunotherapy should be initiated at the early stages of AD to minimize synaptic and neuronal loss, while anti-tau immunotherapy may be most effective when disease progression is more advanced33. Thus we have decided to generate vaccines that will target pathological molecules either sequentially (e.g. A\u03b2 vaccinations followed by tau vaccination) or simultaneously (mixture of A\u03b2 plus tau vaccines, or dual-epitope vaccine containing both A\u03b2 and tau B cell epitopes). Importantly, although clinical data from anti-tau immunotherapy are not currently available, results from anti-A\u03b2 active and passive vaccination trials suggest that only relatively high concentrations of antibodies are therapeutically potent93031323336. Therefore, to enhance immune response in elderly patients with immunosenescence37 we have developed recombinant protein-based A\u03b2 and tau, or dual-epitope vaccines by fusing relevant epitopes of these pathological proteins with our MultiTEP platform which is composed of 12 foreign Th cell epitopes, which are the promiscuous PADRE epitope, epitopes from Tetanus Toxin (P23, P32, P21, P30, P2, P7, P17 and P28), Hepatitis B (HBVnc & HBsAg), and influenza virus (MT)10. We hypothesized that this should provide a broad coverage of human MHC class II polymorphism utilizing the wide array of tetanus toxin, hepatitis B and influenza Th epitopes incorporated into the MultiTEP platform. We have previously shown that MultiTEP platform-based DNA vaccine targeting A\u03b21-11 was immunogenic in mice, rabbits, and in monkeys with highly polymorphic MHC class II genes10111213. Here we further suggested that the same MultiTEP platform used for two different recombinant protein-based vaccines targeting A\u03b2 and tau could be beneficial because Th cells activated by AV-1959R will generate strong Th memory cells and will facilitate rapid production of anti-tau antibodies in the future vaccination/s of the same organism with the anti-tau vaccine, AV-1980R. In this study we report for the first time on the immunogenicity of vaccines targeting A\u03b2, tau or both pathological molecules simultaneously or sequentially.",

Thus, the first aim of this study was to identify an optimal adjuvant for use in future AD vaccine trials. Figures 1 and 2 clearly demonstrate that AdvaxCpG formulated with AV-1959R vaccine provided significantly higher Th cell and anti-A\u03b2 antibody responses than any other adjuvant approved for human use or tested in clinical trials. Moreover, AdvaxCpG enhanced both Th2 and Th1 immune responses as reflected by the highest induction of not only IgG1, but also IgG2ab antibody isotype. Antibodies of the IgG2ab isotype exhibit the highest level of Fc effector function, which may provide the utmost efficiency in AD immunotherapy39, and the acute pro-inflammatory responses (IFN-\u03b3+SFC) generated by AV-1959R formulated with AdvaxCpG could be beneficial for AD treatment as well, since TLR4 agonist MPLA reduced A\u03b2 load in the brain of mice and enhanced cognitive function40. Finally, MultiTEP-based vaccine design is anticipated to be safe, because Th epitopes in this platform are all foreign and are not expressed in the brain.",

            "text": "As mentioned above, the difference in the timing of A\u03b2 and tau accumulation34 and their different roles in the onset and progression of AD, suggest that sequential vaccinations with A\u03b2 and tau vaccines, or even combined vaccine against both molecules might represent the most effective AD approach. In particular, the same vaccine platform could be used to both prevent the onset of AD41424344, and also slow down development of tauopathy-associated dementia3245464748495051. In order to utilize such an approach we have developed three MultiTEP platform-based vaccines targeting A\u03b2, tau or both molecules simultaneously. All MultiTEP-based vaccines formulated with AdvaxCpG induce strong cellular and humoral (concentrations of antibody and numbers of ASC) immune responses (Figs 4 and 5). Co-immunizations with AV-1959R and AV-1980R vaccines provided high antibody titers against A\u03b2 and tau epitopes, respectively and these humoral immune responses did not differ from results of immunization with single AV-1980R or AV-1959R vaccines. However, the AV-1953R dual vaccine demonstrated significantly decreased anti-tau humoral immune responses compared with mice immunized with AV-1980R or a mixture of AV-1980R and AV-1959R vaccines (Figs 4 and 5). These decreases in antibody titers and numbers of ASC were not associated with insufficient Th cell stimulation by AV-1953R vs AV-1980R/AV-1959R, since the Th cell responses did not differ significantly between these groups (Fig. 3). This suggested that the three copies of tau2-18 B cell epitope in the MultiTEP vaccine might not be adequately presented on the surface of the folded AV-1953R or AV-1980R protein. In the absence of crystal structures, we performed an in silico approach to create structural models of the MultiTEP-based proteins that were further optimized using molecular dynamic simulation. From the 3D in silico models of these vaccines it appears that tau2-18 epitopes may have a less optimal presentation on the surface of AV-1953R dual vaccine than on the AV-1980R single one (Fig. 6). These subtle differences in the structural configuration may have played a critical role in the observed differences in the antibody titers and ASC numbers. Another possible reason could be B cell immunodominance of the A\u03b2 epitope which may suppress the maturation of tau-specific B cells by competition for antigen-specific Th cells. However, this was not the case when immunization was performed with a mixture of the two vaccines containing the same Th epitopes (Fig. 5). In addition, we have performed experiments with increased doses of AV-1953R and did not see an increase of anti-tau antibody concentrations too (data not shown).",

Mice primed by AV-1959R responded significantly better to the booster vaccination with AV-1980R (Fig. 8a,b). Importantly, regardless of the vaccine used (single, mixture or dual), the generated antibodies are potentially functional and bind equally well to the pathological deposits of A\u03b2 and tau in the brain sections from four AD cases (Fig. 7). It is important to note, that antibodies were effectively binding oligomeric forms of A\u03b2 and tau, which are widely believed to be much more toxic than the fibrils and plaques52.",

The MultiTEP strategy provides a unique opportunity to generate high antibody responses in subjects by utilizing memory Th cells previously generated in the human population in response to infection or vaccination by tetanus toxin, hepatitis B and influenza. The MultiTEP platform may be especially beneficial in the elderly because the vaccine utilizes memory T cells that are in abundance in elderly patients instead of relying on activation of na\u00efve T cells, which decline with age. Therefore, the universal and highly immunogenic MultiTEP vaccine platform shows promise for both preventive and therapeutic approaches in AD.",
