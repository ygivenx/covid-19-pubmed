            "text": "Autophagy is an umbrella term for a broad family of trafficking pathways that transport cytoplasmic material to the lysosome for destruction. Its most studied form, macroautophagy (hereafter \u201cautophagy\u201d), involves the formation of a double-membrane vesicle (the autophagosome) that sequesters cytoplasm and delivers it to the lysosome by vesicle fusion. The first factors identified in autophagosome biogenesis, the so-called autophagy-related (ATG) factors, were originally identified by genetic screens in yeast [1\u20133]. This list eventually matured to its current state that includes approximately 40 yeast ATGs and distinguishes \u201ccore\u201d factors required for all forms of autophagy from those required only for specific substrates (e.g., a damaged mitochondrion) [4]. The inventory of factors involved in autophagy has been further expanded by the discovery of additional autophagy factors not found in yeast, such as ATG101, EPG5, and vacuole membrane protein 1 (VMP1) [5\u20138]. Whether additional autophagy factors have yet to be discovered remains an open question.",

Initiation involves construction of a cup-shaped precursor membrane (the phagophore) in close apposition to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [9\u201313]. This process is dependent on the RB1 inducible Coiled-Coil 1 (RB1CC1) scaffolding protein and post-Golgi vesicles containing ATG9A [14\u201316]. Next, recruitment of an autophagy-specific phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) complex results in localized phosphatidylinositol-3 phosphate (PI3P) formation and recruitment of PI3P effectors such as WD repeat domain, phosphoinositide interacting 2 (WIPI2) [17,18]. Nascent phagophores are then elongated concurrent with lipid conjugation of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B (LC3) family proteins (autophagy-related protein 8 [Atg8] in yeast), although the requirement for LC3 lipidation has recently been challenged [19\u201321].",

Interactions between cargos, receptors, and lipidated LC3 leads to their mutual capture by autophagosomes and subsequent lysosomal destruction. This feature of LC3 has been exploited to establish the most widely used reporter of autophagic flux: tandem-fluorescent (tf) LC3 (tfLC3). In this approach, 2 fluorescent protein tags (red fluorescent protein [RFP] and green fluorescent protein [GFP]) are appended to the amino terminus of LC3. Upon lysosomal delivery of tfLC3, low pH conditions within the lysosomal lumen selectively quench GFP fluorescence, resulting in a dramatic increase in the observed Red:Green fluorescence ratio [23,24]. In a similar manner, tf sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1) has been used to measure the flux of this heavily studied autophagy receptor [24].",

With this expanded toolkit in hand, we performed genome-wide clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR) screens to identify selective autophagy factors in mammalian cells. We recovered virtually all known ATG factors and uncovered several uncharacterized proteins for further study. We validated our list using quantitative cell microscopy and biochemical analyses to define transmembrane protein 41B (TMEM41B) as an integral ER membrane protein that is required for phagophore maturation in higher eukaryotes. TMEM41B shares a broadly conserved transmembrane domain (pfam09335) with an established autophagy factor, VMP1, and our data show that these 2 factors play related, though not fully overlapping, roles in autophagosome biogenesis.",

To devise a general strategy for monitoring autophagic flux in K562 cells, we began by constructing 6 homologous gene cassettes: 1 (tfLC3) encoding an N-terminal, tf (RFP-GFP) fusion with LC3B, 4 (tfSQSTM1, tfNDP52, tfTAX1BP1, and tfNBR1) with N-terminal fusions to SQSTM1-related autophagy receptors, and 1 (tfEmpty) as a negative control (S1A Fig). The RFP to GFP fluorescence ratio (Red:Green ratio) of tfLC3 is a widely used metric for autophagic flux predicated on the selective quenching of GFP in low pH environments, such as the lysosomal lumen (Fig 1A). Following cassette integration at the adeno-associated virus integration site 1 (AAVS1) locus, we analyzed cells by flow cytometry under basal conditions and following treatment with either Bafilomycin A1 (BafA1), an inhibitor of autophagosome\u2013lysosome fusion, or torin, a small-molecule inducer of autophagy. Corresponding changes in the observed Red:Green ratio of tfLC3 and tfReceptors provided strong evidence for both basal and induced autophagy in K562 cells (Fig 1B). By contrast, the Red:Green ratio of tfEmpty cells was unresponsive to either drug treatment, arguing that nonselective reporter engulfment makes a negligible contribution to our flux measurements. We obtained similar results using adherent human embryonic kidney HEK293T cells (S1B Fig). Furthermore, we confirmed that torin-induced increases in Red:Green ratio were due to selective GFP quenching (S1C Fig) and that both basal and induced autophagy were dependent on the known autophagy-related factors RB1CC1 and ATG13 (S1D and S1E Fig). Collectively, these data validated a broad panel of autophagic flux reporters for subsequent use as genetic screening tools in K562 cells.",

Read counts of sgRNAs derived from these cell fractions were obtained by Illumina sequencing and computationally analyzed by model-based analysis of genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout (MAGeCK) [26,27].

To examine these hits further, we retested them as individual sgRNAs alongside a broad panel of known ATG factors (Fig 3A; S2A\u2013S2D Fig). Indeed, the vast majority of individual sgRNAs increased or decreased flux proportionate to their beta score ranking (compare Fig 3B and Fig 2B). By contrast, we found that sgRNAs targeting uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) were spurious hits that modified the Red:Green ratio by drastically enhancing RFP fluorescence (S2E Fig). We also confirmed that tfNBR1 flux in K562 cells was largely independent of ATG factors required for LC3 lipidation (e.g., ATG7), which agrees with our original screen findings (Fig 3B). ATG7-independent autophagosome formation has been reported in other cell types, and our work suggests that NBR1 might provide a useful new marker for further dissecting this process [28\u201330]. In sum, our genetic screening strategy and hit validation robustly uncovered known ATG factors and unveiled new candidates for further study.",

Two complementary measures of autophagic flux further support this interpretation. First, treatment of TMEM41BKO cells with BafA1 was unable to induce further accumulation of lipidated LC3 (LC3-II) (Fig 4B). Second, tfLC3 and tfSQSTM1 flux were strongly repressed in TMEM41BKO cells, comparable to ATG7KO control cells (S3F and S3G Fig).

To define the stage of autophagosome formation that is arrested in TMEM41BKO cells, we used a series of complementary approaches to systematically probe the autophagosome biogenesis pathway. The accumulation of lipidated LC3 in TMEM41BKO cells is inconsistent with an initiation defect (Fig 4A). To further support this view, we analyzed the kinase activity of Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1), a component of the RB1CC1 complex that regulates phagophore nucleation [33]. Upon autophagy induction, ULK1 phosphorylates numerous substrates including ATG13. Consequently, the phosphorylation of serine-318 (p-S318) in ATG13 can serve as a proxy for ULK1 activity [34,35]. We found that activation of autophagy by torin stimulated the appearance of p-S318 comparably in wild-type and TMEM41BKO cells (S4A Fig). For comparison, this assay robustly detected loss of ULK1 activity in cells lacking RB1CC1, a known ULK1 kinase coactivator (S4A Fig).

As expected, in wild-type extracts, the autophagy receptor NDP52 was protease resistant until membranes were solubilized with Triton X-100 (a nonionic detergent). By contrast, NDP52 was protease sensitive in native extracts derived from TMEM41BKO cells and RB1CC1KO control cells, consistent with a failure to properly form completed autophagosomes (Fig 5B).

To examine this possibility, we looked for increased association of certain ATG factors with ER membranes in the absence of TMEM41B, a hallmark of arrested autophagosome biogenesis in VMP1KO cells [41]. Indeed, following differential centrifugation of cell lysates (Fig 8A), we observed a shift in the migration of WIPI2, RB1CC1, and ATG9A from the high-speed pellet (p100) to lower-speed pellets containing ER-derived membranes (p3 and p20) in both VMP1KO and TMEM41BKO cells (Fig 8B). Importantly, we could suppress this effect on WIPI2 and ATG9A fractionation in TMEM41BKO cells by genetically ablating RB1CC1, highlighting that this is an autophagy-dependent effect.",

Both tfTMEM41B and tfVMP1 (approximately 15-fold over-expressed [S7B Fig]) complemented TMEM41BKO phenotypes (Fig 8C\u20138E). By contrast, only tfVMP1 was able to suppress VMP1KO phenotypes.

Consistent with the results herein, both observed similarities between TMEM41B and VMP1 deletions. On the basis of these phenotypic similarities, one immediate hypothesis is that TMEM41B and VMP1 function as a complex. Indeed, Morita and colleagues were able to isolate a VMP1/TMEM41B-containing co-complex in the presence of n-dodecyl-\u03b2-D-maltoside/cholesteryl hemisuccinate (DDM/CHS) [53], although such a complex was not observed in other detergents [54,55]. It remains an important future goal to establish whether TMEM41B\u2019s function is dependent on its interaction with VMP1. A potential clue comes from studies of DedA proteins in Escherichia coli, which share pfam09335 with TMEM41B and VMP1 [56] and are distantly related to bacterial LeuT transporters [57]. E. coli cells lacking the DedA homologs YqjA and YghB have a defect in proton import that can be rescued by overexpressing a Na+/K+-H+ antiporter [58,59]. Future biochemical and structural studies of VMP1 and TMEM41B will provide new tools for testing their potentially conserved role in ion homeostasis.",

These include novel inducers of autophagy, receptor-specific modulators, and additional putative ATG factors. Vacuolar protein sorting 37 homolog A (VPS37A) and VPS25 are 2 factors in the latter category known to assemble into endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT). ESCRT components have long been implicated in autophagy and may function at several steps during autophagosome biogenesis, as well as during autophagosome\u2013endolysosomal fusion [66,67]. Many ESCRT components are required for cell division, which complicates analysis of their mutant phenotypes. By contrast, VPS37A is nonessential and offers a potential future handle for further dissecting the mechanistic details of ESCRT\u2019s role in mammalian autophagy.",

First, regions of images containing cells were identified. To do so, we first fit a Gaussian distribution to the fluorescence intensity distribution for a smoothed green channel (488 nm excitation) z-stack from an empty field. Using this Gaussian fit, we predicted the probability that each pixel in the smoothed green channel z-stack for each field corresponded to background (noncell) or foreground (cell). We assigned each pixel with a p(background) < 10\u22125 to the cells, thus creating a \u201ccell mask.\u201d After removing small specks (<100,000 pixels volume) to eliminate debris, we removed out-of-focus planes from the cell mask using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier as described previously [71]. Next, nuclei were segmented from the blue (DAPI) channel by slice-by-slice relative thresholding followed by watershed segmentation using the pyto_segmenter package. Cells were segmented using watershed segmentation from nuclei seeds. Cell edges were eroded to eliminate blurred edge excess included during the p-value transformation. Cells contacting the edge of the field were removed from analysis. Next, punctae were segmented in the green and red (561 nm) channels using the pyto_segmenter package with empirically determined Canny edge detection thresholds. The number of total punctae and punctae overlapping with objects in the other fluorescence channel were counted, and tabulated data were saved in .csv format. Plotting was performed using R and the ggplot2 package. See the image analysis package for details.

The top and bottom third of cells were collected based on Red:Green ratio. sgRNA sequences from collected cells were obtained by Illumina sequencing and analyzed by MAGeCK. (B) Shown is a heat map of averaged beta scores (similar to fold-enrichment) for the indicated sgRNAs. Scores are color coded based on the effect of the indicated sgRNA (red, sgRNA suppresses autophagy; blue, sgRNA enhances autophagy). For comparison, known ATG factors (regardless of effect size) are presented alongside novel hits. Genes are clustered loosely based on their known function. sgRNAs listed under \u201cother\u201d (e.g., TMEM41B) were chosen from targets whose beta scores placed them in the top approximately 50 hits for 1 or more reporters. sgRNAs listed under \u201cenhancer sgRNAs\u201d target the 6 genes that scored better than the highest-scoring known autophagy regulator, MLST8. Underlying read counts and beta scores are presented in S2 Data and S3 Data, respectively. An interactive interface for data is also available online at http://crispr.deniclab.com.

Cells were pretreated with torin to maximize the dynamic range of tfSQSTM1 signal and analyzed by flow cytometry (n > 5,000 cells). Shown are violin plots generated in R using ggplot2. Median values for each sample are identified by a black line. Bimodal populations were deconvolved in an unbiased manner using the BifurGate function of FlowJo. The black dotted line across all samples corresponds to the Red:Green ratio of unaffected cells (i.e., negative ctl 1). The red dotted line across all samples corresponds to the ratio observed under maximally inhibited conditions (sgATG9A). See S2A\u2013S2D Fig for similar data from the remaining tfReporters. (B) Heat map indicating the phenotypic strengths of indicated gene knockouts derived from the primary data in part A and S2A\u2013S2D Fig. The median Red:Green ratio of each population was used to calculate the fold repression according to the following formula: (ratiosgGene \u2212 ratiosgATG9A) \u00f7 (ratiosgControl \u2212 ratiosgATG9A), with the assumption that sgATG9A yields a true autophagy-null phenotype.
