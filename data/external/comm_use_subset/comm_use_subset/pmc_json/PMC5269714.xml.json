The other seven cases were URTI patients, four of whom were also infected with influenza viruses (IFVs), two with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and one with EV.

Three of the four HRV-A21-positive CAP inpatients had serially collected respiratory samples, and all were positive for HRV-A21.

Seven samples of HRV-A in the URTI patients could not be genotyped precisely (Table 1). The detection rate of HRV-A21 was higher in the severe CAP patients (7.9%, n = 3) than in the non-severe CAP (0.9%, n = 1) or the URTI patients (1.7%, n = 5) (P = 0.047 by Fisher\u2019s exact test). Taken together, these data show that prevalence of HRV-A21 correlates with a spectrum of illness from mild URTIs to severe CAP. Unexpectedly, HRV-A21 was most frequency (9 of 42, 21.4%) detected as the only pathogen present in an infection among the identified HRV genotypes. As only three genome sequences of HRV-A21 were available in GenBank and little was reported on its clinical manifestation, we focused on the characterization of A21 infections.",

Moreover, HRV-A21 was the most frequently detected strain among all HRV genotypes detected. HRV-A21 was more frequently detected in patients with severe CAP than in those with non-severe CAP and URTIs. Further analysis showed that the HRV-A21 detected in this study was distinct from the only three strains of HRV previously identified by phylogenic analysis, as demonstrated by the neutralization assay, during which one isolate obtained in this study could not be neutralized by the antiserum against the prototype strain.

For this purpose, we used only lower, not upper, respiratory samples to avoid the interference of mass microbial species, which can be carried in the upper respiratory tract. The data demonstrated that HRV-A21 reads were predominantly present in the BALF or tracheal aspirate samples collected from three patients with severe CAP. Although other agents, including Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenza, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, were identified by deep sequencing, they only accounted for a minor part of the microbial reads in early samples, indicating that colonization or possible secondary infections occurred but that they were not the primary causative agents. The HSV-1 reads were identified in the respiratory samples from two patients. However, when compared to those of HRV-A21, they were not the dominant species. It may accounts for the activation of latent viral infections during severe infections. Reads of hepatitis B virus detected in RMH001 in the second respiratory samples might result from the alveolar hemorrhagic effusion. However, the role of these infections in the severity of pneumonia should be intensively investigated in future studies. Taken together, these data suggest that there is an association between HRV-A21 and CAP. In the past, HRV infections were thought to cause changes in the airway microbiome and increase lung inflammation in COPD patients12. Whether HRV infection contributes to secondary bacterial infections, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, and whether HRV is a co-pathogen with these agents during the disease process (as is influenza virus) warrants further investigation13.",

            "text": "Genomic variation may also be a determinant of viral adaption and pathogenesis. In the Enterovirus genus, variation can lead to the emergence of new strains or genotypes in epidemics418. For example, the emergent EV-D68 that circulated in the USA in 2014 (http://www.cdc.gov/non-polio-enterovirus/outbreaks/EV-D68-outbreaks.html) contained mutant genomic sequences, which could have been responsible for the outbreak and increased disease severity419. The VP1 BC and DE loops, the VP2 EF loop, and the VP3 knob regions are known to form the major neutralization sites in picornaviruses and the aa mutations in these regions might change the ability to neutralize the virus20. The fact that infections of the new HRV A21 isolate could not be neutralized by the antiserum against the prototype strain indicates that the new HRV-A21 strains are antigenic distinct to the prototype strain. Previous studies have also demonstrated that the single aa site mutation in VP1, the VP2 EF loop, and the VP3 knob enhance the virulence of CVB2, B3, and EV71, and the mutation site in the 3D gene, which encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of EVs, decreased the virulence of EV71 in mice202122. In this study, specific mutations in the VP1, VP2 EF loop, VP3 knob, and 3D regions of HRV-A21 strains were identified by deep sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. However, no specific site mutations were found in sequences obtained from HRV-A21-positive dead cases. The A389 mutation in the VP3 knob of HRV-A21 identified in this study, corresponding to the site in CVB3 has been demonstrated relating to the virulence in CVB3 21. Whether the others HRV-A21 mutations facilitate host adaption and replication, especially in the lower respiratory tract tropism, and result in clinical disease phenotypes remains unclear and warrants further investigation. We also found the switches between minor and major alleles in serially collected HRV strains of RMH123, a dead case, which indicates the occurrence of viral quasispecies during infections. The fact that several HRV variants co-circulate in the population and that we do not have waves of one unique virus indicates a need for precise genotyping of HRV infections. Our findings highlight that HRV should not be underestimated in severe respiratory illness.",

All reads assigned to the Enterovirus genus were retrieved and aligned to the consensus sequence of the reference strain, HRV-A21_p1177_sR3307_2010 (GenBank accession number JN837693), using BWA (version 0.7.5, BWA-MEM algorithm) and GATK (version 2.5.2)3233.
