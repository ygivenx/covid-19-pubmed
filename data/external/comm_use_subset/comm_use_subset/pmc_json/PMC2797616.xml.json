It has been hypothesized that basal levels of autophagy occur continuously inside of cells [20]. An increase in autophagic activity can be stimulated by amino acid starvation, hormone signaling, cytokines, TLR stimulation, immunity related GTPases and microbial infection [16]\u2013[18], [20].

(2003) reported that approximately 92% of chloramphenicol treated L. monocytogenes were surrounded by double-membrane vacuoles in J774 macrophage-like cells 21 hours post infection. The number of these chloramphenicol-treated bacteria captured by autophagic-like membranes decreased in the presence of autophagy inhibitors [22]. Subsequently, Py et al. (2007) showed that L. monocytogenes induces autophagy, as measured by microtubule associated light chain 3 (LC3) lipidation and colocalization of LC3 with intracellular bacteria. Further, Py et al., (2007) provided evidence that L. monocytogenes replicate more efficiently in autophagy-deficient (atg5\n\u2212/\u2212) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) compared to wild-type MEFs, suggesting that an Atg5-dependent process directly inhibits the replication of wild-type L. monocytogenes in mammalian cells. Using similar assays to test for autophagic induction, Birmingham et al. (2007) demonstrated that RAW 264.7 macrophages transfected with LC3-GFP, exhibited colocalization of transfected LC3-GFP with L. monocytogenes. However, the authors of this study did not observe that wild-type L. monocytogenes grew better in atg5\n\u2212/\u2212 MEFs than in wild-type MEFs. Thus the role of Atg5 in the control of wild-type L. monocytogenes replication in cultured transformed MEF cells remains controversial.",

Further, both ActA and the bacterial phospholipases (PlcA and PlcB) were reported to play a role in escaping autophagy, as measured by LC3I colocalization and bacterial growth in the presence or absence of Atg5 [23], [24]. This suggested that autophagy may play a role in the control of wild-type L. monocytogenes replication that is effectively inhibited by the action of bacterial phospholipases and/or actin polymerization. However, this hypothesis has not been directly tested in primary cells. Yano et al. (2008) showed that autophagy in Drosophila hemocytes was induced in response to L. monocytogenes infection and was dependent upon detection of peptidoglycan by the cytosolic receptor PGRP-LE as well as on bacterial expression of LLO. Lastly, Zhao et al. (2008) revealed that mice lacking Atg5 in macrophages and neutrophils had a slight increase in susceptibility to L. monocytogenes as measured by bacterial levels in spleen and liver three days after infection. However, this work did not address whether the role of Atg5 in vivo was due to autophagy or an autophagy- independent role of Atg5. Furthermore, Zhao et al.

Activation of autophagy triggers LC3-I lipidation resulting in the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, which is measured by a mobility shift on SDS-PAGE [27]. Within 40 minutes of infection with wild-type L. monocytogenes, the amount of LC3-II increased compared to uninfected cells (Fig. 1A). \u0394hly (LLO-minus) L. monocytogenes and heat-killed bacteria stimulated almost no LC3-I to LC3-II conversion, as compared to wild-type L. monocytogenes over a 60 minute time course of infection (Fig. 1B and data not shown). Therefore, we concluded that while infection alone induced very little autophagy, wild-type bacteria secreting LLO induced increased amounts of autophagy. Further, we found that during a 60-minute infection, the absence of the bacterial proteins ActA and either of the phospholipases did not significantly affect the amount of autophagy activation as measured by LC3-I lipidation (Fig. 1B).",

As previously reported, LLO-containing liposomes were phagocytosed, their contents released and the dextran delivered to the cytosol.

The capacity of L. monocytogenes to escape from phagocytic vacuoles was examined in both fibroblasts and macrophages that lacked functional autophagy due to the targeted disruption of the essential autophagy gene atg5\n[33], [34]. L. monocytogenes escaped at an increased rate from primary vacuoles in the presence of autophagy in MEFs (Fig. 5A). In contrast, the presence of autophagy had no measurable effect on escape rates in bone marrow-derived macrophages (Fig. 5B). Further, contrary to a previous report, bacterial mutants lacking the secreted phospholipases that contribute to vacuolar escape had similar levels of cytosolic entry in both wild-type and atg5\u2212/\u2212 MEFs as well as BMDMs (Fig. 5A, B) [24]. Finally, autophagy did not significantly affect the growth of wild-type L. monocytogenes in either MEFs or BMDMs (Fig. 5C, D). Therefore, while LLO stimulated autophagy, there was no observable consequence in bacterial escape or growth in BMDMs. However, the decreased escape observed in atg5\u2212/\u2212 MEFs suggests that under some conditions, autophagy may enhance, rather than prevent, bacterial escape.",

Pathogens that grow and or reside in the cytosol, such as: Shigella flexneri, Francisella tularensis, and Group A Streptococci lyse the host phagosomal membrane, escape into the cytosol and subsequently induce autophagy, as measured by LC3 colocalization, lipidation and electron microscopy [35]\u2013[37]. Bacteria that reside in pathogen-modified vacuoles, such as Legionella pneumophila, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, have also been reported to stimulate autophagy, also as measured by the above mentioned techniques [18], [38]\u2013[42]. In both groups of bacteria that induce autophagy, it remains unclear if cytosolic translocation of bacteria and/or bacterial products, and/or phagosomal membrane damage, is the signal that induces autophagy. It is formally possible that all three induce autophagy under some conditions. In Drosophila, autophagy is induced by cytoplasmic peptidoglycan sensors, and the signaling pathway involved is independent of the known pathways that induce the expression of antimicrobial peptides [43]. Thus it is possible that L. monocytogenes induction of autophagy is multi-step process, with LLO falling upstream of an as-yet-unidentified receptor. However, the data presented here, with LLO- containing liposomes indicate that, while these other putative steps may play a role during bacterial infection, the presence of damaged membranes alone is sufficient to induce LC3 colocalization.",

However, our data from infection of atg5\u2212/\u2212 BMDMs provided no evidence that autophagy had a measurable effect on bacterial escape from phagosomes or on intracellular growth. In contrast, autophagy slightly increased phagosomal escape and intracellular growth in transformed MEFs, which potentially highlights differences in autophagy utilization and/orfunction between various cell types. Additionally, our data provided no evidence that either ActA or bacterial phospholipases affect autophagy as measured by LC3I lipidation and autophagy-restrictive intracellular growth (some data not shown). Finally, by using heterologous expression of LLO and purified LLO encapsulated in liposomes, we showed that LLO activity was not only necessary but sufficient to trigger autophagy. These results are consistent with a model wherein phagosomal membrane damage induces autophagy.",

Additionally, we examined phagosomal escape much earlier during infection. The majority of wild-type L. monocytogenes escape the vacuole within the first 30 minutes following entry, however Py et al. (2007) assayed escape at four hours post-infection [44]. Since L. monocytogenes begin to spread from cell to cell as early as three hours post-infection and phospholipase mutants have a known defect in escape from a secondary vacuole, it is possible that the defect in growth observed by Py et al. (2007) was due to a defect in escape from vacuoles of secondarily infected cells [13], [45], [46]\n",

For example, smooth ER, excess peroxisomes, damaged mitochondria and rough ER have been shown to be selectively targeted and removed from cells by the autophagic machinery [47]\u2013[50]. We propose that some or all of these organelles are targeted by autophagy due to membrane damage. For example, chemically damaged mitochondria are selectively targeted and removed by autophagy [49]. Selective removal is thought to be due to the disruption of the inner membrane by pores which occurs upon depolarization, a signal which may be similar to pore formation due to cytolysin expression [49]. Our hypothesis is further supported by two reports showing that two pore forming toxins secreted by extracellular pathogens, Vibrio cholerae cytolysin (VCC) and the vacuolating cytotoxin from Helicobacter pylori (VacA), also induce autophagy in the absence of infection [51]\u2013[53]. Autophagic bodies were identified inside of cells exposed to VCC [52]. Similarly, we noted non-specific induction of autophagy (diffuse puncta formation), when LC3-GFP BMDMs were exposed to increasing concentrations of extracellular LLO (data not shown). Further autophagic induction in response to VacA was blocked when the channel forming activity of the toxin was inhibited [53]. Therefore, autophagy may be a general response to membrane damage, and as a result may have evolved as a mechanism to recognize and target intracellular pathogens.",

Both primary and secondary antibodies as well as phalloidin were incubated at room temperature for 60 minutes followed by three washes with TBST buffer. Coverslips were mounted as described above. Bacterial escape was quantified by the number of actin associated (red, phalloidin-positive) fluorescent bacteria over the total number of intracellular green fluorescent bacteria at 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes post-infection. The percentage of escape was determined by dividing the number of phalloidin-positive (escaped) bacteria by the number of total intracellular bacteria [58]. Numbers were obtained from the average of a minimum of three experiments.",

The Laemmli buffer was added directly to the infected cells and scraped off the tissue culture treated Petri dishes using a cell scraper. The samples were collected into Eppendorf tubes, boiled for 5 minutes at 95\u00b0C and loaded on 12% pre-cast NuPage gels (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Gels were run in 1 X 3-morpholinopropane-1-sulfonic acid (MOPS) buffer (Invitrogen). Gels were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane at 15V for 1 hour on a Trans-Blot Semi-Dry Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The membrane was blocked for 1 hour at room temperature with Odyssey blocking buffer (LI-COR, Nebraska, NE, catalogue no. 929-97301) diluted 1\u22361 with PBS. The membrane was incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with mouse monoclonal anti-LC3 antibody (courtesy of R. Kopito and B. Riley, Stanford University) at 1\u2236500 in blocking buffer containing 0.02% Sodium Azide and 0.1% Tween-20. The membrane was washed three times for 10 minutes with TBST. The membrane was incubated with the LI-COR secondary antibody covalently attached to an infrared-emitting fluorophore IRdye-680 and IRdye-800 (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE (goat anti-mouse IgG, 0.5 mg)) for 1 hour at room temperature. The membrane was washed three times for 10 minutes with TBST followed by one wash with 1X PBS. Membranes were scanned at 700 nm or 800 nm using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences), and quantitated using the accompanying software package (Odyssey V 3.0). Anti-gamma-tubulin, mouse monoclonal (clone GTU-88, Sigma catalogue no. T6557) was used as a loading control. Westerns were repeated three independent times.",
