The LACV genome consists of three single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genome segments designated small (S), medium (M), and large (L). The S segment encodes two proteins in overlapping reading frames: the nucleoprotein (N) and a non-structural protein (NSS) which suppresses type 1 interferon (IFN) in the mammal host. The M segment encodes a single polyprotein (M polyprotein) that is post-translationally processed into two glycoproteins (GN and GC), and a non-structural protein (NSM) [3]. GN and GC are the major proteins to which neutralizing antibodies are directed [4,5]. The L segment encodes a single open reading frame for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) [6].",

Ae. triseriatus feed on Eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus grinseus) and Eastern gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) which serve as amplifying hosts for LACV [7-9]. Interestingly, the virus can be maintained in the mosquito population in the absence of vertebrate hosts by transovarial (vertical) transmission, thus allowing the virus to over-winter in mosquito eggs [9]. More recently, LACV has been isolated from naturally infected, non-native Aedes albopictus mosquito [10]. The infection of Ae. albopictus may represent a shift in virus ecology and increases the possibility for generation of new reassortants [11].",

Isolation of virus is rare and has been made from post-mortem brain tissue collected in 1960, 1978, and 1993 [15-18].

Inflammatory lesions consisted of infiltration of mononuclear leukocytes either diffusely or as microglial nodules. The largest inflammatory foci were observed in the cerebral cortex, including the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes, and foci could also be found in the basal ganglion and pons. In these two cases, there was a lack of inflammatory lesions in the posterior occipital cortex, cerebral white matter, cerebellum, medulla, and spinal cord [17]. Brain biopsy from a non-fatal LACV infection contained areas of perivascular mononuclear cuffing and focal aggregates of mononuclear and microglia cells [16]. RT-PCR analysis of neural tissues from the 1978 case could only detect viral RNA in the cerebral cortex and not in the medulla, cerebellum, spinal cord, basal ganglion, or temporal lobe [20].",

LACV administered subcutaneously to suckling mice first replicates in muscle, and viremia develops with virus invading the brain across vascular endothelial cells [28-31]. Virus replication in muscle was confirmed by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, and the predominant cell type infected in the CNS is the neuron [28,32]. The virulence of LACV for mice decreases with increasing age, similar to humans in which it causes CNS disease predominantly in pediatric populations [13,28]. As an initial step in the establishment of animal models useful for vaccine development for humans, we sought to better characterize the tissue tropism of LACV in mice by identifying the tissues that support LACV replication after peripheral inoculation. We have previously described Swiss Webster mice as suitable for characterization of LACV infection at birth and at 3-weeks of age [6]. Here we inoculated 3-week old Swiss Webster mice with either 1 or 100 LD50 of virus intraperitoneally. Twenty tissues were individually collected for six consecutive days and processed for virus titration, immunohistochemical staining, and histopathology studies.",

Rhesus monkeys were chosen since they are susceptible to a variety of neurotropic arboviruses, including flaviviruses [33]. In this study, rhesus monkeys were infected intramuscularly or subcutaneously with a mosquito or human isolate of LACV. These two isolates were used since preliminary genomic sequence analysis indicate that there are host specific differences between LACV isolated from humans and mosquitos [6]. LACV was found to be highly infectious for rhesus monkeys, but infection did not result in viremia, disease, or significant changes in blood chemistries or cell counts. However, high titers of neutralizing antibodies developed in all monkeys indicating that rhesus monkeys, although not optimal, will be useful for studying the infectivity and immunogenicity of LACV vaccine candidates.",

In developing a rodent model for our live attenuated LACV vaccine development program, we sought to characterize LACV infection in outbred weanling mice, rather than suckling mice, since older mice can be used to study both the level of attenuation and the immunogenicity of our LACV vaccine candidates. To identify key steps in pathogenesis of LACV in weanling mice, we evaluated LACV tissue tropism after peripheral inoculation of wild-type virus and sought to identify tissues in which virus replicated efficiently. Weanling Swiss Webster mice (21\u201323 days-old) were inoculated intraperitoneally with 1 or 100 LD50 (2.5 or 4.5 log10 PFU) of LACV/human/1960, and the tissues indicated in Figures 1 and 2 were collected from 3 mice per day on days 1\u20136 post inoculation. Following inoculation of either dose, virus could first be detected in tissue near the inoculation site such as inguinal lymph nodes, spleen, and ovaries/uterus. Virus was detected in serum on days 1\u20133, but rarely on subsequent days even in moribund mice. By day three, virus distribution was widespread and could be found in the majority of tissues sampled, albeit at very low levels with titers rarely exceeding those found in serum. The highest virus titers detected were present in nasal turbinates, brain, and spinal cord. Respiratory tissue, including lung and nasal turbinates, contained virus following inoculation with 100 or 1 LD50 beginning on days 1 and 2, respectively. CNS infection appeared to follow respiratory tissue infection, with virus being present in the brain 5 days after infection with 1 LD50 and on day 2 after infection with 100 LD50. At either virus dose, infection appears early in the lymph nodes and major organs, with subsequent infection of the upper respiratory tract (nasal turbinates) followed by infection of the brain and eventually the spinal cord. By day six, mice began to succumb to infection in the high dose group showing signs of paralysis whereas mice in the low dose group failed to show clinical signs at this time, but would have succumbed later in infection. These results indicate that LACV replicates to low to moderate levels in peripheral tissues in weanling mice, with the nasal turbinates rather than striated muscle being the major site of replication.",

Clinical disease served as a surrogate for lethality and mice were promptly euthanized prior to succumbing to LACV disease. In both groups, clinical disease was first noted on day 6 (Figure 3). Twenty days post-inoculation, the LD50 was determined. All surviving mice were tested for the development of a neutralizing antibody response. To determine the ID50 titer, mice were considered infected if they either developed clinical disease or a serum neutralizing antibody titer. The LD50 was similar in both the IN and IP groups (2.4 and 2.3 log10 PFU, respectively) with the LD50 following IP injection in agreement with previous experiments [6]. The ID50 titers (1.5 and 1.6 log10 PFU for the IN and IP routes, respectively) were slightly lower than the LD50 titers, indicating LACV can cause a subclincal infection in weanling mice, but only at low doses.",

Illness was not observed following virus administration, and virus was not detected at any time in serum samples (Table 2). Virus was present at a low titer in lymph nodes on days 6, 8, and 12, however, virus replication in these tissues could not be identified by IHC staining. Despite the low level (or absence) of viremias and highly restricted replication in the tissues sampled, all monkeys developed neutralizing antibody responses that were first detected on days 6\u20138 indicating that the each monkey was infected. Twenty-eight days after inoculation, neutralizing antibody titers (PRNT60) for each group were in the range of 1:560 \u2013 1:2186 (Table 2). Low-level cross-reactive antibodies were present in two monkeys (CL6E and DBOH) at the start of the experiment. A boost in antibody titer in these monkeys was not observed compared to other monkeys, suggesting that this experimental LACV infection was a primary infection.",

Previous LACV pathogenesis studies in suckling mice inoculated subcutaneously with a mosquito isolate of LACV demonstrated that viral antigen was detected in the cytoplasm of striated muscles, the interscapular brown fat, and the endothelial and smooth muscle cells of small arteries and veins [28]. When virus was first detected in the brain, it was confined to cerebral vascular endothelial cells but later spread to neurons. The authors suggest that the late infection of the dorsal route ganglion indicates that the virus does not penetrate the CNS via nerves but rather by vascular endothelial cells [28]. This previous model therefore suggests that virus first replicates in muscle cells leading to the development of viremia with subsequent hematogenous spread to the CNS, and we sought in the present study to examine if this pattern of infection also occurred in weanling mice.",

At either dose, virus was no longer detectable by days 4 and 5 in these tissues, suggesting that it was rapidly cleared by the innate immune system. Interestingly, the virus was not detected in muscle tissue until day 3 post inoculation and clearly did not preferentially infect this tissue. Rather, outside the CNS, the virus replicated to highest titers in the nasal turbinates and appears to spread from this site into the brain. Immunohistochemical staining of the nasal turbinate tissue was not sensitive enough to identify the LACV infected cells, but is thought LACV may gain access to the CNS via cells in the nasal turbinates. This suggestion is offered with the caveat that respiratory epithelial cells could also have been infected, but the magnitude of the infection could not be detected with the IHC staining. To travel from the nasal olfactory epithelium to the olfactory bulb, the virus would follow olfactory neurons into the brain, as infection is first detected in the rostral section of the brain.",

A mammalian host that drinks the water would intake both fluid, which might contain free virus from lysed larvae, and infected larvae, either of which could initiate an infection in the mammalian host. Thus, exposure to such water could lead to an alternate route of infection for the natural hosts, i.e., the oral/nasal route in addition to the vector-bourne route.

The LACV ID50 for humans is unknown, but if human exposure is limited to a small dose, the virus may be effectively controlled by the immune system and CNS infection may be averted. If, like our mouse model, an individual is exposed to a greater dose of virus, virus growth may outpace control mechanisms leading to CNS infection. To further support the role of immune control affecting human disease outcome, it has been shown that individuals residing in endemic areas with major histocompatibility complex molecule B49 on CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (HLA-B49) had a greater relative risk of developing encephalitis after infection (relative risk 17.65, \u03c72 = 7.3, P < 0.1).
