This size range is the largest among those of the different classes of RNA viruses, although it is small compared to those of DNA viruses and cellular organisms. These profound genome size differences between RNA and DNA life forms are inversely correlated with mutation rates, which are highest in RNA viruses, thought due to the lack of proofreading during replication [1]\u2013[3].",

            "text": "Recently, the molecular basis of the relation between RNA virus genome sizes and mutation rates has been revisited in studies of nidoviruses with large genomes (\u201clarge nidoviruses\u201d). These viruses, with genomes of 26.3 to 31.6 kb, include the Coronaviridae and Roniviridae families and are at the upper end of the RNA virus genome size range [4]. They are uniquely separated from other ssRNA+ viruses (3.0\u201319.6 kb genomes), including the distantly related Arteriviridae family (12.7\u201315.7 kb genomes; \u201csmall nidoviruses\u201d) with which they form the order Nidovirales\n[4]\u2013[6]. The order includes five major lineages of viruses that infect vertebrate and invertebrate hosts. Their complex genetic architecture includes multiple open reading frames (ORFs) that are expressed by region-specific mechanisms. The first two regions are formed by the two 5\u2032-most and partially overlapping ORFs, ORF1a and ORF1b, which are translated from the genomic RNA to produce polyproteins 1a (pp1a) and pp1ab. The expression level of ORF1b is downregulated relative to that of ORF1a by the use of the ORF1a/1b ribosomal frameshifting signal [7], [8]. Both pp1a and pp1ab are autoproteolytically processed by ORF1a-encoded proteases to yield numerous products that control genome expression and replication [9]. The third, 3\u2032-located region of the nidovirus genome includes multiple smaller ORFs (3\u2032ORFs), although the number of these ORFs varies considerably among nidoviruses. These genes are expressed from 3\u2032-coterminal subgenomic mRNAs to produce the structural proteins incorporated into the enveloped nidovirus particles and, optionally, other proteins modulating virus-host interactions [10]\u2013[13]. With the exception of a few nidoviruses, the subgenomic and genomic mRNAs are also 5\u2032-coterminal. A mechanism of discontinuous negative-stranded RNA synthesis, yielding the templates for subgenomic mRNA production, is thought to control this mosaic structure of nidovirus mRNAs. The synthesis of subgenome-length negative stranded RNAs is guided by short transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs) \u2013 located in the common \u201cleader sequence\u201d (near the genomic 5\u2032 end) and in each \u201cmRNA body\u201d (upstream of the expressed ORFs) - that share a conserved core sequence and flank the genome region that is not present in the respective subgenomic mRNAs.",

It also revealed a distant relationship between ExoN and a cellular DNA-proofreading enzyme. Based on these observations, nidoviruses were proposed to have acquired ExoN to control the replication fidelity of their expanding genome [15]. The enzymatic activities of ExoN were subsequently verified and detailed in biochemical studies [16], [17]. Likewise, and in line with the expectations, ExoN-inactivating mutations were shown to decrease RNA replication fidelity by \u223c15\u201320 fold in two coronaviruses, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), while only modestly affecting virus viability [18], [19]. These results strongly support a critical role of ExoN in the control of replication fidelity of large nidoviruses, although more mechanistic insight is clearly required before the current paradigm connecting RNA virus mutation rates and genome size control could be definitively revised to include proof-reading during the replication of large RNA genomes [20].",

Accordingly, if ExoN was acquired to ensure the expansion of RNA genomes beyond a certain size, we may expect (i) a genome size threshold that separates RNA viruses with and without ExoN; (ii) all nidoviruses with genome sizes above this threshold to encode ExoN; and (iii) no other domain than ExoN to correlate, functionally and phyletically, with genome size control in large nidoviruses.",

However, whether these viruses actually exist has thus far remained an open question. Three considerations suggest that if nidoviruses with intermediate-sized genomes ever evolved they may already have gone extinct. First, it is recognized that the evolution of RNA viruses is characterized by a high birth-death rate and the extinction of numerous virus lineages, resulting in the fast turnover of species [21]. Secondly, the genome size gap between large nidoviruses and all other known ssRNA+ viruses has existed without exception since genome sequencing began in the 1980s. As of the late 1980s, this gap has been bordered by closteroviruses (from the bottom) and nidoviruses (from the top) (Fig. 1). Likewise and thirdly, all nidovirus genomes sequenced to date have sizes that are similar to either IBV (27,600 nt) [22] or EAV (12,700 nt) [23], which were the first fully sequenced coronavirus and arterivirus genomes, respectively. The evident under-representation of RNA viruses with relatively large genomes is even more striking in the light of the continuous flow of newly identified ssRNA+ viruses with smaller genome sizes [24] (Fig. 1).",

Comparative genome analyses involving this newly identified virus provide evolutionary evidence for the acquisition of the ExoN domain by a nidovirus (ancestor) with a genome size in the range of \u223c16\u201320 kb. This range appears to define the size limit for the expansion of ssRNA+ virus genomes, which may be achieved in evolution without the recruitment of a specialized enzyme that controls replication fidelity. Furthermore, we found that two other replicative enzymes, N7-methyltransferase (NMT) and NendoU, are not encoded by toroviruses and invertebrate nidoviruses, respectively, indicating that they may contribute \u201coptional activities\u201d for the nidovirus replication machinery. Together our results highlight the broad benefits of virus discovery efforts applied to mosquitoes.",

Although no common repeats larger than six nucleotides were identified in these four areas, we noticed the presence of two pairs of near-perfect repeats: the first pair located in the 5\u2032-UTR (nt 26\u201340 of the genome) and the region upstream of ORF3 (14 out of 15 residues are identical), and the second pair encompassing nt 125\u2013137 of the 5\u2032-UTR and a sequence immediately upstream of ORF2a/2b (12 out of 13 residues are identical) (Fig. 3D). The two pairs share from \u223c43 to 52% pair-wise sequence identity in an alignment containing a single gap (Fig. 3D), and no other repeats of comparable or larger size were found in the analyzed areas. The locations and sizes of these repeats suggest they are TRS signals, although no candidate TRS was identified immediately upstream of ORF4; to our knowledge, the use of two alternative leader TRSs has not been observed in other nidoviruses thus far. These observations suggested that NDiV uses at least two subgenomic mRNAs for the expression of the 3\u2032-located ORFs and that these mRNAs have 5\u2032-terminal sequences of different size in common with the viral genome.",

RFS is conserved in nidoviruses and this property is widely used for computational mapping of its determinants in newly sequenced genomes. We followed this approach to map potential RFS signals in the NDiV genome (Fig. 4). The 40-nt NDiV ORF1a/ORF1b overlap region was found to have the best match (GGAUUUU) with the slippery sequence (AAAUUUU) of invertebrate roniviruses [28], which deviates considerably from the pattern (XXXYYYZ) conserved in vertebrate nidoviruses (Fig. 4A). No appreciated similarity with the latter motif was found in the NDiV ORF1a/ORF1b overlap region. The distances separating the NDiV putative RFS from the termination codons flanking the ORF1a/ORF1b overlap are within the range found in large nidoviruses, while being out of the distance range to the ORF1a stop codon of small nidoviruses (Fig. 4B). According to the analysis of a 190-nt sequence - which starts within the NDiV ORF1a/ORF1b overlap - with Mfold [29] and pknotsRG [30], the predicted slippery sequence is followed by a complex stem-loop structure; no pseudoknots, unless forced, are predicted in this region (Fig. 4C). The slippery sequence, distance to the downstream RNA secondary structure, and predicted fold resemble those of Red clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV), a ssRNA+ plant virus of the family Tombusviridae\n[31], [32] (Fig. 4C\u2013D).

TM2 and TM3 are transmembrane domains, Zm is a Zn-cluster binding domain fused with HEL1, and 3CLpro is a 3C-like protease [4] (however see below). Since NDiV was found to be very distantly related to the other nidoviruses known to date, sequence-based functional characterization presented a considerable technical challenge. In comparative sequence analysis, profile-based methods that employ multiple sequence alignments are known to achieve the best signal-to-noise ratios [27], [33], [34]. They have been the methods of choice for establishing remote relations in biology, also in our prior studies of nidoviruses [15], [35]\u2013[37]. In this study we used profile vs. sequence and profile vs. profile searches as implemented in HMMer and HHsearch, respectively, for general comparisons. To prepare profiles, we selected representatives of small and large nidoviruses, and also three subsets of large nidoviruses (coronaviruses, toro/bafiniviruses, and roniviruses). Using profile-based searches we identified counterparts (orthologs) of nidovirus-wide conserved enzymatic domains in the NDiV pp1ab. For the identification of TM2 and TM3, predictions of transmembrane helices by TMpred were used.",

Its substrate-binding site is predicted to include a conserved His residue which was implicated in controlling the P1 specificity for Glu/Gln residues in other viruses, a hallmark of 3C/3CLpros [41]. Surprisingly, despite this finding, no candidate cleavage sites with the characteristic 3CLpro-specific signatures could be identified in the NDiV pp1a/1ab. Consequently, the sizes of all NDiV replicative domains described in this paper (Table 2) are based on the hit sizes in profile searches and are subject to future refinement. Collectively, these results strongly indicate that NDiV encodes all nidovirus-wide conserved replicase domains except for NendoU (Figure 3D; see also below), thus supporting the classification of NDiV as a nidovirus.",

The presence of these domains therefore discriminates large from small nidoviruses. Using profile searches in the ORF1b-encoded part of pp1ab, homologs of these two enzymes were identified in the NDiV genome (Table 2). Using an ExoN multiple sequence alignment of NDiV and large nidoviruses, the conserved motifs I, II, and III, including the catalytic residues (two Asp and one Glu), as well as the ExoN-specific Zn-finger module were identified in the NDiV ortholog (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, the NDiV ExoN shows an insertion whose size and position correspond to those of the second Zn-finger-like module that is exclusively found in roniviruses. However, unlike the ronivirus domain, NDiV appears to lack His/Cys residues potentially involved in Zn-binding. According to a multiple sequence alignment of nidovirus OMTs (Fig. 5B), the putative NDiV OMT contains motifs X, IV, VI and VIII, encompassing residues of the catalytic KDKE tetrad, as well as motif I involved in binding of the methyl donor [42]. These data imply that NDiV ORF1b encodes functional ExoN and OMT domains (Fig. 3D), which are both typical of large nidoviruses.",

Surprisingly, however, profile searches of nidovirus NendoUs revealed no significant hits in the corresponding region of the NDiV sequence (E-values>9.5). This observation prompted us to re-examine the NendoU assignment in other nidoviruses, including the invertebrate roniviruses [15].

Their alignment was converted into a profile with which we screened all domains of our in-house nidovirus profile database (see Materials and Methods).

The corresponding domain in toro/bafiniviruses has a much smaller size (80 aa vs. 200 aa). According to our analysis, it has no significant similarity with the NMT of coronaviruses, or the newly recognized putative NMT of roniviruses and NDiV. Based on these observations, we generated an alignment of the NMT domains of corona- and roniviruses and NDiV (Fig. 5C) in order to search for remote cellular homologs. The N-terminal part of the nidovirus NMT includes a conserved methyl donor binding site (motif I), according to the prior assignment for coronavirus NMTs. In line with this observation, a weak hit between nidovirus NMTs and a cellular guanine N7-methyltransferase involving the motif I region was detected in this study. In their C-terminal part, nidovirus NMTs uniquely include four conserved Cys/His residues indicative of a Zn-binding site that may be part of a separate domain (Fig. 5C).",

In line with the current nidovirus taxonomy and genomic data [28], [48], [50], [51], this analysis consistently identified the four known major lineages (arteri-, roni-, corona-, and toro/bafiniviruses), as well as a new one represented by NDiV, as the most deeply rooted branches. Our initial attempts to resolve the relationship among the five lineages produced uncertain results. To address this challenge, we adopted a step-wise approach starting from the analysis of close intra-group relationships in the most abundantly sampled subfamily, Coronavirinae, and the family Arteriviridae, and finishing with an analysis of the most distant inter-(sub)family relationships between the five major lineages. Prior to the nidovirus-wide phylogenetic analysis, the affinity of arteri-, roni-, and toro/bafiniviruses to the subfamily Coronavirinae was evaluated through a profile-based analysis involving conserved domains (see Supplementary Text S1 and Table S1). The obtained results confirmed that the strongest sequence affinity exists between corona- and toro/bafiniviruses, which was evident for the 6 out 8 domains that are conserved between coronaviruses and one or more of the other lineages. The HEL1 was the only domain for which an alternative strongest affinity \u2013 between corona- and roniviruses \u2013 was documented.",

It allowed us to revise and expand the assignment for two replicative enzymes of nidoviruses \u2013 NendoU and NMT. Prior to this study, the former was considered to be a genetic marker of nidoviruses [15]. Still, its (universal) function in the replication cycle of (vertebrate) nidoviruses has remained enigmatic, despite steady progress in the biochemical, structural, and genetic characterization of this enzyme in arteri- and coronaviruses [44]\u2013[47], [55]\u2013[60]. Our analysis showed that invertebrate roniviruses and NDiV do not encode a NendoU domain implying that, contrary to the current paradigm, the utilization of this enzyme in replication may be restricted by the host organism. Surprisingly, and in contrast to the case of NendoU, invertebrate nidoviruses were found to encode a putative NMT, whose ortholog was previously identified in SARS-CoV and shown to be conserved in the subfamily Coronavirinae\n[43], [49]. Our observation indicates that certain aspect(s) of the nidovirus replicative cycle that are controlled by the NMT domain could be similar in coronaviruses and invertebrate nidoviruses, but not toro/bafiniviruses which are otherwise closer to coronaviruses. Collectively, our insights into the phyletic distribution of NendoU and NMT reveal a modularity of some of the major subunits of the replication apparatus in large nidoviruses, which must be rationalized in future mechanistic studies and taken into account in drug development efforts.",

It is not clear whether the use of methyltransferases may provide particular benefits for genome size control and/or promote genome expansion, although the involvement of OMT in other modifications than 5\u2032-end capping was previously proposed for large nidoviruses [15].",

            "text": "The fixation of the ExoN domain in nidovirus genomes may be rationalized in the framework of a unidirectional triangular relationship that includes complexity, replication fidelity (mutation rate), and genome size [68] (Fig. 7). In RNA viruses, the low fidelity of replication severely restricts the size of their genomes, which can encode only relatively simple replication complexes that, hence, suffice to support low-fidelity replication [21], [69]. This low-state trap is known as the \u201cEigen paradox\u201d. Accordingly, a transition from the \u201clow\u201d to the \u201chigh\u201d state may not be accomplished by changing only one element of the triangle, e.g. improving replication fidelity, since such a change would not be compatible with the \u201clow\u201d state of the other two elements [68]\n[70]. The exclusive presence of ExoN in ssRNA+ viruses above 20 kb supports the logic of the Eigen paradox [68]. It also shows how the paradox could be solved with a single evolutionary advancement, the acquisition of ExoN, which may have relieved the constraints on all three elements of the triangular relationship (Fig. 7), providing a lasting benefit to the virus lineage that acquired ExoN. This advancement may have been accompanied by an immediate fitness gain. Accordingly, the ExoN acquisition could have provided the ancestral virus with improved control over the fidelity of its replication and the mutation spectrum (quasispecies structure) of its progeny [71], [72], which may have facilitated virus adaptation to the environment [20], [73]. Alternatively, ExoN could have been acquired in an evolutionarily neutral event. Through subsequent mutation this enzyme might have gained beneficial properties for the ancestral virus and its progeny. The functional and structural characterization of known nidoviruses and yet-to-be identified viruses in the genome size range around that of NDiV will be required to clarify this key aspect in the transition from small to large nidoviruses.",

Pooled mosquitoes were washed three times in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) containing 1000 g/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin, followed by rinsing with antibiotics-free PBS. The homogenates were prepared by triturating the mosquitoes in 2%-FCS-EMEM with subsequent centrifugation at 2,000 g for 10 min. The suspensions were filtered (0.22 nm Millipore, USA) and applied to C6/36 cells, which were monitored daily for cytopathic effects, also after three blind passages. The cell death, probably due to apoptosis, was indeed observed upon NDiV infection. The ICF were clarified by centrifugation at 2,000 g for 10 min.",

Cassette primers (C1 and C2) coupled to random hexamers (Hx) were employed. Following synthesis of first and second cDNA strands with C1Hx and C2Hx primers, respectively, PCR amplification was performed using the cassette primers C1 and C2 as per the standard protocol [78].

Multiple alignments can be converted into profiles, which are statistical models that capture the degree of conservation and the likelihood to observe a certain residue or gap in each alignment column. One type of profiles are profile Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) [93] that are particularly suitable for searching for remotely related sequences (like NDiV which presumably represents a new virus family) in a probabilistic framework. They are implemented, for example, in the programs HMMer and HHsearch which were utilized in this study. A profile HMM can be compared to other HMMs or used to search for motifs in a single sequence.

Bayesian posterior probability trees were compiled utilizing BEAST [95] under the WAG amino acid substitution matrix [96] using Tracer [97] to verify convergence. For the nidovirus-wide analysis, whose sampling is detailed Table S3, we used a concatenated alignment of 3CLpro, RdRp, and HEL1 including 910 aa positions and its derivative of 604 aa positions, from which least conserved columns were removed. In this analysis, the uncorrelated relaxed molecular clock approach (lognormal distribution) [98] was used as it was favored [99] over the strict molecular clock (log10 Bayes factor of 13.6) and equal to the relaxed molecular clock approach with exponential distribution (log10 Bayes Factor of 0.0). Selected internal nodes were fixed using results of separate analyses of subsets of nidoviruses. For phylogenetic analysis of the subfamily Coronavirinae and the family Arteriviridae, we used respective datasets incorporating between one and three sequences per species and including concatenated alignments of ORF1ab domains that are conserved in each of these groups. The datasets included 35 and 10 sequences for corona- and arteriviruses and consisted of 2302- and 2882-aa alignment positions, respectively. The topologies of these trees closely follow those published [51]. They were used to fix internal nodes in corona- and arterivirus clusters in the subsequent nidovirus-wide phylogenetic analysis. The exception was the basal nodes corresponding to the grouping of the Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammacoronavirus genera and the root of arteriviruses (EAV or SHFV), which were left unfixed. Maximum Likelihood trees were compiled utilizing the PhyML software [100]. The WAG amino acid substitution matrix and rate heterogeneity among sites (8 categories) were applied and support values for internal nodes were obtained using the non-parametric bootstrap method with 1000 replicates. Trees were rooted using domain-specific outgroups: for RdRp, three picornavirus representatives (accession numbers: NC_001489, NC_001897, NC_002058); for HEL1, four rubi-/ tetra-/ hepevirus representatives (NC_001545, NC_001990, NC_005898, NC_001434).",

To this end, we developed a custom test employing the binomial probability function and including all 43 virus groups displayed in Fig. 1. These groups consist of thousands of viruses that are believed to have emerged from a common ancestor, implying that they are not independent. Their dependence varies in virus pairs but, generally, for each virus pair is inversely proportional to the pair-wise evolutionary distance. To account for the dependence of these sequences in our test is technically challenging. To circumvent this problem, we have created a derivative of the virus dataset in which each virus family/group is represented by a single virus, in total 43 viruses. We considered the sequences of these representatives to be essentially independent due to the (extremely) large divergence that is observed, even in the most conserved genes (e.g. see Fig. 6), the lack of recognizable similarity in other genes, and the accompanied gene loss and gain.",

The final probability of the test is the product of the binomial probabilities for the two groups. We used a binomial success probability of 4/43 since four out of the 43 ssRNA+ virus lineages (NDiV, toro-/bafiniviruses, coronaviruses, and roniviruses) employ ExoN. The test was applied to each possible threshold separating two unique ssRNA+ genome sizes, in total \u2013 42 thresholds. The threshold of \u223c20 kb, between the genome sizes of NDiV and closteroviruses, gave the lowest probability to observe the ExoN association by chance. We consider the obtained value (10\u22126) as an underestimate of the true probability that should be calculated by taking into account the sequence dependence and all viruses in the 43 groups, which without exception conform to the ExoN distribution observed in the selected virus representatives used now.",
