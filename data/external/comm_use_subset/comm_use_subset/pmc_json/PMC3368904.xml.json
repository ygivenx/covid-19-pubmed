The family consists of three members, IFN-lambda1 (IL-29), IFN-lambda2 (IL-28A), and IFN-lambda3 (IL-28B) and are commonly referred to as the IFN-lambda family [1], [2]. All three IFN-lambdas utilize a common distinct receptor, the IFN-lambdaR, which is composed of the IL-10R2 chain and the unique IL-28Ralpha chain [2], [3]. The IFN-lambdaR is expressed at high densities on epithelial cells [3] but IL-28Ralpha transcripts might also be found in other cells including blood lymphocytes [2]. Binding of IFN-lambda to its receptor induces a signaling response similar to that obtained by type I IFNs [1], even though the intensity of the IFN-lambda response is generally weaker [1], [4]. The anti-viral effects obtained by IFN-lambda protects against some but not all viral infections, and preferentially those that occur at mucosal surfaces [5], [6].",

IFN-alpha not only promotes IFN-gamma production by CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells [7], [8] but can also re-direct an already established Th2 response into a more Th1-like response [9]. IFN-lambda share some of the immune-modulatory functions of IFN-alpha. Signaling through the IFN-lambdaR induces the phosphorylation of both STAT 1 and STAT 4 [1], [4], i.e. transcription factors involved in the development of IFN-gamma/Th1 responses [7], [10]. The main T-cell immune-modulatory function of IFN-lambda1 that has been reported is in dampening Th2 responses, in particular IL-13 [11]\u2013[13]. It is however not conclusively proven that IFN-lambda has direct effects on CD4+ T-cell polarization rather than operating through accessory cells such as dendritic cells and monocytes [14].",

The lack of induction of IFN-lambda2 was not dependent on the kinetics, at these low levels remained constant over 72 h (Fig. 1D). It should be noted that the sensitivity of the ELISAs varied from 10 pg/ml for IFN-alpha, 60 pg/ml for IFN-lambda1 and 100 pg/ml for IFN-lambda2. This means that we have not been able to detect potential low IFN-lambda2 responses. The HHV-6B-induced production of both IFN-alpha and IFN-lambda1 was dependent on TLR9 as it was completely abolished in the presence of a TLR9-specific inhibitor, G-ODN (Fig. 1A\u2013B).",

To assess whether IFN-alpha or IFN-lambda1 is implicated in the HHV-6B-induced Th1/Th2 shift in vitro, we performed MLR of cord pDC and CD4+ T-cells in the presence or absence of HHV-6B and either a specific inhibitor of TLR9 (G-ODN) or neutralizing antibodies to IFN-alpha or IFN-lambda1. In titration experiments, we found that at 10 ug/ml, both these antibodies neutralized 5000 pg/ml of recombinant IFN-alpha and IFN-lambda1, respectively (not shown). As shown before [15], the CD4+ T-cell production of IFN-gamma was increased while the production of IL-5 and IL-13 was decreased in MLR cultures exposed to HHV-6B (Fig. 2A\u2013C). Neutralizing antibodies to IFN-alpha blocked the HHV-6B-induced IFN-gamma responses while neutralizing antibodies to IFN-lambda1 did not have this effect (Fig. 2A). Addition of G-ODN, a specific blocker of TLR9 signaling, blocked the HHV-6B-induced increase in IFN-gamma production and also the HHV-6-induced dampening of IL-13 responses in these cultures (Fig. 3). Neutralization of IFN-alpha or IFN-lambda1 did however not impact on the HHV-6B-induced dampening of IL-5 and IL-13 responses (Fig. 2B\u2013C).",

To ascertain that the recombinant cytokines used were biologically functional we first assessed their ability to induce MxA transcription in purified pDC and found that four hour incubation with IFN-alpha or IFN-lambda1 enhanced the MxA transcription 50-fold and 10-fold, respectively. Since anti-CD3 activation alone did not give rise to any measurable IL-13 responses (not shown), we added soluble anti-CD28 to these cultures. As expected, IFN-alpha had profound effects on the cytokine production profiles and promoted both IFN-gamma and IL-10 responses and blocked IL-5 and IL-13 responses by the T-cells (Fig. 4). IFN-lambda1 on the other hand did not affect the production of any of these cytokines (Fig. 4).",

Even though IFN-lambda1 genes are considered to be early response genes whereas IFN-lambda2 is expressed with delayed kinetics [14], there were no apparent IFN-lambda2 responses even at 72 h post activation. IFN-lambda2 depends on the inducible IRF7 pathway whereas IFN-lambda1 is also regulated by the constitutively expressed IRF3 [17]. Since IRF7 is constitutively expressed in pDC [18], our data clearly show that pDC produce higher amounts of IFN-lambda1 compared to IFN-lambda2 in response to HHV-6B exposure. We have previously shown that inactivated HHV-6B can induce high levels of IFN-alpha by cord pDC [15] and the data from this study show that both the IFN-alpha and the IFN-lambda1 responses induced by HHV-6B are mediated through TLR9. This is in accordance with many other herpesviruses such as varicella zoster virus, HSV and EBV, which all induce type I IFN responses in pDC through the TLR9 pathway [19]\u2013[21].",

That IFN-alpha has T-cell immune-modulatory functions is well established [7]\u2013[9] and reflects the almost universal expression of the IFN-alpha/beta receptor on nucleated cells. However, when we neutralized IFN-alpha in HHV-6B-exposed mixed lymphocyte reactions we only managed to influence the Th1 responses. Thus, addition of neutralizing antibodies to IFN-alpha blocked the virus-induced enhancement in IFN-gamma production without affecting the virus-induced reduction in Th2 cytokines. In contrast, addition of recombinant IFN-alpha to activated cord CD4+ T-cells affected both the Th1 and the Th2 responses. In this setting, IFN-alpha enhanced the production of IFN-gamma and reduced the production of IL-5 and IL-13. This implies that IFN-alpha indeed has the capacity to influence both Th1 and Th2 responses. The lack-of-effect of anti-IFN-alpha in enhancing the Th2 responses in the HHV-6B-exposed cord MLR could imply that other factors than IFN-alpha also has a Th2-dampening effect. In relation to this, we recently showed that enveloped viruses (in this case coronavirus, CMV, HSV-1, influenza virus and morbillivirus), but not naked virus, blocked IL-13 responses in vitro, and that this inhibition occurred independently of IFN-alpha responses [22]. This would argue for an IFN-alpha-independent modulation of IL-13 responses by virus such as HHV-6B.",

When we added recombinant IFN-lambda1 to activated cord CD4+ T-cells, we could not document any effect on either Th1 (IFN-gamma) or Th2 (IL-5 and IL-13) responses. In addition, neutralization of IFN-lambda1 in HHV-6B-exposed cord mixed lymphocyte reactions did not affect the levels of either Th1 or Th2 cytokines, including IL-13. We therefore decided to check for the expression of the IFN-lambda receptor on CD4+ T-cells. Resting CD4+ T-cells did not show any expression of the IL-28Ralpha chain, nor did CD4+ T-cells that had been activated with anti-CD3 or exposed to IFN-alpha. Previous studies have identified IL-28Ralpha transcripts in human T-cells [13], [23] but our data clearly show that there is no IL-28Ralpha protein expression on the cell surface on neither resting nor activated CD4+ cells. We thus conclude that IFN-lambda1 does not have direct effects on CD4+ T-cells due to the lack-of-expression of the cognate cytokine receptor. This is in line with a recent report by Arasteh et al [24] showing that IFN-lambda2 has no effect on CD25 expression or proliferation of cord CD4+ T-cells. There is however one report showing a direct effect of IFN-lambda1 on purified human CD4+ T-cells [13]. In this study it was shown that IFN-lambda not only suppressed GATA-3-induced Th2 responses but also indirectly enhanced IFN-gamma responses [13]. However, the authors used negative selection for the CD4+ purification. Given that the purified cells used were not completely pure (>95%) indicates that there might have been some accessory cells left among the CD4+ T-cells [13]. If so, the effect of IFN-lambda1 could well be mediated indirectly via some other cell subset.",

This indicates to us that IFN-lambda acts preferentially on certain subsets of antigen-presenting cells and that the observed effects of IFN-lambda on CD4+ T-cell differentiation [11]\u2013[13] are indirect. The most plausible mode of action of IFN-lambda is through its interaction with myeloid cells [27]. This assumption is substantiated by in vitro studies showing that IFN-lambda blocks IL-13 responses and promotes IFN-gamma responses through its effects on dendritic cells [11], [12]. Furthermore, IFN-lambda promotes Th1 responses and blocks Th2 and Th17 responses in vivo in mice through its modulation of the IL-12 production by lung myeloid dendritic cells [28]. The Th2 dampening and Th1 promoting effects could be adoptively transferred by IL-28A-treated CD11c+ cells [28].",

Experimentally, we strengthened this hypothesis by showing that HHV-6B exposure blocks Th2 responses and allergy development in a mouse model of allergic disease [16]. In vitro we showed that HHV-6B can promote Th1 responses (IFN-gamma) and reduce Th2 responses (IL-5 and IL-13) [15].

We initially hypothesized that IFN-lambda is implicated in dampening the Th2 responses [11]\u2013[13], but this was not the case in our in vitro system.
