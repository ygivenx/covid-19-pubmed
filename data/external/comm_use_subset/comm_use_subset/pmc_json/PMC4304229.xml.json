More importantly this suggests we should have been prepared for a pathogen which has been known about for nearly forty years. The current EBOV outbreak is already proving remarkably costly in terms of the mortality and financial ramifications\n1,\n2. The best approaches to EBOV so far have relied on public health measures for containment\n3 which have been used in past outbreaks\n4. These lessons with EBOV will undoubtedly be important for the next virus outbreak\n5 but they also raise many questions\n6 which point to how little we know about these viruses in general, as well as how best to share knowledge openly\n7.",

Two recent studies utilized high-throughput screens of a subset of FDA approved drugs against different EBOV strains (Zaire and Sudan)\nin vitro and\nin vivo. These independent reports suggested the promise of the antimalarials amodiaquine and chloroquine in one study\n8, while the selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) clomiphene and toremifene were active in another\n9. Chloroquine to date has not progressed beyond the mouse EBOV model used in these studies. We hypothesized that we could use these four molecules to computationally define the features that are important for activity. The previous studies were not exhaustive screens of all FDA drugs and so we have taken this opportunity to suggest additional compounds. Looked at from another perspective \u201cnon-antiviral\u201d drugs may be worth following up even though their molecular mechanism is unknown. These compounds may themselves have broad antiviral activity as reports describe modest inhibitory activity against other viruses\n10\u2013\n13.",

Another good example is the recent\nin silico docking of 5.4 million drug-like compounds docked in the viral protein VP35 protein\n15. This identified multiple pyrrolidinones which inhibit its polymerase cofactor activity\n15. The pyrrolidinones bind to an alpha helix which is proposed as important for viral function\n16.

Candidate predicted actives may be assessed by their Fit Value to the pharmacophore model. This score can be used to prioritize compounds for eventual testing. In the current study it was hypothesized that two different classes of compounds showing activity against EBOV\nin vitro and\nin vivo may share a common pharmacophore. Construction of this pharmacophore (\nFigure 1) indicated four hydrophobic features and a hydrogen bond acceptor feature. This pharmacophore (with an added van der Waals surface to limit the number of hits retrieved) was then used to screen and score other FDA drugs from a small database and identified 120 and 124 structures for future evaluation\nin vitro testing (\nSupplemental Table 2 and\nSupplemental Table 3). Out of these compounds estradiol and dibucaine had been previously described as active in\nin vitro EBOV assays. This suggested the pharmacophore could retrieve some structurally diverse classes of known hits\n8.",

These nine receptor-ligand pharmacophores suggested the importance of hydrophobic, hydrogen bonding and negative ionizable interactions to interfere with this protein-protein interaction (\nTable 1). Eight out of nine of the pharmacophores had one or more hydrogen bond acceptor feature. These pharmacophores are grossly similar to our ligand based pharmacophore (derived from four FDA approved drugs that inhibit EBOV), as both types of model had multiple hydrophobic features and at least one hydrogen bond acceptor. When we docked the antimalarials and SERMs into a representative VP35 structure these compounds were found to overlap with the X-ray ligand to differing extents. Amodiaquine and chloroquine had LibDock scores greater than 90 and higher than that for the redocked X-ray ligand. This indicated that VP35 may be a potential target for these two distinct classes of compounds. However, it is important to point out that we have not compared docking to other proteins in EBOV and it could also be possible that these molecules are active elsewhere as well as via other mechanisms than by specific binding to proteins\n28,\n29. Further, VP35 may be a preferred target for the antimalarials while the SERMs are not predicted to bind as well as the X-ray ligand. The use of other docking and scoring methods may produce differences in the pose and predicted binding affinity, which could be of interest for further studies.",

            "text": "In summary, this study has built on the previous publications that identified four FDA approved compounds active against different strains of EBOV\n8,\n9. Our pharmacophore model for SERMs and aminoquinolines suggests that these compounds share multiple chemical features based on their overlap to the four hydrophobic features and a hydrogen bond acceptor (\nFigure 1E) and they may have a common mechanism or target. We suggest that VP35 may be the likely target based on the overlap of receptor-based pharmacophores and docking into the crystal structure. Amodiaquine and chloroquine score particularly well in terms of docking to VP35. If this is the case it could provide a means to follow up with other small molecule analogs and/or additional FDA approved drugs that could target this protein-protein interaction. As with our other tuberculosis-focused research\n32,\n33, and computational approaches to repositioning compounds\n34 we embrace the essentiality for computational predictions to be interrogated through rigorous experimental studies. For example at least two\nin silico docking studies screened commercially available compounds\n14,\n15. We propose that docking FDA approved drugs could also be a viable first step to identifying potential compounds that could be used. We are actively seeking collaborators with experience with EBOV assays to enable further translational studies. We believe this computationally inspired approach may be applicable for other known infectious pathogens that do not have current treatments such as other viruses related to Ebola. Ultimately we need to be able to leverage such approaches to provide antivirals for future pathogens.",
