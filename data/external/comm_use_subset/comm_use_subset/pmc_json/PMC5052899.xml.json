(2) The first known ZIKV outbreak occurred in 2007 in Yap state of the Federated States of Micronesia (1) in the World Health Organization (WHO) Western Pacific Region followed by a 2013\u20132014 outbreak in French Polynesia with an estimated 32 000 cases. (3) The virus has gone on to cause outbreaks in multiple Pacific island countries and has spread throughout the Americas. (1) In November 2015, Brazil began reporting substantial increases in the number of children born with microcephaly in ZIKV-affected areas. (4) That evidence, coupled with reports of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome cases in other ZIKV outbreaks, particularly in French Polynesia, led WHO on 1 February 2016 to declare that the cluster of microcephaly cases and other neurological disorders constituted a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). (5) Among the recommendations from that meeting of the International Health Regulations (2005) Emergency Committee were that \u201csurveillance for ZIKV infection should be enhanced, with the dissemination of standard case definitions and diagnostics to at-risk areas.\u201d (6)",

Serological diagnosis of ZIKV infection by immunoglobulin M (IgM) and/or immunoglobulin G (IgG) detection was also surveyed in the 19 countries, with less than one third (6/19) reporting having this capacity.
