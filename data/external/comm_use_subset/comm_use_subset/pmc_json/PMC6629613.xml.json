KYNA reportedly acts as an antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors2,3 and the \u03b1-7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (\u03b17nAChR)4,5. Furthermore, previous studies in animal models show that elevated KYNA levels in the brain impair cognitive function6, spatial working memory7 and auditory sensory gating8 in rats. Abnormally high KYNA levels have been observed in brain tissues and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) from patients with schizophrenia9\u201311. Therefore, physiological control of brain KYNA levels is likely critical to the prevention of these conditions1.",

PF-04859989 and BFF-122 also act as KAT2 inhibitors by irreversibly binding to the PLP cofactor15,16. However, because over 300 PLP-dependent enzymes and proteins have been identified, irreversible binding to PLP may cause side effects. For example, carbidopa is used for the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease, but causes adverse effects due to irreversible binding to PLP24,25.",

We then screened for KAT2 inhibitors from approximately 13,000 compounds using a high-throughput screening assay. These experiments identified approximately 20 candidate KAT2 inhibitors (data not shown), including glycyrrhizic acid (GL) and its analogues, glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) and carbenoxolone (CBX) (Fig. 2). The basic structures of these three compounds are similar. GL comprises GA and two glucuronic acid molecules27,28, whereas CBX is a derivative of GA29. GL is also the main component of liquorice, which is a component of the traditional Japanese medicine yokukansan30. Previous reports show that yokukansan alleviates psychological symptoms of schizophrenia31,32 and the behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia in patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and Lewy bodies33 and improves cognitive function in patients with senile dementia34,35. Thus, GL, GA and CBX may be KAT2 inhibitors with efficacy in treatment of mental disorders.",

Additionally, we then compared inhibitory properties of these compounds with those of the KAT2 inhibitor PF-04859989, which binds PLP irreversibly. PF-04859989 was used at its IC50 value of 300 nM, as determined in our assays. Because PF-04859989 binds to PLP, maximum reaction rates (Vmax) varied but the Michaelis\u2013Menten constant (Km) did not change (Fig. 4a). In contrast, Km values for GL, GA and CBX changed with substrate concentrations, whereas respective Vmax values did not vary under these conditions (Fig. 4b\u2013d). These results showed that GL, GA and CBX do not bind PLP, but act as competitive inhibitors of KYN.",

For comparison, we also present a crystal structure from the protein data bank (PDB; PDB ID, 2R2N) in Fig. 5a. All ligands were located in the ligand-binding pocket of two KAT2 molecules. To elucidate the interactions between KAT2 and these ligands, we magnified the structures of ligand-binding pockets (Fig. 6), and identified residues that are involved in hydrogen-bond formation and stacking, as shown in Fig. 7. In these figures, the subunits A and B are shown in green and cyan, respectively. In the crystal structure of 2R2N, KYN forms hydrogen bonds with Asn202(B) and Arg399(B) (Figs 6a and 7a), and the binding structure is stabilised by a \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions between the aromatic ring of KYN and the Tyr74(A) side chain. Although GL formed a hydrogen bond with Ser77(A), no hydrogen bonds were observed between GL and Asn202(B) or Arg399(B) (Figs 6b and 7b). Yet CH-\u03c0 stacking interactions with Tyr74(A) may stabilise the binding structure. The hydrophobic moiety of GL was located on hydrophobic surfaces comprising Leu40(A), Tyr74(A), Pro76(A) and Gln73(A) and the carbohydrate chain of GL was located outside of the ligand-binding pocket. Similarly, the hydrophobic moiety of GA was located on the hydrophobic surface of Leu40(A), Tyr74(A), Pro76(A) and Gln73(A) (Fig. 6c), and the binding structure of GA favours stabilisation by CH-\u03c0 stacking interactions with Tyr74(A) (Fig. 7c). Although GA formed no hydrogen bonds with Asn202(B), Arg399(B) or Ser77(A), hydrogen bonds with Gly39(A) and Tyr142(B) were observed. The docking pose of CBX, which had a similar IC50 value to that of GL, was also similar to that of GL (Figs 6d and 7d). Moreover, the residues required for stabilisation of ligand binding by hydrophobic effects and stacking interactions were conserved among GL and its analogues (Table 2). In particular, Tyr74 is considered one of the most important residues for ligand binding.",

The IC50 values of these compounds (GL, GA and CBX) were low \u03bcM range on human KAT2 (Table 1). Although these IC50 values were determined at the basic conditions (pH9.5) to obtain the optimal fluorescence26, at the physiological conditions (pH 7.4), we confirmed that the IC50 values of GL, GA and CBX on human KAT2 were almost the same as those of pH9.5 (7.93 \u00b1 0.17 \u03bcM, 9.87 \u00b1 0.32 \u03bcM, and 3.34 \u00b1 0.25 \u03bcM, respectively). We also showed that these compounds are highly selective for KAT2 among KAT isozymes and compete with its substrate KYN. Furthermore, we predicted complex structures using docking calculations and located GL, GA and CBX on the same surface as the aromatic ring of KYN. These docking structures suggest that the high inhibitory activities of GL and its analogues reflect larger hydrophobic interfaces with KAT2 than with KAT2-KYN. In agreement, the hydrophobic effects of Leu40 and Tyr74 are common among KAT2 inhibitors that are described in previous studies15,16,40,41. Furthermore, Gly39 forms a hydrogen bond with GA and with BFF-12216 and the hydrogen bond between the inhibitor and Tyr142 of the KAT2-GA complex was also formed in the complex of KAT2 and NS-15024. In contrast, the hydrogen bond with Ser77 is unique to docking structures of GL and CBX. Yet the carbohydrate chain of GL, which is located outside of the ligand-binding pocket, is not likely to affect the affinity for KAT2. Because these inhibitors merely alter PLP binding, the risks of side effects may be minimised in comparison with those of PF-04859989 and BFF-122, which inhibit KAT2 by forming covalent adducts with PLP. In addition, compared with S-ESBA and NS-1502, which exhibit reversible inhibitory effects, GL, GA and CBX have potent inhibitory activities. Therefore, we successfully identified three new KAT2 inhibitors that are superior to other KAT2 inhibitors.",

These differences may arise from differences in conserved residues among species. Accordingly, in the sequence alignments of mouse, rat and human KAT2 reported by Pellicciari et al., sequence variants in human and rat KAT2 were associated with relative inhibitory activities of S-ESBA38. Our computational docking study shows that the hydrophobic effects of Leu40 in human KAT2 are important for its interactions with GL and its analogues (Table 2). Among residues that participate in binding of human KAT2 to GL and its analogues, Leu40 is substituted to Ser in mouse KAT2. We speculate that this difference undermines the inhibitory effects of GL and its analogues on mouse KAT2.",

Because KYNA is predominantly generated by KAT2 in brain tissues12\u201314, specific inhibitors of KAT2 are eagerly awaited. Rossi, F. et al. solved the crystal structures of human KAT1 and KAT2, and showed important structural differences that could be exploited in the rational design of highly selective KAT2 inhibitors42\u201345. In particular, human KAT1 and KAT2 share 15% overall sequence identity, and structural analyses of their active sites revealed striking differences in substrate binding pockets42,45 (for review see43,44). We also demonstrated that hydrophobic interactions between Leu40(A) and Tyr74(A) with GL and its analogues are similar to those of the KAT2 inhibitors reported in previous studies. But we suggest that Pro76(A) and Gln73(A) are additional unique residues that interact with GL and its analogues (Table 2). These residues may be involved in the selective inhibitory effects of GL and its analogues for human KAT2. Although the mechanisms through which GL and its analogues specifically inhibit KAT2 remain unknown, these structural differences between KAT isozymes and the unique residues that interact with GL and its analogues are likely mediators of specificity. Hence, the present observations can be used to inform the rational design of specific and competitive KAT2 inhibitors.",
