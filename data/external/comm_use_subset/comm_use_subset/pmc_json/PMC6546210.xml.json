            "text": "Acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRI) are responsible for the death of approximately 160,000 neonates and over 760,000 infants annually [1].Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus (RV) are the most frequent causes of acute respiratory infections in children [2\u20134].Primary RSV infections may lead to severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia [5]. RV usually causes rhinopharyngitis[6], but may also cause illness of the lower respiratory tract and asthma exacerbations, and has been associated with severe ALRI in young children [7,8]. A few studies have investigated the viral profile in children attending the pediatric emergency room (ER) with ALRI and its association with disease severity [9\u201312], but finding vary. Moreover, the role of viral co-infections in illness severity has been controversial [10, 12, 13\u201315]. In young children who presented to an outpatient clinic or ER in Japan with acute respiratory illness, RSV, RV, parainfluenza viruses (PIV) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) were the most prevalent viruses. Similarly to what was found in a previous study in Brazil [4], detection of RSV, alone or in co-detections, was associated with increased disease severity in children in Japan [9]. In Seattle, USA, RV was the most frequent virus detected in children less than three years old presenting to the ER with ALRI, and 52% of them required hospital admission [10]. In addition, RV viral load and co-detection with RSV was associated with more severe disease in that study [10]. In children younger than two years old who presented to a pediatric ER with ALRI in Malaysia, RSV and RV were the most frequently detected viruses and, although RSV was associated with a history of wheezing, virus detection was not associated with need for hospitalization [11]. In The Netherlands, the most frequent viruses detected in children presenting to the ER or outpatient clinic with ALRI were RSV, RV and human coronavirus (HCoV), and RSV detection correlated with longer duration of oxygen therapy [12]. However, there was no association between the virus species and hospital length of stay, and virus co-detections were not associated with disease outcome [12].In the present study, a comprehensive polymerase-chain-reaction(PCR) panel of primers and probes was used to detect respiratory viruses, enabling virus identification to the species level, in respiratory samples collected from children younger than three years with ALRI seen at the pediatric ER and subsequently admitted to hospital. Association of different respiratory viruses with disease severity, defined as need for admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), was assessed.",

All consecutive children younger than three years attending the pediatric emergency room with ALRI who were admitted to hospital from June 1st, 2008 to May 31st, 2009were eligible for the study. ALRI was defined by the presence of cough, tachypnea, respiratory distress with prolonged expiratory time, and wheezing or crackles on auscultation. Patients with a diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia as indicated by clinical presentation and chest X-ray findings or a positive blood culture were excluded from analysis.",

All PCR assays were performed using only one set of primers-probe per reaction, except for RSV and HMPV detection, which were tested in duplex format. Human bocavirus (HBoV) and human adenovirus (HAdV) were detected by qPCR in a single format assay (http://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.w8yfhxw).

Simple and multiple log-binomial regression models were constructed to assess associations of virus type with need for PICU admission. Relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were obtained after adjusting log-binomial regression models. Initially, simple log-binomial regression models were fitted, resulting in crude relative risks. Subsequently, the adjustment of multiple log-binomial regression models considering age, prematurity, the presence of an underlying disease and congenital heart disease as covariates, resulted in adjusted relative risks [21].

In keeping with this, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis showed that respiratory viral coinfection was not associated with need for hospitalization, intensive care admission or length of stay in children [15]. In addition, the number of detected viruses has not been associated with illness severity [14]. Indeed, surprisingly, an inverse correlation between the clinical severity score and the number of viruses detected has been observed [23]. Nevertheless, a previous study performed in Southeast Brazil showed that coinfections, especially involving RSV, were associated with increased severity [13].
