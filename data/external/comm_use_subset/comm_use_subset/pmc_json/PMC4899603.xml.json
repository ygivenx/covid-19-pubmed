            "text": "Since its inception in the late 1980s, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been the mainstay technique for the amplification of nucleic acids. Although PCR-based testing in laboratories is well established and extremely successful, the reliance of PCR on precise thermal control (at relatively high and rapidly changing\u2014or \u201ccycling\u201d\u2014temperatures; Figure 1(a)) has limited its use outside of centralized facilities. The thermocycling equipment used in PCR is expensive, particularly as suitable detection technologies have to be integrated with the amplification itself. Recent efforts to miniaturize and simplify PCR instrumentation have been reported [10\u201312]; however, these approaches have their limitations and have not been adopted in practice [13]. The limitations inherent in PCR make this method generally unsuitable for providing cost-effective access of molecular diagnostics to most end-users and have generally limited the adoption of NAAT-based diagnostic devices in point-of-use (POU)/point-of-care (POC) settings when dealing with noncentralized sample testing. Novel NAATs such as the isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) [14], developed by TwistDx (Cambridge, UK), overcome the disadvantages of PCR-based technologies. RPA provides an inexpensive, fast, real-time, and reliable alternative POU/POC method that employs use of crude DNA preparation and simple field-deployable detection devices. Other technologies employing a constant temperature to facilitate the amplification of nucleic acids targets have also been reported in the literature. In contrast to PCR, the use of these isothermal technologies reduces the need for sophisticated instrumentation, consistent electrical power supply, and complex sample processing protocols [15, 16]. In addition to RPA, technologies utilizing amplification of nucleic acid targets at constant temperature such as nicking enzyme amplification reaction (NEAR) [17], loop mediated amplification (LAMP) [18], nucleic acid sequence based amplification (NASBA) [19], helicase dependent amplification (HDA) [20], and cross priming amplification (CPA) [21] have been reported in the literature. RPA is unique within this class of molecular methods in its combination of high performance (sensitivity and specificity of detection), low temperature operation, and overall robustness to temperature fluctuations [16, 22].",

Binding of GP32 to the oligos is followed by UvsY and finally UvsX, the recombinase. The UvsX/oligo complex searches the template DNA for homologous sequences and subsequently extends the primers. Target amplification is detected with a dual labeled oligonucleotide probe, containing a fluorophore (either TAMRA or FAM) and quencher separated by an abasic site (Table 1), of complimentary sequence. When the probe binds to the amplified target DNA, exonuclease III cleaves the abasic site, and the fluorophore and quencher are separated resulting in a fluorescence signal proportional to the amount of amplified target DNA.",

LFD-based screening is used at different points in the grain trade, including farms, grain elevators, and ports to test for different GMO traits to support consumer preferences and trade requirements. However, ongoing improvements to GMO crops have resulted in the introduction of given transgenes, such as the gene for expressing the glyphosate-tolerant CP4 variant of 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (CP4 EPSPS), into multiple GMO crops, in which case protein-based detection methods cannot distinguish between these various products. In addition, many new GMO crops involve the combination by conventional breeding of two or more transgenic events (i.e., single-locus insertions) to offer combinations of insect and herbicide tolerance genes to combat a wider range of pests and weeds than covered by the single events [30, 33]. Additionally, other new GMO crops do not express a protein to achieve the intended trait (for e.g., Vistive\u00ae Gold Soybean). In all of these new GMO crops, protein-based detection methods, such as LFD, cannot differentiate the various traits for field detection.",

            "text": "A time course experiment was performed to address the long-term storage stability of the RPA formulation. Many of the reagents that are critical for the RPA assay performance (such as proteins, oligonucleotides, and nucleotides) are potentially unstable, some of them even under refrigerated conditions, and are, therefore, provided in a lyophilized format as preformulated reaction pellets in microcentrifuge PCR strip tubes. Each strip of lyophilized RPA pellets was vacuum-sealed in a foil pouch. Sealed strips of lyophilized RPA reaction pellets were stored at different temperatures: in a freezer (<\u221215\u00b0C), in a refrigerator (2\u20138\u00b0C), at room temperature (RT; 22\u201328\u00b0C), and in an incubator (35\u201340\u00b0C). Eight reaction tubes from the respective storage temperature were tested for assay performance at regular intervals over a period of one year. RPA assays for the lec target were stable for one year in a freezer or refrigerator or at RT (Figure 4(b)). However, the performance of lec amplification/detection shown by pellets stored at elevated temperature in an incubator decreased after 20 weeks (Figure 4(b)). The RR2Y specific assay components were stable for the entire year when the pellets were stored in a refrigerator or a freezer. There was a pronounced drop in activity of the pellets with regard to the RR2Y assay, when the pellets were stored at RT. RR2Y assay performance, similar to the lec assay, dropped below useful levels, when the reaction pellets were stored at elevated temperatures in an incubator for 20 weeks or longer. In summary, RR2Y RPA reactions in the formulation tested are stable when stored in a freezer or refrigerator for up to one year and at RT for up to six months (Figure 4(a)). Increased stability characteristics may be achieved by introducing changes to the manufacturing process to increase dryness of the reaction pellets, or by changes to the reaction formulation, for example, by the inclusion of suitable additives. This is currently subject of further investigation and optimization.",

The current benchmark for field testing involves protein-based LFD that detects the presence of the target protein in crude seed extracts (Figure 5(a)). The unique DNA insertions in the RR1 and RR2Y genomes code for the same CP4 EPSPS protein which confers resistance to the herbicide Roundup. RR1, RR2Y, and conventional soybean seed extracts were tested using CP4 EPSPS specific protein strips. A faint pink line was observed with both RR1 and RR2Y seed samples in addition to the dark pink Control band seen with all the samples. Conventional seed samples showed development of Control band but not the test band, suggesting the test was performed appropriately and the conventional soybean sample is negative for the Roundup Ready trait (Figure 5(a)). In the POU setting, time and resources do not permit a laboratory-standard purification of genomic DNA from the seed samples. To utilize the RR2Y RPA assay as a field detection method, the reaction should be performed with simply derived seed extracts as the template material. Procedures were standardized to perform the RPA reactions starting with ground soybean seed as the source material (Figure 5(b)).",

The ability of RPA assays to detect DNA sequences unique to GMO crops provides an advantage over LFD for GMO crops that share the same protein. RPA assays also have intrinsic advantages over PCR assays. RPA assays are simpler, easier, and faster than PCR assays for an end-user. Instrumentation used for the RPA-based assays is relatively cheaper than a PCR thermocycler, largely owing to the isothermal nature of the RPA reaction. In particular, the current report presents an RPA-based field detection method that can specifically detect RR2Y soybean. The assay was developed in a duplex format allowing simultaneous detection of the endogenous lec gene as a control with soybean samples, irrespective of the specific trait(s) of interest for a given RPA assay.",
