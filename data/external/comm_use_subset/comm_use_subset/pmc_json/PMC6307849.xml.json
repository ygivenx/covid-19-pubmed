However, BCG does not provide adequate protection for all age groups, particularly in adults.2 With the constant emergence of multidrug\u2010resistant strains, prevention of M.tb infection is the most promising and cost\u2010effective approach to reducing the TB epidemic.3 Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of an effective vaccination strategy to protect against M.tb infections.",

When these memory cells re\u2010encounter a cognate antigen, they mount a robust and rapid response to control the infection at early stage.4 In the case of a M.tb infection, there are more CD4+ T cells than CD8+ T cells at the sites of infection, and the CD4+ T cells have been shown to play multiple roles in initiating and propagating the T\u2010cell responses in animal models and human cases.5, 6 CD4+ T cells with effector or effector\u2013memory phenotype played a major role in controlling the mycobacteria at site of infection and limited progression of the disease.7 Some of them had a phenotype of CD44+CD62Llow,8 and produced Th1\u2010type cytokines, such as IFN\u2010\u03b3, TNF\u2010\u03b1, and IL\u20102. These effector cytokines eliminated the infected cells and controlled M.tb replication.9, 10 Thus, many vaccine developments have been focused on identifying new CD4+ T\u2010cell epitopes inducing Th1\u2010type responses, or modifying BCG to improve efficacy for providing a broader protection.11, 12 Among them, ESAT\u20106 and CFP\u201010, which induce dominant Th1\u2010type CD4+ T\u2010cell responses, have been evaluated and shown potentially protective effects. The ESAT\u20106, formatted as an ESAT\u20106\u2010Ag85 fusion protein, promoted strong and long\u2010lived M.tb\u2010specific T\u2010cell responses in na\u00efve human volunteers13, 14; the CFP\u201010, previously used for disease diagnosis, could induce IFN\u2010\u03b3 release and reduce IL\u20104 secretion of CD4+ T cells, as well as promote antibody response with an enhanced IgG2a/IgG1 ratio in mice.15 Although the evaluation is ongoing, establishment of adaptive Th1\u2010type CD4+ T\u2010cell response with effector or effector\u2013memory phenotype is one of the targets for vaccine development to prevent TB.",

Although the protection induced by subcutaneous immunization with Rv3615c was modest to virulent M.tb challenge, these data suggest the potential of Rv3615c as a vaccine candidate for inducing adaptive immunity beyond those elicited by BCG. Following previous studies, here, we use mouse model to explore if immunization with Rv3615c intranasally promotes sustained memory CD4+ T\u2010cell response in airway compartment locally, and to examine the profile of T\u2010cell response by comparing with those induced by subcutaneous immunization. Our study can provide information for rational design and inoculation route of a TB vaccine.",

To extend our knowledge, here, we used a mouse model to demonstrate that Rv3615c immunization not only elicited a Th1\u2010type response, but also induced memory differentiation of CD4+ T cells. We identified that Rv3615c contained an epitope of mouse CD4+ T cells, which is located within amino acids 41\u201050 (Rv3615c41\u201050) and is differed from epitopes of human CD4+ T cells, as we have previously reported. The quantity of IFN\u2010\u03b3 and number of IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010producing cells induced by Rv3615c41\u201050 were the same as those induced by full\u2010length Rv3615c and mixture of overlapping peptides. Although a few CD4\u2212 T cells expressed IFN\u2010\u03b3, the frequency was low. Thus, we demonstrated the Rv3615c41\u201050 containing a dominant epitope of mouse CD4+ T cells. After prime and boost with Rv3615c, the cytokine\u2010producing cells peaked at week 4. Most of the cytokine\u2010producing cells expressed IFN\u2010\u03b3 and TNF\u2010\u03b1; some of them expressed IL\u201017 and IL\u20102 in the spleen, lung, and LN. A few of them expressed IL\u20104, but the IL\u20104 production was only transient.

Different immunization routes utilize different subsets of antigen\u2010presenting cells, and consequently activate different subsets of CD4+ T cells at their specific tissue compartment26; establishing a long\u2010term resident CD4+ memory T\u2010cell population in barrier tissues through local immunization promoted regional immunity and demonstrated a key point for vaccine design.4, 41 S.C. immunization expanded Rv3615c\u2010specific CD4+ T cells systemically, in terms of elevated cytokines in serum, frequency of cytokine\u2010expressing cells, and quantity of cytokines in the lung, spleen, and LN tissues. Additionally, the cytokine\u2010expressing cells in the lungs were mostly in the vasculature, indicating a circulatory status. In contrast, I.N. immunization preferably elevated cytokines and cytokine\u2010producing cells in BALF and LP, suggesting a status of tissue residency. The quantity of cytokines and frequency of cytokine\u2010producing cells in lung were higher than those in the spleen and LN, and higher than those induced by S.C. immunization. In addition, I.N. immunization promoted not only regional immunity in the respiratory compartment but also systemic immunity, in terms of increased frequency of cytokine\u2010producing cells and cytokine productions in the spleen and LN at the level comparable to that induced by S.C. immunization. I.N. immunization with Rv3615c also established a sustained adaptive B\u2010cell immunity in the airway. The elevated Rv3615c\u2010specific antibodies in sIgA, IgA, IgG1, and IgG2a isotypes were maintained in BALF for at least 8\u201012 weeks post the prime and boost, and antibodies in IgM isotype were maintained for at least 6 weeks. I.N. immunization also elevated Rv3615c\u2010specific sIgA and IgA in serum, while S.C. immunization had no significant impact on antibody levels in BALF but elevated Rv3615c\u2010specific IgG1 and IgG2a only in serum. Although the role of antibody response on preventing M.tb infection and in eradicating the pathogen is still in debate and requires further investigation,42, 43 our study has demonstrated that I.N. immunization establishes a sustained adaptive immunity in the respiratory tract and in lung tissue, posing an advantageous response to pathogenic invasion without time\u2010consuming recruitment of effector cells from peripheral lymphoid tissues.44\n",

The use of CpG was based on our experience and previous studies.49 The adjuvant might activate the innate immune system, lower the threshold for signalling of activation, and reduce the quantity of antigen required for initiating an immune response.36 We have not, here, tried to figure out the mechanism of CpG's promoting of magnitude and altering of pattern of response to Rv3615c. Also, we have not distinguished if our I.N. prime and boost selectively expanded precursors of effector\u2013memory CD4+ T cells in the respiratory tissue compartment or initiated migration and differentiation of na\u00efve cells in peripheral lymphoid tissues, although the magnitude of response was relatively low in the lymphoid tissues. However, as an extension to our previous investigation, we have demonstrated that I.N. immunization with Rv3615c establishes a sustained adaptive immunity and a potential of rapid response to M.tb infections in the local respiratory system. The I.N. inoculation is not novel for test of TB and other vaccinations. To our knowledge, there are few, if any, reports on Rv3615c\u2010induced responses induced by I.N. in mouse model. We believe that our data provide information to support further investigation of the Rv315c as a vaccine candidate delivered by alternative routes. Limited by biosafety regulations, we are not qualified to test if immunization with Rv3615c could protect mice from a virulent M.tb challenge, and the potential of inducing sustainable adaptive immunity in humans requires further clinical study. The benefit of inducing effector\u2013memory CD4+ T cells with multicytokine production and a tissue\u2010resident property remain unclear in the context of this mouse model. Since M.tb proteins are expressed at different stages of the infection and induce distinct immune responses,50 immunization with Rv3615c elicits additional protection beyond those induced by BCG. We propose that a sustained vaccine\u2010induced CD4+ T\u2010cell response against a broad spectrum of targets, and with diverse functionalities, provides a better protection compared to a narrow response. Our study provides important information related to inducing broad spectrum and quality immunity against M.tb infections, and sheds light on the rational design of vaccines.",
