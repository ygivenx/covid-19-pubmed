            "text": "In eukaryotic cells, histones play important roles in genomic DNA packaging as well as epigenetic regulation of gene expression. The levels of histone mRNAs are carefully controlled throughout the cell cycle and they dramatically increase during S phase to meet the growing demand for packaging the newly replicated DNA from the replicating genome [1]. In metazoans, histone proteins for packaging of newly synthesized DNA are encoded by the replication-dependent histone genes. They are distinct from the replication-independent histone genes which are expressed constitutively [2]. Unlike canonical pre-mRNAs, replication-dependent histone pre-mRNAs lack introns and undergo 3\u2019-end processing that differs from cleavage coupled to polyadenylation. Histone pre-mRNAs contain two sequence elements essential for their 3\u2019-end processing: a highly-conserved stem-loop structure and a purine-rich histone downstream element (HDE). Cleavage occurs between these two sequence elements and the polyadenylation step is omitted, giving rise to mature histone mRNAs that end with the stem-loop followed by a 4\u20135 nucleotide tail.",

SLBP binds the 3\u2019 stem-loop in the pre-mRNA and remains bound after mRNA maturation, and functions in translation [7, 8]. The 3\u2019 stem-loop also recruits the 3\u2019-5\u2019 exoribonuclease 3\u2019hExo [9, 10], which is not essential for processing [11] but trims the processed histone mRNAs and initiates degradation of histone mRNAs in the cytoplasm [12]. The core U7 snRNP consists of two integral and stably associated components: ~60-nucleotide U7 snRNA and a unique Sm ring, which contains Lsm10 and Lsm11 in place of the spliceosomal SmD1 and SmD2 [13, 14]. The U7 snRNP recognizes the pre-mRNA through base-pairing between the 5\u2019-end of U7 snRNA and the HDE [15, 16]. SLBP bound to the upstream stem-loop stabilizes this interaction, likely by directly or indirectly contacting a subunit(s) of U7 snRNP [17].",

Through yeast two-hybrid and pull-down studies, this region was found to interact with the N-terminal region of FLASH (Fig 1B) [3]. FLASH, Flice-associated huge protein, was originally discovered as a protein involved in Fas-mediated apoptosis [18] and later in regulation of expression of several genes, including oncogenes [19, 20]. Subsequent studies showed that FLASH localizes to Histone Locus Bodies in the nucleus, suggesting a role in expression of histone genes [21], and that it is essential for histone pre-mRNA processing [3].",

The structure showed that FLASH NTD forms a coiled-coil dimer consisting of two parallel \u03b1-helices, one from each protomer (Fig 2A). However, only residues 71 to 137 were observed in this structure, even though the expression construct contained residues 51\u2013137.

The protomers do not superimpose perfectly onto each other (r.m.s.d. ~1.5 \u00c5), and one of them appears to adopt a straighter conformation (S1 Fig).

The majority of the FLASH dimer interface residues are leucines and isoleucines, forming the bulk of the hydrophobic interactions (Fig 2A). The leucines and isoleucines are interspersed with other residues that form either polar or non-polar interactions. Other hydrophobic interactions are formed by bulky residues such as Tyr73, Tyr80, and Phe94, as well as Met87 (selenomethionine in this structure). Hydrophilic interactions include residues Gln100/Asn101 and Glu107/Asn108 near the mid-section of the structure (Fig 2B), and an ion pair between Lys129 and Asp130 at the C-terminal end of the coiled-coil (Fig 2A).",

Previous pull-down studies showed that substituting Leu118 and Ile119 with alanines abolished the ability of FLASH to bind Lsm11 [28]. According to our FLASH NTD structures, both Leu118 and Ile119 are situated at the dimer interface (Fig 4A). It was possible that these mutations disrupt FLASH NTD dimerization, thereby affecting Lsm11 binding. To test this possibility, we generated the FLASH NTD L118A/I119A mutant in the background of C54S/C83A mutations and investigated its oligomeric state by analytical gel filtration (Fig 4B). Our results showed that this mutant had a similar migration behavior as the C54S/C83A mutant control, indicating that the deleterious effect of L118A/I119A mutation on binding Lsm11 is not due to the disruption of FLASH NTD dimerization.",

As a control, we made the K88A/K92A/K95A mutant, changing three residues located outside of the dimer interface. As expected, the migration behavior of this mutant was nearly the same as that for the C54S/C83A protein (Fig 4B).

We co-expressed FLASH NTD C54S/C83A double mutant and His-tagged Lsm11 NTD (residues 23\u2013130) in E. coli and purified their complex, demonstrating a stable interaction between the two proteins (S2 Fig). Extensive efforts at producing diffraction quality crystals of the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex have so far been unsuccessful. To obtain estimates for the molar masses of the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex as well as the FLASH NTD C54S/C83A mutant alone, we performed size exclusion chromatography multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) experiments using buffers with high (500 mM) and low (250 mM) NaCl concentrations (Fig 5, S3 Fig). At high-salt concentration, both the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex and FLASH NTD alone eluted in single peaks. However, the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex peak had a trailing edge, suggesting some dissociation of the complex during chromatography. The weight-averaged molar masses of the samples eluting in the peaks are 31 kDa for the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex (with a Stokes radius of 3.9 nm) and 21 kDa for FLASH NTD C54S/C83A mutant alone (with a Stokes radius of 3.4 nm). The molar mass of the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex decreased gradually from 34.4 kDa (leading edge of peak) to 26.0 kDa (trailing edge of peak). For FLASH NTD C54S/C83A, the molar mass decreased slightly from 21.7 kDa (leading edge) to 20.8 kDa (trailing edge), indicating that it formed a stable dimer.",

The higher oligomers became less apparent at lower concentration (0.01 mg/mL) of the protein, suggesting that they are probably due to random collisions of monomer/dimer in solution. Dimer and trimer species were also observed for the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex but Lsm11 NTD did not appear to be substantially crosslinked to FLASH or to itself, possibly due to the fact that it has only one lysine residue. Therefore, we conclude that the dimer and trimer species for the complex were probably crosslinked FLASH, as observed for the FLASH alone samples, and the cross-linking experiments by themselves did not provide conclusive information about the stoichiometry of FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex.",

These data, in conjunction with our current crystallographic study, strongly support the notion that the N-terminal domain of FLASH exists in solution as a coiled-coil dimer. We changed up to three consecutive residues in the dimer interface but failed to convert FLASH into monomers. The dimer interface of the FLASH NTD is extensive and local structural disturbances, such as the three consecutive residues that we mutated, are insufficient to prevent dimerization. Interestingly, the L118A/I119A mutation in the interface of the coiled-coil dimer failed to disrupt FLASH dimerization but was sufficient to abolish the ability of FLASH to interact with Lsm11.",

SEC-MALS experiments on the complex provided strong evidence that the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex is a 2:1 heterotrimer. While our AUC data confirmed that FLASH is a dimer, the stoichiometry of FLASH and Lsm11 in the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex was less clear, likely due to dissociation of Lsm11 NTD from the FLASH NTD dimer during prolonged ultracentrifugation. Some dissociation of the complex was observed during the short time scale of the SEC-MALS experiment. That Lsm11 interacts with a FLASH dimer is also consistent with the data from H/D exchange experiments. While the region between amino acids 100\u2013120 showed the slowest H/D exchange within the entire FLASH NTD (which we show here can form a dimer), this region underwent slower H/D exchange in the presence of Lsm11 and the reduced rate of exchange extended to amino acid 130 in FLASH [33]. Since H/D exchange occurs when hydrogen bonds are temporarily destabilized, this region of FLASH (residues 100\u2013130) is in a more stable structure in the heterotrimer than in the homodimer.",

In animal cells, components of the transcription and 3\u2019-end processing machinery are localized in Histone Locus Bodies (HLBs), nuclear domains that assemble at histone gene loci and are present throughout the cell cycle. Strikingly, histone gene expression is repressed during G1 phase and becomes activated only with the onset of S phase and DNA replication in response to cell cycle signals, including cyclin E/CDK2-mediated phosphorylation of NPAT, a universal coactivator of histone gene expression [35\u201339]. A growing body of evidence suggests that FLASH is targeted to HLBs as a separate entity rather than a subunit of the U7 snRNP. For example, mutations in either Lsm11 or FLASH that disrupt binding between their N-terminal domains do not affect localization of either FLASH or U7 snRNP to the Drosophila HLB, but abolishes processing in vivo [40, 41].",
