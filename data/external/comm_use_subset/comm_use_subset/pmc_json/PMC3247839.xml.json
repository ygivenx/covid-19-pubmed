On the other hand, economic globalization is severely straining healthcare resources, preferentially benefiting richer countries [4,5]. The changes in labour flow[5] and trends to deregulation [4,6] also impact the health and well-being of the labour force.

Healthcare acquired infections (HAIs) are often linked to invasive devices, longer hospital stays and more time spent in intensive care [8]. These infections make up a substantial proportion of the infectious disease burden in high income as well as in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) [9]. The risk of a HAI is 2\u201320 times higher in LMICs than in high income countries, and this may be an underestimate, due to differences in the intensity of surveillance [9,10]. An estimated 20% of patients could suffer from preventable HAIs [11]. Along with patients, healthcare workers are also at high risk of exposure to biological agents in healthcare settings [12,13]. Almost half the cases of SARS were in health workers [2], 40% of the hepatitis B and C that occurs in health workers is estimated to be due to occupational exposures [11,14,15], and health workers have a high risk of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis [16].",

In a survey of 1,290 workers across sixteen hospitals in British Columbia the team found that health workers who rated the environmental protective measures highly at their institutions were 12 times more likely to report a high level of compliance with appropriate personal protective practices compared to those who did not rate this factor highly at their institutions. Similarly, those who perceived organizational factors in the workplace to be consistent with safe practices were 10 times more likely to report good compliance. Interestingly, though, there was no association with the individual factors previously thought to be pivotal in affecting compliance [17]. Next, a survey of infection control and occupational health resources and a questionnaire completed by healthcare workers were compared with on-site observational audits in facilities in British Columbia and Ontario. Health workers believed that plans were available to protect against future SARS-like events but audits revealed that these did not exist in many facilities. Both occupational health and infection control were under-resourced post-SARS, with occupational health professionals particularly lacking in British Columbia. There was a discrepancy between health workers\u2019 perception of what was available and what is actually accessible in facilities[18], highlighting the need for better communication.",

Our initial research in Canada also showed that training health workers was significantly associated with health worker perception of a positive safety culture in their healthcare workplace [17,19]. One of the identified constraints was the limited quantity of information that could be presented at group sessions due to the time restrictions. These sessions were insufficient to build knowledge and good practices on the selection and use of personal protective equipment [20]. These research observations were the impetus for our developing online infection control courses that were self-directed, flexible, interactive, and relevant to day-to-day work activities [21,22].",

The workplace assessment tool comprises a list of occupational hazards, including physical, chemical, biological, ergonomic, safety, and psychological hazards. Under each hazard classification, the evaluator completes the workplace assessment form by indicating whether the environment and practices are satisfactory, require correction but are not an immediate hazard, or require immediate correction. Using the results of the questionnaire and needs assessment, local colleagues identified strengths and challenges at each healthcare facility and initiated projects to address the issues unearthed. For example, campaigns were begun to improve hand hygiene and reduce needlestick injuries, as well as implement much-needed renovations in the emergency department of one of the hospitals [25] \u2013 all priorities identified by using the tools developed.",

Again, working closely with local colleagues, we revised the assessment tools, then invited 76 participants to a three-day workshop on occupational health and infection control to complete the initial survey. Invited participants included all the 54 representatives elected from the workforce to serve as health and safety representatives as well as the 16 occupational health and infection control staff members from Pelonomi Hospital, the health facility selected for our pilot study[26]. The participants were then divided into ten groups to conduct workplace audits, covering five domains; Physical Environment, Specific Occupational Health Practices and Hazards, Specific Infection Control Practices, Equipment and Procedures, and Ergonomics. Training sessions were also conducted specifically for medical practitioners, a usually hard-to-reach population, as the Canadian-based research also confirmed[17,19].",

The audit tool is a structured form, which enables healthcare workers to evaluate their working environment in a systematic manner. Health and safety professionals have noted that the tool has enabled them to set priorities and act upon identified needs.

During the pilot phase, the participants expressed high levels of satisfaction towards the training specifically the interactive format and comprehensive content. The online course and tools, such as the workplace assessment, have been presented at various regional and national trainings such as the PAHO train-the-trainer workshops which were held in Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Trinidad and Tobago and Belize. The Latin American and South African work also included development of evidence-based training programs to specifically build capacity of health and safety committees, as our previous research indicated was important [29].

Ironically, perhaps, worker health and safety has not received greater attention in the healthcare sector than in other economic sectors[4], despite the fact that health workers constitute the largest workforce in the world, with an estimated 59 million worldwide [31]. While the tools we produced are limited in conveying an in-depth understanding of the complex global forces that weaken public health systems, hindering the allocation of resources to infection control and worker health, they do help mitigate the impact of resource strains in countries such as Ecuador and South Africa, where strong government commitment has been expressed towards health system improvement and worker well-being.",

Thus it was essential that we involved the local healthcare leadership, already established occupational health services as well as health and safety committee members and governmental-based expertise at the outset. In Ecuador, the project built on a strong partnership between the University of Andina Simon Bolivar, the University of Cuenca, and various other universities and healthcare facilities on one hand, and the various centres at the University of British Columbia on the other. Having a strong local champion is key to success, and Ecuadorean co-author (JB) fulfilled that role. Similarly, we chose Pelonomi Regional Hospital in the Free State as a research pilot site to support knowledge translation and capacity building, in large part due to the local champion.",

The full benefits of these innovations will increasingly manifest over time, but the impact on knowledge, attitudes and practices has already begun to be demonstrated[25].",

Learning from this, before launching the full pilot in South Africa, decision-makers (including co-author LN) started planning for scale-up early, should the pilot prove successful. This required thinking through complexities beyond the pilot, such as who will continue to implement and monitor the model after the pilot has ended, and how should the model be altered in the pilot with such questions in mind. By working closely with the WHO, the International Labour Office, the International Commission on Occupational Health, and a world-expert on scaling up[42], we are now optimistic that the tools produced will be successfully used not only in local pockets, but on national and international scale.",
