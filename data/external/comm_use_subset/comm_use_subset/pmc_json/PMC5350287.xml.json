During the past two decades newly emerging ones, for example, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), reemerging ones, for example, West Nile virus, and even deliberately disseminated infectious diseases, for example, anthrax from bioterrorism, threaten the health of the hundreds and millions of the people globally [2]. During early nineties, there was a consensus that it was the time to close the book as the battle against infectious disease had been won [3]. But reemergence of cholera to the Americas in 1991, the plague outbreak in India in 1994, and the emergence of SARS outbreak in 2002-2003, Swine flu (H1N1) pandemic in 2009, and most recently Zika outbreak in Brazil in 2015 eventually prove that thought wrong. Ebola virus disease (EVD) is one of the notorious emerging infectious diseases that endanger the human lives from time to time since its appearance in 1976 in Zaire (later renamed the Democratic Republic of the Congo) and Sudan in Africa continent [2]. The recent epidemic of EVD started in Guinea in December 2013. Within a short period of time, it has spread across land borders to Sierra Leone and Liberia, by air to Nigeria and USA, and by land to Mali and Senegal [4]. On August 8, 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the EVD outbreak in West Africa a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) under the International Health Regulations (2005). On March 29, 2016, PHEIC related to EVD was lifted from West Africa and on June 9, 2016, WHO declared the end of the most recent outbreak of EVD [5]. By the end of the epidemic, total 15227 confirmed EVD cases have been reported with 11310 deaths in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone [6]. Till date no indigenous EVD case has been reported in India. But no country is free from the threat of EVD outbreak. A precise prediction about transmission and consequences after an EVD outbreak in India will be effective for proper planning and management to combat with the situation.",

The concept of precision public health evolved within the last two to three years [7]. The precision public health can be simply described as improving the ability to prevent disease, promote health, and reduce health disparities in populations by applying emerging methods and technologies for measuring disease, pathogens, exposures, behaviours, and susceptibility in populations and developing interventional policies for targeted public health programs to improve health [8]. The emergent areas of precession public health are improving methodologies for early detection of pathogens and infectious disease outbreaks, modernizing public health surveillance, epidemiology, and information systems, and targeting health interventions to improve health and prevent diseases [8]. Application of information technology and data science, like real time data acquisition, geospatial epidemiological modelling, big data analytics, and machine learning technology, in field of epidemiology paves the way to its transformation to digital epidemiology, which is conceptually more accurate and precise in nature [8, 9].",

One of the most important roles of an epidemiologist is to develop appropriate strategies to prevent or limit the impact of epidemics. Advent of computer based sophisticated technologies helps epidemiologist to study the complex dynamics of disease transmission in silico approach. Mathematical modelling of epidemics can essentially be divided into deterministic and stochastic processes [11]. Deterministic model is based on the average characteristic of the population parameters under study, whereas stochastic model contains randomness of elements. Though stochastic model is more accurate in evaluating real-life epidemic propagation, as it accounts for the randomness of interactions between different population parameters, it is not entirely reproducible. Moreover, when the population is large enough these kinds of randomness neutralise each other and then a simpler deterministic model turns to be good enough to use. Simulation study based on deterministic compartmental model is most commonly applied in epidemiology. This computer simulation is an attempt to model a real-life or hypothetical epidemic situation on a computer so that it can be studied to see how the system works [11]. Infection transmission related different model parameters, commonly applied for compartmental modelling, are shown in Table 1. By changing variables in the simulation, predictions may be made about the behaviour of the system. Incidence of EVD in India is nil, so single reporting of EVD case in India will be considered as an EVD outbreak. A computer based simulation was attempted using Spatiotemporal Epidemiological Modeler (STEM) assuming a single EVD case reported on 01.1.2017 at New Delhi (28.6139\u00b0N and 77.2090\u00b0E). Then hypothetical spread of EVD in India with time was simulated considering the same dynamics of EVD transmission that was observed in the recent outbreak in West Africa during 2014\u20132016.",

Public health specialists are responsible for strategies to prevent outbreaks. So they need an accurate understanding of dynamics of disease transmission and the likely outcomes of preventive actions. STEM helps to develop and apply various advanced mathematical models for better understanding of disease dynamics. It comes with a large number of existing compartment models and a new model building framework that allows users to rapidly extend existing models or to create entirely new models. Any STEM model can be run either stochastically or deterministically. Users can choose between many different numerical solvers of ordinary differential equations. When output of a model is fully determined by the initial condition and parameter values, then the model is called deterministic but when same initial conditions and parameter values will lead to an ensemble of different output then the model possesses an inherent randomness that is called stochastic model. Though most of the cases in real world are governed by stochastic processes, this model is more complicated than deterministic model.",

Neither the entire USA, nor the entire Florida state, was declared at risk during its notification in July 2016. Instead, precise public health surveillance identified two at-risk areas situated at Miami-Dade County. Mosquito control measures focused on those areas. After six weeks, when the health officials were convinced by ongoing surveillance, restrictions in one area was lifted and resources were mobilized to the other area [9]. So precision public health is a concept that guides precise interventional strategies to address public health problems among precisely defined population using precise surveillance data [13]. Instead of issuing high alert for impending outbreak for entire country at a single point of time, it can be done more precisely at different place at different point of time based on geospatial modelling, simulated using precise surveillance data. Resource mobilization and utilization can be done in a better way. Moreover, unwanted situation like mass panic and its effect on day to day life can be averted.",

From the simulation, it can precisely be estimated about the spread, number of effected districts, infectious population, and probable deaths at different point of time. From this simulation, it is estimated that, within 2 years, almost half of the country will be effected by EVD. It is also possible to model and compare the effect of different interventional strategies at different time frame, to address the epidemic effectively and efficiently. A spatiotemporal modelling of EVD spread in West Africa, done by Pigott et al. in 2016 and Chretien et al. in 2015, assisted the public health specialists in strengthening surveillance and response capacity to contain the EVD outbreak in that area [14, 15]. A computer modelling analysis was done by Merler et al. in 2015 about the spatiotemporal spread of the 2014 outbreak of Ebola virus disease in Liberia and effectiveness of different nonpharmaceutical interventional strategies which helped the Liberian health officials to take necessary actions [16]. In 2016, Burghardt et al. tested and modelled the assumptions related to spatiotemporal spread of recent EVD outbreak in West Africa [17].",
