Apelin modulates vascular tone in vivo, decreasing blood pressure when infused into rats and dilating resistance vessels when infused into human forearm7\u20139. In vitro, apelin causes nitric oxide-dependent vasodilation of human splanchnic artery10, although a nitric oxide-independent, prostanoid dependent vasodilation in humans has been reported4. Apelin acted as a vasoconstrictor in endothelium denuded vessels via a direct action on vascular smooth muscle cells whilst also acting as a potent angiogenic factor and mitogen of endothelial cells4,11. Based on these beneficial effects, apelin was proposed as a potential therapeutic target in cardiovascular diseases. For example, apelin administration showed cardioprotective effects in heart failure12, and ameliorated the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension in rats13,14 and humans15. In addition, the protective effects of apelin has been reported in metabolic diseases where it decreased adiposity, serum insulin and increased insulin sensitivity16,17; and in renal diseases where it decreased acute renal injury and fibrosis18. It has recently emerged that apelin has pro-tumorigenic effects in various cancer models possibly by promoting angiogenesis and that inhibition of the apelin pathway was protective against tumour growth14,19. However, these beneficial effects of apelin peptides are limited by the rapid in vivo metabolism.",

These studies demonstrated that apelin peptides are very labile in plasma with a half-life of less than 1\u20135 minutes in vitro20\u201324. This plasma instability has to date been attributed the enzymatic activity of neprilysin25 and angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2)22\u201324, and more recently plasma kallikrein26,27. Similarly, another recent study reported more rapid degradation of [Pyr1]apelin-13 in rat and mouse plasma when compared to dog, monkey and human plasma in vitro28. The authors also confirmed their findings in vivo in rat and mouse, and identified N-terminal metabolites of the peptide, particularly apelin-7 that was most abundant28. This study therefore highlighted species differences in the repertoire of proteases circulating and present in rodent and higher mammalian systems. However, to date no studies have investigated the metabolism of apelin peptides in vivo in humans. The aim of this study was to develop a highly sensitive mass spectrometry based method for detection and quantification of apelin peptides in plasma. We used this method to measure intact [Pyr1]apelin-13 and its metabolites generated in humans, following a constant 120 minutes infusion of the peptide. We found that [Pyr1]apelin-13 was cleaved into smaller fragments from both termini but that the C-terminal was more susceptible. We identified the biologically active C-terminal cleavage product, [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312), as the most abundant, as well as identifying novel metabolites including [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201310) and [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u20136).",

Full scan LC-MS data were interrogated for potential [Pyr1]apelin-13 derived metabolites by comparing extracted ion chromatograms for each analyte in the 0 and 120 minute samples in the Qualbrowser software package (Thermofisher). Peptides that were identified in the 120 minute samples were mainly generated by the loss of C-terminal amino acids (Fig. 3A). Their relative abundance in the samples are displayed in Fig. 3B. Notably, the most abundant fragments were [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312) (known to be biologically active24), [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201310) and [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u20136). Other metabolites identified, although at lower levels (<10% of parent [Pyr1]apelin-13) included [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u20138), [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u20137) and [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u20135) that are likely to be biologically inactive. The chromatographic spectra corresponding to each of these metabolites are shown in Fig. 4A\u2013G. In addition to [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312), the most abundant metabolite identified, [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201310) (Fig. 5) and [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u20136) (Fig. 6) were present at a sufficient level to generate suitable product ion spectra allowing experimentally acquired fragments to be matched against theoretical fragments from the peptide sequence.

Using this method, we have quantified the intact peptide after constant infusion for 120 minutes into healthy volunteers and showed for the first time that in humans in vivo, [Pyr1]apelin-13 was cleaved from both the N- and C-termini, with the C-terminus being the most susceptible to proteolytic activity.

Our findings may therefore better explain the extremely unstable nature of apelin peptides in plasma6,28,31. It is worth noting that the C-terminus was more susceptible to proteolytic activity than the N-terminus, whose metabolites were present at approximately 20-fold lower levels. This may partly be explained by the pyroglutamylation of the N-terminus which may protect this region from enzymatic activity to some degree. The N-terminus of [Pyr1]apelin-13 also contains the RPRL motif critical for binding to the apelin receptor32, hence any cleavage from this direction is likely to profoundly affect the affinity of these N-terminal fragments for the receptor. A previous study showed in vitro that neprilysin cleaves [Pyr1]apelin-13 between Arg4 and Leu5 and between Leu5 and Ser6 amino acids25, thereby making neprilysin the first enzyme identified to date that completely inactivates the peptide. Importantly, we have now shown in this study the presence of one of these proposed neprilysin cleavage products, [Pyr1]apelin-13(6\u201313), in humans in vivo with additional evidence for cleavage of the scissile bond between Leu5 and Ser6 given by the detection of the C-terminal fragment, [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u20135). To date very few studies have investigated the metabolism of peptides in vivo in humans. Interestingly, like [Pyr1]apelin-13, arginine vasopressin was also proposed to be cleaved in vivo from both the C- and N- termini, with carboxypeptidase and post-proline enzymes cleaving the C-terminus of arginine vasopressin, while aminopeptidases cleaved the N-terminal region33\u201335. In contrast, other in vivo studies of this nature identified only a single terminus cleavage of Peptide YY36, growth hormone-releasing hormone37, liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue38 and big endothelin-139.",

However, it was unclear whether this metabolite retained biological activity at the apelin receptor. One study argued that [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312) had reduced biological activity compared to the native [Pyr1]apelin-13 as measured by its hypotensive effects in mice23. However, Yang et al.24 demonstrated that the ACE2 metabolite, [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312) contracted human saphenous vein with sub-nanomolar potency and was a potent positive inotrope in paced mouse and human heart ex vivo. The authors demonstrated [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312) was present endogenously in the endothelium of human heart and lungs, and went on to show that it was biologically active in vivo in humans and rodents24. Similarly, a previous study reported that [Pyr1]apelin-13 was cleaved to [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312)\nin vivo in rats22. Consistent with these studies, our work now provides clear evidence that [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312) is produced endogenously in human plasma in vivo possibly via the activity of ACE2.",

The corresponding N-terminal fragments of these C-terminal metabolites [Pyr1]apelin-13(11\u201313) and [Pyr1]apelin-13(7\u201313), were also identified. These data were consistent with a previous in vivo study in male rats which also identified the C-terminal metabolites22. The authors reported on the accumulation of [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201310) and [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u20136) signals with time as [Pyr1]apelin-13 and [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312) signals decreased, suggesting that following ACE2 cleavage of [Pyr1]apelin-13 to [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201312), other unidentified enzymes subsequently cleave both [Pyr1]apelin-13 and [Pyr1]apelin-12 into [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u201310) and [Pyr1]apelin-13(1\u20136).

Taken together, these findings may suggest that there is at least some common metabolic pathways for [Pyr1]apelin-13 in rats and humans in vivo. Further studies are required to identify the specific proteases involved.",

ACE2 is an important member of the renin-angiotensin system that converts angiotensin-II to angiotensin 1\u20137, with the latter mediating vasodilatation, anti-proliferation, anti-apoptosis and anti-fibrotic effects41. In addition, ACE2 has been implicated in heart failure42,43, diabetic nephropathy44,45, acute lung failure46, lung injury induced by the lethal avian influenza A H5N1 virus47, respiratory syncytial virus48 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)46. Recently, GSK developed a recombinant human ACE2, GSK2586881 for treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and showed that this molecule was well-tolerated in clinical trials49. Corroborating on this, apelin signalling induces ACE2 expression in failing hearts12, and protects against lung injury in experimental models of acute respiratory distress syndrome50, possibly by inhibiting the NF-\u03baB pathway and components of the inflammasome51. Furthermore, apelin counteracts the effects of angiotensin-II signalling, which is negatively regulated by ACE2, suggesting that targeting ACE2 and apelin could be a potentially novel therapeutic strategy for treatment of lung injury related pathologies and heart failure.",

            "text": "The beneficial effects of apelin in heart failure are well characterised. Plasma apelin levels have been suggested to increase in early stages5 of heart failure but decrease in late stages of the disease52\u201354. In support of this, heart failure therapies such has cardiac resynchronisation therapy used to treat refractory chronic heart failure were shown to increase plasma apelin suggesting that increased apelin levels are associated with improved therapeutic benefit54. Apelin administration increased stroke volume and contractility in failing hearts11, thereby improving the performance of the failing heart. Similarly, neprilysin inhibitors have emerged as a pivotal therapeutic strategy for clinical management of heart failure due to the role of neprilysin in the degradation of vasoactive peptides including natriuretic peptides and bradykinin55. Indeed, neprilysin inhibitors such as sacubitril are used for clinical management of heart failure56. Our data may therefore suggest that an additional benefit of neprilysin inhibitors in heart failure is to reduce apelin inactivation resulting in beneficial vasodilation, increased contractility and cardiac output. Building on these findings, further studies could substitute the amino acids at the neprilysin cleavage sites in [Pyr1]apelin-13 with unnatural amino acids to improve its resistance to degradation. Indeed, it was recently shown that infusion of neprilysin resistant apelin-17 in an established mice model of abdominal aortic aneurysm ameliorated the adverse aortic remodelling and aneurysm formation27. Such a strategy was also demonstrated to significantly increase the resistance of [Pyr1]apelin-13 and apelin-17 to ACE2 activity22,23, suggesting that this could potentially be a mechanism to improve plasma stability of apelin-based therapeutics for clinical indications. We have recently published on an another approach to stabilise apelin peptides in human blood using albumin domain (AlbudAb) antibody conjugated to an apelin analogue, MM202 and showed that this peptide was resistant to degradation yet retained biological activity at the human apelin receptor in vitro and in vivo9. Therefore, these strategies could in the near future result in the development of the first apelin-based therapeutics for treatment of human diseases.",

Six healthy volunteers (3 male and 3 female, mean age 43.8 \u00b1 6.9, with body mass index within the normal range of 23.0 \u00b1 1.0) were recruited for infusion. Volunteers were fasted and were lying supine with their heads supported in a quiet, temperature controlled (23\u201325 \u00b0C) room for the duration of the study. Following a period of acclimatisation, the first sample of venous blood was obtained from the arm contralateral to the arm used for infusion of apelin. Vials containing [Pyr1]apelin-13 were allowed to warm to room temperature and diluted with physiological saline to produce stock solutions, that were then filtered using a 0.2 \u00b5m Portex flat filter (Portex, UK) before undergoing serial dilutions with 0.9% sterile saline. There was no loss of apelin following this filtration procedure. Volunteers were infused with a concentration of 135 nmol/min of [Pyr1]apelin-13, at a rate of 1 ml/min for 120 minutes, using a syringe pump, equipped with a 50 ml syringe and 16 gauge catheter.

Blood samples were collected into 2.6 ml EDTA tubes, immediately put on wet ice and centrifuged for 7 minutes at ~4 \u00b0C, 4000 rpm and stored a \u221270 \u00b0C, prior to analysis. A previous study had used a concentration of up to 100 nmol/min for systemic infusion, where they obtained a therapeutic response in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension and the highest dose was well tolerated15. The dose chosen of 135 nmol/min of [Pyr1]apelin-13, was slightly higher in order to identify possible metabolites.

LC-MS/MS instrumentation used for the quantitation of [Pyr1]apelin-13 included a H-Class Acquity (Waters) attached to a TQ-XS triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Waters). Peptides were separated using a 2.1 \u00d7 50 mm 1.8 mm particle HSS T3 Acquity column held at 60 \u00b0C and flowing at 350 \u00b5l/minute. Gradient starting conditions were 95% A (0.1% FA in water v/v) and 5% B (0.1% FA in ACN). Starting conditions were held for 0.2 minutes before raising to 25% B over 4 minutes. The column was flushed with 90% B for 0.8 minutes before returning to starting conditions. The total time of each analysis was 7 minutes, with the first 1.2 minutes and last 2.8 minutes diverted to waste. The source parameters used included a positive electrospray voltage of 3.0 kV, gas flow of 1000 L/hour, desolvation temperature of 600 \u00b0C and a cone voltage of 40 V.",

Therefore this was selected for fragmentation. A product ion spectrum was collected over a range of 100 to 1600 m/z and two ions were selected for SRM optimisation (m/z 424.6 and 408.55). The 424.6 ion corresponded to the b11 fragment and the 408.55 ion was derived from the loss of a methyl-sulphide group from the methionine on the b11 ion, as previously described by Mesmin et al.31. Optimal conditions for the two SRM transitions for [Pyr1]apelin-13 were 384.2/408.55, 384.2/424.6 with collision energy values of 14 and 12 eV respectively. The internal standard used the same collision energy but targeted transitions of 387.45/412.88 and 387.45/428.26. Peptide peak areas were integrated using the TargetLynx program associated with Masslynx V 4.2 (Waters), and peak area ratios were generated against the corresponding stable isotope-labelled internal standard peptide peak.",

Mass spectrometry was performed using positive electrospray mode with a needle voltage of 3 kV, gas settings of 55 and 10 for sheath gas and aux gas flow rates. The temperature of the gas was set at 350 \u00b0C and the transfer capillary at 350 \u00b0C and a s\u2010lens value of 70 V. Full scan data were acquired over an m/z range of 250\u20131000, using a resolution of 70,000 and a maximum fill time of 100 ms. Acquired LC-MS data were interrogated for potential [Pyr1]apelin-13 metabolites by searching for all potential cleavage products from the parent peptide in the RAW data files using the Qualbrowser software package (Thermofisher). The m/z values for these peptides at multiple charge states are displayed in Supplementary Table 1. The potential [Pyr1]apelin-13 metabolites that were manually identified were subsequently characterised, where 30 \u03bcl of sample was reinjected using a targeted MS/MS analysis.
