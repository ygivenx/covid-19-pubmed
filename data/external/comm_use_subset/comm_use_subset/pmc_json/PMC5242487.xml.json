            "text": "The United States swine industry has suffered dramatic losses following the emergence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in May 2013. The virus is a highly contagious and deadly coronavirus that was only observed in Asian and European swine herds prior to 2013. Due to the high mortality rates (80\u2013100%) in neonates, significant economic losses have been experienced [1, 2]. Traditionally, transmission of PEDV occurs through the fecal-oral route within a herd with acutely infected pigs shedding large quantities of the virus for several days after infection. Due to the large amount of virus that can be shed by infected herds, there is potential for the virus to contaminate facility surroundings, leading to contamination issues off-property. Other modes of transmission, in addition to infected pigs, include fecal contamination of animal transport vehicles, PEDV-positive aerosols, and contaminated animal feed or ingredients [1, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Observations also indicate presence of PEDV genetic material in feed transport vehicles suggesting these vehicles may be a potential vector [7].",

As previously described by Huss et al.

The main effects of decontamination step, surface (concrete, metal, plastic, or rubber), type (equipment or structural), and zone (1, 2, or 3) are shown in Table 3.

Following cleaning with the ammonium-glutaraldehyde blend 36 of 150 (24.0%) of the collected samples were positive for PEDV RNA (Fig 1). This was further reduced to 14 of 150 collected samples positive after sanitization with the sodium hypochlorite solution (Fig 1). Following facility heat-up to 60\u00b0C for 48 hours, 6 of 157 (3.8%) of the collected samples were positive for PEDV RNA (Fig 1). It is important to note that all 6 of the positive samples found after heat-up were from replication 2. Due to these results, the decontamination process was repeated (cleaning with the ammonium-glutaraldehyde blend, followed by sanitization with a sodium hypochlorite solution and facility heat-up to 60\u00b0C for 48 hours) and the collection of additional swabs. All swabs collected after the repeat decontamination were negative for PEDV RNA. Overall the efficacy of the chemical disinfection and heat to decontaminate the facility were consistent with previous research done for decontamination of animal transport vehicles [14].",

The quantity of viral RNA between the equipment and structural swabs was statistically different, with greater contamination found in equipment swabs (P < 0.05). This was expected due to the equipment being in direct contact with the contaminated feed. The majority of collected structural swabs were also positive, but remained less than those collected from equipment throughout the experiment. This was also as expected as structural swabs did not have direct contact with the contaminated feed. It is important to note the extent of contamination of structural surfaces, thus emphasizing the important role dust particles may play in the spread of biological hazards throughout a feed manufacturing facility. These results are congruent with previous research implementing dust in the spread of bacterial biological hazards within a feed manufacturing facility [8, 10]. To our knowledge this is the first report to describe the spread of a viral pathogen through the environment of a feed production facility.",

Significantly less contamination was seen in zone 3 (vs zones 1 and 2; P < 0.05), as expected due to the proximity to the contaminated feed. However, as seen with the facility swabs, dust generated during processing of contaminated feed can lead to contamination of previously uncontaminated surfaces. This is consistent with data indicating that aerosolized dust can be a transmission vector [15]. This previous work indicates that the PEDV particles can be attached to dust.

Therefore, feed mill operators must be particularly judicious regarding use of good manufacturing practices and biosecurity protocols to exclude the virus from entry into the feed mill. Furthermore, additional research is necessary to understand the role of dust in animal food biological hazard transmission and to formulate practical feed mill sanitation recommendations to prevent and reduce PEDV contamination of equipment and facilities.",
