These include environmental risk factors, such as crowded living conditions and exposure to indoor air pollution, as well as biological risk factors, such as malnutrition and underlying infections [5\u20137]. These risk factors may drive the burden of influenza in South Africa to be greater than other countries with similar income level [3, 8, 9]. In particular, the high HIV prevalence in South Africa likely leads to higher numbers of severe influenza-associated illness and thus more hospitalized cases [9\u201315].",

The population of Soweto represents approximately 11% of the population of Gauteng Province (referred thereafter as the base Province). We assumed that the incidence rates for Soweto reflected the incidence rate for the province. At the time of this study, CHBAH was the only public hospital serving Soweto, where approximately 10% have private medical insurance ([22]. More than 80% of uninsured and 10% of insured persons seek care at public hospitals such as CHBAH. Therefore, the majority of individuals in Soweto that seek care do so at CHBAH [12].",

Non-hospitalized cases of SARI refer to cases of SARI identified in the population that had symptoms severe enough to be hospitalized but did not seek care at a hospital, for reasons such as limited access to healthcare. Briefly, between 4,000 and 6,000 community members were surveyed in each of the two sites as part of a cross-sectional door-to-door household survey and asked if they had a severe pneumonia in the past year (as defined as fever and cough and difficult breathing for 2\u201330 days or a physician diagnosis of pneumonia) and whether they were admitted to a hospital for the event. The ratio of those that sought care to those that did not was applied to the rate of hospitalized SARI to get the rate of non-hospitalized SARI in the base province [2].",

Risk factors included exposure to indoor air pollution, crowding, malnutrition, low birth-weight and non-exclusive breastfeeding; the last three were only included as risk factors for children under five years of age [2, 8]. The relative risks of SARI associated with each risk factor were determined from the published literature [8]. In addition, we adjusted the provincial rates by the proportion of ARI seeking care in the given province to the proportion of ARI cases seeking care in the base province (Gauteng Province) using Health and Demographic Surveys (DHS) [4]. An upward adjustment factor (greater than one) resulted in a greater incidence of SARI in the province relative to Soweto (Gauteng Province). Similarly, a downward adjustment factor (less than one) resulted in a decrease in SARI incidence in the province relative to Soweto (Gauteng Province). The equations used for the Provincial adjustment are provided in the technical S1 Appendix.",

Our study relies on extrapolating incidence rates from one surveillance site in one province to the rest of the provinces of South Africa. Although a high percentage of the base province is under surveillance from this one large surveillance site and we adjusted this incidence based on province-level risk factor for SARI, there are likely additional unmeasured factors that can lead to variation in rates regionally. We assumed that the relative risk of SARI for the different risk factors determined for the populations in the literature are the same relative risks for the population of South Africa, which might not be the case [8, 23, 24]. Second, the denominator estimates also might have been inaccurate. We used the ASSA 2008 population model to estimate the population and HIV prevalence by province and age group. These population estimates are extrapolations from the 2001 census. Third, the healthcare utilization surveys used to calculate non-hospitalized cases was undertaken in only two sites in two provinces. Moreover, the surveys did not stratify health-seeking by HIV status or age, which is likely to influence health-seeking behavior. Fourth, these estimates reflect the dsease burden in the public sector; however, a similar study using a different modelling approach in the private health sector of South Africa found similar incidence rates of influenza-associated respiratory hospitalizations [30]. Lastly, we assume that the percent of influenza-associated SARI is the same across all age groups, provinces and HIV status.",

Other countries that have influenza surveillance in place can also implement this methodology to estimate their national burden of severe influenza disease. We found that provinces in South Africa vary in the prevalence of important risk factors for SARI and influenza and that these impact the burden of severe disease. Current recommendations in South Africa include the vaccination of HIV-infected individuals with the seasonal influenza vaccine; however, the vaccine tends to be under-utilized in this population and in South Africa in general[31]. The results of this rapid assessment can be used to focus efforts targeting influenza vaccination by demonstrating the distribution of disease across South Africa.",
