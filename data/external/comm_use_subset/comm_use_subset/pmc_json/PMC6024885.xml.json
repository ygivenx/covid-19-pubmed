Studies classified recent IBV strains into Egyptian variant 1 (Egy/VarI) and Egyptian variant 2 (Egy/VarII) based on the S1 hypervariable region 3 sequence analysis [4,6]. Currently, the IBV variant 2 is the most predominant serotype in Egypt, causing massive losses in broiler, layer, and breeder sectors [7,8]. A universal phylogeny-based classification system recently suggested that the Egyptian IBV strains belong to a unique cluster confined to the Middle East region, designated as genotype-I; lineage-23 (GI-23 lineage) [9]. The fact that many IBV serotypes and/or genotypes are cocirculating worldwide has made it difficult to control the virus. Protection studies indicated that using a homologous strain vaccine can afford better protection against IBV challenge [10,11,12]. Also, attempts to broaden the protective efficacy of IBV vaccines through experimental combinations of live IBV vaccines presented a successful strategy to protect chicken against heterologous virulent IBV strains [13]. A recent study attributed this success to the levels of cellular and local immune responses at the tracheal mucosa, which were higher when combining different live IBV vaccines in vaccination programs [14]. In this study, field safety and effectiveness of the newly developed IB-VAR2\u00ae vaccine followed by a classical IB-H120 vaccine administered at 16 days of age were evaluated in day-old chicks under normal field circumstances.",

Due to limited access to other neighboring farms, another neighboring farm with 7000 Ross broiler chicks was used as a control farm for comparison purposes at the selling age (Farm 2). The main concerns, from a biosecurity point of view, included the lack of optimal distances between farms (the distance between the two farms is 0.35 km), the high frequency of IBV outbreaks at the region, and the lack of shelters and enclosure systems that may allow contact with wild birds.",

To assess the IBV vaccine efficacy, thirty birds were bled each time and sera were collected from the vaccinated birds at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days of life to evaluate the IBV immune response as well as IBD, AI-H9, and AI-H5 responses. At 5 days post-vaccination and at each sampling point mentioned above, tracheal and kidney tissues samples from 10 randomly selected birds were subjected to RT-PCR for viral pathogen detection.

By 12 days after the second IBV vaccination using the IB-H120 vaccine, the ELISA titers were elevated to reach 2253 \u00b1 1175 (Figure 1). Weekly monitoring of antibody level titers in farm 1 had been done. The IBV HI antibody titers show that the MDA log2 HI antibody titer using the IB-VAR2 antigen was 2.9 \u00b1 1.5; however, using the classical IBV antigen (IBV-H120) indicated that the MDA titers were 5.4 \u00b1 1.3 log2 (data not shown). The HI titers using the homologues IB-VAR2 showed that the log2 HI antibody titers increased to 9.9 \u00b1 0.3 log2 by two weeks post-vaccination and remained high (\u22659 log2) till five weeks post-vaccination (Figure 2).",
