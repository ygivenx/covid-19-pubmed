The journal was launched in October 2012 to explore new avenues in research to deepen the understanding of the relationship between infectious diseases and poverty, to contribute to priority-setting and translation of key findings into policies and programmes to control and eliminate these diseases. The expanded \u201cOne World \u2013 One Health\u201d concept, first proposed by the Wildlife Conservation Society and supported by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), WHO, the World Bank and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), recognises that the health of people, animals, and societies is intimately linked, and ultimately dependent, on the resilience of the world\u2019s life-supporting ecosystems [6]. Based on this concept, Infectious Diseases of Poverty has published a series of original articles and empirical work with reference to analyses of disease burdens, their distributions and the research that is needed in this area. To raise global awareness of infectious diseases of poverty, the journal has not only published original research articles but also scoping reviews that highlight trans-disciplinary advances in the science undertaken. Several collections in different areas and on various topics have been published [3, 7].",

The commentary is linked to the rabies piece and discusses the science of elimination more broadly [16]. In a letter to the editor, research priorities in modelling the transmission risk of H7N9 avian influenza are discussed [17]. The opinion piece emphasises that clonorchiasis in P.R. China must be addressed and tackled in a timely manner [18]. The editorial pertains to the elimination of tropical diseases and highlights the importance of surveillance and response [8].",

China in the 1980s and 1990s have now been documented, including the formulation of principles and recommendations of therapeutic regimens for the use of antimalarial drugs (artemisinin/pyronaridine compounds) [12]. To identify an antifilarial drug target, in vitro \u2018gene silencing\u2019 of independent phosphoglyceratemutase (iPGM) in the filarial parasite B. malayi was performed by Singh et al., whose work suggests that iPGM is essential for both larval and adult stages of B. malayi [28].",

Work stemming from Nigeria assessed household payments for TB with regard to incidence, determinants and policy implications for universal health coverage. The results suggest that current health cost-lowering strategies in Nigeria are not sufficient to prevent households from incurring catastrophic out-of-pocket payments for TB care [23]. To assess resources for the use of community-directed interventions (CDI), another study from Nigeria investigated delivery of health interventions in poorly-served urban communities in Ibadan. The research support the feasibility of using the CDI process in delivering health interventions in urban, poor environments and shows that resources for the strategy were potentially abound in the communities.",
