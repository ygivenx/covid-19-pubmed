In MS, macrophage differentiation and activation have been demonstrated to induce demyelination [4], and in RA, the number of macrophages infiltrating into synovial tissue correlates with the extent of local disease activity [5]. Activated macrophages are important sources of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs); because of this, macrophages are the primary effectors of tissue destruction, and they participate in the degradation of both normal and abnormal matrix [6]. In inflammatory diseases like MS and RA, therapeutic strategies aim to counteract macrophage homing, activation and differentiation [3]. Furthermore, macrophages are key players in the development and progression of atherosclerosis, meanwhile acknowledged as a chronic inflammatory disease [7].",

Both MMPs contribute to the pathogenesis of MS: MMP-2 participates in the remodeling of the extracellular matrix in chronic inflammatory processes, and MMP-9 predominates in acute MS lesions [13]. MMP-9 also participates in generating autoimmunity in MS by cleaving myelin compounds [14]. Imbalances in MMP activity have also been implicated in RA [15]. MMP-2 and MMP-9 contribute to joint destruction by directly degrading cartilage and bone and by promoting angiogenesis [15]. Several MMPs including MMP-2 and MMP-9 contribute to atherosclerosis by initiation of collagen breakdown in plaques [16].",

            "text": "Statins are inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, which catalyzes the rate limiting step in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway [21]. Apart from their cholesterol lowering activity, statins have been demonstrated to have immunomodulatory effects in vitro and in animal models; if they prove effective in controlled trials, statins may serve as treatment options for MS or RA in the future [22,23,24,25,26,27,28]. For atherosclerosis prevention, statins are already widely used [29]. Statins block the formation of cholesterol biosynthesis pathway intermediates such as isoprenoids and dolichol (Fig 1). Isoprenoids derived from farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP) or geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP) form lipid attachments that are important for the membrane translocation of small GTP binding proteins [30]. Only upon isoprenylation are GTP binding proteins able to signal to their downstream effectors and promote vital cellular functions. Conversely, if isoprenylation is inhibited by statins, inactive forms of these GTP binding proteins accumulate in the cytosol, keeping the cell in a dormant state. Furthermore, reduction of FPP by statins results in the depletion of dolichol, which acts as a carbohydrate donor during the N-linked glycosylation of membrane targeted proteins. Lower levels of N-glycosylation result in the accumulation of immature forms of these proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum [31,32].",

Experimentally induced changes in CD147 N-glycosylation are illustrated in Fig 6A and 6B. Treatment of THP-1 cells with fluvastatin induced LG CD147 expression in a dose-dependent manner. Rescue with mevalonate, squalene, or cholesterol was able to reduce the fluvastatin-induced increase in expression of LG CD147. Inhibition of isoprenylation by FTI-277, GGTI-298 or FPT1 (a combined inhibitor of farnesylation and geranylgeranylation) increased LG CD147. Consistently, treatment with AP-9, a specific peptide antagonist of CD147, increased LG CD147. Treatment of THP-1 cells with tunicamycin affected the levels of both LG and HG CD147: the expression of LG CD147 (33 kDa) and HG CD147 (51 kDa) was greatly diminished. The molecular weight of the form that appeared upon tunicamycin treatment (27 kDa) is consistent with that of the non-glycosylated core protein. The small amount of 51 kDa HG CD147 remaining was likely synthesized before tunicamycin treatment (Fig 6A).",

Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that AP-9 significantly inhibits the secretion and activation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 by THP-1 cells, thus emphasizing the role of CD147 in regulating MMPs [11]. CD147 interacts with adhesion markers such as CD29 (\u03b21-integrin) and CD98 (large neutral amino acid transporter 1) [47] and participates in integrin-mediated adhesion, cellular differentiation and apoptosis [48]. Inhibition of CD147 has also been shown to impair the translocation of monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)-1 to the cell surface, disrupting the cellular lactate acid shuttle; this leads to intracellular acidification and metabolic starvation. Both of these effects lead to inhibition of monocytic differentiation [49].",

CD147 exists in two different glycosylation states: a HG (highly glycosylated) and a LG (lowly glycosylated) form. MMP induction is promoted by HG CD147 via homo-oligomerization, whereas LG CD147 acts as an inhibitor of MMP-2 and MMP-9, probably through its affinity for caveolin [9,19]. Thus, the glycosylation status of CD147 acts as a molecular switch for the activation of MMPs [8,54].

            "text": "Two distinct inhibitors of isoprenylation (FTI-277, a farnesylation inhibitor, and GGTI-298, a geranylgeranylation inhibitor) only partially inhibited CD147 surface expression and MMP activation, indicating that isoprenylation plays only a minor role in these pathways. However, the same isoprenylation inhibitors did induce the expression of LG forms of CD147. We speculate that this discrepancy is due to a potential effect of statins on caveolin-1 itself (mediated by isoprenylation) because upregulation of caveolin-1 also promotes LG CD147 forms and subsequently decreases self-association of CD147 on the cell surface [18]. Thus, statins act on isoprenylation pathways to impair trafficking of CD147 to the cell surface. Tunicamycin specifically inhibits the N-glycosylation of newly synthesized proteins [56]. In our experiments, tunicamycin drastically reduced de novo N-glycosylation of CD147, resulting in greatly increased expression of the non-glycosylated core protein. Taken together, these data suggest that statins regulate CD147 on multiple levels, particularly through isoprenylation and N-glycosylation.",

            "text": "Most transmembrane proteins are not as sensitive to changes in glycosylation status as CD147. The requirement for high levels of glycosylation for the MMP stimulating activity of CD147 [18] is unusual but not unique. Like CD147, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 receptor is a membrane-targeted molecule that requires N-glycosylation for its proper function; reduced glycosylation activity causes proreceptor retention within the endoplasmic reticulum [32]. Consistent with our findings for CD147, two other groups have described downregulation of IGF-1 receptor by statin treatment and demonstrated that this inhibitory effect is via the isoprenylation and N-glycosylation pathways, which act synergistically to promote IGF-1 receptor activity [32,57].",
