The immune mechanisms and correlates of viral clearance and protection from HCV infection have been studied extensively, but they still remain unclear [5\u20137]. A number of studies have correlated the natural clearance of HCV infection with the appearance of vigorous and multi-specific CD8+ and sustained CD4+ T cell responses [8\u201310]. In contrast, development of chronic infection is correlated with weak or dysfunctional cellular immune responses [7, 10, 11]. A recent meta-analysis of studies published to date with chimpanzee model concluded that humoral immune responses also play a determining role in protection from chronic HCV infection [12\u201314]. Further, recent studies support a role of antibodies beyond neutralization of viral particles; extending their function to targeting intracellular pathogens [15]. Therefore, it can be envisioned that a successful prophylactic and/or therapeutic vaccine strategy would encompass the generation of both cellular and humoral responses against multiple antigens of HCV.",

However, the exact mechanism of this spontaneous reversal of cellular immune responses, from exhausted and/or dysfunctional to functional, remains to be elucidated. In several studies, HCV-specific T cells have been expanded from the peripheral blood T-cell populations in individuals previously not infected with HCV [17, 18]. Among the HCV exposed individuals, 20\u201330% clear the virus after acute infection due to induction of strong multi-specific cellular immune responses [10, 19, 20]. However, it is not known if pre-existing heterologous immunity has any role in the HCV clearance after infection. Influenza A virus infection has been shown to induce narrow heterologous cellular immune response against a single epitope from HCV NS3 antigen [18].",

During our studies, we observed that immunization of mice with control, non-recombinant adenovirus vector (Ad vector) not expressing HCV antigens, also induced HCV antigens-specific T cell responses. To address this puzzling and unexpected observation, we aligned peptide sequences from different HCV proteins with various adenoviral proteins (Ad proteins) to determine the levels of homology between the proteins of the two viruses. Intriguingly, we discovered varying degrees of homologies (25\u201353%) between multiple HCV peptide sequences from core, F, NS3, NS4 and NS5 proteins and a number of Ad proteins (Table 1 and S1 Table). In this study, we conclusively demonstrate that immunization of mice with Ad vector not expressing exogenous HCV antigen(s), induces robust cross-reactive humoral and cellular immune responses against multiple HCV antigens. Further, reduction in viral titers in mice infected with vaccinia virus expressing recombinant HCV antigens as a surrogate model corroborated the relevance of cross-reactive immune responses to antiviral immunity. Intriguingly, normal healthy human donors with no known history of HCV infection but seropositive for Ad-specific IgG, demonstrated the presence of cross-reactive antibodies and T cell responses against multiple HCV antigens. Our study is the first to demonstrate heterologous and protective immunity induced by Ad vector against HCV. These studies have significant implications in the design of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines against HCV. In addition, since recombinant adenovirus vectors are at the forefront as candidate vaccines for several different pathogens including HCV, Ebola virus, Plasmodium, mycobacteria, influenza virus, among others, their widespread use as vaccines could significantly impact the prevalence and natural course of HCV infection.",

Table 1 summarizes the range of homologies between HCV-derived peptides and Ad proteins, and the number of HCV peptides and Ad proteins that show these homologies. Intriguingly, almost all of the compared Ad proteins (27) (S1 Table) showed homology (scores ranging between 25\u201340) with several peptides from HCV antigens core, F, NS3, NS4, NS5a and NS5b (S1\u2013S6 Datasets).

Reduction in Vac-HCV viral titers in this model is a critical parameter for the antiviral response against HCV. C57bl/6 mice, after two immunizations with Ad vector with or without poly I:C as adjuvant, were challenged with wild-type vaccinia (WT-Vac), or Vaccinia-HCV chimeric viruses (Vac-HCV core-NS3 or Vac-HCV NS3-NS4-NS5). Five days after challenge, viral loads were determined in ovaries in individual mice (Fig 7). The mice immunized with Ad vector in the presence or absence of poly I:C had significantly (p <0.05) reduced Vac-HCV (core-NS2-NS3 or NS3-NS4-NS5) viral loads in comparison to PBS or HEK cell lysate-immunized mice (Fig 7A and 7B). In contrast, viral titers in WT-Vaccinia challenged mice were not significantly (p = 0.8472) different in HEK lysate or Ad vector immunized mice (Fig 7A).

            "text": "Heterologous immunity is the term used when immune responses induced by one virus confers immunity to another unrelated virus and/or its antigens. Indeed, there have been reports showing induction of cross-reactive T cell responses among unrelated viruses [18, 33\u201335] Adenovirus and hepatitis C virus are evolutionarily unrelated. They differ in host cell specificity and contain genomes of dsDNA and RNA, respectively. However, the induction of heterologous immunity does not require the entire T cell epitope to be homologous [36]. This immunity can result from similarities in amino acid sequences in small stretches of peptides and/or promiscuity of T cell receptors (TCR) [36\u201339]. It has been shown that only 2\u20134 amino acids in the T cell epitopes actively participate in interaction with the TCR, and stronger associations in peptide-MHC and TCR is provided by co-stimulatory molecules and MHC molecules [39, 40]. Therefore, it is quite possible that a TCR will still recognize a peptide if its non-contact amino acid(s) are replaced with biochemically similar or even different amino acid(s) [36, 39, 40]. Further, MHC class I or II molecules can bind to and present a variety of peptides, which differ in amino acid composition [36, 41, 42]. These properties of both MHC molecules and TCR are necessary to process and respond to a vast pool of epitopes originating from a huge number of pathogens and/or antigens [36, 39, 41, 43]. Various studies show that CD4+ T cells are more promiscuous than CD8+ T cells in peptide epitope recognition [40, 42, 44, 45]. Also the MHC class II peptide binding pocket is more flexible than the MHC class I peptide-binding pocket [42, 45]. A higher level of promiscuity occurs at the CD4+ T cell level and flexibility within peptide-MHC II binding allows for greater and less-restrictive CD4+ T cell responses. This property is physiologically relevant as CD4+ T cell help is required to generate both humoral and effector T cell responses [37, 46]. Studies have also shown that if amino acids on a peptide epitope can be substituted by amino acids with similar biochemical property, it will be still recognized by the same T cell clone [42]. Additionally, some T cell clones could be intrinsically more cross-reactive than others. In outbred human population, the repertoire of peptide presentation and T cell recognition becomes even broader due to co-dominant expression of MHC molecules. Therefore, some individuals may show higher heterologous immunity against certain antigens than other individuals [47, 48].",

We have previously reported that mice immunized with a recombinant Ad vector expressing whole HCV core protein do not generate core-specific T cell responses due to immunosuppressive effects [29, 30]. In contrast, in the current study we unexpectedly found that an Ad vector without a transgene is able to induce robust core antigen specific humoral and cellular immune responses, due to a high degree of homology between multiple core-derived peptide sequences and various adenovirus proteins. This could be because adenovirus does not encode for a complete sequence of HCV-core but rather exhibits homologies in short peptide sequences, and therefore core-induced immune suppression is not apparent. Interestingly, however, core-stimulated effector cells showed significantly less killing activity than other effectors (Fig 6). The reason is not clear yet.",

            "text": "Adenoviruses commonly infect humans, where they have also been shown to exist persistently as normal gut flora [51]. Therefore, we sought to detect HCV-specific cross-reactive immune responses in humans with pre-existing immunity against Ad. Intriguingly, we observed that all of the healthy HCV-naive human donors (n = 19) that were seropositive for anti-Ad IgG (Fig 8A) demonstrated cross-reactive HCV-specific humoral (n = 19) and cellular (n = 17) immunity (Fig 8A and 8B). Interestingly, in the majority of donors, CD4+ T cells showed higher induction of IL-10 compared to IFN-\u03b3 upon stimulation with different HCV antigens, and only a minority of donors (~17% or 3 out of 17) showed higher levels of IFN-\u03b3 expression compared to IL-10 in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. These results represent the existence of two discreet courses of natural cross-reactive cellular immune responses against HCV antigens in humans with pre-existing Ad-specific immunity. The reasons for these two courses are not clear and could be dependent upon HLA type, T cell repertoire and/or environmental factors. However, it can be speculated that exposure of such individuals to HCV may also lead to distinct patterns of immune responses culminating in either acute/self-clearing or chronic infections, with a predisposition towards the development of chronic HCV infection in the majority of cases. These results are intriguing and suggest the potential impact of Ad immunity on the natural course of chronic vs. acute/clearing HCV infection, albeit with a small number of individuals. Prospective immunological studies in a large cohort of individuals will be required to fully predict and correlate Ad immunity to viral clearance vs. persistence upon exposure to HCV.",

Rare human and non-human adenoviruses are being developed for Ad vector-based vaccines, to avoid the issues of pre-existing immunity. However, this strategy will not completely rule out any pre-existing inter- and intra-species cross-reactive anti-adenoviral immunity. In fact, it has been shown recently that 12% of human subjects screened are seropositive to chimp Ad virus 3 and 22% are seropositive to a rare human Ad virus 6, in contrast to 38% seropositivity to the prevalent human Ad virus 5 [52]. Further, adenovirus-specific T cell immunity against conserved epitopes has been shown across various human serotypes and also across species [52]. We observed that the homology between HCV epitopes and different adenoviruses spans across a number of adenoviral proteins, and thus it can possibly be extended to a number of uncommon human and non-human adenoviruses.",

The peptides were selected on the basis of their high sequence homologies with Ad proteins, and detection of cross-reactive responses in mouse experiments. Phyto-hemagglutinin (PHA, 1 \u03bcg/ml) and media-treated cells were considered as positive and negative controls, respectively. After three days of incubation, cells were treated with 1.5 \u03bcg/ml brefeldin A (Cat.# 00\u20134506, eBiosciences Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) for 5 hours, and stained for extracellular lineage markers using fluorochrome-labeled antibodies (purchased from eBiosciences Inc.

Stained cells were measured in a BD FACS Canto, and data were analyzed using FACS Diva software. The CD3+ T cell population was gated for CD4+ and CD8+ subsets and evaluated separately for IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 expression. PBMCs stained with isotype antibodies with corresponding fluorochromes (Cat.# 48\u20134714, 11\u20134714, 12\u20134714, 17\u20134714 and 25\u20134301; purchased from eBiosciences, Inc. San Diego, USA) were used to exclude non-specific binding. Percent increase in cytokine expression was calculated by the formula: [(Antigen treated cells- media control)/ media control] x 100. The percentage of cells positive for IFN-\u03b3, IL-10 and IFN-\u03b3/IL-10 in the media groups ranged from 0.2\u201310% in different donors.",
