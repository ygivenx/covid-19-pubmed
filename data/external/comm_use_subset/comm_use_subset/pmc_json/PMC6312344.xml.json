Indeed, early assessment of the relative contributions of local transmission versus case importation is essential for designing appropriate intervention strategies. For instance, a nosocomial outbreak may be driven by within-hospital transmissions or repeated introductions from the community, calling for different control measures [6,7]. Similarly at a country level, local transmissions and importations of cases from other countries will require different control measures, e.g. social distancing and prevention versus border closing [8,9]. In the case of zoonotic infections, it is also crucial to identify the extent to which within-species transmission and spill-over from the reservoir (i.e. cross-species transmission) contribute to the observed incidence, as illustrated in the case of avian influenza [10,11], bovine tuberculosis [12], or MERS [3,8,9].",

First, it is closely linked to outbreak detection methods, which generally aim to identify excesses of cases compared to a reference \u2018baseline\u2019 in incidence time series [13\u201319], and are for instance routinely used to detect the beginning of seasonal influenza epidemics from surveillance data [20\u201322]. Some extensions to spatiotemporal data [23\u201326] have shown geographic information can be a useful complement to temporal data [27,28], but little efforts have been devoted to generalising these approaches to other types of data such as pathogen whole genome sequences (WGS). Second, the identification of outbreak clusters is also closely related to outbreak reconstruction methods, which infer transmission chains using complex outbreak models integrating multiple sources of data such as time, space, and WGS [29\u201332]. Lastly, population genetics has had a long-standing tradition of developing clustering methods [33\u201335], some of which have proved useful for studying pathogen populations [36,37]. Unfortunately, despite these connections to well-developed methodological fields, the integration of multiple data sources (e.g. epidemiological and genomic data) to identify outbreak clusters remains in its infancy [38].",

This evidence synthesis approach can combine various data streams such as the timing and location of the cases, as well as WGS of the pathogen, to identify such outbreak clusters. Our method relies on the observation that, in an outbreak, individuals who infect one another are likely to be closely related with respect to various characteristics; for instance, their symptom onsets appear within the same time period and in neighbouring locations, and they bear genetically similar pathogen strains. We consider that, to be part of the same outbreak cluster, two cases must be closely related in all relevant data streams. These data sources describe relationships between cases in intrinsically different spaces (e.g., temporal, spatial, genetic), but they can all be used to compute pairwise distances between cases (e.g. number of days between dates of onset, geographic distance between locations, number of mutations between pathogen WGS). We define, for each data stream, a weighted graph, where nodes correspond to cases, and the edge between two cases is weighted by the pairwise distance (for this data stream) between these two cases, so that \u2018heavy\u2019 edges indicate pairs of cases unlikely to have infected one another. To retain only relevant connections, each graph is then pruned by removing heavy edges, defined as edges whose weight exceeds a predefined cutoff distance (Fig 1).",

Typically, such information is available for fully observed outbreaks, which is unlikely to be the case in practice. To address this issue, our approach also accounts for underreporting. We give a general solution to the expected distances between observed cases for a given level of reporting (i.e. fraction of observed cases), as well as some analytical results for common distributions used to describe distances between cases in time (the serial interval), space (the spatial kernel), and for genetic distances (the molecular clock).",

Importantly, the sizes of the clusters also contain information about the underlying transmissibility [8].

Rabies is an important and complex neglected zoonosis mainly transmitted to humans by dogs [40,41]. Campaigns to eliminate canine rabies through the vaccination of dogs, the treatment of all potential human rabies exposures, and the improvement of education about rabies prevention are ongoing but are in many low and middle income countries of limited impact due to the lack of understanding of the dynamics of the disease [42]. In Bangui, the dynamics of rabies is likely relying on a combination of local transmission, i.e. between dogs within the city, and importations, i.e. rabid dogs entering the city from neighbouring locations, therefore providing an interesting model for a proof of concept of our approach [39]. Characterising such dynamics, and in particular the relative importance of local transmission versus importations would be critical to implementing effective control strategies. If local transmission dominates the dynamics, then mass vaccination could be sufficient for control. However, if the repeated importations dominate the dynamics, restricting these and focusing on finding and vaccinating the external \u2018source(s)\u2019 of infections would be more efficient.",

Lower reporting rates and higher quantiles generally led to fewer, larger clusters (S3\u2013S6 Figs). The number of clusters derived varied from 8 to 89 across the scenarios considered. The largest cluster comprised from 21 to 90 cases across scenarios. In all scenarios, the largest cluster included cases occurring in 2007 when a surge in reported cases was observed. The estimates of the reproduction number in the two most extreme scenarios were 0.41 (CI95%: [0.31; 0.52] for a reporting rate of 50% and a cutoff corresponding to the 90% quantile) and 0.98 (CI95%: [0.93; 1.04] for a reporting rate of 10% and a cutoff corresponding to the 98% quantile) respectively.

In our main analysis of simulated datasets aiming to reproduce the Bangui epidemiological situation, the mean sensitivity (measured as the True Positive Rate, TPR, see materials and method) was 99.3% with a mean specificity (measured as the True Negative Rate, TNR) of 99.7%. The corresponding median relative error in the estimated parameters was low, at -2.5% for the reproduction number and -0.8% for the importation rate (see S1 Text for more results). These results were obtained assuming the same reporting rate as in the simulation, and with a cutoff corresponding to the 95% quantile of the input distributions. Using higher quantiles generally led to a higher sensitivity, but a lower specificity. The average between sensitivity and specificity was very high for all but the highest cutoff considered (99.9% quantile), and was maximal for the 95% quantile (S12 and S13 Figs). Misspecifying the reporting rate led to lower performances: underestimating and overestimating the reporting rate were associated respectively with lower specificity and lower sensitivity (Fig 5A). In other simulation scenarios with different reporting rates, using the 95% quantile for pruning led to good although slightly poorer performance, with a mean average between sensitivity and specificity greater than 82%.

On the other hand, non-parametric approaches such as that described in Ypma et al.

Note however that the performance of the method described in Ypma et al.

Importantly, our simulations also highlighted the importance of adequately choosing the cutoffs used at the pruning step. In our rabies application, we used cutoffs corresponding to the 95% quantiles, identified in our simulation study as maximising the average between sensitivity and specificity (S12 and S13 Figs). In practice, optimal cutoffs will likely vary across datasets, diseases and epidemic contexts. Different strategies may be employed to address the issue. First, sensitivity analyses should be performed to study the impact of changing the cutoffs and reporting rates, as has been done here. Second, whenever possible, simulations can be used to identify optimal cutoffs for a specific outbreak context. Finally, further work may be dedicated to developing automated frameworks for the selection of optimal cutoffs from past outbreak data in which clusters have been identified through epidemiological investigations.",

For instance, contact data can readily be incorporated in the form of binary distances, where the distance between cases with a reported contact is zero, and one otherwise. Our approach could use any measure of social [43\u201345] or ecological distances [46], as well as measures of dissimilarity based on reported symptoms (e.g. proportion of different symptoms reported by a pair of cases). Whenever deep sequencing data is available, existing measures of the genetic differentiation between populations can also readily be applied to describe genetic distances between individuals whilst accounting for within-host diversity [47\u201350]. An additional advantage of our approach for data integration is that it does not formally require different data streams to be independent. Rather, independence is a practical condition for the method to be more efficient: ideally, different data sources should be complementary rather than redundant, so that combining them effectively improves the identification of clusters of related cases.",

If fn denotes the input probability density function or probability mass function of expected distances between a case and its infector for data stream n, the cutoff \u03ban for that data stream could then be defined as a predetermined quantile of fn, for instance the 95% quantile. With this approach, two cases would be considered disconnected with respect to data stream n (after the pruning step), if the distance between them dni,j is larger than the 95% quantile of the input distribution fn. Note that, when several independent data sources are combined, the quantile could be chosen to ensure a certain sensitivity. For instance in our application with 3 data streams, a quantile of 95%1/3 \u2248 98% in each of the 3 data streams would lead to an overall sensitivity of 95%. Note however that this assumes independence between all data streams, which in practice would rarely be the case.

If the overall reporting probability, \u03c0, is known, and assuming that the probability of being reported is identical for all cases, the number of unobserved intermediate cases between two observed cases can be described by a geometric distribution with probability \u03c0. Using this property, we propose, in that case, to define the cutoff \u03ban as a quantile of fn,\u03c0, the distribution of the expected distance between an observed case and its closest observed ancestor, accounting for potential unobserved intermediate cases.

For the input distributions fn, we consider specific parametric distributions that are particularly appropriate to describe these three data streams and allow us to derive an analytical formulation for fn,\u03c0, in the presence of underreporting (S1 Text).

            "text": "Transmissibility of a pathogen can be measured using the reproduction number R, defined as the average number of secondary cases infected by a single primary case. Here we assume that the number of secondary cases (or \u2018offsprings\u2019) follows a Poisson distribution with mean R. Intuitively, the final size (i.e. the total number of cases once extinction has occurred) of an outbreak seeded with one infected individual, is related to R. Numerous studies have characterised this relationship and provided formulations to estimate the reproduction number from the final size of naturally extinct outbreaks [8,63]. We built on such methods to account for under-reporting (see S1 Text). Assuming unobserved cases are distributed at random across the outbreaks, this approach adjusts the likelihood of an observed outbreak final size by integrating over all possible unobserved cases in that outbreak. Importantly, this method also accounts for the possibility for some, typically small outbreaks, to go entirely unobserved. The method estimates R, as well as the probability of observing an outbreak, Pobs. An estimate of the number of unobserved outbreaks may then be obtained assuming that it follows a negative binomial distribution characterised by Pobs and the number of observed outbreaks. A full description of the inference on both the reproduction number and the number of importations can be found in S1 Text. The method is implemented and documented in the package branchr for the R software [52], available on github (http://github.com/reconhub/branchr).",
