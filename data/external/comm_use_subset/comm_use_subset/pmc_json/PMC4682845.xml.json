            "text": "A highly pathogenic human coronavirus (CoV)1, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), emerged in Jeddah and other places in Saudi Arabia in September 2012 and spread to some European, African and Asian countries in recent years [1\u20133]. The virus causes symptoms similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), but an additional component is also involved, namely acute renal failure [4]. Up to the 1st October 2015, 1593 people had been infected with MERS and this has led to 568 reported deaths globally (World Health Organization, global alert and response, http://www.who.int/csr/don/01-october-2015-mers-jordan/en/). A serological study of major livestock in Saudi Arabia suggested dromedary camels may be an original reservoir [5, 6]; although recent studies have identified bats may also as the suspected host as a number of bat CoVs show high sequence similarity to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [7, 8] and a bat-CoV was discovered that readily infect human cells using ACE2 as the receptor [9]. Nevertheless, human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV has been confirmed. This May, an infected traveler from the Middle East region returned to his home country of the Republic of Korea and caused an outbreak that revolved around health facilities (http://www.who.int/csr/don/07-july-2015-mers-korea/en/). These findings indicate that it is possible for the virus to spread globally and as such it poses a significant threat to world health and the world economy in general. Therefore studies that help to understand this virus and aid the development of antiviral drugs or other therapies are important.",

            "text": "Similar to other CoVs, after entering the host cells, the nonstructural polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) of MERS-CoV are synthesized and then cleaved by two coronaviral proteases, a main protease (Mpro) (EC 3.4.22.69) and a papain-like protease (EC 3.4.22.46) [10]. This cleavage is considered to be a leading process which is required for viral maturation [11\u201314]. The MERS-CoV Mpro, namely nsp5 of the pp1a proteins (residue 3248\u20133553), has been identified [15]. Like other Mpro, there is a catalytic dyad that consists of a His residue and a Cys residue [16\u201320]. Sequence alignment suggests that MERS-CoV Mpro, in a similar manner to other known Mpro, has a chymotrypsin-like architecture consisting of a catalytic core (domain I and II) and a helical domain III; sequence identities of CoV Mpro protein range from 50% to 80% (S1 Fig). Recently the crystal structure of an inactive MERS-CoV Mpro C148A mutant has confirmed this similarity and the results also suggest that this protein forms a dimer [15]. Furthermore, based on the identification of eleven canonical cleavage sites, the MERS-CoV Mpro should be able to recognize and cleave at the (L/M)-Q-\u2193-(A/S) conserved sequence, which is essential for most CoV Mpro-mediated processing [21, 22]. However, up to now, the correlation between the protein\u2019s structure and the catalytic process remains unclear.",

The crystal structure of the MERS-CoV Mpro at 3.0-\u00c5 resolution is reported. The quaternary structural changes in the MERS-CoV Mpro in the absence and presence of peptide substrates were investigated by analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC). The results of kinetic activity assays indicated that MERS-CoV Mpro exhibits potent proteolytic activity that is associated with a pattern of cooperativity. Some critical residues for dimerization of the protein and catalysis by the protein were verified by site-directed mutagenesis. The present studies provide a foundation for an understanding of the mechanism that controls the monomer-dimer switch at work in MERS-CoV Mpro.",

Unlike SARS-CoV Mpro [25, 28], the MERS-CoV Mpro with 6 x His-tag retained at the C-terminus cannot be expressed. Instead, the bacteria are able to express the Mpro when there is a N-terminal 6 x His-tag fusion that can be removed during the purification. However, thrombin digestion leaves two extra residues (Gly-Ser) at the N-terminus of Mpro, resulting in protein with no proteolytic activity (data not shown). Therefore we used SARS-CoV papain-like protease [12, 30, 34], which is a highly active viral deubiquitinase and does not leave any residues at the N-terminus of Mpro. After gel-filtration, the purity of authentic N-terminus Mpro was about 99% (S2 Fig). The size of the MERS-CoV Mpro was found to be close to 30 kDa, while any uncut protein was located at higher molecular weight position. The typical yield was about 10 mg after purification from 0.8 liter of E. coli culture.",

At first, the dependence of the initial velocity on enzyme concentration was analyzed and showed a nonlinear upward correlation (Fig 2A). The pattern is similar to that of SARS-CoV Mpro, as the monomeric Mpro may not have catalytic activity [28]. However, MERS-CoV Mpro displayed a sigmoid curve for its rate constant pattern at various substrate concentrations (Fig 2B, open circles); this contrast with SARS-CoV Mpro, which exhibited a classical saturation curve (S4 Fig). The results were then fitted to the Hill equation (Eq 2) in order to evaluate the kinetic parameters (Table 2). The kcat (2.33 s-1) of MERS-CoV Mpro is close to that of SARS-CoV Mpro (2.11 s-1), while the Hill constant was 1.8, suggesting a significant degree of positive cooperativity among the Mpro protomers. The comparable activity levels of the two Mpro in the present study is dissimilar to the results obtained during a recent study in which the activity of the MERS-CoV Mpro was found to be 5-fold lower than that of SARS-CoV [14]. Using different substrates may cause the difference. Tomar et al. [14] used a longer peptide substrate with residues present at both P and P\u2019 site. However, in the present studies we used a peptide substrate that contains only P site residues. Besides, they utilized FRET substrate and could only be used at low substrate concentrations to prevent the inner-filter effect, while we are able to use higher substrate concentrations to capture the kinetic parameters.",

As a result of the above, we investigated the quaternary structure of the Mpro by AUC (Fig 3). The cumulative spectra (Fig 3A) were analyzed using the continuous c(s) distribution model and the results suggested that MERS-CoV Mpro is a monomer in phosphate buffer (S5 Fig) and this contrasts with a distribution of 30% monomer and 70% dimer in the presence of 600 \u03bcM TQ6-pNA (Fig 3B). We also measured the size distribution of Mpro at various TQ6-pNA concentrations (S6 Fig). The results indicated that the sedimentation coefficient of the major species was shifted as the substrate dosage changed (S6B Fig). More substrate led to the major species moving close to the dimer position.",

It is unable to confirm that our observation is a substrate-induced or substrate/product-induced dimerization. To solve this, a modified AUC technique, AEC [33], was utilized to detect the quaternary structure change in the absence and presence of substrate (Fig 4). Here the enzyme solution was put into the small well of band-forming centerpiece and then flowed into the substrate-containing channel when the centrifugation began. During the centrifugation, the protein layer gradually sediment and continuously met peptide substrates. Not surprisingly, there was a broad distribution between the monomer and dimer species in the presence of 200 \u03bcM peptide substrate, while a major species shifted to the dimer in 400 \u03bcM substrate (Fig 4B). It suggests that MERS-CoV Mpro acts as a rapid self-associated and substrate-induced dimerization. Using different strategies, Tomar et al. [14] confirmed that inhibitor binding can also induce and maintain the dimerization of Mpro. On the other hand, we measured the velocity of the product formation during the centrifugation; although the rate (0.017 \u03bcM/s) is 10-fold lower than that by the spectrometric assay (Fig 4B).",

Here the equivalent residue, Glu169, was mutated and its influence on MERS-CoV Mpro evaluated (Fig 1B). Not surprisingly, compared to the wild-type enzyme, the activity (kcat) of E169A showed a 6-fold decrease (Fig 2B, open diamonds and Table 2). Furthermore, AUC analysis suggested that this enzyme consisted of a single species close to monomeric form even in the presence of substrate (Fig 3E). The Kd values of the E169A mutant without substrate was 14 \u03bcM, which is 2-fold higher than that of the wild-type and this did not decrease in the presence of substrate (Table 2). The results suggest that mutation of Glu169 is able to block substrate-induced dimerization and that this results in a decrease in enzyme activity. Unexpectedly, as well as the monomer, some octamer (6.3%) with a sedimentation coefficient of 4.9 S was observed in the presence of substrate (Fig 3E). Previous studies have suggested that a super-active octamer of SARS-CoV Mpro can be locked by 3D domain swapping [35]. In this study, the presence of the octamer form of the MERS-CoV Mpro E169A mutant in the presence of substrate may explain why this mutant is not totally inactive. Taking the above as a whole, the dual role of the conserved Glu residue in catalysis and dimerization is consistent for both Mpro.",

Based on the sequence alignment, three residues in the dimerization interface vary in coronaviral Mpro sequences (S1 Fig). In SARS-CoV Mpro, residues Arg4, Ser123 and Arg298 are different to the equivalent ones in MERS-CoV Mpro, which are Val4, Thr126 and Met298, respectively. Based on the above, three single mutants, V4R, T126S and M298R, were generated and their proteolytic activity and dimerization were assessed. Unexpectedly, both the V4R and the T126S mutant showed a higher Kd for the dimer to monomer and a lower level of activity than wild-type Mpro (Fig 2B and Table 2). Kd values were decreased by 1.5-fold to 2.4-fold for the two mutants in the presence of substrate, which suggests reduced substrate-induced dimerization (Fig 3C and 3D). Based on the current structure, residue Val4 showed a hydrophobic contact with another protomer\u2019s residue Gly141 (Fig 1B). Mutation of valine to arginine may lose the contact. Furthermore, the side chain of residue Val131 of MERS-CoV Mpro is hydrophobic while that of the equivalent residue, Cys128 of SARS-CoV Mpro, is hydrophilic (Fig 1B). Val131 is close to the Arg4 and will disfavor the electrostatic interaction of Arg4\u2026Glu290 in MERS-CoV Mpro. These variance may result in V4R failed to form a stable dimer. For the T126S mutant, after compared with the other two MERS-CoV Mpro structures (PDB entry 4YLU and 4WME), we found that the side chain of Thr126 is free of rotation. It is able to make a hydrophobic interaction with the residue Tyr121, resulting in a 180\u00b0-rotation of the phenol ring, and lead to a hydrogen-bond with the backbone amide of Leu144 (Fig 1B). It further results in the side chain of Leu144 toward another protomer\u2019s Ile300 and make a hydrophobic contact for the two protomers. Mutation of Thr126 to serine will lose this contact and may disfavor the dimerization.",

The Kd value for the mutant in the absence and presence of substrate were 1.1 and 0.7 \u03bcM, respectively, which are very close to those for SARS-CoV Mpro (Table 2). Furthermore, the stable dimer form showed higher proteolytic activity and the mutation transformed the enzymes rate constant pattern at various substrate concentrations into a classical saturation curve (Fig 2C, open triangles). In addition, the Km of the M298R mutant is 5.8-fold lower than that of SARS-CoV Mpro, which suggests a higher substrate binding affinity (Table 2). It can be concluded that mutation of residue Met298 to arginine within the MERS-CoV Mpro results in the stabilization of the dimer formation, which in turn gives rise to more efficient catalysis. Based on our structure, Arg298 is able to make a hydrogen bonding interaction with Thr126. Residue Thr126 can be replaced by serine because the T126S/M298R double mutant also shows similar dimerization characteristics (Fig 3G) and saturated catalytic pattern to that of the M298R mutant (Fig 2C, open hexagons and Table 2).

To further delineate the binding of substrate to the enzyme, ITC was used to measure the Kd for the substrate (or substrate/product)-enzyme complex and the binding stoichiometry (N) (Fig 5). During the titration, the enzymatic hydrolysis might produce additional heat, resulting in higher \u0394H. So we can only compared the N and Kd of the wild-type Mpro with those of E169A and M298R mutants. The three enzymes exhibited similar N (0.89 to 1.06) and Kd (14.2 to 20.3 \u03bcM). This suggested that the monomeric and dimeric Mpro show quite the same substrate binding affinity. Such phenomenon is also found in monomeric and dimeric SARS-CoV Mpro, whose N and Kd for the same substrate were 0.97 to 1.05 and 29.9 to 33.8 \u03bcM, respectively [28]. With the Km ((k-1+kcat)/k1), kcat and Kd (k-1/k1), we are able to calculate the k1 and k-1, the rate of the association and dissociation of the enzyme-substrate complex. The k1 and k-1 for the M298R mutant and substrate is 0.049 s-1\u03bcM-1 and 0.98 s-1, while those for SARS-CoV Mpro is 0.00246 s-1\u03bcM-1 and 0.084 s-1. The rate constants for M298R mutant showed 20- and 12-fold higher than those for SARS-CoV Mpro. The more rapid association and relatively slower dissociation of enzyme-substrate complex may be used to explain why the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of the MERS-CoV Mpro M298R mutant is higher than that of SARS-CoV Mpro (Table 2).",

Biochemical and AUC studies indicated that MERS-CoV Mpro shows almost the same proteolytic activity as SARS-CoV Mpro; although it is a monomer in aqueous buffer and displays substrate-induced dimerization (Fig 6). A conserved residue, Glu169, plays an essential role in the substrate-induced dimerization of both MERS-CoV Mpro and SARS-CoV Mpro. Moreover, mutation of a residue in the dimerization interface, M298R, was found to result in a more stable dimer form in aqueous buffer that had higher enzyme activity; while other two mutations, V4R and T126S, showed the reverse effect. Critical assessment of the residues important to dimerization of and catalysis by MERS-CoV Mpro provides valuable insights into the mechanism that controls the monomer-dimer switch of important and valuable enzyme.",
