However, in towns where the mental health service and local government were small, or in scenarios where participants had conflict schedules with our focus-group sessions, individual interviews were also conducted \u2013 this allowed some more in-depth exploration of these individuals\u2019 experiences. In total, 25 individual interviews were conducted (Table 4 Participant characteristics); these lasted for 40 to 60 min. All participants were required to complete a demographic questionnaire at the beginning of each interview. The focus groups and individual interviews were conducted by Mental Health Crisis Intervention and Stress Management Center affiliated Beijing Anding Hospital staff. All staff had been trained in facilitation of focus groups and individual interviews. To ensure we had developed a comprehensive interview guideline to reflect the mental health workers\u2019 experience and views, we conducted a systematic literature review. Using Pub-Med, Web of Science, PsycINFO, we searched for scientific literature, guidelines, and manuals in English or Chinese language using search terms including \u201cdisaster\u201d, \u201cemergency\u201d, \u201cmental health\u201d, \u201cpublic emergency\u201d, \u201cMental Health Crisis\u201d, \u201cmental health Intervention\u201d, \u201cpsychological first aid\u201d, \u201cexpert consensus\u201d, and \u201cguidelines\u201d.
