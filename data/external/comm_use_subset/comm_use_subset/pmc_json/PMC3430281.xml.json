In our previous studies, we established thin layer chromatography (TLC) identification and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay methods for the quality control of Radix Isatidis using R,S-goitrin as the marker [30], and these methods have been adopted by the ChP 2010 Edition [1].

The samples from different locations of the same type (crude herbs or prepared slices) were still clustered into one group, and the eight bioactive components were mostly close, which indicates the similarity of internal quality of the samples in the same type. Furthermore, eight marker constituents were found to be specific variables, which could provide the most discrimination and quality control of Radix Isatidis and its finished products by quantitative analysis. The PCA loading plot identified the greatest impact factor of characteristic constituents to the classification. In addition, this chromatographic method was efficient and rapid in distinguishing Radix Isatidis from other species such as NBLG.",
