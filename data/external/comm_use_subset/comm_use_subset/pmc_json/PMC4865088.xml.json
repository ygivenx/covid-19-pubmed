Numerous studies have shown that 5\u201310% of respiratory tract infections in children are related to hMPV [3]. Currently, four different hMPV genotypes have been identified: A1, A2, B1, and B2, where A2 has been divided into subgroups A2a and A2b [4]. Similar as for the closely related respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [5] it has been proposed that the different hMPV genotypes induce disease of variable severity, but this is a matter of debate [6\u20138]. Despite normally causing mild disease in the upper airways, hMPV infections in the lower respiratory tract resulting in bronchiolitis or pneumonia are occasionally observed [8,9].",

Further, most of the limited number of studies available have been performed in cellular or animal models and studies based on human material are lacking. The severe cases of hMPV infection could be caused by an expression pattern of interferons (IFNs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines promoting pathological lung tissue damage, as reported for RSV [10]. Moreover, other possible mediators of severe hMPV infection are inflammasomes [11,12]. In addition to providing an important defense mechanism against infections, activation of the inflammasome has been shown to result in unfavorable pathogenic events e.g. after infection with influenza virus in animal lung [13]. The inflammasome is a multicomponent protein complex involved in the innate immune response and is activated by intracellular pathogens such as viruses [11]. The active inflammasome is able to cleave pro-IL-1\u03b2 and pro-IL-18 into their active forms resulting in secretion of these pro-inflammatory cytokines and activation of specific receptors on cells. Several NLR proteins have been identified including NLRP3, which is involved in the antiviral response to respiratory tract viruses such as influenza- and RS-virus [14,15].",

To this end, we determined the gene expression of type I, II and III IFNs, IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-28 in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) and protein levels in blood plasma from hMPV positive children hospitalized with respiratory tract infection. Importantly, the NPAs were confirmed to be hMPV single-positive without viral co-infections. Further, we determined the expression of genes involved in the inflammasome-mediated antiviral response: I\u03baB\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-18 and NLRP3. We also evaluated the presence of the chemokines IP-10, Gro-\u03b1, and Gro-\u03b2, the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in addition to the type I/III IFN-induced ISG54. The results from the gene expression analysis were compared to clinical data condensed into a severity index. This comparison indicated a correlation between the severity of disease and increased expression of inflammasome-associated genes. This study is the first to concomitantly determine mRNA expression and protein levels of inflammatory genes and inflammasome components in children hospitalized with acute hMPV infection.",

While type I IFNs are produced by many different cell types, type III IFNs seems to be mostly produced by plasmacytoid dendritic and epithelial cells where the epithelial cells are the main targets for activity [21]. Due to their powerful and potentially harmful effects, the production of these cytokines is tightly regulated [22]. Our results showed that the type I IFN-\u03b2 mRNA in NPA was marginally up-regulated for the A2 infected patients, but the protein concentrations in plasma were markedly increased for both A2 and B2 positive patients. This inconsistency could be explained by the protein being produced by tissue resident cells in e.g. the lung or lymph nodes. Another explanation could be a lag in the induction of protein synthesis in the epithelial cells after the elevation of mRNA transcription, since it is assumed that cytokines are able to enter the bloodstream from lung tissue during inflammation. For type III IFN IL-28 we observed increased mRNA expression both for A2 and B2 infected children. However, IL-28 protein was not significantly elevated in blood plasma. IL-28 is prominently expressed in lung epithelial cells, and suggested to prevent viral invasion through skin and mucosal surfaces [23]. Hence, the lack of increased IL-28 protein in blood could, similar as suggested for IFN-\u03b2, be explained by a lag in the induction of protein synthesis.",

Further, elevated levels of IP-10 protein, and also of the chemokines Gro-\u03b1 and Gro-\u03b2 were found in blood plasma. IP-10 has previously been shown to be significantly elevated seven days post infection with hMPV A2 in mice [27]. The expression of IP-10 may be induced by IFN-\u03b3 [28], IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 [29] or TNF-\u03b1 [30] secreted by different immune-cells. In our study, despite elevated IP-10, we did not measure any increased expression of the type II interferon IFN-\u03b3 at mRNA or plasma protein levels. The lack of IFN-\u03b3 detection in NPAs from hMPV infected children has also recently been reported elsewhere [31]. Our data suggests that IFN-\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, which was significantly detectable in plasma, might be responsible for induction of IP-10. In addition, IFN-\u03b3-independent induction of IP-10 has been demonstrated in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells [32]. In this setting the type III interferon IL-29, which is closely related to IL-28 that was shown to be upregulated herein, was correlated to IP-10 induction. Of note, when infecting human epithelial cells with hMPV in vitro, we observed that IL-28 mRNA was induced and that IL-29 showed a similar trend (data not shown), as also suggested elsewhere [24]. Hence, IL-28/29 could mediate IFN-\u03b3 independent IP-10 induction in hMPV infection. IFN-\u03b3-independent IP-10 expression has also previously been reported in BAL samples from patients during respiratory tract virus infection [33].",

An explanation for this could be different expression kinetics for mRNA and protein. TNF-\u03b1 induces NF-\u03baB [34] and, among other functions, it is involved in the recruitment of neutrophilic cells to the lungs [35]. TNF-\u03b1 production has previously been shown to be at high levels in nasopharyngeal secretions from RS- or influenza-virus infected children [36]. When comparing the patients with a severity index of 0 and those with an index of 1\u20134, TNF-\u03b1 had significantly higher levels of expression (P<0.001, Student\u2019s t-test). This could indicate that the presence of TNF-\u03b1 in the respiratory tract directly or indirectly affects the severity of disease in hMPV infected children. It is worth mentioning that the hMPV Ct value was similar for the patients with severity index 0 and higher (S1 Table), suggesting similar extent of viral replication in these patients.",

The mRNA expression was up-regulated for both hMPV A2- and B2-positive NPA samples. ISG54 is known to be induced by viruses downstream of pattern recognition receptors and IFNs [37]. The expression of ISGs is initiated by type I and type III interferons such as IFN-\u03b2 and IL-28. We did indeed find that these IFNs were up-regulated at mRNA and/or protein level in hMPV infected children. The functional effects and clinical involvement of ISG54 are largely unknown. Nevertheless, ISG54 has been shown to inhibit viral replication in vitro and in vivo [38]. Interestingly, mice lacking ISG54 have recently been shown to be subject to high mortality when infected with the mouse respiratory tract pathogen Sendai virus\u2014a negative sense, single-stranded RNA paramyxovirus [39]. This suggests that ISG54 has a protective function and limits pathogenesis in mice. However, in our study, we were not able to identify any differences with respect to length of hospitalization or severity index when comparing the groups of patients expressing ISG54 or not (P>0.05, Student\u2019s t-test), suggesting a general protective function of this cytokine in children.",

Interestingly, some patients showed distinct expression profiles with elevated levels of several genes involved in the inflammasome mediated immune-response. More specific, approximately 1/4 of the patients showed increased expression of I\u03baB\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and NLRP3. As mentioned earlier, the repressor gene I\u03baB\u03b1 expression is induced by NF-\u03baB activation [19]. NF-\u03baB induces mRNA expression of the potent pro-inflammatory cytokines pro-IL-1\u03b2 and pro-IL-18 [40]. Further, increased level of NLRP3 mRNA expression is the initial essential step in activating the NLRP3-inflammasome. Taken together, the increased levels of NLRP3 mRNA in this group of children along with enhanced IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 mRNA expression and protein secretion could suggest that the NLRP3-inflammasome is activated to produce IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 in the respiratory tract of these patients. Previously, it has been shown that influenza virus is able to activate the NLRP3-inflammasome in mice [14]. This was found to be critical for survival and reduction of viral titers in mice lung. Further, RSV was recently shown to activate the NLRP3-inflammasome in vitro using primary human lung epithelial cells [15]. Our results show that the hMPV infected children with a severity score exceeding zero more frequently exhibited elevated levels of IL-1\u03b2 and NLRP3 than children with severity score zero. This suggests a possible involvement of these genes in hMPV infected children with severe disease.",

We found no differences in gene expression profiles (data not shown). In addition, the average age of children with severity score 1\u20134 was not significantly different from those with severity score zero (P = 0.28, Student\u2019s t-test), indicating that the youngest children where not more disposed to severe disease compared to the older. Of note, there was a difference in age distribution between hMPV-infected and control children. The controls were symptom-free and screened for the same airway pathogens as the patient samples, and no pathogens were detected. Hence, we would not anticipate that the inflammatory genes are expressed above a basal level in the controls.

For studies aimed to examine immune responses to a particular viral infection in vivo it is a challenge, especially in children, to obtain sufficient number of samples collected at similar conditions. In particular, interfering viral and bacterial co-infections are common. In our study population extensive viral analyses of each sample revealed that nearly half of the population had viral co-infections and were excluded from further analysis. In addition, bacterial infections were unlikely because most children had received one or more conjugated pneumococcal vaccinations, and only patients with maximal CRP levels less than 100 mg/L were included. Furthermore, we only included samples that were collected within the first week after onset of symptoms. Finally, separating the samples based on the two most frequent hMPV genotypes enabled us to see if there was a genotype-specific cytokine gene expression profile or differences in disease severity. This allowed us to study the initial host immune response towards particular hMPV genotypes, which extends current literature. However, our selection criteria limited the total number of patients that were eligible for our study.
