A platform for the rapid generation of recombinant vaccines is required for mankind. Human parainfluenza virus type 2 (hPIV2) is a negative-stranded paramyxovirus with little pathogenicity for healthy adults. A reverse genetics method to generate clonal populations of recombinant RNA viruses enabled us to use hPIV2 as a vector for efficient transgene expression1\u20133. Since hPIV2 induces no alterations of the host genome and causes repeated infection throughout a human\u2019s lifetime due to incomplete immunity against hPIV24, it is an ideal vector for delivering a vaccine antigen.",

This is what happens with EBOV-GP7,8. However, double mutations9,10 in the GP gene (F88A/F535A) completely abrogated the GP-mediated proliferation of the recombinant BC-PIV in vitro (Figs 2 and 3b) while retaining the antigenicity. In addition, mutations within the GP1 region were introduced to prevent RNA editing11 without affecting the amino acid sequence (Fig. 3a,b). The resultant vaccine BC-PIV/EBOV-GP incorporated a large amount of GP protein on the viral particles, as shown in the Western blot analysis (Fig. 1c).",

            "text": "The ability of the EBOV vaccine to induce efficient humoral immunity (IgG1 and IgG2a) in mice was revealed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay measuring the specific antibody titer of the sera (>100,000 \u00d7 dilution, data not shown) and a pseudotype virus-based inhibition assay15 measuring the neutralizing antibody titer of the sera (Fig. 5a,b). These titers were comparable to those induced by Ebola VLPs in mice16, or by chimeric hPIV3 bearing the EBOV GP in guinea pigs8. Antibodies elicited by BC-PIV/EBOV-GP also induced antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE)17 of pseudotyped EBOV infection (Fig. 5c). The ADE activities induced by BC-PIV/EBOV GP were also comparable to those induced by Ebola VLPs in mice16 and those of the sera from monkeys that survived challenge with EBOV16. A sufficient neutralizing activity of the sera indicates that the ADE effects were overcome by the inhibitory effects of the sera in virus infection. Replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)/EBOV-GP was previously reported to protect against lethal EBOV challenge in nonhuman primates7,18, thereby CD4+ T cell-depleted animals succumbed to EBOV infection due to a lack of induction of specific antibodies while the CD8+ T cell-depleted ones survived19. These findings suggested that antibodies play an important role in VSV/EBOV-GP-mediated protection against EBOV challenge. Although BC-PIV/EBOV-GP would not propagate in vivo in contrast to VSV/EBOV-GP, toxicity and protection studies in primates will still be required in the future.",

We made three types of recombinant vaccines against the ectodomain of matrix protein 2 (M2e) peptide of influenza A virus, designated as BC-PIV/M2e. In these vaccines, the M2e peptide 2\u201325 (SLLTEVETPIRNEWGCRCNDSSDP) was loaded either inside, outside, or at both sides of the viral envelope of BC-PIV by fusing the M2e peptide gene with the C-terminus of hPIV2 F gene or with that of the HN gene. For the construction of the inside version, the M2e peptide gene was fused with the F gene and stably transfected into Vero cells as packaging cells to produce the recombinant vectors. For the outside version, the M2e peptide gene was fused with the HN gene in the hPIV2 genome and used to produce the recombinant vectors in the Vero/BC-F cells or genetically modified Vero cells expressing M2e-fused F protein. Since F and HN proteins are oppositely oriented across the viral membrane, these strategies work (Fig. 1b,d). The M2e peptide was detected by a Western blot analysis in each case (Fig. 1d). The bands of the inside peptide are more abundant than those of the outside peptide. This may have resulted from differences in the expression of these peptides: the inside peptide was derived from its abundant and stable expression in the packaging cells, while the outside peptide was derived from transcripts from the vector. However, the possibility of better incorporation or enhanced stability of the inside-peptide, compared with the outside peptide, cannot be excluded.",

The viruses were inactivated with 0.01% BPL (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corp., Osaka, Japan) at 4 \u00b0C for 17 h, followed by inactivation of BPL at 37 \u00b0C for 3 h. B16 cells (2 \u00d7 106) were subcutaneously injected into the right side of the back of five-week-old female C57BL/6 mice. Nine days after the transplantation of the B16 cells, BC-PIV/gp100 & WT1 (1 \u00d7 107 TCID50/100 \u03bcL of PBS), dacarbazine (100 mg/kg) (Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), and PBS were subcutaneously injected into the left side of the back of the mice three times at an interval of 3 days. The mice for analysis were anesthetized with diethyl ether and perfused via the vascular system with 0.1M PB (pH 7.4) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PB. The transplanted tumor mass was resected, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PB at 4 \u00b0C for 24 h, cryoprotected with 20% sucrose in PB for 48 h, and frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C with dry ice powder.

After washing for 30 min (3 washes of 10 min each) with PBS-T, sections were incubated with a Cy3-conjugated anti-rat IgG Ab (1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc, West Grove, PA, USA) at RT for 2 h and washed with PBS-T for 30 min.
