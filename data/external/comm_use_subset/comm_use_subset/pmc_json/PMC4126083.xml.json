However, Lactococcus lactis strains are in constant transit through the GIT after ingestion of fermented dairy and vegetable products, and a few studies have shown that they can exert beneficial effects [20]. Among these, Nishitani et al.[22] demonstrated that L. lactis subsp. cremoris FC possess potent anti-inflammatory activity. Oral administration of L. lactis FC reduced inflammatory cytokine production as well as inducible nitric oxide expression in dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice, suggesting that orally administered L. lactis FC may have a beneficial impact in human IBD [22]. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the potential mechanisms involved in the anti-inflammatory effects of L. lactis strains that are still poorly understood.",

To investigate whether L. lactis has an anti-inflammatory effect on IECs, the ability of the strains to block IL-8 secretion induced by IL-1\u03b2 was analysed. Caco-2 cells secreted baseline levels of IL-8, which increased after stimulation with IL-1\u03b2. None of the live cell fractions were able to reduce IL-1\u03b2-induced IL-8 secretion (Figure 1A); however, the supernatant of NCDO 2118 cultures reduced the production of IL-8 by 45% (Figure 1B), whereas the other 2 supernatants did not show similar effects.

The effect of oral administration of this strain was tested in a murine model of chemically induced colitis during the remission period and after a second colitis cycle. This experimental protocol mimics the remission and active periods of IBD. As shown in Figure 2B, the body weight of mice significantly decreased during DSS treatment compared to the body weight of water-treated mice (control group). After DSS withdrawal, the mice gradually recovered their body weight in all experimental groups. Treatment with L. lactis NCDO 2118 did not contribute to a significant change in weight gain (Figure 2B). A reduction in colon length at day 14 in the DSS and DSS + NCDO2118 groups was also observed (Figure 2C). Nevertheless, at the end of the experiment on day 21, oral treatment with L. lactis led to the restoration of colon length (Figure 2C). Mice consuming L. lactis exhibited significantly reduced clinical symptoms (macroscopic inflammatory score) in the recovery phase and upon colitis induction (Figure 2D), despite the severity of inflammation after the second colitis cycle. These findings suggest that L. lactis NCDO2118 administered in vivo has an anti-inflammatory effect.",
