            "text": "This literature review was conducted in four phases. The first phase consisted of a general search in PubMed for the term \u201cOne Health\u201d for any literature published up to December 2014. This search returned 1,682 articles, with the oldest article from January 1953. The articles found by the general search term \u201cOne Health\u201d were not necessarily linked to zoonoses but had a multitude of meanings, such as One Health district, region authority, system, care, resource, sciences, etc. Literature published beginning in November 2006 was more associated to zoonoses. In order to examine the effect of the 2007 definition of One Health, we excluded articles prior to 2007 with no link to zoonosis. After exclusion of such articles, an advanced search using the term \u201czoonosis\u201d AND \u201cOne Health\u201d returned 193 articles published from January 2007 to December 2014. Similarly, an advanced search for the term \u201czoonoses\u201d AND \u201cOne Health\u201d identified 188 articles from January 2007 to December 2014. Through an advanced search, \u201czoonosis AND one health\u201d and \u201czoonoses AND one health\u201d terms were searched for the period between January 2007 and December 2014. The articles found were then categorized based on the type of journals in which the articles were published. For the second phase, \u201cOne Health\u201d was searched as a Medical subject heading (MeSH)17 term, which is the National Library of Medicine controlled vocabulary thesaurus used for indexing articles. In the third phase, One Health advocate organizations were found using Google search engine. During the final phase, \u201cOne Health\u201d was searched in Google scholar and examined by Google trends, which analyzes the number of searches for terms in Google.18 Google ngram was then used to to analyze the use of the terms in Google books.19",

Even though One Health has multiple definitions accorded to it by its various advocates, the common theme that has emerged is collaboration across sectors.20 The development of Rift Valley fever vaccine by the CDC is one of the noteworthy successes of One Health\u2019s collaborative action.21 Such collaboration needs to expand to developing countries at all levels of health care delivery, risk communication, and research. Uninterrupted, accessible, and indispensable information from a reliable source is central to achieving the One Health goals. The most popular, peer reviewed, reliable, and freely available medical and veterinary literature database is PubMed. Physicians, veterinarians, basic science researchers, and eco-health professionals often rely on PubMed for their basic scientific information searchers.",

            "text": "The purpose of this literature review was to identify how the term One Health is used in the medical literature and to identify one health advocates. We were able to identify and list the major One Health advocates through a Google search, where OIE emerges as the most prominent advocate. However, a PubMed search for One Health has shown the zoonoses linkage to the term from the year 2007 only, and this correlates with the joint declaration made on One Health by AVMA and AMA in 2007. Prior to 2007, One Health had many connotations to health in the medical literature. Our results have shown that there is a sustained use of the term One Health from 2007 onwards, with an accelerated use in 2013 and 2014. However, an incomplete adherence to the usage of One Health linking zoonoses in the medical literature is evident, and this practice of poor adherence will potentially impede the implementation of the goals of One Health initiatives. The systems approach of One Health is practical, cost effective, and involves the sustainable, multidisciplinary support of academia and various organizations to undertake more rigorous scientific research for countering the accelerated rise of zoonoses. Such research inquiry on zoonoses compels the correct use of terminologies that are acceptable and comprehensible, without any misuse and misunderstanding in the medical literature. The term One Health suits the current demand of multidisciplinary scientists involved in the development of this term, which evolved with consensus and feedback from multiple disciplines over time. Therefore, we suggest creating a MeSH term for One Health in the PubMed database that could be under the MeSH tree structures of Health [N01. 400] similar to family health, public health, rural health, occupational health, and veteran\u2019s health to support more specific research on zoonoses. Furthermore, exploring the possibility of a comprehensive, definitive definition for the term One Health is a necessity to promote One Health, global health, and evidence based public health.",
