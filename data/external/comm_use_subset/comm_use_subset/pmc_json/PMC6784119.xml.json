            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a beta coronavirus, causes severe and lethal acute respiratory disease in humans and is remarkably different from other human coronaviruses, including HCoV-229E, HCoVNL63, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-OC43, which are known to cause mild respiratory infections [1,2]. Until May 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) had received 2428 laboratory-confirmed cases from 27 countries after MERS-CoV was identified in 2012; these cases included 838 deaths related to MERS-CoV infections and had a case fatality rate of 35% [3]. In May 2015 the MERS outbreak in South Korea, which was the largest outbreak outside the Middle East and caused 36 deaths in 186 cases from a single infected person [4,5]; this outbreak raised the concerns of a potential global MERS-CoV pandemic. However, there are currently no licensed therapeutic drugs or prophylactic vaccines available to protect against MERS-CoV. Vaccination is the best way to control and prevent infectious diseases [6]. Since MERS-CoV is a respiratory pathogen, any MERS-CoV vaccination that induces antigen-specific secretory IgA (sIgA) antibodies at the mucosal surfaces probably has the effects of preventing MERS-CoV replication at the site of virus infection [7]. The mode of MERS-CoV transmission is not clearly understood, but one study has proven that the human intestinal tract may be a new transmission route for MERS-CoV [8], indicating that antigen-specific sIgA antibodies in the gastrointestinal mucosa are a considerable indicator. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop an effective mucosal immune vaccine against MERS-CoV, especially those inducing gastrointestinal mucosal immunity.",

            "text": "Up to date, researchers have developed a number of promising approaches for MERS-CoV vaccine candidates, including DNA vaccines [9,10,11], recombinant viral vectors [12,13,14,15,16,17,18], and protein-based platforms [6,19]. However, no vaccines have entered clinical trials except for a DNA vaccine that completed phase I clinical trials [20]. Each of these different MERS-CoV vaccine approaches has its own advantages and disadvantages, such as immunogenicity, ease of mass production, and preexisting immunity in addition to having potential adverse effects. These factors must be taken into account and balanced to create a successful vaccine for use in humans and/or animals. Subunit vaccines, consisting of the major pathogen antigenic fragments, possess many advantages, such as minimal side effects, high safety profiles, and a high yield [21,22]. Until now, some studies have shown that the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the MERS-CoV spike (S) protein was a major antigenic determinant for the induction of neutralizing antibodies and as an essential target for a MERS subunit vaccine [7,22,23,24,25,26]. Meanwhile, a previous study has identified that the most stable and neutralizing viral RBD fragment is S377-588 from the five following known versions: S350-588, S358-588, S367-588, S367-606 and S377-588 [27]. Therefore, S377-588 of the MERS-CoV S protein is potentially useful for designing an effective vaccine.",

Displaying heterologous pathogen proteins on the surface of bacteria is a rational way to enhance the immunogenicity of a vaccine [29]. A novel surface display system contains nonliving and genetically unmodified gram-positive enhancer matrix (GEM) particles and a protein anchor (PA) from the Lactococcus lactis peptidoglycan hydrolase AcmA, which is the GEM-PA surface display system. The GEM-PA surface display system is a flexible, effective, inexpensive, and easy-to-handle alternative for heterologous proteins and peptides on GEM particles [30]; this system has been applied to parasite oral vaccines [31], Streptococcus pneumoniae mucosal vaccines [32], and porcine circovirus type 2 vaccines [33], among others.",

The number of LysMs in proteins affects the efficiency of foreign proteins binding to the GEM [34]. Some studies showed that three LysM domains in fusion proteins have optimal peptidoglycan-binding activities and biological functions [36,37]. A previous study shown that two LysM domains in fusion proteins have a much stronger binding activity than the others [30]. Therefore, further study on the number of LysMs in proteins is necessary. LysM domains are often parted from the other domains and from each other through linker sequences, conveying LysM domain mobility and flexibility to the fused target protein and allowing the proteins to attain an optimal orientation in binding with the cell wall [35]. However, the linker peptides between the PA and antigen proteins have yet to be explored for their influence on the binding affinity and immunogenicity of the fusion protein.",

The resulting construct was digested with XbaI and KpnI and then inserted into the pFastBac1-HBM plasmid (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) to generate the recombinant plasmid pFastBac1-RLP2. To construct the recombinant genes RLP3 and RP3, the genes were amplified by PCR and inserted into the pFastBac1-HBM plasmid with XbaI and KpnI digestion, generating the recombinant plasmids pFastBac1-RLP3 and pFastBac1-RP3, respectively.

According to the relative binding quantity on the Coomassie brilliant blue-stained polyacrylamide gels, with the increase in binding culture supernatant volume of 0.5 U GEM particles, the relative quantity of binding fusion proteins increased, and the relative quantity of all fusion proteins in 8 mL and 10 mL volumes was similar; this result suggests that the GEM particles binding the fusion proteins have been saturated.

Splenocytes were collected from immunized mice and were ex vivo restimulated with RBD; then, the Th1 (IFN-r, TNF-a, and IL-2) and Th2 (IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10) cytokines in the supernatants were detected by ELISA. The levels of these cytokines in the RLP3-GEM with GEL01 group were significantly higher than those in the RLP3-GEM group (Figure 6). The ELISpot assay showed that the amount of splenocytes secreting IFN-r and IL-4 was also remarkably increased in the RLP3-GEM with GEL01 group, similar to the results of the ELISA. Overall, the above data showed that RLP3-GEM with GEL01 induced the secretion of the Th1 and Th2 cytokines, suggesting a stronger immune response than RLP3-GEM.",

Previous results showed that MERS-CoV RBD-based subunit vaccines have displayed effective immunogenicity against MERS-CoV challenges in mice [6,22,24]. Some studies have shown that the recombinant RBD of MERS-CoV spike protein with intranasal vaccination induced more robust local mucosal immune responses in the lung and stronger systemic cellular immune responses than that with subcutaneous vaccination in mice, demonstrating that intranasal RBD-based subunit vaccines are a safe and effective means to prevent MERS-CoV infections [42]. A study demonstrated that MERS-CoV could replicate robustly in human primary intestinal epithelial cells, intestinal organoids, and small intestine explants and could resist fed-state gastrointestinal fluids, causing enteric MERS-CoV infection [8]. Therefore, it is extremely important for MERS-CoV vaccination to induce respiratory and gastrointestinal mucosal immunity. In this study, we developed RBD-based MERS-CoV subunit vaccines with a novel bacterial antigen display system and evaluated the immunogenicity of specific mucosal immunity in lung and intestinal mucosa and the systemic immune responses due to immunization via the intranasal route.",

Lactococcus lactis has a long history of use in foods and is recognized as safe [43]. The particles boiled in acids mainly consist of bacterial-shaped peptidoglycan spheres, lack other cell wall components and intracellular materials and are recognized as being especially safe [28]. The particles can bind to exogenous antigens by a PA with a high affinity and a high loading capacity [30]. In addition to the above advantages, the particles can bind to the chimeric anchor fusion proteins in culture medium at room temperature in an efficient, strong, and selective manner; the particles can only need a one-step centrifugation process to obtain the purified fusion proteins without the extra purification steps [31]; it is easier to obtain purified antigens in a bacterium-like particles vaccine compared with the virus-like particles vaccine. The GEM-PA system has been applied in a variety of animal models and has shown strong antigen-specific systemic immune responses with parenteral vaccination and both robust local and systemic responses induced by mucosal vaccination; this system has even proven to be protective against specific pathogens, including parasites, bacteria and viruses [33,44,45,46,47,48]. Our results showed that the MERS-CoV RBD proteins were successfully displayed on the surface of the GEM particles with the GEM-PA system.",

One of the important factors determining the binding activity of fusion proteins is the number of LysMs. In the wild, the number of LysM domains in the proteins differs greatly [49]. In the current study, the optimal number of LysM domains in the GEM-PA system for proper function are different in different groups [30,36,37]. The possible reason for this was that fusion proteins fused to different target proteins. Our results showed that the binding activity of RLP3 was remarkably higher than that of RLP2 in GEM particles, which is consistent with the results of Kenji Okano and Anton Steen [36,50]. LysM domains are often separated from the other domains and from each other through linker sequences, raising speculation about LysM domain mobility and flexibility to the fused target proteins and allowing the proteins to attain an optimal orientation in binding with the cell wall [35]. Our results showed that the binding activity of RLP3 was slightly higher than that of RP3. Furthermore, there were significant differences in the neutralizing activity among the sera of mice intramuscularly immunized with RLP3-GEM and RP3-GEM. These results clearly suggested that the linker peptides between the PA and RBD proteins could increase the binding capacity of the PA and the immunogenicity of the RBD in the fusion proteins. Consistent with those results, linkers in the recombinant fusion proteins could improve the biological activity of functional domains [51]. Thus, this study represents a significant advancement in the development of the GEM-PA system.",

A more effective MERS-CoV vaccine should not only provide protection against the invasion of MERS-CoV in the blood but also provide protection against invasive infections in the respiratory tract and gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, developing an MERS-CoV alternative vaccine with mucosal immune responses is necessary. In this study, we further demonstrated that RLP3-GEM was a promising candidate for intranasal immunization with the MERS-CoV subunit vaccine. Moreover, we used GEL01 as an adjuvant for intranasal vaccination. This is because GEL01, a polymer of a sodium polyacrylate-based adjuvant, can enhance the protective effects of live vaccines through mucosal immunity [52]. Our results showed that RLP3-GEM (PLPs) induced strong neutralization against MERS-CoV pseudotyped virus infections and RBD-specific IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a antibody responses in sera, and these responses also significantly increased in the presence of the GEL01 adjuvant. IgG2a is the most effective in activating immune cells, and the ratios of IgG2a/IgG1 indicate Th1/Th2 polarization [53]. Moreover, the ratio of IgG2a/IgG1 for IgG induced by BLPs plus GEL01 was higher than that of the BLPs alone, suggesting that GEL01 showed adjuvanticity to induce a Th1-polarized immune response. SIgA antibodies may limit MERS-CoV replication at mucosal surfaces. Our data showed that intranasally immunized BLPs could induce mucosal sIgA, especially in the small intestine, confirming that the BLP vaccine could induce strong local mucosal immunity via the intranasal route. To our knowledge, this is the first report that showed successful generation of sIgA in the small intestine among the published MERS-CoV vaccine candidates.",

We observed that B cells, CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells from immunized mouse splenocytes activated more rapidly than those from mock mice once restimulated by antigen. Next, Th1 (IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-2) and Th2 (IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10) in the splenocyte supernatants were detected by ELISA and/or ELISpot. The levels from the BLP vaccine in the presence of the GEL01 adjuvant were higher than those from the BLP vaccine alone. Taken together, GEL01 as a BLP adjuvant can strongly induce systemic and local mucosal immunity. This may be because sodium polyacrylate, the mainly component of the GEL01 adjuvant, promotes the retention of antigens and sustains the release of antigens in the nasal mucosa; in addition, this adjuvant recruits immune cells to the nasal mucosa by the inflammatory response [55].",
