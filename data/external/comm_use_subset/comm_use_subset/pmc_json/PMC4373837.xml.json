The tightly controlled mechanisms that maintain fidelity can, however, be superseded by programmed events, one of which is programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) [1]. PRF involves tRNA slippage either 5\u00b4 (\u22121) or 3\u00b4 (+1) relative to the mRNA followed by continued translation in the new reading frame. PRF has mostly been studied in the context of eukaryotic viruses, and, more rarely, in bacteria, yeast and higher eukaryotes [2\u20138]. However, there is growing recognition of PRF as a regulatory mechanism used by both prokaryotes and eukaryotes ([9\u201311] and references therein). In the HIV-1 mRNA, \u22121 PRF results in translation of enzymatic domains and determines a specific ratio of enzymes to structural proteins critical for virus infectivity [12], [13].",

In HIV-1 this sequence is a heptanucleotide string termed the \u2018slippery sequence\u2019 U UUU UUA (spaces separate codons in the 0 frame). Frameshift sites often contain additional RNA structural elements 3\u00b4 of the slippery sequence that further stimulate frameshifting; in most viruses the downstream structure is a pseudoknot, although stem-loops and protein binding sites can also be used [14\u201317]. For most strains of HIV-1, however, this structure is atypical and has been shown by NMR studies to be a stem-loop of two parts with an internal purine bulge, although recently it has been proposed that a network of pseudoknots exists in equilibrium with the widely accepted stem-loop structure [18\u201321]. While slippage can occur using a minimal 25-nucleotide sequence containing only a \u2018slippery\u2019 element [22], the downstream structure further stimulates the event to give frameshift efficiencies in the order of 5\u201310% dependent on the assay system used [23]. In vivo, the RNA helicase DDX17 modulates \u22121 PRF in HIV-1 [24]. The nucleotides immediately upstream of the slippery sequence, as well as distal elements of the HIV-1 RNA that affect the ribosomal density along the HIV-1 mRNA by modulating the rate of translation initiation, can also affect the efficiency of \u22121 PRF [25\u201328]. However, the frameshift efficiency measured in vitro with the element alone placed between different bicistronic reporter systems is surprisingly similar to the in vivo rate [29].",

This implied that the intercodon was present in the ribosomal A site prior to frameshifting. Interestingly, stop codons are found at the intercodon position immediately 3\u00b4 of slippery sequences in several backward frameshift elements, such as those of Rous sarcoma virus and barley yellow dwarf virus [2], [34], as well as at the positions of forward frameshifting in +1 PRF elements [4], [7].",

We show that sense codon substitutions of the natural GGG intercodon significantly altered frameshift efficiencies. When this was substituted with a stop codon this efficiency was further modulated by over-expression of its decoding factors. Over-expression of the eukaryotic release factor, eRF1, decreased frameshift efficiency while cognate suppressor tRNA could increase frameshifting in competition with endogenous eRF1. Integrating these findings with current frameshift models, we propose a modified model of frameshifting in HIV-1 that takes into account the influence of the intercodon.",

A control element for normalisation of data contained a nullified slippery sequence (CUUCUGA) with the 3\u00b4 Luc\n+ gene in the original 0 frame such that output data reflect equimolar amounts of the two reporters synthesised. The human antizyme 1 (OAZ1) frameshift element of 120 nucleotides [7] was cloned into the dual luciferase vector but with the 3\u00b4 Luc\n+ in the +1 frame to ensure Luc+ production only by a +1 frameshift. The same nullified construct (described above) was used for data normalisation. Constructs containing termination signals for readthrough assays were produced as described [39], with the 3\u00b4 Luc\n+ gene in the original frame to ensure and measure continued translation only when termination failed. For data normalisation in this series, a construct containing the near-cognate UGG codon was used to produce equimolar amounts of both reporters. For the bicistronic fluorophore vector studies, the recoding sequences were excised and transferred into a vector between a 5\u00b4 EGFP reporter and 3\u00b4 DsRed.T4 reporter [40] in the appropriate frame [29].",

Our examination of the sequence downstream of the intercodon corresponding to the extended stem-loop showed it is not as highly conserved as the intercodon that forms the start of the stem-loop (Fig. 1C).

The bacterial RF modulated frameshifting with codon specificity, implying that if slippage occurred during elongation it was when the intercodon was being decoded in the ribosomal A site.

Substituting a different stop codon (UAG for UGA) in the same position, which maintains the native structure of the lower stem, also reduced frameshifting by the same extent. Caution is warranted in interpreting these results, as the (non-frameshifted) short-form Renilla luciferase generated by this reporter, terminated at the intercodon, is truncated by 15 amino acids compared to the other constructs. The same relative results between these constructs were observed in a different bicistronic reporter system using the fluorophores EGFP and DsRed.T4 (S1 File), however [29]. Collectively, these data suggest that the GGG intercodon of the HIV-1 frameshift element influences frameshifting in at least two ways: in a minor fashion by promoting the lower stem structure and increasing the chance for \u22121 PRF to occur, but also more markedly by exerting another major influence that is not explained by current models of \u22121 PRF.",

This model predicts that a purine would stack more easily than a pyrimidine due to its larger size and, therefore, would lower frameshift efficiency by providing greater stability for frame maintenance. By contrast, a pyrimidine in the same position would tend to be less effective [54]. Our results with GGG versus UGA (Fig. 2) were the opposite to that expected if such a stacking mechanism were dominant. We tested this further with a series of frameshift constructs with all four bases (A, G, C, T) for the first position of the intercodon, while the third base was either in the NGG or the NGA format. The order of frameshift efficiency for the NGG series was UGG>GGG>CGG>AGG whereas for the NGA series it was GGA>CGA>AGA>UGA (Fig. 3). In particular, the two purine bases, G and A, resulted in substantially different levels of frameshifting, which would not be predicted if base stacking were responsible for the major effect of the intercodon. Intriguingly, the two first base U codons, UGG (12% frameshifting) and UGA (3.5% frameshifting) were at the extremes. Notably, UGG is decoded by a tRNA while UGA is decoded by the eukaryotic protein release factor eRF1.",

First, we tested whether down-regulating eRF1, using RNAi, would affect the natural competition that occurs between eRF1 and near-cognate tRNAs at stop codons in vivo. Dual luciferase constructs where the downstream luciferase sequence was in the same frame as the upstream luciferase reporter but separated by a stop signal were used for this purpose. We established that at the weakest stop signals, where the near-cognate tRNAs more effectively compete with the release factor, up to 3% readthrough can occur even with endogenous levels of eRF1. Cellular levels of eRF1 mRNA and protein were decreased two-fold 120 h after transfection of the vector expressing shRNAs (\u03b1-eRF1), compared with the shRNA negative control (\u2212) (Fig. 4A & B). Cellular eRF1 protein was depleted using two vector-expressed shRNA sequences, si90 and si1186 (adapted from si1187) known to target eRF1 mRNA [43]. Both shRNAs reduced eRF1 mRNA and protein expression similarly (see S2 File for si1186 data). For both shRNAs, the physiological significance of reducing eRF1 was demonstrated with increased readthrough of \u223c4.5-fold at the weak termination signal, UGACUG (P < 0.001) (Fig. 4C). This reduction in eRF1 resulted in a \u223c30% increase in frameshift efficiency (P < 0.01) at the natural antizyme frameshift element where frameshifting naturally occurs with a UGA intercodon (Fig. 4D). This suggested that the cell was responding to the lowered concentration of eRF1 as expected.",

Non-physiological artefacts caused by shRNA expression could mask any specific effects of depleting eRF1 for the \u22121 PRF test system, in contrast to decoding competition at stop signals (readthrough and +1 PRF). Alternatively, a \u223c2-fold reduction in the eRF1 protein observed may be insufficient to perturb the balance of forces promoting or opposing frameshifting.

Although we did not observe this effect when eRF1 was over-expressed, given our uninterpretable results from depleting eRF1 we used suppressor tRNAs as an alternative decoding molecule of stop signals. Near-cognate tRNAs are naturally occurring potential suppressors of stop signals. They interact with termination codons by forming one or two base pairs with their anticodons but compete poorly with all but the weakest of stop signals. Artificially constructed cognate suppressor tRNAs that can form three Watson-Crick codon:anticodon interactions are highly competitive with eRF1 for decoding stop signals. If the changes in \u22121 PRF efficiency observed in Fig. 5E were mediated by a more general but unexplained property of eRF1, we would not expect to observe changes when using suppressor tRNAs. By contrast, if suppressor tRNAs modulated \u22121 PRF efficiency, then competition must be occurring between the suppressor tRNA and the endogenous eRF1 at the UGA intercodon within the ribosomal A site.",

When either of the vectors encoding UAG or UGA suppressors or control tRNAs were co-expressed with the HIV-1 element containing the GGG codon, there were no statistically significant changes in \u22121 PRF efficiency (UAG suppressor) or no effect (UGA suppressor; Fig. 6C left).

Specifically, the role of GGG, found immediately after the slippery sequence, has been evaluated for its role in frameshifting in HIV-1. This \u2018intercodon\u2019 is almost as highly conserved as the slippery sequence itself and is more conserved than the other nucleotides of the stem-loop (Fig. 1). The primary role of this intercodon in supporting \u22121 PRF efficiency does not appear to be either maintaining the structure of the lower stem-loop, or stacking of its first nucleotide on the last codon of the slippery sequence (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3). A strategy to test whether this intercodon has as its primary function an involvement in decoding before frameshifting utilised a stop codon substitution of the GGG intercodon. Both protein and tRNA decoding molecules for stop signals were then used to probe the decoding function of the intercodon. In this system, over-expression of the cognate decoding protein, eRF1, caused a reduction in\u20141 PRF (Fig. 5). This implied that the intercodon occupied the ribosomal A site and was available for decoding prior to at least a proportion of frameshift events. Suppressor tRNAs mitigated eRF1-induced reduction in \u22121 PRF efficiency, reinforcing the conclusion that the observed effects of eRF1 were specific to decoding activity in the A site of the ribosome.",

First, levels of eRF1 were reduced with expected effects on readthrough at a test stop codon and +1 antizyme frameshifting with a specific shRNA targeting eRF1, but not with the control shRNA, as expected. However, translation of the HIV-1 frameshift element was affected differently from these other test systems. The control and test shRNAs both affected frameshifting with the native element (not containing a stop codon), and yet neither affected the element where GGG was substituted with UGA. We speculate that expression of shRNAs may have triggered the innate interferon response, activating the kinase PKR to decrease translation initiation efficiency by phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 [56\u201358]. A slower translation rate increases frameshift efficiency in HIV-1 [28]. There is also evidence that the HIV-1 frameshift element is regulated by endogenous small RNAs [10]. Expressed shRNAs can compete with existing cellular small RNAs for the RNAi processing machinery [59].",

Different tRNAs, with their unique primary structures, modifications, and cellular concentrations would be predicted to have different binding capabilities to a distorted A site codon (as in Fig. 7C). Consistent with this prediction, we observed a variation in frameshift efficiency among different intercodons decoded by different tRNAs (Fig. 3). UGG (tRNATrp) was less capable, and AGG and CGG (tRNAArg) more capable of maintaining the reading frame compared with GGG (tRNAGly). A third base A (GGA, AGA and CGA intercodons) all produced significantly lower levels of frameshifting (i.e. better frame maintenance) than their third-base G counterparts, perhaps because A\u2022U wobble-base pairing is stronger than G\u2022U. Alternatively, the ribosome may undergo an incomplete translocation at this stage, resulting in elongation continuing in the \u22121 reading frame [31]. In a +1-frameshifting system, out-of-frame tRNAs are capable of influencing frameshifting, indicating substantial plasticity of the ribosome in these unusual circumstances [69].",

For our studies a stop codon as the intercodon was artificially created for the HIV-1 site. In these cases, the decoding molecule is not a tRNA but a protein release factor, which, unlike a tRNA, does not interact solely with the triplet codon but also the downstream sequence of the mRNA [70], [71]. Of interest is that the release factor has been shown to recognise disturbed stop codons in the A site of the bacterial ribosome [72]. Such an extended interaction between the release factor and mRNA:ribosome complex would be expected to compete strongly with frameshifting if the stop codon was occupying the ribosomal A site\u2014more so than tRNA with the canonical mRNA:tRNA codon:anticodon interaction (and particularly if the intercodon is distorted in the A site). Consistent with this prediction, we found that the UGA suppressor tRNA was less able to prevent frameshifting than eRF1 at the HIV-1 site (Fig. 6C). This effect would be predicted to depend upon the efficiency of decoding by the molecule during accommodation, after occupying the ribosomal decoding site, in addition to the concentration of the decoding molecule in the cell. In a distorted decoding site it is not easy to predict which decoding molecule (eRF1 or suppressor tRNA) would be the more efficient decoding molecule.",

Indeed, the E site plays a general role in frame maintenance in prokaryotic ribosomes [75]. Three 16S rRNA mutations located in helices 21 and 22 increase \u22121 PRF with the HIV-1 element [26], and these are involved in E site tRNA binding. The model presented in Fig. 7 is consistent with these observations, although our experimental data are not directly informative in this regard. For HIV-1, slippage might occur first at the E site followed by slippage at the P site [26], [76], as opposed to the simultaneous-slippage model proposed originally [3]. Additionally, in yeast Bekaert and Roussel (2005) showed bioinformatically when X XXY YYZ is in the P and A ribosomal sites the two nucleotides immediately upstream in the E site are highly biased, suggesting an extended signal. In yeast, high frameshift efficiency corresponded to a pseudouridine at tRNA position 39 that might decrease stability of the P or E site tRNA interactions [77].",

Amino acid sequencing by Edman degradation did not detect the predicted product from \u2018late\u2019 \u22121 PRF that could be translated if the intercodon were occupying the A site in the Rous sarcoma virus frameshift element [78], [79].

The dnaX and infectious bronchitis virus elements both contain a two-codon spacer between the slippery sequence and the structured RNA element, while the HIV-1 M-type element contains only a one-base spacer, or alternatively an 8-base spacer if only the more stable upper stem-loop is considered. This may lead to a pause in the case of the elements with large spacers, compared with a decrease in translation rate occurring earlier at the HIV-1 element until a more marked pause occurs when the stable upper stem-loop abuts the ribosome [63]. The ribosome has two mechanisms of helicase activity, which may differ with respect to these two downstream structures [65].",

The work presented in this study supports the hypothesis that \u22121 PRF in HIV-1 occurs relatively frequently with the slippery sequence at the E and P sites, and highlights that events during decoding of the intercodon are critical for frameshift efficiency. Namely, competition between decoding the GGG intercodon (resulting in regular translation with a maintained reading frame) and \u22121 PRF occurs in a portion of HIV-1 frameshift events. This scenario can be integrated into existing models of frameshifting and supports the notion that frameshifting in HIV-1 is a heterogeneous process.",
