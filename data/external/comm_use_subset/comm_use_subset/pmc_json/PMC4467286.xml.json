            "text": "Feminist analyses have drawn attention to the ways in which gender inequalities are obscured through the universalising narratives of the liberal humanist subject and modernist science. From the 1970s onwards, studies explored aspects of women\u2019s health and elaborated ways in which contemporary biomedicine perpetuated masculinist notions of healthy bodies, neglected the specificities of women\u2019s experience of illness and health, and pathologised pregnancy and childbirth (see, for example, Martin, 1993). Health services have been shown to institutionalise discriminatory practices perpetuating health and social inequalities. Through a focus on embodiment and lived experience, the gendered aspects of health and illness were described. Essentialist readings of the gendered body increasingly became problematised, and understandings of the body as a naturalised, biological given were seen as unsatisfactory. Instead, accounts of the multiple, socio-historical and cultural processes which produce bodies and bodily difference highlighted the contingent and uncertain, leaky boundaries of bodies (Shildrick, 1997). The regulation, disciplining and production of bodies through the biomedical sciences became more clearly recognised as a political project, part of a new kind of \u2018vital politics\u2019 or biopolitics (Rose, 2007). Biopower is seen as productive. Following Haraway and others, the entanglement of biology and politics becomes evident, including theories of the immune system (Martin, 1994), transplantation science (Shildrick, 2008), regenerative medicine (Kent, 2012) and, we argue, transfusion science. In short, contemporary theorising of gender raises a number of questions about how gender difference is enacted in blood services through material and discursive practices.",

Attracting a loyal population of repeat donors who give blood on a regular basis is important to address this problem and enhance blood safety (Bonig et al., 2012). There is a significant literature which has examined the motivations and behaviours of donor populations with a view to understanding how best to retain them (Masser et al., 2008). Drawing attention to the numbers of women ineligible to become donors, and evidence that women are less likely to become donors, Healy (2000) sees organisational and cultural factors, rather than individual motivations, as shaping donor populations. The typical blood donor in western blood economies is most commonly male, white and educated, aged in their 30s, with above average occupational level and income (Piliavin and Callero, 1991), and more likely to be involved in civic engagement activities (Alessandrini, 2007).",

However, risk is an unstable concept and has been defined in varying ways. Risk assessment has been viewed as the domain of scientific experts and risk management as a matter for political leadership but the role of science and politics in risk governance has been much debated: \u2018In simple terms, there are those who view risk as an objective and knowable phenomenon which can be measured, whereas for others it is socially constructed and influenced by cultural, institutional and political contexts\u2019 (Farrell, 2012: 9). We take the view that risk is indeed a socio-cultural construct shaped by political and wider institutional processes.

We suggest that similar processes are operating within transfusion science and that valuations of bodily materials are variable and gendered.

On the one hand, it is characterised by enduring socio-cultural and political concerns about preferred methods of collection in line with national preferences, which most often crystallises as support for the gift relationship in western bioeconomies. On the other hand, such concerns must be managed in the context of interconnectedness both within and across national boundaries, in relation to collection and supply (Waldby and Mitchell, 2006). This shifts over time and space in the face of emerging risks to blood safety, as well as in relation to changing market demands for blood components and plasma products. Further layers of complexity are added to the mix because collection and manufacturing practices differ between blood components or plasma products, and both for-profit and not-for-profit organisations are involved in such practices:",

When you talk about a labile blood product that\u2019s going to be mainly used for transfusion purposes and when you talk about a plasma product which is basically a product which is a finished pharmaceutical, it\u2019s a product that has undergone a manufacturing cycle, it\u2019s a stable product. So it\u2019ll have much longer shelf-life and they are products that circulate on the international level, whereas labile blood products tend to be products that have much shorter shelf-life that are used on a national scale. So that\u2019s one of the key differences. Another difference, I would say lies with collection practices, for both blood and plasma products. Blood products, obviously they come from blood donations made by blood donors. Plasma products, most of the plasma products used on a global scale come from plasmapharesis donors. So these are people who actually donate the plasma but not the whole blood. They go to specialised plasmapharesis centres [\u2026 this] accounts for approximately 70 percent of the plasma that is used for therapeutic purposes on a global scale. And then the 30 percent of the remaining plasma comes from plasma that has been recovered from blood donation. (Int. 16, Executive of an international patient organisation)",

In Brazil, only a third of donors are women and donation is understood as a form of \u2018bloodletting\u2019 for those who use hormone contraceptives to suppress menstruation (Sanabria, 2009). In Pakistan, women\u2019s blood is regarded as \u2018impure\u2019 and they are not expected to donate blood except when no men are available (Mumtaz et al., 2012). Experiences of blood donation are gendered too. Blood may be seen both as self and as alienable and rendered \u2018non-self\u2019 following manipulation and transfusion. The notion that blood becomes anonymised and \u2018just a product\u2019:",

Indeed, the predominantly US-based industry has traditionally relied on the socio-economically disadvantaged or marginalised to provide plasma on a regular basis in return for cash. While historically women\u2019s plasma has been valued where they carry high titres of RhD antibodies which can be used in the manufacture of Anti-D Ig, the industry has shown a long standing preference for male plasma, targeting prisoners, inmates in mental institutions and gay men for antibodies needed to manufacture particular products, such as gamma globulin and the hepatitis B vaccine (Starr, 1998). Donor compliance and reducing \u2018risky behaviour\u2019 is at the heart of plasma procurement practices today. There are industry standards which apply to the procurement, processing and manufacturing of plasma which are intended to reduce the risk of transmissible infections and viral disease, and improve the quality and safety of the product (Farrell, 2012). Voluntary standards have been developed through the International Quality Plasma Programme and, in Europe, the sourcing of plasma must comply with the European Blood Directive.3 There has also been more stringent oversight at national and supranational level to ensure compliance with manufacturing standards within the scope of international pharmaceutical (medicinal products) regulation (Farrell, 2012).",

The continuing debate about the risks attributed to MSM, and their exclusion as blood (and tissue) donors since the HIV crisis, has drawn attention to the contingent and discriminatory practices associated with the risk calculus involving blood safety (Galarneau, 2010; Hoeyer, 2010). Within transfusion science, blood relations and exchanges are seen by Strong as creating \u2018vital publics\u2019 which are \u2018embodied associations elicited through the generalized exchange of body \u2013 in this case blood. Participation in the vital public might therefore be seen as a unique duty associated with the biological citizen\u2019 (Strong, 2009: 173). He argues that exclusions of MSM as donors relied on technologies which first sought to measure risk, then model it mathematically. Yet the assessment of the risk of transfusing transmitted viral infection is problematic, and socially relative, serving the political ends of sustaining the blood supply and protecting public health. As a consequence, we suggest that policies which mobilise particular understandings of the potential risks of using plasma from women must also be viewed in this light. Although women are recruited as whole blood donors, their donations have different exchange value to those of men.",

In the US, account is taken of both the diverse causes of TRALI (Chapman, 2011) and scientific uncertainties surrounding the syndrome. US proposals highlight the need for a \u2018partial, incremental approach in making policy decisions\u2019 and suggested \u2018a plasma diversion strategy\u2019, which diverted female plasma for fractionation and used male plasma for transfusion, but which sought to avoid alienating and confusing female donors (Eder et al., 2007). In Canada, a combination of preference for male plasma transfusion and high-volume plasma components, and screening of women who have a history of pregnancy, has been thought to improve transfusion outcomes (Lin et al., 2012).",

The production of HLA antibodies by the woman, known as sensitisation, may have particularly serious consequences for subsequent pregnancies, and therefore the administration of a plasma product, Anti-D Ig, is designed to prevent sensitisation and antibody production. Anti-D Ig can be administered prophylactically antenatally or postnatally or following any sensitising event which may have caused fetal maternal haemorrhage (this might include miscarriage, abortion, or intrauterine testing and trauma). Although Anti-D Ig has been used as a prophylactic treatment for over 40 years in many western countries (Kumpel, 2001, 2002; Kumpel and Elson, 2001), the mechanism of this passive immunisation is poorly understood and the efficacy of different treatments has not been well studied (Pilgrim et al., 2009). Nevertheless, it is considered to have been highly successful in reducing the incidence of HDFN. Paternal blood group testing may assist in identifying those women at risk of becoming sensitised. A new technology for antenatal testing involving cell free fetal DNA (cffDNA), which circulates in the maternal blood (genotyping), has the potential to identify the blood group of the fetus and therefore determine whether there is a need for prophylactic administration (Brojer et al., 2005; NICE, 2008). To date, this test has not become widely available for \u2018at risk\u2019 women. However, there are risks for women associated with the use of Anti-D Ig and its incorrect administration, and many women receive this product unnecessarily (Bolton-Maggs et al., 2013; Finning et al., 2008; Kent et al., 2014).",

Since administration of Anti-D Ig became routine, the numbers of sensitised women whose blood may be used as source material for the product has been reduced, Anti-D Ig is currently commercially produced from predominantly male bodies. Male plasma donors, who are well known to the source company and have well characterised plasma, constitute a pool from which potential Anti-D donors are selected.7 They are paid a premium to receive repeated doses of RhD positive red blood cells to stimulate an immune response to produce antibodies which can then be harvested at the next plasma donation. Anti-D Ig is then manufactured from pooled plasma from these men for use in women. (It may also be used infrequently in cases where RhD negative men are wrongly transfused with RhD positive blood.)",

Women who produce these antibodies naturally (as a result of pregnancy) are excluded and women of reproductive age are regarded at high risk of sensitisation which could adversely impact on future pregnancies. The technology to produce monoclonal (synthetic) Anti-D Ig has been developed, but is not currently commercially viable (Kumpel, 2001, 2002; Interview 27).",

The biomedical body was conventionally seen to represent the nation-state and invading organisms as foreigners. More recently, scientific and cultural understandings see the immune system as a complex networked system (Martin, 1994). Within this framework, maternal bodies, in particular, are often represented as paradoxical and explanations about why the genetically distinct fetus is not rejected by the mother have provoked considerable debate and stimulated a long history of investigation. In pregnancy the fetal and maternal circulations have increasingly been understood as closely interconnected. Maternal fetal microchimerism refers to the mixing of cells from the maternal and fetal body (Kelly, 2012; Martin, 2010) and placental \u2018border crossings\u2019 which may provoke an immunological response. Kelly\u2019s (2012) account of the emergence of gestational cell transfer science and understandings of maternal\u2013fetal microchimerism reveals the extent of scientific uncertainty about the significance and meaning of these exchanges. While previously thought to be pathological, fetal cells entering the maternal circulation have more recently been considered normal.",

            "text": "Biology has intrinsically been a branch of political discourse which constructs and constitutes political subjects (Kelly, 2012: 5). Immunology theory supported and reinforced a set of political values about normal and pathological states, subjectivity and identity. The fetus was thought of as a hostile \u2018invader\u2019 or \u2018intruder\u2019 and the placenta as a barrier between two separate selves (Martin, 1994). The dominant view was that the immune system \u2018defends the self\u2019 and the pure body is the normal body (Kelly, 2012). With recognition that cells routinely cross the placental interface, a relational model of the immune system begins to emerge, as a complex, dynamic network (Haraway, 1995). Instead of a barrier, the placenta may be viewed as a permeable interface where exchanges between mother and fetus occur in both directions \u2013 \u2018bidirectional cell trafficking\u2019 (Martin, 2010). The discovery of the intermingling of maternal and fetal circulations and blood type incompatibility as a cause of HDFN in the 1960s was important in developing Anti-D Ig therapy. The implications of a revised model of the immune system \u2013 as relational and networked \u2013 are much wider. First, the notion that all bodies are chimeric undermines notions of the modern political subject as a distinct individual (Kelly, 2012); second, it implies a different way of thinking about antibodies, and their significance for transfusion practices starts to seem far more complex than a blanket exclusion of women as plasma donors in the UK suggests. Yet, in the context of transfusion science, it is presumed that the immune status of (all) women is compromised because of their potential exposure to a fetal body, thereby affecting their suitability to become plasma donors. In contrast, the commercial production of Anti-D Ig by injecting male RhD negative plasma donors\u2019 with RhD positive cells to produce antibodies, is an accepted and valued practice.",

This in turn raises questions about the ethics of donation \u2013 the information given to women about becoming blood donors. While retaining women donors in the donor pool may be an important policy objective, the different ways in which their donations are processed is information which should be made available. The myths of universality, citizenship and solidarity should be publicly elaborated upon to explain and justify the ways in which women are treated as different kinds of donors from men.
