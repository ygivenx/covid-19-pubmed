Many antiviral drug studies have been based on a functional analysis of viral genes and an understanding of the virus life cycle. McFarland and Hill (1987) showed successful vaccination of mice and pigs with a mutant PRV thymidine kinase [4]. Qing Ge also demonstrated that nucleocapsid siRNA or a component of the RNA transcriptase (PA) is a good antiviral drug to protect against influenza virus by inhibiting viral RNA transcription with siRNAs [5]. In addition, acyclovir, which is the best antiviral agent against HSV-1, is a nucleotide analogue that shows an antiviral effect by inhibiting DNA replication [6]. However, commercially-developed antiviral drugs such as viral DNA polymerases, viral reverse transcriptases, and neuraminidase inhibitors target one or two viruses [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]. Thus, a new strategy is needed to prepare for outbreaks caused by new viruses or new mutant viruses because of the high mutation rates of viral genomes and recombination events among closely-related viruses [12], [13].",

In 1994, scFv which binds to the Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) regulatory protein Rev was expressed intracellularly and potently inhibited HIV-1 replication in scFv immunized cells [15]. In addition, scFv against HIV integrase and reverse transcriptase showed reduced viral progeny in virus infected cells [16], [17]. The retroviral capsid protein can be used as an antiviral target and thereby extend the number of targets that can potentially be used in combined scFv-based gene therapy approaches [18]. However, despite the many virus resistant studies using scFv proteins, no reports are available about scFv having an antiviral effect against a broad spectrum of viruses.",

In another study, DNase I digested DNA in the form of unmethylated proviral M-MuLV selectively [19]. Exonuclease, ISG20, which is induced by type 1 interferon (IFN), was over-expressed in CEL cells to inhibit HIV replication through nuclease activity [20], [21]. Another case was reported in a plant system using Pac1, an RNase isolated from the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Challenging a transgenic potato that expresses Pac1 with potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd) resulted in suppression of PSTVd infection and accumulation without significant undesired effects on the plant. The anti-viral effects of these RNases depend on their RNA-hydrolyzing activity [22].",

In addition, efficient degradation of RNAs by 3D8 scFv in the presence of EDTA demonstrates that 3D8 scFv does not need divalent metal ions for its RNase activity [23]. Additionally, 3D8 scFv has DNase and RNase activity but when the active sites of each VL and VH are changed from histidine (35 position in VH and 94 position in VL) to alanine, respectively, by site-directed mutagenesis, the mutant 3D8 scFv loses DNase activity but retains RNase activity [24]. We previously showed that 3D8 scFv can be applied to protect PK15 cells from virus infection. PK15 cells harboring 3D8 scFv show resistance to classical swine fever virus (CSFV) through RNase activity [25]. Also, we previously found that progenies of the transgenic tobacco plant acquired complete resistances against two single stranded (ss)-DNA geminiviruses, four ssRNA tobamoviruses, and one ssRNA cucumovirus [26], [27]. So far, chemicals or specific antibodies for viral proteins have been mostly used in antiviral agents. But, 3D8 scFv with a completely different mechanism than antiviral agents is expected to be effective against a broad spectrum of viral infections.",

Three 3D8 scFv lines (SCH07041, SCH07071, and SCH07072) and mutated 3D8 scFv (muSCH) were selected by serial dilution in media containing G418 [28]. We evaluated 3D8 scFv expression levels in selected cell lines by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), flow cytometric analysis, and immunocytochemistry. According to quantitative real-time RT-PCR, SCH07072 expressed the highest 3D8 scFv RNA compared to that of the other two cell lines (1.3 and 4 times more). The mutant 3D8 scFv-transfected (muSCH) cells expressed similar levels of 3D8 scFv RNA to SCH07072 (\nFigure 1B\n). Flow cytometry data revealed that when the mean for the HeLa cell line as a control was 79.48, SCH07041, SCH07071, and SCH07072 were 88.45, 109.17, and 126.38, respectively (Geo mean: HeLa = 74.51, SCH07041 = 76.88, SCH07071 = 89.89, and SCH07072 = 115.33) and was similar to the results shown in the quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis (\nFigure 1C\n). Confocal microscopy demonstrated that 3D8 scFv proteins in SCH07072 and muSCH were targeted and localized in both the cytosol and nucleus (\nFigure 1D\n). Common features of anti-DNA antibodies that have a large number of positively-charged residues within complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of VH or VL domains due to their antigen binding properties, which resemble the nuclear localization signal (NLS), have been attributed to their final accumulation within the nucleus of cells, such as cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) [29]. Therefore, 3D8 scFv proteins were localized in the cytosol using a vector system and targeted to the nucleus by a NLS.",

Forty-eight hours after the PRV challenge, fewer cytopathic effects, as assessed by multinuclear giant cell formation, were observed in SCH07072 cells compared to the other types of cells, including wild-type cells (\nFigure 3A\n). The plaque assay also showed the highest antiviral effects in SCH07072 cells with viral titers of 916/ml and 7,466/ml at MOIs of 0.1 and 0.5, respectively, compared to those of wild-type HeLa cells (9,130/ml and 31,833/ml, respectively) and the muSCH cell line (9.046/ml and 30,400/ml, respectively (\nFigure 3B\n). The expression levels of 3D8 scFv in SCH07071 and SCH07072 cells were similar (\nFigure 1B\n) but the antiviral activity of SCH07072 and SCH07071 were quite different. Generally there is a correlation between 3D8 scFv expression and antiviral activity. However, in order for cells to acquire the antiviral activity of 3D8 scFv, a certain amount of 3D8 scFv protein needs to be expressed. We thought that there might be a threshold for the acquired antiviral activity conferred by 3D8 scFv expression. SCH07072 may have reached the threshold but SCH07071 did not (\nFigure 3B\n). Glycoprotein D (gpD) was used for Western analysis to count the PRV. The gpD protein was not found in the SCH07072 lines but wild-type HeLa cells showed strong signals (\nFigure 3C\n). Even though the expression level of 3D8 scFv in SCH07041 cells was significantly lower (approx. 1/3) than that of SCH07072 cells, both cells were found to be equally resistant against HSV-1 infection at an MOI of 0.1 (\nFigure 2B\n), suggesting that the 3D8 scFv protein level in SCH07041 cells was close to the maximum effective dose against HSV-1. At a higher virus titer (MOI 0.5), the antiviral effect of 3D8 scFv was shown in a more dose-dependent manner such that much less viral infectivity was found in the SCH07072 cells than the SCH07041 (1,964.00 vs 530.67 pfu/ml). This was further demonstrated in case of PRV infection study (\nFigure 3B\n), in which the SCH07072 cells were shown to be more resistant against the virus infection than the SCH07041 cells at both MOI of 0.1 and 0.5. As a result, 3D8 scFv expression levels and antiviral effects showed a directly proportional relationship.",

The amounts of viral DNA and RNA isolated from cells grown with or without HSV DNA polymerase inhibitor (Phosphonoacetic acid, PAA) in the culture media were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (\nFigure 5\n). PAA inhibited the synthesis of HSV DNA in infected cells and the activity of the virus-specific DNA polymerase in vitro\n[33]. PAA was used to investigate the antiviral effects by 3D8 scFv DNase activity in the immediate early stage before de novo viral DNA replication. The changes in viral DNA content in HeLa, SCH07072, and muSCH cells were traced at immediate early (2 hr after virus challenge, ICP4), early (6.5 hr after virus challenge, UL9), and late (25 hr after virus challenge, UL19) stages of infection (\nFigure 5A\n). Viral DNA accumulation in SCH07072 cells was reduced by up to 94.2% under the PAA-untreated condition, compared to HeLa cells at each stage. Virus DNA accumulation in SCH07072 cells cultured with PAA decreased by up to 80% compared to that in HeLa cells at all stages of infection. In contrast, muSCH cells under the PAA-untreated condition showed as much virus DNA accumulation as HeLa cells at the early stage of infection, but 68% more viral DNA was detected in muSCH cells compared to HeLa cells at the late stage. The accumulation of virus DNA in SCH07072 indicates that nuclear 3D8 scFv can degrade viral DNA directly, resulting in less accumulation of viral DNA (\nFigure 5B\n).",

Wagner's web site (http://darwin.bio.uci.edu/~faculty/wagner/hsv4f.html). Therefore, in the absence of PAA the decreased level of viral DNA in muSCH cells in comparison with that of HeLa cells is likely to be attributed to an interference of HSV -1 transcription by the RNase activity of the mutant 3D8 scFv (\nFigure 5B\n). With treatment of PAA, a specific inhibitor of viral DNA polymerase, the level of viral DNA replication in muSCH and HeLa cells were shown to be almost identical at immediate early stage. This relatively mild impact of PAA on DNA replication in muSCH cells as compared with HeLa and SCH07072 cells was also observed when selected viral RNA transcripts were measured in these cells at immediate early stage (\nFigure 5C\n). Transcriptions of these genes were found to be significantly decreased in HeLa and SCH07072 cells upon PAA, which reflects the decreased level of viral DNA templates for transcription. By contrast, transcription level of these genes in muSCH cells at the same stage did not show any significant difference between PAA treated and untreated cells.",

Therefore, it is intriguing and difficult to explain on why and how only the viral genome is subjected to the nucleic acid hydrolyzing activity of 3D8 scFv, leaving host genome largely unaffected. Perhaps as the HSV-1 genome, which was not completely assembled with nucleosomes or was assembled with unstable nucleosomes, can be digested by intrinsic DNase of 3D8 scFv during HSV-1 replication takes place (6 hours post infection or early stage), especially considering that the viral genome is found to be relatively free of histones following viral DNA replication, beyond 6 hours post infection [35]. When we compared the HSV-1 DNA accumulation between SCH07072 and muSCH cells on immediate early stage, early stage and late stage respectively, muSCH cells showed limited antiviral activities at immediate early stage but did not show any antiviral activity later on. Thus it may indicates that mutant 3D8 scFv with only intrinsic RNase activity is not sufficient for providing a full protection for host cells against HSV-1 infection once HSV-1 DNA replication successfully takes places in nucleus in muSCH cells. Therefore, it may be possible that the antiviral effects of 3D8 scFv against HSV-1 and PRV infection were contributed by both the DNase activity, which is mainly effective in the nucleus and the RNase activity mainly effective in the cytoplasm. This proposed antiviral activity can be explained by (1) temporal blockage of viral DNA replication in the nucleus and protein translation in the cytosol and (2) spatial protection (nucleus vs. cytosol) provided by 3D8 scFv. However, further experimental investigations are needed to confirm the antiviral mechanisms of 3D8 scFv proposed in this study.",

Both 3D8 scFv and DNase I at 10\u00d710\u22124 U/\u00b5l started to hydrolyze 0.2 \u00b5g DNA 1 hr after treatment. At a concentration of 8.3\u00d710\u22124 U/\u00b5l, 3D8 scFv digested more non-methylated DNA than methylated DNA after 1 hr of treatment (\nFigure 6A\n). In addition, quantitation of non-methylated and methylated DNA showed a reduction rate of 62% and 21%, respectively (\nFigure 6C\n). However, no difference in hydrolysis of non-methylated and methylated DNA was observed when 8.3\u00d710\u22124 U/\u00b5l DNase I was tested (\nFigure 6A\n).

In the case of the 90 and 135 F1 lines, three F190 lines (F190: 45, 46, and 162) and five F1135 lines (F1135: 140, 142, 144, 165, and 166) were produced and then 17 F290 lines (STG90) and 24 F2135 lines (STG135) were prepared (Figure S4A).

Therefore, PRV could not move systemically into the spinal cord or brain in STG90 mice. However, STG135 mice were not protected against PRV infection even though 3D8 scFv protein was expressed in the brain (\nFigure 7A\n) at similar levels to those observed in STG90 mice. We interpret these data to indicate that the expression and presence of antiviral proteins in inoculated cells and tissues is as important as high expression levels in target cells or tissues.

In our previous study, when we tested the potential cytotoxic effect of 3D8 scFv on HeLa cells with varying concentration of 3D8 scFv (5\u201340 \u00b5M) for 48 hrs, the cell viability was found to drop by \u223c50\u201360% upon 10 \u00b5M of 3D8 scFv treatment, while treatment of the cells with 1 \u00b5M and 5 \u00b5M 3D8 scFv exhibited no significant cytotoxicity up to 48 h of incubation (0 and \u223c20% respectively) [40]. This may indicate that the host cells indeed begin to be affected by the non-specific activity of 3D8 scFv at higher dosages (i.e., 5 \u00b5M and up). Although it is not clear on exactly how much 3D8 scFv protein actually penetrated into the cells from media when 5 \u00b5M 3D8 scFv protein was administered, 5 \u00b5M 3D8 scFv is fairly large amount of proteins for in vitro cytotoxicity analysis even though we used the same amount of the proteins for in vivo survival experiments with mice (\nFigure 7\n). On the other hand, the actual level of 3D8 scFv expressed in transgenic cells such as in SCH07072 cell line was too low to be even detected by Western blot analysis, although its expression was confirmed by confocal microscopic observation and flow cytometry analysis (\nFigure 1\n). Therefore, it can be concluded that the low concentration of 3D8 scFv expressed in transgenic cell lines or TG mice is generally sufficient for conferring antiviral effects without incurring damage to the host DNA, but the likelihood of 3D8 scFv having deleterious impact on host cells as well through non-specific nucleic acid hydrolyzing activity remains valid, especially at higher concentration of the protein.",

This antibody inhibits (1) viral DNA replication and RNA transcription in the nucleus by viral DNA degradation and (2) viral protein translation in the cytoplasm via viral RNA degradation. In other words, the 3D8 scFv protein attacks the virus DNA genome itself or its RNA transcripts in two different subcellular spaces (nucleus and cytoplasm) and at two different times (viral replication and viral transcription) (\nFigure 9\n). These antiviral effects of 3D8 scFv have not only been observed against viruses with a dsDNA genome but also ssRNA viruses such as CSFV [25] and several plant viruses such as geminivirus, tobamovirus, and cucumovirus [26], [27]. Taken together, 3D8 scFv is a candidate antiviral protein that can potentially confer resistance to a broad spectrum of animal and plant viruses.",

C. 3D8 scFv has a unique dual and stereoscopic protection mechanism that includes DNase activity in the nucleus and RNase activity in the cytoplasm. 3D8 scFv acts by inhibiting (1) viral DNA replication and RNA transcription in the nucleus via viral DNA degradation and (2) translation in the cytoplasm via viral RNA degradation.
