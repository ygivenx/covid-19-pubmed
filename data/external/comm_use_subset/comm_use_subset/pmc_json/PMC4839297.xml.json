In nature, birds are the sylvatic reservoir for WNV in an endemic cycle with the primary vector, the mosquito. The virus is wide spread in Africa, the Middle east and Russia [1], and since the 1999 outbreak in New York [2,3], WNV has spread from east to west in most states in North America [4]. Transmission of the virus to humans via mosquitoes can cause significant health problems such as West Nile fever and a neuroinvasive disease [5,6,7]. Unfortunately, no antivirals or vaccines are currently available, and therefore efficient and safe antivirals are urgently needed. ",

The viral NS3 protease mediates post-translational modification of the polyprotein [9,10] in the cytoplasm and by host proteases in the endoplasmic reticulum. WNV replicates in various types of cells in tissue culture, including Vero E6 [11], BHK, and insect cell lines. During replication, host cells may show a cytopathic effect (CPE) from apoptosis [12]. WNV infection can induce apoptosis in several different cell lines, including, insect cells and mammalian cells, possibly through the bax gene [13]. ",

WNV replicons have been created which harbor luciferase or GFP alone [14] or replicons with luciferase and Neor reporters [15]. The replicons were adapted to a 96-well format, and the assay was validated with known inhibitors of WNV [16,17]. The first HT screen of WNV consisted of diverse set of 200 compounds in which triaryl pyrazoline was identified as an inhibitor of viral RNA synthesis [17]. In another study, a small library of 108 compound pyrolizines were identified which may inhibit RNA synthesis [18]. In 2006, Gu et al., published a screen of a library of over 35,000 small molecule compounds with the WNV replicon with the luciferase and Neor reporters [16,19]. They also developed a counterscreen in a 96-well format with live virus which was employed to screen 23 compounds. From these screens, several candidate compounds were identified with one class, a pyrazolopyrimidine, showing promising activity and selectivity as well as promise for follow-up chemistry.",

The assay employed cell viability as the end point, using Promega\u2019s CellTiter-Glo\u00ae, which produces a luminescent signal in relation to the quantity of ATP in host cells (directly related to cell viability). In contrast to dye formation or dye-uptake methods, which have a low dynamic range, the CellTiter-Glo\u00ae assay shows a higher dynamic range with less background. We implemented the WNV assay in the 384-well format in a screen of 13,001 compounds.

We did not find a significant difference among the three MEM-E based media with regard to luminescence (data not shown). However, cytopathic effect (CPE) was more evident in cells grown and infected with WNV in MEM-E than in DMEM. The signal from the virus control with DMEM showed a higher luminescence signal than that with MEM-E while the luminescence from cell controls was identical (Figure 1A). The MEM-E media also shortened the assay incubation period by two days compared to DMEM media and hence was chosen for the HTS. ",

Average S/B was 17 and S/N for each plate ranged from 10.8 to 23.9 with a mean of 16.94 and standard deviation of 2.95 (Figure 2A and Figure 2B). These statistical values indicate that the assay provided high quality and the required robustness and reproducibility of an HTS assay. In this assay the overall average inhibitions were 0.7% with a standard deviation of 4.184% and the control drug MPA showed 44.6% inhibition on average. The percent inhibition cutoff was 13.25% that represents the viral mean + three standard deviations, a common method of statistically defining hits in a single dose screen. Using this cutoff method, 13.25%, 92 compounds were identified as active WNV inhibitors (Figure 2C). ",

The endpoint we developed and employed in the HT screen was CPE caused by viral replication, which has advantages over other target based HTS. A CPE based antiviral screen is expected to elucidate a wider range of antiviral compounds than other target based assays. A CPE based assay is likely to discover cytotoxic compounds since the cytotoxic compounds will decrease the endpoint signal and are read as inactive. This has an advantage over reporter-based assays in that they can read false positives. In fact, we found only 14 compounds with CC50 less than 30 \u03bcM among 110 compounds subjected to the dose response assay. The pathway for probe discovery is depicted in Figure 7. The top 110 compounds, based on their inhibitory activities were examined by a dose response and cytotoxicity assay. Twenty-four compounds showing a dose response inhibition were further evaluated in a time of addition assay and in a titer reduction assay. Finally, seven compounds are presented as anti-WNV probes.

Further optimization of these compounds is needed to develop effective antiviral treatment for WNV infection. In addition, the compounds we have identified should serve as novel molecular probes to help us understand the biology of WNV. Future studies will focus on how these compounds target virus replication and the mechanism of action. In conclusion, identification of previously known and novel moieties from a screening library is proof that the WNV assay is an effective HT screen. ",
