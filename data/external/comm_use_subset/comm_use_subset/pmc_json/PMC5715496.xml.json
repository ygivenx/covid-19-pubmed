            "text": "Neural injury associated with virus infection represents a multifaceted convergence of host\u2013pathogen interactions that range from direct lytic killing of infected neurons to bystander pathology mediated by brain-infiltrating immune cells responding to chemotactic and inflammatory cues. Viral encephalitis is a trade-off between the need to clear pathogen from the brain and the need to preserve irreplaceable neurons and neural circuits: too little inflammation and the host dies of uncontrolled infection, too much inflammation and the host suffers permanent brain damage [1]. And while much attention is rightly given to viral encephalitides associated with human mortality, there is likely a significant component of neural injury associated with low-level, sub-clinical viral infections of the central nervous system that are ultimately cleared by the host. Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) is a model of such an infection [2]. When C57Bl/6 mice are inoculated via intracranial delivery of the Daniel\u2019s strain of TMEV, there is an acute viral encephalitis that culminates in the generation of an antiviral T cell-mediated response, development of virus neutralizing antibodies, clearance of the virus, and resolution of brain inflammation over the course of about 45 days [3]. However, despite essentially complete resolution of the infection, permanent neurological sequelae such as impaired spatial learning [2, 4], anxiety [5], and epilepsy [6] occur in most postinfectious animals. Uniquely, these neurologic problems largely stem from bystander loss of CA1 pyramidal neurons and subsequent disruption of hippocampal and hippocampal-cortical circuits [4, 7, 8].",

We showed that animals which mount a large inflammatory monocyte response exhibit extensive loss of CA1 neurons in the dorsal hippocampus and lose the ability to learn spatial navigation and novel object recognition tasks. In contrast, mice that mount a weak inflammatory monocyte response exhibit preservation of CA1 neurons and maintain cognitive performance, despite robust virus infection [8]. In parallel, others have shown that monocyte-derived inflammatory factors such as interleukin-6 [9, 10] and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 [11] drive ictogenesis in the TMEV model. These observations suggest that modulation of inflammatory monocyte responses during acute virus infection in the brain may confer neuroprotection. However, the specific mechanisms responsible for the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes to the brain in the TMEV model have not been previously characterized and open questions remain regarding the mechanisms of leukocyte infiltration into the brain in general.",

            "text": "The multistep process of leukocyte entry into the central nervous system is predominantly controlled by chemokines [12]. In particular, inflammatory monocyte trafficking is thought to depend upon C-C motif chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) signaling in response to C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) [13], though the specific details of this dependency vary with viral pathogen. For example, CCR2-deficient mice exhibited reduced monocyte recruitment to the brain but increased mortality during West Nile virus encephalitis [14] and this effect was differentially regulated by CCL2 and CCL7, another CCR2 ligand [15]. In a model of Japanese encephalitis virus infection, mice deficient in CCR2 had reduced monocyte infiltration and reduced mortality, whereas CCL2-deficient animals exhibited increased monocyte infiltration and increased mortality [16]. Both CCL2- and CCR2-deficient mice with mouse hepatitis virus encephalitis had reduced monocyte infiltration, but only CCR2-deficient mice exhibited increased mortality [17, 18]. Likewise, mice with CCR2-deficient hematopoietic cells mounted a reduced monocyte response to herpes simplex virus 1 infection and exhibited increased mortality [19]. These studies clearly support a role for the CCR2:CCL2 axis in trafficking of inflammatory monocytes to the brain during viral encephalitis. However, the specific cellular source of the CCL2 is not identified in any of this work. In the current study, we demonstrate that inflammatory monocyte infiltration into the brain during acute TMEV infection requires CCR2 and that neurons are a key source of CCL2 driving this trafficking during the earliest stages of infection.",

Mice were acclimatized for at least 1 week following shipment and prior to use or were bred in-house. Female mice between 4 and 6 weeks of age were used for all experiments. LysM:eGFP mice were maintained in-house, as described [4]. The CCR2-deficient mice were maintained as homozygotes; wildtype B6 mice were used as CCR2-sufficient controls for all experiments involving the CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice. A Ccl2-RFPflx/fl x Syn-Cre conditional knockout model was generated by interbreeding Ccl2-RFPfl/fl and Syn-Cre mice. Tail DNA was screened by PCR using primers to detect the mutant CCL2 allele (forward: 5\u2032-AGGACGGCGAGT TCATCTAC-3\u2032; reverse: 5\u2032-TGGTGTAGTCCTCGTTGTGG-3\u2032; 288 bp product) and the wildtype CCL2 allele (forward: 5\u2032- AACCACCTCAAGCACTTCTG-3\u2032; reverse: 5\u2019GCTTTGCAGTTTCCCTCAAG-3\u2032; 363 bp product). PCR cycling conditions were 94 \u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 10 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 20 s, 65 \u00b0C for 15 s (with \u2212 0.5 \u00b0C decrease per cycle), and 68 \u00b0C for 10 s, followed by an additional 28 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 15 s, 60 \u00b0C for 15 s, and 72 \u00b0C for 10 s, ending with 72 \u00b0C for 2 min, and 10 \u00b0C hold. Ccl2-RFPfl/fl x Syn-Cre F2+ crosses were screened until all pups were homozygous for the mutant CCL2 allele. The Cre transgene was screened in all pups using generic Cre primers (forward: 5\u2032-ACCAGCCAGCTATCAACTCG-3\u2032; reverse: 5\u2032-TTACATTGTCCAGCCACC-3\u2032; 200 bp product). PCR cycling conditions were 94 \u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 1 min, 60 \u00b0C for 1.5 min, and 72 \u00b0C for 2.5 min, ending with 72 \u00b0C for 5 min, and 4 \u00b0C hold. This PCR cannot distinguish heterozygotes from homozygotes; therefore, the line was maintained for Cre hemizygosity and Ccl2-RFP homozygosity and all litters were screened using a Transnetyx (Cordova, TN) panel that detects wildtype CCL2, RFP, and Cre. For experiments, mice were considered deficient in neuronal production of CCL2 (\u201cCCL2\u2212\u201d) if they were positive for the Cre transgene, negative for the wildtype CCL2 allele, and positive for RFP. Mice were considered normal for neuronal production of CCL2 (\u201cCCL2+\u201d) if they were negative for the Cre transgene and positive either for the wildtype CCL2 allele or for RFP. In early experiments, the CCL2+ animals were selected as littermate controls for the CCL2\u2212 mice; in later experiments, the line was established such that all pups expressed the Cre transgene (presumptive homozygotes). All mice were group housed under controlled temperature and humidity with a 12-h light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water. All animal experiments were performed according to the National Institutes of Health guidelines and were approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Animal Welfare Assurance number A3291-01).",

            "text": "Adult female C57Bl/6 mice were intracranially inoculated with 2 \u00d7 105 PFU of TMEV. RNA from hippocampus was prepared at 3, 6, 12, and 24 h postinfection (hpi) and analyzed by microarray to measure changes in transcripts. Hippocampal RNA was also prepared from uninfected mice and from mice 24 h after sham inoculation with viral growth media. Fold changes in expression for the 16,900 genes present on the array were calculated relative to uninoculated/uninfected controls. A heatmap of log2 fold change (Fig. 1a) reveals that numerous genes were already upregulated at 3 hpi and the number of upregulated genes steadily grew through the first 24 h after infection. Extraction of chemokine, cytokine, and adhesion factor genes (Fig. 1b) indicates that these pathways were robustly impacted by TMEV infection. For example, the CCR2 ligand CCL2 was upregulated eightfold by 3 hpi and continued to increase to almost 50-fold induction by 12 hpi, remaining above 30-fold at 24 hpi. The CCR5 ligand CCL5 increased steadily from fivefold at 3 hpi to over 60-fold by 24 hpi and the CCR2 ligand CCL7 increased from eightfold at 3 hpi to over 80-fold at 24 hpi. Likewise, the CXCR2 ligand CXCL1 was upregulated over 150-fold at 3 hpi, decreasing to 20-fold by 24 hpi, while CXCL2 was upregulated tenfold at 3 hpi and decreased slightly to sixfold by 24 hpi. The CX3CR1 ligand CX3CL1 was not increased at these timepoints and was, in fact, modestly downregulated by 1.4-fold at 3 hpi. In parallel with changes in chemokine expression, we observed marked upregulation of adhesion factors, with ICAM-1 upregulated 12-fold at 3 hpi, decreasing to sixfold by 24 hpi, and VCAM-1 upregulated between four- and fivefold at each timepoint. Other adhesion factors involved in leukocyte trafficking were either unregulated (CD34), downregulated (Selectin-P ligand, twofold), or modestly upregulated (MAdCAM-1, twofold; GlyCAM-1, over twofold). Finally, a subset of immune genes were validated by RT-PCR (Fig. 1c), confirming the general pattern of expression revealed by the microarray though with greater dynamic range. For example, by RT-PCR we measured a 260-fold induction of CCL2 at 3 hpi that continued to increase to over 2000-fold upregulation by 12 hpi. Overall, we conclude that inoculation of the brain with TMEV induces rapid and robust upregulation of proinflammatory chemokines, cytokines, and adhesion factors in the hippocampus that can be detected as early as 3 h after injection.\n",

Serum was terminally isolated from mice inoculated with TMEV under the same conditions as above and CCL2 was measured by ELISA (Fig. 2a). Circulating levels of CCL2 were detected at 300 pg/mL as early as 3 hpi, with serum levels falling by 6 and 12 h (Fig. 2a). To measure the production of this chemokine in the CNS, separate animals were perfused with PBS to remove circulating factors and whole brain was homogenized for ELISA (Fig. 2b). As with the serum, CCL2 was robustly detected at 3 hpi, at levels in excess of 4000 pg per brain, and decreased sharply at 6 hpi (Fig. 2b). However, in contrast to serum, the brain levels rose again at 12 hpi and reached levels comparable to the 3 hpi values by 24 hpi. Based on our previous findings regarding the locus of neuronal injury during acute TMEV infection [7, 22], we also measured CCL2 in microdissected hippocampus at the same timepoints in separate animals (Fig. 2c). CCL2 levels peaked at 6 hpi and were measured at 1500 pg per mouse (hippocampi pooled for each individual animal). Notably, this amount of CCL2 represents approximately the same amount of CCL2 measured in the whole brain at this timepoint (Fig. 2b), suggesting that the hippocampus is the primary site for production at 6 hpi. Finally, to separate non-infectious pathogen recognition receptor-mediated effects from chemokine induction triggered by infectious virus, especially within the context of the very rapid response following inoculation, we compared the levels of CCL2 in the whole brain at 3 h after inoculation with UV-inactivated TMEV or live TMEV. In this experiment we measured 3010 \u00b1 425 pg/brain with live virus, 176 \u00b1 65 pg/brain with dead virus, and 88 \u00b1 16 pg/brain in sham mice (live vs dead P < 0.001; live vs sham P < 0.001; dead vs sham P = 0.703; by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett\u2019s pairwise comparison). We conclude that inoculation with infectious TMEV induces the rapid production of CCL2 in the brain and particularly in the hippocampus.\n",

To our surprise, immunostaining for CCL2 in uninfected mice revealed weak fluorescence associated with the pyramidal neurons of CA1, CA3, and the dentate gyrus (DG) (Fig. 2d). At higher magnification, this signal, not present in the secondary-only controls (not shown), exhibited a diffuse pattern associated with the cell layers (Fig. 2g). At 6 hpi, we consistently observed a robust increase in expression of CCL2 in pyramidal neuron cell bodies in the CA1, CA3, and DG regions (Fig. 2e). In addition, there was a clear increase in immunofluorescence in the terminal networks of the apical dendrites located in the stratum lacunosum moleculare (Fig. 2e, h). This observation is notable because we have previously reported that the hippocampal fissure, located just below the stratum lacunosum moleculare, is a primary site for infiltration of inflammatory monocytes [4]. Finally, the overall signal intensity faded by 24 hpi, though the pyramidal neuron layer-associated signal was more punctate and brighter than the earlier diffuse pattern (Fig. 2f, i). Whether some of this signal was associated with infiltrating monocytes was not resolved in this experiment. These observations suggest that the 6 hpi peak in hippocampal CCL2 measured by ELISA (Fig. 2c) was the result of production by hippocampal neurons.",

In wildtype mice at 18 hpi, we observed robust populations of all three cell types (Fig. 3a, c), with inflammatory monocytes making up about 25% of the total CD45+ population (Fig. 3e). In the absence of CCR2 expression, there was marked suppression of inflammatory monocyte infiltration and a relative increase in neutrophil recruitment, with no change in microglia (Fig. 3b, d). Indeed, inflammatory monocytes were reduced to less than 3% of total CD45+ cells (WT vs CCR2ko, P = 0.0004 by Dunnett\u2019s method; Fig. 3e).

To determine the relative contribution of these two chemokines to inflammatory monocyte recruitment during acute TMEV infection, we used immunodepletion to neutralize each factor. LysM-GFP monocyte-neutrophil reporter mice [4] received 20 \u03bcg goat anti-CCL2 IgG, 20 \u03bcg goat anti-CCL7, or 20 \u03bcg goat IgG by intraperitoneal injection at \u2212 12, 0, and + 12 h relative to time of infection. Brain-infiltrating leukocytes were isolated at 24 hpi and analyzed by flow cytometry to count inflammatory monocytes (CD45+GFPmid) and neutrophils (CD45+GFPhi) (Fig. 4). Mice treated with control IgG had approximately 5000 monocytes and 4000 neutrophils (Fig. 4a, d) in the brain infiltrate. This was reduced to about 3500 monocytes and 3500 neutrophils in mice treated with anti-CCL7 antibody (monocytes, F = 61.0887, P < 0.0001 by one-way ANOVA; P < 0.001 vs control IgG by Dunnett\u2019s method; neutrophils, F = 54.4998, P < 0.0001 by one-way ANOVA; P = 0.0879 vs control IgG by Dunnett\u2019s method) (Fig. 4c, d). More profoundly, treatment with anti-CCL2 antibody reduced the number of monocytes and the number of neutrophils to about 1500 each (monocytes, P = 0.0005 vs control IgG by Dunnett\u2019s method; neutrophils, P < 0.0001 vs control IgG by Dunnett\u2019s method) (Fig. 4b, d). For monocytes, this suggests that about 70% of the infiltration in response to TMEV infection is dependent upon the CCL2:CCR2 axis and about 30% requires the CCL7:CCR2 axis.\n",

The parental Ccl2-RFPflox/flox animals serve as a reporter line for CCL2 expression, and analysis of RFP fluorescence in mice at 6 hpi confirmed the CA1 neuronal expression of this chemokine (Fig. 5a\u2013c). Analysis of the Ccl2-RFPflox/flox x Syn-Cre conditional knockouts at the same timepoint revealed that CCL2 was specifically deleted from the CA1 neurons (Fig. 5d\u2013f). To verify the loss of CCL2 in the conditional knockout neurons, sections were also immunostained with anti-CCL2, as in Fig. 2. While strong immunoreactivity was detected in CA1 neurons and in the stratum lacunosum moleculare at 6 hpi in Ccl2-RFPflox/flox mice (Fig. 5g), essentially no reactivity was observed in the hippocampus in Ccl2-RFPflox/flox x Syn-Cre conditional knockouts (Fig. 5h). Serum was terminally isolated from Ccl2-RFPflox/flox and Ccl2-RFPflox/flox x Syn-Cre mice inoculated with TMEV and CCL2 was measured by ELISA (Fig. 5i). The large increase in circulating CCL2 observed at 6 hpi in Ccl2-RFPflox/flox mice was not detected in the Ccl2-RFPflox/flox x Syn-Cre mice (F = 35.9565, P < 0.0001 by two-way ANOVA; \u2212CCL2 vs +CCL2 at 6 hpi P < 0.0001 by Tukey\u2013Kramer pairwise analysis). However, by 24 hpi, the serum levels were the same in both groups (\u2212CCL2 vs +CCL2 at 24 hpi P = 0.9677 by Tukey\u2013Kramer) (Fig. 5i). Levels of CCL2 in the hippocampus were strongly reduced in the Ccl2-RFPflox/flox x Syn-Cre mice at both 6 and 24 hpi (F = 70.9728, P < 0.0001 by two-way ANOVA; \u2212CCL2 vs +CCL2 at 6 hpi P < 0.0001 by Tukey\u2013Kramer pairwise analysis; \u2212CCL2 vs +CCL2 at 24 hpi P = 0.0033 by Tukey\u2013Kramer) (Fig. 5j). These findings indicate that neurons are the dominant source of CCL2 in the hippocampus at 6 hpi and that neuronal CCL2 accounts for the serum levels measured at the same timepoint.\n",

Gates were established as described above on a CD45hi parent gate. The total number of CD45hi cells isolated from B6 mice and Ccl2-RFPfl/fl reporters was not different (F = 44.8489, P < 0.0001 by one-way ANOVA; B6 vs +CCL2, P = 1.000 by Dunnett\u2019s method) but the number of these cells in the neuron-specific CCL2-deficient mice was significantly reduced (\u2212CCL2 vs B6, P = 0.0001; \u2212CCL2 vs +CCL2, P = 0.0004) (Fig. 6d). The trend toward more CD45hi cells in the CCL2 reporter mice suggested by Fig. 6d was exacerbated in the neutrophil counts (Fig. 6e), though the difference was not significant (F = 87.2340, P < 0.0001 by one-way ANOVA; B6 vs +CCL2, P = 0.1908 by Dunnett\u2019s method). In contrast, the number of neutrophils infiltrating the brain was reduced in the neuron-specific CCL2-deficient mice (\u2212CCL2 vs B6, P = 0.0003; \u2212CCL2 vs +CCL2, P < 0.0001) (Fig. 6e). Finally, the number of inflammatory monocytes in the brain at 18 hpi did not differ between B6 and reporter mice (F = 56.8592, P < 0.0001 by one-way ANOVA; B6 vs +CCL2, P = 1.000 by Dunnett\u2019s method) but was significantly reduced in the neuron-specific CCL2-deficient mice (\u2212CCL2 vs B6, P < 0.0001; \u2212CCL2 vs +CCL2, P = 0.0024) (Fig. 6f). These observations support the conclusion that the limited CCL2 production and release measured in neuron-specific CCL2-deficient mice at 6 hpi results in a strong reduction in inflammatory monocyte infiltration into the brain at 18 hpi.\n",

Despite differences in nomenclature, host genetics, and details of the viral strain and inoculum, a general consensus has emerged that monocytic cells infiltrate the brain within hours of infection and create an inflammatory environment that kills neurons and alters neural circuitry.

Somewhat surprising, however, was the speed with which this induction occurred. We reproducibly detected large changes in transcription by 3 hpi, and in some experiments measured variable, but sizable, induction of chemokines and cytokines by 1 hpi (not shown). Moreover, these factors were detected at the protein level over the same acute period, with CCL2 measurable in the serum and brain as early as 1 hpi (not shown). Not only are these responses fast with regard to biosynthesis, but it is unlikely that a significant number of cells have even been infected in the brain by 3 hpi. Mathematical modeling constrains the infection rate to only 0.01 to 0.1 cells per minute [26], suggesting that fewer than 20 cells would be productively infected by 3 hpi. Even if this rate is off by a factor of 100, fewer than 2000 cells are infected by 3 hpi. Obviously, some cells can respond to virions and virus constituents via mechanisms that do not require active infection, such as pathogen (or pattern) recognition receptors [27], but our findings indicate that inoculation with UV-inactivated virus did not elicit CCL2 production in the brain at 3 hpi. This finding also rules out induction via non-specific trauma-induced effects associated with intracranial inoculation. Moreover, even assuming a direct effect of each active virion on target cells, we only inoculated the animals with 200,000 plaque-forming units and these were not introduced directly into the hippocampus [20]. Yet, at 6 hpi the hippocampus produced essentially all of the CCL2 measured in the brain and presumably contributed the majority of serum CCL2. This issue is further confounded by the pattern of CCL2 expression revealed by immunostaining, which shows that effectively every neuron in dorsal hippocampal CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus expressed this factor at 6 hpi (Fig. 2). As we have previously reported, even by 3 dpi, only a fraction of CA1 neurons are directly infected with TMEV and DG neurons are never positive for virus by immunostaining [22]. These observations and discrepancies suggest that a currently unidentified amplification event occurs almost immediately after inoculation with live virus that results in widespread, albeit tissue-specific, upregulation of CCL2 production. Furthermore, this induction occurs almost exclusively in neurons, as synapsin-promoter driven deletion of CCL2 results in nearly complete suppression of both hippocampal and serum CCL2 at 6 hpi (Fig. 5).",

Presumably, the remaining infiltrate in both experiments is CCL7-dependent, although the cellular source of this other CCR2 ligand is currently unknown. These findings suggest an intriguing maladaptive response: neurons respond to brain inoculation with TMEV by producing copious amounts of a chemokine that serves to recruit the inflammatory monocytes into the brain that ultimately kill those same neurons [4]. While the current study does not address the impact of a curtailed monocyte response on viral clearance or eventual lymphocyte recruitment, anecdotal evidence indicates that CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice do not succumb to lethal infection and, indeed, do not show any apparent adverse effects at later timepoints (out to several months).

            "text": "Maintaining the focus on the most acute response to TMEV infection rather than downstream sequelae, several notable findings arise from the current study. First, genetic deletion of CCR2 in all cells almost entirely abrogates inflammatory monocyte infiltration at 18 hpi but actually increases neutrophil infiltration at this timepoint. This suggests that in the context of life-long absence of CCL2:CCR2 signaling, neutrophil responses are not compromised by the absence of an inflammatory monocyte response. Second, acute systemic immunodepletion of CCL2 reduces inflammatory monocyte infiltration by 70% but also reduces neutrophil infiltration by more than half. This suggests that acute inhibition of the CCL2:CCR2 axis either impacts neutrophil recruitment directly (for example, brain-infiltrating neutrophils express CCR2 and respond to CCL2) or via an indirect effect on monocyte-to-neutrophil communication (for example, infiltrating monocytes release neutrophilic chemokines) [28]. Third, systemic immunodepletion of CCL7 blocks about 30% of monocyte infiltration but has no impact on neutrophils. This indicates that if brain-infiltrating neutrophils use a CCR2-dependent trafficking pathway, it is not responsive to CCL7 or that the CCL7-dependent brain-infiltrating monocytes are not responsible for creating the pro-neutrophil environment. While speculative, this may suggest that there are at least two functional subtypes of CCR2+ brain-infiltrating monocytes that can be distinguished by CCL2 vs CCL7 responsiveness. Fourth, the Ccl2-RFPfl/fl reporter line exhibits a trend toward increased neutrophil infiltration as compared to B6 mice. While not statistically significant due to the spread in values, this increase was visually evident in most of the mice, suggesting caution in studies analyzing leukocytic responses in these animals. Fifth, the robust inhibition of monocyte infiltration in the neuron-specific CCL2-deficient mice argues explicitly that this chemokine drives trafficking to the brain while side-stepping all of the issues regarding monocytopenia that arise in CCL2\u2212/\u2212 or CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice. This is in contrast to the reported role of CCR2 in West Nile virus encephalitis [14] but is consistent with the brain trafficking role described by Graham and colleagues in a Semliki Forest virus model [29]. Sixth, manipulation of either CCL2 or CCR2 drove the inflammatory monocyte response in the same direction\u2014down. This is in contrast to observations in a Japanese encephalitis model, in which CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice had reduced monocyte infiltration while CCL2\u2212/\u2212 mice had a paradoxical increase in this population in the brain [16]. Of note, however, our manipulation of CCL2 was via acute immunodepletion, not life-long genetic deletion.",

            "text": "The production of CCL2 by neurons during acute encephalitis may play a role in more than just leukocyte recruitment. For example, hippocampal neurons express CCR2 [21] and CCL2 directly enhances both NMDA receptor- and AMPA receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic potentials [30]. This suggests that the earliest stages of hippocampal circuit dysregulation associated with acute TMEV infection may be triggered locally by neuronal CCL2 acting in an autocrine fashion [31, 32]. In this context, it is notable that CCL2 immunoreactivity is strongly upregulated in CA1 neuron apical dendrite tufts located in the stratum lacunosum moleculare at 6 h after infection (Fig. 2). This layer is an important site of integration between the entorhinal cortex and CA1 pyramidal neurons (the perforant pathway) and is of fundamental importance to spatial and episodic memory formation [33]. It is also the site of GABAergic interneurons that are strongly activated by both entorhinal cortex and CA3-derived Schaffer collateral inputs [34]. These interneurons exhibit both AMPA receptor and NMDA receptor excitatory postsynaptic potentials [35] and are maximally activated at the theta oscillation peak and at the gamma oscillation trough [36]. These cells appear to mediate a robust feedforward inhibition that controls the size and timing of excitatory inputs onto CA1 neurons [37] and synchronizes network firing to theta frequency [34, 36]. Given the important role for hippocampal theta oscillations in learning and memory [38], it is likely that acute production of CCL2 in the stratum lacunosum moleculare would disrupt cognitive performance. It is also notable that neuronal CCL2 production has been observed following kainic acid- [39] and pilocarpine-mediated seizure induction [40] in rodents and both CCL2 and CCR2 are increased in tissue resected from humans with intractable epilepsy [41, 42]. Inhibition of either CCL2 production or CCR2 signaling suppressed seizures in a mouse model of systemic inflammation and mesial temporal lobe epilepsy [43]. Indeed, Caleo and colleagues have recently suggested that CCL2 \u201cmay act as a master regulator of inflammatory processes in the epileptic brain by both directly promoting hyperexcitability and regulating the activity of downstream inflammatory effectors\u201d [43]. Our findings echo this concept and add a third role in which hyperacute neuronal CCL2 production mediates CCR2-dependent inflammatory monocyte trafficking into the brain, resulting in the creation of an environment that further disrupts neural function and induces pyramidal neuron death [4, 7].",

Fold change relative to uninfected control for 16,900 genes present on the array was calculated, converted to log2, and heatmapped using Gitools. Sham controls were injected intracranially with culture media used for the virus preparation, and RNA was collected at 24 h postinfection (hpi). Expression data for all conditions except sham are the means from six individual mice analyzed in two separate experiments (three mice per experiment). Three sham mice were analyzed in the second experiment. a Heatmap showing pattern of transcriptional changes at 3, 6, 12, and 24 hpi relative to uninfected controls. The discontinuity in expression coding is the result of removing from analysis all genes with changes between \u2212 1.2-fold and + 1.2-fold at 24 hpi, leaving 6764 genes in the heatmap. Color-coded heatmaps range from greater than eightfold downregulated (log2 < \u2212 3.0; blue) to greater than eightfold upregulated (log2 > + 3.0; red). b The same expression data remapped to highlight chemokines, cytokines, and adhesion factors. In contrast to (a), values are continuous between negative eightfold and positive eightfold. Note that the color range was selected to reveal weaker changes in some genes, resulting in saturation at all timepoints for highly upregulated genes such as CCL2. c A further subset of highly upregulated and notable genes was validated by RT-PCR and the results heatmapped on a scale from 0 to 1000-fold (log2 = + 10) to reveal large expression changes over the first 12 h",
