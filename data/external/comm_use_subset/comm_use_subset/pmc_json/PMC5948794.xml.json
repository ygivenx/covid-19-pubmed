For most children, an initial RSV infection normally occurred within the first 2 years of life. In infants less than 1 year of age and with lower respiratory infection, up to 80% are due to RSV [1]. In most cases, the virus is not fatal. The most severe infections and well-defined high-risk groups, including infants with a history of premature birth, and those with chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease, cystic fibrosis and immunodeficiency [2]. For those high-risk infants, palivizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody which has produced favorable results to date, is strongly recommended to be administered prophylactically [3]. However, most children with RSV infection were previously healthy, and it is often difficult to predict deterioration of RSV infection [2, 4].",

The mechanism of RSV-related apnea is unknown, but a significantly reinforced laryngeal chemoreflex or an immature respiratory center in infancy has been proposed [11, 13]. Evidence of an encephalitic pathology caused by RSV infection is sparse. The presence of RSV in CSF, detected using polymerase chain reaction, was reported in a single case of a 4-month-old boy with febrile seizure [14]. The pathogenesis of RSV-related encephalitis is not yet fully understood. However, it has been hypothesized that RSV may enter the CNS through the hematogenous/blood-brain barrier route or through invasion, causing the release of several humoral neurotoxic cytokine mediators [15].",

This disease progresses quickly in a small number of cases, especially in children younger than 3 years old. At 1\u20135 days after onset, complications such as meningitis, encephalitis, encephalomyelitis, pulmonary edema and circulatory disorders occur. A very small number of infections worsen and lead to death. However, symptoms such as herpes and pulmonary edema were not observed in this patient, and both viral pathogen analyses showed negative results for enteroviruses, so this speculation was not supported. (2) High pathogenic influenza virus infection: the typical symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, headache, body pain and fatigue. Some patients progress quickly to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), shock and acute necrotic brain injury. However, this child underwent repeated influenza A virus antigen detection, and all results were negative; thus, this speculation was not supported. (3) Fulminant myocarditis: the initial symptoms primarily include fever, cough, fatigue and vomiting. The disease develops rapidly and can lead to sudden congestive heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and Adam-Strokes syndrome. ECG sometimes demonstrates ST-T changes, myocardial infarction, and arrhythmia. The cardiac ultrasound may show left ventricular enlargement.

Britton et al. have described cases of influenza-associated neurological disease without testing for influenza viruses in CSF specimens [16]. Whether the influenza virus invades the CNS or not is still controversial. Fujimoto et al. reported that influenza virus RNA was detected in the CSF of 71.4% (5/7) of patients who developed influenza-associated acute encephalopathy/encephalitis [17]. However, in other reports, only a small number of patients were positive for viral RNA in the CSF and brain, and there was a lack of inflammation in the brain tissue of fatal cases [18\u201321]. In the reported cases, no influenza RNA was detectable in the CSF. However, this finding does not exclude influenza as a cause of the encephalitis because the viral RNA may have been cleared by the time the CSF was taken. The fact that the RNA is no longer detectable does not exclude an earlier CNS insult by the virus causing the current symptoms. For the case reported here, although direct evidence of RSV infection in the CNS was not available, the clinical symptoms together with the laboratory findings and metagenomic analysis results suggested that the patient may have had severe sepsis that potentially resulting from an RSV infection with a high probability of CNS infection and acute neurological complications.",
