Since 2002, these cell-type-dependent requirements of accessory proteins have been explained by the discovery of HIV restriction factors that are present in a cell-type dependent manner. These findings have indicated that HIV replication in cells expressing specific restriction factors can be achieved only by using viral accessory proteins to counteract them and evade their inhibitory activity through a one-on-one confrontation, such as Vif versus APOBEC3 proteins7\u201310, Vpu versus BST-2/tetherin (referred to hereafter as BST-2)11,12, Vpx versus SAMHD113,14, and Nef versus SERINC515,16.",

This restriction factor is very peculiar in that, unlike the other three factors that specifically inhibit retroviral infections, BST-2 displays broad-spectrum activity against a variety of enveloped viruses as well as retroviruses, e.g., Marburg virus17, Lassa virus17,18, Ebola virus19,20, Sendai virus21, influenza virus22,23, herpes simplex virus 124, Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus25, vesicular stomatitis virus26, chikungunya virus27, SARS corona virus28, hepatitis B virus29, and hepatitis C virus30, human parainfluenza virus31, almost all of which harbor different viral antagonists against BST-2. This suggests the importance of counteracting this restriction factor for efficient viral replication. Because several in vivo studies have implied that the stoichiometric balance between restriction factors and viral antagonists might determine disease progression32\u201335, targeting BST-2 to enhance its endogenous expression may provide new therapeutic strategies.",

In this study, we employed newly established molecular methods using a catalytically inactive version of the clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated protein 9 (Cas9)-based RNA-guided activation system36. This modified CRISPR-Cas9 system allows us to specifically target and activate an endogenous promoter of a gene of interest, with a nuclease-deficient mutant of Cas9 (dCas9) that binds to a single guide RNA (sgRNA) by recruiting transcription factor complex(es). By using this system, we herein attempt to enhance the endogenous expression of BST-2 to observe whether the CRISPR-based pinpoint activation of BST-2 expression is able to confer cells with inhibitory activity on HIV-1 virion production, even in the presence of the viral antagonist Vpu that counteracts BST-2 by binding and downregulating the restriction factor37.",

We selected six different sgRNA targets against the BST-2 promoter (sgBST2#1\u20136) (Fig. 1A). To identify the best sgRNA target sequences in the BST-2 promoter, we cloned its promoter into a firefly luciferase reporter plasmid and cotransfected HeLa cells with this promoter-indicator plasmid together with plasmids expressing sgRNA appended to the phage MS2 RNA stem loop (sgRNA-MS2 loop), as well as dCas9 fused to the herpes simplex virus transcription factor VP16 minimal activation domain termed VP64 (dCas9-VP64), and the transcription factor fusion protein that is the NF-kB trans-activating subunit p65 with the activation domain from the human heat-shock factor 1 fused to the phage MS2 coat protein (MS2-p65-HSF1), and then we performed luciferase assays. The BST-2 promoter was activated by the CRISPR-dCas9 system using all six sgRNA targets, among which sgBST2#1 and #2 revealed a 30 to 40-fold activation (Fig. 1B). We therefore selected these two sgRNA target sequences for further experiments.",

            "text": "To examine whether these sgRNAs are indeed able to activate the endogenous expression of BST-2, we employed lentiviral vector systems for transduction. We first produced lentiviruses expressing dCas9-VP64 fusion proteins in HEK293T cells, next infected BST-2-negative HOS cells with the lentiviruses, and then selected the transduced cells with blasticidin whose resistance gene was expressed using the dCas9-VP64 vector. Next, we produced another lentivirus expressing the MS2-p65-HSF1 transcription factor fusion protein, transduced the blasticidin-selected cells with the viral vector, and selected the cells using hygromycin. Lastly, we generated a lentivirus expressing sgBST2#1 and/or sgBST2#2, and transduced the dually selected HOS cells with the viral vector and selected the cells with zeocin. By performing Western analysis, we successfully confirmed the activated expression of endogenous BST-2 protein in a polyclonal population of CRISPR-transduced HOS cells, although additive effect of two sgRNAs was not observed (Fig. 2A). Then, we cloned the transduced cells using limiting dilution and subjected the resultant single cell clone to real-time RT-PCR, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence. Real-time RT-PCR showed that endogenous expression of BST-2 mRNA was drastically activated in all single cell clones (Fig. 2B). Cell-surface BST-2 expression analyzed by flow cytometry was robustly increased in the cloned cells (Fig. 2C). Additionally, immunofluorescence revealed a high level of intracellular expression of BST-2 in the same cells (Fig. 2D). We conclude that this CRISPR-based system effectively activates BST-2 expression.",

Real-time RT PCR showed that CRISPR-transduced H9 clonal cells indeed expressed high levels of BST-2 mRNA (Fig. 4A) without affecting cell proliferation (Fig. 4B). We then performed viral replication assays using either wild-type HIV or Vpu-defective viruses. Consistent with the results obtained in the production assays, replication of not only the Vpu mutant but also the wild-type viruses were markedly decreased in BST-2 positive H9 cells (Fig. 4C).

            "text": "In this study, we first identified the sgRNA target sequences at the promoter regions that can activate expression of BST-2, then transduced cells with lentiviruses expressing the sgRNAs plus dCas9 together with accessory transcriptional activators and induced enhanced expression of BST-2 at both the mRNA and protein levels, resulting in successful inhibition of viral production and replication. In many cases, host restriction factors that are able to inhibit HIV infection are normally counteracted by HIV accessory proteins that act as viral antagonists. It has however been shown that the outcome of the battle between the host restriction factors and viral antagonists may be determined not only by their intrinsic activities but also by their stoichiometric balance, since overexpression of restriction factors can relieve the blockade imposed by viral antagonists12,15,16,39\u201342. This is also suggested by several studies showing that the levels of expression of restriction factors are linked to disease progression after viral infections32\u201335. In other words, even in the presence of virus-encoded antagonists, the more host restriction factors are expressed, the higher the chances to inactivate the viruses. Although type-I IFN can upregulate hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes that include many host restriction factors, the study of SIV-infected rhesus macaques showed that treatment with IFN\u03b1 is effective in vivo only during the acute phase of infection and rather detrimental during the chronic stage due to the enhancement of systemic inflammation43. Even in human studies, type-I IFNs have been reported to upregulate CCR544 that provides target cells for HIV-1, potentially leading to loss of CD4+ T-cells45\u201347. In this sense, it is likely that pinpoint activation of restriction factors without using IFNs might be beneficial to hosts. Indeed, our present study showed that endogenous BST-2 expression enhanced by CRISPR methods led to remarkably decreased production and multiple-round replication of HIV-1 harboring the viral antagonist Vpu, although in the case of APOBEC3G gene activation, its inhibitory effect on wild-type HIV-1 infection was weak48. Higher expression of BST-2 has been implicated in the growth and progression of cancers due to its ability to promote cell-to cell interactions and to activate NF-kB-mediated signal transduction pathways49. In this case, it may be better to avoid traditional overexpression systems using exogenous transgenes that lead to uncontrollably robust expression of target proteins, while CRISPR activation results in endogenously maximized levels of expression, reflecting a more natural mechanisms of action with physiologically relevant phenotypes in vivo50,51. Also, instead of the lentiviral systems that we used in this study, adeno-associated viral vectors should be applied to the future experiments to readily prepare high-titer virus stocks and to transduce primary cells. Moreover, it may be necessary to achieve specific gene delivery of CRISPR-based vectors to the infected cells. Targeting restriction factors to enhance their endogenous expression may provide a new therapeutic strategy to combat HIV infections. By using this system, we will pursue the possibility that the CRISPR-based activation of antiviral proteins, especially in the case of BST-2, could be one of the novel therapeutic strategies for inhibiting infections and preventing of transmission with HIV-1 as well as a variety of enveloped viruses.",

Lentiviral plasmids, lenti dCAS-VP64_Blast (expressing dCas9 fused to the VP64 transactivation domain), lenti sgRNA(MS2)_zeo backbone (expressing sgRNA linked to the MS2 bacteriophage coat protein-binding stem loop), and lenti MS2-P65-HSF1_Hygro (expressing MS2 fused to the NF-kB trans-activating subunit p65 with the activation domain from human heat-shock factor 1 (HSF1))36 were obtained from F.
