To address this problem, we developed a system that can drive conditional expression of an HCV transgene; our system involves the Cre/loxP system and a recombinant adenovirus capable of expressing Cre recombinase [5], [6]. Concerns have been expressed that an adenovirus and transient expression of HCV proteins could induce immune responses [5] and, therefore, obscure any evidence of the effect of the host immune responses on chronic liver pathology. Therefore, here, we used a Cre/loxP switching system to generate an immunocompetent mouse model of HCV protein expression; with this system, we could study the host immune responses against HCV proteins.",

However, the Ad-Cre adenovirus vector alone causes acute hepatitis in wild-type mice. Nevertheless, the transgenic model was useful for evaluating interactions between the host immune system and viral protein (serum ALT level over 2,000 IU/L) [5]; HCV core protein levels were reduced and expression of this protein was transient (about 2 weeks).

This important observation indicated that rVV-N25-induced HCV clearance was mediated by CD4 and CD8 T cells. Many studies have shown that spontaneous viral clearance during acute HCV infection is characterized by a vigorous, broadly reactive CD4 and CD8 T-cell response. [8], [22] HCV clearance and hepatocellular cytotoxicity are both mediated by CD8 antigen-specific (cytotoxic T lymphocyte) CTLs [23]. Consistent with these observations, rVV-N25 treatment effectively induced the accumulation of NS2-specific CD8 T cells, which express high levels of CD107a and IFN-\u03b3in the spleen. Notably, even with rVV-N25 immunization, the frequency of activated CD8 T cells was very low, and a minimum of 2-weeks incubation was required to distinguish the difference between rVV treatments. Even if a small population of specific CD8+ T cells played a relevant role in the reduction of core protein, it is difficult to assert that the only NS2-specific CD8+ T cells were important to this reduction. However, based on the results presented in Figure 4B, we are able to conclude that at least CD8+ and/or CD4+ T cells were important to the reduction in HCV core protein. Therefore, to elucidate the mechanism of HCV protein clearance, further investigation of not only the other T cell epitopes but also other immunocompetent cells is required.",

The HCV structural proteins (core, E1, and E2 proteins) in the rVV-CN construct may cause the difference; Saito et al. reported that injection with plasmid constructs encoding the core protein induced a specific CTL response in BALB/c mice [24]. Reportedly, CTL activity against core or envelope protein is completely absent from transgenic mice immunized with a plasmid encoding the HCV structural proteins, but core-specific CTL activity is present in transgenic mice that were immunized with a plasmid encoding the HCV core [21]. In contrast, when recombinant vaccinia virus expressing different regions of the HCV polyprotein were injected into BALB/c mice, only the HCV core protein markedly suppressed vaccinia-specific CTL responses [25]. Thus, the HCV core protein may have an immunomodulatory function [26]. Based on these reports and our results, we hypothesize that the causes underlying the effectiveness of rVV-N25 treatment were as follows: 1) this rVV construct included the core and envelope proteins and 2) the core protein had an immune-suppressive effect on CTL induction. Therefore, we suggest that exclusion of the core and envelope antigen as immunogen is one important factor in HCV vaccine design.",

This result indicated that rVV-N25 may modulate inflammation via innate immunity, as well as via acquired immunity. Reportedly, Toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent recognition pathways play a role in the recognition of poxviruses [27]. TLR2 and TLR9 have also been implicated in the recognition of the vaccinia virus [28], [29]. These findings indicate that TLR on dendritic cells may modulate the immunosuppressive effect of rVV-N25 in our model of HCV infection; however, further examination of this hypothesis is required. The finding that pathological symptoms in the HCV transgenic mice were completely blocked by intravenous injection of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 neutralizing antibodies indicated that the progression of chronic hepatitis depended on inflammatory cytokines in serum, rather than the HCV protein levels in hepatocytes. Lymphocytes, macrophages, hepatocytes, and adipocytes each produce TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 [30], [31], and HCV-infected patients have elevated levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 [32], [33]. Both cytokines also contribute to the maintenance of hepatosteatosis in mice fed a high-fat diet [34], and production of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 is elevated in obese mice due to the low grade inflammatory response that is caused by lipid accumulation [35]. These findings indicate that both cytokines are responsible for HCV-triggered hepatosteatosis, and anti-cytokine neutralization is a potential treatment for chronic hepatitis if antiviral therapy is not successful.",

The infectious titer of this blood sample has been previously reported [40]. R6CN2HCV and R6CN5HCV transgenic mice were bred with Mx1-Cre transgenic mice (purchased from Jackson Laboratory) to produce R6CN2HCV-MxCre and R6CN5HCV-MxCre transgenic mice, which were designated CN2-29(+/\u2212)/MxCre(+/\u2212) and RzCN5-15(+/\u2212)/MxCre(+/\u2212) mice, respectively. Cre expression in the livers of these mice was induced by intraperitoneal injection of polyinosinic acid\u2013polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)] (GE Healthcare UK Ltd., Buckinghamshire, England); 300 \u00b5L of a poly(I:C) solution (1 mg/mL in phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]) was injected three times at 48-h intervals. All animal care and experimental procedures were performed according to the guidelines established by the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science Subcommittee on Laboratory Animal Care.",

Separate full-length cDNAs encoding either the HCV structural protein, nonstructural protein, or all HCV proteins were cloned from HCV R6 strain (genotype 1b) RNA by RT-PCR.
