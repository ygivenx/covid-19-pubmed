Patients are at increased risk of a wide range of manifestations including autoimmunity, immune dysregulation, and malignancies, but infectious complications are the commonest (2\u20134). Historically, PID patients used to die before recognition because of infections due to the lack of effective measures to either prevent or treat them. Advances in public health and the discovery of antimicrobial agents made the diagnosis of PIDs possible (5).",

Among these microbes are viruses that in PID patients can be challenging with an increased risk of mortality and may predispose to malignancies (6\u20138). PIDs may also lead to reduced clearance and prolonged shedding of certain viruses like rhinovirus and poliovirus (9, 10). While most PIDs predispose to a wide spectrum of viral infections, certain diseases enhance vulnerability to specific viral infections (11).",

Viral infections affected more than 1/3 of the registered patients, many of whom were affected by more than 1 virus. The patients were affected by a range of viral organisms but CMV, adenovirus and EBV were the culprits in almost half of the cases. The high frequency of CMV infections (>20%) in our cohort can be explained by the fact that most of the cases are affected by combined immunodeficiencies. Patients with such defects are extremely susceptible to progressive infection with CMV (12). Our finding that CMV and parainfluenza infections are more common in the group of immunodeficiencies affecting cellular and humoral immunity has been documented previously (7, 15). The observation that EBV is more common in the immune dysregulation group specifically triggering HLH is also well-documented (8, 12). We have found that patients with DOCK8 deficiency are particularly predisposed to mucocutaneous viral infections like molluscum contagiosum and HSV infections. This is probably since DOCK8 is an important regulator of the actin cytoskeleton that is critical for cell migration through collagen-dense tissue, hence playing an important antiviral immunity in the skin (16).",

Health care providers should also be aware of the recommendations for live viral vaccines in immunodeficient patients and their close contacts (17). Live vaccines, such as the chicken pox, measles, mumps, rubella (MMR), rotavirus, yellow fever, oral polio, and the influenza nasal spray should be avoided in certain types of PIDs. Furthermore, any infants born into a family with a suspicious history of PID should avoid all live viral and bacterial vaccines until PIDs is ruled out.",

Other important variables that can be considered are the number of viral infection reactivations, the number of admissions to the hospital, the length of stay, and duration of using antiviral treatments. However, an important strength of the study is that the patients were followed prospectively by the same clinical immunologist. Another important strength of the study is that most patients were diagnosed at the molecular level. This may help in determining the genotype-phenotype correlation. Yet, collaborative efforts will be needed to collect a bigger number of patients.",
