            "text": "Type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECII) are since long recognized as important players of the innate immune system, secreting antimicrobial proteins like surfactant protein A, C and D, but also producing a variety of cytokines and chemokines [1-3]. Due to their location, they are exposed to microbes reaching the alveolus and can be infected by several infectious agents, such as influenza virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus, Legionella pneumophila, Bacillus anthracis or Mycobacterium tuberculosis which is well known to multiply and to survive within AECII [4-10]. Indeed alveolar epithelial cells are being by far more numerous than the macrophages, the phagocytic cell prototype [11]. However besides the AECII, the alveolar surface is also covered by type I AEC but these cells mostly play a role for gaz exchange [12]. In contrast, cuboidal AECII were suggested to play a possible role of non-professional antigen-presenting cells as they were reported to express both class I and class II major histocompatibility complex molecules (MHC) [13]. Interestingly, AECII are in contact with a huge amount of lymphocytes, the cells involved in the development of specific immune responses. Indeed, the number of lymphocytes in the lung interstitium has been reported to be 1010, which is similar to the number of circulating lymphocytes [14].",

As T-cell receptor engagement and co-stimulatory signals are usually required for the full activation of T cells, different authors have analyzed the expression of co-stimulatory molecules by AECII. However, several contradictory results were published, each paper focusing on a limited amount of phenotypic markers. Major differences between the results might be explained by technical differences between the studies [13,15-19]. In addition, most studies were performed on a human tumor cell line, the A549, defined as a model of human AECII [20], as freshly isolated AECII from human pulmonary pieces are rather difficult to obtain.",

We have characterized the expression of MHC-class II molecules and the expression of different co-stimulatory molecules known to be involved in the immunological synapse, CD80, CD86, ICOS-L, CD40, CD54, CD58. The expression of these molecules was analyzed first on resting cells and then on cytokine-activated cells. To mimic inflammation, we chose to analyze the effect on the AECII phenotype of two major inflammatory cytokines, IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1, known to modulate some of these surface molecules [17,21-26].",

However, until now different contradictory results have been published both concerning the surface-expressed molecules involved in antigen presentation and the in vitro T lymphocyte response to AECII-presented antigens [13,15-19,31,32]. We postulated that such differences could be due to the use of different cell types (cell line or not), and to the absence of standardization of the techniques used to analyze these markers. The expression of co-stimulatory molecules by AECII was first reported but recent papers claim that some markers are absent and could contribute to an unresponsiveness of T lymphocytes to AECII stimulation. However, as interstitial lung lymphocytes comprise as much CD8+ and CD4+ lymphocytes [Beukinga I, personal communication], we carefully compared here the classically used model of type II AEC, the A549 cell line, to freshly isolated AECII, for their surface expression of the major markers involved in the immunological synapse. As these surface molecules can be modulated by inflammatory molecules released during lung infections, we further analyzed the modulation of these markers expression by two major inflammatory cytokines, IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 [17,21-26]. We adapted the protocol described by I.R. Witherden and T.D. Tetley for the isolation of AECII as the recommended enzymatic treatment with trypsin does not affect the expression of surface markers on AECII [13], in contrast to dispase sometimes used to isolate AECII and who degrades ICOS-L [18].",

These two last observations reinforce the data obtained by Redondo et al. who find a very low expression of MHC-II molecules by the A549 cell line with no modulation by IFN-\u03b3 [21]. In contrast, we reported here that the constitutive MHC-II molecules expression by freshly isolated cells was significantly upregulated by IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1, suggesting further the potential of these cells to present antigens to CD4+ T lymphocytes. These data differ from those reported by Debabbi et al. [17], most probably as a consequence of differences in the set up analysis used. Indeed, as stressed in the Material and Methods section, we subtracted the auto-fluorescence of non-stained cells before comparing the MFI from stimulating and resting cells to take into account the observed MFI increase of the resting cells, probably secondary to morphological changes.",

The most powerful one is given by the B7/CD28 interaction [33]. In agreement with Cunningham et al., we showed here a lack of expression of CD80 (B7-1) and a low expression of CD86 (B7-2) both on the A549 cell line and on the freshly isolated AECII [31]. Only a slight increase in the densities of CD80 and CD86 and in the number of CD86 expressing cells on the A549 cell line was noted in the presence of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1. Another member of the B7 family, ICOS-L (B7-H2), has been described as playing a role in the activation of memory T lymphocytes [34], but we did not confirm its previously reported expression on AECII [26]. Indeed, we found a very low expression of ICOS-L with no modulation, both on the A549 cell line and on the freshly isolated AECII (data not shown). Globally, these results indicate that B7 family molecules are expressed only at low level by AECII and that their surface expression is not strongly induced upon activation, as opposed to professional APC, such as activated dendritic cells or macrophages. Finally, the expression of CD40 was also shown to be low at the basal state on both cell types with however a slight but significant increase after stimulation with the combination of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1. Whether the increased expression of these molecules observed in both A549 and AECII, has an impact on the antigenic presentation need to be proved.",

However, alternative co-stimulatory signals have been reported allowing the stimulation in recall responses of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in the absence of B7/CD28 interaction. This pathway involves the CD54/LFA-1 and/or CD58/CD2 interactions [35-37]. Both the A549 cell line and the freshly isolated AECII expressed CD54 and CD58 with a higher level of expression of CD54 and a lower expression of CD58 on the AECII compared to the A549 cell line. Even if no regulation of the expression of CD58 was observed after cytokines stimulation, its high basal expression suggests that this molecule could play a role in the immunological synapse and allow efficient lymphocyte activation as shown for endothelial cells [36]. In contrast, the expression of CD54 was highly upregulated after cytokines stimulation on both cell types. The role of these molecules when the B7/CD28 interaction is lacking was previously shown in a mouse model [35]. Therefore, we suggest that both CD58 and CD54 could play a major role in the antigenic presentation by AECII and that these cells could be able to present antigens to both CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes.",
