Since humoral responses are induced by epitopes on the surface of antigen, rather than the whole antigen, it is important to locate these epitopes on antigen for the purpose of effective vaccine design. The most reliable methods for identification of an epitope are X-ray crystallography and NMR techniques, but they are time consuming and expensive. Candidate epitopes that are selected by computational methods prior to laboratory experiments can lead to both significantly reducing the experimental cost and substantially accelerating the identifying process [1].",

These methods can be classified into two categories: sequence-sequence alignment methods and sequence-structure alignment methods [13]. Sequence-sequence alignment methods predict epitopes according the alignment of mimotope sequences and the antigen sequence, while sequence-structure alignment methods predict epitopes according to the alignment of mimotope sequences and the antigen structure. Sequence-structure alignment methods can be further divided into 4 kinds by the core idea of the alignment: motif-based methods, pairs-based methods, patch-based methods, and graph-based methods.",

MimoPro employs the idea of patch-based and graph-based searching. The core idea of MimoPro is a searching algorithm operated on a series of overlapping patches on the surface of antigen. These patches are then transformed to a number of graphs using an adaptable distance threshold (ADT) regulated by compactness factor (CF), a novel parameter proposed in the method. Then on each single patch, a complete search is conducted to guarantee the best alignment for each mimotope sequence. Dynamic programming and branch-bound methods are also adopted to both avoid repetition in searching and further narrow the search space.",

In the first state, an epitope is defined as the surface residue of antigen with ASA decreased more than a given threshold upon binding with the antibody, and 1 \u00c52 is frequently used. There are some tools to calculate ASA, and the usually used tool is NACCESS [15] or Surface Racer program [16]. In the second state, an epitope is defined as the residue of antigen which has a contact area above a given threshold upon interaction with the antibody, while the value 4 \u00c5 is frequently used. Among these two ways of definition the second one is generally accepted and applied. Ponomarenko tested in his paper that choosing which way to define epitope may not influence the results [17]. In this paper we define epitopes by the first way. In addition, we consider an amino acid residue as a surface residue if the RSA (relative accessible surface area) of its side chain is greater than 5% with 1.4 \u00c5 probe radius.",

The common machine learning methods can better handle the problems with nearly the same number of positive samples and negative samples. In fact, the real dataset in this study is imbalanced, and the instances from negative class take the majority of the data. There are commonly two approaches to deal with the imbalanced datasets: one is adding samples to minority class or assigning a high weight to the samples to minority class, and the other is downsizing the majority class. In the training dataset of this work, the rate of nonepitopes versus epitopes is about 8 : 1. To ensure the effectiveness of prediction, we deal with the imbalance data through the following ways.Random sample from the negative data of the training dataset was executed to make the ratio of positive data and negative data 1 : 1 for n times; then there would be n new subsets of the training datasets.Random forest model was built on each subset. Then for a new instance, n random forest models will give n results and the voting mechanism is utilized to make the final decision.\n",

As shown in Figure 1, the core algorithm includes five steps: dividing antigen surface into overlapped patches, constructing undirected graph on each patch, generating extreme value distribution for each mimotope sequence, aligning mimotopes on each patch and scoring patch, and determining candidate epitope residues in the highest score patch.As usually used, the number of amino acids in an antigen surface patch of given size is constant and may contain fixed number of amino acids in epitope and nonepitope. However, this may take an obvious defect. Different protein has different structures; even the same protein may have different domains. The space compactness of these regions has big diversity; hence an efficient patch should be \u201cbig\u201d enough to contain the meaningful edges in sparse region and also be \u201csmall\u201d enough to prune the false edges in compact region. MimoPro solves this problem; it generates overlapped patches with variable number of amino acids in it according to a compactness factor (CF). The presence of CF also makes next searching step simpler and faster.For every antigen surface patch, we take each residue as a vertex and the useful connections which were determined in the above step were taken as edges to construct surface undirected graph.Then the method needs to find the best matched path for each mimotope sequence in each surface patch graph. Since these paths may have different lengths, to assess the similarity between a path and a mimotope sequence and to give consensus scores to these paths with different lengths, MimoPro employs a statistical scoring norm called P value which is derived from the extreme value distribution, and the parameters are fitted from the empirical distribution [31].Dynamic programming and branch and bound method were employed in the step of aligning mimotopes on each patch. Dynamic programming method ensures the searching is complete; and the branch and bound method ensures the searching is efficient. Then after this step, every patch was scored according to the matching paths. Then the residues in the highest score patch are retained as the candidate epitopes.\n",

In these years, lots of computational methods have been proposed for epitope prediction. These methods predict epitopes either by antigen structure or by mapping mimotopes to the original antigen surface. In this study, we proposed a new epitope prediction method based on antigen preprocessing by six epitope propensity scales and MimoPro searching. The performance of the method is superior to random prediction. Besides specificity, PPV measure improved a lot compared to MimoPro on the testing datasets. Compared with Pep-3D-Search, EpiSearch, and PepSurf, three other mimotope-based tools, testing results from the new method have shown that in most cases, it performed equal to or better than the what three methods did. On average from 18 test cases, performance of the new method indicated by sensitivity, PPV, and F value is better than that of Pep-3D-Search, EpiSearch, and PepSurf in epitope prediction. This implies that the new method is a viable alternative to, if not the preferred choice, all of PepSurf, Pep-3D-Search, EpiSearch, and MimoPro for epitope prediction in the same kind.",

            "text": "However, the new method is the first attempt to combine the idea of structure-based method and mimotope-based method, and the method is an improvement of our MimoPro. As seen from the results that for extremely difficult cases where amino acids forming the epitope include both consecutive segments and isolated amino acids, such as 3BT1 and 2HYM, the method failed in producing any useful mappings. This indicated where our method should be further improved although outcomes from PepSurf, EpiSearch, and Pep-3D-Search for the two test cases were not good either. Potentially this could be achieved through the following aspects in future. Firstly, selecting effective features or feature combination may potentially improve the performance of antigen processing. Secondly, to improve the performance of mapping mimotopes to the antigen surface, a more appropriate substitution matrix according to a specific application should be adopted so that graph rating is more meaningful to such application. In addition, intelligent searching algorithm could be modified so that the highly rated patches are searched first to make searching more efficient.",
