HIV-1 infection of these cells transactivates the LTR promoter inducing \u03b2-galactosidase production. Infected cells stained dark blue after the addition of the chromogenic substrate X-Gal. All tested Idea-PP pools reduced the number of HIV-1-infected cells in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 2D, E, F), whereas the non-modified original material had no effect (Fig. 2C). However the antiviral effect was more prominent when Idea-PP was produced with a molar ratio of protein to HOCl of 1\u22361000 (Fig. 2E: IC90 0.5 \u00b5g/ml, IC50 3.5 \u00b5g/ml) compared to the material generated with a ratio 1\u2236300 (Fig. 2D: IC90 7 \u00b5g/ml, IC50 31 \u00b5g/ml).

The myeloperoxidase associated with neutrophil extracellular traps is active [42], and therefore likely producing Idea-Ps. Recently Saitoh et al [43] showed that NETs in addition to bacteria and fungi also capture the human immunodeficiency virus.

Treatment of plasma protein with the myeloperoxidase/HOCl system was shown to lead to the conversion of L-threonine into 2-hydroxypropanal and its dehydration product, acrolein (2-propenal), an extremely reactive \u03b1, \u03b2-unsaturated aldehyde [44]. Aldehyde production was also mimicked by hypochlorous acid (HOCl) in the absence of the enzyme. In a murine model of acute myocardial infarction, the myeloperoxidase/HOCl system was found to be a major source of acrolein [45]. The \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehyde acrolein can form bis-adducts with lysine residues, which are called FDP-lysines [46]. The electrophilic \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl moiety is retained in FDP-lysine, allowing it to undergo a nucleophilic addition of thiols [47]. Protein-conjugated FDP-lysine was detected by the FDP-lysine specific antibody F56 [46]. Using antibody F56 we documented that Idea-HSA, but not the unmodified mother protein HSA, contained FDP-lysine residues. As Idea-Ps binding to gp120, CD4 and PDI is inhibited by DTNB and Idea-Ps clearly contain accessible chemical groups that react eagerly with free SH groups, it is likely that SH-groups are at least in part involved in the interaction between Idea-Ps and HIV-1. FDP-lysine groups have been shown to bind covalently to free SH groups of the protein glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase [47]. Probably FDP-lysine groups in Idea-Ps will also link Idea-Ps to its targets on HIV-1 in a covalent manner. The very slow off rates seen in the sensorgrams of the plasmon resonance data support this interpretation.",

            "text": "Other microorganisms depend on an amyloid coat to attach to host cells [51] and on active thiols for entry into the host cell as well. The coxsackievirus A9 and dengue fever virus serotype 2 use the amyloid recognizing chaperone BiP as a co-receptor for virus internalization [52], [53]. Ryser et al described that HIV-1 entry into host cells can be inhibited by bacitracin [28]. Bacitracin is usually considered to be a specific inhibitor of PDI activity. Recently, however, bacitracin has been shown to have in addition significant effects on both no catalyzed protein folding and on other molecular chaperones. Especially bacitracin significantly inhibits the chaperone activity of BiP, the general binding protein for amyloid-like proteins [54]. As Idea-proteins bind to BiP and the known HIV-1 entry inhibitor bacitracin inhibits BiP, it is likely that in addition to the chaperone PDI, the chaperone GRP78/BiP, a principal sensor for amyloidogenic proteins, is involved in HIV-1-infection. Involvement of cell surface BiP would also explain the enhancement of HIV-1 infectivity by Semen-derived Enhancer of Virus Infection (SEVI). As other viruses have been shown to use BiP for internalisation [55], [56] Idea-proteins might also be useful as inhibitors of other virus infections. Jain et al observed that blocking the production of free thiols by thiol-disulfide exchange inhibitors of the fusion protein (F) of the Newcastle disease virus (NDV) the F protein inhibited membrane fusion required for viral entry and cell-cell fusion [57]. The role of thiol-disulfide exchange in host cell entry/invasion is not restricted to viruses. According to Conant et al Chlamydia attachment to mammalian cells requires protein disulfide isomerase [58], and disulfide oxidoreductase activity of Shigella flexneri is required for invasion of epithelial cells [59]. The protein disulfide isomerase of the parasite Neospora canium is involved in tachyzoite-host cell interaction [60].The PDI was even identified to play an important role in cancer cell (glioma) invasion [61]. Therefore our newly discovered neutrophil function might be of general relevance to path physiology.",

            "text": "Figure 8: We postulate that the myeloperoxidase/HOCl system, in addition to its other roles in host defence, works as a mechanism to form HIV-1 inhibitors by forming amyloid-like proteins that immobilizes the virus and by the generation of FDP-lysine residues on these proteins that attack ecto-sulfhydryls in gp120, CD4 and in the PDI. Idea-proteins have an amyloid-like structure and bind with high affinity to proteins and regents offering free thiol groups. As these amyloid-like proteins bind to HIV-1, oligomerize, and built aggregates and nets, they will probably immobilize the virus and interfere with its binding to the cell surface chaperone GRP78/BiP. High affinity binding was shown to gp120, CD4 as well as to PDI. Thiol-blocker DTNB inhibited the binding of Idea-P to gp120, CD4 and PDI showing that the binding was SH-dependent. Other proteins involved in HIV-1 entry that offer free SH-groups are thioredoxin, a 12-kD redox protein, necessary for disulfide exchange in domain 2 of CD4, and the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), essential for reduction of gp120 disulfide bonds, which triggers the major conformational changes in gp120 and gp41 required for virus entry. We hypothesize that Idea-P can inhibit on several levels HIV-1 entry by immobilization and by blocking free thiols.",
