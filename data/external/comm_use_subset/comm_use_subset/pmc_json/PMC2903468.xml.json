            "text": "Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is a member of the Alphavirus genus in the family Togaviridae and is maintained in a natural enzootic cycle between mosquitoes and rodent hosts, although equines and humans may also be infected in an epizootic cycle [1]. While VEEV causes high-titered viremia in equines, resulting in encephalitis with a mortality rate between 30 to 90%, disease in humans is usually self-limited and consists of fever, chills, malaise, and severe headaches, with 1 to 4% progressing to severe encephalitis [2]. Outbreaks of epizootic VEEV (subtypes 1AB and 1C) occur periodically in South and Central America, even spreading to south Texas, and therefore it is considered an emerging pathogen [3]. While the last major transcontinental outbreak of epizootic VEEV occurred in 1969\u20131971, smaller South and Central American outbreaks of VEEV 1C have occurred since, such as the one in Colombia and Venezuela in 1995\u20131996 [4], [5]. In the mid to late 1990's outbreaks caused by the usually enzootic subtype VEEVs occurred in Peru and Panama (VEEV-1D), and in the Mexican states of Chiapas and Oaxaca (VEEV-1E) [6]\u2013[9].",

Although the crystal structures of the E1 and capsid proteins of several alphaviruses have been solved, no well-diffracting crystals of either E2 or virus particles have been obtained [26]\u2013[28]. However, cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) reconstructions of several alphaviruses have been reported and have provided insights into probable E1/E2 structure-function relationships [25], [29]\u2013[32].

In this report we have presented a map of the human VEEV antibody response and determined the human immunodominant epitopes on the VEEV E1 and E2 proteins. We used phage-display technology to isolate VEEV-specific hFabs from bone marrow donors known to have circulating antibodies for VEEV [44]\u2013[47]. We have characterized a panel of 11 hFabs for VEEV surface protein specificity, subtype cross-reactivity, and in vitro virus-neutralizing capacity. Two anti-E2 hFabs, H6 and F5, one of which (F5) exhibited potent neutralizing activity, were converted to fully human IgG1 molecules. Two F5 hMAb neutralization-escape VEEV variants were isolated. Sequencing of the E1 and E2 protein genes of these variant viruses identified a unique human VEEV neutralization domain as the likely binding site of the F5 hMAb. Alphavirus cryoEM maps, with associated markers, support proposing a probable surface-accessible location on VEEV E2 for the F5 native (n) IgG binding site.",

Initial RT was performed at 50\u00b0C for 30 min, followed by denaturation at 96\u00b0C for 2 min. PCR included 10 cycles of 96\u00b0C for 20 sec, 52\u00b0C for 30 sec, 68\u00b0C for 2.5 min; 25 cycles of 96\u00b0C for 20 sec, 52\u00b0C for 30 sec, 68\u00b0C for 2.5\u20136.7min; and a final extension at 68\u00b0C for 7 min in a DNA Engine Thermocycler (BioRad, Hercules, CA). The resulting amplimers were gel purified using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen), essentially following the manufacturer's protocol. Approximately 20\u201330 ng of each amplimer was used for direct sequencing using a 9800 Fast Thermocycler, a Big Dye automated DNA sequencing kit, and a 3130\u00d7l Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).",

The human donor sera were tested against inactivated VEEV TC-83 using an indirect ELISA. Only inactivated VEEV was used at AAT; both native and inactivated VEEV were used at DVBID, CDC, and Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO. Two donor bone marrows, 951 and 1037, were selected for use in constructing phage display libraries. Large libraries, 2.6\u20135.7\u00d7109 phage particles per ml, were obtained and panned through four rounds on inactivated VEEV TC-83. A panel of hFab clones from panning rounds three and four for each of four libraries (951\u03ba, 951\u03bb, 1037\u03ba, and 1037\u03bb) was screened on VEEV TC-83 as well as 1% BSA (negative control). Three hFab clones with the highest ELISA signals from each of the four libraries were selected for sequence analysis. The sequencing results (not shown) showed that all three 951\u03ba clones were identical. Ten of the 12 clones had the same variable HC region, but the majority of those Fabs had different LC sequences. In all, there were 10 unique clones in three separate HC groupings. Four hFab clones, P3F2, P3F5, P3H6, and P3G1, were expressed as soluble molecules and purified by Ni-NTA column chromatography for use in serological assays. These four clones were also converted to full-length IgG1 molecules (Figure S2). Because the P3F5 clone had significant VEEV-neutralizing ability, a stable cell line expressing F5 nIgG was generated in 293-EBNA cells.",

Fab LR3H11 was assigned to epitope hE2a2 based on the similarities of its ELISA titration curve to that for the anti-hE2a1 MAb (Figure 1) and its cross-reactivity (Table 1), and on differences in HCDR3 and LCDR3 sequences (Table 2). LR3H11 had a generally lower level of reactivity to all the VEEV subtypes (especially subtypes 3, 5, and 6), compared to H6 eIgG. The higher reactivity level of H6 eIgG compared to Fab LR3H11 could be due to the fact that H6 is a complete IgG molecule. Although the HCDR3 sequence is the same for LR3H11 and the anti-hE2b Fabs, the LCDR3 sequences are completely different (Table 2). The three anti-hE2b Fabs, KR2A3, KR2B12, and KR2C2, have identical HCDR3 sequences and the LCDR3 sequences are 44 to 100% similar (Table 2). Fabs KR2A3 and KR2B12 have the same sequence throughout except for one aa change in framework region 2 (Lys to Arg). In addition, this group of Fabs had a distinct reactivity profile consisting of three reactivity groups (curves) which included the following subtypes and varieties: (1) 1AB, 1C, 1D, 2; (2) 1E, 3, 5, 6; and (3) 4 (Figure 1). MAb F5 nIgG had a unique cross-reactivity pattern and unique HCDR3/LCDR3 sequences as well as potent viral neutralizing activity, and was assigned to epitope hE2c (Tables 1, 2; Figure 1). Fab 951 D3, which was isolated from a different bone marrow donor, also had unique HCDR3/LCDR3 sequences and a unique cross-reactivity pattern, and was assigned to epitope hE2d (Tables 1,2; Figure 1).",

One-way competitions included F5 nIgG competing with anti-mE2a-HRP and anti-mE2e-HRP (59% and 56%, respectively); however, neither anti-mE2a nor anti-mE2e could compete with F5-HRP. Murine and humanized anti-E2c MAbs 1A4A-1 and Hy4-IgG [43] competed with F5-HRP (92% and 95%, respectively), but F5 did not significantly block the virus binding of anti-E2c 1A4A-1-HRP (20%). Additionally, there was no competition between F5 and anti-E2g or anti-E2h mMAbs. These analyses indicate that F5 nIgG does not bind to an epitope within the major neutralization domain on the VEEV E2 glycoprotein defined by mMAbs [33].",

Mutations in the variant viruses were found only in the E2 glycoprotein between aa 115\u2013119 (Table 7). The vF5-3 virus had a transition from A to G at nucleotide 8906, resulting in a non-conservative amino acid change from Lys to Glu at E2 aa115. There was also a deletion of nucleotides 8918\u20138923, coding for Val (E2 aa119), in the parent virus. The vF5-5 virus had a silent G to A change at nucleotide 8908, followed by a deletion of nucleotides 8909\u20138911, which code for Lys (E2 aa116). The sequence change at E2 aa115 and deletions at E2 aa116 and 119 in these neutralization-escape variant viruses indicate that F5 binds at this site in the E2 glycoprotein. F5 nIgG neutralizing activity was somewhat more reduced with vF5-5 virus than with vF5-3, suggesting that the deletion of Lys is more disruptive for F5 binding than the Lys to Glu substitution coupled with the Val deletion found in the vF5-3 virus.",

Although non-human primate models have been used to evaluate vaccine efficacy of candidate VEEVs, the antibody repertoires in these primates and humans have not been well characterized [16], [17], [53]. Use of phage antibody libraries generated from immune or nonimmune donors has proved to be an efficient method for obtaining a diverse set of non-human primate or human antibodies for a wide variety of viruses: VEEV [54], human papillomavirus [55], Sin Nombre virus [56], West Nile virus [57], yellow fever virus (YFV) [58], rabies virus [59], SARS-coronavirus [60], hepatitis A virus (HAV) [61], dengue 4 virus (DENV4) [62], rotavirus [63], Hantaan virus [64], measles virus [65], and HIV [66]. In this study we have characterized 11 unique hFabs and hMAbs for viral protein specificity, VEEV subtype cross-reactivity, and virus neutralization capacity and constructed the first human epitope map for the E1 and E2 proteins of an alphavirus. In addition we have mapped the potential E2 binding site of the potent neutralizing hMAb F5 nIgG using CBAs with the other hFabs as well as anti-VEEV mMAbs, and isolated and sequenced the RNA coding for E1 and E2 glycoproteins of F5 neutralization-escape variant viruses.",

In fact, no VEEV type-specific hMAbs were isolated. The methodology for generating the mMAbs was different from that used in this study, but in all studies screening was done on plate-bound, purified virus and clones were selected that had the highest level of binding by ELISA. The virus used for panning in this study was inactivated with either 0.3% or 0.05% BPL, while live virus was used in ELISAs to select mMAbs. However, the BPL-treated virus was reactive with neutralizing mMAbs in ELISA and it was assumed that neutralizing hMAbs would also bind this antigen. HMAb F5 nIgG was originally selected using 0.3% BPL-treated virus, but it was later discovered that its binding to live virus was 50\u201375% greater (Table S2); therefore, the amount of BPL used was decreased to 0.05%, which improved F5 binding (data not shown). The fact that the binding of mMAbs was not affected by treating virus with 0.3% BPL, but binding of hMAb F5 was affected, suggests that epitopes recognized by the VEEV neutralizing mMAbs and hMAb F5 may not be the same.",

Both F5 nIgG and 3B4C-4 are potent neutralizing MAbs while neither H6 eIgG nor G1eIgG have biological activity, so in this case high affinity was not necessarily correlated with neutralization capacity. CBA analysis indicated that the hE2c epitope defined by F5 nIgG does not spatially overlap any of the other epitopes defined by the panel of hFabs (Table 3). The cross-reactivity profile of this hMAb was also unique (Table 1, Figure 1). CBA results comparing F5 and a panel of mMAbs important in defining a major VEEV E2 neutralization domain suggested that epitopes mE2d and mE2f were spatially near epitope hE2c based on reciprocal competition patterns (Table 4). The mE2f epitope has been mapped to residue E2-183, but mE2d has not yet been mapped [36]. However, in the original description of this neutralization domain defined by mMAbs, there was no direct competition between mE2d and mE2f\n[33]. Further analysis revealed that F5 neutralized all four mMAb neutralization-escape variant viruses to the same degree as the parent VEEV TC-83, indicating that binding of F5 was not affected by an aa change at either E2-182, -183, -199 or -207, providing important evidence that F5 recognized a different E2 epitope than any of the four neutralizing mMAbs used to generate the variant viruses (Table 5).",

Based on the aa changes in the variant viruses, F5 binding was mapped to aa residues E2-115 to 119 (Table 7). The aa deletions and substitution in vF5-5 and vF5-3 viruses alter the net charge or degree of hydrophilicity in this E2 region, possibly affecting the accessibility of this epitope for antibody binding. Variant virus vF5-5 was more resistant than vF5-3 to neutralization with F5, although both variant viruses required significantly more MAb for neutralization than required for VEEV TC-83 (Table 6). We also tested whether or not the humanized mMAb Hy4 IgG, specific for the mE2c epitope, could neutralize these two variant viruses. If the binding sites for F5 and Hy4 are different, it would be expected that Hy4 would neutralize both F5 variant viruses. However, only vF5-3 was neutralized, and vF5-5 was as resistant to neutralization by Hy4 as it was to F5. This rather puzzling result, in addition to the reciprocal competition between F5 and the anti-E2f mMAb, might suggest some type of interaction or induced conformational change between the neutralization domains located at E2 aa182\u2013207 and E2 aa115\u2013119. Of course the possibility cannot be excluded that the detected mutations are not the contact residues for F5, but that these amino acid substitutions or deletions induce distant conformational changes that affect MAb binding.",

It was proposed that these E2 residues that formed an alternative neutralization site could be folded to form a binding site with the surface dimensions of approximately 600\u2013750 \u00c5, measurements similar to those determined for the interaction of lysozyme\u2013anti-lysozyme immune complexes [69]. Transposon-insertion mutagenesis of SV resulted in a virus with an insertion at E2-119 that was less efficiently neutralized by SV mMAbs 202 (anti-E2ab) and 209 (anti-E2c) [70]. Similarly, a variant of RRV, attenuated in mice, had five E2 aa differences compared to wild-type at positions 3, 67, 119, 251, and 302 [39]. Residue 251 lies in the major neutralization domain, whereas residues 67 and 119 were proposed to influence neutralization efficiency in the variant virus. Examination of VEEV E2 mutations that affect virus binding to heparan sulfate led to a proposal that E2 residues 76 and 116 may form a conformational, surface-accessible epitope, but its involvement with virus neutralization is unknown [71].",

The 9\u00c5 resolution cryoEM map of the SV E2 presented by Mukhopadhyay et al. [72] was annotated with markers representing locations of glycosylation sites, the protein N-terminus, and a neutralizing Fab binding site. We have adapted their figure to show the probable surface-accessible location of the hMAb F5 nIgG binding site (E2 aa115\u2013119) and its relationship with other markers (Figure 3A,B). Mapping of this epitope to a unique E2 neutralization site was based on the data presented in this study: (1) epitope binding by hMAb F5 nIgG was more sensitive to 0.3% BPL treatment than epitopes recognized by neutralizing mMAbs, (2) hMAb F5 was able to neutralize all anti-VEEV mMAb neutralization escape variant viruses and therefore did not bind to E2 residues 182\u2013207, defined as the \u201ccritical\u201d neutralization domain, and (3) hMAb F5 neutralization escape variant viruses vF5-3 and vF5-5 defined a neutralization epitope involving E2 aa115\u2013119. Results from studies in mice using VEEV E2 synthetic peptides as vaccines have been included in the proposed map of the E2 ectodomain to complement the placement of the hE2c epitope (Figure 3B). Previously, we identified two peptide vaccines, VE2pep01 (E2 aa1\u201325) and VE2pep13 (E2 aa241\u2013265) that protected mice from virulent VEEV challenge [73]\u2013[75]. We also isolated an anti-peptide MAb, 1A2B-10, specific for E2 aa1\u201319, which passively protected mice challenged with VEEV varieties 1AB, 1C, and 1D [76]. None of the anti-peptide antibodies, either polyclonal or monoclonal, had virus-neutralizing activity, indicating that their cognate peptides were not likely to be surface-accessible or lacked the appropriate conformation. The proposed configuration of the E2 molecule shown in Fig. 3B places the hE2c epitope (E2 aa115\u2013119) on the surface of the spike above the more cryptic locations of the E2 N-terminus (VE2pep01) and aa 241\u2013265 (VE2pep13). Such an arrangement would be in agreement with the current knowledge of the structure of the E2 glycoprotein, the location of specific markers, and functional attributes of specified epitopes. We are now in collaboration to obtain structural data on Fab-virion complexes to determine actual binding sites of F5 nIgG and other human and murine MAbs.",
