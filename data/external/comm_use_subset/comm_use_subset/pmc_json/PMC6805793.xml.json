Respiratory viruses are increasingly recognised as a cause of severe ALRI in young children [2]. In many global regions where access to healthcare is limited, especially in rural areas, the true community-based burden of respiratory virus-associated ALRI remains poorly characterised [3\u20135]. In these settings, household surveillance studies can provide a more comprehensive evaluation of viral incidence, transmission and molecular epidemiology patterns in the community [4\u20138].",

Such knowledge may guide the development and implementation of preventative interventions to protect vulnerable groups from ALRI. For example, infants are at highest risk for severe ALRI from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [9]. Major challenges to developing a safe and effective RSV vaccine in young infants have resulted in the development of alternative strategies including maternal RSV vaccination and delayed vaccine administration until >6 months of age [10]. Targeting older groups for vaccination may protect vulnerable populations by interfering in transmission chains to young infants, the elderly and other high-risk groups.",

These results were in agreement with a US study from the 1960s reporting older siblings aged 2\u201316 years as most likely to introduce RSV disease into families [11]. In contrast, modelling suggests that young children <5 years are more likely to transmit RSV and are the most efficient population to vaccinate in order to prevent disease in other groups [12]. Few studies have analysed the transmission of other non-influenza respiratory viruses, such as human metapneumovirus (MPV) and human rhinovirus (HRV), and no studies have examined the household transmission dynamics of respiratory viruses in rural South Asia, a region characterised by high rates of preterm birth and infant mortality [8, 13\u201315].",

The study site is in the low-lying region of rural southern Nepal called the \u2018terai\u2019, with inhabitants broadly representative of the population of India, Bangladesh and Nepal [18]. All women of childbearing age in a part of one district were surveyed for pregnancy. Pregnant women were enrolled in the primary trial as early as possible in pregnancy, generally during the second trimester, and followed until 6 months postpartum. At the time of randomisation, every third study mother and their families were selected to participate in a household surveillance substudy. As randomisation occurred at the time of vaccination, not initial enrolment, randomisation occurred after enrolment and the start of surveillance for some mothers. Surveillance for the first participant enrolled in the household substudy began on 14 April 2011 and we included the households of substudy mothers enrolled prior to 1 May 2012. Surveillance of the household ended 180 days after birth. In this area, many households consist of multiple families living in a single compound; households were defined as a group sharing a single cookstove. Socio-demographic data were collected upon enrolment at the individual and household levels. Birth assessments of study infants were performed shortly following birth. Infants weighed within 72 h of the birth were considered to be low birthweight if the infant weighed <2.5 kg.",

Influenza transmission in household was the primary aim of the trial substudy and is being analysed separately. Bocavirus was not included because of its prolonged shedding patterns. Sequencing was performed for HRV- and RSV-positive samples from household illness clusters utilizing samples with PCR cycle threshold values <33 and 30 for HRV and RSV, respectively, based on previous difficulty sequencing low viral load samples [22, 23]. Briefly, nucleic acid was extracted, and cDNA was synthesised. A hemi-nested PCR protocol was used targeting the 5\u2032 untranslated region and the second hypervariable region of the attachment (G) glycoprotein coding region for HRV and RSV, respectively [22, 23]. Sequences were aligned using MAFFT v7.309, and maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees using the HKY85 model with 100 bootstrap replicates were inferred using PhyML 3.1 within Geneious [24, 25].

Index or transmitting cases were established by identifying the individual(s) with the earliest reported respiratory symptoms prior to a virus-positive swab. We computed the incidence of secondary household illness cases following each initial viral infection. We defined transmission events as observed infections of the same virus in another member of the same household within the subsequent 14 days. The 14-day risk period began on the first day of criteria respiratory symptoms associated with virus-positive specimen collection in the week preceding the virus-positive swab in the index case. Each initial infection and its corresponding risk period comprise a single data point in the regressions and include subsequent infections and time at risk from all household members reporting symptoms over that time period. To assess the risk factors for the incidence of secondary cases of these initial illnesses within households, we used generalised estimating equations, accounting for the potential similarity among repeated initial infections within households. The outcome was the number of secondary cases, with a fixed offset of the log time at risk; a log link was used to estimate the incidence rate ratios (IRRs). Multivariable regression was performed by first including all measures significant in the univariable analysis at P < 0.1 and then performing backward elimination to select a final model. Measures were retained in final multivariable regression if significant at P < 0.05 or if had a substantial impact (\u2a7e10% shift in estimate) on other significant covariates. A single index case type was included in the multivariable model as the index case was coded such that one index case type was compared to all other index cases.",

Households in our study experienced fewer respiratory viral illness episodes than reported in other household studies that included asymptomatic viral detections [5, 7, 15]. In a study of respiratory virus-positive influenza-like illness in households in Vietnam, households experienced 1.6 illness episodes over a 1-year period (including influenza and bocavirus), whereas we found a mean of 1.4 illness episodes per household [8]. Our surveillance sample includes a higher proportion of young children aged 0\u20134 years, including study infants, relative to the overall proportion in the Sarlahi district of Nepal (32.4% vs. 11.3%) and a lower proportion of children aged 5\u201314 years (11.6% vs. 27.9%) [18]. It is possible that the true transmitting cases were absent during the weekly household visit or asymptomatic according to our criteria, though this is less likely for younger children who have median viral shedding duration of longer than 1 week [31]. We likely did not capture the full contribution of older children to transmission compared to the Kenyan cohort. Over half of RSV infections in children 5\u201315 years in that study were asymptomatic, with a smaller proportion of asymptomatic infections in infants under 1 year and children 1\u20134 years at 9% and 17%, respectively [28]. However, they also reported viral shedding in symptomatic RSV infections was 14 log10 RNA copies greater than in asymptomatic RSV cases suggesting that symptomatic episodes are more likely to transmit virus [29]. Last, we collected weekly specimens and our findings may be biased if non-infant younger children had longer shedding duration compared to older children. However, this has not been demonstrated in studies of RSV and HRV shedding duration [28, 30].",

Whereas infants are more likely to transmit RSV via direct contact as compared with fomites, young children may transmit infection efficiently through both methods due to differences in mobility and behaviour [33]. Coinfection as the initial infection was associated with an increased risk of transmission, including in our multivariable model. Coinfections most commonly involved HRV and a greater proportion of coinfections resulted in a secondary case compared to monoinfection of most viruses. Viral coinfection with RSV infection has been demonstrated to increase RSV viral load and shedding duration. However, this has not been consistently seen, including a study analysing seven respiratory viruses [29\n31, 34]. Finally, electricity in the household, a proxy for socio-economic status and housing conditions, was negatively associated with transmission. Although an association between indoor air pollution and RSV infection has been reported in resource-limited regions, smoking and biofuel cookstove use were not associated with the risk for transmission in our model [4]. However, we had limited power to detect this association due to the use of indoor biofuel cookstoves in over 90% of households in our model and exposures were self-reported without actual measures of indoor air pollution.",

Our findings, from a population consisting of crowded households, lower levels of maternal education and fewer children attending school compared to other household transmission studies, suggest that differences in socio-demographic, cultural and environmental contexts influence household transmission risk factors, including the source of household introduction. As we actively surveyed all women of childbearing age for pregnancy, our cohort is generalisable to households with young infants in Southern Nepal, a region representative of rural South Asia [17]. In the Sarlahi district during the study period, an estimated 25% of the population were below the poverty line and approximately 30% of infants were born low birthweight and 20% preterm [26, 27]. Households in our study were crowded with over one-third containing >4 people per room and multiple family units frequently living in a single structure. The average population is young; the median age in the Sarlahi district was 20 years [18]. Eighty-four per cent of households used indoor biofuel cookstoves and half contained latrines. Young demographics, crowded housing conditions and socio-economic factors may influence the patterns of respiratory virus transmission we observed. Transmission may also be affected by the social structures of households and the pattern of migrant labour in this region, where many young men are working outside Nepal, mostly in the Middle East. Twenty per cent of the total Nepalese population were reported as absent from the home, including one-third of 15\u201329 years old and one-fourth of 30\u201334 years old, 90% of whom were male [36].",

For example, there are multiple RSV vaccines targeting diverse populations from infants and children to pregnant women and other adults in various stages of clinical trials [10]. Because the immune systems of neonates generally do not respond well to primary vaccination, immunizing mothers and other household members has been proposed as a method to protect vulnerable young infants from RSV [37]. While a model of Kenya transmission data supports immunizing school-age children to diminish transmission of the virus to infants, our study suggests that in rural South Asia, preschool-age children are more likely to transmit respiratory viruses to other household members [38]. This suggests that a \u2018one-size fits all\u2019 approach to RSV vaccine implementation, or other respiratory viral transmission prevention measures, may not be effective as transmission dynamics may differ across global settings.",

            "text": "Our study has several limitations. Asymptomatic infections were not captured, affecting our ability to fully characterise the transmission chain. We expect that asymptomatic transmission may have impacted our ability to characterise HRV spread, particularly in transmission involving older children and adults, our ability to associate age of index case with transmission risk [30, 39]. Moreover, we likely only captured a minority of adult illness as adults required subjective fever for specimen collection and fever occurs infrequently in adult RSV, MPV and HRV illness [7\n40]. While we underestimated transmission, specifically spread involving individuals \u2a7e5 years, due to our symptom criteria, a previous study of RSV transmission demonstrated that the odds of transmission in symptomatic infection is five times that of asymptomatic infections [28]. This suggests that we likely captured index infections. We anticipate that some illness with shedding <7 days may have been missed due to our weekly surveillance. We expect that this represented a small minority of illness episodes as the estimated shedding duration of HRV and RSV in adults is 10 and 9 days, respectively [30, 31]. Shedding for 1\u20132 weeks is common with paediatric respiratory infections [31]. Moreover, while we performed sequencing on RSV and HRV samples involved in transmission chains, we were not able to phylogenetically verify transmission in the majority of episodes due to high cycle threshold values, and could not use sequencing data to define transmission. Our sequencing results revealed a degree of misclassification with some HRV and RSV transmission events representing illness clusters with multiple virus types circulating in the household simultaneously. This was especially true for HRV, a finding in agreement with previous studies of HRV transmission, including in household and daycare settings [30, 39\n41]. Additionally, some households originally selected for the household substudy were not surveyed as intended. Individuals within selected households who were not surveyed were primarily adults. Among adults, males and those <40 years old were surveyed less frequently, a group not considered high risk for household transmission of respiratory viruses in previous studies. A significant proportion of the Sarlahi population, especially men, are reported as absent from home, supporting the possibility that some household members were absent from the community during the study, although these data were not captured [36]. We also surveyed a higher proportion of preschool children compared to school-aged children. The differential exclusion of these subsets may have affected our results, including identification of index cases, especially if these persons were periodically present in the household. Lastly, we did not collect data on the social mixing patterns of individuals in these households which would have provided valuable information regarding possible causal explanations for our findings.",
