Serum contained thousands of protein species secreted and produced from cells and tissues [12,13], which posses rich information concerning overall pathophysiology of the patient or diseased animal [14].

Apo A-I is also involved in stimulating endothelial cell movement by high density lipoprotein (HDL) which contributes to the migration of endothelial cells into a wound region and recovery of the endothelium [16]. ApoA-I also takes part in inhibiting the synthesis of platelet-activating factor by endothelial cells [17], and protecting erythrocytes against the generation of procoagulant activity [18]. Thrombin is a plasma serine protease that plays a key role in coagulation and hemostasis but also in thromboembolic diseases. Thrombin inhibitor is a potent inhibitor of thrombin and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. It is capable of antagonizing host hemostasis and facilitating blood feeding. Down-regulation of apo A-I and thrombin inhibitor isoform 2 may be involved in disruption of hemostatic balance, resulting in the coagulation and thrombosis seen during acute CSF.

In plasma, it carries the vitamin D sterols and scavenges extracellular G-actin released from necrotic cells, inhibiting the formation of polymeric actin filaments (F-actin) that can trigger disseminated intravascular coagulation and multiorgan failure [23]. VDBP also associates with membrane-bound immunoglobulin on the surface of B-lymphocytes and with IgG Fc receptor on the membranes of T-lymphocytes. VDBP is also implicated in macrophage activation and neutrophil chemotaxis [24]. Gasparri et al. have shown that VDBP reduces platelet aggregation and prolongs coagulation time ex vivo[25]. Downregulation of multifunctional VDBP in CSFV-infected individuals may therefore be implicated in the pathogenesis of CSFV.",

Equal volumes of serum from each infected pig and the control pigs were mixed as an internal standard. Serum samples were labeled with cyanine dyes (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's directions. Briefly, 50 \u03bcg of serum samples were minimally labeled with 400 pmol CyDye following the cross-label rule (Cy2 labeling the internal standard, Cy3 and Cy5 cross labeling infected or control samples). Differentially labeled samples (50 \u03bcg each of Cy2-, Cy3- and Cy5-labeled samples) were mixed and diluted with rehydration buffer (8 M urea, 4% CHAPS, 130 mM DTT, 2% Pharmalyte, pH 3-10 non-linear) to 350 \u03bcl, and loaded onto IPG strips (18 cm; pH 3-10 NL) with active rehydration (30 V for 10 h). Protein components were resolved by first-dimension isoelectric focusing (IEF) conducted at 20\u00b0C in an Ettan IPGphor Isoelectric Focusing System I (GE Healthcare), with the current limited to 50 mA/strip and the following voltage program: 200 V/1 h, 500 V/1 h, 1000 V/1 h, linear ramp to 8000 V over 1 h, then 8000 V constant for a total focusing time of 80 000 Vh.

All strips were subsequently loaded on 12.5% homogeneous SDS polyacrylamide gels and the second-dimensional separation was performed at 20\u00b0C at a constant current of 15 mA/gel for 30 min, then 30 mA/gel until the dye reached the bottom of the gel in the Ettan DALT Six System (GE Healthcare).",

Spots of interest were excised manually and subject to destaining and trypsin digestion according to the protocol described by Wan et al. [28]. After destaining and trypsin digestion of each protein spot, the peptide mixtures were extracted with extraction solution, 50% acetonitrile/0.5% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), at 37\u00b0C for 1 h and lyophilized for further identification by MS. Peptide extracts were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS or Finnigan LTQ MS (ThermoQuest) coupled with a Surveyor HPLC system (ThermoQuest). For MALDI-TOF MS analysis, the peptide powders were re-dissolved in 5 \u03bcl 0.1% TFA. One \u03bcl of supernatant was spotted on anchorChip targets (Bruker Daltonics), and then mixed with 0.5 \u03bcl matrix solution (10 mg/ml \u03b1-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA). After the sample spot drying, the acquisition of the MALDI spectra was performed on a Bruker autoflex (Bruker Daltonics) MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer operated in reflector mode. The spectra were calibrated using a recently described procedure relying on external calibration followed by internal mass correction. Protein identification was performed by searching the NCBInr database [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ 20080410 (6417748 sequences; 2190362656 residues)] using the MASCOT database search engine. Up to one missed cleavage is permitted and 150 ppm peptide mass error tolerance was used for all tryptic-mass searches. Fixed modifications of carbamidomethylation and variable modifications of oxidation were allowed. For LTQ MS, a microcore RP column (C18 150 \u03bcm \u00d7 120 mm; Thermo Hypersil, San Jose, CA, USA) was used to separate the peptide extracts. Mobile phase A (0.1% formic acid in water) and mobile phase B (0.1% formic acid in ACN) were selected. The tryptic peptide mixtures were eluted using 2% solvent B for 15 min, increasing linearly to 98% solvent B for 90 min. The peptides were eluted from the C18 microcapillary column at a flow rate of 150 \u03bcl per min and then electrosprayed directly into a mass spectrometer (spray voltage 3.2 KV) with a capillary temperature of 170\u00b0C. The full scan range was from M/Z 400 to 2000. The data sets obtained in the LC-MS/MS analyses were used for database searches with the SEQUEST search engine (Thermo Electron) against the database of NCBI Suina. A relative molecular mass of 57 Da was added to the average molecular mass of cysteines in MS/MS data searching. Both b ions and y ions were included in the database search. Protein identification results were filtered with Xcorr(1 + \u2265 1.9, 2 + \u2265 2.2, 3 + \u2265 3.75) and DelCn(\u2265 0.1).",
