There are three nonexclusive mechanisms for PMS: (1) heterozygotes may be favored because they can recognize a greater range of antigens than homozygotes (heterozygote advantage); (2) rare alleles may have a selective advantage as few pathogens are adapted to them (frequency-dependent selection); (3) spatial/temporal heterogeneity in the pathogen load and variation may maintain MHC diversity at the global scale (fluctuating selection) [11]. Evaluating the relative roles of natural selection and genetic drift in driving the maintenance or loss of MHC diversity is challenging, and discordant results have been reported. Some studies found similar population structures between MHC and neutral loci, and it was proposed that genetic drift may overwhelm selection in shaping MHC variation, especially in small and bottlenecked populations [1,12,13]. Elevated MHC differentiation across populations has also been reported, supporting the dominant role of fluctuating selection [14,15,16]. Moreover, limited gene flow among populations can promote local adaptation to consistent pathogen communities, and this spatial variation in pathogen selection regimes may also create more structure in MHC genes [8,17,18].

            "text": "Previous studies of MHC variation were mainly focused at the allele level. However, particularly in birds and reptiles, alleles from different MHC loci are sometimes highly similar and even identical to each other because of frequent gene duplication, conversion, and recombination [15,19,20,21], and the gene copy numbers may also vary among individuals [21,22,23,24,25]. These issues all imply that genotypes and variation estimated on the basis of alleles alone would be unreliable and potentially biased [21]. Even when the MHC loci are reliably separated, analysis based on valid genotypes alone, without considering the linkage among loci (which is often strong), may also bias the results [21]. For example, different results were obtained on the basis of MHC linkage groups compared to individual alleles in populations of the Egyptian vulture [26]. Similarly, certain infections in badgers were associated with MHC class II\u2013class I haplotypes rather than allele presence [27]. Levels of individual fitness can be differentiated more profoundly using multilocus haplotypes. Thus, population analysis using multilocus MHC haplotype with consideration of the sharing of alleles, the copy number variation (CNV), and the linkage among loci may provide more comprehensive knowledge and credible evaluation of the adaptive variation and species fitness. Moreover, it is essential to examine both MHC class I and II genes, in recognition of their different functions, although only a few studies do this. To the best of our knowledge, no avian population study has adopted the MHC class I\u2013class II multilocus haplotype as an adaptive marker.",

            "text": "The crested ibis (Nipponia nippon, Pelecaniformes; hereafter referred to as Nini), which is listed as \u201cEndangered\u201d according to IUCN criteria [28], was once believed to be extinct in the wild until a tiny population of seven birds (two breeding pairs and three nestlings) was rediscovered in 1981 at Yangxian, China [29]. Since then, the Chinese government have made great efforts to protect this wild population (in-situ conservation) and have also established several captive populations at different sites (ex-situ conservation) (Figure 1, Table 1). Surprisingly, the total number of crested ibis has now increased from seven to over 2000. However, previous studies using mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite markers on small Nini populations revealed extremely low levels of polymorphism [30,31]. By analyzing the genomes of 57 historic and 8 modern samples, a recent study revealed ancestral loss of genetic variation and high deleterious mutation owing to genetic drift and inbreeding depression in current populations [32]. There have been a growing number of reports regarding various infections [33,34,35,36] and high mortality [29,33] in this bird, indicating frequent threats from pathogens and undetermined fitness. However, there has not yet been any large-scale genetic assessment on Nini populations. It is imperative that such an assessment is completed, preferably by using MHC markers characterized by high polymorphism and fitness relatedness. This could provide insight into the adaptive diversity and differentiation in the recovering populations, thereby better evaluating species fitness and guiding future conservation. Fortunately, the gene architecture of the MHC region has been well illustrated in the crested ibis: ~500 kb MHC region contains five class I genes including one major locus (UAA), three minor loci (UBA, UCA1, and UCA2), and one non-classical locus (UDA), but the UAA locus is located beyond the Class I Region and gathered with the class II genes in the compact Core Region; all these MHC loci were expressed, and different expression levels were found among class I genes [20]. The class II\u03b1 and II\u03b2 genes are alternately organized into one to four elementary \u201c\u03b1\u03b2\u201d units [20,37,38]. Phylogenetic analysis on the four \u201c\u03b1\u03b2\u201d units identified two clusters [20] corresponding to the two reported ancestral avian MHC-II\u03b2 lineages (DAB1 and DAB2) generated by duplication [19]. These results provided a solid foundation for our study. Here, we investigated the variation of all Nini-MHC class I and II genes across seven main populations. We further characterized the MHC haplotypes consisting of all class II genes and the major class I gene in the Core Region, and compared the genetic variation and population differentiation at MHC haplotypes with those expected from microsatellites. We aimed to (1) infer the evolutionary history of the structurally varying MHC haplotypes; (2) determine the relative contribution of genetic drift and selective pressures to MHC loci in the bottlenecked populations; (3) interpret the current population structure and provide corresponding conservation and management strategies.",

[41]. For class I genotyping, given the highly similar introns flanking PBR exons among the five loci [20], we mainly used universal primers and focused on the heteroduplex (HD) banding pattern. An SSCP-HD profile containing the alleles of five class I loci was constructed from the positive bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones stored in our laboratory [20,42], and was verified by profile reconstitution [40]. The profile was supplemented with novel alleles obtained by extracting and cloning new HD bands from genotyping gels (Figure S1a,b). For UBA and UCA2, which involved a single nucleotide substitution on exon 3, we designed locus-specific primers inside exon 3 and performed precise genotyping focusing on single-strand band patterns (Figure S1c,d). Meanwhile, the exon 3 sequences of UCA1*01 and UCA2*01 were identical. Thus, to avoid the interference from UCA1*01, we also utilized a SNP specific for UCA2*01 on intron 1 to differentiate between UCA2*01/*02 and UCA2*02/*02 through sequencing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products. For class II genotyping, the eight genes were classified according to their orthologies [20]: For DAA and DAB, respective locus-specific primers were designed (IIA1e2, IIB1e2) (Figure S1e,f). For DBAs (DBA1, DBA2, and DBA3) and DBBs (DBB1, DBB2, and DBB3), given the extensive sharing of alleles and identical introns flanking exon 2 among genes of each orthology, orthology-specific primers were designed (IIA2e2, IIB2e2) (Figure S1g,h). Primers for genotyping are illustrated in Table S2. To exclude the possibility of amplification failure of potential alleles, representative genotypes (3 samples for each) were collected for each genotyping and amplified by \u22658 additional valid primers designed for different regions, and the PCR products were sequenced and verified. For DAB, an SSCP profile of reference bands was constructed by cloning different genotypes (Figure S1f) [40]. The PCR-SSCP analysis was performed \u22653 times for each primer pair per DNA sample. For cloning and sequencing, we randomly selected \u22655 positive clones per sequence, which were then subjected to Sanger sequencing in both directions by Majorbio (Shanghai, China) using an ABI 3730 automated sequencer. For samples with no PCR product from some primers (putative gene deletion), we extracted DNA twice and designed \u226510 additional sets of primers on both coding (exons 1, 2, 3, and 4) and noncoding (introns 1 and 2) regions to exclude the possibility of poor template quality or PCR failure. All obtained sequences of Nini-MHC PBR exons were deposited in GenBank (accession numbers: MK829161\u2013MK829185).",

Linkage disequilibrium (LD) between polymorphic loci (gametic phase unknown) was tested by Arlequin 3.5 [43]. Individual haplotypes were inferred from genotypes both manually and by multiple programs. We first inferred all potential haplotypes from the individuals with 0\u20131 heterozygous loci (i.e., homozygous at DAB and/or UAA). For individuals with \u22652 heterozygous loci (i.e., heterozygous at both DAB and UAA), most haplotypes were deduced using pedigree information provided by reserves (assuming Mendelian inheritance), and the remainder lacking parentage data were phased according to the most frequent haplotypes in their respective populations. Notably, although the crested ibis is strictly monogamous, captive cages are sometimes occupied by >1 breeding pairs (2\u20133 in most cases), creating the potential for recording false pedigrees. Thus, we verified the pedigrees using microsatellite data, and corrected the paternities of three suspect individuals among candidate parents. Moreover, individual haplotypes were estimated by Haplotype Inference (gametic phase unknown) implemented in Arlequin 3.5 using both Excoffier-Laval-Balding (ELB) and Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms (identical results were obtained), and by PHASE 2.1 using a Bayesian statistical method credited with higher accuracy than the EM algorithm [44]. LD coefficients between linked alleles were further computed based on the estimated haplotypes in Arlequin (gametic phase known). Both intra-population and intra-species (combining population data together) analyses were performed.",

We used two methods to detect historical positive selection on exon 2 of DAB and DBB. As the exons 2 of DBB1 and DBB2 are derived from DBB3 [20], we integrated the three DBB loci as one locus with four alleles (DBB1*01, DBB2*01, DBB2*02, DBB3*01). The selection parameter \u03c9, which estimates the ratio of the nonsynonymous substitution rate (dN) to the synonymous substitution rate (dS), was calculated, and the Z-test with Jukes-Cantor correction was performed in MEGA 6 [48]. Given the limited variation, we input each sequence a number of times equal to its frequency in the primary data. We also used omegaMap 0.5 [49] to detect positive selection under the influence of recombination by simultaneously estimating \u03c9 and the recombination rate \u03c1 along the sequence. Analyses of positive selection were performed using a set of objective priors: \u03c9 and \u03c1 following an inverse distribution (0.02\u2013500); mutation rate (\u00b5; starting from 0.1), transition/transversion rate (\u03ba; starting from 3.0), and deletion rate (\u03c6; starting from 0.1) following an improper inverse distribution. A variable model was used with a block length of 2 codons. Two independent Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains were performed for 1,000,000 iterations with a thinning interval of 100, and the first 10% of iterations were abandoned as a burn-in. The two chains with high convergence were merged to infer the posterior distribution of \u03c9 and \u03c1. Sites with posterior probability \u226595% were deemed to be under positive selection. R code was used to interpret the test output and generate plots. ",

All these regions were genetically dimorphic, except exon 2 which was phylogenetically dimorphic (i.e., two lineages).

            "text": "The Nini-MHC haplotypes are characterized by different copy numbers of II\u03b1\u03b2 units. Evidence for CNVs in MHC class II regions between individuals has been increasingly reported in birds [21,22,23,24,25]. For example, one to two II\u03b1\u03b2 units were found across ten MHC class II haplotypes of the Oriental stork [24]; in quail, five MHC-II\u03b2 haplotypes were flexibly organized with 1\u20137 transcribed II\u03b2 loci [25]. CNV, which emerges faster than other types of mutation, plays a substantial role in generating MHC variation both within and among species [62]. In birds, passerines have strikingly more MHC gene copies than non-passerines. This avian CNV was thought to be correlated with life-history traits (lifespan and migratory behavior) and differences in exposure to pathogens [63]. The evolution of MHC-CNV can be explained by the birth-and-death model that posits that new genes in the multigene family are generated from successive duplication and eventually either maintained or lost [64]. Generally, there are three molecular dynamic mechanisms that may produce CNV: recombination between homologous sequences (unequal crossing over), replication slippage, and retrotransposition [65]. Given the CNV and large-tract intragenic recombination in the MHC class II regions among Nini haplotypes, we inferred an evolutionary model using the unequal crossing over mechanism. The previous study on HT01 proposed that DAA/DAB and DBA3/DBB3 pairs belonging to the two ancestral avian II\u03b1\u03b2 lineages might represent the two primitive Nini-II\u03b1\u03b2 dyads [20]. This speculation is strongly supported by the RDP result, regarding DAB*03 and DBB3*01 on HTs03/07 as the two parental sequences. The other five haplotypes all contain 1\u20132 recombinant II\u03b2 sequences. Accordingly, we strongly suggest that HTs03/07 represent the ancestral Nini haplotypes. Based on the RDP results, we hypothesized that HTs02/06, HTs04/05, and HT01 were successively generated from HTs03/07 through two rounds of unequal crossing over events between DAB and DBB3 (Figure 4b). In addition, the recombination in the \u201cBRD2\u2013DMB2\u201d region further generated three new haplotypes with either allele of UAA. In the studied populations, HT06 and HT07 occupy strikingly lower frequencies than HT02 and HT03, respectively. The only two cases of HT06 (found in LGT and DQ) were recombined from parental HT02. In contrast, most cases of HT07 (found in BJ, SD, and HN) can be traced back to one founder (HT03/HT07) of BJ, born in the wild in 1985. Thus, we suggest an earlier generation and/or higher probability of presence in the initial seven birds for HT07 than HT06. Nevertheless, in view of the higher genetic diversity found in historical samples [32], other unknown MHC haplotypes might have existed prior to the species bottleneck and therefore the haplotype evolution might be more complex than we expected.

            "text": "Despite structural diversity of Nini-MHC haplotypes, most loci were monomorphic. The class II genes showed higher polymorphism than class I genes, and this is thought to be associated with the stronger selection and gene conversion at class II genes (in non-passerines) [9]. Given the low polymorphism of Nini-UAA, the crested ibis is predicted to be at high risk for infections by intracellular pathogens, such as bird flu and Newcastle virus [35], and this deserves great attention in conservation and management. The recent genome-wide study on the crested ibis revealed that the contemporary population has only retained a small amount of the ancestral genetic variation [32]. Concordantly, the historical presence of positive selection on Nini-II\u03b2 genes (as suggested by MEGA and omegaMap) indicated that the ancestral MHC variation should be high [12,66], and therefore the current low polymorphism is probably caused by genetic drift through species bottleneck. Additionally, the genetic drift still has a predominant role over selection in shaping MHC variation within and across the recovering populations. This is strongly supported by the significant correlations in AR values and pairwise G\u2019ST values between MHC and microsatellites, as well as the consistent population structures at MHC and microsatellites in most differentiation analyses. The only exception is that AMOVA supported the differentiation of one more group with MHC than with microsatellites; however, this result was not informative as there was also a pronounced support for an identical grouping between the two markers (Table S8). A previous simulation on bottlenecked populations found that the relative roles of selection and drift in driving MHC diversity depend on the timescales. Initially, selection was not effective in maintaining high polymorphism, but after ~40 post-bottleneck generations, selection overwhelmed the drift and restored variation to pre-bottleneck levels [67]. Nevertheless, high MHC diversity generated by strong selection pressures was reported in bottlenecked fox populations within only ~10\u201320 generations from 10 individuals [68]. Thus, we call for long-term monitoring of the adaptive diversity in Nini populations. With such dramatic loss of MHC variation, average fitness should decline substantially below the pre-bottleneck level, so why did this species successfully thrive within just 38 years? One possibility is that the captive environments under considerable care may serve as a good shelter for this bird, and thus prevent exposure to potential threats such as competitors, predators, and especially the human activities that were considered to be the dominant cause of this species retrogression [32]. Alternatively, the stress from pathogens may be moderate at the present; in this case, the crested ibis is still at risk from catastrophic deterioration caused by novel parasites. Nevertheless, there is little doubt that this bird still maintains a robust reproductive rate. ",

However, this trend appears to be a by-product of strong MHC differentiation between only a few populations. This claim can be strongly supported by the comparisons of pairwise G\u2019ST between two markers (Figure 6). Most outliers with significantly higher MHC-G\u2019ST values were associated with BJ. BJ was highly differentiated at MHC from all the other six populations, and obtained extremely high MHC-G\u2019ST with the four populations from group 1 (as suggested by STRUCTURE). This might be associated with the unusually high frequency of HT03 (60.0%) and low frequency of HT02 (14.3%) in BJ compared to those in other six populations (Table 2). Given the similar habitat and management across captive populations, the partially higher differentiation at MHC might arise from restricted gene flow translated into different adaptations to local pathogen communities (e.g., reference [18]), rather than fluctuating selection under spatial/temporal heterogeneity in pathogen communities. This is consistent with the demographic history of BJ: as the first captive population, it was established in 1986, and has been almost completely isolated for a long time with restricted in-migrants. This could also explain the significantly lower MHC-G\u2019ST than microsatellite-G\u2019ST values for three pairs from group 1 (Figure 6). ",

Its negative impact is associated with the number and genetic makeup of founders, number of generations (time between founding and sampling), gene flow, reproductive variance, etc [69,71,73]. Ex-situ daughter populations of the same origin may evolve divergently under respective founder effects [71,72]. Thus, it is necessary to investigate and interpret the population structure of the crested ibis after 38 years of conservation practices, thereby evaluating and guiding the captive management [74]. By referring to population histories, we found the current population structure (as suggested by STRUCTURE) could be attributed to inconsistent founder effects across populations. (1) YX (sampled at 7\u201316 years since establishment) was the second captive population formed with several wild birds, and continuously received injured or sick individuals and abandoned eggs (i.e., gene flow) from the nearby wild population [29]. After 12 years, YX exported 60 individuals as founders to establish LGT (sampled 4 years later). DQ, as the youngest captive population derived from LGT, was sampled within only two generations. Accordingly, these three populations suffered from a relatively weak founder effect and captured richest genetic variation from Wild. Nevertheless, the sample size of Wild is small and sampling time is early (because only 17 wild individuals existed at sampling and unbiased sampling is difficult after its range expansion). Currently, the wild individuals account for nearly half of the total birds. Thus, it is possible that the wild population has already become genetically differentiated from captive populations, especially given that wild individuals are prone to perform mate choice for MHC dissimilarity [7]. (2) In BJ, despite four birds introduced from SD in 2002, most individuals are descendants of a single breeding pair with high reproductive rate but low MHC dissimilarity (HT03/HT03 and HT03/HT07), and BJ had developed for 25 years prior to sampling. Therefore, its founder effect is expected to be extreme, and this was reflected by its isolation with monomorphic genetic resource. Although YX and BJ both originated from the wild around the same time, their different management histories have led to a great distance between BJ (but not YX) and Wild in the NJ trees. (3) Similar to BJ, most individuals in SD (sampled at 12\u201313 years since establishment) are descendants of two founders from YX. After 8 years of development, 11 descendants were chosen as the main founders of HN. Therefore, the small founder size of group 2 led to its genetic isolation from YX. Notably, the decreasing AR values with establishment of new populations indicate a trend towards continuous genetic drift through the founder effect and inbreeding depression. Accordingly, we call for serious consideration of the anthropogenic founder effect in future conservation management. ",

            "text": "Various markers with different characteristics have been developed for conservation of crested ibis over the past decade. It is important that appropriate markers are chosen for different management issues. The microsatellite markers [30,45] plus the more powerful genome-wide STR markers [75] provide a DNA identification profiling platform, and can be mostly used in demographic management, such as pedigree construction, individual identity and paternity testing. The defensin markers can be applied to improvement of innate immune response among embryos and nestlings [42]. Alternatively, the MHC haplotypes provide a crucial index of individual fitness and population viability. Construction of MHC haplotype profiles, by genotyping DAB and UAA, was recommended for all reserves. This has already been applied in DQ, as an important reference for conservation strategies, such as artificial pairing, individual exchange, and reintroduction. Moreover, new populations should be established from enough founders with maximum MHC dissimilarity. In order to mitigate the founder effect, we call for appropriate individual exchange between captive populations [70,73]. For example, group 1, which contained the only birds with HT01 and an abundance of HTs02/06, should have more genetic connectivity with groups 2/3 which suffer from limited genetic resources and are rich in HTs03/07. Recently, several reserves have successfully reintroduced captive birds into the wild, providing a giant step forward. However, the low level of adaptive diversity implies a survival risk for these birds with exposure to more diverse pathogen faunas but less artificial care. Similar consideration was also proposed based on the genome-wide diversity loss [32]. Thus, it is crucial to persistently monitor their genetic diversity and population structure using MHC haplotypes and neutral markers. ",

HT01, which holds the maximum gene copies including a unique one (DBB1), may be the most immunologically competitive haplotype, whereas HTs04/05 may be most susceptible. Nevertheless, the immunity can be confounded by various factors, especially when gene copies function at different levels. A small-scale analysis on the correlation between Nini-MHC haplotypes and offspring mortality by our laboratory found a potentially higher mortality in HT03/HT04 heterozygotes [79]. However, the offspring might not have died from infections, so further investigation of Nini-MHC haplotype\u2013pathogen relationships should be undertaken for improved conservation.

Loci with limited alleles are not informative and can sometimes produce inaccurate analysis results, especially in the presence of CNV and/or shared alleles. In contrast, the MHC haplotype integrating overall variation may provide a more precise assessment of fitness. Individual MHC genes are often in tight linkage that is undesirable in some analyses [21], hence the use of haplotypes recoded from the linked region was suggested as a valid solution (e.g., STRUCTURE [53]). However, we acknowledge that haplotype inference may be hindered for populations with masses of alleles, and given the extensive repeats and high GC-content in the MHC region, the characterization of CNV and shared alleles among haplotypes using La-PCR may be challenging without any prior MHC genomic information. In view of this, the recently-proposed family-assisted inference of the MHC genetic architecture can be an alternative to achieve accurate haplotyping [21]. Notably, whole-genome sequencing has played a promising role in conservation of endangered species including the crested ibis [32,75]. Various estimates can be obtained based on the genome-wide SNPs, including overall genetic diversity, deleterious mutations, phylogenetic relationships, and even population structure [32]. The noncoding SNPs were also considered as suitable neutral markers in MHC variation analysis owing to their similar mutation mechanism [4]. Nevertheless, the assembly of the complicated MHC region remains a challenge for next-generation genome sequencing methods [20,24,37], particularly in non-galliformes, therefore limiting in-depth research on this region.",
