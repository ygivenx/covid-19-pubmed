The typical clinical symptoms of BEF are characterized by the rapid onset and rapid recovery of clinical signs, such as fever, depression, muscle stiffness, oral and nasal discharges, joint pain and lamenes [1\u20133].The disease is more frequently distributed in a vast expanse of the world including tropical, subtropical and temperate regions of Africa, the Middle East, Australia and Asia, and leads to serious economic losses to the cattle industry through loss of milk production, significant impacts on trade [4\u20136]. To date, no specific treatment and drug is available for BEFV.",

The protein G consists of five major neutralisation sites (G1,G2,G3a,G3b,G4) defined by BEFV G protein specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) in competition ELISAs, and among these sites, site G1 composed of two minimal B cell epitopes is a linear neutralisation site involving in eliciting neutralizing antibodies. It is reported that site G1 is predicted to face the viral membrane in both the pre-fusion and post-fusion forms of the trimer and may be approachable to antibodies [13\u201315].

In virology, several peptides have been identified as potential antivirals against classical swine fever virus [25], transmissible gastroenteritis virus [26], influenza virus [27], newcastle disease virus [28], human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [29] and hepatitis B virus [30] using phage display technology.

As the phages bearing the specific affinity peptides to BEFV G1 protein, they have the potential to develop a phage-mediated diagnostic assay to BEFV. It is reported that the BEFV G1 protein located at the C-terminal stalk of the G protein is one target of virus-neutralizing antibodies, and G1 protein is a linear neutralization site (Y487-K503) that comprises two minimal B cell epitopes [5, 11].The potential significant achievement of our work is the discovery of mimic antibodies, synthetic peptide in vitro could be used as a specific antibody mimic to detect BEFV in virus-infected cells.",

Interestingly, the phage clone T18 and T25 exhibited binding affinity to G1 protein and antiviral activity against BEFV (Fig. 3), whereas other phages with high affinity to G1 protein did not effectively inhibit the replication of BEFV. This means that the binding affinity of other phages do not necessarily connection with antiviral activity. In addition, a possible explanation of antiviral activity is that the G1 protein binding phage ligand mediates an inhibitory effect of BEFV infection by competitive binding to receptor binding sites or neutralizing epitopes and thus inhibits the virus attachment/entry. In order to exclude the effect of phage itself on protein binding and antiviral activity against BEFV, we synthesized T18 and T25 peptides in vitro and conducted the reduce plaque assay in vero cells that significantly formed cytopathic plaque during BEFV infection. The results showed that the synthetic peptides could significantly inhibit the formation of cytopathic plaque(Fig. 4) and inhibit BEFV replication in a dose dependent way (Fig. 5). Altogether, T18 and T25 peptides are potentially potent antiviral molecules worthy of further development and test. This study provides an inexpensive way to discover functional motif for BEFV infection using the phage-display technology, which is possible to find the potential protein to mediate the interaction between BEFV and the host.",
