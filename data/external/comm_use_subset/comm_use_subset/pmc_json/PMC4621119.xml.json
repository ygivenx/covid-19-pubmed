            "text": "Many viruses inhibit host macromolecular synthesis to suppress cellular antiviral responses or reduce competition from synthesis of host products (1). Viruses also manipulate host autophagic pathways (2), induce and suppress apoptosis (3), and usurp DNA repair pathways (4). The host cell cycle is also modulated by virus infection and can be stimulated or suppressed, depending on the virus (5). Small DNA viruses, including papillomaviruses and adenoviruses, modulate the host G1/S-phase transition to stimulate cell cycle-regulated transcription and/or S-phase DNA synthesis and thus support virus genome replication (5\u20137). On the other hand, large DNA viruses such as the herpesviruses encode their own DNA synthetic apparatus and enzymes for nucleotide production. In the case of herpes simplex virus (HSV), in addition to seven essential replication proteins (8\u201314), other viral and host proteins localize to segregated replication compartments to promote origin-specific virus DNA replication (see review in reference 15). Moreover, HSV generally suppresses host cell DNA synthesis or blocks the transition from G1 to S phase (12) and is thought to interfere with the cell cycle at several distinct phases (16\u201319; reviewed in reference 20).",

Generally, virus manipulation of the intracellular environment is effected either by early events associated with attachment to the host cell, by structural components of the infecting virus, or by de novo-expressed virus products. Apart from the well-known processes of paracrine/juxtacrine signaling to uninfected cells in antiviral responses, the prospect that additional modulation of other types of cellular metabolic processes occurs by paracrine signaling to uninfected cells has significant implications for our general understanding of virus-host interactions and the events which impinge on the outcome of infection.",

Here, we use such techniques to study the spatiotemporal distribution of virus and host cell DNA synthesis when infection is initiated in a single cell and followed by progressive transmission to neighboring cells. We show that while HSV disrupts host cell DNA synthesis and promotes virus DNA synthesis in the infected cell itself, it also induces paracrine signaling on control of host cell DNA synthesis in distant uninfected cells, resulting in a propagating wave of DNA synthesis in advance of virus infection. The results are relevant not only for HSV and potentially for viruses in general; they reveal differences in host cell processes when studied in progressive transmission models versus single-step growth cycles and could also indicate that similar events occur in other aspects of cellular metabolism, e.g., transcription and protein synthesis.",

Rabbit skin cells (RSC) were grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin-streptomycin.

Other strains included HSV-1[KOS] and HSV-1[KOS].VP1-2\u0394NLS, which lacks the core nuclear localization signal (NLS) of VP1-2 as previously described (27). Routine plaque assays were performed in the presence of pooled neutralizing human serum (Sigma) at 2% or clinical-grade purified neutralizing human immunoglobulin (IVIg; Carimune NF, nanofiltered, human immune globulin; CSL Behring) at 2 mg/ml, having demonstrated complete neutralization of extracellular virus at this dose (>6-log reduction in virus titer). High-multiplicity infections were performed at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 or 10.

There was a modest effect of EdU on both cell growth and virus yield but virtually no effect of EdC on plaque numbers and plaque size in multicycle analysis or virus yield in single-step analysis. We optimized protocols for nucleoside incorporation, click chemistry, and fluorescence detection as follows. Cells on coverslips were mock infected or infected with HSV by normal procedures (MOI, 10) and incubated in DMEM-2% NCS. At the times indicated, EdC was added at a final concentration of 5 \u03bcM for a standard labeling time of 4 h unless otherwise stated. The cells were then washed in cold PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, quenched with glycine (0.3 M) or ammonium chloride (25 mM), and permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 5 min. For localization of specific antigens, an immunofluorescence assay with primary and secondary antibodies was carried out as described above. The samples were blocked in 10% calf serum and then subjected to click reaction in a buffer prepared freshly in each case (premixed for 2 min) and containing 10 \u03bcM Alexa Fluor 488-azide (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mM CuSO4, 10 mM sodium ascorbate, 10 mM aminoguanidine, and 1 mM tris(3-hydroxypropyltriazolylmethyl)amine (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS, pH 7.4. The reaction was then allowed to proceed by incubation at room temperature in the dark for 90 to 120 min. After washing in PBS, the cells were counterstained with DAPI (Sigma) and coverslips were mounted in Mowiol supplemented with 2.5% DABCO. Images were taken as described above. For quantitation, total cell numbers were enumerated from the nuclear DAPI staining in one channel and EdC-positive cells were enumerated from nuclear staining (above background set in the absence of EdC). Images were quantitated manually (for total numbers and EdC-positive numbers) from the images or, for more quantitative assessment, using the thresholding and segmentation modules of Image Pro Plus. In this workflow, areas of individual objects (nuclei) are defined from the DAPI staining and then total intensity above background is reported in the corresponding object area for EdC incorporation. For the data in Fig. 7, the range of counts for EdC intensity from minimum to maximum was binned and the numbers of cells in each bin were then returned. For these analyses, numerous independent fields and hundreds or thousands of cells were quantified.",

We also found no significant effect of EdC on cell replication at doses required for detection of DNA synthesis (Fig. 1A), no effect on virus yields from single-step growth curves, nor any effect even over 2 to 3 days on virus plaque numbers or size (Fig. 1B to D). Further experiments were therefore performed with EdC labeling. The majority of experiments were performed in human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells unless otherwise stated. Experiments confirming observations (see below) were also performed in Vero cells and rabbit skin cells (RSC).",

Qualitatively, the pattern of EdC incorporation was similar to that previously reported (23, 29), showing one of a few patterns proposed to reflect the approximate stage within S phase (Fig. 2A and B). An example showing total DNA staining (DAPI) and EdC incorporation is shown in Fig. 2B. In contrast, in HSV-infected cells (multiplicity of infection, 10), virtually every cell was positive for EdC incorporation by 8 h after infection (Fig. 2A, HSV). The percentage of EdC-positive cells in several hundred cells is summarized in Fig. 2C, showing ongoing DNA synthesis in virtually every infected cell, compared to the approximately 30% observed in uninfected cells. Moreover, the pattern of incorporation in infected cells was qualitatively distinct from that seen in uninfected cells. An example is shown in Fig. 2D, showing total cell nuclei (DAPI), ICP8 localization, and EdC incorporation in the same field. The results show the previously documented features of HSV DNA replication compartments (12, 32, 33), including EdC colocalization with the DNA replication protein ICP8 and exclusion from DAPI-dense areas of cellular DNA and areas adjacent to the nuclear rim where cellular DNA is marginated (Fig. 2B and D, inset cell marked with arrow). These features are also clearly observed in the higher-magnification image (Fig. 2E).",

The results demonstrate that early after such infection (within 6 to 8 h), individual infected cells could be identified by the presence of ICP8 (Fig. 3A, ICP8, arrow), surrounded by uninfected cells. The localization of EdC in such single infected cells was qualitatively distinct. A single focus of EdC incorporation within the nucleus was seen, usually at the periphery, combined with substantially reduced incorporation in the remainder of the nucleus (Fig. 3A, EdC, arrow, and DAPI/EdC, inset; see also single-focus inset in Fig. 7). Such a pattern was observed only in ICP8-positive (ICP8+ve) cells and, consistent with previous data from high-multiplicity experiments (12), represents a progressing virus DNA replication compartment, in this case emanating from a single genome beginning to replicate. The general reduction in EdC incorporation, outside the focus of the developing virus replication compartment itself, is consistent with previous data showing that HSV infection blocks cellular G1-to-S-phase progression in infected cells (12). However, while our initial intention was to study spatial aspects of DNA synthesis in cells that had been initially infected by only a single particle, observations made during the course of these experiments directed the focus of our investigation to other processes, which are the subject of the remainder of this work.",

Thus, significantly higher levels of DNA synthesis were routinely observed in uninfected cells surrounding the single initially infected ICP8+ve cells than were observed in more distant cells or in uninfected cells (more clearly seen in the lower-magnification view of a typical experiment [Fig. 3B, ICP8, arrow]). This gradient of DNA synthesis could be seen as early as 8 h after single-particle infections. We repeated these experiments, pulse-labeling with EdC at a later time (20 to 24 h) when infection progressed to numerous cells (Fig. 4A). The results show a pronounced zone of cells, surrounding the ICP8+ve infected cell boundary, in which elevated levels of DNA synthesis were observed with a gradient extending to distant cells. While levels of ongoing DNA synthesis were significantly increased in this zone, the percentage of cells synthesizing DNA remained similar to or only marginally increased over that seen in uninfected cell monolayers. This result was obtained independently of the virus antigen used to detect the central infected cells and in several cell types, including RSC and Vero cells (see Fig. S1A in the supplemental material).",

We wished to address the duration of this mechanism using a combined pulse-chase-pulse regime (Fig. 6A). After single-particle infection, cells were pulsed with EdC at 20 h, washed and incubated for a further 20 h to allow virus progression, and then pulsed again with EdC and analyzed. We anticipated that if induction of DNA synthesis was maintained, we should see a second external zone of elevated DNA synthesis surrounding the infected cells. As shown in Fig. 6A, this is exactly what was observed. (The various zones defined below are labeled only on the EdC panel for ease of inspection.) Over the course of 44 h, the center of the plaque showed more extensive cytopathic effect (focus center) and was lost during processing, but the remaining cells from the first zone of elevated DNA synthesis (zone 1) could be seen, now with infected cells (ICP8+ve) extending beyond. Some of the remaining cells in this initial zone 1 could be seen labeled for both cell DNA synthesis and ICP8 (EdC/ICP8 merged panel). Extending beyond this (zone 2) are the infected cells now chased in the absence of EdC, i.e., ICP8+ve but with little EdC. The cells at the periphery of zone 2 show weak EdC labeling representing viral DNA synthesis during the second pulse-labeling period. However, at the extended border beyond zone 2 (beyond the zone of infection marked by ICP8), we now again see elevated DNA synthesis in numerous uninfected cells (zone 3), with a gradient extending to the more distant uninfected cells. Thus, at least for up to 2 days, during multiple rounds of infection there is a continuous wave of induction of cellular DNA synthesis in uninfected cells in advance of the progressing infection.",

These results indicated that stimulation of DNA synthesis required neither infection nor virus gene expression in activated cells. Nevertheless, it remained possible, though unlikely, that events associated with infection could be involved. To rule this out, we examined single-particle infection with a virus incapable of spreading to surrounding cells (27). This virus, HSV-1.VP1-2\u0394NLS, when produced on complementing cells, can infect a cell and make particles, but these particles do not productively infect surrounding cells due to a defect in capsid transport (27). Typical results are shown in Fig. 6B, where a single mutant virus-infected cell is detected expressing ICP8. In this infected cell, the single initiating virus replication compartment can be observed (Fig. 6B, EdC, arrow and inset). This cell is surrounded by cells exhibiting elevated DNA synthesis, with a gradient extending to more distant cells with no virus gene expression and which will not be infected. Since this mutant produces particles, albeit ones unable to productively infect cells, we repeated this regime with another disabled virus, HSV-1\u0394VP1-2.VP26.GFP, in which the VP1-2 gene is deleted and which does not assemble or release infectious particles (34), with similar results (see Fig. S1C in the supplemental material). Together, these data provide strong evidence that the stimulation of DNA synthesis results from a paracrine effect, signaled by infected cells to surrounding uninfected cells.",

Cells grown in an insert containing a membrane with 20-nm pores were infected or mock infected (i.e., donor cells) and incubated with the recipient test cells in the lower chamber (Fig. 7A). Approximately 20 h after infection, the inserts were removed and the test cells were pulse-labeled with EdC. The results (Fig. 7B) demonstrate a significant increase in test cell DNA synthesis when exposed to HSV-infected donor medium compared to uninfected cell donor medium. This increase also showed a dose response in relation to the numbers of initially infected cells in the donor cell population (cf. test cell DNA synthesis levels when donor cells were infected at MOIs of 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1). The results were quantified and expressed in numerous test cells, binned into ranges, and plotted for mock-infected or HSV-infected donor cells (Fig. 7C). The results show a substantial increase in EdC incorporation in test cells exposed to donor medium from infected cells. This result cannot be explained by virus infection per se in the lower test chamber. First, infection would yield a focus of increased DNA synthesis emanating from an infected cell. This was not observed. Second, HSV will not pass through a 20-nm-pore membrane. Third, the cultures were incubated in the presence of neutralizing antibody. Finally, no virus-infected cells were detected in the test monolayer. Taken all together, our results indicate that, for induction of host DNA synthesis during progressive rounds of infection, the activated cells do not need to be in contact with infected cells and that a paracrine mechanism operates whereby signal(s), even from a single infected cell, promotes elevated DNA synthesis in surrounding uninfected cells.",

In the context of the infected cell itself, our results are in agreement with these observations.

We have attempted to show, e.g., by increased plaque numbers or faster spread, that conditioned medium promotes more efficient infection but have not observed a significant increase in these parameters. It is possible that such an outcome may be demonstrated only under suboptimal conditions, e.g., with debilitated or poorly replicating viral mutants, where the efficiency of initiation of infection or the kinetics of spread may reveal an augmented outcome. It is also possible that any effect may not be readily demonstrable in the otherwise very permissive system of tissue culture infection by HSV. It may be that the physiological relevance of this paracrine effect is reflected more in the situation of initial infection in vivo or of reactivation in neuronal cells which are not normally transiting through S phase or surrounding supporting cells in the three-dimensional environment. Ultimately, investigation of the influence on the outcome of infection will require knowledge of the virus and/or host components involved in order to interfere with the pathway and explore the consequences. We note also that notwithstanding HSV repression of S-phase progression, many lines of evidence indicate a positive association between the cell cycle/cellular DNA synthesis and the outcome of herpesvirus replication. For example, cell cycle-dependent kinases are known to be required for replication of several herpesviruses, including HSV and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) (35, 36); HCMV manipulates quiescent cells, producing a pseudo-S-phase environment to support viral replication (37, 38); and certain viral proteins from Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can actively stimulate E2F-responsive transcription and S-phase progression (39).",

Whether this is a conventional type of growth factor and whether it is secreted as an individual component or, e.g., as some form of vesicle such as an exosome await further mechanistic and biochemical studies. In terms of the processes within an infected cell itself to elicit the response in uninfected cells, preliminary data from assays in which single-particle infection was carried out in the presence of PAA, added from the time of infection, did not show infection to result in zones of elevated DNA synthesis surrounding the single infected cell.

It is possible that these processes are linked and that the stimulation in DNA synthesis observed here is integrated with other responses in vivo. Nonetheless, by quantitatively evaluating the percentage of S-phase cells in the zones exhibiting increased synthesis compared to total cell numbers in the zones (data not shown), we find little alteration from the percentage of S-phase cells in the uninfected cell population. The results may indicate that the process is not one advancing the G1-to-S onset or duration but rather one influencing the overall abundance of DNA synthesis in the cell. Such a mechanism might involve an increase in the efficiency of origin firing or in the suppression of certain cell cycle controls limiting DNA replication. It is noteworthy that adenovirus infection, which stimulates S-phase DNA synthesis, has been suggested to involve uncontrolled firing of DNA replication origins by suppressing cyclin A and geminin, which otherwise suppress genome rereplication (5, 41). It is possible, therefore, that stimulation represents a perturbation of cell control mechanisms, e.g., in timing of origin firing or rereplication, rather than a stimulation of normal DNA synthesis.
