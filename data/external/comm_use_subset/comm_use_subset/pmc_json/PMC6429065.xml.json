            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is the most economically important infectious disease for the swine industry worldwide. PRRS is characterized by reproductive failure in sows and respiratory disease in pigs of all ages [1,2]. The annual loss associated with PRRS is approximately 664 million USD, as estimated by swine producers in the United States [3]. PRRS virus (PRRSV) is a member of the Arteriviridae virus family in the order Nidovirales, along with equine arteritis virus (EAV), murine lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV), and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) [4,5]. PRRSV is a small, enveloped virus with a single-stranded, nonsegmented, positive-sense RNA genome that is approximately 15 kb in length [5,6]. The genome of PRRSV encodes at least ten open reading frames (ORFs) called ORF1a, ORF1b, ORF2a, ORF2b, ORF3, ORF4, ORF5a, ORF5, ORF6, and ORF7 [7,8]. PRRSVs used to be grouped into European (type 1) and North American (type 2) genotypes, but currently classified as two species, betaarterivirus suid 1 and betaarterivirus suid 2, respectively. There is substantial genetic and antigenic variation among PRRSV strains, even within the same virus species [9,10]. Since the first emergence of PRRS more than two decades ago, numerous efforts have been made to develop an effective control measure for this challenging disease. Currently, vaccination is the primary control method, and is widely used to control PRRS in pigs. However, the use of commercial vaccines with either modified live virus (MLV) or killed virus is inadequate to control PRRSV infection [11] because of the highly divergent PRRSV strains in the field. Antiviral therapeutics could be an alternative or additional control measure to combat these viral infections when a successful vaccine that matches the circulating virus is not available. Therefore, pharmacological intervention might be a suitable and useful control strategy for PRRS. Many previous studies reported that a variety of natural compounds had been proven to exert antiviral activity against a number of viruses, such as equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) [12], hepatitis B virus [13], human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) [14], and respiratory infections including the common cold [15] and PRRSV [16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29]. However, no such effective drugs are commercially available to prevent PRRSV infection. Chalcones (1,3-diaryl-2-propen-1-ones), which constitute a key class of natural products belonging to the Flavonoid family [30,31,32,33], were previously reported to have a wide range of biological activities, such as antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, insect antifeedant, and antimutagenic activities [31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38]. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the antiviral effects of DiNap [(E)-1-(2-hydroxy-4,6-dimethoxyphenyl)-3-(naphthalen-1-yl)prop-2-en-1-one], a synthetic analog of the chalcone flavokawain, on PRRSV replication in cell culture systems. A study was then carried out in a pig model to demonstrate the inhibitory effects of DiNap on PRRSV infection.",

DiNap, a synthetic analog of the chalcone flavokawain, was evaluated in this study for its potential antiviral activity against PRRSV infection in cell culture systems and in a pig model. Chemically, DiNap is a synthetic analog of flavokawain, containing a chalcone scaffold of 1,3-diaryl-2-propen-1-one. DiNap has a 2-hydroxy-4,6-dimethoxybenzene moiety at the C1 position of 2-propene-1-one, which is a common structural feature of the naturally occurring compounds flavokawain A, B, and C. DiNap also contains a naphthalenyl moiety at the C3 position of 2-propene-1-one, which has been found in several antiviral agents [41,42]. In addition, chalcones, the main pharmacophore of DiNap, have been reported to show a wide spectrum of biological activities, including antiviral [43], antioxidative [44], and anti-inflammatory activities [45]. These previous studies are further supported by the results presented in the current study. DiNap effectively suppressed VR2332 replication in MARC-145 cells and PAMs at concentrations ranging from 0.02 to 0.06 mM, without showing significant cytotoxicity, even at up to 48 hpt. It is worth noting that the highest concentration of DiNap (0.06 mM) used in this study completely suppressed VR2332 replication in both cell lines (Figure 1). Although approximately 20% cell death was observed when DiNap was added at 0.06 mM, no significant side effects or toxicity were observed after treatment in pigs.",

Compared to the pigs in the untreated control group (group 1), the pigs treated with DiNap in group 2 and group 3 had reduced viral loads in the serum and lungs and increased weight gain (Figure 2, Figure 4 and Figure 6). Consistent with these findings, the pigs treated with DiNap also had fewer lesions (gross and microscopic) in their lungs than the control pigs (Figure 5), suggesting that DiNap exerted significant effects on PRRSV infection. More importantly, two injections of DiNap were able to delay virus transmission by approximately 1 week with direct contact between the infected (virus challenged) and uninfected (not virus challenged) pigs in both treatment groups (groups 2 and 3). However, the virus was easily transmitted between the infected and uninfected pigs in the untreated control group (group 1), indicating that DiNap could be useful as a prophylactic or postexposure treatment agent in cases of PRRSV infection. Because DiNap was produced in limited quantities on a laboratory scale, the antiviral effect of DiNap was only preliminarily evaluated with a small number of pigs in the current study. Therefore, more detailed animal experiments are needed to determine how long the antiviral effect of DiNap lasts in the future.",

The viral loads in the serum and tissues were quantified by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) using a TaqMan\u00ae assay based on a previous study [58]. The primer and probe sequences were as follows: forward primer TGTCAGATTCAGGGAGRATAAGTTAC; probe 6-FAM TGTGGAGTTYAGTYTGCC; and reverse primer ATCARGCGCACAGTRTGATGC. A one-step quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) kit (AgPath-ID\u2122 One-Step RT-PCR, Ambion, Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies, Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used to measure the viral loads in the serum and lung tissues. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification was performed with a 7500 Fast Real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s guidelines. One-step qRT-PCR was performed in a total of 25 \u00b5L containing 5 \u00b5L of template RNA, 12.5 \u00b5L of 2\u00d7 RT-PCR buffer, 0.5 \u00b5L of each forward and reverse primer (20 pmol, at a final concentration of 0.8 pmol), 0.2 \u00b5L of the TaqMan\u00ae probes (25 pmol, at a final concentration of 1 pmol), 0.5 \u00b5L of RNAse inhibitor (40 U/\u00b5L; RiboLockTM, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Germany), 1 \u00b5L of 25X RT-PCR enzyme mix, and 4.8 \u00b5L of nuclease-free water. The cycling conditions were as follows: (a) Reverse transcription for 10 min at 45 \u00b0C; (b) a 10-min activation step at 95 \u00b0C; and (c) 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 \u00b0C and 45 s at 60 \u00b0C. Samples with a threshold cycle (Ct) of 35 cycles or fewer were considered positive. A standard curve was generated from known virus titers and used to calculate the amount of PRRSV in each sample by converting the Ct value to the TCID50/mL equivalent.",
