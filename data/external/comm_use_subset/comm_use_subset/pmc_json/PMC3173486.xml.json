The introduction of IAV of the H1N1, H2N2 and H3N2 subtypes have caused pandemics in 1918, 1957 and 1968 respectively. More recently, H1N1 viruses of swine origin caused the first pandemic of the 21st century, which started in Mexico in March 2009 [1], [2]. The virus spread rapidly over all continents and caused disease especially in children and young adults [3].",

Especially individuals with high risk to develop complications of IAV infection benefit from vaccination, like the elderly, patients with chronic diseases and immunocompromised individuals. In addition, vaccination could help to mitigate the impact of a pandemic outbreak. However, there are three scenarios in which vaccination cannot be used effectively. First, certain high risk group respond to vaccination poorly like the frail elderly and certain immunocompromised subjects. Secondly, in case of antigenic mis-match, the vaccine may induce antibodies that fail to neutralize the epidemic strains optimally and therefore do not afford protection against theses drift variants [6], [7]. Finally, in case of a pandemic the vaccines may become available too late as was the case during the 2009 pandemic [2].",

For example, seasonal H3N2 IAV resistant to amantadine emerged in 2000 in Asia and is the predominant strain ever since [11]. Furthermore, 15.5% of the H1N1 viruses were resistant to adamantanes in 2005\u20132006 worldwide. In addition, most of the seasonal H1N1 viruses isolated in the influenza season 2008\u20132009 were resistant to oseltamivir [11], [12], [13]. Also during the treatment of especially immunocompromised patients, which shed virus for extensive periods, the emergence of resistant strains can be a complication.",

These collagenous C-type lectins are mainly produced by Clara cells and type II pneumocytes. They can neutralize a variety of respiratory pathogens including bacteria and viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, adenoviruses, SARS coronavirus and IAV (for review see [14], [15]). Collectins can bind glycoconjugates expressed on the surface of these pathogens via their carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs).",

Unlike its human counterpart, it contains an extra cysteine in the collagen domain, it is N-glycosylated with a sialic acid-rich oligosaccharide in the CRD and there is a potentially important extra loop region (SGA) present in the CRD which could play a role in the sugar-binding properties of pSP-D [19].

First, the biochemical properties of RpSP-D were characterized in detail and compared with NpSP-D and it was shown that RpSP-D is structurally and functionally identical to NpSP-D (van Eijk et al., manuscript in preparation). In this study, we focused on the antiviral properties of RpSP-D and compared its IAV-neutralizing activity with that of NpSP-D isolated from pig lungs in the HI assay against a broad panel of IAV strains.

It has been shown previously that inhibition of the enzymatic activity of NA successfully inhibited virus replication and viral spread and a class of existing antiviral drugs is based on this principle. To investigate whether IAV NA, which is also glycosylated, can be inhibited by RpSP-D, we used, in contrast to other studies [33], [35], recombinant NA molecules to exclude the interference of the enzymatic activity by binding of RpSP-D to HA. Although the enzymatic activity was inhibited to a certain extent, relatively high RpSP-D doses were required to achieve this. We therefore conclude that binding of RpSP-D to the viral HA most likely is a more potent mode of antiviral action than binding to NA. Of note, the reduction of infection of MDCK cells that was observed correlated with the inhibition of the hemagglutination activity of IAV. This provides additional evidence that HA is the primary target of RpSP-D. The interaction of RpSP-D with the viral HA, prevents the attachment of the virus to target cells and is at the basis of the neutralizing effect of RpSP-D. Indeed, we demonstrated that RpSP-D is able of binding HA of influenza A viruses of the H1N1 and H3N2 subtype (Figure 4).",
