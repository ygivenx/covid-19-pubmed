In the early phases of the epidemic, with limited information on the number of infections, policy makers tried to mitigate disease spread as best they could. Mathematical modeling of infectious disease has made increasing contributions to public health decisions [2] [3] [4] with the aim of estimating the basic reproduction number, R0 [5]. R0 is defined as the number of secondary cases generated by one infectious individual during his/her entire infection period in a totally susceptible population [6]. When R0 is greater than one, there is a likelihood that the infection will to continue to spread; however if R0 is less than one, then the infection will eventually die out. For this reason, estimating the basic reproduction number is paramount for assessing the effectiveness of different intervention strategies.",

            "text": "Most classical mathematical models of infectious disease transmission, also known as compartmental models, assume homogeneous mixing among individuals. In other words, each individual has an equal chance of infecting others in a population. However, the estimates of R0 from models with this parsimonious assumption may differ greatly from models featuring heterogeneous contacts patterns, resulting in different epidemiological outcomes under the same intervention policies [7]. Studies have suggested that many infectious diseases exhibit heterogeneity in transmission efficiency in certain individuals (for example \u201csuper-spreaders\u201d in SARS (2003)), or in specific groups of individuals that appear to account for most of the transmission (such as school age children in H1N1 influenza A (2009)) [8] [9]. To ensure that this heterogeneity is modeled, contact network models are used to explicitly capture patterns of disease transmission. Contact network models can also be used to compare the intervention strategies for different infectious diseases when epidemiological data are limited, as was the case with SARS in 2003 and H1N1 pandemic influenza virus in 2009 [5] [7].",

Our approach will specifically take into account different levels of inter- and intra-age group heterogeneity. We also validate our analytical method using simulation data.

The contact patterns can vary between individuals in the population. We assume that there are N individuals in the population. Each individual is represented as a vertex, and an edge represents a pathway of possible infection transmission between two individuals. The number of contacts that an individual has is denoted by k., Also, the probability that a randomly chosen vertex has k contacts (k degrees) is denoted p\nk. Useful information can be derived from the distribution of number of contacts, known as the degree distribution. For instance, the first moment of degree distribution is the average number of nearest neighbours to a randomly selected individual z\n1, and the second moment is related to z\n2, the number of second-degree neighbours (i.e., neighbours of neighbours) of a randomly chosen individual. The excess degree z is defined as the number of edges emanating from an infected individual, excluding the edge that was the source of the focal infection; it is simply the ratio z2z1 [10].",

From the start of May in 2009, patients who were admitted to public hospitals with acute respiratory illness were tested by (RT)-PCR.

The rest of the 60 subjects provided a range in the number of close contacts they had experienced, and we defined their number of close contacts as the mid-point of this range.

The incidence data for children has a minor peak at the early stage of the epidemic between June and July. In real time, at the time when the minor peak formed, and without prior knowledge of how the epidemic would unfold afterwards, this anomaly might have been interpreted as a stand-alone peak, with an inclining segment between June 1 and 21 and a declining segment between June 21 and July 1 as shown in the inset figure in Fig 3. Interestingly, using the inclining segment with model B, the estimate of R0 converges very quickly to 1.2 in early June (black line in Fig 3). Since the declining segment destabilizes the early-stage R0 estimator, the estimate after the minor peak fluctuates for a while until the epidemic curve begins to increase monotonically in July, when the estimator converges again to 1.12 between day 82 and day 102. The estimate of R0 under model A converges to 1.21 in late August (Day 115), which is slightly higher than the estimate from model B. Estimates under both model A and B are similar to the estimate of the effective reproduction number between 1.1 and 1.2 that was proposed in summer of 2009 by [18]. The number of cases required for model B to converge to estimate R0 of 1.2 and 1.12 up to Day 30 and 82 are 66 and ~2200, respectively, which are about 5 to 10% of the total number of laboratory confirmed cases in the whole epidemic. Using the excess degree of children and adults, the age specific R0 can be estimated for both children and adults. We showed that R0 for children is higher than that for adults (1.28 versus 1.08), which is consistent with other studies (see [19]). This implies that school-aged children likely contributed more infections than adults.",

By explicitly taking in account the age structure of a population, this study improves on a network-based formalism that was introduced previously for a non-age-stratified population in [11]. Our proposed age-structured model (model B) provides a reliable estimate of R0 in the early stage of an epidemic, even in the presence of noise or dominant stochastic fluctuations and potentially biased numbers of newly reported cases during the early stochastic regime. Using the simulated data, our analytical justification shows that network structures featuring inter-age group contact heterogeneity helps us provide an ongoing estimate of R0 before the epidemic reaches the exponential growth as in Fig 1. Even for the real data, our proposed model B can still provide estimates of R0 in the early stage of epidemics as of Day 30. Although the first peak deviates from the estimate of R0, it quickly converges again on the final estimate two and half months before the second peak in mid-September. The ongoing estimate of R0 provides important information for policy makers to take immediate action to control further disease spread.",

Thus, conducting a large-scale population-based survey on contact behaviour is suggested in every city. For densely populated cities like Hong Kong, contacts of individuals within and between different age groups may vary significantly. For this reason, a large scale population-based telephone survey in Hong Kong has recently been conducted to collect the contact histories of individuals at four different time points in a year, to examine the temporal changes of contacts, and generate unbiased estimates of contact between and among age groups [20].While model A provides a reasonable estimate for R0 in the general population as a whole, model B\u2013which takes age structure into account\u2013portrays a more refined picture of patterns of disease spread across different age groups, thus providing an age-specific estimate of R0. To better prepare for re-emerging and emerging infectious diseases, the use of model B and further studies on the temporal change of contacts\u2019 behaviour in major metropolitan areas may help refine these estimates even further, and provide more accurate insight into future outbreaks of infectious diseases in the early phase.",

However, real populations have far more complex structures with very different contact patterns. Specifically, the degree distribution of individuals in each age group is neither uniform nor non-overlapping.

For example, we have not included the possibility of late reporting or underreporting of numbers of new cases in the early phases of an epidemic. The assumption that the number of reported cases accurately reflects the actual number of cases may not hold true in real situations since first, not all infected persons will seek medical attention; and second, there are strong biases for certain age groups (such as children) to seek medical attention even in a precautionary capacity. To our knowledge, this model is the first network-based modeling framework that includes heterogeneity in the estimation of R0. In this framework the confidence interval of R0, is not constructed because the stochastic variables such as I\nr(t), R\nr(t), T\nr(t) used from Eqs (1\u20135) involves inherent uncertainties in arriving the estimator of R0 in addition to the above extrinsic factors.",
