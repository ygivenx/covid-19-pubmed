Acute inflammation comprises the immediate and early response to an injurious agent and is basically a defensive response that paves the way for repair of the damaged site. The term \u201cneuroinflammation\u201d is appropriate where limited neuronal insults trigger glial cell activation [1]. Neuroinflammation revolves around direct neuro-glial cell responses (host cell factors) which are induced by infection and injury within the CNS. It also involves the mechanism by which these responses ultimately contribute to neuropathology and neurobiology of diseases.",

Microglia remain quiescent in the CNS, unable to perform effector and APC functions until activated by injury or infection, and have been suggested to represent the first line of defence for the CNS, which normally lacks professional APCs until they are recruited to the CNS by inflammatory stimuli.

This is evident from characteristic changes in microglial cellular morphology and presence of abundant phagocytotic microglia in demyelinating plaques. MHV-induced CNS injury during early stage of infection involves microglia mediated neuroinflammation. But the mechanism by which these inflammatory responses ultimately contribute to MHV-induced demyelination and axonal loss is not clear. To understand neuroinflammatory pathways, expression of host inflammatory genes in MHV-infected mouse spinal cord is evaluated in comparison to non-infected mouse spinal cord by high throughput affymetrix microarray analysis. Brain and liver tissues from infected mice were evaluated for routine histopathological outcomes. Simultaneously, a high throughput Meso Scale Discovery (MSD)) Multi-Array Assay system for Mouse cytokines was performed to determine the predominant neuroinflammatory pathways involved in microglia-mediated myelin destruction.",

            "text": "RSA59 is recombinant isogenic demyelinating (DM) strain of MHV [3], [4]. RSA59 is isogenic to parental MHV-A59 but the spike gene is introduced by targeted RNA recombination. Spike gene encodes an envelope glycoprotein that mediates many biological properties of MHV including viral attachment to host cells, as well as virus-cell and cell-cell fusion [5]. These recombinant strains also express enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) [3]. Briefly, the pMH54 plasmid (obtained from Paul S. Masters) comprises codon 28 of the hemagglutinin esterase (HE) pseudogene through to the 3\u2032 end of the MHVA59 genome, including a poly(A) tail, as described by [6], used as transcription vector to generate RNA for targeted recombination as described previously [7], [8]. In order to replace gene 4 with the EGFP gene, pMH54 was modified by the introduction of a SalI site 42 nucleotides downstream of the intergenic sequence for gene 4a and a NotI site 102 bp upstream of the stop codon for gene 4b, using the Quick Change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Targeted RNA recombination was carried out between synthetic capped RNAs transcribed from pMH54EGFP, using a T7 polymerase transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) and fMHV as a recipient virus. Recombinant viruses in which the murine coronavirus spike gene has replaced the feline coronavirus spike gene were selected by replication in murine 17 Cl-1 cells [6], [9]. Candidate recombinants were plaque purified two times, and viral stocks were grown on 17Cl-1 cell for further characterization. For each desired recombinant, at least two viruses derived from independent recombination events were characterized. The EGFP containing viruses with the A59 spike were called RSA59 and used in this study.",

Two mice from each group were sacrificed for routine histopathological tissue processing. Two mice in control and three mice in the RSA59 infected group were analyzed in the microarray experiment.

The mouse Th1/Th2 9-Plex Assay detects IFN-\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, KC/GRO, IL-10, IL-12 total and TNF-\u03b1 in a sandwich immunoassay format. MSD provides a plate that has been pre-coated with capture antibodies on spatially distinct spots with an electro chemiluminiscent compound MSD SULFO TAG label. Analytes in the sample bind to the capture antibodies immobilized on the working electrode surface; recruitment of the detection antibodies by bound analytes completes the sandwich. MSD read buffer is added that provides the appropriate chemical environment for electrochemiluminescence. The plate is loaded into an MSD sector instrument for analysis. Inside the sector instrument, a voltage is applied to the plate electrode which causes the labels bound to the electrode surface to emit light. The instrument measures intensity of emitted light to afford a quantitative measure of the antibodies. Another single-plex plate containing antibody against IL-6 was also used to detect the presence and quantity of IL-6 in the protein sample.",

Taken together with our current findings, one possible explanation is that RSA59 may induce virus specific CD4 and CD8 T cells at day 7 p.i., but at earlier days (day 3 through 6); the majority of the inflammatory cells are microglia. Direct virus induced neuroinflammation due to the activation of CNS resident microglia may induce virus-specific CD8 and CD4 T cell responses in the CNS which may play a role in the augmentation of inflammation. Therefore, our studies mainly found changes in genes which are known to code microglia/macrophage specific cell surface molecules and other features of the innate response, often felt to occur even earlier in acute viral infection.",

            "text": "Many of the genes undergoing significant upregulation in the current study encode factors that have previously been shown to play a role in a variety of acute viral infections. It is well known that Type I interferons (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) provide a first line of defense against viral infections by limiting dissemination prior to the emergence of adaptive immune responses. Viral infection is sensed by endosomal Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which signal to activate NF-\u03baB, IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), IRF7, and downstream transcription of cytokine and IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 genes [19], [20]. Previous studies demonstrated that IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 binding to its receptor induces JAK/STAT signaling and upregulation of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in infected and uninfected cells. The antiviral effector functions triggered by IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 during a virus infection involve the concerted action of ISGs. In addition to direct innate antiviral factors, ISGs comprise cytokines, chemokines, and molecules associated with antigen presentation (MHC class I), thereby shaping adaptive immune responses [21]. The classically studied ISGs, RNase L, PKR, and Mx1, disrupt viral replication and subsequently spread by interfering with both viral and host cell transcription and translation [22]. However, the susceptibility to innate antiviral effector mechanisms differs between viruses and may also be distinct between target organs as well as cell types and their differentiation state [23], [24] has been reported.",

The role of individual genes in reducing viral replication and innate immunity has yet to be characterized. It will be interesting to explore the role of ISGs in microglia activation and phagocytosis.

HIV-1 enters the CNS early after infection, whereas productive replication and macrophage invasion occur years later [42]. Infected microglia harbor viral particles intracellularly, reflecting their potential as a reservoir. It has become increasingly apparent that HIV-1-infected microglia actively secrete both endogenous neurotoxins (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b1, CXCL8/IL-8, glutamate, quinolinic acid, platelet-activating factor, eicosanoids, and nitric oxide) as well as neurotoxic viral proteins (Tat, gp120, and gp41). In addition to neurotoxicity, these viral proteins can also affect microglial cell proliferation [42]. In Cytomegalovirus infection (HCMV), key defence cells include microglia and T lymphocytes. In mouse models, antiviral cytokine TNF-\u03b1 is produced by the microglial cells and sometimes T lymphocytes, mainly when they are chemoattracted by CXCL10. In HSV infection, neuroinflammation is characterized by acute focal necrotizing encephalitis. Microglial cells express both MHC class I and class II molecules and produce soluble mediators TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b1, CXCL10, CCL5, IL-6, CXCL8 and CCL3 [42].",

Many of these proteins are mainly involved in antiviral immune responses and phagolysosome maturation, and their upregulation also suggests acute MHV infection can drive innate and conserved antiviral responses similar to those seen in other viral infections. Similar phenomena have been observed in HIV infection in monocytes/microglia [44]. In contrast to Th1 responses, current results show almost no upregulation of Th2 cytokines/chemokines. The combination of increased expression of several canonical Th1 cytokines/chemokines and absence of Th2 cytokines/chemokines in RSA59 infected tissues supports the hypothesis that the host is continuing to mount a cell-mediated immune response to RSA59, as previously suggested [45]. Moreover, our data suggest that activated microglia/macrophage and inflammatory mediators contribute to a local CNS microenvironment that regulates viral replication and IFN-\u03b3 production during the acute phase of infection. The potential role of IFN-\u03b3 despite the limited role of T cells is intriguing, as initially it was believed that CD4+ T helper cell type 1 (Th1) lymphocytes, CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes, and NK cells exclusively produced IFN- \u03b3 [46], [47]. However, there is now evidence that other cells, such as B cells, NKT cells, and professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) [monocyte/macrophage, dendritic cells (DCs)] secrete IFN-\u03b3 [48], [49], [50], [51]. IFN-\u03b3 production by monocyte/macrophage, DCs acting locally may be important in self-activation and activation of nearby cells [50], [51]. While IFN \u03b3 is produced in T cells, its upregulation has also occurred in T cell deficient nude mice, leading to the conclusion that macrophages can also play a role in this in vivo response of IFN-\u03b3 secretion [52], [53], and during viral infections, macrophages are among the first cells in any organ to be exposed and are likely the major producers of IFN-\u03b3 soon after infection.",

Previous ultrastructural studies [10] support this mechanism as well, revealing activated microglia can surround myelinated axons with the myelin sheath getting disrupted with intact axons. Therefore, one mechanism of demyelination involves macrophage-mediated myelin stripping through an autophagy pathway without involving conventional CD4+ and CD8+T cells.",
