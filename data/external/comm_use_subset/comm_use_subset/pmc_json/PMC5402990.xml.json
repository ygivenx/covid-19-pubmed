The same screen revealed other gene products critical for EBOV entry [42,43] including many involved in endosome and lysosome biogenesis and maturation. One of the latter proteins was phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate 5-kinase (PIKfyve) [37], a lipid kinase that phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P) to generate phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2). PIKfyve and PI(3,5)P2 are known to be critical for endosome maturation [44\u201353].",

            "text": "Apilimod is a small molecule that binds to and inhibits the phosphotransferase activity of PIKfyve [54]. The drug was developed as a suppressor of interleukin 12 and 23 production [55], and was tested in phase 2 clinical trials for treatment of Crohn\u2019s disease [56,57], psoriasis [58], and rheumatoid arthritis [59]. Although no clinical benefit has yet been reported, apilimod is deemed to be well tolerated in humans. We chose to test whether apilimod could inhibit infections by EBOV and Marburg virus (MARV) for three reasons. The first was that apilimod binds [54] to the EBOV entry factor PIKfyve [37]. The second was because apilimod emerged from a blinded screen of 35 drugs (S1 Fig; S1 Table), which were selected as potential inhibitors based upon hypotheses of drugable targets and from theoretical considerations of pathways possibly involved in the EBOV life cycle. The third reason was because apilimod is well tolerated in humans. We find that apilimod inhibits infection by both EBOV and MARV, being notably effective in primary human macrophages, which are initial targets of filoviral infection [60,61]. Mechanistic studies revealed that apilimod blocks EBOV entry into the cell cytoplasm by working through PIKfyve and that its effect is to block viral particle trafficking to NPC1+ endolysosomes, the site of EBOV fusion [39\u201341]. Hence we propose that apilimod be further explored as part of a cocktail of small molecules to combat EVD.",

To test this hypothesis we over-expressed PIKfyve (GFP-PIKfyve) and compared the dose response needed for apilimod to block EBOV-GP mediated pseudovirus infection. As predicted, and as seen in Fig 4, higher doses of apilimod were needed to achieve similar levels of inhibition of EBOV GP-mediated infection in GFP-PIKfyve vs. GFP expressing cells. This supports our proposal that apilimod blocks EBOV entry and infection through a PIKfyve-dependent pathway.",

We used BSC-1 cells for these experiments as they are more suitable (flatter and more adherent) for immunofluorescence analysis than the HEK 293T/17 cells used in previous experiments (Figs 3 and 4). We first demonstrated that apilimod blocks EBOV VLP entry into BSC-1 cells with the same approximate dose-dependency as its effects in HEK 293T/17 cells (Fig 3D). Given that, we next asked if apilimod blocks trafficking of EBOV GP VLPs to NPC1+ endolysosomes in BSC-1 cells. As seen in Fig 5, this was, indeed, the case. Apilimod blocked EBOV VLP trafficking to NPC1+ endolysosomes to a similar extent as nocodazole, a microtubule destabilizer that is known to block traffic between early and late endosomes [67].",

To further test this model, we asked whether apilimod affects other attributes of the endosomal pathway needed for EBOV entry, either endosome acidification or the activity of cathepsin B and L [42,43]. At a concentration that strongly blocked EBOV entry and infection, apilimod had no detectable effect on endosome acidification (Fig 7). Bafilomycin, an inhibitor of EBOV infection that blocks endosome acidification, was used as a positive control. Apilimod also had no apparent direct effect on the activity of cathepsin B and L (Fig 8), in contrast to EST, a known inhibitor of cathepsin B, H, and L. Several cationic amphiphilic drugs such as U18666A that block EBOV entry and infection [20\u201322,24,25,68] induce cholesterol accumulation in endolysosomes [20,24]. In contrast, apilimod did not cause a detectable increase in cholesterol levels in endolysosomes (Fig 9). Hence apilimod appears to block filoviral entry and infection by inhibiting virus particle trafficking to NPC1+ endolysosomes, the portal for entry of the EBOV genome into the host cell cytoplasm [39\u201341].",

In addition to NPC1, its intracellular receptor [14,37,38], EBOV requires multiple factors involved in endosome and lysosome biogenesis and maturation for entry [37]. One of the latter factors is PIKfyve [37], which phosphorylates PI3P to generate PI(3,5)P2. Here we have shown that apilimod, which binds to PIKfyve [54], blocks EBOV entry and infection in a PIKfyve-dependent manner.",

Although the exact mechanism by which PIKfyve and PI(3,5)P2 orchestrate endosome maturation is not known, several mechanisms have been postulated. Considered in these mechanisms are the observations that two Ca++ channels found in (endo)lysosomes\u2014transient receptor potential cation channel, mucolipin 1 (TRPML1) [50,69] and TPC2 [70\u201372]\u2014are downstream effectors of PIKfyve and PI(3,5)P2. Through its action on TRPML1, PIKfyve has been shown to regulate the fission and consequent remodeling and maturation that reduces the size of macropinosomes containing endocytosed material from the cell surface and exterior [50]. In addition, the TPC2 channel has been reported to be activated by PI(3,5)P2 [71,72]. Intriguingly, both macropinocytosis [35,73,74] and TPC2 [75] are involved in EBOV entry and infection. Although we do not yet know all of the endolysosomal factors needed to trigger EBOV GP for fusion [36,39,43,76], it appears clear that proper endosomal maturation is required. These findings are consistent with the mounting evidence for a role of PIKfyve in EBOV entry and our observation that the PIKfyve inhibitor, apilimod, blocks transport of EBOV particles to NPC1+ endolysosomes. It is therefore likely that interconnected effects of apilimod on PIKfyve [37,54], TPC2 [75], and endolysosome maturation culminate in its blockade of EBOV entry and infection.",

The only other approved drugs that we know of with anti-EBOV activity that are expected to have this mode of action are microtubule-disrupting agents, including colchicine, nocodazole, vinblastine, and vinorelbine [21\u201323]. Hence the mode of action of apilimod as an anti-filoviral agent is novel. Rather than blocking EBOV trafficking to NPC1+ endosomes by interfering with microtubules, apilimod blocks EBOV trafficking by inhibiting PIKfyve.",

We therefore consider it likely that apilimod, a host-directed small molecule, will have broad or even pan-filoviral activity. Furthermore, since many other viruses, so-called late penetrating viruses [36,81], traffic beyond early endosomes for entry, it is possible that apilimod will block entry and infection by members of other virus families.",

Although it has been tested in phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of Crohn\u2019s disease, psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis, the drug has not yet been approved for any indication. Nonetheless apilimod was well-tolerated in humans in the reported phase 2 trials [56\u201359]. We found that intraperitoneal delivery of 10 mg/kg of apilimod to mice resulted in a Cmax of 2.53 \u03bcM. This is well above the IC50 for apilimod inhibition of EBOV infection in the three cell lines tested, ~250 times greater than the IC50 in hMDMs (10 nM), initial major targets of filoviral infections [60,61]. We therefore consider it plausible that apilimod be used in the treatment of EVD. And, while apilimod may not function as a single agent, it may perform well as a component in an anti-filoviral small molecule cocktail. In summary, we introduce apilimod, a small molecule PIKfyve inhibitor that has proven safe in phase 2 clinical trials, as a potential anti-filoviral agent.",
