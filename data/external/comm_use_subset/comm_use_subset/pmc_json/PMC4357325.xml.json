Testing for E. coli is part of the routine epidemiological examination for diagnosis of calf diseases, alongside testing for rota- and coronavirus, Cryptosporidium spp., and Salmonella spp. Nevertheless, diarrhea in calves remains a major cause of annual financial losses for farmers. Moreover, as a very important reservoir of human pathogenic E. coli, calves can transmit this pathogen to humans (Cobbold et al., 2007).",

            "text": "Since the end of the nineteenth century, the role of E. coli as a pathogen of calves has been of interest to the scientific community worldwide. Reports concerning calf colibacteriosis are present in the works of Jensen (1903), Titze and Weichel (1908), Christiansen (1917); Carpenter and Woods (1924), and Smith and Orcutt (1925). The first scientific studies focused on calf diarrhea of very young calves (up to the first 4 days), which is called calf scours (in German: K\u00e4lberruhr, in French: diarh\u00e9e des veaux). The general outcome of these studies was that \u201cBacillus coli\u201d is a main etiological factor of calf diarrhea. They divided the disease into enteritis with and without septicemia. Additionally, a dose-dependent protective role was described for the colostrum. Colostrum-deprived calves or calves with delayed colostrum ingestion died after 1\u20133 days and large amounts of E. coli were isolated from their small and large intestines and other internal organs. Calves fed with an insufficient protective dose of colostrum developed various forms of bacterial infections, such as arthritis and omphalitis, alone or together with diarrhea. On the other hand, calves receiving a sufficient dose of colostrum had the highest odds of staying healthy. The main characteristics of E. coli isolated from diarrheic calves were: higher counts of bacteria from different parts of the intestine, and isolation of bacteria from internal organs or pathologically changed parts of the body (e.g., joints) as compared to healthy controls. These changes were proposed to stem from toxins released by bacteria that eventually altered the intestinal physiology. These assumptions were confirmed partially and extended in the later studies of Smith (1962). However, he disputed the role of E. coli as a causative agent of the disease in colostrum-fed calves, because of the failures encountered in establishing experimental infection and development of the disease in them. His later work, in which he developed a test for toxin production with calf ligated intestinal loops and oral inoculation of calves, helped to elucidate this issue (Smith and Halls, 1967). Using this model, Smith was able to induce fluid accumulation in intestinal loops and diarrhea in 6\u201320 h old infected calves.",

The main goal was to find a pattern for grouping isolates and to use this knowledge in disease diagnosis and prevention. Many approaches grouped bacteria by their reactivity with sera raised against standard strains. One of the first attempts to O-serogroup isolates from calf diarrhea was done by Bokhari and \u00d8rskov (1952). Later, the antigen K99 as virulence-associated factor (VAF) associated with the pathogenesis of neonatal calf diarrhea was defined by Orskov et al. (1975) and Guin\u00e9e et al. (1976). Also, biochemical features of isolates were investigated extensively, but without any remarkable success to specifically identify pathogenic E. coli. The emergence of DNA- and protein-based assays for the detection of VAF opened the door for much faster and more accurate evaluations of E. coli isolates (Grunstein and Hogness, 1975; Orskov et al., 1977; Moseley et al., 1980; Burnette, 1981; Espy et al., 2006).",

It is now well accepted, that due to their high genotypic and phenotypic variation, E. coli can be subgrouped into many pathotypes. Commensalic E. coli is a common part of the intestinal microbiota of most mammals and birds. Only a small fraction of the E. coli population belongs to pathovars and pathotyping is based on the occurrence of VAF and virulence mechanisms (intestinal pathogenic E. coli) (Croxen et al., 2013) or by occurrence of E. coli in organs and tissues which are sterile in healthy hosts (extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli, e.g., uropathogenic E. coli). There are six major diarrheagenic E. coli pathotypes (Croxen et al., 2013). Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) is the confirmed main causative agent of neonatal calf diarrhea. Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC including enterohemorrhagic E. coli/EHEC) are also often isolated from diarrheic and healthy calves, but their role in calf disease remains controversial. However, EPEC, STEC, and EHEC are important human pathogens for which cattle constitute a major reservoir. Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), diffusely adherent E. coli (DAEC), and enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC; including Shigella) are less known in cattle.",

The role of these bacteria as calf pathogens has not been conclusively elucidated. There have been cases of fatal STEC infections in cattle, despite their lack of expression of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), a receptor for Stx cellular internalization, on their vascular endothelium (Pruimboom-Brees et al., 2000). Recent studies show that receptor binding is different between Stx1 and Stx2 and might involve more than one glycan (Gallegos et al., 2012). STEC that are able to induce A/E lesions are grouped as enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC).

Several O groups are more prevalent in single pathotypes (Ewers et al., 2014). Other tools for the characterization of isolates are various genotyping methods e.g., pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), multilocus sequence typing (MLST), multiple loci VNTR analysis (MLVA), and the Clermont method (Clermont et al., 2000; Foley et al., 2004).",

Our meta-analysis reviews all published and available data between 1951 and 2013 concerning the presence of VAFs in E. coli isolated from diarrheic and healthy calves and discusses the role of E. coli pathotypes in disease, the role of calves as pathogen reservoir and the epidemiological trends in this field over the past decades.",
