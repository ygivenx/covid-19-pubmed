The first candidate to be approved was infliximab, initially approved for intravenous use at a dose of 3 mg/kg. More recent antibodies have been developed as subcutaneous injections, and adalimumab has taken over as the market leader, with an injection every 2 weeks.

Manufacturing costs are a particularly important attribute for any medication that is developed for diseases of poverty in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, production efficiency of mAbs has increased dramatically over recent decades, and cell-culture expression levels around 4 g/l or even higher are common. A published analysis from a decade ago already noted that the costs of mAb production were dropping from US$300/g to US$20/g when being produced at the 10-tonne-per-year scale, potentially using large, 100,000 L reactors [16]. A more recent analysis has similar estimates [17], which\u2014depending on process and volume\u2014range from US$20/g to US$80/g [18].",

The intramuscular route effectively limits the dose; an injection volume of 1.0 ml is probably close to the maximum acceptable in small children, and antibodies are typically only soluble to around 100 mg/ml, which gives a limitation on the total dose of around 100 mg, corresponding to a range of 5 to 20 mg/kg [19]. Taken together, the cost of goods of an injection based on current numbers would be in the range of US$1 to US$8. Benchmarking such costs is difficult, but as a comparison, the recently launched malaria vaccine provides less than 50% protection for 3 injections at around US$5 each. The programmatic cost of protecting a child from malaria for a year in the Sahel using existing low-cost oral medicines has been estimated at US$3.40 by Unitaid [20]. An injectable therapeutic that could protect a child for a season for this price provides a cost-effective option.",

            "text": "The other important factor to manage is the reduction of the frequency of administration, to make the prophylaxis useful in resource-poor settings. mAbs used in therapy are generally IgGs (immunoglobulin Gs), which have plasma half-lives of 20 to 25 days in humans [21, 22]. Such antibodies can be used to provide several months of protection, as in the case of the once-per-season anti-RSV antibody MEDI8897 (nirsevimab) discussed earlier or the anti\u2013calcitonin gene-related peptide (anti-CGRP) fremanezumab, recently approved for prevention of migraines with a dose of 675 mg every 3 months. An alternative to simply increasing the dose would be increasing the half-life of the circulating mAb. Several strategies have been proposed here [23]: Mutations can be made in the IgG Fc (fragment crystallizable) region, which interacts with the receptors responsible for the uptake of antibodies. Such mutations, as for MEDI8897, can significantly extend an mAb\u2019s plasma half-life. Mutations derived from the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) increase the strength of the interaction between the Fc region and the Fc receptors under the acidic pH conditions in lysosomes, and as a result, the receptor\u2013Fc complex is recycled back to the cell surface, escaping degradation [24, 25]. This approach was followed for bevacizumab and cetuximab, by mutating Met428 to Leu and Asn434 to Ser. Discussion about even longer periods of protection has been stimulated by recent results from virally mediated expression of antibodies targeting HIV [26]. These technologies hold out the promise of sustained serum titers of antibodies for more than a year from a single injection, although the technological development is more complicated than for the direct injection of antibodies.",

            "text": "First and foremost for the development of mAbs is the question of suitable antigen targets. Viruses are the simplest pathogens, and their genomes allow limited means to evade host immunity; therefore, passive and active vaccinations have been most successful in this area. Therapeutic antibodies have been developed and marketed for respiratory syncytial, varicella zoster, vaccinia, and hepatitis B viruses (HBVs) [27, 28]. Historically, immune responses against viruses were considered purely cellular and those against other types of pathogens mostly humoral (antibody based) and less effective. However, nowadays the interplay between both systems is better understood, for instance, with therapeutic opportunities against viruses such as rabies that rely on passive immunization. mAbs that target the initial stages of an infection may provide prophylaxis, and the repertoire of potential antigens for such approaches is greatly helped by the increased availability of genomic and transcriptional information. Passive immunization is especially effective in infections, such as those with the rabies virus, which avoids apoptosis of infected neurons while killing protective T cells so that carriers do not mount an immune response themselves [29]. A recent review [30] lists 21 mAbs (and a nanobody, a single-chain type of antibody produced by camelids) that are currently in clinical trials in the United States. In addition, polyclonal antibodies have been approved in the European Union or the US for cytomegalovirus, hepatitis viruses A and C, and postexposure prophylaxis against measles, rabies, rubella, and tetanus [31]. These approaches appear most suitable for virus infections and for protection against the consequences of snake venom but might also be applied to other types of disease.",

Snake bites, and the challenge of envenoming, represent a serious health problem, resulting in 81,000 to 138,000 deaths yearly [35], and were recently included in the World Health Organization (WHO) list of neglected tropical diseases. The discovery of mAbs in this area logically follows the long-standing therapeutic successes with passive immunization [36], and the costs and feasibility of developing mAbs were recently reviewed [34, 37][38], including specific clinical development and regulatory challenges [39]. In this Review, we selected diseases prioritized by the Global Health Innovative Technology (GHIT) Fund, an international collaboration between the public and private sectors, supporting collaborations between Japanese and non-Japanese entities to advance global health research and development [40, 41]. The present vaccine discovery statuses for these diseases are listed in Table 1.",

Clearly, as with the malarial parasites, the more stages of the parasite life cycle that can be inhibited, the more effective the protection will be. The molecular targets best addressed by antibodies are still not clear. Some life cycle differences can be characterized: Schistosomula recovered from the lungs are elongated and more resistant to antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity than newly transformed schistosomula. Praziquantel, the standard treatment for schistosomiasis, acts only against adult worms and has no effects on the juveniles, thus repeat treatment is required to eliminate all the worms in a patient. An ideal treatment would therefore kill both adult and juvenile worms at a submicromolar concentration. This is effectively the target candidate profile for a small molecule inhibitor [66].",

Clinically, this treatment reduces infection by 70% to 80% using doses of 40 to 60 mg/kg [67]. In a murine model with infection by S. mansoni cercariae, the maximum dose of 400 mg/kg killed 96% of all adult worms [68]. However, this murine dose produced a peak exposure of 6 ng/ml, some 10-fold higher than the exposure observed in children at the recommended regimen of 40 to 60 mg/kg [69, 70]. It seems pragmatic to project that an antibody that can reduce the worm burden by 80% in the mouse model, at a dose that is clinically achievable in humans, could be acceptable. The maximally practicable injection of an antibody in children is 2 to 5 mg/kg, and given the relatively consistent allometry between humans and mice for mAbs, this corresponds to a dose of 80 to 200 \u03bcg in mice [19].",

            "text": "Clues about other possible ways forward, in terms of antigen selection, come from a variety of areas.First, Schistosoma are helminths (or flatworms), and the initial immune response is a characteristically strong T helper 2 (Th2) cytokine reaction, which is not seen in viral or bacterial infections and is less pronounced in protozoan infections. The cytokines that are released include interleukin (IL)-5, which drives the production of eosinophils to attack the parasite, and IL-4 and IL-13, which drive the production of immunoglobulin E (IgE). Epidemiological studies in endemic areas suggest that an age-dependent immunity may develop against infection, or against reinfection after treatment [71\u201373]. There is a good correlation between this protection and the development of IgE antibodies, resulting from Th2 responses [73, 74]. A hybridoma that produces a monoclonal IgE antibody to S. japonicum, SJ18\u03b5.1, was identified [57]. This mAb was protective in an in vitro, antigen-dependent, cellular cytotoxicity assay with rat macrophages or eosinophils and also in vivo during the early phase of infection [57\u201359]. It recognizes a 97 kDa antigen, Sm-97 (Schistosoma mansoni-97), identified as paramyosin, a muscle protein unique to invertebrates [75, 76]. The epitope of paramyosin recognized by SJ18\u03b5.1 was determined to be the SJ18\u03b5.1359\u2212362 sequence Ile\u2013Arg\u2013Arg\u2013Ala [77]. Injection of mice with paramyosin provides protection against S. mansoni infection [78]. The S. japonicum equivalent protein, Sj97 (S. japonicum-97), has also been proposed as a vaccine target [79], although no further development has been reported. Taken together, this suggests that an alternative approach to generating therapeutic mAbs would be to produce IgG mAbs targeting paramyosin and potentially other soluble, nonsurface antigens [78].",

Even with the best current treatment, the risk for mortality due to an IFI can be higher than 40%. For low-income countries, this figure is substantially worse, as many invasive infections are uniformly fatal without treatment, and estimates of global mortality involving fungal infections are as high as 1.5 million annually [87\u201389].

The capacity for endogenous infection and for acquisition from asymptomatic carriers makes Pneumocystis an attractive target for immunoprophylaxis. To this end, a variety of programs are aimed at developing a Pneumocystis vaccine [108, 109], and passive immunization studies have been initiated using mAbs raised to Pneumocystis epitopes. Intranasal administration of 4F11, an mAb that recognizes the Pneumocystis kexin-like protein KEX1, was able to prevent transmission of Pneumocystis pneumonia from infected to susceptible cohoused mice, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach [110].

Use of mAbs as adjuvants to existing antifungal drugs also shows promise [116]. However, it should be noted that not all mAbs are inhibitory; indeed, some may worsen infection, species and strain specificity can be an issue, and the mechanistic basis of inhibition by different mAbs can vary dramatically [117]. To date, only 2 mAb treatments have advanced to clinical trials: the previously mentioned 18B7 in Cryptococcus, and Mycograb, a heat shock protein 90 (HSP90)-specific antibody fragment, which showed promise for treating Candida infections but failed to make it to market due to production difficulties and unresolved safety issues.

However, interim results from long-term safety follow-up studies demonstrated an increased risk for hospitalization of vaccine-sensitized individuals [122], suggesting that ADE-related concerns are relevant. It has been reported that non-neutralizing levels of anti-DENV antibody can enhance viral entry into host cells by forming a DENV-antibody complex [123, 124]. There is concern that an incomplete antibody against DENVs may cause ADE-mediated severe dengue disease. Hence, there is a need for a safe and highly efficacious dengue therapy or vaccine that provides immunity against all 4 serotypes simultaneously.",

In this model, the efficacy and safety profile of therapeutic antibodies can be evaluated rapidly in small-scale clinical settings, prior to traditional large-scale field studies with naturally infected patients. To develop mAbs for dengue therapy, it is important to consider an approach that prevents or reduces ADE, and several studies that address this link have been undertaken. A neutralizing human mAb, D23-1B3B9, that targets the fusion loop in domain II showed strong neutralizing activity against all 4 DENV serotypes [46]. However, at subneutralizing concentrations, it also elicited ADE activity in vitro [47]. To reduce the ADE, Injampa and coworkers [48] modified the D23-1B3B9 antibody Fc domain at position N297Q. The modified antibody kept the same cross-neutralizing activity to all 4 serotypes as those of wild-type antibody but lacked ADE activity against all 4 serotypes at subneutralizing concentrations. In another neutralizing mAb, SIgN-3C, 2 leucine to alanine mutations were engineered in the Fc part, abrogating binding to Fc gamma receptors [43]. This mutant Fc version (SIgN-3C-LALA) protected mice, while ADE was completely abrogated. Similarly, Mab11/mutated Fragment crystallizable region (mutFc) (an mAb that is unable to bind to cells with Fc\u03b3 receptors [Fc\u03b3R]) and potentiate ADE have been used as a prophylactic therapy [49]. Passive immunization with this mAb (at 25 mg/kg) reduced viral load and disease progression in nonhuman primates.",

Several studies have tested antibody therapy in TB, with varying success (reviewed in [127]). Even if an mAb treatment would not be curative, shortening the standard treatment of patients infected with multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains would represent a major advance.

Additionally, the number of merozoites invading erythrocytes is very large (up to 1012), compared with the number of sporozoites invading the liver stages (dozens). As such, the most interesting place to intervene with an mAb is at the initial infection of the liver. Currently there are 3 mAbs published with potent activity against the circumsporozoite protein, CSP, and these can reduce the parasitaemia in sporozoite-infected FRG (triple mutant Fah/Ra\u03b32/IL2R\u03b3) mice that carry a human liver implant [132]. These mAbs include mAb317, cloned from B cells obtained from a patient in the recent RTS,S vaccine trial [133], CIS43 (circumsporozoite protein 43 [56]), and a set that included MGU12 [134], cloned from patients vaccinated with irradiated sporozoites. Antibodies that block the invasion process of the red blood cells by merozoites represent another possible approach. In studies of the merozoite protein RH5 (reticulocyte-binding protein homologue 5) as a potential vaccine, some antibodies were described that could block the cycle of erythrocyte infection [135]. The specific merozoite epitopes are now being characterized, and this could form the basis of a second-generation antibody [136, 137].",

Studies in animal models of chronic malaria infection led to the observation that this results in a reduction in the impact of cytotoxic T cells and modulates the Treg capacity, leading to an \u201cexhausted\u201d or ineffective T-cell response [145]. Clinical trials are already underway that use immune checkpoint blockers for chronic HIV and HBV infection [11]. This has important implications for any infectious disease in which a single infection does not drive a sterilizing immune response. For such diseases, which include malaria, one question for the longer term is whether immune checkpoint inhibition, or interfering with interferon-\u03b1 signaling, could be used [128].",

This shift to highly specific medicines favors the use of mAbs. Given the overall rise in interest for new treatments in infectious diseases caused by concerns about antimicrobial resistance, there is a real opportunity now to progress the newly emerging families of mAbs to target infectious diseases of neglected populations. Because of outdated preconceptions about this class of therapeutics, few research funds are being allocated to their discovery, resulting in an egg-and-chicken problem (the absence of conspicuous success driving additional efforts). One of the goals of the analysis that we present here is to promote making additional funds available to pursue the initial discovery of mAbs for neglected diseases.",
