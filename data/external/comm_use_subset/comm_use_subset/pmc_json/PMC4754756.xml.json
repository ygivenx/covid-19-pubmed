The results showed that growth of the Xoo strains was completely inhibited by 5 \u03bcg/ml niclosamide, whereas Xag growth was inhibited by 15 \u03bcg/ml niclosamide (Fig. 1a). Xag is a pathogen that causes bacterial leaf pustule disease in soybean45. We also examined the effect of niclosamide on the growth of the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. Niclosamide did exert an inhibitory effect on the growth of 12 M. oryzae strains, although the inhibition was considerably weaker than that against Xoo (Fig. 1b).",

Lesion development also was significantly inhibited by 8 \u03bcg/ml niclosamide, although a small lesion was still detected at this concentration (Fig. 2b). Lesion development gradually declined with increasing niclosamide concentrations (Fig. 2b). We also examined the levels of bacterial growth, and found that population levels of Xoo bacteria declined with increasing niclosamide concentrations (Fig. 2c).",

Several recent studies report that niclosamide is active against cancer cells395051, which indicates that niclosamide has broad-spectrum disease control activity. Therefore, we examined whether niclosamide had inhibitory activity against rice leaf blight, and found that the leaf blight symptoms were suppressed by niclosamide through inhibition of Xoo growth and lesion development (Figs 2 and 3). Niclosamide moved systemically from the local application site to Xoo-inoculated distal leaves, and inhibited lesion development and leaf wilting by inhibiting Xoo growth in distal leaves (Fig. 4). We examined the effect of niclosamide on the growth of three Xoo strains, and found that it inhibited their growth (Fig. 1a,e). Next, we evaluated whether niclosamide induced the expression of the defense-related genes OsPR1, OsPR10, OsWRKY45, OsWRKY62, OsWRKY71, and OsHI-LOX, and detected higher transcript levels for these genes (Fig. 6). These results clearly indicate that niclosamide blocks the development of rice leaf blight by directly inhibiting Xoo bacterial growth (Figs 2c and 3c) and/or by inducing defense-related gene expression (Fig. 6). Niclosamide also inhibited Xag growth, which causes bacterial leaf pustule disease in soybean45, although its inhibitory effect against Xag was weaker than that against Xoo strains (Fig. 1a). This suggests that niclosamide may inhibit the growth of select bacterial pathogens of other crops and thereby protect them from disease.",

Our qRT-PCR analysis showed that niclosamide induced the expression of SA-dependent genes in rice leaves (Fig. 6). We investigated whether niclosamide induced defense mechanisms directly by functioning like a phytohormone, or indirectly via SA-mediated signaling pathways. We measured the levels of free SA and its conjugate glucosyl-SA, and found that their levels were higher in niclosamide-treated leaves than in control leaves (Fig. 7).

Currently, we do not know the mechanism underlying niclosamide-mediated inhibition of Xoo growth and induction of SA-and JA-dependent plant defense responses. Future work will examine the effects of niclosamide on glucose metabolism, the transcriptome and proteome, and quorum sensing to identify the mechanism by which niclosamide inhibits bacterial leaf blight in rice. Further investigations of the effects of niclosamide on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, changes in transcriptome and ROS levels, and changes in hormone signals (including SA and JA) also are required to fully characterize its functions as a broad-spectrum signaling regulator in plants.",

            "text": "The use of antibiotics and chemicals in plant agriculture is a subject of some concern. The use of antibiotics and chemicals in open fields over large expanses of land may increase the frequency of antibiotic resistance in gene pools, or possible chemical accumulation in plant tissues and the food chain. Niclosamide is a teniacide, which is effective against cestodes such as tapeworms that infect humans and many other animals (although it is not effective against as pinworms and roundworms). Niclosamide also is used as a piscicide. Recent work reported that it appeared to be safe and well tolerated in humans, even when used in mass treatment campaigns in several countries, although it has known adverse effects including nausea, retching, abdominal pain, light headedness, pruritus, vomiting, and dizziness59. There are no previous reports of niclosamide effects on plant growth, other organisms, or the food chain. We cannot state that niclosamide treatment of agricultural crops is safe for other organisms or for the food chain because research in this area is still lacking. Therefore, further studies on the function and stability of niclosamide under natural environmental conditions and when applied to crop plants are required to determine whether niclosamide has adverse effects on other organisms and human health when applied to plants.",
