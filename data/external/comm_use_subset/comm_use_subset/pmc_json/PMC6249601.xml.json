To obtain these, VelocImmune mice were immunized with DNA constructs encoding the GP protein and/or recombinant purified GP protein (Makona strain). To select the best therapeutic antibodies from the pool of GP-specific antibodies obtained from these immunized mice, several in vitro screening assays were used to identify antibodies that collectively provide the following properties: (1) blocking entry of EBOV GP-pseudotyped particles into susceptible cells, (2) ability to remain bound to GP at endosomal pH to prevent interaction with intracellular receptors and membrane fusion [33], (3) lack of cross-competition to ensure that antibodies simultaneously bind to GP, (4) binding to sGP to block its potential role in EBOV pathogenesis, and (5) Fc effector function to mediate killing of EBOV-infected cells by immune cells, which was previously suggested as important for protection [16]. To facilitate discovery of antibodies that mediated this latter activity, our screening was undertaken with antibodies produced in a CHO cell line that had been selected for its ability to produce antibodies with very low levels of terminal fucosylation (data not shown), because low fucosylation has been reported to enhance antibody effector function [34] and contribute to anti-EBOV activity [35]. Using the above screening criteria, 3 mAbs (REGN3470, REGN3471, and REGN3479\u2014all produced in low-fucose cell lines) were selected within 10 weeks of initiating our immunization campaign.",

Additional studies examined whether the antibodies retained binding over the normal range of endosomal pH (5\u20137.4). As shown in Table 2, the mAbs displayed a less than 2-fold (REGN3470 and REGN3471) or 3-fold (REGN3479) increase in kd values at pH 5.0, indicating that at this pH, binding to GP was still tight. In addition, binding to sGP was measured. Each antibody was captured onto Octet HQX sensors (Fortebio) and immersed in 300 nM solutions of EBOV sGP, EBOV GP, or irrelevant negative control ligand.

First, cross-competition between paired mAbs was assessed by using the Octet HTX system. After the capture of EBOV GP protein onto Octet sensors, the first test antibody was allowed to bind to saturation, followed by exposure to the second test antibody. All possible paired combinations of EBOV-specific mAbs and an isotype control were tested (Table 4). This assay format showed that REGN3470, REGN3471, and REGN3479 do not compete for binding to EBOV GP. To substantiate whether these antibodies are able to bind the EBOV GP simultaneously, a 3-step sequential-binding study was performed using SPR. Saturating amounts of each mAb were applied in separate, sequential steps over an EBOV GP sensor chip surface, using all permutations for the order of antibody addition. Figure 1A shows a sensorgram displaying sequential increases in binding signal resulting from injection of EBOV GP to the sensor chip, followed by the injection of REGN3479, REGN3471, and REGN3470. Control experiments demonstrated that repeated injections of the same antibody did not result in additional binding signal, indicating that the binding sites for each antibody were saturated by the first injection (data not shown). Similar results were obtained for all permutations in the order of antibody injections (Figure 1B), demonstrating that REGN3470, REGN3471, and REGN3479 can bind simultaneously to EBOV GP.",

The antibody binds within the chalice structure at or near the head of GP and may partially contact the glycan cap.

Its importance in clearance of EBOV disease is presently unclear, but previous reports indicated that ADCC is elicited by an antibody isolated from a human survivor [13], and studies have suggested that reduced fucose forms of nonneutralizing mAbs are more efficacious in animal models of EBOV infection than the same mAbs with normal levels of fucose [16]. The ability of REGN3470, REGN3471, REGN3479, or a cocktail of the 3 antibodies to mediate Fc\u03b3RIIIa signaling in engineered Jurkat cells was evaluated in the presence of HEK293 cells expressing Makona strain EBOV GP (to mimic infected cell targets) or HEK293 parental control cells (Figures 2B). In the presence of EBOV GP-expressing cells, REGN3470 and REGN3471 induced a dose-dependent activation of Fc\u03b3RIIIa signaling in effector cells with half maximal effective concentration (EC50) values of 2.9 and 1.6 nM, respectively. The REGN3470-3471-3479 cocktail (1:1:1 equimolar ratio) also induced Fc\u03b3RIIIa signaling with an EC50 of 1.7 nM. No activation was observed in the presence of control cells. These results indicate that binding of REGN3470 and REGN3471 to EBOV GP-expressing target cells induced avidity-driven Fc binding to Fc\u03b3RIIIa on effector cells, resulting in activation of signaling. REGN3479 had no activity, indicating that this antibody, although strongly neutralizing, does not activate Fc\u03b3RIIIa signaling in engineered Jurkat cells, even though it bound to the target cell surface (results not shown).",

Guinea pigs were chosen because they have been used to predict therapeutic benefit for antibody-cocktails eventually tested in NHPs [12]. Groups of 6 animals (approximately 400 grams each) were challenged with a target dose of 1000 pfu of guinea pig-adapted EBOV, followed 24 hours later by a single 5-mg dose of antibody or placebo control. Guinea pigs were monitored twice daily for 21 days. Kaplan-Meier survival curves for each cohort and the clinical scores of each animal in each treatment group are shown in Figure 2C. All of the guinea pigs in the placebo group succumbed to EBOV disease by day 7. In contrast, postchallenge administration of each antibody was shown to delay EBOV disease symptom onset and prevent or delay death during the observation period. REGN3479, the most potent neutralizer in vitro, displayed the greatest individual efficacy, with 66% of treated animals surviving. REGN3471 protected approximately 33% of infected animals, whereas, REGN3470 improved median survival by 4 days, but all animals eventually succumbed to disease. The clinical scores indicated delayed onset of disease signs for all mAb-treated animals compared with placebo treatment. In addition, surviving animals in the REGN3471- and REGN3479-treated groups displayed limited clinical signs of infection. This study shows that in this disease model antibodies that only block infection by neutralization (REGN3479), only have effector functions via signaling through Fc\u03b3RIIIa (REGN3471), or combine both activities (REGN3470) show benefit in vivo when administered as a monotherapy. Taken together, the in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that each of the 3 mAbs selected has a different binding and functional activity profile that confers protection from disease and lethality in an in vivo model of EBOV disease.",

The first study showed that 3 postinfection doses of the REGN3470-3471-3479 cocktail administered 1:1:1 (50 mg/kg total antibody) resulted in 100% protection from lethal disease. Rhesus macaques were challenged with a target dose of 1000 pfu of the Kikwit strain of EBOV by intramuscular injection and were randomized into 2 groups. Group 1 (control arm) contained 6 animals that were each administered an intravenous placebo control. Group 2 (treatment arm) contained 9 animals that were administered the REGN3470-3471-3479 cocktail intravenously at 50 mg/kg (1:1:1) on days 5, 8, and 11 postinfection. Animals were monitored daily for signs of EBOV disease. As shown in Figure 3A, all 6 placebo-treated animals succumbed to EBOV disease by day 9 postinfection. In contrast, despite showing disease symptoms on day 5, when treatment began, none of the 9 animals that received the antibody cocktail succumbed to disease. Clinical scores (Figure 3B) indicated that disease symptoms in the treated animals were also abrogated and that all treated animals showed no obvious signs of disease before the third dose of the cocktail was administered on day 11. Analysis of serum viral load by plaque assay (Figure 3C) indicated that all treated animals had undetectable circulating replication-competent virus after the first dose of the cocktail. Body temperatures recorded by telemetry (Supplemental Figure 1) indicated that all animals in the placebo group had sustained fever (Supplemental Figure 1A\u2013F, red and purple dots) that persisted until succumbing to disease. Likewise, the antibody cocktail-treated animals exhibited fever beginning on day 3\u20134 postinfection. However, in contrast to the placebo group, the fever had ended, for most animals, by day 9, providing an additional clinical measure indicating that animals were recovering 4 days after initiation of treatment, before the third dose of the cocktail was administered.",

Eighteen rhesus macaques were challenged with a target dose of 1000 pfu of the Kikwit strain of EBOV and divided into 4 groups that received placebo control (4 animals), 3 doses of 50 mg/kg of the antibody mixture (1:1:1) on days 5, 8, and 11 postinfection (4 animals), 2 doses of 50 mg/kg of the antibody mixture on days 5 and 8 postinfection (5 animals), or 1 dose of 150 mg/kg of the antibody mixture on day 5 postvirus challenge. Animals were monitored daily for mortality and clinical symptoms (Figure 4A and B). As in the previous study, all placebo control-treated animals succumbed to EBOV disease by day 9. In contrast, treatment resulted in survival of most animals in each treatment group, despite the finding that all animals showed multiple clinical signs of disease before treatment initiation (Figure 4B). Only 1 animal succumbed to the infection in the 3 \u00d7 50 mg/kg and 1 \u00d7 150 mg/kg groups, and all animals survived in the 2 \u00d7 50 mg/kg group. There were no significant differences between the treatment arms, indicating that fewer doses (and less total administered antibody) or a single administration of the antibody cocktail provide a similar therapeutic result to what was previously observed with 3 \u00d7 50 mg/kg doses of cocktail. Similar to what was observed in the first study, combined clinical scores of placebo and antibody-treated animals (Figure 4B) indicated that all animals had advanced disease that was controlled by the treatment, and the majority of these infected animals displayed no symptoms after approximately day 10 postinfection. Finally, virus load was measured in the sera of infected control and treated animals by 2 different assays: a plaque assay to detect infectious virus (Figure 4C) and quantitative PCR to detect the presence of virus genomes (Figure 4D). These viral load studies confirmed that antibody treatment (but not placebo treatment) controlled EBOV infection, reducing virus loads by >106-fold, and showed that the 2 animals that succumbed to EBOV disease in the treated groups displayed viral genome copy numbers higher than the other members of their treated cohorts. In addition, these data show similar levels of virus load control in all treated animals regardless of treatment regimen.",

Forty rhesus macaques were challenged and divided into 5 groups that received placebo control (4 animals), 150 mg/kg (9 animals), 100 mg/kg (9 animals), 50 mg/kg (9 animals), and 10 mg/kg (9 animals) of the antibody cocktail (1:1:1) on day 5 postinfection. As shown in Figure 5A, all 4 placebo control-treated animals succumbed to EBOV disease. As seen in the second study, despite clear disease signs being present, administration of 150 mg/kg antibody cocktail resulted in almost complete survival of infected animals (8 of 9 animals). In addition, a single treatment of 100 mg/kg resulted in a similar high survival (8 of 9 animals), and a single treatment of the 50 mg/kg led to survival of 7 of 9 animals (nonsignificant difference compared with higher-dose groups), whereas 10 mg/kg had a partial effect, because 5 of 9 succumbed to the infection despite treatment. Duration of fever (Figure 5B) and the extent of temperature increase (Figure 5C) were identical for the 150 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg groups, indicating that these 2 doses of the cocktail had similar effect on controlling fever. In comparison, animals that received the 50 mg/kg dose were slightly impaired at controlling their fever, whereas the 10 mg/kg group displayed temperature readings similar to the placebo-treated group, even though a significant number of animals survived in this cohort. Thus, a single-dose treatment with the REGN3470-3471-3479 cocktail afforded high-level, dose-dependent, postexposure protection against lethal EBOV disease and that 100 mg/kg was the lowest dose tested that gave best control of symptoms.",

Multiple classes of EBOV disease therapeutics, ranging from small molecule inhibitors that act on viral replication to mAbs that recognize viral proteins, have been described [38]. Human mAbs are particularly appealing because they display predictable pharmacokinetics and tolerability, and their antipathogen activities can be rapidly evaluated in vitro based on established mechanisms of action. Fully human mAbs with potent antiviral activity can be generated rapidly and reliably using a platform based on humanized mice as demonstrated in the present report and previously for development of mAbs to treat infections with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [22].",

The 3 antibodies were purposely chosen to bind distinct epitopes in the GP to hinder development of viral resistance. After the rapid screening and selection of these mAbs, the guinea pig model was used to validate them. An antibody with Fc\u03b3RIIIa signaling but no neutralizing activity (REGN3471), a novel single mAb that displayed both neutralizing and Fc\u03b3RIIIa signaling activity (REGN3470), or a mAb with high levels of neutralizing activity (REGN3479) can delay or prevent death in this model.

These studies revealed that REGN3471 has the steepest angle of approach on EBOV GP, binding perpendicular to the viral surface at an angle of approximately 90 degrees. The EBOV GP trimer was able to accommodate 3 REGN3471 Fabs, despite the tight clustering of the epitope within the chalice structure of the trimer at or near the head of GP, in an area that likely overlaps with the glycan cap. REGN3471 appears to bind even closer to the center of the chalice than does mAb c13C6 (that forms part of the ZMapp cocktail) [31]. Compared with mAb114, a neutralizing human mAb obtained from a long-term human survivor of EBOV disease [39], REGN3471 binds further away from the NPC1 Loop C binding site, which may explain why this antibody is not neutralizing [39]. REGN3470 binds the EBOV GP parallel to the viral surface on the outside of the glycan cap, a position that could help to explain neutralization and its ability to trigger Fc\u03b3RIIIa. Finally, REGN3479 binds at the base of GP, between protomers of GP1/GP2. The epitope lies near the internal fusion loop and cathepsin cleavage site, similar to the neutralizing antibodies derived from a long-term survivor, which were recently crystalized [39]. The angle of REGN3479 is rotated 90 degrees compared with mAb100, and the angle of approach is slightly upward from the viral surface. Based on its binding site, the potent neutralization activity of REGN3479 may be due to blockade of cathepsin cleavage or release of the fusion loop upon receptor binding, similar to the mechanism proposed for mAb100 [39].",

This work was performed using a clinical (nonadapted) EBOV isolate that replicates many of the key pathophysiological aspects to EBOV infection in man [37]. Furthermore, the antibody mixture used was the same lot of clinical-grade material that is undergoing human testing (clinicaltrials.gov number NCT02777151). Using this model, 3 different studies were performed and confirmed the therapeutic benefit of the REGN3470-3471-3479 cocktail. More importantly, in postexposure studies where treatment was initiated after the appearance of clinical signs of disease, in 2 separate studies conducted at 2 different BSL-4 laboratories, 2 doses of 50 mg/kg and a single infusion of 100 mg/kg or 150 mg/kg of REGN3770-3471-3479 prevented death in >88% of the animals.",

The entire process of antibody generation, selection, preclinical evaluation, and readiness for human testing was completed in <1 year, and the cocktail is currently being tested in healthy volunteers in preparation for future EBOV outbreaks. More importantly, this rapid isolation of fully human mAbs previously reported for MERS-CoV [22] and here for EBOV demonstrate the usefulness of a combined platform of technologies, which is currently being applied to Zika virus, and it may also be applicable to future emerging viral threats.",
