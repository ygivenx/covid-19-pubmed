This finding is consistent with other studies, with the use of antipyretics in the existing literature ranging from 76.4%17 to 99.3%10 in influenza\u2010positive children, albeit with a shorter duration of use than demonstrated here (3.2\u20103.9 days, respectively).10, 17 A lack of awareness or compliance with guidelines on the use of decongestant/cough medicines in children was noted. Decongestant/cough medicines should not be given to children under 2 years.32 Nevertheless, such medicines were given to 9% of children with ILI and 14% of children with influenza under 2 years. Similarly in 2013/14, 6% of children with ILI and 8% of children with influenza were given these medicines despite the contraindication being extended to include children under 6 years.33\n",

There are significant implications associated with inappropriate prescription of antibiotics, including a significant cost, unnecessary adverse side effects34 and the increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance.35 In contrast, the infrequent use of antivirals highlights that empiric antiviral therapy, as opposed to antibacterial therapy, is uncommon in WA, particularly those seen in the emergency department. Of the nine children prescribed oseltamivir, six were shown to have influenza and three did not. Only 13% of children hospitalised with influenza were treated with antivirals. The use of rapid diagnostic tests, which are infrequently used in Australia, may increase the use of antivirals, decrease antibiotic prescriptions and reduce the influenza burden in those children at risk of severe disease and mortality.36, 37\n",

It was also demonstrated that of the children with influenza who attended school or day care, 77.6% were reported to have at least one absence. As the employment status of parents was unknown, it was not possible to determine the proportion of working parents who were absent, but in families with two working parents, the social impact is likely to be greater than in families with one or no working parents. The duration of absence estimate is somewhat higher than in the existing literature, with estimates by Tsolia et al and Principi et al14, 17 being 1.3 days and 1.2 days.

This represents a high burden on health services with associated economic costs. The rate of hospitalisation for children with influenza and other viruses must be interpreted with caution, as children presenting to ED and hospitalised were both actively recruited. The higher rate of hospitalisation seen with other respiratory viruses was not significant when only children enrolled in ED prior to hospitalisation were included. Despite the limitations, these data are still useful in comparing the impact between influenza and non\u2010influenza ILI, and also for ascertaining average duration of hospitalisation among children admitted with influenza, which was found to be 2.23 days.",

Also, parents of children who were severely unwell may not have been approached by research assistants or less willing to participate, thereby affecting the overall disease severity of the sample. Other limitations included data collection being via parental report rather than through medical record verification, decreasing accuracy of the reported clinical outcomes.
