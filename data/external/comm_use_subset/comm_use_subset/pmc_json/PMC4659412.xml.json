These communities are an integral part of our commensal airway microbiota and likely contribute to infection and disease. HRV infection and the subsequent host response [11\u201314] change the upper airway local environment and will likely alter the microbiota composition. Insights into HRV induced changes in microbiota composition could contribute to our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of bacterial super-infection and could help to predict secondary bacterial infections thereby ultimately contributing to preventive strategies and tools. Most human studies to date have been retrospective, showing epidemiological correlations between HRV and the presence of potential respiratory pathogens [15\u201317]. Such correlation, however, do not necessarily implicate causality and interpretation of these data warrants caution. Most studies of the lung microbiota have been cross-sectional, observational and descriptive in nature [18].",

However, in contrast with our findings, the microbiota of HRV infected healthy volunteers (i.e. without COPD) from the study by Molyneaux et al. did not seem to be affected [32] which may be explained by differences in study design, e.g. the use of sputum specimens vs. throat swabs. Interestingly, in asymptomatic Aboriginal children the presence of HRV was significantly associated with the presence of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis in nasopharyngeal aspirates [15]. In a Dutch cohort of otitis-prone children, HRV positivity was significantly associated with the presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis in the nasopharynx, but not with that of H. influenzae [17].

Although a number of these direct interactions have been identified, their role during HRV infection remains to be elucidated [35]. The present new data on culture-independent classification of bacteria present in the throat during upper respiratory tract infection contributes to the understanding of upper respiratory tract microbial communities during HRV16 infection, and possible polymicrobial interactions.",

Some limitations are inherent to 454 sequencing of 16S genes in general. They include possible bias introduced by the extraction, amplification and sequencing methodologies. Finally the number of genomic 16S copies varies considerably from bacteria to bacteria. Currently there is insufficient knowledge about exact 16S copy numbers to correct for this [36].",
