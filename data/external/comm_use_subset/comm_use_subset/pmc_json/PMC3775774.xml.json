Wild birds are believed to constitute the natural reservoir for IAVs and play a central role in the spread of the viruses.",

All highly pathogenic avian IAVs known to date belong to the H5 or H7 subtype [4]. The H7N9 viruses, a subgroup of H7 viruses that normally spread among birds have currently been found to cause human infections in China, prompting intensive research to address the challenge of a potential epidemic/pandemic. Although H7N9 family clusters have been reported in Shanghai and Shandong Province [5], no evidence of human-to-human H7N9 virus transmission has been found to date [6]. Presently, there is a general lack of information about H7N9 infections, e.g., the transmission mechanism and the number of mild infections in China are unknown. Unlike H5N1, which could wipe out a flock of poultry within days, H7N9 infections in poultry are usually asymptomatic or mild. Nonetheless, based on what has been learned from the H5N1 avian flu virus which has killed 371 people in 15 countries since 2003 and proved extremely difficult to control, the risk of an H7N9 epidemic/pandemic should not be underestimated, especially in China where poultries are reared with diverse methods without strict biosecurity measures [7]. Studies on H7N9 transmission mechanisms and clinical features/outcomes are critical to prevent and control potential H7N9 epidemic/pandemic.",

The H7N9 variants currently in circulation most likely evolved through a combination of genes from viruses in Beijing bramblings, Zhejiang ducks, and Korean wild birds according to report by Chinese scientists. Human infections with highly pathogenic H7 viruses generally resulted in conjunctivitis or uncomplicated influenza [3], [8]. By April 30, 2013, confirmed cases of H7N9 infections had been reported in 11 provinces across the Yangtze Delta region of Eastern, Northern, and Southeast China. A total of 126 patients have been diagnosed with H7N9 infection and 24 patients have died since the first confirmed case was reported on April 24, 2013 in Taiwan. Among the 33 patients diagnosed in Shanghai, 21 have recovered while 12 died from complications caused by the infection, as confirmed by the Shanghai Municipal Health and Family Planning Commission. The clinical features, treatment, outcomes, and other factors associated with H7N9 infection have not been reported. From April 6 to April 20, 2013, 18 H7N9-infected patients were admitted into our hospital, which is one of the designated treatment centers for H7N9 infection in Shanghai. In the present article, we reported our observations of clinical features and clinical progress in H7N9-infected patients and interpreted factors related to treatment outcomes. The information provided herein could help early screening, diagnosis, and treatment of H7N9 infection and facilitate development of strategies to prevent death.",

Antibiotics given to H7N9-infected patients if applicable included moxifloxacin, sulbactam and cefoperazone, levofloxacin, meropenem, piperacillin, imipenem, and cilastatin. Some patients also received glucocorticoid therapy, intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, and TCM therapy. Only Chinese herbs prescribed according to specific syndromes were considered TCM in this study. Proprietary Chinese medicines and injections of Chinese medicines were excluded because they could contain certain western drug ingredients.

Seven patients, two from group A and five from group B had heart failure. Four patients experienced renal failure and three experienced septic shock, all from group B.

[8], [10], is of major public health significance. Laboratory testing conducted in China showed that H7N9 viruses were sensitive to anti-influenza drugs known as neuraminidase inhibitors. These drugs were effective against seasonal influenza and H5N1 virus infections when given early in the course of the illness. However, these drugs had not yet been used to treat H7N9 infections.",

China has released two editions of the influenza A H7N9 clinic programs in which supporting therapies including oxygen therapy, antipyretic therapy, and cough and phlegm relief and medicinal therapy with antiviral drugs such as oseltamivir and zanamivir were recommended. Particularly, respiratory support including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was recommended for critically ill patients. TCM therapy was also recommended as a second-line treatment for H7N9 infection. Previous studies have demonstrated that TCMs may have beneficial effects on patients with avian influenza [11], [12]. Our univariate logistic regression analysis indicated that the duration of TCM therapy could be partially associated with the prognosis in H7N9-infected patients. However, TCM therapy was not considered for four critically ill patients with ARDS, which might have accounted for the short duration of TCM therapy in the critically ill group. Consequently, the therapeutic value of TCM therapy in critically ill patients might have been underestimated. Further studies including randomized controlled trials are needed to fully evaluate TCM therapy in this patient population. Nine patients were also treated with intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG). Six of the nine patients recovered, one was in severe condition, and two died.",

The protective role of CD8+ T cells in AIV infections has been discussed in previous studies [20], [21]. It has been shown that CD8+ T cell-mediated responses in patients were mainly directed against conserved viral proteins, enabling CD8+ T cells to provide protection against heterologous influenza strains [22]. CD4+ T cells have also been reported to contribute to immunity against influenza. Previous studies showed that CD4+ T cells were induced after influenza virus infection and played a central role in acquired immunity through induction and maintenance of CD8+ memory T cells and assisting B cells in antibody production [23], [24]. CD45+ T cells were found to be not only essential for efficient T- and B-cell antigen receptor signal transduction but also involved in cytokine signaling [25], [26]. CD45KO mice and humans who lacked CD45 expression were severely immunodeficient and had very few peripheral T lymphocytes with impaired T and B cell responses [27]\u2013[29]. Results of our analysis suggested that T cell-mediated responses might play an important role in immune defense against H7N9 virus infection. Further studies on T cell-mediated responses during H7N9 infection might provide useful information to help develop effective therapies such as H7N9 vaccines.",
