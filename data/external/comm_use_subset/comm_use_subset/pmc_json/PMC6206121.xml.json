The study period spanned from 8 December 2009 to 5 June 2010. The study design and the details of field operations have been previously described [4\u20137]. Identifying who infects the infant with RSV in the household was the primary objective of the study [6]. Households were eligible if they had an infant born since the end of the previous RSV epidemic in the study location and at least 1 older sibling (aged <13 years). The study period spanned 1 complete RSV season [6]. Deep NPS collections were requested from all household members irrespective of symptoms, once weekly in the first 4 weeks and subsequently twice weekly for the remainder of the study period. Retention of households and individuals in the study was >80% [6].",

HCoV had 2 major peaks, 1 in February and 1 in May, and a minor peak in early April 2010. The major peaks were mainly linked with increased detection of both HCoV-OC43 and -NL63 while the minor peak was composed only of HCoV-OC43. Throughout the study, adenoviruses had a consistently high prevalence with no apparent peak times. The prevalence of RV was at its peak in January, gradually declined over the study period, and was at its lowest at the end of May 2010. The observed seasonal patterns were evident even after aggregating the data to assess the weekly detection rates of the viruses at sample, individual, or household level (Figure 4). From the 6 households with full respiratory virus screen, similar seasonal patterns were observed, albeit with greater variability (Supplementary Figure 2). The PIVs, influenza viruses, and HMPV were rarely detected throughout the 6-month study period (Supplementary Figure 2), and this was also observed from the hospital virus surveillance (Supplementary Figure 1).",

This demonstrates the extraordinarily enabling environment for virus spread coherent with earlier reports for RSV infections [5\u20137].

The individual attack rates declined with increasing age for most of the target pathogens, most likely due to acquisition of immunity following previous infections. School-going children are usually respiratory virus introducers to households [6, 24], but did not seem to have higher individual attack rates compared to non-school-goers for the studied viruses. Fathers had consistently and significantly lower attack rates compared with mothers. In this community, fathers are likely to have fewer interactions with the young infants and children relative to mothers, which could partly explain the disparity in attack rates. Empirical data on contact patterns within households might help elucidate this observation. Individuals in larger households (>7 members) had lower attack rates than in smaller households, and this pattern was significant for RV, AdV, and RSV. This may be related to the structure of households, which comprise 1 or more building units, and larger occupancy would tend to have more building units, between which there may be less interaction than in a single-building household.",

A surveillance over a longer period and investigating a wider range of respiratory viruses would provide more comprehensive data on virus circulation. Multiple years of study would compensate for year-to-year variation. Second, our sample was households with infants, so it might be possible that households without infants would have a lower prevalence. Third, only a small number of households had their samples subjected to full respiratory screen. Given the clustering of respiratory infections by households, it is possible that a different set of households might have resulted in an additional choice of targets for screening. However, the similarities in circulation of the respiratory viruses in the community study and the hospital surveillance do not support this view. Last, virus infection was deduced from molecular diagnostics, which do not necessarily equate with the presence of potentially infectious virus, leading to overestimation of infectiousness.

The remarkable frequency of virus infections of multiple species and strains lends itself to an ecological analysis of interactions that may be influential in virus ecology. The etiology of respiratory disease and immunological burden of respiratory viruses in children is worthy of further study.
