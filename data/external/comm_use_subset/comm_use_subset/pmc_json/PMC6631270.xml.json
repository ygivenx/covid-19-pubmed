The disease is commonly referred to as \u201cShipping fever\u201d and causes an increase in morbidity mortality rates [1]. The multiple factors that cause BRDC include stress, infectious agents, immunity, and housing conditions. The infectious agents associated with BRDC include viruses, bacteria, and mycoplasmas [2,3]. While most acute infections with uncomplicated infectious agents are sub-clinical, they can cause respiratory disease characterized by a cough, fever, and nasal discharge [4]. Mixed infections with two or more infectious agents are thought to contribute to BRDC [5]. The primary viral infectious pathogens that cause BRDC are bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (BPIV3), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine alphaherpesvirus 1 (BHV-1), bovine coronavirus (BCV), and so forth [6,7].",

BPIV3 induces respiratory tract damage and immunosuppression. More severe secondary bacterial and mycoplasma infections are caused in susceptible animals in instances of high stress, such as transportation and feedlot situations [4].",

Multiple BPIV3 genotype A strains have been isolated in USA, China, Argentina, and Japan [8,10,12,16]. Genotype B was initially identified in Australia [6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16]. Isolation of BPIV3 genotype C, first identified in China, has also been conducted in South Korea, Japan, Argentina, and USA [5,8,10,11,15,16]. A high seropositivity rate for BPIV3 in dairy cattle indicated that a high level of BPIV3 infections occurs. Many efforts have been made focusing on the prevention and control of BRDC in order to reduce production losses in the livestock industry [17,18].",

The diversity of BPIV3 in China seems to mirror the diversity of this virus, which is observed in the USA [8,11,15]. In addition, the full characterization of our BPIV3 genotype A strain will lend support to molecular diagnoses and to future studies aimed at developing an efficient vaccine against multiple viral lineages.",

Although there are few BPIV3 complete genomes available, the genetic divergence of strains of genotype A suggests that this genotype is continuously disseminated in distinct countries. Our study showed that the diversity of genotype A strains in China was likely affected by incoming strains from the USA. Because China imports large amounts of beef resources from the USA and the European Union, it is quite reasonable that this trade has impacted the spread of BPIV3 of genotype A to the region. Furthermore, there are also some levels of imported or smuggled live cattle from abroad and this will certainly have had a direct impact on the maintenance of distinct BPIV3 strains in China.
