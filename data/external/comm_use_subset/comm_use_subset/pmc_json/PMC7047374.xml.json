It is reported that the virus might be bat origin [2], and the transmission of the virus might related to a seafood market (Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market) exposure [3, 4]. The genetic features and some clinical findings of the infection have been reported recently [4\u20136]. Potentials for international spread via commercial air travel had been assessed [7]. Public health concerns are being paid globally on how many people are infected and suspected.",

            "text": "The BHRP transmission network model was posted to bioRxiv on 19 January, 2020 [12]. We assumed that the virus transmitted among the bats, and then transmitted to unknown hosts (probably some wild animals). The hosts were hunted and sent to the seafood market which was defined as the reservoir of the virus. People exposed to the market got the risks of the infection (Fig. 1). The BHRP transmission network model was based on the following assumptions or facts:\nThe bats were divided into four compartments: susceptible bats (SB), exposed bats (EB), infected bats (IB), and removed bats (RB). The birth rate and death rate of bats were defined as nB and mB. In this model, we set \u0245B = nB \u00d7 NB as the number of the newborn bats where NB refer to the total number of bats. The incubation period of bat infection was defined as 1/\u03c9B and the infectious period of bat infection was defined as 1/\u03b3B. The SB will be infected through sufficient contact with IB, and the transmission rate was defined as \u03b2B.The hosts were also divided into four compartments: susceptible hosts (SH), exposed hosts (EH), infected hosts (IH), and removed hosts (RH). The birth rate and death rate of hosts were defined as nH and mH. In this model, we set \u0245H = nH \u00d7 NH where NH refer to the total number of hosts. The incubation period of host infection was defined as 1/\u03c9H and the infectious period of host infection was defined as 1/\u03b3H. The SH will be infected through sufficient contact with IB and IH, and the transmission rates were defined as \u03b2BH and \u03b2H, respectively.The SARS-CoV-2 in reservoir (the seafood market) was denoted as W. We assumed that the retail purchases rate of the hosts in the market was a, and that the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the purchases was IH/NH, therefore, the rate of the SARS-CoV-2 in W imported form the hosts was aWIH/NH where NH was the total number of hosts. We also assumed that symptomatic infected people and asymptomatic infected people could export the virus into W with the rate of \u03bcP and \u03bc\u2019P, although this assumption might occur in a low probability. The virus in W will subsequently leave the W compartment at a rate of \u03b5W, where 1/\u03b5 is the lifetime of the virus.The people were divided into five compartments: susceptible people (SP), exposed people (EP), symptomatic infected people (IP), asymptomatic infected people (AP), and removed people (RP) including recovered and death people. The birth rate and death rate of people were defined as nP and mP. In this model, we set \u0245P = nP \u00d7 NP where NP refer to the total number of people. The incubation period and latent period of human infection was defined as 1/\u03c9P and 1/\u03c9\u2019P. The infectious period of IP and AP was defined as 1/\u03b3P and 1/\u03b3\u2019P. The proportion of asymptomatic infection was defined as \u03b4P. The SP will be infected through sufficient contact with W and IP, and the transmission rates were defined as \u03b2W and \u03b2P, respectively. We also assumed that the transmissibility of AP was \u03ba times that of IP, where 0 \u2264 \u03ba \u2264 1.",

            "text": "The parameters were estimated based on the following facts and assumptions:\nThe mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.1\u20137.0) [3]. We set the same value (5.2 days) of the incubation period and the latent period in this study. Thus, \u03c9P = \u03c9\u2019P = 0.1923.There is a mean 5-day delay from symptom onset to detection/hospitalization of a case (the cases detected in Thailand and Japan were hospitalized from 3 to 7 days after onset, respectively) [19\u201321]. The duration from illness onset to first medical visit for the 45 patients with illness onset before January 1 was estimated to have a mean of 5.8 days (95% CI: 4.3\u20137.5) [3]. In our model, we set the infectious period of the cases as 5.8 days. Therefore, \u03b3P = 0.1724.Since there was no data on the proportion of asymptomatic infection of the virus, we simulated the baseline value of proportion of 0.5 (\u03b4P = 0.5).Since there was no evidence about the transmissibility of asymptomatic infection, we assumed that the transmissibility of asymptomatic infection was 0.5 times that of symptomatic infection (\u03ba = 0.5), which was the similar value as influenza [22]. We assumed that the relative shedding rate of AP compared to IP was 0.5. Thus, c = 0.5.Since 14 January, 2020, Wuhan City has strengthened the body temperature detection of passengers leaving Wuhan at airports, railway stations, long-distance bus stations and passenger terminals. As of January 17, a total of nearly 0.3 million people had been tested for body temperature [23]. In Wuhan, there are about 2.87 million mobile population [24]. We assumed that there was 0.1 million people moving out to Wuhan City per day since January 10, 2020, and we believe that this number would increase (mainly due to the winter vacation and the Chinese New Year holiday) until 24 January, 2020. This means that the 2.87 million would move out from Wuhan City in about 14 days. Therefore, we set the moving volume of 0.2 million per day in our model. Since the population of Wuhan was about 11 million at the end of 2018 [25], the rate of people traveling out from Wuhan City would be 0.018 (0.2/11) per day. However, we assumed that the normal population mobility before January 1 was 0.1 times as that after January 10. Therefore, we set the rate of people moving into and moving out from Wuhan City as 0.0018 per day (nP = mP = 0.0018).The parameters bP and bW were estimated by fitting the model with the collected data.At the beginning of the simulation, we assumed that the prevalence of the virus in the market was 1/100000.Since the SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus, we assumed that it could be died in the environment in a short time, but it could be stay for a longer time (10 days) in the unknown hosts in the market. We set \u03b5 = 0.1.",

There was a research showed that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was 2.68 (95% CI: 2.47\u20132.86) [8]. Another research showed that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was 2.2 (95% CI: 1.4\u20133.9) [3]. The different values might be due to the different methods. The methods which Li et al. employed were based on the epidemic growth rate of the epidemic curve and the serial interval [3]. Our previous study showed that several methods could be used to calculate the R0 based on the epidemic growth rate of the epidemic curve and the serial interval, and different methods might result in different values of R0 [26]. Our results also showed that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was 2.30 from reservoir to person which was lower than that of person to person. This means that the transmission route was mainly from person to person rather than from reservoir to person in the early stage of the transmission in Wuhan City. However, this result was based on the limited data from a published literature, and it might not show the real situation at the early stage of the transmission.",

Therefore, we believe that the commonly acceptable average value of the R0 of SARS might be 2.9 [30]. The transmissibility of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is much lower than SARS. The reported value of the R0 of MERS was about 0.8\u20131.3 [31], with the inter-human transmissibility of the disease was about 0.6 or 0.9 in Middle East countries [32]. However, MERS had a high transmissibility in the outbreak in the Republic of Korea with the R0 of 2.5\u20137.2 [33, 34].

We simulated the natural history of the infection that the proportion of asymptomatic infection was 50%, and the transmissibility of asymptomatic infection was half of that of symptomatic infection, which were different to those of MERS and SARS. It is known that the proportion of asymptomatic infection of MERS and SARS was lower than 10%. Secondly, the parameters of population mobility were not from an accurate dataset. Thirdly, since there was no data of the initial prevalence of the virus in the seafood market, we assumed the initial value of 1/100 000. This assumption might lead to the simulation been under- or over-estimated. In addition, since we did not consider the changing rate of the individual\u2019s activity (such as wearing masks, increasing social distance, and not to travel to Wuhan City), the estimation of importation of the virus might not be correct. All these limitations will lead to the uncertainty of our results.
