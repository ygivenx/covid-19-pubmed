Some estimates indicate that more than 100 countries are affected and more than 390 million people become infected each year, with approximately 20,000 deaths [1]. The disease is caused by dengue virus, resulting in a growing and uncontrolled infection transmitted by mosquitos of the Aedes genus. The disease is a serious public health concern, causing a range of clinical manifestations from mild febrile illness in primary infections to the deadly severe dengue in secondary infections [2]. The epidemiological situation is complex in many affected countries due to the intense transmission rate, the coexistence of up to four serotypes, high vector invasiveness, and increased global human mobility.",

The development of effective vaccines against dengue virus is technically challenging as it must induce a balanced immune protection against all four serotypes [4,5]. Additionally, there is no specific antiviral therapy approved for patients with dengue disease other than general symptomatic treatment [6]. Since there is no approved antiviral against this virus, the identification of new antivirals is an important endeavor. Although the viremia is short-lived in dengue patients, the use of effective antivirals might be very useful in the case of severe dengue, as high viremia has been shown to correlate with severity [7].",

We found that a modification of our recently developed N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA)-catalyzed synthesis of 2-substituted quinolines [25] provided optimal yields and purity of quinolines 4 and 5 from 8-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide (3), although the copper-catalyzed reaction of Grignard reagents [26] gave similar results (Scheme 1). Using the TMEDA-catalyzed reaction, 2-alkylated quinolines 4 and 5 were isolated in 54 and 79% yields, respectively. Subsequent chlorination with N-chlorosuccinimide (NCS) under acidic conditions afforded the desired quinolines 1 and 2 in 78 and 80% yields, respectively Scheme 1 and Supplementary Materials). The final purity of both compounds 1 and 2 was verified to be higher than 97%.",

The compounds were added at the pre-infection period, during the infection, or at different time points after the infection (1 h, 3 h, 5 h, or 8 h). Then, infected cultures were maintained, and supernatants collected at 48 h post-infection. The determination of viral titers in these supernatants may indicate at which stage of the viral life cycle the compounds may be acting. Compound 1 showed maximal impairment of the DENV2 infection when present from 1 h post-infection, losing effect gradually when added at later time points (Figure 4A). The effect of this compound was not significant when added at the pre-infection period or during the adsorption phase only, suggesting that its action is not due to virucidal activity. While not significantly different from the virus control, compound 1 did show a small effect on virus infectivity when added only during the adsorption phase, suggesting some possible virucidal activity or impairment of the attachment/entry process. Compound 2 also significantly reduced the viral yield when present from the 1 h time point (Figure 4B). Similarly, its effect was not noticeable when added at pre-infection or during the viral adsorption. These results suggest that both compounds act, at least, affecting the early events of the virus life cycle.",
