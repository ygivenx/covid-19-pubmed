RSV is a common cause of acute lower respiratory tract infections in young children and the elderly, and in 2015 resulted in an estimated 94,000\u2013149,000 deaths globally in children under the age of five [2]. Although few deaths of children in the United States are attributed to RSV [2, 3], severe infections requiring hospitalization are frequent and lead to estimated direct health care costs of $750 million dollars annually [4]. Currently, there is no vaccine for RSV and the only FDA-approved therapy is passive prophylaxis with the monoclonal antibody palivizumab (Synagis) [5]. However, the high cost and modest efficacy of palivizumab restricts its usage to high-risk infants [6], making the development of improved interventions a global health priority.",

There are two subtypes of RSV, A and B, to which many individual strains belong. RSV has two major glycoproteins on the viral surface important for entry: the fusion (F) and attachment (G) glycoproteins [7]. Whereas RSV G is the primary source of sequence variation and defines the subtype of a specific virus, the fusion glycoprotein is well conserved with sequence identities >90% [8]. RSV F is a class I fusion glycoprotein initially produced as an inactive precursor, F0, that is subsequently cleaved by furin-like proteases to generate a protomer of disulfide-linked subunits, F1 and F2 [9\u201312]. Three of these protomers associate to form the functional trimeric glycoprotein required for membrane fusion and infection [13\u201315]. Numerous vaccine trials for RSV are currently underway [16], many of which contain the RSV F glycoprotein as an antigen because it has been shown that F is a major target of neutralizing antibodies [17, 18] and is the only protein on the viral surface that is strictly required for entry [19, 20].",

            "text": "RSV F initially folds into a metastable prefusion conformation, with fusion peptides buried within the central cavity of the trimer [8]. During viral entry, RSV F triggers to undergo a dramatic conformational rearrangement from the prefusion to postfusion state. The triggering process results in release of the fusion peptides from the central cavity of the trimer and their insertion into the target-cell membrane, resulting in the formation of an unstable prehairpin intermediate. Collapse of this intermediate into the stable postfusion conformation brings the virus and host-cell membranes together, facilitating formation of a fusion pore and release of the viral genome into the target cell [7, 15]. However, the mechanism and underlying cause of RSV F triggering is not well understood. Recombinant virus expressing only the RSV F protein on its surface is sufficient for infection of immortalized cell lines in vitro, suggesting that RSV F can facilitate attachment and mediate fusion in the absence of the attachment glycoprotein [7, 20\u201322]. Potential RSV F receptors include nucleolin, EGFR, and heparan sulfate proteoglycans, among others [7, 23\u201327], but the specific role each may play in the setting of natural infection remains to be defined. In addition, in vitro experiments have demonstrated that RSV F has a propensity to trigger upon exposure to elevated temperatures [28] and hypo-osmotic conditions [29], and RSV F has even been shown to spontaneously trigger and refold over time due to the metastable nature of the prefusion conformation [30]. This raises the possibility that RSV F does not have a specific receptor that initiates triggering and fusion, but rather that spontaneous triggering in the presence of attachment factors, such as heparan sulfate proteoglycans [31], is sufficient for entry.",

Antigenic site \u00d8 is located at the membrane-distal apex of the trimer and includes the \u03b14-helix and the loop connecting \u03b14 to \u03b15 (\u03b14\u2013\u03b15 loop) of F1, and the F2 loop between \u03b22 and \u03b11.

Comparison of the neutralization potency of two site \u00d8 antibodies, D25 [34] and 5C4 [35], with palivizumab, a site II-directed conformation-independent antibody [36], demonstrated that the prefusion-specific antibodies are 10\u2013100 times more potent [8].

Recently, the structure of 5C4 bound to RSV F was determined, revealing a nearly identical conformation of prefusion RSV F as that observed in the D25-bound structure [42]. However, crystal structures of the different prefusion-stabilized variants of RSV F have revealed an alternative conformation of antigenic site \u00d8 or weak electron density in this region, suggesting that this site is flexible. Currently, it is unclear if flexibility in this region is an inherent property of prefusion RSV F that may be important for triggering membrane fusion [41], or if it is related to inadequate stabilization of site \u00d8 in the engineered variants [40]. Therefore, we sought to investigate the conformational plasticity of site \u00d8 by determining and comparing the crystal structures of prefusion RSV F in complex with AM22 and RSD5. Our results demonstrate that prefusion RSV F adopts at least three alternative conformations of site \u00d8 and that potently neutralizing human antibodies can recognize the alternative conformations using distinct binding modes. This suggests that site \u00d8 samples an ensemble of conformations in vivo, at least some of which can be recognized by neutralizing human antibodies. These results should influence future vaccine designs and may have implications for the mechanism of RSV F triggering.",

However, differences in antibody kinetics and subtype specificities have not been fully explored. Therefore, we used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to determine the binding affinity and kinetics of the interaction between three site \u00d8 antibodies (AM22, D25, and RSD5) and prefusion RSV F derived from each subtype (strains A2 and B9320) (Fig 1). For these studies, we worked with a germline-reverted version of RSD5 (RSD5-GL), which had 20 somatic mutations in the framework regions reverted to germline residues to minimize immunogenicity (S1 Fig). Of note, RSD5-GL showed similar neutralization potency and binding kinetics for prefusion RSV F as compared to the parental RSD5 antibody (RSD5-WT) (S2 Fig). Despite similar neutralization potencies, AM22, D25, and RSD5 displayed distinct affinities and binding kinetics when compared to each other as well as when compared individually across the two RSV subtypes. The AM22 antigen-binding fragment (Fab) has an ~50-fold higher affinity for subtype A with an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 0.12 nM, whereas its affinity for subtype B is 6.1 nM. Similarly, D25 Fab binds tightly to prefusion RSV F with a slight preference for subtype A, consistent with previously published data [43], having a KD of <0.064 nM and 0.33 nM for subtype A and B, respectively. In contrast, RSD5-GL Fab has substantial subtype specificity with a >2,000-fold stronger affinity for subtype B compared to subtype A, with a KD of <0.016 nM and 34 nM, respectively. Preferential binding of RSD5-GL for subtype B is primarily due to the off-rate, which is fast for the subtype A interaction and slow for the subtype B interaction.",

The high affinity and specificity of AM22 for prefusion RSV F (Fig 1 and S3 Fig) is due to the formation of a three-strand anti-parallel \u03b2-sheet between the CDR H3 of AM22 and \u03b14\u2013\u03b15 loop of F1 (Fig 2B). When bound by AM22, the \u03b14-helix kinks near residue Pro205 and shifts away from \u03b15, stretching the \u03b14\u2013\u03b15 loop and allowing it to adopt a \u03b2-strand conformation that pairs with the \u03b2-hairpin formed by the CDR H3 of AM22.

The Lys209 side chain of subtype A prefusion RSV F is coordinated by three residues of the AM22 heavy chain. This includes the formation of a salt bridge with Asp100G of the CDR H3 that effectively extends the prominent \u03b2-sheet interaction. Substitution of Lys209 with Gln, as found in subtype B, would eliminate the salt bridge and may explain the subtype A preference of AM22. Indeed, incorporating the K209Q substitution in subtype A prefusion RSV F results in a decreased affinity of AM22 with a KD of 6.7 nM (S4 Fig), which closely matches the KD of 6.1 nM for subtype B.",

This structure closely matches the unbound prefusion-stabilized RSV F variants DS-Cav1 (PDB ID: 4MMU) and PR-DM (PDB ID: 5C69 [41]), specifically the kink in the \u03b14-helix and greater angle between \u03b14 and \u03b15. In contrast, the prefusion RSV F\u2013D25 structure has a more closed conformation of site \u00d8, where \u03b14 does not kink out and there is a smaller angle between \u03b14 and \u03b15. The structure of DS-Cav1 bound to RSD5-GL reveals an intermediate site \u00d8 conformation, with the \u03b14-helix only slightly kinked out and away from \u03b15, but not to the same degree as seen in the AM22 complex. Because all three of these antibodies were isolated from humans who had experienced natural RSV infection, these structures indicate that site \u00d8 is naturally flexible and adopts at least three states that can be recognized by the human immune system. It is also possible, and perhaps more likely, that site \u00d8 exists as an ensemble of many conformations, three of which were trapped by these antibodies. Analysis of published crystal structures of prefusion RSV F in complex with neutralizing antibodies targeting various antigenic sites further supports an ensemble of site \u00d8 conformations (S5 Fig).",

AM22 and D25 both preferentially bind to subtype A, whereas RSD5 preferentially binds to subtype B as a result of its fast dissociation rate constant for subtype A F proteins. In addition, previous publications using SPR and flow cytometry-based competition assays have suggested that AM22 and RSD5 do not compete with D25, but rather occupy a separate prefusion-specific epitope [37, 38]. However, comparing the crystal structures of prefusion RSV F bound to AM22, RSD5-GL, and D25, demonstrates that all three antibody epitopes overlap substantially and would prevent any two from binding simultaneously due to large steric clashes. This emphasizes the importance of structural characterization of antibody epitopes in addition to competition data, as varying antibody kinetics can mislead epitope classification when using only competition assays.",

When only the fusion peptide was anchored by a disulfide bond in the DS structure (PDB ID: 4MMQ), site \u00d8 was conformationally heterogeneous as indicated by the lack of electron density. However, site \u00d8 cavity-filling mutations introduced in the Cav1 (PDB ID: 4MMS) or DS-Cav1 (PDB ID: 4MMU) variants stabilized the prefusion RSV F structure and showed clear electron density extending from the fusion peptide through site \u00d8. Taken together, this suggests that movement of the fusion peptide is conditional upon prior rearrangement of site \u00d8. The only discrepancy between the crystal structures of wild-type prefusion RSV F when bound to D25 and the prefusion-stabilized variant DS-Cav1 is the kinked-open conformation of \u03b14 in the DS-Cav1 model, which was attributed to the cavity-filling V207L mutation being unable to fully stabilize the \u03b14-helix [40]. However, the structure reported here of DS-Cav1 in complex with the human antibody AM22 matches the unbound DS-Cav1 structure and demonstrates that this conformation is a naturally sampled alternative conformation of prefusion RSV F.",

            "text": "Recent vaccine strategies targeting viruses with class I fusion proteins have focused on stabilizing the prefusion conformation of the fusion protein for use as an immunogen. A common approach to achieve prefusion stabilization has been through introduction of one or more proline residues within the loop of a helix-loop-helix motif that refolds into a continuous alpha helix in the postfusion conformation. This strategy has been used successfully to stabilize several class I viral fusion glycoproteins including RSV F, MPV F, influenza HA, HIV Env, and coronavirus Spike [41, 57\u201360]. Proline-based stabilization utilizes the restricted phi-psi angles of proline residues and disruption of the alpha-helix hydrogen bond network to inhibit the hinge motion required of the helix-loop-helix motif and the subsequent coil-to-helix structural transition required for refolding into the postfusion conformation. However, for wild-type prefusion RSV F there is a conserved proline residue (Pro205) within the middle of the \u03b14-helix, N-terminal to the \u03b14\u2013\u03b15 loop that may act as a hinge during refolding [41]. Crystal structures of prefusion RSV F demonstrate a variety of alternate conformations adopted by antigenic site \u00d8, all of which diverge near the conserved Pro205. This indicates that Pro205 may disfavor a rigid alpha-helical structure, which in turn facilitates conformational flexibility of site \u00d8 and the tendency of prefusion RSV F to trigger. We note that Pro205 is absolutely conserved in all human and bovine RSV strains, and a proline at an identical position is also commonly found in F proteins from viruses within the Pneumoviridae and Paramyxoviridae families, with the exception of human metapneumoviruses (Fig 5D). The functional importance of this well-conserved proline residue will need to be evaluated in future studies investigating the triggering mechanism and refolding of pneumovirus and paramyxovirus F proteins.",

RSD5 and RSD5-GL (fully germlined in VH and VL framework regions, as defined by IMGT) were produced by gene synthesis (GenScript) and confirmed by sequencing. Synthesized VH and VL sequences were cloned into human Ig\u03b31 and Ig\u03ba expression vectors (kindly provided by Michel Nussenzweig, Rockefeller University, New York, NY, USA), essentially as described [64]. Plasmids encoding antibody heavy and light chains for AM22, RSD5-WT, RSD5-GL, or for D25 were co-transfected into Expi293 cells or FreeStyle 293-F cells (Invitrogen). AM22 and D25 IgGs and Fabs were purified using Protein A agarose (Fisher) or CaptureSelect IgG-CH1 affinity matrix (Life Technologies), respectively. All IgG antibodies were eluted off the Protein A column using 0.1 M glycine pH 3.0 into a buffered solution containing 1/10 (v/v) of 1 M Tris pH 8.0. All Fabs were eluted off the CaptureSelect IgG-CH1 column using 50 mM acetic acid pH 4.0 into a buffered solution containing 1/10 (v/v) of 1 M Tris pH 8.0. To produce RSD5-WT Fab, RSD5-WT was expressed and purified as an IgG with an HRV 3C protease site in the hinge of the heavy chain. RSD5-WT Fab was produced by digesting the IgG with HRV 3C for 2 hours at room temperature, followed by passing the solution over protein A resin to remove the Fc, and subsequently purified by SEC using a Superdex 200 column (GE). Production of RSD5-GL Fab was done by incubating RSD5-GL IgG with papain beads (Pierce). All IgGs and Fabs were buffer exchanged using a desalting column, followed by final purification by SEC using a Superdex 200 column (GE) prior to long term storage at -80 \u00b0C.",

Specifically, we identified sequences that were indicated to be partially homologous with the residues 195\u2013214 of the hRSV fusion protein sequence derived from strain A2.

To prevent overrepresentation from viral species which have multiple subtypes sequenced, we only included a single amino acid sequence from each species when the multiple subtypes were >90% identical throughout the residue range corresponding to 195\u2013214 in hRSV F. However, if two subtypes within a single viral species differed by >10% in the residue range corresponding to 195\u2013214 in hRSV F, then they were both included when performing sequence analysis and generating the sequence WebLogo. For example, there are four sequenced strains of human metapneumovirus F, but they are all mostly identical and hence only two representative sequences were included in the final WebLogo (strain A1 and B1). However, there are multiple distinct sequences for the different types of parainfluenza virus (PIV), and therefore all the distinct sequences are included separately when generating the WebLogo. See S1 Table for a full list of sequences used in the WebLogo. The WebLogo was generated using publicly available software at weblogo.berkley.edu.",
