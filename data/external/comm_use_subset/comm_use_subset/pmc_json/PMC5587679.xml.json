However, a viral disease, \u201cviral nervous necrosis (VNN)\u201d has been reported across grouper production centers in Taiwan, Malaysia, Indonesia and elsewhere around Asia2, 3.

Moreover QTLs for resistance to NNV in Asian Sea Bass were reported13. However, notwithstanding such promising genetic selection opportunities, there are substantial knowledge gaps about the genetic diversity of NNV among Asian grouper hosts: are there many strains within and between regions, perhaps with different virulence so that each region or NNV strain may then require different selection programs, or not? Moreover, is there evidence that NNV strains vary over time? Genetic programs are long term and expensive undertakings so selecting for resistance to the appropriate strain/s is an important consideration, but one with a relative absence of knowledge for Asian grouper NNV. Without some clarity, we may select for inappropriate NNV strains, or see new NNVs transported from a different region for which the grouper have no resistance.",

Available Genbank data show all Asian grouper NNV RNA2 RNA sequences, from Japan to Indonesia, are very closely related, varying by just one or two percent; this closeness means there are challenges to determine phylogenetic relationships especially when using traditional DNA or RNA distance based methods. However, Lowenstein et al.16 have found for tuna that particular polymorphic nucleotide positions (characteristic attributes) may categorically discriminate groups/ species previous not previous distinguished using traditional analyses based on percent RNA or DNA similarity. Ruan et al.17 reported certain polymorphic nucleotide positions could discriminate among strains of the SARS virus while Zou et al.18 reported that \u201ccharacter based\u201d bar coding methods outperformed other approaches in discriminating closely related sea snails. Within aquaculture, these approaches of identifying nucleotides that are present in one group but not others have yet to be considered to a large degree, although our group have applied these ideas of characteristic attributes to recently resolve a very long standing taxonomic issue in oysters, whether the very closely related Crassostrea gigas and C. angulata are one or two species, as a prelude to conducting selection on the now identified C. angulata in Vietnam19.",

The second culling included given samples that came from the same location, year and host species as another sample (leaving only one sample per species in a given place and time); 55 samples were available after this round of culling. The intention was to remove cases that may represent propagation in a hatchery, so an exception to the rule is that wild fish samples even if from the same species and location were not culled at this stage. Last, the third culling was for samples that came from the same site and same year as other samples; 40 samples remained after this round of culling. At this stage, even different wild fish were culled if they came from the same site at the same year. Similar culling procedures applied when testing for \u201cspecies\u201d grouping, and for \u201cyear\u201d grouping. When a group contained only one case after culling, the single case was pooled with a neighbouring group (for region and year) or included in a group termed \u201cother\u201d for the species analyses.",

Even wild fish meeting these criteria were culled at this point. With these 40 samples, the incidence of significant cases was reduced somewhat, but even in this most extreme vetting, AMOVA analyses showed there were still a total of eight cases (nucleotide positions) with statistically significant differences among regions at P \u2264 0.05, a total of eight cases (nucleotide positions) with statistically significant differences among regions at P \u2264 0.01 and the test over all loci (all nucleotide positions) was significant (P \u2264 0.01) (Supplementary Fig. S5).

Actually, we found no evidence of such a hypothetical effect, and indeed there was slightly more variation in sequences from fish hosts than from cell cultures; moreover AMOVA tests did not show significant differences between the sequences from fish hosts and from cell lines. Accordingly, there does not appear to be any evidence based reason not to include the RNA sequences from cell cultures in our analyses on the grounds that they are intrinsically more variable, or intrinsically more different, than sequences from fish.",

Interestingly, the translated RNA2 sequences showed even less variation than the RNA with less evidence of region specific amino acid \u201cCATS\u201d; indeed most RNA \u201cCATS\u201d were found at codon position three which did not lead to changes in the capsid protein. Statistical tests indicated a very substantial excess of synonymous substitutions over nonsynonymous sites, indicating \u201cpurifying\u201d selection. Every node in the maximum likelihood tree for the protein sequences was not significant for clusters save one. A parsimonious model to account for this interesting discrepancy between the RNA sequence and the protein is that strains to some degree are geographically isolated and free to diverge especially at RNA triplet positions not tightly constrained by selection (i. e. most codon 3 positions), but those sites (RNA codon positions one and two) where changes can lead to changes in the capsid protein, are more tightly constrained by selection. Balancing all the evidence, the null hypothesis is that the regional Asian strains of NNV are functionally equivalent which may give encouragement that selection for resistance in one region will lead to fish capable of resisting NNV in another. Indeed various have reported that all RGNNV strains that were tested in Asian and Europe were serologically related (within each region) and had the same serotype despite different RNA genotypes, further supporting the hypothesis that selection for one RGNNV RNA genotype will give rise to resistance for all within a region29, 30. If this hypothesis is confirmed, then variation evident in the RNA sequences and \u201cCATs\u201d may become less relevant to the issue of genetic selection, but still may inform about the epidemiology of the pathogen (see following).",

By showing the existence of regional strains of RGNNV in Asian marine fish for the first time, our study points to the existence of regional, endemic sources of NNV that may recurrently infect local hatcheries. This understanding is consistent with reports of finding NNV in wild fish31. So in addition to taking precautions not to import NNV along with imported broodstock, grouper hatcheries may also now consider the possibility that NNV can enter the hatcheries from local reservoirs from local wild fish carrying NNV.",
