            "text": "Remarkable progress has been achieved in China since the National Malaria Elimination Action Plan was launched in 2010, and reported malaria cases have declined rapidly; only 3116 malaria cases were reported in 2015 [1, 2]. However, the number of annual imported malaria cases has increased significantly in recent years because of increasing numbers of laborers and businessmen who work in Africa and other malaria-endemic areas [3, 4]. It is essential to detect all malaria cases in a timely manner for follow-up and foci treatment to prevent transmission or re-introduction. Timely diagnosis is also important prior to malaria treatment, especially for falciparum malaria, for which severe symptoms and death can occur without timely treatment with anti-malaria drugs [5, 6]. Furthermore, an accurate malaria diagnosis is crucial for the subsequent focal treatment to combat specific parasite species; this aspect is one of the most important issues for preventing secondary transmission and eliminating malaria in China [7]. After the severe global SARS epidemic in 2003 [8], CDCs from the national to lower levels in China were rapidly established and developed [9]. These CDCs replaced the former sanitation and anti-epidemic stations in China, and the current network for malaria control and elimination is based on this system (Fig. 1). Independent or combined departments from the national to lower-level CDCs (or institutes of parasitic diseases) are responsible for malaria control and elimination; in addition, hospitals at all levels in China are involved. All the CDCs and hospitals are managed under health departments from the national health and family planning commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China (MOH) to the township governments. In this province, the regular refresher training courses are organized by both provincial and prefecture level every year to maintain the microscopical test skills from the majority of the counties\u2019 level, and there are two mutual-checking microscopists meetings every year, in which the microscopists from all the 13 prefectures bring their positive and negative slides and checked by each other, in addition, the quality control system for the whole provincial microscopical test has been established, provincial reference lab for malaria diagnosis collect the slides quarterly and reviewed the reading accuracy and feedback the result to the administrative department. The number of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) that are available and the scale of their use for malaria detection has increased rapidly over the past few years; however, RDTs have a relatively poor detection rate for asymptomatic malaria cases with low parasite densities [10\u201312]. In addition, limited RDT products for malaria have been registered with the State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) in China; therefore, microscopic examination is still the first choice for malaria diagnosis in most parts of China. In this study, malaria diagnosis in Jiangsu Province and a selected prefecture (Nantong) in central Jiangsu Province was investigated (Fig. 2). The blood smear preparation and interpretation skills of the staff at local public health departments were also assessed. Moreover, medical departments at the county and township levels were evaluated in 2013 and 2014 to identify surveillance challenges to malaria elimination and to prevent re-introduction.",

Ten indicators, including the blood volume, position, diameter, appearance, staining and clearance for both thick and thin blood smears, were scored based on criteria issued by the national CDC in 2011 to assess blood smear preparation and staining for malaria parasites [13]. One point was given for each of the 10 indicators (blood volume, position, diameter, appearance, stain quality and clearance for both thick and thin blood smears) for one slide, and ten slides were thoroughly checked. In addition, five blood smears comprising the four main malaria parasite species and a negative were randomly distributed on-site and tested by a microscopist or clinician. Each smear was microscopically checked for eight minutes and scored; 12 points were given for the correct determination of a positive or negative infection with parasites (20 points for negative slides), followed by 8 points for species identification. To ensure fair scoring, two experts from the provincial reference laboratory for parasitic diseases at the Jiangsu Institute of Parasitic Diseases who passed the diagnostic assessment for malaria parasites and obtained certification from the World Health Organization participated in the investigation. The average score of these experts was used to assess the preparation and staining of the blood smears.",

After concerted efforts from the national to regional levels, malaria transmission has been well controlled recently, and only hundreds of malaria cases have been reported in Jiangsu annually [15\u201317], despite fluctuations after a re-emergence of vivax malaria in central China from 2004 to 2006 [18]. No additional local malaria cases have been observed and reported since 2011; however, the total number of malaria cases increased markedly in the last several years because of oversea laborers who export and trade in China but have contact with areas of endemic malaria [4]. Nantong Prefecture was selected in this study because it shows a pattern of malaria spread that this similar to that of the entire province and is a good current representative.",

            "text": "The \u201c1\u20133-7\u201d strategy for the surveillance of and response to malaria elimination was produced by Jiangsu Province and was recently adopted as the national policy for malaria elimination in China [19, 20]. This strategy is defined as the reporting of malaria cases within one day, their confirmation and investigation within three days, and the appropriate public health response to prevent further transmission within seven days. Reporting of information is the first and one of the most important steps for malaria elimination. The correct diagnosis, including malaria infection and detailed parasite species classification, plays very important roles in case verification and focal treatment. A misdiagnosis of a malaria species might lead to the use of inappropriate antimalarial drugs and secondary transmission by local malaria vectors in the absence of timely vector control measures such as IRS activity [21]. In this study, a relatively low reporting accuracy was found in terms of the P.v species from 13 prefectures in Jiangsu Province, and Anopheles sinensis, one of the most effective malaria vectors, especially for transmitting vivax species in China, is widely distributed in the entire province [22]. When the infection source accumulates without the correct foci treatment due to malarial case misdiagnosis, the infection can re-emerge. An impressive lesson demonstrating a re-emerging infection was observed in Greece, where a vivax malaria outbreak occurred in 2009 after malaria was declared eliminated in 1973 [23], in addtion, more countries including Italy, Cyprus and Costa Rica have reported the re-emerging infection recently (https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/).",

For example, each village has a village clinic with at least one doctor, where patients suspected of having malaria are advised to transfer to hospitals for parasite assessment and treatment as soon as possible, and there are specific sections/departments that are responsible for public health care, including malaria control and elimination, at health care institutions at the township and upper governmental levels. However, a lack of sufficient technology and ability has always affected the staff in malaria-associated departments, especially at lower levels. Furthermore, because the number of malaria cases is decreasing, less attention or financial support is directed to malaria control and elimination, making disease control worse at a basic level. In this study, there was a relatively high percentage of parasite species corrected by a provincial microscopy center from the cases that were reported by the sub-provincial organizations in Jiangsu in 2013 and 2014 (Table 1). In addition, many patients (23.14%) went to township and village hospitals but did not receive a confirmed diagnosis of malaria (Fig. 4), which indicates that capacity for diagnosis, including microscopy examination skills, should be improved.",

In this study, staff with higher education levels were more likely to be found at upper county levels than in townships. This study shows that staff at a county level, including county CDCs and county hospitals, exhibited much better skills than staff from township hospitals or PHCs in terms of parasite interpretation. In fact, a small percentage of the staff at township hospitals and PHCs could not differentiate falciparum from other species, which could place the current malaria elimination surveillance system at risk. In addition, the ability to prepare slides was also closely related to educational background. For example, microscopists with a bachelor degree had better blood smear preparation skills than those who graduated from a 2-year specialized secondary school. Consequently, it is imperative to encourage more young and promising graduates with a higher education level to join the malaria control and elimination network.",

In this study, a substantial number (more than 20%) of the malaria patients went first to the township or lower level to seek medical treatment because of febrile or other malaria-related symptoms. However, none of these patients received a confirmed diagnosis at the township and village level. This inability to diagnose malaria might represent the situation in the entire province, because similar results were found from reporting data in other cities in Jiangsu Province: a zero or a very low percentage of patients received malaria confirmation at the township or village level. The main reason for this lack of confirmation might be due to inadequate ability in the lower-level staff to microscopically distinguish plasmodium parasites from artifacts. In addition, because the staff in township hospitals in particular are responsible for many disease diagnoses and treatments, it is difficult to perform well under time constraints and a heavy workload, and poor quality blood smear preparation might result. Accordingly, periodic refresher training, frequent supervision, and the establishment of a testing program should be provided by a provincial reference laboratory to lower level personnel, especially in townships in the province, to maintain microscopic skills and ability. Additionally, an alternative approach, such as RDTs, should also be considered for use, particularly at the township and village levels, to avoid potential misdiagnoses and missed diagnoses of malaria, which may cause death in falciparum malaria cases due to the lack of timely and appropriate diagnosis and treatment.",
