In an earlier study, BuV was detected from the spleen tissues and faeces of shrews9. Therefore, we used nested-PCR targeting for the NS1 gene of BuV using 183 spleens and 96 faeces samples (faecal samples were unavailable for a subset of megabats). As shown in Table 1, BuV was identified in three spleen and nine faeces specimens from Pteropus vampyrus, and one spleen specimen from Pteropus sp. Among these, one Pteropus vampyrus in Magelang was positive for BuV in both the spleen and faeces. With a limited number of samples, the detection rate of BuV in spleen (2%) was lower than that in faeces (9%).",

A small number of sequence reads from MgBuV1, but not MgBuV2 and MgBuV3, enabled to amplify the overlapping large fragments by PCR and determine nearly the whole genome sequence, including the complete protein-coding region. The obtained genome sequence of MgBuV1 (accession number LC085675) was 4765 nt in size and encoded three complete ORFs: the non-structural protein (NS1) and the viral capsid proteins (VP1 and VP2). These proteins showed 46\u201361% amino acid sequence identities to those of other BuVs of which complete genome sequences were available (Table 2). Parvovirus-conserved amino acid motifs were found in each viral protein of MgBuV1 (Fig. 2). NS1 contained a putative endonuclease metal coordination motif \u201cHIH\u201d and the helicase motif Walker A \u201cGPASTGKS\u201d. The VP1 of most parvovirus species possesses a phospholipase A2 (PLA2) motif that is required for viral entry22. Three potential sites responsible for the enzymatic activity of PLA2 were strictly conserved in the VP1 of MgBuV1: a calcium-binding loop site \u201cYLGPG\u201d and two catalytic sites \u201cHDLEY\u201d and \u201cD\u201d. The N-terminus of the VP1 and VP2 of MgBuV1 had a glycine-rich motif (G-rich) required for the cellular entry of parvovirus23.",

These sequences covered a partial coding region of NS1 and almost complete to complete coding regions of VP1 and VP2 (Fig. 2). Therefore, using the coding region of VP2, we performed a phylogenetic analysis to infer the deeper phylogenetic relationships between these microbat-borne BuVs and megabat-borne MgBuV1 (Fig. 3). All microbat-borne BuVs formed a single cluster (group 5, Fig. 3). MgBuV1 branched from the common ancestor of human BuVs, non human primate-borne BuV (WUHARV parvovirus) and pig-borne BuV, and represented a distinct lineage of BuV (linage 4, Fig. 3). WUHARV parvovirus (linage 3, Fig. 3) fell into the cluster of human BuVs (group 2, Fig. 3), consistent with a previous study of past recombination events behind the origin of WUHARV parvovirus13.",

Both analyses suggested a mosaic genome structure in MgBuV1 and possible recombinations among ancestors of MgBuV1, WUHARV parvovirus and porcine parvovirus Zsana, around nucleotide positions 778 to 2384 of the MgBuV1 genome (Fig. 4C). These observations were supported by independent phylogenetic trees built from five regions bordered by the inferred recombination breakpoints (Fig. 5A\u2013E). Among the BuVs and related protoparvoviruses, MgBuV1 branched from the ancestor of porcine parvovirus Zsana in the phylogenetic tree at position 778 to 1219 (Fig. 5B) and position 1856 to 2384 (Fig. 5D). However, MgBuV1 branched from its ancestor WUHARV parvovirus at position 1219 to 1856 in the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 5C). In contrast, MgBuV1 formed a distinct lineage in phylogenetic trees constructed from position 2384 to 4765 (Fig. 5E). Based on this evidence, we inferred the parsimonious origin of the mosaic genome in MgBuV1 from both recombination analyses (Fig. 4C).",

In this study, we report for the first time, a BuV identified in megabats. MgBuV1 is the fourth animal borne-BuV where the whole genome sequence of the protein-coding region has been determined. In addition, the detection of partial NS1 gene sequences different from MgBuV1 (called MgBuV2 and MgBuV3) indicates the presence of MgBuV1 variants. The discovery of megabat-borne BuVs facilitates a better understanding of the diversity and host-range of BuV.",

To maximize the inferential power of the approach, the marginal likelihoods of the models assuming opposite topological hypotheses were compared with the stepping stone37 sampling approach implemented in MrBayes 3.2. Then, the difference of the calculated marginal likelihoods for both models, i.e., the model assuming a clustering and the model without the clustering, represented the Bayes factor, which usually is interpreted as supporting the first model if the difference exceeds three and strongly supportive when it exceeds five38. All hypotheses were tested under the same model assumed for the phylogenetic analyses.",
