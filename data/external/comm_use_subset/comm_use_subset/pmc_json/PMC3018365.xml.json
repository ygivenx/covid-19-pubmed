Unnecessary panic and disruption to society is more likely to be avoided and appropriately measured public health responses are more likely to take place when we have accurate information on the virulence and pathogenicity of an emerging disease. For these reasons, quantitative methods have been developed and continue to be developed to facilitate the assimilation of emerging data. Important quantities to estimate include the basic reproductive number, R0, defined as the average number of secondary infections created by a single infected individual in an entirely susceptible population. Numerous methods have been proposed for the estimation of this quantity, including deterministic and stochastic compartmental models [1], branching processes [2], networks [3,4], and, more recently, a likelihood based method [5,6].",

Clearly this assumption is more often than not violated in practice, especially when dealing with national or even regional data. For instance the scare surrounding the anthrax attacks in the fall of 2001 in the United States led to a large number of individuals reporting to medical care facilities with suspected anthrax. Should analysis have focused on suspected cases in that situation, the magnitude and threat of the event would have been greatly exaggerated. During the recent H1N1 outbreak, the number of suspected cases of disease likely is composed of several cases that will not be confirmed, however there are undoubtedly an even larger number of undetected cases, at least in the initial stages of the epidemic before the large public health response was launched and later on as the growth of the epidemic in many locations rendered it impossible to continue to track a large portion of the cases. Further, as the pandemic progressed sick individuals were cautioned to stay at home, rather than seek medical attention unless they were acutely ill [11], driving up the number of unreported cases. Several of the unreported initial cases could arise from individuals who are asymptomatic, but still carrying and transmitting the virus or from others whose illness was not sufficiently acute to warrant seeking medical attention. To our knowledge, the issue of the impact of this misspecification of the number of cases on the estimation of epidemic parameters has not been well-studied.",

In these cases it is likely that q1 <q2. This is the likely scenario initially in the current H1N1 outbreak, where cases were accumulating for some time before public announcements were made and increased surveillance was implemented. Numbers of confirmed cases available early on in the investigation likely underestimate the true number of cases dramatically. One can also imagine cases where q1 >q2. This might occur in instances of overreporting such as occur in times of panic, for instance following the scare after the anthrax attacks in 2001 in the US [13] when more than 20,000 individuals started antibiotics until it was determined that they did not have anthrax. Additionally if all suspected cases of H1N1 were considered early in the epidemic, this could possibly overestimate the true number of cases. Further, as time has progressed in the H1N1 pandemic, it has become virtually impossible to ascertain all cases. Therefore it is likely that reporting initially increased and then began to decrease again as case counts escalated.",

A similar approach could be used to improve estimates to account for suspected levels of misreporting. Clearly the need exists to use innovative methods to ascertain reporting issues in data using existing data, or by the collection of additional data or well-planned studies that can be rapidly initiated in the event of an outbreak. For instance, one might consider carefully studying a smaller population to determine the rate of reporting there. This could inform the overall rate of reporting.
