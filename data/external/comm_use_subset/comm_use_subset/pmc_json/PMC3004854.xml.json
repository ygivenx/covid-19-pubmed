The 2003 SARS epidemic, with a novel coronavirus variant diffusing widely while its biological identity was still unknown, is a paradigm that illustrates two essential requirements of biothreat preparedness: the ability to identify yet unknown agents, and to do it rapidly. The threat of deliberate release of infectious agents in areas where they are not generally encountered, or the natural evolution of novel combinations of genetic material, exemplified by the H1N1 2009 pandemic variant [1], further stress the need for rapid identification of unexpected agents. Efficient identification platforms must also cope with the large diversity of pathogens and the need to differentiate them from closely related non-pathogenic species [2].",

One strategy relies on the amplification and sequencing of conserved target genes, such as bacterial 16S rRNA genes or viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase genes. Even though broad range primers are used with success in many diagnostic and discovery applications, these approaches are limited in their phylogenetic span, fail to identify species with incompatible sequence variation in priming sites, and do not detect genetic reassortants. High throughput sequencing platforms offer a novel and powerful approach for identifying known or yet unknown pathogenic organisms [3], but the current time to results may still represent a limitation in the event of a public health emergency.",

One interesting feature of resequencing microarrays is the possibility to detect nucleic acids in a sample, even if their sequence diverges by up to 10\u201315% from those that are represented on the array [10], [11]. Therefore, even if a novel emerging agent would differ markedly from all known sequences, as was the case for the novel 2003 coronavirus [14], [15], it could be possible to detect it with precision. However, in face of the huge diversity of the microbial world [16], [17], there is a clear need to improve phylogenetic coverage by microarrays. In addition, both accuracy and sensitivity are expected to decrease with increasing levels of sequence mismatch between the microbial agent present in the sample and those represented on the microarray. Given that chip size and density are finite, the number of sequences that one array is able to detect must be increased by optimization of the covered sequence space. One solution is to tile sequences separated by an optimal phylogenetic distance (e.g. 5%). Yet another improvement could consist of reducing the expected divergence between tiled sequences and the sequence of pathogens to be detected.",

This property was recognized long ago, e.g., [18], and can be exploited in several applications including as seeds in Blast homology searches [19], protein family discovery and functional predictions [20], [21], [22]. Simulation studies have shown that given a phylogenetic tree and an unbiased phylogenetically representative set of extant homologous sequences, ancestral sequences can be inferred with high accuracy provided that evolutionary rate heterogeneity among sites and lineages is incorporated in the evolutionary models [18], [19], [22], [23], [24].",

Accordingly, we noted a very sharp increase of call rate and accuracy provided by tiled RASs, relative to extant sequences descending from these ancestors. For instance, when hybridizing Y. aldovae total DNA on the array (\nFig. 3A\n), the best values for call rate (82.2%) and accuracy (99.75%) were obtained with the tiled RAS corresponding to the ancestor of the Yersinia/Serratia clade.

This result is in agreement with the fact that the rpoB sequence of Y. aldovae diverges from the RAS of the Yersinia/Serratia clade by only 1.79%, but by 3.79% and 5.79% from Y. enterolitica and Y. pestis, respectively.",

The RAS of all Enterobacteriaceae gave, by far, the best accuracy and call rate values, when compared to tiled sequences of extant Enterobacteriaceae members (\nFig. 3C\n, Table S1). It is remarkable that by using the Enterobacteriaceae RAS as tiled sequence, the accuracy jumped from 45% (maximal value obtained with extant Enterobacteriaceae members) or 56.8% (value obtained with P. stuartii) to 73.7%. The low values obtained with extant Enterobacteriaceae members are consistent with their high sequence divergence from H. influenzae (25\u201332%), while the Enterobacteriaceae RAS diverged only by 15.9%.

To quantify this beneficial effect of RASs, we reconstructed ancestral sequences at all nodes of the phylogeny obtained for 169 rpoB sequences. We then calculated the number of required RASs to achieve full coverage of extant sequences at divergence levels of 5, 10 and 15%; that is, when each extant sequence diverges by less than the chosen threshold from at least one ancestral sequence (\nFig. 4\n). To cover all Enterobacteriaceae species with a maximum of 5% divergence, only 53 ancestral sequences are required, while it would be necessary to tile 69 extant sequences. Thus, an economy of 23% oligonucleotide probes required on the array would be achieved. At this divergence level, while 14 sequences of extant species would cover 100 Enterobacteriaceae species, 14 RASs would cover 120 Enterobacteriaceae species. Likewise, at the 10% divergence threshold, the single extant sequence with the highest coverage would cover 73 species, whereas the single RAS with the best coverage would cover 108 species (a 48% increase). At a 15% threshold, the improvement provided by the use of RASs was more modest (\nFig. 4\n).",

The ancestral sequence with the highest number was selected and the corresponding number of extant sequences was recorded (first value on the Y-axis, \nFigure 4\n) and the covered extant sequences were removed. This process was reiterated for all ancestral sequences by decreasing order of covered extant sequences. The same process was performed using 10% and 15% thresholds.
