            "text": "ADP-ribosylation is a reversible post-translational modification and involves the transfer of ADP-ribose (ADPr) units from the cofactor NAD+ onto substrate proteins. In cells, ADP-ribosylation is catalyzed by the ADP-ribosyltransferase (ART) family, referred to as ART diphtheria toxin-like or ARTD enzymes (aka PARPs)1,2. Mono-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation), the transfer of a single ADPr unit to substrates, is catalyzed by the majority of ARTD enzymes and regulates a variety of cellular processes such as cell proliferation, signaling and transcription3. In poly-ADP-ribosylation (PARylation) reactions, multiple ADPr moieties are transferred to a substrate in an iterative manner, resulting in modification by long, sometimes branched ADPr chains. PARylation is catalyzed by ARTD1, 2, 5 and 6 (PARP1 and 2, Tankyrase 1 and 2, respectively). ARTD1/2-mediated PARylation plays important roles in cellular stress signaling pathways and auto-modification of ARTD1/2 and PARylation of histones and other chromatin-associated proteins occurs quickly in response to DNA damage2,4. Moreover, PAR chains provide binding sites for DNA repair and chromatin remodeling factors, promoting efficient repair2. These interactions are mediated by a number of PAR binding domains, including macrodomains. Protein PARylation after DNA damage is of transient nature and PAR chains are quickly degraded by PARG (poly-ADP-ribose glycohydrolase), the catalytic function of which is mediated by a macrodomain5.",

            "text": "Macrodomains are structurally conserved protein domains of 130\u2013190 amino acids found in eukaryotes, prokaryotes and viruses6,7. Macrodomains adopt a globular \u03b1/\u03b2/\u03b1-sandwich fold and possess a pocket for binding to ADPr or other NAD+-derived metabolites such as O-acetyl-ADPr (OA-ADPr). Macrodomains differ in their affinities, substrate specificities and activities, interacting specifically with either free and/or protein-bound ADPr or with PAR chains, or both. Some macrodomains exert hydrolytic activity towards ADP-ribosylated proteins. Macrodomains are therefore central to ADPr biology serving as either binding modules for ADP-ribosylated proteins or as hydrolases of ADP-ribosylation. PARG degrades PAR chains by hydrolyzing the glycosidic bond between two ribose sugars but does not cleave the linkage between the protein-proximal ADPr residue and the modified amino acid5. Thus, to completely reverse ADP-ribosylation, specific mono-ADPr-hydrolases are required. Three of the 11 human macrodomain-containing proteins known thus far, MacroD1, MacroD2 and TARG1/C6orf130, have been characterized as mono-ADPr-specific hydrolases, reverting glutamate/aspartate-linked MARylation6,8\u201311. While MacroD1 and MacroD2 are closely related at the sequence level (MacroD-type macrodomains), TARG1 is unique among the macrodomain-containing MAR hydrolases, as it is phylogenetically related to ALC-type macrodomains7. TARG1 is postulated to employ a different catalytic mechanism compared to the MacroD-type hydrolases9. In addition to hydrolysis of MARylation, TARG1 exerts OA-ADPr deacetylase activity12 and can remove whole PAR chains from PARylated ARTD19, the latter representing a unique, but rather weak activity among all so far identified MAR hydrolases9,13. In cells, TARG1 interacts with ARTD1 and is recruited to sites of laser-induced DNA damage dependent on PARylation9. TARG1 depletion from HEK293 and U2OS cells was suggested to increase senescence and sensitivity to DNA damaging agents, indicating a role in DNA repair9. An inactivating homozygous mutation in the TARG1-encoding OARD1 gene has been correlated with childhood neurodegeneration9.",

Ribosomal proteins and proteins associated with rRNA metabolism and RNA binding were the main interaction partners. However, when ARTD1/2 were activated in cell extracts, a strong shift in the interactome towards PARylated proteins was noticed. Furthermore, we observed that TARG1 shuttles continuously between nucleoli and the nucleoplasm and accumulates in transcriptionally active nucleoli under steady-state conditions. Upon DNA damage rapid and reversible relocation into the nucleoplasm occurred, which was dependent on the ADPr binding ability of TARG1. The accumulation in nucleoli and PARylation-dependent relocation to the nucleoplasm are consistent with the ability of TARG1 to bind RNA and PAR in a competitive manner. In conclusion, we propose that TARG1 is a nucleolar ribosome biosynthesis quality control factor.",

            "text": "To gain insight into TARG1\u2019s cellular functions, we identified the TARG1-associated cellular proteome using a tandem affinity purification (TAP) approach19. HEK293 cells stably and inducibly expressing TAP-tagged TARG1 or the TAP-tag alone were generated and TAP-containing protein complexes isolated (Fig. 1a)20. The TAP-tag consists of Protein A fused to a Calmodulin (CaM) binding peptide (CBP) via a Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease cleavage site (Fig. 1a), allowing for sequential affinity purification of TAP-tag-containing complexes. Protein A is captured by an IgG matrix, complexes are eluted by TEV cleavage and CBP-tagged complexes are recovered by a CaM pulldown (Fig. 1a). Co-purified proteins were analyzed by LC-MS/MS and relative enrichment of detected proteins in the TAP-TARG1 pulldown over the TAP-tag control was calculated by label-free quantitation (Fig. 1b and c)21,22. Because mechanical DNA shearing during cell lysis activates ARTD1/2 resulting in PAR formation, to which TARG1 can be recruited9,23, we assessed the role of PAR on the TARG1 interactome. Therefore, the experiments were performed with or without the ARTD1/2 inhibitor olaparib during cell lysis (Fig. 1a). Experiments without inhibitor were performed in three, experiments with inhibitor in two biological replicates. The individual samples were measured in technical duplicates. Without inhibitor we identified 70 TARG1 interacting proteins with a fold enrichment \u22652 (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Table S1, Supplementary Dataset S1). ARTD1, the only described interaction partner of TARG1 so far9, was highly enriched (Fig. 1c; Supplementary Table S1, Supplementary Dataset S1). In addition, components of protein complexes involved in base excision repair (BER; XRCC1 and LIG3), in non-homologous end joining (NHEJ; PRKDC, XRCC5 and XRCC6) and the FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) complex subunits SSRP1 and SUPT16H were associated with TARG1. All of these factors have been consistently found as proteins that are PARylated in response to DNA damage or are recruited to sites of DNA damage via PAR binding domains23,24.",

Mutation of G123 was previously shown to block ADPr binding9. Impact of the mutations on folding and ADPr binding was assessed in fluorescence-based thermal shift assays25. His-TARG1-G43E and -I44E were less, His-TARG1-G123E more stable than the wildtype protein (Supplementary Fig. S1d). While His-TARG1 was stabilized by ADPr, the mutants were not, indicative of loss of ADPr binding (Supplementary Fig. S1d). Moreover, all three mutants were catalytically inactive towards auto-modified ARTD10 (Supplementary Fig. S1e). Consistent with these findings and unlike the wildtype protein, TARG1-G123E did not interact with repair proteins in co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments (Fig. 1d).",

The +olaparib dataset contained 192 proteins with a \u22652-fold enrichment with an overlap of 32 proteins to the \u2013olaparib dataset (Fig. 1b). The lost proteins with olaparib included those being either substrates of or recruited by DNA damage-induced PARylation (Fig. 1c and e). Increasing the stringency to a threshold of \u226510 resulted in an overlap of only one protein, RFC2 (replication factor C subunit 2), in addition to TARG1 itself (Fig. 1b). In the presence of olaparib, we identified almost all proteins of the small and large ribosomal subunits and proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis, RNA processing and translation such as nucleolin (NCL), hnRNPs and DDX proteins (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Table S1, Supplementary Dataset S2). Among the ARTD family members, association of TARG1 with ARTD1 and the catalytically inactive ARTD13 was observed. However, while ARTD1 was highly enriched in the absence of olaparib treatment (385-fold), it was only weakly interacting (2.6-fold) with TARG1 with ARTD1/2 inhibition (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Table S1, Supplementary Dataset S2). Independent co-IP experiments using FLAG-tagged TARG1 from cell lysates in the presence of olaparib confirmed binding to ARTD1, NCL, RPL7A, and USP10 (Fig. 1f). CHD1L was not co-IPed, indicating that lysis-induced PAR formation was very low or did not occur in these experiments (Fig. 1f). We were not able to IP endogenous TARG1 under co-IP conditions with any of our monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies despite their reactivity with endogenous TARG1 on Western blots and in high stringency IP buffers (for control Western blots see below). A possible explanation is that the epitopes of this small protein are covered by interacting factors under low stringency conditions.",

The reduction of cell proliferation observed for HeLa OARD1\u2212/\u2212 clone 3 was not caused by the loss of TARG1, as complementation with a lentiviral vector expressing HA-TARG1 wildtype or HA-TARG1-G43E did not affect proliferation (Fig. 2c and d). Similarly, substantial overexpression of TARG1 or TARG1-G123E or shRNA-dependent knockdown of OARD1 in HeLa Flp-In\u2122 T-REx\u2122 cells did neither affect cell proliferation nor sensitivity to DNA damage-inducing agents (Supplementary Figs S4 and S5).

Several regions of interest (ROIs) were defined, one for bleaching and one for measuring were placed in the nucleoplasm, one in a nucleolus, one in the cytoplasm, and a control ROI in a neighboring cell to account for changes during the measurements. After acquisition of five control images, one nucleoplasmic ROI was exposed to repetitive photo-bleaching. After each bleach pulse imaging scans were performed and mean EGFP intensities were determined in all ROIs. EGFP fluorescence intensities in control regions remained constant (Fig. 4b\u2013d), indicating that the effect of bleaching during image acquisition between the bleach pulses was negligible. EGFP intensities in each ROI were normalized to the mean EGFP intensity in each ROI before bleaching (Fig. 4b\u2013d).",

Therefore, we asked whether TARG1 has RNA binding activity. In an RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) His-tagged TARG1 bound dose-dependently to 32P-labeled ssRNA Pentaprobes (Fig. 6a and b)41. The Pentaprobe plasmid library encodes six overlapping double stranded 100 bp long oligonucleotides that in total contain every possible 5 bp sequence motif, from which 12 different ssRNA molecules can be in vitro transcribed (forward and reverse)41. RNA binding activity of GST-ALY served as positive control (Fig. 6a and b)42,43, while GST alone did not bind (Fig. 6a and b). The specificity of the TARG1-RNA complex was documented by the induction of a supershift with a TARG1-specific antibody (Fig. 6c). TARG1 interacted equally well with several different Pentaprobe constructs (Fig. 6b and d), indicating that TARG1 binding to RNA is likely independent of a specific sequence. Unlabeled RNA isolated from cultured cells competed with TARG1 binding to the Pentaprobes (Fig. 6d).",

Similarly, ADPr did not prevent RNA binding by TARG1 (Fig. 6g), indicating that the interaction with RNA is not or not exclusively based on binding in the ADPr binding pocket. Also, RNA did not increase thermal stability of TARG1 (Fig. 6e), as in the case of ADPr (Supplementary Fig. S1d). Instead, addition of increasing amounts of RNA to TARG1 reduced its thermal stability (Fig. 6e). When titrating ADPr into an RNA-TARG1 mixture in the thermal shift assay, the negative thermal shift induced by RNA was reversed in a dose-dependent manner for TARG1, but not for TARG1-G123E (Fig. 6f).",

We therefore tested whether PAR chains were able to compete with RNA for binding to TARG1. Indeed, titration of PAR into the RNA binding assay efficiently reversed the band shift induced by His-TARG1 but poorly by His-TARG1-G123E (Fig. 6g). These data, together with the inability of ADPr to compete, are in agreement with a model, in which TARG1 binds RNA via positively charged patches on its surface but not via its ADPr binding pocket. In contrast, PAR occupies the ADPr binding pocket of TARG1 and at the same time interacts very likely with the positively charged patches on the surface of TARG1. These findings support the notion that TARG1 has a higher affinity to PAR than to RNA.",

In the absence of ARTD1/2 activation and PAR formation, the TARG1 interactome is strongly directed toward ribosomal proteins and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that function in diverse RNA-associated cellular processes. Furthermore, we observed that TARG1 is a nuclear protein that shuttles rapidly between the nucleoplasm and nucleoli. The distribution between these two compartments is regulated by PARylation, i.e. TARG1 is mainly nucleolar in the absence of PAR, while it accumulates in the nucleoplasm in response to PAR formation. We also discovered that TARG1 interacts with RNA, which together with binding to ribosomal proteins is suggested to control its nucleolar localization (Fig. 7).",

These screens commonly revealed that a high number of RNA processing factors are ADP-ribosylated or are PAR binding proteins44,45. So far, it is unclear which of the identified proteins interact directly with TARG1. In addition to direct protein-protein binding, we assume that some of the interactions are mediated by the ability of TARG1 to associate with RNA (Fig. 6). This seems likely as a number of proteins were identified that are part of multi-protein and ribonucleoprotein complexes such as ribosomes. In contrast, when PARylation was not inhibited the interactome was dominated by DNA repair proteins of various processes, most of which have been shown to be PARylated or interacting with PAR23,24,47,51\u201354. This observation is consistent with the finding that TARG1 is recruited to sites of DNA damage in an ARTD1-dependent manner9. This efficient recruitment is also in agreement with the strong enrichment of ARTD1 in the TARG1 interactome in the absence of olaparib (Fig. 1).",

This might seem surprising, because ADP-ribosylation has been associated with nucleolar functions in a number of studies29,44,55\u201357. PAR, ARTD1 and ARTD2 can be found enriched in nucleoli under non-stress conditions and several nucleolar proteins are ADP-ribosylated and/or interact with ARTD1, ARTD2 or PAR29,32,33,55. Interference with PAR metabolism in Drosophila results in mislocalization of nucleolar proteins and disintegration of nucleoli55. We did not observe fragmentation or other abnormalities of nucleoli in cells with OARD1 knock-out or TARG1 overexpression. In Drosophila Parp and Parg mutants, rRNA maturation defects have been observed, accompanied by a drop in cytoplasmic polysomes55. It was proposed that nucleolar PAR serves as a scaffold to recruit rRNA processing factors into nucleoli, which is required for accurate ribosome biogenesis55. PAR chains formed at DNA damage sites are capable of forming liquid phase structures together with proteins that contain low complexity domains58. Thus, PAR might also contribute to the liquid phase structure of nucleoli, which are formed around rDNA repeats in an incremental manner by multivalent interactions between rRNA transcripts and nucleolar proteins2,35,59\u201361. TARG1 inhibits ARTD1 in vitro and might be able to remove complete PAR chains from automodified ARTD19. It remains however unknown whether TARG1 is able to modulate PARylation levels by either of these mechanisms in cells. Whether TARG1 is needed for nucleolar integrity by modulating nucleolar PARylation or by other means remains to be investigated.",

Actinomycin D treatment induces broad changes in the nucleolar proteome62. Especially ribosomal proteins and ribosome biogenesis factors depend on the presence of rRNA for nucleolar localization and leave nucleoli upon RNA polymerase I inhibition34,62.

These included the localization of the protein to nucleoli, the interaction with ribosomes and RBPs, and the finding that several macrodomains including the macrodomain of CHIKV-nsP3 and MacroD1 interact with RNA14,15. Our study provides an initial characterization of the RNA binding activity of TARG1. We found TARG1 to interact with different RNA molecules in EMSAs, indicating that the binding is independent of the RNA sequence. The competition experiments suggested that RNA binding does not rely on the ADPr binding pocket. PAR efficiently competed with RNA for binding to TARG1, but not for binding to TARG1-G123E. We conclude that PAR occupies the same regions in TARG1 as RNA, explaining the competitive binding mode. The requirement for an intact ADPr binding pocket for efficient competition suggests that PAR binding to this pocket is substantial. This is consistent with the roughly 10-fold more efficient competition of TARG1 RNA binding by PAR compared to RNA and by the inefficient competition by ADPr (Fig. 6). Thus, RNA binding occurs probably in the vicinity of the ADPr binding pocket of TARG1 and the efficient competition by PAR requires interaction in this pocket and at surface sites that also interact with RNA. The latter is supported by the presence of basic surface patches close to the ADPr binding pocket in TARG19, which could mediate unspecific interaction with the negatively charged RNA backbone and also stabilize interaction with PAR, as suggested earlier14,15.",

Destabilization of TARG1 by RNA was antagonized by ADPr. Of surprise was the high concentration of ADPr necessary for the stabilization effect, indicating that the affinity for ADPr is rather low. This is consistent with a Ki value of 119 \u00b5M for ADPr in OA-ADPr deacetylation reactions12, but less compatible with the Kd of 8.4 \u00b5M for ADPr9. Together with the ADPr competition in EMSAs, we conclude that ADPr and RNA are able to interact with TARG1 simultaneously.",

            "text": "What is the functional consequence of TARG1 binding to RNA and ribosomal proteins? How does this relate to the role of TARG1 during DNA damage-induced PARylation? So far, it is not clear whether TARG1 directly regulates ribosome biogenesis. According to our proteomics data, TARG1 interacts with a variety of ribosomal proteins and ribosome biogenesis factors, but evidence for a possible role of TARG1 in particular steps of ribosome biogenesis is missing presently. Based on the recruitment of TARG1 to sites of DNA damage and a decreased resistance to DNA damaging agents of TARG1 knock-down cells, TARG1 was proposed to act as a DNA damage response factor9, a finding that in our experimental set-up could not be reproduced (Supplementary Fig. S5). However, several RBPs and ribosomal proteins have been described as direct substrates of ADP-ribosylation during genotoxic stress44,66. Some of these ribosomal proteins are important for the interaction of the 40S and 60S subunits66,67. It was proposed that ARTD1-dependent ADP-ribosylation of RPL24 at E106 and RPS8 at E89 might interfere with the formation of inter-subunit bridges formed between RPL24 and RPS6 and between RPS8 and the 28S rRNA, thereby regulating ribosome assembly66. These observations were made in a breast cancer cell line, but not in several other lines. Nevertheless, it offers the intriguing possibility that ADP-ribosylation of these proteins regulates ribosome assembly. Whether TARG1 can reverse these modifications and thereby modulate ribosome biogenesis remains to be determined. The maintenance of nucleolar PAR levels seems to promote nucleolus formation and ribosome biogenesis in Drosophila55. Whether this is also occurring in mammalian cells needs to be demonstrated. Nevertheless, the role of PARylation in nucleolar functions might be more complex than anticipated. PARylation might affect nucleolar functions by several mechanisms, acting either as a scaffold important for the recruitment of ribosome biogenesis factors and at the same time as a PTM of ribosomal proteins, interfering with ribosome assembly. This might explain why the effects observed in OARD1 knock-out cells are rather weak. The presence of MacroD1 and/or MacroD2 might also compensate sufficiently for the lack of TARG1 and thus allow proliferation, at least in HeLa cells.",

ALY, fused to an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tag, was expressed in bacteria and purified by glutathione affinity chromatography. Aliquots of the eluates, together with a bovine serum albumin (BSA) standard, were separated on an SDS-gel and stained with Coomassie blue. (b) Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) using RNA Pentaprobe oligonucleotides41. Purified 32P-labeled Pentaprobe 9 (32P-PP9) was incubated with the indicated amounts of purified GST, GST-ALY, His-TARG1 wildtype (WT), -G123E or -G43E (2.5\u201320 pmol corresponding to 83.3\u2013666 nM, respectively). Free RNA and RNA-protein complexes were separated on native 7% poly-acrylamide gels. Mobility shifts were analyzed by auto-radiography.

Under steady-state conditions, TARG1 accumulates in nucleoli but constantly shuttles between nucleoli and the nucleoplasm (1). Accumulation of TARG1 in nucleoli is mediated by direct interaction with ribosomal RNA or proteins (RP) or other nucleolar proteins (NP; 2). PARylation modulates the localization and interactome of TARG1. TARG1 re-locates to the nucleoplasm upon DNA damage-induced ARTD1/2-dependent PARylation (3). In nucleoli, TARG1 may contribute to ribosome biogenesis, e.g., by counteracting PARylation of RPs or controlling nucleolar PAR scaffolds. DNA damage-induced PARylation might serve to sequester TARG1 to the nucleoplasm to regulate PAR turnover at DNA damage sites (4). Hypothetical interactions are marked by grey arrows.",
