The complete S genes from 11 representative PEDV strains were amplified and sequenced, and the GenBank accession numbers for CH/HNXJ/2017, CH/HN7/2016, CH/GSTS/2016, CH/HNXY/2017, CH/HNCD/2017, CH/HNHB/2017, CH/XJKT/2016, CH/HNLB/2017, CH/HNPJ/2017, and CH/SXXY/2017 are MF152596, MF152597, MF152598, MF152599, MF152600, MF152601, MF152602, MF152603, MF152604, and MF152605, respectively. Seventy-four reference strains were obtained from GenBank for phylogenetic analysis.

In this study, the rate of co-infection with PEDV and PKV was 11.2% (13/116) in diarrhea samples. However, co-infection with PEDV and TGEV or PDCoV was not detected. Additionally, the rate of PEDV positivity was 52.6% (61/116) for samples from 2016 to 2017. The infection rate in the assessed samples was higher for PEDV than for other diarrhea viruses; this result was consistent with the findings of certain prior epidemiological surveys conducted in China [10\u201312].

Therefore, the S gene is used to analyze the molecular epidemiology and genetic relatedness of PEDV. In this study, the 11 field strains were classified into the G2 group according to a phylogenetic tree. This result indicated that virulent strains were prevalent in China and were responsible for PEDV outbreaks in 2016\u20132017. In addition, to an extent, the examined strains differed from early PEDV isolates (LZC, CH/S and CV777). This difference explains why PED outbreaks continued to occur in cases involving the use of CV777-based vaccines. Based on the amino acid sequence of the S gene, the mutant sites in these strains were primarily located in the S1 domain of the S protein. The CV777 vaccine strain has three major neutralizing epitopes: aa 498\u2013637 (the COE gene), aa 747\u2013754 (YSNIGVCK) and aa 763\u2013770 (LQDGQVKI) [2, 14]. We found that strains in this study had sequence mutations at positions 498\u2013637 and 747\u2013754; however, the amino acid sequence at aa 747\u2013754 was conserved between the field strain most recently isolated in our study and CV777. This result is consistent with the observation that CV777-based vaccines provided partial cross-protection against PEDV epidemic strains in China. In summary, current field strains of PEDV found in China in 2016\u20132017 are primarily virulent strains, and genetic variations in these strains may have led to antigenic changes and the failure of immunization.",
