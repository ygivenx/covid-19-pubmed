PRRSV can cause a prolonged viremia phase and persist in pigs for long periods, primarily in tonsils and lymph nodes, after initial infection [8\u201311]. In addition, PRRSV infection results in severe functional impairment of cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage [7] and suppression of natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity against PRRSV-infected porcine alveolar macrophages in vitro [12]. Moreover, PRRSV infections have a negative impact on the host immune system that leads to inadequate response to vaccination [13\u201315]. All data reveal that PRRSV can modulate the porcine immune system, particularly during the early stages after infection. However, the mechanisms involved in these unusual and delayed immune responses remain to be elucidated [16\u201318].",

Tregs are classified as natural or induced types. Natural Tregs mainly control the immune response against autoantigens and induced Tregs are involved in the response to exogenous antigens [19, 20]. Tregs are implicated in several persistent or chronic viral infections in humans, and increased numbers are observed in several chronic infections, including human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human cytomegalovirus infections [21\u201324]. According to the cytokines that they produce, inducible Tregs can be classified into several subtypes: (1) TR1 cells that secrete interleukin (IL)-10; (2) T helper (Th)3 cells that secrete transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2; and (3) converted Foxp3+ Tregs [19, 25]. Inducible Tregs acquire their function following infection or exposure to other stimuli [19]. In pigs, the CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Treg cells exhibiting suppressor activity by a variety of mechanisms have been identified [26].",

Type 2 PRRSV strains induce Tregs proliferation and upregulate TGF-\u03b2 production [27\u201330]. PRRSV N protein plays an important role in IL-10 production [31]. However, monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) infected with type 1 PRRSV produce neither TGF-\u03b2 nor Tregs [32]. In this study, we found that HP-PRRSV induced Tregs proliferation more strongly than C-PRRSV. By using synthetic peptides and reverse genetic methods, it was firstly found that the 15N and 46R residues in PRRSV N protein play an important role in Tregs proliferation.",

PRRSV suppresses innate immunity, causes abnormal B cell proliferation and repertoire development, disrupts normal T cell development in the thymus, and impairs cytotoxic T lymphocyte induction [38]. PRRSV infection can induce CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs [29, 30, 37], which play an important role in suppressing the immune and inflammatory responses. However, the Tregs epitopes that are crucial for the interactions between PRRSV and the host immune system have not been explored. In this study, our results showed that Tregs induction by HP-PRRSV was higher than that by C-PRRSV in MoDCs. The aa 15\u201321, 42\u201348 and 88\u201394 in HP-PRRSV N protein were important for inducing Tregs, using 16 synthetic peptides that covered the whole length of N protein. By using mutant synthetic peptides and reverse genetic methods, it was firstly found that the two key residues, 15N and 46R, in N protein were involved in inducing of Tregs proliferation. The phenotype of induced porcine Tregs closely resembled that of TGF-\u03b2-secreting Th3 Tregs in humans, mice and swine.",

However, infection and vaccination with PRRSV induces a rapid, non-neutralizing antibody response and an early, weak, nonspecific IFN response [41, 42]. The inadequate IFN response may be due to the ability of PRRSV to stimulate Tregs in vitro [43]. PRRSV N protein downregulated IFN-\u03b2 mRNA level in polyI:C-treated immortalized porcine alveolar macrophages by interfering with double-stranded-RNA-induced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IFN-regulatory factor 3 [44]. It revealed that N protein is related to suppression of the innate immune response. We showed that HP-PRRSV N protein had greater Tregs induction than C-PRRSV had. A previous study has suggested that type 2 PRRSV N protein induces IL-10, but Tregs induction is not strong [31]. MoDCs infected with type 1 PRRSV strains produce neither TGF-\u03b2 nor Tregs [32]. These differences may be due to the different strains and the sources of recombinant N protein that expressed with the baculovirus or Escherichia coli expression systems.",

The aa 112\u2013123 at the C terminus of the N protein are crucial to maintain structural conformation [47]. A cryptic nuclear localization signal (NLS), called NLS-1, a functional NLS (NLS-2), and a nucleolar localization sequence (NoLS) are, respectively, located at aa 10\u201313, 41\u201347, and 41\u201372, respectively [48]. The dominant Tregs epitopes that are located in the core and NS3 proteins of HCV have been determined by using peptide pools, which suggest that stimulation with single short foreign peptide is sufficient to cause rapid and dramatic induction of Tregs in culture [49, 50]. To screen the key amino acids that are related to induction of Tregs, 16 synthetic peptides that covered the whole length of N protein and mutants of three amino acid regions were used to stimulate MoDCs. The results showed that peptides 3 (aa 15\u201321), 7 (aa 42\u201348) and 12 (aa 88\u201394) significantly induced Tregs proliferations compared to PBS. Three mutant peptides, 3m, 7m and 12m, were synthesized according to these substitutions (15\u201321 (N15D), 42\u201348 (R46K) and 88\u201394 (A91T)). And the levels of Tregs in the 3m and 7m groups were significantly lower than those in peptides 3 and 7, respectively. The results of the structures of the peptides between HP-PRRSV and C-PRRSV analyzed by using SPLIT 4.0 software revealed that the indexes of \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-fold of 3m were higher than peptide 3. And the index of \u03b1-helix of 7m has a litter rise than that of peptide 7 (data not shown here). The amino acid 15N is close to NLS-1 and 46R is located in the NLS-2 region, which interacts with the nuclear transporters importin \u03b1 and \u03b2 [48]. A knockout mutant for the NLS-2 in the PRRSV N protein was engineered using reverse genetics. Pigs infected with this mutant developed reduced viremia and significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers [51]. This suggests that the NLS-2 region has an important immunomodulatory domain. The real structures of the peptides and the relationship between protein structure and Tregs induction should be studied in the future.",

The GP5 protein is associated within the virion to the membrane protein M via disulfide bonds [53]. Both these major envelope proteins induce a robust cellular immune response in PRRSV-exposed pigs [54\u201356]. They also produce neutralizing antibodies against GP5 and M [57, 58]. In this study, we constructed a total of six recombinant baculoviruses that expressed GP2, GP3, GP4, GP5, M and N proteins of HP-PRRSV. But only GP5, M and N proteins were expressed at high concentrations. The possible reasons why GP2, GP3 and GP4 were not expressed might be related to the high hydrophobicity and structures of these proteins, the expression efficiency of the Bac-to-Bac\u00ae baculovirus expression system or others we do not know. We also noted that three bands were observed in the expressed GP5. This expression form was similar to the results obtained by Hyun et al in 2008, and might be related with the levels of glycosylation in insect cells [59]. However, the recombinant GP5 and M proteins were unable to induce Tregs proliferation. And the role of proteins GP2, GP3 and GP4 in inducing Tregs proliferation should be studied in the future.",

Nsp1\u03b1, nsp1\u03b2, nsp2 and nsp11 are antagonists of IFN induction, with different molecular mechanisms [60]. Suppression of innate immunity can be an important contributing factor to the modulation of host immune responses, because type I IFN promotes antigen presentation and natural killer cell function, enhances antibody production of B cells, and plays an important role in differentiation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Considering the immune dysregulation of NSPs, whether HP-PRRSV NSPs, especially the nsp1, nsp2 and nsp11, have the ability of Tregs induction can be investigated in the future.",

            "text": "DCs play an important role in initiating immunity and maintaining self tolerance. DC subsets specifically stimulate activation and differentiation of Tregs [61\u201363]. Induction and maintenance of Tregs in vivo is dependent on a variety of factors that include co-stimulatory molecules such as CD80 and CD86 [62, 64] and cytokines such as TGF-\u03b2 [65] and IL-2 [66]. The CD80/86 co-stimulatory molecule on antigen-presenting cells is required for delivering a second signal necessary for activation of T cells [67]. Type 1 and 2 PRRSV have an up- or downregulatory effect on expression of CD80/86 [16, 36, 68\u201370]. Differences between PRRSV strains in regulation of these molecules have been observed in vitro [69, 71]. In the present study, Treg induction by different virulent PRRSV strains might be dependent on the different regulatory effect on modulation of cell-surface co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86. The mechanisms contributing to Tregs induction should be further studied. By the way, the time of co-culture of lymphocytes with virus-infected MoDCs was 3 days in this study, which was the same as T. E. Cecere described [34], but different from that times as previously describe [29], because the morphologic evidence of cytolysis of MoDCs began approximately 5 days post-inoculation with HP-PRRSV strain. It might be related to the cytopathic characteristic of the PRRSV strain on DCs. But the results showed that the numbers of Tregs induced by PRRSV or viral proteins were increased significantly compared with those in control group on the condition of 3 days co-culture.",
