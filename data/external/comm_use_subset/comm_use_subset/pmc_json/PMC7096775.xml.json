We defined a reference group from a well-known setting: in 73 German sentinel hospitals, we extracted the data of all inpatients diagnosed with pneumonia (International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision codes J12-J18, primary diagnosis [13]) that were admitted during three consecutive weeks, after the start and before the peak of the influenza epidemic in the years 2015 to 2019. We compared severity parameters that were described for COVID-19 patients (acute respiratory distress syndrome, ventilation, intensive care, case fatality) with those from the German sentinel system. Furthermore, we stratified parameters by potential risk groups such as age, sex and chronic comorbidities. We also compared outcomes and risk factors for critically ill patients (i.e. received intensive care and ventilation) [14]. As the Chinese population is younger, with a larger proportion of males compared with the German population, we applied weights and provided crude and adjusted proportions for the sentinel pneumonia patients (SPP) [15]. This approach, which can be used by other countries using syndromic surveillance, attempts to replicate the uncertainty of initial results for the new coronavirus.",

German pneumonia patients had a two- to threefold lower ventilation rate of 9%. The two case series from Shenzhen and the province Zhejiang also reported much lower ventilation rates of, respectively, 11% and 2% [9,11] (Figure 2). The median duration of ventilation was 9 days (interquartile range: 7\u201319, n = 13) for non-invasive and 17 days (interquartile range: 12\u201319, n = 4) for invasive ventilation in the COVID-19 case series described by Chen et al. [5]. In contrast, the median ventilation duration (invasive and non-invasive) in SPP was only 2 days (interquartile range: 1\u20134, n = 303). The high ventilation rates and the long duration of ventilation (data from one case series) can be attributed to a high rate of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) among COVID-19 patients. Again, the difference between Hubei (17\u201320% ARDS) and outside of Hubei (2\u20134% ARDS) is striking. However, ARDS was observed in only 1% of SPP.",

However, based on these data, COVID-19 may affect a younger cohort, which seems not fully explained by the different age structure of the Chinese population. As reported by the China Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, there seems to be a higher risk for severe disease in older ages and in patients with chronic illnesses [16]. But severity in younger adults below 60 years and in patients without chronic preconditions appears to be higher in COVID-19 patients than in pneumonia patients usually seen during the influenza season. The rate of ARDS and of patients requiring ventilation was markedly higher among COVID-19 patients with much longer duration of ventilation, based in the data from one study. During the influenza pandemic 2009 however, specialised German hospitals reported similarly long ventilation duration times [17].",

In addition, the large impact on the health system in the initially affected province resulted in insufficient healthcare resources [3]. This may have inhibited adequate treatment as the strikingly higher case fatality indicates [18]. However, all COVID-19 case series were still open with more than half of the cases hospitalised at reporting date. It is known that COVID-19 cases can have a prolonged course with many fatalities occurring 3 weeks after symptom onset [19]. Case fatality rates from these COVID-19 case series can therefore only be seen as preliminary.",

As more data on European cases are published, the system can be applied to cases with a more comparable background. First comparisons expose the high rate of patients requiring ventilation over prolonged time periods, thus hospital resources may be in higher demand of ventilation supply than usual. In fact, Liu et al. suggests that early non-invasive mechanical ventilation can promote positive outcomes [9]. This can only be implemented if hospitals prepare for high utilisation of ventilation and intensive care resources. Although fatalities occur mostly among elderly people with chronic comorbidities, serious disease progressions do also occur among younger, healthy patients and more often than would be expected from the experience during influenza epidemics.",
