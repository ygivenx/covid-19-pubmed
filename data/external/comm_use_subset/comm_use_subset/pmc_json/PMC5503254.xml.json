Increased cases of pneumonia and hospitalizations were observed at the National Institute for Respiratory Diseases in Mexico City in these seasons and these cases were related to the presence of the pandemic A/H1N1 virus [4].",

            "text": "Molecular and phylogenetic analyses of the viral genome are necessary to determine the antigenic and pathogenic characteristics of influenza viruses that cause severe outcomes of the disease [5]. In this context, one of the first studies in Mexico that analyzed sequences of HA and NA from pandemic A/H1N1 virus was done in early days of the pandemic outbreak in 2009 to detect and monitor pathogenicity and resistance substitutions affecting the outcome or severity of the respiratory diseases [6]. Later, oseltamivir-resistant virus was observed, showing low rates of the H275Y substitution [7]. With regards to pathogenicity, only the D222G/N/S substitutions were associated with severity and mortality in patients from Mexico City. Other mutations associated with adaptation or increased pathogenicity in human or avian influenza virus such as E627K in PB2 or T123V in NS1 were not detected [8]. The introduction of different substitutions in other segments, particularly the HA gene in segment 4, might affect the immunogenicity of the pandemic virus. Importantly, the strain recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for vaccine composition remained the A/California/7/2009 until the 2016\u20132017 influenza season (northern hemisphere winter), suggesting that the pandemic virus has not undergone antigenic changes during several years of circulation. Antigenic drift is caused by mutations in the antigenic sites adjacent to the receptor binding site of HA. This is why monitoring the molecular and functional properties of HA becomes essential for effective vaccine development. Our previous data showed that substitutions near the immunogenic domain in HA appeared since 2012, probably compromising the effectiveness of vaccination [8]. Few reports of HA pandemic virus characterization during the 2014 season have been reported and have also identified substitutions that might affect a region of HA targeted by antibodies in middle-aged adults. Recently, an extensive study about the global evolution of pandemic influenza was reported, however only few whole HA sequences from Mexico were included [9]. Furthermore, during the 2015\u20132016 influenza season, a delay in the wave of pandemic A/H1N1 confirmed cases was observed and until now in March 2016, a significant increase in the severity of cases in Mexico City hospitals has been observed.",

Sequence alignments were created by Multiple Sequence Comparison by Log-Expectation (MUSCLE) [16] and edited by MEGA 6.0. A maximum likelihood tree was constructed for each influenza segment using MEGA 6.0. The Tajima-Nei model was selected with 5-parameter gamma distributed rates and 1,000 bootstrap replicates.

However, polymerase complex sequences clustered with samples from 2010 and 2011. Analysis based on the HA gene showed that Mexican sequences could be divided into 3 groups: Group 1 (KR271535, KR271543, KR271551, KR271575, and KR271607) has 5 sequences forming a monophyletic group (99 bootstrap, Fig 1). These Mexican sequences clustered next to HA sequences of strains from New York (CY189313, CY189361, bootstrap value 66). These sequences share two substitutions in Signal Peptide of the immature HA at amino acid 7 and 15 (-11 V/I and -3 A/T). Group 2 (KR271559 and KR1571583) sequences clustered separately and shared a novel substitution in HA H138Q. Group 3 (KR271599 and KR271567) clustered with strains isolated in New York, Washington and Helsinki. One isolate (KR271567) shared mutation T474M with sequences from Helsinki and Finland principally. We mapped the amino acid substitutions occurring at the nodes of H1N1/2009 HA phylogeny, revealing amino acid changes at K163Q and A256T for 2013\u20132014 sequences as reported previously. Additionally, a cluster of 2 Mexican sequences was marked by substitution H138Q. Regarding NA, we observed 3 substitutions that marked sequences from 2013\u20132014; I34V, I321V and K432E. To determine whether individual sites were under positive selection, we used the mixed effects model of evolution (MEME) method. Only I34V was statistically significant (P = 0.05). Additionally we found substitutions that distinguished the three groups mentioned above with HA analyses. We observed substitution Q308L in group 1, while T452I was found in group 2 and the substitutions N449K, N386K and S82P were present on sequence KR271569 in group 3. For NS1 we detected the substitution L36I in group 1, the N127S in group 2 and finally the substitution K131E in group 3. Regarding PA we found the substitution I13V as a signature of the group 1 (statistically significant with P = 0.05), while in group 3 we detected two substitutions F35L and I459T. In PB1 we associated the substitution A374T with group 2 and M646I with group 3. In PB2 T676I was found in group 2[17]. Other substitutions were found in M1, M2, NS2 and NP but were similar to those reported in other countries (Table 2).",

Importantly we detected the H138Q substitution, that is located on the Ca2 antigenic region of HA, a relevant immunogenic site (Fig 2). Six putative glycosylation sites on HA (Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr) at positions 28, 40, 104, 304, 498 and 557 were predicted using NetNGlyc 1.0 server.

However we found other unique substitutions in PB2 G644R and T676I, PB1 A374T, HA H138Q, NA Q308L, and L36I in NS1 of some Mexican strains that could indicate geographical divergence. These findings should be confirmed with more sequences obtained in other regions of the country. Recently a very extensive analysis of sequences of influenza virus in a post-pandemic era showed that different geographical regions generated local epidemic peaks and might act as a potential seed of local virus. Further studies would be required in order to determine which of them are fixed in the next generation of influenza virus in Mexico. It is known that influenza viruses undergo positive selection during the process of cross-species transmission and during the initial stages of a human outbreak, followed by purifying (negative) selection, when viruses adapted to the new human host in late epidemic [24\u201326]. In this context we still observed positive selection of substitutions of NA I34V and PA I13V in winter season 2013\u20132014.",
