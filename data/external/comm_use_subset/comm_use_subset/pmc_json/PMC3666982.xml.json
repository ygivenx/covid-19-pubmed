Influenza pandemics have occurred during the 20th century and beginning of the 21st century at intervals of between 10 and 40 years, with the latest pandemics occurring in 1918\u20139, 1957\u20138, 1968\u20139 [2] and 2009\u201310 [3].

Epidemic models are especially useful to address epidemiological, economic, and individuals\u2019 behavioural questions [8-10]. The usefulness of epidemic models in directing mitigation efforts has been supported by empirical findings that have echoed previous modelling predictions. For instance, models predicted that reduced international air travel would be unlikely to stop an influenza pandemic [11], a finding later verified empirically during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic [12,13]; other models predicted the potential of antiviral prophylaxis and contact tracing to control small outbreaks [5], a prediction also verified in real-life outbreaks in semi-closed army camps [14].",

It is therefore essential to parameterize the model from available data [15,16] and validate the model to increase its credibility [17]. One of the main focuses of this review is to evaluate the trends in the construction and validation of mechanistic models \u2014 models that explicitly incorporate the mechanisms or processes underlying the outcomes of the system \u2014 of infection dynamics for influenza pandemic preparedness, control and mitigation. Traditionally, the main approach for mechanistic modelling of influenza pandemics has been based on compartmental models (Table 1) represented by systems of differential equations. Compartmental models represented the dynamics of a host-disease system for which a tractable analytical solution could in principle be derived through mathematical methods [8,18]. It was not until the widespread availability of modern computing power that more complex compartmental models for which analytical solutions could not be derived and agent-based models (ABMs, Table 1) explored using computer simulation became an attractive alternative. Recent modelling work, dealing with the threat of an influenza pandemic of avian origin (A-H5N1), with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) crisis in 2003 and the H1N1 2009 pandemic, has exemplified the use of both models solved analytically and through simulation [3,5,19,20].",

These reviews show a bewildering array of models that have been introduced, especially since the 2009 pandemic, with different purposes, outcomes and structures. Despite the usefulness of modelling, few public health practitioners or decision makers undergo explicit training in modelling techniques. When combined with the rapid growth in modelling capabilities driven by increasing computing power, and the multitude of different disciplines \u2013 e.g. economics, psychology, genetics \u2013 that contribute to modelling epidemics, this makes it daunting to keep abreast of all that modelling is capable of. To facilitate model understanding, this review focuses in three pandemic modelling aspects that are recently experimenting substantial innovations: parameterization and validation, economic aspects [26] and behaviour of the hosts [27]. Given the diversity of new techniques in these aspects of modelling, a review of common traits would be very helpful for non-expert users to determine which modelling techniques are most useful to address the decisions they face. In addition, a protocol to guide the reporting of these aspects together with model construction would help modellers and policy makers compare and evaluate models. To this end, we review and classify models for influenza pandemic preparedness from January 2000 to September 2011, and use the resulting analysis to develop a simple guiding protocol for reporting modelling decisions.",
