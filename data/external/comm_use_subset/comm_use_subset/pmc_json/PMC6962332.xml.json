Common choices for the time unit include a day, a week, a month, etc. It is an important indication for the severeness of an epidemic as a function of time. For example, Fig. 1 shows the cumulative number of Ebola cases during the 2014\u201316 Ebola outbreak in western Africa. The cumulative cases during the initial growth phase form an approximately linear relationship with time in log-linear scale. Thus, in linear scale, the number of deaths increases exponentially with time. The mortality curve (the number of deaths per unit time) shows a similar pattern, as demonstrated by the daily influenza deaths in Philadelphia during the 1918 influenza pandemic shown in Fig. 2.",

The simulated daily cases (number of individuals showing symptom on a day) are then aggregated into weekly cases. Then, we use both methods to fit an exponential curve to the simulated epidemic curve. The simulated epidemic curve and the fitting results are shown in Fig. 3. This exercise illustrates a challenge of fitting an exponential model to an epidemic curve: how to determine the time period to fit the exponential model. The exponential growth rate of an SEIR model decreases with time as the susceptible population decreases. In Fig. 3, The epidemic curve peaks in week 13. We choose a sequence of nested fitting windows starting in the first week and ending in a week w for w=3,4,\u2026,13. The SEIR model has an asymptotic exponential growth, so the fitted exponential growth rate is not monotonic near the beginning of the epidemic. For larger fitting windows, both methods give an exponential growth rate that decreases with the length of the fitting window. We need more data points to reduce the influence of the stochasticity. However, using more data points also risks of obtaining an estimate that deviates too much from the true exponential growth rate. There is no reliable method to choose a proper fitting window.",

It does not explicitly assume any error distributions, and thus cannot give us statistical information about the inference. For example, if we use two slightly different fitting windows and get two slightly different estimates, is the difference of the two estimates statistically significant? Such a question cannot easily be answered by the least squares method. Interestingly, the least squares methods make many implicit assumptions to the deviations. We have mentioned the implicit equal-weight assumption above. It also implicitly assumes that the order of the observations does not matter, and that positive and negative deviations are equivalent. Thus, they implicitly assume that the deviations are independently identically and symmetrically distributed. In statistics, the least squares method is commonly used in linear and nonlinear regression with an addition assumption that the errors are independently and identically normally distributed. However, these assumption on the errors may not be appropriate. For example, the new cases at time t+1 may be infected by those who are infected at time t. Thus, the number of new cases at different times may not be independent. Also, the number of cases is a counting variable, and thus its mean and variance may be closely related, meaning that the error may not be identically normally distributed.

We use an SIR model as an example. For simplicity, we assume that the process error is negligible, and the incidence rate is Poisson distributed with a mean C(t) given by an SIR model (C(t)=\u03b2SIN where N is the population size). To construct the log-likelihood function, we need to calculate C(t), i.e., numerically solve the SIR model. To do so, we need the transmission rate \u03b2. the recovery rate \u03b3, the initial fraction of infectious individuals I(0)=I0 (with the assumption that R(0)=0, S(0)=1\u2212I0, and thus I0 determines the initial conditions), in addition to the population size N. Thus, the parameters of the model is \u03b8\u2192=(\u03b2,\u03b3,I0,N). Thus the log-likelihood function is (ignoring the constant terms)\u2113(\u03b2,\u03b3,I0,N)=\u2211i=0n\u22121\u2212c(ti)+xilnc(ti),where the number of new cases c(ti) in the time interval [ti,ti+1] isc(ti)=S(ti+1)\u2212S(ti),and S(ti) is solved numerically from the SIR model.

Yet simple SIR and SEIR models assume a population with a homogeneous susceptibility. Thus using a simple SIR to fit to an influenza epidemic may be an over simplification. However, realistic mechanistic models can be overly complicated, and involve too many parameters that are at best difficult to estimate.
