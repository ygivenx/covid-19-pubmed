            "text": "Nosocomial infections, also called healthcare acquired infections or health care-associated infections, is defined by the CDC as a localized or systemic condition resulting from an adverse reaction to the presence of an infectious agent(s) or its toxin(s), without any evidence that the infection was present or incubating at the time of admission to the acute care setting [1]. Nosocomial infections have become an important public health issue worldwide. Nosocomial infections may result in an excess length of stay in hospital for up to 10 days and an increase in the costs of hospitalization.[2,3] Nosocomial infections pose a critical threat to patients, especially in the high-risk departments, such as the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).[4,5] In industrialized countries, nosocomial infections occurs in 2\u201312% of hospitalized patients, with the rates being up to 21% in ICU, while the rates are 3\u201318% in hospitalized patients with the rates being up to 54% in ICU. [5-11] In China, there are more than 10,000 hospitals with significant differences among each other in the size, facilities, administration, teaching, research and academic levels. A few studies reported nosocomial infections in China, but these studies were limited in small sample sizes and short period of time, publication in Chinese journals, with or without English abstracts. [11-13] Recently, we carried out a retrospective study to determine the current status of nosocomial infections in a tertiary hospital in East China. All data on nosocomial infections between year 2003 and 2007 were retrieved and reviewed. The overall patient nosocomial infection rate, the incidence density rate of nosocomial infections, the excess length of stay, and distribution of nosocomial infection sites were determined. Then, pathogen and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles were further investigated.",

One plausible explanation is that in the early of 2003 the country was suffering from the outbreak of highly infectious pneumonia, namely severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Due to the massive campaign to prevent the spread of SARS, nosocomial infections were indirectly reduced. Being fatigued from the campaign over the previous year, disinfection and sterilization procedures might be loosen in 2004, explaining the moderate rebound in 2004. However, the incidence density rate of nosocomial infections was the lowest in 2004, due to considerably longer stay of some patients in the ICU (Table 1).",

In addition, there was a high proportion (80.0%) of E. coli isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin, whereas the rate was less than 10% in UK and the United States.[26,27] These findings indicate that treatment with these antimicrobial agents for nosocomial infections caused by E. coli in China is likely to result in clinical failure in a substantial proportion of patients. We also found that a considerable number of P. aeruginosa isolates were resistant to fluoroquinolones, from 41.3% to ciprofloxacin to 66.9% to levofloxacin, which is comparable with the fluoroquinolone-resistant rates (49% to 64%) reported for patients in 55 ICUs of eight developing countries,[9] but much higher than that (30%) reported in the United States.[28] All S. aureus isolates in the present study were sensitive to vancomycin, which was similar to the observation by Tsuji et al in Japan.[29] In addition, we observed relatively low resistant rates to nitrofurantoin (24.0%) and TMP/SMX (37.9%), which renders these antimicrobial agents suitable for empirical treatment for S. aureus infections.",

            "text": "The present study has some limitations, due to the retrospective nature. First, data on risk factors, except for the use of the medical device, that are potentially associated with nosocomial infections were not available. These factors may include the primary diseases for admission to the ICU, patient resting posture (e.g. semirecumbent or supine body position), continuous prophylactic use of anti-peptic ulcer drugs, utilization of the alcohol-based handrubs and oral care, which need to be taken into consideration in the prospective studies. Second, the data on the identification and isolation of the pathogens and their susceptibility were available only for half of the nosocomial infections. It would produce more accurate data if these numbers were increased. Finally, the data on the clinical consequences were not available for most cases, making it impossible to compare the clinical outcomes between patients with and those without nosocomial infections. However, the present study was able to show that the length of stay in the hospital was significantly increased in patients with nosocomial infections, compared with those without the infections.",
