            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is one of the most significant infectious diseases for the pig industry worldwide and causes severe economic losses [1]. The etiological agent is PRRS virus (PRRSV), which belongs to the family Arteriviridae in the order Nidovirales [2] and possesses a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of 15.4 kb in size [3\u20136]. Two distinct genotypes have been reported for PRRSV: European (type I) and North American (type II) genotypes [7, 8]. The PRRSV genome contains 10 open reading frames (ORFs) including the newly identified ORF5a [9, 10]. ORF1a is translated to produce the PP1a polyproteins, but ORF1b is expressed as a fusion with ORF1a by ribosomal frameshifting and produces the PP1a/b fusion polyproteins. PP1a and PP1a/b are cotranslationally processed into 14 cleavage products. These products are nonstructural proteins (nsps) that are believed to participate in viral genome replication and subgenomic mRNA transcription [11\u201313]. Of these, nsp11 is a 223 amino acid protein and contains a nidovirus-specific domain, termed NendoU, in the C-terminal region. NendoU is known to contain an endoribonuclease activity and consists of two subdomains, A and B [4, 14\u201316]. Mutational studies using equine arteritis virus (EAV) nsp11, which is a homolog of PRRSV nsp11, show that three enzymatically catalytic sites reside in subdomain A, while two aspartic acids in subdomain B are responsible for the overall protein structure [16]. In EAV, nsp11 plays a key role in viral RNA synthesis and thus it may also be essential for PRRSV replication. Recently, PRRSV has been shown to modulate type I IFN response [17] and nsp11 has been suggested to participate in the modulation of IFN response [18].",

Based on the microarray data, five major cellular pathways were identified to be regulated by nsp11, and of the five pathways the cell cycle pathway was examined.

A 5 mL overnight culture was started using LB broth containing ampicillin (1 \u03bcL/mL) by inoculating with transformed bacteria at 37\u00b0C with vigorous agitation. In the following morning, 500 mL of 2xYT (16 g of tryptone, 10 g of yeast extract, and 5 g of NaCl per L) containing ampicillin was inoculated with the 5 mL overnight culture. The culture was incubated at 37\u00b0C for approximately 4 h and when the optical density at 600 reached 0.6\u20130.8, protein expression was induced by adding IPTG up to 1 mM concentration. The culture was incubated for additional 2 h. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 7700 \u00d7g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C.

After sonication, the samples were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 30 min (J2-21; Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA), and supernatants and pellets were collected separately and subjected to SDS-PAGE individually to determine the presence of nsp11-K3779A protein for each fraction. Nsp11 was purified from the supernatants and concentrated to 1 mg/mL using the HisTrap column according to the manufacturer's instruction (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA). A total of 2 mg of nsp11 was used to immunize a rabbit 5 times at 2-week intervals, intramuscularly using Freund's incomplete and complete adjuvants, and an anti-PRRSV-nsp11 rabbit serum was generated (Immunological Research Center, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL, USA).

The quantity and quality of RNA were determined using an Align 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). The RNA samples were then subjected to microarray using Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays (Affymetrix UK Ltd., High Wycombe, UK) at Keck Biotechnology Center (University of Illinois, Urbana, IL). The microarray was repeated twice in triplicate each. For data analyses, quality control assessments, data processing, and statistical analyses were conducted using the package from the Bioconductor project [22] as indicated below. The Affymetrix's Human Gene 1.0 ST array contained probes to interrogate 253,002 exons representing 28,536 annotated genes. Comparisons were made either on the exon-level to investigate alternative splicing or on the whole gene-level to summarize all transcripts of the gene. The individual probe values were background-corrected, normalized, and summarized into one value at both the exon- and gene-levels using the robust multiarray average (RMA) algorithm available from the oligo packages [23]. Testing for differential gene expressions between MARC-145 cells and MARC-nsp11 cells was conducted separately at the exon- and gene-levels by fitting a linear model including a term to account for the separate processing batches using the Linear Models for Microarray Data (Limma) package [24, 25]. The criteria for significance varied for the exon- and gene-levels. At the exon-level, the criteria were at least a 2-fold change and a raw P value <0.02, resulting in 8,693 significant exons. At the gene-level, the Limma model was fit and raw P values were calculated using all genes on the array, but the correction for multiple hypothesis testing using the FDR (false discovery rate) method [26] was done for only the 9,241 genes that varied in expression across all the samples of at least a 1.5-fold change. The criteria used to select significant genes within the filtered database for upregulation and downregulation were FDR P value <0.1 and fold change >2 or <\u22122, respectively.",

The medium was removed and cells were incubated for a 10 min, 20 min, or 24 h pulse in the BrdU labeling medium. For the 10 min and 20 min pulses, 10 \u03bcM of BrdU was applied, and for the 24 h pulse 100 nM of BrdU was applied. After BrdU incubation, cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min and washed with PBS three times. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 7 min on ice followed by blocking with 1% normal goat serum (NGS) in PBS three times, 10 min each. To observe the nuclei of cells, an anti-lamin (1 : 200) rabbit antibody was used as the primary antibody for 1 h in PBS containing 1% NGS, and cells were incubated with a donkey anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with Texas-red (1 : 1000) for 30 min. Followed by washing four times, 5 min each, 2% paraformaldehyde was used again to fix the bound antibodies. Cells were then incubated with 4N HCl for 25 min at room temperature to denature DNA and to allow the BrdU antibody to recognize the incorporated BrdU in the nuclei. After three 10 min washes with PBS and two 10 min washes with 1% NGS in PBS, an anti-BrdU monoclonal antibody (1 : 500) was applied to cells for 90 min. Cells were then incubated with a goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated with FITC (1 : 600) for 30 min. Washing with PBS was applied four times after every incubation with antibodies. The cover slips were mounted on microscope slides in the mounting buffer and visualized using a Zeiss Axio Imager z1 fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc.) equipped with Chroma filters (Chroma Technology). Images were collected using AxioVision Software (Zeiss) and Hamamatsu ORCA cooled CCD camera. The BrdU-incorporated cells and a total number of lamin-positive cells were counted for both MARC-145 and MARC-nsp11 cells, and the % of BrdU incorporation was calculated using the formula as follows: % BrdU incorporation = (number of double-positive cells for BrdU and lamin)/(200 lamin-positive cells) \u00d7 100.

MARC-145 cells were infected with the lentivirus containing the nsp11 gene from PRRSV strain FL12 and G418 (neomycin)-resistant cells were selected. A total of seven drug-resistant clones were obtained and they were individually propagated for analyses. Cellular DNA was extracted from each clone, and PCR was conducted to determine gene integration. All clones were PCR-positive for nsp11 (Figure 1(a)), and cell clone \u201ca\u201d was chosen for further characterization and designated MARC-nsp11. The chosen cell clone was examined for nsp11 mRNA by RT-PCR using primers indicated in Table 2, and a 660 bp fragment was specifically amplified (Figure 1(b)). The nsp11 protein expression was also determined by immunoprecipitation using a rabbit anti-nsp11 antibody. A 26 kD protein was specifically identified in MARC-nsp11 cells at a low level (Figure 1(c), lane 3), and the same size protein was identified in nsp11 gene-transfected cells (Figure 1(c), lane 2), demonstrating the expression of nsp11 in these cells.",

DUSPs regulate the cellular localization and activity of MAPK which functions in the negative feedback loop of ERK regulation [30]. DUSP1 dephosphorylates ERK in the nucleus and allows its trafficking to the cytoplasm [31], while DUSP6 causes the cytoplasmic retention of ERK2 [31]. C-Jun/AP-1 and c-Fos genes were also upregulated in our study, which can be activated by JNK and p38 MAPK [32]. For the proteasome pathways, three (PSMD3, PSMB10, and PSMA7) out of five are proteasome subunits, and their upregulation suggests an enhanced effect on the proteasomal pathways by nsp11. SUMO1 (small ubiquitin-like modifier 1) has multiple functions by attaching itself to substrates referred to as sumoylation. After sumoylation, protein may undergo degradation through the proteasome [33, 34].",

BrdU is a nucleotide analog and thus can be incorporated into replicating DNA, whereas lamin proteins are major architectural proteins of the nuclear lining inside the nuclear membrane in cells. Thus, all cells are anticipated to be stained with an anti-lamin antibody, whereas only cells synthesizing new DNA in the S phase are presumed to be stained with an anti-BrdU antibody. A short pulse of 10 min or 20 min would detect BrdU incorporation in a single cell cycle, whereas a longer time incubation of 24 h would detect multiple cell cycles and thus the majority of normal cells would be positive for BrdU staining (Figure 5(a)). A total of 200 lamin-positive cells (in red) were randomly chosen for each slide, and BrdU positive cells (in green) out of the lamin-positive cells were counted to determine BrdU incorporation rates using the formula described in Materials and Methods. MARC-nsp11 cells exhibited less numbers of BrdU-positive cells after the 10 min and 20 min pulses compared to those of MARC-145 cells (Figure 5(a)), and their BrdU incorporation rates dropped from 47.07% (white bar) to 38.07% (black bar) (P < 0.005) and from 57.8% (white bar) to 44% (black bar) (P < 0.005), respectively (Figure 5(b)). After 24 h of labeling, a greater reduction of BrdU staining was observed for MARC-nsp11 cells, where the percentage of BrdU incorporation decreased from 92% (while bar) to 49.73% (black bar) (P < 0.001; Figure 5(b)). The intensity of BrdU staining in MARC-nsp11 cells was also significantly reduced after the 24 h pulse compared to that of MARC-145 cells (Figure 5(a)), demonstrating the substantial suppression of DNA synthesis by nsp11. Both flow cytometry and BrdU staining data indicate that nsp11 slows down the cell cycle progression through the S phase.",

The microarray studies identified 170 differentially regulated cellular genes with the threshold of 2. Of these, 104 genes were downregulated and 66 genes were upregulated, and many of these genes were able to be placed according to their functional relevance into 5 different pathways: histone-related proteins, cell cycle and DNA replication, MAPK signaling, ubiquitin-proteasome, and the complement system. Compared to previous studies [19, 20], the genes identified in our study were fewer in number and less in diverse. This is probably because the regulated genes identified in our study were exclusively nsp11-specific, whereas the genes in the previous studies were responders to the entire spectrum of viral proteins. Thus, nsp11-regulated genes were mostly included in the previously identified genes. Zhou et al. [20] also showed that the genes relevant to cell cycle and DNA replication were regulated by highly pathogenic (HP)-PRRSV in PAMs. Chromosome organizing proteins were also regulated by nsp11, and proteins regulating the complement system for tissue remolding and inflammation were also found in our study. c-Jun and c-Fos are two effectors of the MAPK signaling pathway, and they were specifically upregulated during PRRSV infection [19]. PRRSV-mediated activation of the MAPK signaling pathway and the increase of JNK and p38 phosphorylation have recently been demonstrated [40], which is also in support of our findings.",

It appears that the cell cycle progression was delayed at the S phase in nsp11-expressing cells compared to MARC-145 cells. A similar observation was recently made for coronavirus in cells expressing nsp15, which is a coronavirus homolog of PRRSV nsp11 [41]. In that study, SARS-CoV nsp15 was shown to downregulate the retinoblastoma (Rb) activity which is responsible for cell proliferation. As a consequence, a higher percentage of cells was accumulating at the S phase when expressing nsp15, supporting our observation of slower cell cycle progression in nsp11-expressing cells. The S phase tardiness may be associated with an altered DNA replication, since several MCM proteins, which are components of DNA helicase, were upregulated (Table 1). It is possible that the increase of helicase proteins might have caused a malfunction of the replication fork and thus the inhibition of DNA synthesis in MARC-nsp11 cells.",

            "text": "Virus-mediated cell cycle regulation is not uncommon and can be beneficial to viruses. In particular, it is true for DNA viruses replicating in the nucleus such as SV40, herpes simplex virus, and adeno-associated virus, in which by arresting the cell cycle of infected cells, the cellular DNA replicative machinery may be captured and utilized for viral DNA replication [42\u201344]. For RNA viruses, influenza virus replication has been shown to be regulated by helicase and the MCM complex consisting of MCM2-7 [45]. The interaction between the influenza virus PA polymerase and MCM complex increases the stability of RNA polymerase. In our study, MCM2, MCM4, and MCM5 were upregulated by nsp11. Even though the PRRSV replicates in the cytoplasm, the cell cycle regulation may be considered beneficial for the virus, since an available pool of cellular machineries can be maximally utilized towards the production of progeny at an early stage of infection. For PRRSV, nucleocapsid (N) protein has also been suggested to regulate the cell cycle progression by modulating the ribosomal RNA synthesis in the nucleolus [46]. Thus, it is possible that N and nsp11 may both regulate the cell cycle progression and facilitate virus production by targeting different cellular components modulating the host cell cycle. The N protein is an RNA-binding protein which contains the nuclear localization signal (NLS) and thus localizes in the nucleus and nucleolus. By yeast 2-hybrid screening, the inhibitor of MyoD family a (I-mfa) domain-containing protein was identified interacting with PRRSV N [47]. Since the I-mfa domain-containing protein interacts with cyclin T1 [48], which participates in the control of the cell cycle, this interaction suggests a regulatory role of N for the cell cycle [17]. Different from N, nsp11 resides in the cytoplasm and contains an endoribonuclease activity. Nsp11 may alter the function or expression of cytoplasmic cellular components such as mRNA modification, which may then result in the regulation of the cell cycle. Indeed, modification of cellular mRNA by nsp11 has been suggested previously [49]. In summary, our data show that the PRRSV nsp11 protein is responsible for the delay of the S phase and thus, together with N, may regulate the cell cycle progression. N functions in the nucleus and nsp11 functions in the cytoplasm.",
