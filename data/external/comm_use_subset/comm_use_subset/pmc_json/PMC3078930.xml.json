However, in practice, acute lower respiratory infection accounts for most of the serious disease burden. ARI causes about 20% of all deaths in pre-school children worldwide, with 90% of these deaths being due to pneumonia. Risk factors for severe ARI include malnutrition, low birth weight, passive smoking, non-breastfeeding, low socio-economic status, overcrowding, immunodeficiency and HIV infection, and consequently, most of the morbidity associated with ARI is found in the developing world.[3], [4], [5]\n",

Perceived wisdom and published literature state that Mpp is a well-recognised cause of community-acquired pneumonia in older children and adults,[27] but a less common cause in preschool children, although few studies have examined prevalence in this age group.[12] Thus our findings that Mpp could be detected in approximately 10% of all children with ARI and 17% of hospitalised pneumonia cases is important and has potential implications for management, given that current treatment guidelines for pneumonia in this age group do not include macrolide antibiotics.[28] Interestingly, Mpp was more likely to be detected in hospitalised than ambulatory children with bronchiolitis, a finding which may in part reflect the difficulties in clinically distinguishing between pneumonia and bronchiolitis in young children.",

While this may be because we had smaller numbers of children in the very mild and severe categories, co-infection was consistently between 39\u201342% across all groups. Our study was also not powered to detect whether particular pathogen combinations were associated with more severe disease. Similarly, severe disease was no more or less common in those children in whom pathogens were not detected. In these children, one might speculate about possible infection with \u2018typical\u2019 bacteria such as Streptococcus and Haemophilus, although it is equally possible that viruses as yet unknown could have caused their symptoms.",

Equally, while the study screened more pathogens than most published studies, some pathogens, such as Bordetella pertussis were not included. Other valid criticisms include that real-time PCR may be overly sensitive and that pathogen detection in the nasopharynx may not accurately reflect the situation in the lower respiratory tract. While neither criticism is limited to our study, we have tried to investigate the importance of our findings by putting them in the context of disease severity and clinical manifestation.",
