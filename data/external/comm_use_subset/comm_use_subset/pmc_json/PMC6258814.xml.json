            "text": "Community acquired respiratory virus infections (CARV) include a variety of viruses such as rhinovirus, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus, Para influenza virus, and metapneumo virus. CARV infections range from asymptomatic carriership to significant respiratory disease. Prevalence of CARV largely depends on season, detection mode, age of patient and immune status (Shah et al., 2012; Hirsch et al., 2013; Green, 2017). Influenza and RSV have significant seasonal variation, whereas Para influenza or rhinovirus cause disease year round (Green, 2017). Highly sensitive diagnostic techniques like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of viral DNA and RNA reveal a high prevalence of CARV in the normal population. In healthy children attending day care prevalence is as high as 40% (Moe et al., 2016). In children admitted to hospital for respiratory disease 43\u201375% are tested PCR positive, almost twice as high as in adults admitted to hospital for respiratory disease (Ching et al., 2018). In the immune compromised pediatric population the prevalence of CARV is around 50\u201380% (Fazekas et al., 2012) with mostly mild symptoms at time of detection.",

Progression to LRTI occurs in 18\u201355% (Shah et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2014; Fisher et al., 2017), with risk factors for progression related to age, donor source, use of steroids, immune status, and concomitant infections (Renaud et al., 2013; Chemaly et al., 2014b; Kim et al., 2014; Shah et al., 2014). Mortality rates are around 10% (Chemaly et al., 2014a; Robinson et al., 2015; Fisher et al., 2017) It is important to notice the in most pediatric studies, RSV-positive patients were treated with the antiviral drug ribavirin (Molinos-Quintana et al., 2013), with anti-RSV monoclonal antibodies (palivizumab) or with non-specific intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) (El-Bietar et al., 2016), or with a combination (Ch\u00e1vez-Bueno et al., 2007).

This holds true for HCT, but is also recognized in solid organ transplantation. In the context of lung transplantation several studies have examined the role of RV in the development of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD), a form of chronic rejection of the lung (Kumar et al., 2005, 2010; Fisher et al., 2016). Many, but not all, reported an association between RV and CLAD. Pooled analyses of studies on RV and CLAD (Vu et al., 2011) did not confirm the association, mainly due to the heterogeneity of studies and limitations in design, diagnostic techniques and definitions. Fisher et al. tried to overcome these limitations by studying a more homogenous cohort of lung transplant recipients, using modern molecular assays to detect RV and applying consensus definitions of CLAD (Fisher et al., 2016). In 250 patients, 50 (20%) developed CLAD at a median of 95 weeks (interquartile range (IQR): 53\u2013157 weeks). In 79 patients (31.6%) a respiratory viral episode was seen, after a median of 19 weeks post lung transplantation (IQR: 9\u201363 weeks). In multivariate analysis RV was associated with CLAD (HR1.9, 95% CI 1.1\u20133.5; p = 0.03). This association was stronger the more proximate the RV occurred after lung transplantation.",

Allo-immune lung syndrome (Allo-LS), defined as Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome (BOS) or Idiopathic Pneumonia Syndrome (IPS), occurred in 13%, after a median of 8.5 weeks (1\u201328 weeks). RV-positivity in BAL was a predictor for Allo-LS (HR 3.8, 95% CI 1.4\u201310.7; p = 0.01). No other predictors were found. The hypothesis is that RV causes epithelial damage and triggers an allogeneic immune response leading to severe lung disease. So the lung disease does not occur primarily from progressive viral infection during the period of low immunity, but from allo-immune mediated damage weeks after HCT.",

But the microbial ecosystem at other body sites, including the respiratory tract is attracting growing attention. Host and environmental factors influencing the respiratory microbiota include genetics, microbial exposure (birth mode, feeding type, day care), vaccination, infections and antibiotics (Man et al., 2017). Viral infection interacts with the microbiome by disrupting the airway epithelial barrier facilitating bacterial adhesion, liberating host derived nutrients and decreasing muco-ciliary clearance. In addition respiratory viruses can modulate innate and adaptive immune responses promoting bacterial colonization (Man et al., 2017). Moreover, it is becoming clear that the virome should be seen as a part of the microbiome, that affects the function of the host immune system (Cadwell, 2015). The role of a disturbed respiratory microbiome/virome in lung disease is postulated for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (Zou et al., 2016).",

One can argue if this holds true for respiratory viruses detected by PCR. The detection modes have become much more sensitive over time, so the impact of positive findings on the disease criteria should be reevaluated.
