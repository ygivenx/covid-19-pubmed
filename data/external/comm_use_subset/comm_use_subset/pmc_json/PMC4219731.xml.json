The disease is characterized by high fever, nasal and ocular discharges, pneumonia, necrotic and ulcerative lesions of the mucus membranes and inflammation of the gastro-intestinal tract [1]. PPRV infection results in great economic losses and affects productivity of sheep and goats subsequent to the global eradication of Rinderpest [2]. For example, in 2004, the economic cost of PPRV in India was estimated to be 1800 million Indian rupees (US$ 39 million) per year [2], [3]. PPRV replication and seroconversion has been demonstrated in large ruminants [4]. There is a solitary report on clinical PPRV occurring in water buffalo [5], although it has not been confirmed in later studies. In September 2004, outbreaks of PPR in Sudan affected both sheep and camels [6].",

Goats appear not to be affected in some outbreaks, while sheep suffer with high rates of mortality and morbidity [10]. Strain specific virulence of PPRV has been reported when the same breed of goats were experimentally infected [11], and different breeds of goat have been shown to respond differently to infection with the same virus [12]. Species-specific disease occurrence has been observed with foot and mouth disease, where cattle were highly affected while sheep had less severe infection with the virus [13]. Epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus affects cattle but sheep do not suffer from this disease [14]. It is well recognised that ducks were generally resistant to avian influenza virus (AIV) whereas chickens suffer from severe disease with rapid death following infection with highly pathogenic AIV [15]. The reason for this species specificity is unclear at present.",

TLR are differentially expressed in various tissues and immune cells of water buffalo and goats, and have been shown to induce differential immune responses [22], [23].

Increased mortality in lambs/kids, and increased susceptibility of West African goats, especially dwarf goats, compared to their European counterparts have been documented [11]. Differential susceptibility of goat breeds within India have also been reported [35]. Host genetic factors, in particular the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes, may influence susceptibility to disease. Virus recognition can be influenced by genetic mutations in the interaction domains between virus and host receptors. In particular, non-MHC genetic variations in host TLR may cause reduced pathogen recognition and hamper innate immune activation [36]. Studies on Maedi-Visna infection in sheep indicate that breed dependent susceptibility to the disease as well as individual susceptibility within the breed may be defined by specific polymorphisms in TLR7 and TLR8 genes [37]. In a related morbillivirus, SNPs in TLR 3, 4, 5, 6 and associated signalling molecules like Myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) and MD2 affected immune responses to the measles vaccine in human subjects [38].",

TLR3 is a key sensor of viral infection, as most viruses will produce dsRNA at some stage of its life cycle. TLR7 is highly expressed in immune cells like plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), which produce substantial amounts of type I IFNs in response to viral RNA. In our study, the basal levels of TLR3 and TLR7 were significantly higher in the PBMCs of PPRV resistant goat breeds, Kanni and Salem Black. Engagement of both TLR3 and TLR7 with the synthetic ligands poly I:C and imiquimod respectively, led to the suppression of PPRV RNA and infectious virus yield in PBMC of goats. This indicates that TLR3 and 7 play a role in the recognition of PPRV RNA by goat PBMC, though the role of cytosolic RNA sensors like Retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIGI) and Melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) have not been analyzed in this study and cannot be ruled out. Almost complete abrogation of viral gene expression was observed after stimulation by poly I:C. This may be because poly I:C can also be recognized by other sensors, including RIGI, MDA5 and Protein kinase R (PKR) [39].",

The cell surface receptor for PPRV, the SLAM is expressed at lower levels in buffalo than goats [16]. However, we did see virus replication in infected PBMC although at considerably reduced levels suggesting that the cells of water buffalo are permissive to PPRV infection. Therefore, we questioned whether these differences are reflected at the level of multi-cycle virus replication. PPRV replication in water buffalo PBMC was significantly lower than in goats, possibly because of enhanced type I IFN production in these species upon virus infection. PPRV replication in human IFN\u03b1 pre-treated Vero cells or in PBMC pre-treated with CM from virus infected cells was significantly lower even at very low doses, confirming the role of type I IFN in limiting virus replication. Human IFN\u03b1 has been shown to effectively suppress the replication of bovine viral diarrhea virus and bovine parainfluenza virus [40], [41].",

            "text": "Cytokines play a pivotal role in the induction and modulation of immunological responses. TLR signaling events lead to the activation of nuclear factor kapp-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF\u03baB) and interferon regulatory factor (IRF), which switch on expression of a specific panel of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as TNF\u03b1, IL6, IL8 and Regulated on activation, Normal T cells (RANTES) [19]. Activation of TLR by viruses also results in the production and release of type I IFNs [39]. TLR3 and TLR7 engagement by synthetic ligands lead to cytokine expression profiles similar to PPRV infection except for a weak IL1\u03b2, IL6 and IL8 production in goat PBMC. A predominantly inflammatory cytokine repertoire, with expression of TNF\u03b1, IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 was observed at both mRNA and protein levels. Thus, it could be inferred that TLR engagement upon PPRV infection results in inflammatory cytokine production via the canonical NF\u03baB pathway and type I IFN production via the activation of IRFs [42]. Stimulation of TLR7 with synthetic RNA oligonucleotides has earlier been shown to induce production of IL-12, TNF\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 in PBMC of cattle [43]. Interestingly, in our study, IFN\u03b3 levels were higher in PPRV infected PBMC, compared to the engagement of TLR3/7 by their respective agonists. IFN\u03b3 production by NK cells can be induced by IL12 secreted by TLR stimulated DCs [44]. In buffalos, approximately 1.5 fold higher levels of IFN\u03b1 at mRNA and protein levels were induced in PBMC compared to goats after infection with PPRV suggesting that type I IFN may play a role in limiting virus replication in buffalo. Further, we found that TLR7 mediated IFN\u03b1 production is critical because TLR7 antagonist inhibited IFN\u03b1 production both in Imiquimod or PPRV-treated goat and buffalo PBMC. This effect was more prominent in buffalo PBMC suggesting that TLR7 mediated IFN\u03b1 production determines PPRV replication efficiency in this species.",

IL10 is a key regulatory cytokine with immunosuppressive properties that helps to regulate an uncontrolled inflammatory response [45]. In addition to preventing the maturation of antigen presenting cells, IL10 can also regulate the proliferation and differentiation of Th1 cells, which induces T cell-dependent suppression of antiviral responses [46], [47]. Dexamethasone, a well-known immunosuppressive drug, induces immunosuppression by altering the expression levels of IL10 and TNF\u03b1 [48]. Experimental immunosuppression of goat with dexamethasone and challenge with virulent PPRV indicated that, immunosuppressed goats had a shorter viremia, more extensive and severe disease advancement, significant decrease in the number of leucocytes, high antigen load in various organs and higher mortality rate than the non-immunosuppressed goats [49], [50]. Taken together, it appears that a higher basal expression of TLR3 and TLR7 in Kanni and Salem breeds may correlate with increased inflammatory cytokine expression with lower levels of immunomodulatory cytokines leading to an enhanced antiviral state thus affording reduced susceptibility to PPRV infection. Similarly, in buffalo, the TLR-7 mediated type I IFN response upon infection may afford resistance to PPRV.",

Nucleotide sequence homology studies have shown a close relationship with other ruminant species, particularly sheep TLR7 [51]. Earlier studies in 12 Indian goat breeds have shown a total of 22 polymorphic sites, out of which 19 were present within the coding region and three in the 3\u2032UTR [41]. The Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain sequence is highly conserved between species, as it plays a crucial role in TLR downstream signaling [52]. In our study, sequence analysis revealed five nucleotide changes in the TLR7 coding region and two nucleotide changes in the 3\u2032UTR. All the changes were synonymous and it is difficult to establish a correlation with specific SNP and altered susceptibility to PPRV in the goat breeds examined. There were no differences in the leucine repeat regions of TLR7 between different breeds of goats. Though, we were unable to demonstrate a positive association between SNP and differential susceptibility to PPRV in the goat TLR7 gene, analyses of other immune genes including TLR3 and TLR4 may indicate the relationship between susceptibility to PPRV infection and genetic polymorphisms in the host. Earlier studies in buffalo TLR7 gene have also reported four different polymorphic positions (A/G-1400, A/G-1480 (D234N), C/T-2029 (L417F), A/G-2640), of which two were non synonymous SNP\u2019s in leucine rich repeats (LRR) [53]. Given the presence of SNP\u2019s in LRR of buffalo TLR7 gene, which is responsible for sensing the PAMP\u2019s, these SNP\u2019s could be associated with differential sensing of PPRV. Further studies are required to correlate the reported SNP\u2019s in buffalo TLR7 with observed differential response of buffalo PBMC to PPRV.",

Compared to goats, elevated type I IFN levels after PPRV infection in water buffaloes may afford reduced virus replication and possibly early virus clearance.
