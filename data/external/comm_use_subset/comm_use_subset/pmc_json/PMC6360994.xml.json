            "text": "The human microbiota communities and their genes are an intriguing ecosystem that play an essential role for human body functions including food digestion, nutrition, regulation of human metabolism, and regulation of immune defense against infections, among others (Zhu et al., 2010). The majority of microorganisms of the human ecosystem act as symbionts that co-evolve and co-adapt with their human host according to their diet, life-style, human genetic characteristics, immune modulation, or environment parameters (Dethlefsen et al., 2007). Particularly in samples from the respiratory tract, the variability in bacterial composition between individuals has been described to be so high that a core microbiome could not be defined at the species level (Bogaert et al., 2011). Despite this inter-individual variability, the bacterial composition of each person has been proposed to fall within discrete categories where some bacterial taxa dominate the community. The presence of these structured microbial consortia was first described in the gut, where three groups or \u201centerotypes\u201d were found, dominated by Bacteroides, Prevotella, or Ruminococcus (Arumugam et al., 2011). However, the notion of enterotypes is currently under debate, and it is still not clear whether enterotypes can be generalized to the general population, or whether microbiota follows in fact a gradient in taxonomic composition (Jeffery et al., 2012). In children between 1 and 3 months of age, for instance, the hypopharynx was found to contain four or five community types, and these \u201cpneumotypes\u201d followed specific trajectories during the child's development (Mortensen et al., 2016). In adults, bronchoalveolar lavage samples showed two distinct pneumotypes, one of which was enriched with oral microorganisms (particularly Prevotella and Veillonella) and appeared to be associated with higher inflammatory markers (Segal et al., 2013). Thus, studying the bacterial community structures in the respiratory tract could be important to understand susceptibility to Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) or to pulmonary infections like pneumococcal pneumonia or, more extensively, Invasive Pneumococcal Disease (IPD).",

            "text": "It has been proposed that the degree of stability of the microbiota depends partly on the first colonization by keystone species in the first days of life (Relman, 2012). Natural feed of humans in their early days is breastfeeding, so human milk is expected to be a major supplier of keystone species for human microbiota development, including the respiratory tract, given the high microbial diversity in colostrum, transition, and mature milk (Hunt et al., 2011; Cabrera-Rubio et al., 2012). In addition, breast milk provides macronutrients, micronutrients and bioactive molecules that protect against infections and inflammation and are key factors for human growth and development (Ballard and Morrow, 2013). Another source of resilience to infection is provided by the antagonistic interactions between the local microbiota and the invasive species. For instance, the nasal passage inhabitant Corynebacterium accolens appears to be over-represented in children without Streptococcus pneumoniae nasal colonization and has been shown to release antipneumococcal free fatty acids from human skin surface triacylglycerols (Bomar et al., 2016). Other commensal bacteria produce antimicrobial peptides that have been shown to inhibit oral pathogens (L\u00f3pez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2017) and prevent pharynx infections in children (Di Pierro et al., 2014). Thus, understanding microbiota composition and structure in respiratory samples will be instrumental for establishing disease risk and for the development of probiotics that could be used to colonize the respiratory tract and contribute to the prevention of infections (Tagg and Dierksen, 2003; Medina et al., 2008).",

To test this hypothesis, the objective of the present study was to characterize the nasopharyngeal microbiota profiles in two groups of children: (i) children with invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), considered as a case group whose nasopharyngeal microbiota was suffering an important disturbance; and (ii) a matched control group of healthy children representative of a healthy nasopharyngeal niche. A series of epidemiological, microbiological, and clinical variables related with major risk of developing IPD were considered to compare microbiota profiles in the two groups. For robust characterization of bacterial composition, a long-fragment 16S sequencing approach was used, in which a 780 bp region of the gene was amplified and sequenced in order to improve taxonomic assignment.",

One healthy control that was treated at Sant Joan de Deu hospital for minor surgery (i.e., phimosis or minor dermatologic surgery) was selected for each case. Cases and controls were matched by age, sex, and seasonality, given previous evidence of seasonal influence on the microbiota composition of respiratory samples (Bogaert et al., 2011).

Among microbiological variables we assessed carriers of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) serotypes, invasiveness potential of nasopharyngeal S. pneumoniae serotypes and co-colonization with respiratory viruses. Serotypes were classified according to the studies of Brueggemann et al. (2003), Sleeman et al. (2006), and del Amo et al. (2014). Serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 7F, 8, 9A, 9V, 12F, 14, 18C, and 19A were considered to have a high-attack rate or highly-invasive serotypes whereas the remainder were considered as low-attack rate or non-highly-invasive or opportunistic serotypes.

The microbiological confirmation of the patients is based on one technique, the other or both together. All pneumococcal isolates were identified by standard microbiological methods, including the optochin sensitivity test and an antigenic test targeting the capsular polysaccharide (Slidex pneumo-kit, bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy-l'Etolie, France). DNA detection of pneumococcal LytA gene was performed by a duplex real-time PCR as previously reported (Selva et al., 2014; del Amo et al., 2015). This duplex real-time PCR also included as target the Rnase P human single-copy gene to detect and measure the number of human cells (Brotons et al., 2017), using primers and probes recommended by CDC (Meningitis, 2011). Absolute quantification of RNAseP using PCR can be used to estimate the number of human cells present in the clinical samples. The measure of Human DNA load was then used to normalize by potential differences in sample amount and avoid potential bias between samples. In addition, DNA was measured prior to PCR and concentrations adjusted to minimize amplification bias between samples. Capsular typing was carried out by a molecular technique based on automated fluorescent fragment analysis which allows differentiation of 40 serotypes (Selva et al., 2014). Quellung reaction performed at the National Center for Microbiology (Majadahonda, Madrid) was used to complete serotyping in invasive strains isolated by culture.",

Alpha diversity indexes were calculated from rarefied samples (1,000 sequences per sample), using the Shannon index (Shannon, 1948) for diversity and the Chao1 index (Chao, 1984) for richness. Beta diversity was also calculated with the rarefied 1,000 reads per sample using weighted and unweighted UniFrac (Lozupone et al., 2006) distance matrices, and the principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) generated 2D and 3D plots for all mapping fields. In addition, we clustered samples using UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean, also known as average linkage) (Michener and Sokal, 1957). Two-way comparisons in bacterial composition using the UniFrac metric (Lozupone et al. 2006) were used to measure whether the microbial communities in the microbiota types were significantly different. A tree with 1,000 reads from each sample was obtained, and microbiota types were considered significantly different if the UniFrac distance value for the tree was larger than expected if the sequences were randomly distributed. A thousand permutations were performed to obtain a P-value, using Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons. In addition, we also performed Constrained Correspondence Analysis (CCA), which is a statistic tool which emphasizes variation, and tests whether the factor provided (the microbiota type) can explain part of the total variability. This analysis was performed by the R software ade4 package (Dray and Dufour, 2007) using the Chi-squared distances-based function CCA. Adonis tests were done with the R library \u201cvegan\u201d (Oksanen et al., 2018) to determine corrected p-values.",

Samples appeared to cluster in three different groups, corresponding to three different types of respiratory tract microbiota, or nasopharyngeal-types (Figure 3). The Microbiota A was mainly composed of reads assigned to the genera Dolosigranulum (44.3%), Moraxella (29.3%), and Haemophilus (10.5%) (Figure 3A). The Microbiota B was represented mostly by the genera Streptococcus (36.9%), Staphylococcus (21.3%), Veillonella (9.8%), together with a high diversity of anaerobic genera as Prevotella and Porphyromonas (Figure 3B). Finally, the Microbiota C was composed mainly of the genera Haemophilus (52.1%), Moraxella (31.4%), and Streptococcus (11.4%) (Figure 3C). Thus, nasopharyngeal-type A was dominated by Dolosigranulum, nasopharyngeal-type C by Haemophilus, and nasopharyngeal-type B by Streptococcus, with a high presence of oral microorganisms. The three microbiota types were found to be significantly different from each other (Unifrac Distance, corrected p < 0.01 in all cases). In addition, CCA analysis showed that microbiota type significantly explained the variability in bacterial composition among samples (Adonis p-value: 0.002). In agreement with the existence of specific bacterial communities dominated by a given genus, negative correlations were found (Figure 4) between the three dominant genera (p-values for significant hyperbolic regressions were, respectively, 0.029, 0.011, and 0.029 for comparisons between Dolosigranulum and Streptococcus, Dolosigranulum and Haemophilus, and Streptococus and Haemophilus).",

(2016) similarly found higher nasopharyngeal microbiota diversity in elderly pneumonia patients compared to elderly healthy controls, whilst this difference was not found in adult patients. In ecological terms, these results are surprising since higher bacterial diversity is usually related with health (Turnbaugh et al., 2007), while lower bacterial diversity is associated with disease. It is noteworthy that patients with primary immunodeficiencies presented a higher microbiota diversity compared with healthy controls. This fact might correlate with an increase of immune system permissiveness for microbe colonization (Oh et al., 2013). Similarly, a local increase in bacterial diversity has been detected in polyps and tumor biopsies from patients with colorectal cancer (Mira-Pascual et al., 2015), a disease which has been associated with immune suppression at the affected tissues. The best studied case of immune-driven dysbiosis is probably gum disease, where the presence of the \u201ckeystone pathogen\u201d Porphyromonas gingivalis has been shown to induce a profound alteration of the immune system (Hajishengallis, 2011) facilitating the settlement of many species that produce inflammation. However, the increase in microbial diversity associated with dysbiosis in gum disease and cancer could not only be due to immune alteration but also to a nutritionally richer environment (Mira et al., 2017). In the respiratory tract of children with IPD, future investigations should elucidate whether the observed dysbiosis is a consequence of immune changes, increased nutrient availability or both. In periodontal disease, destructive inflammation generates abundant gum tissue breakdown products that serve as nutrients for proteolytic and saccharolytic bacteria to obtain essential amino-acids and iron, including degraded collagen, and heme-containing compounds (Hajishengallis et al., 2012). It is important to underline that Porphyromonas was one of the over-represented genera in IPD patients (Figure 2C). However, all reads belonging to this genus appeared to correspond to uncultured or unknown species (Table 2). We hope the present study stimulates research into the characterization of these potentially pathogenic species, including their potential involvement as keystone pathogens (Darveau et al., 2012).",

In our data, however, the correlation between Streptococcus and Veillonella levels in cases was not significant (R2 = 0.17, p > 0.1, Supplementary Figure 3) and therefore it is unknown whether streptococcal serotypes associated with IPD produce more lactate that those found in healthy children.

            "text": "In the current manuscript, the only statistically significant explanatory factor for these three microbiota profiles was the classification of patients into case or control groups. Streptococcus-dominated community (Microbiota B) was clearly associated to IPD patients. Given that Dolosigranulum abundance in the nasopharynx has been reported to be inversely associated with episodes of wheezing and mild respiratory tract infections (Biesbroek et al., 2014) we speculate that the Dolosigranulum-dominated community (Microbiota A) could be more resistant to pneumococcal infection occurrence and severity. Our hypothesis was supported by the lower number of cases with a Microbiota A-type (17.9% of the total) and by the fact that such cases experienced less severe manifestations of IPD and did not require intensive care. In this respect, it is suggestive that Dolosigranulum and Haemophilus are found in the present study to have a negative correlation with Streptococcus, the dominant genera in IPD cases (Figure 4). Moreover, the nasopharyngeal presence of Dolosigranulum has been associated with breastfeeding. It has been shown that lactation has a profound impact in the microbial community composition of the infant upper respiratory tract, increasing the prevalence and levels of Dolosigranulum and reducing the levels of Staphylococcus, Prevotella, or Veillonella (Biesbroek et al., 2014). In agreement with this, we found a considerably higher proportion of Microbiota A healthy controls that were breastfed and a trend for statistical significance in the relation between exclusive breastfeeding up to 6 months of age and case-control classification (p = 0.06) (Table 1). Despite the lack of statistical power to observe significance in these associations, the results obtained suggest that breastfeeding could have an important role in protection against pneumococcal infection. As far as for Haemophilus-dominated community (microbiota C), both IPD cases and healthy controls appear to fall within this microbiota profile. This genus, together with Moraxella, has been associated with higher rates of parent-reported upper respiratory infections and wheezing in the first years of life (Hyde et al., 2014; Bogaert et al., 2015). In fact, the group of children with Haemophilus and Moraxella-dominated microbiota showed a higher percentage of patients presenting a respiratory infection in the previous 30 days before the sample collection (68.2%), with a trend for significance (p = 0.07). However, future experimental work with a larger sample size should further explore the significance of these microbiota profiles and test whether the presence of a given nasopharyngeal microbiota makes individuals more sensitive or resistant to pneumococcal infection.",

            "text": "Our study describes the use of a long-amplicon sequencing approach of the 16S rRNA for species-level identification. Computer simulations show that taxonomic assignment accuracy, especially at the species level, decreases dramatically in short reads, like those of current Illumina or Ion Torrent technologies (Claesson et al., 2010), while the use of long-amplicon (\u2265500 bp) has been postulated as a good tool for species-level taxonomical assignments (Shin et al., 2016) and has been widely used as a diagnostic tool of bacterial infections in clinical samples (Guembe et al., 2013; Mart\u00ednez et al., 2016). However, we have found surprising results using 16S rRNA for species level identification since S. pneumoniae would be more frequent in controls than in cases. These results are discordant with the results generated from a real-time PCR targeting LytA gene, the target recommended by CDC for pneumococcal detection. LytA PCR indicated the presence of S. pneumoniae in 64.4% of cases vs. 57.1% in controls (Table 1). According to our results, taxonomic assignment by using 16S rRNA could be limited in some genera and accurate identification at the species level should be done with more conserved genes. It is important to keep in mind that streptococci are particularly similar in the 16S rRNA gene sequence, and therefore species-level assignment in this genus must be treated with caution (Ing et al., 2012). Even more, despite LytA is the recommended gene utilized for pneumococcal diagnosis according to CDC (National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, 2014), this target has been reported to misidentify the pathogen (Morales et al., 2015; Sim\u00f5es et al., 2016), may be showing the occurrence of genetic exchange among streptococcal species and opening the possibility that other etiological agents could be involved. Thus, future work should increase our understanding of these microbial consortia by accurate species-level identification.",

This lack of immune competence could be aggravated by limited breastfeeding lower than recommended by WHO and by the presence of keystone pathogens which need to be characterized and that could favor the overgrowth of many proteolytic anaerobic organisms from the oral cavity, giving rise to a dramatic dysbiosis. From an applied point of view, we found suggestive microbiota profiles associated to IPD (Streptococcus-dominated microbiota profile) or asymptomatic colonization (Dolosigranulum-dominated microbiota profile) that could be used, respectively, as disease biomarkers or to identify health-associated inhabitants of the respiratory tract. The characterization of beneficial bacteria could be useful to prevent pneumococcal infections by integrating those microorganisms in a probiotic formula. The present study suggests not only respiratory tract samples, but also breast milk, as a potential source of those beneficial bacteria.",
