In the field, PEDV can infect pigs of all ages, but the highest mortality often occurs to the newborns of one week old [6\u201310]. As a positive-stranded RNA virus, PEDV belongs to the genus Alpha-Coronavirus within the family Coronaviridae in the order Nidovirales [8, 11, 12]; it has a genomic size of about 28 kb that contains at least 7 ORFs. Of them, ORF1a and ORF1b encode replicase proteins important for viral replication and anti-host immunity, whereas other five ORFs code for structural/accessory proteins, including spike protein (S), ORF3, envelope (E), matrix protein (M) and nucleocapsid protein (N) [8, 11, 12].",

            "text": "The outbreak of PED can be dated back to early 1970s when England reported the first case in nursing piglets showing symptoms different from that of conventional transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) [13]. The etiological agent (CV777) however was not identified until 1978 by a group of scientists from Belgium with the full-length genome eventually determined in 2001 [2, 11]. Subsequently, PEDV spread across Europe and to countries in Asia including South Korea and China [14\u201317]. During the two decades from 1990 to 2009, the disease generally occurred in a sporadic, infrequent manner with a low positive rate due to the vaccination intervention (e.g., CV777, SM98, and DR-13, etc.) [14, 18, 19]. In China, PEDV was identified for the first time around 1984 [20, 21]. The emergence of the highly pathogenic PED appeared to be sudden; it began in late 2010 and hit hard on the Chinese swine farms in large scale [22\u201324]. Three years later, it stroke North America and killed at least 8 million pigs within a very short period of time, leading to colossal economic losses [25\u201329].",

During the last 5 years, the field has accumulated substantial knowledge about the epidemiology and genetic evolution of the PEDV variants [3, 4, 8, 22\u201325, 31, 32], but understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms has been hindered by the difficulties in isolation and propagation of the epidemic viruses in culture as well as in virus genome manipulation. Nevertheless, progresses have been made, in particular on the latter [23, 33\u201335]. In 2013, Li et al reported the first genetic manipulation of PEDV genome by using targeted genetic recombination in mammalian cells [36]. Following that, Jengarn et al engineered the infectious cDNA clone of PEDV into the bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) but based on a cell adapted G1 strain AVCT12 [34]. Most recently, two groups of scientists constructed the cDNA clones for the highly pathogenic PEDV strains of GIIa cluster (e.g., PC22A and AH2012/12); However, the full-length cDNA genomes were assembled by in vitro ligation of a set of contiguous cDNAs fragments of PEDV coupled with in vitro transcription to generate infectious viral RNA [33, 35].",

Due to the large size of segments C and D, we further divided C and D fragments into two parts (C1: nt 6808\u20139450, C2: 9450\u201313013; D1: 13013\u201316840; D2: 16840\u201321039) to minimize PCR-introduced mutation rate. In addition, the CMV promoter was added to the 5\u2019end of fragment A by overlapping PCR so that the PEDV genome transcription will be under control of this promoter. To enhance the proper processing of PEDV genome mRNA, hepatitis delta virus ribozyme core sequence and bovine growth hormone (BGH) polyadenylation signal were added to the 3\u2019 end of fragment F [37]. Each of the above fragments was PCR amplified, gel purified, and then cloned to pEASY-Blunt fast ligation vector (TransGen Biotech), and the correct clones were subsequently verified by DNA sequencing. The corresponding fragments were then PCR amplified and cloned into the BAC plasmid pBAC-I, an intermediate that has been modified based on plasmid pBleoBACII (NEB) to contain a restriction enzyme linker (NARI-FSEI-MLUI-PACI-APAI-SACII-ASCI-SPHI) to facilitate the assembly of PEDV full-length cDNA clone. Specifically, the fragments were assembled into the BAC plasmid step by step in an order of A-F-C-D-E-B by homologous recombination with the ClonExpress II One Step Cloning Kit (Vazyme). Each intermediate assembly was verified by DNA sequencing before proceeding to the next step, and the final plasmid was named pBAC-BJ2011C. The similar strategy was used to generate the full-length cDNA clone of CHM2013, namely the plasmid pBAC-CHM2013.

In this system, the PEDV genome is subject to the control of the CMV promoter so that the viral mRNA can be synthesized by the host RNA polymerase II upon transfection of BAC plasmids into Vero cells. In addition, HDVRz and BGH sequences were added to the 3\u2019 end of PEDV genome to aid the proper processing of a poly(A) tail [37, 42]. To facilitate amplification, the BJ2011C genome was divided into 6 segments (A, B, C, D, E and F) with the relative positions and the corresponding enzymes shown in Fig 2A. Of note, the 5\u2019 end sequence in fragment A was fused to the CMV promoter while the viral 3\u2019 end in fragment F was fused to the sequence containing PolyA (28 A), HdvRz and BGH polyadenylation signals. All DNA pieces were PCR amplified, ligated into pEasy-blunt vector, and then verified by DNA sequencing. A synonymous mutation (G15932A) was found in fragment D and retained as a genetic marker to distinguish from the parental virus. Meanwhile, to facilitate the construction, the BAC plasmid pBeloBAC11 was modified to create a shuttle plasmid pBAC-I that contains a set of multiple enzyme restriction sites as shown in Fig 2. Following that, each fragment was assembled into pBAC-I in an order of A-F-C-D-E-B by homologous recombination to generate the final plasmid pBAC-BJ2011C. Using the similar strategy, we engineered the BAC system for CHM2013 (Fig 2B) in which a synonymous mutation (T1809C) was introduced in segment A to serve as the genetic marker.",

As shown in Fig 3D, rCHM2013 and rBJ2011C exhibited growth kinetics similar to their respective parental viruses. However, at each time point, the titer of the recombinant virus was slightly lower than that of the parental virus. This is likely due to the fact that the parental viruses exist as quasi-species while the infectious clone-derived viruses represent relatively a homogeneous population. In addition, the results from the plaque assay showed that the rescued viruses had the similar size and plaque morphology to that of their respective parental virus (Fig 3E). On the other side, rBJ2011C generally made smaller plaques than that of rCHM2013, and this result is consistent with the observation that rBJ2011C had a slower growth kinetics as compared to rCHM2013.

Basically, different segments of intestine, including duodenum, ileum, jejunum, cecum, colon and rectum, were taken and individually processed for HE staining and for quantification of virus abundance. As shown in Fig 6A, infection by rBJ2011C caused extensive damages to all intestinal segments characterized by large amounts of fragmentation and shedding of intestinal villi. The epithelial layer of intestines was destroyed and lost the integrity; the most severe damages occurred in Jejunum. In contrast, the damages caused by rCHM2013 were mainly restricted to Jejunum and Ileum, which were quite minor as compared to the rBJ2011C group. Consistent with the histopathological analyses, the quantitative RT-PCR results showed that rBJ2011c infected all segments of intestine. The ileum apparently had the highest viral load; however, the virus abundance in the Jejunum was several logs lower. This was likely due to the severe damage of Jejunum epithelial layer as a result of virus infection. On the other hand, no viral RNA could be detected in the CHM2013 group.",

Selective pressures from vaccination and environmental changes have led to the emergence of novel virulent variants of this class of viruses, such as SARS-CoV and the highly pathogenic PEDV (HP-PEDV), which pose great threat to the health of both humans and animals [22, 29, 43]. The emergence of HP-PEDV was sudden and occurred around 2010 in China [22, 23], followed by the devastating PED outbreak on the North American continent three years later [26, 29]. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the earlier Asian isolates such as the Chinese AH2012 and Korean KNU-1305 share high nucleotide identity with the North American prototype strains and therefore are clustered within the GIIa group, suggesting a common evolutionary origin and a possible transmission route from Asia to North America [25, 26, 29, 44]. Interestingly, the PEDV strain BJ2011C in this study is not clustered in the same branch as the AH2012 but rather grouped to GIIb cluster (Fig 1). The S genes from both GIIa and GIIb groups contain the similar gene deletion and insertion pattern as reported before, suggesting that they are from a common ancestor. However, the differences between the two groups suggest that they separated at some time point to undergo independent evolution that led to accumulation of additional mutations. Although deletion and insertions are the characteristic features for GIIa and GIIb strains, whether they contribute to PEDV pathogenesis have remained unclear. In addition, some laboratory and field strains contain large deletions in S gene [32, 45, 46]. However, some study showed that the strain that contains the large deletion in S gene was mild to piglets, suggesting that the changes of S gene of PEDV might be closely tied to the variations of pathogenicity [32, 45, 46]. The exact causative relationship between S size variation and the pathogenicity is still waiting to be determined.",

            "text": "Reverse genetics provides a very powerful tool for studying viral pathogenesis and for developing new generation of vaccines for disease control. Due to the large size of coronaviruses and other hurdles, it has been challenging to establish such a system. For PEDV, several approaches have been tried with different degrees of success [33\u201336]. Li et al reported successful recovery of infectious viruses by targeted RNA recombination strategy [36]. In this approach, the purified viral RNA is cotransfected into selective mammalian cells with a RNA fragment generated by in vitro transcription carrying two arms homologous to the virus. The host recombination machinery then mediates the homology recombination between the viral genomic RNA and the RNA fragment to generate a chimeric virus [36]. In general, the recombination efficiency is very low, and this approach can also select for viral mutants. Another approach is the assembly of the full-length PEDV genome by in vitro ligation [33, 35]. Basically, the PEDV genome is divided into several fragments. These cDNA fragments are PCR amplified, purified and then ligated in vitro to assemble the full-length cDNA clone. In this system, a T7 promoter is usually placed ahead of the 5\u2019end of PEDV genome or a SP6 promoter is set at the 3\u2019end of the virus genome; the in vitro transcription with the corresponding commercial kits will lead to transcription of the full-length viral mRNA, which is then introduced into mammalian cells by transfection [47, 48]. Two groups of scientists have recently used this method to successfully produce infectious cDNA clones for the highly pathogenic PEDV strains (e.g., PC22A and AH2012/12) [33, 35]. It should be noted that, however, this method is quite labor extensive, time-consuming and relatively inefficient, although representing a step forward compared to targeted genetic recombination.",

            "text": "The third approach is the BAC-based DNA-launched system. This is the most commonly used method for viruses with large genomes such as herpesviruses [49]. That is, the virus genome is cloned into BAC and set under control of the CMV promoter. Upon transfection of the PEDV-containing BAC plasmid into eukaryotic cells, the viral mRNA will be synthesized by host RNA polymerase II. Certainly, the most challenging problem is the stability issue in E.coli of the BAC plasmid perhaps arising from the toxicity of the PEDV gene or gene products due to basal level of leaky expression [37, 42]. Nevertheless, Jengarn et al have recently managed to establish such a system for a cell adapted strain AVCT12 [34]. AVCT12 is a Thailand PEDV strain sharing high homology with CHM2013; they all have gene deletion at the end of S gene and the start ORF3 and this deletion leads to the inhibition of ORF3 expression. However, AVCT12 requires expression of APN in Vero E6 cells to make high yield [34]. In this study, in addition to a low pathogenic strain, we for the first time constructed the DNA-launched BAC system for the highly pathogenic PEDV strain. We used E.coli trans10 cells to improve the stability of the PEDV-containing BAC plasmids during propagation, and found that the BAC plasmids are very stable in these cells. In addition, VERO CCL81 cells were used for transfection and virus propagation. Different from AVCT12, CHM2013 was found to replicate well in both VERO-CCL81 and VERO-E6 cells without the need of supplementation of APN. BJ2011C is a high pathogenic strain and most closely related to the Chinese pandemic strain PEDV-CHZ. Through animal experiments, we confirmed the pathogenic nature of rBJ2011C. Thus, our studies not only fulfilled Koch\u2019s postulations, but also provide BJ2011C as a good model organism to study the pathogenic mechanisms of highly virulent PEDV. With the reverse genetics system at hand for both high and low virulent strains, this should aid the construction of chimeric viruses for dissecting viral virulence determinants and facilitate genetic engineering of better vaccines.",
