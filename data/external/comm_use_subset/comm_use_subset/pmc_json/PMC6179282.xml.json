GSTs belong to a supergene family of multifunctional enzymes and are grouped into different species-independent gene classes [3\u20135]. GSTs protect cellular macromolecules (proteins and nucleic acids) from various endogenous and exogenous electrophilic reactive compounds [6\u20138] and neutralize these toxic compounds by conjugating a thiol nucleophilic moiety from reduced glutathione (GSH, \u03b3-glutamyl-cysteinyl-glycine) with electrophilic centres of the xenobiotic compounds [4, 7, 9]. Moreover, GSTs also regulate signalling pathways via protein-protein interactions [1, 10, 11]. GSTs are further sub-grouped into a cytosolic family and membrane-bound microsomal family [12\u201314]. Cytosolic GSTs are soluble and stable and consist of homo- or heterodimers with two-fold axes [3, 4, 15]. Cytosolic GST subunits are approximately 22\u201328 kDa in size and are divided into sixteen classes based on amino acid sequence similarity, substrate specificity, inhibitor sensitivity, and immunological cross-reactivity. Eight (Alpha [\u03b1], Mu [\u03bc], Pi [\u03c0], Sigma [\u03c3], Theta [\u03b8], Omega [\u03a9], Kappa [\u03ba], and Zeta [\u03b6]) of these 16 classes are found in mammals [12, 16\u201318].",

The NTD (1\u201381 residues) adopts a thioredoxin fold (\u03b2\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1 motif), which is highly conserved through GST classes and contains a GSH-binding pocket. The CTD is larger (90\u2013217 residues) and consists of 5 \u03b1-helices [3, 20\u201322]. The GSH-binding site is located on at the NTD; however, residues at the CTD interact with various hydrophobic xenobiotic substrates. Structural folds of the CTD are more variable than those of the NTD, which presumably facilitate specificity and binding of various structurally diverse xenobiotic compounds [3, 23].",

Before the measurements, CdGSTM1 was incubated overnight at different pH values ranging from 1.0\u201310.0. Intrinsic fluorescence measurements provided clear information regarding protein tertiary structural change. The primary intrinsic fluorophores in proteins are tryptophan (Trp), tyrosine, and phenylalanine. Total fluorescence spectra of CdGSTM1 at different pHs are shown in Fig 4. From the figure, it was recorded that the CdGSTM1 at pH 7.0 showed maximum fluorescence intensity at 336 nm, confirming that CdGSTM1 exists in a well-folded form. The fluorescence emission maximum of CdGSTM1 remained unchanged in the range of 5.0\u20139.0 pH, indicating that the tertiary structure of CdGSTM1 was intact (Fig 4, inset). However, between pH 3.0 and 5.0, the wavelength maximum of CdGSTM1 was 6.0 nm (red shifted). The red shift in the wavelength maximum signified that the tryptophan residues were exposed to the polar environment, thus indicating changes in protein tertiary structure. Moreover, the maximum wavelength remained unchanged below pH 3.0, indicating that the same microenvironment around tryptophan residues was retained. Fluorescence intensity of CdGSTM1 increased gradually with a reduction in pH because the position of certain amino acid residues changed apart from the Trp residues, which were responsible for quenching of Trp fluorescence. Such pH-dependent changes were also reported previously [42]. The shift in maximum wavelength suggests that dimeric CdGSTM1 either begins monomerising below pH 5.0 or undergoes a loss of tertiary structure interactions, which were further characterized by other advance techniques.",

As shown in Fig 8A, CdGSTM1 at pH 2.0 (lane 2) showed a predominant band at the monomeric size of CdGSTM1 (dissociated state). CdGSTM1 at pH 4.0 (lane 3) exists as a dimer and dissociated form, which cross-links with high-molecular-weight aggregates (which remained at the top of the gel). At pH 7.0 (lane 4), a prominent band corresponding to the dimeric form of CdGSTM1 was observed.",

Although 150 mM NaCl was added in the gel filtration buffer to suppress protein-matrix interactions, CdGSTM1at pH 2.0 was retained in the column and eluted near the column bed volume. Similarly, CdGSTM1 at pH 4.0, where it exits in a monomer-dimer equilibrium, eluted at two peaks. The dimer eluted at the expected peak (16.3 mL), followed by the monomeric form after crossing the bed volume owing to retention in the matrix. All elution peaks obtained at pH 2.0, 4.0, and 7.0 were separately subjected to glutaraldehyde cross-linkage (Fig 8B). The first peak at pH 2.0 displayed cross-linkage in the monomeric form (lane 1) and the second peak was very small and showed a faint band corresponding to the monomeric size of CdGSTM1 (lane 2). At pH 4.0, CdGSTM1 was eluted into very small peaks, which yielded very faint bands on SDS-PAGE (lane 3 and 4). CdGSTM1 at pH 7.0 eluted at the dimeric size and the cross-linked form revealed the predominant dimeric state (lane 5).

The exposure of Trp amino acid residues to polar solvents was identified via uncharged acrylamide quenching measurements. The present results provide a detailed insight into conformational changes in CdGSTM1 protein at different pH conditions. Fig 9 depicts the Stern-Volmer plot for CdGSTM1 protein at different pH values. The Stern-Volmer quenching constant (Ksv) values are shown in Table 1. As shown in Fig 9 and Table 1, the Ksv values in the native state at an acidic pH and in the presence of 6M GdnHCl are as follows: 5.68 (pH 7.4), 5.93 (pH 2.0), and 6.16 M (6M GdnHCl). The Ksv values of CdGSTM1 at pH 7.4 were markedly low because of complete folding of CdGSTM1 and the Ksv values at 6M GdnHCl denaturation of CdGSTM1 were the highest because of higher exposure of Trp residues owing to complete unfolding of the CdGSTM1 protein. However, Trp residues were also exposed at pH 2.0, but to a lesser extent than in 6M GdnHCl-treated samples. Hence, CdGSTM1 exists in a well-folded form at a native pH, slightly unfolded at low pH, and completely unfolded in the presence of 6M GdnHCl. The slight exposure of Trp residues at pH 2.0 suggests that either CdGSTM1 is partially unfolded or the subunit dissociation.",

The emission ratio of 350 nm to 330 nm was plotted with respect to temperature at the different pH values (Fig 10).

Therefore, the dimeric form (pH 7.0) and monomeric form (pH 2.0) of CdGSTM1 were subjected to dynamic multimode spectroscopy (DMS) to evaluate structural and thermodynamic properties in both states. The samples at pH 7.0 were constantly heated (1\u00b0C min-1) from 20\u201375\u00b0C, while the sample at pH 2.0 was heated up to 94\u00b0C under identical conditions. Far-UV CD spectra of both samples were recorded between 200 and 260 nm as a function of temperature. Selected wavelengths are shown in Fig 11. Dimeric CdGSTM1 (pH 7.0) and monomeric CdHSTM1 (pH 2.0) unfold via a single transition. At pH 7.0, they undergo sharp thermal transitions and secondary structure is completely lost at 57\u00b0C, while CdGSTM1 at pH 2.0 follows shallow thermal transition and retains nearly half of the secondary structure up to 94\u00b0C. The thermal melting points (Tm) and van't Hoff enthalpy of CdGSTM1 at both pHs were determined via Global 3 analysis software, Applied Photophysics Ltd, UK. The Tm of dimeric CdGSTM1 at pH 7.0 was 51.5 \u00b1 0.1\u00b0C and van't Hoff enthalpy was 666.4 \u00b1 9.8 kJ mol-1. The Tm of monomeric CdGSTM1 was higher 54.2 \u00b1 0.1\u00b0C; however, the van't Hoff enthalpy was quite low (116.5 \u00b1 0.8 kJ mol-1). The thermal shift assay also yielded a single thermal transition with Tm values of 49.0 and 54.8\u00b0C at pH 7.0 and 2.0, respectively (Fig 10).",

Between pH 3.0 and 5.0 CdGSTM1 undergoes a conformational change, resulting in nearly complete loss of enzyme activity. The crystal structure of Mu-class GST revealed that Tyr7 (catalytic residue) located at the NTD of one subunit interacts with the Phe57 located at the interface loop of the second subunit [20].

It has been extensively used as a spectral probe to investigate protein tertiary structure [55]. Generally, interior tryptophan residues in folded proteins displayed fluorescence emission maximum below 340 nm, whereas upon protein unfolding, the fluorescence emission maximum red-shifted to 350\u2013355 nm. CdGSTM1 contains four tryptophan residues. A 3D model of CdGSTM1 revealed that two of these (Trp8 and Trp46) are located proximal to the dimer interface (data not shown). The emission maximum of CdGSTM1 at neutral pH was observed at 336 nm (Fig 4), suggesting that the tryptophan residues in the native conformation are significantly buried in the protein core. The tryptophan emission maxima were mostly unchanged from pH 5.0 to 10.0, suggesting that the tertiary structure of the protein was stable in this pH range (Fig 4). However, a sharp red-shift (6 nm) in the intrinsic emission maxima was observed between pH 3.0 and 5.0, with no further change in emission maxima below pH 3.0 (Fig 4). The red-shift in emission maxima resulted from changes in the tryptophan microenvironment from a non-polar to a polar environment during protein denaturation or dissociation of subunits of multimeric proteins or both [55]. A minor shift in emission maxima (from 336 to 342 nm) of CdGSTM1 below pH 5.0 indicated a marginal change around the tryptophan residues in CdGSTM1 at low pH. On treatment with a chemical denaturant (6 M GdnHCl), CdGSTM1 undergoes complete unfolding with an emission maxima of 360 nm (data not shown).",

These data suggest the dissociation or denaturation, or both, of dimeric CdGSTM1 below pH 5.0. An extrinsic fluorescence dye (ANS) does not fluoresce in an aqueous buffer but fluoresces when exposed to a hydrophobic environment. ANS does not bind or exhibit very low binding with the native and completely unfolded polypeptide chain; however, it binds with protein folding intermediates formed during unfolding [56]. ANS emission spectra, used to measure surface hydrophobicity, showed a blue-shift and a two-fold increase in fluorescence intensity between pH 3.0 and 5.0. Previously, ANS was found to bind the dimer interface, thereby decreasing the emission maximum from 535 nm to 490\u2013500 nm, accompanied by an enhanced fluorescence signal [29, 30, 57]. The blue-shift in the ANS spectra revealed that the environment of the ANS-binding site is hydrophobic. RLS is routinely used to detect the quantity of aggregates in a solution [58, 59]. An increase in surface hydrophobicity did not affect the solubility of CdGSTM1 at low pH.",

The phenyl ring of Phe57 protrudes from the NTD of one subunit into a hydrophobic pocket generated within the C-terminal domain of the other subunit formed by alpha-helix 4 and 5 [36]. A mixed charge cluster (six positively and six negatively charged residues) in a 24-residue-long stretch (Arg78 to Glu101) located close to the dimer interface (data not shown) forms ionic interactions between subunits.

Thermal melting curves based on changes in the tertiary structure of CdGSTM1 revealed that it follows two-state thermal unfolding at pH 1.0 to 10.0. The protein was moderately thermostable, and its thermostability increased significantly below pH 3.0. Thermal stability based on secondary structure (far-UV CD) also had similar Tm values and temperature-induced unfolding pathways of dimeric and monomeric CdGSTM1 compared to those obtained with the thermal shift assay [62]. The present results show that dimeric CdGSTM1 undergoes a sharp thermal transition with a large change in van't Hoff enthalpy (666.4 \u00b1 9.8 kJ mol-1), while the monomeric form undergoes broad range of thermal transitions (approximately 40\u00b0C) with lower van't Hoff enthalpy 116.5 \u00b1 0.8 kJ mol-1. Dimeric CdGSTM1 attains cross-beta sheeted structures during thermal unfolding, which undergoes irreversible thermal aggregation. However, alpha helices in monomeric CdGSTM1 were gradually converted to random-coil-like structures during thermal unfolding, which was completely reversible.

            "text": "Understanding protein stability is necessary to gain insights into protein folding, structure, and function. Proteins that are marginally stabilized exceed a minimal threshold to attain a native conformation and function [63, 64]. Generally, thermodynamic stabilities of most water-soluble globular proteins varies from 12 and 42 kJ/mol [64]. The protein is stabilized via a delicate balance between certain forces and interactions. Hydrophobic forces and electrostatic interactions are major factors determining protein stability. To balance optimum biological function and conformational stability, electrostatic interactions are optimised in proteins [65]. Analysis of pH-dependent protein stability helps understand electrostatic interactions in proteins and the contribution of specific charged residues in protein structure and function. The thermodynamic stability of proteins in the native and denatured state are linked to pKa groups of the side chains, which is pH-dependent. The pKa values of the residues in the native and unfolded states depend on several factors: charge-charge, H-bonds, charge-dipole, and desolvation effects. The degree of interactions between charged resides and the rest of the protein in the native or denatured forms determines the titration properties of the ionisable groups. Generally, proteins lose structure-function and stability below pH 5.0 and above pH 10.0 owing to ionization of buried ionisable residues (e.g., Tyr, His) in the folded native state. In the strong acidic or alkaline region, ionisable residues from the surface to the core of the proteins gradually get ionized and lead to protein unfolding. The relatively higher stability of monomeric CdGSTM1 compared to that of dimeric CdGSTM may have resulted from higher intra-chain interactions within the monomer. The overall data is schematically presented in Fig 14. Briefly, CdGSTM1 exists in dimeric state at pH 7.0 while it equilibrated in dimer-monomer form at pH 4.0. At acidic pH of 2.0, it is populated in monomeric form. The dimeric form was having relatively less thermal stability than the monomeric form.",
