While it has been well documented that PrPSc is derived from a PK-sensitive cellular PrPC in the central nervous system through an alpha-helix to beta-sheet structural transition, the specific molecular mechanism(s) behind the PrP conversion remain poorly understood [2]. Several plausible theories have emerged, including the prevailing seeding model [3], which explains this conversion with the use of PrPSc seeds that are introduced either by exogenous infection in diseases such as kuru, iatrogenic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and variant CJD, or formed by endogenous PrPSc molecules including sporadic CJD and various familial prion diseases. However, the exact molecular nature of the endogenous PrPSc has not been elucidated.",

            "text": "In 2006, we first identified small amounts of PK-resistant PrP aggregates in uninfected brains of humans, cattle and hamsters [4]. Since then, subsequent studies have revealed similar insoluble structures in a wide range of organisms, from cattle and sheep to humans [5] and cultured neuroblastoma cells expressing wild-type or mutant human PrP [6]. All these studies provide experimental evidence that prion-like forms are present at a low level in the normal brain. Such isoforms could be either the silent prions or prion precursors proposed previously [3, 7] or the recognized PrP species implicated in long-term memory in healthy humans [8]. Neuroblastoma cell expressing various human PrP mutants are an essential tool in the study of mutant prions linked to naturally occurring familial prion diseases [9-11, 6]. Previously, using two models expressing either the mutations at residue 183 from Thr to Ala (PrPT183A) or at residue 198 from Phe to Ser (PrPF198S), we discovered a PK-resistant PrP (PrPres) species that exhibited higher affinity for anti-PrP monoclonal antibody 1E4, with an epitope between residues 97 and 105 [6], compared to anti-PrP antibody 3F4, an antibody widely-used in the detection of human prions with an epitope between residues 106 and 112 [12]. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the immunoreactivity behavior and gel mobility of this PrPres is virtually identical to those of PrP*20 that we observed previously in uninfected brain [4, 6], validating the cell model for the investigation of the spontaneously formed iPrPC.",

            "text": "In this study, using cells expressing PrPWt, PrPT183A and PrPF198S, we made the following observations. First, these PrP mutations increased aggregation of the protein, of which PrPT183A that has been reported to accumulate intracellularly [10] exhibited the highest amount of iPrP. Second, immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that 1E4 had lower affinity for PrP in cultured cells than 3F4, as on immunoblots. Third, glycans at the second site (N197) are basic, whereas glycans at the first site (N181) are acidic. Fourth, the T183A mutation not only abolished glycosylation at N181, but also altered glycosylation at N197. In addition to the immaturity of the glycan at N197 reported previously [10], the composition of N197 may be also changed, as evidenced by the faster migration of N197 on PK-resistant PrPT183A compared to that of N181 on the PK-resistant PrPF198S or PrPSc from sCJD. Fifth, the F198S mutation also altered glycosylation at both the first and second sites. The glycosylation on the diglycosylated PrPF198S seemed to be more mature than that on the monoglycosylated protein. Using monoclonal antibodies V14 and V61 that differentiate the two monoglycosylated PrP (Moudjou et al., 2004), we observed that the mutation blocked the V14 epitope, which was mimicked by reduction and alkylation, a reaction that often breaks disulfide bond and prevents re-oxidation of the thiol group [13]. Although V61 detected unglycosylated PrP and PrP monoglycosylated at N197 (mono197) in the brain PrP, it failed to detect the glycosylated and de- or un-glycosylated PrP from cultured neuronal cells. Finally, electron microscopy revealed that while cells expressing PrPF198S enhanced autophagy, PrPT183A seemed to completely inhibit autophagy compared to wild-type cells. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of iPrPC and abnormal folding of mutant proteins.",

Although the molecular weight of PrPF198S decreased more than that of PrPT183A compared to wild type controls, the small degree of change in the molecular weight might not be detectable by Western blotting. In addition, all three PrP molecules exhibited the same molecular charge with a theoretical isoelectric point (pI) of 9.39.",

The NetNGlyc server provides a glycosylation potential value between 0 and 1 for each N-linked glycosylation site. A potential value greater than 0.5 indicates that glycosylation is probable at the site. Using this algorithm, the glycosylation potential values of N181 and N197 in PrPWt were determined to be 0.6636 and 0.7197, respectively. Notably, the potential value was greater at the second site than at the first site in all three species tested (PrPWt, PrPT183A and PrPF198S). Glycosylation at only N197, but not N181, was predicted in the PrPT183A mutation (0.7196, almost identical to that of PrPWt), while the first and second glycosylation sites were predicted for PrPF198S (0.6633 and 0.6988, respectively). Interestingly though, the potential value at the second site was decreased for PrPF198S compared to that in PrPWt (0.6988 vs. 0.7197), suggesting that the F198S mutation mainly affects glycosylation at N197. The expectation would be that the mutation from Phe to Ser at 198 would increase glycosylation [14].",

            "text": "As reported previously [10, 11, 6], PrPT183A and PrPF198S have altered gel profiles, largely because of the effect of the mutations on glycosylation. Probed with the 3F4 antibody directed against PrP106-110 [12], PrPWt migrated as three major bands of one di-glycosylated (~36-48 kDa), two mono-glycosylated (~34-36 kDa and ~32-33 kDa, respectively), and one un-glycosylated (27-28 kDa) forms (Fig. 1A, upper panel). In contrast, a single band migrating at 28-36 kDa, corresponding to the monoglycosylated PrP, was detectable in cell lysates from PrPT183A expressing cells (Fig. 1A, upper panel). Bands migrating at 37-45 kDa and 33-36 kDa corresponding to the di- and mono-glycosylated forms, respectively, were detected in cell lysates from PrPF198S expressing cells; the unglycosylated form was undetectable. From these data, we can conclude that PrPT183A mainly contains monoglycosylated PrP at the second site (mono197), whereas PrPF198S contains one di- and two separate mono-glycosylated PrP occupied at the first (mono181) or mono197. After treatment with PK at 25 \u03bcg/ml, no PrP was detected except from PrPT183A expressing cells, in which a weak band with no change in migration remained when probed with 3F4. This band was un-digested PrPT183A.",

One theory for this unique behavior of the 1E4 antibody is that the 1E4 epitope is blocked in full-length PrP, even when subjected to denaturing conditions prior to Western blotting, and becomes exposed only when truncated by PK with the removal of approximately 60-70 amino acids from the N-terminus [6].",

In the T183A samples, 1E4 revealed an intense band migrating at 23-25 kDa corresponding to the PK-resistant monoglycosylated species (Fig. 1A, lower panel). PrPF198S had two PK-resistant bands: a ~32-39 kDa band corresponding to di-glycosylated PrP and a ~26-29 kDa band corresponding to monoglycosylated PrP (Fig. 1A, lower panel). Interestingly, the mobility of di- but not mono-glycosylated PrPF198S was slightly slower than that of PK-resistant PrPSc from sCJD (Fig. 1A, lower panel) while the mobility of the monoglycosylated PrPT183A (second site) was faster not only than that of the monoglycosylated form of PrPF198S from cell lysates, but also than that of PrPres from the CJD brain control. Because the monoglycosylated PrPT183A carries glycans at the second glycosylation site at residue 197, the monoglycosylated form of PrPres from CJD brains and of PrPF198S from cultured cells with slower migration may represent glycans at the first glycosylation site, residue 181. Another possibility is that the glycans at the N197 site are modified differently and consequently migrate slower than glycans from PrPT183A.",

In addition, as demonstrated previously, PrPT183A is most likely located intracellularly, while wild type and PrPF198S are present on the cell surface [10]. 3F4 immunostaining was reduced to almost insignificant levels when wild type cells were treated with PK (Fig. 1B), consistent with Western blotting results.

An increase in the formation of PK-resistant PrP species in cells expressing mutant PrP might be associated with an increase in the aggregation of the protein. The distribution of PrP in 11 sucrose step gradients fractions collected after ultracentrifugation was determined by Western blotting probed with the 3F4 antibody. As expected, most PrPWt was recovered in the top fractions, i.e. fractions 1-2, whereas a small amount of PrP was observed in fraction 10. In contrast, significant amounts of PrPT183A were recovered in the bottom fractions, whereas no PrPT183A was detected in fraction 1. Only a very small amount of PrP was observed in fraction 2 (Fig. 2A, middle panel).

The T183A mutant blots probed with 3F4 showed PK-resistant prion protein migrating at 23-26 kDa with isoelectric points (pI) from pH 8.0 to 9.5.

The F198S mutant protein migrated at ~36-38 kDa with pI from pH 4.5 to 5.5. Based on their molecular weights, these spots represent di-glycosylated PrP species (Fig. 3B). However, spots detected using the 1E4 antibody were more intense and had noticeable differences on both blots. PrPT183A spots detected by 1E4 migrating at ~22-27 kDa corresponding to mono197 were mainly detected in a range from pH 7.5 to 10.0 with faint spots also detectable at pH 4 (Fig. 3C).

The faint wild type spots migrating at ~19-20 kDa with pH 7.5-8.5 (Fig. 3H) while more intense PK-resistant PrPT183A and PrPF198S spots were detected with similar gel mobility migrating at ~19-20 kDa and pH 7-9.5 (Fig. 3I and 3J). Furthermore, these 2-D analyses of glycosylated and deglycosylated PK-resistant mutant iPrP indicated that glycans at the second site are more basic, whereas glycans at the first site are more acidic. 2-D blots, similar to the 1-D immunoblotting, also demonstrated that 1E4 has higher affinity for PK-resistant iPrP compared to 3F4. As indicated above, the effect of the two mutations by themselves on the charge of the proteins was not predicted. Two possibilities that may explain the slight differences in the pH of intense spots after deglycosylation: the three types of proteins have either distinct N-terminal protease cleavage sites or distinct GPI anchors.",

This observation may be due to two possibilities: First, there may be abnormal glycosylation at N197 on PrPT183A, even though this mutation directly eliminates N181. Second, the molecular weight the glycans is greater in mono181 than in mono197. However, this hypothesis is inconsistent with a previous report [16]. In the previous study, two monoclonal antibodies termed V14 and V61 were generated using recombinant sheep PrP as an immunogen to produce glycan-controlled epitopes on the PrP molecule, which discriminate between the two monoglycosylated species [16, 17]. Notably, the epitopes recognized by the two antibodies were identified in 2.5-\u00c5-resolution crystal structures of the PrP-antibody complex; the epitopes could not be mapped using conventional peptide scanning [16, 18, 17]. It was observed that the V14 epitope is localized between sheep PrP188 and 199 corresponding to human PrP185-196, whereas the V61 epitope has not been determined precisely yet. The V61 epitope was deduced to locate in the region before amino acid 171 to the first glycosylation site [16, 17]. Interestingly, although both antibodies recognize unglycosylated PrP, V14 binds to PrP with the first Asn glycosylation site occupied (corresponding to human mono181) and V61 binds to PrP carrying the second glycosylation site (corresponding to human mono197) from sheep, humans, hamsters, and mice. It was also reported that the glycan chain was smaller at the first glycosylation site than at the second site [16].",

Without PK or PNGase F treatment, five major PrP bands were detected by V14 (Fig. 4A). Based on the molecular weight, the top band migrating at ~33-35 kDa represents the monoglycosylated PrP species. Since V14 detects PrP species monoglycosylated at N181, this band is mono181. The second band migrating at ~29-32 kDa corresponds to the unglycosylated full-length PrP. The third band migrating at ~ 23-25 is the monoglycosylated C1 fragment with the first site occupied (mono181- C1). The fourth band migrating at 19-20 kDa is the unglycosylated C2 fragment, an endogenously N-terminally truncated PrP fragment detected in CJD brains [19]. Finally, the fifth band migrating at ~18 kDa is unglycosylated C1 that is N-terminally truncated in normal brains [19]. After PK-treatment, only three major bands are detectable with V14. The top band migrating at ~26-28 is PK-resistant PrP monoglycosylated at the first site (mono181 +PK). The second band migrating at ~19 kDa is PK-resistant unglycosylated PrP (Un + PK). The third faint band was detected at ~18.5 kDa. In the samples treated with both PK and PNGase F, only two bands were detectable: the dominant band migrated at ~19-20 kDa, while the other migrated at ~18.5 kDa. Compared to the samples treated with PK, but without PNGase F, the band migrating at ~18.5 kDa significantly increased, suggesting that this new fragment contains both glycosylated and unglycosylated forms. Moreover, since it was not detected in the untreated samples, this new fragment could be generated by PK digestion in vitro (Fig. 4A, left panel).",

The intensity of PrP bands in the untreated PrP detected with V61 was weak and four bands could be identified. The top double bands migrating at 34-36 kDa corresponds to the PrP species monoglycosylated at the second glycosylation site (mono197 -PK). The band migrating at ~29-31 kDa corresponds to the unglycosylated full-length PrP. The band migrating at ~27-28 kDa represents C1 monoglycosylated at the second site (mono197-C1). After treatment with PK, two bands became detectable migrating at ~29-30 kDa and 19-20 kDa, respectively. Since V61 detected the monoglycosylated species occupied at residue 197, they represent the PK-resistant PrP species monoglycosylated at the second site (mono197 +PK) and PK-resistant deglycosylated and unglycosylated forms (Un +PK). Consistent with the observation by Moudjou et al., the migration of the PrP mono197 detected with V61 was slower than that of PrP mono181 detected with V14 (Fig. 4A). Therefore, using the two antibodies, we observed that the human PK-resistant PrP species monoglycosylated at the second site (mono197) has a higher molecular weight than that monoglycosylated at the first site (mono181). In addition, both antibodies were unable to detect di-glycosylated human PrP, consistent with the previous observation by Moudjou et al. [16].",

They correspond to mono181, unglycosylated PrP, mono181-C1, and unglycosylated C1. Compared to PrPSc from sCJD in Fig. 4A, C2 was dramatically decreased in uninfected cell lysates. After treatment with PNGase F, only two bands were detected, corresponding to deglycosylated full-length at ~29-32 kDa and N-terminally truncated C1 at 18 kDa. V14 mainly detected the unglycosylated PrPT183A migrating at ~29-32 kDa. Faint bands were also detected migrating at ~19 kDa and 18 kDa corresponding to C2 and C1, respectively (Fig. 4B, left panel). After deglycosylation with PNGase F, two bands corresponding to deglycosylated and unglycosylated full-length and N-terminally truncated PrP molecules were detected by V14. In contrast, no bands were detected by V14 in treated and untreated cell lysates containing PrPF198S. Surprisingly, no PrP bands were detected by V61 in all three cell lysates untreated and treated with PNGase F (Fig. 4B, right panel). Using the two antibodies we were unable to address issues why the migration of the mono197 from PrPT183A is faster than that of PrPF198S because of inability of V14 to detect PrPF198S and because of inability of V61 to detect both wild-type and mutant PrP from cultured cell lysates. Nevertheless, our current study revealed that V14 identified a C1 monoglycosylated at the second glycosylation site (mono197-C1). Moreover, our new results for the first time indicated that F198S mutation blocked the binding of V14 to PrP and the V61 epitope was completely blocked in both wild-type and mutant PrP from cultured cells.",

The naturally occurring mutations at residue 183, Thr to Ala (PrPT183A), or at residue 198, Phe to Ser (PrPF198S), falling in the two consensus sites are linked to two distinct familial prion diseases [22, 23]. Elimination of each of the two sites or two sites together by mutagenesis of hamster PrP in CV1 cells induced the intracellular accumulation of mutant proteins [24]. Lehman and Harris observed that mouse PrP mutated at T182 alone or at both T182 and T198 in CHO cells failed to reach the cell surface but those mutated at T198 did. Moreover, all three mutant PrP acquired PrPSc-like physicochemical properties reminiscent of PrPSc while to a limited extent PrPWt did so only when synthesized in the presence of inhibitor tunicamycin [25]. Using M17 cells expressing human PrPN181G or PrPT183A, Capellari et al. observed that PrPN181G, but not PrPT183A, reached the cell surface even though both mutations eliminated glycosylation at the first site [10]. This indicates that the Thr to Ala mutation itself, not the elimination of the first glycosylation site, altered the physical properties of the mutant protein [10]. Although the F198S mutation falls within the second glycosylation site, Asn-Phe-Thr residues 197-199, PrPF198S slightly increased the efficiency of glycosylation at the first glycosylation site (N181), and greatly increased the efficiency of glycosylation at the second site (N197) in cultured cells [11].",

Most of PrPT183A was in oligomers and large aggregates; virtually no monomeric form was present. In PrPF198S, however, monomeric species were still dominant despite an increase in the amount of aggregates, since the majority of PrPF198S was recovered in the top fractions of sucrose step gradients. The enhanced tendency of PrPT183A to form aggregates may result from the intracellular accumulation of the mutant protein. The F198S mutation did not change the ability of PrPF198S to reach the cell surface [11], although the mutation may significantly change the structure around the V14 epitope previously found to be localized between human PrP185-196 [16, 17]. Therefore, the majority of the iPrPC associated with the T183A mutation may be the result of its PrP intracellular accumulation, raising the possibility that iPrPC is derived predominantly from intracellular PrP species. Immunofluorescence microscopy of tagged PrP also indicated that PrPT183A accumulates within the cell, whereas PrPF198S was distributed both inside the cell and on the cell surface, consistent with previous observations [10, 11].",

As anticipated by the N-linked glycosylation prediction algorithm NetNGlyc 1.0 and confirmed by Western blot analysis, PrPT183A completely abolishes glycosylation at N181. However, PrPT183A also exhibited altered glycosylation at N197. On 1-D blots, the migration of the PK-resistant mono197 from PrPT183A was faster than that of PrPF198S and of the dominant monoglycosylated PrPSc from sCJD, suggesting that the apparent molecular weight of glycans at mono197 is smaller than that of glycans at mono181. However, using two monoclonal antibodies V14 and V61, we demonstrated that the apparent molecular weight of PK-resistant mono197 of PrPSc from sCJD is greater than that of mono181 of PrPSc, consistent with the previous finding in scrapie PrPSc [16]. Thus, the combination of these results provides further evidence to suggest the altered composition of glycans at N197 of PrPT183A. Furthermore, our 2-D analyses revealed that pIs of PK-resistant PrPT183A are basic, while the PK-resistant diglycosylated PrPF198S are acidic. Using Endo H, we confirmed that a large amount of glycans from PrPT183A is immature, as originally reported by Capellari et al. [10], and our findings support the hypothesis that while only some PrPT183A contains modified glycans (the ~50% Endo H resistant molecules), all of the PrPT183A fails to reach the cell surface. The present study demonstrated that the glycans at either the first or second site were virtually completely digested by Endo H from monoglycosylated PrPF198S. Interestingly, the glycans of di-glycosylated PrPF198S were not significantly digested, suggesting that di-glycosylated PrPF198S are more mature than monoglycosylated forms.",

Glycosylation at each of the two N-linked consensus sites of mouse ME7 strain was directly compared by mass spectrometry and differences in N-glycan populations between the two sites were observed [26]. Notably, although both sites contained major neutral components, many other minor neutral components were only observed at the first but not the second site. The majority of glycans at the first site were bi- and tri-antennary structures with a mass range of approximately 1.66-2.34 kDa, whereas the second site mainly contained tri- and tetra-antennary structures with a mass range of ~2.0-3.02 kDa [26]. Therefore, the molecular mass of glycans was greater in the second site than in the first site, having a difference ranging from 0.34-0.68 kDa. The range of oligosaccharides in PrPC and PK-resistant PrP27-30 was found to be identical while the relative proportions of some glycans were different in the two species [27]. Compared to PrPC, PrP27-30 had a reduced bisected and an increased tri- and tetra-antennary glycans [27]. Nevertheless, to date no mass spectrometry analysis of the glycans on the human PrPSc or the PK-resistant human PrP has been reported, and the glycans on the two monoglycosylated species are not readily differentiated by Western blotting using regular anti-PrP antibodies such as 3F4.",

            "text": "V14 and V61 are well-characterized antibodies that were generated with the recombinant sheep PrP as the immunogen but are able to discriminate the two PrP species monoglycosylated either at the first or second glycosylation site of sheep, human, hamster and mouse [16]. In addition to recognizing the unglycosylated PrP, V14 also recognizes the PrP species monoglycosylated at the first site, while V61 recognizes the PrP species monoglycosylated at the second site. Using these two antibodies, it was confirmed that the molecular mass of glycans is greater at the second than the first site [16]. Although V14 also detected the di-glycosylated sheep PrPC but it did not detect the di-glycosylated sheep PrPSc. Our data indicated that the molecular mass of glycans is greater at the second than the first site on the human PK-resistant PrPSc from sCJD, similar to that observed in scrapie PrPSc [16]. However, the molecular mass of glycans at the second site of PrPT183A seemed to be smaller than that of glycans on the second site of PrPF198S or brain PrPSc of sCJD. This provides further evidence that the T183A mutation perturbs the glycosylation at the second site. Furthermore, our present study demonstrated that the PrPF198S species monoglycosylated at the first and second sites were undetectable after the Endo H treatment. Therefore, the F198S mutation similarly alters glycosylation not only at the second, but also the first site. However, the glycans on the di-glycosylated PrPF198S were not cleaved by Endo H, indicating that glycans on the di-glycosylated PrP are mature. Although the epitopes of V14, localized at sheep PrP188-199 corresponding to human PrP185-196, and V61, localized at sheep PrP169-174 corresponding to human PrP166-171, were mapped by studying the 2.5-\u00c5 resolution PrP-Fab crystal complex, the conventional peptide scanning failed to localize them on the PrP sequence [16, 18, 17]. As a result, the epitopes have been believed to be conformation-dependent [16], which is in agreement with our results reported here. We have demonstrated previously that reduction and alkylation blocks the accessibility of the 6H4 epitope but not epitopes of 3F4 and anti-C by breaking the disulfide bond of PrP [13]. In the current study, data revealed that the reduction of PrP by TBP decreased the accessibility of the V14 epitope and a combination of reduction and alkylation completely blocked its accessibility, providing further evidence that the accessibility of the V14 epitope depends on an intact disulfide bond on the C-terminal PrP. The V14 epitope was blocked by the F198S mutation as well, suggesting that the F198S mutation may also rupture the disulfide bond. These results parallel discoveries with other conformational sensitive anti-PrP antibodies, including 8H4, which was also reported to have the lower affinity for PrPF198S than for PrPWt [11]. Unexpectedly, V61 detected no glycosylated and unglycosylated PrP species from all three types of cultured cells even though it detected brain PrPC and PrPSc. Why the V61 epitope becomes inaccessible in all wild-type and mutant PrP species remains to be determined. Since the amount of PrPWt used seemed to be large, indicated by V14 (Fig. 4B), it is most unlikely that inability of V61 to detect PrP from cultured cells mainly resulted from its lower affinity for PrP.",

            "text": "Autophagy degrades organelles and unfolded proteins through the lysosomal pathway and has been considered a key adaptive response that can prevent death in stressed or diseased cells [28]. This natural process normally occurs at a basal level in cells and it can be induced by a variety of conditions [29]. Using electron microscopy, we observed that autophagy was slightly increased in cells expressing PrPF198S compared to cells expressing PrPWt. Surprisingly, autophagy was dramatically decreased in cells expressing human PrPT183A, which further highlights a possible paradoxical relationship between autophagy and aggregation, since the largest amounts of PrP aggregates were also observed in cells expressing the T183A mutant. It is worth noting that cytosolic PrP aggregates were recently observed to activate reticulon 3 (RTN3), which inhibited autophagy and impeded the clearance of cytosolic PrP aggregates in vitro [30]. Furthermore, it was revealed that RTN3 activation was mediated by the enhanced interaction between Bcl-2 and beclin 1 [30]. Since autophagy is believed to play either a pro-survival or a pro-death role, determining the molecular mechanisms underlying the differences in the induction of autophagy using our cell models would present an important avenue for developing therapeutic strategies for protein folding disorders.",

The g5p-conjugated beads were incubated with 0.1 % BSA in PBS to block non-specific binding. The prepared g5p beads were stable for at least 3 months at 4\u00b0C. The specific capture of PrPSc by g5p was performed as described [36, 4] by incubating S1 fractions and g5p conjugated beads (10 \u03bcg g5p/6 x 107 beads) in 1 ml of binding buffer (3% Tween-20, 3% NP-40 in PBS, pH 7.5). After incubation with constant rotation overnight at room temperature, the PrP-containing g5p beads were collected with an external magnetic force and all unbound molecules in the solution were removed. Following three rinses in the wash buffer (2% Tween-20 and 2% Nonidet P-40 in PBS, pH 7.5), the g5p beads were resuspended in SDS sample buffer (3% SDS, 2 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 50 mM Tris, pH 6.8) and heated at 95\u00b0C for 5 min to release bound proteins.",
