However, GBS possesses a variety of virulence factors and can cause severe disease when transmitted to susceptible hosts such as the newborn. Despite widespread intrapartum antibiotic administration to colonized mothers, GBS remains a leading cause of pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis in neonates [1, 2]. Bacterial meningitis is a life-threatening infection of the central nervous system (CNS) and is marked by transit of the bacterium across endothelial barriers, such as the blood-brain barrier (BBB) or the meningeal blood-cerebral spinal fluid barrier (mBCSFB). Both consist of a single layer of specialized endothelial cells that serve to maintain brain homeostasis and generally prevent pathogen entry into the CNS [3\u20135]. Symptoms of bacterial meningitis may be due to the combined effect of bacterial adherence and brain penetration, direct cellular injury caused by bacterial cytotoxins, and/or activation of host inflammatory pathways that can disrupt brain barrier integrity and damage underlying nervous tissue.

In order to disseminate from the blood into the brain, GBS must first interact with barrier endothelial cells [9]. A number of surface-associated factors that contribute to GBS-brain endothelium interactions have been described such as lipoteichoic acid (LTA) [10], pili [11], serine-rich repeat proteins (Srr) [12], and streptococcal fibronectin-binding protein (SfbA) [13]. Pili, the Srr proteins, and SfbA have been shown to interact with extracellular matrix (ECM) components, which may help to bridge to host receptors such as integrins or other ECM receptors. However, a direct interaction between a GBS adhesin and an endothelial cell receptor has not been described.",

            "text": "Antigen I/II family (AgI/II) proteins are multifunctional adhesins that have been well characterized as colonization determinants of oral streptococci [14]. These proteins mediate attachment of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus gordonii to tooth surfaces and can stimulate an immune response from the colonized host [14]. Genes encoding AgI/II polypeptides are found in streptococcal species indigenous to the human mouth as well as other pathogenic streptococci such as GBS, S. pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus, GAS), and S. suis [14, 15]. Intriguingly, the GAS AgI/II protein AspA (Group A\nStreptococcus\nsurface protein) is absent in many GAS M serotypes and is found predominantly among M serotypes implicated in puerperal sepsis and neonatal infections, including M2, M4, and M28. The gene encoding AspA is located within an integrative and conjugative element designated region of difference 2 (RD2), which likely originated in GBS and was acquired by invasive GAS serotypes through horizontal gene transfer (Fig 1A). It has been proposed that genes carried within RD2 may contribute to pathogenicity of both GAS and GBS in pregnant women and newborns [16, 17]. Supporting this, AspA has been shown to facilitate GAS biofilm formation and virulence in a murine model of GAS respiratory infection [18]. Recently, in silico analysis has revealed four AgI/II gene homologs in GBS, designated Group B\nStreptococcus\nsurface proteins (BspA-D), that are distributed among GBS of different capsular serotypes and sequence types [15, 19, 20].",

            "text": "Previous work has shown that BspA and BspB, which share 90% sequence identity, are found in GBS strain NEM316. BspA has been demonstrated to be important in biofilm formation as well as adherence to epithelial cells and may play a role in facilitating colonization through its ability to bind to vaginal epithelium as well as interact with the hyphal filaments of Candida albicans [15, 20], a frequent fungal colonizer of the lower female reproductive tract. Other GBS strains contain the homolog BspC, or in some cases BspD, which is over 99% identical to BspC, with the major difference being that BspD is missing the leader peptide for targeting to the cell surface by the Sec translocation machinery. While most of the variability between Bsp proteins is in the alanine-rich and proline-rich repeats, the V domain shares 96 to 100% identity across all Bsp homologs [15, 20]. To date, there have not been any studies examining the impact of the AgI/II proteins on GBS invasive disease. A previous study by Chuzeville et al. identified 75 GBS genomes which contain an antigen I/II homolog. Of those 75 CDS, only 40 were associated with transcription and translation signals and out of those, 36 were 2952 base pairs in size encoding the full length BspC protein [19]. Therefore, we chose to investigate the importance of the BspC antigen I/II homolog in the pathogenesis of meningitis. Using targeted mutagenesis, we show that BspC promotes adherence of bacteria to human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (hCMEC) and interacts with the host cytoskeleton component, vimentin. Additionally, we found that BspC and vimentin contribute to the development of GBS meningitis in a mouse infection model. Lastly, we observe that BspC stimulates inflammatory signaling from brain endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo and that this immune signaling involves the NF-\u03baB pathway.",

The proposed domain organization of streptococcal AgI/II polypeptides comprises a stalk consisting of the \u03b1-helical A (alanine-rich repeats) domain and the polyproline II (PPII) helical P domain, separating the V (variable) domain and the C-terminal domain, which contains the LPXTG motif required for cell wall anchorage [14]. While the GBS BspC structure is not known, the structure of several regions of the GBS homolog, BspA, has been solved [15]. We generated a hypothetical model of full length BspC using PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 2.1 Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC) for the purpose of showing the overall domain structure (Fig 1C). Structures of individual BspC domains were generated using Phyre2 server [21]. The V- and C-domains were modeled on the V- and C-domains of BspA (PDB entries 5DZ8 and 5DZA, respectively) [15], and approximately two-thirds of the A-domain sequence was modeled on human fibrinogen (PDB entry 3GHG) [22]. It was not possible to generate models for the N- and P-domains, so the N-domain is shown as a sphere and the P-domain shown is a mirror image of the A-domain.",

We further determined the expression of surface BspC in the WT and complemented strains compared to the \u0394bspC mutant by flow cytometry and immunofluorescent staining with specific BspC antibodies (S1A\u2013S1G Fig). Growth curve analysis demonstrated that the \u0394bspC mutant grew similarly to the WT parental strain under the conditions used here (S1H Fig). Similarly, we observed no differences in hemolytic activity or capsule abundance between the WT and mutant strains (S1I\u2013S1L Fig). High-magnification scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of COH1 strains showed that the \u0394bspC deletion strain exhibits similar surface morphology to the isogenic wild type (Fig 2A and 2B). However, lower-magnification SEM revealed that the \u0394bspC mutant appeared to exhibit decreased interaction between neighboring cells (Fig 2C and 2D).",

Thus, we characterized the ability of the \u0394bspC mutant to attach to and invade hCMEC using our established adherence and invasion assays [10, 25]. The \u0394bspC mutant exhibited a significant decrease in adherence to hCMEC compared to WT GBS, and this defect was complemented when BspC was expressed in the \u0394bspC mutant strain (Fig 2E). This resulted in less recovery of intracellular \u0394bspC mutant (Fig 2F), but together these results indicate that BspC contributes primarily to bacterial attachment to hCMEC. To determine if BspC was sufficient to confer adhesion, we heterologously expressed the GBS bspC gene in the non-adherent, non-pathogenic bacterium Lactococcus lactis. Flow cytometric analysis of L. lactis confirmed surface expression of BspC protein in the strain containing the pMSP.bspC plasmid (S2 Fig). BspC expression resulted in a significant increase in L. lactis adherence to hCMEC compared to L. lactis containing the control vector, while invasion was not affected (Fig 2G and 2H). These results demonstrate that BspC is both necessary and sufficient to confer bacterial adherence to hCMEC.",

We hypothesized that these in vitro phenotypes would translate into a diminished ability to penetrate the BBB and produce meningitis in vivo. Using our standard model of GBS hematogenous meningitis [10, 26, 27], mice were challenged with either WT GBS or the \u0394bspC mutant as described in the Methods. The WT GBS strain caused significantly higher mortality than the isogenic \u0394bspC mutant strain (Fig 3A). By 48 hours, 80% of mice infected with WT COH1 had succumbed to death, while all of the mice infected with the \u0394bspC mutant survived up to or past the experimental endpoint. In a subsequent experiment mice were infected with a lower dose of either WT GBS or the \u0394bspC mutant and were sacrificed at a defined endpoint (72 hrs) to determine bacterial loads in blood, lung, and brain tissue. We recovered similar numbers of the \u0394bspC mutant strain from mouse blood and lung compared to WT; however, we observed a significant decrease in the amounts of the \u0394bspC mutant recovered from the brain tissue (Fig 3B). To confirm these results using other GBS strains, we constructed bspC gene deletions as described in the Methods in two other GBS strains: GBS 515 (ST-23, serotype Ia) and meningeal isolate 90356 (ST-17, serotype III). Mice infected with these mutant strains were also less susceptible to infection and exhibited decreased bacterial loads in the brain compared to the isogenic parental WT strains (S2 Fig). Interestingly, the \u0394bspC mutant in the 515 GBS background, which is a different sequence type and serotype from the other two strains, appeared to also exhibit diminished infiltration into the mouse lungs.",

In subsequent experiments to quantify the total inflammatory infiltrate, whole brains from uninfected mice and mice infected with either WT GBS or \u0394bspC mutant GBS were processed and analyzed by flow cytometry as described in the Methods. There was no significant difference in the numbers of CD45 positive cells between the groups of mice, however within the CD11b positive population we observed higher numbers of Ly6C positive and Ly6G positive cells in the brains of animals infected with WT GBS compared to uninfected mice and mice infected with the \u0394bspC mutant strain (Fig 3E and 3F), indicating an increased population of monocytes and neutrophils. Consistent with these results, we further observed that mice challenged with WT GBS had significantly more of the neutrophil chemokine, KC, as well as the proinflammatory cytokine, IL-1\u03b2, in brain homogenates than \u0394bspC mutant infected animals.

Membrane proteins of hCMEC were separated by 2-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE), then blotted to a PVDF membrane. Following incubation with biotinylated BspC protein, the PVDF membrane was incubated with a streptavidin antibody conjugated to HRP. While many proteins were detected on the Coomassie stained gel, biotinylated BspC protein specifically interacted predominately with one spot in the PVDF membrane with molecular mass around 50\u201355 kDa and isoelectric point (pI) around 5 (Fig 5A and 5B). The corresponding spot from the Coomassie-stained 2-DE gel was excised and digested with trypsin (Fig 5C). Resulting peptides were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The spectra from the spot yielded 158 peptide sequences which matched to human vimentin. The molecular weight, 53.6 kDa, and calculated pI, 5.12, of vimentin match the values for the spot on the 2-DE gels. This procedure was repeated for membrane proteins from another human brain endothelial cell line (hBMEC) that has been used previously to study GBS interactions [31]. Mass spectrometry analysis also determined that BspC interacted with human vimentin (S3A\u2013S3C). The control far Western blot with the streptavidin antibody conjugated to HRP did not show any hybridization (S3D Fig).",

This system is based on the interaction-mediated reconstitution of a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling cascade in Escherichia coli, and has been used successfully to detect and analyze the interactions between a number of different proteins from both prokaryotes and eukaryotes [33]. Using a commercially available kit (Euromedex) according to manufacturer\u2019s directions and as described previously [34], vimentin was cloned and fused to the T25 fragment as a N-terminal fusion (T25-Vimentin), using the pKT25 plasmid, and bspC was cloned as a C-terminal fusion (BspC-T18) using the pUT18 plasmid. To test for interaction, these plasmids were transformed into an E. coli strain lacking adenylate cyclase (cyaA). We observed blue colonies when grown on LB agar plates containing X-gal, indicating \u03b2-galactosidase activity and a positive interaction between Vimentin and BspC compared to the empty vector control (Fig 5D and 5E). A leucine zipper that is fused to the T25 and T18 fragments served as the positive control for the system (Fig 5F). To quantify \u03b2-galactosidase activity, cells grown to log phase were permeabilized with 0.1% SDS and toluene and enzymatic activity measured by adding ONPG as described previously [34]. The E. coli strain containing both vimentin and BspC expressing plasmids exhibited increased \u03b2-galactosidase activity (Miller units) compared to the empty vector control strain (Fig 5G). We also quantified the interaction between BspC and vimentin by performing microscale thermophoresis (MST) [35] as described in Methods. The dissociation constant (Kd) was 3.39\u03bcM as calculated from the fitted curve that plots normalized fluorescence against concentration of vimentin (S4E Fig). These results demonstrate a direct interaction between BspC and vimentin.",

To quantify co-localization of GBS with vimentin, the number of bacteria that overlapped with the vimentin signal was divided by the total number of bacteria in each field of view (Fig 6I).

WT GBS was significantly more adherent to HEK293T cells that express vimentin while the \u0394bspC mutant showed no difference in attachment to either cell line (Fig 7C). Next, we assessed the effect of blocking the vimentin-GBS interaction by treating hCMEC with anti-vimentin antibodies prior to infection with GBS (Fig 7D). Treatment with a vimentin antibody that recognizes the N-terminal epitope (AA31-80), as well as with IgG isotype controls did not alter adherence of the WT or \u0394bspC mutant strains; however, pre-incubation with the mouse V9 antibody [36, 37], which reacts with the C-terminal of vimentin (AA405-466), reduced WT GBS adherence to levels comparable to the adherence of the \u0394bspC mutant (Fig 7E and 7F).

A decreased ability by the GBS \u0394bspC mutant to attach to brain endothelium and induce neutrophil chemoattractants in vitro was correlated with a reduced risk for development of meningitis and markedly diminished lethality in vivo. We identified that BspC interacts directly with host vimentin and that blocking this interaction abrogated BspC-mediated attachment to hCMEC. Further, vimentin deficient mice infected with GBS exhibited decreased mortality, bacterial brain loads, and cytokine production in brain tissue. These results corroborate the growing evidence that this intermediate filament protein plays important roles in the pathogenesis of bacterial infections [38], and provide new evidence for the pivotal role of the BspC adhesin in GBS CNS disease (Fig 9).",

            "text": "The oral streptococcal AgI/II adhesins range in composition from 1310\u20131653 amino acid (AA) residues, while GBS AgI/II proteins are smaller (826\u2013932 AA residues) [39]. The primary sequences of AgI/II proteins are comprised of six distinct regions (Fig 1B), several of which have been shown to mediate the interaction to various host substrates. The S. mutans protein SpaP as well as the S. gordonii proteins SspA and SspB have been demonstrated to interact specifically with the innate immunity scavenger protein gp-340. [40] Recently, the GAS AgI/II protein AspA, as well as BspA, the AgI/II homolog expressed mainly by the GBS strain NEM316, have also been shown to bind to immobilized gp-340 [15, 18]. Gp-340 proteins are involved in various host innate defenses and are present in mucosal secretions, including saliva in the oral cavity and bronchial alveolar fluid in the lung. They can form complexes with other mucosal components such as mucins and function to trap microbes for clearance. However, when gp-340 is immobilized, it can be used by bacteria as a receptor for adherence to the host surface. [15, 41\u201344]. There is evidence that the Variable (V) regions of SspB, SpaP, AspA and BspA facilitate gp340-binding activity [15, 45\u201347]. AgI/II family adhesins have also been shown to interact with other host factors including fibronectin, collagen, and \u03b21 integrins to promote host colonization [14, 48\u201350], demonstrating the multifactorial nature of these adhesins. It is unknown if GBS BspC interactions with other host factors are similar to those of the AgI/II proteins from other streptococci, particularly since the respective V-domains of these homologs are distant enough to suggest different binding partners. Previous work by Chuzeville et al. suggests that the integrative and conjugative element which contains the bspC gene can contribute to bacterial adherence to fibrinogen [19]. Our MST experiments reveal the Kd for the interaction between BspC and vimentin to be 3.39 \u03bcM. This binding affinity is very similar to that observed for other multifunctional bacterial adhesins and their various host ligands. For example, the Kd for the interaction between fibronectin-binding protein B of Staphylococcus aureus and fibrinogen, elastin, and fibronectin has been demonstrated to be 2 \u03bcM, 3.2 \u03bcM, and 2.5 \u03bcM, respectively [51]. Whether BspC can promote adherence to other host factors requires further investigation as these interactions may be critical to GBS colonization of mucosal surfaces such as the gut and the vaginal tract.",

Vimentin is located in the cytoplasm and functions as an intracellular scaffolding protein that maintains structural and mechanical cell integrity [52]. However, vimentin is also found on the surface of numerous cells such as T cells, platelets, neutrophils, activated macrophages, vascular endothelial cells, skeletal muscle cells, and brain microvascular endothelial cells [53\u201360]. Vimentin also mediates a variety of cellular processes including cell adhesion, immune signaling, and autophagy [55, 61, 62]. Further, the role of cell surface vimentin as an attachment receptor facilitating bacterial or viral entry has been previously documented for other pathogens [38, 63\u201365]. The BspC domain that mediates the vimentin interaction is currently under investigation. As the V domain is likely projected from the cell surface and has been implicated in host interactions for other streptococci, we hypothesize that this may be a critical domain for this interaction. Additionally, as the V-domain of other Bsp homologs share 96\u2013100% identity with the V-domain of BspC, we predict that the other Bsp proteins might also interact with vimentin, but this would be a topic for future investigation.",

Thus, vimentin has been shown to be important in experimental models of infection at body sites other than the brain [38, 57, 60, 66, 67]. Interestingly, previous studies on the meningeal pathogen E. coli K1 have demonstrated that the bacterial surface factor, IbeA, interacts with vimentin to promote bacterial uptake into brain endothelial cells [60, 68]. Similarly, while our study was underway, it was reported that another bacterium capable of causing meningitis, L. monocytogenes, uses InlF to interact with vimentin to promote brain invasion [67]. Along with our results presented here, this may suggest a common mechanism for meningeal bacterial pathogens to penetrate the BBB and cause CNS disease. However, our analysis of these three bacteria proteins showed no homology or predicted regions that might commonly interact with vimentin. Furthermore, the interaction between the E. coli receptor IbeA and the L. monocytogenes receptor InlF with cell-surface vimentin can be blocked by an antibody to the N-terminal region of vimentin [60, 67], while we demonstrate that the interaction between BspC and cell-surface vimentin can be blocked with an antibody to the C-terminal of vimentin. The implications of this unique interaction between a bacterial receptor and the C-terminal of vimentin remain to be explored.",

            "text": "Neuronal injury during bacterial meningitis involves both microbial and host factors, and subsequent to attachment to the brain endothelium and penetration of the BBB, GBS stimulation of host immune pathways is the next important step in the progression of meningitis. The release of inflammatory factors by brain endothelial cells, microglia, astrocytes, and infiltrating immune cells can exacerbate neuronal injury [9]. Our data suggest that, like other streptococcal AgI/II family polypeptides, BspC plays a role in immune stimulation. AgI/II family proteins contain two antigenic regions (the antigens I/II and II) [69] and this ability to elicit an inflammatory response makes SpaP, the S. mutans AgI/II protein, an attractive candidate for vaccine development to prevent dental caries [14, 70]. In this study we found that BspC can stimulate NF-\u03baB activation and the release of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-8 and CXCL-1 from hCMEC. Both of these chemokines are major neutrophil recruiting chemoattractants and are the most highly induced during GBS infection [27, 71]. We observed that mice infected with GBS mutants that lack BspC exhibited lower brain bacterial loads and less meningeal inflammation compared to animals challenged with WT GBS. Interestingly, WT and \u0394bspC mutant bacterial loads were similar in the blood, indicating that BspC may not influence GBS survival and proliferation in the blood; however, further investigation is warranted.",

            "text": "This study demonstrates for the first time the importance of a streptococcal AgI/II protein, BspC, in the progression of bacterial meningitis. Our data demonstrate that BspC, likely in concert with other GBS surface determinants mentioned above (pili, Srr1/2, SfbA), contributes to the critical first step of GBS attachment to brain endothelium. As the other described GBS surface factors have been shown to interact with ECM components, BspC may mediate a more direct interaction with the host cell as it facilitates interaction with vimentin. We have observed a unique requirement for vimentin to the pathogenesis of CNS disease; vimentin KO mice were markedly less susceptible to GBS infection and exhibited reduced bacterial tissue load and inflammatory signaling. Vimentin is also known to act as a scaffold for important signaling molecules and mediates the activation of a variety of signaling pathways including NOD2 (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2) and NLRP3 (nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-containing family pyrin domain-containing-3) that recognize bacterial peptidoglycan and activate inflammatory response via NF-\u03baB signaling [68, 72, 73]. Thus, continued investigation into the mechanisms of how BspC-vimentin interactions dually promote bacterial attachment and immune responses, as well as how BspC expression may be regulated and whether known GBS two-component systems are involved, is warranted. These studies will provide important information that may inform future therapeutic strategies to limit GBS disease progression.",
