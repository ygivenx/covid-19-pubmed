Clinical presentation is characterized with acute diarrhoea, vomiting and dehydration in pigs of all ages, with a possible high mortality in suckling piglets [1]. The causative agent is porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), a positive single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Coronaviridae family (genus Alphacoronavirus) [2]. The PEDV genome (~ 28 kb-long) comprises at least seven open reading frames (ORF1a, ORF1b, and ORF2\u20136) that encode four structural proteins (spike \u201eS\u201c, envelope \u201eE\u201c, membrane \u201eM \u201cand nucleocapsid \u201eN\u201c), two non-structural polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) and an accessory ORF3 protein [3]. The full-length S gene is known to be a suitable sequencing locus when it comes to the investigation into genetic relatedness and PEDV molecular epidemiology [4].",

Two PEDV variants were proven to co-circulate in the USA at the time, i.e. S-INDEL (lower pathogenicity due to INsertions and DELetions seen in the S gene) and S2aa-del S gene variant (two amino acid deletions) [8, 9]. Moreover, recent reports confirmed the presence of PEDV strains with large deletions in S gene even in mixed infections caused by other S gene-containing PEDV variants [10, 11]. Since 2014, PEDV has re-emerged in Europe, but with milder consequences [12]. The PEDV strains behind the European PED outbreaks were of the S-INDEL genotype [12]. The only exception was the PEDV outbreak in Ukraine [13] caused by a highly virulent non-S-INDEL genotype strain, which, together with S-INDEL genotype strains and other PEDV variants, represents the group of newly-emerging PEDV strains that have appeared after 2010 [14]. On top of the above, there exists a group of classical PEDV strains, in circulation ever since the 1970s [14].",

The sera of animals bred on the 2016 PEDV outbreak starting point were all negative, as were the animal sera retrieved on backyard holdings, which represented the majority of holdings tested within this frame.",

            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhoea has gained a lot of attention worldwide ever since 2013 due to the emergence of novel genotype strains in the USA. Croatia was considered PEDV-free until 2016, when the first outbreak was reported. This paper brings data on the first PED outbreak, molecular characterization of the detected PEDV strain and the subsequent serological workup. The first Croatian PEDV outbreak was reported later than in other western European countries [12], in the timeframe similar to Hungary [18] and Serbia [19]. However, the possibility of previous PEDV circulation cannot be excluded due to the general underreporting of gastrointestinal pig diseases in Croatia. The results of phylogenetic analysis showed the first Croatian PEDV strain to strongly resemble to the western European PEDV S-INDEL strains (Fig. 2), especially those detected in Germany and Austria (99.4\u201399.5% similarity on aa level) in 2015 [20, 21], which may suggest a trans-boundary route of spread. The amino acid sequence similarity with PEDV strains found in other surrounding countries was slightly lower; 99.0\u201399.2% with Romanian [20], Italian [22] and Slovenian [23] strains, and only 98.4% with the recombinant Hungarian [18] PEDV strain (sequencing data on the Serbian strain were not available). However, when it comes to the S gene-based comparisons, a possibly lower resolution should be taken into account as a limitation factor, which is not the case should the comparison be whole genome sequence-based. In the latter case, German, Austrian and Romanian PEDV strains referred to above, form a separate cluster different from 2014 German PEDV strains (strains found in Slovenia and Italy were not included) [20]. Unfortunately, our attempts to obtain the complete PEDV genome using the NGS, as well as those to isolate the virus in cell culture, were not successful, probably due to the condition of the sample which was subjected to several freeze-thaw cycles prior to sequencing. Even though the role of bacteriophages in the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal pig diseases has been hypothesized [24], we are of the opinion that their abundance suggested by NGS results does not compromise the role of PEDV as the main causative agent of this outbreak. We came to such a conclusion primarily due to the clinical presentation of the affected animals, epidemiological situation in the affected region, and the laboratory findings. Of note, the NGS was focused on virome; hence the involvement of bacteria and parasites in the clinical outcome might be underestimated. It is extremely difficult to determine the exact route of PEDV entry into a country based solely on sequencing and not detailed epidemiological data on human, animal and vehicle circulation. It is important to emphasize that Croatian pig production is characterized by a high, an ever increasing import volume of live pigs and pork, coming mostly from the EU member states, above all the Netherlands and Germany [25]. Therefore, there exists a possibility of co-circulation of other emerging enterotropic coronaviruses across Croatian pig population, primarily other PEDV S gene variants, porcine deltacoronavirus and TGEV-PEDV recombinant strains (SeCoV). The latter are known to circulate in Europe [26\u201328], but were excluded as the causative agent of the outbreak reported here (Figs. 2 and 3).",

            "text": "The second part of this study was oriented towards an indirect screening of PEDV circulation in pigs bred in three counties surrounding the location of the initial 2016 outbreak (Fig. 1). Therefore, in 2017 almost 400 sera of animals bred on 44 different holdings were tested, out of which 62 tested PEDV IgG- positive. The latter pigs were bred on four different holdings seated in two different Croatian counties (Table 1, Fig. 1). Data on PEDV Ab-seroprevalence in Europe are limited; the results are mostly negative or show low seroprevalence rates [12, 29], except for the Northern Italy where the seroprevalence is high [30]. All positive pigs-hosting holdings embraced by our study are managed by the same enterprise, which had never reported the disease before. However, in the late January 2017 the PEDV outbreak did occur, and was subsequently reported by the managing company [31]. Moreover, the losses were substantial, since three finisher and seven farrow-to-wean farms (out of nine) were affected (16,500 sows in total) with the 55 to 75%-mortality in suckling piglets [31]. Unfortunately, we couldn\u2019t perform the molecular analysis on the PEDV strain responsible for the outbreak, since the company engaged a private German laboratory and the samples weren\u2019t available to us (personal communication). In the present study, sampling timing was crucial for indirect detection of PEDV circulation on the affected farms (three finisher farms and one farrow-to-wean farm), since the antibodies against PEDV are known to be short-living [32]. The short life span of these antibodies might also be the reason behind negative results of the ELISA assay performed in pigs bred on the holding that hosted the primary 2016 outbreak, since the serology was done over a year later. Moreover, herd replacement practice and the possible introduction of na\u00efve (PEDV Ab- negative) pigs that became a part of our random sample must also be taken into account. Even though the majority of holdings were of a backyard type, hence exercising poor biosecurity practices, they all (indirectly) tested PEDV-negative (negative IgG ELISA assay). As oppose to large, intense farming holdings, backyard holdings are characterized with lesser people/animal/vehicle circulation, known to be the major biosecurity risk for PEDV entrance and spread [30, 33]. Nevertheless, negative results must be interpreted with caution due to the abovementioned reasons coupled with well-known lower sensitivity of commercially available ELISA kits [34]. Despite the cross-reactivity between PEDV and TGEV that can take place when commercial Ab ELISA tests are used [35, 36], epidemiological evidence of a PEDV outbreak elaborated above [31] strongly suggest that the specificity of the Ab ELISA test used within the study frame was not an issue. Future studies on PEDV serology should include different diagnostic methods, so as to minimize the impact of test sensitivity/specificity variations. Moreover, detailed and representative epidemiological data obtained from the owners and veterinary officials are compulsory for the reliable interpretation of results.",

Sequencing data were analysed using the Geneious R10 Software (Biomatters Ltd., Auckland, New Zealand). Raw Illumina reads were trimmed for quality (phred quality score < 30) and short reads (< 75 bp) were discarded. The remaining paired reads were merged and non-merged reads/duplicates were discarded. Trimmed and merged reads were compared to the NCBI GenBank non-redundant nucleotide (BLASTn) with an E-value cut-off of 10\u2212 4; the search was filtered so as to be restricted to the sequences in the database that correspond to the subset Viruses (taxid:10239). The BLAST output was used to create a taxonomic classification of the reads and contigs with the Megan 6.15.2. [41]. With the exception of the Caudovirales family, the obtained virus reads were extracted and further mapped against the GenBank viral non-redundant protein dataset (BLASTx) for confirmation. Furthermore, reads were mapped against the PEDV reference genome downloaded from the NCBI (KU297956).",

In the third step of the PEDV S gene conventional amplification, the gap was closed by designing an additional primer set. The primers PEDV-S1/2F (5\u2032-AACCATGTACAGCTAATTGC-3\u2032) and PEDV-S1/2R (5\u2032-ACCCATTGATAGTAGTGTCAG-3\u2032) were employed with the abovementioned RT-PCR reagents under the above cycling conditions in the manner much the same as with the amplification that makes use of PEDV-S1F/PEDV-S1R primers, the only difference being a shorter elongation time (1 min).

An agricultural holding that provided samples of aborted sows was included, as well. In total, 397 pig blood samples were retrieved from 44 randomly selected agricultural holdings (13 large and 31 small backyard holdings) seated in three eastern Croatian counties (Osijek-Baranja County, Vukovar-Srijem County, Brod-Posavina County) (Fig. 1, Table 1). The samples were taken from 204 sows and 193 finishers, the average number of samples retrieved on large holdings being 19.5 (range 3\u201332), and that harvested on backyard holdings being 3.7 (range 1\u201312). Among the holdings seated in the Osijek-Baranja County included into the study, the holding that hosted the primary 2016 PEDV outbreak was embraced, as well. In the majority of holdings (40/44), the sample size was tailored so as to be able to detect a 10%-seroprevalence within a 95% confidence interval, while on three holdings the sample size was set out so as to enable the detection of 20%-seroprevalence within a 95% confidence interval (one large farrow-to-wean holding with three samples of aborted sows didn\u2019t meet these criteria). Blood samples were taken from the jugular vein into sterile tubes without anticoagulants, transported and stored in a cold environment (+ 4 \u00b0C). The sera were separated from cellular elements by virtue of coagulated blood centrifugation for 15 min at 1,000 g (blood clots thereby being rimmed with a sterile glass stick so as to facilitate separation) and stored at \u2212 20 \u00b0C prior to testing. All sera were tested for the presence of specific IgG antibodies against PEDV using an ID Screen\u00ae PEDV Indirect ELISA test (IDVet, France).",
