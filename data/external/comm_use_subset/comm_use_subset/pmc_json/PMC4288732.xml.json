Estimating the relative contribution of each is of fundamental importance for the planning and implementation of appropriate infection control and preventive measures. This can be an extremely difficult task if humans and animals share the same physical space, and/or if experimentation (e.g. to quantify the probability of animal-to-animal transmission) is subjected to serious limitations. This is the case of Lassa fever (LF), a rodent-borne disease endemic in West Africa. Despite its clear zoonotic origin, there are strong arguments, listed below, to hypothesize that a significant proportion of the burden of LF in humans arises from human-to-human transmission. The aim of this work is to test whether or not patterns in the epidemic curve describing the cases of LF observed in Sierra Leone [1], are compatible with patterns observed in chains of pure human-to-human transmission recorded in nosocomial and extra-nosocomial outbreaks [2], [3].",

The disease was first recognized in the village of Lassa, Nigeria in 1969, which caused the death of two missionary-nurses and the grave illness of a third [4]. However, cases consistent with LF from the eastern part of Sierra Leone can be traced back to \n[5]. Since the identification of LASV, human-to-human transmission has been documented in several nosocomial outbreaks (e.g.\n[2], [3] and also [6] for a review), leading to an initial perception that the virus was both highly contagious and virulent [4]; this resulted in stringent requirements for containment of the patients [7]. Soon after, its zoonotic origin was recognized and Mastomys natalensis, one of the most common African rodents, was identified as the reservoir of the virus [8]. The risk of nosocomial transmission was shown to be dramatically reduced by using simple barrier nursing method [7], [9]\u2013[11], suggesting that the risk of human-to-human transmission might be negligible.",

            "text": "This narrative concerning the relative importance of human-to-human transmission for LASV, however, requires re-evaluation as there are important indications of human-to-human transmission. More precisely, one of the early nosocomial outbreaks, in Jos, Nigeria (see [2], Fig. 1 and also the Supporting Information, S2 Text) was triggered by an index case that transmitted to possibly  others in the hospital, with no indication of iatrogenic transfer. Further cases of extra-hospital transmission within a single family (five from the same family, , , , , and  who likely initiated the chain) were reported, here and throughout we refer to this chain as an \u2018extra-nosocomial\u2019 chain. Haas et al.\n[14] investigated secondary transmission after an imported case of LF into Europe and found that one of  contacts that were tested serologically, a physician who examined the patient on day  of illness, had become infected. The authors concluded that, during the initial phase of symptomatic LF the risk of transmission is low, but it may increase with progression of disease and increasing viral excretion. Emond et al.\n[15] described a case of LF in the UK in which the virus was isolated from urine  days after the acute phase had ended, despite not being detected earlier. The virus may also be found in pharyngeal secretions for  weeks after the onset of clinical signs [16]. In an experimental model, Stephenson et al.\n[17] showed the ability to infect guinea pigs and cynomolgus monkeys with LASV via the respiratory route and Peters et al.\n[18] demonstrated fatal LASV transmission to monkeys through being held in the same room for  days with inoculated rodents. Sagripanti et al.\n[19], in a dark room at ambient laboratory temperatures controlled between  and  and  relative humidity, showed that the time required for a  reduction in viral load of LASV in glass containers was  hours and was  days for a  relative humidity. Also, Kern\u00e9is et al.\n[20] identified that risk factors for positive seroconversion to LASV included either having received a medical injection, or having lived with someone displaying a haemorrhage, in the previous twelve months. No factors related to contact with rodents were identified. Similarly, McCormick et al.\n[21] reported a lack of correlation between human LASV-specific IgG prevalence and either the level of domestic infestation by Mastomys, or the presence of LASV infection in Mastomys. These observations, taken together, suggest that a significant (if perhaps variable) proportion of the burden of LF might be associated with human-to-human transmission.",

The current Ebola outbreak has emphasised further the need for targeted biosecure measures which distinguish managing hemorrhagic fever cases and outbreaks from preventing spillover from reservoirs. This issue has not previously been fully addressed for Lassa Fever. Traditional approaches, such as cluster analysis, to distinguish human-to-human transmission from pure zoonotic transmission cannot be employed here due to the potential of clustering of infection in households from common exposure to infected rodents in addition to clustering arising from infected people. We overcome this problem by adapting other approaches [29], [30], and using data from nosocomial and extra-nosocomial outbreaks and hospitalized patients in Kenema Governmental Hospital (KGH), Sierra Leone [1]. We use these data to provide an estimation of the contribution of human-to-human transmission to the Lassa fever occurrence in endemic areas and to provide a more-robust assessment of the risk of secondary spread from index cases.",

This information was directly obtained from the literature [2], [3], which provided detailed descriptions of the network of contacts (Fig. 1 and S1 table in S2 Text). Inspired by the work of Wallinga and Teunis [29], the relative likelihood  that case  has been infected by case  was calculated as:(1)here  is the time of exposure of case  to case  while case  is infectious, i.e. the interval  is given by the intersection , where  is the infectious period of case , calculated as the difference between the time , when the symptoms end (either because the patient recovers or dies) and the time , when the symptoms begin;  is the duration of exposure of case  to case  provided by the literature [2], [3]. It is important to note that , and thus , is explicitly time-dependent, (Fig. 1.D). The index  represents all possible cases within a nosocomial outbreak. Important underlying assumptions are: each event can independently start a new chain of human-to-human transmission, beginning of infectiousness coincides with the onset of symptoms, and infections occur with equal probability at any time during the interval . Accordingly, the sum  over all cases , represents the individual effective reproduction number for case  at the time  when the case arises. If multiple cases are observed at the same time , then  is averaged appropriately. To increase the sample size and improve the estimation, the duration of the symptoms of LF and the period spent at the hospital associated with each patient were randomly rearranged among the  cases (Fig. 1.C), then the ensemble average individual effective reproduction number was calculated based on  of these permutations. The network of contacts was kept the same. The identical approach was used to calculate the effective reproduction number, , for the extra-nosocomial situation, with the network of contacts restricted to the family , , ,  and  who presumably initiated the chain. We use the notation  and  to indicate the set of all individual effective reproduction numbers for the nosocomial and extra-nosocomial cases respectively, while the total effective reproduction numbers  and  represent the corresponding average number of cases during the entire outbreak, i.e.\n and  respectively. To adjust for the different duration expected in different outbreaks, we calculate a daily mean effective reproduction number as  and  where  and  are the typical duration of the nosocomial and extra-nosocomial outbreaks.",

Therefore we made a conservative choice of  days which corresponds to the maximum duration of the Jos outbreak (here the last day corresponds to when case  recovered). Any shorter choice of the duration , will result in a larger value of the proportion  (for instance if the typical duration of the outbreak is  days, i.e. including while  was at the hospital, we found that  instead of  while the estimates based on the intersection with the -percentile and -percentile were  and  respectively rather than  and ), which reinforces the key message of this current work that a significant proportion of cases of LF arises from human-to-human transmission.",

This is probably reasonable, but public health measures may impact on this in the future. The predictions are based on the assumption of uniform mixing, i.e. each case from KGH is potentially in contact with each other case. Although this is a reasonable assumption, considering the large human mobility in Sierra Leone, for livelihoods, work and trade, social visits and events [54], it will overestimate . In addition, there is likely to be incomplete reporting which will underestimate . Although the two factors might compensate for each other, if KGH could reduce reporting bias and increase information on network contacts, it would be highly beneficial to studies such as this, especially as human mobility and overcrowding has been associated with an amplification of LF [31]. This represents a further area where participatory modeling/ethnographic research is much needed to gather information on actual patterns of mobility and social networking, and hence potential contact patterns.",
