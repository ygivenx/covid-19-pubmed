CHIKV is the aetiological agent of chikungunya fever (CF) and was first isolated in 1952 from the serum of a febrile patient during an outbreak in Tanzania, Africa [1]. CHIKV infection is characterized by an abrupt onset of fever lasting two to five days, frequently accompanied by arthralgia. The disease is usually self-limiting, but joint pain symptoms can persists for weeks up to years [2\u20134]. Other common symptoms include muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue and rash similar to the dengue virus infection. Besides CHIKV, the Alphavirus genus includes viruses such as O'nyong'nyong virus (ONNV), Ross River virus (RRV), Barmah Forest virus (BFV), Sindbis virus (SNV) and Mayaro virus (MAYV) [5].",

Phylogenetic analysis of CHIKV showed that the virus has evolved into three distinct genotypes: Asian, West African and Eastern/Central /South African (ECSA) [11]. A single-base mutation E1-A226V in a strain of the ECSA genotype enhanced replication of the virus in Ae. albopictus, and led to a large-scale epidemic on La Reunion in 2005 [12]. This ECSA genotype was subsequently associated with epidemics in the Indian Ocean region, and the Asian genotype has been associated with recent outbreaks in the Pacific region [13].",

Several RT-PCR assays have been published for the detection of CHIKV RNA in clinical specimens and mosquito samples [17\u201323]. Real-time RT-PCR based assays are suitable for clinical diagnosis due to the closed tube assay format, the option for quantification of viral load, high sensitivity and specificity. Serological tests are applied to either acute or convalescent phase samples for the detection of IgM and IgG anti-CHIKV antibodies. Serological diagnosis is confirmed by direct detection of IgM anti-CHIKV antibodies or by determining a four-fold increase in CHIKV-specific antibody titers in acute and convalescent samples by ELISA, IFT or PRNT tests [15].",

The recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assay utilizes enzymes and proteins in order to allow the amplification of the DNA at a constant temperature (38\u201342\u00b0C) [24]. The presence of the amplicon is detected via the exo-probe, which include an internal abasic site mimic (tetrahydrofuran, THF) flanking fluorophore and Quencher as well as pathogen-specific 30 and 15 bases at both the 5\u00b4 and 3\u00b4 prime ends, respectively. Upon the hybridization of the exo-probe to the complementary sequence the Exonuclease III cleaves at the THF site and the fluorescence signal is generated. RPA assay was successfully developed for the detection of DENV and YFV as well as other human and veterinary pathogens [25\u201332]. Moreover, a mobile suitcase laboratory was established for allowing the deployment of the RPA in the field for identifying Ebola virus infected case [33].",
