Despite innovations in intensive care medicine, the mortality of ARDS remains up to 40% [2]. Therefore, clarification of the unknown pathophysiology and the development of effective therapeutics are urgently needed to overcome the life-threatening conditions induced by ALI/ARDS. It has been suggested that the type and severity of injury may affect the occurrence of ALI/ARDS; however, it remains unclear why up to 50% of individuals are not affected despite experiencing similar injuries [3,4]. Several genetic variants have been suggested to be associated with the development and progression of ALI/ARDS (reviewed by Flores et al. [5]).",

            "text": "The human angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene (ACE) is located on chromosome 17q23 and contains an insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of a 287-bpAlu repeat sequence in intron 16 [6,7]. Recently, strong evidence has accumulated for a pathophysiological association between lung and kidney diseases and the ACE I/D polymorphism, which is correlated with circulating and cellular ACE levels [8-12]. This evidence has been rendered using a meta-analysis approach that provided the most reliable compilation of the data currently available in the field [13,14]. The studies of Marshall et al. [15], Jerng et al. [16], Lu et al. [17], and Adamzik et al. [18] have shown a significant positive association between the ACE I/D polymorphism and the risk and/or mortality of ALI/ARDS, although the studies of Chan et al. [19], Plunkett et al. [20], and Villar et al. [21] failed to detect a positive association (Additional file 1: Table S1). This association therefore remains controversial. The discrepancy among these results may be because of different sample sizes, because the sample sizes of these studies were quite small for genetic association analysis. To overcome this limitation, Hu et al. [8] conducted a meta-analysis and reported that the ACE I/D polymorphism was associated with the risk of ALI/ARDS. However, we have noticed that two relevant studies were not included in this meta-analysis. Hence, to obtain a reliable conclusion regarding the association between the ACE I/D polymorphism and ALI/ARDS risk, we conducted an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of all relevant publications, increasing the sample size from 3133 (in Hu et al.[8]) to 4996. In addition, we carried out a meta-analysis between the ACE I/D polymorphism and the mortality of ALI/ARDS.",

Because the mode of inheritance of ALI/ARDS is unknown, we performed a meta-analysis with the allele (I allele versus D allele), dominant (I/I versus I/D + D/D), and recessive (I/I + I/D versus D/D) models (as recommended in [24]). The meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager Version 5.0 for Windows (Cochrane Collaboration, http://www.cc-ims.net/RevMan). Cochran\u2019s chi-square-based Q-statistic test was applied to assess between-study heterogeneity. We included healthy subjects and patients without ALI/ARDS (e.g., intensive care unit patients who did not fulfill the criteria for ALI/ARDS) as separate controls. The pooled odds ratios (OR) were calculated using DerSimonian-Laird random-effects models [25] with 95% confidence intervals (CI) to measure the strength of the association. I2 indicates the percentage variance in the pooled OR that can be attributed to heterogeneity. Values of 25% are considered low, 50% moderate, and 75% high. We applied the conservative random effects model for all comparisons because the underlying effect may differ across studies and among heterogeneous populations. When we searched the HapMap database, we identified different linkage disequilibrium groups around the ACE gene among different ethnicities. Therefore, we conducted additional sensitivity analyses, separating the Caucasian and Asian participants. Finally, Bonferroni\u2019s correction was used to control the type I error rate in the meta-analysis of mortality. We employed 18 separate tests (three genotype models: allele, dominant, and recessive; three populations: total, Caucasians, and Asians; and two traits: susceptibility and mortality); therefore, we calculated the corrected P value by multiplying the original P value by 18. P was considered significant at less than 0.05.",

Two studies [16,20] did not include healthy subjects as control in their analysis; therefore, we used the remaining five [15,17-19,21], comprising 418 ALI/ARDS patients and 3032 healthy control subjects. We found significant heterogeneities among the ORs (Pallele < 0.0001, Pdominant = 0.003, and Precessive = 0.004) (Additional file 2: Figure S1, Additional file 3: Figure S2, Additional file 4: Figure S3).

There was no significant publication bias using either the Egger test or the rank correlation test (data not shown). To limit the ethnic heterogeneity, we separated the studies into those with either Caucasian or Asian samples. In the three studies with Caucasian subjects [15,18,21], comprising 300 patients and 2470 healthy controls, we found significant heterogeneity among the ORs (Pallele < 0.0001, Pdominant = 0.001, Precessive = 0.0006) (Additional file 2: Figure S1, Additional file 3: Figure S2, Additional file 4: Figure S3).

ACE is a key enzyme of the RAS that converts inactive angiotensin I to the vasoactive and aldosterone-stimulating peptide angiotensin II that metabolizes kinins and many other biologically active peptides [31]. ACE is found in varying amounts on the surface of lung epithelial and endothelial cells. Activation of the RAS can stimulate production of tumor necrosis factor alpha in cardiac fibroblasts [32]. Angiotensin II induces apoptosis of lung epithelial and endothelial cells and is a potent fibrogenic factor [33-36]. Based on these biological properties of ACE, there is considerable interest in its potential involvement in ALI/ARDS.",

Here, we have extended this meta-analysis to a much larger sample size (532 ALI/ARDS patients, 3032 healthy controls, and 1432 patients without ALI/ARDS), and failed to detect an association between the ACE I/D polymorphism and ALI/ARDS risk. The discrepancy may be because of the different methodology used and the different sample size. We believe that our result is more convincing because we added two studies to those used by Hu et al. [8] and also used three genetic models, as recommended in the literature [24]. Furthermore, we extended our meta-analysis to examine mortality, and detected a significant association between the ACE I/D polymorphism and the mortality risk of ALI/ARDS in Asian populations.",

The ACE I/D polymorphism has been associated with 28\u201347% of the variance in circulating ACE levels in healthy subjects, and high plasma ACE levels are associated with the D/D genotype [6,7]. It is therefore possible that the high plasma ACE levels produced by having the D/D genotype affect the mortality of ALI/ARDS. Recently, ACE inhibitors have been reported to attenuate ALI induced by bleomycin, acid, and endotoxin in animal models [37-39]. Taken together, patients at risk of mortality from ALI/ARDS, as determined by ACE I/D polymorphism screening, may be good candidates for treatment with ACE inhibitors. Furthermore, because our results suggest that the ACE I/D polymorphism genotype might influence treatment outcome through differences in drug metabolism and activity, it will be important to investigate the pharmacogenomics of ALI/ARDS and gene\u2013gene interactions in the RAS to clarify the role of different RAS genes in the pathophysiology and treatment response of ALI/ARDS.",

Differences in the genotype distributions have been reported between Caucasians and Asians, which may support the above explanations (the studies of Villar et al.[21] and Adamzik et al.[18] reported that the major allele was \u201cDeletion\u201d, but other Asian studies showed that the major allele was \u201cInsertion\u201d). Therefore, we stratified the population into Caucasian and Asian subjects, thereby eliminating the significant heterogeneity among the ORs for both ethnicities. After stratification, we detected a significant association between the ACE I/D polymorphism and ALI/ARDS mortality in Asian populations.

Neither the mode of inheritance nor the heritability of ALI/ARDS is known. Therefore, we used three genetic models to obtain more statistical power than in previous individual studies. Based on the common disease-common variant hypothesis, and assuming ALI/ARDS to be a complex disease, at least 4000 samples ( i.e., 2000 cases and 2000 controls) are required to obtain sufficient statistical power (GRR = 2.0 and P = 5 \u00d7 10-7) [40]. Given that our study is under-powered because of its small sample size, we may have failed to detect a genuine association between the ACE I/D polymorphism genotype and ALI/ARDS susceptibility. A replication study using a larger sample size, and/or samples from other populations, is required to obtain conclusive results.",
