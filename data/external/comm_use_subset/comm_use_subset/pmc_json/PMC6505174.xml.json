            "text": "The mouse inbred strains used in these experiments are the eight founder strains of the Collaborative Cross (CC) (Collaborative Cross Consortium 2012). The founders of the CC include five classical strains, A/J (AJ), C57BL/6J (B6), 129S1/SvImJ (129S1), NOD/ShiLtJ (NOD), NZO/HlLtJ (NZO), and three wild-derived strains, CAST/EiJ (CAST), PWK/PhJ (PWK), and WSB/EiJ (WSB). Mice originated from a colony maintained by Gary Churchill at the Jackson Laboratory, and were transferred to the FPMV lab at the University of North Carolina (UNC) in 2008. The original colony also produced most of the G1 breeders that populated the inbred funnels at ORNL, TAU and Geniad (Srivastava et al. 2017). All mice described here were reared by the FPMV lab at UNC. Mice were bred at the UNC Hillsborough vivarium from 2008-2010 and bred at the UNC Genetic Medicine Building (GMB) vivarium from 2010-2012. A total of 4,448 litters resulting from crosses between 1,478 individual dams and 1,238 individual sires were born from all eight inbred crosses and 54 of 56 reciprocal F1 hybrid crosses, excluding hybrids between NZO\u00d7CAST and NZO\u00d7PWK, which are known unproductive crosses (Chesler et al. 2008). The directions of all crosses are described as female by male (i.e., dam.strain \u00d7 sire.strain), unless otherwise noted. Litter size and sex were determined at weaning by visual inspection. Animals were kept on a 14-hour, 10-hour light/dark schedule with lights turned on at 7:00 am; temperature was maintained at 20\u00b0-24\u00b0 with relative humidity between 40\u201350%. Mice were housed in standard 20\u00d730-cm ventilated polysulfone cages with standard laboratory grade Bed-O-Cob bedding. Water and Purina Prolab RMH3000 were available ad libitum. Mouse chow was supplemented with Fenbendazole (Feb 2010) two weeks before and two weeks after transportation to the GMB facility to eliminate possible pinworms. Selamectin treatment was dropped onto the coats of mice before transfer to remove mites from the cages. These treated cages were not opened until after their arrival at UNC GMB. All animal rearing and breeding was conducted in strict compliance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Institute of Laboratory Animals Resources, National Research Council 1996, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK232589/). The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of North Carolina approved all animal use and research described here.",

In more detail, the a (\u201cadditive\u201d) class represents strain-specific dosage effects, with a1,\u2026,a8 modeled as aj\u223cNstz(0,\u03c4a2), where Nstz is a normal distribution subject to the sum-to-zero constraint \u2211jaj=0 [using the approach of Crowley et al.

The m (\u201cparental sex\u201d) class represents parent-of-origin effects, modeled as mj\u223cNstz(0,\u03c4m2), where a positive value of mj implies that strain j increases litter size more when inherited through the maternal line, with the difference between maternal and paternal being 2mj (since the design matrix entry for mj is coded +1 for dam and \u22121 for sire).

Posterior samples of these quantities were obtained as a post-processing step by reparameterizing posterior samples of aj and mj. Obtaining these as a post-processing step, rather than explicit modification of Equation 2, preserves the original BayesDiallel model and therefore has no effect on the effect estimates (or variance projection estimates) for the other diallel categories.

The inbred penalty (\u03b2inbred, b) is comparable to dominance measures defined in, for example, Hayman (1954). The parental sex effects (m) are akin to the maternal effects of Topham (1966) and the \u201cextranuclear\u201d effects in the \u201cbio\u201d model of Cockerham and Weir (1977) and Zhu and Weir (1996), and the bio model\u2019s reparameterization to indirectly estimate dam and sire effects has been described in, for example, Lynch and Walsh (1998). The estimation of dam and sire effects directly, as explicit model parameters for the diallel, was proposed by Comstock and Robinson (1948, 1952). The main differences between these earlier analyses and ours are the simultaneous inclusion of all parameter groups, the use of a Bayesian random effects framework to allow all these parameters to be fitted, and the extension to modeling a non-Gaussian response.",

This is a heritability-like measure that partitions the overall phenotypic variance of an idealized future diallel experiment into additive, parent-of-origin (parental sex), inbred (dominance), epistatic, and other random/fixed effects categories in the diallel. Rather than being based on estimated variance parameters (e.g., \u03c4a2,\u03c4b2,\u2026), which are typically ill-informed by the data and thus both uncertain and sensitive to priors, the VarP uses the estimated effects themselves, both fixed (e.g., \u03b2inbred) and random (i.e., the best linear unbiased predictors, or BLUPs, such as a1,a2,\u2026), since these are well-informed, precise and regularized by shrinkage. The VarP calculation involves ratios of sums-of-squares in similar fashion to R2 but for an idealized diallel that is both complete and balanced. As an R2-like measure, the VarP is reportable for both fixed and random effects, and includes confidence intervals arising from posterior uncertainty in those effects\u2019 values.",

The eight inbred strains, displayed across the diagonal, were mated at higher frequencies both for maintenance of inbred strains and propagation of the diallel. For all 62 genetic inbred and hybrid crosses, we recorded the following information: mated pairs, wean dates, litter size at weaning, including total and sex-specific counts (File S1). This diallel cross was originally designed and maintained for the generation of F1 mice for several experimental projects (Koturbash et al. 2011; Aylor et al. 2011; Mathes et al. 2011; Kelada et al. 2012; Didion et al. 2012; Collaborative Cross Consortium 2012; Calaway et al. 2013; Crowley et al. 2014; Phillippi et al. 2014; Odet et al. 2015; Crowley et al. 2015; Morgan et al. 2016; Percival et al. 2016; Shorter et al. 2017; Oreper et al. 2017; Maurizio et al. 2018).

A wide distribution of litter sizes was observed, ranging from an average of 3.6 weaned pups for WSB\u00d7WSB crosses, to an average of 9.1 weaned pups for NOD\u00d7PWK crosses, with an overall mean of 5.5 weaned pups per litter. Examining average litter sizes of the inbred strains across all 4 years, we found neglible evidence of consistent seasonal effects (F11,2283=1.272\nP = 0.23) (Figure S4) but positive evidence of non-seasonal patterns: a modeled \u2018year.month\u2019 covariate significantly affected litter size (F47,2247=2.44\nP < 0.0001; see also Figure S5). The non-seasonal effect could be driven by the relocation of mice between vivariums, which occurred in February 2010. The housing facility may have an impact on litter size as well. To test this, we measured average litter size differences between the two housing facilities and found that two founder strains, 129S1 and WSB, had significantly larger average litter sizes at the Hillsborough facility than at UNC GMB with a difference of 5.87 to 4.42 weaned pups per litter (P < 0.0001) for 129S1, and 3.84 to 3.42 weaned pups per litter (P = 0.029) for WSB. The six other founder strains did not significantly differ in their average litter sizes between the two facilities, but tended to have smaller weaned litters at UNC GMB (see Discussion). For average litter size across the diallel, we tested for an effect of litter number (birth parity number, for a given mating pair) on the number of pups weaned in each litter. Previous research suggests that the first litter can be significantly smaller than subsequent litters due to various biological factors (De la Fuente and San Primitivo 1985). This effect was consistent in the diallel: we observed that there was significant reduction in litter size in the first litter (P < 0.0001) compared to the overall linear effect that parity has on reducing litter size (Figure S5).",

We note that litter size is a component of reproductive performance, but distinct from total strain productivity; a study on total strain productivity would need to take into account litter size, numbers of litters, maximum reproductive age, and pup survival until breeding. Our results illustrate how mammalian litter size in a full diallel design is influenced by genotypic and environmental variation. These results present new information on CC founder strains\u2019 reproductive performance, show that maternal effects and the environment play a large role in litter size variation, and provide no evidence for seasonality effects on litter size in a controlled animal facility. The results also address some of the factors that contributed to line extinction and breeding problems in generating the CC (Chesler et al. 2008; Philip et al. 2011; Collaborative Cross Consortium 2012; Shorter et al. 2017).",

The breeding of this diallel was performed across two different vivariums over the course of 4 years, and we see a significant effect from housing facility. The Hillsborough facility was associated with larger litters for all strains, especially 129S1 and WSB. The two facilities have many different factors that could explain these differences. The Hillsborough facility housed multiple species, including dogs and mice, had smaller rooms that held approximately 300 mouse cages, was remotely located in a rural area, had different laboratory personnel, had cage changes once a week, and was supplied with filtered well water. The diallel breeding at the GMB facility took place in a large central room, contained only laboratory mice, is located in a basement of a large seven story research building on campus, has cage changes every other week, and is supplied with filtered city water. It is possible that one or more of these factors, independently or in combination, affected productivity. Another finding was that seasonality, which has previously been shown to influence litter size and frequency of litters in mammals (Drickamer 1990), did not seem to significantly impact litter size in this study. This is likely due to consistent light-dark cycles and temperatures as well as a steady diet. We did observe a significant effect on litter size after the transfer of the mice to the UNC GMB facility (February 2010), which reduced overall litter sizes from March to June 2010. This may have been due to the use of Fenbendazole during the time of the transfer. Other factors, such as the sex of the laboratory personnel interacting with the animals, are generally known to influence rodent behavior and could contribute to some of the environmentally-induced variation we observed (Sorge et al. 2014).",

In the original BayesDiallel model, maternal and paternal strain effects are split into \u201cadditive\u201d effects, which consolidates the effects they have in common, and \u201cparental sex\u201d, which models any remaining deviation between the two. Recognizing that additive effects from the sire are essentially wiped out by the additive effects, we instead collapsed the additive and parental-sex effects into \u201cdam.strain\u201d and \u201csire.strain\u201d effects in a post-processing step on the posterior output.

Litter size, as measured, is most naturally distributed as Poisson, with zero-truncation owing to the fact that only successful litters were recorded. Sex ratio is most naturally modeled as a binomial, with an underlying (male) proportion between 0 and 1. Although it would be possible to obtain an approximate analysis by transformations to normality using the original BayesDiallel (and we do this for litter size for some otherwise hard-to-obtain quantities), we found such approximations to be inadequate for reliable estimation of higher order effects in the case of litter size and deeply flawed in the case of sex ratio. Although there is a computational cost, and added complexity to determining variance contributions, this new implementation achieves several objectives: 1) we no longer break the assumptions in the original model regarding normally distributed errors; 2) we easily accommodate overdispersion in our data; and 3) we can select from a large number of GLMMs models that more closely resemble the forms of our data observations. In addition, we believe this flexibility will be appealing to many other researchers who would like to model non-Gaussian distributed phenotypes using diallel designs, and we have provided the code in an R package litterDiallel (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2580307).",
