As shown in Fig. 1, the basic principle of RT-LAMP involves the use of specific primers, with a forward inner primer (FIP) and backward inner primer (BIP) that are designed to contain a SNP nucleotide at the 5\u2032 terminus, each reaction including two common primers (F3 and B3) and two specific primers (FIP-G and BIP-G for G allele and FIP-A and BIP-A for A allele). The structures of the LAMP primers and products based on this study are presented in Fig. 1, and the information regarding the primer names and sequences are provided in Table 1. The target SNP was characterized using six different regions (F1/F1c-F3/F3c and B1/B1c-B3/B3c) specifically designed to recognize distinct regions on the target gene, which were designed to ensure that the primers would specifically amplify the G681A and G636A substitutions. The results depicted in Fig. 2 illustrate that the RT-LAMP method could accurately detect and discriminate all possible homozygotes and heterozygotes of CYP2C19*2 (G681A) and CYP2C19*3 (G636A) SNPs.",

To help overcome this difficulty, the target SNP is characterized using six different primer regions specifically designed to recognize eight distinct regions on the target gene1430. In this work, by adding or subtracting a few nucleotides in the primer regions, the Tm value and GC content were calculated until the six different primer regions were suitable for the LAMP reaction. As a result, the primer regions were selected as noted in Fig. 1 (F1-F3 and B1-B3). Furthermore, as the arrangement and composition of human genomic DNA is very complex, sequence alignment was necessary to avoid false recognition of the specific site. Thus, Primer-BLAST software (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast) was used to ensure that the chosen primer regions were specific to the target SNP, which helped avoid mismatches and locate the target SNP as accurately as possible.",

Hence, the inner primers were designed (Fig. 1) to minimize the impact of the secondary structure given that the inner primers are the main component for DNA strand extension. Moreover, according to Tomita et al., the formation of a starting structure is the key initiating step of LAMP11. Specific nucleotides were added to the 5\u2032 termini (5\u2032-term) of the FIP and BIP primers to establish a complete and effective starting structure, as shown in Fig. 1. Consequently the starting structure would be successfully established only when the 5\u2032-term nucleotide was exactly matched with the target SNP (Fig. 1A). Otherwise, the starting structure was blocked, as shown in Fig. 1C, and the amplification could not proceed. In conclusion, non-specific amplification was effectively suppressed in this work through special primer design and accurate target location. In addition, using real-time fluorescence detection equipment, amplification and detection can be performed in a closed tube, which could reduce the risk of contamination.",

Moreover, a standard curve with a high correlation coefficient was obtained in this study, as shown in Fig. 3B, indicating that except for microorganism quantification323334, the RT-LAMP assay can also be applied in human DNA quantification. Therefore, the RT-LAMP method can be used for the determination of trace amounts of DNA of interest among copious background DNA, such as specific mutation detection in circulating tumour DNA2435, and can be applied for complex gene quantification, which is clinically meaningful3637.",
