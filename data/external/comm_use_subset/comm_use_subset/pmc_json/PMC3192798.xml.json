Single daily doses of rIFN\u03b1 or rIFN\u03b3 rescued mice from lethality when administered 1\u20132 days after virus challenge and reduced lung virus titers. Both vaccinia keratitis and vaccinia-induced skin lesions were treated with rIFN (topically and injected respectively) in monkey models with success [10], [11]. Vaccinia and other poxviruses have evolved comprehensive mechanisms to antagonize the interferon system [12], that include blocking IFN gene induction, disrupting extracellular and intracellular signaling and slowing IFN induced gene (PKR and 2\u20325\u2032 OAS) activation. Treatment with exogenous rIFN only compensates for host IFN gene suppression and swamping the IFN binding protein so it must begin early after infection before the virus suppresses activation of the antiviral state. Interferon has a short half-life of three hours [13], which requires frequent treatment with large bolus doses resulting in commensurate adverse effects often leading to patient-initiated cessation of treatment [14], [15]. Pegylated rIFN has improved the in vivo half-life to allow for weekly injections, but results in a reduced activity of the protein and an increased cost.",

To this end, a replication-deficient adenovirus 5 (Ad5) vector containing the human consensus interferon alpha gene, referred to as DEF201, has been developed. Intranasal administration of DEF201 allows for the Ad5 vector to infect respiratory cells and drives constitutive expression of the IFN transgene and secretion of fully glycosylated IFN. Ad5-vectored mouse interferon (mDEF201) resulted in sustained IFN levels [16], that completely protected mice from a lethal Western equine encephalitis virus infection when given intramuscularly at 107 plaque forming units (PFU)/mouse up to 7 days prior to virus challenge [16]. Against Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus infection, mDEF201 prevented death when administered intramuscularly at 107 PFU/mouse 24 h prior to infection but not when given 6 h after infection [17]. Intranasally-administered mDEF201 was also used to treat mice infected intranasally with SARS virus (resulting in a lethal respiratory infection) [18]. It was 100% protective when administered prophylactically at 106 PFU/mouse up to 14 days pre-virus exposure, with similar protection afforded by a 108 dose administered therapeutically at 12 h after infection [18].",

This protective effect can be attributed to the mIFN transgene because the empty adenovirus vector was not protective and produced similar complete mortality as the placebo control. Cidofovir (positive control compound) was also 100% protective at 100 mg/kg/day when administered by intraperitoneal route starting 1 day post-infection. Table 1 also shows the effects of treatment with mDEF201 and cidofovir on lung infection parameters. A dose-responsive effect on lung virus titer was seen with mDEF201 treatments, with the highest dose causing nearly an 800-fold reduction in lung virus titer. mDEF201 doses of 105 and 106 PFU/mouse reduced virus titers 8- and 125-fold, respectively. All three mDEF201 treatments significantly reduced lung weights and lung hemorrhage scores. In contrast, cidofovir treatment caused a only a 40-fold reduction in virus titer, and protected lungs from virus-induced pathology. Lung virus titers and lung weights were also intermediate between the 105 and 106 mDEF201 dosage groups. Neither the control, nor adenovirus empty vector inhibited lung infection parameters.",

Mean body weights during the course of the primary infection are presented in Figure 1A. All of the treatments with mDEF201 largely protected the animals against weight loss. A slight drop in weight occurred on day 1 following intranasal exposure to virus, but the mice were back to the initial starting weight by day 3. Seven placebo-treated animals survived the infection, differing from that of Table 1 where no animals survived. This likely occurred because the mice at the time of infection were 28 days older, and susceptibility of the animals to infection diminishes with age. Severe weight loss in the placebo group persisted until day 11 of the infection. After that time, the seven animals that survived the infection began to recover body weight.",

Questions such as how much interferon is produced, how long is it produced, and what cells are responsible for producing it are being asked and are currently under investigation. It has already been shown that interferon is successfully produced by the vector when administered intramuscularly to mice and the protein is detectable in the serum [16]. From that work we also know that the levels of interferon rise very quickly (within 3-5 h), are transiently high, and come down within several days. We can infer that the interferon protein will be delivered successfully to the lung and nostrils (and have since confirmed this in a separate study, unpublished). Given that the protection lasts longer than the previously measured levels of interferon protein persist, we assume that the interferon is activating an immunological cascade that then protects the animal from infection by inducing an antiviral state. Thorough investigation of induced genes, length of induction, and localization of induction are planned, but are beyond the scope of this study.",

Intranasal delivery is also less invasive and easier to administer to large numbers of patients in the event of a mass infection due to a natural outbreak or intentional release. Adenovirus was selected to be the vector for interferon due to its rapid infectivity, breadth of human safety data, and facility of intranasal administration. mDEF201, administered by intranasal route, has already been shown to be effective in the treatment of SARS coronavirus respiratory infections in mice [18]. This is the first description of adenoviral vectored interferon alpha being used, by any route, to prevent or treat vaccinia virus infections.",

            "text": "A limited therapeutic window of time exists for treating vaccinia virus infections with interferon-based drugs like mDEF201, and to achieve treatment higher doses of mDEF201 are needed than for prophylaxis. Indeed, low dose mDEF201 (105\u2013106 PFU/mouse) that were effective prophylactically were not effective when administered even 6 h after infection. Higher doses (108 PFU/mouse) were required for full protection from lethality when given at +24 h, however considerable body weight loss resulted due to infection (Figure 3). The single 108 dose administered at 24 h was not as effective as daily doses of 100 mg/kg of cidofovir that acts directly on vaccinia to inhibit replication. This may be due in part to the lag time between administration of mDEF201 and the production of therapeutic levels of IFN within 6 h [15]. Secondly, in situ produced IFN must overcome a high level of IFN system down regulation caused by the established vaccinia infection [12]. It has been demonstrated by other investigators that both mDEF201 and DEF201 are effective as a treatment only when given within 1\u20132 days after virus exposure [16], [17], [18], [19]. How well Ad-vectored IFN protects infected animals will depend upon each virus' virulence including the number and expression of different IFN system antagonists. However, the treatment efficacy of DEF201 in these unrelated viruses indicates real potential as a broad spectrum antiviral, and the extrapolation of these treatment windows into the clinical scenario may be significant.",
