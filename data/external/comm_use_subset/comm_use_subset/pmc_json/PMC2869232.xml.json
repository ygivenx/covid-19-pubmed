The analyses based on the Markov model and dynamical language model without sequence alignment using 103 prokaryotes and 6 eukaryotes have yielded trees separating the three domains of life, Archaea, Eubacteria and Eukarya, with the relationships among the taxa consistent with those based on traditional analyses [5,11]. These two methods were also used to analyze the complete chloroplast genomes [5,12]. The SVD method was used to analyze mitochondrial genomes of 64 selected vertebrates [19]. A correlation-distance method without removing the random background (similar to [7]) was used to analyze rRNA gene sequences as DNA barcodes [20].",

A drawback is that these correlation-related distances are not proper distance metrics in the strict mathematical sense (Professor Bailin Hao, personal communication, 2009; see also [21]). There are some ways to overcome this problem. One way is to change the concept of distance to that of dissimilarity proposed by Xu and Hao [15] in the Markov model approach. Another way is to replace a pseudo-distance by a proper distance metric, which requires that the results are not worsened from the biological point of view. In the first way, there is no widely accepted mathematical definition for the concept of dissimilarity or similarity. Chen et al. [22] defined a similarity metric, but unfortunately the sample correlation between two vectors in a vector space does not yield a proper similarity under their definition.",

Then a window of length K is used to slide through the sequences by shifting one position at a time to determine the frequencies of each of the N kinds of K-strings in this sequence. We define p(\u03b11\u03b12...\u03b1K) = n(\u03b11\u03b12...\u03b1K) / (L \u2013 K + 1) as the observed frequency of a K -string \u03b11\u03b12...\u03b1K, where n(\u03b11\u03b12...\u03b1K) is the number of times that \u03b11\u03b12...\u03b1K appears in this sequence.

Finally, we construct all trees using the neighbour-joining (NJ) method [24] in the software SplitsTree4 V4.10 [25] or in the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis software (MEGA 4) [26] based on the distance matrices.",

The mean value of X starts to approach zero at K = 6 or 7 if we use protein sequences from genome and at K = 11 or 12 if we use whole DNA sequence. The mean value of X being close to zero means that the value of p (from the sequence) is almost equal to value of q (from the model). Hence these K values are suitable for phylogeny reconstruction using our approach. This result is also confirmed later in this paper from a biological point of view.",

This result means that the two vectors Xu and Yu are identical. It is obvious that Dchord (Xu, Yu) = Dchord (Yu, Xu). Because the three chords constructed by the pairs Xu and Yu, Xu and Zu, Yu and Zu are the three edges of a triangle, and the sum of the lengths of any two edges of a triangle is larger or equal to the length of the third edge, the triangle inequality of the chord distance follows. Hence the chord distance is a proper distance metric in the strict mathematical sense. The chord distance Dchord (Xu, Yu) can be normalized by \nDchordnorm(Xu, Yu)=Dchord(Xu, Yu)/2. This distance is also called Cavalli-Sforza chord distance [27] or described on pp. 163\u2013166 of [28].

Some biological comparisons of this approach with the Markov model approach on Datasets 1 and 2 were given in [5]. Recently we found that wrong data of the Archaea Crenarchaeota bacterium Pyrobaculum aerophilum (Pyrae) from Dataset 1 was used in [5]. Using the right genome data, Pyrobaculum aerophilum (Pyrae) groups with the other Archaea Crenarchaeota bacteria correctly (when we use the amino acid sequences of all protein-coding genes from genomes and K = 6). After this correction, the resulting tree is better than the one in [11] from the biological point of view, with all firmicutes group together and the other branches are similar. For Dataset 2, we obtained two trees with the same topology to those using the dynamical language approach in [5] and the Markov model approach in [12] (also using the amino acid sequences of all protein-coding genes from genomes and K = 6). For Dataset 3, we reported in [32] a good tree in agreement with the current understanding of the phylogeny of vertebrates revealed by the traditional approaches using the dynamical language approach (based on the whole DNA sequences of genomes and K = 11). This tree is better than the one in [19] and the one obtained by the Markov model approach. Hence we just need to compare the best trees obtained by the dynamical language approach using the two proper distance metrics with the best trees obtained from the pseudo-distance in [5] based on the first three datasets. In 2009, Guyon et al. [31] compared four alignment free string distances for complete genome phylogeny using Dataset 4. We will compare our method in this paper with the results in [31] based on Dataset 4.",

            "text": "For Dataset 3, after comparing all the trees with the traditional classification of the 64 vertebrates (the traditional classification from the KEGG database is available under \u201cComplete Mitochondrial Genomes\u201d on http://www.genome.jp/kegg/genes.html)), we find that the whole DNA sequences give better results than those given by the amino acid sequences of all protein-coding genes from genomes and all protein-coding DNA sequences. We evaluated the dynamical language approach with the proposed distance metrics on the sequences of whole genomes for K = 6 to 13. We find the tree using the piecewise distance has the same topology as the tree using the old \u201cdistance\u201d for the same value of K, the tree using the chord distance has similar topology (a little bit better because Dasypus novemcinctus.(Dnov) is close to but does not remain in a branch of primates) to the tree using the old \u201cdistance\u201d for the same value of K. And the trees for K = 11 are the best. Hence we present the tree for K = 11 using the dynamical language approach with chord distance in Figure 4. The tree (Figure 4) generated is similar in topology to the tree obtained using the SVD method in the case K = 4 [19], and is also similar to a recently generated tree of 69 species [33], placing a vast majority of species into well-accepted groupings. As shown in Figure 4, our distance-based analysis shows that the mitochondrial genomes are separated into three major clusters. One group corresponds to mammals; one group corresponds to the fish; and the third one represents Archosauria (including birds and reptiles). The interrelationships among the mitochondrial genomes are roughly in agreement with the current understanding of the phylogeny of vertebrates revealed by the traditional approaches. For further biological discussion, one can refer to [32].",

[31] first reconstructed a reference tree using Maximum Likelihood (ML) method based on the large (LSU) and the small (SSU) ribosomal subunits sequences (i.e., the traditional alignment method). Then they compared the results using four alignment free string distances for complete genome phylogeny. The four distances are Maximum Significant Matches (MSM) distance, k-word (KW) distance (i.e., the Markov model in [11]), Average Common Substring (ACS) distance and Compression (ZL) distance. Guyon et al. [31] found the MSM distance out performs the other three distances and the KW cannot give good phylogenetic topology for the 62 alpha-proteobacteria (see Figure 3 in [31]). We tested our dynamical language approach with pseudo-distance in [5] and the two proper distances in this paper on Dataset 4. We found that amino acid sequences of all protein-coding genes from genomes give better results than those given by the whole DNA sequences and all protein-coding DNA sequences. We evaluated the dynamical language approach with pseudo-distance in [5] and the two proper distances in this paper on the amino acid sequences of all protein-coding genes from genomes for K = 3, 4, 5 and 6. We found the trees using the new distance metrics have the same topology as the trees using the old \u201cdistance\u201d for the same value of K, and the topology of trees for K = 5 and 6 are the same and the best. Here we present the tree for K = 6 using dynamical language approach with chord distance in Figure 5. As shown in Figure 5, all Rhizobiales (Bartonellaceae, Brucellaceae, Rhizobiaceae and Phyllobacteriaceae) (A), Rhizobiales (Bradyrhizobiaceae) (B), Rickettsiales (Rickettsiaceae and Anaplasmataceae) (C), Rhodospirillales (D), Sphingomonadales (E); Rhodobacterales (Rhodobacteraceae) (F) group into correct branches respectively. Even inside each lineage (groups A to F), our phylogentic topology is more similar to that of ML reference tree (the right side tree in Figure 1 of [31]) than that obtained by the MSM distance (the best result in [31]). After comparing our Figure 5 with the tree obtained using KW distance (i.e., the Markov model in [11]) (the tree in Figure 3 of [31]), our dynamical language model performs much better than the KW distance.",
