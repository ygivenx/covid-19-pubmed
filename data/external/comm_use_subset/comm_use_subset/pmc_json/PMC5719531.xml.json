            "text": "Neonatal calf diarrhea (NCD) is the principal cause of calf mortality affecting the livestock industry globally [1, 2]. Septicemia caused by E. coli is a common disease of neonatal calves which causes a severe diarrhea and mortalities. The disease has a complex pathology which is known to have a multiple etiological agent [2, 3]. Some of the pathogenic organisms which causes calf diarrhea includes bacteria, viruses, and protozoa [4]. Co-infection make control of the disease more complicated [2]. Many reports showed that E. coli is one of the cause of enteropathogenesis in early ages of calves [5]. The incidence of calf diarrhea in neonates is reported in several studies and revealed a prevalence of 15\u201320% and rate of mortality showed from 1.5 to 8% [6]. In addition, the frequent presence of non-specific clinical signs ae the main factors influencing targeted treatments [7]. Diagnostic methods such as ELISA and PCR showed a better degree of detecting during mixed infections [8] and strain based diagnosis is important in providing appropriate information for proper therapeutic applications and finally control of the disease [2]. Various studies showed that different bacterial infections specifically the enterotoxigenic, enteropathogenic, enteroinvasive, and enterohemorrhagic E. coli leads to calf colisepticemia and causes neonatal mortalities particularly in non-vaccinated calves and those which deprived of colostrum [9\u201311]. The presence of large cattle population in developing countries [12] and the frequent and persistence of neonatal mortality and morbidity due to calf diarrhea without knowing the root cause of infection attract our attention to conduct this study. In these study population, we have noticed a clinical symptom of early diarrhea and mortalities which is a typical symptom of calf colisepticemia. As explained above, there are many pathogens causing the disease but due to the budget limitations of the study to characterize all, we focused only on characterizing and estimating the prevalence of E. coli and its associated risk factors in Alage Dairy Farm, Southern Ethiopia.",

Citrate utilization test. This test was performed using simon citrate agar. Methyl red test: This test was performed to detect the production of sufficient acid during glucose fermentation. This was demonstrated through changing in color of methyl red indicator, which was added at the end of the incubation period and after the addition of five drops of indicator, there was the production of red color. Triple sugar iron agar test: Two reaction chambers within the medium tube was used: the slant (aerobic) and butt (anaerobic). Once this medium has been inoculated using straight wire on the slant and butt and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h, there was production of color change on the slant and butt. Indole test: This test was used to differentiate bacteria that are able to break down the amino acid tryptophan present in peptone water or in SIM agar to release indole. Indole was detected by kovac\u2019s reagent or Ehrlich\u2019s reagent. E. coli have characteristic of indole production.

However, prevalence showed male have relatively higher prevalence (11.11%) than female (7.6%). This relative variation is supported by Thickett et al. [26] who explained female calf have a better attention and more managed because owners believed to replace those cows leaving the herd. Moreover, good management and provision of adequate nutrition lowers diseases susceptibility [10]. In conclusion, the present study clearly showed the presence of colisepticemia at herd level in the study area with the overall prevalence of 8.1%. This prevalence suggested that the disease in the farm has a possible risk of transmission from infected to healthy animals and it is a major threat for the production and productivity of the dairy cows and sufficient chemotherapeutic approach is recommended for the treatment of E. coli infection to control the disease epidemics.",
