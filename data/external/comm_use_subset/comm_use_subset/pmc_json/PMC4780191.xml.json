The two molecules form a typical homodimer (Fig. 1a), which has been observed in the crystal structures of other CoV Mpros485253. Previous studies have demonstrated the existence of Mpro homodimer in solution which is also the only active form of the enzyme56575859, supporting the physiological relevance of structural findings. A structural comparison of protomer A in Mpro-N3 complex with that in apo enzyme (PDB ID: 3TLO; C. P. Chuck & K. B. Wong, unpublished work) revealed an overall architecture of three domains (Fig. 1b) in each protomer, a common feature among CoV Mpro structures. Domain I (residues 8\u2013100) and domain II (residues 101\u2013183) together form a chymotrypsin-like fold, and the substrate-binding site is located in a cleft formed between domain I and domain II. The catalytic dyad composed of Cys144 and His41 lies in the center of substrate-binding site. Domain III (residues 200\u2013303) of HCoV-NL63 Mpro is composed of a globular antiparallel \u03b1-helical cluster, a unique feature of CoV Mpro that is required for homodimer formation. Domain III is connected to domain II through a long loop region of 16 residues. X-ray data-processing and refinement statistics are included in Table 1.",

It then undergoes nucleophilic attack by the active site Cys of the enzyme, leading to the formation of a stable covalent bond (E-I). This step is governed by the inactivation rate constant, k3. Using a CoV consensus substrate reported previously484953, we first determined the values for Km and kcat of the apo enzyme of HCoV-NL63 Mpro, as 50.8 \u00b1 3.4 \u03bcM and 0.098 \u00b1 0.004 s\u22121, respectively (Table 2). Cross comparison with Mpros from other human CoVs revealed that the kinetic parameters of HCoV-NL63 Mpro is relatively close to those for SARS-CoV (Km = 129 \u00b1 7 \u03bcM, kcat = 0.14 \u00b1 0.01 s\u22121)49. Rather Km of HCoV-NL63 is higher than that for HCoV-229E, while its kcat is approximately ten fold larger than those for HCoV-229E and HCoV-HKU1. We then added inhibitor N3 to the kinetic assay of HCoV-NL63 Mpro, and calculated the Ki and k3 as 11.3 \u00b1 1.0 \u03bcM and 42.4 \u00b1 5.0 (10\u22123\u2219s\u22121), respectively (Table 2). Although the ki for HCoV-NL63 is higher compared with those for SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E, indicating a lower affinity of inhibitor N3 to the apo enzyme, its k3 is significantly larger, which strongly supports the ability of N3 to achieve mechanism-based irreversible inhibition against HCoV-NL63 Mpro.",

Since N3 binds to Protomer A and B similarly, we will only look into the binding mode of N3 in Protomer A below. C\u03b2 of vinyl group on inhibitor N3 forms a standard 1.8 \u00c5 covalent bond with the S\u03b3 atom of Cys144, as evidenced by clear electron density (Fig. 2b). This indicates that a Michael addition reaction occurred between N3 and the catalytic site Cys144. Compared with the apo enzyme, only one specific conformation is observed due to the formation of covalent bond while there exists a double conformation for S\u03b3 in the apo enzyme. The carbonyl oxygen of ester on N3 is very close to the backbone NH of Gly142 and the backbone of NH of Cys144 (Fig. 2c), which mimics the tetrahedral oxyanion intermediate state formed during serine protease cleavage and provides additional support to anchor the Michael acceptor. The benzyl ester part of N3 further extends into the S1\u2019 pocket, forming Van der Waals interaction with Val26 and Leu27 (Fig. 2b).",

This feature is unique only in genomes of HCoV-NL63 (NC_005831) and HCoV-HKU1 (NC_006577). In contrast, glutamine is the exclusive residue in P1 among all cleavage sites for the other four human CoVs, including HCoV-229E (NC_002645), HCoV-OC43 (NC_005147), SARS-CoV (NC_004718), and MERS-CoV (JX869059). Such novel substrate specificity at P1 in HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 implies unique structural feature of S1 subpocket. The crystal structure of HCoV-NL63 Mpro shows that the size of its S1 pocket is comparable to that of HCoV-HKU1, but smaller than those of HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV. Clearly, a smaller S1 pocket in HCoV-NL63 could better accommodate the smaller side chain of histidine residue at P1 of nsp13-nsp14, and facilitate cleavage when weakened oxyanion hole is formed.",

On the other hand, more variations are observed in the P2 position among betacoronaviruses, with more alternative residues such as methionine, phenylalanine, and proline, which might indicate less stringency of P2 specificity. The P2 site of inhibitor N3 mimics the side chain of leucine, in order to cover the maximum spectrum of natural Mpro substrates for human CoVs49. As observed in the HCoV-NL63 structure with N3, the aliphatic isobutyl side chain of P2 protrudes into the deep S2 pocket via interactions with the alkyl portion of the side chains of Asp187, Pro189, and is well accommodated onto the Van der Waals surface of the pocket (Fig. 2b).",

These strains were isolated from patient specimens dated back to the past three decades from several countries, including The Netherlands, United States, and China. High percentage of sequence variation among these clinically isolated HCoV-NL63 strains and evidence of in vivo recombination during co-infections with other CoVs have been documented, especially in the N-terminal domain of spike protein and nsp2/nsp3 region4460. In order to determine the efficacy of inhibitor N3 against sequence variation accumulated during the circulation of HCoV-NL63 in human population, we assessed the level of sequence and structural conservation in the molecular target of this inhibitor among different clinical isolates. Sequence for Mpro (nsp5) was retrieved from these HCoV-NL63 strains with available genomic sequences (Supplementary Table S1), and alignment was performed to determine sequence variations among these clinical isolates. Mpro sequence from strain Amsterdam I (NC_005831) was used as reference1644. Overall, Mpro is extremely conserved among clinical HCoV-NL63 strains isolated worldwide (Supplementary Fig. S1), evidencing the enzyme\u2019s essential role in viral replication. Sequence variation is only observed in 3 residues: His69 is mutated to Tyr in 13 strains isolated from United States, Cys221 is mutated to Arg among all the strains that have not been cultured in vitro, and Met235 is mutated to Ile in only one strain isolated in United States (Fig. 5a). When plotted onto the structure of HCoV-NL63 Mpro, these 3 residues are all located in flexible regions, such as loop and molecular surface (Fig. 5b). None of the 3 residues are directly interacting with inhibitor N3, which provides clear structural evidence to support the effectiveness of N3 against all the clinical strains of HCoV-NL63, in spite of significant genomic sequence variation and potential for recombination in viral transmission.",

Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cause severe respiratory syndrome with high mortality rate101415. In addition, four more human CoVs, namely HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-OC43, have been identified as pathological agents for common cold91617. The lack of effective therapeutic and preventive strategies against human CoVs calls for immediate action of the scientific community950. We previously demonstrated that designing wide spectrum inhibitor at a conservative target is a viable method to develop anti-CoV therapeutics, given the high mutation and recombination rates observed in viral replication48495153. The ability of CoV to cross animal-human boundary provides further support to our strategy. Indeed, several human CoVs, including HCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, have been linked to zoonotic CoVs which naturally infect hosts such as bats or dromedary camels20212223242546. In current study, we use the Mpro from HCoV-NL63 as our model molecule, and present its crystal structure in complex with an inhibitor. Based on the structural detail at 2.85 \u00c5 resolution, the substrate-binding pocket of HCoV-NL63 Mpro is conserved among three pairs of human and zoonotic CoVs (Fig. 6). Several key residues at the subsites for substrate binding are completely identical among these seven coronaviruses, for example Phe139, His163, Glu166, His172 of S1; His41, Tyr53, Asp187 of S2; and Leu167, Gln192 of S4. These findings are consistent with the role of Mpro in viral replication, which is essential to the proteolytic processing and maturation of replicase polyprotein (encoded by ORF1). Analysis of substrate recognition sequence, based on available whole genome sequences of all six human CoVs, provides additional evidence to the conservation of Mpro substrate-binding pocket: the P1 position requires almost exclusively glutamine, and the P2 position exhibits strong preference for hydrophobic residues such as Leu and Val (Table 3). Taken together, through designing of wide spectrum inhibitors at a conservative site on Mpro, our study outlines a novel therapeutic approach of containing diseases caused by both existing and possible future emerging human CoVs.",

N3 is a synthetic peptidomimetic compound with Michael acceptor (Fig. 2a), which achieves mechanism-based enzyme inactivation through forming an irreversible covalent bond with Cys144 of catalytic dyad (Fig. 2b,c). The success of two serine protease inhibitors, telaprevir and boceprevir, in the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) has underscored the importance of covalent inhibitors for targeting viral proteases62. Both telaprevir and boceprevir are peptidomimetic inhibitors carry a warhead of \u03b1-ketoamide, which forms a covalent yet reversible bond with catalytic triad serine residue of HCV NS3\u22194 A protease6263. Michael acceptor has also been used as a warhead in pharmaceutical targeting against viral protease, for example rupintrivir was developed as an inhibitor for 3C protease of human rhinovirus and enterovirus506465. The backbone of N3 forms 7 hydrogen bonds with residues in the substrate-binding pocket (Fig. 2c). The pockets accommodating N3 undergo gate-regulated switch to facilitate the binding of inhibitor N3 (Fig. 3), an interesting phenomena initially observed in case of Mpro from SARS-CoV49.",

Examination of its natural cleavage sites based on HCoV-NL63 genomic sequence reveals an unusual histidine P1 residue between nsp13 and nsp14, which is unique to HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 among all human CoVs37. Such P1 anomaly is partially accommodated by the relatively smaller S1 pocket, as the size of its S1 pocket is comparable to that of HCoV-HKU1, but smaller than those of HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV. The P2 position seems to present genus specificity among alphacoronaviruses, as the P2 residues among all 11 natural cleavage sites are completely identical between HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E with a strong dominance of leucine. While large variation on P2 residue is observed in the genomes of human betacoronaviruses.",
