Phylogenetic analysis showed that this virus belonged to the genus Bocavirus (subfamily, Parvovirinae; family, Parvoviridae) and was most closely related to bovine parvovirus (BP) and minute virus of canines (MVC). The virus was thus named \"human bocavirus\" (HBoV).",

A great number of different PCR techniques employing varying sets of primers specific for the viral genes NP1[10], NS1 [11], and VP1, VP2 [12,13] have been described. In addition to the detection of viral genomes by PCR, recent reports describe the detection of HBoV-specific IgG and IgM-antibodies against HBoV VP2 in serum samples using western blot [14] or immunofluorescence assays [2,15]. Furthermore, a standardized ELISA for the quantitative determination of HBoV-specific antibodies has been established by [16]. The aim of the work was determination of HBoV in respiratory specimens (NPA) of infants by qualitative PCR and determination of acute HBoV infection by estimation of IgM antibodies in serum by ELISA.",

PCR detected four HBoV positive cases that were negative by ELISA, this could be explained by the high sensitivity of PCR over ELISA since it was (100% vs 81.1%) respectively. Weissbrich et al., [21] had found HBoV DNA in (10.3%) of NPA samples obtained from 786 hospitalized infants and children with febrile respiratory tract diseases during the years 2002 to 2005 in the region of northern Bavaria in Germany. While Neske et al., [22] had studied 834 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA), 10 serum samples, and 31 stool samples of children with acute respiratory diseases. For phylogenetic analysis, the VP2 genes were sequenced from 69 HBoV-positive NPA samples. The qualitative results of the real-time HBoV PCR were in good agreement with a conventional HBoV PCR. They found that 12% of the NPA were positive for HBoV DNA by both techniques.",
