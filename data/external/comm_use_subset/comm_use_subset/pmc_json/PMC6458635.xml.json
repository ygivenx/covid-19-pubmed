This family possesses single-stranded positive-strand RNA genomes contained in an nucleocapside, so PDCoV is an enveloped virus. Intestinal infections in pigs result in diarrhea, vomiting and dehydration and are highly lethal. In 2009, 17 cases of swine diarrhea were positive for PDCoV and were linked to the deltacoronavirus [1]. The virus appeared again in 2014 causing large-scale outbreaks of pig diarrhea in the United States [2]. A retrospective study in 2015 identified PDCoV from samples collected from four Chinese provinces between 2004 and 2014 indicated an infection rate of 6.5% [3]. Subsequently, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and the Philippines successively reported the existence of PDCoV [4, 5].",

At mid-infection, viral loads in all organs except the kidney reached a maximum for all three periods. The heart, spleen, kidney, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, mesenteric lymph nodes and tonsils were all positive for PDCoV.

The expression level of lncRNA is significantly up-regulated or down-regulated, and its target miRNA is down-regulated or up-regulated. The target gene expression level of miRNA is consistent with lncRNA. This suggests that there may be significant competitive RNA during infection.

This causes villus atrophy resulting in diarrhea, dehydration, vomiting and weight loss. Our results from target mRNA pathway analysis revealed that pre-challenge target mRNAs of lncRNA were enriched for the signaling pathway of glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, limonene and pinene degradation, chloroalkane and chloroalkene degradation as well as glycolysis / gluconeogenesis. During the middle stages of infection, limonene and pinene degradation, glycolysis / gluconeogenesis, ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, histidine metabolism signaling pathway were prominent and late-stage target mRNAs were primarily concentrated on histidine metabolism, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, beta-Alanine metabolism. It can be seen that some differentially expressed lncRNAs are related to the metabolism of organisms. The GO analysis indicated that at the middle stage of infection, these target genes were significantly enriched in the biological process category including regulation of activated T cell proliferation. Our future work will include determining lncRNA mechanisms of T cell activation and proliferation. This will assist in determining how the immune system is compromised by PDCoV infection in pigs.",

Interestingly, both lncRNA and mRNA in the ceRNA network were negatively correlated with miRNA. Previous studies have confirmed that ceRNAs can act as miRNA \u2018sponges\u2019 and this is especially important for cancer and tumor diseases [27, 28]. By analyzing the miRNAs in the ceRNA network we found that the target miRNAs ssc-miR-885-5p, ssc-miR-490-5p, ssc-miR-196b-5p and ssc-miR-133b of lncRNAs were all up regulated. MiR-885-5p is a direct regulator of the IGF1 receptor that in combination with p73 regulate emergence of aggressive cancer stem-like features [29]. Decreased expression of miR-133b is associated with poor survival and increased metastasis in colorectal cancer [30]. miR-490-5p inhibits cell proliferation, migration and invasion but miR-490-5p can promote apoptosis of Human hepatoma (Hep3B) cells by inhibiting Roundabout Guidance Receptor 1 (ROBO1) [31]. MiR-196b-5p overexpression may also be associated with a risk of conversion of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) [32]. The target miRNAs ssc-miR-194b-3p, ssc-miR-184, ssc-miR-215, ssc-miR-874 were all down regulated. miR-874 and miR-215 can act as a tumor suppressor [33, 34].

The primers were designed using Primer 5.0 software www.premierbiosoft.com (Table 2). One-step real-time RT-PCR reactions were performed using a One Step PrimeScript RT-PCR kit (Takara) on an ABI PRISM 7500 instrument. The following steps were used: reverse transcription at 42 \u00b0C for 10 min, denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 10 s and 40 cycles at 95 \u00b0C for 5 s, 55 \u00b0C for 20 s, 72 \u00b0C for 10 s and finally a melting curve. Each reaction was performed in triplicate. LncRNA expression levels were calculated based on the 2 -\u0394\u0394CT method [37]. Expression levels were normalized to those of GAPDH.",
