For instance, Syrian hamsters infected with mouse-adapted Ebola virus (EBOV) manifest many of the clinical and pathological findings observed in EBOV-infected non-human primates (NHPs) and humans, including systemic viral replication, suppression of the innate immune response, an uncontrolled inflammatory response, and disseminated intravascular coagulation syndrome [9]. The Syrian hamster is emerging as a promising model for leishmaniasis [10] and dyslipidaemia research [11], [12]. The Syrian hamster is also an important animal model in neurosciences research [13], [14]. For instance, this species has been widely used in the studies of circadian rhythms [15], cardiomyopathy [16], aggression [17], reproduction [18], and sensory systems [19].",

Preliminary gene annotation of the CHO cell genome was performed using vertebrate experimental data and cross-species comparisons. The current release of the CHO cell transcriptome comprises 121,636 transcript fragments representing a total length of 179,731,611 nucleotides. More recently, Lewis et al. compared the genome of CHO cells and the genome of the Chinese hamster obtained from tissues, and they showed a significant proximity between these different conditions [26].

Here we sequenced a normalized 3\u2032 mRNA fragment primed cDNA library produced from pooled RNA isolated from the major organs of adult female Syrian hamsters following strategies in common-use described elsewhere [27], [28]. We reasoned that pooling a large variety of different organs of animals will provide a large pool of mRNA fragments to sequence and annotate. Sequencing reads were de novo assembled into contigs. The combined contig and unassembled read (singleton) dataset, designated as the Syrian hamster transcriptome, was annotated based on the mouse and rat transcriptomes. We identified the most highly covered and the most highly expressed transcripts in our Syrian hamster transcriptome and performed a functional enrichment analysis to identify which canonical pathways and biological functions were most significantly represented. In order to contribute to the annotation efforts of the Chinese hamster species, we aligned our Syrian hamster transcriptome to the current version of the CHO cell genome and transcriptome. Finally, we aligned our Syrian hamster transcriptome to 14 other primate species and analyzed the genomic divergence of our transcripts in order to gain insights into the genomic evolution of the Syrian hamster.",

Among the most significantly enriched canonical pathways were several involved with protein synthesis, turnover, and antigen processing (protein ubiquitination, EIF2 signaling), metabolism and stress responses (mitochondrial dysfunction, NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response, PI3K/Akt, and mTOR signaling), and inflammatory and immune responses (production of NO and reactive oxygen species by macrophages, CXCR4 signaling, IL-1 signaling, and IL-3 signaling).

One hundred mg of hamster tissue was homogenized with a Qiagen TissueLyzer II (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) in 1 mL Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) following manufacturer's recommendations. To each aliquot 200 \u00b5L of 1-bromo-3-chloropropane (Sigma-Alrich) was added, the mixture was vortexed for 15 seconds and centrifuged at 4\u00b0C at 16,000x for 15 minutes. The aqueous phase was removed and passed through a Qiagen QiaShredder column to fragment remaining gDNA in the sample. The Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNA 96 method was then performed including on-column Dnase 1 treatment to obtain high quality RNA with no genomic DNA contamination (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA yield was determined by spectrophotometry (A260/A280) and RNA quality was determined using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).
