The main targets were proteins involved in coronaviral replication, proteases and ion channel conductance [22]. Only a few investigations have been performed to test the anti-IBV activity of plant extracts. Several studies have found that the plant preparations inhibited IBV replication in vivo and vitro. Sambucus nigra, Houttuynia cordata, Alium sativum and Astragalus mongholicus inhibited IBV replication [23\u201326]. The ethanol extract of Sambucus nigra inhibited IBV replication and reduced virus titres prior to infection [24], as did Houttuynia cordata essential oil mixed with an aqueous solution of sodium chloride solution [25]. It is suggested that the effect of extracts of, Alium sativum, Houttuynia cordata and Sambucus nigra can be associated with direct inactivation of envelope structures of a virus, which are necessary for adsorption to or entry into host cells, or might dissolute the IBV envelope. Compounds that have a virucidal effect work like a disinfectant and do not require replication to inactivate the virus [15]. The mechanism of action of Astragalus polysaccharides has not been explained.",

Eight out of 16 extracts \u2013 D. canadense, M. piperita, M. officinalis, O. vulgaris, T. vulgaris, H. officinalis, S. officinalis, and S. montana \u2013 were chosen based on the results of the antiviral effect assay. The first seven extracts mentioned above possessed significant anti-IBV activities prior to/during infection, and only S. montana had an antiviral effect prior to and post-infection. All extracts, except D. canadense, belong to the Lamiaceae family, members of which have been reported in many studies as showing antiviral activity [28\u201330]. So far, none of these plants has been studied for antiviral activity against IBV. However, several preparations of botanicals inhibit viral replication in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the results show that ethanol extract of Sambucus nigra inhibits viral replication and reduces virus titres prior to infection [24], as does Houttuynia cordata essential oil mixed with an aqueous solution of sodium chloride solution [25]. These results suggest that the effect of extracts can be associated with the direct inactivation of the envelope structures of a virus, which are necessary for adsorption to or entry into host cells, or might dissolute the IBV envelope. Thus, resistance to virucidal compounds due to mutations generated in the viral genome during replication is not likely [31].",

M. piperita essential oil has been found to be significantly effective against both HSV -1 [28] and HSV-2 when the viruses are treated with peppermint oil prior to adsorption, but not after penetration into the host cell [31].

Previous studies comparing the dried raw and fresh material of medicinal plants and different sample preparation methods have shown that drying and other conditions affect the qualitative and quantitative composition of the raw material [35, 36]. In many cases, drying is used as a standardised preparation of raw material of medicinal plants since it reduces water content and the risk of microbiological spoilage of raw material. In the present study, drying was used to collect all the samples of different plants during the intensive blooming vegetation phase for the simultaneous determination of biological activities, in consideration of the fact that different medicinal plants differ in dynamics of the accumulation of biologically active compounds, vegetation, and therefore in the harvesting of raw material [37].
