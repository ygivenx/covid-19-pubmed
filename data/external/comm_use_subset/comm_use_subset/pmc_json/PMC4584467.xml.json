The antiviral activity of interferons has been observed in diverse clinical studies showing a relative efficiency against different viral infections. In 1984, Limonta Vidal et al. [18] introduced the use of leukocyte interferon to treat children with dengue, showing a significant decrease in the number of complications and deaths when interferon was applied. However, the clinical use of interferon to treat dengue is not common, possibly due to IFN-\u03b1 side effects associated with its systemic activity. IFN- \u03bb is an attractive treatment alternative because it elicits a satisfactory antiviral activity with only a minor secondary response [19, 20]. Nevertheless, DENV has developed mechanisms to evade the immune response. Therefore, the precise analysis of IFN- \u03bb response during dengue infection is crucial to evaluate/predict its potential clinical uses in this disease.",

After DENV-2 replication in C33-A cells, viral titers in the supernatants at 48 h post-infection were quantified by lytic plaque assays in BHK-21 cells, meaning that infectious viral progeny was released from C33-A cells. Immunofluorescence analysis using a specific antibody against DENV pr-M protein (Fig. 2) confirmed that C33-A cells are permissive to DENV-2 infection.

DENV-2 infection significantly increases OAS1 mRNA but at earlier times, peaking at 6 h post-infection. However, the most striking effect was present with IFN-\u03bb1 pre-treatment followed by DENV-2 infection, that showed a pronounced increase in OAS1 expression from 6 to 18 h post-infection, at which time it peaked and then underwent a slow steady decrease, remaining high at 24 and 48 h. This result suggests that IFN-\u03bb1 decreases DENV-2 replication in part by viral mRNA degradation via RNase L. Moreover, stimulation of cells with IFN-\u03bb1 dramatically increases MX1 gene transcription, suggesting that the efficient activation of IFN-III signal transduction is useful in controlling DENV-2 infection. IFN-\u03bb1 treatment induced a bimodal MX1 increase with a first peak at 6 h post-infection and a second peak nearly 100-fold higher than basal at 24 h (Fig. 8b). Bimodality probably is due as a result of a first wave of activation by IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03bb1 and subsequently, the increase at 24 h could be by IFN-\u03bb2, which has demonstrated late induction, as well as by the late wave of endogenous interferons [22]. MX1 mRNA was detected at similar levels in infected and non-infected cells at all the studied times, suggesting that DENV induces an impairment in IFN signal transduction; however, this experiment cannot discriminate between IFN-I or IFN-III specific pathways. In cells pre-treated with IFN-\u03bb1 and then infected, MX1 mRNA increased between 18 and 48 h post-infection, although not as much as OAS1.",

Several studies have been conducted in cell lines and primary cell cultures to study IFN-\u03bb response [26]. In the present study we found that the C33-A cervical, epithelial cell line is permissive to DENV-2 infection and that this cell line both produces and responds to IFN-\u03bb. IL28R1, which is essential to support the antiviral action of IFN-\u03bb, is expressed in C33-A cells. IL28R1 expression is inducible under viral infections, concurrent with the expression of IFN-\u03bb [16]. Accordingly, IL28R1 expression increased during DENV-2 infection in C33-A cells, which could potentiate the effect of IFN-\u03bb signalling, leading to stimulation of gene transcription for the antiviral response and to inhibition of DENV-2 replication; as has been demonstrated for HCV, HIV and HBV infections [15, 27].",

Dose-response experiments showed that the IC50 values for IFN-\u03bb1 and IFN-\u03bb2 were 8.24 ng/ml and 8.705 ng/ml, respectively (Fig. 5). In view of these IC50 values, we tested whether an IFN- \u03bb concentration of 10 ng/ml, which produces optimal gene induction in other viral infections [28, 29], could induce the expression of antiviral response genes during dengue infection. In a study involving West Nile virus (WNV), another member of the Flaviviridae family, induction of IFN-\u03bb and JAK/STAT pathway activation was demonstrated in infected cells. IFN-\u03bb was able to prevent WNV infection of na\u00efve cells, but failed to inhibit viral replication in cells once infection had been established, likely due to IFN-\u03bb inhibition [30].",

These data suggest that dengue virus and the IFN-\u03bb treatment can active ISGs without type I IFNs. However, pre-treatment with IFN-\u03bb1 before dengue infection was not able to inhibit viral replication to the same degree in Vero as in C33-A cells, which shows that dengue virus can block activated signalling pathways that induce both type I and III interferons. Since viral titers did not decrease markedly with the highest IFN-\u03bb1 doses used, the data suggest that viral replication can be inhibited, albeit weakly, by endogenous and exogenous IFN-\u03bb1 in complete absence of IFN-I. Furthermore, the reduction in viral progeny observed with IFN-\u03bb1+ IFN-\u03b1, suggests that both interferons work synergistically. Importantly, the MX1 gene can be induced in Vero cells stimulated with recombinant type I interferon, thus demonstrating that although these cells don\u2019t produce IFN-I they respond to it [21, 31, 32].",
