Segment A harbors two open reading frames (ORF) coding the non-structural VP5 polypeptide, and the virus polyprotein, respectively [2]. The VP5 ORF overlaps the 5\u2032 end region of the polyprotein ORF, thus transcription of this segment results in the synthesis of bicistronic mRNA molecules. The mechanism(s) regulating the translation of both ORFs remains uncharacterized. Bioinformatics analyses indicate that the VP5 ORF originated by gene overprinting on an ancestral polyprotein gene [3]. The presence of VP5 orthologs only in genomes from viruses belonging to two, i.e. avibirnavirus and aquabirnavirus, of the four birnavirus genera suggests that this ORF was generated late during birnavirus evolution.",

This indicates that VP5 is a major IBDV virulence factor playing a key role in viral pathogenesis. Despite the enormous amount of work devoted to unravel molecular basis underlying IBDV pathogenesis our understanding about this critical issue is as yet scarce [11]. The IBDV protein arsenal is quite narrow, encompassing only five mature polypeptides (VP1-5). Although much effort has been focused on the characterization of structural polypeptides (VP1-3) and the virus-encoded protease (VP4), structural and functional data concerning VP5 is comparatively scarce. Indeed, an in depth knowledge about VP5 might provide new clues for the understanding of IBDV-host interactions.",

In a previous report we suggested the possibility that VP5 might behave as a type II transmembrane polypeptide [12], however bioinformatics analyses using updated algorithms argue against that option. We have experimentally examined the mechanism underlying the interaction of this polypeptide with the PM. Data presented in this report show that the polycationic VP5 C-terminal tail is essential for the PM targeting of this polypeptide. Additionally, we demonstrate that VP5 specifically binds different phosphoinositide (PIP) species, and that this interaction is mediated by its electropositive C-terminal tail. Finally, we show that VP5 is a key element on IBDV cell-to-cell dissemination, and that ablation of its C-terminal tail causes a significant plaque size reduction.",

Noteworthy, restriction of pRSETA with NdeI and BamHI removes the initiator ATG, the 6xhis tag, the Express epitope and the enterokinase cleavage recognition sequence from the plasmid. Accordingly, recombinant FVP5 genes were placed immediately downstream from the ribosome binding site, thus allowing the expression of recombinant proteins lacking heterologous N- or C-terminal sequences. The corresponding pRSETA derivatives were used to transform BL21(DE3)pLysS E. coli competent cells (Life Technologies). Recombinant protein expression was performed at 18\u00b0C for 16 h following supplier\u2032s instructions. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Igepal, 50 \u03bcg/ml lysozyme, and EDTA-free complete protease inhibitor cocktail from Roche). After 30 min at 37\u00b0C, samples were sonicated, supplemented with 5 units/ml of DNaseI, and MgSO4 to reach a final concentration of 10 mM, and further incubated for 15 min at 37\u00b0C. Thereafter, samples were subjected to centrifugation at 15,000xg for 15 min to eliminate large debris. Collected supernatants were subjected to a second round of centrifugation at 100,000xg for 1 h.

Purified protein samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.",

A less efficient binding to PI(4,5) bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) and PI(3,4,5) trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3) was also detected.

Indeed, data obtained from recombinant expression systems should be treated with some caution. It was therefore important to investigate the effect of mutations affecting the PIP-binding domain within the context of the IBDV infection. To perform this analysis, three IBDV mutants, namely IBDV_VP5\u03943CT, IBDV_VP5\u039410CT, and IBDV_VP5\u039414CT, expressing truncated versions of the VP5 polypeptides lacking 3, 10, and 14 VP5 C-terminal residues, respectively, were generated by reverse genetics (Fig 6A). The segment A of these three viruses contain a single nucleotide substitution A489\u2192U, A501\u2192U or A522\u2192U, respectively, that convert the \u201cAAA\u201d codons coding for VP5 K132 and K136, or the \u201cAAG\u201d codon coding for K142, into \u201cUAA\u201d or \u201cUAG\u201d translation termination codons. Noteworthy, these substitutions result in the introduction of synonymous mutations within the overlapping ORF, thus not altering the amino acid sequence of the virus polyprotein. Two additional viruses, i.e. wild type IBDV (IBDV_WT), expressing an unmodified VP5 version of the IBDV Soroa strain (WT), and IBDV VP5 knockout (IBDV_VP5 KO), were also generated by reverse genetics and used as controls for subsequent experiments. IBDV_VP5 KO contains a single nucleotide substitution, i.e. segment A: G98\u2192A, converting the VP5 \u201cAUG\u201d translation initiation codon into an \u201cAUA\u201d triplet, thus abolishing VP5 expression [8].

            "text": "The relative predominance of anionic lipid species at the inner PM leaflet provides this surface with an overall negative electrostatic environment that attracts proteins containing surface-exposed polycationic domains [27]. Indeed, electrostatic interactions between anionic lipids and surface exposed polycationic protein domains play a key role on the targeting of many proteins to the plasmalemma [24]. The presence of three positively charged clusters, 132KR133, 136KRR138 and 142RK143, within the C-terminal VP5 tail suggested that this region might be important for the interaction of this protein with the PM. Experiments performed with GFP/CT122-145, a GFP C-terminal fusion containing the 24 C-terminal VP5 residues, show that this region is sufficient to target GFP to the PM. Additionally, data gathered with recombinant Flag-tagged VP5 versions, harboring C-terminal deletions or amino acid substitutions, evidenced that the reduction of the net electropositive charge of the C-terminal domain either weaken or abolish the interaction of the protein with the PM. Identical effects were observed in cells infected with IBDV VP5 C-terminal ablation mutants generated by reverse genetics. Taken together these data demonstrates that the C-terminal domain is essential for the PM tropism of this protein, thus ruling out our previous hypothesis that VP5 might behave as a class II transmembrane polypeptide.",
