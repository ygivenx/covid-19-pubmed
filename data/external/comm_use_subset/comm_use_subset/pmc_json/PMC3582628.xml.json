The exponential growth rate, denoted by r, is defined by the per capita change in number of new cases per unit of time. As incidence data are integer valued, Poisson regression is indicated to estimate this parameter [6,10], rather than linear regression of the logged incidence. The reproduction number is computed as R=1M\u2212r where M is the moment generating function of the (discretized) generation time distribution.

The proposed algorithm, described in a Bayesian framework, starts with a non-informative prior on the distribution of the reproduction number R. The distribution is updated as new data is observed, using PR|N0,\u2026,Nt+1=PNt+1|R,N0,\u2026,NtPR|N0,\u2026,NtPN0,\u2026,Nt+1. In other words, the prior distribution for R used on each new day is the posterior distribution from the previous day. At each time, the mode of the posterior may be computed along with the highest probability density interval. As before, the method requires that the epidemic is in a period of exponential growth, i.e. it does not account for susceptible depletion; it implicitly uses an exponential distribution for the generation time; and assumes random mixing in the population.",

By default this is taken as the time period from first case to the date of maximum incidence. However, a better choice is possible using the deviance R-squared statistic over a range of possible time periods. The largest R-squared value corresponds to the period over which the model of analysis fitted the data best: we select this period to provide estimates. To look for this time period, the function \u2018sensitivity.analysis\u2019 systematically computes the deviance R-squared statistic over a range of time periods chosen by the user. A plot can be obtained that displays the largest R-squared value over time periods of increasing length (see Figure 2A), and the corresponding estimates can be displayed according to the chosen time window (Figure 2B). Here, this analysis shows that the portion of the epidemic curve that best fitted exponential growth in the EG method was of length 15, and more precisely in this case between time units 7 and 22. The estimate of the reproduction number was 1.56 [ 1.50 ; 1.62 ]. For a large choice of time windows, the estimates of the reproduction number remained within the 95%CI of the best fit, suggesting that the estimate was robust to change in the period of exponential growth. The estimates obtained using the best fitting time window for methods are reported in Table 1. Interestingly, when the \u201cbest fitting\u201d time period was used for the EG and ML method, the variability between estimates was reduced.",

Very small aggregation windows may lead to gaps, i.e. time periods with 0 observations. In this case, the SB method fails after the first gap (data not shown). Other methods are not affected, provided the maximum generation time is longer than the gap. When the data was aggregated in time periods up to twice the mean generation time, only the exponential growth method remained unbiased. Indeed, it has previously been reported that aggregation in time periods of 1 mean generation time width was ideal for estimation, and corrections proposed for larger time intervals [21]. The results obtained from the methods described here when data are aggregated in time periods larger than the mean generation time should therefore be interpreted with caution, all the more than the exponential growth assumption is unlikely to be met on long time periods.",

Therefore its use is generally limited to particular settings like schools or army platoons, for example [22]. All other methods require the epidemic curve and the generation time distribution, with the \u2018initial\u2019 reproduction ratio as an output.

The EG method was the least sensitive to changes in aggregation window, while the ML and TD methods were rapidly inconsistent. The SB method was generally not better than the EG method.
