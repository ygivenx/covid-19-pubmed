Conventional treatment of HSV-1 encephalitis (HSE) involves the use of antiviral therapies, current guidelines for the treatment of HSV-1 recommend intravenous acyclovir [2]. However, there is some evidence showing that modulation of inflammatory response may be beneficial [3]. In this regard, Kamei and coworkers [4] showed that higher proinflammatory cytokine levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from HSE patients were associated with a worse outcome of the disease and the decrease in cytokine levels after corticosteroid treatment resulted in a better outcome. Therefore the severity of the HSE depends at least in part on the inflammatory response [4].",

One of the characteristics of an inflammatory environment is the recruitment of leukocytes, which can pass through the blood\u2013brain barrier. The recruitment of leukocytes is composed of a series of events which are dependent on multiple protein interactions [5-7]. Intravital microscopy studies allow the visualization of leukocyte/endothelial cell interaction in vessels in vivo and have revealed that leukocytes must first tether and roll along the venular wall before they can attach firmly and emigrate out of the vasculature [8,9].",

CCL5/RANTES is a chemokine member of CC family that recruits monocytes, T cells, basophils and eosinophils, acting via the receptors CCR1, CCR3 and CCR5 [13]. Chemokines constitute a rapidly growing family of proteins and receptor-chemokine interactions are known to be promiscuous and redundant. For instance, CCR5 is a G-protein-coupled seven-transmembrane receptor expressed in different cell types like T cells, macrophages, dendritic cells and microglia, and that binds to several chemokines, including: CCL3 (MIP-1alpha/Macrophage Inflammatory Protein b-chemokine), CCL4 (MIP- 1beta), CCL5 (RANTES), CCL8 (MCP-2), CCL11 (eotaxin), CCL14 (HCC-1), CCL16 (HCC-4) [14]. Besides the CC family of chemokines, there is also the CXC family of chemokines, which is important in the chemotaxis of several immune cells. For example, Kc/CXCL-1 and MIG/CXCL9 are chemokines that attract neutrophils and T cell to the inflammatory site, respectively. Kc presents a chemotactic role similar to that played by the human CXCL8.",

The number of recruited neutrophils in the cornea became similar in WT and CCR5-/- mice only at day 7 p.i. Interestingly, there was increase in viral load in CCR5-/- mice at day 7 p.i. which was probably secondary to defective neutrophil trafficking during the earlier stages of infection.

However, in contrast with a previous work [22], CCR5-/- infected mice showed an increase of neutrophil recruitment in detriment of the CD4 and CD8 T cells recruitment in brain tissue. These conflicting results suggest that there is a significant difference between the immune response elicited in the periphery (i.e. cornea) and the response in the CNS in CCR5-/- mice infected with HSV-1. When the virus is inoculated in peripheral sites, such as cornea, an immune response against HSV-1 can develop in trigeminal ganglia and related lymph nodes. This response can modulate the immune response before HSV-1 reaches the CNS, differing from the current study in which the virus was directly inoculated in the brain. Previous studies involving other knock out mice have also demonstrated conflicting data depending on the route of HSV-1 inoculation. For instance, Lundberg and coworkers [29] demonstrated that TNF-\u03b1 antiviral effects are independent of TNFR1 in mice infected with HSV-1 by corneal scarification. When the virus was inoculated in the periphery of C57BL/6 mice, immune response of the host efficiently controlled virus infection even without TNFR1 [29]. Conversely, it was described a significant decrease in the survival rate of TNFR1\u2212/\u2212 mice infected by intracranial route [30]. The use of intracranial route is a way to elicit an immune response directly from the CNS, aiming to exclude immune activation in the periphery. In this regard, TNFR1 seemed to be relevant for the control of HSV-1 replication in CNS when there is no activation of the immune system in the periphery [30].",

CD8+ T lymphocytes are the first mononuclear cells that cross the blood brain barrier and move toward the infected tissue. The role played by CD8+ lymphocytes in HSV-1 encephalitis is still controversial. While one study reported no significant differences in viral load or viral reactivation when the virus was injected in cornea of mice lacking CD8+ T cells [33], another report showed persistent elevated viral titers in the brain of CD8-deficient, suggesting a role for CD8+ T cells in the control of HSV-1 replication [34]. In the current study, we found no difference in the levels of CD8+ lymphocytes in CCR5-/- mice, thus, these cells cannot account for the decrease in viral load in the brain of CCR5-/- mice. Following CD8+ T lymphocytes, tissue-penetrating Th1 CD4+ T cells contact local antigen presenting cells. This may result in an up-regulation of MHC molecules and secretion of more chemotactic molecules [35]. The inflammatory site during encephalitis involves the immune cells cited above and also B cells. Mice deficient for B cell had increased susceptibility to HSV-1 after peritoneal infection, presenting increased viral replication in the CNS. Thus, those results evidenced the importance of B cells in the control of viral replication.",

Using intravital microscopy, we found that CCR5-/- infected mice presented an increase of leukocyte adhesion to the pial microvasculature. Bearing in mind that CCR5 is one of the most important receptors in leukocyte migration, this result seems paradoxical. However, one limitation of this technique is the impossibility to identify the kind of leukocyte that roll and adhere in vessels [8].

Blocking the action of CCL5 receptor may result in compensatory mechanisms leading to the overproduction of other chemokines [37]. Thapa and coworkers [38] showed that mice deficient in CCR5 expressed higher levels of TNF-\u03b1, KC/CXCL1, MCP-1/CCL2, MIP1-\u03b1/CCL3 and RANTES/CCL5 in the brain after intravaginally HSV-2 infection. CCR5-/- mice showed a significant elevation in chemokines MCP-1/CCL2, RANTES/CCL5, MIG/CXCL9 and IP10/CXCL10 in the trigeminal ganglion and brainstem after ocular HSV-1 infection [22].",

This receptor is expressed predominantly on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, subsets of NK cells, and peripheral blood B cells. CXCR3-/- mice infected with HSV-1 in the cornea had an increase in CCL5, CXCL10, and IFN-\u03b3 in the brainstem and IL-6 in the brain tissue. In addition, CXCR3-/- infected mice exhibited high levels of chemokines which were coincident with high viral titers in the brainstem. The authors suggested that the absence of CXCR3 expression would suppress the capacity of T cells to respond to HSV-1 infection through limited trafficking to the trigeminal ganglia [39].",
