After translation of the viral mRNA-sense genomic RNA(s), the viral (+)RNA and the viral replication proteins together with host RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are recruited to the site of viral replication in membranous cellular compartments. Ultimately, the process leads to the assembly of the membrane-bound viral replicase complexes (VRCs), followed by the activation of the polymerase function of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and initiation of complementary RNA synthesis on the viral (+)RNA template [1]\u2013[4]. Subsequent (+)-strand synthesis in the VRCs takes place in an asymmetric manner, producing excess amounts of (+)-strand progeny, which is released from replication to participate in encapsidation, cell-to-cell movement and other viral processes.",

The membrane-bound tombusvirus VRC contains p33 and p92pol, and the tombusviral (+)repRNA, which serves both as a template and as a platform during VRC assembly and activation [16]\u2013[20]. Interestingly, the tombusvirus VRC contains at least seven host proteins as resident members, including glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, encoded by TDH2 and TDH3 in yeast) [21], the heat shock protein 70 chaperones (Hsp70, Ssa1/2p in yeast) [22]\u2013[25], pyruvate decarboxylase (Pdc1p) [25], Cdc34p E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme [26], eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) [27], [28], eEF1B\u03b3 [29], and Ded1p DEAD-box helicase [30]. The VRC also contains two temporary resident proteins, Pex19p shuttle protein [31] and the Vps23p adaptor ESCRT protein [28], [32], [33]. Detailed mechanistic studies revealed that the cellular Hsp70, eEF1A and Vps23p are involved in the assembly of the VRC, while the functions of host RBPs, such as eEF1A, eEF1B\u03b3, GAPDH and Ded1p, are to regulate viral RNA synthesis by the VRC [3], [21]\u2013[24], [29], [30], [34].",

These viruses likely recruit host helicases in order to facilitate viral replication. The best-characterized member of the helicase family involved in tombusvirus replication is the yeast Ded1p (the human DDX3-like) and the similar plant AtRH20 DEAD-box helicases, both of which promote (+)-strand synthesis [30]. Ded1p and AtRH20 bind to the 3\u2032-end of the TBSV minus-strand RNA, making the promoter sequence accessible to p92pol for initiation of (+)-strand RNA synthesis. Additional characterization of Ded1p and the similar yeast Dbp2p (similar to human p68) DEAD-box helicases revealed that these helicases play major and overlapping roles in (+)-strand synthesis [30], [49]. Altogether, the identification of 11 yeast RNA helicases involved in tombusvirus replication suggests that tombusviruses likely co-opt a number of host RNA helicases and these helicases might have a number of unique functions in viral replication.",

We show that these cellular helicases can locally unwind the double-stranded (ds) structure within the REN of the replication intermediate in vitro. These activities by the host helicases enhance in vitro replication and plus-strand RNA synthesis, and the accumulation of TBSV RNA in yeast and plants. We also demonstrate that AtRH2 and AtRH5 helicases work synergistically with the DDX3-like AtRH20 helicase (that binds to the 3\u2032 promoter sequence) to facilitate plus-strand synthesis in an asymmetric manner. Altogether, these co-opted host DEAD box helicases greatly enhance TBSV replication by interacting with the viral (\u2212)RNA and the replication proteins within the VRCs.",

These helicases were chosen from the 11 previously identified yeast helicases from several complementary high throughput screens using yeast and tombusviruses [26], [28], [35], [36], [38], [53], [54]. Overexpression of all 5 host RNA helicases increased TBSV accumulation, with the yeast Dbp3p showing the highest (over 2-fold increase) stimulation (Fig. S1A\u2013B). The overexpression of these host helicases did not affect the accumulation of p33 replication protein (Fig. S1A\u2013B), suggesting that the effects of this group of RNA helicases are not through increased translation of viral replication proteins. Altogether, the observed 30-to-140% increase in TBSV RNA accumulation due to overexpression of these yeast helicases is significant since overexpression of most yeast proteins nonspecifically reduces TBSV accumulation by 20\u201330% as demonstrated before based on individual overexpression of 5,500 yeast proteins [26], [54].

Overexpression of AtRH2 and AtRH5 stimulated (up to 3-fold increase) TBSV repRNA accumulation in yeast (Fig. 1A). The stimulation of tombusvirus accumulation (we used Cucumber necrosis virus, CNV, which is very closely related to TBSV) was also robust in Nicotiana benthamiana host plants when AtRH2 and AtRH5 RNA helicases were overexpressed (up to \u223c2-fold increase in tombusvirus genomic RNA accumulation, and \u223c6-fold increase in subgenomic RNA2 accumulation, Fig. 1B, lanes 1\u20134 and 9\u201312 versus 5\u20138), suggesting that these cellular helicases are important host factors. While overexpression of AtRH2 and AtRH5 did not affect the phenotype of uninoculated N. benthamiana plants, the tombusvirus-induced symptoms were intensified (Fig. 2) and the symptoms appeared faster (not shown), when compared with the control host plants not overexpressing the AtRH2 and AtRH5 helicases. Simultaneous co-overexpression of AtRH2 and AtRH5 increased tombusvirus replication by up to 2-fold (Fig. 1B, lanes 13\u201316), similar to the level obtained with individual overexpression of AtRH2 and AtRH5. Also, the symptoms induced by tombusvirus infection in plants with co-overexpression of AtRH2 and AtRH5 were comparable to those induced by the individual overexpression of AtRH2 and AtRH5 (Fig. 2). Therefore, it is likely that AtRH2 and AtRH5 play comparable and overlapping functions in tombusvirus replication. Overall, the host helicase overexpression studies in yeast and plant established that AtRH2 and AtRH5 helicases and the orthologous yeast Dbp3p and Fal1p helicases could support increased level of tombusvirus RNA replication in host cells.",

Therefore, we tested if recombinant AtRH2 and AtRH5 could unwind partial RNA duplexes, which are known to hinder RdRp-driven RNA synthesis [58], [59]. We chose partial duplex for this assay, because DEAD-box helicases are not processive enzymes and can only unwind short duplexes [40]. Interestingly, addition of purified AtRH2 and AtRH5 unwound the partial RNA duplex (Fig. 4B, lanes 1 and 2) and the yeast Dbp3p and Fal1p showed similar activities (lanes 7\u20138). In contrast, Ded1p and AtRH20 helicases did not efficiently unwind the RNA duplex formed only within the RIII(\u2212) REN (Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 6). The failure to unwind this partial duplex by Ded1p and AtRH20 is likely due to the preference of these helicases to bind the RI(\u2212) sequence of the tombusvirus RNA (Fig. 3) [30], [49]. Overall, the unwinding assay further supported that AtRH2, AtRH5 and the yeast Dbp3p and Fal1p have a novel pro-viral function during TBSV replication that is based on interaction with the RIII(\u2212) REN element.",

The CFE-based replication assay showed that (+)RNA synthesis decreased by \u223c2-fold when compared with the control CFE prepared from yeast with high level of Dbp3p and wt Fal1p (Fig. S4B, lane 4 versus 1). This is in contrast with (\u2212)RNA synthesis (represented by dsRNA product), which was unchanged when the CFE was prepared from dbp3\u0394/ts-fal1 yeast versus wt yeast.

Why is local unwinding of dsRNA within the RIII(\u2212) REN stimulatory for replication? We suggest that the locally opened RIII in the dsRNA form might allow the bridge sequence within the RIII(\u2212) REN to participate in a long-range base-pairing with the 3\u2032end of the (\u2212)RNA, thus bringing the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 terminal sequences of the (\u2212)RNA in close vicinity (Fig. 9).

            "text": "In summary, based on this and previous publications [21], [30], [49], the emerging picture with TBSV is that this virus utilizes co-opted RNA-binding host proteins to regulate asymmetric viral RNA replication. The recruited host proteins are needed for specific interactions with various cis-acting sequences in the viral (\u2212)RNA because the viral p33/p92 replication proteins bind to TBSV (\u2212)RNA nonspecifically [72]. We propose that, first, the recruited eIF4AIII-like RNA helicase proteins bind to RIII(\u2212) REN, while the DDX3-like AtRH20/Ded1p helicases bind to RI(\u2212) sequence. The interactions of two groups of helicases with the viral dsRNA likely opens up the 5\u2032 proximal RIII(\u2212) REN and the 3\u2032 terminal promoter region from the dsRNA structure present in the VRCs. Then, long-distance RNA-RNA interaction between the bridge sequence in the RIII(\u2212) REN and the 3\u2032 terminal sequence [57] could \u201ccircularize\u201d the (\u2212)RNA template and bring the p92 RdRp protein from the 5\u2032 end back to the 3\u2032 end for a new round of (+)-strand synthesis (Fig. 9). As proposed earlier [30], [49], an additional function of AtRH20/Ded1p is to further unwind local secondary structure within RI(\u2212) to promote the association of the cellular GAPDH with an AU-rich internal site and proper positioning of the GAPDH-p92 RdRp complex [73] over the (+)-strand initiation promoter, leading to robust (+)RNA synthesis. Therefore, we propose that the synergistic effect between the two groups of subverted helicases, host GAPDH and the viral p92pol might promote efficient recycling of the viral RdRp, resulting in multiple rounds of (+)RNA synthesis on the same dsRNA template (Fig. 9). This strategy could be beneficial for the virus by allowing asymmetric RNA synthesis on dsRNA templates, thus leading to excess amount of progeny (+)RNAs.",

However, HIV retrovirus, which also lacks viral-coded helicases, has been shown to recruit several cellular helicases, including DDX3, for various steps of its infection cycle [74]\u2013[76]. In addition, host DEAD-box helicases have been shown to affect virus infections, including translation of viral proteins [77]\u2013[79]; viral RNA replication [43], [80]\u2013[83]; subgenomic RNA synthesis [84]; reverse transcription [85]; virus assembly [86]; virus-mediated regulation of host gene transcription [87], and the activity of many anti-viral proteins [88]\u2013[90]. Therefore, the emerging picture is that RNA viruses subvert multiple members of the cellular RNA helicase family during infections.",

Briefly, the expression plasmids were transformed into E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) CodonPlus. Protein expression of the selected helicase proteins was induced by isopropyl-\u03b2-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 8 h at 23\u00b0C and in the case of viral proteins p33 and p92 at 16\u00b0C.

The CFE-based TBSV replication assays were performed in 20 \u00b5l total volume containing 2 \u00b5l of CFE, unlabeled 0.15 \u00b5g DI-72 (+)RNA or RI/II/IV (+)RNA transcripts, 200 ng purified MBP-p33, 200 ng purified MBP-p92pol and 200 ng purified MBP-tagged helicase proteins. The assays were performed as published [24], [63]. Fractionation of the assay products was done as follows: after 3 h of incubation at 25\u00b0C, reaction mixtures were centrifuged at 21,000\u00d7 g for 10 min to separate the \u201csoluble\u201d (supernatant) and \u201cmembrane\u201d (pellet) fraction. Then the membrane fraction was re-suspended in reaction buffer. Both fractions were then treated as separate samples during phenol/chlorophorm extraction, ethanol precipitation. The samples were dissolved in 1\u00d7RNA loading dye and analyzed by PAGE electrophoresis in 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 M urea with 0.5\u00d7 Tris-borate/EDTA buffer as described [24], [63]. For the detection of the 32P-labeled dsRNAs generated in the CFE assays, we prepared the RNA samples in 1\u00d7 RNA loading dye (containing 25% formamide), followed by dividing the samples into two equal fractions; one half was loaded on the gel without heat-treatment, while the other half was heat-treated for RNA denaturation at 85\u00b0C for 5 min and analyzed by PAGE [27].",

Namely, the eIF4AIII-like helicases unwind the dsRNA structure within the RIII(\u2212) REN, while the DDX3-like helicases open up the dsRNA structure within RI(\u2212) (as shown schematically). Long-range RNA-RNA interaction between the \u201cbridge\u201d and the cPR region (promoter sequence at the 3\u2032 end) in the (\u2212)RNA is proposed to lead to circularization of the viral (\u2212)RNA, which is still part of the dsRNA. This RNA structure is suggested to facilitate the transfer of the viral p92pol from the 5\u2032 end of the (\u2212)RNA [after completion of the (+)RNA strand synthesis in the previous round] back to the 3\u2032 cPR in the (\u2212)RNA for a new round of (+)RNA strand synthesis. Another co-opted cellular protein, GAPDH (called Tdh2/3 in yeast) is likely involved in this process by facilitating the binding of p92pol to the 3\u2032end of the (\u2212)RNA. Altogether, the re-use of the viral p92pol multiple times on the same (\u2212)RNA template could result in production of multiple (+)RNA progeny, resulting in the characteristic asymmetric viral RNA replication. Note that it is also possible that p92pol is standing still, while the RNA template is moved during RNA synthesis within the membrane-bound VRCs.",
