Fortunately, outbreaks of many such infections are geographically restricted, e.g. MERS coronavirus in the Middle East, Marburg filovirus in central and southern Africa, and Nipah henipavirus in south-east Asia. This restriction is most likely due to dependence on particular host reservoir species (single or multiple) for persistence in nature\u2013those hosts themselves having restricted distributions. Identification of the reservoir host and its geographic range are therefore essential for informed public health responses [2], dramatically illustrated by the 2014 outbreak of Zaire-Ebola virus that unexpectedly emerged in West Africa [3].",

            "text": "Repeated detection of a particular virus in a particular animal species, and not in other species in sympatry, usually implicates that species as the main reservoir. However, species with a wide geographic range are often (cryptically) genetically subdivided into subtaxa, yet it is rarely assessed whether a local intraspecific taxon may represent the reservoir instead of the entire species. Such associations between intraspecific animal taxa and particular viral taxa could explain why the distribution of some viruses appears smaller than the range of the reservoir species, for example in the case of distinct hantaviruses of the widespread rodent species Peromyscus leucopus [4, 5], P. maniculatus [4, 6, 7] and Oligoryzomys flavescens [8], and the Simian Immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) and Simian Foamy viruses (SFV) of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) [9\u201312]. However, it is difficult to corroborate these associations. Experimental infections require housing individuals of the particular subtaxa in biosafety laboratories, and will in any case reflect capacity of the virus to infect the host, rather than whether the host has a reservoir status in nature: whether an infection may be persistently transmitted in a particular host population depends on more factors than the ability to propagate in a host body after manual inoculation. For example, the route and timing of viral shedding in concordance with the host\u2019s population dynamics may be important determinants of the infection\u2019s invasion and persistence probabilities in a host population [13, 14]. Inferring subtaxon-virus associations from observations in nature may be more appropriate, but when spatial gaps or coinciding geographic barriers occur between sampling points of the distinct subtaxa, host-extrinsic factors such as isolation-by-distance or host movement barriers are indistinguishable as explanations of the spatial separation of viruses. Therefore, the association between virus and host taxa must be evaluated in areas where distinct host (sub)taxa carrying distinct viral taxa are in direct physical contact.",

            "text": "This situation can be found in secondary contact zones. These are formed when vicariant subtaxa that had allopatrically diverged in the past, re-expand into secondary contact during favourable environmental conditions [15]. Commonly, this contact results in the production of fertile hybrids across a delineated and stable hybrid zone [16]. These limited zones are often maintained by a balance between dispersal and (endogenous) selection against hybrids, so that distinctive genepools co-exist in the face of gene flow [17]. For example, using fine scale sampling across the European house mouse hybrid zone, it was demonstrated that strains of Murine cytomegalovirus and of the protozoan Cryptosporidium tyzzeri are each associated with a distinct Mus musculus subspecies [18, 19]. For RNA viruses, it might be expected such secondary contact zones provide the optimal ecological conditions for an evolutionary host shift to the closely related taxon across the zone, as even for host-specific RNA viruses their high mutation rates might ensure rapid adaptation to the exposed novel host. However, this has not yet been evaluated in nature. Host shift potential of RNA viruses has previously mainly been studied by comparing genealogical histories of virus phylogenetic groups and of their corresponding hosts [20\u201326]. This has allowed identification of e.g. phylogenetic distance between host taxa as an important constraint for a host shift; yet it remains unclear whether such a constraint may last when closely related subtaxa carrying different RNA viruses physically meet, for example at a secondary contact zone. Here, we characterize a secondary contact zone of subtaxa of the African rodent Mastomys natalensis to better understand host-imposed constraints to the distribution patterns of the rodent\u2019s arenaviruses.",

Only a few can successfully infect humans, and while human-to-human transmission is possible, it has so far never resulted in a sustained epidemic [27, 28]. Lassa mammarenavirus (LASV) may cause a severe haemorrhagic fever in humans, and with about 200,000 cases and 3,000 deaths annually [29] it has a major public health impact [30]. LASV\u2019s main natural reservoir host species is the Natal multimammate mouse Mastomys natalensis [31\u201333], although recently LASV and LASV-related strains have also been detected in other rodent species [34]. While this common rodent occurs throughout most of sub-Saharan Africa, LASV and Lassa fever in humans is restricted to West Africa and has never been detected east of Nigeria (Fig 1). Instead, five other arenaviruses have so far been detected from M. natalensis in various other regions (Fig 1): Mopeia virus (MOPV) in Mozambique [35], Morogoro virus (MORV\u2013a strain of MOPV) in Tanzania [36], Luna virus (LUV) in Zambia [37], Gairo virus (GAIV) in Tanzania [38] and recently an unnamed Mobala-like virus in east-Nigeria [39].

            "text": "M. natalensis is one of the most widespread and common mammals in sub-Saharan Africa; it occurs in all terrestrial habitats apart from dense forests and (semi-) deserts [54, 55]. Its mitochondrial DNA can be divided into six matrilineages that differ up to 3.8% at the cytochrome b gene and that are each geographically confined to distinct regions [43]. When superimposing the distributions of these matrilineages and M. natalensis-borne arenaviruses, each arenavirus seems to be restricted to the range of a single matrilineage, the Lassa fever endemic area roughly matching the range of M. natalensis matrilineage A-I (Fig 1). This pattern suggests that host intraspecific structure, as approximated by the matrilineal pattern, may constrain the geographic ranges of arenaviruses including LASV. Recently, Olayemi et al. (2016) concluded this is not the case, as they detected LASV in three M. natalensis individuals carrying the A-II mitochondrial lineage in eastern Nigeria. However, no nuclear markers were typed, and the A-II mitochondrial lineage was observed in less than 25% of the animals in the two localities where these LASV positive animals were detected, located at the edge of A-I matrilineage distribution. Moreover, a different and new arenavirus was found in an eastern locality across the river Niger where the A-II mitochondrial lineage was found in all individuals. Therefore, it remains unclear whether the observed pattern was due to LASV dispersal into the range of the host taxon associated with the A-II matrilineage, or due to A-II mitochondrial introgression into the range of the host taxon carrying LASV. Indeed, introgression of mitochondrial lineages into other taxa is a common phenomenon, therefore the spatial distribution of mitochondrial lineages often does not closely match that of the (multi-locus inferred) taxa themselves [56].",

We previously found within the B-V matrilineage range that nuclear markers are further substructured in relation to an urban-rural contrast, and that the region varies in landscape features that likely translate into spatially varying M. natalensis densities [57]. Such areas of low host densities and/or inter-host contacts might in themselves present a sufficient barrier for virus transmission [58], and should therefore be taken into account when distinguishing host-intrinsic and host-extrinsic factors of viral distribution patterns.",

For pools positive for this viral gene (and a subset of 347 negative samples), additional RNA was extracted from individual kidney biopsies preserved in RNAlater using the Nucleospin RNA II kit (Macherey-Nagel) when available. From these RNA extract parts of the GPC gene (979 nt or 234 nt) and NP gene (558 nt or 450 nt) were amplified. All amplicons were Sanger sequenced in both directions. See S1 Text for further details on these assays.",

In brief, ten field experts in M. natalensis ecology translated landscape elements of Tanzania\u2019s land cover layer of 1997 [67] to exponentially increasing categories of M. natalensis habitat quality. After integrating linear landscape elements into this habitat quality layer (rivers and roads of three different width categories), the resulting expert opinion layer was modelled using Circuitscape [68] as a conductive surface from which resistance values between pairs of polygons (minimum polygons drawn around sampling sites in each locality) are calculated, in analogy with circuit theory.",

The consistency across genomic compartments and the relatively narrow estimated cline widths (20.0, 21.0 and 21.6 km, respectively\u2013Fig 3) indicate a multilocus barrier to gene flow between the two M. natalensis subtaxa.

A partial mantel test correlating mean arenavirus (GAIV+MORV) genetic distance between pairwise localities to the landscape resistance, while partialing out the earth distance matrix, was not significant (R2 = -0.13, p = 0.95). Mantel tests (both simple and partial) lead to a high number of false-positive correlations [78], making this lack of correlation more striking. To summarise: away from the host contact zone landscape resistance is stronger than that within the zone, and even at its strongest, does not correlate with intraspecific arenavirus genetic substructure.",

This paves the way for experimental studies investigating what such factors might be. Candidate factors should include a wide range of possibilities from direct host immune defense differences to indirect effects, for example differences in infection-mediated behavior that enhance viral transmission. Interactions with other infections/symbionts should not be ignored: the host taxa may have, for example, diverged not only in their genomes but also in their gut microbiomes. It should also be borne in mind that host-intrinsic effects may be associated with hybrids, which can show vigorous immune response due to heterosis [88]. The combination of mechanisms involved is unlikely to be simple. For example, the configuration of \u03b1-dystroglycan, the (known) main cell entry receptor of Old-World mammarenaviruses is invariant across several species of the Mastomys genus [89], ruling this out as a simple explanation. Replicating relevant aspects of the population-level process of viral transmission in the laboratory will therefore be challenging.",

            "text": "As mentioned in the introduction, the human Lassa fever endemic area roughly matches the distribution range of M. natalensis A-I matrilineage, but recently, Olayemi et al. (2016) found LASV in three M. natalensis individuals carrying the A-II mitochondrion and concluded that LASV may spread to the rest of the A-II matrilineage range (which extends up to eastern Democratic Republic of Congo; Fig 1; [43]) [39]. However, the observations in Olayemi et al. (2016) actually appear consistent with the current study: 1) frequencies of matrilineages A-I and A-II (only mitochondria were typed) gradually changed along a west-east axis; 2) LASV and no other arenavirus was found in two localities where A-I predominated over A-II (1/9 and 2/9 genotyped animals carrying A-II, the remainder A-I); 3) a different, Mobala-like arenavirus, but not LASV, was found in localities where A-II mitochondrion predominates (A-II found in 3/3 genotyped animals, and lies east of a locality where A-II was found in 17/19 animals). As the authors note, M. natalensis subtaxa associated with A-I and A-II matrilineages thus likely form a hybrid zone in eastern Nigeria, potentially coinciding with the river Niger. Comparing these findings with our multilocus fine-scale data from Tanzania, we would predict that the locality where LASV was detected in three individuals with A-II mitochondria lies west of the hybrid zone\u2019s centre, across which these A-II mitochondrial copies have introgressed, as is common in contact zones [56] and as we also observed in this study. We would thus predict multilocus (not mitochondrial) genotyping would cluster those three individuals in the \u201cA-I subtaxon\u201d. The convergent spatial patterns in Olayemi et al. (2016) and this study are thus consistent with a general association of the arenaviruses of M. natalensis to particular subtaxa, implying that LASV is restricted to the West African range of the subtaxon corresponding with A-I matrilineage.",

This would explain why LASV is found in a wide array of species, including humans, but fails to explain why the distribution of LASV appears largely bordered by the distribution of M. natalensis A-I matrilineage. Therefore: (2) Do hosts other than M. natalensis A-I subtaxon contribute to the long-term persistence of LASV in nature?",

On the other hand, it is clear that these importations have not (yet) occurred very far outside of the M. natalensis A-I matrilineage range, despite the continuous distribution of M. erythroleucus, H. pamfi and of course humans through to other parts of Africa. It therefore seems that either: 1) M. erythroleucus and H. pamfi are not able to sustain a long-term persistent LASV transmission, similar to the situation in humans [27, 28]. Such less efficient transmission could e.g. be due to differences in intra-host infection dynamics and population ecology of these species in comparison to M. natalensis. 2) LASV is sustainably transmitted in M. erythroleucus and H. pamfi populations, and LASV\u2019s distribution in reality, and unnoticed, expands throughout the ranges of M. erythroleucus and H. pamfi (though note that at least M. erythroleucus is known to be subdivided into subtaxa similar to M. natalensis [91]). Perhaps they carry LASV strains less pathogenic to humans elsewhere; such a situation has previously been postulated to explain the absence of reported Lassa fever patients in regions in Mali where a particular LASV strain has only recently been found to be common in M. natalensis [32]. 3) LASV strains in M. erythroleucus and H. pamfi are the result of adaptive host switching events that occurred only recently, and have yet to expand through the rest of the rodents\u2019 ranges.",
