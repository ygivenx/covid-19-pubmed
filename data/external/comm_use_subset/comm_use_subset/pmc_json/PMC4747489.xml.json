            "text": "Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a gram-negative pathogenic \u03b2-proteobacterium, which usually appears as diplococci and is strictly limited to the human as host. It belongs to the genus Neisseria that also includes the human pathogen Neisseria meningitidis and several non-pathogenic species, e. g. Neisseria lactamica or Neisseria cinerea. N. gonorrhoeae is often abbreviated as gonococcus and is the causative agent of gonorrhoea, one of the most common sexually transmitted infections (STI) with an estimated number of 106 million new infections worldwide in 2012 [1]. It colonizes the urogenital epithelial cells and can shift to the upper genital tract which can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in women [2,3]. In rare cases, gonococcal infection can cause sterility in men and infertility in women as implications of PID [4]. Furthermore, recent studies mention that a gonococcal infection increases HIV transmission rates [5,6]. Given that around 80% of gonococcal infections in women [4] and to a lesser extent in men [7\u201310] are asymptomatic, treatment as well as diagnosis are hindered.",

Due to the pathogen\u2019s exceeding ability for DNA and gene uptake, it has been able to develop resistances to various formerly used antibiotic classes, e. g. sulfanilamides, penicillins, tetracyclines, and most recently fluoroquinolones [6,11,12], potentially leading to an evolution of a future \u201csuperbug\u201d. Lately, resistant strains against the last line of defence\u2014the cephalosporins such as ceftriaxone\u2014were isolated in different parts of the world [13\u201315]. Hence, a better understanding of N. gonorrhoeae infection and virulence could facilitate new treatments of gonorrhoea. Elucidation of novel immunogenic proteins could provide first indications of crucial proteins involved in gonococcal pathogenicity.",

Due to a multiplicity of evasion mechanisms to circumvent the immune response, e. g. antigenic variability of surface structure [16,17] as well as production of IgA1 proteases [18,19], there is only a minimal antibody generation detectable after infection. Furthermore, the immune response primarily occurs at the mucosal level that is not sustained leading to potentially high reinfection rates even with the same strain [15]. For these reasons, the development of a vaccine is complex and is not in immediate sight [10,12]. Nevertheless, by examination and determination of novel immunogenic proteins specific ways for treatment of N. gonorrhoeae could be possibly found, for instance, by inactivating virulence associated proteins preventing infection or by specifically disturbing essential cell processes.",

            "text": "On top of that, immunogenic proteins could be used for developing diagnostic tools as an easy-to-use system. State of the art in gonococcal diagnosis is the isolation and cultivation followed by gram stain to identify N. gonorrhoeae and to simultaneously screen for antibiotic resistances [4]. Drawbacks are long incubation times and insensitivity to asymptomatic infections [20]. Possible alternatives include nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), which have many advantages, e. g. easy specimen collection, insusceptible transportation, and time savings, but still have to be conducted by laboratory personnel and cannot distinguish between different antibiotic resistances [15,21]. Since a large number of infections occur asymptomatic and many people suffering from STIs feel ashamed to see a physician, it would be a great benefit to have an easy-to-use and inexpensive diagnostic tool such as a urine test strip to identify N. gonorrhoeae cells in urine. Due to antigenic variability and a limited knowledge, there is a lack of suitable proteins. Hence, these challenges might be overcome by identifying novel immunogenic proteins as targets for the development of detection methods or for vaccine research. Furthermore, the identified proteins might elucidate mechanisms of gonococcal infection. Commonly, the identification of immunogenic proteins is performed by 2D-PAGE and immunoblot followed by mass spectrometry [22\u201325], by time and labour consuming expression of the proteome and screening on nitrocellulose membranes [26], or recently by microarray technique [27\u201329]. However, all of these methods have certain disadvantages. Approaches with 2D-PAGE and expression libraries with cDNA have limitations in detecting differentially expressed proteins, e. g. in host-pathogen interaction, weakly expressed proteins or proteins with a molecular weight below 10 kDa [30\u201332]. Expression libraries of the complete proteome entail complex production and purification procedures. Furthermore, screenings of thousands of clones have to be accomplished. In contrast, phage display of antigens may avoid these limitations. Phage display technology was invented by George P. Smith thirty years ago [33]. This technology is mainly used for antibody selection [34\u201336] but has also been applied to identify immunogenic proteins from genomic and cDNA libraries [37].",

            "text": "In the pHORF approach, genomic libraries of pathogens are cloned in phagemids and packaged with Hyperphage [38,39] for ORF selection to improve the library quality [40]. Oligopeptides or protein domains are displayed on the surface of the M13 phage particles and the corresponding genetic information on the phagemid is packaged in the phage particles. Thus, the phenotype (protein fragments) is coupled with the genotype (corresponding gene fragments). By using polyclonal antibodies, patient or animal sera, immunogenic oligopeptides are selected in a panning procedure [41]. This technology allows for the discovery of immunogenic proteins independent from pathogen cultivation, thus also identifying proteins only expressed in the patient (in vivo host pathogen context) [37]. This method has been used successfully to identify a list of novel biomarkers from Salmonella Typhimurium and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae [41\u201343]. The technology was also used to identify biomarkers of ticks [44]. Compared to competing technologies like 2D-PAGE of proteins from cultivated pathogens followed by immunoblot using sera and mass spectrometry, the pHORF technology also allows identifying proteins expressed only in host-pathogen interaction and proteins smaller than 10 kDa. Other methods such as SEREX [45] working with lytic T7 phage or phage display systems also using M13 do not have a simple open reading frame enrichment to increase the library quality.",

Thirteen corresponding proteins were expressed in full-length and the immunogenic character of 11 thereof was verified. Six full-length proteins were identified as immunogenic for the first time; most of the remaining identified oligopeptides have been described in literature within the closely related pathogen Neisseria meningitidis. The immunogenic character of these proteins was validated for N. gonorrhoeae in this study. Furthermore, the proteins were modelled and the phage displayed oligopeptides were mapped to the obtained models, indicating those parts of the protein with higher immunogenic character.

            "text": "Several immunoproteome studies have been conducted to investigate immunogenic proteins of N. meningitidis [25,48,65,66], a human pathogen closely related to N. gonorrhoeae. Furthermore, reverse vaccinology has been applied to identify antigens from Neisseria strains included in effective outer membrane vesicle vaccines [47,49]. In contrast, immunoproteome studies of N. gonorrhoeae have not been available yet. In this work, we conducted an immunoproteomic approach to identify novel immunogenic proteins of N. gonorrhoeae. Due to low antibody titers in humans, no human sera are accessible. Hence, polyclonal rabbit antibodies to N. gonorrhoeae were applied for panning and screenings. The screening of a pHORF phage display library successfully yielded a number of previously unknown immunogenic proteins. Identification of novel immunogenic proteins might grant additional insight into their role in pathogenicity and virulence of N. gonorrhoeae. Furthermore, proteins involved in the pathogenic pathway might serve as potential candidates for therapeutic treatments.",

            "text": "Thirteen oligopeptides were produced as full-length proteins to validate their immunogenic character or to serve as a control. Six of those proteins had not been identified as immunogenic before and their immunogenic character was successfully validated by ELISA: NGO0170 is an ABC transporter ATP-binding protein that is involved in the transport of zinc/manganese. The localization is predicted to be in the cytoplasmic membrane. The phage displayed oligopeptide is located at the C-terminal end of the protein indicating the immunogenic part of the protein. The closest homologous structure identified by I-TASSER was a putative metal-chelate type ABC transporter of Haemophilus influenza [62] which occurs as hetero tetramer with two identical chains each. By comparing the query and aligned sequence, the oligopeptide identified by phage display was mapped to the part of the protein that is not embedded in the membrane (Fig 4G). Therefore, the identified oligopeptide is accessible by antibodies raised against it. On the other hand, it is most likely that the protein is facing inward to the cytoplasm hindering the accessibility of antibodies from the outside. However, localization and orientation are only predictions making it necessary to further investigate NGO0170. Interestingly, homologies on the amino acid level between NGO0170 (NMB0588) and an ORF of a potential pathogenicity island of E. coli have been described [67] underlining the possible influence of NGO0170 on the pathogenicity of N. gonorrhoeae. Furthermore, the homologue in N. meningitidis (NMB0588) was found to be upregulated at low zinc levels [68]. This condition often occurs during infection of the human host cells. A deletion mutant lacking NGO0170 could provide further information on the importance of this protein for the viability and virulence of N. gonorrhoeae. Depending on the impact, NGO0170 could be an attractive target for a novel therapeutic treatment for N. gonorrhoeae. NGO0326 is a highly conserved host factor-I binding protein abbreviated Hfq. Its function is the modulation of posttranscriptional regulation in stress response as a RNA chaperone. It is known to play a vital role in the virulence of different bacteria [69\u201371] including N. meningitidis [72]. Furthermore, it has been shown that a deletion of the homologue of NGO0326 in N. meningitidis leads to a differentiated expression of 369 ORFs [73]. This resulted in an altered bacterial growth rate and reduced adherence to epithelial cells. NGO0326 showed very high signal intensities in the range of the positive controls. Homologues of NGO0326 were shown to take a cyclic hexameric shape. The closest homologous structure identified by I-TASSER was the Hfq protein of L. monocytogenes [63]. Sequence coverage was 75%. However, the last 24 amino acids of the NGO0326 sequence were not covered by the closest structural homologue. The identified oligopeptide spanned precisely 35 of the last 39 amino acids at the C-terminal end of the protein, though. Hence, the larger part of the identified oligopeptide was not included by the predicted model and its homologous structures. Since NGO0326 is located in the cytoplasm, the oligopeptide should be accessible if the cell and membrane are disrupted. NGO0642 is annotated as a tRNA pseudouridine synthase B. It is responsible for the synthesis of pseudouridine utilized in tRNAs and is highly conserved in Neisseria species with 80%\u201396% identity. The closest structural homologue identified by I-TASSER was a tRNA pseudouridine synthase TruB from E. coli occurring as monomer [74]. The QMEAN score for quality estimation was 0.633 yielding in good model reliability.",

Nevertheless, no functional bacteriophages have been found in N. gonorrhoeae [4], although there are genomic regions that are related to lysogenic phage [78]. However, the region including NGO1634 is assumed to encode incomplete phage genomes. Hence, NGO1634 might be a protein of bacteriophage origin with a novel but yet unknown function in N. gonorrhoeae. BLAST results show a high identity of hits within N. gonorrhoeae strains, while only a few strains of other Neisseria species carry this gene. Future studies with monoclonal antibodies might reveal the precise localisation within the cell as well as the expression rate.

A possible explanation is that the epitope is inaccessible to the antibody within the full-length protein, while the shorter oligopeptide does not suffer from these limitations. Furthermore, if conformational epitopes are formed and recognised, it is highly possible that the secondary structure of truncated oligopeptide and full-length protein differ. Consequently, it is essential to validate the immunogenic character on full-length protein level. Apart from these newly described immunogenic proteins, this method revealed several other proteins that have been described in literature before, yet mainly in the closely related pathogen N. meningitidis and were verified to be immunogenic in N. gonorrhoeae as full-length proteins within this study: NGO1043 [51], NGO1656 [48] and NGO1852 [46].

Notably, the non-coding part included three stop codons and the immunogenic character was only validated for downstream NGO1656. Packaging with Hyperphage leads to an enrichment of open reading frames (ORF) [40]. Inserts with stop codons and out-of-frame arrangements are largely removed as infectious phage particles are only obtained if the coded sequence of insert and gIII is expressed as a full-length fusion protein. Since the insert also contained a start codon and signal peptide of NGO1656 according to SignalP (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP) it is most likely that only the sequence coding for NGO1656 was translated into a fusion protein with the phage coat protein pIII followed by periplasmic translocation in E. coli and phage assembly. Hence, the NGO1657 derived oligopeptide may not have been displayed on the selected phage clone and selection was due to the display of only NGO1656 explaining the full-length protein of NGO1657 to fail the proof of immunogenicity in ELISA. The homologue of NGO1656 in N. meningitidis (NMB0345) has been described to be immunogenic [53] and has been identified in outer membrane vesicles [49].",

Nevertheless, it was selected after the third panning round indicating that there could possibly be an antibody binding event.

This template was used for predicting the protein\u2019s quaternary structure. In case of multimeric quaternary structures, identified oligopeptides were also mapped to those template models to predict their accessibility for antibodies. The best models were checked for their quality with the QMEAN server. All models, except for NGO1634, had QMEAN scores of around 0.6 indicating acceptable modelling accuracy for function inference. For NGO1634, PSI-BLAST could not identify good homologues, resulting in low reliability of I-TASSER models confirmed by a low QMEAN score of 0.34.

After preincubation, the polyclonal antibody was incubated for 1.5 h in the wells coated with the goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody. 150 \u03bcL of the N. gonorrhoeae phage library (corresponding to 1.1 x 1010 cfu oligopeptide phage particles of the phage library) plus 50 \u03bcL MPBST were then incubated in the wells with the captured anti-N. gonorrhoeae antibodies for 2 h. 150 \u03bcL of amplified phage of the previous panning round were used for the second and third round. Unbound and phages with low affinities were rinsed out by ten stringent washing steps. Each panning round the washing steps were increased by ten with a total number of three panning rounds. After washing, bound phage particles were eluted by trypsination with 200 \u03bcL of 10 \u03bcg/mL trypsin in PBS for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. Eluted phages of both wells were combined and 10 \u03bcL were used for titration. The remaining 390 \u03bcL were used to infect 20 mL of an E. coli TOP10F\u2019 culture grown to an OD600 of 0.5. The cells were incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C and harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 3250 x g. The pellet was resuspended in 250 \u03bcL 2x YT-GA. The bacterial suspension was plated onto 15 cm 2x YT-GA agar plates and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. Colonies were swept off with 5 mL 2x YT-GA medium, then 50 mL of 2x YT-GA medium were inoculated with the bacterial suspension to an OD600 of < 0.1 and grown to an OD600 of 0.5 at 37\u00b0C and 250 rpm. 5 mL of the bacterial culture (approx. 2.5 x 109 cells) were infected in a ratio of 1:20 resulting in 5 x 1010 cfu Hyperphage. The suspension was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min without shaking and another 30 min at 37\u00b0C and 250 rpm. To dispose the glucose that inhibits phage expression, the infected cells were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 3250 x g. The remaining pellet was resuspended in 30 mL 2x YT-AK and incubated at 30\u00b0C and 250 rpm overnight for phage production. The bacterial cells were then pelleted by centrifugation for 20 min at 3250 x g and the remaining supernatant was used for phage particle precipitation with PEG/NaCl (20% (w/v) PEG 6000, 2.5 M NaCl). 30 mL of supernatant were incubated for 1 h with 6 mL PEG/NaCl on ice with slight shaking on a rocker, followed by centrifugation at 6000 x g for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. The phage pellet was resuspended in 500 \u03bcL phage dilution buffer (10 mM TrisHCl pH 7.5, 20 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA), centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 16,100 x g for 1 min and the supernatant was used for further panning rounds. Eluted phage particles from the third panning round were not further amplified and used for titration. Single colonies were then used for single oligopeptide phage production.",
