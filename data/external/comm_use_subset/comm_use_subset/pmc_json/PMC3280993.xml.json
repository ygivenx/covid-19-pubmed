            "text": "Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is an extremely contagious, multi-organ systemic disease [1]. One among multiple subtypes of influenza virus A, H5N1 viruses have caused 520 laboratory-confirmed infections in 15 countries, 307 of which were fatal, resulting in a fatality rate of approximately 60% since 2003 [2], which should be considered to have been a potentially serious pandemic threat [3]. Clinical observations indicated that acute lung injury and multiple organ dysfunction were the direct causes of death in H5N1-infected humans [4]\u2013[5]. Laboratory findings revealed low peripheral blood T-lymphocyte counts and high chemokine and cytokine levels in H5N1-infected individuals, particularly in those who died. Levels of IP-10, MIG and MCP-1 (chemoattractants of monocytes and macrophages that are produced in bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages [6]\u2013[8]) were elevated in patients with avian and human subtypes of influenza but were higher in H5N1-infected individuals and particularly high in those who died [6]. Levels of the neutrophil chemoattractant interleukin (IL)-8 were also elevated in H5N1-infected individuals, particularly in those who died [6]. The IL-8 chemokine is produced by bronchial epithelial cells and may function in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [9], which may be particularly relevant to H5N1 influenza, as progression to respiratory failure is associated with the development of ARDS [10]\u2013[11]. The clinical and pathological features in H5N1-infected humans and animal models suggest that high levels of viral replication combined with early robust host responses play a key role in pneumonia severity and outcome [6], [10]\u2013[16].",

            "text": "The innate immune response of the cell is the first line of defence against viruses. Increasing evidence points to a key role of the innate immune system with its pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in both infectious and non-infectious lung diseases, acute lung injury, pneumoconiosis and asthma [17]. Of PRRs, the well-known Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are expressed in alveolar macrophages, lung epithelial cells and in intraepithelial dendritic cells (DCs), which are either located at the cell surface or in endosomal membranes. These cells respond to infections by sensing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and respond to endogenous molecules (danger-associated molecular patterns [DAMPs]) that are released after tissue damage [17]\u2013[18]. The TLRs recruit different adapter molecules and initiate signalling pathways leading to the activation of NF-kB\u2013dependent proinflammatory gene expression and/or to IRF3/7-mediated type I interferon (IFNa/b) expression [18]\u2013[19]. An analysis of sections from the human respiratory tract demonstrated that H5N1 attached to the apical cell membrane of bronchiolar cells, type II pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages [20]. Therefore, activation of TLRs expressed in type II pneumocytes could help mediate the response to H5N1 viruses [21], contributing to the promotion of a destructive host immunity [22]\u2013[24]. Although neuraminidase inhibitors are effective in treating avian influenza, especially if given within 48 h of infection, it is more difficult to prevent the resultant hypercytokinemia from developing if the patient does not seek timely medical assistance.",

The evidence for corticosteroid use in other severe viral pneumonias, including varicella-zoster virus infection and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), is also insufficient [7]\u2013[8]. Several studies involving patients with sepsis and ARDS have suggested that high-dose corticosteroids actually increase the risk of secondary infections [27]. Thus, there is an urgent need to find ways of treating acute hypercytokinemia without compromising overall immunity. Because hemagglutinin, the major surface glycoprotein of H5N1, is responsible for viral binding to host receptors and initiating immediate signalling transduction upon viral invasion [28], the recombinant HA of H5N1 avian influenza virus (AIV) was used in the present study to investigate the signal transduction mechanisms for the dysregulated innate immune reaction. We have demonstrated that challenging respiratory epithelial cells with H5N1 HA exploited the JAK2/3/STAT1 and NF-\u03baB signalling axis and resulted in a large release of cytokines, initiating a destructive innate immune response at early stages. Additionally, we found that a selective JAK3 inhibitor (JAK3inh) targeted to the key signal molecule in the inflammatory signal cascades has potential roles in the treatment of the inflammatory disorders, thereby protecting against a superinflammatory response to PAMPs attack.",

IRF-1 functions as a transcriptional factor for many antiviral genes, resulting in the production of chemokines (e.g., IP-10) that play critical roles in the infiltration of leukocytes into the site of inflammation [29]. Additionally, NF-\u03baB dimers bind to \u03baB sites within the promoter of the IP10 gene [30]. We therefore examined the transcription of IP-10 and IRF-1 genes in the HA-challenged A549 cells. As expected, our results showed an increased transcriptional induction of both genes following HA exposure (\nFigure 2B\n). Correspondingly, we detected a dose-dependent release of IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, MIP-1\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2 and RANTES into the culture supernatants of the A549 cells 12 h after HA stimulation, as shown in \nFigure 2C\n.",

This result is in agreement with our findings that show activation of JAK/STAT and NF-\u03baB signalling pathways in pulmonary epithelial cells upon challenge with HA of H5N1 (\nFigure 2A\n), leading to rapid induction of the IP-10 and IRF-1 genes (\nFigure 2B\n). In addition, high levels of cytokines/chemokines were produced (\nFigure 2C\n). These data may represent a mechanism whereby virus antigenic challenge of alveolar epithelial cells constitutes an initiating event for the development of dysregulated innate immunity. It is worthwhile to point out that HA-triggered signalling events are characterised by an unusual process involved in the phosphorylation of JAK3.",

The expression patterns of Janus kinase 3 contrast sharply with that of other Janus kinases, which are ubiquitously expressed. JAK3 was found to be more limited in its expression and is found in nature killer (NK) cells and in an NK-like cell line but not in resting T cells or in other tissues [35]. In the present study, we have provided evidence that HA treatment immediately caused phosphorylation of JAK2/3 and STAT1/NF-\u03baB in A549 cells (\nFigure 2A\n) and mediated the release of cytokines/chemokines (\nFigure 2C\n), whereas targeting to JAK3 can turn off the signal transduction cascades (\nFigure 3\n). Our results suggest that JAK3 is inducible upon activation in type II pneumocytes. Following the activation of H5N1 by HA, pulmonary epithelial cells, which actively express JAK3, acquire the capability for the recruitment of inflammatory monocyte-derived DC, NK cells and T cells due to significantly increased release of cytokines/chemokines.",

However, the splenocytes from HA-pretreated Jak3+/+ mice were shown to significantly increase production of IFN-inducible chemokines (e.g., IP10, MCP1) without any stimulation (\nFigure 5B\n). We have previously demonstrated that the elevation of IP-10 that emerged at the onset of SARS was followed by progressive lymphopenia with a concomitant increase of lactate dehydrogenase, suggesting a depletion of lymphocytes in lymphoid tissues [36]. An early onset of lymphopenia with the pronounced elevation of cytokines/chemokines and apoptotic lymphocytes in the spleen were also observed in patients infected with H5N1 influenza virus, especially those with a severe infection [28]. These data indicate that the early splenic lymphocyte elimination could occur due to an excessive innate immune induction that is dependent on Jak3 signal activation following the antigenic challenge of H5N1, which might contribute to high levels of viral replication.",
