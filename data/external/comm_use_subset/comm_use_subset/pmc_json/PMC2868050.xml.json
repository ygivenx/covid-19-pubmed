Human telomerase consists of RNA components and a catalytic subunit of human telomerase RT (hTERT), and is coimmunoprecipitated with Akt kinase, heat shock protein 90, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) [3]. Transcription factors c-Myc, SP1, estrogen receptor, E2F-1, WT-1, NF\u03baB and MZF-2 are involved in regulation of hTERT gene expression [4]. Telomerase activity (TA), an indicator of cellular immortalization, is considered to at least partly responsible for the unlimited replication seen in immortalized cells [1,5]. Previous studies have shown that malignant skin neoplasias, including melanoma, exhibit high levels of TA compared to benign skin conditions [6]. High levels of TA in such malignant cells may act to maintain stable telomere lengths [7].",

High and low risk HPV types are usually detected in Bowenoid papulosis (BP) and condyloma acuminatum (CA), respectively. BP is a rare skin neoplasia, which is found in the anogenital area as multifocal papular lesions. In contrast, CA occasionally occurs as pigmented nodules or papules in the anogenital area, resulting sometimes in its misdiagnosis as BP [8]. Overall, high and low risk HPV types were sometimes found in BP [9,10]. Recently, E6 oncoproteins belonging to high risk HPV types were shown to increased TA in epithelial cells, predominantly by inducing transcription of the hTERT gene [11]. In BP and CA, some anogenital tumors show rapid growth and mitosis, while others show spontaneous remission. Therefore, it is clinically difficult to determine whether it is necessary to treat HPV associated anogenital tumors.",

Among these proteins, protein kinase Akt is activated by phosphorylation of threonine 308, and serine 473 has been shown to be important in mediating cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis in several tissues and cancers [13,14]. The Akt activates many downstream factors, including mTOR, which in turn activates 4EBP1 and p70S6K1. The 4EBP1 and p70S6K1 play a critical role in controlling ribosomal protein synthesis during cell proliferation [15,16] through the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E and S6, respectively.

There is a large body of data demonstrating elevated expression of IAP proteins in many human cancers [17-19]. Among them, cervical cancer cells with high risk HPV types have been investigated for the expression of IAPs family [20,21], however, there are no reports about the expression of those genes of HPV associated anogenital tumors. The majority of HPV associated tumor cells possess active TA, and a combination of active TA and high risk HPV oncogene proteins E6 and E7 contributes to the immortalization of primary epithelial cells. The E6 of HPV directly interacts with c-Myc, and the complex activates hTERT expression [11]. Recently, the transcription of c-IAP2, a member of the IAP protein family, was shown to be significantly upregulated by E6 and E7 oncoproteins in cells infected with high risk type HPV 16, but not in cells infected with low risk type HPV 6. Among IAPs family members, c-IAP2 is related to hTERT protein and promotes hTERT as well as c-Myc activity in E6 of HPV 16 [22]. To evaluate molecules relevant to cellular proliferation and immortalization, we examined the expression of the IAPs family members and c-Myc in CA and BP by real time RT-PCR. In addition, we present the TA level and correlate a positive TA with the frequency of p-Akt, p-S6 and p-4EBP1 expression in these tumors.",

Despite of the infection with high risk HPV, BP sometimes shows spontaneous regressions within a few months. However, BP may transform into squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the genitalia but the mechanism for the development of SCC from BP has not been defined [8]. In contrast, CA is also infected with HPV which is low risk HPV types 6 or 11. Overall, giant CA is occationally considered a low grade of SCC [8]. The BP and CA are little known regarding the molecular mechanisms involved in malignant transformation or spontaneous remission based on the biological alterations of the cell cycle, cell signaling and apoptosis.",

Positive TA was detected in 41.7% (5 of 12) BP samples and 22.7% (5 of 22) CA samples (p = 0.025). These results suggest that higher telomerase activity is correlated with high risk HPV associated BP compared to low risk HPV associated CA. There was no evidence of increased TA in normal skin (NS) from non-sun-exposed areas. Initially, we hypothesised that increased TA could be an important tumor marker for malignant potential. As expected, this study showed a higher frequency of increased TA in BP compared with CA. Importantly, increased TA was also found in 22.7% (5 out of 22) CA samples that were associated with low-risk HPV. In general, low levels of TA are present in non-malignant skin conditions [6]. Hiyama et al. demonstrated that leukocytes constitutively express low levels of TA [31]. Therefore, this study suggested that CA with TA may be an intermittent phenomenon and that the presence of low risk HPVs was not associated with increased TA. Overall, current study suggested that only the high risk HPV E6 and E7 genes increased TA in anogenital tumors.",

            "text": "The expression of the c-Myc gene is important for cell proliferation in HPV associated cutaneous lesions. The c-Myc gene acts directly or indirectly through its interaction with p53 and E6 oncoproteins, and plays an important role for the induction of hTERT protein [9]. In contrast, IAPs family (XIAP, c-IAP1 and c-IAP2) can suppress apoptosis induced by a variety of apoptotic triggers. The IAPs family can inhibit the downstream components of caspase activation pathways that regulate apoptosis. Some studies have established a circumstantial association between the IAPs family and cancer. The overexpression of several family members has been detected in several classes of human cancers [32,33]. Among IAPs family, c-IAP2 is related to the hTERT protein and promotes hTERT expression [22]. According to one study, overexpression of E6/E7 was found in high risk types HPV 16 and 18, but not in low risk type HPV 6, and an activated c-IAP2 promoter was found in E6/E7-immortalized human keratinocytes [22]. We quantitated the expression of IAPs family and c-Myc mRNA using real time RT-PCR assay in 10 BP and 15 CA samples. The levels of IAPs family members (c-IAP1, c-IAP2 and XIAP) and c-Myc mRNA expression in BP samples were higher than those in CA and normal skin samples (Figure 2). The mRNA expression levels were carefully determined by performing triplicate assays. Of interest, 30% (Cases 6, 7 and 10) of BP showed significantly high expression of c-IAP1, c-IAP2 and XIAP genes compared to the other samples. Increased c-Myc expression was also found in 30% (Cases 6, 7, and 10) of BP, and was not observed in CA samples. These results supported that some BP with high risk HPV types have high levels of antiapoptosis, while CA does not have such characteristics. In Cases 6, 7 and 10, it would be necessary to remove the lesional skin, because BP may undergo transformation into SCC. In contrast, the low expression of mRNA IAPs family members in other BP and CA samples suggested limited cell proliferation and a possible tendency toward spontaneous remission.",

            "text": "The phophatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway plays a central role in diverse cellular functions, including proliferation, growth, survival and metabolism. In general, Akt promotes protein synthesis and cell growth by alleviating TSC1/2 suppression of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), allowing the latter to act as part of the mTOR-raptor complex on 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1) and ribosomal protein S6 (S6) [34]. Both S6 and p70S6 kinase1 are present downstream in the Akt signaling pathway, which is not linearly associated with 4EBP1 phosphorylation [35]. To date, alterations of the Akt/mTOR pathway have been observed in numerous types of carcinomas, but little has been reported about Akt/mTOR signaling in skin tumors. In the current study, although p-4EBP1 expression did not differ between CA and BP with or without positive TA, p-Akt and p-S6 were expressed significantly more often in BP and CA with increased TA than in CA and BP without TA. This result suggested that positive TA is associated with activated p-Akt and p-S6 expression but not with p-4EBP1 expression. Overall, we speculated that HPV associated anogenital tumor cells with increased TA could be correlated with activation of Akt/mTOR/p70S6K1/S6 signaling pathway but not with 4EBP1 signaling pathway. In fact, S6 and 4EBP1 are located in the downstream of Akt but they are different signal pathways [34,35].",

A minority of BP samples with high risk HPV types showed increased c-Myc and IAPs family mRNA expression, whereas CA samples with low risk HPV types showed little increase in those genes. These results provided the majority of CA even if they have increased TA and/or positive proteins expression in cell signaling pathway, this may be transient or intermittent phenomenon and may be indicative of future apoptosis. The majority of BP lesions in this study showed low levels of TA and mRNA expression of IAPs family and c-Myc, suggesting most of BP were considered to be less aggressive tumors. However, BP with high TA levels and increased mRNA expression of IAPs family and c-Myc may develop into SCC. Therefore, overexpression of IAPs family and c-Myc are also important in affecting cancer progression. Combined estimation of cell growth and apoptosis-regulating proteins may provide clinically relevant molecular markers in HPV associated anogenital tumors.",
