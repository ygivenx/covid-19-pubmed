            "text": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common type of inflammatory arthritis, affecting between 0.5 and 1% of the population worldwide, regardless of geographical location and ethnicity (1,2). Although the etiology of RA remains to be fully elucidated, numerous studies have suggested that a combination of environmental and genetic factors are responsible. However, although environmental and genetic factors have been demonstrated to be important, they are insufficient for full expression of the disease. The primary inflammatory site in RA is the synovium. The proliferation of synovial fibroblasts is one of the main characteristics of RA and is considered to be necessary for the initiation and long-term progression of joint destruction in RA (3\u20136). In the long-term, joint destruction may lead to limited functions, decreased work ability and, more importantly, a decrease in the quality of life for patients with RA. In addition, RA is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and, thus, the life expectancy of patients with RA may be reduced by 3\u201318 years (7). Therefore, the inhibition of synovial hyperplasia during the early stages of disease progression may provide a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of RA.",

            "text": "Houttuynia cordata Thunb (HCT) is a perennial herbaceous plant that grows in the wild in moist, shady areas in numerous Asian countries, including India. HCT has been widely used in China, Japan and other Asian countries as a medicine due to its anti-inflammatory properties (8). Previous studies have demonstrated that HCT has anti-inflammatory effects in a wide range of diseases (8\u201311). During the outbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in 2008 in China, HCT was used as a therapeutic drug (12). Several studies demonstrated that HCT inhibited enterovirus 71 and coxsackievirus A16, which are the two main causative agents of HFMD (13,14). It has also been demonstrated that HCT water extract was able to treat severe acute respiratory syndrome (8,15,16) and herpes simplex virus infection (17). Sodium houttuyfonate (SH), an addition compound of sodium bisulfite and houttuynia, is the stable form of houttuynia and exhibits the same effect as HCT. Certain studies have demonstrated that SH has an antibacterial effect against 21 strains of Staphylococcus aureus (18) and it has previously been used for the treatment of cationic bovine serum albumin-induced membranous glomerulonephritis in BALB/c mice (19). Previous studies have also demonstrated that SH exerts an anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting the tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) pathway (20), which led to the hypothesis that SH may also be effective for the treatment of RA.",

Notably, several studies have indicated that HCT was able to efficiently inhibit IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1 (24,28). In addition, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been demonstrated to be efficacious in the treatment of RA by binding to cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes and therefore inhibiting the production of prostaglandins. Previous studies also demonstrated that HCT supercritical extract exerted an anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting the COX-2/prostaglandin E2 pathway. Owing to the gastrointestinal side-effects of NSAIDs, HCT may be a better drug candidate for the alleviation of symptoms caused by RA (20). The present study demonstrated that the synovial proliferation rate significantly decreased following treatment with SH. Furthermore, the inhibition rate of SH was found to be dose dependent.
