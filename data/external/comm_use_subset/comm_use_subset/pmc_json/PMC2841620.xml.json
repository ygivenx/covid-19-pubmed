            "text": "Many viruses use the microtubule network of the host cell for transport to their site of replication (i.e. the nucleus) [1]. Access to the microtubule network is achieved through recruitment of cytoplasmic dynein motor proteins followed by efficient retrograde transport towards the nucleus [2],[3]. Virus-induced cellular signaling cascades help stimulate the directionality and efficacy of the transport [4]. Viral interaction with dynein motor proteins occurs either directly through capsid proteins or indirectly via hijacking of adapters from existing transport pathways [5]. Most DNA viruses accumulate transiently at the microtubule organizing center (MTOC) prior to nuclear translocation [1],[3],[6]. How they release from the microtubules or the MTOC and transport to nuclear pores is poorly understood. MTOC release may involve a switch from dynein to kinesin mediated transport, the cellular ubiquitin/proteasome system and/or nuclear transport receptors [1], [3], [5]\u2013[8].",

For example, translocation of a murine coronavirus from the endosome to the cytoplasm is facilitated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system [9]. Similarly, influenza viruses appear to be trapped in an endosomal compartment upon pharmacological inhibition of the proteasome [10]. In contrast, blocking the proteasome increases the transduction efficiency of adeno-associated virus vectors and this correlates with ubiquitylation of capsid proteins [11],[12]. The Semliki forest and the vesicular stomatitis virus, however, do not seem to be affected by proteasome inhibition during their entry suggesting different host factor requirements [10].",

Egress involves the transport of assembled capsids, subviral structures or individual capsid proteins to assembly and budding sites at the cell surface or at intracellular membranes [1]. Budding, and potentially trafficking, to the egress site requires an intact class E vesicular sorting pathway (VSP, [13],[14]. The VSP is believed to involve the consecutive activity of three distinct heteromeric complexes termed endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT-I, -II and \u2013III, [15]). The capsid proteins of several enveloped viruses encode \u2018late domains\u2019 that specifically interact with ESCRT components and redirect them towards the site of viral egress [13]. Some late domains of the PPxY motif type (where x can be any amino acid) require the binding of ubiquitin ligases of the Nedd4 family of HECT-E3 ubiquitin ligases (Homologous to E6-AP Carboxyl Terminus) for efficient ESCRT recruitment [13].",

Partial disassembly releases the internal capsid protein VI, which can lyse membranes in vitro via its predicted N-terminal amphipathic helix [28]. In the cytosol, the particle engages in microtubule-directed transport towards the MTOC and is translocated to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) for nuclear import of the genome [29]\u2013[31].",

We demonstrate that the internal capsid protein VI is rapidly exposed to antibodies during cell entry, possibly at the cell surface or immediately after endocytosis. We further determine that protein VI remains partially associated with Ad capsids as they traffic to MTOCs and the NPC. We identify a functional PPxY motif within protein VI that mediates the association of protein VI with Nedd4 E3 ubiquitin ligases and facilitates its ubiquitylation. Recombinant Ad5 in which the protein VI PPxY motif is mutated have normal capsid morphology, escape from endosomes with similar efficiency as wildtype viruses, but are defective in genome delivery to the nucleus. We show that the PPxY motif in protein VI is involved in its efficient microtubule-mediated transport and mutating it in the virus alters the intracellular targeting of Ads towards the MTOC region concomitant with a post-entry block in viral infectivity. Furthermore, Nedd4.1 and Nedd4.2 are involved in Ad infection and intracellular targeting of incoming virions to the MTOC. We propose that the PPxY motif, in other viral systems, may also function during entry and interact with novel cellular pathways for efficient viral entry.",

To this end, fluorescently labeled Ad particles were adsorbed to either human retina epithelia pigment cells (hTERT-RPE1, Figure 1) or human osteosarcoma cells (U2OS, Figure S1) at 4\u00b0C and then transferred to 37\u00b0C to synchronize internalization. Cells were fixed at various times and analyzed by confocal microscopy (Figure 1). Protein VI was detected using an affinity purified polyclonal-antiserum and the location of the MTOC was marked by detecting the primary cilia, which originates at the MTOC using antibodies against acetylated tubulin [32]. At 4\u00b0C viral particles accumulated at the cell periphery showing sporadic positive staining with the protein VI antiserum (\u223c1%) possibly due to the recognition of protein VI from damaged particles (Figure 1 first row). In contrast, 5 min after the temperature shift, Ad particles were still localized close to the cell periphery but approximately 40% of them gave a signal with the protein VI antibody indicating that more protein VI was accessible (Figure 1, second row). After 15 min, particles had entered the cell with some localized at the MTOC region (Figure 1, third row) and some at the nuclear rim as described previously [6]. About 10% of the particles remained protein VI positive, including particles at the nuclear rim. After 45 min the majority of the particles were concentrated at the MTOC region (Figure 1, bottom row) as previously reported [3]. Protein VI staining was also concentrated at the MTOC region but most of the signal was not particle associated. Similar results were obtained in U2OS cells (Figure S1). Together these data suggested that structural rearrangements leading to protein VI exposure take place at or close to the cell surface during Ad entry. In addition, the data showed that protein VI trafficked to the MTOC region and partially remained associated with the capsid.",

To examine the role of this PPxY motif in Ad cell entry, we used an E1/E3-deleted Ad5 that had the protein VI PPSY motif mutated to PGAA (Ad5-VI-M1, detailed in Figure S3) [33],[34]. This mutation, when introduced into Mason-Pfizer monkey virus, was previously shown to abolish late domain functions with no apparent structural changes, which would impair virus assembly [35],[36]. To control for unintended mutations introduced during the cloning, we reverted the PGAA sequence back to PPSY (Ad5-VI-wt). Because the \u223c360 copies of protein VI appears to be in contact with several proteins in the mature capsid, modifications that disrupt the tertiary structure could also affect the capsid composition. In large-scale preparations, mutant and wt virus banded at identical densities and gave similar yields of particles as determined by genome and protein quantification. A biochemical analysis of the capsid composition of purified viral particles showed no apparent differences between wt and mutant viruses (Figure 2A and data not shown). To confirm that viral capsid integrity between mutant and wt virus remained unchanged, we used negative stain electron microscopy. As shown in Figure 2B capsid integrity and morphology of the mutant virus was indistinguishable from the wt virus. In contrast, the infectious versus physical particle ratio of Ad5-VI-M1 was \u223c20-fold lower than Ad5-VI-wt as assayed by plaque formation on monolayers of 911 cells (Figure 2C). Because infectious vs. physical particles can vary between preparations, we assayed plaque size, which is more informative measurement of propagation rate. Plaques were significantly smaller for Ad5-VI-M1 versus Ad5-VI-wt (see below), suggesting that the altered PPxY domain affects some stages of virus propagation.",

We infected A549 cells with 30, 300 or 3000 particles per cell of either Ad5-VI-wt or Ad5-VI-M1 in the presence of alpha-sarcin, a membrane impermeable toxin that inhibits translation when it enters the cytoplasm. Alpha-sarcin enters the cell by virus-mediated endosomal membrane lysis thus providing a quantifiable marker for endsome membrane lysis (Figure 2G, [28]). We measured the incorporation of radiolabeled amino acids over time as a means to determine translational efficiency. As control we used the temperature sensitive Ad mutant Ad2ts1 that is closely related to Ad5. Ad2ts1 mutants poorly lyse the endosomal membrane when the virus is grown at non-permissive temperatures due to an increased capsid stability that lacks intra-endosomal disassembly. Ad2ts1 mutants grown at permissive temperatures lyse the endosome with the same efficiency as the wt virus. Incorporation of radiolabeled amino acids was compared to alpha-sarcin treated cells. When we added alpha-Sarcin and Ad5-VI-wt, Ad5-VI-M1 or the Ad2ts1 mutant grown at a permissive temperature translation was diminished in a dose-dependent manner over at least two orders of magnitude, showing efficient cytoplasmic delivery of the toxin. Ad2ts1 grown at the non-permissive temperature did not inhibit translation in this assay (Figure 2G). We observed no difference between the PPxY-mutant virus and the wt controls. This indicated that an attenuating effect of the PPxY-mutation occurs after endosomal lysis and prior to the onset of replication.",

Ad5-VI-wt released protein VI within 5 min (Figure 3A, left panel). In contrast, we observed a delayed release of protein VI from Ad5-VI-M1 (15% of M1 after 5 min compared to 38% of wt, Figure 3A) and an increase in colocalization of viral particles with protein VI at the nucleus (Figure 3A). This observation suggests a delayed accessibility of protein VI within the virus or a defect in protein VI dissociation from the virion (Figure 3A, images to the right). In addition to the increase of protein VI capsid association, Ad5-VI-M1 appeared to be more evenly distributed throughout the cell and did not efficiently accumulate at the MTOC region (Figure 3B, images to the left). Quantification revealed that 45 min post-infection approximately 60% of the wt viral particles in proximity of the MTOC could be found within a 10 \u00b5m radius around the MTOC and 40% within 10\u201320 \u00b5m. In contrast, the localization for the M1 virus was 50% for each region showing a decreased targeting towards the MTOC (Figure 3B, right panel). In summary these data suggest that the PPxY motif in protein VI is required for proper uncoating and normal nuclear targeting.",

Disrupting actin filaments with cytochalasin B had no apparent effect on VI-wt localization or motility (Figure 5B, right panel) suggesting that actin was not involved in the movement. In contrast, protein VI motility in nocodazole-treated cells was strongly reduced resembling the reduced motion observed for the M1 mutant (Figure 5B, right panel, see also Video S2 in the supporting information).",

We adapted an in vitro Ad disassembly assay mimicking the partial capsid disassembly believed to occur during Ad entry by exposing virions to 48\u00b0C. This assay dissociates the vertices including fiber, penton, protein VI and peripentonal hexons, but leaves the remainder of the capsid intact (Figure S5; [28]). Heat and mock-treated samples were subjected to in vitro ubiquitylation reactions, using free ubiquitin, recombinant E1 and E2 enzymes and purified cytosol as source for the E3 ubiquitin ligase(s), and analyzed by western blot (Figure 6, [28]). Western blot analysis showed that partial capsid disassembly resulted in the appearance of protein VI reactive signals with discrete size increments suggesting predominant modification with two to three ubiquitin as well as some higher molecular weight bands (lane 2, Figure 6A). In contrast, the lack of capsid disassembly (lane 1) or cytosol (lane 3) showed no additional protein VI reactive bands. We also tested ubiquitylation of the capsid proteins fiber, protein IIIA and penton base as internal control. We only detected ubiquitylation of the penton base (which also harbors two PPxY domains at its N-terminus), while the fiber and protein IIIA (which lack PPxY motifs) were not modified (Figure S5). The ubiquitylation of protein VI was also confirmed by using GST-ubiquitin in the above assay, followed by GST-pulldown to show covalent modification of protein VI with ubiquitin confirming the predominant modification with two to three ubiquitin-moieties (data not shown).",

We first co-expressed the VI-wt or VI-M1 mRFP fusion protein together with each of the E3 ligases fused to GFP in U2OS cells. When expressed alone, most ligases localized primarily to the cytoplasm (data not shown, WWP1 localized to the plasma membrane and WWP2 accumulated in an uncharacterized intracellular membrane compartment). In contrast, when VI-wt is coexpressed with Nedd4.1, Nedd4.2 or AIP4/Itch, the ligases are recruited to the same membrane compartment as protein VI (Figure 7A, row 1\u20133). WWP1 appears to sequester protein VI at the plasma membrane (Figure 7A, row 4). WWP2 does not colocalize with VI-wt (Figure 7A, row 5).

For Ads, reaching the nucleus requires a series of sequential steps: receptor-mediated endocytic uptake, partial capsid disassembly, endosomal rupture, microtubule based transport to the MTOC and nuclear trafficking. The link between these steps has been best exemplified in the case of the thermostable temperature-sensitive mutant Ad2ts1. This mutant enters cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis, but remains in an endosomal compartment due to increased capsid stability. Therefore, Ad2ts1 particles are directed to lysosomes for destruction and/or recycled back to the surface thus precluding accumulation at the nuclear pore complex [26],[28],[39]. The role of facilitating endosomal escape during Ad entry was initially assigned to the penton base [40]. Later, Wiethoff and co-workers showed that most membrane lytic activity of Ad viral capsids comes from the predicted N-terminal amphipathic helix of the internal capsid protein VI, and that membrane lytic activity required partial capsid disassembly to release protein VI [28].",

To our knowledge protein VI is the first Ad capsid protein described that possesses its own microtubule-dependent dynamics and future work has to address if other capsid proteins have similar properties. Inactivation of the PPxY in the viral context (Ad5-VI-M1) resulted in a post-entry delay that reduced infectivity and prevented efficient accumulation of the entering virus particles at the MTOC. While we cannot exclude the possibility that the PPxY motif in protein VI also plays a role in adenoviral replication, assembly or egress, our single round infection assays showed that the majority of the titer reduction for the mutant was related to steps prior to the initiation of replication or the delivery and expression of a reporter gene. Moreover, our data show that the efficiency with which a toxin is delivered to the cytosol during Ad infection is similar for mutant and wt virus. This provides strong evidence that the PPSY motif in protein VI has a function during cell entry, but probably only after endosomal membrane lysis has occurred. Current structural data place protein VI inside the assembled capsid, therefore potentially precluding it from functions during egress at least when capsid associated [43]\u2013[45]. Our observations show that protein VI is exposed after entry and that capsid disassembly is required for its ubiquitylation, which is consistent with our hypothesis that the PPxY motif is accessible only during Ad entry following partial capsid disassembly. Furthermore, it is currently not clear whether late domains containing PPxY motifs present in other viral systems, which are required for viral egress, have additional functions. Mutational inactivation of PPxY motifs in the VP40 structural protein of Ebola virus and matrix protein of rabies virus both showed an attenuation of the virus and a reduction of infectivity [20],[46]. Interestingly, for Ebola virus, the PPxY mutants showed no budding defect, but virus production was reduced, which could indicate a disruption earlier on in the life cycle than previously thought [46]. For rabies virus, Wirblich et al. describe a budding defect of the late-domain mutant but also noted a reduction of early mRNA production [20].",

A role for Nedd4.1 or Nedd4.2 in Ad entry is underscored by our observation that Nedd4.2 can directly ubiquitylate protein VI via the PPxY motif and its depletion (and to a lesser extent also depletion of Nedd4.1) reduces Ad transduction. In addition this depletion also reduced MTOC accumulation of viral particles following infection, which is similar to the effect of the PPxY mutation in the M1 virus. However the effects were modest, indicating that additional mechanisms contribute to Ad entry.

Ubiquitylated protein VI could be specifically recognized by cellular factors. Alternatively, recruitment of Nedd4.1 and/or Nedd4.2 by protein VI could result in the ubiquitylation of other cellular factors that constitute an efficient transport means used by the virus. Recent work has shown that some members of ESCRT-I become ubiquitylated when Nedd4.2 is overexpressed [18],[19]. Therefore, it is possible that Nedd4.2 (or other Nedd4-ligases) binding to protein VI could activate the ESCRT pathway via ubiquitylation. Whether membrane compartments or the ESCRT pathway plays a direct role in Ad virus transport during entry remains to be addressed. However, ESCRT components can be found at the endosomal compartments as well as associated with the centromeric region [47]. It is noteworthy that endosomal escape is also required for interferon induction by Ad via yet unknown mechanisms [48].

A lack of functional PPxY may therefore block disassembly steps, preclude efficient endosomal escape following the membrane lysis event or fail in the recruitment of subsequent factors required to efficiently link the virus with retrograde transport pathways. Penton base also encodes PPxY motifs [49]. Because eliminating the PPxY motif from protein VI had only modest effects on MTOC accumulation, there may be functional overlap between the PPxY in protein VI and penton base. This is further supported by the observation that ubiquitylation of penton could be abolished by depleting the cytosol with protein VI indicating that maybe the same ligases are involved (Figure S5).",

            "text": "In conclusion, our study is the first demonstration of a PPxY motif, previously described for viral late domains, present in a non enveloped DNA virus that exerts a function during entry. Conservation of the amphipathic helix and PPxY motif in all Mastadenovirus suggests that protein VI fulfils a key function. We suggest that after endocytosis cell or serotype specific capsid disassembly cues regulate exposure, membrane-interaction and ubiquitylation of protein VI (and possibly other capsid proteins). This could facilitate the recruitment of a common cellular microtubule-dependent pathway for retrograde trafficking. This mechanism could be more important in vivo in highly polarized epithelia or neurons where long-range movement is crucial and might be less important in cell culture models [50]. Given the prevalence of viral late domains, ubiquitylation and trafficking towards the MTOC our results may have uncovered a more general mechanism by which viruses and other cargos achieve intracellular delivery and provide a rational to look for further \u201cearly\u201d functions of PPxY motif containing late-domains in other viral systems.",

Two concentric circles with 10 \u00b5m and 20 \u00b5m in diameter were positioned around the MTOC as shown in the left panel. Virus particles were then counted inside the 10 \u00b5m radius and in the region between 10\u201320 \u00b5m. The graph to the right shows the relative abundance within the two regions. Distribution for the wild type virus is shown on the left of the graph and for the PPxY mutated virus to the right. The analysis shows that mutated particles are less likely to accumulate at the MTOC then wt particles. The error bar represents cell-to-cell variation (n>15, p<0.05).",

Western blot controls for depletion are shown to the left (except for WWP1 where depletion of transfected WWP1-GFP was detected using GFP specific antibodies because no specific antibodies were available for detection of the endogenous protein). Following depletion, cells were transduced with AdGFP. Relative GFP expression is shown. Statistical analysis was performed using pairwise comparison using the Mann & Whitney-test showing significant reduction for Nedd4.2 depleted cells. B) In vitro ubiquitylation reaction using recombinant active Nedd4.2 (lane 1 and 2) or inactive Nedd4.2 (lane 3). Recombinant VI-wt (lane 1 and 3) or VI-M1 (lane 2) was used as substrate. Modified protein VI (grey arrows) or unmodified protein VI (black arrows) was detected following western blot analysis. Antibodies are indicated to the left of each blot. C) Dose dependent depletion of Nedd4.2 and Nedd4.1. U2OS cells were transduced with increasing amounts of shRNA expressing lentiviral vectors achieving transduction levels as indicated (from 25\u2013100%) and transduced with AdGFP. GFP expression levels were determined 24 h later using flow cytometry. GFP expression levels within each condition were normalized to transduction controls of cells treated with shRNA expressing lentiviral vectors against luciferase (arbitrarily set to 1). Values are the mean (+/\u2212 standard deviation) of at least two experiments done in triplicates D) Accumulation of Ad at the MTOC region following Nedd4 depletion. Fluorescently labeled Ad was used to infect cells following control depletions (shLuc) or depletion of Nedd4.1 or Nedd4.2 using (sh4.1 (1) and sh4.2 (1) as in C). Subcellular localization of viral particles was determined at 45 min. post infections. Cells were fixed and stained for the MTOC using a pericentrin antibody. Particles were counted and scored for their relative proximity to the MTOC using two concentric circles with 10 and 20 \u00b5m diameter around the MTOC (compare also Figure 3). The graph shows percentage of viral particles within 10\u00b5m or 10\u201320 \u00b5m proximity to the MTOC as indicated. Note that in Nedd4.1 and Nedd4.2 depleted cells the relation is inverted compared to control depleted cells showing less viral particles accumulating at the MTOC.
