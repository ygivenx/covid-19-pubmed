More recently, Calvin Schwabe revived the concept of One Medicine [1]. As the traditional boundaries between medical and veterinary practice continue to pervade society there is a need for the practical application of one health.",

[5] that approximately 75% of new emerging human infectious diseases are defined as zoonotic, meaning that they may be naturally transmitted from vertebrate animals to humans. New and reemerging zoonoses have evolved throughout the last three decades partly as a consequence of the increasing interdependence of humans on animals and their products and our close association with companion animals. Zoonoses should therefore be considered the single most critical risk factor to human health and well-being, with regard to infectious diseases. Of the 1,461 infectious diseases recognized to occur in humans by the National Academy of Sciences, Institute of Medicine [6], approximately 60% are caused by multihost pathogens, characterized by their movement across various species. This gives significant credence to the importance of examining health effects across species, in order to fully understand the public health and economic impact of such diseases and to help implement treatment and preventive programs. The one health concept is a broad term that covers a variety of subcategories identified as bioterrorism, animals as predictors for disease, and the psychological bonds that can exist between an animal and a human [7].",

Four subobjectives were considered. The first assessed scholarly resources on the one health approach published works between January 1, 1984, and December 31, 2012. One health scholarly resources were classified as peer-reviewed publications, professional presentations, grants or funding allocations, reports from the WHO, and books or book chapters. The second objective examined the preferred scope of one health published works within the period of study. Scopes of one health subject categorizations were, namely, zoonoses, food safety, agriculture, environmental health and global health. The third objective analyzed the geographic distribution of scholarly one health resources, whether they were in developed nations or developing nations listed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The final objective reviewed trends in the application of the one health concept.",

These categories were condensed from a larger, more complex list provided by the One Health Initiative Task Force [3]. For resources that contributed to more than one scope, such as agriculture and food safety, the final determination was made on the emphasis of one of the scopes from within the contents of the title.

There were a total of 8 resources in 1995 (4%) and 43 in 2009 (21.5%). The year 1998 began a continuous presence of one health resources annually. The year 2006 began a continued increase in one health resources for the period of review. The years 2010 to 2012 were the most productive for publications on one health as 71% of publications occurred during this period of time. An overall increase in the number of published one health scholarly works was found for the review with a marked increase in the most recent years (Figure 1). Journal articles, presentations, WHO reports, and books or book chapters were included in the analysis. Grants and funding allocations were not represented in the data gathering process. Of the resulting resources, peer-reviewed journal articles took precedence (85%) of all publications, while presentations and books accounted for 8.0% and 6.5%, respectively; only one WHO report was recorded. Evaluation of scopes, covered in the 737 scholarly resources (Figure 2), revealed that the predominant topics were global health, with 247 scopes (33.5%), and environmental health, with 232 total scopes (31.5%). In terms of geographic distribution of the scholarly resources, most of the resources focused their objectives within or towards countries that were already developed (70%) (Figure 3). An assessment on how one health initiatives were distributed by country size and GDP was achieved by mapping and measuring the burden of zoonoses and its distribution across the world (Table 1). Events of zoonoses were found to be disproportionately distributed as a result of the poverty and emerging market interface. Outbreaks or epidemics of emerging zoonoses were also noted to be sporadic in temporal and spatial distribution and appeared in developed countries where emerging zoonoses had not previously been reported but are increasing in incidence or geographical range.",

When observing the trend of the one health approach over time, there was a minimal spike in 1995, an increased output from 2006, and marked increase from 2010 to 2012. Four (50%) of the eight scopes in 1995 were focused on environmental health, three involved global health (37.5%), and one scope involved food safety (12.5%). An environmental act was passed in 1995 in England by the Environment Agency and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, Office of Public Sector Information [10]. It is likely that the passage of this law contributed to a higher production of publications. The increase in resources produced since 2006 could be related to the E. coli contamination incidents in the United States in 2006 and to the H1N1 outbreaks [11, 12] and also to the passing of the One Health Initiative Task Force in 2007 [3]. Two (4.7%) of the 43 defined resources in 2009 involved agriculture, eight involved environmental health (18.6%), 6 were on zoonoses (13.9%), 23 were on global health (53.5%), and four were on food safety (9.3%). The marked increase since 2010 may have resulted from the developments since 2006 which continued into 2009 which allowed for the one health approach to be placed on the research and scholarly agenda. 12 (5%) of the 236 recorded resources in 2012 involved agriculture, 50 (21%) involved environmental health, 56 (23.5%) were on zoonoses, 98 (41.5%) were on global health, and 21 (9%) were on food safety.",

Immediate action and scholarly resources are commonly implemented after a devastating event occurs [16], proving that the publishing of a particular one health topic may not be due to chance during that specific year. It is important to note that the general availability of one health resources is likely to be higher in the more recent years than in the 1980s, as the Internet was still in its evolutionary stage and not yet a global resource, as it is today [17].

The increasing encroachment of people and livestock into wildlife habitats provided a multifaceted need to study bats and offer understanding for study at the human-wildlife interface [19]. Bats are an important reservoir and vector for spread of a number of emerging infectious diseases and they are associated with zoonoses with global public health significance such as Lyssa, Hendra and Nipah viruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) like coronaviruses, and Ebola and Marburg viruses. The importance of wildlife as reservoirs of human diseases has also been widely recognized for most of the parasitic zoonoses, including American and African trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis, giardiasis, cryptosporidiosis, balantidiasis, fascioliasis, opisthorchiasis, clonorchiasis, paragonimiasis, schistosomiasis, echinococcosis, taeniasis, diphyllobothriasis, sparganosis, dipylidiasis, trichinellosis, toxocariasis, strongyloidiasis, and Ancylostoma caninum and A. braziliense infections. Molecular phylogenetic methods used to examine the genetic diversity and species composition of these parasites in humans and their domestic and wild reservoir, paratenic, definitive, and intermediate host species have shown that they are in many instances identical. For example, African trypanosomes identified in wildlife in the Serengeti in Tanzania and the Luangwa Valley in Zambia which harbour a wide range of trypanosomes are the same species which infect humans and livestock [20]. The one health concept has successfully replaced the disease centered approach to zoonoses with a system based approach that aligns multiple disciplines, working locally, nationally, and globally, to attain optimal health for people, domestic, and wild animals and the environment.",

Collaboration between veterinary, medical, and public health professionals to understand the ecological interactions and reactions to flux in a system can facilitate a clearer understanding of climate change impacts on environmental, animal, and human health.

The one health approach to zoonoses however remains an average priority for health care professionals. The impact of zoonoses on animal health has been largely neglected but the effects on public health usually drive control initiatives on zoonoses and are much better defined by the use of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYS) [30]. The first zoonoses prioritization exercise involving health professionals in North America who had a limited knowledge of infectious diseases identified zoonoses as an area of priority [31]. Another study reported that local public health agencies in North America were not prepared and potentially unaware of their responsibility to be the initiator of the work on zoonotic disease information intelligence [32]. The advancement of the one health approach has increased the discussion and reporting on the topic. There remains a lack of knowledge and application of the integrated approach to health care by the health care professionals. Reaching the goal of control, and elimination and/or ultimate eradication of zoonoses pose a significant challenge for the future. Standardized interlaboratory test validation, intersectoral collaboration and establishment of an international one health diagnostic platform are considered to be important strategies [33]. The sharing of best practices on diagnosis of zoonoses and the further refinement of new, cheaper, multispecies tests which can be interpreted by minimally trained individuals could contribute to a greater level of intersectoral integration, control, and elimination of zoonoses. The projection from one health may eventually lead to a one system approach based on the inherent challenges to intersect disciplines that belong to different systems. One health approaches applied across international boundaries that share the same challenges are required to create sustainable and coordinated control. The one system approach focusing on the strengthening of the community model health system as a whole as well as developing effective and novel tools to be applied across all aspects of health, is fundamental of a one world one health approach [34]. The future of one health is a one world approach with the continued effort towards integration of the contributing parts that form the whole which is health.",

There is a need to increase research on zoonoses, food safety, and agriculture and to improve the understanding of the one health concept. This could be achieved by introducing more scholarly resources in developing countries by the further development of the Internet and the free availability of online information on one health. The use of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) available to developing countries is now being offered to deliver courses on the approach and applications of one health [35]. This is critical because most of the public health and economic impacts that occur within the concept of one health occur in developing nations. The lack of basic health infrastructure in developing countries means that everything else suffers as a result, namely, the environment, human, and animal health and well-being. The future of one health is at a crossroad; there is a need to more clearly define its boundaries and demonstrate its benefits. The greatest acceptance of one health is seen where it is having significant impacts on control of infectious diseases. There is also a continuing need for further efforts towards integration with the global community serving as the unit of a one system approach.",
