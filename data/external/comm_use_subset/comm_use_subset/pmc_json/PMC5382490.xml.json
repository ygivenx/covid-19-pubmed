In identification of NDV molecular methods with use of oligonucleotides specific to conservative regions of NP-gene of NDV were used [29]. Recently VP2 gene region of IBDV is successfully used in synthesis of oligonucleotide primers and probes from highly conservative regions for molecular diagnosis [30\u201333]. Molecular methods for IBV diagnosis are oriented at using more conservative sequences located in S1 and S2 genes of IBV [34, 35].",
