            "text": "Molecular docking-based virtual screening is widely used to discover novel ligands in the early stages of drug development [1], [2], [3], [4]. Various docking programs, such as DOCK [5], AutoDock [6], Surflex [7], FlexX [8], GOLD [9], and Glide [10], [11], have been developed. As an essential component of these programs, the scoring function is able to evaluate the fitness between the ligand and receptor guiding the conformational and orientational search of ligand-binding poses. Since the 1990s, several dozens of scoring functions have been reported in the literature [12], [13]. Current scoring functions can be roughly classified as force-field-based methods [5], [14], [15], empirical scoring functions [16], [17], and knowledge-based statistical potentials [18]. The existing limitations in current docking and scoring include a lack of protein flexibility, inadequate treatment of solvation, and the simplistic nature of the energy function employed [19], [20], [21], [22]. In particular, the major weakness of docking programs lies in the scoring functions [12], [13]. Considering the computational cost and time required for virtual screening, all of the current scoring functions use various approximations resulting in inaccuracy in the score and rank of the ligand-binding poses [19] as well as in false positives mixed in with the top scorers in the ranking list when virtual screening was performed with only a single scoring function. Some studies focus on calculating protein-ligand free binding energy, free energy perturbation (FEP), thermodynamic integration (TI) [23], [24], [25], MM-PB/SA, MM-GB/SA [26], [27], [28] and linear interaction energy (LIE) [29], [30], [31], which were used to perform post-docking processing. Although these methods are reported to be significantly more robust and more accurate than scoring functions, the accuracy is less than that usually required in typical lead optimization applications to differentiate highly similar compounds.",

            "text": "Attempts have been made to reduce the weakness of a single scoring function. In 1999, Charifson et al. introduced a consensus scoring method [20]. Many studies have suggested that employing consensus-scoring approaches can improve the performance by compensating for the deficiencies of the scoring functions with each other [19], [20], [21], [22]. Although the rationale for consensus scoring is still a subject of study, it has become a popular practice. Compared with the calculation of free binding energy mentioned above, the combination of three or four individual functions to perform consensus scoring is a relatively cheap computational method. Wang et al. carried out an idealized computer experiment with three different ranking strategies (\u201crank-by-number\u201d, \u201crank-by-rank\u201d, and \u201crank-by-vote\u201d) to explore why the consensus scoring method performs better than the single scoring function [32]. However, the application of consensus scoring approaches is not always practical under ideal conditions because many obstacles prevent us from obtaining satisfied enrichment rates. These obstacles are as follows: (1) the binding scores calculated by the different scoring functions are typically given in different units and signs; (2) the scoring functions employed in consensus scoring often come from different categories; and (3) the linear relationship between many scoring functions (i.e., one scoring function can be expressed linearly by one or some other scoring functions).",

In the study by Guo et al., five commercially available scoring function were weighted and summed to build a consensus score [33] by training with a 53-molecule set. Verdonk et al. also employed a linear combination of three scoring functions to re-rank the compounds [34]. Although an improvement was found for this consensus scoring method, the correlation between the scoring function and the experimental binding affinity is relatively poor. For a quantitative linear combination of the original scoring functions, the method for determining the appropriate weighting factors (correlation coefficients) for each scoring function is a complex problem.",

PCA is a powerful tool for pattern recognition, classification, modeling, and other aspects of data evaluation [36]. In addition, PCA is a linear transformation technique used to simplify a data set by reducing the dimensionality of multivariate data while preserving as much of the relevant information as possible. The principal components (PCs) are linear combinations of the original variables. The linear coefficients of the inverse relationships of linear combinations are called the component loadings. It represents the correlation coefficients between the original variables and the PC. In the present study, the first principal component (PC1) accounts for the maximum variance (eigenvalue) in the original dataset. The second principal component (PC2) is orthogonal (uncorrelated) to the first one, and it accounts for most of the remaining variance. This procedure is continued until the total variance is accounted for. The method of PCA makes use of intercorrelations that originate from the covariance matrix of the variables.",

It is generally accepted that Alzheimer\u2019s disease is caused by extracellular senile plaque deposition and that the intracellular formation of neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. \u03b2-amyloid peptides, which form the senile plaques, are formed by the action of the \u03b2-secretase and \u03b3-secretase enzyme on the amyloid precursor protein (APP) [41], [42], [43]. The design of a lead compound that can inhibit APP binding to the active site of BACE-1 will prevent the cleavage of APP from the \u03b2-amyloid peptide and thus eventually prevent senile plaque formation [44], [45]. In the present study, the training set is composed of 50 confirmed BACE-1 inhibitors and 9950 inactive compounds [46], [47], [48]. Three rank-based virtual screening methods, individual scoring, conventional consensus scoring and PCA scoring were examined to identify BACE-1 inhibitors. To validate the efficacy of PCA ranking method, after virtual screening of 113,228 compounds (Sigma-Aldrich\u00ae corporate chemical directory) [49] and the BACE-1 fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay, we found two drug-like and low-micromolar inhibitors.",

Molecular fragments were tessellated in the active site and optimized based on the scoring function. The search algorithm utilized the morphological similarity function, which is evaluated between the protomol and the putative ligands. For the docking algorithms, a post-dock minimization procedure was applied using the BFGS quasi-Newton method and an internal Dreiding force field.

It is important to consider which scoring functions should be chosen to perform consensus scoring. We used an additional four scoring functions to perform consensus scoring, but the performance was not as good as the four functions that we chose. Due to the variation in the performance of the different scoring functions, blindly choosing scoring functions to perform consensus scoring will decrease the enrichment rates. Secondly, the four scoring functions that we chose were independent of each other. It is reasonable to expect that an effective consensus scoring scheme would combine complementary scoring functions rather than highly correlated ones. As indicated in Table 2, if the consensus scoring schemes contained Ligscore1 and Ligscore2 as well as PLP1 and PLP2, it would perform poorly compared to the other schemes. Thirdly, Verdonk et al. performed a computational experiment on the simulated effect of consensus ranking with an increasing number of scoring functions using the rank-by-number protocol [34]. They noted that if the first scoring function performs well (standard deviation = 1.0), then adding additional scoring functions (standard deviation = 3.0) to perform consensus ranking can reduce the enrichment rates compared to the most accurate single scoring function. The main reason for this phenomenon was that noise was added to the protocol. However, if all of the scoring functions have a standard deviation of 2.0, then adding extra scoring functions to the consensus ranking protocol always improves the enrichment rates. In our study, all of the binding scores were scaled to unit variance and centered, which was consistent with the results reported by Verdonk et al [34].",

For each five pose group, the application of PCA can result in superior enrichment of known inhibitors compared to either the conventional consensus scoring or the best individual scoring. In addition, the application of PCA for post-processing of the scoring data from virtual screening was not time-consuming. Second, PCA is reliable. PCA is mainly useful when there is limited knowledge about the target and its inhibitors. If we have no idea which scoring function would return the best enrichment rates (i.e., several known active compounds are required to determine the best scoring functions), then adopting PCA to formulate a new scoring function can provide better performance than blindly using a scoring function or some combination scoring functions when performing virtual screening of an uncertain protein. Third, PCA is economical. The objectivity of PCA is due to the fact that it relies entirely on the input data itself instead of developing new scoring functions. In this study, we have employed only an alternative method to exploit the utility of present scoring functions. Bioactive information on active compounds, such as Ki and IC50, and training with a data set were not necessary.",

Jacobsson et al. employed three different multivariate statistical methods including PLS discriminant analysis, rule-based methods, and Bayesian classification to analyze multidimensional scoring data from four different target proteins (i.e., the estrogen receptor R (ERR), matrix metalloprotease 3 (MMP3), factor Xa (fXa), and acetylcholine esterase (AChE)). The classifiers that they built showed that the precision is approximately 90% for three of the targets and approximately 25% for acetylcholine esterase for correctly predicting an active compound [78]. The difference between our work and their\u2019s is that we do not need a training set because PCA is a form of unsupervised learning and relies entirely on the input data itself. In addition, PCA is simpler than the methods mentioned above (SVM, trend vector analysis, PLS discriminant analysis, rule-based methods, and Bayesian classification).",

The major difference between the present work and the work performed by Terp et al. is that we performed structure-based virtual screening on both active and inactive compounds. Terp et al. included only known inhibitors to quantitatively predict the binding affinity. They did not discuss whether the docking scores have been calculated from a docking mode of an inactive compound that does not actually bind.

However, when we applied the PCA scoring method and experimental test through BACE-1 FRET assay, a remarkable 10% hit rate was achieved. On this basis, we summed up some experience as followed: when virtual screening of a new chemical database, the potential researchers usually do not know which kind of individual scoring function work best for the target protein, furthermore, for consensus scoring protocol, they are uncertain which kind of scoring functions should be used to combine for getting the best enrichment rates. Once trapped in this dilemma, the researchers could use PCA scoring protocol to re-rank the results from the virtual screening, a prominent advantage of application of PCA scoring protocol can summarize most of the information from the original scoring functions and improve the enrichment rate, which has been proved to be robust and reliable in the present study.",
