The SDS-PAGE analysis of the double mutants Vpu-DD and Vpu-NN, which lack phosphate groups at the serines, showed only a single band each on the SDS-PAGE at various molecular weights due to the decreased migration rate of the negative charged Vpu-DD upon denaturation (Fig. 2a, lanes 3 and 9)2829. Vpu-52D and Vpu-56D each show two bands (Fig. 2a lanes 5 and 7). Taken together, these results indicate that the four bands of Vpu-WT represent the following from high to low molecular weight, (i) phosphorylation of both of the serines, Ser-52 and Ser-56, (ii) single phosphorylated serines at position 56 and (iii) position 52, and (iv) fully non-phosphorylated serines. The ratio between phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated Vpu remains the same as found in measurements directly from cell pellets using anti-strep-tag antibody for Vpu in Western blot (data not shown).",

Vpu-DD (Fig. 4b, red) and Vpu-NN (Fig. 4b, blue) can both be fitted with a single function (see also Table 2). Vpu-NN (c = 1.05 day\u22121) and Vpu-DD (c = 0.56 day\u22121) mark a fast and slow increase in the area of the higher oligomer, respectively. Vpu-WT exhibited a fast increase (c = 2.35 day\u22121) first, followed by a slow increase (c = 0.31 day\u22121), similar to the afore-mentioned growth rates of Vpu-NN and Vpu-DD, respectively. As a result, Vpu-DD, due to their negative charges at the two serine sites tended to assemble very slowly reaching a final assembly ratio of a = 0.22, whilst Vpu-NN, having charges removed at the site of the two serines, assembled very quickly reaching the largest assembly ratio of a = 0.78. Therefore, the fast increase in the peak of the higher oligomer of Vpu-WT should be due to the assembly of non-phosphorylated Vpu, whilst the slower increase of that peak should be due to the assembly of both, single and double phosphorylated Vpu proteins. The single phosphorylated Vpu proteins obscure the plot in as much they show \u2018mixed\u2019 assembly dynamics. The negative charges of the phosphorylated serine site slowdown or even prevent oligomerization.",

Two copies of the kinked Vpu1\u201352 are run in a single lipid patch in an inverted orientation for 100 ns (Fig. S1). Both of the helices remain in both of the structures. Both of the structures (Fig. S1, black and red curves) show larger root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) values for residues Glu-28 to Ile-32. The structure shown by the red lines in Fig. S1, named Vpu1\u201352, was chosen for the next step, since the residues Leu-33 to Arg-40 of its second membrane-associated helix show lower RMSF values than those of the structure represented by the black curve. Residues Ile-38 to Ala-49 of the second, membrane-associated helix of Vpu1\u201352 are overlapped with the N terminal side of the NMR-based structure of Vpu36\u20138116 to finally generate full-length Vpu1\u201380 with united atoms. MD simulation of two copies of Vpu1\u201380 showed a leveling off of the root mean square deviation (RMSD) values after about 10 ns (Fig. S2, upper left).

The oligomerization ratio of Vpu-WT was due to large values of both TMD assembly (a = 0.68) and the cytoplasmic domain (a = 0.27) (Fig. 6b). For Vpu-DD as well, the TMD assembly contributed the most (a = 0.50) to the overall oligomerization compared to the cytoplasmic domain (a < 0.1) (Fig. 6c). Analysis of the growth curve showed that the growth rates c of the TMDs are almost independent of the phosphorylation state. The higher growth rate of the cytoplasmic domains of Vpu-DD compared to the rate of Vpu-WT is due to an almost sudden assembly of a few proteins (Table 2). In this state the growth rates were not compared with those of the experiments due to the different time scales.",

In this study, the computational models exhibit the same behavior as found experimentally. The dimer is smallest unit to assemble. The level and growth rate of oligomerization of Vpu without the phosphate groups is bigger and faster than Vpu with phosphate groups. In addition, structural features taken from the simulation data allowed specification of the interaction dependent on the cytoplasmic domain and TMD with the latter contributing mostly to the oligomerization ratio. The coarse-graining investigations of conformational dynamics are limited to emphasizing the diffusive aspects of the protein in the bilayer. The computational data represent a semi-quantitative analysis of protein diffusivity which matches the experimental findings. The number of Vpu was chosen to be 16 instead of the putative 19 Vpu molecules calculated from the experimental analysis. This is done due to the need to use a squared lipid patch with regularly positioned molecules of 4 Vpu to build the larger patch.",

In the dimer the two phosphorylation sites are the furthest apart due to electrostatic charge repulsion. During assembly into larger units the exposed negative charges of the phosphate groups have to be taken care of. Whilst the cytoplasmic domain directs oligomerization, the TMDs are responsible for holding the oligomer together. Based on this study, how Vpu is assembled and how it eventually reaches a pore-like structure is shown in the schema in Fig. 7. Some of the individual monomers assemble into dimers via association of TMDs (Fig. 7a,b). Within a larger assembly or patch (Fig. 7c), dimers and additional monomers are able to adopt conformations, which can either be channel-like (as marked by the red circles) or not channel-like (as marked by the dashed grey circles). Conformational changes of the proteins will allow e.g., to the transformation of Vpu proteins from the not channel-like region into the channel-like regions. It is always possible that the assemblies can be made out of the dimers or a mixture of both dimers and monomers. The generation of protein patches for more than 16\u201320 proteins may be restricted due to thermodynamic considerations taking into account protein binding affinities and protein dynamics due to the membrane environment.",

Within a larger assemble or patch (c), dimers and additional monomers are able to adopt specific conformations. These conformations can either be a channel-like state as marked by the red circles or not channel-like (marked by the dashed grey circle). Conformational changes of the proteins will allow transitions between the two states. Channel-like regions can exist as pentameric (I) or eventually hexameric (II) assembled Vpu proteins. A tetrameric assembly (III) of most likely two dimers could serve as precursor state of the formation of channel-like regions.",
