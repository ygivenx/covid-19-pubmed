It is defined as the number of infections caused by an index case within a completely susceptible population, i.e., a population in which there is no pre-existing immunity. R0 is a summary index suggesting both the intrinsic transmissibility of a pathogen and the infrastructure that allows the disease to spread in a given setting. In particular, the value of R0 is affected by transmission probability, contact rate and duration of infectiousness2.",

The health authorities also use R0 for predicting final epidemic size3,5 and assessing the resources required to contain the outbreak, e.g., determining what proportion of people should be vaccinated2. Therefore, it is of great practical importance to estimate R0 for a possible outbreak in public health practice. The value of R0 is estimated from the initial growth rate of an epidemic based on mechanistic models, such as the susceptible-infected-recovered model3,6. For example, R0 has been estimated at approximately 1.5 for 2009 H1N1 influenza7, at 3 for the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak8, and at 12\u201318 for historical measles outbreaks9. As an epidemic unfolds, however, the depletion and recovery of the susceptible population cause fluctuating effective transmissibility, so the value of R0 cannot reflect the time-varying nature of an epidemic. Moreover, when an epidemic occurs in a realistic contact network, R0 can also fail to characterize the transmission potential at the initial stage10.",

            "text": "On the other hand, the effective reproductive number (R) is defined as the number of infections caused by any case11. The difference between R and R0 is that the value of R does not depend on the assumption that the population is completely susceptible, which is often violated in later stages of an outbreak or in a situation in which the population has been exposed to the pathogen previously. Therefore, R aims to characterize the progression of an epidemic in a realistic scenario. Intuitively, counting the branches of infection on transmission trees (i.e., who infects whom6) precisely quantifies the value of R; however, doing this is impractical in most circumstances except for confined outbreaks where contact tracing is feasible12. The epidemic curve (an illustration of the number of new infections) does not encode transmission dynamics and cannot be used to infer R directly. The renewal equation11, which describes the temporal transmission relationship between propagating generations of infected cases, is therefore proposed to estimate R from incidence data in different epidemic periods. More specifically, the renewal equation estimates the values of the time-varying effective reproductive number (Rt), defined as the population-level transmission potential at time t11,13. In a fully susceptible population, early values of Rt should approximate R0, but Rt is more informative in that it tracks the subsequent evolution of transmission potential during the course of an outbreak. The values of Rt can also reveal the time when an outbreak was contained by monitoring the epidemic threshold. During the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, Rt captured a distinct temporal pattern of transmission potential in different countries, signaling the different levels of control measures needed14. As the change in transmission potential is highly correlated to control measures, public health practitioners can evaluate the effectiveness of control measures by determining the change in Rt after implementation. For example, sudden drops in Rt (from 3 to approximately 0.7) after the issuance of a global alert during the 2003 SARS outbreak indicated the effectiveness of the alert15.",

            "text": "Time-varying effective reproductive numbers can be estimated by the renewal equation with a weighted ratio of infectors and infectees11. The generation interval, defined as the infection time interval between a potential infector and an infectee, is the major component of the process of determining the temporal weights of possible transmission. A major pitfall of the renewal equation method is that it automatically assumes homogeneous mixing of individuals. In effect, the temporal weight assumes that transmission probability is determined only by the temporal difference in onset of illness between the infector and infectees, regardless of possible variations due to geographical and social proximity. Human mobility and contact patterns are highly structured in the real world16\u201318 and inevitably violate the homogeneous mixing assumption19. Studies have demonstrated spatial heterogeneities in the transmission of dengue20, cholera21, influenza22, and foot-and-mouth disease23. Recent studies have also shown that spatial distance between cases strongly influences short-term movement24 and, hence, the spread of these diseases. Moreover, short-range transmission has served the essential mode of disease transmission25, i.e., patients typically have a higher chance of infecting others nearby. Although this spatial effect has been considered in the aforementioned studies and in the transmission tree reconstruction of some diseases26,27, the effect of spatial distance on the estimation of the effective reproductive number has not yet been explored. The spatial relationship between individuals can be utilized to calculate the discriminative transmission potential for each individual (Fig. 1; see the methods section for details). Neglecting the spatial variation, conversely, may smooth out heterogeneities in transmission potential, obscure high-risk spreaders, and hamper the effectiveness of control measures. In summary, the effect of spatial proximity or distance should be accounted for in the estimation of effective reproductive numbers.",

It generates individual-level effective reproductive numbers (Rj) and a summarized indicator for the whole population (Rt) by the transmission probability estimated for all infector-infectee pairs, based on both temporal and spatial characteristics. Temporal weighting functions account for the fact that infected cases can only transmit the disease effectively within a certain time window (the generation interval). When only temporal weighting is considered, our method is equivalent to the renewal equation, assuming homogeneous mixing. The spatial weighting function, on the other hand, accounts for the decaying chance of transmission when the distance between individuals increases. The value of spatially adjusted Rj can provide more information regarding spatial heterogeneities in transmission potential and can better aid in the implementation of control measures. Data from dengue epidemics in southern Taiwan are used to demonstrate the ability of this method to identify early spreaders contributing to the geographic expansion of dengue transmission.",

This means that physicians are mandated to report suspected cases in which the patient lives in or has a history of travel to a dengue-affected area and has corresponding symptoms, including fever, rash, eye pain, leukopenia, etc. The reported cases are then confirmed by standard laboratory tests, including real-time PCR, ELISA, and antigen detection28. These surveillance data are recorded and provided by Taiwan Centers for Disease Control, Ministry of Health and Welfare29. The dengue database starts in 1998, when the electronic reporting system was implemented, and we include all records since 1998-01-01. Individual-level information, including date of disease onset and X-Y coordinates of residence, is also provided. Each pair of residence coordinates is listed as the center of a basic statistical area, which is the smallest geographic unit for socioeconomic surveying in Taiwan.

The sizes of the outbreaks ranged from 22,784 cases in 2015TN to 1,183 cases in 2011KH. Generally, dengue outbreaks start in June, reach their peak around September, and end near the end of the year or early the next January. In this study, we analyzed the largest outbreak, 2015TN, to demonstrating our method, while detailed results for the other four epidemics are presented in our supplementary results. Of the 22,784 total infections in 2015TN, only 19 cases (<0.1%) were imported from foreign countries, suggesting that indigenous transmission was well established. In contrast with Kaohsiung city, very few outbreaks occurred in Taiwan before 2015.",

The generation interval of dengue, in particular, is composed if four periods: host incubation, vector incubation, host infectious period and vector infectious period31. Nonetheless, showing compatibility with empirical data and mathematical convenience, gamma distributions are frequently used to model the generation interval of dengue collectively32.

It reflects people in the nearby neighborhood may share common environmental sources of dengue infection. There are several kinds of spatial kernels used in the literature, including exponential decay25 and power-law decay33.

Succeeding spreaders are defined as those cases that were infected by early cases nearby. Although there is a clear distinction between the two spreaders in theory, most individuals lie on a spectrum between these two extremes. We have therefore quantified this property according to the clustering tendency at the location and time immediately before the emergence of that spreader. In other words, clustering tendency is used as the measure for the precondition of a dengue case, and the median clustering tendency is used as the cutoff to classify all dengue cases.

Adjusted Rt provides further information: the shaded area represents the interquartile range (IQR) of adjusted individual reproductive numbers, reflecting the spatial individual heterogeneity of the transmission potential. In contrast, individual reproductive numbers of incident cases that shared identical dates of illness onset are constants in Non-Adjusted Rt. This indicates that the incident cases during this period were highly geographically heterogeneous in their transmission potential.

Subsequently, in the growing stages (from stage II to III), the epidemic curve started to show exponential growth (Fig. 3A); the larger IQR of the individual reproductive numbers (Fig. 3B) reflects some incident cases with higher transmission potential that occurred and resulted in vigorous expansion of disease clustering (Fig. 3C). In the stage of peak plateau (stage IV), Adjusted Rt dropped under the epidemic threshold (<1), indicating that the outbreak was contained. The spatial distributions of cases also show that the clustering areas remained and stopped expanding. In sum, the time-varying reproductive numbers, Adjusted Rt and Non-adjusted Rt, can reflect the timing of the outbreak containment according to the epidemic threshold.

Early spreaders are regarded as the sources of new emerging clusters, and succeeding spreaders are those that come after early spreaders. Figure 6 presents a succeeding spreader a (panel A) and an early spreader b (panel B). In each panel, we also compared different methods (spatially adjusted and non-adjusted) that estimate the transmission probability from a spreader to its potential infectees. The time of the incident cases on these maps is the 30th day after the onset day of the given spreader. Infectees labeled with darker colors have a higher probability of becoming infected by spreader a or b. By the non-adjusted method, the two spreaders have identical transmission probabilities and individual reproductive number because of the homogenous mixing assumption (Non-adjusted Ra = Non-adjusted Rb = 4.15). However, they should play different roles in the spatial expansion of the outbreak. Spreader a (the succeeding spreader) occurred in an ongoing cluster; thus, this case is unlikely to be the primary source that triggered this local outbreak. Spreader b (the early spreader), on the contrary, initiated a new cluster where no case had occurred before, and the following cases that emerged were centered on spreader b. Thus, a subsequent local outbreak can be logically attributed to spreader b as the primary ancestor. The adjusted method (left-side maps in Fig. 6), which takes into account the spatial-temporal relationships of incident cases, differentiates the individual reproductive numbers of early and succeeding spreaders (Adjusted Ra = 1.84, Adjusted Rb = 5.74). It also yields more reasonable spatial transmission potential by upweighting the potential infectees proximity to spreader a in Fig. 6A.",

However, the index conventionally does not capture spatial dynamics of disease transmission.

Unlike the averaged time-varying reproductive number, this method estimates different individual-level reproductive numbers (Rj) for given onset times and locations of dengue infections. Thus, it can reflect spatial heterogeneity in transmission potential among individuals and identify the possible super-spreaders35 with high Rj during the rapidly growing period. Our results also reveal that dengue cases with high transmission potential and long-transmission distance are usually located at the edges of the epidemic foci, which means they could be the drivers of further outbreak expansion. Therefore, our proposed method depicts a more detailed spatial-temporal dengue transmission process and identifies the significant role of the edges apart from the epidemic foci, which could be the weak spots in disease control and prevention. Our spatially adjusted method also could further apply to assess individual-level transmission potential of other acute contagious diseases, such as influenza and Zika virus infection, with observed generation interval and the context of neighborhood transmission.",

Hsieh\u2019s study also showed that Kaohsiung consistently possessed lower effective reproductive numbers (from 1.29 to 2.87), implying that Tainan city may have epidemiological characteristics, such as a lack of herd immunity, that make it more prone to dengue transmission than Kaohsiung.

Codeco31 and Pinho37 also estimated time-varying reproductive numbers in Salvador and Brazil, with a maximum Rt of approximately 4.5. Comparing the values of Rt among different cities may be subject to possible confounding factors, such as weather conditions, host immunity and circulating viral strands.",

These models considered spatial distribution of farms, however, it was difficult to capture FMD disease transmission process among animals. In other words, the time-varying reproductive numbers in these models are difficult to reflect nature course of FMD transmission in terms of implementing general interval and renewal equation. Furthermore, farm-level models for FMD outbreaks can be categorized the farms into infected and susceptible ones to determine relative transmissibility of each farm at a specific time. It may be difficult to estimate the amount of susceptible persons living around the infected cases for human infectious diseases, such as influenza and dengue fever. Other studies have also explored spatial heterogeneity by performing stratified analysis of Rt with respect to different administrative regions and with respect to region-to-region transmission40,41. These studies used a spatial weighting function to emphasize the interregional transmission process but still assumed a homogeneous-mixing model within each region. Thus, these studies did not address the spatial heterogeneous mixing issue when estimating reproductive numbers. Our study considered individual-level spatial heterogeneity and used the spatially adjusted reproductive number to measure the transmission potential of each individual.",

The adjusted Rj in this study could reflect vector mosquito density and host-vector contact rate, which are also highly heterogeneous in space42. Meanwhile, the dispersal of vector mosquitoes is largely confined to neighboring areas (average radius of 28\u2013199 meters43), providing an effective infectious zone of an infector. An exponential spatial weighting function herein represents this infectious zone. Guzzetta25 estimated the mean transmission distance of dengue in a metropolis area to be approximately 127 m and further indicated that an exponential distribution described the data better than a radiation model which is a more dispersed distribution effectively describes human mobility44. Kissler, et al.45 also reported the aptness of the exponential distribution when an outbreak is typically dominated by short-range transmission. Therefore, the exponential spatial weighting function in this study is an appropriate substitute for the effective infectious zone for measuring dengue transmission. The exponential distance-decayed function also avoids overestimating the transmission probabilities of infector-infectee pairs with long geographic distances, especially for large-scale dengue epidemics. In sum, areas with high Rj are potential risk areas for high dengue transmission; knowledge of such areas is important for spatial targeting during dengue epidemics.",

            "text": "Spatial epidemiological studies focused for many years on developing methods for identifying significant disease clustering in time and space, such as space-time scan statistics46 or point pattern analysis47. Hotspot areas identified are usually regarded as significant risk areas and as high-priority sites for intervention strategies aimed at mitigating an epidemic48,49. The significance of the study is to introduce the perspective of individual-level transmission potential to disease risk mapping. We found that locations of individuals with high transmission potential are usually located at the edges of growing disease clusters, which can easily be neglected when intervention resources focus on epidemic clusters. A previous study found that urban villages that were originally at the edge of the city but are now enclosed by urbanized lands act as transfer stations for dengue outbreaks50. In this study, we further provide a better understanding of outbreak expansion by categorizing different types of spreaders. Early spreaders with high transmission potential may initiate new source of infection at the edges of the main cluster, resulting in geographic expansion at the exponential growing stages of the outbreak. Therefore, the edge of the outbreak should be a priority of spatial targeting to contain the outbreak regarding both range and magnitude. Succeeding spreaders are indeed still important in tallying morbidity and fatality. However, their high-density clustering patterns make them prone to the depletion of local susceptible populations and degenerating transmission potential. In summary, the center and edges of epidemic clusters play different roles in developing epidemic progression in terms of different types of spreaders (succeeding vs. early) and different patterns of epidemic growth (intensifying vs. expanding). These findings provide important insights for implementing different interventions in the center and on the edges of epidemic clusters.",

First, the method of estimating time-varying effective reproductive numbers is a retrospective procedure that uses observed infectee generation to estimate the Rj of the infector generation. In other words, it cannot be used for predicting future epidemic progression in real time. Nonetheless, the method is helpful for understanding the course of an epidemic and studying the possible mechanisms of geographical expansion. Second, this study considers only geographical distance as a factor in transmission potential. Other factors influence the spatial spreading of dengue. Among these, host heterogeneity (including variations in density51, mobility52, and susceptibility53) strongly modulates the transmission dynamic42 and should be considered in further studies. Finally, the spatial weighting function reflects the assumption of distance-decayed properties (neighborhood transmission). However, the assumption may not reflect long-distance transmission54 and complex urban transport and mobility52. The question of how to develop more detailed spatial weighting schemes that capture realistic mobility patterns warrants further investigation.",
