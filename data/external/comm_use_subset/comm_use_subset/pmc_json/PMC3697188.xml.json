It has a diverse etiology including infections, trauma, strenuous exercise, drug reactions, metabolic disorders, and status epilepticus [1]. In contrast with the adults, Mannix et al. in the largest series of pediatric rhabdomyolysis, reported that viral myositis was the most frequent cause, accounting for 38% (73/191) of cases and in particular during the first decade of life [2]. Viruses associated with rhabdomyolysis include influenza types A and B, HIV, enteroviruses, Epstein-Barr, cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, herpes simplex, and varicella virus. Influenza has been considered as the most frequent [1].",

Fever was reported in 86% (6/7) [3, 4, 6\u20138]. Myalgias involved predominantly the calves and thighs in all children but one, for which no specific description of muscle involvement was available [3]. Muscle weakness or difficulty in walking was reported in all the remaining cases and muscle swelling in 33% (2/6).",

Similar histopathologic findings have been reported in both influenza and parainfluenza cases. Diffuse or patchy muscle degeneration and necrosis with little inflammatory infiltration were commonly detected [7, 10, 12]. ",

Potential complications include acute renal failure, electrolyte disturbances, and compartment syndrome. Although influenza is the most frequently reported viral cause of rhabdomyolysis, the implementation of laboratory methods such as multiplex polymerase-chain reaction assays may lead to enhanced recognition and characterization of rhabdomyolysis associated with parainfluenza or other pathogens.
