            "text": "Infectious bronchitis (IB) is a highly contagious disease that causes significant economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide [1,2]. Furthermore, chickens infected with infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) also become susceptible to secondary infections with bacteria, or other pathogens, because of the tracheal cilia damage, and display a higher mortality rate [3]. IBV, an etiological agent of IB, is an enveloped virus with a single-stranded positive-sense non-segmented RNA genome of approximately 27.6 kb in length and belongs to the Gammacoronavirus genus [4]. Due to the incomplete proofreading mechanism of coronavirus RNA polymerase and gene recombination during viral replication, new genotypes and serotypes of IBV variant strains appear continuously [5,6]. An array of serotypes and strains of IBV infect chickens exist throughout the world. Therefore, continuous testing of pathogenicity and serotype determination of new isolates in regions and/or countries remains crucial for better epidemiological understanding and control of IB.",

The partial or the full-length of the S gene has been used in the molecular characterization of IBV isolates. The antigenic relatedness and receptor binding with host cells are influenced by hypervariable regions (HVRs) in the S1 gene [8,9,10]; further, the S gene and 5a accessory gene are responsible for the attenuation of virulent IBV via a suitable reverse-genetic system [11]. Therefore, the differences in the genotypes, antigenicity, and pathogenicity existing among IBVs are mainly related to the S1 subunit of the IBV spike protein.",

            "text": "Since the early 1980s, IBV has been continuously isolated in China, and QX genotype has become the prevalent genotype [12,13,14]. Our previous study showed that isolates obtained from Southwestern China between 2008 and 2016 mainly belong to the QX genotype [12,15]. Other reports have shown that QX-type IBVs epidemic is a major problem in the poultry industry in Europe, Japan, Korea, Russia, Africa, and the Middle East [16,17,18]. However, even with the wide use of IBV vaccines, such as H120 and 4/91 for QX-type IBV infection, immune failure occurred frequently [4,19]. QX-like IBV has become a challenge to the prevention and control IBV. Therefore, it is crucial to gain a better understanding of the antigenicity and pathogenesis of QX-like IBV. Previously, comparative studies have been conducted to elucidate differential pathogenicity among two QX-like IBVs with 94.1% similarities of the S1 gene [20]. Very minor changes in the IBV genome can lead to differences in pathogenicity [21]; therefore, comparative studies involving more QX-type IBVs are required. The present study was conducted with the aim to elucidate the S1 gene differences of eight QX-type IBVs isolated from vaccinated chicken flocks in Southwestern China and describe its antigenicity and pathogenicity characteristics.",

Of these isolates, the Sczy3 strain was identified as QX-type and SCZY3-serotype by a previous study (GenBank number: JF732903.1) [12]. The other seven field strains were isolated from clinical samples (trachea, lung, and kidney) of dead/diseased chickens from Southwestern China that displayed respiratory symptoms and/or nephritis during 2015\u20132017. Virus isolation was carried out by being inoculated into the allantoic cavity of 9-to-10-day-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chicken embryos with 0.2 mL of 10% tissue homogenates. The embryos were incubated at 37 \u00b0C and examined twice daily for their viability. The allantoic fluids wereharvestedafter36 h of incubation, and three blind passages were conducted. Detection methods of presence of IBV were determined based on the previous literature [12]. The 50% embryo infectious doses (EID50) were determined as previously described (Reed and Muench, 1938) [22]. SPF chicken embryos were obtained from the Beijing Merial Vital Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China) and were hatched at our laboratory (Lab of Chicken Infectious Disease, College of Veterinary Medicine, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, China). The details of the seven field isolates are shown in Table 1.",

In our study, eight QX-type IBVs with 94.3%\u201399.2% nucleotide identity were classified into the same serotype, but showed a minor difference in antigenicity among those strains. AntigenMap analysis showed that subgroup 2, which includes the Sczy3 strain and field isolates MS/17, XSH/17, DYYJ/17, GH/15, and PZ/17 had tight antigenicity, which has been majorly isolated since 2017. Meanwhile, subgroup 1 (MS/15 isolate) and 3 (DYW/16 isolate) were separated in 2015 and 2016. These results indicated that there areantigenic variations in different IBV strains over time, andminor changes in the S1 gene maycause antigenic variation. For example, the two strains of DYW/16 and PZ/17 shared 99.2% nucleotide identity, but were classified into different subgroups. However, the data of QX-IBVs used in this study are limited, and this map will be expanded further when more data becomes available in the future. It has been reported that antigenic relatedness values were influenced by hypervariable regions (HVR) in the S1 subunit of IBV S protein [8,35]. Therefore, antigenic variations mapped by AntigenMap may be related to the nucleotide mutations in HVR, which were located at residues 23aa\u201365aa and 120aa\u2013393aa in the S1 protein of the eight QX-type isolates. Furthermore, amino acid substitution between S (Ser) residues and other amino acids\u2019 residues, such as N (Asn) and P (Pro) in HVR, were frequently observed among the seven field isolates, but whether this has an effect on antigenic variations is unclear.",

Such as the S1 gene, similarity is 99.2% between the DYW/16 and PZ/17 strains, indicating some key nucleotide mutation in the IBV S1 gene can lead to difference in pathogenicity [21]. Previous studies have shown that the binding properties of S proteins have been hypothesized to be associated with differences in pathogenicity [36]. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the spike protein of the M41 strain overlapped with HVR in the S1 gene was critical for attachment in the spike protein of IBV, and Y43H change in RBD of recombinant ArkDPC S1 proteins allows for enhanced binding to the trachea [10,35].

            "text": "The pathogenicity of IBV is determined by several factors, which may involve replication efficacy, tissue tropism, and the ability to deal with the host\u2019s immune system. In the present study, RT-qPCR examination and tissue lesions both showed that the elevated levels of viral replication efficacy and tissue lesions in the trachea and kidney are associated with increased pathogenicity of IBV strains.The mechanisms of tissue tropism characteristics in different IBVs were elucidated, nephropathogenicB1648 strain disseminated to internal organs via a cell-free and -associated viremia with KUL01 + monocyticcells as important carrier cells, resulting in serious kidney lesions, whereas respiratory M41 does not do this [37]. The mechanism of replication in monocytic cells might be recruited to cause kidney lesion and even high mortality in chickens infected with five QX-type IBVs. Besides, it has been reported that QX-type IBV caused greater innate immune responses and induced greater apoptosis in CEK than the M41 strain, which is also a major contributing factor to the pathological outcome [38]. Therefore, QX-type IBVs have a strong ability to combat the host immune system, causing tissue lesion and even death. However, the mechanism responsible for the differences in the combat abilityremains unclear for different QX-type IBVs. Although, the S gene, replicase gene, and 5a accessory gene have also been reported to be responsible for IBV virulence [11,39], this still cannot completely explain the mechanism behind the virulence differences of IBVs. The key gene and amino acid residues associated with IBV virulence and antigenicity should be verified via new methods, such as the reverse-genetics technique.",

The results showed that the eight QX-type IBV isolates belonged to the same serotype, but the antigenic variation over time was observed. Different pathogenicity, replication efficacy, and tissue lesions in 10-day-old SPF chickens were also observed among QX-type isolates. In addition, the eight strains were distantly associated with H120 and 4/91 vaccine strains with 76.5%\u201378.7% nucleotide identity, suggesting the need for a new vaccine strain to prevent and control IB.The immune serum of two IBVs, DYYJ/17 and DYW/16, displayed good neutralization activity; therefore they have the potential to be developed as candidate vaccine strains.",
