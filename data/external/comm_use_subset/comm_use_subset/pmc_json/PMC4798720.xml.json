For many viruses, however, the immune response extends beyond that necessary for viral clearance and creates disease symptoms. For example, infection with certain influenza virus (IAV) strains results in lung recruitment of high numbers of neutrophils (and other leukocytes) leading to a fast-progressing viral pneumonia and extensive lung damage [1, 2]. Neutrophil recruitment at late stages of infection can also lead to CNS pathology during coronavirus infection [3]. Virus-specific CD4+ T cells substantially contribute to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-induced bronchiolitis in children [4]. Further, early RSV vaccination strategies actually enhanced disease due to excessive cellular infiltration of the lungs and subsequent pulmonary injury [5]. Thus, the immune response, essential for eliminating pathogens, also produces disease if not appropriately modulated.",

Originally named \u201ccytokine synthesis inhibitory factor,\u201d IL-10 impedes the production of a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines secreted by antiviral T cells for the control of infection, including IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, and MIP-1\u03b1 [10, 11]. While IL-10 restrains host pathology caused by the immune response during acute infections with IAV, RSV, or coronavirus [12\u201314], it can also limit viral clearance leading to chronic infection [15\u201317]. Accordingly, several viruses have evolved homologs of IL-10 or its receptor (IL-10R) to manipulate the host immune environment and enable persistence [18\u201320].",

The role of such poly-secretory CD8+ T cells appears to be dictated by both viral tropism and the site of infection, but the principle function ascribed to these cells is suppression of inflammatory tissue damage rather than direct alteration of viral replication. For example: antibody (Ab) blockade of the IL-10 receptor (IL-10R) during IAV infection increases lung inflammation and mortality without reducing viral burden [21]. Similarly, RSV-activated IL-10+ CD8+ effector T cells prevent RSV-induced inflammatory lung pathology [23]. During coronavirus-infection, IL-10+ CD8+ T cells limit CNS demyelination and slightly increase viral burden as a necessary cost [12]. The extent to which localized IL-10 production by T cells occurs in other acute viral infections in organs more resilient to inflammatory damage is uncertain.",

Intriguingly, IL-10+ T cells more closely localize to viral replicative foci than do the bulk population of antiviral CD8+ T cells in the tissue. Further, IL-10+ T cells move in paths adjacent to areas of virus infection, and neutralization of IL-10 enhances virus spread and shapes the innate immune population located adjacent to these foci.

CD4+ T cells comprised the second largest GFP+ population (~15%) on day 6, with minimal contributions from dendritic cells (DCs, CD11c+, CD11b-) or macrophages (CD11b+CD11c-). GFP+ populations were virtually identical in Vert-X reporter mice (shown 6 d.p.i., Fig 1F), confirming CD8+ T cells as the most prevalent IL-10-producing cells recovered from VV-infected skin on day 6 p.i. On a per-cell basis on day 6 p.i., CD8+ T cells expressed slightly higher levels of the GFP than CD4+ T cells, which were, in turn, higher than the very small number of GFP+ macrophages or DCs (Fig 1G). Over time, the mean fluorescence intensity of T cells was roughly equivalent, until CD4+ T cells acquired higher MFI at late times in infection (Fig 1H). We confirmed that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were producing IL-10 protein by intracellular cytokine staining (S1 Fig).",

All skin-localized CD8+ T cells expressed T-bet (a transcription factor required for effector T cell differentiation [31, 32]), regardless of IL-10 expression (determined by intracellular staining, gray shaded histogram = IL-10- cells, black line = IL-10+ cells) (Fig 3A, far left, top panel). In contrast, while IL-10+ CD8+ T cells nearly uniformly expressed high levels of T-bet, total CD4 T cells contained both T-bethigh and T-betlow cells (Fig 3A, far left, bottom panel). While there were clear populations of CD69high and CD69low IL-10- T cells, all IL-10+ T cells expressed high levels of the activation marker CD69 (Fig 3A). In both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, effector molecules IFN-\u03b3 and Granzyme B were markedly higher in IL-10+ cells (Fig 3B). We did not detect regulatory CD8+ T cells in the ear (S2 Fig).

Using MPM imaging, we previously described the location and mobility of endogenously activated virus-specific T cells in the skin after ec. VV-infected mice [26]. Although all CD8+ T cells that immigrated into infected skin were Ag-specific effectors, many cells did not accrue at the border of lesions but instead occupied areas of the tissue that were not overtly infected as determined by virus-driven fluorescence expression [26]. Since we did not observe this pattern in IL-10gfp+ reporter mice (in which GFP-producing cells appeared to predominantly localize to lesions), we next used MPM imaging to compare the distribution of IL-10gfp+ cells to adoptively transferred virus-specific T cells endogenously activated in IL-10gfp-reporter mice (Fig 5). We first transferred non-IL-10gfp+ dsRed+ OT-I CD8+ T cells (antigen specificity = Kb-SIINFEKL) into na\u00efve IL-10gfp reporter mice, then infected ec. On day 6 p.i. (rVV expression of BFP is pseudocolored magenta), we detected both IL-10gfp+ cells (green) and IL-10gfp-/- adoptively transferred OT-I CD8+ T cells (red) at the border of viral lesions (Fig 5A and S2 Movie). We also consistently observed areas of the skin distal from viral keratinocytic lesions with heavy infiltration of dsRed+ OT-I CD8+ T cells, but no or few IL-10gfp+ cells (Fig 5B and S3 Movie).",

It is likely that many other immune cells types contribute synergistically to viral clearance. Here, we show that CCR2+ monocytes associate closely with virus-infected cells in the skin (even becoming infected (S7 Movie)), and also clearly aid in viral control (Fig 7). Interestingly, nitric oxide has been shown to prevent productive replication of VV in some macrophages [41].

Because VV has a proclivity for replicating/disseminating in inflamed skin (e.g. in individuals with atopic dermatitis [49, 50]), IL-10 could also influence VV replication by reducing VV-induced inflammation. Darling et al. recently used tape stripping and ovalbumin-sensitization to create atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions and then infected mice with VV [51].

Intraperitoneal infection of IL-10 -/- mice or Ab-mediated IL-10R blockade decreased ovarian VV titers slightly at 7 d.p.i. [53, 54]. Byrd and colleagues recently reexamined VV replication in human macrophages (previously described as non-permissive for productive VV replication [55, 56]) differentiating them into M1 and M2 polarized phenotypes [57]. VV replicated in both cell types, and importantly, the addition of exogenous IL-10 dramatically decreased VV replication in M2 macrophages in a STAT3-dependent manner.

Mice were anesthetized with avertin or isoflurane. Ears were immobilized on an imaging platform and bathed in warm saline; a 20x dipping objective (NA 1.00) was dipped in saline overlying ears for image acquisition. For imaging BFP/collagen/eGFP, imaging was performed in sequential mode with the first laser tuned to 900 nm and the second tuned to 800 nm for BFP excitation. Emitted fluorescence was collected with a four-channel non-descanned detector. For blue/green channels, wavelength separation was accomplished with a dichroic mirror at 495 nm followed by emission filters of 460/50 nm bandpass and 525/50 nm bandpass. For most movies (e.g. when time was critical), images were acquired using 2x zoom, using a 3-\u03bcm z-step for a total depth of 150 \u03bcm for 1 min intervals between series (needed to switch lasers). For 3D reconstructions, images were acquired at 1x zoom using 1024x1024 resolution and 1 \u03bcm z-steps for a total depth of 80\u2013300 \u03bcms.",
