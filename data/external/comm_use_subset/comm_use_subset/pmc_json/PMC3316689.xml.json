For standardizing the quantification, a plasmid (NPSC3.1) containing the HBoV NP-1 gene was used in serial dilutions covering a range of 6 logs. The criteria for a positive reaction were defined as the cycle threshold <40 cycles and fluorescence count >0.5. The minimum genome viral load that would allow reproducible quantification was 10 copies per reaction, which corresponds to 500 copies/mL of respiratory tract aspirates.

The median viral load which was found in patients with sole HBoV infection was not higher than those who had co-infection with other respiratory viruses (p = 0.2517). A recent review suggested if serum samples were not available for PCR, and then the probable next best option was the quantitative PCR with a cutoff of >104 copies/mL of respiratory tract secretions [14]. Several previous studies reported that increased serum HBoV IgM and IgG had been found in most of patients who had high HBoV load (>104 copies/mL) in respiratory tract secretions, which was associated with respiratory symptoms [2], [15], [16]. Therefore the HBoV-positive samples were divided into 2 non-overlapping populations: one group of 15 samples with a high viral load (>104 copies/mL) and one group of 16 samples with a low viral load (<104 copies/mL).",

The variation of HBoV detection in these studies was likely attributable to multiple factors, such as patient's age, season, geographic location, primer sensitivity, laboratory technique, true variation in incidence of HBoV, and methods used in sample collection. Some studies suggested that persistent virus shedding was therefore being a reasonable explanation for the high occurrence of HBoV in healthy subjects [20]. Moreover failure for follow-up on HBoV-positive asymptomatic children also led to high occurrence of HBoV detection in asymptomatic children. Recently, an in vitro study of HBoV infection in pseudostratified epithelial cells was established to confirm the virus uptake, transcription, and replication [30].
