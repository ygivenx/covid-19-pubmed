A particular benefit of tracing is that it allows targeting of control, at the cost of effort spent on finding the individuals at risk.",

The inclusion of the triplewise model shows that disagreements between pairwise models and simulation in the clustered network are largely due to higher order structure, however these effects are nowhere near as large as the differences between mean-field and pairwise models.

We therefore use the results of Panes A and B to rule out the use of mean-field and standard pairwise models. This leaves the improved pairwise model, which we systematically compare to simulation in Panes C and D. Since both the improved pairwise model and simulation depend on underlying parameters in the same way, they form a complementary pair of approaches to the study of contact tracing in clustered populations.

This gives the results in Figure 4, which show that clustering increases the efficacy of contact tracing at a given success rate at one infectious generation, but not at 0.1 generations, depending on the actual tracing success rate. Pane C shows this variety of responses, where clustering is more effective for large success rates at this small time\u2014the very large rates require still smaller times to demonstrate this effect, since after 0.1 disease generations they have passed into the regime where clustering leads to less effective tracing.",

Clustering increases the number of  pairs present at a given endemic state, and contact tracing can be viewed as hyper-parasitism on the network of infected individuals. This means that clustering can be expected to enhance the efficacy of contact tracing by increasing the neighbourhood size of the infected sub-network. On the other hand, to explain a constant level of endemic infection as clustering is increased, a larger underlying rate of transmission must be present, which will undermine tracing as an individual left untouched by a wave of tracing will reinfect their immediate neighbourhood more quickly. Exactly which parameter choices allow either effect to dominate is not clear, except that lower levels of tracing success always cause clustering to increase the efficacy of tracing.

At this point, stochastic variability in simulations has become highly significant and so we would not expect the two models to agree, since the pairwise equations should only hold in the limit where stochastic effects are negligible.
