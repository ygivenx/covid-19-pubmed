News reports have the potential to modify a community\u2019s knowledge of emerging infectious diseases, and affect people\u2019s attitudes and behaviours during infectious disease outbreaks [1, 2]. People informed by media reports can take precautions ranging from washing hands, wearing protective masks to avoiding social contact with infected individuals, to reduce their susceptibility. Informed infective individuals will also take measures to protect themselves from being exposed to others to reduce infectivity. It has been shown that behaviour change during infectious disease outbreaks can curb the effects of infectious diseases in populations [3].",

            "text": "In recent years, a growing number of studies have focused on understanding and quantifying the impact of such behaviour influencing factors on the spread of infectious diseases [4\u201318]. A number of studies have employed mathematical models to assess the impact of media reports on emerging infectious disease prevention and control [4, 5, 19\u201330]. Recently, Greenhalgh et al. [19] presented a brief and nice commentary on the literature related to awareness and their effects on the dynamics of diseases. In summary, it has been found that there are three main methods being used to incorporate behaviour change in mathematical models due to awareness of disease. In the first method, the incidence rate of the disease is reduced by some factors that depend on the numbers of infected individuals, hospitalized individuals or exposed individuals, due to education about preventative knowledge of the disease through media coverage. The common choice of the reduction factors is a saturated [4, 6, 31, 32] or exponential [20, 24, 27] growth function. For example, Liu et al. [27] incorporated an exponential decreasing factor \u03b20 = \u03b2e\u2212a1E\u2212a2I\u2212a3H into the transmission coefficient (with exposed (E), infectious (I), hospitalized (H)) to illustrate the possible mechanism for multiple outbreaks of SARS due to the psychological impact. Cui et al. [32] used the general nonlinear incidence function \u03bc1 \u2212 \u03bc2\nf(I) to represent the media and education impact on the spread of the infectious disease. In [5], the authors focused on simple endemic models by modelling the contact rate as a function of the available information on the present and the past disease prevalence.",

Further, in [8], the media reporting is introduced as a separate compartment in a mathematical model and the susceptible population is divided into three awareness levels, each with a different infection rate. In [18], the authors considered the interaction of disease outbreak and media impact by formulating a susceptible-infected-hospitalized-recovered framework of population. By extension, susceptible and infected populations are subdivided into aware and unaware since individuals modified their behaviors to reduce their transmissibility and infectivity, and the dynamics of media reports was incorporated by considering how media was influenced by the numbers of infected and hospitalized individuals.",

On one hand, media reporting influences the public awareness of the disease and affects the effectiveness of prevention measures. On the other hand, the severity of the disease has an impact on the degree of mass media reporting. We\u2019ve known that, in the first and third methods, media impact is modelled through the inclusion of a \u201cmedia function\u201d, which is proportional to the number of infected individuals and/or the level of media reports, to reduce the incidence rate through increased protective behaviour.

Disease progression is characterized by an SEIR model of which the transmission rate is modified by a media function affected by the media reports and also the number of infected individuals. The model can be recognized as the combination of the first method and the third method of modelling. In our model, we formulate the novel media function f(I, M, \u03b11, \u03b12) with \u03b1i (i = 1, 2) denoting the weight of infected individuals and media reports, and examine their effects on disease spread. Further, we investigate an optimal control problem in order to seek the optimal reporting intensity of information to minimize the number of infected individuals (and costs). We parameterize the proposed model on the basis of the 2009 A/H1N1 data in Shaanxi province of China, and estimate the basic reproduction number and other unknown parameters. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to identify model parameters that most affect the peak magnitude of the epidemic, as well as the total number of infections over the entire epidemic.",

Using data extracted from the initial laboratory-confirmed cases of 2009 A/H1N1 that were admitted to the 8th hospital of Xi\u2019an for the period 3rd September to 21st September, and the Least Square Method, we estimated the parameters shown in Table 1 and Fig 1, with R-square value being 0.9588, 0.9577, 0.9583, using three different media functions f0, f1, f2. Note that the goodness of fit is significant, but similar for each case. This is not unexpected as the data spans 19 days only. Also, however, as shown in our discussion of R0, during the early stages of an epidemic there is little effect due to mass media reports. Therefore it is reasonable that the model fits and parameter values are similar comparing the model with (f1, or f2) and without (f0) media.",

With increases in \u03b11 or \u03b12, both the peak magnitude of the number of infected individuals and the total number of infections over a year decrease greatly, indicating that the media effect reduces outbreak severity. To identify key parameters that influence the disease infection dynamics, we use Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) and partial rank correlation coefficients (PRCCs) to examine the dependence of the peak magnitude and total number of infections on corresponding model parameters. It follows from Figs 6 and 7 that, despite the fact that the baseline value of the transmission rate \u03b2 and the recovery rate \u03b3 are the most sensitive parameters to the peak magnitude and the total number of infections, parameters related to the media coverage \u03b11, \u03b12, \u03c1, \u03b4 can also significantly affect the results. In particular, increases in the weight of infective cases \u03b11 and media reports \u03b12 in the media function will significantly reduce the peak magnitude and total number infections. Also, decreases in the media reporting rate \u03c1, and increases in the media waning rate will lead to more severe outbreaks.",

However, with the optimal media reporting rate the optimal epidemic curves are quite different. In particular, the shape of the optimal control u1* and u2* are similar, but u2* is greater than u1*, causing the optimal solution of system (4) with f2 to be less than the optimal solution of system (4) with f1. This means that there is optimal media reporting function such that the number of infected individuals and costs reach the minimum, which helps design an optimal news releasing patterns that mostly affect individuals\u2019 behaviour changes, and hence result in the infection significantly decline.",

Through the inclusion of the media compartment and the modified transmission rate \u03b2f(I, M) we can use model (1) to study the effects of I and M separately. In this study, we focus our work on understanding the media impact on the transmission of 2009 H1N1 in Shaanxi, China, and explore the efficiency of optimal control on the media reporting rate. Ultimately, we find that response to the number of infected individuals I will lead to greater reductions in the peak magnitude and the total number of infections. We also find that the optimal media reporting intensity should be enhanced early in the outbreak, be kept at the maximum level during the time period around the peak of the epidemic, and then be decreased after the epidemic reaches a low level to ensure a minimal level of infection in a population.",
