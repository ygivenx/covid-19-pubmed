Indeed, bats have been shown to act as reservoirs for viruses that otherwise result in fatal outcomes in humans, including rabies virus, ebola virus, Nipah virus, Hendra virus, and MERS-CoV virus (5). Each year, new viruses are isolated from bats (6, 7). This suggests that bats have co-evolved with these viruses and are able to control and/or contain them (8). However, the mechanisms involved remain to be fully elucidated.",

This has been thought to play a role in their ability to cope with infections as studies in mice with high metabolic rates have suggested enhanced immune response, as evidenced by increased IgM production, leukocyte proliferation and mass of lymphatic organs (9). In addition, it has been suggested that elevated body temperature resulting from high metabolic rate may help bats control infections (10). On the other hand, other studies have suggested that bats' low metabolism during the day could lead to immune response suppression thereby allowing better co-adaptation with viruses (11, 12).",

Study of the bat immune system has been hampered by the lack of tools and resources available. The difficulty to establish bat colonies similar to mouse colonies has forced scientists to work with wild caught bats, which inevitably results in significant bat-to-bat variations, making data interpretation difficult. Furthermore, limited tools including bat cell lines, and bat reagents (bat molecules, specific antibodies, etc.) are available. Therefore, most of the knowledge accumulated so far has derived from genome and transcriptome analyses including full genome sequencing, RNA-Seq and real time PCR (13).",

Common innate immune defense mechanisms are found in bats such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (15, 16). Various types of interferons (IFN) have also been described in bats. The type I IFN response to viral infections was found to be similar to that of other mammals (17, 18). Interestingly, high expression level of type I IFN \u201cIFN\u03c9\u201d was detected in bats, which is not common in other mammals (8). Type II IFN or IFN\u03b3 was found to affect the replication of Hendra virus in black flying fox Pteropus alecto cells and of Sendai virus in cells from Brazilian free-tail bat Tadarida brasiliensis (19) whereas Type III IFN was reported to be produced in bats injected with Tioman virus (20). These findings suggest that bats express diverse IFN pathways that could play an important role in controlling viral infections.",

Genomic and transcriptomic approaches have identified the presence of T cell subsets (23). In a previous study, using cross-reactive antibodies specific to transcription factors, we were able to identify CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations, and reported the unusual dominant proportion of CD8+ T cells in P. alecto secondary lymphoid organs, which may suggest that bat's adaptive immune system is geared toward controlling intracellular pathogens, typically viruses (22). Other studies have described the detection of high titres of circulating IgG antibodies in bats (24). Transcripts of IgM, IgE, IgA, and several IgG subclasses were also detected. Of interest, IgG antibodies were found in abundance in maternal lacteal secretions as opposed to IgA predominance in other mammals, which may have important implications for the transfer of maternal immunity and protection in the bat progeny against systemic infections (25, 26). Presence of IgD in some microbats but not in megabats has also been reported, illustrating a significant variability in antibody species across bats species (8).",

A shift of a defined cell subset compared to unstained sample was clearly observed for 15 of the antibodies tested (Tables 1, 2). However, some of these antibodies (e.g., CD4 RM44) were excluded due to non-specific binding, as evidenced by very high percentages of positive cells (in the range of 80\u201390%) (Figure S1). In addition, others did not give a clear and distinct population upon flow cytometry analysis and have thus been excluded as well (Figure S1). Eventually, seven antibodies were deemed bona fide cross-reactive antibodies for the study of B cell populations (Table 2).

Among the B cells, two different subsets could be identified based on their CD27 and CD21 expression that may correspond to memory and mature B cells, respectively. However, due to the lack of an appropriate Fc block, it is plausible that antibodies could bind to Fc receptors (FcR) expressed at the surface of myeloid cells, thereby giving rise to false positive. To test this hypothesis, intracellular staining with anti-Ig antibody was performed, as well as a combination of surface and intracellular staining. The staining profiles obtained were comparable to that obtained when surface staining alone was performed, thus indicating that the cell population identified very likely consists of B cells, not myeloid cells (Figure 2). Furthermore, the CD3+/\u2212 sIg+ B cell population was confirmed by the detection of CD19 mRNA by Prime Flow (Figure 1B). Finally, using cross-reactive antibodies against bat Ig, MHC-II and CD11b, CD11b\u2212 MHC-II+ sIg+ cells were FACS sorted and examined under field scanning electron microscope (SEM). SEM images showed that these cells display a morphology that is similar to that of B cells from humans and mice in terms of size and gross appearance (Figure 3) (27), which further supports that our antibody staining strategy allows identification and study of the bat B cell populations.",

Overall, higher percentages of T cells than B cells were found in the PBMC and spleen, whereas higher percentages of B cells than T cells were seen in the bone marrow (Figure 4). The percentages of NK cells in the four bats ranged between 10 and 16% in spleen and between 5 and 11% in bone marrow (Figure 4).

Similarly, higher percentages of B cells compared to T cells are typically found in mice PBMC, whereas the reverse is seen in bat PBMC (Table 3).

Lymphocytes were first gated based on forward and side scatter distribution. Three cell population subsets (A, B, and C) were then distinguished based on their expression of CD11b and MHC-II markers (Figure 5A).

Single cell suspensions prepared from P. alecto bone marrow (BM), spleen (SPL), PBMC and lymph nodes (LN) were incubated with a calcium sensor dye, Indo-1 which has a peak emission at 475 nm that shifts to 410 nm when bound to calcium. Indo-1 treated cells were then surface-stained with cross-reactive antibodies specific to MHC-II and CD11b, and with goat anti-bat Ig. The samples were also incubated with donkey anti-goat secondary antibody. Binding of the secondary antibody to goat anti-bat Ig primary antibody is expected to lead to B cell receptor (BCR) cross-linking (30) that results in Ca2+ entry inside the cells (31). Ca2+ influx inside Indo-1 pre-treated cells can be quantified at 410 nm over time. As described in the previous section, lymphocytes were gated based on forward and side scatter distribution. B cells, T cells and myeloid cells were gated as CD11b\u2212 MHC-II+, CD11b\u2212 MHC-II\u2212, and CD11b+ MHC-II\u2212, respectively. All three populations exhibited strong increase in calcium influx upon stimulation with Ionomycin (positive control) in all the samples tested (Figures 6A, B). Samples where anti-bat Ig antibody was omitted did not show any significant increase in calcium influx (negative control). Significant increase in calcium influx was observed with B cells but not T cells or myeloid cells, incubated with anti-bat Ig antibody (Figures 6A, B). The strongest signals were detected with B cells from SPL and LN (Figure 6B). This latter observation may be explained by the fact that these lymphoid organs harbor a greater proportion of mature B cells compared to the bone marrow, which is expected to contain predominantly progenitor, and immature B cells.",

The cross-reactive antibody panel that was selected for flow cytometry analysis of P. alecto samples, was applied on E. spelaea bone marrow and spleen samples. B, T, myeloid and NK cell subsets were clearly identified demonstrating that our antibody panel can be employed for flow cytometry analysis of adaptive immune cell populations in different bat species (Figure 7A).

The percentages of NK cells in the bone marrow and spleen of E. spelaea were also rather different from those seen in P. alecto bats. Less than 10% of NK cells was indeed seen in the spleens from E. spelaea (Figure 7), vs. 10\u201316% in P. alecto (Figure 4).

As for B cells, similar percentages of B cells in the spleen (close to 40%) were seen for both studies, however the B cell population in bone marrow from this study revealed a percentage close to 60 vs. 30% in our previous study. The discrepancies between both studies may stem from a different immune status between the two batches of wild caught bats, which were obtained from two different trips at different time of the year. Indeed, status of the immune system in these bats could be affected by past or ongoing infections, which may also be seasonal. Together with the limited sample size, variability in health status of wild caught bats inevitably leads to great variations among the data collected, thereby making difficult their interpretation. This underscores the need to establish bats colonies housed in a controlled and clean environment, allowing scientists to study the bat immune system at \u201csteady state.\u201d Making use of the recently established colony of E. spelaea bats, we analyzed the T and B cell content in their bone marrow and spleen. Data revealed striking differences in term of B, T and NK cell percentages in the bone marrow of E. spelaea compared to P. alecto bats, which may be explained either by inherent differences between both bat species and/or by a different immune status between colony bats and wild caught bats. Nevertheless, the consistent finding of a significantly higher percentage of T cells in bat spleen and PBMC compared to other mammals including mice and humans, strongly suggests that bats adaptive immune system has evolved to respond effectively to intracellular pathogens, which may explain their unique ability to cope with a large variety of viruses, hence acting as healthy reservoirs.",

            "text": "The predominance of T cells in bats does however not exclude a role for B cells. Our work suggests that bat B cells are functional and are capable of responding to LPS stimulation. LPS has been mainly known as a TLR4 agonist capable of triggering an innate inflammatory response in vertebrates (42, 43). LPS treatment studies have previously been carried out in pteropid bat cell lines (44) as well as in primary bat cells (8), and demonstrated the presence of a TLR4 response in bats. However, LPS is also a T cell-independent B cell stimulatory molecule, and as such is able to induce a polyclonal B cell proliferation response (28). Here, leveraging on this latter property, we found that LPS-treated bats displayed a greater proportion of B cells in their spleen and blood compared to untreated bats. It was rather surprising to detect an increase in the proportion of B cell population only 5 h post-LPS challenge, as typically LPS-induced B cell proliferation takes much longer (29). Wild caught bats are exposed to multiple bacterial pathogens. Therefore, it is plausible that the bat immune system, including the innate and adaptive components, has evolved to become particularly fast at responding to LPS. Furthermore, we showed that upon cross-linking of their BCR bat B cells responded by releasing Ca2+ from their ER stores, further supporting that bat B cells are fully functional.",

The identification of a panel of cross-reactive antibodies allows better characterization of the various adaptive immune cell populations in bats.
