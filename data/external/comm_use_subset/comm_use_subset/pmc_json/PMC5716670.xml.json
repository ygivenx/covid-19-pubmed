Circulating T-cell numbers in surviving patients increased from around 5 months and naive T cells increased from around 6 to 7 months after transplantation (Fig 2).15 The correlation between naive cell numbers determined by using different flow cytometric strategies is shown in Fig E2 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org. In general, cell numbers achieved did not reach the normal age-related range (see Table E3 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). There was a continuing increase in naive cell numbers up to 24 months and then maintenance at a relatively steady level. Low numbers of T cells in P2 were likely caused by immunosuppression. No other patients received long-term immunosuppression. TRECs showed a similar time course to naive T cells (Fig 3, A). There was a relatively poor correlation between TREC and naive CD4 and CD8 cell counts (see Fig E3). Normal TCR diversity, as demonstrated by V\u03b2 spectratyping of CD3 cells, was achieved in 7 patients, including those with atypical cDGS and an abnormal spectratype before transplantation (see Fig E4 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). An abnormal spectratype persists in 3 patients (P2, P6, and P9). Further analysis showed a normal CD4 spectratype in P6, whereas both CD4 and CD8 spectratypes were abnormal in P9. Mitogen responsiveness to PHA (Fig 3, B) improved in all patients but decreased again with immunosuppression in P2. For unknown reasons, it never normalized in P1. This patient had good evidence for thymopoiesis on biopsy and blood analysis. After primary EBV infection, PBMCs from patient 3 showed the ability to produce a good IFN-\u03b3 response against an autologous EBV-transformed LCL but responded significantly less well to a third-party LCL (Fig 3, C). Phenotyping of circulating cells with markers of Treg cells was performed in 5 patients (P2, P4, P6, P9, and P10) and showed these cells to be present in low absolute numbers, although when expressed as the proportion of CD4 cells, there was no difference to a healthy age range\u2013matched control group (Fig 4, A and B, and see Fig E5 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). In P2, P4, P6, and P9 the proportions of CD45RA+ Treg cells were 6%, 32%, 8%, and 44% respectively, whereas in control subjects the median level was 67% (range, 27% to 94%). The functional ability of CD4+FoxP3+ cells in 6 patients (P2, P4, P5, P6, P8, and P9) in terms of CTLA4 upregulation on activation and transendocytosis of CD80 was comparable with adult control samples (Fig 4, C and D, and see Figs E6 and E7 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). In P9 spectratyping performed on sorted Treg cells showed a diverse repertoire (see Fig E8 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org).",

Biopsy specimens in a further 2 cases (P8 and P9) showed less well-developed thymic architecture but definite evidence of cortical thymopoiesis, as defined by the presence of CD1a+ and Ki67+ cortical thymocytes (data not shown). Biopsy specimens with no evidence of thymopoiesis were found in P1 (first transplantation), P2, P5, and P7. In P2 and P5 it was likely the biopsy specimens \u201cmissed\u201d thymus in the muscle because there was later appearance of thymic emigrants in the blood indicating thymopoiesis. In P7, who died of CMV, a biopsy specimen taken at 4 months showed viable thymic epithelium but very little thymopoiesis (see Fig E11, A-D, in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). CMV could not be demonstrated in this thymic tissue (data not shown). P12 died very early after transplantation, and a postmortem examination of transplanted thymus revealed viable epithelium with extensive neovascularization (see Fig E11, E and F).",

This confirms and adds to the results in the previously reported series,6, 7 with the survival rate and level of immune reconstitution achieved being similar between the 2 series. The proportion of children with autoimmune complications is higher in the present study, but because numbers are relatively small, it is difficult to know whether this difference is significant. In the present study novel data documenting changes in the cellular composition of thymic slices during culture are provided, as well as data on TREC levels achieved and numbers, phenotype, and function of Treg cells. There is also detailed histologic evidence on thymic biopsy specimens to confirm full maturation of mTECs. Although only 1 of the patients in this study did not have a recognized genetic cause for DGS, the previous studies included a number of such cases, including those with maternal diabetes, and showed that such patients have an equivalent outcome.",

In most cases normal mitogen responsiveness was achieved, and a diverse repertoire was demonstrated on TCR spectratyping. Circulating Treg cells could be detected in proportions similar to those in control children, although at lower absolute numbers, and their CTLA4-mediated function was shown to be normal. Apart from one case in which an IFN-\u03b3 response to EBV was shown, antigen-specific T-cell responses were not assayed in this study. Such responses were studied to tetanus and Candida species antigens in the previous series and showed positive responses in all but 1 of the surviving patients.7 Most patients with follow-up of more than 2 years have been able to stop immunoglobulin, and in those tested thus far, all have normal antibody responses to tetanus and 2 of 3 have normal antibody responses to conjugated pneumococcal vaccine. IgA deficiency was corrected in all but 1 patient. Numbers of class-switched memory B cells remain relatively low in some patients, but to assess the significance of this finding, longer follow-up is needed to determine whether the proportions increase with time. The reason for the suboptimal numbers of T cells achieved in most patients is not clear. It could be that insufficient thymic tissue was transplanted, but against this is the fact that there was no correlation in this study or in the North American series8 between the amount of tissue transplanted and the eventual T-cell or naive T-cell counts achieved. Nor was there any association between counts and the type of medium used for culture, the use of ATG, or the presence of chance overlap of HLA antigens between donor and recipient.",

Autoimmunity, a common complication, can often be managed relatively easily, but a proportion of children can experience serious consequences. Further work is required to understand better the pathogenesis of this problem. As newborn screening programs for SCID expand, more patients might require this treatment. Further work is needed to streamline the labor-intensive process requiring specialized facilities for generating and transplanting thymus. A model of human thymus transplantation into the nude mouse might be useful in further exploring this.20 Other patients who might benefit from this approach include infants with SCID who do not have immune reconstitution after HSCT or gene therapy because of thymic insufficiency.Clinical implicationsThymus transplantation should be the treatment of choice for infants with cDGS, except possibly in those with severe pre-existing viral infections. The risk of autoimmune complications is a significant issue for survivors, and further work is needed to understand this better.",
