In our previous study, dental problems delayed the initiation of IFN therapy for a maximum of 105 days [7]. HCV-infected patients treated with IFN therapy should be managed by intensive oral care because of lower resistance to infection during the therapy. With regard to the painful OLP, it is just conceivable that an oral cavity with HCV infection is likely to become less healthy than one without HCV infection. It is necessary for a hepatologist to educate patients regarding oral hygiene as well as provide treatment of liver disease, so that the quality of life of patients with HCV-related liver disease does not decrease.
