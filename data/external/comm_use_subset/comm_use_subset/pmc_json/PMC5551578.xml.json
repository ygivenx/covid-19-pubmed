B cells recognize and respond to pathogen-derived antigens through surface B cell receptors (BCRs). The BCR has two interrelated functions in B cell activation. The first is to initiate signal cascades that result in the transcription of a variety of genes associated with B cell activation (Pierce and Liu, 2010). The second is to mediate antigen uptake and processing, leading to antigen presentation to T cells within the MHC class II context and full activation of the B cells (Lanzavecchia, 1985). Similarly, BCR-mediated antigen internalization has been shown to facilitate the presentation of lipid antigens in the context of CD1d, which can result in the recruitment of iNKT cell help (Barral et al., 2008; Leadbetter et al., 2008) or the transport of TLR agonists, resulting in TLR7 or TLR9 signaling (Marshak-Rothstein, 2006; Hou et al., 2011).",

In mice, it has long been known that, even in the absence of BCR signaling or T cell help, naive B cells can undergo proliferation and differentiation in response to TLR ligands such as LPS and CpG (Coutinho et al., 1974; Krieg, 2002; Eckl-Dorna and Batista, 2009). In human B cells, TLR signaling has been suggested to represent a third signal required for the polyclonal activation of naive B cells (Ruprecht and Lanzavecchia, 2006). Furthermore, TLR signaling has also been implicated in antibody responses in vivo, long-term B cell memory, and plasma cell differentiation (Bernasconi et al., 2002). Similarly, stimulation of B cells via TLR ligands has been associated with promotion of plasma cell differentiation (Rawlings et al., 2012). However, the precise signaling requirements that promote terminal B cell differentiation are a topic of intense investigation (Nutt et al., 2015).",

It has been reported that CpG DNA can enhance the efficiency of EBV-immortalization of B cells (Traggiai et al., 2004; Yu et al., 2008b). Furthermore, the use of such EBV-transformed human B cells in fusions can increase hybridoma formation as much as 25-fold compared with untransformed PBMCs (Yu et al., 2008b). These strategies have not only led to the generation of neutralizing antibodies against the influenza strain responsible for the 1918 pandemic (Yu et al., 2008b), but have also been exploited to study antibody responses to many pathogens, including CMV (Macagno et al., 2010), influenza virus (Yu et al., 2008a; Corti et al., 2010), HIV (Buchacher et al., 1994), and dengue virus (Dejnirattisai et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2014).",

However, this strategy is laborious and time consuming, as extensive screening is needed to retrieve the comparatively rare antigen-specific B cells contained within this expanded B cell population. During the last decade, the direct cloning of Ig variable genes from single cells (Babcook et al., 1996; Wardemann et al., 2003) and, more recently, the next-generation sequencing of IgH variable genes have facilitated the isolation of antigen-specific B cells from the plasmablast or memory cell population in the peripheral blood approximately a week after infection or vaccination (Wrammert et al., 2008; Scheid et al., 2009; Smith et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 2013). One limitation in using some of these antigen-specific B cell isolation methods is imposed by the time frame of the humoral response to infection or immunization, which typically peaks 7 d postvaccination and returns to barely detectable levels of specific antibody by day 14 (Wrammert et al., 2008). The results of these in vivo studies underscore the need for fast and inexpensive in vitro systems that can recapitulate at least some features of the human immune response.",

The in vitro activation of B cells in an antigen-dependent manner is difficult to achieve, because the wide haplotype variation of MHCIIs necessitates the use of unique T cells specific to a particular MHCII to activate B cells in vitro (Fauci et al., 1976; Borrebaeck et al., 1988). To overcome these limitations, we developed a novel, in vitro strategy to stimulate human B cells with streptavidin nanoparticles conjugated to both GpG and antigen (Eckl-Dorna and Batista, 2009). B cells producing antigen-specific antibodies were identified, quantified, and characterized to determine the antibody repertoire. We validated the utility of this approach using human B cells from healthy individuals against a wide range of infectious targets including tetanus toxoid (TT), hemagglutinin (HA) from several subtypes of influenza A, and the HIV envelope protein gp120. We also determined the physiological effectiveness of the antibodies by measuring their antigen-binding affinities and neutralizing abilities. Additionally, we demonstrated that this method allows selective, in vitro recall of human B cells, overcoming the difficulties of either isolating the infrequent antigen-specific memory B cells present in the peripheral blood of healthy subjects under normal circumstances or the requirement for vaccination or infection and the use of plasmablasts as a source of antigen-specific cells. This is a novel and valuable approach not only to rapidly generate therapeutic antibodies, but also to accelerate immunogen design, testing, and early characterization of human vaccines, obviating the need for laborious, time-consuming, and expensive clinical trials.",

These findings have been exploited as an efficient way of retrieving human monoclonal antibodies in vitro (Traggiai et al., 2004). We hypothesized that the delivery of a TLR ligand via BCR-mediated internalization might represent a way of exclusively activating B cells with a particular BCR specificity. To determine the best stimulatory conditions for such activation, we first took advantage of an anti\u2013\u03ba-chain antibody to target CpG to the BCR, because 60% of circulating human B cells bear this BCR chain; the rest bear a \u03bb chain. We coated streptavidin polystyrene nanoparticles with a mixture of biotinylated anti-\u03ba antibody and the TLR ligand CpG, as we have previously described in mice (Eckl-Dorna and Batista, 2009).",

As expected, soluble CpG induced a robust proliferation of B cells irrespective of whether they expressed \u03ba- or \u03bb-BCR (57.9% vs. 39.9%, respectively; Fig. 1 a). In contrast, CpG that had been rendered particulate did not trigger any proliferation unless anti-\u03ba was also present. Particulate anti\u2013\u03ba-CpG could stimulate only B cells with a \u03ba-BCR, leading to 47.6% proliferation (Fig. 1 a).

We wondered whether this could be caused by B cells reaching different stages of plasma cell differentiation in each of these conditions. To investigate this, we used flow cytometry to monitor the differentiation of proliferating cells by the expression of the surface molecules CD27 and CD38, which are up-regulated during plasma cell differentiation. When stimulated with soluble CpG, 38% of the cells were CD27hi/CD38int, a characteristic phenotype that has been described for plasmablasts (Fig. 2 a; Fink, 2012). Stimulation with particulate anti\u2013\u03ba-CpG or anti\u2013\u03bb-CpG (but not with particulate anti-\u03ba or anti-\u03bb) led to the production of CD27hi/CD38hi cells (44% for anti\u2013\u03ba-CpG and 30% for anti\u2013\u03bb-CpG), characteristic of a plasma cell phenotype (Fig. 2 a). In line with the plasma cell differentiation stage, we observed an increase in IgG secretion after stimulation with soluble CpG and particulate anti\u2013\u03ba-CpG or anti\u2013\u03bb-CpG and higher levels of IgG antibodies bearing \u03ba-light or \u03bb chain when the cells were stimulated with particulate anti\u2013\u03ba-CpG or anti\u2013\u03bb-CpG, respectively (Fig. 2 b). Comparable results were obtained using memory B cells isolated from fresh and cryopreserved PBMCs (Fig. S1). The generation of plasmablasts and plasma cells in the different cultures was further confirmed and quantified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Unlike plasmablasts, plasma cells exhibit an expanded ER, a feature typically associated with large-scale antibody production. We found that the majority (88%) of the CD27hi/CD38int cells showed typical plasmablast morphology, with no changes in the ER. In contrast, 75% of the CD27hi/CD38hi cells possessed expanded ER, indicating that the CD27hi/CD38hi cells were indeed plasma cells (Fig. 2 c).",

As expected, the two cell populations substantially down-regulate key transcription factors such as PAX5 and BCL6, which are required for naive B cell maintenance. Similarly, when compared with the CD27hi/CD38int population, CD27hi/CD38hi cells expressed higher levels of transcription factor (TF) genes such as XBP1, IRF4, and PRMD1, which are required for plasma cell differentiation (Fig. S2 b). We also analyzed the early molecular signaling pathways triggered after the activation of memory B cells with the different stimuli, particulate anti\u2013\u03ba-CpG, particulate anti-\u03ba, and soluble CpG, by evaluating the activation status of a range of intracellular mediators such as pAKT, pERK, pSTAT3, and p-p38 in response to these stimuli. We observed that in agreement with a previously published study (Eckl-Dorna and Batista, 2009), compared with memory B cell stimulation with soluble CpG or particulate anti-\u03ba, particulate anti\u2013\u03ba-CpG stimulation resulted in more sustained phosphorylation of p38 (Fig. S2 c). However, stimulation with particulate anti\u2013\u03ba-CpG did not induce a synergistic effect in the phosphorylation of AKT, ERK, or STAT3 (Fig. S2 c).",

An analysis of the transcriptional activity of all Ig-\u03ba and Ig-\u03bb variable and constant region genes revealed that anti\u2013\u03ba-CpG stimulation resulted in the specific enhanced expression of \u03ba-chain genes in CD27hi/CD38hi cells, with minimal bystander activation of \u03bb-chain B cells (Fig. 2 e). Furthermore differential expression across the entire transcriptome confirms the up-regulation of genes involved in antibody production and plasma cell markers in B cells stimulated with anti\u2013\u03ba-CpG in comparison to memory B cells and CpG-stimulated B cells (plasmablasts), respectively (Fig. 2 f). Collectively, our experimental results suggest that the targeting of particulate CpG via the BCR can work as a selective method for stimulating human memory B cells to proliferate and differentiate into CD27hi/CD38hi plasma cells, leading to antibody production.",

Accordingly, we first chose TT as an antigen. The percentage of TT-specific memory cells in circulating blood of immunized individuals has been estimated to be \u223c0.04% (Giesecke et al., 2014), which is three orders of magnitude lower than the 60% of B cells bearing a \u03ba-chain BCR. For this experiment, memory B cells were either unstimulated or stimulated with soluble CpG or particulate TT-CpG. It is important to note that memory B cells were purified from healthy donors who had not been recently vaccinated against tetanus or otherwise restimulated. Plasma cell differentiation was assessed by flow cytometry as described earlier. Interestingly, a distinct population of CD27hi/CD38hi plasma cells was observed after stimulation with TT-CpG (Fig. 3 a, top row, orange quadrants). This plasma cell population is likely to be the result of BCR-specific recognition of particulate TT-CpG, as it was completely absent in the nonstimulated control or when B cells from the same donor were stimulated with soluble CpG alone (Fig. 3 a, top row, orange quadrants).",

To test the specificity of the antibodies produced by bulk-sorted plasma cells after particulate TT-CpG stimulation, we performed ELISA using TT as a coating antigen (Fig. 3 a, right). We found that only antibodies produced after particulate TT-CpG stimulation were TT specific, and no signal was produced in the absence of stimulus.

Notably, this represents a >1,000-fold enrichment compared with the expected 0.04% circulating TT-specific memory B cells mentioned previously after only 6 d of in vitro stimulation (Giesecke et al., 2014). Moreover, the multiple encounter of the same antibody sequence is indicative of the in vitro proliferation of a single B cell after stimulation. These antibodies also showed an extensive diversity in V(D)J gene usage, with no dominant preferences for particular genes, and a broad distribution of heavy chain complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) lengths (Table S1). Some of the recovered VH segments also show sequence similarities to anti-TT VH gene sequences previously isolated from vaccinated individuals (de Kruif et al., 2009; DeKosky et al., 2013; unpublished data). Interestingly, we also found two antibodies with identical VH and JH gene usage and CDR3 junctions, but carrying single point mutations (TT-Ab3 and TT-Ab4; Table S1; and Fig. S3 a). These antibodies, although sharing identical heavy (VH1-69/D4-17/JH4) and light (VK-39/JK4) chain gene usage, differed in the number of mutations in their sequences, indicating that they are clonally related (Table S1; and Fig. S3 a). This is consistent with antibodies produced by individual B cells that most likely originated in vivo via somatic hypermutation but subsequently proliferated in vitro. The identification of 13 unique B cell clones strongly suggests that our in vitro booster vaccination is able to sample a wide repertoire of TT-specific B cells, in particular when taking into consideration that only single 56 activated B cells were used for single-cell sequence analysis.",

Collectively, there was a higher number of mutations seen in the genes encoding TT-specific antibodies compared with those encoding non\u2013TT-specific cloned antibodies, and a higher frequency of replacement mutations compared with silent mutations, especially in the CDRs, both of which suggest antigen-driven selection.

Sequence alignment analysis of the expressed alleles revealed six different H5-specific antibody gene sequences (Fig. 5 b and Table S5).

As shown in Fig. 6 c, the neutralizers H5-Ab2 and H5-Ab4 efficiently compete with C179 for binding to the A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) HA, indicating that these antibodies are binding to the HA stem. To further substantiate these findings, we evaluated the binding of these antibodies to different HA mutants by ELISA. We took advantage of wild-type HA from A/New Caledonia/20/1999 (H1 wt); a mutant HA containing arginine substitutions that block access to the stem epitope (H1 delta stem I45R/T49R), and a mutant with an N-glycan insertion that also prevents access to the stem epitope (H1 delta stem 45glyc). In this assay, the HA stem-binding antibody CR6261 and the HA head-binding antibody CH65 were used as controls. Although both antibodies bound to the positive control H1 wt, the binding of CR6261 to the I45R/T49R or 45glyc mutant proteins was compromised. On the other hand, the binding of Ab CH65 to both mutant variants was unaffected (Fig. 6 d). Both H5-Ab2 and H5-Ab4 lost the capacity to bind the I45R/T49R mutant (Fig. 6 d), confirming that these antibodies bind to the stem epitope. Moreover, these antibodies also showed reduced binding to the 45glyc mutant, further supporting the binding of H2-Ab2 and H5-Ab4 to the HA stem region (Fig. 6 d).",

Therefore it was important to test the suitability of our approach using an antigen for which we are not relying on the preexistence of memory B cells from previous related-virus exposure. To this end, we stimulated memory B cells from five HIV-uninfected individuals with particulate gp120-CpG. We single-cell sorted, sequenced VH and VL, and expressed 257 antibodies. Eighteen of these antibodies were shown to be positive at recognizing recombinant gp120, as tested by ELISA and by flow cytometry (Figs. 7 a and S5 a). VH gene sequence alignment revealed antibodies with identical sequences in three of the five donors, suggesting in vitro B cell clonal expansion (Fig. 7 b). Analysis of somatic hypermutations in the rearranged VH gene segments showed 13 mutated VH sequences, with five to 34 mutations (16.54 \u00b1 2.58; Table S7). This indicates that these B cells might have arisen from B cells that have previously been triggered by an unknown antigen. Additionally, we also identified five antibodies that contain from zero to three mutations from the closest germline (Table S8), which may reflect that the B cells that gave rise to these antibodies have not been affinity matured against gp120.",

Although seven of the antibodies were able to bind to one or more proteins of the panel, antibodies gp120-Ab8 and gp120-Ab9 proved to be negative in this assay (Fig. 7 c). Moreover, biolayer interferometry (BLI) showed that gp120-Ab8 and gp120-Ab9 exhibited a measureable affinity of 89.3 and 124 nM to gp120, respectively, suggesting that they were specific to gp120 and were unlikely to be simply polyreactive (Fig. 7 d). These results show that our booster vaccination does not rely exclusively on the activation of memory B cells that originated from a related viral infection. Furthermore, because our methodology is independent of T cell help, it may be able to overcome tolerance mechanisms that would normally prevent these polyreactive specificities from responding to vaccination.

As a result, only B cells that are able to bind antigen with a certain avidity are able to internalize particulate-CpG. Synergistic BCR and TLR activation results in the induction of robust B proliferation and differentiation to plasma cells, together with antibody secretion in just a few days of in vitro culture. By using this approach, we were able to induce specific in vitro B cell responses for a variety of antigens such as TT, influenza, and gp120, mimicking an in vivo vaccine boost. This allowed the production of a large panel of human monoclonal antibodies within a few days. This in vitro vaccine boost strategy can be used not only as a way of studying antigen-specific antibody repertoires, but also to generate human mAbs.",

            "text": "Unlike that of T cells, efficient antigen-specific B cell activation in vitro has been difficult to achieve, because BCR engagement alone is insufficient to induce robust B cell activation. Indeed, B cells require second signals such as CD40 or TLR, and the presence of different interleukin cocktails, including IL-21, IL-2, IL-6, and IL-15 (Arpin et al., 1995; Bernasconi et al., 2002; Ettinger et al., 2005; Huggins et al., 2007). This type of stimulation has been used extensively to effectively activate polyclonal B cells (Corti et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2014). In contrast to CD40L stimulation, soluble CpG stimulation requires a high concentration, which forces entry through nonspecific uptake by the cells (H\u00e4cker et al., 1998), triggering a strong activation of B cells irrespective of BCR specificity. In contrast, an advantage of our method is that the binding of CpG to a nanosphere prevents nonspecific entry into B cells, so particulate-CpG can gain access to the TLR9 compartments only via antigen-specific BCR internalization. As a result, only those B cells that bind antigen receive the correct signals to proliferate and differentiate. Importantly, particulate anti-BCR stimulation alone is a poor inducer of proliferation and differentiation. Similarly, soluble CpG alone is sufficient to drive proliferation but not plasma cell differentiation. Stimulation of both BCR and TLR, however, results in robust proliferation, plasma cell differentiation, and antibody secretion. In the future, it will be important to define the precise signals involved in the induction of plasma cell differentiation.",

Earlier studies from our laboratory provided evidence for a platform with selective synergism between BCR and TLRs in stimulating B cells using particulates in mice, and the cross-linking of the two receptors leads to specific B cell proliferation and differentiation (Eckl-Dorna and Batista, 2009). Furthermore, synergisms of BCR and TLR9 have also been reported in the development of human autoimmune diseases (Leadbetter et al., 2002; Viglianti et al., 2003).",

We showed that only the integrated delivery of two signals, via both the BCR and the TLR, is able to drive the proliferation and differentiation of memory B cells into plasma cells, leading to an increased production of \u03ba-bearing antibodies. In addition to the \u03ba/\u03bb proof of principle, we have successfully applied this approach to different antigens, demonstrating its robustness and reproducibility. We have shown that in vitro stimulation of memory B cells with particulate antigen-CpG (TT, influenza HA, gp120) selectively enriched the frequency of CD27hi/CD38hi antigen-specific plasma cells despite the very low number of precursors circulating in peripheral blood and regardless of the nature of the pathogen-derived antigen chosen to coat the nanoparticles. These plasma cells were also able to secrete antibodies that were specific to the stimulating immunogen.",

The repeated isolation of identical V(D)J sequences represents strong evidence of proliferation and differentiation of individual B cells in vitro; alternatively, it could reflect in vivo clonal size. We also found VDJ sequences with point mutations, which most likely represent sister cells that underwent in vivo somatic mutation and were individually stimulated in our in vitro system. Given the absence of T cell help and the short time in culture, it is unlikely that our system induces any somatic hypermutation. Future modifications to our antigen-specific in vitro B cell stimulation toward the induction of somatic mutation and affinity maturation represents a key next step in replicating a full immune response in culture.",

This was further suggested by functional assays in which, of the nine antibodies tested, two demonstrated neutralizing activity against H1N1 HA. Indeed, we demonstrated that the two neutralizing antibodies identified in this study are specific to the stalk of HA. It has been shown that antibodies against the stem domain of HA are able to neutralize a wide spectrum of influenza virus strains and subtypes, because this domain is comparatively conserved (Ekiert et al., 2009; Corti et al., 2011; Dreyfus et al., 2012). Furthermore, three of the antibodies that were isolated from H1 stimulations, HA-Ab1, HA-Ab2, and HA-Ab3, are clonally related to two antibodies that have been recently identified as predominantly neutralizing antibodies developed upon H5 immunization in humans (Joyce et al., 2016). In the future, the combination of this methodology with high-throughput sequencing may prove to be an invaluable tool to study antigen immunogenicity in vitro.",

            "text": "So far, several powerful approaches have been used to isolate human monoclonal antibodies such as phage display, EBV immortalization, yeast display, and humanized animal models (McCafferty et al., 1990; Clackson et al., 1991; Arpin et al., 1995; Tiller et al., 2008; Boder et al., 2012; Shultz et al., 2012). However, all these methodologies rely on large-scale screening to identify only a few truly antigen-specific antibodies. Although more recently, antigen-specific B cell sorting and single-cell cloning have circumvented some of these issues, these approaches are still restricted to high-affinity antibody\u2013antigen interactions (Franz et al., 2011). In contrast, the method reported here can overcome this barrier, as it does not rely on single BCR\u2013antigen interactions but instead on the avidity of the BCR for the antigen arranged on the particle. As such, our approach allows antigen-specific isolation of Abs with Kd values ranging from 10\u22129 to 10\u221212 M for TT and influenza HA, and 10\u22127 to 10\u22128 M in the case of HIV gp120. Furthermore, our method induces the differentiation into antigen-specific plasma cells with the concomitant up-regulation of immunoglobulin genes compared with memory cells, thereby facilitating single-cell antibody cloning. Thus, our approach could be applied in future for the fast generation of human monoclonal antibodies, and it offers the possibility to interrogate antigen immunogenicity in vitro. This can be achieved in a matter of days, without the need of expensive GMP protein production or the involvement of patients in time-consuming clinical trials (Joyce et al., 2016). As such, our approach not only complements existing methodologies but also offers an alternative for an in vitro phase 0 trial. This will help in future vaccine development by accelerating the iterative immunogen design before entering into phase I clinical trial.",
