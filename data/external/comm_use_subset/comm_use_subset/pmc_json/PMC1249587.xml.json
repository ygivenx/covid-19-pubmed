Previous studies in other coronavirus members suggest that this protein is highly immunogenic and could be a good target for the design of an effective vaccine [7-10]. The expression of NC in CHO cells led to the observation that this protein folds spontaneously into viral-like particles (VLPs). These particles are effectively incorporated at several stages of the virus life cycle, including assembly, budding from cells, and receptor-binding leading to membrane fusion. The viral particles also present antigens to the immune system in a structure that mimics the infectious virion [11-13].",

There are several eukaryotic vectors that express recombinant proteins efficiently. However, the uptake of antigens and its presentation are critical elements in DNA vaccination strategies. One strategy to increase the potency of DNA vaccines is to prolong the survival of antigen presenting cells (APCs), especially dendritic cells. Previous studies show that survival of dendritic cells is increased in the presence of anti-apoptotic factors such as XIAP. This approach has results in increased amounts of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells [16,17].",

After plasmid digestion, the 1.2 kb band corresponding to the NC gene was sub-cloned into BamHI-and EcoRI sites of pVAX-1 which contains a CMV promoter for high level expression in vivo. The fragment was also sub-cloned into the pEF6-Myc/His (Invitrogen) and pQE (Qiagen) vectors. The pEF6 vector was designed to over produce recombinant proteins in mammalian cell lines and was used to establish a stable cell line by using a resistant blasticidine gene. The pQE Tri system vector was used for production of proteins in bacteria. These vectors ultimately allow for the purification of the protein by immobilized metal affinity chromatography.

However, the absence of an effective therapeutic agent against this lethal virus, compounded by the threat of its re-emergence, has triggered research efforts to develop an effective vaccine. Previous studies indicate that the spike protein is responsible for the binding of the virus to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [25-27]. The spike protein contains epitopes that might elicit neutralizing antibodies in the host species thus making it a good target for vaccine development against SARS [28-31]. However, mutation of this protein could affect the virulence by allowing the virus to escape from specific immune response[32,33]. Other research groups have made efforts to develop vaccines based on viral nucleocapsids since these viral proteins have conserved regions. Milich and McLachlan showed that the viral nucleocapsid contains T-cell dependent and independent epitopes. Nude (athymic) mice immunized with HBV-nucleocapsid alone develop high titers of IgM, IgG2a and IgG2b antibodies which are the predominant antibodies in Th1 responses [34]. There is evidence that the specific structure folding of viral nucleocapsids is responsible for its high immunogenicity [35].",

In an HIV vaccine candidate study, we showed that montanide can induce strong antibody titers against HIV-1 structural genes (gp120, gag and pol). CpG is also among the most frequently used experimental adjuvants; this adjuvant stimulates dendritic cells through Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), inducing cell maturation and enhancing antigen presentation and Th1 responses. [45-47]. The combination of montanide and CpG was investigated in light of a recent study demonstrating that this combination is more effective than the use of any of the adjuvants alone [48]. A group of mice received XIAP as adjuvant based on the finding by Kim et al. that mice immunized with DNA encoding XIAP exhibit a strong cell mediated immune response against melanoma. Kim et al. hypothesize that this strong response may be due to increased survival of dendritic cells or T cells in vivo [16,17].",

Ideally, peptides are used to stimulate CD8+effector responses, however, this is not yet feasible since NC CTL epitopes are not yet characterized in this strain of mice. It is likely that VLPs are processed by antigen presenting cells and the epitopes presented in an MHC I context, as suggested by the increased CD8+ T-cell responses observed post-vaccination.",

Two more studies analyzed humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in mice immunized with DNA vaccines expressing NC [50,51]. Kim at al. showed that linkage of NC protein to calreticulin increased humoral and cellular immune responses in vaccinated mice compared to mice receiving DNA-NC alone. We did not detect a high level of CD8+ T cell immune response in mice immunized with DNA-NC or NC protein alone. However, the immunogenicity of our candidate DNA vaccine encoding NC was improved with the co-administration of the recombinant nucleocapsid protein and adjuvants.",
