            "text": "Infectious bronchitis (IB), also called avian infectious bronchitis, is a common, highly contagious, acute, and economically important viral disease of chickens caused by coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). The virus is acquired following inhalation or direct contact with contaminated poultry, litter, equipment or other fomites. Vertical transmission of the virus within the embryo has never been reported, but virus may be present on the shell surface of hatching eggs via shedding from the oviduct or alimentary tract. Dozens of serotypes and genotypes of IBV have been detected, and many more will surely be reported in future. The highly transmissible nature of IB and the occurrence and emergence of multiple serotype of the virus have complicated control by vaccination (Saif et al. 2008). To monitor the existing different IBV serotypes in a geographical region, several tests including virus isolation, virus neutralization, hemagglutination inhibition, ELISA and RT-PCR have been employed (Haqshenas et al. 2005; Saif et al. 2008). The ELISA assay is a convenient method for monitoring of both the immune status and virus infection in chicken flocks. Several commercial ELISA kits for IBV specific antibodies detection are already available, which used inactivated virions as coating antigen (Zhang et al. 2005). PCR on reverse transcribed RNA is a potent technique for the detection of IBV. In comparison with classical detection methods, PCR-based techniques are both sensitive and fast (Zwaagstra et al. 1992). Samples for IBV isolation must be obtained as soon as clinical disease signs are evident. Tracheal swabs are preferred and are placed directly into cold media with antibiotics to suppress bacterial and fungal growth and preserve the viability of the virus (Swayne et al. 1998). In Iran, IB is one of the most important viral respiratory diseases of broiler chickens. However, only the Massachusetts vaccine strain is officially authorized. Despite the use of the IBV vaccine it is common to find IBV problems in vaccinated chickens, causing a tremendous economic impact (Nouri et al. 2003). Several serotypes of infectious bronchitis virus have been reported from different parts of Iran (Seyfi-Abad Shapouri et al. 2002; Nouri et al. 2003; Shoushtari et al. 2008). There is no report about the serotypes and molecular detection of IBV in Zabol in the southeast of Iran. The aim of this study was molecular detection of IBV and the IBV serotypes in Zabol.",

Reverse transcription PCR has been described previously using IBV, RNA extracted from allantoic fluid, and tracheal swabs. These techniques had been shown to be very efficient for the detection of IBV and for the identification of IBV types (Cavanagh et al. 1999; Handberg et al. 1999).

The genetic variability in the S1 subunit of the envelope spike glycoprotein gene represents an adaptive mechanism of the virus to immune selective pressures associated with intensive IBV vaccination and other management practices (Gelb et al. 1991; 1997). As a consequence, several serotypes of the virus are recognized and additional variant serotypes continue to evolve and cause disease episodes. Moreover, the vaccination of many broiler and layer flocks has been routinely made with a live attenuated vaccine against IB containing the strain H120. This strain belongs to the Massachusetts serotype and represents an additional problem for the discrimination of virulent field strains from this serotype, using RT-PCR or even RFLP techniques. Cavanagh et al. (1999) reported that when Massachusetts-type IB vaccines were applied at 1 day old in the hatchery, vaccine virus could later be detected in all broiler flocks tested by RT-PCR on swabs, with maximal amounts during the first week of life (Cavanagh et al. 1999).",

This is the first molecular evidence for the presence of infectious bronchitis virus and Massachusetts serotype in Zabol, southeast of Iran. Prevention of IB in chicken is based mainly on vaccination against the virus. In Iran, strain H120 of IBV has been used for a long time in broiler chicken flocks to achieve this goal. A vaccination program against IB fails when new strains of IBV emerge in a geographical region. Therefore, routinely monitoring of the existing IBV strains in a geographical region has been suggested to choose a suitable virus strain for vaccination.",
