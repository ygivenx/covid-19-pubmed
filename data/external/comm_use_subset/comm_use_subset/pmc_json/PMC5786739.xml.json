            "text": "Respiratory tract infections are a significant contributor to the global burden of respiratory tract illnesses, with up to 4 million deaths worldwide in 2013 (1). Several pathogens, including viruses and bacteria, can cause respiratory tract infections. As clinical presentations often overlap, identification of the underlying pathogen based solely on clinical criteria is challenging (2). Even though most respiratory tract infections are self-limited in immunocompetent hosts, many are treated, as shown in a recent study highlighting the increase in unnecessary antibiotic use in this group (3). In other patient groups, including immunocompromised patients, elderly patients, and critically ill patients, complications from respiratory tract infections often occur, with poor outcomes including increased morbidity and mortality (4\u20136). Thus, the ability to rapidly and accurately diagnose respiratory tract infections is critical for optimal patient care. Additionally, rapid and accurate diagnosis is essential for the timely administration of antiviral therapy, when available, and the institution of contact and droplet precautions to prevent health care-associated transmission (7, 8). Several instruments and multiplexed molecular panels are currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the rapid and sensitive detection of viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens in nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens. These methods differ based on several criteria, including the degree of multiplexing (4 to 22 targets), complexity of the method (moderate to high), throughput (low to high), and turnaround time (TAT) (\u223c1 h to 8 h) (9). In general, performance characteristics of these multiplex panels are significantly better than those of conventional methods, including viral culture and antigen tests, and have replaced these methods in many laboratories. On the other hand, the increased cost of multiplexed molecular panels compared to the cost of conventional methods has raised questions on their cost/benefit ratio, particularly as many viral targets on these panels have no specific treatments. However, given their utility in the rapid diagnosis of infections (especially in immunocompromised patients), infection control and prevention practices, and antibiotic stewardship, the interest in multiplexed PCRs remains high.",

The ePlex RP panel detects 21 of the most common respiratory pathogens in NPS specimens. Viral targets identified are adenovirus, coronavirus (229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human rhinovirus/enterovirus (HRV/EV), influenza A virus, influenza A H1 virus, influenza A 2009 H1 virus, influenza A H3 virus, influenza B virus, parainfluenza virus 1 (PIV1), PIV2, PIV3, PIV4, respiratory syncytial virus subtype A (RSV-A), and RSV-B. Bacterial targets identified are Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (10). The ePlex RP panel is a sample-to-answer multiplex assay that runs on a single-use cartridge that automates all aspects of nucleic acid testing, including extraction, amplification, and detection. It combines electrowetting microfluidics and GenMark's eSensor technology, which is based on the principles of competitive DNA hybridization and electrochemical detection, as previously described for the GenMark XT-8 Respiratory Viral panel (11).",

Thus, exclusion from a highly multiplexed respiratory panel may be warranted. In addition, the utilization of the single-copy pertussis toxin promoter target (ptxP) in some multiplex panels has been shown to be less sensitive for the detection of B. pertussis than PCR tests targeted to the multicopy IS481 insertion sequence (20).

The ePlex instrument is available in configurations ranging from one to four towers, with each tower containing six random-access testing bays. This supports single-shift (8 h) testing volumes ranging from 24 samples to 96 samples, with a TAT of less than 2 h and an HOT of less than 2 min, providing a flexible capacity for laboratories of all sizes. Additional features available on the system include the ability to generate customized reports (e.g., statistical and trending reports) and the potential for a bidirectional interface with laboratory information systems.",
