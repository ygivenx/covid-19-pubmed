Based on a model simulating the potential impact of H1N1 influenza pandemic in the United States, Presanis and colleagues found that an autumn-winter pandemic wave of H1N1 with comparable severity per case could lead to approximately 40,000 - 140,000 ICU admissions (13 - 46 per 100,000 population) [4]. Moreover, Zilberberg et al estimated that 46 million people would contract the infection, resulting in 2.7 million hospitalizations, with 331,587 episodes of acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, equivalent to an increase in the volume of mechanical ventilation of 23% to 45% over the current use [5]. Although the above estimates of the potential numbers of critically ill patients were crude at best, both suggested that, during the influenza pandemic, healthcare workers (HCWs) in ICUs should be prepared to provide critical care support for an excessive volume of critically ill patients over the course of several months. Therefore, it was strongly recommended by the Task Force for Mass Critical Care that, during a disaster, \"hospitals with ICUs should plan and prepare to provide emergency mass critical care every day of the response for a total critically ill patients census at least triple usual ICU capacity\" [6].",

Some investigators believed that people were more likely to implement the recommended behaviors in the event of perceived personal risk [14,16]. However, our study suggested that this might not be the case. Even in the phase 6 global influenza pandemic, about 60% of HCWs working in ICUs (where the risk of secondary transmission of respiratory viruses might be particularly high [17-19]) realized that they lacked the necessary knowledge. Similar to the study of Daugherty et al [10], our study suggested major gaps between HCWs' knowledge and recommended infection control measures, representing a serious public health concern.",

In comparison, previous studies found that significantly fewer HCWs might commit to work in the event of a transmissible disease outbreak. However, it should be pointed out that these studies were carried out among general HCWs rather than critical care clinicians. For example, in a survey of 303 employees at 3 health departments in Maryland from March to July 2005, 163 (53.8%) indicated they would likely report to work in the event of an influenza pandemic [7]. Moreover, Syrett and colleagues reported that even fewer HCWs (18%) in University of Rochester Medical Center committed to work in the hypothetical setting of a transmissible infectious agent with only unproven, experimental prophylaxis or treatment [8]. Both the present study and Daugherty's study found that significantly more critical care clinicians reported willingness to work during an influenza pandemic [10]. Similarly, Martinese et al found that, in comparison with the general HCWs, staff working in emergency and acute medical wards directly responsible for the care of influenza patients were more likely to report for duty [9]. The reason for such a significant difference between critical care clinicians and general HCWs remains to be elucidated, but could be related to the perception of the importance of their roles in response to a public health crisis [7,9].",

However, the high response rate (89.9%) indicated that the study sample represented the actual hospital staff in participating ICUs. Such a high response rate was achieved through the great effort of contact persons in individual ICUs, such as personal distribution of the survey questionnaire to all ICU staffs, and encouraging all potential respondents to complete the questionnaire and return it before the deadline. Second, our study was conducted in 21 tertiary hospitals, possibly limiting generalization of findings to other hospitals. Nevertheless, local healthcare authorities in China required that all severe cases of H1N1 influenza should be transferred to tertiary hospitals. As a result, this study was conducted in hospital settings where most severe cases of H1N1 influenza were likely to be treated. Last, previous studies suggested that self-reported practice might not represent the actual practice [27]. We might deduce that the actual compliance to infection control measures would be even lower.",
