            "text": "The potential for CoVs to cause significant human disease is well demonstrated, with six known HCoVs\u2014HKU1, OC43, NL63, 229E, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV\u2014causing colds, pneumonia, systemic infection, and severe or lethal disease [1]\u2013[5]. Four of these viruses have been identified in just the last 10 years, with two, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, causing lethal respiratory and systemic infection [1], [3]\u2013[6]. Studies over the past 10 years have expanded the known phylogenetic, geographic, and species diversity of CoVs, and support multiple emergence events of CoVs into humans from bats and other zoonotic pools [7]\u2013[10]. The most recent evidence for CoV trans-species movement comes from the emergence of the novel MERS-CoV [1], [11], [12]. From April 2012 to June 2013 MERS-CoV has caused 72 laboratory confirmed cases and up to 50% mortality from severe respiratory and systemic disease in at least 8 countries, with evidence for human-to-human transmission [13]. MERS-CoV is most closely related to the bat CoVs HKU4 and HKU5 [11], and the recently identified receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) is present on both human and bat cells [14], providing a compelling argument that zoonotic CoV infections resulting in severe human disease may be more frequent events than previously thought. Because of the lack of epidemiological data, it remains unknown whether multiple introductions from a zoonotic source or human transmission of a mild or asymptomatic disease is responsible for these continuing cases of sporadic severe infections. However, based on the high mortality rates associated with SARS-CoV and those reported for MERS-CoV [13], this novel virus potentially represents a serious threat to global health for which no vaccines or therapeutics currently exist.",

            "text": "CoVs contain the largest known RNA genomes (27\u201332 kb) and encode an array of 16 viral replicase proteins, including a 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 exoribonuclease (ExoN) domain within nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) [2], [15]\u2013[17]. Similar to the proofreading subunit (\u03b5) of E. coli DNA polymerase III, CoV nsp14-ExoN is a member of the DEDD superfamily of DNA and RNA exonucleases [15], [18]. This superfamily contains four conserved D-E-D-D acidic residues that are required for enzymatic activity, and mutation of these critical residues within CoV ExoN ablates or significantly reduces ExoN activity [15]. Studies from our group have demonstrated that ExoN activity is essential for high-fidelity replication in both the model CoV murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV [19], [20]. Inactivation of ExoN activity due to alanine substitution of the first two active site residues results in 15- to 20-fold reduced replication fidelity in cell culture [19], [20] and a 12-fold reduction during SARS-CoV infection in vivo\n[21], associated with profound and stable attenuation of SARS-CoV virulence and replication. A recent study has shown that bacterially-expressed SARS-CoV nsp14-ExoN can remove mismatched nucleotides in vitro, and that ExoN activity is stimulated in vitro through interactions with the non-enzymatic CoV protein nsp10 [22]. Thus all bioinformatic, genetic and biochemical studies to date support the hypothesis that nsp14-ExoN is the first identified proofreading enzyme for an RNA virus and functions together with other CoV replicase proteins to perform the crucial role of maintaining CoV replication fidelity.",

Because ExoN activity is required for CoV high-fidelity replication [19]\u2013[21], we sought to determine if ExoN was responsible for CoV resistance to RNA mutagens. Using the nucleoside analog RBV and the base analog 5-fluorouracil (5-FU; [29]) we show that CoVs lacking ExoN activity (ExoN\u2212) are up to 300-fold more sensitive to inhibition than wild-type CoVs (ExoN+). Additionally, using full-genome next-generation sequencing we show that ExoN\u2212 viruses accumulate 15- to 20-fold more A:G and U:C transitions, consistent with 5-FU incorporation during RNA synthesis. Ultimately our results suggest the exciting possibility that small-molecule inhibitors of ExoN activity could be potential pan-CoV therapeutics, especially when used in combination with RBV or RNA mutagens.",

Low quality bases from the ends of each sequence read were then trimmed, using Phred scores as the guiding metric (error probabilities higher than 0.001), and sequences with less than 16 bases after trimming were discarded to reduce false alignment and subsequent false variant calls. The program fastq-clipper (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/index. html) was used for this quality filtering. The Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool was then used to align reads to the SARS-CoV ExoN+ or ExoN\u2212 reference genomes with a maximum of two mismatches per read [36]. Base calling at each position was determined using SAMTOOLS [37]. After the pileup, an in-house script collected the data per-position. For each position throughout the viral genome, the bases and their qualities were gathered, each variant allele's rate was initially modified according to its covering read qualities based on a maximum likelihood estimation and test for significance using Wilks' theorem. Additionally, an allele confidence interval was calculated and output for each allele. Only alleles with statistically significant p<0.05 values were retained and considered to be true variants. Above 0.01% all variants were found to be statistically significant, while below 0.01% many variants could not be distinguished from background error. Thus, the background noise caused by sequencing error was determined to be 0.01% or less.",

If ExoN is responsible for the resistance phenotype, viruses lacking ExoN activity (ExoN\u2212) should demonstrate increased titer reduction following RBV treatment as compared to wild-type viruses containing ExoN activity (ExoN+). To test this hypothesis, we examined the sensitivity of MHV-ExoN+ and ExoN\u2212 viruses to RBV during single-cycle (MOI = 1 PFU/cell) replication in murine astrocytoma delayed brain tumor cells (DBT cells). No toxicity was observed in DBT cells following treatment with up to 400 \u00b5M RBV (Figure 1A). MHV-ExoN+ viruses were resistant to 10 \u00b5M RBV (Figure 1B), while MHV-ExoN\u2212 virus titers decreased by \u223c200-fold following treatment with 10 \u00b5M RBV. The capacity of 10 \u00b5M RBV to inhibit MHV-ExoN\u2212 replication is surprising because at least 10-fold higher concentrations of RBV are required to inhibit poliovirus and chikungunya viruses [48]\u2013[50].

To test this possible mechanism, we treated MHV-ExoN+ and MHV-ExoN\u2212 viruses with the specific IMPDH inhibitor mycophenolic acid (MPA; [52]\u2013[54]) during both single- and multi-cycle replication. A concentration-dependent decrease in MHV-ExoN\u2212 virus titer was observed following MPA treatment during single-cycle replication (Figure 1D). MHV-ExoN+ titers were reduced by less than 10-fold, consistent with what was observed following RBV treatment (Figure 1B). Similar to RBV, increased sensitivity of MHV-ExoN\u2212 viruses to MPA was not observed during multi-cycle replication. If RBV is acting via IMDPH inhibition, addition of extracellular guanosine (GUA) should restore virus titers, as has been demonstrated previously for Dengue virus [55]. Addition of 100 \u00b5M GUA following RBV or MPA pretreatment and viral infection had no effect on MHV-ExoN+ viruses (Figure 1E), but completely restored MHV-ExoN\u2212 titer even in the continued presence of 10 \u00b5M RBV or 1 \u00b5M MPA (Figure 1F). These data indicate that the antiviral activity of RBV against MHV-ExoN\u2212 viruses is occurring at least in part through decreasing viral RNA synthesis and inhibition of IMPDH. Because our primary goal was to test the role of nsp14-ExoN in the prevention and/or removal of nucleotide misincorporation we did not further investigate how RBV was specifically inhibiting ExoN\u2212 viruses. However, these results do show that the presence of ExoN activity is capable of preventing RBV inhibition of CoV replication.",

Treatment of DBT cells with up to 400 \u00b5M 5-FU did not result in any detectable cellular toxicity (Figure 2A). Following treatment with up to 200 \u00b5M 5-FU (Figure 2B) during single-cycle infections, MHV-ExoN+ titers were inhibited less than 3-fold, while titers of MHV-ExoN\u2212 decreased \u223c900 fold, representing a \u223c300-fold increase in sensitivity as compared to MHV-ExoN+. During multi-cycle replication, MHV-ExoN+ virus titers were reduced by less than 10-fold following 5-FU treatment, while MHV-ExoN\u2212 showed a \u223c50,000-fold reduction in titer (Figure 2B). Virus was undetectable by plaque assay at 5-FU concentrations above 80 \u00b5M. Analysis of viral RNA synthesis by two-step real-time qRT-PCR demonstrated that MHV-ExoN+ RNA levels were not reduced following 5-FU treatment, while 5-FU treatment resulted in minimal two-to-five fold decreases in MHV-ExoN\u2212 RNA (Figure 2C). The specific infectivity of MHV-ExoN\u2212 was decreased by 14- and 128-fold following treatment with 100 \u00b5M and 200 \u00b5M 5-FU, respectively (Table 1). These results demonstrate that ExoN activity confers resistance to 5-FU, and support the hypothesis that 5-FU is driving increased genomic mutagenesis in MHV-ExoN\u2212 virus populations, leading to lethal mutagenesis and extinction.",

Treatment of Vero cells with up to 400 \u00b5M RBV or 5-FU did not decrease cell viability by more than 20% (Figure 3A). Recent reports have described the lack of RBV uptake by Vero cells due to the absence of specific equilibrative nucleoside transporters [57], [58]. Additionally, previous studies have shown that RBV failed to inhibit SARS-CoV replication in Vero cells [59]. Consistent with those reports, in our experiments both SARS-ExoN+ and ExoN\u2212 viruses were unaffected by treatment with up to 400 \u00b5M RBV (Figure 3B). We therefore performed subsequent experiments with 5-FU. SARS-ExoN+ titers were reduced 3- and 10-fold following treatment with 200 or 400 \u00b5M 5-FU, respectively (Figure 3C). In contrast, SARS-ExoN\u2212 titers were reduced \u223c300-fold by 200 \u00b5M 5-FU (Figure 3C), similar to MHV-ExoN\u2212 viruses. At 400 \u00b5M 5-FU, SARS-ExoN\u2212 virus was inhibited 2,000-fold during a single replication cycle, representing a \u223c160-fold increase in 5-FU sensitivity compared to SARS-ExoN+ viruses. Thus, our data indicate that increased sensitivity of CoVs to RNA mutagens in the absence of ExoN activity is conserved across diverse members of the CoV family. Of interest, our studies with SARS-ExoN+ also indicate that ExoN-mediated protection from nucleotide misincorporation can be overcome at higher concentrations of mutagen.",

To determine whether 5-FU was causing increased mutagenesis in SARS-CoV populations, we performed full-genome NGS analysis of both virus populations replicating in the presence or absence of 5-FU. To analyze the entire spectrum of mutations arising during replication, we extracted total intracellular RNA from Vero cells infected with either SARS-ExoN+ or ExoN\u2212 viruses following treatment with either 0 \u00b5M or 400 \u00b5M 5-FU. We then generated 12 overlapping cDNA amplicons of approximately 3 kb in length for each sample. For each of the four samples, 1.4\u00d7108 to 4.5\u00d7108 bases were sequenced, corresponding to an average coverage depth of between 4,600 and 15,000 at each nucleotide position. We compared the statistically significant minority variants, defined as having a p-value of \u22640.05 following a multiple-testing correction (Benjamini-Hochberg), between the untreated and 5-FU-treated SARS-ExoN+ and ExoN\u2212 populations. Following treatment with 400 \u00b5M 5-FU (Figure 3D), there was an increase in mutations within the SARS-ExoN+ population from 11 to 259 (24-fold). In contrast, for SARS-ExoN\u2212 there were 3648 mutations present within the 5-FU-treated SARS-ExoN\u2212 population compared to the 99 mutations in the untreated population (40-fold increase). Most remarkably, this represented a 16-fold increase in the number of statistically significant minority variants between 5-FU treated ExoN+ and ExoN\u2212 SARS-CoV. Thus, these data support our hypothesis that 5-FU was increasing genomic mutations through incorporation of FUMP into viral genomes in the absence of ExoN activity.",

This decreased specificity in base pairing has been shown in studies with LCMV and primarily results in A-to-G (A:G) and U-to-C (U:C) transitions [29], [61], [63]. To determine if FUMP was being incorporated at higher levels in the absence of ExoN-mediated proofreading, we analyzed the numbers and types of transitions and transversions occurring in each virus population (Figure 4). Transitions are indicated in grey boxes and transversions in white boxes, with the number for each shown. Transversions comprised the majority of variants for both untreated ExoN\u2212 and ExoN+ viruses. Treatment with 5-FU caused the number of U:C and A:G transitions to increase in both ExoN+ and ExoN\u2212 populations, from 2 to 197 for SARS-ExoN+ and from 16 to 3304 for SARS-ExoN\u2212 (Figures 4A and B). This increase and bias toward U:C and A:G transitions is consistent with FUMP being incorporated into both minus- and plus-strand RNA [63] during both ExoN+ and ExoN\u2212 replication; however the absolute numbers were dramatically increased (16-fold) during ExoN\u2212 replication compared to ExoN+. In untreated cells, A:G and U:C transitions accounted for less than 25% of the total minority variants within each population (Figure 4C). Following 5-FU treatment, A:G and U:C transitions accounted for 70\u201395% of the total minority variants within each population.",

            "text": "The antiviral nucleoside analog RBV is currently used to treat hepatitis C virus (HCV; [73]\u2013[75]), Lassa virus [76] and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections [77], [78]. The potential clinical use of RBV for CoV infections is complicated by the multiple mechanisms of action that have been reported [38], and by the potential for disease exacerbation, as reported during the SARS-CoV epidemic [25]\u2013[28]. Our data suggest that RBV primarily inhibits MHV-ExoN\u2212 virus replication through decreasing viral RNA synthesis and inhibition of IMPDH (Figure 1). Inhibition of IMPDH by RMP has been shown to decrease intracellular GTP pools [51], thus altering the balance of nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) within the cell. Decreased GTP levels could result in forced misincorporations due to NTP imbalances in the absence of ExoN activity [72]. However, the moderate 6- to 9-fold decreases in relative specific infectivity observed for MHV-ExoN\u2212 following RBV treatment (Table 1) suggests that mutagenesis is not the primary mechanism by which RBV is exerting an antiviral effect. An additional possibility is that the antiviral activity of RBV against ExoN\u2212 viruses is unrelated to the putative proofreading function of this enzyme. Both biochemical and cell culture studies have demonstrated that loss of ExoN activity leads to impaired RNA synthesis [15], [19], [20]. Furthermore, in addition to ExoN activity, nsp14 contains N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) activity, a critical step in RNA capping [79], [80]. A recent report has demonstrated that the ExoN and N7-MTase domains are structurally inseparable, and that residues within the ExoN domain are important for N7-MTase activity [81]. Thus, the increased sensitivity of MHV-ExoN\u2212 to RBV could result from the impairment of undefined functions of ExoN during CoV replication, particularly during RNA synthesis. The parallel use of ExoN+ and ExoN\u2212 viruses with RBV may allow us to define how RBV is exerting an antiviral effect against CoVs and the potentially novel mechanisms by which ExoN may act to counter that inhibition.",

Here we used NGS to determine the number of mutations present in SARS-ExoN+ and ExoN\u2212 populations. The characteristic 5-FU-mediated transitions U:C and A:G comprised 90% of the total statistically significant minority variants within SARS-ExoN\u2212 population, and were present at levels 15- and 20-fold higher than those same transitions within the ExoN+ population (Figure 4). Overall, our data represent the first direct test of ExoN proofreading during SARS-CoV replication in the absence of ExoN. Furthermore, the sequencing depth attained using NGS shows that ExoN inactivation likely skews the spectrum of spontaneous mutations present within the untreated population (Figure 4). Such overrepresentation of specific mutations in the context of ExoN inactivation is similar to studies of S. cerevisiae DNA polymerases \u03b5 and \u03b4 containing mutations within their respective 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 DEDD exonucleases [82]\u2013[86]. This altered distribution due to ExoN inactivation could have profound implications for CoV adaptation and evolution.",

            "text": "Lethal mutagenesis occurs through the accumulation of mutations within the viral genome during replication, and ultimately results in virus extinction (reviewed in [56], [87]). While lethal mutagenesis has been studied extensively [87], our work is the first to identify an RNA virus protein distinct from the RdRp that directly regulates the sensitivity of RNA viruses to genomic mutations resulting from mutagen incorporation. Currently, RBV is the only FDA-approved antiviral with demonstrated mutagenic activity. The first demonstration of RBV acting as a mutagen was performed using poliovirus [23], [24] almost 30 years after the antiviral activity of RBV was described [88]. The nucleoside analog T-705 (Favipiravir; [89]) is currently in clinical development, and has been shown recently to drive lethal mutagenesis of influenza virus [90]. We have shown that ExoN+ viruses replicate well in the presence of RBV or 5-FU. However, we also have shown that ExoN\u2212 mutants of SARS-CoV and MHV have 15-to-20-fold decreased fidelity [19], [20], are attenuated, are subject to rapid loss of replication and clearance in vivo\n[21], and are highly susceptible to low concentrations of RNA mutagens. An exciting possibility is that this conserved CoV proofreading enzyme could be targeted for inhibition, thus leading to the development of broadly useful CoV therapeutics. While ExoN inhibitors alone might be efficacious, combining an inhibitor of CoV fidelity with an RNA mutagen would magnify the intrinsic fidelity defect of ExoN inhibition and drive high-level mutagenesis. A potential advantage of such an approach would be to rapidly drive the virus to extinction, while limiting or blocking the capacity of the virus to overcome inhibition by reversion. ExoN\u2212 mutants of both MHV and SARS-CoV have shown no reversion over multiple passages in culture or during persistent infections in vivo\n[19]\u2013[21]. Furthermore, we did not observe any primary reversions within the ExoN DEDD motif following 5-FU treatment. While mutations within the CoV RdRp could emerge during acute treatment, mutations within other RNA virus RdRps have demonstrated that the maximum tolerance for increased or decreased fidelity without loss of virus viability is between \u223c3- to 6-fold [35], [48], [69], [91]. In addition, our data demonstrate that ExoN\u2212 viruses are profoundly sensitive to inhibition by lower concentrations of mutagen, providing a possible improved therapeutic index and margin of safety for use.",

            "text": "In summary, this study provides the most direct evidence to date that CoV ExoN provides a proofreading function during virus replication, and identifies ExoN as the critical determinant of CoV sensitivity to RNA mutagens. Because CoV replication fidelity is likely determined by the concerted effort of multiple virus proteins [19], [20], [22], our data suggest the exciting possibility that significant attenuation of CoV fitness and pathogenesis could be achieved by targeting the conserved process of CoV replication fidelity. Ultimately, uncovering the mechanism of fidelity regulation and methodologies to disrupt this critical process will be vital to responding to both endemic and future emerging CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.",
