Using water vapor or CO2 at temperatures above 850 \u00b0C or chemical compounds like phosphoric acid and potassium chloride, the biochar undergoes an activation process resulting in activated biochar (i.e., activated carbon) (Hagemann et al., 2018). When produced from pure stem wood, the solid phase of the pyrogenic process is known as charcoal. In contrast, the term biochar indicates that a broad spectrum of biogenic materials can serve as feedstock. Biochar, activated carbon and charcoal can all be considered as pyrogenic carbon materials.",

In a broader sense, the term biochar denotes its intended long-time residence in the terrestrial environment, either as a soil amendment or for other material-use purposes (Schmidt et al., 2018). Since biochar-carbon decomposes much slower than the original biomass, the application and use of biochar is considered as a terrestrial carbon sink on at least a centennial scale (Zimmerman & Gao, 2013; Lehmann et al., 2015; Werner et al., 2018) and is therefore a promising negative emission technology (IPCC, 2018).",

            "text": "During the first decade of modern biochar research summarized in Lehmann & Joseph (2015), biochar was usually tested as a soil amendment that was applied pure to soils in large quantities (>10 t/ha) revealing modest to large yield increases for a multitude of crops in the tropics but only rarely in temperate climates (Jeffery et al., 2017). More recently it was (re-)discovered that blending biochar with organic amendments such as manure, cattle urine or compost may increase yields more significantly and in a broader spectrum of climates and soils (Steiner et al., 2010; Kammann, Glaser & Schmidt, 2016; Godlewska et al., 2017; Schmidt et al., 2017). As quality biochar is non-toxic and thus even feedable and edible (European Biochar Foundation (EBC), 2012), this apparently favorable combination of organic residues with biochar prompted researchers and a rapidly increasing number of practitioners to conduct trials where biochar was not only mixed with manure but also included as an input into animal farming systems. The incremental addition of biochar to silage, feed, bedding material and liquid manure pit demonstrated that biochar can be used in cascades. In addition to the direct benefits for animal husbandry as discussed below in detail, biochar becomes thus enhanced with organic nutrients which increases the economic viability of biochar application while providing numerous environmental benefits along the (cascading) way.",

            "text": "When combined with silage, biochar can reduce mycotoxin formation, bind pesticides, suppress butyric acid formation and enhance the quantity of lactic bacteria (Calvelo Pereira et al., 2014). Farmers observed that when biochar was combined with straw or saw dust bedding at 5\u201310% (vol) hoof diseases, odors and nutrient losses were reduced (O\u2019Toole et al., 2016). Moreover, farmers reported that adding 0.1% biochar (m/m) in a liquid manure pit reduced odors, surface crust and nutrient losses (Schmidt, 2014; Kammann et al., 2017). Throughout these cascades, the biochar becomes enriched with organic nutrients and functional groups, while the cation exchange capacity and redox activity increases, and pH decreases (Joseph et al., 2013). Analyses indicate that, by enriching the biochar with liquids organic nutrients (whether in the digestive tract, bedding, manure pit or by co-composting), the interior surfaces of the porous biochar become drenched with an organic coating (Hagemann et al., 2017; Joseph et al., 2018). This increases both water storage capacity and nutrient exchange capacity (Conte et al., 2013; Kammann et al., 2015; Schmidt et al., 2015). The biochar becomes thus a more efficient plant growth enhancing soil amendment, that improves the recycling of nutrients from organic residues of animal farming (Kammann et al., 2015). The cascading use of biochar in animal farming systems also reduces the environmentally harmful loss of ammonia through volatilization or nitrate through leaching (Liu et al., 2018; Borchard et al., 2019; Sha et al., 2019) and it has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions such as nitrous oxide (N2O) (Kammann et al., 2017; Borchard et al., 2019), or methane (CH4) (Jeffery et al., 2016). To the best of our knowledge, no study so far has quantified biochar emission reduction effects along a full cascade. The studies cited above are reviews or meta-analyses summarizing mainly effects of the amendment of biochar to soil.",

Thus, we review the current state of knowledge regarding the use of biochar as a animal feed additive.

In nature, charcoal residues from wild fires can still be found years later. Deer and elk are reported to eat from charred trees in Yellowstone National Park and domestic dogs to eat charcoal briquettes (Struhsaker, Cooney & Siex, 1997). The Zanzibar red colobus (Procolobus kirkii), a small monkey regularly eats charcoal to help digest young Indian Almond (Terminalia catappa) or mango (Mangifera indica) leaves that contain toxic phenolic compounds (Cooney & Struhsaker, 1997). Struhsaker, Cooney & Siex (1997) observed that individual colobus monkeys consumed about 0.25\u20132.5 g of charcoal per kg body weight daily. Additional adsorption tests performed by Cooney & Struhsaker (1997) indicated that in particular the African kiln charcoals (which the monkeys also ate) were surprisingly good at adsorbing hot-water-extracted organics from the above-mentioned tree leaves. Thus, the authors concluded that the monkeys\u2019 charcoal consumption was likely a (self-)learned behavior, increasing the digestibility of their typical leaf diet. Interestingly, a population count of colobus monkeys on this African island showed that they reached the highest population density of all monkey species worldwide. It seems, therefore, that the daily consumption of such wood-based biochar has no negative long-term effect at least not on these monkeys.",

Charcoal was known for many centuries as an emergency treatment for poisoning in animals (Decker & Corby, 1971). Biochar has been and still is used because of its high adsorption capacity for a variety of different toxins like mycotoxins, plant toxins, pesticides as well as toxic metabolites or pathogens. Adsorption therapy, which uses activated biochar as a non-digestible sorbent, is considered one of the most important ways of preventing harmful or fatal effects of orally ingested toxins (McKenzie, 1991; McLennan & Amos, 1989).",

First, biochar can interrupt the so-called enterohepatic circulation of toxic substances between the intestine, liver and bile. It prevents compounds such as estrogens and progestagens, digitoxin, organic mercury, arsenic compounds and indomethacin from being taken up in bile. Second, compounds such as digoxin, which are actively secreted into the intestine, can be adsorbed there. Third, compounds such as pethidines can be adsorbed to the biochar, which passively diffuse into the intestine. Fourth, the biochar can take up compounds that diffuse along a concentration gradient between intestinal blood and primary urine.",

            "text": "Although the adsorption capacity is the most prominent function of biochar to explain its positive impacts when fed to animals, adsorption alone cannot explain all phenomena that are observed in biochar feeding experiments. Another pivotal, but still widely overlooked function of biochar is its redox activity. Biochars act as so called geobatteries and geoconductors that can accept, store and mediate electrons from and for biochemical reactions (Sun et al., 2017). Low temperature biochars (HTT of 400\u2013450 \u00b0C) function as geobatteries mainly due to their phenol and quinone surface groups. High temperature biochars (HTT >600\u00b0), on the other hand, are good electrical conductors (Mochidzuki et al., 2003; Yu et al., 2015). Due to both of these qualities, both, high and low temperature biochars, can act in biotic and abiotic redox-reactions as electron mediators (Van Der Zee & Cervantes, 2009; Husson, 2012; Liu et al., 2012; Kappler et al., 2014; Kluepfel et al., 2014; Joseph et al., 2015a; Yu et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2017). Biochar can accept and donate electrons as, for example, in microbial fuel cells where activated biochar can be used as an anode and as a cathode (Gregory, Bond & Lovley, 2004; Nevin et al., 2010; Konsolakis et al., 2015). The electrical conductivity of biochar is, however, not based on continuous electron flow, like in a copper wire, but on discontinuous electron hopping (Kastening et al., 1997), which is of essential importance for biochar\u2019s function as a (microbial) electron mediator or so-called electron shuttle, facilitating even inter-species electron transfer (Chen et al., 2015). Due to the comparably large size of biochar particles, the electron transfer capacity of biochar\u2019s carbon matrices may lead to a relatively long-distance electron exchange that provides a spatially more extensive accessibility to alternative electron acceptors such as minerals for anoxic microbial respiration (Sun et al., 2017).",

As electrons do not exist in a free state under ambient environmental conditions and cannot be stored in large enough quantities by cells, organisms always depend on the availability of both an electron donor (e.g., the metabolized organic matter) and an acceptor to which surcharge electrons can be transferred. This usually occurs in so-called redox reactions where molecules or atoms that donate an electron are coupled through electro-chemical reactions with molecules or atoms that accept an electron. To allow this electron transfer, these chemical or biochemical redox-reactions usually have to take place in very close (molecular) proximity.",

Within those reactions, bacterial cells may transfer electrons to biofilms or via biofilms to other terminal electron acceptors (Richter et al., 2009; Kracke, Vassilev & Kr\u00f6mer, 2015). However, biofilms are rather poor electric conductors and the electron-accepting capacity is low. Hence, microbial redox reactions can be optimized by electron shuttles, such as humic acids or activated biochar whose electrical conductivity is 100\u20131,000 times higher than that of biofilms (Aeschbacher et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2012; Saquing, Yu & Chiu, 2016). Although the conductivity of non-activated biochar is lower compared to activated biochar, it has been shown that it can efficiently transfer electrons between bacterial cells (Chen et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2017). Bacteria were shown to donate an electron to a biochar particle while other bacteria of different species took up (accepted) an electron at another site of the same biochar particle. The biochar acts here like a \u201cbattery\u201d (or electron buffer) that can be charged and discharged, depending on the need of biochemical (microbial) reactions (Liu et al., 2012). Moreover, as biochar can be temporarily oxidized or reduced by microbes (i.e., biochar is depleted or enriched in electrons), it can buffer situations with a (temporary) lack of electron donors or terminal electron acceptors (redox buffering effect) (Saquing, Yu & Chiu, 2016). A principal aim of feeding biochar to animals could thus be to overcome metabolic redox limitations by enhancing electron exchange between microbes, and between microbes and terminal electron acceptors.",

It can be hypothesized that enabling of extracellular electron transfer contributes to a more energy efficient digestion resulting in higher feed efficiency when activated or non-activated biochar is administered. Moreover, the electrochemical effects need to be considered as a major factor for explaining possible shifts in the functional diversity of the microbial community in the digestive system (Prasai et al., 2016). Leng, Inthapanya & Preston (2012) also suggested that electron transfer between biochar and microorganisms could be one of the reasons why feeding biochar to cows led to reduced methane emissions in their studies (see chapter 6).",

It could act jointly as an electron acceptor and donator coupling directly various biotic and abiotic redox-reactions comparable to mixed valent iron minerals (Davidson, Chorover & Dail, 2003; Li et al., 2012; Joseph et al., 2015a; Quin et al., 2015). Beside its polyaromatic backbone, biochar contain, depending on the production process, a multitude of volatile organic carbons (VOC) (Spokas et al., 2011). Some of the pyrolytic VOCs are strong electron acceptors and may act, like a redox wheel similar to how quinone works (Van Der Zee et al., 2003). Some of these pyrolytic VOCs that often undergo oxidative modifications during the aging of biochar (Cheng & Lehmann, 2009) are so-called redox-active moieties (RAMs) that have been shown to contribute to the biodegradation of certain contaminants (Yu et al., 2015). It can be surmised that in the digestive tract, a multitude of RAMs, adsorbed on the surfaces of biochar particles, can act as redox-wheels with various microorganisms. It can be further hypothesized that when biochar buffers electrons in the vicinity of redox active surface groups, it may provide stabile micro-habitats with different redox-pH-milieus for different species of microorganisms (Yu et al., 2015). Moreover, biochar adsorbs certain feed and metabolic substances like tannins, phenols or thionin, which are also electron acceptors and which might further increase the electron buffering of biochar particles during its passage through the digestive tract (Kracke, Vassilev & Kr\u00f6mer, 2015).",

However, unlike both dissolved organic substances, biochar provides a highly porous framework with high specific surface area, where humic-like substances or pyrolytic vinegar can be adsorbed and unfurl three-dimensionally as a coating of the inner-porous aromatic carbon surfaces of biochar. Due to the redox buffering effect of biochar blended with humic substances or wood vinegar, variations of the redox potential may be minimized in the proximity of biochar particles, which could support those species of microorganisms that find their optimum at these redox potentials (Kalachniuk et al., 1978; Cord-Ruwisch, Seitz & Conrad, 1988). Biochar particles may thus provide selective hotspots of microbial activity. It can be assumed that the buffering of the redox potential as well as the effect of electron shuttling between microbial species can have a selective, microbial milieu forming effect, which facilitates and accelerates the formation of functional microbial consortia (Kalachniuk et al., 1978; Khodadad et al., 2011; Sun et al., 2017).",

However, we hypothesize with some confidence that biochar has a direct electro-chemical influence on digestive reactions, and that this is one, if not the main, reason for the extremely varying effects of different biochars. Electrical conductivity, redox potential, electron buffering (poising) and electron transfer capacity (shuttling) of a given biochar depend highly on the type of pyrolyzed feedstock, pyrolytic conditions (Kluepfel et al., 2014; Yu et al., 2015) and especially on pyrolysis temperature (Sun et al., 2017). The higher the temperature above 600 \u00b0C, the better is the electron transfer rate and electrical conductivity (Sun et al., 2017). However, the higher the VOC content of, for example, lower-temperature biochars and higher abundance of surface functional groups on lower temperature biochars (400\u2013600 \u00b0C), the more important the mediated electron transfer onto/from the biochar may become (Joseph et al., 2015a; Yu et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2017). In addition, the mineral content of biochars should be taken into account as well, since it does not only influence biochar\u2019s electro-chemical behavior, but it may also catalyze various biotic and abiotic reactions (Kastner et al., 2012; Anca-Couce et al., 2014).",

Mycotoxins are mainly derived from mold fungi, whose growth on fresh and stored animal feed is difficult to prevent, especially in humid climates. Mycotoxin-contaminated feed can result in serious diseases of farm animals. To protect the animals, adsorbents are usually added to the feed to bind the mycotoxins before ingestion. In addition to the frequently used aluminosilicates, activated carbon and special polymers are increasingly being used (Huwig et al., 2001).",

The results of most studies on sorption in aqueous solution (in vitro) did not correlate with the results in corresponding in vivo test results (Huwig et al., 2001). Thus, in vitro studies have to be interpreted with care, because matrix effects can dramatically impact mycotoxin sorption, for example, Jaynes, Zartman & Hudnall (2007) found that an activated carbon (Norit\u00ae, Boston, MA, USA) could sorb up to 200 g/kg aflatoxin, but only in clear solution. In a corn meal suspension, sorption capacity was 100 times lower due to matrix effects. Matrix effects in the digestive tract can be expected to be even more complex due to varying pH and redox conditions. Still, based on our review, we conclude that negative effects of certain mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol (Devreese et al., 2012, 2014; Usman et al., 2015) and zearalenone (Avantaggiato, Havenaar & Visconti, 2004) can be effectively suppressed with rather low dosages of activated biochar amended to feed, while no benefit was found for aflatoxin. It can be hypothesized that (activated) biochar is only able to suppress negative effects of mycotoxins that are rather hydrophobic (Avantaggiato, Havenaar & Visconti, 2004).",

In 1914, the adsorbing effect of charcoal for various toxins in the digestive tract was described by Skutetzky & Starkenstein (1914). First experiments with bacterial toxins of Clostridium tetani and Clostridium botulinum as well as with diphtheria toxin were performed as early as 1919 (Jacoby, 1919). In particular, Wiechowski pointed out how important the quality of the charcoal is, and how different the effect of different charcoals on the toxin adsorption can be (Wiechowski, 1914). Ernst Mangold described in 1936 the effect of charcoal in animal feeding comprehensively and concluded: \u201cThe prophylactic and therapeutic effect of charcoal on infectious or feeding-related diarrhea is clear, and based on this observation, the co-feeding of charcoal to juvenile animals appears as an appropriate prevention\u201d (Mangold, 1936). At about the same time, Albert Volkmann published his findings about efficient reduction of oocyst excretion resulting from coccidiosis and coccidial infections when charcoal was fed to domestic animals (Volkmann, 1935).",

The number of oocysts in the feces dropped significantly after a single day of feeding biochar; after 5 days no more oocysts could be found in the feces of the calves (Watarai, Tana & Koiwa, 2008). Similar results were reported when a commercial biochar wood acetic acid product (Obionekk\u00ae, Obione, Charentay, France) was tested as feed additive in young goats (Paraud et al., 2011). The mixture administered twice or thrice daily reduced the clinical signs of diarrhea already on the first day, and the oocyst shedding in the feces decreased significantly. Over the period of the study, the mortality of the young goats was 20% in the control group and only 6.7% in the treatment group that received Obionekk\u00ae three times per day. Biochar feeding in goats may also reduce the incidence of parasites such as cestode tapeworms and coccidia oocysts (Van, Mui & Ledin, 2006).",

            "text": "Numerous human medical studies on the use of activated carbon in poisoning have been published in the 1980s providing important insights into the use of (activated) biochar as feed especially to treat feed poisoning (Erb, Gairin & Leroux, 1989). The adsorbing effect of activated carbon can be used to prevent the gastrointestinal uptake of most drugs and numerous toxins (Neuvonen & Olkkola, 1988), which is typically more effective than pumping out stomach contents. The repeated intake of activated carbon or biochar improved the elimination of overdosed toxicologically effective substances such as aspirin, carbamazepine, dapsone, dextropropoxyphene, cardiac glycosides and many more as summarized by Neuvonen & Olkkola (1988). Moreover, a faster elimination of many industrial and environmental toxins was assessed. In acute poisoning, 50\u2013100 g of activated biochar are administered to adults and about one g/kg of body weight to children. The same authors also point out that there are no known serious side effects from accidental ingestion. In the case of acute poisoning, Finnish physicians recommend repeated oral treatment with activated carbon to reduce the risk of toxins being desorbed from the biochar-toxin complex in the digestive cycle (Olkkola & Neuvonen, 1989). In general, repeated oral administration of biochar increases the efficacy of detoxication (Crome et al., 1977; Dawling, Crome & Braithwaite, 1978). However, regular administration of 0.2% activated biochar in broiler feed did not significantly impact the blood levels of the antimicrobial drugs doxycycline and tylosin, and of the coccidiostats diclazuril and salinomycin. The pharmaceutical products were co-applied to the activated carbon amended feed (De Mil et al., 2017).",

            "text": "Based on the excellent adsorption properties of biochar in relation to numerous pesticides, insecticides and herbicides (Safaei Khorram et al., 2016; Mandal, Singh & Purakayastha, 2017; Cederlund, B\u00f6rjesson & Stenstr\u00f6m, 2017), which are increasingly found in animal feed (Shehata et al., 2012), biochar is considered as animal feed additive. Of particular importance is the adsorption of glyphosate, an herbicide that currently contaminates most of the feed produced from genetically modified maize, rapeseed and soybean. Although crop desiccation herbicides have been banned in Germany since May 2014, they are still permitted in many other countries as a treatment shortly before grain harvest. In addition to immobilizing magnesium and zinc, glyphosate has a potent antibiotic activity (US Patent 7,771,736, EP0001017636, issued in 2010) and is suspected of causing or promoting chronic botulism (Shehata et al., 2012). Glyphosate sorption efficiency onto biochar particles is both dependent on pH (high sorption at low pH; Herath et al., 2016) and the highest treatment temperature during biochar production (high sorption on high-temperature biochars; Hall et al., 2018). However, Hall et al. (2018) showed that glyphosate sorbed by biochar from pure water could be remobilized by adding 0.1M monopotassium phosphate solution. This finding indicates that biochar-sorbed glyphosate from feed may be remobilized in the digestive tract due to numerous ions potentially competing for sorption sites. Further research in vivo and/or in vitro in relevant matrixes is necessary, as low pH, for example, in the stomach, could favor glyphosate sorption (Herath et al., 2016). In a study with 380 dairy cows, Gerlach et al. (2014) showed that daily feeding with humic acids (120 g/day) or with a combination of 200 g of biochar and 500 g of sauerkraut juice for 4 weeks significantly reduced the glyphosate concentration in the urine of the cows that were fed with glyphosate contaminated silage.",

            "text": "Preliminary pesticide adsorption studies using biochar were already carried out in the 1970s (Humphreys & Ironside, 1980). Deposits of the systemic organophosphorus insecticide Runnel in the gastric mucosa of sheep were significantly reduced by the feeding 50 g of activated biochar per kg of feed, i.e., 5% amendment rate (Smalley, Crookshank & Radeleff, 1971). While it was reported that activated biochar was successfully used to adsorb pesticides in the digestive tracts of cattle, sheep and goats and were eventually excreted (Wilson & Cook, 1970), similar experiments in chickens did not show any significant effects on the residue levels in eggs and tissues (Foster et al., 1972). Feeding of biochar with Dieldrin contaminated feed, an organochloride insecticide that was widely used until the 1970s and is still persistent in the environment though it is banned now, resulted in a very significant reduction of the Dieldrin concentration in the fat of the pigs (Dobson et al., 1971). On the other hand, Fries et al. (1970) found no reduction in the levels of Dieldrin and DDT in milkfat when cows were fed one kg of activated biochar per day for 14 days. However, Wilson et al. (1971) found that when Dieldrin and DDT-contaminated feed was mixed with activated biochar at 900 g per animal and day, Dieldrin intake was reduced by 43% and DDT intake by 24%. When the contaminated feed and biochar were administered separately, DDT intake was not reduced as both the Dieldrin and DDT were probably absorbed by the oral mucosa already and not only in the digestive tract (Fries et al., 1970). Activated biochar also showed very good in vitro adsorption properties for the herbicide Paraquat (Okonek et al., 1982; Gaudreault, Friedman & Lovejoy, 1985), which has been banned in the EU since 2007 but is still legal in the US and other countries.",

These compounds accumulate in the adipose (fatty) tissue of animals and humans. Experiments with activated biochar to adsorb these substances were undertaken repeatedly in Japan (Yoshimura et al., 1986; Takenaka, Morita & Takahashi, 1991; Takekoshi et al., 2005; Kamimura et al., 2009). All experiments showed the strong affinity of the organochlorine compounds to activated biochar (Iwakiri, Asano & Honda, 2007). Fujita et al. (2012) carried out an extensive experiment with 24 laying hens whose feed contained the organochlorine compounds mentioned above and fed either with or without 0.5% biochar over a period of 30 weeks. Depending on the structure and aromaticity of the organochlorine compounds, concentrations of PCDDs/PCDFs, non-ortho PCBs and mono-ortho PCBs in the tissue and eggs of the laying hens could be reduced by more than 90%, 80% and 50%, respectively (Fujita et al., 2012). The fact that different organochlorine compounds are bound to different degrees by biochar has been previously demonstrated in studies of contaminated fish oil (Kawashima et al., 2009). In general, molecules with higher aromaticity have a stronger affinity to biochar; this also applies to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Bucheli, Hilber & Schmidt, 2015). Olkkola & Neuvonen (1989) concluded that the regular intake of biochar as food supplement can be very helpful in the elimination of industrial and environmental toxins including dioxins and PCB ingested by humans, a valid statement for animal feed too.",

            "text": "Another benefit of a regular use of biochar is the alleviation of adverse effects of naturally occurring though potentially harmful ingredients such as tannins contained in many feeds (Struhsaker, Cooney & Siex, 1997). Tannins are complex and extraordinarily diverse compounds that are partly beneficial but may also be harmful especially to ruminants. Tannins are often found in high protein feeds such as legumes and the strong taste repels the animals, which reduces digestability and weight gain (Naumann et al., 2013). Several studies have investigated how biochar feeding alters the impact of tannin-rich foods. Van, Mui & Ledin (2006) found that in goats, feeding 50\u2013100 g of bamboo biochar per kg of a tannin-rich acacia leaf diet increased daily weight gain by 17% compared to the control without biochar. The authors found that digestion of crude proteins and nitrogen conversion were significantly improved. Apparently, there was an optimal biochar dose: While 50 and 100 g of bamboo biochar feed additions resulted in similar goat weight gains, feeding 150 g of the same biochar per kg diet did not show any improvement compared to control. Struhsaker, Cooney & Siex (1997) found, as previously described, that the consumption of wild fire derived charcoal by Zanzibar red colobus monkeys increased the nutritional efficiency of tannin-rich Indian almond and mango leaves. Banner et al. (2000) found that the mixture of 10\u201325 g of activated biochar per day with rye significantly increased the uptake of tannin and terpene rich compounds. Similar results for sage and other terpenic and tannin-rich shrubs were reported by Rogosic et al. (2006, 2009), whereas others could not confirm that lambs consumed significantly more sage due to biochar amended feed (Villalba, Provenza & Banner, 2002).",

His survey of 21 farmers with at least 150 cattle revealed that overall health and vitality had improved since they had started biochar feeding. The somatic cell count (SCC) of the milk, an indicator of level of harmful bacteria, decreased significantly, whereas milk protein and milk fat content increased. When biochar additions to feed stopped, SCC quickly increased and a general loss of performance of the animals compared to the biochar-feeding period was observed. It was also reported that hoof problems were reduced, and that postpartum health was stabilized through biochar co-feeding. Within 1\u20132 days after the onset of the biochar feeding, diarrhea symptoms decreased and feces became firmer. Mortality rates declined, as did overall veterinary costs. The liquid manure viscosity improved significantly and the odor load of the manure decreased (Gerlach & Schmidt, 2012).",

Another study, however, did not find any significant effect on weight gain and blood values in Hanwoo bulls when an undefined biochar was administered at a rather high dose of 2% (Kim & Kim, 2005). A supplement of 1% rice husk biochar was added to a basal diet consisting of ensiled cassava root, urea, rice straw and fresh cassava foliage (Phongphanith & Preston, 2018). Live weight gain increased by 15% and feed conversion rate also improved by 15% in the biochar treatment, compared to the control without biochar supplement. Interestingly, when a rice wine distillers\u2019 byproduct was added at 4% to the biochar-supplemented feed, the live weight gain and the feed conversion rate increased by 60% compared to the control without either supplement. They further found an increase of 18% compared to feeding with the rice wine distillers alone (without biochar), or 31% compared to the biochar-only supplement. This shows a strong interactive effect between the two supplements indicating that the combination and interaction of biochar with other feed additives should increasingly be investigated.",

This cascading approach of improving not only animal performance and welfare but also various ecosystem services has been the subject of discussion and investigation by various authors since (O\u2019Toole et al., 2016; Schmidt & Shackley, 2016; Kammann et al., 2017). A far-reaching study of these cascades has been carried out by Joseph et al. (2015b) in Australia: Since 2011, 60 grazing cattle on an Australian farm were fed 330 g per day of a high temperature biochar (HTT 600 \u00b0C) made from Jarrah wood mixed with 100 g of molasses. From 2011 to 2015, soil organic matter, pH (CaCl2), Colwell-P, Colwell-K, electrical conductivity and the content of all exchangeable cations increased in the pasture soil that received the dung of the free ranging cattle. During its passage through the digestion system of the cattle, biochar seems to capture organic and mineral compounds with high plant fertilizing properties that would otherwise probably be subject to rather quick leaching during storage. Most of these captured plant nutrients (especially nitrogen and phosphorus) remain bound in the porous structure of the biochar until its incorporation into the soil, where they likely become, to a large extent, plant available as has also been found for biochar after aerobic composting (Kammann et al., 2015; Schmidt et al., 2017). The authors of the Australian study reported that increased retention of the digested nutrients in the biochar increased the fertilizing effect of the bovine manure so that no additional fertilizers was required for the pasture growth (Joseph et al., 2015b). However, they did not set-up a control pasture to proof the latter. To prove their conclusion, a more systematic scientific experiment would be required.",

Young pigs (N = 12) were fed for 42 days in addition to their normal fattening diet (corn, wheat, soybean meal) either with 0%, 0.3% or 0.6% of biochar. The average weight gain during the trial period was 750 g per day in the control without biochar and 877 g per day in the 0.3% biochar treatment; this corresponded to a significant feed efficiency increase of 17.5%. Doubling the biochar supplement to 0.6% did not lead to statistically significant differences compared to the 0.3% treatment. While leucocytes, erythrocytes, hemoglobin, hematocrit and platelets did not differ significantly between the experimental groups, the biochar group showed significant positive effects on total protein, albumin, cholesterol, HDL-CH and LDL-cholesterol levels in the blood plasma. In addition, the cortisol content was significantly lower, which indicates a reduced susceptibility to stress (Chu et al., 2013c). In another study, the authors showed that feeding 0.3% and 0.6% bamboo biochar improved the quality of marketable meat and the composition of pig fat, with an increase in unsaturated fatty acid content and a decrease in saturated fat (Chu et al., 2013b). In a third study, the authors examined to what extent biochar feeding can replace the regular supplementation of growth-promoting antibiotics, something which is still legal in many though not all countries. In a very comprehensive publication (Chu et al., 2013a), they concluded that feeding 0.3% bamboo biochar gave the same growth rate in fattening pigs as the standard antibiotic treatment, notably without the negative side effects to the environment that antibiotics can have.",

In a Japanese study by Mekbungwan, Yamauchi & Sakaida (2004), piglets were fed with increasing concentrations of a 4:1 mixture of a low temperature biochar (HTT 450\u00b0) and wood vinegar. When fed with 1%, 3% and 5% of this mixture, no statistically significant effects on body weight and feed efficiency were observed compared to the 0% control. However, duodenal villi height, an animal health indicator, increased significantly. The same authors showed 4 years later, with the same biochar-wood vinegar mix added at 1% and 3% to a protein-rich feed, that the biochar treatments prevented negative side-effects of pig fattening with protein-rich pigeon peas (Mekbungwan et al., 2008).

One of the more frequently cited studies is that of Kana et al. (2010) who systematically fed two different biochars, one from corncobs and the other from canary tree (Bakeridesia integerrima) seeds, to broiler chickens at different feeding concentrations from 0% to 1% per kg feed. Unfortunately, the production of biochar was only designated as \u201ctraditional\u201d and was not described in detail, but the high ash levels of 47% and 25%, respectively, indicate that a substantial portion of the initial biomass was burned and not fully pyrolyzed. Nevertheless, feeding both biochars up to 0.6% led to greater, mostly significant weight gain, while the higher dosages led to no further significant weight gain, but also to no weight loss compared to the control. Liver weight, abdominal fat nor bowel length and weight were affected by the biochar feeding. The study is an important indication that biochar derived from non-woody biomass and with a higher ash content may also be suitable for feeding, which is so far not allowed by the European Biochar Foundation (EBC) (2012). In a later study with the same biochars, the authors examined whether chickens can, thanks to the biochar supplement, be fed with 20% chickpeas, a feed that is protein-rich but generally difficult for chickens to digest. Surprisingly, when the ash-rich biochar from corncobs was added, the boiled chickpeas could be fed and provided the same weight gain in the broilers as the control without chickpeas. However, the lower-ash biochar from the tree seeds did not show the same effect here (Kana, Teguia & Fomekong, 2012).",

Kutlu, \u00dcnsal & G\u00f6rg\u00fcl\u00fc (2001) also used very high biochar dosages of up to 10% of the base diet, and found that all dosages significantly increased basal feed intake in the first 28 days, and also weight gain and feed efficiency of both broilers and laying hens but did not show significantly higher gains after this initial period.",

Their treatments involved the commercial layer diet (control group) amended with biochar, bentonite and zeolite at 4% w/w, respectively. While bird weight and number of eggs did not differ significantly between the control and the biochar treatment, the total egg weight increased by 5% and the feed conversion ratio increased by 12% compared to the control. Feeding bentonite and zeolite revealed comparable increases and non-significant differences to biochar, respectively. The biochar feed amendment did not result in altered gut microbial community richness and diversity compared to the control. However, individual phylotypes at different phylogenetic levels did respond differently to the three amendments and reduced especially the abundance of Helicobacter and Campylobacter. Both genera are gram-negative and include multiple pathogenic species. The authors demonstrated that biochar, bentonite and zeolite can be used to selectively reduce the abundance of some major poultry zoonotic pathogens without reducing chicken microbiota diversity or causing major shifts in the gut microbial community and are thus a viable alternative to antibiotics in the poultry industry. A recent Vietnamese study on supplementing chicken feed with 1% rice husk biochar confirmed positive effects on pathogen occurrence with reduced plasma triglycerides, total coliform bacteria in litter and E. coli in feces (Hien et al., 2018). However, no impact on live weight gain, feed consumption and feed conversion ratio were observed.",

Irrespective of these issues, supplementing poultry manure biochar at 2% increased the feed conversion ratio by 7% while at 4% biochar supplementation the life weight gain decreased by 8% both compared to the control. No other investigated parameter showed significant differences to the control over the 21-day experimental period.

            "text": "In an Australian trial, groups of 20 layer hens (N = 4) were fed a biochar made at 550 \u00b0C from green wood waste at rates of 0%, 1%, 2% and 4%, respectively (Prasai et al., 2018a) for 25 weeks. While no significant difference in weight gain was observed, the feed conversion ratio improved significantly between 10% and 13% in the three biochar treatments compared to the control without biochar. The egg weight was 5% higher in the 2% biochar treatment and 4% higher in the 4% treatment compared to the control. Standardized indicators of egg quality (i.e., Haugh unit, Albumen height, stability of egg shell) where not changed by the biochar feed amendment. The Yolk color index, however, decreased with increasing biochar dosage. The same effect was also found when bentonite or zeolite was used instead of biochar. Yolk color is mainly the result of carotenoid content (Bov\u0161kov\u00e1, M\u00edkov\u00e1 & Panovsk\u00e1, 2014). Carotenoids are lipophilic organic molecules that accumulated from the feed. Thus, we hypothesize that biochar may sorb a certain amount of lipophilic ingredients of the feed. The N-balance between feed-N intake, egg-N, excreta-N and lost N did not differ significantly between the treatments though the excreta-N was reduced by 20\u201334% in the 2% and 4% biochar treatment compared to the control. The lower recovery of N in excreta is indicative of a more efficient digestive extraction of N, consistent with the observed higher feed conversion efficiency. Remarkably, the inclusion of 2% and 4% biochar maintained egg production at normal levels when birds were challenged with fungal-contaminated feed. In the control treatment, the contaminated feed led to decreased egg production by 16%. The same main author found, in another publication based on a similar trial with the same 1%, 2% and 4% biochar amendments, improvements of the poultry manure especially in regard to granule size, water retention and decomposition characteristics (Prasai et al., 2018b). N-contents in the decomposed poultry manure were lower by 20% and 26%, respectively, in the treatment with 2% and 4% biochar feed compared to the control. NH3-emissions of the manure, measured in a separate experiment using incubated bell jars, increased by 31% in the treatments with 2% and 4% but not with 1% biochar feed amendments compared to the control. This increase in ammonia emissions due to high doses of poultry feed applied biochar is puzzling as the addition of higher dosages (5\u201315% (m/m)) of biochar to poultry manure composting was shown to decrease ammonia emissions between 53% and 89% (Rong et al., 2019). Apparently, biochar affects poultry manure composting differently when applied to the feed versus when applied directly to the manure.",

Japanese flounder were fed with 0\u20134% incremental doses of a bamboo biochar mixed into the regular feed (Thu et al., 2010). While all biochar feed additions resulted in significantly higher flounder weight gains, the variability of individual results was so high that only the 0.5% dose provided statistically significantly higher weight gain rates of 18%. It was noteworthy that all biochar feeding rates resulted in significantly lower nitrogen excretions and reduced the nitrate content in the fish water by >50%. In a South Korean experiment also with flounder, dosages from 0% to 2% of a biochar\u2014wood vinegar blend were fed. At a dose of 1%, the feed efficiency increased significantly by 10%, and also the total weight gain of the fish was significantly higher (Yoo, Ji & Jeong, 2007).

However, as the effect appears dosage independent (0.5% or 1% biochar) it is unlikely that the two substances reduce methane production by the same mechanisms. It may be hypothesized that the biochar acts as a redox-active electron mediator that takes up electrons from microbial oxidation reactions (e.g., oxidation of acetate to CO2) and donates the electron at a certain distance from the microbial reaction center (at another spot of the same biochar particle) to mediate an abiotic reduction of nitrate (Saquing, Yu & Chiu, 2016). Biochar at feeding ratios of about 1% (100 g/day) would not have the capacity to act as terminal electron acceptor for all rumen produced hydrogen considering a daily production of about 200 l methane for the various studies of Leng, Inthapanya & Preston (2012) in SE-Asia and up to 500 l methane for typical cattle in Europe or the US. Nitrate (at 6% of DM intake) would have this capacity as terminal electron acceptor but is not efficient as direct electron acceptor in microbial oxidation reaction due to the toxic effects of its reaction products (i.e., nitrite and ammonia).",

Denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidizing (DAMO) bacteria like Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera belonging to the NC10 phylum were shown to efficiently oxidize methane anaerobically in deep lake sediments (Deutzmann et al., 2014). NC10 DAMO bacteria were equally found in wetlands (Shen et al., 2015), in grassland soils used for animal husbandry (Bannert et al., 2012), and with a robust abundance of 3.8 \u00d7 105 to 6.1 \u00d7 106 copies g\u22121 (dry weight) in flooded paddy fields (Shen et al., 2014). DAMO bacteria were further found in the rumen fluid of Xinong Saanen dairy goats in Southern China. The proportion of NC10 in total bacteria in the rumen fluid was 10%, and it could clearly be seen that NC10 mediated nitrate reduction led to reduced enteric methane emissions (Shen et al., 2016). Notwithstanding further evidence, it may be hypothesized that the additional effect of combined biochar and nitrate supplements is due to the biotic denitrifying methane oxidation that might further be enhanced through electron accepting and redox mediating properties of the biochar. Systematic investigations to better understand the likely mechanisms are urgently needed.",

When the same amount of biochar was combined with 6% potassium nitrate, methane emissions decreased by as much as 40%. In addition to reducing methane emissions, highly significant bovine weight gain (+25%) was observed in the experiment as compared to the control, suggesting an increase in feed efficiency and/or reduced energy conversion losses. The biochar in this and the earlier in vitro trial was produced at high temperatures (HTT = 900 \u00b0C) from silicon-rich rice husks, which suggests a high electrical conductivity and electron buffering capacity (Yu et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2017) which may lead to greater efficiency of fodder-decomposing redox reactions. Leng, Inthapanya & Preston (2013) have further shown that different biochars have different effects on methane emissions. A likely reason for this are differences in electrical conductivity and in electron buffering (Sun et al., 2017) depending on the biomass and pyrolysis temperature, which determine the biochar\u2019s properties of transmitting electrons between different bacterial species.",

Until today, only the research group of Ron Leng were able to produce and reproduce high reduction rates of methane production both in vitro and in vivo.

It might be due to the particular 900\u00b0 gasifier rice-husk biochar or to the non-common feed used in their trials (tannin rich cassava roots and foliage that may provide terminal electron acceptors) or the particular rumen microbiota of the South-East Asian cattle that may contain higher rates of DAMO bacteria.

The methane production was reduced by all biochar treatments and at both concentrations levels by about 5% compared to the control without biochar. There was no significant difference between the different types and amounts of biochar. The absence of significant differences between those very different biochars is puzzling though an important milestone towards the understanding of biochar\u2019s mechanisms in animal digestions because there has to be a common cause leading to the same effect between all these different biochars.",

For a high-forage based diet, 0.5%, 1% and 2% of this acidic biochar reduced methane production by 34%, 16% and 22%, respectively. All other biochars in all of the experiments reviewed here were alkaline (pH between 8 and 11.5). The acidification of biochar not only oxidizes the carbonaceous surfaces and makes the biochar hydrophilic, it also modifies the redox behavior and thus its \u201caffinity\u201d for microbial interaction. As this is, to our knowledge, the first and only experiment to demonstrate a reduction of methane emissions using acidified biochar and as there are no systematic investigations about the acidification effect yet, it is too early to draw a definitive conclusion. However, it is an indication that post-pyrolytic treatment of biochar has the potential to design and optimize the biochar effects in animal digestion, and, notably, to reduce enteric methane emissions.",

Although activated biochar certainly adsorbs strains of the normal, healthy bacterial flora too, adsorption of these bacterial strains was significantly lower than the adsorption of the dangerous E. coli O157: H7 strain, which is gram-negative. Biochar appeared to positively affect the ratio of (certain) beneficial bacterial flora to (certain) pathogenic flora. However, it must be systematically investigated and mechanistically understood for a much larger number of digestive and pathogenic microorganisms, before a more general conclusion can be drawn. Our review suggests that the impact of biochar on microorganisms depends on the cell envelope, that is, the gram-stain with gram-positive (plasma membrane plus 20\u201380 nm of peptidoglycan) not being or being less well sorbed to biochar, while gram-negative bacteria (plasma membrane plus 10 nm peptidoglycan plus outer membrane) are better sorbed.

            "text": "With regard to sorption, biochar can work against human poisoning and drug overdose (Park, 1986), but thus could also counteract intended benefits of drugs. Based on our review, the same can be proclaimed regarding pharmaceuticals used to treat livestock. It is evident that acute, temporary treatment and continuous addition to feed over years do not underlie the same risk assessment. Fujita et al. (2012) conducted a comprehensive study in 2011, where they examined the influence of biochar feeding on hens\u2019 health and egg quality. Histopathological studies showed no changes in the digestive tract or in the liver. Examination of the egg yolk showed that fat-soluble vitamins A and D3 did not show a statistically significant trend towards lower concentrations, but that the vitamin E content in the eggs was reduced by about 40% when hens were fed daily with 0.5% biochar (Fujita et al., 2012). Although all other quality parameters such as fatty acids, oxidative stability and mineral content in the eggs were not affected by biochar feeding, it was the first evidence that a beneficial compound like a vitamin can be significantly reduced by co-feeding biochar. The above mentioned reduction of carotenoids in egg yolks indicated by changes in yolk color (Prasai et al., 2018a) further supports the conclusion that systematic research with well-defined biochars and a focus on liposoluble feed ingredients like vitamin E and carotenoids is needed before industrial scale-up of long-term biochar co-feeding can be safely recommended. However, compared to a large spectrum of other feed additives and ubiquitous pesticide and mycotoxin contamination of animal feed, risks of quality-controlled biochar feed can be considered low, even when supplemented on a regular basis.",

In addition, as required by the EBC, biochar should always be processed and administered moist to avoid the formation of dust (European Biochar Foundation (EBC), 2012). If this is respected, biochar can be added to all common feed mixes and is usually mixable with all common feeds. Feed quality biochar may also be added to animal drinking water and, in the case of acute intoxication, activated biochar should be administered in aqueous suspension (Neuvonen & Olkkola, 1988). Depending on livestock species, the biochar may also be provided in freely accessible troughs on the pasture or in the stable, without previous mixing into daily feed. Often, the biochar is mixed with popular supplements such as molasses (Joseph et al., 2015b) or flavoring such as saccharin, sucrose and the like (Cooney & Roach, 1979). Some German and Swiss farmers inject 1% (vol) of biochar into silage towers or silage bales via automated equipment (O\u2019Toole et al., 2016).",

Activation of biochar significantly increases the specific surface area (from approx. 300 m2 to >900 m2), but the increase in surface area is mainly due to the opening of micropores (<2 nm). These micropores are mostly too small for the higher molecular weight substances or bacterial pathogens relevant for animal digestion. Galvano et al. (1996b) found that biochar with dominating micro porosity (<2 nm) had lower adsorption capacities for mycotoxins due to slow diffusion of these toxins into the pore-system. This was also the case for other investigated toxic compounds such as pesticides, PCBs, dioxins or pathogens, as was demonstrated by Edrington et al. (1997) when highly activated biochar did not reduce the toxic effects of aflatoxin in chickens more strongly than non-activated biochar. Therefore, the activation of biochar may not significantly increase the specific adsorption capacity for certain target substances or organisms. To produce a biochar with a particularly high content of accessible meso and macro pores, downstream activation is not necessary and can be achieved merely by adjusting the pyrolysis parameters. Generally speaking, a higher meso-porosity is achieved at pyrolysis temperatures above 600 \u00b0C (Brewer et al., 2014).",

The analysis of 112 scientific papers on biochar feed supplements has shown that in most studies and for all farm animal species, positive effects on different parameters such as growth, digestion, feed efficiency, toxin adsorption, blood levels, meat quality and/or emissions could be found. However, a relevant part of the studies obtained results that were not statistically significant. Most importantly, no significant negative effects on animal health were found in any of the reviewed publications.",

This applies in particular to the characterization of the biochar itself, which in the majority of studies was insufficiently analyzed. The electrochemical interaction of biochar and organic systems is extremely complex and needs considerable more fundamental research and systematic in vivo trials. Moreover, if biochar\u2019s role within animal digestion is mainly to act as a mediator and carrier substance, the combination with other feed additives and inoculants may be mandatory to achieve the full functionality of biochar for its beneficial use in animal digestion and animal health.",
