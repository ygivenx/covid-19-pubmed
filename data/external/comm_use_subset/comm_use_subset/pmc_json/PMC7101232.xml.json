Researchers from countries with limited funding, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers tend to be the lowest paid and are perhaps more likely to have covered the costs of attending these meetings out of their own pocket (Malloy, 2020). These groups\u2019 risk of financial hardship may be exacerbated by the fact that those with limited resources are often obligated to book the cheapest flights and accommodation, which may not be eligible for refunding or rebooking.

Agencies such as the Canadian Tri-Council have recently adopted such measures and may serve as an example (Fraser and Sauv\u00e9-McCuan, 2020). Funders who have already awarded travel grants to ECRs or scientists from countries with limited research funding could allow the recipients to defer the use of these funds for an additional year. In addition, visa fees can be prohibitively expensive, disproportionately impact researchers from countries with limited research funding, and often are not covered by funding agencies and travel grants. We therefore urge funders that do not currently cover visa fees to consider revising these policies, and to do so retroactively to assist researchers facing financial hardship due to conference and travel cancellations.",

Institutions may also consider offering advances to ECRs who are awaiting refunds or reimbursement from conference organizers, travel providers and funding agencies.

Our current reliance on in-person conferences for networking and career development creates systemic inequalities between those who have the resources to attend conferences regularly and those who do not. Many scientists in developed countries are now pausing to consider the opportunities that they will miss out on as they cancel their travel plans. As we reflect on this, it is important to remember that these experiences are routine for scientists in countries with limited research funding, as well as for those with disabilities or chronic illnesses that limit their attendance at scientific meetings.",

This is an insurmountable financial barrier for many ECRs and scientists from countries with limited research funding (Malloy, 2020).
