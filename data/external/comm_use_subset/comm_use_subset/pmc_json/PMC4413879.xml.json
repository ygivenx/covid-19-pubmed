            "text": "We have previously reported that mice exposed to 10 days of CS (acute exposure\nmodel) during the active phase show reduced locomotor activity associated with\nincreased inflammation30. Similarly, mice exposed to chronic CS\nshowed significantly reduced activity beginning 5 days after the first exposure\nthat persisted for much of the exposure period30. In the present\nstudy, chronic CS-exposed mice infected with IAV (CS+Virus) showed a significant\nreduction in locomotor activity after infection that persisted for the duration\nof measurement (9 days post-infection; Fig.\n1c\u2013d). Chronic air-exposed mice infected with influenza\n(Air+Virus) showed an initial reduction in locomotor activity 1\u20135\ndays after infection with a trough 5\u20136 days after infection followed\nby a modest recovery by day 9 after infection (Fig.\n1c\u2013d). Actograms clearly reveal that the CS+Virus group\nshowed significantly reduced locomotor activity post-infection (lower right\npanel) when compared to Air+Virus, air- and CS-exposed mice (Fig.\n1d and Supplementary Fig. 2a). Limiting our\nanalysis to the dark phase reveals that the primary influence of IAV infection\nwas a reduction in nighttime activity, which was further suppressed in those\nmice previously exposed to chronic CS (Fig. 1c). The\nperiod of locomotor activity in L:D during days 1\u20138 post IAV\ninfection was very similar between air and CS groups, whereas the Air+Virus and\nCS+Virus groups showed increased variation in period between animals although\nthe mean was not statistically different from controls (Fig.\n1e). Analysis of behavior as a function of daily distribution (day\nvs. night) emphasizes the effect of IAV treatment in vivo (Supplementary Fig. 3a-d). Control (air) and Air+Virus infected mice\nwere primarily active (70\u201380% activity) during the dark phase and\nless active (20\u201330%) during the light phase from day 2 to day 9\npost-saline infusion (Supplementary Fig. 3a and c). In three\nof the four groups, we detected a transient change in the distribution of\nactivity on day 1 post-infusion regardless of treatment, suggesting that the\ninfusion procedure acutely and temporarily altered activity (Supplementary Fig. 3a\u2013d). In agreement with our previous\nreport, chronic CS-exposed mice displayed a distribution of locomotor activity\nsimilar to air-exposed mice with the majority (70\u201380%) of activity\nlimited to the dark phase (Supplementary Fig. 3b)30. Following IAV infection in chronic CS-exposed mice nighttime\nactivity declined and daytime activity increased from days 3\u20137\npost-infection such that we detected no difference between day and night\nactivity levels by day 7 (Supplementary Fig. 3d). By day\n8\u20139 post-infection the CS+Virus mice showed recovery of their normal\nnighttime (70\u201380%) and daytime (20\u201330%) distribution of\nactivity (Supplementary Fig. 3d).",

Similar to mice that had been exposed to CS, BMAL1 KO and WT\nlittermates were infected intranasally with 120 HAU (H3N2) IAV. Before IAV\ninfection (Day 0), there was no significant difference in body weight between WT\nand BMAL1 KO mice (Fig. 2a). The body weight of WT and\nBMAL1 KO IAV infected mice dropped by day 2 post-infection and remained low\nuntil day 8 post-infection when compared to control mice of both strains (Fig. 2a). BMAL1 KO-Virus infected mice showed increased\nmortality beginning 5 days post-infection and by day 9 all of the BMAL1 KO mice\ninfected with IAV was deceased (Fig. 2b). WT-Virus\ninfected mice showed increased mortality beginning 7 days post-infection and\nreached a total of 38.5% mortality by day 9 post-infection (Fig.\n2b). There was a significant difference in the body weight and\nmortality of WT-Virus compared to BMAL1 KO-Virus infected mice. This suggests\nthat BMAL1 plays an important role in the host response to IAV infection.\nFurther, our data suggest that circadian disruption may enhance the severity of\ninfection, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality.",

Regardless of\ngenotype, IAV infection significantly reduced activity (Fig.\n2c\u2013d and Supplementary Fig. 2b). Both\nBMAL1 KO and WT mice showed significant reductions in daily activity on days\n1\u20139 post-infection (Fig. 2c\u2013d and\nSupplementary Fig. 2b). The period of locomotor activity\nin L:D on days 1\u20138 post IAV infection was very similar between all\nfour groups, though IAV infected BMAL1 KO mice had greater variability in period\nrelative to the other treatment groups (Fig. 2e). Analysis\nof behavior as a function of daily distribution (day vs. night) emphasizes\ntreatment and genotype specific effects (Supplementary Fig.\n4a\u2013d). As expected, WT-saline treated mice were mostly\nactive during the dark phase (ZT12-24; 70\u201380% of total activity)\nwhile BMAL1 KO-saline treated mice appeared to be arrhythmic and displayed a\nmore even distribution of activity, though levels were still slightly higher at\nnight (Supplementary Fig. 4a\u2013b). IAV infection\naltered the normal distribution of daily activity in both WT and BMAL1 KO mice,\nthough the effects were clearly more dramatic in WT mice (Supplementary Fig. 4c-d). WT mice infected with IAV increased their\ndaytime activity but reduced their nighttime activity, producing apparent\narrhythmia marked by a near equal distribution of activity across the 24h day\n(50% light; 50% dark). This effect of IAV infection on daily activity was less\npronounced in BMAL1 KO mice, due largely to the fact that these mice already\ndisplayed a more equal distribution of daily activity/arrhythmia. That said,\nwithin 2 days of infection mean activity was actually higher in BMAL1 KO mice\nduring the light phase, suggesting a brief period of diurnal preference\nfollowing IAV infection (Supplementary Fig. 4d). This effect\nwas diminished by day 3\u20134 post-infection with mice becoming more\nactive during the night 5\u20139 days post-infection in parallel with\nincreased mortality. These data reveal that, though BMAL1 KO mice differ from WT\nmice in terms of activity distribution prior to infection (most likely due to\nentrainment deficits in KO mice) both strains show reduced nocturnal preference\nfollowing IAV infection.",

Of the known core clock genes, only ror\u03b1 gene\nexpression was not rhythmic in lungs of chronic air- and CS-exposed mice30. The peaks of gene expression rhythms for most clock genes in\nair-exposed controls were similar to those previously reported3031. In both the chronic air- and CS-exposed mice, the\nexpression of bmal1, clock, and cry1 displayed nocturnal\nacrophases, peaking during the mid to late portion of the dark phase (ZT18-24;\nZT0 = lights on: ZT12 = lights off)30. As anticipated, both\nchronic air- and CS-exposed mice showed peaks of per1, per2, cry2,\nrev-erb\u03b1, and rev-erb\u03b2 antiphase to\nbmal1 (between ZT6-ZT12)30. Chronic CS-exposed mice\nshowed a modest reduction in the amplitude of bmal1 and\nrev-erb\u03b1 expression and substantially reduced amplitude of\nper1 expression30. Analysis of clock gene expression 9\ndays after IAV infection in air-exposed mice (Air+Virus) revealed significant\nrhythms of bmal1 (P < 0.001), per1, per2, cry1\nand rev-erb\u03b2 (P < 0.05) but not clock,\ncry2, rev-erb\u03b1 and ror\u03b1 in lung tissue\n(Fig. 3a\u2013b, Supplementary\nFig. 5 and Table 1). Mice exposed to chronic CS and IAV infection\n(CS+Virus) only displayed rhythms of bmal1 (P < 0.01)\nand per1 (P < 0.05) expression in the lungs (Fig. 3a\u2013b, Supplementary Fig. 5 and\nTable 1). Previously reported data from air-exposed mice are shown\nhere for comparison (Fig. 3a\u2013b, Supplementary Fig. 5 and Table 1). In Air+Virus infected mice, the\npeak expression of bmal1, per1, per2, cry1, cry2, and\nrev-erb\u03b2 shifted to the middle of the light phase (ZT6;\nZT0 = lights on; ZT12 = lights off) and the amplitude of gene expression was\naltered at ZT6 when compared to air-exposed controls and chronic CS+Virus group\n(Fig. 3a\u2013b, Supplementary\nFig. 5a-b). As in Air+Virus treated mice, expression of bmal1,\nclock and rev-erb\u03b2 was shifted to peak at mid-day\n(ZT6) in CS+Virus exposed mice (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 5b). However, unlike Air+Virus treated mice, the\nphase of peak per1 and cry2 expression returned to ZT12 and the\nremaining clock genes [per2, cry1, rev-erb\u03b1 and\nror\u03b1] peaked at middle of dark phase (ZT18).\nTogether, these data support the notion that IAV induces circadian disruption in\nthe lungs, though the effects appear to be somewhat attenuated in mice exposed\nto chronic CS (Fig. 3a\u2013b and Supplementary Fig. 5a\u2013b).",

We have\npreviously reported that when examined as a function of time of day (day vs.\nnight) chronic CS-exposed mice show significantly increased lung compliance and\nreduced elastance, but resistance is not significantly reduced30.\nWhen analyzed at specific time points across the day, elastance and resistance\nwere only significantly reduced at ZT18 in chronic CS-exposed mice30. Lung compliance was significantly decreased at ZT12 and ZT24 in\nthe CS+Virus group when compared to the Air+Virus group (Fig.\n6a\u2013b; Tables 2\u20133 and Supplementary Tables\n1\u20133).

These individuals are also commonly diagnosed with\nsleep disorders including obstructive sleep apnea41. Psychological\ndistress in those with COPD is associated with a decline in lung function, increased\nexacerbation frequency and worsening of cardiovascular disease, further disrupting\nsleep in these patients34. Though our experiments did not directly\nmeasure sleep per se (e.g. using polysomnographic recording), the\nconsiderable reduction in activity during the day and night in both WT and BMAL1 KO\nmice following IAV infection implies adaptive changes in the homeostatic or\ncircadian sleep drive that lead to increased inactivity during IAV infection. This\nincrease in sleep/reduced activity level could be as a result of immune/inflammatory\ncell infiltration (e.g. macrophages) that can generate influenza-induced sleep\nenhancement38. Alternative compensatory immune mechanisms that\ngenerate an effective host defense response may also contribute to sleep propensity\nduring viral infection38. It has been suggested that altered\nexpression of Temt (thioether-S-methyltransferase) in the hypothalamus and\nbasal forebrain during IAV infection may influence sleep patterns through its\neffects on prostaglandin metabolism42.",

The effect of IAV infection persisted longer (post-infection day\n7\u20139) in chronic CS-exposed mice, coincident with a decrease in body\nweight and increased mortality. BMAL1 KO mice infected with IAV also displayed a\nsignificant decline in body weight and survival (100% mortality), suggesting that\nproper function of the timing system is necessary for maintaining the innate immune\nresponse to infection. Chronic air- and CS-exposed mice infected with IAV after 6\nmonths of exposure and WT and BMAL1 KO mice infected with IAV show widely varying\nchanges in morbidity (weight) and mortality. This could be due to strain background-\nand age-dependent effects of IAV infection. The mice were 2\u20133 months old\nwhen we started the chronic air and CS exposure. At the end of chronic air and CS\nexposure (6 months) and before IAV infection chronic air- and CS-exposed mice were\nabout 9\u201310 months old. Similarly, WT littermates and BMAL1 KO mice were\n2\u20134 months old when they were infected with IAV. Hence, we speculate the\ntwo confounding factors such as strain background and age of these mice when they\nwere infected with IAV play an essential role on the severity of IAV on the loss of\nbody weight and mortality in vivo. This notion is supported by studies\nwherein circadian desynchronization due to experimental jet-lag increased\ninflammatory responses and mortality following LPS challenge43. It is\nevident that changes in the phase and amplitude of clock gene expression in the\nlungs are affiliated with impaired lung function (compliance, resistance and tissue\nelastance). Analysis of lung function rhythms clearly revealed a near inversion of\npeak phase rhythms of lung function in Air+Virus group compared to air-exposed mice.\nThough generally similar, prior exposure to CS (COPD) did not fully attenuate the\neffects of IAV infection, as there were still slight differences in peak lung\nfunctions in these mice. These changes in lung function rhythms may underlie the\nreduced activity and increased mortality observed among IAV infected mice.",

We have recently shown that CS exposure\nreduced mRNA and protein levels of BMAL1 and BMAL1-CC10 cre (epithelium specific\nBmal1 KO) with augmented inflammatory responses and dysregulation of CS-induced\noxidative stress. These data suggest the involvement of the molecular clock in\nregulation of CS-induced lung inflammation30, which supports previous\nwork indicating that BMAL1 has an anti-inflammatory function1953.\nRecently, Clock\u039419 circadian mutant mouse lung showed\naltered temporal Nrf2 activity complemented with reduced GSH levels, increased\nprotein oxidation and a spontaneous fibrotic-like phenotype54. We\nfound that BMAL1 KO mice also develop a pro-fibrotic phenotype in the lung which\ncould be due to increased ROS levels and altered oxidative stress-mediated cellular\nsenescence5152. BMAL1 deletion in myeloid cells demonstrated\ndiurnal variation in the absolute number of specific monocytes\n(Ly6Chi) in blood and in the spleen under normal conditions which\nwas enhanced during inflamed peritoneum at ZT8 versus ZT053. This\nstudy also revealed that BMAL1 binds to E-boxes in the promoters of Ccl2,\nCcl8 and S100a8 (encoding S100 calcium binding protein A8) and\nrecruits with it members of the polycomb repressor complex (PRC2) thereby allowing\nrepressive histone marks to block transcription and attenuate Ly6Chi\nmonocyte numbers and inflammation at the site of damage53. It has\nbeen shown that the number of leukocytes in the mouse circulation strongly\ncorrelates with circadian variability, such that leukocyte numbers peak at ZT5 and\nrecruitment into the tissues peaks at ZT1317. Keller et al.\ndemonstrated that the role of entire toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) pathway in\nperitoneal macrophages is tightly regulated under the control of circadian clock and\nthus equip the immune cell to face exaggerated response at times18.\nIn the present study, analysis of clock gene expression revealed a significant\nimpact of IAV infection on the expression of core clock genes. There was also a time\nof day-dependent increase in the number of total cells, macrophage counts and\nlymphocyte counts following IAV infection of CS-exposed mice. In the present study,\nthe total numbers of inflammatory cells were significantly increased at ZT24 when\ncompared to ZT0 though they represent the same circadian phase. Previous reports\nsuggest that inflammatory cells in the lungs were significantly increased in BAL\nfluid of mice euthanized 24 h after the last exposure compared to 2 h post-last CS\nexposure5556. These findings suggests that CS exposure has a\nsuppressive effect on the number of inflammatory cells recovered in the lavage,\npossibly due to capillary trapping or increased adhesion, which causes reduction in\nthe numbers recovered from the air spaces at ZT0 compared to ZT24. This finding is\nsupported by increased proinflammatory mediators released into the lung at 24 h\ncompared to 2 h after the last CS exposure, which would attract more inflammatory\ncells into the lung interstitium during CS exposure.",

Similarly, chronic CS exposure also increased MIP-2 and IL-6 at\nZT6/12 when compared to controls. However, IL-6 and MIP-2 levels were dampened in CS\nplus Virus group which could be due to immunosuppressive effects of CS which is in\nline with recent report in which CS exposure suppressed the production of cytokines\nand chemokines after pandemic H1N1 or avian H9N2 virus infection in mice57. It has been shown that the IAV-mediated inflammatory response\nbegins early on day 3 and remains high until day 5\u20137 post-infection58. Subsequently, viral clearance occurs by day 10 in the lungs,\nthereby resolving the inflammatory phenotype, such as inflammatory cellular influx\nand proinflammatory mediators release observed during IAV infection in\nvivo58. Hence, we did not observe significant increases in\npro-inflammatory mediators at day 9 post IAV infection in chronic air- and\nCS-exposed mice. CS-exposed mice infected with IAV showed sign of severe pulmonary\ninflammation, lung permeability damage and mucus hypersecretion which are\ncharacteristic features of acute exacerbation of COPD5960. We have\npreviously reported that mainstream CS exposure at a concentration of\n300 mg/m3 (TPM) for 8 weeks causes significant\nincrease in PAS positive cells in mouse lungs61. In this study, we\nused a low dose side-stream smoke exposure\n(~90\u2013100 mg/m3) for 6 months, that unlike\nmainstream smoke, does not cause mucus production in the chronic CS-exposed mouse\nlungs when compared to Air+Virus and CS+Virus groups. A recent study identified a\nregulatory mechanism, whereby the lung epithelial clock and glucocorticoid hormones\ncontrol both time-of-day variation and magnitude of pulmonary inflammatory responses\nto bacterial infection62. Similarly, rhythms of pulmonary function\ndefine time-of-day dependent sensitivity to steroids and \u03b22-agonists in\npatients with nocturnal asthma and asthmatics who smoke636465.\nHence, it is possible that the mechanism that couples the circadian clock and\nbronchiolar glucocorticoid receptor to pulmonary innate immunity plays an essential\nrole during COPD exacerbations by IAV infection. These data suggest that temporal\nincreases in chemoattractants, leukocyte trafficking, proinflammatory\ncytokines/chemokines, and phagocytic ability before the activity phase is indicative\nof clock-controlled sensitivity and immunosurveillance. Collectively, these data\nsuggest that the molecular clock and associated transcription factors, epigenetic\nregulators, and key regulatory signaling pathways play an essential role in cytokine\ngene expression through temporal gating of immune responses.",

Only two prior reports determined\nthe effects of IAV infection combined with chronic CS exposure model7071. Robbins et al. were the first to show chronic CS affects\nprimary antiviral immune-inflammatory responses, yet secondary immune protection\nremained intact suggesting exaggerated inflammatory responses during viral infection\nmight possibly influence decline in clinical status associated with COPD\nexacerbations70. Wortham et al. demonstrated NKG2D\nstimulation during chronic CS exposure plays an essential role in the development of\nNK cell hyper-responsiveness and influenza-mediated exacerbations of COPD71. Based on the published studies, it is evident that both acute and\nchronic CS exposure combined with influenza infection causes increased pulmonary and\nsystemic inflammation in vivo which was accompanied by increased viral\nproliferation or reduced clearance5867. In this study, the dynamics\nof viral proliferation were not affected; instead we observed an exaggerated\ninflammatory response and apparent normalization of lung function rhythms in chronic\nCS-exposed mice infected with IAV. The discrepancies observed in previous studies\ninclude CS exposure protocols, dose and duration of CS exposure (acute vs. chronic),\nviral dose (low and high) used, time of virus infection (ZT0-24) and duration\npost-infection of analyses. Regardless of these discrepancies, these studies support\nthe fact that CS-induced inflammation plays a defining role in the initial\ninflammatory responses to IAV infection in the lungs. It is possible that\nIAV-mediated resetting of clock function in the lungs may influence the survival of\nmice previously exposed to chronic CS. The re-alignment of many of the clock genes\nfollowing IAV infection may represent transient\n\u2018sensitization\u2019 of the timing system to an acute inflammatory\nmediator1272. It is worth noting that, outside of\nror\u03b1, only those clock genes associated with the repressive function of\nthe clock (per1,2 and cry1,2) were in effect \u2018phase-reset\u2019 by\nIAV. This suggests a disparate influence of IAV infection on the oscillator, a\nphenomenon reported previously in response to dual entrainment by multiple cues in\nthe liver73.",

The\nrole of the clock gene BMAL1 in COPD exacerbation was tested using the IAV infection\nmodel. Overall, our findings clearly show that the circadian clock plays a crucial\nrole in modulating immune-inflammatory response during viral respiratory infection\nin mice. The COPD exacerbation mouse model develops augmented inflammatory responses\nand lung damage due to involvement of clock-dependent mechanisms that in turn affect\nimmune response and rhythms of lung function. Understanding molecular clock function\nand its physiological significance in different animal models of chronic lung\ndisease, including our COPD exacerbation model, could hasten the development of\nnovel chronotherapeutic approaches for the treatment and management of COPD and\nassociated exacerbations.",
