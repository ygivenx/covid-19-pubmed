This process is activated by a diverse array of cellular stressors such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and microbial infection [3,4]. Especially, the autophagic pathways are modulated by oxidative stress response to oxygen tension and oxidant [5]. There is an emerging body of evidence that autophagy regulates various cellular processes and cell fates, including cellular death and senescence, inflammation and immune function [6]. In addition, maladaptive or pathogenic aftereffects such as aberrant accumulation of proteins are observed. Accordingly, impaired autophagy has been implicated in many pathological conditions of neurological disorders, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes and cancer [7]. Targeting autophagic pathways and their regulatory components may lead to the development of therapeutics.",

            "text": "Some environmental factors such as air pollutants may cause an extreme increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in the airways [8]. Oxidative stress contributes to airway and lung damage and consequently to several respiratory inflammatory diseases, including cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [9]. Also, excessive production of ROS is thought to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of asthma, where exhaled levels of ROS positively correlate with disease severity [10]. Recent investigation has shown a crucial involvement of autophagy in the pathogenic processes underlying pulmonary diseases [11]. Indeed, autophagy is observed in the lung in response to oxidative stress evoked by the exposure to environmental toxicants [7,11]. Thus, the role of autophagy in pulmonary toxicity may offer new clues to strategies to treat lung injury linked to oxidative stress [12]. However, whether autophagy is responsible for promoting cell survival or cytotoxicity in the airways and lung remains elusive. In addition, the function of autophagy in the disease pathogenesis is still unclear and may entail impaired or elevated autophagic activity or imbalances in the activation of autophagic proteins.",

TGF-\u03b21, a pleiotropic cytokine that has been established as a central mediator of tissue fibrosis, regulates autophagy and manipulates many critical aspects of disease-conditions associated with fibrosis and injury responses [13]. Hence, understanding the cellular mechanism of TGF-\u03b21-related autophagic process is crucial for identifying potential new therapeutic targets. On the other hand, a recent report indicates that fibroblasts in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis acquire resistance to apoptosis and autophagy [14]. Autophagy inhibition induces acceleration of epithelial cell senescence and myofibroblast differentiation of lung fibroblasts which is an underlying mechanism of the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [15].",

One investigation reveals that pretreatment with astragalin can improve survival during lethal endotoxemia and attenuate inflammatory responses in a murine model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury [17]. Our recent study showed that astragalin antagonized endotoxin-induced oxidative stress leading to epithelial eosinophilia and apoptosis [18]. However, the inhibitory effects of astragalin on pulmonary fibrosis and autophagy are not yet elucidated. Based on the literature evidence that astragalin possesses antioxidant property and anti-allergic activity [17,18], the current study investigated whether astragalin inhibited epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) leading to pulmonary fibrosis and autophagic activity of H2O2-exposed airway epithelial BEAS-2B cells and in ovalbumin (OVA)-challenged mice. Furthermore, the interconnection between pulmonary fibrosis and autophagy under oxidative episodes was explored to emphasize a role underlying autophagy in asthmatic fibrosis.",

The non-purified diet composition is as follows: NLT (Not Less Than) 20.5% crude protein, NLT 3.5% crude fat, NMT (Not More Than) 8.0% crude fiber, NMT 8.0% crude ash, NLT 0.5% calcium and NLT 0.5% phosphorus. Mice were allowed to acclimatize for 1 week before beginning the experiments. Mice were divided into four subgroups (n = 6 for each subgroup). Mice were sensitized with 20 \u03bcg OVA dissolved in a solution of 30 \u03bcl PBS and 50 \u03bcl Imject Alum by a subcutaneous injection twice on day 0 and day 14. For the dietary interventions, 0.1 ml astragalin solution (10 or 20 mg/kg BW) was orally administrated to OVA-sensitized mice 1 h before challenge. On day 28, 29 and 30, 5% OVA inhalation to mice was performed for 20 min in a plastic chamber linked to an ultrasonic nebulizer (Clenny2 Aerosol, Medel, Italy). Control mice were sensitized and challenged with PBS as the OVA vehicle. Twenty four hours after the latest provocation (day 30), all mice were killed with an anesthetic (2 \u03bcl/kg rompun and 8 \u03bcl/kg zoletil, i.p.). The trachea was cannulated, and both lungs and airways were rinsed in 1 ml PBS for the collection of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). The numbers of inflammatory cells including eosinophils in BALF were determined using a Hemavet HV950 Multispecies Hematologic Analyzer (Drew Scientific, Oxford, CT). The right lungs were collected, frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at \u221280\u00b0C until used for Western blotting. Left lungs were preserved and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and then used for immunohistochemical analyses. The total inflammatory cell number in the BALF of mice exposed to OVA increased with a predominance of eosinophils (Figure 1C). The oral administration of astragalin deterred the increase in the number of eosinophils in OVA-treated mice, indicating that astragalin alleviated airway inflammation.",

In addition, allergic asthma due to the exposure to environmental antigens may entail an increase in endogenous ROS formation, causing oxidative stress-induced injury to the respiratory system and antioxidant defenses [22,23]. In this study the ROS production was highly induced in airway tissues of OVA-challenged mice. Recent research suggests that the use of redox-based therapy to attenuate levels of ROS provides a potential strategy to alleviate oxidative stress-induced airway inflammation in patients with asthma [22,24]. Therapeutic interventions that reduce the exposure to environmental ROS or augment endogenous antioxidant defenses might be beneficial as adjunctive therapies in asthmatic patients [25]. Our recent study showed that astragalin may be a potent antioxidant antagonizing endotoxin-induced oxidative stress [18]. In addition, astragalin blunted H2O2 -promoted epithelial apoptosis concomitant with nuclear condensation or caspase-3 activation. Currently, astragalin suppressed the airway infiltration of inflammatory cells following the exposure of mice to the OVA antigen.",

Oxidative stress has been implicated as an important molecular mechanism underlying fibrosis in the lungs [26]. However, the causal role of ROS released from inflammatory/interstitial cells in mediating fibrosis is not firmly established. Pulmonary fibrosis, a progressive and lethal lung disease, is characterized by inflammation and accumulation of ECM components [27]. This study showed that the oxidant H2O2 enhanced the collagen type-1 production and the OVA antigen augmented the collagen fiber deposition in the airway subepithelial compartments. Pulmonary fibrosis as well as how best to relieve an imbalance in ROS production would be major therapeutic challenges for which new strategies are warranted. In the present study astragalin as an antioxidant was effective in encumbering airway fibrosis triggered by oxidative stress. Unfortunately, this study did not examine the key origins of oxidative stress in OVA-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Nevertheless, novel insights into unique therapeutic targets of astragalin for managing ROS-induced pulmonary fibrosis need to be provided.",

One investigation showed that the potent antioxidant N-acetylcysteine inhibited TGF-\u03b21-induced EMT in a rat epithelial cell line and in primary rat alveolar epithelial cells, indicating that oxidative stress might be responsible for pulmonary function and the antioxidant possess its beneficial effects on idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [29]. In this study astragalin allayed the EMT process by restoring E-cadherin expression and reducing vimentin induction in oxidant-experienced airway epithelial cells and OVA-challenged airway tissues. There is growing evidence suggesting that EMT entails TGF-\u03b21 in alveolar epithelial cells and may contribute to airway remodeling in severe asthma and fibrotic lung diseases [10]. In addition, the association between ROS and TGF-\u03b21-induced fibrosis has been discussed [26]. Oxidative stress elicits the production of cytokines and growth factors that may play a pivotal role in invasive myofibroblastic differentiation and collagen deposition. One can speculate that astragalin alleviated oxidative stress and blocked TGF-\u03b21 production, which might lead to the inhibition of airway EMT and fibrosis.",

In this study astragalin inhibited the autophagosome formation from oxidant-exposed airway epithelial cells and in airway tissues of OVA-inhaled mice through reducing the induction of beclin-1 and LC3A/B. These findings indicate that oral administration of astragalin may attenuate the oxidative stress-induced autophagy and consequent fibrosis.

The phenolic compounds of rutin and curcumin function as a possible effective stimulator of fatty acid-induced autophagy via mTOR-dependent pathways in nonchemical induced-hepatic stellate cells that can transdifferentiate into myofibroblast-like cells, indicating their benefits for alleviating liver fibrosis [32]. In addition, the autophagy inhibition induces acceleration of epithelial cell senescence [15]. Accordingly, whether autophagy is responsible for promoting epithelial toxicity or survival in airways and lung should be clarified. Ultimately, the unique role of autophagy in pulmonary toxicity linked to oxidative stress may provide novel clues to strategies to treat pulmonary fibrosis [12].",
