            "text": "Proteolytic cleavage is one of the few irreversible posttranslational modifications. It plays a key role in numerous developmental and physiological processes, including digestion, protein degradation, endocrine signaling and cell division [1]. This process is controlled by proteases (also known as peptidases or proteinases) that selectively cleave the peptide bonds between amino acids in specific protein or peptide substrates. Proteases have central roles in \u2018life or death\u2019 processes. Through the highly selective proteolytic processing, proteases can precisely regulate a myriad of biological processes across all living organisms [1]. In addition, these are also many other proteases involved in protein degradation rather than processing, for example cathepsin D and cathepsin B. Pepsin, trypsin and chymotrypsin also come into this category, even though they have a defined specificity because they degrade so many substrates, most of which are foreign to the body [2]. The malfunction or deregulation of proteases results in many pathological conditions [3]. For example, proteases are often associated with cancer invasion and metastasis because of their ability to degrade the extracellular matrix [4\u20138]. Intriguingly, proteases can function as part of an extensive network of proteolytic interactions through interacting with other important signaling pathways involving other protein substrates and enzymes, termed the \u2018protease web\u2019 [9].",

The precise understanding of the biological function of a protease requires the identification of the complete repertoire of its natural substrates and corresponding substrate cleavage sites [10, 11]. The specificity of proteases can vary significantly, depending on the protease and the active sites, with the cleavage site selectivity ranging from preferences for limited and specific amino acids at specific positions, to more general preferences with little discrimination. Current experimental methods for proteolytic cleavage characterization include one-dimensional and two-dimensional gel-based methods (used for identifying the substrates) [12], N-terminal peptide identification methods (for identifying both substrates and cleavage sites), methods using mass spectrometry, as well as quantitation methods of proteolysis to better understand the dynamics and extent of proteolytic events such as the TAILS method [13]. Despite the advances of these experimental methods, they are labor intensive, expensive and time-consuming, and are often limited to the investigation of one protease each time. In this context, it is highly desirable to develop cost-effective computational methods that can be used to identify the target substrates for a specific protease and to facilitate the characterization of substrate specificity and the function of proteases.",

            "text": "The importance and value of the in silico identification of protease target substrates and cleavage sites has led to the development of a variety of computational methods for predicting protease-specific substrates and cleavage sites. A number of computational studies have suggested that substrate cleavage sites (sites surrounding the cleavage P1 sites) targeted by proteases present unique structural and physicochemical properties that vary across different proteases, which can be exploited to predict potential cleavage sites [11, 14\u201324]. However, the most successful computational methods use a combination of these features with other complementary features [10, 14\u201316, 25\u201331], achieving overall accuracies of 70\u201390% for most of the proteases under investigation. A consensus resulting from such computational methods is that machine learning algorithms that take into consideration integrated heterogeneous information can be used to build more accurate predictive models for most of the proteases under investigation. Often a consensus scoring mechanism is performed using scoring function-based techniques or machine learning techniques. The former includes PeptideCutter [32], PoPS [33] and SitePrediction [34]. The latter has gained significant interest in recent years and includes CASVM [35], Cascleave [15], Pripper [36], Cascleave 2.0 [30], PROSPER [29, 31] and PROSPERous [37]. For the substrate cleavage site prediction of specific proteases, some ad hoc consensus schemes can also be effective, including GraBCas [38], CaSPredictor [39] and GPS-CCD [40].",

To date, the PROSPER server has attracted >25 000 unique users worldwide and has processed >60 000 job submissions since its inception.

The cleavage site prediction models are trained and optimized to achieve best-performing prediction by performing a 5-fold cross-validation test. Benchmarking experiments indicated that the iProt-Sub method compared favorably with recently published methods. Moreover, mapping of the protease-specific cleavage target substrates at the proteome-wide scale was highly accurate and selective. iProt-Sub is accessible through a user-friendly Web application available at http://iProt-Sub.erc.monash.edu/. The Web application of iProt-Sub features a powerful and convenient graphic interface that allows the visualization and analysis of the predicted cleavage site within the same protein by different proteases simultaneously.

Through an effective feature extraction, selection and model learning strategy, iProt-Sub consistently achieves improved predictive performance for predicting the substrate cleavage sites for all tested proteases and (5) completely redesigned interface. The new iProt-Sub Web server now provides a more user-friendly and interactive interface that enhances user experience. The overall flowchart of the iProt-Sub methodology is shown in Figure 1.\n",

In this study, we constructed a well-prepared benchmark data set for assessing the predictive performance of our method and other existing methods. For this purpose, we used the MEROPS database [46], which is a comprehensive information resource for proteases, their substrates and inhibitors. Only experimentally verified substrate sequences and cleavage sites were retrieved. The annotations of experimentally verified cleavage sites and the corresponding proteases that cleave the target substrates were extracted from MEROPS, while the annotations of protein identifiers of the substrates and their sequence information were extracted from UniProt [47]. In particular, exopeptidases (aminopeptidases, carboxypeptidases, etc.) and oligopeptidases were generally not included, which is consistent with our previous study [29]. As we are more interested in predicting cleavages within native proteins, peptidases that work at pH extremes and are likely to degrade only denatured proteins were also excluded [29].",

The overall size of the sliding window was 16 sites.

This is because all the existing machine learning algorithms can only handle vectors but not sequences, as elucidated in [65]. However, a vector defined in a discrete model may completely lose all the sequence-pattern information. To avoid this for proteins, the pseudo amino acid composition (AAC) [66] or PseAAC [67] was proposed. Ever since the concept of PseAAC was proposed, it has been widely used in nearly all the areas of computational proteomics (see, e.g., [68\u201370] as well as a long list of references cited in [71]). According to the concept of general PseAAC [41], a protein sequence can be formulated as:\n(1)P=[\u03a81 \u03a82 \u22ef \u03a8u \u22ef \u03a8\u03a9]T,\nwhere T is a transpose operator, while the subscript \u03a9 is an integer and its value as well as the components \u03a8u (u=1, 2, \u22ef, \u03a9) depend on the way to extract the desired information from the amino acid sequence of P, as done in a series of recent publications (see, e.g., [72\u201378]).",

            "text": "Here, we used a variety of sequence-derived features to generate various different modes of general PseAAC that have proven useful in our previous studies. These include:\nBinary sequence profile feature (termed as BINARY), which refers to the encoding of amino acid sequences using the 21-bit (20 amino acid types plus a 21-th gap-filling residue \u2018X\u2019) binary encoding method, as previously described [37, 51]. For a local sliding window of 16 amino acids to encode a potential cleavage site, the dimensions of this feature type are 21 \u00d7 16 = 336.Composition of k-spaced amino acid pair (CKSAAP) [54, 56\u201359], which was originally termed as collocated amino acid pair encoding [56, 57, 93]. This encoding reflects the short-range interactions of residues within the sequence surrounding potential cleavage sites [59]. Taking k = 0 as an example, there are 400 distinct types of 0-spaced amino acid pairs (i.e. AA, AC, AD, \u2026, YY). Then, a feature vector can be defined as:\n(2)(NAANtotal,NACNtotal, NADNtotal,\u2026,NYYNtotal)400.\nThe value of each descriptor denotes the composition of the corresponding amino acid pair in the protein or peptide sequence. For example, if the amino acid pair AA appears n times in the sequence, the composition of the amino acid pair AA is equal to n divided by the total number of 0-spaced amino acid pairs (Ntotal) in the local sliding window. We defined L to be the length of the local sliding window of cleavage site. In this case, L = 16, and the value of Ntotal is L\u2014(k + 1). In this study, the CKSAAP encoding was performed over k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. Thus, the dimension of the CKSAAP feature vector is 400 \u00d7 6 = 2400.K-nearest neighbor (KNN) features, which describe the cluster information of local sequences for predicting potential sites [58, 60]. This feature type ranks the top K peptides by computing the similarity scores between the query peptide and all peptides in both the positive and negative sets [58]. The similarity score between two peptide sequences P1 and P2 is defined as:\n(3)Score=\u2211i=1nS(P1,i, P2,i),(4)S(a,b)={BLOSUM62(a,b), if(BLOSUM62)>00, if(BLOSUM62)\u22640,\nwhere P is the peptide with n amino acids, i is the amino acid position in the sequence and BLOSUM62a,b is the corresponding element value for amino acids a and b in the BLOSUM62 matrix. Then, the ratio of positive samples in the top K peptides will be calculated. In this study, we set K = 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9% of the total numbers of positive and negative samples.AAC, which is based on the calculation of the occurrence frequency of each of the 20 amino acid types in a local window. The frequencies of all 20 natural amino acids (i.e. \u2018ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY\u2019) can be calculated as:\n(5)f(a)=N(a)L, a\u2208{A,C,D,\u2026,Y},\nwhere N(a) is the number of occurrences of amino acid a, while L is the local window length. The dimension of the AAC feature vector is 20.",

Second, the \u2018mRMR-FS\u2019 model achieved the overall best performance, after the two-step feature selection, compared with the other models for the MMP cleavage site prediction. For example, the \u2018mRMR-FS\u2019 model achieved an AUC of 0.968 for MMP-2 cleavage site prediction, while the second best \u2018ALL-Fea\u2019 model achieved an AUC of 0.892. Third, the accuracy of protease-specific cleavage site prediction varies substantially between different proteases and different protease families. The difficult cases include cleavage site prediction of the MMP family and other proteases (e.g. thrombin) whose activities are also regulated by confounding factors such as the presence of exosites (sites that are located outside the active sites) [120\u2013122]. Compared with the caspases and granzyme B, the performance of cleavage site prediction with the MMP family achieved by a model using the same encoding scheme is much worse in terms of the AUC score. For example, the CKSAAP model only achieved an AUC of 0.502 and 0.581 for the cleavage site predictions of MMP-2 and MMP-3, respectively, compared with that of 0.914 and 0.922 for the cleavage site prediction of caspase-3 and caspase-7, respectively (Figure 2). Future studies should investigate incorporation of other relevant features that might prove useful for improving the predictive performance of cleavage sites for proteases with a requirement for allosteric regulation to cleave their target substrates.",

Notably, it can be seen that a predominant characteristic of substrate cleavage sites of caspases (caspase-3, -6, -7 and -8) is the requirement of Asp residue at the P1 position [125]. For certain caspases (e.g. caspase-3 and -7), there is also a lesser selectivity for Asp residue at the P4 position, thereby constituting the canonical DXXD motif [125]. A commonality of the cleavage selectivity of granzyme B, compared with that of caspases, is that they primarily recognize and cleave after the Asp at the P1 position as well. On a closer look, we can see that there exist subtle differences in the substrate cleavage selectivity between granzyme B (human) and granzyme B (mouse) [126]. Apparently, granzyme B (mouse) has a more complicated preference favoring a number of residue types across different positions surrounding the cleavage sites, including Val, Pro and Gly at the P1 position; Ser at the P1\u2032 position; and Gly at the P2\u2032 position, respectively, while granzyme B (human) has much less selectivity at these positions.",

Specifically, Gly was significantly overrepresented at the P7, P4, P2, P1, P3\u2032 and P6\u2032 positions surrounding the cleavage sites (P < 0.05, Figure 3). Owing to the intriguing selectivity of multiple residue types across different positions, it is much more difficult to clearly define distinctive sequence motifs for the MMPs.

After the two-step feature selection based on mRMR and FFS, seven types of features remained in the final optimal feature subset of cleavage site prediction for eight proteases. To evaluate the contribution of these seven different feature types to the classification performance for individual proteases, the performance difference can be measured using the AUC value when a particular feature type is removed from the classifier. This measure thus represents the additional value of such feature type in cleavage site prediction, accounting for both interaction and compensatory effects between features [127].

PoPS is one of the most popular bioinformatics tools for modeling and predicting substrate specificity. It creates a simple matrix-based specificity model with different weights for amino acid residues at different positions, built from experimental data or expert knowledge and available to the user [33]. The specificity model can be used to score, predict and rank likely cleavage sites within a given substrate sequence for the designated protease of interest. SitePrediction is also a general prediction tool for predicting cleavage sites in candidate substrates. To make an accurate prediction, SitePrediction also considers other additional features that describe the environment of potential cleavage sites (including solvent accessibility, secondary structure and sequence similarity to the known cleavage sites) in conjunction with the amino acid frequency scores [34]. Both PoPS and SitePrediction are regarded as statistical scoring function-based tools, while Cascleave and iProt-Sub are considered as machine learning-based tools.",

The top five significantly overrepresented biological process (BP), cellular component (CC), and molecular function (MF) terms, and KEGG pathways of the predicted substrate proteins for caspase-3, caspase-6, MMP-2 and MMP-3 at the proteome scale are highlighted in Figures 8 and 9, respectively. The sectorial area for a GO term represents the number of proteins with this term, while the different colors of the sectorial area indicate the statistical significance of the enrichment for the corresponding GO term. In general, substrate proteins targeted by different protease families tend to be associated with different GO terms, but substrate proteins within the same family share similar GO terms. For example, both caspase-3 and caspase-6 substrates were found to be enriched with the GO BP terms \u2018Cell adhesion\u2019 and \u2018Biological adhesion\u2019 and with the GO MF terms \u2018ATP binding\u2019 and \u2018adenyl ribonucleotide binding\u2019. Similar tendencies can also be observed between the MMP-2 and MMP-3 substrates. With regard to the CC terms, many of the predicted substrates were found to be located in different components, including \u2018Nuclear lumen\u2019, \u2018Intracellular organelle lumen\u2019, \u2018Organelle lumen\u2019 and \u2018Cytoskeleton\u2019, where many apoptotic morphological changes and cellular signaling activities often occur [130].\n",

Note that all these experimentally verified cleavage sites were on the top-ranking list of hits according to the predicted probability score generated by iProt-Sub, and all were above the threshold of 0.95. Moreover, iProt-Sub-based substrate sequence scanning also led to the prediction of several other high-confidence novel potential cleavage sites for both caspase-3 and MMP-2 (Figure 10). These predicted cleavage sites may represent novel sites targeted for cleavage under different conditions, and require follow-up experimental validation and hypothesis-driven studies.

Accordingly, it remains a significant challenge in the future to identify further useful encoding schemes. There is much promise in this aspect from the availability of some recently developed powerful toolkits and Web servers for extracting a wide range of features, including Pse-Analysis [87], Bio-Seq Analysis [85], Pse-in-One [91], repDNA [81] and iFeature [134].
