Soon after, HCoV-NL63 was identified in a seven-month-old infant with bronchiolitis and conjunctivitis in 20041, and followed by HCoV-HKU1 in 20052. Later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) rapidly spread worldwide with fatality rates up to 30%3. Several reports have recently demonstrated the existence of a SARS-like coronavirus, which indicates that coronavirus-associated respiratory tract infections continue to have a significant epidemic potential4\u20136. Therefore, there remains an urgent requirement for standardization of treatments in order to develop more effective interventional strategies for coronavirus-associated diseases.",

Antiviral drugs, including ribavirin, lopinavir, and ritonavir, were prescribed soon after SARS-CoV was identified as the causative agent7, 8. Type I interferon was also used owing to its inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV replication9. Furthermore, the use of convalescent plasma or immunoglobulin was reported for the treatment of SARS10. More frequently, corticosteroids, including methylprednisolone alone or in combination with antiviral drugs, were administered to SARS patients to prevent immunopathological lung damage11, although the timing and dosage regimens for steroid administration were controversial12, 13. The administration of high-dose pulses of methylprednisolone has been associated with psychic derangements, acute myopathy, and osteonecrosis14\u201316. Considering the fact that these disorders usually progress to a chronic state, we propose that the SARS survivors may suffer from metabolic disturbances, resulting in systemic pathologies in the long-term. Metabolites, including phosphatidylinositol (PI) and lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI), are associated with cellular entry and/or egress of respiratory viruses17, 18. However, it remains unknown whether or not serum levels of PI and LPI are disregulated during recovery of SARS infections.",

Sixteen of the recovered SARS patients (64%) had suffered lung infections during the past 12 years (Table 1). The susceptibility of respiratory tract was also suggested by the fact that 13 of the 25 subjects (52%) reported having had a cold at least five times in the past year, as compared with the healthy volunteers, in which all patients reported having had less than five colds in the past year (data not shown). In addition, the recovered SARS patients had a tendency to have HL (68%), CVA (44%), and AGM (60%) (Table 1). Urine screening detected red blood cells in 8 of the 24 SARS subjects (33%); of these, 2 patients (8%) exhibited abnormal urine protein levels. More subjects in the recovered SARS group had a neutrophil ratio and triiodothyronine levels below the normal ranges (20% and 8%, respectively) than in the healthy volunteers (12% and 0%, respectively). Similarly, as compared with the healthy volunteers, more subjects in the recovered SARS group had triglyceride (TG) levels and very low-density lipoprotein concentrations (VLDL-C) above the normal ranges (Table 1 and S1). Together with the SF-36 Health Survey (Fig. 1), these data demonstrated that the recovered SARS patients had a poor quality of life 12 years following recovery, and were susceptible to inflammation, tumors, and glucose and lipid metabolic disorders.\n",

In addition, the serum levels of proline, histine, and pyroglutamic acid, which can be converted into glutamic acid and enter the TCA cycle for further energy production or substance synthesis, were increased in the SARS patients compared with healthy volunteers. While the levels of free carnitine were decreased in the SARS patients compared with healthy volunteers, the levels of carnitines C18:0 and C18-OH were increased (Fig. 3). The ratio of carnitine (C16 + C18) to free carnitine ((C16 + C18)/C0) was also increased (Fig. 3), which suggested that fatty acids could easily enter the mitochondria for further \u03b2-oxidation in the recovered SARS patients. The serum levels of sarcosine and spermidine were increased in recovered SARS patients compared with healthy volunteers, whereas the levels of citrulline and arginine, which are intermediates of the urea cycle, were decreased (Fig. 4), thus suggesting that there was an increased requirement for arginine in the urea cycle in the recovered SARS patients.\n\n",

More LPIs were produced, which was associated with the release of FFA 20:4, in recovered SARS patients compared with healthy volunteers, which may have been due to the elevated levels of PIs; thus, SARS patients may be more sensitive to PLA2 activity (Fig. 6B).

A significant proportion of these recovered patients were reported as having lung infections, HL, CVA, AGM, or other sequelae. Serum metabolomics analyses identified systemic metabolic alterations in these patients. The predominant metabolic dysregulations were observed in the serum, with serum levels of PIs, LPIs, FFAs, and LPCs showing the greatest disruptions. Compared with the other differentially expressed metabolites, LPIs and PIs were markedly upregulated in the recovered SARS patients. The serum levels of LPIs and PIs were not influenced by sequelae observed in these survivors (Tables S2\u2013S5). Subjects were regrouped based on metabolic syndromes. Statistical analyses of such subgroups indicated that the identified metabolic alterations were not associated with HL, CVA, or AGM (Figs S1\u2013S3). But, our results suggested that early steroid treatment could have an effect on the serum levels of PIs or LPIs in recovered SARS patients. However, in rat experiments, the levels of the detected PIs in rats intraperitoneally injected with methylprednisolone groups (10 or 30 mg/kg) were comparable to those of the untreated rats (Table S6), suggesting that the effect of steroid treatment on serum lipid metabolism is more complex than what we thought.",

LPI stimulates insulin release23, and activation of the G-protein coupled receptor 55 (GPR55) can increase plasma insulin levels and glucose tolerance24. Lipidomic analyses also demonstrated increasing LPI levels in a pre-type 1 diabetic mouse model25. In the present study, increased rates of glycolysis with few effects on the TCA cycle were observed in the recovered SARS patients, suggesting an association between LPI and glucose metabolism in recovered SARS patients. As a result of the broad expression of GPR55 across various tissues, LPI exerts diverse regulatory roles, including in the excitability of dorsal root ganglion neurons26, intestinal inflammation27, and the migration and orientation of human breast cancer28. This may explain the various symptoms observed in the recovered SARS patients. LPI-associated disorders may persist as long as the high serum LPI levels remain.",

First, we cannot rule out the possibility that some of the patients with glucose metabolic disorders had taken medication prior to the analyses, which may have influenced their physiological status. Second, although we endeavored to recruit as many recovered patients as possible, the sample size was small. Third, the best controls for the investigation of steroid treatment effects were to recruit SARS patients without steroid treatment. Because of lack of those controls, non-SARS patients with severe pneumonia with or without steroid treatment were collected in present study, but they may not exactly mimic the two key elements of SARS infection: steroid treatment and SARS virus infection. Therefore, the reasons for the marked increases in serum levels of LPIs and PIs in recovered SARS patients require further investigation. Changes in metabolite levels observed in our study may not reflect the real situation exactly.",

Then, 400 \u00b5L chloroform was added and the mixture was vortexed for another 30 seconds. After that, 120 \u00b5L water was added and the extraction mixture, vortexed, and centrifuged (8,000 x g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C) to form aqueous-organic separation phases. Two, 200 \u00b5L aliquots of the upper organic phase were drawn and dried, respectively, in a vacuum centrifuge and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until analysis. Quality control (QC) samples were produced by pooling equal serum aliquots from each sample, containing the average metabolome information from the real samples included in this study. For LC-MS, GC-MS metabolic profiling and lipidomics, QC sample pretreatment was performed using the same method as that used for the actual patient samples. The QC sample was run every 10 real samples to evaluate the repeatability of sample pretreatment and for batch analysis of each analytical platform. The lipidome was analyzed using UPLC (Waters) and triple-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (AB Sciex) systems. Prior to the analysis, the dried serum samples were reconstituted in 20 \u00b5L CHCl3-MeOH solution (2:1 v/v) and then diluted in a mixed solvent containing ACN-MeOH-H2O (65:30:5 v/v/v). Subsequently, 5 \u00b5L of the diluted samples were separated using a C8 ACQUITYTM column (150 \u00d7 2.1 mm, 1.7 \u00b5m internal diameter). The column temperature and elution rate were set at 55 \u00b0C and 0.26 mL/min, respectively.

Further unknown ions detected in blank samples were deleted if their intensity proportion in the blank sample was more than 1% compared with the average intensity levels in the experimental samples. The 80% rule was applied to remove peaks with missing values surpassing 20% in both groups. For mass spectrometry response normalization in both GC-MS and LC-MS analyses, the raw peak areas for each ion or metabolite were normalized to that of adjacent QCs, with the local linear regression of QC intensities selected. For the lipidomics analysis, peak picking was performed using Lipid-View software (AB Sciex). Owing to their complexity, the lipid compounds were detected by extracting the ion chromatograms to avoid the \u201cblack box\u201d associated with automatically pretreated data.
