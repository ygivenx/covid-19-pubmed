Accordingly, extensive studies on the pharmacological activities of the cinnamon bark have been conducted, indicating that cinnamon bark is involved in a vast range of pathological and physiological events. For instance, essential oil and water-based extracts from cinnamon have been shown to be effective against pathogenic microbes, viruses, and various types of tumor cell lines [1-4]. Furthermore, it has been also reported that cinnamon bark reduces the level of serum glucose through the enhancement of insulin-regulated glucose utilization in vivo[5,6].",

Since proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha(TNF-\u03b1), interleukin(IL)-1 and IL-6, lipid mediators, proteases, and oxidants produced during the typical response can cause damage to normal tissues regardless of how and where the inflammatory response is triggered, the substances involved in the inflammatory response need to be tightly regulated. If the scavenging reaction is delayed, the inflammatory response may evolve into a variety of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and neurodegenerative diseases. A vast number of molecular studies have identified several target molecules involved in inflammatory changes, and most anti-inflammatory drugs currently used suppress the biosynthesis of the inflammatory mediators mentioned earlier [8].",

However, since cinnamon bark has been typically used as in the form of a water extract, where the volatile ingredients are seldom found, it is likely that the established pharmacological activities of cinnamon bark depend on a mixture comprised of a variety of water-soluble components, thereby ensuring its safety as a traditional remedy. Recently, it has been found that cinnamon bark water extract (CWE) elevates glucose uptake through the promotion of insulin sensitivity and inhibits angiogenesis through blocking vascular endothelial growth factor 2 signaling [12,13]. These results indicate that the observed pharmacological activities may have originated from polyphenolic compounds in CWE.",

For size fractionation, 1.28 g of CWE was dissolved in 30 ml of distilled water and fractions were collected using 3 kDa and 10kDa Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter device (Millipore, Ireland). The yields of a low molecular weight (MW) fraction (below 3 kDa), a middle MW fraction (between 3 kDa and 10 kDa), and a high MW fraction (over 10 kDa) were 60%, 15% and 25% of CWE, respectively.

These cytokines provide protective effects for the body by inducing blood clotting, leukocyte recruitment and activation of adaptive immunity, but a large quantity of such cytokines in serum results in provoking disseminated intravascular coagulation, multiple organ failure or septic shock [15]. First, we tested whether CWE treatment affects systemic inflammatory response to LPS stimulation. To this end, CWE was orally administrated to mice for 6 days before intraperitoneal injection of LPS and the release of serum TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 was measured by ELISA. Based on our previous study, doses of 20, 100, and 500 mg/kg were chosen for oral administration [16]. Dexamethasone was used as a reference drug to compare the suppressive activity of CWE in the presence of LPS. Serum levels of TNF-\u03b1 were significantly reduced with the 20 and 100 mg/kg doses, while a higher dose (500 mg/kg) showed a lesser reduction than the lower dose points and was not statistical significant (Figure 1). This pattern was observed in our previous work in which a dose-dependent reduction in serum IFN-\u03b3 occurred only between 20\u2013200 mg/kg of CWE [16]. In the case of IL-6, a dose-dependent decrease occurred in the 20 and 100 mg/kg dosage groups although the latter group reached statistical significance. The 500 mg/kg group showed a higher level of IL-6 than the control group. It seems that unidentified compounds beyond a critical level may interfere with the anti-inflammatory components of CWE.",

We used peritoneal macrophages isolated from thioglycollate-injected mice to determine the range of CWE concentration representing no cytotoxic activity using the MTT method. Concentrations of CWE up to 400 \u03bcg/ml was not cytotoxic to peritoneal macrophages treated with or without LPS (Figure 2). Many herbal water extracts contain polysaccharides, which induce the secretion of TNF-\u03b1 in non-stimulated macrophages in vitro[17]. We found that treatment with CWE alone ranging from 10 to 100 \u03bcg/ml stimulated the release of TNF-\u03b1 into media in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 3A). Such phenomenon must be due to the presence of water soluble polysaccharides in CWE. Subsequently, we examined the effects of CWE on LPS-stimulated TNF-\u03b1 secretion. There was no apparent decrease in TNF-\u03b1 secretion by CWE (Figure 3A). However, TNF-\u03b1 mRNA expression at 4 h after LPS challenge was decreased in cells treated with 50 and 100 \u03bcg/ml of CWE (Figure 3B). Despite its inhibition of LPS-induced TNF-\u03b1 transcription, the unabated TNF-\u03b1 levels in supernatant must have been caused by prior exposure of cells to CWE.",

Upon inflammatory stimulation, I\u03baB\u03b1 is subjected to phosphorylation mediated by an upstream kinase, I\u03baB\u03b1 kinase (IKK), and is subsequently released from NF-\u03baB, followed by phosphorylation-induced proteosomal degradation[18]. We tested the effect of CWE on I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation 15 min after LPS stimulation. A time course study of I\u03baB\u03b1 activity in LPS-stimulated macrophages shows that phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1 reaches its peak at 5 min after LPS stimulation and then disappears at 15 min while a complete degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 occurs within 15 min [19]. As expected, an almost complete loss of phospho- I\u03baB\u03b1 as well as I\u03baB\u03b1 was identified in macrophages treated with LPS alone (Figure 4). CWE at doses of 50 and 100 \u03bcg/ml inhibited I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation, although phospho-I\u03baB\u03b1 was still detected. Phosphorylation of IKK was not affected. These results strongly indicate that the inhibitory effect of CWE on NF-\u03baB signaling may occur downstream of the phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1.",

We tested whether CWE can inhibit the activation of JNK, p38, and ERK1/2 15 min after LPS stimulation. JNK phosphorylation was reduced at all concentrations tested and phosphorylation of p38 and ERK 1/2 was inhibited at 100 \u03bcg/ml of CWE, implying that different constituents of CWE may act on these pathways (Figure 4).

Thus we separated CWE into a low MW fraction (below 3 kDa), a middle MW fraction (between 3 kDa and 10 kDa), and a high MW fraction (over 10 kDa). Since the insulin-like and antioxidant activities of CWE originate from polyphenolic compounds, we wanted to determine the polyphenol content in these fractions [12]. As shown in Table 1, the highest concentration of total polyphenols was observed in the high MW fraction, being more than ten-fold than that of the low or middle MW fraction. Next, based on the fraction yield ratio relative to the total CWE, 120 \u03bcg/ml, 30 \u03bcg/ml and 50 \u03bcg/ml of the low, middle and high MW fractions were added to macrophages and their effects on signaling molecules were examined. Suppression of the degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 and phosphorylation of JNK, p38 and ERK 1/2 was detected only in cells treated with the high MW fraction (Figure 5).

Toll-like receptors (TLRs), complement receptor 3 and scavenger receptors are affiliated members of the PRR family. Among them, LPS uses TLR-mediated signaling pathways such as NF-\u03baB and MAP kinases to stimulate TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in macrophages. Oral administration of CWE decreased serum levels of LPS-induced TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, but such anti-inflammatory activity was attenuated in the high dose group.

Since CWE is rich in polyphenols such as flavonoids and tannins, the anti-inflammatory effect of CWE may originate partly from polyphenolic compounds. Although the high MW fraction accounts for only 25% of the yield of CWE, its polyphenol content is four times more than that of CWE. The high MW fraction may contain polyphenols conjugated with polysaccharides or tannins. Procyanidins, known as condensed tannins, consist of oligomer or polymers of (epi)catechin. A higher degree of polymerized procyanidins exhibited stronger inhibition of macrophage activity [22]. Therefore, it is conceivable that the polyphenol-rich high MW fraction of CWE may contain the anti-inflammatory compounds that play a major role in suppressing LPS-induced NF\u03baB and MAP kinase signaling pathways.
