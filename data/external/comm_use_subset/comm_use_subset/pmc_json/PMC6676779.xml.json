As a WHO collaborating center, CDC provides technical assistance for influenza testing in a network of global laboratories, known as National Influenza Centers (NICs), which have functional links to their assigned WHO reference laboratory and access to quality assured reagents from the CDC Influenza Division through the International Reagent Resource (IRR) (https://www.internationalreagentresource.org). The NICs often have standardised, state-of-the-art equipment, in addition to well-trained molecular biologists. Specimens for routine testing at NICs are received from influenza surveillance sites that include regional hospitals and clinics using the severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) or influenza-like illness case definitions. Frequently, SARI and influenza-like illness sentinel systems are models of successful surveillance in resource-limited countries where epidemiologic data are linked to specimen collection and laboratory testing.10 An opportunity exists to expand the existing surveillance systems at NICs in GHSA countries by expanding testing capacity for other priority agents.",

In addition, a reliable method for procurement and distribution of available reagents is necessary to order and receive laboratory materials, particularly when many of the reagents are temperature sensitive. Utilising GHSA funds, the online reagent portal, the IRR, was expanded to include 14 new custom products including the FTD33 kit, the CDC-developed respiratory virus rRT-PCR assay kits and controls, as well as ancillary commercial products such as rRT-PCR enzyme kits and specimen extraction kits required to run the CDC respiratory virus rRT-PCR assays. The IRR is a programme established by CDC to provide registered users with various reagents and information for the study and detection of influenza virus. It was chosen as the delivery mechanism for these reagents, because the selected laboratories for GHSA were already using or in the process of being approved to use the IRR for the purpose of WHO influenza surveillance, eliminating the need to establish a new or duplicative reagent distribution plan.",
