Nevertheless, diseases produced by a wide range of microorganisms, from viruses to metazoan parasites, can result in large economical losses. Among clam diseases, the majority of pathologies are associated with the Vibrio and Perkinsus genera [1]\u2013[3]. Although molluscs lack a specific immune system, the innate response involving circulating hemocytes and a large variety of molecular effectors seems to be an efficient defense method to respond to external aggressions by detecting the molecular signatures of infection [4]\u2013[8]; however, not many immune pathways have been identified in these animals.",

Recently, the expression of 13 immune-related genes of Ruditapes philippinarum and Ruditapes decussatus were characterized in response to a Vibrio alginolyticus challenge [15]. Also, a recent 454 pyrosequencing study was carried out by Milan et al.\n[16], who sequenced two normalized cDNA libraries representing a mixture of adult tissues and larvae from R. philippinarum. Even more recently Ghiselli et al. [17], have de novo assembled the R. philippinarum gonad transcriptome with the Illumina technology. Moreover, a few transcripts encoded by genes putatively involved in the clam immune response against Perkinsus olseni have been reported by cDNA library sequencing [18]. Currently (19/12/2011), there are 5,662 ESTs belonging to R. philippinarum in the GenBank database.",

The use of 454-pyrosequencing is a fast and efficient approach for gene discovery and enrichment of transcriptomes in non-model organisms [20].

A total of 842,917 quality reads were assembled into 51,265 contigs, corresponding to 29.9 megabases (Mb). The length of the contigs varied from 40 to 5565 bp, with an average length of 582.4 bp and an average coverage of 5.7 reads. Singletons were discarded, resulting in 37,093 contigs formed by at least 2 ESTs, and 26,675 of these contigs were longer than 500 bp. Clustering the contigs resulted in 1,689 clusters with more than one contig. The distribution of contig length and the number of ESTs per contig, as well as the contig distribution by cluster are all shown in Figure 2.",

For Ruditapes philippinarum, these numbers are reduced to 5,662 ESTs, 612 proteins and 12 genes. This evidences the lack of information which prompted the recent efforts to increase the number of annotated sequences of bivalves in the databases.

The first bivalve, Meretrix lusoria, appeared at position 17. R. philippinarum was at position 25 with 124 occurrences. Notably, a high percentage of the sequences had homology with chordates, arthropods and gastropods (Figure 3B and C), and only 343 contigs matched with sequences from the Veneroida order (Figure 3D). These values can be explained by the higher representation of those groups in the databases as compared to bivalves and the quality of the annotation in the databases, which has been reported in another bivalve transcriptomic study [22].

It captures circulating iron to overcome an infection and also functions as a proinflammatory cytokine via the iron-independent nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) pathway [23]. Lysozyme is a key protein in the innate immune responses of invertebrates against Gram-negative bacterial infections and could also have antifungal properties. In addition, it provides nutrition through its digestive properties as it is a hydrolytic protein that can break the glycosidic union of the peptidoglycans of the bacteria cell wall [24]. The C1q domain containing proteins are a family of proteins that form part of the complement system. The C1q superfamily members have been found to be involved in pathogen recognition, inflammation, apoptosis, autoimmunity and cell differentiation. In fact, C1q can be produced in response to infection and it can promote cell survival through the NF-\u03baB pathway [25]. Galectin-3 is a central regulator of acute and chronic inflammatory responses through its effects on cell activation, cell migration, and the regulation of apoptosis in immune cells [26]. The hemagglutinin/amebocyte aggregation factor is a single chain polypeptide involved in blood coagulation and adhesion processes such as self-nonself recognition, agglutination and aggregation processes. The hemagglutinin/amebocyte aggregation factor and lectins play important roles in defense, specifically in the recognition and destruction of invading microorganisms [27].",

In other animals, angiopoietin-like proteins (ANGPTL) potently regulate angiogenesis, but a subset also function in energy metabolism. Specifically, ANGPTL2, the most represented ANGPTL, promotes vascular inflammation rather than angiogenesis in skin and adipose tissues. Inflammation occurs via the a5b1 integrin/Rac1/NF-\u03baB pathway, which is evidenced by an increase in leukocyte infiltration, blood vessel permeability and the expression of inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-6 and interleukin-1b) [28]. Apolipoprotein D (apoD) has been associated with inflammation. Pathological and stressful situations involving inflammation or growth arrest have the capacity to increase its expression. This effect seems to be triggered by LPS, interleukin-1, interleukin-6 and glucocorticoids and is likely mediated by the NF-\u03baB pathway, as there are several conserved NF-\u03baB binding sites in the apoD promoter (APRE-3 and AP-1 binding sites are also present). The highest affinity ligand for apoD is arachidonic acid, which apoD traps when it is released from the cellular membrane after inflammatory stimuli and, thus, prevents its subsequent conversion in pro-inflammatory eicosanoids. Within the cell, apoD could modulate signal transduction pathways and nuclear processes such as transcription activation, cell cycling and apoptosis. In summary, apoD induction is specific to ongoing cellular stress and could be part of the protective components of mild inflammation [29]\u2013[31]. Finally, the short form of the integral membrane protein 2B (ITM2Bs) can induce apoptosis via a caspase-dependent mitochondrial pathway [32].",

The remaining non-selected contigs were revised using the GO terms at level 2, 3 and 4 assigned to each sequence after the annotation step that had a direct relationship with immunity.
