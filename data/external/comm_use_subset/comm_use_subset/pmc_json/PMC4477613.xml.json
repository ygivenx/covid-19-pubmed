GSDMA is frequently silenced in gastric cancer cell lines [5] and has been reported to induce apoptosis when overexpressed in gastric cancer cells [6]. GSDMA has also been linked with airway hyperresponsiveness; polymorphisms in GSDMA are associated with asthma susceptibility, and risk alleles on asthma-associated locus are linked with increased GSDMA gene expression [2, 7, 8]. The expression of GSDMA in the epidermis and gastric epithelium is limited to the suprabasal layer; however, GSDMA expression was also found in both basal and differentiating cells of the airway and forestomach epithelium [2, 9]. Interestingly, an expansion of GSDMA-expressing cells was found in the epidermis overlying the tumor, suggesting that GSDMA may mediate certain stress responses [9].",

Among three GSDMA orthologs (Gsdma1-3) in mice, Gsdma1 and Gsdma3 are expressed in the differentiating keratinocytes of the epidermis and hair follicles [10]. Only mice bearing mutations in Gsdma3 were found to display autosomal dominant phenotypes, including epidermal hyperplasia, abnormal hair follicle differentiation, and progressive hair loss [11]. The underlying mechanism of these defects remains unexplained, as studies using different mutant mouse strains lead to different conclusions. Roles for Gsdma3 in epidermal proliferation and differentiation [9, 12\u201315], apoptosis and necrosis [16, 17], and inflammation-mediated hair follicle destruction [18, 19] have been proposed.",

Three spontaneous mutations and six ENU-induced mutations have been characterized in Gsdma3 gene (Fig. 1a). Interestingly, all the dominant mutation sites were located in the C-terminal portion of Gsdma3, indicating a critical role of this segment. Whether the dominant phenotypes of these Gsdma3 mutants are due to haploinsufficiency or gain-of-function mutations has not been examined. The haploinsufficiency theory proposes that the mutant protein may be rapidly degraded by missense-mediated instability, whereas the gain-of-function theory proposes that these dominant mutations may generate a constitutively activated protein.",

            "text": "Mitochondrial membrane permeabilization is a common step in mitochondria-mediated cell death. One type is initiated at the mitochondrial outer membrane by oligomerization of the pore-forming Bak and Bax, which leads to the release of the cytochrome c and AIF from the mitochondrial intermembrane space into the cytosol toinduce caspase-dependent and -independent apoptosis. The other type is initiated at the mitochondrial inner membrane by opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) pore, which leads to mitochondrial swelling and cell death through apoptosis or necrosis depending on the extent of the MPT. The putative MPT pore complex contains the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), the adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT), and cyclophilin D (CypD) [20]. MTP pore opens in response to increased Ca2+ concentrations in the mitochondrial matrix. Moreover, oxidative stress, mitochondrial depolarization, and depletion of adenine nucleotide may sensitize the MPT pore to Ca2+ concentrations [21].",

HaCaT cells transfected with expression vectors for wild-type and mutant Gsdma3 were first live-cell stained with Annexin V-Cy3 plus 7-AAD, and then immunostained for the tagged protein (Fig. 2a). We found that the cells expressing wild-type Gsdma3 (Gsdma3wt), N-terminal portion of Gsdma3 (N-Gsdma3) or Gsdma3Rim3 displayed slightly higher levels of early apoptosis staining (Annexin V+) than that of the cells expressing the C-terminal portion of Gsdma3 (C-Gsdma3) and C-terminal portion of Gsdma3Rim3 (C-Gsdma3Rim3), but it is not statistically significant (P = 0.47). The expression of C-Gsdma3 and C-Gsdma3Rim3 induced very little late apoptosis (Annexin V+ 7AAD+), and Gsdma3-expressing cells (16.4 \u00b1 6.1 %), N-Gsdma3-expressing cells (29.6 \u00b1 7.2 %), and Gsdma3Rim3-expressing cells (60.5 \u00b1 9.9 %) displayed higher level of late apoptosis staining than C-Gsdma3-expressing cells (P < 0.005) (Fig. 2b). The TUNEL assays were also performed in transfected HaCaT cells to detect the late apoptosis (Fig. 2c). Quantification of the TUNEL staining results revealed that Gsdma3-, N-Gsdma3- and Gsdma3Rim3-expressing cells displayed a higher level of TUNEL+ staining than that of C-Gsdma3-expressing (P < 0.5) (Fig. 2d). Interestingly, we found that Gsdma3Rim3-expressing cells had a higher late apoptosis staining than Gsdma3-expressing cells (Fig. 2b, d).",

The pIRES-hrGFP-1a vector was used to express flag-tagged Gsdma3 and variants together with internal ribosome entry site-driven GFP. Twenty thousand GFP+ cells for each transfection were collected for flow cytometry analysis, and we found that N-Gsdma3-expressing cells displayed a significant increase in the fractions of cell death (7AAD+ staining) and \u25b3\u03a8M depolarization than Gsdma3-expressing cells or vector-transfected cells. In contrast, the fractions of cell death and cells with \u25b3\u03a8M depolarization in C-Gsdma3-expressing cells were comparable to vector-transfected cells. As the GFP signal in cells transfected with flag tagged-Gsdma3Rim3 was below the detection limit of flow cytometry, we transfected HEK293T cells with mixtures of the flag tagged-Gsdma3Rim3 and the V5 tagged-Gsdma3wt plasmids (1:2 ratio). Interestingly, coexpression of Gsdma3Rim3 and Gsdma3wt resulted in greater fractions of cell death and \u25b3\u03a8M depolarization than did expression of Gsdma3wt alone. Collectively, these results indicate that C-Gsdma3 and C-Gsdma3Rim3 do not cause cell death, and that N-terminal domain of Gsdma3 harbors the cell death-inducing ability and the Rim3-type (A348T) mutation in the C-terminal domain may play a regulatory role.",

Importantly, the Rim3-type mutation rendered C-Gsdma3 (C-Gsdma3Rim3) unable to associate with N-Gsdma3 (Fig. 3d). Analysis of HEK293T cells co-expressing myc-His tagged-N-Gsdma3 with untagged C-Gsdma3 or C-Gsdma3Rim3 confirmed that the expression of C-Gsdma3, but not C-Gsdma3Rim3, increased the N-Gsdma3 protein expression (Additional file 1: Figure S1E).

Immunostaining results from transfected HaCaT cells revealed that both Gsdma3 and C-Gsdma3 displayed diffuse cytosolic staining, while N-Gsdma3 mainly displayed a perinuclear punctate staining (Fig. 4a). Double-immunostaning of HaCaT cells transfected with Gsdma3, N-Gsdma3, Gsdma3Rim3, and Gsdma3I359N expression plasmids (Fig. 1b) with tag-specific antibody and markers of individual organelles (ER, mitochondria, Golgi, peroxisomes, and lysosomes) showed that N-Gsdma3 as well as Gsdma3Rim3, and Gsdma3I359N partially colocalized with the mitochondrial marker Tom20 (Fig. 4b, d). Interestingly, N-Gsdma3, Gsdma3Rim3, and Gsdma3I359N often colocalized with fragmented mitochondria. Gsdma3Rim3 partially colocalized with Tom20, albeit less than N-Gsdma3 did. Remarkably, co-expressing C-Gsdma3 relocated N-Gsdma3 to the cytosol (Fig. 4c). Using immunostaining, we confirmed that N-Gsdma3 also partially colocalized with mitochondria in HEK293T and A549 lung epithelial cells (Additional file 2: Figure S2), suggesting that mitochondrial targeting of N-Gsdma3 is not a cell type-specific mechanism. To confirm mitochondrial targeting of N-Gsdma3, we performed mitochondria/cytosol fractionations of transfected HEK293T cells and immunoblotting analyses (Fig. 4e). Quantitative analysis showed that N-Gsdma3, but not C-Gsdma3, was enriched in the mitochondrial fraction (Fig. 4f). Collectively, our data suggest that the N-terminal domain of Gsdma3 targets mitochondria, while the C-terminal domain of Gsdma3 masks its mitochondrial targeting.",

We found that the expression levels of the Gsdma3 mutants were generally lower than those of wild-type Gsdma3 and that increasing C-Gsdma3 expression enhanced the protein levels of all Gsdma3 mutants tested, possibly by alleviating the toxicity of the mutant proteins (Fig. 5a). Notably, quantitative results showed that a greater amount of the C-Gsdma3 plasmid was needed to restore the maximum protein expression of Gsdma3Rim3 and Gsdma3M1Btlr mutants (Fig. 5b). We further examined the effect of C-Gsdma3 expression on the cytotoxicity induced by N-Gsdma3 and Gsdma3Rim3 through flow cytometry analysis (Fig 5c, d). We found that expressing C-Gsdma3 alleviated cell death (7AAD+) and \u25b3\u03a8M depolarization (low DiIC1[5]) induced by N-Gsdma3 and Gsdma3Rim3 plus Gsdma3wt.

Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation further confirmed the association of Hsp90 with N-Gsdma3 (Fig. 6b).

As a positive control for Hsp90 inhibition, we found that the protein level of AKT, a well-known Hsp90 client, was decreased in a radicicol concentration-dependent manner in HEK293T cells (Fig. 6j). Hsp90 has been shown to deliver mitochondrial preproteins to the mitochondria through the interaction with Tom70 [26]. Indeed, we found that Tom70 was present in the N-Gsdma3 immunoprecipitation complex (Fig. 6k). We performed the proteinase K protection assay in the fractionated mitochondria isolated from N-Gsdma3-transfected HEK293T cells treated with vehicle or radicicol (Fig. 6l). Quantitative results revealed that the mitochondrial import of N-Gsdma3 was prevented by radicicol (Fig. 6m).

Indeed, we observed elevated level of cytochrome c release into the cytosol in Gsdma3-, N-Gsdma3-, and Rim3-trasnfected HEK293T cells (Fig. 7e). We therefore investigated whether caspase-dependent apoptosis or other cell death mechanism is involved in the cell death induced by Gsdma3 mutants (Fig. 7f). Using pharmacological inhibitors for key mediators in apoptosis and necroptosis pathways [31], we first found that the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk did not block the cell death induced by N-Gsdma3. In addition, we found no evidence of inhibiting cell death when treating N-Gsdma3-expressing cells with inhibitors for RIPK1 (Necrostain-1), necrosis (Necrox-5), PARP (ABT-888), acid sphingomyelinase (desipramine), pan-calpain and cathepsins proteases (E64D), and adenine nucleotide translocase (bongkrekic acid) (Fig. 7f). Interestingly, treating N-Gsdma3- and Gsdma3Rim3-expressing cells with a cyclophilin D inhibitor, cyclosporin A (CsA), reduced fractions of cell death (Fig. 7g). The suppressive effect of CsA on Gsdma3Rim3-expressing cells was not as great as that observed in N-Gsdma3-expressing cells, suggesting that Gsdma3Rim3 may induce unregulated MPT [27, 32].

Mutations in the C-Gsdma3 disrupt the association between its N- and C-terminal domains. The unmasked N-Gsdma3 associates with Hsp90 and is delivered to mitochondria via Tom70, where it induces mitochondrial ROS production and cell death. Co-expressing C-Gsdma3 with the Gsdma3 mutants abrogated their cytotoxicity. Furthermore, pharmacological interventions of mitochondrial translocation, ROS production, and MPT pore opening alleviate the cell death induced by Gsdma3 mutants. Our data suggest a novel function of Gsdma3 in modulating mitochondrial oxidative stress, which potentially involves in cellular differentiation and cell death.",

However, our further analyses suggest that these dominant mutations are gain-of-function mutations. The dominant mutations in Gsdma3 mutants may expose their N-Gsdma3 and then enhance the exposure of N-Gsdma3 of wild-type Gsdma3, a dominant-active effect. Importantly, our findings readily explain why the Dfl- and M1Btlr-type mutations of Gsdma3, which generate C-terminal truncation mutants, induce dominant phenotypes similar to these missense mutations in animals [9, 18]. Intriguingly, we noted that different amounts of C-Gsdma3 were required to alleviate the cytotoxicity of Gsdma3 mutants. As suggested by Takana et al [15], different locations of the mutation sites in Gsdma3 may generate differential impact on the active conformation of Gsdma3, accounting for the slightly different onset of phenotypic defect.",

Mitochondrial fission is known to segregate damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria for degradation [33], consistent with our finding that N-Gsdma3 induced larger fractions of cells with \u25b3\u03a8M depolarization. Because Gsdma3Rim3-expressing cells displayed more cell death than N-Gsdma3-expressing cells, the reduced colocalization of Gsdma3Rim3 mutant protein with mitochondria may be due to the random distribution of the mutant protein prior to cell death, a secondary effect resulting from stronger toxicity of Gsdma3Rim3. We noted that Gsdma3 does not contain an apparent N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence that could be recognized by Tom20 for mitochondrial import. Instead, our data suggest that N-Gsdma3 is delivered to the mitochondria by the Hsp90/Hsp70/Hop complex via the mitochondrial importer Tom70, which recognizes the internal targeting sequences for mitochondrial import [34]. Hsp90/Hsp70 has been shown to deliver a subset of mitochondrial preproteins to Tom70 [26], and the formation of preprotein import intermediate after docking with Tom70 can be prevented by the Hsp90 inhibitor [35], consistent with the results of our proteinase K protection assay. Pharmacological intervention of Hsp90 may also decrease Ripk1 protein level, which accounts for the inhibiting effect of radicicol on cell death induced by Gsdma3 mutants. However, inhibiting Ripk1 directly by necrostatin-1 did not rescue cell death induced by N-Gsdma3, indicating that mitochondrial targeting is crucial for Gsdma3 activation.",

Thus, increased mitochondrial ROS production likely reflects impaired oxidative phosphorylation and is accompanied by \u25b3\u03a8M depolarization [36]. Our finding that N-Gsdma3 associates with the mitochondrial chaperone Trap1 may explain the underlying mechanism of mitochondrial dysfunction caused by Gsdma3 mutants. Trap1 has been shown to associate with components of the electron transport chain [37\u201339] as well as with CypD [40], a crucial regulator of the MPT. Moreover, silencing Trap1 with siRNA increases ROS production, while Trap1 overexpression attenuates cell death induced by oxidative stress [28, 41]. Thus, we hypothesize that N-Gsdma3 alters Trap1 chaperone activity, which causes mitochondrial oxidative stress, \u25b3\u03a8M dissipation, and MPT pore opening, ultimately leading to mitochondrial failure and cell death. In the extreme situation, obliterating Trap1 activity by Gsdma3Rim3 might result in the formation of unregulated MPT pore by aggregated/misfolded proteins [27, 32], which cannot be reversed completely by the ROS scavenger NAC or the CypD inhibitor CsA.",

Interestingly, our data indicate that Gsdma3 mutant can also induce caspase-independent MPT-mediated cell death. Accumulating evidence has shown that the extent of MPT determines the fate of the stressed cells [42]. If MPT happens to a moderate degree, the cell may undergo apoptosis, whereas if MPT happens to a larger degree, the cell may undergo necrotic cell death due to bioenergetic crisis. It is likely that overexpression of Gsdma3 (a regulatable form) induces transient MPT pore opening, which causes the cytochrome c release and caspase activation, whereas overexpression of Gsdma3 mutant (a constitutively activated form) induces sustained MPT opening, which causes non-selective release of proapoptotic and pronecrotic factors as well as uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. Because the protein expression level in the physiological state can only partially be compared with that in a transient transfection cell culture system, the enormous cell death observed in vitro is less likely to occur in cells expressing Gsdma3 or its mutant in vivo.",

Basal keratinocytes leave the basement membrane and start to differentiate, during which they withdraw from the cell cycle and become dead corneocytes by a specialized cell death program referred to as cornification [43]. Mitochondrial ROS has been shown to play a role in epidermal differentiation [44] and cyctochrome c release during keratinocyte differentiation was suggested to activate gene expression [45]. Therefore, imbalance of the differentiation and cell death processes can compromise the skin barrier formation and cause skin disease. We surmise that cancer cells often reside in hypoxia and inflammatory microenvironment, which causes redox imbalance and possibly can induce the conformation alteration of GSDMA3. In contrast, GSDMA3 is kept in a closed conformation in normal epithelial cells, and it may sensitize epithelial cells in response to environmental factors, such as allergens, infectious agents, or physical stress. It will be interesting in future experiments to indentify the physiological signals for exposing the N-terminal domain of Gsdma3.",
