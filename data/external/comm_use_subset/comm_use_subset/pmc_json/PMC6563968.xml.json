The Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) in Qatar, in particular the Health protection & Communicable Disease Control (HP & CDC) section, has implemented a national surveillance program for influenza and other ILIs associated viruses to identify and monitor the circulating viruses in the country.

We conducted a descriptive statistical analysis to analyze the demographic and clinical characteristics of the study subjects; and to identify the frequency, patterns, and seasonality of all viruses. The rate of infection of each virus was calculated as the proportion of positive specimens for that particular virus out of the total tested samples per month or year. All samples (n = 43,597) were tested for influenza viruses, while 37,929 samples were subjected for the detection of influenza and other respiratory pathogens as described above. Accordingly, the rates of influenza infections were calculated out of 43,597, while infection rates of other respiratory pathogens were calculated out of 37,929. To determine the relation significance between categorical variables, Pearson chi-square or Fisher Exact test were used. Results were considered statistically significant at p-value < 0.05.",

On the other hand, winter is cooler with occasional rainfalls. The weather during spring and autumn is usually warm during the days and cooler at nights. Importantly, there are occasional drops in the temperature during cool months with heavy fog conditions. This could affect the respiratory mucosa and increase individuals\u2019 susceptibility to infections. Also, it is known that cold temperatures facilitate the survival and spread of viruses more easily [13]. Another feature of cold months is that schools are open at that time, which also contribute to infections spread. Accordingly, we investigated the patterns of seasonality of all the tested viruses to understand the temporal circulation of respiratory pathogens.",

Additionally, Qatar is a multinational country, where >85% of its population are expats arriving from several countries in MENA region and South East Asia. Furthermore, Qatar is located within the hot zone of MERS-virus circulation. MERS-CoV shedding was evidenced in 59% of dromedary camels at the central slaughterhouse in Qatar, in which five different MERS strains were co-circulating [14]. The high proportion of MERS shedding and the circulation of multiple variants emphasizes on the potential human health risk in a diverse and dynamic environment like Qatar.

These findings are consistent with similar epidemiological studies conducted on adults in other countries. HRVs were also the second leading cause of ILIs in a three-year Chinese study between 2005\u20132007, where the virus was detected in 6.5% of patients above 14 years of age (total number = 5808 cases). All other remaining viruses were detected with a frequency less than 5% [18]. However, higher percentages of HRVs and RSV were reported from studies where younger participants were included [3, 15]. Although it is known that parechovirus may contribute to ILIs, only limited reports investigated their epidemiological characteristics among ILI patients [21]. In the current study, parechovirus infections were the lowest amongst other viruses, with only 44 positive cases reported in all the six surveillance years. In fact, low rate of parechovirus infections is typically observed in adults compared to children, where these infections are more frequent [22]. Earlier seroprevalence studies showed that over 90% of children are exposed to parechovirus before the age of two years [23]. It is therefore possible that the low rate of parechovirus-associated ILIs in adults is attributed to the presence of sterilizing immunity that confers protection and limits the infection severity, and thus, decreases the number of hospital visits among adult patients.",

In contrast to many studies where HRVs seasonality was not clear [3, 8, 18], our data shows that infections with HRVs increase during fall between September and November, and in spring between March and May. Moreover, we found that RSV and HMPV overlapped the peak of influenza, as previously described [31]. No clear temporal patterns were observed with CoVs infections, as well as adenoviruses, HPIV, enteroviruses, and parechovirus, and this is probably due to their low infection rates. It is worth noting that the analyzed samples were collected from various primary, secondary, and tertiary healthcare facilities around Qatar, and \u200ehence, we believe that there is no impact of site selection on the prevalence of the analyzed pathogens. \u200e",

            "text": "Studying the prevalence and spread of infections within different age groups in Qatar, and the GCC countries in general, is extremely important, due to the uniqueness of this region\u2019s population. Qatar population is mainly composed of individuals between the age of 15 and 60 years, due to the importation of massive labor force from this age group. The current median age of Qatar residents is approximately 33.22 years [32], while the average age is about 41.7 years [33]. Importantly, many of expatriates work in groups at construction sites and live in labor accommodations, facilitating the continuous transmission of infections within this age group specifically. In our study, influenza A viruses were more detected among patients aged between 31 and 40 years, while younger adults (15\u201330 years) had higher rates of influenza B virus. On the other hand, individuals aged above 50 years had significantly lower infection rates of both influenza types. It is well recognized that elderly are more susceptible to serious complications of influenza, which could require medical intervention or even hospitalization. However, this age group was the least affected in this study. In fact, multiple other studies from India, Canada, Japan and UK showed similar results, in which young adults presented higher rates of pandemic H1N1 infections compared to older age groups [34\u201337]. Moreover, in a study from the US that estimated the relative risk (RR) for influenza hospitalizations (between 2009 and 2014) in different age groups indicated that individuals <50 years had the smallest RR, while adults aged between 18 and 49 had the highest RR [38]. One of the explanations is that young individuals have higher transmission rates compared to elderly [38]. In addition, age-stratified sero-epidemiological studies suggests that elderly are more likely to have a protective neutralizing response to the virus, which probably contributes the lower rates of infection observed in some regions [39].",

We found that males had significantly higher rates of HRVs and enteroviruses. On the hand, females showed strong correlation with high rates of influenza, RSV, HPIVs and HMPV infections. This supports previous reports highlighting the contribution of gender differences in influencing infection incidence and severity [41]. While the frequencies of non-MERS CoVs were almost similar among males and females, MERS CoV infection was significantly higher among male subjects (67%). This complies with the WHO report stating that 65% of MERS cases occurred among males [42]. This gender disparity can be attributed to the limited contact of females with camels. Although women might occasionally visit camel farms or consume camel products, but unlike men, they do not attend camels\u2019 races, nor visit slaughterhouses [43].
