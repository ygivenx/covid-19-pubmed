The results also provide significant new insights into the pathways by which the RNA replication complex assembles and how different 1a functions are coordinated, revealing e.g. that 1a-induced membrane invagination and 1a-induced viral RNA protection are closely linked, while 1a interaction with and stimulation of BMV 2aPol accumulation does not require, and is in fact inhibited by, membrane rearrangements.",

One indication that helix A is likely important is that its amino acid sequence is evolutionarily highly conserved among the equivalent 1a replication proteins of other bromoviruses (Fig. 1A).",

Lysates of yeast cells expressing these fusion proteins were loaded under flotation gradients, which upon centrifugation were fractionated and analyzed by SDS PAGE and western blotting using anti-GFP antibodies. As a measure of membrane association, flotation efficiency was determined as the percentage of total GFP or 1a-GFP fusion protein in the gradient that was present in the top two fractions. In these assays, less than 3% of wild type cytosolic GFP floated to the top of the gradient with the membrane fraction. Fusing the 35 aa region to GFP greatly increased membrane association up to 45%, which was as efficient as membrane association directed by the full 105 aa E region fused to GFP. The smaller 18H-GFP fusion protein retained about 30% flotation efficiency (Fig. 1B). Thus, the 35 aa segment 388\u2013422 accounts for essentially all of 1a's membrane association mediated by domain E, and the 18 aa helix A region retains most of this function and is sufficient to direct membrane association of GFP.",

To test these predictions, we used NMR to resolve the structure of an 18 aa peptide with the core sequence (aa 392\u2013409) of helix A. NMR spectra of this peptide dissolved in water did not reveal a long term stable structure. However, upon including 100 mM SDS to provide lipid bilayer-mimicking micelles [25], the peptide showed NMR spectral changes consistent with a stable conformation (Fig. 3A). Based solely on 13C chemical shifts, NMR showed that aa 397\u2013406 in the peptide had a >80% probability to be in a helical structure (Fig. 3B). To elucidate this further, the three dimensional structure of the peptide was calculated based on NOE distance constraints arising from spatial contact of hydrogen atoms observed to be closer than \u223c5\u00d7. Additional dihedral angle constraints were derived from chemical shifts using the TALOS program [26]. The resulting structure (Fig. 3C) shows an \u03b1-helical conformation for aa 397\u2013406, indicating that an amphipathic helix formed upon binding to the lipid membrane-mimicking SDS micelle. The constraints and overall quality of the structure are shown in Table 1.",

We introduced L to A mutations in the 18H-GFP fusion protein expression plasmid and tested their effects on membrane flotation efficiency. As shown in Fig. 4, the wt18H-GFP again had 30\u201335% flotation efficiency, while single L to A mutations reduced this to \u223c7\u201315%. Of the three leucines, mutating the more N-proximal L396 and L400 more severely reduced membrane association than mutating L407, which paralleled the stronger micelle contact of the N-terminal half of the peptide (Fig. 3C and Table 2). These results might also explain in part the tolerance for an isoleucine at the 407-equivalent position in other bromovirus replicase proteins (Fig. 1A). A fusion protein with a combination of all three L to A mutations had near background level flotation, implying a complete loss of function of helix A in targeting cytosolic GFP to membranes. In contrast, K to E mutations reversing the charge of lysines 403 and 406 (the only basic residues in the 18 aa helix A core) showed K403E to only marginally decrease the flotation efficiency of 18H-GFP, while K406E had no significant effect (Fig. 4), consistent with the NMR observation that these amino acids have weak and no lipid contact, respectively (Fig. 3C). A double K to R mutation designed to retain the positive charge at these amino acid positions did not affect membrane association at all (Fig. 4), suggesting that K403 might contribute to membrane association via its positive charge, perhaps by neutralizing negatively charged lipid head groups. Overall, as mutations that change the leucine-rich non-polar face of the helix have more detrimental effects on membrane association than other amino acid substitutions, the results were consistent with the NMR-based structure of helix A and show that amphipathic helix A has a key role in membrane targeting.",

By membrane flotation gradient analyses, the flotation efficiency of wt 1a was \u223c 96% (Fig. 5A), confirming 1a's previously established high affinity for membranes [24]. Deleting the 35 aa or 18 aa helices reduced 1a-membrane association by over two-fold (Fig. 5A). The three L to A mutations, either as single mutations or as a triple combination, similarly reduced the flotation efficiency of full length 1a to \u223c45%. Single alanine insertions immediately downstream from L396 and L400 reduced flotation efficiency to levels similar to full helix A deletions (Fig. 5A), confirming the importance of correct spacing to maintain the amphipathic characteristics of helix A. The importance of the charged lysines at positions 403 and 406 at the hydrophilic face of helix A was assessed using alanine or arginine substitutions. Single position substitution mutants and double mutants K403/406A and K403/406R maintained full flotation efficiency (Fig. 5A, single mutations not shown). 1a mutants K403E, K406E, and double mutant K403/406E retained intermediate flotation efficiencies showing that although the positive charge at these positions is not required, reversing it to a negative charge destabilizes membrane association (Fig. 5A). The K403/406E single and double mutations showed a somewhat greater inhibition of membrane association in the context of full length 1a (\u223c63% for the double mutant in Fig. 5) than in the context of the 18 aa helix fused to GFP (\u223c77%, Fig. 4), suggesting the possibility that residues outside of the 18 aa helix core might cooperatively influence membrane association.",

To specify which of the two amino acid changes contributed to this phenotype, single mutants 1a K403R and 1a K406R were generated and expressed in yeast cells. In keeping with the DSA/membrane interaction of K403 but not K406 (Fig. 3C), Fig. 6B shows that 1a K403R maintained this mutant phenotype while 1aK406R induced spherules with the frequency and size of wt 1a. Moreover, 1a K403R induced high frequency, smaller spherules even in the presence of high levels of GAL1-promoter-driven 2aPol expression (Fig. 6B), conditions under which wt 1a preferentially induces ER membrane layers rather than spherules (Fig. 6A).

To evaluate the possible role of other helix A amino acids in Class I or Class II phenotypes, we first made alanine substitutions at the other residues besides L396/400/407 in the major membrane interacting face of helix A, i.e., F394, T397, Y401, Y404 and T408 (Fig. 3C, bottom view; see also Fig. 2). Strikingly, EM analysis showed that 1a T397A, 1a Y401A and 1a Y404A all were Class II mutants, inducing a plethora of small spherules like 1a K403R (Fig. 7A). Flotation analyses showed that all four of these Class II mutants also maintained wt 1a levels of membrane association (Fig. 7B). The F394A substitution, positioned on the same side of helix A as the above Class II mutants but at the N-terminal end of helix A (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3C), had a partial Class II phenotype of producing spherules at normal frequency but slightly smaller diameter than wt 1a. An alanine substitution at K403 resulted in a similar phenotype. By contrast, spherules of wt frequency and size were produced by 1a T408A, at the C-terminal end of helix A, by 1a bearing alanine substitutions at residues on the upper face of helix A (Fig. 3C), i.e., V392, L398, N399, and Q402. and by 1a A395S (results not shown).",

In conjunction with such recruitment in this and previous studies [19], co-expressing wt 1a increased 2aPol accumulation by approximately two-fold (Fig. 8A). Accordingly, we measured 2aPol accumulation in the presence of the various 1a mutants to determine to what extent this 1a function depended on sequences in helix A. All mutant 1a proteins accumulated to levels similar to wt 1a, but Class I and Class II mutants showed directly opposite effects on 2aPol accumulation (Fig. 8B and 8C). Class I 1a mutants that lack the ability to induce ER invaginations not only retained the ability to stimulate 2aPol accumulation, but did so to nearly double the level of wt 1a (Fig. 8B). In contrast, Class II 1a mutants that form more numerous, smaller spherules, lost the ability to stimulate 2aPol levels over those in cells expressing 2aPol alone (Fig. 8C).

To define the state of RNA3 in the presence of the Class I and Class II 1a mutants, we assayed RNA3's membrane flotation efficiency, sedimentation, and nuclease sensitivity when co-expressed with these mutants (Fig. 9B and 9C). Without wt 1a, RNA3 remained at the bottom of flotation gradients, indicative of a complete lack of membrane-association. In sedimentation assays, RNA3 from cells lacking 1a was mainly detected in the membrane-depleted supernatant and readily degraded with micrococcal nuclease (Fig. 9C). In the presence of wt 1a or its Class II mutants, at least 80% of RNA3 segregated with the membrane fraction in the top gradient fractions or the membrane-enriched pellet fraction in sedimentation assays, and became highly nuclease-resistant, while Class I mutants failed to induce RNA 3 membrane association or nuclease resistance (Fig 9B and 9C). Thus, the loss or enhancement by Class I or II 1a helix A mutants of wt 1a's ability to stimulate RNA3 accumulation in vivo was closely linked with RNA3's acquisition of a membrane-associated, nuclease-resistant state, and with the capacity of each 1a mutant's ability to induce membrane invaginations.",

These leucines show significant conservation among sequenced bromoviruses (Fig. 1A), and mutation of these leucines to alanines, in effect removing their side chains, greatly diminished helix A- and full-length 1a-mediated membrane association (Fig. 4 and Fig. 5). Insertions of alanines immediately adjacent to the leucines, which disrupts their correct spacing and the amphipathic characteristics of helix A, likewise reduces 1a membrane association efficiency to that of complete helix A deletion mutants (Fig. 5). When lysines at positions 403 and 406, which can potentially interact with the negatively charged polar head groups of the lipid bilayer, were mutated to glutamic acids to change positive charge to negative charge, membrane association was also affected, but to a lesser extent (Fig. 4 and Fig. 5).",

However, computer-assisted predictions [30] do not support the likelihood of phosphorylation at these residues, due to lack of flanking phosphorylation site consensus sequences. Indeed, neither mutations T397D, Y401E and Y404E (intended to mimic phosphorylation), nor mutations T397R, Y401R and Y404R (that added positive charge) affected spherule formation, although they did render 1a defective in RNA replication (data not shown).

Remarkably, Class I 1a mutations, which significantly inhibit 1a membrane affinity and abolish the capability to rearrange membranes, nearly doubled the ability of 1a to stimulate 2aPol accumulation (Fig. 8B). These 1a mutants decreased 1a membrane affinity to about 50% and, although interacting more efficiently with 2aPol, they did not recruit 2aPol to the typical perinuclear ER location. Instead, co-expressing these Class I 1a mutants with 2aPol induced both to concentrate into large cytoplasmic clusters (Fig. 8D). In sharp contrast, stimulation of 2aPol accumulation by 1a was completely abolished when co-expressed with the Class II 1a mutants that induced dramatically more abundant spherules than wt 1a (Fig. 7).",

Immunogold electron microscopy and stoichiometric calculations of the various viral components in wt BMV replication complexes indicate that each spherule replication complex contains \u223c200\u2013400 BMV 1a molecules [13]. Calculations of spherule surface area and the predicted size of the 1a protein, 1a's strong affinity for the cytoplasmic face of the ER membrane [24], 1a self-interaction [29], and other results all imply that 1a forms an inner shell inside the spherules, explaining the formation and maintenance of these high-energy membrane deformations [12],[13]. Similar conclusions, based on electron microscope tomography and multiple other approaches, recently emerged for the role of transmembrane viral replication protein A in spherule RNA replication complexes formed by flock house nodavirus on mitochondrial membranes [23]. The observation that the Class II cluster of helix A mutations alters the size of the induced membrane spherules (Table 3) suggests that this part of helix A affects 1a-membrane and/or 1a-1a self-interactions that determine the diameter of the inner protein shell. Such altered interactions, together with the \u223c3-fold reduced volume of Class II spherules, explain how Class II 1a mutants produce significantly more spherules than wt 1a (Table 3) from a similar or only slightly increased number of 1a proteins (Fig. 3C).",

Such Class I 1a mutants were over twice as effective as wt 1a at interacting with, stabilizing and recruiting 2aPol to membranes (Fig. 8 and Table 3). This implies that 1a-2aPol interactions occur most efficiently and perhaps exclusively prior to spherule formation (Fig. 12). Consistent with these findings, Class II mutants, which are hyper-active in spherule formation, were markedly defective in 2aPol stabilization (Fig. 8 and Table 3). These results suggest that 1a-2aPol interaction and 1a-induced membrane invagination are sequential and perhaps antagonistic functions. Spherule formation might interfere with 1a-2aPol interaction by sequestering 1a in the spherule interior, by inducing conformational changes in 1a, or both. In either case, such interference could help to explain how spherules regulate accumulation of 2aPol to catalytic amounts of only one 2aPol for every 20 1a molecules [13]. Since Class I mutants with reduced membrane association enhanced 1a-2aPol interaction and nascent 2aPol can be efficiently recruited by 1a from cytosolic, translating polysomes [31], 1a-2aPol interaction may preferentially occur prior to 1a-membrane association.",

This implies that RNA template recruitment is either closely linked to or subsequent to spherule formation ([21] and Fig. 12). The resulting ordered progression of 2aPol recruitment, replication complex assembly and RNA template recruitment seems tailored to satisfy the virus's crucial survival need to effectively use the limited number of viral genomic RNAs - potentially one - present during early phases of infection. It also is consistent with the dual function of the viral RNA genome to serve as a template for replication only after it has been translated and sufficient amounts of viral replication proteins have accumulated.",

In addition, the fact that RNA replication was abolished or severely inhibited by all Class II mutations (Fig. 10), which preserved membrane interaction, invagination and RNA recruitment, suggests that helix A may affect one or more additional 1a functions required for RNA synthesis, such as the enzymatic functions of the 1a RNA capping or NTPase/helicase domains (Fig. 1). Similar to the central role of helix A in 1a, amphipathic \u03b1-helices are also essential for the peripheral membrane association and function of some other positive-strand RNA virus replication factors, such as the Flaviviridae NS5A membrane anchor [34] Semliki Forest virus nsP1 RNA capping protein [4], and picornavirus 2C protein [6]. As with the possible role of helix A in modulating 1a enzymatic activities, the RNA capping activity of nsP1 is dependent on membrane association by its short amphipathic helix [35]. Moreover, like 1a, picornavirus 2C not only associates with membranes through an amphipathic helix, but induces membrane rearrangements, has NTPase activity and conserved helicase motifs required for RNA replication, and is implicated in amphipathic helix-modulated interactions with other viral RNA replication proteins [6]. Such emerging commonalities suggest that the membrane interaction and function of such amphipathic helices may embody common principles extending across important virus groups.",

The synthesis was carried out at a scale of 12.5 micromoles with a 3-fold excess of each amino acid. Coupling times for the first three and final 5 couplings were fixed at one hour each. The remaining 6 couplings were programmed as extended couplings. The cleaved and deprotected peptide was purified by HPLC using a C18 Vydac column (250\u00d710 mm).

Consistent with the effects of Class I and II mutant phenotypes on membrane interaction and 2aPol recruitment (see below), and with the ability of 1a to recruit nascent 2aPol from translating, cytoplasmic polysomes [19], 1a and 2aPol interact in the cytoplasm prior to membrane association. For Class II mutants, subsequent 1a\u2013membrane association and 1a-induced membrane rearrangement is correlated with inhibition of 1a-2aPol interaction. The effects of mutations in the C-proximal 1a NTPase/helicase domain imply that 1a-mediated recruitment of viral RNA templates to the membrane-associated, protected state required for replication occurs after 1a-induced membrane rearrangement [21], as shown. Red and green arrows show the opposite shifts in assembly equilibrium induced by Class I and Class II mutations. Class I 1a mutants have lost helix A\u2013mediated ER membrane association and all capability to invaginate or otherwise modify membranes, but retain efficient interaction with 2aPol. In contrast, Class II 1a mutants retain efficient ER membrane association and show greatly increased levels of membrane invagination and RNA template recruitment, but have decreased interaction with 2aPol.",
