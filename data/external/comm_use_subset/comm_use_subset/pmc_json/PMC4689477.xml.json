As of November 13, 2015, a total of 1618 cases had been reported by the World Health Organization, including 579 fatalities (http://www.who.int/csr/don/13-november-2015-mers-saudi-arabia/en/). The mortality rate of MERS-CoV is as high as 35%, far higher than that of the SARS coronavirus (8\u201310%) [1]. Although milder and asymptomatic presentation does occur, a portion of patients develop severe respiratory disease identified as viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) accompanied by leucopenia and lymphopenia, similar to patients infected with SARS-CoV. In addition, at least one-third of patients exhibit gastrointestinal symptoms and in some severe cases, renal failure develops concurrently with MERS-CoV infection [2, 3]. More recently, severe neurologic syndrome was also reported in critically cases [4]. Although the limited clinical data available indicate that systemic infection can occur, the pathological mechanism of multi-organ damage caused by MERS-CoV infection is not well understood.",

In humans, DPP4 is constitutively expressed in epithelial cells in the liver, intestine, prostate, kidneys and in activated leukocytes [7]. MERS-CoV may infect human tracheobronchial epithelium, primary renal epithelium, alveolar adenocarcinoma, liver cells (Huh-7) and bronchiolar epithelial cells [8]. Because they do not express human DPP4, mice, hamsters and ferrets cannot be infected with MERS-CoV [9\u201312]. However, rhesus macaques can be infected with MERS-CoV. Following infection, rhesus macaques develop transient clinical symptoms with histopathologically evident multifocal mild-to-moderate interstitial pneumonia on day 3 post-infection [13]. Common marmosets infected with high doses of MERS-CoV develop more severe disease than rhesus macaques, with sometimes fatal pneumonia [14]. In MERS-CoV-infected common marmosets, clinical disease was more severe and viral loads in the lungs were higher than in the rhesus macaque lungs. However, while viral RNA was detected in kidney samples from five out of seven common marmosets, no histological abnormalities were observed. Furthermore, the ethics, higher expense and sophisticated operation limited their application for the studies on the pathogenesis of the disease and efficient evaluation of vaccines or drugs to treat MERS-CoV infection.",

Although this model may be used efficiently for evaluating the efficacy of vaccines and drugs, it is still limited in its ability to recapitulate the pathogenesis of the disease for its transient and self-limited viral infection. To develop a more susceptible, stable and efficient model, Chien-Te K. Tseng\u2019s group successfully established a transgenic mice model stably expressing hDPP4 that exhibited progressive pneumonia and lethal outcome after MERS-CoV infection [16]. In the model, although no tissue damage was observed in the brain, viral replication was reported. More recently, another hDPP4 mouse model was developed by replacing 79 kb mouse DPP4 genomic DNA with that encoding 82 kb human genomic DPP4 using the VelociGene techonology. Although no mortality or clinical signs of disease was observed up to day 4, robust viral replication and pathology in the lungs were detected. No specific MERS-CoV RNA and information was detected in brain [17]. In this study, we generated a transgenic mouse model also that globally expresses codon-optimized-hDPP4. This MERS-CoV infected optimized-hDPP4 transgenic mice developed severe pneumonia with multi-organ injury including liver, kidney and brain damages.",

We have taken special precautions and followed standard guidelines outlined in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals to ensure that ample food and water as well as sanitary cage conditions with enrichment devices were present in order to maximize the animal\u2019s comfort. Humane endpoints were used during the survival experiments. After virus infection, mice were closely monitored by daily observation and weighing of trained animal caretaker, and the monitoring will raise to twice per day once mice lost more than 10% of their initial body weight, or exhibited lethargy, ruffled hair coat, or hunched posture. Animals were deemed gravely ill and were euthanized by overdose inhalation of carbon dioxide if they lost more than 25% of their weight, or lost ability to ambulate and access food or water. Sera were collected on day 5 and inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30 min before the levels of cytokines and chemokines were measured. To assess viral replication and histopathologic damage following MERS-CoV infection, mice were euthanized with overdose inhalational carbon dioxide, and tissues included lungs, kidneys, livers, spleens, intestines and brains were harvested on indicated time points.",

We developed transgenic mice in which hDPP4 expression was driven by the chicken \u03b2-actin promotor in the pCAGGS plasmid (Fig 1A). Expression of hDPP4 in vitro was achieved by transfection of the pCAGGS-hDPP4 plasmid into Cos-7 cells and detected by immunofluorescence analysis. The results showed that hDPP4 was expressed in Cos-7 cells and that it effectively bound MERS-CoV (Fig 1B\u20131E). After microinjection of linearized DNA, founder lines that transferred the hDPP4 gene to their progeny were established. The levels of transgenic DNA in the founder lines ranged from 2 to 6 copies per genome, as determined by qPCR (Fig 1F). In addition, the mRNA levels of hDPP4 in the trachea, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, intestine and brain in two of the founder lines were measured by qRT-PCR. The data showed that hDPP4 expression was higher in the trachea, lung, spleen, kidney and brain in both lines, and the expressions were relative higher in trachea and kidney in line 4 compared with that in line 2 (Fig 1G). In order to determine the effective infection of MERS-CoV in different lines of transgenic mice, 6 mice in each line were infected with MERS-CoV and the changes of body weight were monitored. The results showed that all mice in line 1, 2 and 3 survived with no significant changes in body weight but all mice in line 4 died by day 10 following MERS-CoV inoculation (Fig 1H). In order to confirm the virus replications in transgenic mice, three mice of each line were sacrificed on day 5 after MERS-CoV infection for the detection of viral titer and viral antigen expression in lungs. As expected, compared with high level of lung viral titers in line 4 mice, no viral titer were detected (Fig 1I) in lungs of line 1, 2 and 3 mice, which also confirmed by the negative results of viral antigen expression detected by immunohistochemistry in lung (data not shown).",

Strong viral antigen expression was evident not only in neuronal cell bodies, but also in dendrites, axons and some microglia in the cerebral cortex (Fig 4H) including the hippocampus (Fig 4I). No viral antigen expression was observed in the brains of mice in the sham-infected group (Fig 4G). Viral RNA copies in lung and brain were detectable on day 5 postinfection and increased to a higher level on day 9 (Fig 4J). Lower level of viral RNA copies can be also detected in kidney collected on day 9. In order to further confirm the effective replication of MERS-CoV, the dynamic changes of viral titer in organs were detected. The results showed that on day 3 after infection, only lower viral titer was detected in lung and not detectable in other organs. However, on day 5, viral titer was also detected in brain. On day 7 and day 9, increased viral titers were detected in both lung and brain, and lower level viral titer in kidney was detectable (Fig 4K). These results indicate that the transgenic mice had been successfully infected and that MERS-CoV exhibited cell and tissue tropism especially for pneumocytes and neurons. Furthermore, synapses may be one of the structures by which viruses diffuse through the brain after MERS-CoV infection.",

In our mouse model, an aberrant inflammatory response was confirmed by infiltration of neutrophils in the lung, liver and spleen (Fig 5A\u20135F) and macrophages in the lung, liver and kidney (Fig 5G\u20135L). In addition, deposition of hemosiderin in the spleen (Fig 3K and 3L) indicated an increase in activated macrophages, and a systemic inflammatory response after virus infection was demonstrated by a significant increase in cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3, IP-10, and IL-17 in the serum on day 5 after MERS-CoV infection (Fig 5M).",

A MERS-CoV-infection mouse model was generated by transducing mice with a recombinant non-replicating adenovirus expressing hDPP4; however, while the mice exhibit viral antigen expression and progress to interstitial pneumonia, there is no mortality after virus infection [15]. Although a transgenic mouse model expressing human DPP4 was also established, and its immune response was studied after infection with MERS-CoV [16], the transgenic mice in the study died on day 6 with only progressive pneumonia and mild perivascular cuffing in brain, and no neurological disorder or other multi-organ damage was observed. Different from the aforementioned transgenic mice, our hDPP4 transgenic mice experienced a longer incubation period post-infection and developed progressive pneumonia and neurological disorders accompanied by histological damage to the lungs, brain, spleen and liver, which more closely resembles the clinical cases.",

Although the expression level of optimized hDPP4 was not highest in the brains, the tissues had higher viral titers following MERS-CoV infection, revealing the tropism of MERS-CoV for both lungs and brains, tissues in which pneumocytes and neurons may be the main target cells (Fig 4).

For example, acute renal failure was described in a number of MERS cases [28\u201332]. In addition, renal epithelial cells may produce almost 1000-fold more infectious MERS-CoV progeny than bronchial epithelial cells [33]. More recently, severe neurologic syndrome including altered level of consciousness from confusion to coma, ataxia and focal motor deficit was also reported in three critically cases by Balkhy H et al [4]. According to the neurologic manifestations and distinct imaging patterns, an important question was raised on the pathogenic mechanisms that underlie the occurrence of neurologic injury in patients. It has been studied that corona virus such as SARS-CoV are generally known for causing respiratory illness, and the strong tropism of SARS-CoV to CNS and causing neuronal injury had also been demonstrated both in clinical and experimental studies [34\u201338], which suggested the possible relations of MERS-CoV infection with brain injury. As to the extensive expression of hDPP4 in the lung, kidney, placenta, liver, skeletal muscle, brain, endothelium, pancreasour and T cell in human, our globally expressed hDPP4 transgenic mouse manifested with multi-organ damage infected with MERS-CoV could be a suitable model for the pathogenic mechanisms study.",

In our transgenic mice, aberrant immune response such as elevated IP-10, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17, which are closely related to acute virally-mediated lung injury [39\u201342], was also a specific manifestation after MERS-CoV infection.
