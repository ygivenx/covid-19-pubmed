Clinical features range from asymptomatic infection, to an acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multi-organ failure (3). The majority of patients that have succumbed to MERS-CoV have had comorbidities (4, 5) and disease is thought to be more severe in immunocompromised patients. However, the actual mechanisms of disease remain to be elucidated. The virus has been shown to replicate in human primary epithelial and ex vivo human lung cultures, especially in non-ciliated bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar type II pneumocytes (6\u20138) and the receptor has been identified as dipeptidyl peptidase 4, which is expressed on these cell types (9).

Rhesus macaques develop a mild pneumonia upon intratracheal inoculation with MERS-CoV (12). In this model, virus replicates within the respiratory tract to modest levels, and is detectible in oral and nasal swabs. However, clinical disease is most prominent within the first few days after inoculation and animals show signs of disease resolution soon after. Disease in rhesus likely models the mild form of the human disease, where the infection is self-limiting and clinical signs and symptoms are mild (10, 14, 15). In an effort to examine whether the immune status of an individual influences the disease severity and pathogenicity and replication kinetics of the virus, we downregulated the immune system of rhesus macaques using immunosuppressive drugs. We found that MERS-CoV replicated to significantly higher titers and disseminated outside of the respiratory tract in immunosuppressed animals, yet pathology was markedly reduced in these animals, showing that disease has an immunopathogenic component.",

Immunosuppression (animals ISCoV1-3) was achieved by administration of cyclophosphamide (CyP) (Roxane Laboratories) (10 mg/kg dissolved in 30 mL of a meal supplement (Boost) and delivered via an orogastric tube under anesthesia every other day starting 16 days prior to virus inoculation and ending 2 days after inoculation), and dexamethasone (Dex, 2 mg/kg daily by subcutaneous injection beginning 16 days prior to virus inoculation and ending 5 days after inoculation). Mock immunosuppression (CoV1-2) was performed following the same schedule, but orogastric feeding did not contain CyP and injections consisted of sterile PBS. Immunosuppression was confirmed by monitoring white blood cell (WBC) populations using a HemaVet (Drew Scientific). For inoculation, 7 \u00d7 106 TCID50 of MERS-CoV was diluted in 7 mL of DMEM and delivered via intratracheal (4 mL) oral (1 mL) nasal (1 mL), and ocular (1 mL) routes as previously described (12).

Two animals were used for mock immunosuppression controls and received the identical inoculum. Throughout immunosuppression, we monitored WBC populations in the blood to determine the efficacy of the immunosuppression regimen. Total WBC counts were decreased by approximately twofold compared to the control animals in response to CyP and Dex administration at the time of MERS-CoV inoculation. This reduction was due to decreases in all measured cell types (lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils) (Figure 1). Following MERS-CoV inoculation, the absolute counts of these cell populations remained low in the immunosuppressed animals, suggesting their inability to respond to infection. Conversely, the two mock immunosuppressed animals had increased numbers of monocytes and eosinophils in response to infection. To quantify immunosuppression at the tissue level, the spleens and mediastinal lymph nodes of all animals were stained immunohistochemically with T cell and B cell markers (CD3 and CD20, respectively) post-mortem. The amount of staining was quantitatively assessed using imaging software. The quantity of CD3 staining was approximately 2-fold lower in the spleen and 2.7-fold in a mediastinal lymph node in the immunosuppressed animals. Likewise, CD20 was 2.4-fold lower in the spleen and 3-fold lower in the lymph nodes, showing a general reduction in lymphocytes in these tissues and confirming that the suppressive drug therapy was effective in reducing immune cell populations (Figures 2A,B). Immunosuppression also disrupted the normal architecture of these tissues.",

All animals were given the same inoculum (from the same stock of virus) via the same route and all were euthanized 6 days post-inoculation. When comparing the viral abundance in the lungs (all six lobes) between the controls from this study and the historic controls, there was no significant difference in the geometric means of viral RNA abundance between these two groups, although the historic controls had slightly more measurable viral RNA (Figure 3C). However, the immunosuppressed animals had significantly increased MERS-CoV replication (measured by RNA abundance) in the lungs (Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test, p \u2264 0.001). Similarly, there was significantly more virus detected in several respiratory, or respiratory tract-associated tissues, including the bronchi, trachea, tonsils, and mediastinal lymph nodes of immunosuppressed animals, compared to the controls (Figure 3D) (Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test, p \u2264 0.05). When assessing viral dissemination in tissues outside of the respiratory tract, immunosuppressed animals were positive for low levels of viral RNA in several tissues, including the liver and spleen, as well as several lymph nodes, whereas virus was undetectable outside of the respiratory tract in the control animals, with the exception of one inguinal lymph node sample (Table 1).",

The mechanisms by which the recently emerged MERS-CoV causes disease in humans, and what host factors are associated with either resistance or a poor outcome are not known (15).

These reports were from cases where diagnoses were primarily in patients already in hospitals, including a relatively large number of nosocomial infections affecting 23 patients in a hospital outbreak in Al-Hasa (24). Since these initial case reports, more than 2,000 additional cases of MERS-CoV infection have been confirmed (2).

            "text": "Risk factors that have been associated with disease (or infection) include weakened immune systems and chronic diseases, such as diabetes, cancer, and chronic lung disease, as well as co-infections (5, 20, 25). Although these comorbidities clearly affect the status of the immune response, acute immunosuppression using drugs, as we have done here, provides a more controlled deficit in immune responses, whereas immune dysregulation brought on by chronic disease, infection, and aging is a complex phenomenon that involves deficiencies in the immune response, chronic inflammatory responses, and other known and yet to be described complex changes. For instance, the majority of patients had diabetes as a comorbidity and several others were immunosuppressed with HIV/AIDS. Both of these conditions alter the immune response in a way that both inhibits normal T cell functions, as well as inducing an inflammatory response by altering Th17 responses and secretion of inflammatory cytokines (26\u201330). The immunosuppression in our study mimics some aspects of the human condition in these patients, such as inhibition of CD4+ T cell responses by HIV-infected patients. However, the chemical immunosuppression used herein is unlikely to mimic the chronic inflammatory state in many of these patients. This higher basal level of immune activation associated with these conditions may be important contributions to the manifestation of the clinically overt serious disease following MERS-CoV infection, and would imply that the immune system plays a role in the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV. This agrees with our observation that upon simple immunosuppression, MERS-CoV replicated to higher levels and showed greater dissemination and shedding, while the pathology was actually reduced in these animals. Pathology was likely lessened due to the absence of inflammatory cells and mediators, as observed histologically in the lung tissues. This suggests that the virus itself might cause little damage to the cells that it infects and this would lead toward a mechanism in which the absence of an efficient immune response allows the virus to replicate to high levels, whereas pathology can be attributed to the overactive inflammatory response, which patients with comorbidities are prone to possess. This is supported by data in the resus and marmoset animal models, which show that increased viral replication and the local immune response to this plays an important role in the pulmonary severity of disease (31). Although not performed in this study, a control group treated with immunosuppressive drugs, and not challenged, would be necessary for a comprehensive picture of the immune status of these animals at the time of necropsy.",

This is supported by the observation that bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of humans infected with MERS-CoV contain high numbers of neutrophils and macrophages (1, 22). Furthermore, lymphopenia has been associated with disease and is potentially caused by infiltration of lymphocytes in the lung tissue and egress from the blood (34). Taking these findings into account, we can envision a model in which infection of the lung tissue and resident immune cells, such as alveolar macrophages, leads to the hyper-production of inflammatory cytokines and immune cell recruitment chemokines, which together limit virus replication, but result in an immunopathologic state. Upon immunosuppression of our macaques, the virus was still able to infect and replicate in the lung tissue, and likely induced local cytokine and chemokine expression; however, the depletion of immune cell populations upon chemical immunosuppression inhibited recruitment of inflammatory cells to the lungs (or infected tissues) and, thus, limited pathology. This is the first direct experimental evidence showing that MERS-CoV has an immunopathogenic component. This is in line with the observation in one patient in South Korea, which was taking prolonged high-dose corticosteroid therapy to control lymphoma activity and hemolytic anemia and displayed persistant viral shedding without clinical progression of the disease (23).",

Blood samples were collected at the indicated time points, inclusive of a control bleed 2 days prior to the initiation of the study (\u221218), and blood cells were enumerated. All blood cell types measured were decreased in the immunosuppressed animals (red lines) at the time of inoculation and remained depressed.

Nasal swabs were positive for viral RNA for all but one immunosuppressed animal starting 3 dpi, with immunosuppressed animals (red lines) reaching higher titers and more sustained shedding. Oral swabs (B) showed a similar trend. Viral replication was assessed in the lungs (C) by performing qRT-PCR using tissue samples from each of the six lobes from each animal. Data are represented as the geometric mean and 95% confidence interval from each group. qRT-PCR was performed on an additional three animals from a previous macaque study (CoV historic) to compare to the immunosuppressed animals. Tissues from the respiratory tracts were also analyzed for RNA levels (D) and the samples from the historic control macaques were grouped with the two control animals from this study (black circles). Data are represented as the geometric means of the groups. To compare the data sets within (C,D), a Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test was performed to determine statistical differences between the control and immunosuppressed groups.
