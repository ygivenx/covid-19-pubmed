            "text": "Nanobodies (Nbs), also called camelid heavy-chain variable domains (VHHs), are single-domain nano-sized antibodies; they are derived from variable fragments of camelid or shark heavy chain-only antibodies (1, 2). Nbs contain four constant regions, named framework regions (FRs), and three connecting variable regions, called complementarity determining regions (CDRs). FRs are responsible for maintaining the structural integrity of Nbs, while CDRs directly bind to antigen epitopes (3). On the one hand, because of their nanometer size (\u223c2.5 nm by 4 nm) and single domain structure, Nbs have the following advantages as antiviral agents: they can be easily expressed for bulk production, they are robust for convenient storage and transportation, and they have good permeability in tissues (4\u20136). On the other hand, also because of their small size, Nbs have the following potential limitations as antiviral agents: they may have limited binding affinity for antigens and may be cleared from the body relatively quickly (the upper size limit of proteins for renal clearance is 60 kDa) (7, 8). Nevertheless, the use of Nbs as antiviral therapeutic agents is gaining more and more clinical acceptance, with the focus on overcoming their potential limitations (9\u201311).",

Bats and dromedary camels are likely the natural reservoir and transmission hosts, respectively, for MERS-CoV. Whereas camel-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV has accounted for most of the human infections, human-to-human spread of MERS-CoV also occurs sporadically (13, 14). Currently, no therapeutic agents or vaccines have been approved for human use. Due to the continued threat of MERS-CoV, there is an urgent need to develop highly potent, cost-effective, and broad-spectrum anti-MERS-CoV therapeutics and vaccines with the potential for large-scale industrial production.",

            "text": "Therapeutic antibodies have been shown to be effective antiviral agents (15, 16). The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of MERS-CoV spike (S) protein is a prime target for therapeutic antibodies. The MERS-CoV S protein guides viral entry into host cells. It first binds to its host receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) through the RBD of its S1 subunit and then fuses viral and host membranes through its S2 subunit (15, 17\u201322). The RBD contains a receptor-binding motif (RBM) region (residues 484 to 567) that directly interacts with DPP4. We have previously shown that RBD-based vaccines are highly immunogenic and can induce the production of potent anti-MERS-CoV cross-neutralizing antibodies (23\u201327). Moreover, we have discovered several RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) with strong neutralizing activities against lethal MERS-CoV infections in human DPP4-transgenic (hDPP4-Tg) mice (15, 28, 29). These and some other RBD-targeting MAbs are currently being developed as anti-MERS-CoV therapeutics in experimental animal models (15, 30\u201336). However, the widespread use of conventional antibodies can be limited by their large size, high production costs, inconvenient storage and transportation, and poor pharmacokinetics (37), making Nbs attractive alternatives to traditional MAbs to treat MERS-CoV infections. Currently, it has not been shown whether MERS-CoV RBD can reliably trigger the production of Nbs, whether the produced Nbs can overcome the potential limitations (e.g., low binding affinity for the RBD and relatively short half-life in the body), or whether the produced Nbs can demonstrate sufficient therapeutic efficacy to warrant further development in clinical settings.",

After four rounds of bio-panning and screening using MERS-CoV RBD-Fc, we isolated a positive clone with the highest binding affinity for the RBD. The gene encoding this RBD-specific Nb was subcloned into yeast expression vector to construct NbMS10 (which contains a C-terminal His6 tag) and NbMS10-Fc (which contains a C-terminal human IgG1 Fc tag) Nbs (Fig. 1). Both NbMS10 and NbMS10-Fc were expressed in yeast cells, secreted into the cell culture supernatants, and purified to homogeneity (Fig. 2A, left). The estimated molecular weights were about 16 kDa for NbMS10 and 50 kDa for NbMS10-Fc, since the latter formed a dimer. These MERS-CoV RBD-specific Nbs from llama, but not severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) RBD-specific MAbs from mice, were recognized by anti-llama antibodies (Fig. 2A, right).

The result showed that both Nbs significantly blocked the binding of RBD to cell-surface DPP4 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A and B). As a negative control, SARS-CoV-RBD-specific 33G4 MAb did not block the binding between MERS-CoV RBD and cell surface DPP4 (Fig. 3A and B). Second, we carried out an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) where recombinant MERS-CoV RBD and recombinant hDPP4 interacted in the presence or absence of recombinant Nbs. The result showed that both Nbs, but not 33G4 MAb, blocked the binding between MERS-CoV RBD and DPP4 in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, compared to NbMS10, NbMS10-Fc blocked the RBD-DPP4 binding more efficiently (Fig. 3C).

Instead, single mutation D539A and double mutations E536A-D539A on MERS-CoV RBD both ablated the binding of NbMS10 to the RBD (Fig. 4A), suggesting that RBD residue Asp539 plays an important role in Nb binding. We further investigated the role of Asp539 in Nb binding using the MERS-CoV pseudovirus entry assay. Neither NbMS10 nor NbMS10-Fc could neutralize the cell entry of MERS-CoV pseudovirus bearing the D539A mutation, again confirming that residue Asp539 is critical for Nb binding (Fig. 4B). To examine of the role of the D539A mutation in DPP4 binding, we carried out an ELISA to detect the binding between DPP4 and MERS-CoV RBD bearing the D539A mutation. The result showed that the D539A mutation significantly reduced the binding of the RBD to DPP4 (Fig. 4C). Overall, these results demonstrate that Nbs recognize the Asp539-containing epitope on MERS-CoV RBD and that this epitope also plays an important role in DPP4 binding. Therefore, the Nbs and DPP4 compete for the same region on MERS-CoV RBD, and mutations in this region can reduce the binding of both the Nbs and DPP4.",

To evaluate the prophylactic efficacy of NbMS10-Fc, mice were injected with a single dose of NbMS10-Fc 3 days before they were infected with a lethal dose of MERS-CoV and were subsequently monitored for their weight and survival. Trastuzumab, an antibody used for treating breast cancer, was used as a control. The result showed that after MERS-CoV infection, mice treated with NbMS10-Fc had a 100% survival rate (Fig. 7A, above) and steady weight (Fig. 7A, below). In comparison, mice treated with trastuzumab all died on day 8 postinfection, and their weight also sharply decreased starting from day 4 postinfection (Fig. 7A). To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of NbMS10-Fc, mice were first infected with MERS-CoV and then treated with single-dose NbMS10-Fc either 1 or 3 days postinfection. The result showed that mice treated with NbMS10-Fc on day 1 postinfection had a 100% survival rate and steady weight (Fig. 7B). In addition, mice treated with NbMS10-Fc on day 3 postinfection also had a 100% survival rate (Fig. 7C, above); although their weights first decreased on day 5 postinfection, it rebounded on day 7 postinfection (Fig. 7C, below). In comparison, mice receiving trastuzumab all died on day 8 after infection, and their weights continuously decreased (Fig. 7B and C). Overall, NbMS10-Fc has potent prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in protecting susceptible animal models against lethal MERS-CoV challenge.",

Because camels likely serve as the transmission hosts for MERS-CoV and also because humans have contact with camels, the constant and continuing transmissions of MERS-CoV from camels to humans make it difficult to eradicate MERS-CoV from the human population. Thus, efficacious, cost-effective, and broad-spectrum anti-MERS-CoV therapeutic agents are needed to prevent and treat MERS-CoV infections in both humans and camels. Nbs have been gaining acceptance as antiviral agents because of their small size, good tissue permeability, and cost-effective production, storage, and transportation. However, their small size may also lead to relative low antigen-binding affinity and quick clearance from the host body. In this study, we have developed a novel MERS-CoV-targeting Nb, NbMS10, and its Fc-fused version, NbMS10-Fc, both of which demonstrate great promise as anti-MERS-CoV therapeutic agents.",

First, the Nbs bind to MERS-CoV RBD with high affinities. The Kd values for NbMS10 and NbMS10-Fc to bind MERS-CoV RBD were 8.71 \u00d7 10\u221210 M and 3.46 \u00d7 10\u221210 M, respectively. The Kd values for RBD-targeting conventional IgGs to bind MERS-CoV RBD range from 7.12 \u00d7 10\u22128 M to 4.47 \u00d7 10\u221211 M (29, 35, 36). Moreover, the ND50 values for NbMS10 and NbMS10-Fc to neutralize MERS-CoV (EMC2012 strain) infection in cultured cells were 3.52 and 2.33 \u03bcg/ml, respectively. The ND50 values for RBD-specific conventional IgGs to neutralize various MERS-CoV strains ranged from micrograms/ml to nanograms/ml (30, 32, 35, 39, 40). Thus, the Nbs developed in this study and conventional IgGs reported previously have comparable MERS-CoV RBD-binding affinities and MERS-CoV-neutralizing activities. Structural comparisons of conventional IgGs and Nbs have shown that the antigen-binding site of IgGs consists of paired heavy-chain and light-chain variable (VH-VL) domains, whereas Nbs lack the light chain and hence cannot form the paired VH-VL domains (8, 41). Instead, Nbs have an extended CDR3 region (>16 amino acid residues), longer than that of the VHs of conventional IgGs (average length 12 amino acid residues) (42\u201344). Moreover, the Nbs developed here contain a 22-amino-acid CDR3; the extended CDR3 enables the Nbs to bind to the antigens with higher affinity (37). Furthermore, although the single-domain Nb (i.e., NbMS10) is small and can be cleared from the serum relatively quickly, the Fc-fused Nb (i.e., NbMS10-Fc) with relatively increased size demonstrates extended in vivo half-life. Therefore, the potential short half-life of Nbs can be overcome by adding the appropriate tag to the Nbs to increase their half-life. Overall, the present study has shown the feasibility of overcoming the potential limitations of Nbs.",

The Kd values between the Nbs and MERS-CoV RBD are significantly lower than that between MERS-CoV RBD and hDPP4 receptor. As a result, the Nbs can outcompete hDPP4 for the binding of MERS-CoV RBD, thereby blocking the binding of MERS-CoV to DPP4, as well as MERS-CoV entry into host cells. It is worth noting that the RBD on the MERS-CoV S trimer frequently undergoes conformational changes, switching between a lying down, receptor-inaccessible conformation and a standing-up, receptor-accessible conformation. Hence, in the context of the virus particles where the RBD is part of the S protein, the Nbs would need to bind the RBD when the RBD is in the standing-up conformation (45). Importantly, the Nbs demonstrate strong cross-neutralizing activities against various MERS-CoV strains isolated from different hosts (humans and camels) and from different time points during MERS-CoV circulation in humans (from years 2012 to 2015). NbMS10 had a relatively high ND50 against the AGV08584/2012 strain containing a V534A mutation, which is consistent with the slightly reduced binding affinity between NbMS10 and MERS-CoV RBD containing the V534A mutation (Fig. 4A). The broad neutralizing spectrum of the Nbs results from the binding site of the Nbs on MERS-CoV RBD, which is located in the Asp539-containing region that plays a critical role in DPP4 binding. Interestingly, several MERS-CoV RBD-specific conventional IgGs also bind to the same epitope (39, 46), suggesting that this region is a hot spot for immune recognition. Although mutations in this region can eliminate the binding of the Nbs to MERS-CoV RBD and hence lead to viral immune evasion, they also reduce the binding of MERS-CoV RBD to receptor DPP4 and hence decrease the efficiency of viral entry. Thus, viral immune evasion from the inhibition of the Nbs through mutations can be costly to MERS-CoV itself. Indeed, residue Asp539 in S protein RBD is highly conserved in almost all of the natural MERS-CoV strains published to date (Fig. 8). Therefore, the MERS-CoV-specific Nbs can potentially be developed into broad-spectrum anti-MERS-CoV therapeutic agents. Despite the above analysis, this study did not examine all possible mutations in the Nb-binding region (since the atomic structures of MERS-CoV RBD complexed with the Nbs are still unknown), and thus it is possible that future escape mutations may occur to residues that this study did not cover. In that case, a combination of the current Nbs and other antibodies targeting other S regions or various RBD epitopes may be helpful in battling the emergence of immune escape MERS-CoV strains.",

The VHH gene (\u223c300 to 450 bp) was further amplified using the above DNA fragment as the template and the forward primer VHH-FR1-D-F (5\u2032-TTTCTATTACTAGGCCCAGCCGGCCGAGTCTGGAGGRRGCTTGGTGCA-3\u2032) and the reverse primer VHH-FR4-D-R (5\u2032-AAACCGTTGGCCATAATGGCCTGAGGAGACGRTGACSTSGGTC-3\u2032) (the SfiI restriction site is underlined). The SfiI-digested VHH DNA fragment was then inserted into phagemid vector pCANTAB5e (Bio-View Shine Biotechnology, China) to construct the VHH phage display library (49). Phage particles were analyzed by ELISA using recombinant MERS-CoV RBD-Fc and Fc of human IgG1 proteins as the positive and negative target proteins, respectively, to screen for RBD-specific Nbs. After four rounds of bio-panning, one of five positive clones, CAb10, with the highest binding to MERS-CoV RBD, was selected for further analyses (Fig. 1).",

Blood was collected from MERS-CoV RBD-Fc protein-immunized alpaca after the last immunization to isolate PBMCs. RNA was then extracted to synthesize cDNA via RT-PCR. This was followed by PCR amplification of the N-terminal IgG heavy-chain fragment (\u223c700 bp), including the VHH gene, while the latter was used as the template to amplify the VHH gene fragment (\u223c300 to 450 bp). The VHH DNA sequence was further ligated into phagemid vector pCANTAB5e and transformed into E. coli TG1 competent cells to construct VHH library. VHH phage display was carried out to isolate RBD-specific clones. After four rounds of bio-panning, the RBD-specific VHH coding sequence was confirmed from the selected positive clones. The identified VHH coding gene containing a C-terminal His6 or human IgG1 Fc was inserted into Pichia pastoris yeast expression vector pPICZ\u03b1A to construct NbMS10 and NbMS10-Fc, respectively, for further soluble expression and purification.",
