Anxiety, was explained for the first time in the fifteenth century as the physical pressure. Also, Banner in the psycho-physical program, used it as the cause of the disease in 17th century (Hemati, 2005). Job is one of the most important causes of anxiety in individual\u2019s lives (Rahimi, 2009; Mehrabi et al., 2005). Anxiety disorders appear to be pervasive, and increasingly prevalent in workplaces in recent years. The etiology of most anxiety disorders, is multifactorial so, in most cases a combination of several factors cause anxiety including; individual genetic, developmental, work and non-work causes. It seems that, both; work-related organizational-individual and, social risk factors interact. The interaction determines the onset, progression and course of anxiety disorders (Saki et al., 2002; Mattew et al., 2003).",

They concluded that, the majority of participants suffered from low level of stress (54.4%). Also, the most important factors related to stress was \u201cunpleasant smelling\u201d in operating room (76% of participants), and the least important factors was interrelationship with their colleagues (29.7% of paticipants). While, in this study, the most important cause for anxiety was concern about encountering with infected biologic factors. All health care providers in hospitals, especially nurses in Iran, are dealing with health-care issues related to the spread of serious infectious diseases, including: hepatitis B and C, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and HIV. In recent years, many efforts has been performed to reduce the risk of disease transmission to nurses at work place. However, the risks of being infected with these diseases are considered as one of the most important occupational disease yet (Costigliola et al., 2012).",

In our study, there was no significant relationship between level of education and anxiety.
