The milder allelic condition, Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) is also caused by dystrophin mutations, but these are typically in-frame deletions that allow synthesis of internally truncated dystrophin isoforms that retain partial function. Characterization of dystrophin gene arrangements in mildly affected and asymptomatic BMD individuals has revealed that deletion of substantial domains of the DMD gene can yield dystrophin isoforms of near-normal function. These observations led to the concept of targeted exon removal around a DMD mutation to reframe the dystrophin transcript, and the supposition that such a strategy could treat DMD.",

Proof of concept that targeted exon removal could restore dystrophin expression in vivo was demonstrated in mdx mice (Mann et al. 2001), a dog model of DMD (Yokota et al. 2009) and more recently in DMD patients (van Deutekom et al. 2007; Kinali et al. 2009; Cirak et al. 2011; Goemans et al. 2011). Oligomer design and clinical studies have focused on removing exons that flank frame-shift deletions in the two dystrophin deletion \u201chotspots,\u201d however, numerous motifs control exon selection and splicing, and mutations in any of these can ablate gene expression and cause disease. Splice motif disruption prevents proper exon selection or results in the use of cryptic splice sites that cause partial exon loss or intron retention, and may generate multiple aberrant transcripts (Fernandez-Cadenas et al. 2003), while deep intronic mutations can activate pseudoexon inclusion in the mature gene transcript. Although pseudoexon activation in the dystrophin gene transcript is a rare event, this is the only type of gene lesion for which targeted exon skipping would lead to a normal full-length gene transcript. Gurvich and colleagues reported two DMD cases caused by the inclusion of pseudoexons, derived from introns 11 and 45, and subsequent oligomer-induced skipping of the aberrant exons (Gurvich et al. 2008).",

Correct exon selection requires basic cis-acting elements important in exon recognition, and canonical splice sites, embedded within the context of noncanonical sequence that is conducive to splice site recognition and binding of splicing factors (Krawczak et al. 2007). Mutations to both canonical and noncanonical sequences can weaken splice site recognition and may result in exon skipping, but the consequences are difficult to predict (De Conti et al. 2012). Donor splice site definition is a key step in splice site recognition and mutations affecting the exon\u2013intron junction are reported to result in exon skipping when the immediate vicinity is devoid of alternative splice sites (Krawczak et al. 2007).",

The inactivation of these donor splice sites did not lead to exon skipping, as may be expected (Krawczak et al. 2007) but instead caused retention of the downstream introns. Despite this similarity, one mutation responded to single exon skipping while the other required dual exon skipping to overcome the disease-causing mutation and restore the open reading frame. As we have found with other small dystrophin gene lesions, it appears that the various dystrophin splice site mutations will require personalized oligomer design and exon skipping strategies on a case-by-case basis (Forrest et al. 2010; Fragall et al. 2011; Adkin et al. 2012).",

The use of human tissue in this study has been approved by the University of Western Australia Human Ethics Committee (approval number RA/4/1/2295). Fibroblasts and myogenic cells from normal and DMD patient muscle biopsies were expanded and differentiated as described previously (Adkin et al. 2012). Cells from the patient DMD-16ss, carrying the exon 16 donor splice site were obtained from a muscle biopsy, while dermal fibroblasts were prepared from a skin biopsy from the DMD patient (DMD-45ss) with an exon 45 splice site mutation. Normal myogenic cells were extracted from surplus muscle biopsy fragments from patients undergoing elective procedures, with informed consent. Fibroblasts were converted to myoblasts through forced myogenesis (Lattanzi et al. 1998) by transduction with a MyoD expressing adenovirus, Ad5.f50.AdApt.MyoD (The Native Antigen Company, Oxford, U.K.), and then differentiated in low serum media. Briefly, patient fibroblasts were cultured until 80% confluent, washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), detached with 0.25% Trypsin (w/v) (Gibco, Life Technologies), inactivated with medium containing 10% FCS, pelleted by centrifugation at 600 g and then resuspended in DMEM (Life Technologies) supplemented with 5% horse serum. Ad5.f50.AdApt.MyoD was added at a multiplicity of infection of 200 and the cells were seeded at 30,000 cells per well in 24 well plates that had been sequentially pretreated for 1 h with 50 \u03bcg/mL poly d-lysine (Sigma, Melbourne, Australia) and 100 \u03bcg/mL Matrigel (BD Biosciences, North Ryde, Australia). Twenty-four hours later, the medium was replaced. The cells were allowed to differentiate for 96 h after forced myogenesis, before being transfected with oligomers. In our experience, forced myogenesis of fibroblasts is adequate for RNA studies, but is not always efficient enough to result in induced dystrophin levels that are detectable by western blotting, and is very dependent on the quality of the original cell preparation.",

However, amplification across exons 1\u20137 and 69\u201375 confirmed that the dystrophin mRNA was indeed present, and could be readily detected under standard amplification conditions (Fig. 2A and B). RT-PCR was then carried out using primer combinations to ascertain if intron 16 was retained within the mature mRNA. A forward primer directed to exon 15 and a reverse primer targeting intron 16, as well as a forward primer annealing near the end of intron 16 and a reverse primer targeting exon 20 were used. RT-PCR products were generated from the patient RNA, corresponding to amplicons of the expected length if intron 16 was retained, and the remainder of the transcript had been correctly spliced (Fig. 2C and D). No such signals were generated from RNA extracted from normal human muscle and DNA sequencing of the exon 15F, intron16R product showed that dystrophin exon 15 was correctly spliced to exon 16, but the beginning of intron 16 was retained in the transcript (data not shown). Similarly, exons 17\u201320 were correctly spliced, but the end of intron 16 was included in the patient transcript, leading us to conclude that the 20.3 kb intron 16 was retained after splicing, expected to result in a full-length muscle specific dystrophin transcript estimated to be in excess of 34 kb (20.3 kb of intron retained within the 14 kb normal sized mRNA).",

It was considered unlikely that nonsense-mediated decay alone could account for what appeared to be extremely low levels of transcript, as we routinely detect dystrophin transcripts in many different DMD patient cell and tissue samples, under equivalent amplification conditions (Arechavala-Gomeza et al. 2007; Forrest et al. 2010; Fragall et al. 2011; Adkin et al. 2012). Hence, we hypothesized that a catastrophic disruption of pre-mRNA processing may have ablated the dystrophin transcript, downstream of the gene lesion. However, amplification of the dystrophin mRNA upstream and downstream of the defects indicated that the transcript was indeed present in both cases, and the inability to generate products across the mutations was a limitation of the RT-PCR. Undertaking RT-PCR with a forward primer directed to exon 14 and reverse primers annealing within intron 16 generated amplification products of the expected size from DMD-16ss RNA, if intron 16 was retained within the mature transcript. These amplicons could not have arisen from DNA contamination as introns 14 and 15, 110 bases and about 7.6 kb, respectively, would preclude amplification under these conditions. Similar experiments, using a forward primer annealing toward the end of intron 16 and a reverse primer targeting exon 20 also generated a product of the anticipated size if intron 16 was retained within the mature mRNA.",

At a transfection concentration of 5 nmol/L, the amplicon pattern was sporadic and similar to that observed in untreated cells, and thus were assumed to indicate lack of rescue of the transcript. Subsequent titration showed exon 16 skipping could be induced in DMD-16ss patient cells after transfection at lower concentrations (1\u201310 nmol/L), but the amplicon representing dystrophin transcripts missing exon 16 only was sporadic (data not shown). This is consistent with retention of intron 16 in the majority of the transcripts, suggesting a possible threshold effect for efficient splice switching for this mutation. Interestingly, when we first reported exon skipping in normal human myogenic cells with H16A(\u221212 + 19) over the oligomer transfection range 10\u2013200 nmol/L (Harding et al. 2006), a dose response was not apparent. Subsequent titration of the oligomer in normal human myogenic cells showed a clear dose response between 0.8 and 25 nmol/L (data not shown), but this was not observed in the patient cells. The inability to reliably induce exon 16 excision in the DMD-16ss patient cells at low oligomer concentrations could reflect the influence of the donor splice site mutation on oligomer-induced modification of dystrophin splicing in this patient. This was not unexpected, as we have previously showed that small DMD mutations can influence oligomer-mediated exon skipping outcomes (Forrest et al. 2010; Fragall et al. 2011).",

Despite the rare, perhaps unique nature of the mutation reported here, this patient could be considered an excellent candidate for personalized exon skipping. Not only can the target exon be excised at high efficiency, at least in vitro, but more significantly, the loss of exon 16 does not appear to compromise dystrophin function (Schwartz et al. 2007). By chance, several members of a family were identified as missing this exon, and these asymptomatic individuals did not show elevated serum creatine kinase levels. The intent in applying exon skipping to the dystrophin transcript is to convert a DMD pre-mRNA into a BMD-like isoform, however, the loss of exon 16 from the mature dystrophin gene transcript results in a dystrophin of normal function. It is conceivable that induction of low levels of a \u201cnormal\u201d dystrophin would confer substantial therapeutic benefit, and therefore such patients may be better candidates for clinical evaluation than those whose more common mutations only allow generation of a somewhat compromised BMD-like dystrophin isoform.",

Exclusion of exon 45 is potentially applicable to an estimated 7\u20138% of all DMD cases (van Deutekom and van Ommen 2003; Aartsma-Rus et al. 2009). However, skipping of exon 45 alone will not be of any benefit to DMD-45ss, as dystrophin transcripts missing exon 45 are out-of-frame, and dual skipping of either exons 44 and 45 or 45 and 46 is required for reading frame rescue.",

The oligomers targeting exons 44 or 46 had no detectable splice-switching effect in the DMD-45ss patient cells, and our experience with DMD-16ss suggested that intron 45 was retained in the dystrophin mRNA, precluding amplicon generation. This was subsequently confirmed by nested RT-PCR carried out from exon 43 to intron 45. The splice-switching AO H45A(\u221203 + 22) induced robust exon 45 skipping in normal cells at 50\u2013100 nmol/L, with a decrease in efficiency evident at lower concentrations. When the oligomer was transfected into DMD-45ss patient cells, there was a pronounced threshold effect, with oligomer concentrations of 50 nmol/L and higher being necessary to excise exon 45 and suppress intron 45 retention in the DMD transcript in vitro.",

Exon 45 and 46 skipping appeared to be the more effective strategy, as determined by the relative amounts of the induced amplicon reflecting dual exon skipping. Transfection of patient cells, with either oligomer cocktail at 2.5 nmol/L did not induce any detectable product, suggesting retention of intron. Skipping of exons 44 and 45 appeared less effective, and specific RT-PCR assays confirmed the presence of some transcripts retaining intron 45. Surprisingly, the intron specific RT-PCR assays indicated some transcripts retained intron 45 despite the seemingly more efficient exon 45 and 46 skipping.",

Overcoming the exon 16 gene lesion was readily achieved by skipping of this single exon, with flanking introns 15 and 16, a total expanse of 29.1 kb. In contrast, addressing the exon 45 splice mutation necessitated removal of two exons and the associated introns. Intron 44, the longest in DMD and perhaps all genes, is over 248 kb in length. Skipping exons 44 and 45 requires some 355 kb of pre-mRNA to be excised, whereas the alternative strategy, removing exons 45 and 46 excludes 286 kb from the primary gene transcript. Two possibilities could account for the variable dual exon skipping efficiencies. Not all oligomers excise a targeted exon with equal efficiency, exon 44 skipping in normal cells is less effective than removal of exon 46, although this is further complicated when using oligomer combinations. When assessed in normal myogenic cells, the excision of exons 44 and 45 appeared more efficient than skipping of exon 45 and 46. Another consideration is the possibility of an upper limit on the distance between exons that permit lariat formation and subsequent splicing.",

Despite this superficial similarity, the DMD-16ss gene transcript responded to single exon skipping, so that near-normal levels of dystrophin were restored in vitro, as assessed by western blotting. In contrast, the DMD-45ss dystrophin transcript was not amenable to single exon skipping, whereas dual skipping of exons 44 and 45 or 45 and 46 was efficiently induced, with a clear threshold effect evident. We suggest that it is likely that exon skipping strategies will need to be individualized for many of the nondeletion DMD cases.",
