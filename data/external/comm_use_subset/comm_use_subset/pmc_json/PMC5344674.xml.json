Further molecular characterization revealed several fundamental differences compared to nodaviruses. For instance, translation of the Orsay CP utilizes an AUG-independent mechanism [7]. The nematode viruses also lack the subgenomic RNA3 found in nodaviruses that is used to express the nonstructural proteins B1/B2. The nonstructural B1 and B2 proteins encoded by both alpha- and betanodaviruses [8\u201310] function as either a host RNA interference (RNAi) suppressor or an anti-necrotic death factor to modulate cell death during virus infection [9\u201315]. In particular, alphanodavirus B2 folds into an \u03b1-helical structure that dimerizes in solution and binds dsRNA in a sequence-independent manner [16\u201318]. However, a recent study showed that the Orsay nonstructural protein \u03b4 does not possess any RNAi suppression activity [19].",

While the wildtype N2 strain only supports limited infection, inactivation of genes in the RNAi pathway such as rde-1 [2] and drh-1 [20] can sensitize N2 worms to Orsay infection. In C. elegans, RNAi following Orsay infection is not systemic, and there is no transgenerational inheritance of Orsay virus-induced silencing [21], different from the RNAi induced by exogenous dsRNA. In addition to RNAi, the ubiquitin-mediated defense also promotes Orsay resistance in N2 worms as revealed by a recent transcriptome study [22].",

The RNA structure motif mediating the ribosomal frameshifting is conserved in all three nematode-infecting viruses [7]. The CP-\u03b4 fusion protein was detected in both infected worms and purified virion samples [7], but the expression of free \u03b4 has yet to be confirmed.

The N-terminal region of \u03b4 forms a pentameric \u03b1-helical bundle, but the rest of the protein is most likely \u03b2-stranded as suggested by sequence analysis and CD spectroscopy. The pentameric nature of the full-length \u03b4 fiber has been independently verified by both mass spectrometry and analytical ultracentrifugation. Coexpressing CP and CP-\u03b4 in insect cells produced Orsay VLPs with an enhanced amount of CP-\u03b4 compared to native virions. These VLPs were found to have multiple long fibers protruding from the capsid surface when observed under EM, indicating that the \u03b4 sequence adopts the same fibrous structure in both CP-\u03b4 and free \u03b4. Considering its five-fold symmetry, the CP-\u03b4 fibers are expected to occupy five-fold vertices in the capsid. Furthermore, reverse genetics confirmed that the structural integrity of CP-\u03b4 is essential for Orsay infection, and competition assays showed that purified \u03b4 proteins, when added in trans, effectively inhibit Orsay infection. By analogy with other viral capsid-associated fiber proteins, the Orsay CP-\u03b4 likely functions in cell entry as a cell receptor binding protein.",

            "text": "To characterize the structure and functions of Orsay \u03b4/CP-\u03b4, the \u03b4 ORF was cloned into a pET vector for overexpression in E. coli. A 6\u00d7His SUMO tag was added at the N-terminus of the full-length \u03b4 to facilitate protein purification (Fig 1A). Recombinant \u03b4 was expressed as a soluble protein and ~60% could be recovered in the cytoplasmic fraction. When subjected to a Superdex-200 gel filtration column, \u03b4 produced a sharp peak at ~58 ml, corresponding to an apparent molecular size of ~670 kDa, which is substantially higher than the calculated molecular mass of a monomer (i.e. 38.4 kDa) (S1 Fig). Negative-staining transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was then performed to examine the molecular organization of \u03b4. Surprisingly, TEM images showed that \u03b4 forms fibrous molecules of extended length (Fig 1B), thus explaining its unusual elution profile from the size exclusion column. Based on the measurement of 136 molecules, the length of the \u03b4 fibers was determined to be ~419\u00b152-\u00c5 (Figs 1B and 2C). Close examination of individual \u03b4 molecules reveals several fine structural details: (1) at one end there is a globular head domain with a diameter of ~50-\u00c5; (2) a second globule, which is slightly smaller, is found at roughly two-fifths of its length; (3) the thickness of the fiber is only ~20-\u00c5 in most parts; and (4) the other end of the fiber opposite to the large head domain often appears to be slightly enlarged in diameter (Fig 1B). There was no particular bending point observed along the fiber, but the fibrous region near the globular head often exhibited more pronounced curvatures. Other than the ~420-\u00c5 \u03b4 fibers, longer or thicker filaments were not observed in EM, suggesting that further oligomerization of the \u03b4 fiber did not occur.",

The online server Motif Scan [31] also detected a valine-rich region in the middle of the Orsay \u03b4 sequence that is known to form regular arrays of \u03b2-strands in a number of exo/cytoskeleton-related proteins including putative insect cuticle proteins and a putative adhesin in Parabacteroides distasonis (PDB ID: 3LJY). Circular dichroism (CD) was measured to experimentally determine the secondary structure content of \u03b4 (Fig 1C). The CD spectra indeed showed a single trough near 220nm, which is highly characteristic for \u03b2-stranded structures, consistent with the results from secondary structure prediction. A quantitative analysis of the CD spectra was done using the program BeStSel [32], which estimated that \u03b4 is composed of 3.3% \u03b1-helices and 42.6% \u03b2-strands (Fig 1C).",

To test this hypothesis, a number of \u03b4 truncates were designed with progressively larger amounts of N- and C-terminal sequences removed. While the N-terminally truncated mutants, including \u03b4(167\u2013346), \u03b4(195\u2013346), \u03b4(220\u2013346), \u03b4(241\u2013346) and \u03b4(256\u2013346), were poorly soluble, all C-terminally truncated mutants behaved similarly to the full-length \u03b4 during purification and were eluted as a major peak from the gel filtration column (Fig 1A and S1 Fig). TEM further confirmed that both \u03b4(1\u2013162) and \u03b4(1\u2013241) formed fibrous molecules, however, their lengths were shorter than the full-length protein, with \u03b4(1\u2013162) and \u03b4(1\u2013241) fibers measured to be 215\u00b130-\u00c5 (n = 96) and 359\u00b132-\u00c5 (n = 35) long, respectively (Fig 2B and 2C). Considering that the full-length \u03b4 protein is ~420-\u00c5 long, the length of these two mutants is roughly proportional to the size of their respective sequence. The large globular head domain was absent from both \u03b4(1\u2013162) and \u03b4(1\u2013241), indicating that the head domain is formed by the C-terminal sequence. Overall, our results suggest that the \u03b4 protein fiber is a parallel oligomer with a C-terminal head domain, because these two \u03b4 protein truncates formed fibrous molecules resembling the left end of the \u03b4 protein fiber (Fig 1D).",

The structure of \u03b4(1\u201366) was determined by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) using SeMet-substituted crystals (Table 1). By subsequent molecular replacement and refinement against a native dataset, we were able to establish the final structure to 2.2-\u00c5 resolution (Table 1, Fig 3).",

This five-helical bundle is ~80-\u00c5 long and ~35-\u00c5 wide (Fig 3A and 3B). Each \u03b4(1\u201366) molecule folds into two \u03b1-helices that are connected by a 9-aa linker (i.e. residues 21 to 29) (Fig 3C). The longer \u03b1-helix, consisting of residues 30 to 63, has a kink at around residue 40 (Fig 3A). The helix after the kink contains three regular heptad repeats (i.e. 40VSDKLDKISESLNTLVECVID60, in which hydrophobic residues are highlighted in bold). Heptad repeats are frequently observed in coiled coil structures (i.e. dimeric, trimeric, tetrameric and pentameric) and they contain amino acid sequences arranged in the periodicity of (a b c d e f g), with positions a and d predominantly occupied by hydrophobic residues. Hydrophobic side chains at the positions a and d make up a continuous hydrophobic surface on the \u03b1-helix so that multiple \u03b1-helices can wrap around each other to form a stable helical bundle [34, 35]. Surface representation of the \u03b4(1\u201366) pentamer shows a ~3 to 5-\u00c5 wide channel running through the entire molecule. A total of 18 residues are found to have their side chains pointing towards the interior of the channel, including Y6, Y10, T14, L18, A21, Y23, L25, A26, P28, Y32, W35, F36, V40, L44, I47, L51, L54, and V58 (Fig 3C and 3D). Therefore, the core of the entire helical bundle is mostly hydrophobic, except for a single location at T14. In the electron density map, blobs of densities that are modeled as water molecules occupy the central channel (Fig 3D). The large hydrophobic cavities at the center of the helical bundle may help to accommodate these water molecules [36].",

The use of two baculoviruses would allow the control of the relative amount of CP and CP-\u03b4 to optimize particle assembly. Recombinant VLPs were purified by Ni-NTA affinity as both CP and CP-\u03b4 contained a C-terminal His-tag. Under negative-staining EM, we observed many spherically shaped particles associated with long fibers (Fig 5A). The diameter of these particles is around 350-\u00c5, closely matching that of the Orsay viron or VLP [2, 23]. The length of particle-associated fibers, when measured from the surface of the capsid, is 387\u00b142-\u00c5 (n = 23), which is similar to the length of free \u03b4 measured at 419\u00b152-\u00c5 (Fig 5B). Some of the fibers even show a head domain at their distal end, consistent with our assumption that the N-terminal coiled coil of the \u03b4 fiber is directly attached to the CP surface spike. Considering the 5-fold symmetry of the \u03b4 protein, in principle there can be up to 12 copies of the CP-\u03b4 fibers in each capsid, with one occupying each icosahedral vertex (Fig 5D). Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel of our capsid sample showed the mass ratio of CP-\u03b4 to CP is around 1:2 (Fig 5C), which corresponds to roughly 1:4 in molar ratio, suggesting that on average there should be ~7 pentameric fibers in each particle. The most fibers we observed in a single VLP were seven. It is possible that some fibers were not visible due to staining artifacts, or that not all CP-\u03b4 was properly incorporated into capsids.",

These worms were then evaluated for viral infectivity by two measurements: infection symptoms and viral load. Orsay-infected worms often display a transparent intestine phenotype (Fig 6C). The percentage of worms with such symptom was drastically reduced with the two mutant viruses (Fig 6C). The L44R mutant virus appeared more defective than K43E, as worms infected with the L44R virus showed no difference than uninfected worms, while a small fraction of worms infected with the K43E virus showed the infection symptom (Fig 6C). These observations were confirmed in multiple independent lines of transgenic worms (Figs 6C and S7, demonstrating that the differences were indeed caused by viral genotypes.

The use of recombinant VLPs enabled us to directly visualize the CP-\u03b4 fibers due to the enhanced amount of CP-\u03b4 in the VLP sample.

The crystal structure of the Orsay capsid shows that the C-terminus of the Orsay CP is tucked underneath of a tightly bound trimeric spike [23] (S8 Fig). Therefore, for a trimeric fiber to form, the polypeptide sequence would have to go around the timeric spike from outside, spanning a distance of at least 60-\u00c5 in order to reach the 3-fold axis. By comparison, the C-terminus of the CP points toward a depression around the 5-fold symmetry axis, with only a 25-\u00c5 traveling distance to the 5-fold, thus facilitating the formation of pentameric fibers. Our results from mass spectrometry also indicate that the pentameric \u03b4 fiber is very stable and does not dissociate unless under high energetic conditions, suggesting that it is unlikely for the \u03b4 sequence to adopt an alternative trimeric configuration in the form of the CP-\u03b4 fusion protein.",

Like CP-\u03b4, reovirus \u03c31 fiber protein is organized into three modules: a coiled coil tail domain at the N-terminus, a \u03b2-filament body domain in the middle, and a C-terminal \u03b2-stranded head domain. The adenovirus fiber does not have a coiled coil region, but also has a head-and-tail morphology with a long shaft made of ~20 \u03b2-spiral repeats and a C-terminal head comprised of an eight-stranded \u03b2-barrel [45]. Both adenovirus and reovirus fibers are situated at five-fold symmetry axes with their N-terminal sequence interacting with the viral capsid and their C-terminal head at the distal end [46, 47], same as the Orsay CP-\u03b4. The Orsay CP-\u03b4 forms pentameric fibers, however, while the adenovirus and reovirus fibers are both trimeric. In adenovirus and reovirus, the cell receptor binding sites are mapped to the globular head domain of their fibers, except that in some reoviruses a sialic acid binding site is found in the middle body domain of \u03c31 [48\u201351]. The overall lengths of the adenovirus (i.e. Ad2 and Ad5) and reovirus fibers are ~325 and 385-\u00c5, respectively [45], slightly shorter than the Orsay CP-\u03b4 fiber.",

The globular head of CP-\u03b4 likely hosts the cell receptor binding site as it does in reovirus and adenovirus. The binding of CP-\u03b4 to the host receptor should allow virus attachment to the host intestinal cells for the subsequent cell entry. The cell receptor molecule for Orsay has yet to be determined, but we expect that viral particles containing only CP but no CP-\u03b4 fibers would be non-infectious due to blocked cell entry. It is unclear whether having only 1 to 2 copies of the CP-\u03b4 fiber instead of a full complement of 12 would negatively impact Orsay\u2019s infectivity, but dsDNA bacteriophages such as \u03d529 are highly infectious with only one tail structure in each viral particle [52, 53]. For the bacteriophage T4, it was demonstrated that three fibers per virion are sufficient for infectivity, and reducing the lipopolysaccharide receptor concentration on cell surface has the same effect as tail fiber limitation on phage infectivity [54]. Therefore, it is possible that not all 12 copies of the CP-\u03b4 fiber are needed for Orsay, especially if abundant receptor molecules exist on the C. elegans intestinal cell surface.",

Both of our infectivity assays in Fig 6, one based on the body transparency of infected animals and the other measuring viral RNA in worm lysates, relied on one infection cycle and therefore mainly detected mutant defects in viral entry. Mutant defects downstream from viral RNA replication cannot be effectively measured using these assays. It remains possible that the free \u03b4 protein may interact with the host machinery to promote virus assembly and/or mediate the release of viral particles from the apical side of the worm intestine cells. Furthermore, many non-enveloped animal viruses are known to encode a lytic peptide or protein, but such function has not yet been reported for Orsay. Free \u03b4 may function as a lytic protein.

An ionization voltage of 2200 V was used in combination with a 70V source fragmentation voltage. The intact complex was best observed with MS2 ETD 0.1 ms reaction time, Quadrupole isolation of 3300 m/z with a 500 m/z window and 15,000 resolution in an Orbitrap analyzer. Note that these conditions produce effective intact protein complex observation and do not result in substantial dissociation of the non-covalent complex or fragmentation of covalent peptide bonds. For the dissociation of the pentameric complex and observation of the intact monomer, the following conditions were used: MS2 with HCD 12% energy, 70V Source Fragmentation, 60000 Resolution Orbitrap with Quadrupole isolation of 3300 m/z with a 500 m/z window in high mass range, 47 scans. Complex dissociation was efficiently achieved with HCD of 9% collision energy and complete complex dissociation was observed around 12%-13% HCD collision energy. CID required much higher energies: up to 90% to see similar complex dissociation. Note the relatively high collisional energies used to achieved dissociation of the pentamer, with essentially no cleavage of covalent bonds. Orbitrap high resolution analysis (500,000 resolving power setting) allows isotopic separation of the monomer with both HCD and CID fragmentation; however, isotopic resolution of the intact 192kDa was not possible, nor expected. For isotopic resolution of the monomer the following conditions were used: MS2 with CID 50% Collision energy, 70V Source Fragmentation, 500,000 resolving power setting on the Orbitrap with Quadrupole isolation of 3300 m/z with a 500 m/z window in high mass range mode.",

All data were analyzed with UltraScan-III ver. 3.5, release 2174 (http://www.ultrascan3.uthscsa.edu). All samples were measured in a 50 mM TRIS buffer, pH 7.5, containing 250 mM NaCl. Hydrodynamic corrections for buffer density and viscosity were estimated by UltraScan to be 1.010 g/ml and 1.036 cP. The partial specific volume of the delta protein (0.7399 ml/g) was estimated by UltraScan from protein sequence analogous to methods outlined in Laue et al [60]. SV data were analyzed according to the approach described in [61]. Optimization was performed by 2-dimensional spectrum analysis (2DSA) [62] with simultaneous removal of time- and radially-invariant noise contributions [63] and meniscus fitting. After noise subtraction and meniscus fitting, the data were analyzed by the 2DSA Monte Carlo analysis to identify particle distributions in the frictional ratio\u2013sedimentation coefficient domain [64]. The distribution suggested that a decreasing sigmoid parameterization is suitable for fitting the data with the parametrically constrained spectrum analysis (PCSA-DS), using Tikhonov regularization [65]. The calculations are computationally intensive and are carried out on high-performance computing platforms [66]. All calculations were performed on the Lonestar cluster at the Texas Advanced Computing Center at the University of Texas at Austin and on Comet and Gordon at San Diego Supercomputing Center.
