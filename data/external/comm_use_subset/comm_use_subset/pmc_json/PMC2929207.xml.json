In other words, it has remained a challenge to identify the biological parameters that determine a PP disease course.",

In most cases the pathology of the disease can only be investigated in post-mortem material, which quite frequently represents the end-stage of the disease. The study of CSF taken during disease appears a good alternative. CSF is in close contact with the CNS parenchyma and collects the products of the inflammatory and neurodegenerative processes of MScl activity.",

Other studies added additional data on elevated immunoglobulin expression in MScl CSF, as well as increased levels of apolipoprotein E [11], [12]. Yet in all currently reported proteomics CSF studies of MScl patients either only a single subtype of MScl patients or a combined group of all subtypes of MScl was studied, whilst the differences between the subtypes of MScl remained unexplored. Because RR MScl and PP MScl are very different in terms of disease course and disease progression, this also has therapeutic consequences. Hence, there are probably also differences on a biological and pathological level, which could, if determined, be very useful for elucidation of the biology and pathology of both disease types.",

After calibration by means of omnipresent albumin peaks, an analysis matrix is generated. A univariate analysis, in which a p-value was determined for every peak position, was used for statistical analysis, in which two groups were compared at a time, for a total of three individual comparisons between the groups. The differentially abundant peaks (p<0.01) in the comparisons were considered for identification purposes. The fold increase of every identified peptide with p<0.01 in the comparisons was determined to confirm differential abundance between groups. Assessment of the statistical background, by means of permutation of a series of 50 scramblings of the samples for each comparison, was used to define a cut-off number for the determination of statistically significant differences between groups. In this permutation procedure all samples are randomly assigned a new group number, scrambling the sample group compositions, prior to performing the univariate analysis to determine the p-values for each peak position. By this method the number of peaks that is assigned a p-value below 0.01 by chance is determined. Iterative repetition of this procedure allows for a statistically relevant mean with standard deviation that could be taken as a realistic background value for this not normally distributed data.",

Five \u00b5L digest were loaded on to a C18 trap column (C18 PepMap, 300 \u00b5m ID \u00d75 mm, 5 \u00b5m particle size, 100 \u00c5 pore size; Dionex, The Netherlands) and desalted for 10 minutes using a flow rate of 20 \u00b5L/min 0.1% TFA. Then the trap column was switched online with the analytical column (PepMap C18, 75 \u00b5m ID \u00d7150 mm, 3 \u00b5m particle and 100 \u00c5 pore size; Dionex, The Netherlands) and peptides were eluted with following binary gradient: 0%\u201325% solvent B in 120 min and 25%\u201350% solvent B in further 60 minutes, where solvent A consist of 2% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic in water and solvent B consists of 80% acetonitrile and 0.08% formic acid in water. Column flow rate was set to 300 nL/min. For MS detection a data dependent acquisition method was used: high resolution survey scan from 400\u20131800 Th. was performed in the Orbitrap (value of target of automatic gain control AGC 106, resolution 30,000 at 400 m/z; lock mass was set to 445.120025 u (protonated (Si(CH3)2O)6) [15]). Based on this survey scan the 5 most intensive ions were consecutively isolated (AGC target set to 104 ions) and fragmented by collision-activated dissociation (CAD) applying 35% normalized collision energy in the linear ion trap. After precursors were selected for MS/MS, they were excluded for further MS/MS spectra for 3 minutes. The MS/MS identifications were obtained using in the Bioworks 3.2 (peak picking by Extract_msn, default settings) software package (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany), and its' SEQUEST feature, using minimum XC scores of 1.8, 2.2 and 3.75 for reliable identification of single, double and triple charged ions respectively in the UniProt-database (version 56.0, human taxonomy (20069 entries)). Carboxymethylation of Cysteine (+57.021 u) as fixed and oxidation of Methionine (+15.996 u) as variable modifications and tryptic cleavage were considered. The number of allowed missed cleavages was 2, the mass tolerance for precursor ions was 10 ppm and for fragment ions 0.5 Da. The cut-off for mass differences with the theoretical mass of the identified peptides was set at 2 ppm.",

This was done by commercially available ELISA (for vitamin D-binding protein) and by western blot (for protein jagged-1), using a validation cohort of patients consisting of 10 RR MScl and 10 PP MScl samples. The samples of the validation cohort were demographically and clinically comparable to the original cohort of patients (average EDSS RR MScl group (standard deviation in brackets): 2.5 (0.8), average EDSS PP MScl group 2.8 (1.0), and the disease duration, presence/absence of oligoclonal IgG bands and male female ratio were all similar to the original cohort (no p-values below 0.05) using a t-test to compare the groups). Additionally we also measured the original samples using this ELISA and western blot. For the first protein, vitamin D-binding protein, we performed a commercially available ELISA (Immundiagnostik, Germany) according to the manufacturers specifications. For the second protein that was differentially abundant between the both MScl types, jagged-1, we performed a two-step western blot using goat anti-jagged1 antibodies (primary antibody) and anti-goat antibodies (secondary antibody) (Sigma Aldrich, United States). Protein transfer was checked by Ponceau staining. Quantitative assessment of the gel bands after photoluminescence was performed using Image J (freely available at rsb.info.nih.gov/ij).",

Although many of the identified peptides do not correspond to peak masses in the analysis matrix, we were able to identify a number of differentially abundant peptides for all three comparisons (full list, including charge states and sequence coverage, can be found in the supplementary material (Supplementary Information Mass Spectrometry S1 file)). Of the 43 differentially abundant peptide masses that were observed using MALDI-FT-ICR mass spectrometry in the comparison of PP MScl versus the controls we were able to identify 29 peptides (Supplementary Information Table S1). These peptides included several peptides of Ig gamma-1 and Ig kappa. Another differentially abundant peptide was identified as a part apolipoprotein D, which has previously been shown to be elevated intrathecally in MScl patients [17]. In the comparison of RR MScl versus controls we were able to identify 24 of the 41 differentially abundant peptide masses, which, as was the case with the comparison of PP MScl versus the controls, also included several peptides of Ig gamma-1 and Ig kappa as well as apolipoprotein D (Supplementary Information Table S2). In fact, of the 24 peptides identified in this comparison, 14 were also identified in the comparison of PP MScl versus the controls, indicating that the differences of the two MScl types compared to the controls are remarkably similar.

Interestingly, our approach using sensitive state-of the art mass spectrometry techniques, led to the identification of a few distinct CSF proteins, some of them with biological functions that appear of direct interest for MScl pathology. Two of these proteins were validated by other techniques as well as in a validation sample set. The lack of statistical power, due to the low number of biological samples available for this study, led to a less than ideal statistical analysis, meaning that the reported p-values may not be directly associated to disease pathology. However, the reported unvalidated proteins are of significant biological interest, and among these are several immunoglobulin proteins, which have been previously reported to be elevated in CSF of MScl patients [18], [19].",

One of the peptides of protein jagged-1 is over three times less abundant in PP MScl and also is observed with a lower incidence in this group (Table 2). Protein jagged-1 is a ligand for multiple Notch receptors and involved in the mediation of Notch signaling, which influences neuronal function and development [20]. The Notch signaling pathway has long been known to influence cell fate in the developing nervous system. Jagged-1 has been found to be highly expressed in hypertrophic astrocytes within and around active MScl plaques lacking remyelination, while, in contrast, there was negligible jagged-1 expression in remyelinated lesions suggesting involvement of the Notch pathway in remyelination in MScl [21]. Later, linkage equilibrium screening implicated a number of genes, including the jagged-1 gene, as susceptibility genes for MScl in a large contingent of Europeans [22]. It has also been suggested that jagged-1 has therapeutic potential in the treatment of CD8+ T cell mediated diseases, due to it's ability to deliver indirect negative signals into CD8+ T cells in vivo\n[23]. Additionally, animal models have shown that elevated expression of Notch and jagged-1 expression does not appear to be a limiting factor in remyelination, but the animal model study reports that there were no quantitative differences in Notch1 expressing cells in slow and rapidly remyelinating lesions, indicating that Notch\u2013Jagged signaling is not a rate-limiting determinant of remyelination in rodent models of demyelination [24]. Additionally immunohistochemistry experiments have shown that constituents of the Notch pathway are expressed in remyelination in an animal model of T-cell- and antibody-mediated CNS demyelination [25]. However, network studies based on the quantitative expression levels of 20 genes in over one hundred individuals identify jagged-1 as a new therapeutic target whose differential behavior in the MScl network was not modified by immunomodulatory therapy, illustrating how network analysis can predict therapeutic targets for immune intervention and identifying the immunomodulatory properties of jagged-1, making it a new therapeutic target for MScl and other autoimmune diseases [26].",

Impaired vitamin D homeostasis has been widely implicated in MScl for some years now [27]\u2013[29]. This vitamin directly and indirectly regulates the differentiation, activation of CD4+ T-lymphocytes and can prevent the development of autoimmune processes [30], [31], and so it may be involved MScl. Considering that the geographic incidence of MScl indicates an increase in MScl with a decrease in sunlight exposure, that vitamin D is produced in the skin by solar or UV irradiation and that high serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D have been reported to correlate with a reduced risk of MScl, a protective role of vitamin D has been suggested [32]. More than 99% of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, the principle circulating metabolite of vitamin D is bound to proteins, of which approximately 90% is bound to vitamin D-binding protein [33], [34]. Recently, a CSF proteomics study showed that serum levels of vitamin D-binding protein were decreased significantly in RR MScl patients compared to other neurological disorders[35]. While our results do not indicate a differential abundance difference between the MScl subtypes and the controls, the two disease types did vary significantly in CSF levels of vitamin D-binding protein, with RR MScl showing a higher abundance. Since a neuroprotective function has been suggested for vitamin D, it may be that in PP MScl this neuroprotective pathway is at least partially deficient, resulting in a significantly more disabling disease manifestation. However, it should not be forgotten that vitamin D-binding protein has pleiotropic functions, beyond vitamin D metabolism. It can significantly enhance the chemotactic response to complement fragment C5a [36], and there are substantial stimulatory effects on macrophages [37]. In light of the increasingly recognized role of innate immunity in the progressive phase of MS pathogenesis [38], vitamin D-binding protein appears an interesting candidate mediator.",

Another seven peptides of this protein were identified among the peak masses in the analysis matrix that had high p-values in the comparison of PP and RR MScl, so it is very likely that the low p-value of the peptide of beta-2-microglobulin reflects high abundant protein variations, suggesting this low p-value is most likely a false positive. In contrast, the other proteins that are differentially abundant in this comparison were either identified by the single peptide listed in Table 2 or by multiple peptides that had low p-values.",

In comparison, most of the other differentially abundant proteins that we identified were found by a small number of peptides with a low p-value or a single peptide with a low p-value. For these proteins we did not observe any other peptides with non-significant p-values, with the exception of bromodomain adjacent to zinc finger domain protein 1A and Rho GTPase-activating protein 18-like. For both of these proteins another peptide was identified with high p-value, indicating these proteins were likely not differentially abundant. The peptides with low p-values of these proteins were also characterized by a low fold increase, making them less interesting for independent immunoassay follow-up.",

            "text": "Because of the healthy state of the CSF control group, no intrathecal inflammatory response was to be expected in this group. Therefore the very clear difference in immunoglobulin abundance in the comparison with the both MScl disease types can be explained. In the two comparisons of both MScl types with the control group, several proteins are present in both comparisons, for example Ig gamma-1 chain C region and apolipoprotein D. Apolipoproteins have been previously implicated in MScl. Proteomics studies have shown apolipoprotein E abundances to be elevated in CSF of MScl patients compared to controls [9], [12]. In the central nervous system apolipoprotein D is a lipocalin that is mainly expressed in glia, but also in neurons. This protein has been repeatedly implicated in MScl, and it has been shown that it has a neuroprotective effect in a number of neurodegenerative diseases by controlling the level of peroxidated lipids, which coincides with glial activation in mouse models of encephalitis [39]. A previous proteomics study showed increased levels of apolipoprotein D in patients with a clinically isolated syndrome of demyelination, indicating that abundance levels of this protein are highest in MScl patients at the time of their first exacerbation [10], [17]. Another potentially interesting protein found to be differentially elevated in the comparisons of both MScl types with the controls is ryanodine receptor 1. This receptor is involved in the maintenance of the calcium-equilibrium in brain tissue. The release of toxic levels of positively charged calcium ions may, due to the deleterious effects of excitotoxicity, represent a key mechanism of axonal degeneration in disorders such as MScl [40].",
