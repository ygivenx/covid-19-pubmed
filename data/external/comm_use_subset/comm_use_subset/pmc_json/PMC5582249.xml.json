            "text": "\nAs the most common autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS), multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating health problem of the CNS which leads to the neurological disability in young adults (1-3). In MS, T cells attack the myelin sheath of the neurons in the CNS, destroying the myelin and the axons (4). The Etiology of MS is unknown, but the most probable theory is based on the molecular mimicry that establishes a number of infections which can activate T cells and initiate the disease\u2019s cascade. In this model, induced auto-aggressive T cells are followed by structural similarity between microbial epitopes and self-peptides. Therefore, Molecular mimicry can break self-tolerance and induce autoimmune responses. In T cell mediated auto-immunities, transfer of activated T cell to the animal models can lead to autoimmunity. It is noteworthy that there are some auto-antigens in the brain including Myelin Basic Protein (MBP), proteolipid protein (PLP), myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG), alpha-beta crystalline, and heat shock proteins that induce T cell reactivity and play a crucial role in commencing MS (5-10).\n",
