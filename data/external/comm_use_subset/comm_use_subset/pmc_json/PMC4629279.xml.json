            "text": "Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreaks are rare and knowledge of the transmission and clinical features of this disease is sparse. As of May 2015, the devastating outbreak in West Africa has resulted in more than ten times the number of cases reported in all previous outbreaks and will ultimately provide improved insights into EVD. Here, for the first time, all the databases from EVD outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) have been cleaned and compiled into one anonymised individual-level dataset (See Supplementary file 1). The data provided are an invaluable addition to the West Africa data and will allow a more complete picture of the disease. The DRC is the country that has experienced the most outbreaks of EVD. Since the virus' discovery in 1976, there have been six major outbreaks (Yambuku 1976, Kikwit 1995, Mweka 2007, Mweka 2008/2009, Isiro 2012, and Boende 2014) and one minor outbreak (Tandala 1977) reported in the DRC, four in the northern Equateur and Orientale provinces and three in the southern provinces of Bandundu and Kasai-Occidental (Figure 1). Some of these have been described in the literature (World Health Organization, 1978; Heymann et al., 1980; Khan et al., 1999; Muyembe-Tamfum et al., 1999, 2012; Maganga et al., 2014). However, the individual-level data and corresponding lessons from these outbreaks have not been collated or made publicly available; by doing so, we aim to permit a more powerful statistical analysis and a fuller understanding of the disease. The end of the most recent outbreak in the DRC was declared on the 21st of November 2014. This provides an unparalleled opportunity to assemble all the information gathered about EVD in the DRC through almost four decades, learn from the Congolese experience with this disease, and compare the features of EVD in DRC with the epidemic that has had such a devastating effect in West Africa.",

It can also be observed that laboratory confirmation became more readily available over time. Across all outbreaks, 57% of cases were female (95% CI = 53.9\u201360.1). In the second Mweka outbreak and in the Isiro outbreak, more than 70% of cases were females. However, in the other outbreaks, the percentage of females was lower (53\u201359%). When comparing the probable and confirmed cases by age with the overall DRC population (Figure 2), we observed a high concentration of cases in the 25\u201364 age category compared to the baseline population. This might be because at this age individuals are more likely to be carers. The occupation was only recorded during three outbreaks: Kikwit, Boende and Isiro. During Kikwit, 23% (73/317) of cases were known healthcare workers (HCWs) and 0.6% (2/317) were possible HCWs. During Boende, the occupation was recorded for 85% (58/68) of cases. 14% (8) were known HCWs and 3% (2) were possible HCWs. During Isiro, occupation was reported for 94% (49/52) of cases. 27% (13) were HCW. Although occupation was not recorded on an individual level, during Yambuku, 13 of the 17 Yambuku Hospital workers contracted EVD (World Health Organization, 1978).",

When it was not, hospitalisation dates were used (5/995). In cases where these were also absent (281/995), the notification dates were used as proxy. For Mweka 2007, the date of infection was mostly based on the notification date (98%), whereas in the other outbreaks, infection dates refer to onset of symptoms almost exclusively (>90%). In time, case definitions became more specific. With the exception of Kikwit, in which notification and the closure of healthcare facilities coincided closely in time, outbreaks seemed to peak before major interventions were initiated.",

Reports of vomiting were also similarly common across all major outbreaks, reported by 75% of cases (95% CI = 69.3\u201379.2) and between 57% and 76% of cases for all major outbreaks. There was considerable variation in how frequently the remaining symptoms were reported for different outbreaks. In particular, hemorrhagic symptoms were present in 61% (95% CI = 51\u201371) of cases during Kikwit but only 10% (95% CI = 5\u201318) during Mweka 2007.

In these settings, the spread of EVD during the first 2 weeks had been high (R > 3). By contrast, in Kikwit 1995, Mweka 2007, and Isiro 2012, where the initial transmission rate was lower, spread of EVD was sustained for more than 13 weeks. Overall, we can see that R declines before the major interventions occurred, which could point to behavioural changes that occurred spontaneously in the populations.",

This represents almost 40 years of surveillance data, seven outbreaks, and 996 suspected, probable, or confirmed cases. It is an invaluable resource for studying the epidemiology and clinical features of EVD. We highlight the importance of reducing the delay between symptom onset and hospitalisation, as the odds of dying increase by 11% per day that a patient is not hospitalised. We also observe higher incidence in those between 25 and 64 years of age and a higher CFR in patients under 5 or over 15 years of age than in those between 5 and 15 years old. These trends mirror those observed during the West African outbreak, where cumulative incidence was highest in those between 16 and 44 years of age and CFR progressively dropped from 89.5% in those under 1 year of age to 52.1% in those between 10 and 15 years, to rise again to 78.7% in those over 45 years old (WHO Ebola Response Team et al., 2015a).

The data presented were originally collected for the containment of the outbreaks rather than for providing the basis of an epidemiological study of the disease. As such, variables are not recorded consistently across all outbreaks and there are missing data. This dataset does not take into consideration undetected cases. A surveillance study carried out in northwestern DRC between 1981 and 1985, through clinical records and serological testing, detected 21 cases likely to be EVD, suggesting that sporadic cases do occur (Jezek et al., 1999). Another serosurvey carried out in Yambuku after the outbreak suggested that that 17% of the population in the village was infected asymptomatically (Breman et al., 1978). Under-reporting may differ between and during outbreaks and may impact the calculated estimates such as CFRs, which limits the validity of direct comparisons of values between outbreaks. Other limitations include the different case definitions employed in different outbreaks and that the method used to calculate the effective reproduction numbers is susceptible to changes in reporting during the outbreak (as most methods are). However, it is robust if the extent of underreporting remains constant during each outbreak. Moreover, it is robust to different reporting sensitivity between outbreaks.",
