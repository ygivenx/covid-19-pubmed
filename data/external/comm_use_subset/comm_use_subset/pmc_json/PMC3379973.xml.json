Since 2003, the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus (AIV) has caused numerous cases of severe disease and death in humans [2]. An influenza pandemic could ensue if this virus developed the capacity to spread easily among humans [3]\u2013[5]. Migratory birds constitute the natural reservoir for AIVs, but chickens may play a key role in the transmission to humans [6]. Epitopes can be used for accurately monitoring immune responses to AIV and for the rational design of protective vaccines. However, only two epitopes from the H5N1 avian influenza A/Vietnam/1194/2004 virus are included in the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resources (IEDB). The majority of T cell and B cell epitopes have been identified in mouse, human, or rabbit hosts. Few epitopes have been described in chicken [7].",

The peptide-binding groove is formed by the \u03b11 and \u03b12 domains. Each domain contributes four strands to an eight -stranded anti-parallel \u03b2-sheet. Two long interrupted helices, one from each domain, pack against the side of this sheet in an orientation directed away from the cell membrane. There is a series of pockets (A\u2013F) along the peptide-binding groove where highly polymorphic amino acids mediate recognition via haplotype-specific associations with antigens and T cell receptors. However, highly conserved residues are found at both ends of the peptide-binding groove that form a network of hydrogen bonds, which directly interact with hydrogen bonds at the peptide\u2019s N-terminus and C-terminus [9]\u2013[11]. Peptides that bind to MHC class I molecules are usually octamers or nonamers, where only one or a few residues can interact with polymorphic residues in the groove. These residues are known as anchor residues when they are found in an anchoring position [12]\u2013[15]. Several public databases and prediction services are available for MHC molecular ligands and peptide motifs, including SYFPEITHI and RANKPEP [16], [17].",

            "text": "Unlike mammalian studies, the majority of investigations of MHC class I molecules in chicken remain limited to primary sequences and the structure of MHC class I molecule from the B21 haplotype was solved only recently [18], [19]. The chicken MHC B system is located on chicken Chromosome 16 (Chr16) and is composed of tightly linked polymorphic regions: BF (class I) and BL (class II\u03b2) and a large family of polymorphic Ig-superfamily (IgSF) genes called BG\u2013the latter sharing sequence similarities with mammalian MHC butyrophilin, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, and TRIM genes [20], [21]. The MHC B\u2013F molecules are structurally and functionally similar to mammalian MHC class I molecules. The two class I genes are known as BF1 and BF2, although the BF2 gene is mainly expressed. The MHC class I (B\u2013F) molecules present antigen peptides to the CD8+ T lymphocytes, which have a central role in the immune system. The MHC class I molecules of different haplotypes have specific peptide-binding tropisms, and B\u2013F-associated peptide-binding motifs have been determined for several haplotypes, including B4, B12, B15, and B19 [22]. Thirteen peptides derived from the v-src gene of the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) Prague strain were predicted to fit the peptide-binding motif of the MHC class I molecules of B12 haplotype and all 13 synthetic peptides actually bound to the BF12 class I molecule in subsequent binding tests [23]. This demonstrates that peptide-binding motifs can be used to predict the antigen peptides presented by chicken MHC class I molecules.",

For the first time, the current study reports the homology modelling structures of the peptide-binding domains of chicken MHC class \u0399 molecules for the B4, B12, B15, and B19 haplotypes. Potential T cell epitopes were predicted by molecular docking of 25 peptides in the H5N1 AIV NP in chicken. NP89\u201397 and NP198\u2013206 were shown to be T cell epitopes of H5 AIV NP by analysing the CD8+ T cell proliferation and the interferon (IFN-\u03b3) expression.

            "text": "Peptide binding to a given class I MHC molecule requires the presence of anchor residues that complement the physicochemical characteristics of the specificity pockets [36]. Anchor residues are usually found at peptide position 2 (P2), where they interact with pocket B, but sometimes at position 5 or 6 (P5 or P6), where they interact with pocket C or E. A C-terminal residue (PC) also typically binds in pocket F [8]. The anchor residues Glu or Asp (P2) in B4 have an electrostatically favourable interaction with the side-chain of the pocket B residue Asp\u03b19, which points up from the \u03b2-sheet. Similarly, anchor residues P2 Arg in B15 and B19 provide an electrostatically favourable interaction with the negatively-charged residues Asp\u03b134 and Glu\u03b162, the side-chains of which point towards the binding groove from the \u03b1-helix. The presence of Glu8 or Asp8 as major residues in the C-terminal position of the B4 motif is unprecedented, and there are no previous mammalian examples of negatively-charged residues in the C-terminal anchor position [16]. It is possible that the positively-charged Arg\u03b180 residue of the F pocket is the key to the binding of anchor residues P8Glu or P8Asp. There is an anchor residue in the central cavity region corresponding to pocket C in B12 and B4. This is very similar to the mammalian MHC class I molecules H-2 Kb and H-2 Db, and it may be related to the Gly\u03b168(69) residue without a side-chain located in the \u03b1-helix (the residue number in parentheses is derived from mammals, whereas that without parentheses is from the chicken). The volumes of the binding grooves in B4 and B12 are 662.45 \u00c53 and 637.677 \u00c53, respectively, which are greater than those of B15 (582.595 \u00c53) and B19 (581.676 \u00c53) (Fig. 5). This may explain why the former have anchor residues in the middle region of their binding peptides. In general, anchor residues point downwards into the binding groove, which allows them to fill the pocket and maintain the stability of the peptide-MHC complex.",

First, this is the first study to determine the structural characteristics of the peptide-binding domains of chicken MHC class I molecules belonging to the B4, B12, B15, and B19 haplotypes using a combined motif-structure method to predict T cell epitopes in chickens.

Thus, there is little information available on the structure and function of chicken MHC class I molecules. Therefore, the current study used homology modelling to investigate the peptide-binding domains of chicken MHC class I molecules belonging to the B4, B12, B15 and B19 haplotypes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to understand the peptide-binding properties of these molecules based on their structures. The assessment indicated that the models were of high quality in terms of their folding and they were suitable for structure-based T cell epitope prediction. The structural characteristics of the peptide-binding properties of these MHC class I molecules were described in the results section. Only four haplotypes with known motifs were selected in this study. However, it is possible to use this solution to predict T cell epitopes of MHC class I molecules belonging to different haplotypes for other antigens in chickens, because the only difference would be the increased number of peptides required for molecular docking.",

Of these peptides, NP89\u201397 (PKKTGGPIY) and NP362\u2013369 (GVQIASNE) are completely conserved in all influenza virus strains, while NP179\u2013186 (AGAAVKGV) is relatively conserved. Some potential epitopes were also shared by several haplotypes. Chickens used for meat and egg production are always heterozygotes, so the identification of these shared T cell epitopes will facilitate the development of broad-spectrum protective vaccines for chickens. Furthermore, epitopes shared by birds and humans are of great importance in the design of rational vaccines for protecting humans and birds from AIV infection.",
