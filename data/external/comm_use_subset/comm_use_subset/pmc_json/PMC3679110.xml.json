In susceptible flocks, this disease can be transmitted by direct contact or indirectly through environmental contamination [2],[3]. It causes significant economic losses in domestic and wild waterfowl as a result of mortality, and decreased egg production [4]. As a major method for controlling this disease, the expanded use of vaccines could bring considerable benefit in reducing infected ducks morbidity and mortality, but sometimes infection could still not be prevented [5],[6],[7].",

Many herbs were investigated for their antiviral activities in our laboratory [8]. Resveratrol, a non-flavonoid polyphenol compound, is a naturally occurring phytoalexin produced by several higher plants such as mulberries, peanuts and grapes in response to stress or injury induced by environmental hazards [9]. This compound has been shown to possess high bioactivities against many diseases, such as cancers, cardiovascular diseases, inflammation, diabetes and viral diseases. In several studies, resveratrol was found to increase the potency of several antiretroviral drugs synergistically against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [10] and herpes simplex viruses (HSV) [11]. Resveratrol was also found to be effective in treating influenza virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARA) [12]. In an in vivo study, 25% resveratrol cream could significantly inhibit the development of HSV-1 induced skin lesions on the abraded epidermis of SKH1 mice, and the therapeutical effect is the same as that of 5% acyclovir cream [13].",

After vigorous shaking, the absorbance values were measured using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad, USA) at 570 nm. The 50% half cell toxicity (CC50) value was calculated as the extract concentration necessary to reduce cell viability by 50%.

In China, the long history of medical usage facilitated the investigation of many traditional Chinese herbal medicinesbecause of their antiviral activities, and a growing number of herbs have been determined for experimental and/or clinical antiviral efficacies [24]. In laboratory previous work, we identified the antiviral activities of 18 kinds of traditional Chinese medicines against DEV and discovered that the crude extract of Rhizoma polygoni cuspidate can inhibit the infection of DEV in DEFs [13]. Resveratrol, one of the main biologically active ingredients of Rhizoma polygoni cuspidate that has been proven to be an efficient agent on several kinds of virus [25],[26],[27],[28],[29],[30],[31],[32],[33],[34], was investigated for its antiviral activity against DEV in this paper. The results indicated that resveratrol effectively reduce the virus titer of DEV in DEFs and protected DEFs from DEV induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1) with the IC50 and SI at 3.85 \u03bcg/mL and 15.86 respectively (Table 1). A high inhibitory effect (>75%) was observed when the concentration of resveratrol was 31.25 \u03bcg/mL.",

In traditional antiviral research, the antiviral activities of test samples were confirmed mainly based on their capability to reduce virus titer or inhibit the CPE. Whether the multiplication of virus particles is influenced is unclear. Real-time FQ-PCR based on TaqMan technology, which was performed in this paper, provides an accurate means to quantify viral DNA. Based on this technology, the amount of the virus in cell cultures could be accurately detected at any point in time. In our research, DEV particles began to reproduce 12 h after inoculation and dramatically increased to a peak value at 48 h p.i. (Fig. 3). The growth curve reported in this paper is almost consistent with the result of Guo's [36]. Thus, the influence of resveratrol on the multiplication of DEV in DEFs was analyzed. DNA proliferation was not detected until 24 h p.i. under treatment with resveratrol and the proliferation was maintained at a low level until the end of the test (Fig. 3). This result indicates that resveratrol could inhibit the stage of virus intracellular proliferations. The conclusion of the growth curve assay was further evidenced by the assays for mode of action. In these series of experiments, resveratrol could not inactivate the virus in extracellular and also did not show any significant inhibitory effect during the stage of attachment and entry into the host cell. The inhibitory effect was only observed in the intracellular inhibition assay (Fig. 4).",

The time of addition study in this paper demonstrated that the resveratrol affected the early stage of the DEV replication cycle (within 8 h p.i.) (Fig. 5). For the alphaherpesvirinae subfamily of herpesviridae, virus replication and package all occur in the host cell's nucleus, in which the genomes of the virus are translated, and some early viral proteins are expressed for further transcription and replication of the viral DNA, then a new virus DNA is synthesized and viral structural proteins are produced; late in the infection, replicated DNAs are packaged into capsids [37]. According to this reference, the early stage of DEV replication might occur in the host cell's nucleus. Thus, we can assume that the process of DEV replication in the host cell's nucleus was inhibited by resveratrol. The TEM photos gave evidence that support the hypothesis that a large number of virus nucleic acids and virus capsids did not observed in the host cell's nucleus compared with the control group (Fig. 6). Similar TEM photos of the DEV infected DEFs were shown in the references [36],[38]. The results of the time of addition assay and the TEM assays locate the antiviral target of the test drug in an early stage of the virus cycle occurs in the host cell's nucleus, which further provide evidence that support the conclusion of the assay on mode of action and further limited the scope of antiviral targets to the host cell's nucleus.",

Galindo et al. reported that resveratrol could inhibit DNA of ASFV replication, late viral protein synthesis and viral factory formation [27]. In our investigation, after incubation for 24 h, protein expression in DEV infected DEFs was effectively inhibited by resveratrol (Fig. 7).
