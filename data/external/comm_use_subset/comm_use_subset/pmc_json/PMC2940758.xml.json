They cause chronic and asymptomatic infections in rodents, and occasional transmission to man may result in life-threatening meningitis and/or hemorrhagic fever. Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) is the prototypic species and first arenavirus isolated in 1933. Because its natural host is the common house mouse (Mus musculus), LCMV is the only known arenavirus presumably exhibiting a worldwide distribution. LCMV is a human pathogen of significant clinical relevance, causing central nervous system disease, congenital malformation, choriomeningitis, and systemic and highly fatal infection in immuno-compromised, organt transplant recipient patients [3], [4], [5], [6]. Humans are generally infected through the respiratory tract after exposure to aerosols, or by direct contact with infectious material.",

            "text": "Arenaviruses are enveloped viruses with a bisegmented negative single-strand RNA genome. Each RNA segment, called large (L; \u223c7.2 kb) and short (S; \u223c3.5 kb), contains two open reading frames in mutually opposite orientations and use an ambisense coding strategy to direct the synthesis of two polypeptides [7]. Between the two open reading frames of each segment resides a non-coding intergenic region (IGR), composed of a sequence predicted to form a stable hairpin structure [8]. The S RNA encodes the viral nucleoprotein (NP; \u223c63 kDa) and glycoprotein precursor (GPC; \u223c75 kDa), whereas the L RNA encodes a small RING finger protein (Z; \u223c11 kDa) and a large protein (L; \u223c250 kDa) which is the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The two RNA genomes are encapsidated by the NP, which is the most abundant protein in virions and infected cells, and act as templates for two fundamentally different processes, RNA replication and transcription. During RNA replication, the L protein first binds to the 3\u2032-end of RNA templates and reads them from end to end to direct the synthesis of encapsidated full-length anti-genomes. During transcription, the RdRp stops RNA synthesis at a pause site located near the IGR [7]. The newly synthesized mRNA molecules have a non-polyadenylated 3\u2032-end with a heterogeneous sequence mapped within the predicted hairpin in the IGR [9]. Furthermore, non template-directed sequences have been identified at the 5\u2032-end of the subgenomic mRNA [10]. These sequences are variable in length [9], [10], [11] and terminate with a 5\u2032-cap structure, which suggests the presence of a cap-snatching mechanism for arenaviruses. In this process, originally described for influenza viruses [12], [13] and bunyaviruses [14], the viral RdRp binds cellular mRNAs caps and \u2018steals\u2019 them using an endonuclease activity, located in the influenza PA subunit [15], [16], and presumably in L protein of bunyaviruses. These short capped RNAs are then used as primers for mRNA synthesis. The arenavirus L protein is an essential element in genome replication and transcription [17]. It is the largest viral protein composed of approximately 2200 amino-acid (aa) residues, and sequence analysis using homologous proteins led to the prediction of several conserved domains [18], [19]. A biological function can be inferred for the L3 domain containing conserved and typical RdRp signature sequence motifs [19], [20]. For Tacaribe virus, both domains L1 and L3 interact with the Z protein [21]. By analogy with influenza and bunyaviruses, the L protein may also carry activities and domains responsible for a cap-snatching mechanism that would account for the sequence diversity found at the 5\u2032-end of RNA transcripts. The expression and purification of such a large viral polymerase is problematic and has not been documented.",

We show that this domain is able to bind nucleotides, with a preference for UTP, and RNA. Structural comparison with the N-terminal part of the influenza virus PA protein characterizes unambiguously the domain as an endonuclease. Sequence and secondary structure analysis of L proteins from various Bunyaviridae family members predict that their N-terminal end carries a similar endonuclease activity, that we demonstrate for Toscana virus (TOSV) (genus Phlebovirus, family Bunyaviridae). Activity assays and mutagenesis show that the arenavirus endonuclease exhibits sequence-specificity with a preference for uracil-containing substrates. Lastly, reverse genetics studies correlate expression of endonuclease activity with the selective production of mRNA, making the N-terminus domain of the L protein a likely candidate to be involved in the cap-snatching mechanism of arenaviruses.",

All four domains were expressed as soluble recombinant proteins. We observed a self-limited proteolysis of the Parana arenavirus N-terminus L domain which prompted us to refine boundaries into a shorter 196 aa form, hereafter named \u201cNL1\u201d, fully included in the previously predicted arenavirus L1 domain (1\u2013250 aa) [19]. The construct was expressed in E.coli and purified, but yielded crystals diffracting to 8 \u00c5. However, the homologous 196 residues domain of LCMV yielded well-diffracting crystals. The atomic structure of NL1 was first determined by the SAD technique with seleno-methionylated crystals that diffracted to 3.4 \u00c5. The structure was refined using a native data set at 2.13 \u00c5 resolution (Table 1). Two NL1 molecules are present within the asymmetric unit. Residues 1\u2013191 are visible for one molecule whilst only 1\u2013175 could be modelled for the other NL1 molecule owing to high mobility of the C-terminal end of helix \u03b17.",

It features four mixed \u03b2-strands forming a twisted plane surrounded by seven \u03b1-helices (Figure 1A). The two anti-parallel strands \u03b21 and \u03b22 are connected by helix \u03b14, whereas the two parallel strands \u03b23 and \u03b24 are connected by the long helix \u03b15.

The PA protein constitutes one subunit that associates with PB1 and PB2 to form the heterotrimeric influenza virus polymerase. Its N-terminal domain PAN hosts the RNA cap-snatching endonuclease activity [15], [16]. Both NL1 and PAN share a similar core structure. Except for the absence of a fifth \u03b2-strand in NL1, all other secondary structure elements are conserved (Figure 1C) and the overall topology of these two structures is very similar (Figure 1D), albeit with interesting differences in the vicinity of the PAN active site (discussed below). At the aa sequence level, NL1 shares the conserved active site sequence motif characteristic of type II endonucleases: PD\u2026(D/E)XK. In NL1, the corresponding residues are P88, D89\u2026E102, and either K115 or K122 (Figure S1A, B). The identity of the distal lysine is not certain since it is found at different positions in the primary sequence, as is the case for influenza virus. The influenza PAN domain was crystallized either in the presence of magnesium or manganese ions in the active site which comprises five conserved catalytic residues: H41, E80, D108, E119 and K134. A structural superimposition of the arenavirus NL1 and influenza PAN active sites shows that the side-chains of three evolutionary-conserved residues within arenaviruses (P88, D89 and E102) closely superimpose with P107, D108 and E119 of the influenza virus PAN protein, pointing to a common function for these residues (Figure 2A and Figure S1B). Upon superimposition with PAN, one Mn2+ ion needed for the enzymatic reaction coordinated by D108 in the PAN active site, falls at right distances to be coordinated by the carboxylate side-chains of D89 and E102. NL1 was crystallized without metal ions and a water molecule is found close to the position that should be occupied by the divalent metal. Interestingly, no close structural match is found neither for H41 nor K134 of the influenza virus PAN. This points to differences between the two active sites since His41 was proposed to play a catalytic role in the influenza PAN. However, we note that another possible contributor could be NL1 C103 main-chain carbonyl as it superimposes quite well with PAN I120 main-chain carbonyl (Figure 2B). The triad made of K115, D119, and K122 in NL1 is spatially equivalent to K134 in PAN. In summary, despite no aa sequence homology, the active site structures of the influenza PAN and LCMV NL1 domains are clearly related but not identical (Figure 1C, 2), strongly suggesting that these two domains exhibit closely related enzymatic activities (see below).",

It contains four genera of animal viruses (Orthobunyavirus, Phlebovirus, Nairovirus, Hantavirus) and one genus of plant virus (Tospovirus) [23]. Although the genomic organisation differs between these three virus families, Bunyaviridae are also thought to use a cap-snatching mechanism to prime mRNA synthesis [24]. Arenaviruses, and Bunyaviridae share a conserved RdRp motif within their large L protein, as well as a conserved N-terminus domain [18]. Amino-acid sequence alignments, assisted by secondary structured prediction, of the N-terminal part of LCMV and Bunyaviridae L protein reveal that the latter also possesses the conserved active site motifs characteristic of type II endonucleases (Figure S2A). However, we could identify the catalytic motif within the L protein N-terminal end for only four out of the five bunyavirus genera: Orthobunyavirus, Phlebovirus, Hantavirus and Tospovirus. The L protein of Nairovirus is much larger (\u223c4000 aa) than the L protein of other members of the Bunyaviridae family (\u223c2200 aa). The putative endonuclease catalytic motif was located after aa \u223c700, the N-terminal of Nairovirus L protein being assigned as a so-called OTU-like domain [25].",

As expected from the sequence alignment, each genus seems to share a \u03b2-sheet with a variable number of \u03b2-strands. Furthermore, the PD catalytic motifs are in each case located in a loop before a \u03b2-strand, as expected. The PUMV, HLCV and RVFV NL1-like domains are more closely related to LCMV NL1 than are the TOMV and CCGV. The TOMV NL1-like domain contains 6 \u03b2-strands and shares the PD motif just upstream the first \u03b2-strand, whereas it is just upstream the second \u03b2-strand in the case of NL1 and PAN. Finally, the structural organization of the putative CCGV endonuclease domain seems to diverge even further from the others. Indeed, whereas the conserved lysine is shared by the same helix for all the domains, that of Nairovirus may be located at the end of the \u03b24 strand (Figure S2B).

The ability of NL1 to bind nucleotides was investigated using UV-crosslink experiments. We observe that NL1 binds NTPs, preferably UTP and GTP, whereas ATP and CTP show a weaker association (Figure 3A). The PAN structures were determined in complex with ATP, CTP and UTP but not GTP [26] whereas NL1 bind GTP in a stronger fashion than ATP or CTP. The crystal structure relatedness to the endonuclease fold would suggest that the NL1 domain is able to bind RNA rather than nucleotides. We tested RNA binding by NL1, and found that indeed, NL1 binds RNA (Figure 3B). The band shift assay is also suggestive that the RNA substrate is cleaved under the assay conditions, as judged by degradation products at the bottom of the gel under the labeled RNA oligo (Figure 3B). Therefore, we surmise that nucleotide binding properties observed here reflect the ability of NL1 to bind RNA with some sequence specificity in the cap-snatching pathway (see below).",

NL1 is able to cleave ssRNA having no stable secondary structure at specific sites indicating a preference for the presence of uracil (Figure 4A, B), and adenosine to a lesser extent. Likewise, a moderately stable RNA hairpin containing uracil (\u0394G = \u22123.4 kcal/mole) is cleaved down to a 14/15-mer product whereas a stable (\u0394G = \u221214.7 kcal/mole) RNA hairpin devoid of uracil remains unattacked even in its single stranded regions (Figure 4A, B). PolyU RNA is cleaved randomly down to a 8-mer product with a better efficiency than polyA, whereas polyC is not a substrate for NL1 (not shown). A 5\u2032-terminal nucleoside uracil or adenosine 5\u2032-monophosphate is also cleaved and the 5\u2032-monophosphate RNA end apparently competes for internal cleavage. A 5\u2032-capped RNA of 264 nucleotides in length also acts as a substrate. It is cleaved at several specific positions indicated by the sequential appearance of band products over time (Figure 4B). This indicates that the cap structure does not seem to be a direct RNA binding determinant. A Phlebovirus (Toscana) virus endonuclease domain was prepared according to bio-informatic predictions described above. Its endonuclease activity was compared to both that of arenavirus NL1 and the influenza H5N1 endonuclease [16]. The enzymes were equally active using short RNA substrates, although it is apparent that sequence-specific cleavage is different for each enzyme: the influenza enzymes prefers cleavage at puric sites, Toscana virus and LCMV enzymes prefer adenosine- and uracil-containing sites (Figure 4B). NL1 is \u223c90-fold more active in the presence of Mn2+ than Mg2+, and shows background activity with Ca2+ and Zn2+(Figure 4C and not shown).

Whereas the active site of influenza virus features a cluster of three acidic residues, the active site of arenavirus contains four acidic residues (E51, D89, E102 and D119), as well as two important lysine residues K115 and K122 neighboring D119 (Figure 2A). The NL1 active site resembles but is clearly distinct from that of influenza PAN. Indeed, there is no histidine in the catalytic center, and the arenavirus NL1 nuclease has some specific features both upstream and downstream of the PD signature sequence. We define the arenavirus endonuclease motif as E-X38-P-D-X(11,13)-E-X12-K-X3-D-X2-K. The most obvious difference with the only known related RNA endonuclease, that of influenza virus PAN, is a divergence upstream the PD motif in structural elements carrying the E51 residue (Figure 1C), and the presence of a triad K\u2026D\u2026K at the distal side of the latter signature sequence (Figure 2A). Contrary to PAN which shares a conserved and essential histidine involved in the binding of both the metal ion and a nucleotide onto helix \u03b13 [15], [16], [26], NL1 does not possess this conserved histidine residue. Instead, NL1 has a glutamic acid residue E51, which might reflect a different nucleobase specificity as detected in our nuclease assays (Figure 4). Likewise, residues downstream the PD motifs are distinct from the consensus sequence, and differently organized into a triad including two lysines. The presence of water molecules and previous structural models for influenza PAN allows to propose putative positions of metal ions, coordinated by D89 and E102.",

Lysine is often considered as this general base candidate in endonucleases but is not strictly conserved [28], [29]. Here, there are no indications against D119 being this general base. Alternately, it could well be either lysine K115 or K122. Both are oriented towards the active site, and they could well have their pKa lowered by D119 in order to initiate the reaction. Reverse genetic studies provide evidence for K122, not K115. Indeed, mRNA production is selectively abolished and clearly uncoupled from RNA synthesis in the case of K122A mutant, while the K115A mutant was completely defective preventing interpretation of its role in the endonuclease catalytic site. Although it is not known if uncapped mRNAs are synthesized and degraded for the transcription-null mutants, the most plausible scenario is that primer shortage prevents significant capped mRNA synthesis. Overall, the replicon data presented here closely match those obtained on the closely related Lassa arenavirus using a similar replicon system [30]. Arenaviruses may thus use two clearly independent and distinct RNA synthesis priming mechanisms: one is dependent on an active endonuclease carried by the N-terminus of the L protein, and the other might be linked to the observation that an extra G residue is found at the 5\u2032-end of arenavirus genomes and antigenomes. The latter G bases would thus reflect a yet-uncharacterized priming mechanism unrelated to the U/A cleavage sequence preference of NL1.",

Thus, we provide evidence that all three segmented negative single-strand RNA virus species share an endonuclease domain probably involved in the cap-snatching process during the viral life cycle. These data raise the question of a possible common ancestor for these viruses. Indeed, these three virus families use a cap-snatching mechanism involving binding and cleavage of cellular mRNA caps subsequently used by a large primer-dependent RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. It seems more plausible that the L gene has evolved by divergence over time, rather than by multiple acquisitions of several activities converging into a common structure, at least in the case of the endonuclease. Furthermore, our study raises the interesting possibility that other activities involved in RNA replication/transcrition might be discovered by comparative analysis of Orthomyxoviridae PB1, PB2, PA and Arenaviridae/Bunyaviridae L proteins.",
