Leptospirosis is acquired mainly through contact with contaminated water or soil containing Leptospira. In some cases, infections may also occur through direct contact with infected animals [4]. Due to non-specific clinical characteristics, leptospirosis often challenging to diagnose leading to underreported incidence which in turn may limit the effectiveness of control programme [5, 6].",

To date, there were more than 2.5 million cases and 20 000 deaths have been reported; more than 80% of the total provinces (34 provinces) have reported leptospirosis cases [7, 8]. Leptospirosis remains a significant public health problem in the country where a broad range of potential reservoirs and serovars are still circulating in the country. Furthermore, rapid population growth, poverty, and industrialization have led to excessive urbanization and environmental changes such as deforestation and urban expansion [9\u201313], which might influence disease nidality through direct impacts on the natural habitat of reservoirs and affects the spillover of infection between wildlife animals, domestic animals, and humans. Also, extreme weather events such as flooding following typhoons may significantly impact impoverish communities with lack of access to safe water and sanitation and health services [6], leading to an increased risk of Leptospira exposures.",

Case information is entered by all healthcare providers at all level via a nationally-standard form into a web-based Notifiable Infectious Diseases Reporting Information System (NIDRIS). In addition, a national system called China Infectious Disease Automated-alert and Response System (CIDARS) have been developed since 2005 to provide real-time outbreak notifications [15, 16]. In term of diagnosis, the provincial branches are responsible for testing suspected human patient and animal sera, collecting infected animals and identifying infectious isolates by culture and microscopic agglutination test (MAT) according to the national diagnostic criteria for leptospirosis issued by the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) [17].

We estimated the DALYs for each year by adding the number of Years of Life Lost due to death in the population (YLLs) and the number of Years Lived with Disability (YLDs) due to the disease [19]. The estimate of YLLs was obtained by multiplying number of cases per year and the standard life expectancy at the age of death in years. To estimate life expectancy at the age of death, we used a standard life table used for the estimation of Global Burden of Disease 2010 [20]. YLDs were calculated by multiplying incidence, disability weight (DW), and duration of the illness. The disability weight used for the estimation of YLDs was the same that used in a study elsewhere [3]. In brief, all death cases were defined as fatal cases. Thus, we were given a DW of 0.573 for one month as it was assumed that they had dialysis before death. For non-fatal cases, we assumed that there were 70% acute cases and 30% had chronic sequelae. Of those acute cases, 50% is mild (given a DW 0.053 for 2 months), 40% is moderate (DW 0.21\u20132 months), and 10% severe (DW 0.562 for 2 weeks, 0.51 for 2 weeks, and 0.21 for 1 month). Of those chronic cases, a DW of 0.245 for two months to three years was given. In our DALYs calculation, we did not consider age-weighting and discounting.",

This finding suggests that China might have reached a low-level leptospirosis transmission similar to other developed countries [27] although this might not indicate a real epidemiological situation as evidenced by the existence of persistent geographical foci of infection that can potentially lead to future outbreaks in the country. Also, we observed marked variation in fatality-rates across regions over time, which may be explained by the heterogeneity the level of awareness and knowledge among populations towards leptospirosis, inadequate measures for early diagnosis and treatment especially during outbreaks, delay in seeking treatment, and severity of illness due to variation to Leptospira exposure and localized risk factors. Hence, more targeted control efforts are needed especially in those high-risk areas and economically less developed areas by enhancing awareness, improving access to safe water and sanitation facilities, and strengthening healthcare and local surveillance systems.",

It is important to consider that epidemiological conditions for leptospirosis transmission and notifications are geographically non-stationary and this approach might be inadequate to capture small-scale heterogeneities. Importantly, that study used published data from 1970s, a period when leptospirosis was highly endemic and when China\u2019s surveillance systems might be different compared to the period of the 2000s. This study extends Torgersen\u2019s [3] study in that we used high-resolution, contemporaneous data based on recent national Chinese disease surveillance systems that have relatively good coverage across the country. This study was successfully demonstrated spatiotemporal heterogeneity in burden within China that was not captured by previous studies. We also identified variation in the surveillance system capacity, as evidenced by the difference in laboratory-confirmed cases among provinces, which means that adjustments should be cautiously applied for the whole country. Applying adjustments to the whole country could be over/underestimated the actual incidence and mortality rates.",

However, it has been confirmed that during 2005\u20132015, there has been no significant change in the surveillance systems, specifically for leptospirosis.

Changes in the landscape, agricultural practices and livestock husbandry, for instance, restriction on livestock herding, farming commercialization, and pigs or livestock vaccination [10, 30] that happened in China could have impacted the transmission rate of leptospirosis in China. Industrialization, for example, has led to significant epidemiological shifts in rural areas through the introduction of agricultural technology and mechanization which might reduce the rate of human exposure to the Leptospira-contaminated environment. Also, we had noticed that there were significant anthropogenic ecological changes following the development of the Three Gorges Dam and the nationwide reforestation programme called \u201cGrain for Green\u201d, which probably had an effect of leptospirosis transmission. Water impoundment in many endemic areas has been known to have an impact on rodents\u2019 habitat and population dynamics of the pathogen in those regions [31, 32]. These projects have also been reported to have had a substantial impact on another rodent- and water-borne diseases, such as hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and schistosomiasis [33\u201335]. However, the role of environmental changes on space-time variation on leptospirosis incidence and burden still needs to be explored. Also, a substantial change in the quality of livestock husbandry in China (e.g., improved waste management and farm biosecurity) might also have contributed to a decrease in transmission rate in livestock [10]. A review of significant changes in the epidemiology of infectious diseases in China, including leptospirosis, has also been described elsewhere [14, 36].",

Interestingly, higher DALYs estimates were identified in economically less-developed provinces in China including Guangxi in Region A and Guizhou and Sichuan in Region B. Guangxi and Guizhou are known to have low Gross Regional Product among provinces in China [18]. High burden estimates in school-aged children may probably be associated with lack of parental supervision because of parental migration from rural to the cities that happened during the last three decades. Lack of parental supervision on preventing their children from unhealthy behaviors and environment may likely increase the risk of pathogenic exposure and children\u2019s health [37]. Additionally, rural migration has shifted labor allocation and participation in families in farming activities, where children, women, and elderly become more active in farming [38, 39] and, therefore, they are more likely to be exposed to Leptospira-contaminated environments. It has been indicated in our findings that 5% of the total cases among farmers were attributed to young farmers (aged under 20 years). Health education and awareness amongst this population group, especially in rural communities is, therefore essential to further reduce the risk in this demographic group. These findings highlight the importance of improving current local surveillance for leptospirosis and health care services for the high-risk populations living in the high-risk areas identified in our study.",

Climate variation notably the increase in temperatures may have driven the spread of Leptospira towards temperate regions in China through its impact on rodent population growth in these areas [40].

It should be noted that the surveillance system in China is mainly a hospital-based, but their laboratory capacity to undertake diagnosis through MAT, ELISA, or PCR is also vary across hospitals over the country. Also, since leptospirosis often presenting a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, more untreated cases or false-negative cases might occur and lead to a high number of underreported and misdiagnosed cases, especially in resource-limited endemic areas. The recent finding indicated the presence of leptospiral infection among patients with undifferentiated fever in Hainan province [41], suggesting that the incidence and burden may be underestimated.

In addition, while in the last five years the incidence has been reported at very low-level, this might not reflect the actual incidence of leptospirosis. Active surveillance studies on acute febrile illnesses are urgently required. Finally, these findings may help to design targeted intervention strategies in China to reduce the burden of human leptospirosis. An evaluation of the role of environment and socioeconomic on the changing leptospirosis epidemiology and burden should be considered in the future works.",
