            "text": "Mammalian reoviruses (MRVs) are prototypical members of the family Reoviridae, which contains segmented double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses of both medical (rotavirus) and economic (bluetongue virus) importance (reviewed in [1]\u2013[3]). These viruses have a segmented dsRNA genome encoding eight structural proteins and three nonstructural proteins [4]. Reoviruses were originally called \u201crespiratory enteric orphan\u201d viruses based on their repeated isolation from the respiratory and enteric tracts of children with asymptomatic illnesses [5]. However, there have been reports describing reoviruses associated with meningitis in infants and children [6]\u2013[8], and with acute respiratory disease in adults [9]. Despite limited reports of severe reovirus infections in humans, pulmonary infection of mice with reovirus serotype 1 strain Lang is a very clinically relevant model of infection-induced acute viral pneumonia leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome, the most severe form of acute lung injury [10]\u2013[13]. In a mouse infection model, reovirus-induced apoptosis is a major determinant of virulence, causing neural and cardiac injury (reviewed in [14]), and mice treated with inhibitors of apoptosis before infection have reduced tissue damage in the central nervous system and heart [15], [16]. Recent studies have indicated that the reovirus outer capsid protein \u03bc1 is the primary factor involved in reovirus-induced apoptosis [17], [18].",

SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was also isolated from the same samples in Vero-E6 cell cultures [19]. Three other reovirus strains, designated BLD, JP, and BYL, were isolated from other SARS patients [20]. We propose that these new reovirus strains be designated \u201cSARS-associated mammalian reovirus\u201d (SARS-MRV). All four SARS-MRV strains were purified by plaque assay and identified as novel members of serotype 2 by sequence analysis of their S1 segments [21]. Genome comparisons showed that BYD1 is a reassortant virus, with its S1 gene segment derived from a previously unidentified serotype 2 isolate and its other nine segments derived from ancestors of homologous serotype 1 and serotype 3 segments [21]. Notably, these SARS-MRVs have been attributed an important role in the etiology of SARS, based on the initial finding of high anti-BYD1 antibody titers in some SARS patients [19] and experimental infections showing that BYD1 can cause SARS-like symptoms in macaques and guinea pigs [22], [23].",

To this end, we found that Hep-2 cells infected with BYD1 undergo different stages of apoptosis, characterized by nuclear and cytoplasmic shrinkage, together with various forms of chromatin margination and condensation, and followed by karyorrhexis and the formation of apoptotic bodies. We show that the ectopically expressed cell-attachment protein \u03c31 and the outer capsid protein \u03bc1 can independently induce infection-like pathological apoptosis in 293 T cells. We also show that suckling mice intracranially inoculated with BYD1 display signs of central nerve damage, myocarditis, and pneumonia. The potential of viral proteins \u03c31 and \u03bc1 to induce apoptosis could be associated with multi-organ injuries in vivo. The findings described here provide new insight into the pathogenesis of SARS-MRV.",

Genetic studies using T1L \u00d7 T3D reassortant reoviruses identified the \u03bc1-encoding M2 gene segment as the primary determinant of strain-specific differences in reovirus-induced apoptosis [25]. The ectopic expression of full-length \u03bc1 indicated that the \u03bc1 protein is essential for apoptosis [17], [18], [26]. As well as the \u03bc1 protein, the \u03c31 protein is also considered to be a determinant of the capacity of reovirus strains to induce apoptosis [27], [28]. However, no similar ectopic study of the \u03c31 protein has been reported. Therefore, we tested the apoptotic potential of both \u03c31 and \u03bc1 in transfected cells. The full-length genes encoding BYD1 \u03c31 and \u03bc1 were cloned into the expression vector pEGFP-C3 fused to the C-terminal of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) sequence. 293 T cells were transfected with vectors expressing GFP alone or the GFP-tagged proteins, and were examined with phase-contrast and fluorescence microscopy. Notably, compared with the control cells transfected with empty vector, 293 T cells transfected with plasmid expressing either GFP\u2013\u03c31 or GFP\u2013\u03bc1 showed clear cytopathic effects, with characteristic cell shrinkage and partial detachment, suggesting apoptosis-inducing roles for GFP\u2013\u03c31 and GFP\u2013\u03bc1 (Figure 2). The apoptotic transfected cells were quantified by flow cytometry. Significant proportions of cells expressing GFP\u2013\u03c31 or GFP\u2013\u03bc1 were apoptotic (Figure 3A). Further electron microscopic analysis at 48 h posttransfection confirmed the presence of ultrastructural changes characteristic of apoptosis in the cells transfected with these two viral genes (Figure 3C\u2013F). Early apoptotic cells with chromatin condensation and late apoptotic cells with ruptured nuclei were observed in the cells expressing GFP\u2013\u03c31 or GFP\u2013\u03bc1. From these data, we conclude that both the \u03c31 and \u03bc1 proteins of BYD1 induce apoptosis.",

To determine whether SARS-MRV infection in suckling mice causes similar diseases, we inoculated suckling mice intracranially with BYD1 or PBS (mock) and monitored the mice for signs of sickness. The mice infected with BYD1 showed symptoms of neurological disease, including heavy breathing, lethargy, and unresponsiveness to external stimulation, at one week postinfection. The mice were then euthanized, and their organs were examined with H&E staining on day 8 following intracranial viral inoculation (Figure 4). A histopathological analysis revealed that the mice infected with BYD1 had signs of central nerve damage, myocarditis, and pneumonia, but no or minor symptoms in the thalamus, renal cortex, distal convoluted tubule, or nephridial tissues. These results suggest a preference of BYD1 for the pallium and hippocampus, and also support the use of suckling mice as a small animal model in which to study the pathogenesis of BYD1. The association between apoptosis and reovirus pathogenesis has been well established in a murine model [32]. Thus, our finding that \u03c31 and \u03bc1 are inducers of apoptosis suggests that the apoptosis induced by these two proteins contributes to the multi-organ lesions in suckling mice.",

The apoptosis of the host cells caused by SARS-CoV has also been suggested to play a pathogenic role [37], [38]. Although the SARS research community has focused on SARS-CoV, we were interested in investigating the pathogenesis of the novel reassortant SARS-MRV. Reovirus is not recognized as an important human pathogen, but significant human diseases have been attributed to reovirus infection (reviewed in [39]). SARS-MRV has been isolated many times from the lung tissues and throat swabs of SARS patients and anti-SARS-MRV antibodies occur in a proportion of SARS patients, which highlights the importance of SARS-MRV in the SARS epidemic [19].

Previous genetic studies have shown that the \u03bc1-encoding M2 gene is linked to strain-specific differences in the apoptosis-inducing capacity of reovirus (reviewed in [14]). Wisniewski et al.\n[18] found that the ectopic expression of reovirus \u03bc1 mimics reovirus-induced apoptosis in terms of the activation of initiator caspases 8 and 9 and the release of cytochrome c and smac/DIABLO from the mitochondrial intermembrane space. However, the same group also found that the ectopic expression of \u03bc1 derived from the relatively nonapoptogenic T1L and apoptogenic T3D reovirus strains induced similar levels of apoptosis. They also showed that the coexpression of \u03c33 with \u03bc1 abrogated the capacity of \u03bc1 to induce apoptosis [17]. Several possible explanations were proposed for this discrepancy [18]. In addition to the M2 gene, the S1 gene encoding attachment protein \u03c31 was also recognized in early studies to be a primary determinant of apoptotic efficiency [27], [28], [40]. The \u03c31 protein is essential for viral attachment and thus for infectivity [41], [42], although the \u03c31 protein of SARS-MRV varies markedly compared to the \u03c31 proteins of other reported strains [21]. Our finding that ectopically expressed \u03bc1 and \u03c31 cause cytopathogenic apoptosis in 293 T cells confirms the previously known function of \u03bc1, and presents a previously unexpected role for cytosolic \u03c31 as an inducer of apoptosis. We conclude that \u03c31-induced apoptosis is probably relevant to the pathogenesis of SARS-MRV infection. Further study of the \u03c31-associated apoptosis pathway should provide novel insight into reovirus-induced apoptosis.",

It should be noted that all our four SARS-MRV strains were isolated from severely affected SARS patients; some SARS patients also experience central nervous symptoms during the course of their illness and that SARS-CoV was isolated from a brain tissue specimen obtained from a SARS patient [43]. Whether SARS-MRV is involved in damaging the CNS of SARS patients has never been examined, but is suspected based on our current understanding of SARS-MRV. The lack of broader clinical investigations on SARS-MRV during the 2003 SARS pandemic hindered us to define a co-pathogenic or synergistic role of SARS-MRV and SARS-CoV.
