A major part of this cost increase is due to losses incurred on drug candidates that fail during clinical development[2]. Failure may be due to adverse events or an inability to detect beneficial effects on the target disease. The reasons why clinical trials fail to demonstrate efficacy of potential novel treatments are many and complex. Failure is often due to the choice of inadequate endpoints, or poor trial design. Good endpoints in clinical trials should fulfill the following two key criteria: i) they should reflect the action of the treatment on the underlying cause of disease, and ii) they should be reliably quantifiable.",

They typically have a short incubation period (a few days) and rapid onset of clinical symptoms. Consequently, patients usually present at clinics after the viral load peak has passed and the infection is already in the decline phase. Only a few measurements of viral load or symptoms can be taken before the infection terminates due to the immunological response of the human host. Using the example of influenza A, we discuss how a quantitative analysis of viral population growth within the patient can help investigators to define more reliable endpoints and improve the assessment of the efficacy of potential novel treatments.",

For example, symptoms may be measured by asking patients how they are feeling, and therefore are at risk of being subjective and at best semi-quantitative[3]. Moreover, symptoms may not accurately reflect the pathologic process targeted by a specific treatment. In the case of influenza A, respiratory and systemic symptoms are not only caused by viral tissue damage, but also by the immune response to the viral infection itself. In severely ill patients with multiple morbidity-inducing conditions, symptom scores may not give any indication of the successful action of a treatment. Influenza treatment may clear the viral infection, but symptoms may persist due to secondary bacterial pneumonia[4].",

Since several pharmaceutical companies are working on novel treatments against influenza A including immunotherapeutic approaches[9], our analysis can inform future trials of potential new influenza treatments. The models are most useful for the planning of phase I studies, but more general conclusions can also be drawn for phase II and III studies.",

The model has been developed from a standard model [11], by assuming that the viral dynamics are much faster than those of infected cells. As we do not have quantitative information on the dynamics of infected cells, this is a sensible assumption that allows us to reduce the number of unknown parameters in the system. The model is general enough to be applicable to other acute viral infections. The analytical properties of this model and the derivation of the infection-related quantities have been discussed elsewhere [10]. In brief, the dynamics of the model are given by the following equations:\ndTdt=\u2212\u03b2TV\ndVdt=r\u03b2TV\u2212\u03b3V\nwhere T is the number of epithelial target cells susceptible to viral infection, V is the viral load (measured in TCID50/ml), \u03b2 is the infection rate of target cells, r is the virus production rate, and \u03b3 is the virus death or clearance rate which encompasses the action of specific and non-specific immune mechanisms. The infection-related quantities that can be derived from this model and their interpretations are listed in Table 1. The analytical expressions of the quantities are given in S1 Table (details in [10]).",

We also calculated pairwise correlations between each of the nine infection-related quantities, and between the infection-related quantities and the area under the curve (AUC) of the total symptom scores and the temperature area under the curves. The latter two quantities measure the total symptom severity and temperature increase over the entire course of infection (the total symptom score AUC is the AUC over all Jackson scores at each measured time point).

Compared to the 95% credible intervals of individual parameter estimates, the variation among patients in the infection-related quantities shown in Table 2 is relatively small. This is not surprising considering that the volunteers in the original challenge study were all young, healthy adults from a narrow age band (18\u201327 years). The greatest variation among individuals occurs in peak viral load (CV = 1.26) and viral load area under the curve (AUC) (CV = 1.19) (see S3 Table for all coefficients of variation.) Temperature significantly correlates with viral load (r = 0.328, p = 0.0025). Total symptom scores also correlate with viral load (r = 0.233, p = 0.03385). When we determined the correlations between infection-related quantities using the Bonferroni correction, the following correlations were significant: R0 and the duration of infection (r = 0.947, pbonferroni = 5.902x10-3), viral load AUC and peak viral load (r = 0.9994, pbonferroni = 7.068x10-10), viral load AUC and late viral decay rate (r = 0.9509, pbonferroni = 4.514x10-3), time to peak viral load and generation time (r = 0.9644, pbonferroni = 1.487x10-3), time to peak viral load and initial viral growth rate (r = -0.9459, pbonferroni = 3.384x10-3), and peak viral load and late viral decay rate (r = 0.9601, pbonferroni = 2.212x10-3).

As some viral strains may disseminate faster through infected tissue than others, infection by such strains may be associated with higher R0 values. Moreover, some of the earlier studies consider a latent infection stage which can increase estimates of R0. We did not consider a latent stage, as the data did not contain enough information to justify additional parameters.",

Consequently, the measured viral decay rate is much lower than inside the human host (provided he or she is not immunosuppressed). It should be possible to culture virus and add serum taken at different times post infection from previously infected individuals to the culture medium. This would give independent and more realistic estimates of the virus decay rate in its natural environment.",
