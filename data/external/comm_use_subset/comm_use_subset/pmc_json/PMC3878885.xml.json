The results will highlight the usefulness of phylogeography for public health surveillance and the analysis of disease transmission within the country. In addition, we discuss implications for future spread of the disease between animals and humans in Egypt. The current endemic situation continues to be a major challenge to the poultry industry and regulatory authorities in Egypt. Understanding the epidemiology of the disease is a key element in HPAI control. It is essential to link this knowledge with action to effectively limit the spread of the virus. An understanding of the \u201cusual\u201d patterns of geo-movements of the disease leads to a better understanding of disease pathways and spread. This in turn allows for planning strategies to reduce risks, set priorities, allocate resources effectively and efficiently, and achieve higher benefit-cost ratios with existing or minimal resources\n[25].",

Al Qalyubiyah and Ash Sharqiyah are governorates characterized by high poultry flock densities with a mean value of more than 8 flocks/km2[28]. About 80% of broiler farms apply some degree of vaccination protocol\n[29] which limits the probability of virus detection. Meanwhile, Cairo is generally considered as the biggest market for live birds in the country and for importation of birds from Delta governorates. LBMs and poultry shops are important sources for the purchase and trading of birds in Cairo and other parts of Egypt. Due to a cultural preference to consume freshly slaughtered poultry, LBMs and poultry shops absorb about 80% of the total commercially produced poultry in the country\n[30]. LBMs, which are considered to be a continuing source of influenza because of the dense concentration and high rate of live bird turn-over, provide ample conditions for virus amplification and may therefore be important reservoirs for HPAI strains from neighboring governorates and \u201chubs\u201d of circulation\n[31]. Al Qalyubiyah alone produces about 69 percent of the native Baladi chicken and is considered a center for production and trading of fertile Baladi eggs that are often taken and hatched in southern governorates such as Sohag. Southern governorates like Al Uqsur purchase either day-old birds such as Peking ducklings and Baladi chicks or fertile eggs from Delta governorates of Al Qalyubiyah, Ash Sharqiyah and Gharbiyah\n[32]. Sharqiyah is the main source for fertile eggs and day-old Peking and Baladi birds for other governorates. Thus, Cairo\u2019s LBMs are linked to Al Qalyubiyah and Ash Sharqiyah farms that are also the main sources of fertile eggs and day old birds for southern governorates.",

Both models indicated weak support for Ash Sharqiyah as the origin of the spread. However, there were differences about significant dispersion routes. These discrepancies are potentially the result of reassortment in the influenza genome, differences in the size of the two data sets, or due to the Bayesian phylogeographic models themselves. Related to this, another limitation is that we did not compare other approaches of molecular evolution including maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony. Our purely discrete model has limitations including inferring the migration paths by only considering the observed locations. For example, removing a state that was observed only once in both data sets would remove it completely from the model and would thus not be considered in the migration history. Hence, these findings are based on a closed system of locales and genetic samples and may not provide a complete representation of influenza diffusion within Egypt.",

We analyzed one model for each and both indicated Ash Sharqiyah as the origin of the spread although the statistical support was weak. We also identified the routes between governorates that had strong statistical support. The majority of these were found in the heavily populated Delta region. In particular, the Al Qalyubiyah governorate appears to represent a popular location for virus transition as it represented a large portion of branches in both trees. However, there remains uncertainty about virus dispersion to and from this location and thus more research needs to be conducted in order to examine this.",

We set the length of the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) run to 20 million for NA and 40 million for the larger HA dataset; sampling every 1,000 steps. We compared models by estimating the log marginal likelihood values via the Bayes Factor test using the Tracer program\n[43].
