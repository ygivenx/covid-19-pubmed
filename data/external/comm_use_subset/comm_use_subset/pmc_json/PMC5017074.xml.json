Once a person has been infected, he or she is likely to be protected from future infections. In addition, recently it was found that persons can catch infection through person to person transmission.6Time The breading season of Ae. mosquitoes is usually during warm and rainy seasons in tropics and subtropics. The mosquito usually bite during the day times (after sunrise and before sunset).6Place ZIKV was first isolated from Rhesus monkey in Zika Forest of Uganda, 1947. ZIKV was known to infect humans from Uganda and Nigeria based on serological surveys during 1952. Sporadic human cases were reported then from some African countries and Indonesia at the end of the 70\u2019s. Epidemic was described in the Pacific in 2007 and 2013 (Yap and French Polynesia, respectively), and Cook Island and New Caledonia in 2014.7 During May 2015, the WHO notified the first local transmission of ZIKV in the Americas, with circulation in Brazil.8 Then the epidemic spread to other parts of South and North America and several islands in the Pacific. Since then, millions of infected individuals have been identified in Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela and other countries in the Americas.9 WHO reported on May 2016 that 60 countries and territories (mostly in Central and Latin Americas) have continuing mosquito-borne transmission. It was found that 46 countries are experiencing a first outbreak of Zika virus since 2015, with no previous evidence of circulation, and with ongoing transmission by mosquitoes. Another 14 countries reported evidence of Zika virus transmission between 2007 and 2014, with ongoing transmission.6 In the USA, it was reported that higher poverty rates of inhabitants in cities along the U.S.-Mexico border may be associated with increasing person exposure to Aedes aegypti.10 Millions of other new cases are expected to occur within the next 12 months.9\n",

Before the current pandemic began in 2007, Zika rarely caused recognized \u2018spillover\u2019 infections in humans, even in highly enzootic areas. In the current pandemic, human is a host of ZIKV and local transmission between human has been reported in many countries and territories 6,12,13 Zika antibodies were detected also in ducks, goats, cows, horses, bats, and carabaos.13 The vector reservoir host is Aedes mosquitoes.6Environment\nAe. aegypti and albopictus live and lay eggs in the stagnant water collections and water-holding containers (as puddles, buckets, empty cans) around the households. Example of such areas are the peri-domestic areas with absent of the piped water provision; as in the slums in tropics and subtropics. This need warm and rainy season of the tropics and sub-tropics.7,13\n",

It was suggested also that ZIKV can be transmitted through breast feeding.18 ZIKV infection is suggested to cause also abortion and miscarriage.17Blood-borne transfusion Given that the majority of cases with ZIKV infection are asymptomatic, and among them are some blood donors, transmission of ZIKV via blood transfusion is suggested during acute phase of infection.7On the other hand, other modes of transmission as saliva are still under studies.14\n",

There are claims and counter-claims about the suggested cancellation of these big occasions, after the big budget spent for preparing such events. Some countries have expressed fear about attending the MG events.7 However, the Brazilians\u2019 officials said that among the factors that may decrease this phobia is that August is in the dry season, with less incidence of the mosquito that usually lays its eggs on stagnant water. Furthermore, Brazil is making efforts now in their war for controlling the mosquito and ZIKV before the big sport occasions, and similar upcoming occasions.",

            "text": "\nHealth education All international airports and ports need to display educational materials for travelers about ZIKV, and how to avoid infection.27 In the heavily infected countries, Ministries of Health need to spread ZIKV information in streets and through media. It can include information in televised press, video-conferences and through social media (Twitter, Face book, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter podcasts, etc.). The CDC currently distributes ZIKV updated educational information through social media; and this can help travellers and local inhabitants from epidemic areas to avoid infection.27 Micro-websites with detailed information about ZIKV infection are established as the \u201cCDC Zika Travel Information\u201d website\u201d.27 This will educate the public about how to remove, destroy and manage mosquito vector larval hebetates (stagnant want), and how prevent infection by avoiding mosquito bites (mosquito nets and repellent).14Intensifying epidemiological surveillance It should be done with training of trainers on \u201cpreparedness and control of ZIKV and other emerging infectious diseases\u201d. Training can be of different types of surveillance including routine, passive, active, environmental (Geographic Information System \u201cGIS\u201d for Ae mosquito breeding sites), sentinel, syndromic, laboratory and electronic surveillance. An Alert surveillance system for ZIKV will lead to immediate notification of the discovered cases, accurate determination of the magnitude of the problem and the high risk groups and hence application of preventive and control measures.2,28 These epidemiological measures are urgently needed for all countries infested with Aedes mosquito, especially in countries which will host big MGs as Brazil (with rapidly circulating ZIKV infection and heavy infestation with Aedes mosquito).29Developing and monitoring global MG-specific integrated surveillance and alert systems:29 These measures are needed for ZIKV and other emerging infectious diseases. Success of such MG surveillance system will help to monitor the circulation of ZIKV in the host, and home countries (with varying capacity and resources of these countries). 28 Development and assessment of models for integrated risk management for local and international mass gatherings (MGs) is also required.29Establishment and maintaining of \u201cZika Active Pregnancy Surveillance System\u201d and prevention of perinatal transmission This surveillance need to be done in all countries with the circulating virus. ZIKV-infected pregnant females and their offspring need to be monitored for discovering any adverse maternal, fetal, neonatal, infant, and child health outcomes.30 Females from infected areas can post-pone pregnancy until more is known about relation of ZIKV to infants\u2019 microcephaly, abortion and miscarriage. Testing is recommended at the start of antenatal care, with follow-up testing for asymptomatic pregnant women in infected areas with ZIKV.30,31 Furthermore, males who have a pregnant wife who live in or lately traveled to an active ZIKV transmission country need to abstain from sex or use condoms, during the pregnancy.17Establishment and maintaining Travel Medicine Persons with immunodeficiency, severe chronic illnesses, and pregnant females, who plan to travel to the areas with transmission of ZIKV, need to discuss their travel plans with their physicians. They need to consider postponing their traveling to the areas with increasing or widespread transmission.20 In case that travelers are returning from affected areas, they need to report their suffering from any febrile illness, and need to be examined at airport (thermal Cameras).14Personal Protection According to CDC recommendations, persons residing in or traveling to countries with active ZIKV transmission should prevent infection through prevention of mosquito bites. This can be done by wearing long-sleeved cloths, staying in places with air conditioning, using mosquito nets, mosquito repellents and treating clothing with insecticides.28 Anyone who has Zika infection should avoid mosquito bites during the first week of illness to protect others from getting sick through this mosquito.Environmental sanitation:\nPermanent elimination of water containers by maintaining adequate supplies of piped water.28Larvicides: chemicals or biological control to prevent the development of mosquito stages.28Chemical control: for adult mosquitoes by space, residual and barrier spraying, and attractive toxic baits.28Physical control (non-insecticidal mosquito traps): Gravid female mosquitoes can be attracted to traps baited with oviposition medium and captured using sticky glue while attempting to lay eggs. Use GIS and ovitrap can control the mosquito and decrease ovum.28,32\nTreatment Until now there is no specific treatment, sero- prophylaxis, or chemo-prophylaxis for ZIKV. Symptomatic treatment can be done by adequate rest, sufficient fluids, medication to reduce fever and pain (as acetaminophen). Patients should avoid aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.31Disinfections WHO has recommended using aircraft disinfestations insecticides.34Financial support and commitment It will be critical for controlling ZIKV and enhancing alertness of the surveillance system. Today, nearly two billion dollars has been requested from the U.S. Federal government to combat the exploding ZIKV pandemic.Multidisciplinary international cooperation is required for controlling ZIKV epidemic. At national levels, especially in the countries infested with Aedes mosquito, cooperation is needed between governmental health, private sector, agriculture, natural resources, education, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and others to control mosquito vector.33Future vaccination Until now, there is no vaccine against ZIKV. Various companies and educational institutes are now trying different vaccine approaches, as inactivated virus, virus-like particles, nucleic acid based vaccines, live vectored vaccines, subunit vaccines, and live recombinant approaches. Most of these are in preclinical trial development and many are expected to enter Phase I clinical trial in 2017.35Intensifying compulsory vaccination against yellow fever This is needed for travelers to areas infested with Aedes Aegypti mosquito, especially for Brazil during the upcoming sport MGs.Control measures are needed for similar Arbovirus as dengue, yellow fever, and Chikungunya.Research and development of new products: Examples of such products are those for rapid diagnosis, vaccines and therapeutic interventions.\n",
