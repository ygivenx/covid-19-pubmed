It spread through direct contact with infected individuals, or by touching the blood, organs, bodily secretions and fluids, or the contaminated clothes of such people (MacNeil and Rollin, 2012). Because the initial symptoms of ebolavirus infection can be confused with those of other febrile illnesses such as endemic malaria (Chertow et al., 2014), and because the infection cannot be detected rapidly in patients living in remote areas (World Health Organization [WHO], 2014)1, the numbers of infected people and deaths were the highest yet recorded. To control infection and to prevent further transmission during outbreaks of filoviruses such as EBOV, rapid detection is therefore essential (Grolla et al., 2005).",

In general, when the EBOV viral load in the blood gets to a higher case fatality rate, the detection of antigens as a suitable method is used for laboratory diagnosis (Fisher-Hoch et al., 1992; Ksiazek et al., 1999b). Thus, the World Health Organization recommends real-time RT-PCR as the first choice for EBOV diagnosis. However, inhibitors present in crude biological samples can inactivate the Taq DNA polymerase used in PCR-based techniques (de Franchis et al., 1988). Moreover, these methods are relatively complex and require specialized instruments. Thus, to complement PCR-based methods, another rapid, simple, and effective assay is needed.",

(2000) which relies on autocycling strand displacement DNA synthesis. This novel method is highly specific and sensitive, takes advantage of four or six specific primers to recognize six or eight different sequences of the target gene, and is performed under isothermal conditions in less than 1 h using Bst DNA polymerase. Furthermore, LAMP is less influenced by inhibitors present in complex samples than standard PCR, which is highly beneficial for clinical specimens such as blood components, sputum, feces, or body fluids (Kaneko et al., 2007). LAMP assays have been widely applied to genetic diagnoses, the detection of epidemic bacteria (Hara-Kudo et al., 2005; Song et al., 2005) and viruses (Okafuji et al., 2005), fetal sex identification (Hirayama et al., 2013), and parasite recognition (Chen et al., 2011; Kong et al., 2012).",
