Sequencing was performed initially with the Illumina HiSeq 2000 system using HiSeq version 3 sequencing reagents. Some additional data were generated using the Genome Analyzer IIx system using GA version 5 sequencing reagents to supplement the number of reads up to a minimum level for all libraries. The libraries were clonally amplified on a cluster generation station using Illumina HiSeq version 3 and GA version 4 cluster generation reagents to achieve a target density of approximately 700,000/mm2 in a single channel of a flow cell. Image analysis, base calling, and error estimation were performed using Illumina Analysis Pipeline (version 2.8).

Single-exon transcripts were oriented to positive strand or negative strand, depending on which strand resulted in higher read counts.

Time-matched lung samples from mock-infected animals were also collected, resulting in a total of 124 lung samples. Total RNA was then sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq with a stranded library preparation protocol that generated 2 \u00d7 100 nt paired-ends reads. Each sample was ensured to have at least 30 million reads and, on average, there were 48 million reads per sample. We then verified the sequence quality and filtered out ribosomal RNA reads and viral reads. The viral read counts varied among the founder strains, suggesting that the genotypes of the animals had an effect on viral loads in the lung (Supporting Information, Figure S1). Some strains, such as 129S1/SvImJ and CAST/EiJ, had high levels of MA15 RNA on day 4 after infection whereas others, such as NZO/HILtJ and NOD/ShiLtJ, had low levels of MA15 RNA (Figure S2). Strain-dependent variations in viral RNA levels were also observed in PR8-infected mice, although the pattern of high vs. low viral RNA levels was not necessarily the same. For example, although NOD/ShiLtJ mice had lower levels of MA15 RNA than did the other mouse strains on day 4, the inverse was true for PR8 RNA levels in this strain (Figure S2). The pattern of viral read-counts for PR8 can be well-explained by Mx1 alleles in the eight founders (Ferris et al. 2013).",

Indiscriminately using the reference annotation in CC transcriptome studies could bias results and lead to inaccurate conclusions. In addition, the advent of RNA-seq has led to large discoveries of novel transcripts (ENCODE Project Consortium et al. 2012). Therefore, we built a custom bioinformatics pipeline (Figure S5) for novel transcript discovery. We based our pipeline on the popular novel transcript discovery programs, Cufflinks (Trapnell et al. 2012) and Trinity (Grabherr et al. 2011), with the former for genome-based transcript discovery and the latter for de novo assembly of transcripts not based on genomes. The pipeline accounted for the genetic variations of the founders\u2019 genomes compared with the reference genome, on which the reference annotation is built, by mapping transcripts in the reference annotation to pseudogenomes (Huang et al. 2013). The mapped transcripts were used in place of the reference annotation. Because we had total RNA data, we focused on novel intergenic transcripts and filtered novel transcripts by comparing them against known transcripts. Additional filtering steps were required for de novo assembled transcripts to exclude false positives, so we mapped them against viral and ribosomal sequences and compared them with all known mouse, human, and rat ESTs and clones using BLAST. We also required all novel transcripts to be at least 200 bp long.",

C57BL/6J had the fewest (20887) new transcripts because the reference annotation is based on this strain and therefore is the most complete. We also observed that NOD/ShiLtJ mice had 30695 new transcripts and that all other strains had more new intergenic transcripts than C57BL/6J (Figure S6A). Surprisingly, wild-derived strains did not have more new transcripts than laboratory strains (except C57BL/6J), although overall differences in the numbers of novel transcripts among the other seven strains were not large. This could be due, in part, to the imperfect state of founder pseudogenomes, which are rooted in the reference genome and thus may not accurately describe the genomes of the other seven strains. This is particularly problematic for the wild-derived strains, whose genomes are more divergent from C57BL/6J. When we plotted the density of the novel transcripts onto mouse genomes, we found that although novel transcripts were spread throughout the eight genomes, they did cluster around certain locations (Figure 1). To further investigate this phenomenon, we zoomed-in on chromosome 2 (Figure 2A). The clustering patterns were remarkably consistent between founders, further validating the presence of these novel transcripts (Figure 2A). However, not all locations were identical for the eight founders; some regions showed clear differences between the wild-derived strains and the classical laboratory strains. One such region is found between 45.05 Mb and 45.2 Mb on chromosome 2, where the wild-derived strains tended to have shorter and fewer novel transcripts than the laboratory strains, as illustrated by Figure 2B. This observation led us to cluster the founder strains based on the novel transcript density of chromosome 2. The resulting similarity distance showed that the wild-derived strains were more distant from the laboratory strains, with the WSB/EiJ strain being the most closely related to the laboratory strains (Figure S6B). This observation is similar to that of a previous phylogenetic characterization of inbred mouse strains (Yang et al. 2007).",

There were considerably more transcripts in 129S1/SvImJ, WSB/EiJ, CAST/EiJ, and NOD/ShiLtJ mice on day 4 after PR8 infection than on day 4 after MA15 infection, and significantly more new transcripts in 129S1/SvImJ, WSB/EiJ, and CAST/EiJ mice on day 4 after PR8 infection than on day 2 after PR8 infection. The pattern of strain variation with regard to the number of novel DE transcripts was similar to the pattern shown by known DE genes. We present an example of a novel DE transcript in Figure 3B.

A genome browser view of one QTL region, HrI3, is shown in Figure S7. The QTL study used PR8 virus and pre-CC mice, mice that are descendants of the founders in the current study and therefore are particularly relevant. First, we used linear regression to choose novel transcripts associated with weight loss; after multiple-testing correction, we obtained three significant novel transcripts. The three novel transcripts fall into regions previously associated with mouse body weight, pulmonary edema, or airway neutrophils of the mouse response to PR8 and their expression levels have further been associated with weight loss, an indicator of morbidity. Two of these transcripts were found in PWK/PhJ mice and the third transcript was found in C67BL/6J mice. When we used linear regression to characterize the functional roles of the three novel transcripts by associating their expression levels with those of annotated genes, one transcript in PWK/PhJ mice failed to significantly associate with any genes, but the other two transcripts were associated with many. These transcripts included XLOC_000093 in PWK/PhJ mice on chromosome 1 between 21.7 Mb and 29 Mb and XLOC_008559 in C57BL/6J mice on chromosome 15 between 77.4 Mb and 86.6 Mb. By using a cut-off value of 10\u22125 as the threshold, we identified more than 200 annotated genes that associated with these two novel transcripts. When we used IPA functional analysis to associate annotated genes with their predicted biological functions, we found that genes associated with XLOC_000093 were associated with TREM1 signaling, B cell receptor signaling, and NF-\u03baB activation. Given the fact that these novel transcripts are within a QTL region associated with the host response to PR8, are highly associated with weight loss after infection, and are associated with many important immune genes, it is likely that they have a functional role in the host response to viral infection.",

We took a conservative approach to mapping these transcripts to minimize false positives. First, we selected the parts of the output from Trinity that did not map to pseudogenomes or the reference genome. We then filtered the data by first removing transcripts mapped to viral and ribosomal genomes, then by retaining only those transcripts that aligned to known human, rat, and mouse sequences (ESTs or DNA clones), and finally by requiring a minimum length of 200 bp per transcript. A summary of the remaining de novo transcripts is presented in Figure 4A. Because both the reference annotation and the reference genome are based on samples from the C57BL/6J strain, it is no surprise that C57BL/6J had the fewest de novo transcripts among all the founders. However, it is somewhat surprising that there were \u223c600 de novo transcripts in this strain. On average, the laboratory strains (A/J, 129S1/SvImJ, C57BL/6J, NOD/ShiLtJ, NZO/HILtJ) had fewer de novo transcripts than the wild-derived strains (CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhJ, WSB/EiJ), reflecting the greater genomic difference between the wild-derived strains and C57BL/6J. Some of the de novo transcripts were more than 1000 bp long, with the transcripts shown in Figure 4B being prominent examples. These transcripts have very low similarity to the reference genome and pseudogenomes but could be mapped to both rat and human genomes with coverage approximately 70% or more. Interestingly, these transcripts could also be mapped to a lesser known mouse genome assembly called Mm_Celera (Mural et al. 2002), which was generated by Celera genomics based on multiple mouse strains. One prominent example is the de novo transcripts that spanned multiple conserved exons of the gene Spata5l1 and aligned well with respective exons of human and rat genomes (Figure 4B). These data provide strong evidence that the existing reference genomes and various pseudogenomes have gaps within well-known coding genes.",

One is through distant regulation, by changing the expression of transcription factors or their affinity for distant promoters. The other is by changing local sequences such as spliceosome binding sites or intron\u2013exon boundaries. While genetic variation was an obvious source of splicing variations, it was not clear whether differential expression was due to distant regulation or direct sequence alteration of local sites. Distant regulators are difficult to ascertain without a full genetic study, but local sequence variations could be assessed with our dataset. We therefore compared our list of DE splice junctions with published genetic variations obtained through a next-generation sequencing project (Keane et al. 2011) and extracted DE isoforms with genetic variations within 2 bp of their intron\u2013exon boundaries. Because of the proximity of these genetic variations to intron\u2013exon boundaries, this subset of DE isoforms is likely the result of cis-regulated gene expression. One example is found in the Atp5f1 gene (Figure 5A). Atp5f1 is an ATP synthase and transport gene that has been linked to hepatitis B infection (Lee et al. 2008). This gene, although not differentially expressed overall, had two splice junctions showing elevated expression in samples from PR8-infected WSB/EiJ mice on day 4 after infection. Furthermore, there was a SNP (rs33689100) at 105758959 on chromosome 3 that was within 2 bp of an intron\u2013exon boundary. Another example was the Tdrd3 gene, which showed differential isoform expression in CAST/EiJ mice on day 2 after MA15 infection. This gene has been linked to stress granules, which are co-opted by several viruses during replication (Lloyd 2013). At 87886156 on chromosome 14, there was an insertion (rs234605399) within 2 bp of an intron\u2013exon boundary, likely causing the splice junction spanning that position to be differentially expressed (Figure 5B). The splice junction neighboring rs234605399 had far fewer reads in samples from virus-infected animals, although the overall gene expression was similar for all samples.",

Although it was clear that genetic differences drove the strain-specific expression patterns that were described above, it was unclear whether this was by indirect genetic regulation or by direct genome sequence changes. Examples of direct sequence alteration include premature transcriptional stops and reduced transcription factor\u2013binding affinity. To tease apart these sources of distinct expression patterns and their likely functional roles, we first separated the DE genes into three groups: those not expressed in all the samples of one mouse strain (group A); those expressed in all strains (group B); and the remainder. In other words, group A genes were differentially expressed during virus infection for at least one strain but were not expressed for another strain for all time points and all viruses (Figure 7A). This group includes genes with extreme expression difference between strains. We used group A gene expression levels to cluster all founder strains and discovered that the resulting similarity graph (Figure 7B) resembled the phylogenetic tree based on genetic variations (Yang et al. 2007). Using the remaining DE genes, or all DE genes, did not yield the same similarity graph. This suggests that genome sequence variations between founders had a large and immediate impact on the expression of these genes. The genome sequence variation driving selective expression of these genes is likely nearby in upstream binding sites or promoters, which are different between strains because of SNPs, small indels, or structural variations. In extreme cases, whole genes may be deleted in certain strains. Although genetic regulation is always a factor in gene expression, for these genes, expression differences between founder strains may be more directly explained by genome sequence variations within or near those genes.",

            "text": "We further divided the DE genes belonging to group B into two categories using median absolute deviation (MAD) of log-fold change as the metric. If a gene had a MAD score less than 0.1 within a unique combination of time point and virus, then it was considered a consistently expressed gene (Figure 8A); if the MAD score was more than 1, then it was considered a gene with highly variable expression (Figure 8B). Consistently expressed genes included genes that were similarly expressed across all eight founders, whereas genes with highly variable expression between strains are likely to be ultimately responsible for differing phenotypes. This is a further gradation of genes with strain-specific expression patterns; the highly variable genes have strain-specific pattern, but the stably expressed genes do not. Interestingly, of four combinations, PR8 vs. MA15 at day 2 or day 4 after infection, consistently expressed genes did not overlap among different viruses and time points, and neither did genes with highly variable expression (not shown). This suggests a tightly controlled host-response program in response to infection. The expression patterns shown in Figure 8, A and B have 445 consistently expressed genes and 835 genes with highly variable expression. When we looked for pathway enrichment using GO terms, we found the consistently expressed genes were dominated by general biological processes and cellular functions, with low enrichment of immune functions or pathways. The top 10 enriched pathways for consistently expressed genes are in Table 1. There, only one pathway, pro-B-cell differentiation biological process, was related to immune function. The opposite was true for genes with highly variable expression, whose GO terms were predominantly immune functions such as innate immune system and interferon stimulation. The top 10 enriched pathways are listed in Table 2. Functional enrichment of immune functions remained high regardless of whether all known genes or just the DE genes were used as the background, so the high functional enrichment of genes with highly variable expression was not confounded by the enrichment of DE genes in immune functions. It is possible that consistently expressed genes are largely responsible for maintaining basic biological functions, whereas genes with highly variable expression between strains are responsible for the manifestation of different host responses.",

Interferon-\u03b3 has been shown to protect mice from influenza virus if administrated at an early stage of infection (Sainz et al. 2004; Weiss et al. 2010), and genetic variation within the IFNG gene has been linked to SARS in humans (Chong et al. 2006). IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that is linked to influenza recovery (McKinstry et al. 2009) and the effectiveness of SARS treatment (Ng et al. 2004). Its expression can also predict patient survival among people infected with emergent H7N9 virus (Wang et al. 2013). Given their pivotal role in fighting IAV and SARS, it was intriguing that these genes showed strain-specific differential expression. Among mice infected with PR8 at day 2 after infection, IFNG was only expressed in C57BL/6J, CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhJ, and WSB/EiJ, whereas it was expressed in all strains except CAST/EiJ on day 4 after infection. A recent article also reported an absence of IFNG expression in the lungs of CAST/EiJ mice (Earl et al. 2012).

Even though C57BL/6J is the reference strain, we nevertheless found hundreds of missing sequences and tens of thousands of intergenic transcripts in this strain. The other seven strains had even more novel features. It is likely that many of the intergenic transcripts were the extended fragments of known genes, or that multiple new transcripts came from one new gene, so that the total numbers of novel transcripts are lower than estimated. However, the existence of large numbers of unannotated or extended genes is undoubtedly real in the mouse as well as other species. The implication of incomplete reference genome and annotation for QTL and eQTL studies is substantial. Although the transcriptome data presented here will help overcome these shortcomings in mouse studies, the concern remains for other systems, such as human GWAS. The potential pitfalls of incomplete genomes were illustrated by the example of Spata5l1, which had multiple exons missing in all eight strains. For studies of genetic control of transcription, our results can help by pointing out potentially incomplete gene models in the reference annotation and can also help complete the mouse annotation with new intergenic transcripts. Our results have particular relevance for viral infection studies, particularly respiratory viruses, as these new transcripts in lung may have functional roles, as evidenced by their differential expression in response to infection.",

This phenomenon may be due, in part, to immune cell infiltration. It is possible that the genes with strain-specific expression are genes that are expressed by different infiltrating cell populations, which may vary between the founders, whereas the nonstrain-specific genes are not active in infiltrating cells. An alternative explanation is that gene expression changes that were not strain-specific are so fundamentally important to mouse survival that they are similarly regulated in all founders. Further study of a variety of CC lines and/or by cell sorting and cell-specific transcriptional analysis could help to explain this phenomenon and its implications on host survival.",

For example, the 1700026D08Rik gene is associated with day 4 weight loss after PR8 infection (Ferris et al. 2013). We found that the same gene had DE isoforms in NOD/ShiLtJ mice at day 2 after PR8 infection. Although there was no genetic variation near intron\u2013exon boundaries of this gene in NOD/ShiLtJ mice, this strain-specific isoform expression pointed to possible genetic influence and therefore higher likelihood of being the causal gene among the 69 genes and 10 noncoding RNAs that were significantly associated with day 4 weight loss along with 1700026D08Rik. This is especially important because many genes, such as 1700026D08Rik, have poorly described or no known functions. We found that genes such as IL6, Sh3gl3, and Atxn10, which had previously been associated with different phenotypic outcomes in response to IAV infection, also expressed different isoforms in response to SARS-CoV infection. In this case, they have not been identified as QTL candidate genes for SARS-CoV infection, but their likely importance in the host response is increased because their genetic variations may cause large phenotypic variations and their isoforms were differentially expressed in samples from SARS-CoV\u2013infected animals. Because CC mice still have relatively large recombination intervals, the resolution of QTL using CC mice is not at the gene level, and QTL often will have many candidate genes within a significant region. Isoform differential expression results could prove very helpful in finding causal genes in future QTL studies using CC mice by searching for strain-specific DE isoforms among candidate genes. Candidate genes whose protective alleles differentially express isoforms and whose deleterious alleles do not differentially express isoforms are likely the causal genes.",
