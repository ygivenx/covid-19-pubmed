In Italy, it has been estimated that up to 9.5% of children aged 6-7 years and 10.4% of teenagers aged 13-14 years have ever been affected by this condition [1]. Acute asthma exacerbations are one of the most common reasons for presentation to the Emergency Department (ED) and for hospitalization in the pediatric age. In the United States, among asthmatic children nearly 60% have one or more acute exacerbations each year [2, 3], and up to 20% require ED visits annually [4]. Moreover, asthmatic patients treated in the ED are at higher risk for future exacerbations and any single severe acute episode may progress to life-threatening respiratory failure [2, 5].",

In the preschoolers (0\u20135 years old), acute wheeze is often induced by infections of the lower airways, whereas in the school-aged children (6 years and older) it usually signifies underlying asthma [6] and allergy. These differences account for specific seasonal patterns in the number of ED visits for asthma. In the temperate latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, a peak in exacerbations is described in the month of September: this well-known entity is called the \u201cSeptember asthma epidemics,\u201d coincides with the start of the school year, and is likely due to a combination of infectious, allergic, environmental, and climatic triggers [7]. Understanding the seasonal variations of ED visits due to asthma may have important therapeutic implications in terms of a proactive treatment of at-risk subjects.",

More recently, Cohen et al. analyzed data from 82234 asthmatic children and found that unscheduled primary care physicians visits and drug prescriptions for asthma were fluctuating during the first part of the year, had a decline in the summer months, and peaked in September with a lower peak in autumn [7].",

Acute asthma exacerbations are largely preventable [2], and so are ED visits and hospitalizations for this reason [9, 20\u201322]. In the United States, there have been federally funded initiatives to reduce this burden, such as school-based programs and a widespread dissemination of the guidelines, but a study performed on the total Pediatric ED visits from 2001 to 2010 highlighted that, despite these measures, the overall rate of potentially preventable ED visits for asthma did not change significantly over time [9].",

For them, the chance of needing hospitalization was higher than their peers with no previous asthma diagnosis. Among this group of older children with known asthma, up to 2/3 were not using controller medications, either for no prescription or for low compliance, and, according to our results, were at higher risk of a moderate-severe exacerbation than those using it. Controller medications are indicated in children with persistent asthma, and their correct use has been shown to reduce exacerbations and thereby ED visits for asthma [21, 24]. Evaluating asthma severity was beyond the goals of our study; thereby we cannot say how many of the 63 asthmatic children aged over 5 years and not using long-term controller therapy would have had a real need of such a prescription. However, the fact that so many asthmatic children were not using controller therapy, although our National Health System provides a pediatrics-specialized general practitioner for all children until the age of 14, seems to point out the need for an improvement in the territorial network of asthma management.",

We could not analyze the therapy performed and/or proposed at discharge, nor asthma severity which had not been evaluated or recorded during the ED visit. All children of any age were included; however, in those aged \u226412 months bronchiolitis might be mistaken for a wheezing bronchitis.",
