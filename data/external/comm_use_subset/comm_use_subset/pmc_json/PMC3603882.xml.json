All together, these viruses infect a wide range of domestic and wild species of the order Carnivora [2]. VP2, the major structural protein of the viral capsid, determines the pathogenicity, tissue tropism and host ranges of this virus subgroup [4], [5]. FPLV was originally identified in domestic cats [6] and later on other large felids, such as tigers, panthers, cheetahs and lions [2], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. Canine parvovirus (CPV-2) was detected for the first time in 1978, possibly emerging from a FPLV like-virus [13]. This highly virulent virus rapidly became endemic in dogs throughout the world. Original CPV-2 strain did not infect cats [4], however it was replaced by new antigenic variants, designated CPV-2a, CPV-2b and CPV-2c that regained the ability to infect felids [3],[5],[14].",

Reports refer mainly to serological or virological evidences rather than to clinical or anatomo-histological data (reviewed by [2]). MEV infection of minks is an exception, since most infected animals, in particular the young ones, develop acute hemorrhagic enteritis, frequently associated with leukopenia [16].",

Genets and mongooses are carnivores whose distribution is mainly restricted in Europe to the Iberian Peninsula (Portugal and Spain) [22],[23]. Only genet occupies southern France territories [23]. Due to several factors, namely the recent abandon of croplands, rural depopulation, great adaptability in terms of its bio-ecology and lack of natural predators, mongoose has been expanding rapidly from South to North, and, recently, it has invaded the Northeastern areas of Portugal from where it was absent in the beginning of the century [21],[24]. The population biology of these animal species is still largely unknown, namely their contribution to pathogen cross-species transmission. Therefore, the aim of the present work was to refine our understanding of viruses circulating in the wild. For this purpose, we determined the incidence of particular viruses in the most widely distributed, strictly terrestrial, wild carnivore species free-ranging in mainland Portugal: Egyptian mongoose, red fox, stone marten, Eurasian badger, and common genet, obtained from road-kills or harvested during predator control actions (mongoose and fox). Furthermore, the knowledge on the molecular properties of field parvoviruses that circulate within these populations was extended based on sequence analysis. Even though animal sampling was widespread, including sensitive areas for conservation, it was more intense in the South region of the mainland, next to priority intervention areas of the Iberian lynx Action Plan in Portugal that potentially offer suitable habitat for the reintroduction of this endangered carnivore species.",

The incidence rates detected during this study in widely distributed wild carnivore species from mainland Portugal are consistent with this notion. Although sample sizes were statistically limited, the incidence of parvovirus found in red foxes (78.9%), genets, stone martens and badgers (virtually all specimens tested) is notable. Also remarkable is the rate of parvovirus DNA present among mongooses (58%), which, to our knowledge, is reported for the first time in this species. Even though most specimens presented autolysis, the use of tissues, such as lymph nodes and intestine, as matrices in our methodological approach, together with the higher sensibility of real-time PCR facilitated viral detection and evaluation of parvovirus prevalence in wild species, in comparison with other studies performed in the country relying on the analysis of scats with conventional PCR [19]. The high Ct values registered with autolysed positive samples contrasted with lower Ct values routinely obtained with fresh samples from cats and dogs under active disease (Duarte et al., unpublished results), suggesting that only small amounts of parvovirus DNA were present, likely corresponding to persistent viral DNA left over from previous infections. This possibility explains unsuccessful virus isolation in CRFK cells and the absence of evident macro- or microscopic pathological lesions in the subset of specimens that were not under autolysis. The difficulty found in the amplification of the full vp2 gene, aiming the molecular characterization of the virus, is also sustained by this hypothesis. Difficulty in viral isolation from feces and intestine samples of wild species, particularly red fox, has been referred before [27],[28].",

Parvovirus antibodies have been reported in wild red foxes from other geographical areas, namely Spain [29] and Canada [30].

            "text": "Amplification of complete or even partial vp2 gene sequences allowing the molecular characterization of the viruses from badgers and genets was not achieved in our study. In contrast, our sequencing results clearly show that the mongoose and red fox strains belong to the feline parvovirus cluster, as they encode key amino acids characteristic of FPLV. Whereas FPLV is maintained independently in the mongoose and red fox populations, or acquired through the direct or indirect contact with other infected wild or domestic carnivores, is unknown. Parvovirus is extremely stable and can remain infectious in the environment for many months, which facilitates transmission by fecal-oral route among susceptible species. Wild species, particularly red foxes and raccoons, have been pointed as candidate evolutionary intermediates of FPLV-CPV [27] and CPV-2-CPV-2a parvovirus evolution [31] respectively. The molecular data obtained during our study, regarding the characterization of parvoviruses from Vulpes vulpes in Portugal, does not clarify this hypothesis, as we cannot exclude that domestic cats, or even mongooses, may have been the source of FPLV-like viruses infection to these foxes. The higher degree of genetic similarity between the FPLV viruses from different wild species originated in Portugal, in comparison with the FPLV sequences presently available in GenBank, may suggest the geographic clustering of parvoviruses that circulate in Western Iberia. A phylogenetic analysis using the two vp2 complete sequences obtained during this study and thirty five strains from several wild species reinforces this hypothesis, as the mongoose FPLV-like virus grouped with two FPLV strains from large captive Felidae from Lisbon, diverging only in two nucleotide positions (760 and 871). On the other hand, parvovirus from Martes foina was molecularly characterized as new-CPV-2b, providing the first publicly available parvovirus vp2 nucleotide sequence from this species. Although a stone marten CPV-2a strain was referred by Steinel et al. 2001 [2], its nucleotide sequence is not available in Genbank. The phylogenetic analysis showed a close genetic similarity of the stone marten isolate with Asian leopard parvoviruses, also belonging to the newCPV-2b subtype. Due to the genetic similarity found between the stone marten vp2 sequence and a newCPV-2b domestic dog strain from USA (EU659121), and the circulation of different CPV-2b strains in Portugal [32], it is likely that the stone marten virus may have been originated in infected domestic species, and do not appear to represent an evolutionary intermediate in the CPV-2b branch.",

Although a carrier stage has not been defined for dogs after infection by CPV, it has been observed that asymptomatic adult dogs may periodically shed the virus [34]. It is also known that infected cats, whether symptomatic or not, serve as reservoirs and source of infection to other animals [35]. Concerning the animal species under study, data on the severity of the disease has been reported for red foxes experimentally infected [30]. In that study, a marked immune response was apparently developed after infection with FPLV but no clinical signs were detected with MEV and CPV-2 inoculation [30]. Regarding previous works in badgers, macro and microscopic lesions suggestive of CPV myocarditis on an adult specimen have been reported [36], as well as parvovirus-associated enteritis followed by death of badger cubs [37]. Our work was inconclusive with this respect, as tissue autolysis of positive badger specimens limited the investigation of pathological findings. To our knowledge, there are no virological reports dedicated to the study of the susceptibility of herpestids, particularly the Egyptian mongoose, to parvovirus infection. However, Millan and collaborators (2009) have previously reported the detection of parvovirus antibodies in this species (n = 18, 50%) [38]. The remarkable prevalence found during this study in red foxes and mongooses, together with the concomitant lack of evident gross gastro-enteric lesions during necropsy, argues for the presence of viral DNA persisting from previous infections. Any significant parvovirus disease is likely in neonatal or young animals, so the lack of lesions suggestive of acute parvovirus infection at necropsy would likely not be connected to the effects of the original infections by these viruses on the specimens surveyed. Furthermore, as sampling did not include animals found naturally dead, or apparently sick, the possibility that mongoose or red fox may also undergo acute disease cannot be overlooked. No specimen had clinical signs suggestive of haemorrhagic enteritis or congestion, as observed in cats or dogs under active disease. In addition, whenever present, faeces were consistently moulded and no signs of diarrhoea were ever noticed.",

However, in our modelling effort, we failed to detect such influence on mongoose susceptibility to parvovirus. The mongoose population that we surveyed was strongly biased by adult specimens. Thus, we believe that other factors, not considered in our study due to lack of data, such as domestic pet distribution in rural areas (e.g. free ranging domestic cats), and species-specific ecological variables, like feeding habits and land use, or carnivore guild diversity, distribution, and social character, may be crucial in the patterns of infection of wild species by this viral agent.",

This is especially dramatic if species of conservation value or endangered are affected, as is the case of the Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus), the most endangered felid in the world [38] that is expected to be reintroduced in Portugal in the future. The introduction of parvovirus-susceptible lynx [38] into geographical areas where the virus is circulating in the wild, and potentially excreted to the environment, should take into account the effective risk of transmission to the particularly susceptible young cubs. Targeted surveillance efforts should therefore be reinforced to improve our understanding of the ecological and epidemiological factors associated with microbial infection, in order to develop sustained management and conservation strategies for animal species at risk.",

The lowest Ct values were obtained, respectively with 5 \u00b5L of DNA and 10 \u00b5L of RNA per PCR reaction, although all the other volumes generated positive signals. Based on the results obtained, aliquots of 5 \u00b5L of DNA or 10 \u00b5L of RNA were added to each 25 \u00b5L PCR reaction containing 1 \u00b5M of each PCR primer (Eurofins MWG Operon, Ebersberg, Germany) and 0.2 \u00b5M of the TaqMan probe (Eurofins MWG Operon, Ebersberg, Germany). Amplifications were done in a Bio-Rad CFX96\u2122 Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories Srl, Redmond, USA) taking into account the annealing temperatures of the primers and the characteristics of the amplification kits used for each nucleic acid amplification. For parvovirus amplification, reactions were carried out at 95\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s, 52\u00b0C for 30 s and 60\u00b0C for 30 s, while, for coronavirus amplification, reactions were composed by a step of 30 min at 50\u00b0C, followed by 15 min at 95\u00b0C and 50 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s, 56\u00b0C for 30 s, 72\u00b0C for 30 s. For the remaining viral agents, PCR conditions were those described at the references enlisted in Table 2. Primers and probes used for parvovirus detection and characterization are described in Table 3\n. Positive and negative controls were used in each assay. Fluorescence measurements were recorded after each annealing step. Data was analyzed with the appropriate sequence detector software (Bio-Rad CFX Manager, version 3.0). The specificity of the primers and probe used in this survey for parvovirus DNA detection [46] was assessed against the NCBI nucleotide sequence database (27.11. 2011) (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/db/FASTA). The in silico analysis showed 100% identity between the nucleotide sequences of the primers and probe and the homologous sequences in Canine, Feline and Mink parvoviruses, demonstrating that this real-time PCR, published as a molecular tool to detect and quantify CPV in dog samples [46], detects also Feline parvoviruses.",

            "text": "Lung tissue extracts (LTE) were prepared as described by Ferroglio et al. [47] and used to test the presence of circulating antibodies against parvovirus in PCR positive specimens. Briefly, lung tissue was homogenized in PBS, centrifuged at 10000xg for 10 min and the supernatant conserved at \u221220\u00b0C. The presence of antibodies against parvovirus (feline or canine parvoviruses) in LTEs was determined with a commercial indirect ELISA test for canine parvovirus antibodies (Ingezim CPV\u00a9 15.CPV.K1, Ingenasa, Madrid, Spain). Using this ELISA test, it is not possible to determine if the antibodies detected are raised against FPLV or CPV due to the high antigenic similarity between these viruses. In order to detect antibodies from the different carnivore species, the anti-dog conjugate was replaced by Protein A-Peroxidase Staphylococcus aureus/horseradish (PA-HRPO) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) at the dilution of 1\u22362000, determined after titration of PA-HRPO in parallel with the kit conjugate, which generated OD values for the positive and negative controls identical to those obtained with the kit conjugate. All the other steps followed the recommendations of the manufacturer. This adapted ELISA has been used successfully in our laboratory to detect parvovirus antibodies in serum samples of large Felidae, namely lions and tigers (Duarte et al., unpublished results). LTEs of seven mongooses and three red foxes that were negative in the real-time PCR were selected as putative antibody negative samples and tested in this adapted ELISA to infer about possible unspecific backgrounds and to evaluate the suitability of the kit cut off value for the ELISA PA-HRPO. Lower non-specific reactivity was detected in LTEs from PCR negative samples when using protein A-HRPO. The OD450 nm values obtained in mongoose\u2019s LTEs ranged from 0.057 to 0.135, corresponding to a S/P ratio (sample optic density/positive control optic density) of 0.03 and 0.07, respectively, and in red-fox\u2019s LTEs ranged from 0.060 to 0.101, corresponding to a S/P ratio of 0.05 and 0.04, respectively. These results confirmed the successful use of protein A-HRPO in ELISA to detect mongoose IgGs. Protein-A conjugate has also been used in other studies to detect fox IgGs [48],[49]. The cut-off established by adding 2 standard deviations (SD) to the mean of the negative control duplicates was in agreement with the cut-off criteria of the kit (samples considered positive if S/P value above 0.150). Therefore, the validation criteria of the test were adopted: test was considered valid if OD450nm of the positive control>1.0 and OD450 nm of the negative control<0.150. For interpretation of the ELISA PA\u2013HRPO test results, samples were considered positive if S/P value was above 0.150. To evaluate the sensibility of the modified test, LTEs from two foxes, that were found respectively antibody positive and antibody negative by this adapted ELISA, were also tested in parallel with the heterologous conjugate (anti-dog IgG-HRPO) from the commercial ELISA, since sufficient cross-reactivity exist between anti-canine IgG and serum antibody from red foxes [49]. Our results showed that the ELISA using protein A affinity conjugate was slightly less sensitive for measuring anti-parvovirus antibodies in foxes than the equivalent commercial ELISA. In the case of the antibody positive red fox LTE, S/P ratios of 0.304 and 0.429 were obtained with the modified and commercial ELISA test, respectively; and, in the case of the fox LTE testing antibody negative, ratios of 0.03 and 0.064 were registered, respectively.",
