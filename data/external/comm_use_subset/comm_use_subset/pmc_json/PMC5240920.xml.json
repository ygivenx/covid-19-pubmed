For example, infection network models are commonly used when symptom onset date for each reported case is available [12\u201317]. In these models, disease spread is described as a directed network in which the nodes represent cases and the directed edges between nodes represent transmission links. In the absence of the type of detailed individual-level data required by infection network methods, compartmental transmission dynamic models have been used for parameter estimation and for projecting epidemic trajectory. These models divide the population into disjoint subgroups (e.g. susceptible, infectious, and recovered) and transitions between the epidemic states are described using ordinary differential equations (for deterministic models) [18] or Markov chains (for stochastic models) [19].",

Therefore, the likelihood function (1) is often approximated by assuming that the epidemic observations in each period follow a discrete probability distribution (e.g. Poisson distribution) and are independently distributed across observation periods [23, 33]. For example, to approximate the likelihood function (1), Riley and colleagues assume that epidemic observations follow independent Poisson distributions where means are chosen to match the means generated from 250 model replications [23].

To quantify the performance of these methods based on each target metric Mi (e.g. estimating R0 or prediction of the number of incident cases in the subsequent period after observing Yi), we used the integrated relative error (IRE):\nIREMi=100\u222b\u0398\u00af\u222b\u03a8i|M\u02dci-m|M\u02dcifMi|\u03b8(m|\u03b8)\u03c0i(\u03b8|Yi)dmd\u03b8(16)\nwhere fMi|\u03b8(m|\u03b8) is the probability density function of target Mi given the estimated parameter values \u03b8, Mi\u02dc is the true value of target Mi. \u03a8i is the set of possible values that the target Mi can take (i.e. the support of the probability density function f), and \u0398\u00af represents the set of all parameter values (see SI for further details). We chose IRE as the performance metric since it provides a precise measure for how well the mass of the posterior distribution covers the true value of the targets to estimate.

In this sensitivity analysis, the MSS method demonstrated the ability to cope with noisy data and sustain its performance (S9 Fig). We next considered a scenario for which the epidemic trajectories are provided by an SEITR model (see S1 Text subsection 2 \u201cEquations of the SEITR model\u201d) but an SITR model is chosen for parameter estimation and prediction. This allowed us to test to what extent model misspecification could erode the performance of these approaches, which is important because the true epidemic process may not be known. This sensitivity analysis revealed that each of the calibration methods considered here maintained their performance under this particular model misspecification scenario with respect to most performance criteria, but had problems with estimates for Reff (S10 and S11 Figs). Each method failed to accurately estimate Reff after the peak, which may be explained by the fact that in extreme epidemic scenarios used in this experiment, only a few number of individuals remain in the Susceptible compartment. Since the misspecified model used for calibration does not include the additional Exposed compartment, the size of Susceptible compartment is overestimated by all calibration methods, which leads to inaccurate Reff estimates after the peak.",

The MSS state updating procedure allows the calculation of these correlations using a single parameter vector.

The I.Poi. requires the execution of stochastic simulations for each parameter and is the most cost intensive of all four alternatives tested.

Despite the fact that the MSS approach proposed here does not include such a mechanism to address filter degeneracy, MSS demonstrated very competitive performance in these simulated epidemic scenarios.

Second, our evaluation are based on \u201csimulated\u201d epidemic trajectories.

If the fraction of cases that remains undetected is known and fixed, this is easily handled in the model with the addition of compartments and parameters to reflect the observation process, However, the degree of underreporting is often unknown and may change over the course of an epidemic. Such underreporting impacts the performance of all available calibration methods, and the development of novel approaches that can better account for this phenomenon is an important direction for future research.",
