The predominant mosquito species transmitting DENV, CHIKV and ZIKV, are Aedes aegypti and Aedes Albopictus, which are widely distributed in tropical and sub-tropical regions [4]. In the past few years, several studies have reported concurrent outbreaks of DENV, CHIKV and ZIKV in the same geographical area [5, 6]. Currently, unprecedented outbreaks of DENV, CHIKV and ZIKV are co-occurring in Brazil. In 2017, the Brazilian Ministry of Health estimated that approximately 251,000 suspected cases of DENV, 185,000 suspected cases of CHIKV and close to 18,000 suspected ZIKV cases had occurred in Brazil [7].",

While infections with ZIKV are rarely fatal, as stated before, ZIKV infections may result in Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and congenital malformations [10,11]. Genomic surveillance of epidemics at the appropriate resolution and consistently classifying the reported genetic sequences, also enables the identification of strains associated with greater epidemic potential [12] or disease severity [13].",

Each alignment was edited manually until a codon-correct alignment was achieved in all genes. The next step in this exploration involved a phylogenetic analysis using PhyML (i.e. Maximum likelihood, 1000 bootstrap replicates) and MrBayes (i.e. Bayesian) [16,17]. With this approach, four main DENV clades (i.e. serotype 1 to 4) and 19 genotypes (i.e. 1I, 1II, 1III, 1IV, 1V, 2I, 2II, 2III, 2IV, 2V, 2VI, 3I, 3II, 3III, 3V, 4I, 4II, 4III and 4IV) were identified. These findings are in agreement with the current consensus in DENV classification [18\u201321]. For CHIKV, three phylogenetic clades can be distinguished: The East-Central-South African (ECSA) genotype, the Asian-Caribbean genotype and the West African genotype. The West African genotype being more divergent and less widespread than the ECSA genotype and the Asian-Caribbean genotype [22,23]. ZIKV, as well, can be classified into two genotypes. The African genotype, originally identified in Uganda in 1947 [24], is found in many African countries [25]. The Asian genotype was identified in Malaysia in 1966 [26], this genotype has recently caused the worldwide epidemic in Asia and the Pacific [27,28], and is responsible for the epidemic in the Americas [5].",

For example, we normally start by selecting 5\u201310 sequences that represent the diversity of each virus genotypes. Sequences that met these selection criteria were quality controlled for the presence of insertions, deletions, frame shifts and non-IUPAC characters using VIRULIGN [32]. For DENV, we used the reference sequences that are included with the VIRULIGN software, for ZIKV, we used the reference sequence presented in [33], and for CHIKV we constructed a new reference sequence from NC_004162 that we added to the VIRULIGN repository. Sequences that pass the quality control were aligned using MAFFT [15], and were subjected to phylogenetic analysis using PAUP* (i.e. Neighbor Joining), MrBayes (i.e. Bayesian) and PhyML (i.e. Maximum likelihood) [16,17,34,35] using GTR+G+I.

The typing report presents information about the sequence name of the query sequence, the nucleotide length of the sequence, an illustration of the position of the sequence in the virus\u2019 genome, the species assignment and the genotype assignment. A detailed report is provided for the phylogenetic analysis that resulted into this classification. All results can be exported to a variety of file formats (XML, CSV, Excel or FASTA format). The detailed HTML report (B) contains information on the sequence name, length, assigned virus and genotype, an illustration of the position of the sequence in the virus\u2019 genome and the phylogenetic analysis section. The phylogenetic analysis section shows the alignment and constructed phylogeny: the query sequence is always shown at the top of the phylogenetic tree.",

When the submitted sequence is a Dengue virus, the serotype is determined using another BLAST invocation (D).

The boot-scanning method uses a sliding window of a 1500 base pair segment that moves with steps of 100 base pairs along the genome. The X-axis represents the nucleotide position in the genome, and the Y-axis represents bootstrap support in percentages. The light-grey rectangular area marks the location of the envelope gene in each graph. The inset color code shows the genotypes defined in each virus species. For ZIKV (A), this is African and Asian. For CHIKV (B), this is Asian Caribbean (A-C), West African (WA) and East-Central-South African (ECSA). For DENV (C-F), the genotype is visualized by a Roman numeral. Only genotypes which showed less than 100% bootstrap support across the genome are shown.",
