The first recognized MARV outbreak occurred in Marburg, Germany in 1967 after the importation of infected monkeys from Uganda [3, 4]. Since then, MARV has caused more than 592 human infections and more than 480 deaths. The most recent outbreak occurred in 2014 in Uganda [5]. Because of the high lethality rates and rapid onset, MARV and other viruses have been actively pursued in the past as potential biological weapons [6].",

Although effective treatments or licensed vaccines against MARV infection are not currently available, substantial progress has been made in the search for a MARV vaccine over the past several years [7\u201310]. DNA vaccines, recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vectored vaccines and virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines have been demonstrated to work as prophylactic vaccines and post-exposure treatments in animal models [11]. VLPs are viral proteins that self-assemble into structures resembling the conformation of the authentic native virus; however, they lack a viral genome. Therefore, VLPs are safe and have been successfully developed into commercialized vaccines or candidate vaccines for porcine circovirus (PCV) type 2, hepatitis B virus (HBV), human papillomavirus (HPV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [12\u201315]. Because of the high yield, easy construction and large packaging capacity, insect cell baculovirus expression systems have been commonly used for VLP studies [16, 17]. VLPs are capable of activating cells involved in both innate and adaptive immunity, and they can induce strong humoral and cellular immune responses [18\u201320].",

GP is the primary antigen for eliciting protective immune responses [21\u201323]. A previous study showed that the GP and VP40 from MARV assemble into VLPs in mammalian cells, and these VLPs are capable of conferring effective protection as a vaccine against a lethal MARV challenge in mice and inducing both humoral and cellular immune responses [21, 23]. Subsequent studies with VLPs containing MARV GP, VP40 and NP, which were generated using a baculovirus expression system, demonstrated that this combination confers protection in guinea pigs and cynomolgus macaques [7, 24]. Recently, we showed that the co-expression of GP and VP40 in insect cells also led to the efficient assembly and release of VLPs. Electron microscopy findings indicated a similar morphology with wild-type MARV [25].",

            "text": "At present, the trend in vaccine development has shown that antigens often lack sufficient immunogenicity, thus requiring the addition of potent adjuvants [26]. Adjuvants have been traditionally used to increase or modulate the humoral or cellular immune response against a vaccine antigen, and reduce vaccine costs by limiting the amount of required antigen. With advances in vaccine technology, many immune potentiator adjuvants have emerged. Natural polysaccharides have been found to act as immunologic enhancers that can be used as an immunopotentiator for enhancing cellular immunity and promoting antibody production. These polysaccharides are natural, safe and non-residual [27\u201329]. Poria cocos has a long history of medicinal use in China. Their olysaccharides and derivatives exhibit many beneficial medicinal biological activities, including anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antiviral activities [30\u201332]. In our previous study, a new polysaccharide (PCP-II) was isolated from the sclerotium of Poria cocos. PCP-II has a molecular weight of 29.0 kDa, and it consists of fucose, mannose, glucose and galactose in a molar ratio of 1.00:1.63:0.16:6.29, respectively. PCP-II stimulated significantly antibody responses and extended the durable immunity to an inactiveted rabies vaccine, H1N1 influenza and HBsAg vaccine [33, 34].",

Also, the level of IFN-\u03b3 or IL4 secretion from all mice vaccinated with the MARV VLPs was higher than that observed in the control mice. For IFN-\u03b3, the PCP-II group had more than 1000 SFCs, whereas the other groups had approximately 100~500 SFCs.
