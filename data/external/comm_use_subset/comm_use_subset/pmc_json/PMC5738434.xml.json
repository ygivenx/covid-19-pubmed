Hemagglutinin (HA) is recognized as the major surface antigen. It is critical for viral attachment and membrane fusion. These are key steps for virus\u2019s entre into cells and critical to further process of virus infection11,12. Transmembrane (TM) domain of the HA protein serves as an anchor site and plays an important role in supporting viral fusion to the target membrane13. In acidic environment, substitution of the TM domain showed an abolishment of receptor binding and membrane fusion, leading to a failure of virus entry into the cells14,15. In addition, this domain was found to be important for biological characteristics of the influenza viruses, such as viral replication, virulence and pathogenicity16\u201318. Our previous research showed that substitutions of cysteines in the HA TM domain and a replacement with the H3-HA transmembrane (TM) domain could enhance heterosubtypic protection (hetero-protection) in mice19. And an inactivated recombinant H7N9 vaccine with the TM-replacement presented broadened protection with promoted HI titers in vaccinated animals using antiserum. Furthermore, the level of IFN\u03b3 was also increased, when inactivated H7N9 viruses were used as stimulant20. Therefore, the HA TM domain is considered to be a potential candidate site for vaccine development.",

We found the TM-replaced virus (H9N2-TM) formed smaller plaques than the recombinant wildtype virus (H9N2-WT) (Fig. 2A), suggesting a slow viral replication due to the transmembrane (TM) domain replacement in cells. This was further confirmed when growth curves was measured that the pfu titers of recombinant H9N2-TM were lower than that of H9N2-WT (Fig. 2B). The pfu titers of H9N2-TM were significantly decreased at 24 h (p < 0.01), 36 h (p < 0.05) and 48 h (p < 0.05) post-infection, suggesting TM-replacement may have an effect on delaying virus replication. When inoculated in chicken embryos, the H9N2-WT showed 8.17 log10EID50/0.1 ml for virus titer, while the recombinant H9N2-TM showed 6.5 log10EID50/0.1 ml (Fig. 2C), indicating a low infectivity of H9N2-TM in chicken embryos.

Take H9N2 viruses in China for instance, which was previously considered to share similar antigenicity profiles2,21, vaccine strains and their relevant variants are mainly used for H9N2 virus protection in China. However, current existing vaccines could not fulfill their task to prevent the outbreaks of H9N2 in 2011\u20132013 in poultry farming of China22. Moreover, recent studies found that some H9N2 influenza viruses were originated from the vaccine strains through antigenic drift and these antigenic variants finally caused the catastrophe in poultry industry of China in 2011\u20132013, even under the long-term vaccination programs9. Therefore, to prevent next outbreaks of further antigenic H9N2 variants caused by immunological pressure, an effective, safe and subtype-specific H9N2 vaccine which can provide cross-protection is required.",

Since the discovery of a series of broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, the majority of which target to highly conserved region of HA stem, researchers began to discuss the potential to induce broad protective immunity23\u201326. Various attempts were conducted to stabilize the HA stem in order to induce broad protective immunity. The stability and immunogenicity of the stabilized HA proteins through fusion with trimerization sequences have shown increased broad protective immunity. For instance, researchers showed when the HA protein was fused to the foldon domain of fibritin from bacterial phage T4 or GCN4p trimerization repeat, the fusion proteins showed increased stability and cross-reactive immunity27,28. Further researchers showed that fused ectodomain of HA protein to ferritin could form nanoparticles and the nanoparticle vaccine could improve the potency and breadth of influenza virus immunity29, suggesting the importance of HA protein stability in enhancing cross-protection. This plausible correlation of the major surface antigen stability and cross-immunity was also supported by other researches using S protein of SARS virus that the trimerized forms could elicit higher levels of neutralizing antibodies30. The biological significance of HA stability remains unclear and future work is required.",

Recently, we developed a TM-replaced H7N9 vaccine. Mice vaccinated with H7N9-TM vaccine strain showed increased cross-reactive antibodies and were well protected against interclade H7N9 viruses20. Consistent with the previous studies, our data indicated that TM replacement could actually alter the physical and chemical characteristics of H9N2 virus. The delayed virus replication in TM-replaced viruses may contribute to low pathogenesis.
