VP6 is required not only for polymerase activity and but also for maintaining the proper structure of the viral core or the core protein-based transcriptional complex. Myristylation of VP6 is required for virus particle formation as well as targeting single-shelled particles to the ER membrane for budding [13]. As VP6 is both highly immunogenic and antigenic, it is the most frequently used in diagnostic assays to detect PRV [14]. Herein, we expressed the VP6 gene from a PRV Chinese isolate DN30209 by cloning this gene into a bacterial expression system. We then generated rabbit polyclonal anti-serum and ascertained its immunoreactivity to VP6 protein. Using the anti-VP6 antibody, we established a differentiating ELISA for PRV. These experiments provided basis for determination of PRV.",

The sequencing results showed that the cloned VP6 gene was 1356 bp containing a complete open reading frame (ORF) encoding 397 amino acids. The sequence has been submitted to GenBank and was allocated a GenBank accession number (JN977137). Compared with PRV JL94, there were three mutations at N94H, G126R and I182V; compared with PRV GD, three mutations N94H, I182V and T244A were identified. As DN30209, JL94 and GD all were isolated from northern China, these viruses may be geographical prevalent in northern areas in China. Based on the randomly selected PRV reference strains, the VP6 amino acid sequences were compared. As shown in Figure 1, PRVs DN30209 and several PRV group A strains OSU, JL94 GD, CRW-8, 4F and 4S etc. had more than 90% homologous identity at amino acid level. RNA-PAGE analysis showed that the rotavirus represented long electropherotype migration pattern of porcine group A rotaviruses (Figure 2). Further phylogenetic tree analysis also indicated that PRV DN30203 located in the same clade with above-mentioned PRV group A strains (Figure 3). Therefore, we speculate that PRV DN30209 also belongs to group A of rotavirus. Nevertheless, it is necessary to do more serological and epidemiological investigations to get full understanding on the evolution of PRV in the future.",

In our laboratory, we have expressed several heterologous proteins in this system [16-19]. In this study, we analyzed the bacterial expression of VP6 protein in E.coli. SDS-PAGE showed that fused VP6 protein was approx. 48 kDa as expected and accumulated in the bacteria as inclusion bodies (Figure 4). In this study, a rabbit anti-VP6 antibody was generated by conventional animal immunization. The optimization of the ELISA was determined. As shown in Figure 5, after the fixation of the concentration of PRV VP6 protein, the optimal antibody dilution was1:29. In addition to reaction with VP6 protein, at such dilution, the anti-VP6 serum also had the best reactivity to PRV. The optimization of the ELISA may be useful reference to detect PRV from clinical samples in the future. The reactivity of the protein to anti-VP6 antibody was then analyzed by Western blot. Our result showed that the bacterially expressed VP6 can be recognized by the antiserum, confirming that the VP6 is both highly immunogenic and antigenic (Figure 6). The immunoreactivity of the anti-VP6 antibody to eukaryotically expressed VP6 was further analyzed by IFA. As shown in Figure 7, the antibody reacted with VP6-expressing cells; in contrast, no green signal was detected in mock-transfected cells, confirming the specific recognition of the anti-VP6 antibody. In this study, the anti-VP6 antibody was generated by inoculating rabbit with VP6 expressed from E.coli, however, this antibody reacted with VP6 protein transiently expressed on cells. These data further confirm that bacterially expressed VP6 can be used as a good immunogen and the antibody can be used as good diagnostic reagent for detection of PRV VP6 protein.",

Other porcine viruses may cause co-infection with PRV, thus, discrimination between PRV and other viruses is important for clinical diagnosis purpose. Recently, we have confirmed that the antiserum to VP7 protein of PRV may also serve as a diagnostic agent for detection of PRV (unpublished data). Nevertheless, it has been pointed out that PRV VP6 protein is the most frequently target protein in diagnostic assays to detect virus particles. As ELISA is simple, convenient and sensitive immunological assays suitable for detection of pathogens [19-22], a discrimination ELISA for detection of PRV was established using the anti-VP6 antibody. Several control viruses were included in the ELISA to determine the specificity of the ELISA. The result showed that the anti-VP6 antibody had significant reactivity with PRV; in contrast, there was no positive P/N value among other controls (p<0.01) (Figure 8). Our results have demonstrated clearly that the VP6-antibody based ELISA works well in our laboratory, however, validation of the test using clinical samples are important so that the test can be applied in the field level for detection of PRVs. Thus, we will evaluate the utility of this VP6-antibody based ELISA in nature by including PRV clinical samples in the future.",
