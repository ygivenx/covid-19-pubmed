Since the amino acid sequences of their HA and NA are distinct from those of all previously known IAV subtypes, these bat-derived influenza viruses (BatIVs) were provisionally designated H17N10 and H18N11. However, previous studies have reported that H17 HA does not bind to sialic acids linked to galactose in sugar chains7, which are known as canonical receptors of IAVs, and that N10 NA lacks neuraminidase activity8 which is also a common property of all known influenza viruses. Thus, BatIV glycoproteins have also been called HA-like (HL) and NA-like (NL) (i.e., HL17NL10 and HL18NL11)9. However, information on the biological properties of these BatIVs is limited since infectious virus particles have never been isolated from infected animals.",

However, some previous studies could only investigate reassortant viruses containing BatIV internal protein gene segments and HA/NA gene segments of well-characterized IAVs and failed to generate wild-type BatIVs, most likely due to the strict host cell specificity (i.e., receptor usage) for propagation of BatIVs18,19. Recently, one research group confirmed the rescue of infectious BatIV with its whole gene segments using the cell line MDCK II which originated from highly passaged MDCK cells and has different properties from the parent cell line commonly used for IAV propagation17. In this study, we demonstrated the generation of infectious BatIVs and their reassortants using HEK293T cells.",

This is the first report of reassortants generated between the two BatIVs that have been discovered so far, indicating that these BatIVs share their packaging signals in their RNA genomes. It is thought that each RNA segment contains packaging signals within the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 non-coding and parts of coding regions in the genomic RNA21. Previous studies tried to generate reassortant viruses consisting of BatIV segments and those of other previously known IAVs18,19. Although BatIV segments have almost identical sequences at the extreme 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends, these attempts failed to generate reassortant viruses. However, BatIV-based chimeric viruses whose HA and NA segments have the BatIV non-coding region with adjacent parts of the coding region of well-characterized H1 and H7 HAs were generated in previous studies18,19. It was also suggested that the failure of BatIV reassortants with other known IAVs was due to the incompatibility of NP and genomic segments22. This evidence implied that the non-coding region and adjacent parts of the coding region might also play critical roles in genome packaging in BatIVs. Taken together, our results suggest the potential for reassortment among BatIVs in nature, though there may be little possibility that BatIVs generate reassortant viruses with avian and mammalian IAVs.",

A previous study reported that BatIVs infected preferentially at the basolateral membrane of MDCK II cells17. In this study, since BatIV particles were inoculated into sub-confluent cells, it might be possible that infection was initiated at basolateral side, especially the edge of monolayer cells. Alternatively, there may be a difference of expression and localization of BatIV receptor molecule(s) between susceptible bat-derived cell lines and MDCK II cells. It would be of interest to investigate infection through the basolateral site of bat-derived cells. More importantly, BatIV cell tropism is likely determined by the receptor engagement of the virus since the cell lines susceptible to BatIVs were consistent with those of VSVs pseudotyped with BatIV surface glycoproteins15. It has been reported that HAs of BatIVs do not recognize sialic acids, which are known as the receptor molecules of other known IAVs23. In addition, crystal structure analysis of BatIV HAs revealed that the receptor binding pocket of BatIV HAs is smaller than those of the other IAVs examined23,24. Although the receptor molecules of BatIVs are still unknown, a previous study indicated that BatIV receptor(s) may be a certain glycoprotein shared by some particular bat species15.",

However, since the two BatIV-susceptible cell lines used in this study were highly sensitive to trypsin and also unable to be maintained in fetal calf serum (FCS)-free media, these cell lines could not be used for the cultivation of the virus in the conditions for multiple replication cycles in vitro. Our long-term goals are to biologically characterize BatIVs, identify receptor molecules of BatIVs, and elucidate the host range and ecology of BatIVs in nature. Once information on the cellular receptor molecule(s) for BatIVs is in hand, it may be possible to generate fully susceptible cell lines by introducing the molecule(s) and thus to prepare large amounts of infectious BatIV particles needed to fully characterize their biologically properties both in vitro and in vivo.",
