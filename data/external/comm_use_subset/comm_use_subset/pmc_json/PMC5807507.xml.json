Because the DAP IV gene is found in many pathogenic bacteria, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis (which causes periodontitis)29 and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (which causes opportunistic infections)30, structural information for a bacterial DAP IV would assist in the development of selective inhibitors for the DAP IVs of pathogenic bacteria.",

            "text": "Crystal structure analyses of mammalian DPP IVs have revealed that the enzyme is a homodimer (or a dimer of dimers for the pig enzyme), and each subunit comprises a C-terminal \u03b1/\u03b2 hydrolase domain encompassing the enzymatic active site and an N-terminal, eight-bladed, \u03b2-propeller domain31\u201334. A conserved double-Glu motif35, Glu205-Glu206 (numbering for the human enzyme), forms salt bridges to the N-terminus (P2 residue) of a peptide substrate. The double-Glu motif is located on a short helix insertion in blade 4 of the \u03b2-propeller domain. The double-Glu motif also exists in a fibroblast activation protein \u03b1 (FAP), a DPP IV-family enzyme25, which shares approximately 50% sequence identity to DPP IV and exhibits a DPP IV-like fold36. The side chain of Arg125, located in blade 2 of the \u03b2-propeller domain, is involved in the recognition of the carbonyl group of a peptide substrate33,34. The P1-binding pocket for smaller side chains (Pro or Ala) of the substrate is formed by the hydrophobic aromatic amino acids Tyr547, Tyr662 and Tyr666 from the \u03b1/\u03b2 hydrolase domain, leaving no space for large substituents at that position33,34. Thus, the crystal structures of mammalian DPP IVs in complex with peptide substrates/products have been reported, but no crystal structure for bacterial DAP IV in complex with either inhibitor or reaction intermediates has yet been reported. The first bacterial DAP IV structure is that of ligand-free DAP IV from S. maltophilia (SmDAP IV) at 2.8 \u00c5 resolution37. Although the overall structure of SmDAP IV is similar to those of mammalian DPP IVs, insertions or deletions are found around the active site; for example, Arg125 (which is involved in the recognition of a substrate carbonyl group in mammalian DPP IV) is missing in SmDAP IV. In the absence of a crystal structure of a bacterial DAP IV complexed with an inhibitor (or reaction intermediates), a complete structural understanding of DAP IV-substrate interactions has thus far been impossible. This knowledge will be important to guide the structure-based design of novel selective inhibitors of pathogenic DAP IVs. A structural analysis of a bacterial DAP IV in complex with an inhibitor is clearly of broad interest. Recently, the crystal structure of DPP IV from Porphyromonas gingivalis (PgDPP IV) in a ligand-free form at 2.2 \u00c5 resolution was reported38. Unexpectedly, the overall structure and substrate-binding site of PgDPP IV are quite similar to those of human DPP IV rather than those of SmDAP IV. Arg125 in human DPP IV is conserved as Arg115 in PgDPP IV. This indicates that DPP IVs can be categorised into two groups: human DPP IV-type DPP IVs and SmDAP IV-type DAP IVs. PgDPP IV belongs to the human DPP IV group; therefore, we designate DPP IV from P. gingivalis as PgDPP IV rather than PgDAP IV.",

The overall structure of PmDAP IV is clearly similar to that of SmDAP IV but differs from that of human DPP IV in several respects. The dipeptide complexes showed acyl-enzyme intermediates in the active site of PmDAP IV, whereas tetrahedral intermediates were reported for mammalian DPP IVs34,39,40. An active site Arg residue (Arg125 in human DPP IV) helps stabilise the tetrahedral intermediate in mammalian DPP IVs34,39,40 by interacting with the carbonyl group of the P1\u2032 residue, whereas the structurally corresponding Arg residue in bacterial DAP IVs (Arg106 in PmDAP IV) does not play such a role. These observations provide new insights into the substrate recognition mechanism of bacterial DAP IVs.",

The N-terminal region of PmDAP IV has a typical signal sequence of gram-negative bacteria and hence PmDAP IV exists as a soluble form in the periplasm11, while the mammalian DPP IV and FAP are type II transmembrane proteins25. The crystal structures of PmDAP IV in the ligand-free form and in complexes with dipeptides (Lys-Pro or Ile-Pro) and a non-peptidyl inhibitor (Inhibitor-1c) were determined at resolutions of 2.47, 1.90, 2.44 and 2.13 \u00c5, respectively (Tables 1 and 2). Representative electron density maps of the bound peptides and inhibitor are shown in Figure S1. The electron densities of the P2 side chains (Lys and Ile) are poorer than the P1-Pro residue covalently attached to the O\u03b3 atom of Ser613 (Figures S1A and S1C). These are consistent with the results of refinement that the temperature factors of the bound ligand atoms are higher for some flexible groups away from the acyl-intermediate bond. This is also true for the inhibitor complex (Figure S1D). In the present crystal structure analysis of the ligand-free PmDAP IV, the asymmetric unit comprises two dimers of PmDAP IV. Dimerisation is also observed in the crystal structure of mammalian DPP IVs31\u201334. The protruding anti-parallel \u03b2-sheet dimerisation interface reported for mammalian DPP IVs is also observed for PmDAP IV. This type of inter-subunit interaction has been found among several crystal forms of PmDAP IV (Table 1), indicating that such dimer formation is the natural state of PmDAP IV. The protomer of PmDAP IV consists of two domains separated by a deep cleft (Fig. 1B). One domain, containing the \u03b1/\u03b2 hydrolase fold harbouring the Asp-His-Ser catalytic triad, is responsible for catalysis; the second, \u03b2-propeller domain is the regulatory domain that is necessary for exopeptidase activity. A topology diagram of the PmDAP IV protomer is shown in Figure S2.",

One is a short helix between the first and second strands of blade 4. This helix contains a double-Glu motif, Glu208-Glu209, which forms salt bridges to the N-terminus of a peptide substrate (Fig. 3A). The other additional component in blade 4 is a protruding anti-parallel \u03b2-sheet between the second and third strands of blade 4 (Figure S2). The anti-parallel \u03b2-sheet acts as a dimerisation interface (Fig. 1A). A hairpin loop between the second and third strands of blade 2 containing Arg125 in human DPP IV, which can interact with the carbonyl group of a substrate peptide33,34, is replaced by a short turn in PmDAP IV (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, however, the side chain of Arg106 (located between blades 1 and 2 in PmDAP IV), which was disordered in the ligand-free form but was well defined in the peptide/inhibitor complexes (described later), appears to play a role equivalent to that of Arg125 in human DPP IV (Fig. 3C). Inter-domain contacts between the catalytic and \u03b2\u2013propeller domains are observed for blades 4 to 8 of the \u03b2\u2013propeller domain and the catalytic domain. Blades 1 to 3 of the \u03b2\u2013propeller domain have less contact with the catalytic domain (Fig. 1B) and appear to be more flexible than blades 4 to 8. The rms deviation between the \u03b2\u2013propeller domains of PmDAP IV and human DPP IV is 1.19 \u00c5 for 151 structurally equivalent C\u03b1 atoms, which had 19% sequence identity for that region, and the rms deviation between the \u03b2\u2013propeller domains of PmDAP IV and SmDAP IV is 0.82 \u00c5 for 333 structurally equivalent C\u03b1 atoms, which had 73% sequence identity for that region.

While the N-terminal product Lys-Pro remains at the active site, the C-terminal product Tyr dissociates from the active site. Interestingly, we observed that the tripeptide was cleaved but remained trapped as an acyl-enzyme intermediate. The O\u03b3 atom of Ser613 was found in close contact (1.4 \u00c5) with the carbonyl carbon of the scissile bond. To further explore our observation that the N-terminal dipeptide product was trapped as an acyl-enzyme intermediate, the dipeptide and the O\u03b3 atom of Ser613 were omitted from the model, and the structure was refined. The resultant omit electron density maps showed continuous electron density between the O\u03b3 atom of Ser613 and the carbonyl carbon of the scissile bond (Figure S1A). The asymmetric unit was composed of four independent PmDAP IV subunits; in three of the four subunits, the dipeptides were trapped as the acyl-enzyme intermediate, and in the remaining subunit, the hydrolysed dipeptide product (NH2-Lys-Pro-COOH) was observed (Figure S1B). Similarly, co-crystallisation of PmDAP IV with the tripeptide Ile-Pro-Ile, a well-known peptidyl DPP IV inhibitor, diprotin A42,43, resulted in the dipeptide Ile-Pro complex being trapped as an acyl-enzyme intermediate (Figure S1C). In the Ile-Pro complex, acyl-enzyme intermediates were observed for all four subunits in the asymmetric unit.",

            "text": "The dipeptide (Lys-Pro or Ile-Pro) complex structures clearly show the molecular basis for the peptide recognition mechanism of PmDAP IV. For simplicity, the following description refers primarily to subunit A of the 1.90-\u00c5-resolution structure of the Lys-Pro complex of PmDAP IV. The bound dipeptide was found in the inter-domain cleft (Fig. 5A). PmDAP IV hydrolyses peptides from the N-terminus of oligopeptides, cleaving dipeptide units (NH2-P2-P1-COOH) when the second P1 residue is Pro or Ala. To act as dipeptidyl aminopeptidase, PmDAP IV must fix the N-terminus of the substrate peptide in position. This task is performed primarily by the side chains of a double-Glu motif (Glu208-Glu209), which forms part of a short helix between the first and second strands of blade 4 of the \u03b2\u2013propeller domain. The double-Glu motif forms salt bridges to the N-terminus of the bound dipeptide. In addition, the side chain of Arg106, which is located between blades 1 and 2 of the \u03b2-propeller domain, forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl group of the P2 residue and also forms a salt bridge with the side chain of Glu208. The side chain of Asn691 also forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl group of the P2 residue. In the ligand-free form of PmDAP IV, residues 90\u2013109, which are located between blades 1 and 2 of the \u03b2-propeller domain, were disordered. The corresponding region in SmDAP IV is also disordered37. In the dipeptide complex of PmDAP IV, the electron density of residues 90\u2013109 was well defined and was interpreted as a short helix (Figure S3). The P1 Pro residue is accommodated in the S1 pocket, which comprises the side chains of Asn614, Val639, Trp642, Tyr645, Tyr649 and Val692. The side chain of the P2 Lys residue has less interaction with PmDAP IV and is surrounded by water molecules in the active site cleft. The carbonyl oxygen of the P1 residue is accommodated in the oxyanion hole and stabilised by hydrogen bonds with the main-chain imino group of Asn614 and the side-chain OH group of Tyr527. Similarly, an important role of the oxyanion hole (comprising the main-chain NH of Tyr631 and the side-chain OH of Tyr547) in the catalytic mechanism of human DPP IV has been reported44.",

The unbiased omit electron density map (Figure S1D) suggested that one nitrile group of the inhibitor is attacked by Ser613 to form a covalent bond. A similar covalent bond is also reported for the crystal structure analysis of human DPP IV in a complex with Inhibitor-1c, and imidate formation is confirmed by 13C-NMR45. The triple bond moiety of the other nitrile group stacks with the side chain of Tyr649. The pyrrolidine ring is accommodated in the S1 pocket (Asn614, Val639, Trp642, Tyr645, Tyr649 and Val692). The inhibitor moiety corresponding to a peptide P2 backbone is recognised by interactions from the side chains of Glu208 and Glu209 to the secondary amine group and from the side chains of Arg106 and Asn691 to the carbonyl group. The cyclopentane ring of the inhibitor has less contact with the active site, and this finding is consistent with the poorer electron density observed for the cyclopentane moiety compared with the pyrrolidine ring moiety (Figure S1D).",

The mutation of Arg106 to Ala resulted in a significant loss of activity (approximately 14% of the wild-type enzyme activity). This result indicates that Arg106 in PmDAP IV plays an important role in the recognition of the substrate peptide. Interestingly, the mutation of Arg106 to Lys also resulted in moderately decreased activities against the synthetic substrate (approximately 37% of the wild-type enzyme activity). These results indicate that both the positive charge and the strict binding mode provided by the side chain at position 106 are essential for the interaction with the carbonyl group of the substrate peptide and with the side chain of Glu208, as observed in the wild-type enzyme (Figs 3C and 5A).",

            "text": "In this study, we solved the crystal structures of a bacterial DPP IV, PmDAP IV, which specifically recognises a Pro/Ala residue at the P1 position of a substrate peptide. To better understand the substrate recognition mechanism of bacterial DAP IVs, we solved the structures of PmDAP IV in the presence of a peptide or an inhibitor. In the peptide complexes, the double-Glu motif, Glu208-Glu209, forms salt bridges to the N-terminus of the bound dipeptide. This interaction is essential for the exopeptidase activity of PmDAP IV. Interestingly, FAP has both dipeptidyl peptidase activity and endopeptidase activity25,36. Crystal structure of human FAP revealed one major difference in the vicinity of the double-Glu motif (Glu203-Glu204 for FAP) within the active site of the enzyme. Ala657 in FAP, instead of Asp663 as in human DPP IV, reduces the acidity in the N-terminus binding pocket, and this change could explain the lower affinity for N-terminal amines and endopeptidase activity of FAP36. For PmDAP IV, corresponding residue is Asp646 (Fig. 5), and this is consistent with our biochemical data that PmDAP IV has no endopeptidase activity7. The complex structures of PmDAP IV also revealed that the side chain of Arg106, which is located between blades 1 and 2 of the \u03b2-propeller domain, forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl group of the P2 residue of a substrate peptide and forms a salt bridge with the side chain of Glu208. In the ligand-free form of PmDAP IV and that of SmDAP IV37, a loop between blades 1 and 2 of the \u03b2-propeller domain, containing Arg106 in PmDAP IV, was disordered. The disordered loop region in the ligand-free form (residues 90\u2013109 containing Arg106; Fig. 4) was well defined and formed a short helix in the dipeptide/inhibitor-bound complexes. The corresponding region in mammalian DPP IVs is replaced by a short turn and is not involved in substrate recognition. Site-directed mutagenesis studies of Arg106 in PmDAP IV (Table 3) indicated that the Arg side chain is essential for substrate recognition and for fixing the side chain of Glu208, one of the side chains in the double-Glu motif. Residues between blades 1 and 2 of the \u03b2-propeller domain, containing Arg106 in PmDAP IV, are highly conserved in SmDAP IV (Figure S6). In contrast, the region of Arg125 in human DPP IV is conserved in P. gingivalis DPP IV (Figure S6). Thus, DPP IVs can be categorised into two groups: human DPP IV-type DPP IVs and SmDAP IV-type DAP IVs. A phylogenetic analysis of several DPP IVs supports this notion (Figure S7). As shown in Figure S7, PmDAP IV and SmDAP IV belong to the same cluster, whereas PgDPP IV belongs to a bacterial cluster that is distinct from the SmDAP IV-type cluster but is related to a vertebrate DPP IV cluster. Interestingly, the phylogenetic analysis revealed that human dipeptidyl peptidase 8 (DPP8) and human dipeptidyl peptidase 9 (DPP9), which are ubiquitously expressed soluble DPP IV-like enzymes25 having approximately 25% amino acid sequence identities with human DPP IV, belong to the bacterial DAP IV cluster rather than the vertebrate DPP IV cluster. On the other hand, another DPP IV-like enzyme, human FAP25 having approximately 50% amino acid sequence identity with human DPP IV belongs to the vertebrate DPP IV cluster. To confirm the result of phylogenetic analysis on DPP8, DPP9 and FAP, we compared the amino acid sequence of PmDAP IV and those of the four DPP IV-family enzymes25 (Fig. 6). It is clear that the region of Arg106 in PmDAP IV is conserved in human DPP8 and human DPP9, whereas the region of Arg125 in human DPP IV is conserved in human FAP. Thus, it may be said that PmDAP IV is a bacterial DPP8/DPP9, though the Arg125-type DAP IV has not yet been identified in P. mexicana. Another interesting structural difference between human DPP IV and PmDAP IV is that human DPP IV has prominent exposed loops in the \u03b2-propeller domain than does PmDAP IV (Fig. 3). In particular, insertions Ala291-Met293 (between blade-4 and blade-5) and Val341-Ala342 (the fourth strand of blade-5) specifically found in human DPP IV (Figs 3 and S6) are involved in interactions with other proteins, such as adenosine deaminase47 and bat coronavirus HKU4 receptor-binding domain48.",

            "text": "The catalytic mechanism of serine peptidases involves two tetrahedral intermediates49. Figure 7 shows a possible catalytic mechanism of PmDAP IV, essentially identical to that of DPP IV44 except for the role of arginine side chain described later. The oxyanion-containing tetrahedral intermediate (Fig. 7, stages (4) and (7)) is stabilised by the backbone NH group of Asn614 and the side-chain OH group of Tyr527, which generate a positively charged pocket known as the oxyanion hole44,50,51. In the present crystal structure analyses, an acyl-enzyme intermediate (Fig. 7, stage (6)) is obtained by co-crystallisation of PmDAP IV with the tripeptide Lys-Pro-Tyr, and the N-terminal product, Lys-Pro, remains at the active site, where it is stabilised by salt bridges to the double-Glu motif Glu208-Glu209; finally, the C-terminal product, Tyr, dissociates from the active site. The hydrolysed dipeptide product NH2-Lys-Pro-COOH (Fig. 7, stage (8)) was also observed (Figure S1B). As can be seen from Figure 5A, the active site of acyl-intermediate complex of PmDAP IV has enough space near His721 to accommodate the nucleophilic water, although it could not be identified in the present crystal structure analyses. Interestingly, a similar acyl-enzyme intermediate is observed for PmDAP IV co-crystallised with the tripeptide, Ile-Pro-Ile, a well-known peptidyl DPP IV inhibitor, diprotin A42,43, resulting in a dipeptide Ile-Pro complex (Figure S1C).",

            "text": "In the complex of human DPP IV with the inhibitor diprotin A, a tetrahedral intermediate (Fig. 7, stage (4)), rather than an acyl-enzyme intermediate, was observed34. The bound diprotin A molecule is stabilised by hydrophobic interactions and a large network of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds. The N-terminus of the tripeptide interacts with the double-Glu motif (Glu205-Glu206), and the C-terminus interacts with Arg125 in human DPP IV. Notably, a non-covalent diprotin A complex has also been reported for human DPP IV52. In that case, Arg125 interacts with the carbonyl oxygen of the P1\u2032-Ile residue and is responsible for fixing the conformation of the diprotin A molecule. Thus, the role of Arg125 is consistent in the covalent34 and the non-covalent52 diprotin A complexes in human DPP IV. A similar tetrahedral intermediate was reported for human DPP IV when complexed with the deca-peptide tNPY39. In the tNPY complex, a similar network of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds is observed. The carbonyl group of the third residue (P1\u2032-residue) is stabilised by Arg125. Such an Arg-O = C interaction is present only for tripeptides or longer peptides and would prevent the release of leaving residues (P1\u2032-P2\u2032-) by stabilising the observed tetrahedral intermediate. In tripeptides or longer peptides, the negatively charged P1\u2032 carboxylate (or carbonyl) group electrostatically stabilises the positively charged catalytic His740, thereby preventing transfer of its proton to the nitrogen atom on the released group (the N-terminus of the P1\u2032 residue). Consequently, the C(P1)\u2013N(P1\u2032) bond cannot be cleaved, and the P1\u2032 residue cannot leave from the active site of mammalian DPP IV40.",

Therefore, Arg106 plays a role in stabilising the acyl-enzyme intermediate (Fig. 7, stage (6)), as observed in this study, rather than stabilizing the tetrahedral intermediate (Fig. 7, stage (4)), as observed for human DPP IV complexes34,39,40. To examine whether Arg106 in PmDAP IV is involved in recognition of the P1\u2032-residue, we tested the inhibitory activity of diprotin A against the enzymatic activity of PmDAP IV (Table 5). The results showed that diprotin A is a good inhibitor of PmDAP IV. The comparable or stronger inhibitory activity of diprotin A against PmDAP IV, compared with that against human DPP IV (Table 5), indicates that the poorer interaction of the P1\u2032 residue of diprotin A with PmDAP IV does not affect the inhibitory activity of diprotin A. Thus, the crystallographically observed covalently bonded interactions, the acyl-enzyme intermediate observed for PmDAP IV co-crystallised with diprotin A in this study (Figure S1C) and the tetrahedral intermediates observed for mammalian DPP IVs co-crystallised with diprotin A34,39 are essential structural factors related to the inhibitory activity of diprotin A.",

For mammalian DPP IVs, it was proposed that the tunnel of the \u03b2-propeller and the side opening, respectively, provide substrate access to and product release from the active site of DPP IV31. However, crystal structure analyses of human DPP IV complexed with a decapeptide39 or a nonapeptide53 suggested that the side opening is the entrance to the active site because the bound peptides are oriented with the N-terminus facing the active site and with the C-terminus facing the side opening. MD simulations demonstrated that the side opening is more likely to be the pathway of product release than the \u03b2-propeller tunnel based on quantitative comparisons of force and work together with potentials of mean force between the two routes54. Thus, the side-in and side-out model is more plausible than the propeller-in and side-out model for mammalian DPP IVs.",

            "text": "In this crystal structure analysis of PmDAP IV, conformational differences were observed between the dipeptide- and an inhibitor-bound forms compared with the ligand-free form (Fig. 4). These observations are clearly different from the crystal structure analyses of mammalian DPP IVs, in which large-scale conformational differences have not yet been reported. It should be noted that an open form of a microbial prolyl oligopeptidase (POP), which shares a certain sequence homology to DPP IV, was reported55, such that large substrates could enter through the side opening. However, it is thought that POPs do not possess a DPP IV-equivalent side opening; thus, their internal cavity seems to be accessible only via the \u03b2-propeller tunnel56. The structures obtained here provide insights into the possible routes for substrate binding and product release for PmDAP IV. Regarding substrate access, the route from the tunnel of the \u03b2-propeller is unlikely. For the substrate to access the active site from the \u03b2-propeller tunnel, the peptide must adopt an energetically unfavourable, umbrella handle-shaped conformation, with the N-terminus facing the tip of the handle (towards the double-Glu motif) and with the C-terminus facing the body of the handle (in the tunnel) (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the access route from the side opening provides no impediment. For product release, egress from the side opening appears easy, but we cannot exclude the \u03b2-propeller tunnel route. In the dipeptide- or inhibitor-bound forms of PmDAP IV, the inter-domain cleft of PmDAP IV is relatively closed, and the bound peptide/inhibitor is buried in the active site and is not exposed to the solvent (Figs 1B and 5). The reaction product cannot exit from the active site without a closed-to-open conformational change. Thus, the product may exit from the active site (i) via the \u03b2-propeller tunnel without such a conformational change or (ii) via the side opening after such a conformational change. Finally, although the side-in and side-out model is highly possible, the side-in and propeller-out model cannot be excluded for bacterial DAP IVs. Notably, one of the four subunits (molecule B) in the asymmetric unit of the ligand-free crystal of PmDAP IV showed a relatively closed conformation, as observed for the dipeptide/inhibitor-bound complexes. The rms deviation between the molecule B of the ligand-free PmDAP IV and the molecule A of the Lys-Pro complex of PmDAP IV is 0.40 \u00c5 for all 724 C\u03b1 atoms. The disordered loop region in the molecules A, C and D of the ligand-free form (residues 90\u2013109 containing Arg106) was well defined in the molecule B and the residues 96\u2013105 formed a short helix as observed in the dipeptide/inhibitor complexes. The conformation around the short helix of the molecule B of the ligand-free form and that of the molecule A of the Lys-Pro complex is quite similar to each other (Figure S8), whereas relative flexibilities of the residues 90\u2013109 estimated from temperature factors were significantly higher for the molecule B of the ligand-free form (average B-factor for whole molecule vs. that for residues 90\u2013109: 36.3 \u00c52 vs 48.7 \u00c52 for the molecule B of the ligand-free form and 20.3 \u00c52 vs. 22.8 \u00c52 for the molecule A of the Lys-Pro complex). This observation indicates that an open-to-closed conformational change of the protomer of PmDAP IV does occur without ligand binding, and a mechanism of \u201cconformational selection\u201d57,58 would exist for the substrate-binding stage of PmDAP IV.",

            "text": "To clarify the differences in active site architecture between PmDAP IV and mammalian DPP IV, we compared the inhibitory activities of the three classes of gliptins46 (Figure S5) against PmDAP IV and human DPP IV (Table 4). In general, the inhibitory activities of gliptins against human DPP IV (the order of nM) are overwhelmingly high compared to those against PmDAP IV (the order of \u00b5M). This is not unnatural because the structures of gliptins are optimised for binding with human DPP IV but not for bacterial DAP IVs. The difference might partly be due to less hydrophobic property at the bottom of the S1 subsite of PmDAP IV: Leu598 and Tyr631 in human DPP IV is replaced by Gln581 and Asn614, respectively, in PmDAP IV (Figure S7). The results showed that class 2 gliptins have significantly weaker inhibitory activities against PmDAP IV than class 1 and class 3 gliptins. It should be noted here that omarigliptin exhibited lower inhibitory activity against PmDAP IV as compared with the other class 3 gliptins. This can be explained by a structural feature of omarigliptin. As shown in Figure S5, omarigliptin has less rotatable bond than the other class 3 gliptins. Therefore, omarigliptin can\u2019t fit well into the active site of PmDAP IV. The gliptin sensitivity of PmDAP IV can be explained by structurally comparing the subsites of PmDAP IV with that of human DPP IV in complex with linagliptin59 (Fig. 8A). Compared with human DPP IV, residues 542 to 545 of PmDAP IV protrude more into the S2\u2032 subsite (Fig. 2), causing a narrowing of this site; thus, this region would hinder the binding of class 2 gliptins to PmDAP IV (Fig. 8B). In contrast to the S2\u2032 subsite, the S2-extensive subsite of PmDAP IV is clearly larger than that of human DPP IV. The space occupied by residues 356 to 358 in human DPP IV is not occupied by protein residues in PmDAP IV (Fig. 8A), indicating that inhibitors occupying this space might be selective inhibitors of bacterial DAP IVs (Fig. 8B). A structural comparison of PgDPP IV and human DPP IV also revealed that the S2-extensive subsite of PgDPP IV is larger than that of human DPP IV38. Sitagliptin, a class 3 gliptin, is well-known as a highly selective DPP IV inhibitor60. Crystal structure analyses of human DPP IV in complexes with class 3 gliptins61\u201364 revealed that the most important interaction between gliptins and human DPP IV for their strict DPP IV selectivity (over DPP IV-family enzymes; FAP, DPP8 and DPP9) is a hydrophobic (pi-pi) interaction between the side chain of Phe357 and the inhibitor at the S2-extensive site. By utilising the S2 extensive subsite of human DPP IV, class 3 gliptins can increase not only their inhibitory activity against human DPP IV but also their selectivity over the other DPP IV-family enzymes. Specifically, PmDAP IV (and probably DPP8 and DPP9) cannot have sufficient hydrophobic interactions with the class 3 inhibitors at the S2-extensive site, whereas FAP does not have enough space at the S2-extensive site because Phe350 of FAP partially occupies the S2-extensive site (Fig. 8). Present structural comparisons can be applied for describing gliptin sensitivities of DPP8 and DPP9, though crystal structures of DPP8 and DPP9 have not yet been reported. DPP8 and DPP9 are known to be inhibited by class 1 gliptins (vildagliptin and saxagliptin) in vitro60, because the active site center (the S1 and S2 subsites) of DPP IV-family enzymes are highly conserved (Figure S7), except for Arg125 region (Figure S7). On the other hand, lengths and sequences around the S2\u2032 and S2-extensive sites are less conserved as can be expected from lower sequence identity between DPP8/DPP9 and DPP IV (approximately 25%) compared with that between FAP and DPP IV (approximately 50%). Therefore, the lower sensitivities of DPP8/DPP9 against class 2 and 3 gliptins are likely to be due to structural differences around the S2\u2032 and S2-extensive sites (Fig. 8B).",

The crystal structure analyses and site-directed mutagenesis studies revealed a novel substrate recognition mechanism, which is possibly common to SmDAP IV-type bacterial DPP IVs but is not observed in mammalian DPP IVs. Acyl-enzyme intermediates were observed for the dipeptide complexes of PmDAP IV, whereas tetrahedral intermediates were reported for the oligopeptide complexes of mammalian DPP IVs. This difference reflects the different structural environments of the active-site Arg residues of the mammalian and bacterial enzymes.

The PmDAP IV M12I mutant produced only the 82-kDa periplasmic form (residues 23\u2013745) due to translation from Met1 and removal of the signal sequence (residues 1\u201322)11. The periplasmic form of PmDAP IV comprised 723 amino acids, with a theoretical molecular weight of 79981.58 and a theoretical isoelectric point of 5.80. An E. coli JM109 (Takara Bio) transformant harbouring the full-length PmDAP IV M12I mutant sequence inserted into the pUC19 (Takara Bio) expression plasmid was used to produce the periplasmic form of PmDAP IV. Cells were grown in 2 x YT media at 310 K. Overproduction of PmDAP IV was performed by IPTG induction (final concentration, 0.1 mM) at an OD600 of approximately 0.6. Sixteen hours after induction, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8000 x g. The cells were disrupted using BugBuster Protein Extraction Reagent (Novagen), and the cell extract was obtained by centrifugation at 27,000 x g for 30 min. PmDAP IV in the cell extract was purified using 35 to 70% ammonium sulphate precipitation and hydrophobic column chromatography using a 20-ml HiPrep 16/10 Butyl column (GE Healthcare), which was desalted using a 50-ml HiPrep 26/10 desalting column (GE Healthcare) and finally subjected to anion-exchange column chromatography using a 1-ml Mono Q 5/50 GL column (GE Healthcare). The fractions containing PmDAP IV were pooled, and the buffer was exchanged to 80 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5 and concentrated to 10 mg/ml using a Vivaspin 20 concentrator (GE Healthcare). The protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay and a bovine serum albumin as a standard (Bio-Rad Laboratories).

Kinetic parameters were determined by fitting the experimental data to the Michaelis\u2013Menten equation using Excel Solver (Microsoft) by nonlinear least squares fitting for different concentrations (0.78, 1.56, 3.13, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 and 100 \u00b5M) of glycyl-L-proline 4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide (Gly-Pro-MCA, Peptide Institute) as a substrate. The enzyme reaction was performed in a reaction buffer containing 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA and 0.005% Tween 20 at 298 K for 20 min, and standard deviations were calculated from three independent experiments. The fluorescence intensity of the released MCA was measured with excitation at 355 nm and emission at 460 nm using an Infinite 200 PRO microplate reader (TECAN).
