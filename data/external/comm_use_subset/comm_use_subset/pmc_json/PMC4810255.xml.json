The likelihood of possible transmission of these pathogens to humans is ever increasing as a result of human encroachment on animal habitats, climate change and change of human behaviour. Pathogens of particular public health importance are filoviruses [1,2], coronaviruses [3,4], paramyxoviruses [5,6] and lyssaviruses [7,8]. Other viruses, without a known human disease link, have also been detected recently [9,10,11]. Some human pathogens, such as Rift Valley fever virus, that have been detected in bats were likely a result of coincidental infection and do not constitute proof that bats play a role as reservoirs [12].",

Both bat fly families are hematophagous and potentially capable of mechanical or biological pathogen transmission.

            "text": "Reoviridae is a large and diverse family comprised of non-enveloped viruses containing segmented, double stranded (ds) RNA genomes and consists of two sub-families, Sedoreovirinae and Spinareovirinae [19]. The Orthoreovirus genus is in the Spinareovirinae sub-family and consists of five formally recognized species: Avian orthoreovirus, Baboon orthoreovirus, Nelson bay orthoreovirus,\nReptilian orthoreovirus and Mammalian orthoreovirus, the type species. The Nelson Bay species group consists of viruses isolated from or associated with flying foxes [20,21,22,23], whilst several mammalian orthoreoviruses have also been isolated from bats [24,25]. Broome virus, a fusogenic virus isolated from a flying fox, has been proposed as the sixth orthoreovirus species based on its sequence divergence from other viruses in the genus [26]. Another proposed new species, Wild bird orthoreovirus, consists of three viruses that form a distinct clade from other avian orthoreoviruses [27]. A reovirus has been isolated from an aborted Stellar sea lion that groups in a clade with avian reoviruses and Nelson bay orthoreovirus [28]. Orthoreovirus infection in different hosts results in a variety of disease symptoms, including arthritis, pneumonia, neurological disease and acute respiratory illness [22,23,29,30,31]. Some bat-associated viruses in the Orthoreovirus genus, such as Melaka, Kampar and Nelson Bay orthoreoviruses, have been linked to human disease, usually of a respiratory nature and capable of limited human-to-human transmission [22,23,32,33]. Orthoreoviruses are thought to only infect vertebrates, based on the current known host range for the genus.",

The publicly available reovirus sequences used in the analysis were obtained from NCBI-Nucleotide (Genbank). Nucleotide sequences from a small number of viruses from each genus in the Reoviridae family were used to prepare a Maximum Likelihood tree showing the placement of MAHLV in the family based on the full RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) encoding segment. Maximum Likelihood trees were prepared using amino acid sequences of all open reading frames from all segments, showing the placement of Mahlapitsi virus (MAHLV) in the Orthoreovirus genus relative to other viruses in this genus for which sequence is available on Genbank. Virus sequence accession numbers are summarised in Table 1. The evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the JTT matrix-based model [43]. The tree with the highest log likelihood is shown. The percentage of trees in which the associated taxa clustered together is shown next to the branches (1000 bootstrap iterations). Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were obtained by applying the Neighbor-Joining method to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using a JTT model. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA6 [42]. Open reading frames were located and deduced protein amino acid sequences prepared by using the CLC Genomics Workbench (Qiagen). Putative functions of the new virus deduced proteins were determined by BLASTx similarity searches to sequences available on Genbank.",

Presence of MAHLV in the original homogenates from which the isolates were obtained was confirmed by SISPA amplification and NGS directly from the homogenates.

The L1 segment of MAHLV contains two AUG start codons in close proximity to the 5' end, at positions 14 and 19. The first start codon (position 14) complies with Kozak\u2019s rule (ACTAUGG) and initiates an open reading frame 3885 nucleotides in length, putatively coding for Lambda A protein which is a core structural protein with NTPase, helicase and dsRNA binding ability. The second start codon (position 19) does not comply with Kozak\u2019s rule (TGGAUGG); it initiates a 402 nucleotide open reading frame but the deduced amino acid sequence does not match any known viral protein of note on Genbank. The M2 segment contains two AUG codons at positions 29 and 169, both complying with Kozak\u2019s rule (ACGAUGG and AGCAUGG).

The deduced Sigma A protein of MAHLV (segment S1) contains the fusogenic orthoreovirus-wide conserved arginine amino acid at position 273. The S4 segment is bicistronic and encodes for a 14 kDa protein similar to p14 membrane fusion protein of Bush viper reovirus and a non-overlapping 18 kDa protein similar to p16 non-structural protein of Baboon orthoreovirus without a known function (Table 4). The isoelectric point of MAHLV p18 is acidic (5.02), similar to that of p16 of Broome virus and Baboon orthoreovirus and contrary to that of other orthoreoviruses. The first ten amino acids in the putative 14 kDa protein of MAHLV are identical to the first ten amino acids in the p13 fusion protein of Broome virus and represent the myristoylation consensus sequence required for fusion activity of the protein. The S4 segment does not encode a cell attachment protein, an observation also characteristic of Broome virus and Baboon orthoreovirus.",

The most notable viruses in which natural transmission from bats have been implicated include filoviruses, coronaviruses, paramyxoviruses, herpesviruses, lyssaviruses and bunyaviruses. The implication of bats in transmission or maintenance of some of these viruses is very circumstantial and often based only on serological evidence. More convincing evidence for others is based on detection of viral nucleic acid and isolation of live virus, although this does not conclusively prove that a vertebrate host is a reservoir. Finding pathogens in bats leads to the questions of how they are transmitted between bats, and from bats to incidental hosts such as humans. One possible transmission mechanism could be bat-associated hematophagous arthropods, such as the bat flies, but migration of parasites between bats is not well understood and would require further entomological investigation to better understand [13].",

The two isolates are not identical but similar enough to suggest that they are merely two isolates of the same virus. This suggests that there are multiple variants of the virus present in the host population. Members of a species within the Orthoreovirus genus are usually identified by a number of characteristics: amino acid and nucleotide sequence identity, organization of the polycistronic genome segment and host species [19]. For conserved core proteins, an amino acid identity >85% for homologous proteins indicates that two viruses belong to the same species, while identity <65% indicates a possible new species. When comparing the amino acid sequence of more divergent outer capsid proteins, >55% identity indicates one species and <35% indicates different species. Nucleic acid sequence identity of homologous segments of >75% indicates the same species and <60% a new species. The nature of conserved genome segment termini sequences of orthoreoviruses is also useful for virus classification [45]. The divergence of MAHLV sequence from other known orthoreoviruses combined with a unique conserved 5\u2019 genome segment end and a unique host species, suggests that this is a new virus species in this genus. Along with Broome virus and Baboon orthoreovirus, MAHLV is the third orthoreovirus that lacks an identified cell attachment protein in the S4 segment. This unique characteristic further strengthens the phylogenetic classification which places these viruses in a separate clade and suggests that entry of these viruses into cells is mediated differently than for other orthoreoviruses.",

Considering the rich diversity of bat species found on the continent and increased scientific interest in this field, this is unlikely to be the only such virus to be isolated from bat ectoparasites in years to come. However, to our knowledge this is the first orthoreovirus to be isolated from an arthropod host, since all currently known viruses in this genus are associated with vertebrates. MAHLV did not replicate on C6-36 cells in this study but Aedes albopictus, from which the C6-36 cell line is derived, is classified in a completely different dipteran family, the Culicidae, likely pointing to a cell receptor incompatibility.

Any risk of human infection for now, however, is only likely in individuals who come into close contact with wild Egyptian fruit bats and their ectoparasites. Although highly host-dependent, the bat flies have been noted to leave their bat hosts and crawl on bat researchers (personal observation). Respiratory disease has been noted in humans infected with Melaka, Kampar and Nelson bay orthoreovirus, including limited human-to-human transmission [22,23,32,33].
