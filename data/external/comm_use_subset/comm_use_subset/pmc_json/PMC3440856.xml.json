Plaque rupture with the formation of an occlusive thrombus is the cause of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) [2]. Inflammatory cells, involving activated neutrophils, are more frequently found in plaques vulnerable to rupture [3]. Neutrophil activation has been reported in unstable angina (UA) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) but not in patients with stable angina (SA) [4\u201310]. This activation seems to precede myocardial injury in patients with AMI [11]. Therefore biomarkers of neutrophil activation could be of prognostic and even diagnostic importance. ",

Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to calculate the area under the curve (AUC) and define cutoff points. Cutoff values were chosen after cost-benefit analysis.

This view is further supported by the observation that similar neutrophil NGAL/MMP-9 overexpression can be found in atherosclerotic plaques, particularly those with intramural haemorrhagic debris and central necrosis [15, 22]. The above evidence supports the clinical observations that high-circulating leucocyte (particularly neutrophil) counts are independent predictors of recurrent ischaemic attacks. This may be explained by their presence in the necrotic core of unstable plaques and by their proteolytic activity towards atherosclerotic tissue and secondary mobilization of thromboembolic fragments [23]. The evidence derived from these experimental studies, showing the close link between neutrophils, their products and the natural history of atherosclerosis, and its complications, generated clinical studies that investigated the clinical utility of serum-NGAL measurements.

The expression of NGAL from vascular cells during atherogenesis can also explain the differences between patients with SA and control subjects with no risk factors observed in our study. In addition to its induction in the vessels after mechanistic injury, previous studies suggest that NGAL is strongly upregulated in atherosclerotic lesions and also in the heart after ischemic injury [15].

Infiltrating macrophages and neutrophils participate in the transformation of stable coronary artery plaques to unstable lesions with a thin fibrous cap [27]. It has been repeatedly reported that thrombosed plaques were densely infiltrated by neutrophils and macrophages [28, 29]. Macrophages and neutrophils and some other types of leukocytes produce various proteolytic enzymes which facilitate the rupture of plaques by thinning and weakening their normally thick and firm cap [30, 31]. NGAL is one protein, that is, produced not only by the distressed kidney but also by activated neutrophils and by the vascular wall cells. Recent studies have shown that neutrophils are the main source of NGAL in blood [32, 33].",

Besides neutrophils, NGAL is also expressed by epithelial cells, renal tubular cells, and hepatocytes during inflammation or injury [37\u201339]. Our data agree with the above studies since we found a positive correlation between levels of serum-NGAL and systemic inflammation (expressed by the serum hs-CRP levels and neutrophil count), and also serum levels of NGAL were higher in patients with ACS than with SA. The higher levels of serum-NGAL observed in patients with ACS compared to SA could be explained by the fact that neutrophil activation is present only in patients with acute coronary events (10,11). Also, our results, as far as patients with SA and AMI, are similar with the findings of a recent published study which showed that the plasma level of NGAL is higher in patients with AMI compared with the patients with stable CAD [40].",
