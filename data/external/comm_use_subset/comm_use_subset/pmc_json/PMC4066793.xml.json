            "text": "Programmed ribosomal -1 frameshifting (PRF-1) has been recognized more than 25 years ago as a mode of translational control of specific genes, first in retroviruses (1\u20133) and later in bacterial genes (4,5). Since then the number of demonstrated or suspected cases, has greatly increased, generally through homology searches, or by taking advantage of the many sequenced genomes to look for genes containing potential frameshift signals (6,7). For example, the Recode database (8) has 245 entries for -1 frameshifting originating from eukaryotic viruses (192 cases), from transposable elements (31 cases, 6 bacterial and 25 eukaryotic), from bacteriophages (12 cases) and from chromosomal genes (10 cases). Overall, 219 entries come from eukaryotic genes. This may give the impression that -1 frameshifting is less common in prokaryotes, but it is not necessarily true. Analysis of the ISFinder database (9), dedicated to bacterial transposable elements called insertion sequences (IS), showed that more than 500 IS elements very likely use -1 frameshifting to synthesize the proteins necessary for their mobility (10). Another bioinformatics study carried out on 973 bacterial genomes revealed more than 5000 genes that probably use -1 frameshifting (11). These genes can be grouped into a limited number of clusters most of which correspond to IS elements. Although, like their eukaryotic counterparts, most bacterial genes likely using programmed -1 frameshifting are found in mobile elements, such as IS transposons or bacteriophages (12), utilization of -1 frameshifting may not be limited to them. Another study revealed a set of 146 prokaryotic gene families with various potential programmed frameshifts, several of which were experimentally tested (13,14). Most of these families correspond to non-mobile genes encoding proteins of known functions and proteins with conserved domains performing yet unknown functions. Sequences of genes from these clusters are available from GenTack database (13).",

            "text": "The execution of frameshifting at a significant level requires a relatively simple signal which is embedded within the coding part of certain mRNAs (Figure 1). The two components of this signal were revealed by the earlier studies on retroviruses (1\u20133). The obligatory component is a short sequence of 7 nucleotides, X_XX.Z_ZZ.N, called the frameshift motif or \u2018slippery\u2019 motif, where XXX and ZZZ, are triplets of identical bases, and N is any nucleotide (underscoring separates codons in frame with the initiation codon, i.e. frame 0, and dots separate codons in the new frame, i.e. frame -1). Thus, there are 64 possible sequences corresponding to the above definition. It was also shown that an even shorter sequence, a Z_ZZ.N tetramer (where ZZZ are three identical bases, thus leading to 16 possible motifs), could also direct programmed -1 frameshifting (15\u201321). The\u2018slipperiness\u2019 of both types of motifs likely results from their capacity to allow cognate or near cognate re-pairing in the -1 frame of one or two tRNAs (2,22). On an X_XX.Z_ZZ.N heptamer, the XXZ- and ZZN-decoding tRNAs, respectively, in the P and A sites of the ribosome, would break the codon\u2013anticodon interaction and re-pair on the XXX and ZZZ codons in the -1 frame. The second component of frameshift signals is a stimulatory element which, by itself, cannot induce frameshifting. It can be an RNA secondary structure, such as simple or branched hairpin-type stem-loop (HP) or a pseudoknot (PK) (23\u201325). As illustrated in panels C and D of Figure 2, it is formed by local folding of the mRNA and generally starts 5\u20138 nucleotides downstream of the slippery sequence (17,23,26). The stimulatory effect of a structure may be linked to its capacity to block ribosomes transiently when the ZZN codon occupies the A site and thus give more time to tRNAs for re-pairing (27\u201329). In addition, a structure may exert a pulling effect on the mRNA and favour its realignment within the ribosome to bring the XXX and ZZZ -1 frame codons in the P and A sites (30,31). It is present in all well-studied eukaryotes cases, often as a PK, but not always found in prokaryotes PRF-1 regions (10). Prokaryotic signals sometimes possess another type of stimulatory element upstream of the frameshift motif: a Shine\u2013Dalgarno (SD)-like sequence normally involved in translation initiation through pairing with the CCUCC sequence at the 3\u2032 end of 16S ribosomal RNA (32\u201334). In PRF-1 signals, the same interaction occurs but within an elongating ribosome and results in a translational pausing (35), which may provide a longer time window for tRNA re-pairing. The other possible effect of a stimulatory SD is linked to its distance from the motif which could generate a tension between the mRNA and the ribosome that could be resolved by realigning the mRNA (32). Thus, the two types of stimulators could act in concert by generating pausing, for both, and by pushing (SD) or pulling (structure) on the mRNA. In addition, frameshifting frequency in eukaryotes and prokaryotes is modulated by the immediate context on both sides of the slippery motif (36\u201338). It is not yet clear by which mechanism(s) this modulation operates but it could result in part from an E site tRNA effect (38), from intra-mRNA interactions (36) and possibly from mRNA\u2013ribosome interactions within the message entry tunnel (39).",

An early study dealt with the motif present in the Rous sarcoma virus signal (2). Mutating it to a limited set of different motifs lead to the proposal of basic rules governing X_XX.Z_ZZ.N heptamers frameshifting efficiency for eukaryotes: in short, substantial frameshifting is attained if XXX = [AAA, GGG or UUU], ZZZ = [AAA or UUU] and N = [A, C or U]. A subsequent nearly systematic analysis confirmed these rules: 44 motifs were tested and the 20 remaining motifs were not included because of their expected inefficiency (see upper panel of Supplementary Figure S1A) (17). Thus, only a subset of the 64 possible X_XX.Z_ZZ.N heptamers can elicit frameshifting at a significant level in higher eukaryotes.",

It turned out that the most proficient motifs, the X_XX.A_AA.G heptamers, were the least efficient ones in eukaryotes. Conversely, the best eukaryotic motifs proved inefficient in E. coli (e.g. A_AA.A_AA.C or G_GG.A_AA.A), thus indicating major differences in the response of the respective translational machineries to these signals. However, the limited scope of these studies, in terms of number of motifs tested, did not allow the establishment of precise rules concerning slippery heptamers efficiency in bacteria. The first aim of the work presented here is to determine these rules by carrying out a complete functional analysis in E. coli of both types of potential frameshift motifs, the Z_ZZ.N tetramers and X_XX.Z_ZZ.N heptamers. The second objective is to investigate, by bioinformatics approaches, the prevalence of the X_XX.Z_ZZ.N motifs in 37 enterobacterial genomes, mostly from E. coli isolates, in order to determine whether or not they have been selected against in coding sequences because of their frameshifting proclivity. Our third aim is to identify genes possibly utilizing -1 programmed frameshifting by analysing, in the same set of genomes, those containing a subset of 21 heptamers, which were chosen on the basis of their -1 frameshifting efficiency and/or their significant underrepresentation.",

Overlapping oligonucleotides were inserted between the HindIII and ApaI sites of the vector to reconstitute the various frameshift regions in front of the lacZ gene so that expression of \u03b2-galactosidase requires a -1 ribosomal frameshifting event within the cloned cassette. For each type of frameshift region (i.e. no stimulator, IS911 stimulators or IS3 stimulators, see Figure 2B\u2013D), an in-frame construct was made to serve as 100% reference for calculation of frameshifting frequencies from \u03b2-galactosidase activities. A non-shifty derivative was constructed for each motif to assess the background level of frameshifting. The rationale was to keep the same tRNA in the A site (Z_ZZ.N motifs) or in both A and P sites (X_XX.Z_ZZ.N motifs).

We limited our search to hairpin structures and and did not explore whether some of the structures could also form PKs at this preliminary stage. For each sequence of all clusters, a 197 nt segment starting at the fourth base after the motif was extracted and analysed with a custom Perl script. Each segment was first deleted from the 3\u2032 end one base at a time and down to 17 nt. Each set of nested deletions was passed to the RNAfold program and the potential structures were sorted out to retain those conforming to the rules. For a given cluster, structures were grouped in types according to hairpin size and distance from the motif.

To assess that, a 197 nt segment starting 4 nt downstream of the frameshift motif was extracted for each of the 20 ISs as well as for one typical sequence of each of the 53 clusters with a conserved structure. For each 197 nt segment, a Perl script generated a subset of sequences by moving (1 nt at a time) a sliding window of the size of the corresponding conserved hairpin and passed it to RNAfold. The average \u0394Gunfold.nt-1 (\u0394Gav.nt\u22121) were calculated for each subset as well as the \u0394\u0394G.nt\u22121 which is the difference [(\u0394Ghp.nt\u22121) \u2212 (\u0394Gav.nt\u22121)]. As expected, the 20 ISs possessing a stimulatory structure all display a higher than average \u0394\u0394G.nt\u22121 (Supplementary Table S8).",

Simple rules emerge when the effect of the ZZN codon is considered (Figure 4). The UUN and AAN codons are on the average more frameshift-prone than CCN and GGN. Whatever Z is, the two homogeneous ZZN codons (meaning all purine or all pyrimidine bases) are better shifters than the two corresponding heterogeneous ones. To explain further all the variations in frameshifting frequency, it is also necessary to take into account the nature of the X nucleotide. Motifs are by and large more frameshift-prone when the X and Z nucleotides are homogeneous, i.e. all purines or all pyrimidines. Notable exceptions to the latter rule are Y_YY.A_AA.R and R_RR.U_UU.Y (with Y = [U, C], R = [A, G]). Here, the high shiftiness of the AAR and UUY codons probably counteracts the negative effect of the YYA and RRU heterogenous codons.",

To determine the range of motifs used in genes utilizing frameshifting for their expression, we carried out an analysis of IS mobile genetics elements known, or suspected, to use this mode of translational control. We focused on the members of the IS1 and IS3 families available in the ISFinder database in October 2012 (9). As shown in Figure 5, both tetramers and heptamers are found, but with a marked preference for heptamers (87 against 403). Among the five tetramers, the three most shift-prone motifs, A_AA.G and U_UU.[U,C], predominate and the less efficient A_AA.A motif is also well represented. Only 16 different heptamers are found with 72% of them being either A_AA.A_AA.G or A_AA.A_AA.A. The next most frequent are A_AA.A_AA.C and G_GG.A_AA.C, both of low efficiency, followed by the more efficient G_GG.A_AA.G, U_UU.U_UU.C and G_GG.A_AA.A. To conclude, it appears that genes known or suspected to use PRF-1 to express a biologically important protein do not necessarily utilize high efficiency motifs. However, this conclusion is based on one category of genes where two overlapping genes code for the proteins required for transposition of two types of IS elements. There, the purpose of frameshifting is to provide the \u2018right\u2019 amount of a fusion protein which has the transposase function (18,52); this amount is what keeps transposition of the IS at a level without negative effect on the bacterial host. If the \u2018right\u2019 amount is a low amount, then the use of low-efficiency motifs, with or without flanking stimulators, is a way to achieve this goal as illustrated by the IS1 element (53).",

The rationale was that if a given motif induces by itself frameshifting at a significant level (i.e. at a biologically detrimental level), then it should be counterselected and, therefore, be underrepresented in E. coli genes.\nGeneration of a non-redundant nrMEG. In a recent study, 61 bacterial genomes, including strains of E. coli, Shigella and Salmonella, were compared to identify gene families that are conserved across all the genomes (core-genome; 993 families) and gene families which are specific to a particular genome (pan-genome; 15 741 families) (54). Our initial data set is somewhat inspired by this study. Sequences of all protein coding genes from 37 genomes (28 E. coli, 1 E. fergusonii, 7 Shigella and 1 Salmonella; Refseq accessions were available for only 37 genomes from the 61 mentioned in the study; see Supplementary Table S1) were first combined in a single file set, comprising 169 302 sequences, to form what we call a MEG. Sequences which shared more than 95% identity were clustered together to remove redundancy and only one representative sequence (randomly chosen) from each of these clusters was retained. This resulted in a significantly smaller nrMEG of 22 703 sequences.Frequency of occurrences of heptameric patterns in the nrMEG. The frequency of occurrences of each of the 64 X_XXZ_ZZN patterns in the nrMEG was determined. Additionally, the frequency of occurrences of the same pattern in the two other frames (XX_XXZ_ZN and XXX_ZZZ_N) was also determined. As a result, a total of 192 frequency counts (64 \u00d7 3) were obtained for the nrMEG.Randomization of the nrMEG. To determine whether adverse selection acting on a heptamer is due to their shifty properties and not due to other selective pressures such as mutational bias, codon usage or compositional bias of protein sequences, it is necessary to estimate how other selective pressures affect heptamer frequencies. For this purpose we used the Dicodonshuffle randomization procedure (44). Each gene sequence in the nrMEG was randomized 1000 times. This gave rise to a set of 1000 randomized enterobacterial genomes where each constituent gene sequence encodes for the same protein sequence, and has the same codon usage and dinucleotide biases as in the native nrMEG. Hence, the frequency of a heptamer's occurrence in these genomes could be used as an estimate of its frequency in the absence of selective pressure due to shift-prone properties of this pattern.Comparison of the observed and expected values of the frequency counts for each pattern. The frequency of occurrences of each of the 64 XXXZZZN patterns in each of the three possible frames (i.e. X_XXZ_ZZN, XX_XXZ_ZN and XXX_ZZZ_N) was determined across the 1000 randomized nrMEGs. Each pattern is represented by two numerical values: the mean and the standard deviation of its frequency distribution count across the 1000 randomized nrMEGs. To quantify the degree of under- or overrepresentation of each pattern we used a z-score (see Material and Methods section). A negative z-score implies that a pattern is underrepresented while a positive z-score is indicative of its overrepresentation (Supplementary Table S3). Under our assumption, we would expect only the \u2018in-frame\u2019 shifty motif (X_XXY_YYZ) and not the \u2018out-of-frame\u2019 shifty motifs (XX_XYY_YZ and XXX_YYY_Z) to be underrepresented.",

Black dots correspond to the number of occurrences of a particular motif in the nrMEG while the associated violin shows the distribution of the same motif across the randomized nrMEGs. Comparison with the in vivo data of Figure 4 shows that some of the sequence patterns, which are characterized by a marked underrepresentation, are also associated with high frameshifting efficiency (e.g. A_AA.A_AA.G). Two motifs, AAAAAAA and UUUUUUU, are notably underrepresented in all three frames (Supplementary Table S3). Possible reasons are that these patterns may interfere with gene expression in a frame-independent manner, producing indels in mRNA due to transcriptional slippage (55) or indel mutations at a high rate (56). Two motifs, the poor frameshifters C_CC.G_GG.C and C_CC.G_GG.U, are notably underrepresented and one motif, U_UU.C_CC.G, is markedly overrepresented. Frameshifting is not the only factor that may affect evolution of codon co-occurrence. It is possible that a particular pair of codons is slow to decode or results in ribosome drop-off. Such factors result in codon pair bias. The CCC_GGY and UUC_CCG codon pairs were indeed shown to be less frequent than expected for the formers and more frequent for the latter (57). The violin plots showing the comparison of patterns occurrence in the nrMEG and their distribution in the randomized nrMEGs in all three frames are available online at http://lapti.ucc.ie/heptameric_patterns_clusters/.",

Surprisingly, no significant anticorrelation was found between the two measures (r = \u22120.020, P = 0.874; Figure 7A). Previously, underrepresentation of one shift prone pattern (A_AA.A_AA.G) was found to be more pronounced in highly expressed genes than in lowly expressed genes (6). Therefore, the distribution of X_XX.Z_ZZ.N motifs was analysed among 253 genes predicted as highly expressed in E. coli K12 (HEG database; http://genomes.urv.cat/HEG-DB/). These sequences were similarly randomized (10 000 times instead of 1000 because of the smaller size of this data set in comparison to the nrMEG set) and z-scores for each of the 64 patterns were computed.

This procedure led to 658 alignments which represented gene families with sequences containing one of the 21 chosen X_XX.Z_ZZ.N patterns. Subsequent filtering on the basis frameshift site conservation reduced that number to 69 clusters: 8 correspond to mobile genetic elements, 5 are from prophage genes and 56 belong to other gene families (Supplementary Table S4 and S5). The main features of these 69 clusters are summarized in Figure 8. It appears that the size of the gene containing the frameshift signal is very variable, since it can code for a 44\u20131426 amino acid protein (Supplementary Table S6, Figure 8A). In 57 clusters, the frameshift product is shorter than the product of normal translation (Supplementary Table S6, Figure 8B). The degree of conservation of synonymous sites around the frameshift site was also analysed (46); Figure 8C (http://lapti.ucc.ie/heptameric_patterns_clusters/). Synonymous sites are supposed to evolve neutrally unless there are additional constraints acting at the nucleotide sequence level, for example, pressure to conserve an RNA structure. Only 2 out of the 56 non-mobile genes display reduced variability at synonymous sites in the vicinity of the frameshift site, whereas 4 IS clusters and 1 prophage cluster do show such suppression (RVSS/alndiv column in Supplementary Tables S4 and S5). However, failure to detect statistically significant synonymous site conservation in the other clusters may be due to insufficient sequence divergence (RVSS/alndiv column in Supplementary Tables S4 and S5). Among the clusters displaying reduced variability, 1 non-mobile cluster (A_AAA_AAG_6), and 3 IS clusters (A_AAA_AAG_2, A_AAA_AAG_3 and A_AAA_AAG_4) possess a proven or potential stimulatory structure downstream of the motif. One IS cluster with reduced variability (A_AAA_AAC_1, a proven case of frameshifting) has no established stimulator (4,53). Two IS clusters do not display reduced synonymous site variability (A_AAA_AAA_1 and A_AAA_AAG_37) in spite of being proven cases where -1 frameshifting is stimulated by a stem-loop structure (unpublished data) (58).",

The SD-like sequences to be searched 6\u201317 nt upstream of the motif were those for which a stimulatory effect was experimentally demonstrated (Materials and Methods) (32). A conserved SD was found in 8 out of the 56 non-mobile clusters and in 3 out of the 13 IS and prophage clusters (Figure 8C, Supplementary Tables S4 and S8). In contrast, a potential stimulatory structure was predicted in a larger proportion of clusters: a conserved hairpin is present in the 8 IS clusters, in 3 out of 5 of the phage clusters and in 42 out of the 56 non-mobile genes clusters (see Materials and Methods for the parameters used to define the hairpin structure). Nine clusters possess both types of stimulators. To characterize further the predicted structures, we compared them with IS3 family members possessing a frameshift site and an associated stimulatory structure (9,10). To assess structures of different sizes, we used a single parameter, \u0394Ghp.nt\u22121; which is the \u0394Gunfold@37\u00b0C value of the hairpin divided by the number of nucleotides in the structure. An overall comparison showed that taken together the hairpins of our 53 clusters had a lower \u0394Ghp.nt\u22121 than those from a set of 271 IS3 family members (0.317 \u00b1 0.114 versus 0.452 \u00b1 0.124 kcal.mol\u22121.nt\u22121; Supplementary Table S8 and Figure S2). For a more refined comparison, 20 IS3 members were selected because they have a hairpin ranging from 17 to 131 nt. The average \u0394G.nt\u22121 (\u0394Gav.nt\u22121) downstream of the frameshift motif was determined as detailed in Materials and Methods for these ISs as well as for our 53 clusters. The difference between \u0394Ghp.nt\u22121 and \u0394Gav.nt\u22121, \u0394\u0394G.nt\u22121, was calculated and plotted against the size of the structure (Figure 9). It appeared that all the IS hairpins have a positive \u0394\u0394G.nt\u22121 value (\u22650.09 kcal.mol\u22121.nt\u22121) indicating that the hairpin segment is more structured than average, as expected if there is selective pressure for its maintenance (Figure 9A). The distribution of \u0394\u0394G.nt\u22121 values is clearly not the same for our 53 clusters, especially the non-mobile genes clusters (Figure 9B): only 14 of them are at or above the 0.09 kcal.mol\u22121.nt\u22121 threshold value defined by the IS set. The remaining 28 clusters, as well as 2 phage clusters and 1 IS cluster, appeared to have a local folding level close or even below average. This suggests that their respective potential hairpins may not have been selected for but are fortuitous, non-biologically relevant, structures.",

Thus, maintenance of a cognate tRNA-codon interaction after re-pairing of the A-site tRNA in the -1 frame is important to ensure efficient frameshifting. Notably, the maximal level of frameshifting remained about 10-fold lower than observed with the best heptamer associated with the same stimulatory element. In contrast, also with the heptamers, frameshifting on the Z_ZZ.N motifs definitely requires presence of a strong stimulator (Figure 3).",

A third of the motifs were not experimentally tested in the eukaryotic context because they were expected to be inefficient. Nevertheless, major rules of -1 frameshifting efficiency, as a function of the identity of the X, Z and N nucleotides, can be formulated (Supplementary Figure S1B). It appears that the most efficient motifs are D_DD.A_AA.H, D_DD.U_UU.H, U_UU.U_UU.G and C_CC.U_UU.U in the eukaryotic system and V_VV.A_AA.R, H_HH.U_UU.Y, U_UU.A_AA.G, C_CCC_CCC and A_AA.G_GG.G in E. coli (with D = [U, A, G], H = [U, C, A], R = [A,R], Y = [U,C] and V = [C, A, G]). The outcome is a slightly larger number of high efficiency motifs in the eukaryotic situation than in the bacterial one (20 versus 15), at least in the nucleotide context in which the motifs were tested in both studies. While the nucleotides immediately flanking a given motif can modulate frameshift level (19,20,36\u201338), they probably cannot turn an inefficient motif into a highly efficient one or vice versa, as suggested by one analysis in E. coli [see Table 3 in (36)]. That the above rules likely apply to other eukaryotic organisms is supported by studies on yeast and plant viruses (51,59\u201361). Several observations suggest that the E. coli rules are probably valid for many other bacterial species. A survey of the GtRNAdb database [(62); http://gtrnadb.ucsc.edu/] in June 2013 indicates that out of 431 different bacterial species, 168 possess only one type of lys-tRNA, with a 3\u2032UUU5\u2032 anticodon, like E. coli (41). In these species, covering all the major bacterial phyla, the A_AA.R and V_VV.A_AA.R motifs should be as shift-prone as in E. coli. Interestingly, the same two types of motifs are highly prevalent (74.5%) among non-redundant IS elements from the IS1 and IS3 families present in the ISFinder database (Figure 5). Furthermore, among the 134 species present in the GtRNAdb database and in which IS3 family transposable elements are found (ISFinder database, October 2012), 83 contain both types of lys-tRNA (3\u2032UUU5\u2032 and 3\u2032UUC5\u2032 anticodons). ISs with an A_AA.G or V_VV.A_AA.G motif are present in 46 of these 83 species. Thus, presence of a lys-tRNA with a 3\u2032UUC5\u2032 anticodon, which should pair perfectly with the AAG codon and thus reduce frameshifting (41), does not preclude the use of A_AA.G or V_VV.A_AA.G frameshift motifs in IS elements from many bacterial species.",

This suggests that a weak tRNA-codon pairing interaction in the A site is a universal pre-requisite for high level -1 frameshifting (17). The major differences concern the identity of the X and N nucleotides. While Neuk can be A, C or U, Nprok identity is linked to that of Z so that ZZNprok must be all purines or all pyrimidines to achieve high frameshifting level. In terms of tRNA-codon relations, this suggests that the prokaryotic ribosome tolerates less readily a non-cognate interaction after frameshifting (e.g. following a shift from AAC to AAA) than its eukaryotic counterpart. One possibility is that the bacterial ribosome still monitors the correctness of the codon\u2013anticodon pairing in the A site even after frameshifting. Concerning the ribosomal P site tRNA, which has to shift from XXZ to XXX, the prokaryotic ribosome still displays the same preference for cognate pairing in the new frame when Z is U. However, it is more eukaryotic-like when Z is A, a feature reflecting the high shiftiness of bacterial lys-tRNAUUU especially when ZZN is AAG [Figures 3 and 4; (41)].",

Overall, about 61% of the heptamers are significantly shift-prone, to very different extent, in the absence of stimulators, a feat confirming that the motif, i.e. tRNA re-pairing, is the primary determinant of -1 frameshifting. Stimulatory elements cannot induce frameshifting by themselves. They likely facilitate tRNA re-pairing by causing ribosome pausing (27\u201329) and by promoting mRNA realignment (30\u201332). It is interesting to note that heptamers of low efficiency in E. coli (Figure 4), like A_AA.A_AA.C and G_GG.A_AA.C, are nevertheless very likely used for programmed frameshifting by bacterial IS elements [Figure 5; (10)].",

            "text": "Study of the distribution of the 64 X_XXZ_ZZN heptamers in 22 703 sequences, selected to constitute our nrMEG, revealed that about 66% of the motifs were underrepresented to different extents (Figure 6, Supplementary Table S3). However, there was no significant anticorrelation between the observed frameshifting efficiency and the underrepresentation of shifty patterns when all the genes are taken into account or when only a subset of genes categorized as highly expressed was considered (Figure 7). The latter finding was unexpected, because it is believed that the deleterious effect of frameshift-prone patterns, at least in highly expressed genes (6), should increase with increased frameshifting efficiency and thus augment the pressure for selection against these sequences in protein coding regions. At this point we may only speculate about possible reasons. One reason could be the dependency of frameshifting on the context. Such context effects, involving nucleotides located immediately upstream or downstream of some motifs (tetramers and heptamers), were revealed through directed mutagenesis of frameshifting signals of prokaryotic and eukaryotic origin (19,20,36\u201338). Our experimental assays were carried out in a limited set of nucleotide context surrounding the patterns and, therefore, our results may not reflect the frameshifting efficiencies of these patterns in all their native contexts. Another possibility is that, even for the most efficient motifs placed in the best immediate context, frameshifting frequency remains sufficiently low in the absence of stimulatory elements, so as to have no detrimental effect on bacterial fitness. For the three best V_VV.A_AA.G heptamers(V = [C,A,G]) this frequency is at around 0.3% (Figure 4). From another study, we know that frameshifting on these motifs could be increased by about 12.4-fold at most, i.e. going up to 3.7%, by modifying the 3\u2032 context (36). But this is still much lower if compared to the cumulative effect of background translational errors: missense errors and drop-off have a total estimated frequency of about 5\u00d710\u22124 per amino-acid and thus would result in \u223c18% of incorrect chains for a 500 amino-acids protein (63).",

The former led to identification of a few candidate genes only, but the search was restricted to a limited number of motifs and to one organism only, E. coli. The studies using the second approach were more exhaustive since they used all the available sequenced bacterial genomes. Consequently, they brought more candidates. A search of genes with disrupted open reading frames (ORFs) among 973 genomes initially revealed about 1000 candidate genes, 75% of which could be grouped into 64 clusters (11). Assuming an average number of 3130 protein-coding genes per genome, this gives a frequency of candidates of about 0.03%. Sequence comparison showed that 47 clusters contained genes from IS mobile genetic elements. Interestingly, a substantial proportion of them (22 clusters) may use programmed transcriptional realignment rather than translational -1 frameshifting (12 clusters) and in 9 clusters, both types of recoding may operate. The analysis with the GeneTack program of 1106 microbial genomes carried out by Antonov et al. (13,14) eventually revealed 4730 genes, potentially using frameshifting (in the +1 or -1 direction) or transcriptional realignment, which were grouped into 146 clusters. IS transposable elements genes are found in a minority of clusters, 17. Thus, other categories of genes of various functions predominate. However, if the absolute number of genes is considered, then IS elements prevail with a total number of 3317 genes. This probably reflects that ISs are prone to horizontal transfer and are often present in multiple copies in a genome. Assuming again an average number of 3130 protein-coding genes per genome, then the overall frequency of candidates found by Antonov et al. (14) among 1106 genomes is about 0.14%. One drawback of the disrupted-ORF approach is that it fails to detect cases where frameshifting would lead to a protein shorter than the product of normal translation. An example is provided by the dnaX gene family: while in E.coli and many bacteria frameshifting leads to a shorter protein, it results in a longer product in a more limited number of bacteria. The GeneTack analysis detected only the later cases in 17 genomes [see COF_239165634 in the GeneTack prokaryotic frameshift database; (14)].",

An illustration is provided by a study of the yeast genome: 20% of the ORFs (i.e. 1275 out of 6353) were found to contain one or more \u2018strong\u2019 -1 frameshift signal (7); by strong the authors mean that there is an efficient motif (as defined in the previous section) and a downstream structure (the total number of strong candidate frameshift regions was 1679). Since in 99% of the cases, -1 frameshifting leads to rapid premature termination, it was proposed, and then experimentally substantiated at least for a few genes (65), that -1 PRF is largely used in yeast for regulatory purpose rather than to generate, as is the case in IS elements or viruses, a fusion protein with a new carboxyl-terminal functional domain (7). A subsequent study, using a different method for structure prediction and scoring, lead to a much less optimistic evaluation: only 74 candidates of the former study were retained (66).",

            "text": "One aim of the present study was to identify genes containing 21 selected frameshift motifs within 36 individual genomes, 27 of which are from E. coli strains. The cumulated number of protein coding genes is 165 099 and among them 31 180 contain at least one of the 21 motifs, thus the overall frequency of motif-containing genes is 18.9%. After filtering and enrichment beyond the E. coli species, the outcome was a set of 69 clusters (i.e. a total 10 918 genes) each being a group of closely related genes where a given motif is conserved. Since about 10 392 019 genes were tested, the final yield of frameshift candidates was of 0.10%. This value is close to that obtained by Antonov et al. (14), therefore, suggesting achievement of a similar stringency by both searches. An internal validation of our method was provided by the fact that expected cases (dnaX gene, 7 IS elements and 2 bacteriophage genes; marked as [true] in Supplementary Tables S4 and S5 and in Figure 8) were found in the final set. Among the 59 remaining clusters, 1 is from IS elements, 3 are from prophages genes and 55 are from non-mobile cellular genes of known and unknown functions. In 57 of our 69 clusters, like in E. coli dnaX gene, but in contrast with ISs from the IS1 and IS3 families and all the 146 programmed frameshift clusters from the GeneTack database, frameshifting would lead to a product shorter than the protein resulting from normal translation (Figure 8B). Whether or not this type of frameshifting affects mRNA stability, as proposed for yeast candidates (7,65), remains to be determined. A majority of our clusters, 55, contain a conserved potential stimulatory element (as defined in Materials and Methods): there is an upstream SD in 2 clusters, a downstream hairpin in 44 and both types of stimulators in 9 (Figure 8C). However, assessment of the hairpins with the \u0394\u0394G.nt\u22121 parameter suggested that they may be relevant in only 1 phage cluster and in 14 non-mobile genes clusters (Figure 9; Supplementary Table S8). Furthermore, if motif efficiency is taken as an additional constraint, only 8 clusters remain as best candidates for high level -1 frameshifting (marked with ** in Supplementary Table S8). As shown in Supplementary Table S7, there is a limited overlap between our 69 clusters and the 146 clusters of Antonov et al. (13,14), thus, demonstrating that the two approaches are complementary. The present study, in agreement with previous ones (11\u201314), suggests that recoding in bacteria is mostly found (at least in terms of absolute number of candidates genes) in IS transposable elements and in a few bacteriophage genes. However, if numbers of gene clusters are considered, then it appears that non-mobile genes clusters predominate. Information about the function of these genes, as found in the Ecogene database (67), is shown in Supplementary Table S5. Seventeen are of unknown function, four are predicted to be transcriptional regulators and the rest have different predicted functions.",

Full functional analysis has not yet been carried out on the 146 GeneTack clusters or on the candidates genes reported in this study. Representatives of both studies, 20 of the GeneTack clusters (14) and 2 of our 8 best candidates (Supplementary Table S8), were tested for the first step only. Promisingly, 14 of the 20 GeneTack candidates and both of ours were found capable of eliciting frameshifting at different but substantial levels, i.e. from 0.3% to 63% [(14), Supplementary Figure S3].

The x-axis indicates the size in nucleotide of the hairpin structure and the y-axis shows the \u0394\u0394G.nt\u22121 parameter, which is the difference between the mean \u0394Gunfold per nucleotide of the conserved hairpin (\u0394Ghp.nt\u22121, kcal.mol\u22121.nt\u22121) and the average \u0394Gunfold of structures predicted in a sliding window, of the same size as the corresponding conserved hairpin, moved over a 197 nt segment starting 4 nt after the motif (\u0394Gav, kcal.mol\u22121) (see also Supplementary Table S8); the error bar correspond to the standard deviation for that difference. The symbols with a central black dot indicate genes for which PRF-1 is demonstrated or very likely. Part A shows the results for a set of IS3 family members, namely (and ranked according to the size of the structure): IS3411, ISAca1, ISSusp2, IS3, IS1221A, ISBcen23, ISPae1, ISPsy11, ISBmu11, ISPosp5, ISBcen22, ISBam1, ISHor1, ISXca1, ISL1, ISDde4, ISBlma5, ISSpwi1, ISNisp3 and ISRle5. The dotted line is set at the lowest \u0394\u0394G.nt\u22121 value (0.09 kcal.mol\u22121.nt\u22121) found for ISPsy1. Part B shows the \u0394\u0394G.nt\u22121 results for 53 gene clusters, out of the 69, that have a conserved hairpin. The IS (circles) and phage (squares) clusters are in the upper panel and the non-mobiles genes clusters in the bottom panel.",
