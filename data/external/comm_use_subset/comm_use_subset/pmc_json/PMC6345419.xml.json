Based on a nationwide survey of human parasites in China conducted in total 1,477,742 persons in 1994, the prevalence rate of ascariasis, hookworm infections, and trichuriasis was 47.0%, 17.2%, and 18.8%, with estimates of a total infected population of 531 million, 194 million, and 212 million, respectively [1, 13]. However, China\u2019s economic growth has not occurred evenly with an East to West poverty gradient, resulting in dramatic declines in the former and remaining high STHs prevalence rates in the southwest provinces where the economy has not progressed [14]. For example, recent estimates indicate that the highest prevalence rates of STHs currently occur in the southwestern provinces of Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, and Yunnan, where poverty is widespread, as well as the South China Sea Province of Hainan [7].",

            "text": "Schistosomiasis caused by the infection of Schistosoma japonicum has had an important role in the history of modern China. Prior to the Great Leap Forward in the 1950s, it was highly endemic in 12 provinces of the Yangtze River valley, with 11.6 million infected individuals and over 100 million people under threat of infection [15, 16]. Since then, China has implemented comprehensive national campaigns to control the prevalence of schistosomiasis in humans and livestock, through the liberal use of molluscicides and destroying snail habitats, mechanization to replace water buffalo with tractors, and large-scale mass chemotherapy of both humans and livestock with praziquantel [17]. According to the Ministry of Health, the number of infected human cases has dropped to 54,454 in 2016 with no new acute cases reported [18]. However, these estimates are significantly lower than the GDB 2016, which reported schistosomiasis prevalence of 1,067,203 in 2016 in China, possibly due to the different cited sources [8]. We are working to understand the basis of this discrepancy. There are also concerns about snail repopulation along the Yangtze and its tributaries, and human disease reemergence as a consequence of climate change and large hydroelectric projects such as the Three Gorges Project and the South-to-North Water Diversion Project in China [19, 20].",

As a result, outstanding progress has been made toward the elimination of malaria in China. Since the National Malaria Elimination Program was launched in 2010, China\u2019s malaria incidence has declined from 64,178 cases in 2006 [21] to 2,718 cases in 2012 [22] and has remained at low levels (Fig 2A). However, there has been a significant rise in imported cases from Africa and southeast Asia, especially since the launch of Belt and Road Initiative. In 2016 alone, there were 3,321 malaria cases reported; 3,317 of them were imported from Africa or other endemic countries with only 3 cases of indigenous malaria [23]. There was no indigenous malaria case reported in China in 2017; all of the malaria cases were imported [24]. This is associated with a shift in malaria species from predominantly P. vivax to P. falciparum in addition to P. ovale and P. malariae (Fig 2B) [24]. Moreover, although the total cases of malaria have been significantly reduced, the severe malaria cases and deaths remain at similar levels due to the increased proportion of imported P. falciparum malaria [16, 23].",

Taeniasis-cysticercosis caused by Taenia solium is also widespread. The prevalence of cysticercosis in China increased from 0.01% in 1994 to 0.58% in 2004, so that the most recent estimate indicates that the infected population was about 7 million [6]. Tibet in Western China exhibits the highest Taenia infection rate of 19.2% [6, 29]. Echinococcosis is also endemic in western China, with an estimated 170,000 infections, of which more than 98% occur in Xinjiang, Qinghai, Gansu, Sichuan, Inner Mongolia, and Ningxia [30].",

However, high rates of post-treatment reinfection and variable efficacies of benzimidazole anthelminthics, including the possible emergence of anthelminthic resistance [40, 41], suggest the need for alternative technologies, including better drugs or even anthelminthic vaccines [42]. For schistosomiasis in China, enormous strides have been made through a multipronged approach highlighted above, but there is a need to reinforce and strengthen these measures to achieve its elimination as a public health problem. For food-borne helminth infections, a comprehensive control approach should be deployed, for example, the establishment of case report network, including a traceable system for the infection source; a surveillance and supervision system for the entire food industry chain; and public education and awareness for disease infection and control methods [43, 44].",

In parallel, there is a need to establish tropical disease control and surveillance centers in the major urban areas of China, such as the one established at the Friendship Hospital in Beijing [34], which plays important roles in screening, diagnosis, and treatment of imported tropical diseases. Conversely, within Africa, China\u2019s national aid can be partly redirected to the healthcare sector with an emphasis on NTD surveillance and treatments. Currently, the healthcare sector accounts for only 2.1% of China\u2019s total investment in Africa, and only a small percentage of this amount goes towards basic and clinical research and training [46, 47].

Finally, although not discussed in detail here, we\u2019ll need to consider the impact of China\u2019s aging population on parasitic infections. For instance, it was noted that the elderly are disproportionately affected by hookworm infection in some areas of China [50]. Also, more attention needs to be paid to the possible effects of climate change on the emerging or reemerging NTDs, especially on vector-borne and snail-borne disease [51].
