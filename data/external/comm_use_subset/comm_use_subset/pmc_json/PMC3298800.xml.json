Both sheeppox and goatpox are endemic in Africa, the Middle East and many countries in Asia, and the diseases caused by these viruses have a significant economic impact on the livestock industry in Africa and Asia [2]. GTPV genome is approximately 150 kbp double-stranded DNA, which composes at least 147 putative genes, including conserved replicative and structural genes and genes likely involved in virulence and host range [3]. ORF095 encodes the virion protein which constitutes a great part of the total protein content of the virion and is essential during the assembly and disassembly of virion. It is similar to myxoma virus (MYXV) M093L (accession no.AF170726) [4,5] and vaccinia virus (VACV) A4L (accession no.M35027) that encodes a 39 kDa acidic protein, a part of the viral core, and is synthesized at late stages after infection [6,7].",

RNAi can be triggered by chemically synthesised and enzymatically produced 21-25 nt long RNA duplexes in mammalian cells [9,10]. Since the effect of short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) is generally temporal in transfected animal cells, small RNA expression vectors have been developed to induce long-lasting RNA silencing in mammalian cells [11-14]. RNAi represents a new antiviral method and is being increasingly used to inhibit the replication of viral pathogens [15] such as foot-and-mouth disease [16,17], porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus [18], Newcastle disease virus [19], classical swine fever virus [20] and Monkeypox virus [21]. Hairpin expression vectors have been used to induce gene silencing in a large number of studies on viruses [11,22-26].",

            "text": "Different siRNA sequences display widely different efficacies with regard to suppression of gene expression, requiring screening of multiple sequences [37]. In this research, we have selected four target sequences for RNA interference by the software applications, \"siRNA Target Finder and Design Tool\" available at http://www.ambion.com/. As the ORF095 gene is well conserved in GTPV and ORF095 protein is a virion core protein and assembly protein in GTPV, we selected ORF095 as a target gene. In order to generate shRNA expression cassettes quickly and accurately, we employed a PCR-based strategy to clone siRNA sequences. In this strategy, siRNA sequences were designed as a single primer sequence of which 19 bp complementary to the human U6 promoter were added. The resulting PCR products are shRNA expression cassettes including the human U6 promoter. shRNAs that have been generated from this expression system are efficiently processed by dicer into siRNAs. In addition, in this study, we selected pEGFP-N1 vector that contains an EGFP gene as report gene and can be transfected into mammalian cells using any standard transfection method.",
