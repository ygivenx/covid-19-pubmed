IFNs play an essential role in the induction of an antiviral state and contribute to the initiation of the adaptive immune response. The type I IFNs (including IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2) are well known for their induction and potent antiviral activity directly in response to viral infection. More recently, a family of IFNs named type III IFNs (also known as IL28/29 or IFN-\u03bbs) were discovered in the human genome based on their similarity to type I IFN and IL-10 family members [1], [2]. Type I and III IFNs have similar antiviral activity, are produced by common pathways and result in the production of an overlapping repertoire of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) [3]\u2013[5]. Despite their similarities, type I and III IFNs signal through distinct IFN receptor (IFNR) complexes and display differences in their tissue and cellular distribution patterns consistent with each IFN family playing a distinct role in the immune response to viral infections.",

The IFN\u03bbR1 chain serves as a unique subunit of the type III receptor complex and is critical to the specificity of ligand binding [5].

Unlike the ubiquitously expressed type I IFNR complex, the type III IFNR has a more restricted tissue distribution pattern. Although the IL10R2 chain is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues and cells, the expression of the IFN\u03bbR1 varies widely between different organs and at the cellular level is restricted to epithelial cells [5], [12]\u2013[14]. This expression pattern may reflect a role for type III IFNs in antiviral activity at the major portals of viral entry, providing a mechanism to inhibit viral replication prior to the activation of other components of the immune system. Although a high expression of IFN\u03bbR1 has also been detected in a variety of human and mouse immune cells, only mouse plasmacytoid dendritic cells have been shown to respond to IFN-\u03bb [5], [12], [13], [15], [16].",

Bats generally show no symptoms of disease and appear to be capable of rapidly controlling viral replication to very low levels yet still allowing occasional spillover to other susceptible species [17]. Although the mechanisms responsible for the control of viral replication in bats are not understood, the co-evolution of bats with viruses may have resulted in the evolution of novel mechanisms for the control of viral replication. To elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the asymptomatic nature of viral infections in bats, we are using the black flying fox, Pteropus alecto as a model species for examining antiviral immunity in bats [18]\u2013[21].",

As the biological activity of cytokines is mediated through binding to specific receptor complexes, information on cellular responses to cytokines provides important clues to biological function.

As soluble variants of IFN\u03bbR1 and IL10R2 have been identified in other species, RT-PCR was also performed on P. alecto spleen and thymus RNA, however, no additional isoforms were identified. Alignment of cDNA sequences with the P. vampyrus genome and genes from the other species available in the GenBank database, revealed the presence of a single form of IFN\u03bbR1 and IL10R2 in P. alecto.

In humans, the IFN\u03bbR1 chain is unique to the IFN\u03bbR complex and has substantially higher ligand affinity than the IL10R2 chain [3], [6], [7], [14]. We therefore focused on IFN\u03bbR1 to obtain information specific to the IFN-\u03bb response. Bat primary cells, including five non-hematopoietic cell lines derived from kidney, small intestine, brain, liver and lung were examined for their response to recombinant bat IFN-\u03bb2 [21]. As shown in Figure 4, there is a correlation between the expression of IFN\u03bbR1 (Fig. 4A) and the induction of the two ISGs tested, RIG-I (Fig. 4B) and ISG56 (Fig. 4C) following IFN-\u03bb stimulation. Liver, lung and small intestine which have relatively higher IFN\u03bbR1 expression show correspondingly high ISGs induction. In contrast, kidney and brain responded poorly to IFN-\u03bb, due to their low IFN\u03bbR1 expression.",

The two splice variants of human IFN\u03bbR1 have been speculated to negatively regulate IL-28/IL-29 signalling as a result of IFN-\u03bb binding to the soluble IFN\u03bbR1 receptor prior to cell contact, and due to the truncated IFN\u03bbR1 acting as a dominant negative receptor chain. Although we cannot completely rule out the possibility of the presence of additional IFN\u03bbR1 splice variants in P. alecto, the absence of such variants with the ability to downregulate the IFN-\u03bb response may lead to a more pronounced IFN response in bat cells.",

The transcription of P. alecto IL10R2 was comparable to humans [25], with a ubiquitous expression among all tissues tested. Interestingly, the three hematopoietic organs tested, PBMC, spleen and lymph nodes displayed the highest IL10R2 expression likely reflecting its role as a receptor for a number of cytokines.

However, a higher IFN\u03bbR1 expression by bat splenocytes compared with the non-hematopoietic cell lines did not correspond to a higher induction of ISGs. In mice, plasmacytoid dendritic cells are the only immune cells that express the IFN\u03bbR1 and these cells are also responsive to IFN-\u03bb stimulation [16].

Our results are consistent with the presence of a population of bat splenocytes that are sensitive to IFN-\u03bb.
