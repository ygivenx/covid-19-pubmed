            "text": "EBV is a herpesvirus with a DNA genome containing in the region of 90 genes [15]. However, only 9 or 10 viral proteins are regularly expressed in LCLs, which generally display a non-productive or \u2018latent\u2019 infection [16]. Of the transformation-associated latent viral proteins, at least one, LMP1, is oncogenic by classical criteria; its ectopic expression in model rodent fibroblast lines leads to cellular transformation in vitro and acquisition of a tumorigenic phenotype in vivo\n[17], [18]. Although showing no overall sequence homology with any cellular proteins, LMP1 functions as a constitutively-active member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family which includes CD40 [19]. LMP2A is a trans-membrane signaling protein that behaves as a constitutively active functional homologue of the B cell receptor [20], [21]. The remaining transformation-associated proteins are mostly nuclear proteins (EBNA1, EBNA2, EBNA3A, EBNA3B, EBNA3C and EBNA-LP), which again show no significant homology to cellular proteins although their effects on regulation of cellular transcription and signaling pathways are well-studied [15]. Transformation of B cells by EBV cannot be attributed to a single viral oncogene. Rather, the cooperative functions of multiple viral genes are required, as demonstrated by studies with recombinant EBVs, which show that deletion of any one of EBNA1, EBNA2, EBNA3A, EBNA3C or LMP1 genes will abolish or substantially reduce transforming ability [22], [23].",

One of these concerns why EBV-infected normal B cells are transformed into blasts that grow indefinitely, whilst B cell blasts generated, for example by continuous stimulation with CD40L and IL-4, have finite proliferative potential lasting a few weeks. This is an important question as it impacts on our understanding of the role of EBV in the pathogenesis of B cell tumors.",

Consistent with published data indicating the phenotypic similarities of EBV- and mitogen-induced B blasts [24], we found that there was considerable overlap in their transcriptomes and that mRNA changes relative to the original resting B cells largely reflected common changes associated with lymphocyte activation and cell proliferation. Of greater interest to us was the subset of genes that was differentially expressed between EBV and CD40L/IL-4 blasts. Analysis of this latter set of genes identified an intriguing discordance of EBV and IL-4 mediated transcriptional regulation that is functionally relevant to EBV-induced cellular transformation.",

As the normal counterparts of the malignant HRS cells of HL are germinal center (GC) B cells, we first determined whether the EBV/ISG/IL-4 associations could also be demonstrated in a GC B cell model of EBV infection in vitro. To this end, we reprised our comparisons on a previous array experiment [37] in which we had profiled germinal center (GC) B cells six weeks following their infection with EBV to yield lymphoblastoid cell lines (GC-LCLs). Consistent with our comparison of EBV and CD40L/IL-4 stimulated blasts at day 7, we found that genes up-regulated by EBV in GC-LCLs were significantly and substantially enriched for those down-regulated by IL-4 in T cells (OR = 12.0, \u03c72\n1 df = 586, 1df p<0.0001; Table 5).",

Although the transcriptomes of EBV and CD40L/IL-4 blasts showed substantial overlap, reflecting common proliferation and apoptosis related pathways, the expression of 255 genes was found to differ significantly between the two types of blasts (p<0.01; FC>2). Initial gene ontology analysis indicated that this set of 255 genes was substantially enriched for genes involved in innate cellular responses to viral infection, most notably ISGs. At first glance, this enrichment might seem an entirely predictable consequence of the innate responses to a viral infection, which results in activation of IFN pathways aimed at preventing viral genome replication, inhibiting cell proliferation and/or inducing cell death. However, EBV infected cells are not growth-inhibited or dying any more so than CD40L/IL-4 stimulated cells.",

            "text": "Upon infection of cells by viruses, the ISGs are regulated in response to ligation of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including Toll-like receptor family members recognising virion glycoproteins or DNA/RNA [43]. EBV has the potential to activate several PRRs, including TLR3 and TLR7 [44], [45], and a role for viral RNAs, most notably the EBERs, in triggering IFN production and IFN responses is well-established [46], [47]. As with other viruses, EBV has to modulate these innate intracellular responses in order to successfully infect and persist in the cells. The prevailing evidence suggests that EBV not only evades the intended consequences of innate intracellular responses, but actually subverts them to facilitate growth-transformation [44], [48], [49]. Consistent with this property of EBV, co-stimulation of TLR9 with the CpG synthetic ligand during EBV infection of B cells in vitro, actually enhances LCL outgrowth [48], [49]. There are likely to be several molecular mechanisms by which EBV utilizes the pro-proliferative effects of TLR and IFN signaling whilst avoiding the anti-viral end-points of growth-inhibition and apoptosis. One intriguing example identified by Martin et al [44] was the induction of alternatively-spliced IRF-5 transcripts that inhibit the anti-proliferative effects of the regular IRF-5 isoform. Another novel possibility is suggested from our analysis of the ISGs that are differentially expressed between EBV blasts and CD40L/IL4 blasts (Table 3). Although only 6 ISGs were expressed at significantly lower levels in EBV blasts, one of these was RNF19B (expressed 2.9x lower in EBV blasts; p = 0.0012), a E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that targets substrates such as UCKL1 for degradation; UCKL1 is a uridine kinase/uracil phosphoribosyltransferase that binds to EBV EBNA3A, an interaction that leads to a nuclear accumulation of UCKL1 that has been hypothesized to be important for EBV-induced proliferation [50].",

Strikingly, we found that genes that were expressed at significantly greater levels in EBV blasts than in CD40L/IL-4 blasts were substantially and significantly enriched for genes that were down-regulated by IL-4 in other cell systems. This finding is consistent with the observation that IFNs and cytokines such as IL-4 are known to cross-regulate each other's signaling in different cell types, including B cells [32]\u2013[35]. We were able to confirm in many cases that the induction by EBV of those ISGs that were differentially expressed in EBV blasts was reduced following infection in the presence of IL-4 (Figure 3). Furthermore, this effect of IL-4 was correlated with a significant impairment of transformation efficiency (Figure 4).",

Although we are unaware of any published evidence implicating DUSP6 or SPINT2 as tumor suppressors in B lymphoid malignancies, their expression was found to be increased in our experiments where IL-4 impaired EBV-induced transformation (Figures 3B, 4).",

Although IL-4 is not usually expressed in HL [60]\u2013[62], IL13 with which it shares functional receptors [63], [64] and remarkably similar biological functions is expressed [65]. Furthermore, proliferation of HL-derived lines in vitro and in vivo is reduced by antibodies to IL-13 or by decoy receptor molecules, suggesting that IL-13 can act as an autocrine growth-factor in HL [66], [67]. Activated STAT6, which is an essential mediator of many IL-4/IL-13-regulated genes [35] is usually detected in HL along with activated STAT3 [66]. However, IFN can inhibit activation of STAT6 by cytokines [68] and is also expressed by the HRS cells of HL [69]. Furthermore, IL-13 in the lesions of EBV-positive cases of HL would be expected to induce and maintain the high levels of LMP1 expression in the absence of EBNA2 in these tumors [70], which in turn would stimulate expression of ISGs [44]. Therefore, extrapolating from our in vitro transformation experiments (Figures 3, 4), we suggest that the pathogenesis of HL is a consequence in part of competing and conflicting influences on genes which are at the intersection of the IFN and IL-4/IL-13 pathways, and whose dysregulation is necessary for cellular transformation.",

Furthermore, a recent study by Steidl et al\n[39], who arrayed micro-dissected HRS cells from 7 EBV-positive and 17 EBV-negative classical HL samples, indicated a remarkable similarity in their transcriptomes; only 56 probe-sets corresponding to just 46 annotated genes were differentially expressed between the EBV-positive and \u2013negative tumors (>2FC, p<0.01; taken from the supplementary information of the Steidl paper). This in no way undermines our conclusions, rather it adds to the body of evidence that EBV infection is but one route to the development of this tumor. For example, a major signaling function of LMP1 is to constitutively activate NF-\u03baB [71]\u2013[73] and many EBV-negative cases of HL carry mutations of NF-\u03baB pathway genes that effect the same result [74], [75].",

An established LCL was used as a reference for all assays, and all values are shown relative to LCL transcript expression = 1, except for SPINT2 and DUSP6 whose expression in the reference LCL was extremely low (ddCt<12) and where expression is shown relative to control B cell cultures. The six cellular genes shown in (A) were reported by Elo et al\n[35] to be down-regulated by IL4 in T cells, whilst the 2 genes shown in (B) were reported to be up-regulated by IL-4 in T cells.",
