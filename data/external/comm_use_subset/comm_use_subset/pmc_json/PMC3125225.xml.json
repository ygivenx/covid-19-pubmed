This coevolution often leads to a species specificity of the virus and can make interspecies transmission difficult. Therefore, natural host range switches by viruses are rare events. However, when they occur the results can become severe because the viruses may then spread widely through non previously adapted, and therefore immunologically na\u00efve host populations.",

Those viruses are found in humans as well as in other animals, including swine, horses and birds, waterfowl being considered the natural reservoir [9]. Subtypes of Influenza A are distinguished by the two surface glycoproteins: haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Periodically a subtype of influenza can make the shift from aquatic birds to humans, possibly through an intermediate host, resulting in a widespread pandemic in an immunologically na\u00efve population. These antigenic shifts can occur either through the transfer of an entire virus from one host to another or through a reassortment process where genomic segments of the avian virus mix with genomic segments of a virus currently circulating in humans.",

Influenza haemagglutinin binds to sialic acid linked to galactose on the surface of the targeted cell, and the differing nature of the sialic acid-galactose linkages in birds and humans provides an important barrier to host shift events. In this sense, a number of amino acid substitutions have been produced in influenza haemagglutinin to adjust to the different receptors [10-14]. Neuraminidase, the protein responsible for cleaving the haemagglutinin from the receptor surface, also seems to be adapted to the particular sialic acid linkages [15]. Proteins in the viral replication complex (PA, PB1, PB2 and NP) have also been implicated in limiting host range by restricting replication and intra-host spread in mammals (for a review see [16]). In particular, a specific substitution in the PB2 gene has been identified as crucial for replication and intra-host spread in mammals [17-19].",

The extremely high homology of the viral genomic sequences between the viruses isolated from humans (huSARS-CoV) and those of palm civet origin (pcSARS-CoV) suggested possible palm civet-to-human transmission. Genetic analysis revealed that the spike (S) protein of pcSARS-CoV and huSARS-CoV was subjected to the strongest positive selection pressure during transmission, and there were six amino acid residues within the receptor binding domain of the S protein that were potentially important for SARS progression and tropism. It has been demonstrated that the double substitution of two amino acid residues of pcSARS-CoV for those of huSARS-CoV made pcSARS-CoV capable of infecting human cells [4], suggesting that these two residues are involved in the palm civet-human transmission.",

That is the case of canine parvovirus (CPV) which emerged in 1978 as the cause of new enteric and myocardial diseases in dogs. The new virus spread globally in a pandemic and has since remained endemic in dogs throughout the world [20,21]. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all CPV isolates obtained so far, termed CPV type 2, descended from a single ancestor closely related to the feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) which infects cats, mink and raccoons, but not dogs or cultured dog cells [21]. FPV and CPV type 2 isolates differ by as little as 0.5% in DNA sequence and it is possible that changes of only two amino acid residues in the capsid protein could have introduced the canine host range [22,23]. During 1979 a CPV variant (CPV type 2a) emerged, spread worldwide within 1 year and replaced the CPV type 2 strain. CPV type 2a contained five substitutions in the capsid sequence compared to CPV type 2 and also infected and caused disease in cats [24-26]. Therefore, the emergence of CPV seems to have been a multistep process, where a small number of mutations in the capsid protein gene allowed the virus to efficiently infect and spread within a new host order [27].",

The wide host range suggests that, in any moment along the viral evolution, those viruses may have been involved in different host shift events.

Since the identification of epizootic hematopoietic necrosis virus (EHNV), first isolated from redfin perch [36] and the first iridovirus associated with epizootic mortality in vertebrates [37], ranaviruses have caused epizooties in other fish species: sheatfish and catfish in Europe [38], largemouth bass [39] and ornamental fish (imported from Asia) in the USA [40], as well as grouper cultured in Asia [41,42]. In addition, ranaviruses have been isolated from diseased frogs, salamanders, turtles and snakes in different parts of the world [43-47]. At present the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses [48] recognizes six species within the genus based on analysis of host range, sequence identity, and protein and RFLP profiles [49,50], but there are also many additional isolates as well as a number of tentative species (Table 1). FV-3, EHNV, Bhole Iridovirus (BIV), Ambystoma tigrinum virus (ATV) and European catfish virus (ECV) are five closely-related viral species that share over 90% sequence identity within the MCP and other genes, but clearly differ from each other in host range and RFLP profiles. The sixth species is Santee-Cooper ranavirus (SCRV) that along with Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV), a tentative species, are the most divergent members of the genus. The MCP genes of these two viruses show approximately 80% and 70% sequence identity, respectively, with the MCP genes of the 5 other ranavirus species [51,52].",

            "text": "Several of these viruses have been demonstrated to have broad host specificity, suggesting the potential for interspecies and interclass transmission. A good example is BIV, which was isolated originally from diseased ornate burrowing frog (Limnodynastes ornatus) tadpoles in Australia [53] and has been shown experimentally to be pathogenic for other species of frog [54,55], and also for a fish species, barramundi (Lates calcarifer) [56,57]. Moreover, BIV has been associated with the \"spinning tilapia\" syndrome which causes epizootic mortalities in fry populations of tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) [56,58]. A case of interspecies transmission was demonstrated by Cunningham et al. [59], who infected common frogs Rana temporaria with two ranavirus isolates obtained from diseased toads (Bufo bufo). In addition, apparently identical FV3 strains were isolated from dead or moribund free-living threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and sympatric tadpoles of the red-legged frog (Rana aurora) [60], and FV3 and FV3-like viruses have been reported to infect sympatric amphibian species including ranid and hylid tadpoles, larval salamanders and newts [61]. Moreover, it has been experimentally demonstrated that FV3\u00b7is pathogenic for pike (Esox lucius) [62]. A very interesting case of cross-class infection was found studying ATV infection of salamanders. Phylogenetic analyses of sequence data from the MCP gene of ATV isolates from very different locations indicate that they are more closely related to fish ranaviruses, such as EHNV, than to other amphibian ranaviruses, such as FV3 [63]. These data suggested that ATV possibly originated via a host switch from fish, and was spread across North America due to the substantial trade of salamander larvae sold for bait [63-65].",

Those authors performed a dot plot comparison of the EHNV genome with that of other ranaviruses previously sequenced (ATV, FV, TFV, Grouper iridovirus and SGIV) and the results obtained indicated that EHNV is more closely related to the amphibian ranaviruses than to the GIV-like viruses infecting fish, as shown by other phylogenetic analyses previously performed [67]. In fact, Jancovich et al. [66] observed two lineages, FV3/TFV (frog lineage) and EHNV/ATV (fish/salamander lineage), and the existence of two major genomic inversions that can be visualised on the dot plot. These inversions would correspond to rearrangements of segments in the FV3-like lineage, which means that EHNV/ATV is closer to the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of ranaviruses. These authors postulate that there must have been at least three species jumps, from fish to frogs, from fish to salamanders and from frogs to reptiles, and perhaps as many as four species jumps, including a jump from tetrapod amphibians back to fish. A new ranavirus isolate obtained recently from dead wild edible frogs (Pelophylax esculentus) in Denmark, which showed a 98.8% nucleotide identity in the MCP gene with EHNV [68], would support that hypothesis.",

In this sense, an FV-3-like virus has been isolated from spotted salamander suffering from mortalities [69], and a model of FV3/FV3-like virus transmission in aquatic amphibian communities postulates that transmission of the virus occurs between anuran (i.e. frogs) and urodele (i.e. salamanders) species [61].

            "text": "Betanodaviruses have been classified into four genotypes, designated SJNNV (striped jack nervous necrosis virus), TPNNV (tiger puffer nervous necrosis virus), RGNNV (red grouper nervous necrosis virus) and BFNNV (barfin flounder nervous necrosis virus), using a partial sequence of RNA2, the T4 region, which is a highly variable region of around 400 nt [77,78]. These types exhibit different capabilities for infecting fish species. Thus, RGNNV shows the broadest host range and causes disease in a variety of warm-water fish species, BFNNV is restricted to cold-water marine fish species and TPNNV infects only one species [72]. With regards to the SJNNV type, although for several years it was considered to be restricted to a few species present in Japanese waters [72,78], in recent years it has been found in Senegalese sole Solea senegalensis [79,80] as well as gilthead sea bream Sparus aurata and sea bass cultured in the Iberian Peninsula [79]. More recent studies [81] reported that most of the betanodavirus strains infecting Senegalese sole and gilthead sea bream, previously typed as SJNNV on the basis of the T4 region, were in fact RGNNV/SJNNV reassortants. Olveira et al. [81] observed that the reassortant strains exhibited a slightly modified SJNNV capsid, with three different amino acid positions in all strains (the differences increased to a maximum of six in some strains). One of these changes observed in residue 247 was encoded by the nucleotide triplet 737-739, which was included in the region between nucleotides 695 and 765, described previously by Ito et al. [82] as a host specificity determinant. Another change in the amino acid sequence at residue 270 was also observed on the C-terminal side of the capsid protein. These results confirmed that C-terminal protruding domains of the capsid protein are involved in host specificity, as reported previously by Iwamoto et al. [83] and Ito et al. [82]. It is well known that even a small number of amino acid substitutions in the capsid proteins can have dramatic effects on the host specificity of different animal viruses [84]. In this case, the changes observed in the SJNNV capsid seem to have allowed it to efficiently infect and spread within two new hosts, causing epizootic outbreaks in Senegalese sole and gilthead sea bream, which were not previously considered susceptible to SJNNV.",

The virus causes an acute systemic disease that can affect all five species of Pacific salmon (sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka, pink salmon O. gurbuscha, chinook salmon O. tshawytscha, chum salmon O. keta, and coho salmon O. kisutch,) as well as Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), and rainbow trout (O. mykiss) [89]. However, not all salmonid species are equally susceptible to IHNV [90-93]. Garver et al. [90] have reported differences in susceptibility of sockeye salmon and rainbow trout to the different phylogenetic groups of IHNV established in North America (U, M and L) [94]. Isolates belonging to the U genogroup were highly virulent for sockeye salmon, while the M genogroup IHNV isolates were highly virulent for rainbow trout. Although not demonstrated, the U genogroup specificity for sockeye salmon is hypothesised to be associated with long-term coevolution of IHNV with sockeye salmon over centuries [90,94]. In contrast to the U genogroup situation, the M genogroup specificity for rainbow trout may reflect a relatively recent host-parasite interaction. The origin of the M genogroup may have involved a host shift of the U genogroup IHNV from sockeye salmon to rainbow trout during the 1970s, followed by a relatively rapid evolution and divergence in rainbow trout [94,95]. If this hypothesis is true, it would be interesting to know the mechanisms involved in the adaptation of the virus to the new host as this apparently caused a loss of virulence for its original host.",

The shift could be explained by the occurrence of a single introduction or adaptation event followed by expansion of this \"new\" genotype virus within trout aquaculture [98,101]. It has been suggested that the feeding of unpasteurised raw marine fish to farmed fish, a common practice in the early days of fish farming, could have been a likely route for the introduction of marine VHSV within rainbow trout aquaculture [104]. Only a limited number of amino acid residues might be involved in the determination of VHSV virulence for salmonids and this highlights the potential risk that marine strains may pose to freshwater aquaculture [105]. Snow & Cunningham [106] observed an increase in the virulence of the turbot isolate 860/94 following a number of passages in rainbow trout, although that increasing virulence was not accompanied by a difference in the consensus sequence in the glycoprotein.",

Most of the variation in this molecule is concentrated on a small highly polymorphic region (HPR). It is widely assumed that the source of the virulent ISAV isolates is an ISAV variant- designated HPR0- without any deletion in the HPR gene. The non-virulent nature of HPR0 viruses was indicated by the lack of disease in vivo and by their failure to replicate in cell culture [113,122]. The widely held model suggests that virulent variants of the HPR0 archetype arise by deletion of several nucleotides in the HPR [113,123,124]. The driving forces behind the differential deletion patterns in the HPR could be analogous to a phenomenon described for Influenza A neuraminidase, where varying lengths of the stalk region have been reported, a property that was associated to host range adaptation [125,126]. Following this theory and on the basis of a phylogenetic analysis of the HPR region, Mjaaland et al. [123] suggested that European ISA outbreaks may have been the result of several independent introductions of virus into farmed Atlantic salmon from wild fish, followed by adaptation to the new host through parallel but varied hemagglutinin gene deletions.",

[131] indicate that some fish (salmonid, ictalurid and ciprinid) and ranid HV may have coevolved with their hosts, at least at the tips of the phylogenetic tree. However, the phylogenetic analysis revealed an overall discordance between HV and host lineages. One example of these discordances is provided by the family Acipenseridae (sturgeons), an ancient fish lineage and the sturgeon HV (AciHV1 and AciHV2) which are not sister taxa, with AciHV2 being the sister group of the ictalurid HV. Another example is provided by the eel HV (AngHV1), which grouped tightly with cyprinid HV.

Six genogroups with a clear correspondence to the established serotypes have been identified [138,139]. In addition, a seventh genogroup has been proposed [140] to include yellow tail ascites virus (YTAV), isolated in Japan from an epizootic in yellowtail (Seriola quinqueradiata) [141]. This genogroup also includes other birnavirus strains isolated from a variety of marine fish and molluscan shellfish in Japan, which have been tentatively named marine birnavirus (MABV) [142]. The high diversity of types of this virus could be a result of a long process of adaptation to new species. In addition, recently a molecular phenomenon was discovered among aquabirnaviruses, which could contributes to adaptation and replication in new hosts: natural reassortment. Thus, Romero-Brey et al. [143] in an analysis of IPNV-like strains isolated from different species of wild fish captured in the Flemish Cap, Newfoundland [144], reported the existence of natural reassortant strains harbouring a WB type segment A and Ab type segment B (WB/Ab reassortant). Subsequent studies on aquatic birnaviruses isolated from wild fish in Galician coastal waters (NW Spain) [145] confirmed the presence of natural reassortants of the same type in a larger proportion of the population than in the Flemish Cap. The lack of information about segment B of most aquabirnavirus isolates reported in the literature means it is not known if reassortment is a common phenomenon in nature. Putative involvement of genetic reassortment in the spreading of aquabirnaviruses and colonisation of such a high number of aquatic species seems an interesting topic to study.",
