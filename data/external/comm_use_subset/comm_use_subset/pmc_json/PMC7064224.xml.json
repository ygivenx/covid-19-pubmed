            "text": "Intestinal microbiome imbalance, or dysbiosis, is a key factor in the development of diarrhea and equine colitis, which remains a leading cause of critical illness in horses, with an estimated disease fatality of 25.4% to 35%.[1, 2] Antibiotic therapy is often ineffectual and even worsens diarrheal disease by destroying beneficial commensal bacteria in the gut and allowing pathogenic species to expand. A lack of specific and effective therapies for equine colitis prevents clinicians from rapidly reversing disease-associated fluid losses and systemic inflammation that increase complication rates and result in the need for intensive care throughout prolonged hospital stays. Early therapeutic intervention is, therefore, necessary to circumvent potentially life-threatening complications of colitis (such as severe fluid loss, laminitis, coagulopathy, cardiovascular dysfunction) and improve overall outcome. The specific cause of colitis remains unknown in more than 50% of cases; in addition to bacterial and viral infections, disruption of the delicate microbial balance of the gut (dysbiosis) may result in colitis and may further diminish resistance to enteric pathogens.[3] Emerging data suggest that fecal microbial transplantation (FMT) may be efficacious in restoring normalcy to the gut.[4] FMT constitutes the transfer of a suspension of fecal microorganisms from a healthy donor horse into the intestinal tract of the recipient horse in order to treat a specific disease associated with intestinal microbiome imbalance.[5] It may thus represent a novel, cost-effective therapy to successfully restore gut function in horses with colitis and diarrhea.",

            "text": "It has recently been shown that the fecal bacterial microbiota of horses with colitis of various etiologies is less diverse than that of unaffected animals.[3, 6] As with horses, acute and chronic diarrhea in humans may also be associated with intestinal dysbiosis. Consistent with the importance of a balanced intestinal microbiota, antibiotic therapy has been inadequate in the treatment of human colitis due to specific pathogens such as Clostridium difficile. A well-described clinical trial in humans with refractory, chronic C. difficile diarrhea showed over 85% effectiveness for one FMT, and over 90% effectiveness for two FMTs in comparison to standard treatment with vancomycin. A recent study in mice further demonstrated that autologous FMT significantly enhanced fecal and gastrointestinal microbiota reconstitution in mice following antimicrobial treatment.[7] Similarly, anecdotal information arising from a small number of horses suggests that fecal consistency normalizes following FMT[8] and that chronic diarrhea may improve in response to microbial transplantation.[9] Development of FMT as an inexpensive, effective means of restoring the colonic microbiota and thereby combating equine colitis would be of benefit to both the veterinary and equine industry. By leveraging the protective properties of the normal gut microbiota, this treatment modality may also counteract the ever-increasing problem of antibiotic-resistant microbial pathogens.",

Exclusion criteria included any recent gastrointestinal illness (colic, diarrhea), transport, medical treatment, or dietary supplementation with probiotics. Breed, age, body condition score, heart rate, respiratory rate, rectal temperature, attitude, and borborygmi were recorded prior to manure collection.

Briefly, random subsamples of 5000 sequences per sample were processed. Pairwise weighted UniFrac phylogenetic distances [23] between samples were calculated in mothur using program unifrac.weighted. The UniFrac distance ranges from 0 for identical samples to 1 for samples that are completely different and share no sequences or no taxa. GenAlEx [24] was used to draw Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) plots using weighted UniFrac distance matrices as input. Analysis of Similarity (ANOSIM) [25] was used to test the significance of clustering by treatment. Program anosim was run in mothur using weighted UniFrac distance matrices as input. Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) were obtained using program cluster and the OptiClust clustering method [26]. A distance cut-off of 3% was applied. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) as implemented in program LEfSe [27] was used to identify statistically significant differences in OTU abundance profiles between two groups of samples defined by dietary treatment. Shannon diversity was also calculated in mothur. Constrained ordination analysis was performed in CANOCO [28].",

More specifically, increasing abundance of Verrucomicrobia and increasing \u03b1-diversity was observed in treatment responders. The latter group established a microbiome that more closely resembled the donor horse following 3 consecutive daily fecal transplants. In this study, diminishing UniFrac distance over time between donor and FMT recipient was suggestive of transplanted bacteria colonizing the gastro-intestinal tract of the recipient horse and normalizing the intestinal microbiome. Re-establishing a healthy gut microbiome in horses with colitis is considered essential to digestion, is expected to act as a bulwark against pathogenic bacteria and may stimulate the development of a robust and effective immune system to counteract infection. Additionally, normal microbial inhabitants of the gut are thought to help maintain a balance between inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators in the intestinal tract,[29] and may stimulate mucus production that prevents the attachment of pathogenic bacteria.[30] The observed increase in relative abundance of mucus-dwelling Verrucomicrobia is consistent with increased mucus production which serves as a barrier to pathogens [31]. As such, FMT could aid in the restoration of gut function in horses with colitis and resolution of diarrhea.",

Bacterial species richness and diversity are important elements of a healthy intestinal microbiome, and a reduction in richness and diversity has been associated with conditions such as chronic diarrhea and recurrent C. difficile infection (CDI) in humans.[32, 33] Moreover, FMT was shown to be highly effective in treating recurrent Clostridium difficile infections in people,[34]. While similar data in veterinary species are less abundant to date, FMT has also been associated with faster resolution of parvovirus-associated diarrhea in puppies compared to standard treatments.[35] Therefore, if FMT can establish a more diverse microbiome in horses with colitis, this procedure may represent a cost-effective therapy to facilitate restoration of gut function in horses with dysbiosis or colitis. Anecdotal reports have previously suggested that fecal consistency may normalize following FMT in horses,[36] and that chronic diarrhea may improve in response to microbial transplantation.[9]. A recent study evaluating the efficacy of FMT in the treatment of horses with chronically increased free fecal water showed improved fecal consistency after 14 days post FMT, which persisted throughout the entire study period of 164 days.[37] In contrast to colitis, Free Fecal Water Syndrome (FFWS) is a condition recognized in horses with normal feces that freely pass fecal liquid before, after, or during defecation.[38] Emerging data, therefore, support the potential efficacy of FMT in restoring eubiosis of the gut in horses, similar to observations in people and dogs.",

In contrast, a relatively low abundance of Verrucomicrobia was noted in diarrheic horses, with an inverse correlation between diarrhea score and relative Verrucomicrobia abundance. These mucus-dwelling bacteria primarily reside on the intestinal mucosa and are believed to contribute to intestinal health and glucose homeostasis. Previous equine work has demonstrated that horses with colitis may also show decreases in Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Spirochetes with an increase in Fusobacteria.[3, 39] The fecal microbiome of most FMT recipients in the current report differed significantly from that of healthy horses, with a high \u03b2-diversity between diarrheic horses. For example, there were no apparent commonalities between the microbiome of the 2 non-surviving horses that did not respond to FMT (Horses F and W, Fig 3), indicating a different etiology of colitis. The microbiome of Horse F was extremely rich in Proteobacteria (genus: Trabulsiella), a feature that was not observed in the second non-responder (Horse W). Firmicutes were under-represented in W's microbiome and no increase in Verrucomicrobia abundance was observed in this horse following FMT (Fig 3). Horse W was ultimately diagnosed with enterolithiasis and Horse F was treated with broad-spectrum antimicrobials throughout the study period, whereas no other FMT recipients were exposed to systemic or enteral antimicrobials. It has been well established in horses that systemic antimicrobials lead to changes in the intestinal microbiota, with different and specific responses to different antimicrobials.[40] Whether FMT can mitigate or reverse intestinal dysbiosis in the face of concurrent antimicrobial administration has not been established to date.",

In contrast, previous reports have documented inconsistent effects of advancing age on the equine intestinal microbiome, with both inverse[14] and direct relationships[13] being observed between aging and fecal microbial diversity. The current study suggests that age-matching between donor and FMT recipients is not required to optimize microbial transplantation in adult horses. However, advancing age is generally associated with a higher incidence of age-related health conditions. To reduce the risk of donor comorbidities, individuals aged <60 years are preferred as human fecal donors, based on a recent consensus conference on fecal microbiome transplantation in people.[34] Similar considerations may apply to horses, and reiterate the need to establish standardized protocols to optimize the effects of FMT in clinical practice. For example, choosing donor and recipients that receive similar diets may be more essential than age-matching, to restore intestinal eubiosis in adult horses with colitis.[41]",

Healthy fecal donor samples were collected from 5 study locations in close geographical proximity. Since different locations also differed by diet, it is not feasible to fully assess the impact of diet by itself on the fecal microbiome. Study location \u201cUc\u201d was the only site where horses did not have access to pasture. Consistent with a strong effect of diet on the equine fecal microbiome observed by others [14], microbiome samples from \u201cUc\u201d were significantly different from the other 3 sites in pairwise ANOSIM tests (S6 Table). While access to pasture is reported to increase microbiome diversity, a broad spectrum of factors are known to affect the equine intestinal microbiome, including feed, environmental conditions (e.g. geographic location, climate, hygiene, fasting, transportation, exercise), inflammation, and the use of external compounds, such as prebiotics, probiotics and antibiotics.[39] Our observations support that the effect of diet on the therapeutic impact of FMT should be considered. For example, a greater abundance of Bacillus-Lactobacillus-Streptococcus (BLS) group bacteria was previously reported in horses maintained on a concentrate diet versus a grass-only diet,[42] predicting that variable FMT effects may be based on fecal donor source. Future research aimed at better understanding the association between donor microbiome diversity and effect of FMT should thus be considered. The endpoint of such research would be the identification of a minimal set of bacterial species that could be combined into an optimized synthetic probiotic preparation.[43]",

However, larger case-controlled studies are needed to ensure reliability of these results. The fecal microbiome assessment of both healthy geriatric and young-adult horses suggests that age-matching between donor and FMT recipients is not necessary to optimize microbial transplantation in adult horses, while diet-matching may be prudent.",
