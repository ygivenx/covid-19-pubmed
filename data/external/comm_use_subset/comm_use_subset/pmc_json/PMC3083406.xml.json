Recently, Google.org developed Google Flu Trends, a model to estimate US influenza-like illness (ILI) rates from internet searches. The model was fit to CDC sentinel provider surveillance data for ILI from 2003 to 2007 and prospectively validated using the same surveillance system during the 2007\u201308 influenza season. During the 2007\u201308 influenza season, Google Flu Trends estimates were highly correlated to CDC surveillance for ILI, with a mean correlation coefficient over nine US Census Regions of 0.97 [2].",

ILI is not specific to influenza, however. Prospective studies with laboratory sampling of persons with ILI have demonstrated a wide variability in the specificity of ILI for influenza disease, with the proportion of subjects testing positive for influenza ranging from 20% to 70% of those tested during the influenza season [3], [4]. ILI may also not be sensitive for influenza, particularly in certain age or risk groups where influenza may have atypical presentations [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. Furthermore, even during peak periods of influenza circulation, a substantial number of cases of febrile respiratory illness may have non-influenza etiologies. In the United States, during the spring wave of the 2009 H1N1 outbreak from March through August 2009, the proportion of positive influenza laboratory tests did not exceed 45% (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly, accessed 09/04/09).",

The remaining surveillance data were obtained from CDC. These data were from two separate surveillance networks: Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (CDC ILI Surveillance) and the US Influenza Virologic Surveillance System (CDC Virus Surveillance). CDC ILI Surveillance consists of a network of health care providers who record the weekly proportion of patients who present with non-specific signs and symptoms that meet a case definition of influenza-like illness [10]. CDC Virus Surveillance consists of about 140 laboratories located throughout the United States that report the weekly total specimens tested and laboratory tests positive for influenza virus [10]. This is the only US surveillance system that provides national and regional data of laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection. CDC Virus Surveillance is used in CDC statistical models in the estimation of influenza-associated morbidity and mortality [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]. For this analysis, CDC Influenza Virus Surveillance was used as the reference standard to which Google Flu Trends and CDC ILI Surveillance were compared.",

Subsequently, additional correlation coefficients with 95% CI were calculated from surveillance comparisons by influenza season, US Census Region, and influenza season categorized by US Census Region. These subset analyses were summarized with mean correlation coefficients and standard deviations (SD). Next, because Flu Trends was previously found to lead CDC ILI Surveillance observations by one to two weeks [2], we undertook additional correlation analyses to determine whether Google Flu Trends or CDC ILI Surveillance had a stronger correlation with CDC Virus surveillance data for the subsequent one or two weeks.

Individual observations were considered influential if they had a DFBETA greater than the absolute value of 2 divided by the square root of the total number of observations in the model [17]. Subsequently, all influential observations were excluded and correlation coefficients were recalculated as had been done in the primary analysis. Correlation coefficients from the sensitivity analysis were compared to the same statistic from the primary analysis to determine whether any relevant changes in the strength of correlation had occurred with the removal of influential observations.

However, CDC ILI Surveillance and positive influenza tests were more correlated during the five years of this study, including the unusual 2003\u201304 influenza season, than were Google Flu Trends and positive influenza tests. We hypothesize that differences in internet search behavior, patient health care seeking behavior, and physician testing practices may alter the correlation between influenza surveillance systems. In the absence of influenza virologic surveillance, sentinel surveillance for ILI may more accurately monitor influenza activity than Google Flu Trends during anomalous influenza seasons. Furthermore, given the non-specific nature of ILI, robust nationwide virologic surveillance remains critical to the understanding of influenza activity during inter-pandemic and pandemic periods alike.",
