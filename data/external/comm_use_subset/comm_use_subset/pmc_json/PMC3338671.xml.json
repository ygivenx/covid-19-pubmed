The most prevalent rice viruses are plant-infecting reoviruses in the genera Phytoreovirus, Fijivirus and Oryzavirus of the family Reoviridae. Southern rice black streak dwarf virus (SRBSDV), commonly known as Rice black-streaked dwarf virus 2 (RBSDV 2), is a novel member of the Fijivirus\n[2]. Since its first observation in 2001 in Guangdong, China, SRBSDV has spread rapidly and now causes large yield losses throughout southern and central China, northern Vietnam, and recently has been identified in northern China [3], [4] and Japan [5]. When infected with SRBSDV, rice often develops stunted stems, dark green, twisted leaves, and white waxy swellings along veins on the abaxial surface of the leaves. When infected in seedling stage, rice shows more severe stunting and occasionally dried necrotic leaves. With infections after tillering, stunting is usually not so obvious, but disrupted head development and shrunken grains are apparent in many fields.",

Recently, transcriptomes of the planthoppers Nilaparvata lugens and Laodelphax striatellus were reported using next-generation DNA sequencing techniques [15], [16]. Transcriptional response of whitefly to a geminivirus was also reported [17]. These papers provide considerable information relevant to the genomics of planthoppers and whiteflies, and also generate some insight into the molecular mechanisms of insect defense against virus infection. However, the genomic resources available for WBPH are still scarce and searches in GenBank identified only about 156 WBPH ESTs. Hence, this limited amount of data provides little information for transcriptional, proteomic, and gene functional analysis of WBPH and almost no information is available to dissect the complicated interactions between the newly emerged SRBSDV and its vector WBPH. However, next-generation high-throughput DNA sequencing technique has provided unprecedented fascinating opportunities for gene discovery of WBPH and detection of the global transcription responses to SRBSDV infection.",

Using paired end-joining and gap-filling methods, these contigs were further assembled into 241,380 scaffolds with a mean length of 295 base pair (bp). After clustering the scaffolds with the nucleotide sequences available at NCBI, sequence data from the two libraries were combined, and 81388 unigenes were finally obtained with a mean length of 555 bp (Table 1). The length distribution of total unigenes had similar patterns between viruliferous and non-viruliferous WBPH samples, suggesting there was no bias in the construction of the cDNA libraries (Figure 1). However, some unigenes were obtained only from viruliferous or non-viruliferous samples (data not shown) and we believe these differences may be caused by distinctions that arise from long-term ecological adaptation to virus infection.

Among 30,987 annotated unigenes, approximately 18045 (58.23%) of the unigenes could be annotated in GO based on sequence homology (Table S3). When compared with the other two rice planthoppers (N. lugens and L. striatellus), WBPH had a very similar GO distribution (Figure 3). This distribution is quite reasonable given that the three sap-feeding planthopper species not only belong to the same family Delphacidae in the evolutionary level, but also have similar ecological niches in the rice eco-system. In addition, GO analysis also showed a similar distribution of gene functions for non-viruliferous and viruliferous WBPH (Figure 4), indicating that the number of genes expressed in each GO category was not significantly affected by SRBSDV infection.",

According to predictions, about 7.26% of protein-coding sequences possessed such repeats, of which 62.43% were trinucleotide repeats, with (AAG) n being the most frequent motif (39.8%), followed by 16.62% dinucleotide and 0.7% tetranucleotide repeats (Figure 5, Table S4). The results are consistent with the recent reports indicating that trinucleotide repeats are the most abundant microsatellites in coding ESTs [19], [20]. Previous work revealed that (AAC) n is the most frequent motif in L. striatellus\n[16]. The different predicted trinucleotide repeats in the two transcriptomes defined for the two available rice planthopper genomes may reflect distinct adaptive behaviors of these related insects. The large numbers of potential molecular markers found in our study will be particularly useful for future genetic mapping, parentage analysis, genotyping and gene flow studies of these species.",

            "text": "As mentioned above, viral infections cause dramatic changes in cellular and metabolic processes. For the primary metabolism analyses, 225 out of 3315 genes (6.8%) were down-regulated in viruliferous WBPH, most of which were involved in translation, amino acid metabolism, and biosynthesis of ribosomes, spliceosomes and aminoacyl-tRNAs (Table 2 and Figure 9). These results suggest that protein synthesis and amino acid metabolism of viruliferous WBPH were inhibited by SRBSDV infection, which are consistent with previous reports in wasps (Campoletis sonorensis) and whiteflies [17], [24]. In wasps, when infected by a polydnavirus, translation of specific growth-associated host proteins was inhibited [24]; and in whiteflies, the primary metabolism genes were dramatically down-regulated by Tomato yellow leaf curl China virus (TYLCCNV) infection [17]. In addition, our results indicated that a large percentage of the genes involved in lipid metabolism and lipogeneic compound metabolism were up-regulated (Table 2 and Figure 9). In contrast to whiteflies, TYLCCNV infection causes the down-regulation of lipid metabolism. A possible explanation for this phenomenon is the differences in replication styles of the two viruses. SRBSDV, a typical dsRNA virus, replicates their genomes strictly in the cytoplasm, and the lipid biosynthesis and related pathways are necessary for membrane proliferation that occurs in infected cells. TYLCCNV is a DNA virus that enters nucleus directly for its genome replication, membrane proliferation is less extensive. Effects on lipid metabolism have also been reported in other virus infections, for instance, human cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection resulted in increases in the flux of the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway genes that were essential for optimal viral growth in fibroblasts [25]. Furthermore, Hepatitis C virus has been shown to co-opt the prenylation pathway to promote the efficient replication of its genome and possibly encapsidation [26], [27]. All of these observations together with our data suggest that perturbation of lipid metabolism in a range of virally infected cells is a hallmark of cellular changes associated with viral infection.",

So viruses have developed strategies to regulate the host cell cycle to facilitate their replication. Our results indicated that 231 out 3315 genes (7.0%) related to cell cycle were altered (Table 3). Compared with the mitotic (M) phase, there were more up-regulated genes during inter-phase according to our DGE results (data not shown). Meanwhile, pathway enrichment analyses also showed that gene expression patterns in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway were significantly altered. The proteasome is the major non-lysosomal proteolytic machine in eukaryotes [31]. In animals and plants, perturbation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway has already been shown to be caused by many viruses [32], [33]. For example, Adenovirus E1A protein can directly interact with the 19 S proteasome regulatory components (S4 and S8), that are involved in regulation of the activities of 26S proteasome [34]. Inhibition of the proteasome by different chemical compounds not only impairs entry but also affects RNA synthesis and subsequent protein expression in Coronavirus infections [35]. Ubiquitination and deubiquitination of the nucleoprotein (NP) were also reported to regulate the replication of Influenza A virus RNA [36]. In the plant phyla, the geminivirus BSCTV C2 protein was reported to attenuate the degradation of SAMDC1 and suppresses DNA methylation-mediated gene silencing by inhibiting 26 S proteasome pathway in Arabidopsis\n[37]. Also in Arabidopsis, perturbation of ubiquitin-proteasome system affects accumulation of Turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase during viral infection [38]. In our work, 72 out of 3315 differentially expressed genes were related to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, and a majority of these were down-regulated (Table 3 and Figure 9). The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is involved in regulation of metabolic adaptation and immune responses and may function by degrading numerous short-lived proteins, such as regulatory proteins [39]\u2013[41]. Indeed, all of these pathways were significantly affected in viruliferous WBPH.",

Cytoskeleton-dependent intracellular transport is a common strategy for virus transport to intracellular destinations [42]\u2013[47]. For example, association with microtubules is necessary for the release of Rice gall dwarf virus (RGDV) from cultured insect vector cells [48]; the Pns10 of Rice dwarf virus (RDV) induces tubular structures that facilitate virus spread in the vector Nephotettix cincticeps\n[49]. RGDV and RDV, together with SRBSDV that we studied in this work, all belong to the Reoviridae family, so a potential similar cytoskeleton regulatory pathway may exist among these viruses. Meanwhile, according to a recent work using a recombinant insect baculovirus expression system, the SRBSDV P7-1 protein formed tubular structures in insect cells [8]. By integrating these data with our transcriptome results, it is reasonable to believe that the dynamics of cytoskeleton has a major role in virus infection.",

Among the differentially expressed genes in viruliferous WBPH, many genes related to cellular and humoral immune response were up-regulated (Table 4 and Figure 9). For example, 65% (52 out 80) of the unigenes were up-regulated in the lysosome pathway. B-cell lymphoma 6 protein (BCL-6), an important regulation factor in humoral immune responses, is believed to be involved in germinal center B-cell functions and the immune response [54], [55]. This protein acts as a sequence-specific repressor of transcription, and has been shown to modulate the transcription of START-dependent IL-4 responses of B cells and altered expression of BCL-6 leads to modulated IL-4 levels and increases in the immune response [56]. Also, among the differentially expressed genes, antimicrobial peptide and melanization-related product synthesizing genes were also up-regulated in the WBPH. Phospholipase A2 products are considered to interfere with viral infection and it has been found that several phospholipases A2 can efficiently protect host cells from HIV-1 replication [57], [58]. Down-regulation of the phospholipase A2 inhibitor subunit B (Table 3) may be helpful for the releasing of active phospholipases A2, and thus improve host defenses against virus attacks.",

The RNAi system was initially described in plants, and in recent years, some work has revealed that RNAi is a major mechanism to target viruses in some insects [60], [61]. In D. melanogaster, Dicer-2 produces siRNAs, whereas Dicer-1 recognizes precursors of miRNAs. In these cases, the small RNAs are assembled with an Argonaute (AGO) protein into related effector complexes, such as the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), to guide specific RNA silencing [59], [61], [62]. In our transcriptome data, we found 31 records of genes (10 AGOs, 16 Dicers, 4 dsRNA binding proteins) involved in the RNA interference pathway. In the DGE results (Table 4), some involved genes were up-regulated in viruliferous WBPH, such as Dicer 1 and Dicer 2, but no substantial difference in the expression levels of putative RNAi related genes was found in the L. striatellus after infection with Rice stripe virus (RSV), a tenuivirus\n[16]. These differences may be caused by the diversity among the replication cycles of the two viruses or the host defense systems. The latter hypothesis is supported by recent findings that RSV and RDV (both plant reoviruses) caused different effects in the rice RNA interference pathway [63].",

Total RNAs from each sample were extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and treated with DNase I (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The concentration of each RNA sample was adjusted to 1 \u00b5g/\u00b5l with nuclease-free water and total RNA was reverse transcribed in a 20 \u00b5l reaction system using the AMV RNA PCR Kit (TaKaRa). qPR-PCR was carried out on the LightCycler 480@ II with LightCycler 480@ SYBR I Master (Roche Applied Science, Basel, Switzerland) under the following conditions: 95\u00b0C for 5 min; and 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 10 s, 60\u00b0C for 15 s, and 72\u00b0C for 20 s, followed by melting curve generation (68\u00b0C to 95\u00b0C). Primers used in qRT-PCR for validation of differentially expressed genes were shown in Table S7. Each gene was analyzed in triplicate, after which the average threshold cycle (CT) was calculated per sample, and an endogenous 18 S rRNA gene of WBPH was used for normalization. A no template control sample (nuclease free water) was included in the experiment to detect contamination and determine the degree of dimer formation (data not shown).",
