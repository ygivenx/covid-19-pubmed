            "text": "Acute infections of the respiratory tract are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in humans worldwide and approximately 80% are caused by viruses [1,2]. The viruses most frequently associated with respiratory tract infections include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses (PIV), influenza viruses (Flu), adenoviruses (AdV), human rhinoviruses (hRV), and enteroviruses, and less commonly, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human bocavirus (HBoV), and human coronaviruses (HCoV). Until recently, it was believed that HCoVs were responsible for the common cold syndrome and were the cause of only mild upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) [3]. After the SARS epidemic in 2003, it was established that these viruses can also be associated with severe, life-threatening, or even fatal respiratory infections [4]. Stewart at al. have also suggested a possible relationship between HCoV infections and the development of extrarespiratory symptoms, including some involving the central nervous system [5]. The role of HCoV in human gastrointestinal infections also awaits more detailed exploration [6,7].",

However, age was associated with the estimated quantity of HCoV viral nucleic acids present (measured as Ct). The association was nonlinear (P < 0.001) and the highest estimated viral load (lowest Ct) was detected in children around 10 months old. The estimated viral load increased with age for children younger than 10 months, whereas it decreased between 10 and 24 months. The estimated shape of the association is shown in Figure 2.",

Due to the retrospective nature of the study, clinical data were not available for all included patients due to the noncomprehensive or missing clinical documentation. The reasons for the missing clinical data were that children were hospitalized due to the respiratory tract infection but were not stationed in pulmonary department and were distributed to other departments of the children's hospital because of the overcrowding. For these patients the clinical records were not available to investigators. Another limitation of this study is the fact that different samples were taken in some of the patients i.e. oropharyngeal instead of nasopharyngeal swab) and this could influence the yields of coronavirus (as well as other respiratory viruses). However due to the retrospective nature of the study we couldn't influence the sampling descisions made at the clinic. The politics of sample collection in place was that nasopharyngeal swab is preferred as the optimal sample but in cases where the physical or psychological conditions of the patient would not allow for safe nasopharyngeal swab collection, the laboratory would accept the oropharyngeal swab. The samples such as tracheal aspirates or BAL samples were collected from the severly affected children. All samples originated from hospitalized patients and that can also be considered as source of selection bias. Samples from outpatients and healthy control group children would be desirable in the study to determine HCoV prevalence and clinical features more accurately and also to exclude the possibility that viruses are detected as \u201ccontaminants\u201d or \u201cnormal flora\u201d. Due to the retrospective nature of the study, follow up testing was not performed. At the time of the study, detection of respiratory viruses was routinely performed by DFA instead of PCR which might underestimate the true prevalence of infections. However, we believe that these differences in sensitivity are not very prominent, especially in regard to detection of RSV virus and the fact that the study population represents young children in which DFA has best sensitivity.",
