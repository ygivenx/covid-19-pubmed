[6] and since then it has been globally reported in endemic areas [5, 7]. While subclinical feline infections are common in areas where canine leishmaniosis (CanL) is endemic, clinical illness due to FeL is rare [7, 8]. Clinical disease is frequently associated with possible impaired immunocompetence, as in case of retroviral co-infections, immunosuppressive therapy, or malignant neoplasia [7, 8]. The immune response plays a crucial role in the control of Leishmania infection. Albeit some differences according to the host species, T cells modulate and orient, through cytokine production, macrophage reaction to the parasite [9\u201311]. Antigen processing cells (dendritic cells and macrophages) present L. infantum antigens to CD4+ T cells that modulate the type of immune response [12]. A T helper 1 (Th1) oriented immune response, associated with production of interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3), interleukin (IL)-2 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), stimulates phagocytosis by macrophages, their production of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen intermediate and consequent phagocyte-based parasite intracellular elimination [11, 13]. Conversely, in dogs susceptibility to infection and disease progression is mediated predominantly by a non-protective T helper 2 (Th2) immune response and the production of cytokines such as IL-4, IL-10, IL-13 and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) which are associated with downregulation of the cellular immune response, a high level of antibodies, and L. infantum dissemination [9\u201311].",

It is well recognized that cats appear to be less frequently affected by arthropod-borne diseases when compared to dogs, although no important differences are known between the canine and feline immune systems [15]. Interestingly, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have so far evaluated L. infantum-specific cell-mediated immunity in cats. However, detection of IFN-\u03b3 in antigen stimulated whole blood or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was used in cats to evaluate cellular immune response mechanisms to other pathogens (e.g. feline coronavirus or Toxoplasma gondii) [16\u201318].",

Sex, age class, breed, clinical status, lifestyle of pet cats (indoors, outdoors), and number of stray cats at each sampling site are summarized in Table 1. Age was classified as follows: young (6\u201318 months); adult (between 19 and 96 months); and old (> 96 months). The clinical status of cats was defined as \u201csick\u201d or \u201capparently healthy\u201d based on data available from history and physical examination. Sick cats were considered when clinical signs compatible with FeL (i.e. lymph node enlargement, skin, mucosal or eye lesions, stomatitis, weight loss, chronic kidney disease, anaemia) were found as previously described [7].

The prevalence of cats producing IFN-\u03b3 after stimulation with ConA was above 90% in both groups (Table 2); however, among 64 cats exposed to L. infantum (i.e. positive to at least one specific test), sick individuals (n = 25) had a significantly higher median concentration [2159 pg/ml; (25\u201375) = 965.3\u20134508 pg/ml] than apparently healthy cats (n = 39) [1712.5 pg/ml; (25\u201375) = 87.1\u20132946 pg/ml] (Mann-Whitney U-test, Z = 339, P = 0.0117). The concentration of IFN-\u03b3 produced after stimulation with ConA was significantly higher in the IFN\u03b3-p group (Mann-Whitney U-test, Z = 1473, P = 0.0008) (Table 3) and IFN-\u03b3 concentrations after ConA or LSA stimulations were positively correlated (Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficient, rs = 0.264, P = 0.0001). Additionally, ELISA antibody levels were positively correlated with IFN-\u03b3 concentrations from ConA stimulated cultures (Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficient, rs = 0.209, P = 0.0001).",

Production of ConA-IFN-\u03b3 suggests non-specific T cell activation. Surprisingly, when considering cats exposed to L. infantum (i.e. positive to at least one the specific tests performed), sick individuals produced a significantly higher level of ConA compared to apparently healthy individuals. This finding is unusual, and it is difficult to interpret due to the limitations of a clinical evaluation only based on physical examination and clinical history. In dogs with CanL, ConA-IFN-\u03b3 concentrations do not vary significantly in different LeishVet clinical stages, unless in the severe stage of disease (LeishVet stage IV) when a significantly lower concentration is observed [10].",

In fact, the prevalence of L. infantum was 5% for blood PCR and 22% for antibody detection but the combination of results obtained by serological and molecular testing did not increase the percentage of positivity because all PCR positive cats were also positive for L. infantum antibodies (Fig. 1).
