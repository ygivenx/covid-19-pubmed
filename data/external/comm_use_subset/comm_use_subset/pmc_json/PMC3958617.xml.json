Furthermore, >1200 bat species provide an unparalleled exhibition of variations on the mammalian theme and a broad lesson in biology (4, 5). In recent years, bats have gained significant notoriety after being implicated in numerous emerging infectious disease events, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak 10 years ago and the current Middle East respiratory syndrome endemic (6\u20138). Moreover, bats have been suggested to be important reservoir hosts of many highly lethal zoonotic viruses that can cross species barriers to infect humans and other domestic or wild mammals, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Marburg virus, Hendra virus and Nipah virus (9\u201311). Their ability to fly and social life history enable efficient virus maintenance, evolution and spread. Therefore, it is essential to enhance our knowledge and understanding of the genetic diversity of bat-associated viruses to prevent future outbreaks.",

The related GenBank records were then downloaded and parsed using in-house BioPerl scripts to generate readable profiles for further expert review (24). Sequences of phages, insect and plant viruses, as well as samples derived from animals other than bats, were manually excluded. The associated metadata of each sequence, such as the sampling time, location, bat species, specimen type (e.g. feces, blood or tissues) and viral detection method (e.g. polymerase chain reaction or metagenomics), were further extracted from the related literature (if available) or the original GenBank records. Taxonomic information of all viruses and bats were retrieved from the Taxonomy database of NCBI. Additional information concerning the viruses, such as genome organization, average size and virion illustrations, and the bats, including common names, diet type and geographic distribution, were further collected from the ViralZone database (25) and the ICUN Red List (www.iucnredlist.org), respectively. The detailed phylogenetic relationships between the different bats, which were available from a previous study (26), were also carefully integrated into the database.",

Direct links to individual tabs in the content panel are given for each branch of the trees in the submenus. The main content panel presents a uniform grid for each tab that includes brief information on the viruses (species and family), specimens (sample type, collection date and sampling country), associated bats (species, family and diet type), determined sequences and related literature (exemplified in the right panel of Figure 1A). Each line of the table is expandable with a double click to show additional information, such as virus detection method, detailed sampling location, GenBank accessions and length of related sequences. Furthermore, a clickable linear map is offered for each complete viral sequence to highlight the genomic organization of the virus (Figure 1A). Handy buttons are provided on the bottom toolbar to export the grid as local Excel tables or to download the related sequences in FASTA format for further offline analyses. Browsing the data by virus and bat taxonomic categories is valuable to understand the host range of viruses and virome diversity of bats. For instance, from current data, the most widely distributed virus among bats is coronavirus, which has been detected from all the 10 bat families studied to date (Table 1). The bat family Vespertilionidae has been involved in 20 of the 23 virus families detected in bats so far (Table 1). It is reasonable given the fact that Vespertilionidae is the biggest family of bats containing >40 genera.\n",

For a quick start, a single entry that is instantly familiar to users of common Internet search engines is offered. In addition, a configurable query form is available for advanced users to perform customized complex searches of all information in the database (Figure 1B). The search results are displayed in an individual tab in the content panel with explicit tables of bat-associated viruses matching the query. The result table is a high-performance grid as aforementioned, which enables instant sorting, filtering and table/sequences downloading, as well as easy online statistical analyses on the query output. Thus, the text search utility is not only useful to quickly extract required information but also valuable to make specialized analyses on any customized subset of the data from the database. For example, both feces and swabs are widely investigated samples of bats, and >500 viruses were detected from either type of samples worldwide. However, the viruses detected from swabs involve 17 virus families, whereas those from feces are limited to 11 families. It is noteworthy that swabs are a generic sample type that include fecal swabs, rectal swabs, oral swabs, nasal swabs and others. But many studies mixed different kinds of swabs (or even different types of samples) for easy virus detection. So researchers should be more specific in any cross-study comparative analysis and more cautious in follow-up data interpretation.",

The searching output is present in the BLAST result tab in the content panel. Cross-links to the corresponding sequences in GenBank and DBatVir are provided for all hits in the output. The genetic diversity of newly emerged bat-associated viruses is always one of the interesting focuses. For instance, four to five genetically distinct virus strains of henipaviruses have been detected with different virological and biological properties (31). Therefore, to facilitate follow-up sequence analyses, an integrated pipeline for online multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree construction based on the BLAST result is also provided. Users can customize the sequences to be included in follow-up phylogenetic analyses according to their similarities with the query sequence to avoid potential redundancy. The produced multiple alignment and phylogenetic tree can be easily displayed online or downloaded for further offline analyses.",

To bridge the gap between virologists and zoologists, the information concerning the bats, such as the common names, diet type and known distribution, as well as the phylogeny of bats are carefully integrated into DBatVir. All bat-related information are presented in a sortable and filterable table, along with example photos of each bat species and useful external links for convenient access to additional information (Figure 1C). Users can use the search entry on the bottom toolbar to quickly extract the information of interested bats by name, diet type or distributed country. Moreover, an intuitive global map with markers indicating the known distributed countries of each bat species is available for users to easily understand the distribution range of the bat. Good knowledge of bats is essential for better interpretation of the data on bat-associated viruses. For example, the incongruent associations between the phylogenies of bats and their SARS-related coronaviruses revealed recent host shifts, which may assist in understanding the emergence of SARS (33). Majority of bats are insectivores, and most of the rest are frugivores. The current data show that the predominant virus families detected in insectivorous and frugivorous bats are Rhabdoviridae and Paramyxoviridae, respectively. This implies the potential association between bat's diet and the associated virome.",

Effective prediction of future viral zoonoses requires an in-depth understanding of the heterologous viral population in key animal species that will likely serve as reservoir hosts or intermediates during the next viral epidemic (13). The importance of bats as natural hosts for several important viral agents, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Marburg virus, Hendra virus, Nipah virus and SARS coronavirus, has been established (9\u201311, 34). Moreover, the past decade has experienced a surge in the discovery of emerging viruses of bat origin, several of which have had a significant impact on public health, tourism and trade.

More extensive surveillance in other species of bats and at other geographic locations may be needed to identify more viruses with the potential to cause human diseases or novel viruses related to known human pathogens. To our knowledge, DBatVir is the only publicly available web resource dedicated to bat-associated animal viruses thus far. It devotes to provide comprehensive, up-to-date and well-curated information to the scientific community worldwide. DBatVir will not only be helpful to virologists who want to better understand the virome diversity of bats but will also be useful to zoologists concerned with the health of domestic and wild animals.
