Since then, more than 30 independent transmission events have been documented between the zoonotic world and the human world, and more than 2,300 human cases have been recorded [1]. The outbreak that began in West Africa in 2014, however, has changed the equation considerably; although it began in a remote district of Guinea [2], it has magnified massively, caused large numbers of cases and deaths in three West African countries, dispersed into three other West African countries, and \u201cjumped\u201d now several times out of Africa to North America and Europe. That is the bad news, which is measured in human mortality and suffering.",

Already, several vaccines and treatments have been fast-tracked for testing and distribution and are producing promising results with the relatively few patients who have been able to access them. Surely this research has not been generated just in the past few months; rather, these steps forward derive from years of \u201clow priority,\u201d minimally funded research that had made significant progress [3], laying a foundation for rapid advances [4]. Clearly, the reason why no Ebola vaccine was already in hand was that research funders and pharmaceutical industry investors had not made it a priority, likely because the disease was not perceived as a threat, or as a good investment.",

In a recent hearing of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee of the US House of Representatives, Representative Jim Jordan (Republican, Ohio) confronted Dr. Nicole Lurie, Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services for Emergency Preparedness and Response, with a $38 million list of NIH expenditures that he considered unnecessary (e.g., fruit and vegetable puppet shows stressing healthy menus for children and studies encouraging senior citizens to join choirs). He asked, \u201cwouldn\u2019t we now have two Ebola vaccines if we hadn\u2019t spent money on those?\u201d [5]. The usual rhetoric about unnecessary grant spending and the lack of understanding of the importance of diet and activity in maintaining health both aside, Rep. Jordan missed the fact that Ebola was very low on the list of priorities until it threatened to spread broadly to the US this year and never would have seen any benefit were those $38 million to have been freed up, or even if the NIH budget were to have increased substantively, as is badly needed.",

Only when they spread into the US and European realm did these diseases see intense research attention\u2014the arrival of West Nile virus in North America [9] is an excellent example: a total of 278 publications accumulated from 1942 through 1998, but yearly numbers of publications averaged 420 once the virus arrived (Fig. 1).

Such neglected diseases include Chagas disease, human African trypanosomiasis, the leishmaniases, echinococcosis, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis, Buruli ulcer, and many others [11]. Although research on neglected tropical diseases is supported by several US government programs (e.g., President's Malaria Initiative, President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, and USAID\u2019s Neglected Tropical Disease Program), as well as by several international and nongovernmental efforts (e.g., Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; Children\u2019s Investment Fund Foundation; World Bank Group), clearly, the challenge is costlier than present resources can manage [12].",
