The drug binding ability of HSA is directly related to the effectiveness of clinical therapy due to its strongly influences on the free drug concentrations in the plasma. Therefore, drug-binding ability towards HSA is a crucial factor that should be carefully considered in drug research [3]. Bovine serum albumin (BSA, Fig 1b) has an excellent structural similarity with HSA and a repeating pattern of disulphide bonds [4]. So it has been studied extensively as a replacement for HSA due to its easy accessibility and high stability [5\u20139].",

            "text": "Danhong injection (DHI) is a Chinese Materia Medica standardized product that is extracted from Danshen (Radix Salviae miltiorrhizae) and Honghua (Flos Carthami tinctorii). DHI is mainly used to clinically treat ischemic encephalopathy and coronary heart disease due to its ability to promote blood circulation and resolve stasis to promote regeneration[10, 11]. Previous studies demonstrated that salvianolic acids from Danshen (Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae), and nucleosides, flavonoids, phenylethanoid glycosides from Honghua (Flos Carthami Tinctorii) might be the most potent active components for the therapeutic effect of DHI[12\u201315]. In vitro experiments have identified some of these natural components binding to HSA or BSA [16\u201319],but many components still need to be carefully studied. These studies were carried out under relatively \u201cpure\u201d conditions, ignoring the complex conditions under which natural products exist in plants. Indeed, as in DHI, a variety of main components coexist together, affecting the interaction between a single component with serum albumin. Therefore, investigating these active components\u2019 (Fig 2) binding abilities of BSA and discussing the influence on serum albumin binding between these components when coexisting would provide meaningful insight into the transport, distribution, metabolism of DHI, and a new perspective to reveal the compatibility principle of DHI.",

The decrease of the fluorescence intensity value of BSA at 355 nm followed with the successive addition of SaB and HSYA indicated that these two components could quench the fluorescence of BSA. Meanwhile, the increase of the fluorescence intensity value of BSA at 355 nm followed with the successive addition of Syr indicated that Syr could enhance the fluorescence of BSA. All these results suggested that SaB, HSYA, and Syr could bind to BSA and induce the microenvironment transformations around the BSA protein. The peak position of each fluorescence emission spectra was maintained at 355 nm without any blue shift or red shift, suggesting that the binding of these three natural components did not cause obvious changes in the polarity environment around the chromophore of tryptophan [31, 32]. The quenching efficiency of SaB was much greater than that of HSYA at the same concentration, and the subsequent addition of SaB increased the emission at ~490 nm due to SaB being bound to BSA. In addition, the occurrence of an isoactinic point at 445 nm was considered as direct evidence of the existence of SaB-BSA complex, which suggested that there to be a static quenching process in the SaB-BSA binding system. Beyond these three components, there was no obvious change in the fluorescence spectra of BSA with the successive addition of the other five components, possibly due to the very low binding of these five components with BSA leading to very little changes in the microenvironment around the chromophore of tryptophan.",

According to fluorescence spectrometry studies, SaB and HSYA can quench the intrinsic fluorescence of BSA, and the quantum yield of fluorescence decreased with the increasing quencher molecule concentration. Fluorescence quenching can be divided into static quenching procedure and dynamic quenching procedure. The static quenching is usually resulted from the formation of a stable complex between the protein and quencher, while, the dynamic quenching is usually resulted from collisional encounters between the protein and quencher [33]. Both the static and dynamic quenching procedure can be described using the linear Stern-Volmer equation[34\u201338] as follows:\nF0/F=1+Kq\u03c40Q=1+KsvQ(1)\n",

These two calculated Kq values were all far higher than the maximum scatter collision quenching constant (2\u00d71010 M-1 s-1). It is indicated that both of the quenching processes of SaB and HSYA to BSA were initiated by static quenching mechanism. This result confirmed the above analysis of fluorescence emission spectrometry. The binding parameters Ka that were obtained from the Eq (2) for SaB and HSYA were 8.34\u00d7104 M-1 and 0.31\u00d7104 M-1, respectively. The values of Kb and n of SaB and HSYA were also calculated by plotting log[(F0-F)/F] against log[Q]. The binding constant (Kb) of SaB (18.6\u00d7104 M-1) was still larger than that of HSYA (1.48\u00d7104 M-1). The value of n for SaB and HSYA was 1.10and 1.11, respectively. Therefore, it has been proved that there was only one class of binding site for SaB and HSYA on BSA. All of the parameters for SaB were consistent with previous studies [16]. Based on the above data, we concluded that SaB-BSA binding was stronger than the binding of HSYA-BSA due to the much higher values of KSV, Kq, and Kb [42]. As to fluorescence enhancement situation, the fluorescence data of Syr were analyzed using Eq (4). The binding constant K was 2.7\u00d7104 M-1 for the Syr-BSA system.",

The other parameters were also calculated within the linear concentration and are summarized in Table 5. Compared with the binding parameter Kb of \u201cpure\u201d SaB-BSA system, SFDHI decreased the binding parameter Kb of the SaB-BSA system by 32%, and the changes in the other binding parameters, such as Kq, Ksv, and Ka, agreed with those of Kb. Based on the above studies, when DHI was used in the mammal bodies, SaB is released from serum albumin more quickly than when it is used alone, which may increase the concentrations of unbound SaB in plasma and improve the pharmacological effects of SaB.",

The conformation of the protein with site marker is a good starting model for further docking studies. On the other hand, the structural information of BSA with a proper site marker ligand (warfarin nor ibuprofen) was not provided in the Protein Data Bank. We chose the crystallographic structure encoded 4JK4 [28] for docking studies towards BSA. Because 4JK4 is the only crystallographic structure which can provide informations of the amio acid residues lying in site I binding pocket in the presence of a ligand. Moreover, the co-crystallized ligand of 4JK4 is located in both site I and site II binding pocket. It can also used to simulate the amio acid residues lying in site II binding pocket.

Molecular docking studies between these components and BSA/HSA were carried out to provide a molecular explanation for the binding system. According to the results, SaB exhibited a very strong ability to quench the intrinsic fluorescence of BSA through a static quenching procedure. The binding constant (Kb) was 18.6\u00d7104 M-1 at 310 K. HYSA showed a much lower binding ability with binding constant (Kb) of 1.48\u00d7104 M-1 at 310 K. Syr could enhance the intrinsic fluorescence of BSA, and the binding constant (K) was 2.7\u00d7104 at 310 K. Base on these studies, we chose SaB as a research target to investigated the influence of the multi-components coexisting in DHI on serum albumin binding. The results showed that the participation of these natural components in DHI could affect the interaction of the SaB-BSA system. Therefore, we concluded that when DHI is used in mammals, SaB would be released from serum albumin more quickly, which may increase the concentrations of unbound SaB in plasma and improve the pharmacological effects of SaB. This work provides some research basis for the rational clinical use of DHI. And also provide a new perspective to reveal the compatibility principle of DHI.",
