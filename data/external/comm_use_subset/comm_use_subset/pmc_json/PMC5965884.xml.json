            "text": "In recent years, several Hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) outbreaks have occurred in Asia-Pacific region and Europe [1\u20134]. Among them, enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackie A16 (CA16) infection is main cause of HFMD outbreaks, and patients with EV71 infection are inclined to develop into severe symptoms [5, 6]. HFMD is generally considered as a mild exanthematous disease. Generally, most of HFMD cases are usually mild and self-limiting but for few cases viral infection leads to complicated clinical outcomes including brainstem encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, and acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), and even fatal cardiopulmonary failure[7\u20139].Numerous studies have shed light on the etiology and epidemiology of HFMD, and have helped medical professionals and public health officials worldwide understand this condition. Previous studies have found that EV71 enters into the digestive tract first and then enters the lymphatic system, and ultimately into the central nervous system (CNS)[10, 11]. CNS injury can lead to a rapid increase in intracranial pressure, increased sympathetic tone, and excessive activation of local renin-angiotensin system (RAS), further results in over-secretion of many cytokines into circulation, leading to peripheral vasoconstriction. Peripheral vasoconstriction will cause vascular endothelium injury and increased permeability, further inducing blood accumulation in the lower pulmonary region [12\u201315].",

            "text": "The RAS plays a critical action regulating the circulation in the human body in response to low blood pressure or decrease in serum sodium levels [16].A component of this system is angiotensinogen (AGT) that is synthesized and released by the liver into the general circulation. AGT is converted through another reaction into angiotensin I (Ang I) by the protein renin from the renal juxtaglomerular apparatus. Subsequently, Ang I is converted to angiotensin II (Ang II) by the pulmonary angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). AngII is an active octapeptide that acts primarily on Ang II receptor type 1 (AT1R) [16]. Angiotensin II (Ang II) is a key factor to activate AT1R, further inducing water and sodium storage by promoting the release of aldosterone and excessive activation of other neurohormonal system components by promoting the secretion of endothelin and noradrenaline (NA)[17, 18]. High concentration of NA in circulation is thought to associate with pulmonary edema [19], which may involve with fatal pulmonary edema in severe HFMD. The RAS can also activate related cells and regulates the expression of many mediators concerning cell growth and inflammatory responses [20, 21]. However, the role of RAS in the process of HFMD has not been well characterized yet. In the present study, we assumed that RAS participated in the progression of HFMD and tried to uncover the RAS-related potential mechanism in the progression of severe HFMD.",

The concentrations of Ang II among the 5 subgroups of the severe were significantly different and increased from the 2 dpi to 4 dpi (P<0.001). The highest level of Ang II in serum of the severe cases occurred at 3 dpi. The concentrations of Ang II among the 5 subgroups in mild cases were not significantly different. The concentration of NA in serum of severe cases was significantly higher than those in mild cases during the progression of HFMD from 1 dpi to 5 dpi. The concentrations of NA among the 5 subgroups in severe cases were significantly different and increased from 1 dpi to 4 dpi (P<0.001). The highest level of NA in severe cases occurred at 3 dpi. The concentration of NA among the 5 subgroups in mild cases was no significant difference. Our results implied that increasing concentrations of Ang II and NA might participate in the progression of severe HFMD.",

From 2008 to 2012, the mortality of severe HFMD is 1.9%, which is extremely higher than total mortality of HFMD [6, 22]. To date, no effective treatment for severe cases has been found. Thus, to explore early biomarkers to identify cases with potential to develop into severe symptoms will be beneficial to direct early clinical intervention and reduce mortality of HFMD. In the present study, we found that the concentrations of Ang II and NA were increased in serum of HFMD cases with mild or severe symptoms. Increasing concentrations of Ang II and NA in tissue lysates of mice were also determined during EV71 infection.",

First, the system is not only expressed at a systemic level but also works locally in a paracrine function in the vasculature, kidney, heart, lungs and CNS et al.[16]. In our study, we found that serum concentrations of Ang II and NA were elevated in HFMD cases, especially in severe cases, suggesting RAS activation. The concentration of Ang II was positively related to the concentration of NA during the progression of HFMD in both the mild and severe cases. The highest levels of Ang II and NA occurred at 3 dpi in HFMD cases. As shown in our previous study, the highest levels of some inflammatory cytokines occurred at 3 dpi in HFMD cases. In terms of above results, RAS activation may induce large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines [23]. Numerous studies on the pathogenesis of other viral diseases have also shown that pathogens can affect the stability of the RAS [24\u201327]. Thus evidence support our results, and activation of RAS may involve with the development of HFMD.",

In our study, we found that EV71 infection induced Ang II and NA expression in the brains, skeletal muscle, and lungs of EV71-infected mice. We also observed histopathological alterations in these target organs, implying RAS activation may participate in the process of EV71 infection. Furthermore, pulmonary edema was also determined in EV71-infected mice. Previous studies have indicated that serum Ang II levels in patients withH7N9 infection were higher than controls and were related to the severity of infection [24, 26]. The S protein of SARS-CoV virus can down regulate the expression of ACE2 in the lungs and cause an accumulation of Ang II and acute lung injury (ALI). After the intervention of the ACE2 protein, symptoms of ALI were alleviated [25]. Zou, Z et al. found that with H5N1 infection, the RAS was involved and final concentration of Ang II were able to be used as prognostic indicators[27].These studies suggested that with viral infection, the pathogens could damage the homeostasis of the lung RAS, alter the local blood pressure and vascular permeability, and aggravate the imbalance of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators, thus affecting the occurrence and development of lung injury. Yumiko I et al. found that an excessive expression of Ang II can enhance the permeability of the lung through AT1R, resulting in pulmonary edema[28]. Together, above evidence suggest that EV71 infection-induced pulmonary edema may be an outcome of RAS activation.",
