CSTE reports assess the spread of influenza within each state for each week based on lab-confirmed and syndromic data [10]. The influenza activity is considered local if there are influenza outbreaks or an increase in cases of influenza-like illness in a single region of the state along with recent identification of laboratory-confirmed influenza from that region. In the case of influenza outbreaks or increases in influenza-like illness with recent laboratory-confirmed influenza in at least two but fewer than half the regions of the state, the influenza activity level is considered to be regional. If the influenza outbreaks or increased numbers of influenza-like illness cases (plus laboratory-confirmed cases) are reported in at least half of the regions of the state, the influenza activity is considered to be widespread (Figure 1). We defined the pre-influenza period as the period between the start of the putative influenza season (October 1) and the beginning of local influenza activity (per CSTE reports). The pre-influenza period is characterized by the availability of the vaccine and the absence of influenza activity (Figure 1). The definition for the pre-influenza period was similar to the one used by other authors [11],[12].",

            "text": "Confounding due to differences between the vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals is a recognized issue in observational studies of influenza vaccination\u2014particularly studies evaluating vaccine effectiveness for reducing all-cause mortality in the elderly [12]. One approach to account for confounding is to choose a period when the vaccine was available but the influenza virus was not circulating as the \u201ccontrol\u201d pre-influenza period [11],[12]. In the pre-influenza period, there should be no vaccine effect, and observed effects during this period are assumed to be due to confounding. Therefore, as our primary strategy for confounder adjustment, we identified a group of covariates that would move the odds ratios (ORs) of association between maternal influenza immunization and birth outcomes during the pre-influenza period to 1.0 (i.e., no effect), hence arriving at a set of covariates that could effectively control for confounding due to the differences between the vaccinated and the unvaccinated women in analyses of all influenza activity periods. We selected covariates for the separate multivariate models for each of the birth outcomes (i.e., prematurity and SGA) using a modified version of the approach described by Jackson et al. [11] and Nelson et al. [12]. Briefly, variables for each birth outcome were evaluated for potential confounding by selecting the covariates that, in bivariate models, modified the association between maternal influenza vaccine and the birth outcome and moved the OR towards 1. From this initial group of variables, we arrived at a parsimonious model by sequentially dropping each covariate and observing a change in OR of the association between maternal immunization and the birth outcome. We excluded the variable whose removal moved the OR the most towards 1. If dropping a covariate resulted in moving ORs away from 1 and a change in magnitude of less than 1%, we removed the covariate that caused the least change and then repeated the process. If the change was more than 1%, we considered the current set of covariates as the smallest group of variables required to account for confounding.",

For births during the 8 wk of widespread influenza activity, the odds of prematurity were approximately 70% lower among the newborns of the vaccinated mothers compared to mothers who did not receive the influenza vaccine. During the period of widespread influenza activity there was also an association between maternal receipt of influenza vaccine and reduced likelihood of SGA. The magnitude of association between influenza vaccine and prematurity (as measured by the values of ORs) increased with the increase in the intensity of influenza activity and was higher for the 2004\u20132005 season than for the 2005\u20132006 season. Based on laboratory and epidemiologic criteria, the 2004\u20132005 influenza season was more intense than the 2005\u20132006 season in the US [16]. Although the SGA-related ORs were not statistically significant for influenza activity periods except for the period of widespread activity, the overall \u201cgradient\u201d of effect in the point estimates of the ORs was qualitatively similar to that of prematurity. The increase in the impact of maternal influenza vaccines on birth outcomes by influenza activity, both in terms of ORs and population prevented fractions, supports the validity of our findings.",

The most significant type of confounding in influenza studies is due to a higher likelihood of individuals with high functional capacity (i.e., healthier individuals) to get vaccinated\u2014a phenomenon often known as the \u201chealthy user effect.\u201d However, most observational studies where significant confounding has been documented were conducted in the elderly and included a relatively nonspecific end point of all-cause mortality. It is reasonable to assume that, compared to older individuals, women of reproductive age may be less likely to have significant functional limitation even in the presence of co-morbidities. Therefore, influenza vaccine studies in this age group may be less likely to suffer from bias due to the healthy user effect. Moreover, we found no statistically significant difference between the vaccinated women and the unvaccinated women in terms of gestational age at which they sought antenatal care. On the other hand, the possibility of other confounders cannot be discounted in studies involving pregnant women. In order to address confounding, we used the pre-influenza period (i.e., the season where vaccine was available but there was minimal circulation of influenza virus) as the \u201ccontrol\u201d period. The use of the pre-influenza period for selecting confounders from a broad set of covariates is an approach suggested by Nelson et al. [12] and Jackson et al. [11] that takes advantage of the seasonality of influenza circulation. The associations observed in our study were robust to adjustment for confounders identified using this approach (and the more traditional approach)\u2014supporting the validity of our findings.",

Increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1) and reduction in anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-10) have been linked to preterm labor [6],[19],[20]. IL-1 stimulates the amnion and the decidua to produce prostaglandins and can stimulate myometrial contractions [20]. Prostaglandins are known to play an important role in the initiation and progression of labor [21]. Moreover, in animal models, administration of IL-1 results in preterm birth [20]. Similarly, TNF-\u03b1 induces the amnion, the decidua, and the myometrium to produce prostaglandins, and administration of TNF-\u03b1 to pregnant animals can induce preterm labor [19],[22]. Recent studies have shown that influenza virus infection induces gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, interferon (IFN)-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b1, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) [19].",

The association is strongest for intrauterine viral infections and systemic and intrauterine bacterial infections [5],[6]. Viral infection outside the reproductive tract, including influenza infection, may also play a role in the etiology of prematurity. For example, in an analysis of 1957\u20131958 data, newborns of women who had serological evidence of \u201cAsian\u201d (pandemic) influenza during pregnancy were 50% more likely to be premature compared to newborns of uninfected women [2]. Moreover, a recent literature review found that SARS infection in the second or third trimester of pregnancy may be associated with spontaneous preterm delivery and early cesarean sections for deteriorating medical condition, although only 16 such cases were identified in the literature [23]. Moreover, in studies in China and Hungary, birth defects were associated with history of influenza [24],[25].",

Possible reasons for the effect being limited to the period of highest influenza activity include the following: (a) in a developed country setting, the effect of maternal influenza infection on fetal growth is milder than the effect on prematurity; (b) SGA represents fetal compromise resulting from infection that is insufficient to trigger early parturition, but may result in the delayed observation of growth restriction (i.e., the observation in the widespread activity period may be the cumulative effect of previous periods). Moreover, in the vaccinated group, the birth weight distribution in the pre-influenza period was different from the distribution in the period of widespread activity (see Text S1). However, the difference in mean birth weights (in the vaccinated group) between these two periods was not statistically significant (p = 0.74). Since the ostensible increase in birth weight in the widespread activity period compared to the pre-influenza period in the vaccinated group cannot easily be explained by vaccine action, this difference\u2014although non-significant\u2014may suggest confounding vis-\u00e0-vis the birth weight outcome.",

Although we assessed and adjusted for many covariates, like any observational study, there is a possibility of residual confounding and selection bias. Moreover, data on influenza infection during pregnancy were not included in the PRAMS dataset. Although the primary explanation of the effects of influenza immunization in pregnancy on birth outcomes is through prevention of infection, having influenza infection data would have provided additional support for our findings. Another issue is that the information regarding maternal influenza immunization was based on recall and could be susceptible to information bias. However, the vaccination rates in our study are similar to the rates computed by other authors for Georgia, and to the United States national level coverage estimated by the National Health Interview Survey [30],[31].",

On the other hand, since this was a population-based study with a sampling strategy aimed at producing representative estimates, the temporal distribution of influenza vaccination in pregnancy would be similar to that of the general population, hence adding to the generalizability of our findings.
