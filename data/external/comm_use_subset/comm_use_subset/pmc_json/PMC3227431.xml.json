            "text": "The human zona pellucida (hZP) is an extracellular matrix surrounding eggs, which consists of four sulfated glycoproteins designated as ZP1, ZP2, ZP3, and ZP4 [1, 2]. ZP glycoproteins mediate several critical events during fertilization process such as initial recognition and binding of the spermatozoa to the egg in a species-specific manner, induction of the acrosome reaction in the zona-bound spermatozoon, and prevention of polyspermy [3, 4]. By virtue of their critical role during fertilization, ZP glycoproteins have been proposed as target for developing contraceptive vaccines [5, 6]. Although active immunization with purified or recombinant ZP (r-ZP) proteins induces infertility in various mammalian species, the contraceptive efficacy is invariably associated with either transient alteration or complete loss of ovarian function [7\u201310]. The observed ovarian pathology following active immunization with ZP antigens may be due to (i) presence of ZP-specific T-cell epitopes (TCE) within a B-cell epitope (BCE), for example peptide corresponding to mouse ZP3 (mZP3) amino acid (aa) residues 330\u2013342 (peptide330\u2013342) [11], (ii) autoimmune ovarian disease (AOD) that can be adoptively transferred by the ZP3 peptide-activated CD4+ T-cells to na\u00efve recipients but does not occur when only antipeptide antibodies are administered [12], and (iii) the minimal and modified BCE peptide335\u2013342 of mZP3, which had no longer a ZP-specific TCE (phenylalanine, a key residue of the \u201coophoritogenic\u201d TCE, substituted by alanine), induced infertility in mice with eight different haplotypes without any AOD when it was co-linearly synthesized with a foreign \u201cpromiscuous\u201d TCE [13].",

            "text": "The above observations clearly suggest a new possible approach of developing BCE peptide-based ZP vaccines for fertility control, which should be devoid of any ZP-specific TCE. Therefore, efforts have been made by several laboratories to delineate infertility-associated BCEs of ZP proteins since a BCE on mZP3 was first identified by Dean et al. [14]. For instance, five BCE peptides45\u201364,  93\u2013110,  137\u2013150,  172\u2013190  and  334\u2013341 of hZP3 have been mapped [15\u201317] and additional two epitopes corresponding to aa residue 23\u201330 and 301\u2013320 of hZP3 have also been predicted based on the mapping results of marmoset ZP3 (mstZP3) and bonnet monkey (Macaca radiata; bmZP3) proteins [18, 19], because their aa sequences are highly conserved among mstZP3 and hZP3 as well as bmZP3 and hZP3 proteins. To eliminate potential oophoritis-inducing TCE within a mapped longer BCE peptide, the identification of minimal motif of mapped BCEs on hZP3 has been hampered due to the limitation of available mapping methods. So far, only the minimal motif of the BCE on the C-terminus of hZP3 has been identified using rabbit serum [16].",

Gels were either stained with Coomassie brilliant blue G-250 for analyzing the bands of fusion proteins or processed for Western blot by electrotransferring the proteins onto 0.2 \u03bcm nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman GmbH, Dossel, Germany) [24]. Complete transfer of proteins was ensured by staining the nitrocellulose membrane with 0.1% (w/v) Ponceau S. Nitrocellulose membrane was subsequently processed for Western blotting using rabbit antisera against r-hZP3a and r-hZP3b (1 : 300 dilution in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 1% skim milk powder) or immune sera against P1 or P2 (1 : 2000 dilution). Specific antigen-antibody reactions on the membrane were visualized by using goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Proteintech Group, Inc., Chicago, Ill, USA) at 1 : 1000 dilution. The blot was developed by using 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (DAB) (Sigma, Mo, USA) in 50 mM PBS containing 0.05% H2O2. The reaction was stopped by washing the membrane extensively with MQ water. In some cases, enhanced chemiluminescence was also performed using ECL plus Western blotting detection reagents (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions.",

These synthetic peptides elicited antibodies capable of reacting to native mstZP, bmZP, and hZP, respectively. The peptide sequence301\u2013320 is highly conserved between mstZP3 and bmZP3 sequences. The mst-serum tomstZP3301\u2013320 linked to a promiscuous helper TCE from tetanus toxoid showed up to 60% of inhibition in human sperm-zona binding in vitro [26]. Conversely, the bm-serum to bmZP3300\u2013322 conjugated to diphtheria toxoid failed to show any significant decrease in sperm-zona binding in hemizona assay [27]. The reasons for this discordance are not clear and more research is required to explain these findings. In the present study, because there is difference of one residue at the position305 of hZP3301\u2013320 (P), mstZP3301\u2013320 (A), and bmZP3301\u2013320 (S), its antigenicity and specificity was preliminarily evaluated using synthetic peptide P2 conjugated with KLH, and was compared with peptide P1. As shown in Figures 4 and 5, peptides P1 and P2 elicited high-titer antibodies reacting with native hZP and r-hZP3b peptide expressed in E. coli, but the antigenicity of the latter was significantly greater than that of the former. For the antigenic diversity of peptides P1 and P2, one possible explanation might be because there were antibodies against two overlapping BCEs (NSNWF306\u2013310 and EGP313\u2013315) within the peptide P2 sequence. As for the efficacy of each antiserum to inhibit human sperm-zona binding, it remains to be further evaluated by carrying out competitive hemizona or sperm-egg binding assays.",

For instances the following hold. (1) Only 3 BCEs on hZP3, not including a BCE on its C-terminus transmembrane- like domain, were mapped with serum to CHO-expressed r-hZP322\u2013460 [17] compared with the result of mapped 6 BCEs in this study. (2) It could not be defined how many BCEs there were in six of potential reactive neighboring 15mer-peptides (P5\u2013P8, P11-P12, P14\u2013P18, P31\u2013P33, P38-P39, and P43-P44) in the epitope mapping of brushtail possum (bp) ZP240\u2013634 with sera to r-bpZP240\u2013311/305\u2013634 [32], which might be one of causes why several BCE peptides could be missed or could not be defined in above two epitope mapping studies using synthetic peptide library. As we know, there may be only one BCE on mapped two neighboring overlapping peptides because they share a common sequence [33], but there may also be two or three BCEs according to our other epitope mapping results of E6, E7, and L1 proteins from HPV type 58 virus (data not shown). It obviously is a drawback to employ this method to map all BCEs on a protein, because it could not be used to carry out minimal motif identification of each reactive neighboring peptide with serum to r-protein, which is a way of answering how many BCEs there are on them.",

However, not like the above studies using mAb, chicken sera to SARS-CoV, and SARS convalescent sera, it needs to solve a key problem to employ serum against r-protein, that is, how to avoid interfering of antibodies against some strong antigens from E. coli on distinguishing target blotted bands. Because any r-protein used as immunogen always contains a little bacteria proteins that could not be completely removed when purified at laboratory level. At present, this problem has been solved through using a truncated GST188 or Stv108 as carrier of short peptide expression. As showed in Figure 1, the blotted bands of the GST188-short peptides were to be located in a weak antigenic area of bacterial proteins on blotted membrane, which avoided two blotted bands of bacterial protein with 21 kDa and 31 kDa bands. Obviously, besides simple, cheap, reliable, and adaptable merits mentioned in our previous work [20], the present study showed another two distinct advantages of our improved biosynthetic peptide strategy: (1) it permits using serum against bacteria-expressed protein to map BCEs and their minimal motifs on the target protein; (2) the 8mer\u201320mer peptide fusion proteins expressed by pXXGST-1 or pXXStv-3 plasmid could be used in Western blotting without purifying. In addition, the smallest binding motif of 3 residues for antibodies can be defined with biosynthetic peptides (Figure 2(e) and Figure 3), whereas the length mapped with synthetic peptides method was 4-5 residues [37].",
