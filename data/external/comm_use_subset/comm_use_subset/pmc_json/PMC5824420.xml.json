Vaccines are currently available to control infections in humans. However, mutations in the haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins of circulating viruses easily escape the surveillance by the host immune system 4. Specific antiviral drugs are available for prophylaxis and therapeutic treatment for individuals infected with IAV. Two classes of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\u2010approved anti\u2010influenza drugs are currently used in the treatment of IAV infections including NA inhibitors such as oseltamivir and zanamivir 5, and matrix protein 2 (M2) ion channel inhibitors such as amantadine and rimantadine 6, 7. However, resistance development is a serious problem for antiviral drugs, particularly when the target viral proteins continuously undergo a high frequency of antigenic drift 8, 9, 10. Most human influenza viruses, including pandemic 2009 H1N1 and H7N9, are currently resistant to amantadine/rimantadine or oseltamivir 11, 12, 13, 14. Therefore, identification of novel antiviral targets and development of antiviral drugs for the treatment of influenza virus infections are imperative.",

Influenza NP is the major component of the viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complex and abundantly expressed during infection with multiple functions 20. The vRNP complex utilizes the nuclear localization signals (NLSs) within NP for nuclear import through the cellular importin\u2010\u03b1/\u03b2\u2010dependent nuclear import pathway 21, which is also supported by our previous report 22. During the late stage of infection, NP, nuclear export protein (NEP) and matrix protein (M1) mediate the transport of the newly assembled vRNP complexes from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. 21. Overall, NP has several conformations and activities that are conserved among all influenza A viruses and has no cellular equivalent 15. Thus, NP is an ideal target for the development of commercial anti\u2010influenza drugs.",

Briefly, a chemical library of 20,000 structurally diverse small molecule compounds (50 \u03bcM) was applied in our screening after MDCK cells infected with A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) virus (multiplicity of infection [MOI] = 0.005 PFU). We then performed a dose\u2013response assay among the hit compounds and identified seven compounds that exerted an inhibitory effect by more than 50% at a concentration of 10 \u03bcM. Among the anti\u2010influenza hits, compound ZBMD\u20101 showed the highest potency against influenza A virus in a plaque reduction assay (PRA) on MDCK cells infected with A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) virus. The chemical structure of compound ZBMD\u20101 was shown in Figure 1A. Using a plaque assay, the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of ZBMD\u20101 against A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) in MDCK cells was lower than 2 \u03bcM (Fig. 1B). ZBMD\u20101 showed a similar level of antiviral activity against different IAV subtypes including A/Guangdong/1/2009 (H1N1) virus (IC50 = 1.14 \u00b1 0.21 \u03bcM) and A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2) virus (IC50 = 0.41 \u00b1 0.09 \u03bcM) (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, ZBMD\u20101 had low toxicity in MDCK, A549 and 293T cells. The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) of the compound was >100 \u03bcM (Fig. 1B).

For unbiased predictive docking analysis, we searched for potential docking sites within the entire NP monomer. Five potential binding sites were identified (Fig. 5A). Based on the highest binding free energy, binding site 1 of ZBMD\u20101 within NP was selected for further analysis. The configuration with the best binding score (\u0394G of \u221248.37 kcal/mol) was also identified and used in further studies (Fig. 5B). Two amino acid residues (F338 and R267, hydrogen bond) play a major role in ZBMD\u20101 binding to NP (Fig. 5B). To further confirm the accuracy of this binding model, a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiment was utilized to examine whether ZBMD\u20101 binds to wild\u2010type and mutant NP proteins harbouring alanine substitutions within potential binding sites (from R267 to 267A and F338 to 338A mutant). The SPR assay indicated that ZBMD\u20101 dose\u2010dependently bound to the wild\u2010type NP\u2010His or mutant NP\u2010His with Kd values of 10.6 or 131.6 \u03bcmol/l, respectively (Fig. 5C and D). Although ZBMD\u20101 remained bind to His\u2010tagged mutant NP protein, its binding affinity was significantly lower than that to wild\u2010type NP protein, thereby indicating that these two residues play critical roles in the interaction between ZBMD\u20101 and NP. These results suggest that ZBMD\u20101 binds to NP mainly through amino acid residues, R267 and F338, which were predicted by in silico docking analysis.",

The binding between NP and CRM1 was inhibited by ZBMD\u20101 in a dose\u2010dependent manner (Fig. 5E).

Co\u2010administration of ZBMD\u20101 and oseltamivir phosphate also significantly reduced the viral load in lung (Fig. 6H).

Further investigation indicated that ZBMD\u20101 blocks the nuclear transport of vRNP complex from the nucleus through targeting the nuclear export of NP. Three NESs were identified within the NP. Export via NES1 and NES2 is independent on the CRM1 transport pathway, whereas export via NES3 is dependent on CRM1 binding 40. Therefore, the nuclear retention of NP that was induced by ZBDM\u20101 may be due to the disruption of the following pathways: (i) ZBMD\u20101 targets the NES1 or NES2 within NP; (ii) ZBMD\u20101 targets the NES3 within NP that further blocks the interaction between NP and CRM1; and (iii) ZBMD\u20101 targets the CRM1 or its associated proteins. To exclude that CRM1 is the direct target of ZBMD\u20101, we utilized an AID\u2010GFP\u2010expressing plasmid in our experiments because AID is a classic host protein that is transported from the nucleus and is mainly mediated by the CRM1 pathway 21. The distribution of AID\u2010GFP was not affected by ZBMD\u20101, whereas the classical small molecule inhibitor LMB blocked the nuclear export of AID. Therefore, ZBMD\u20101 did not directly inhibit the CRM1 transport pathway as LMB did. To further explore the particular binding sites of ZBMD\u20101 within NP, docking analysis that incorporated the structure of ZBMD\u20101 within NP was performed. This result showed that the potential binding site of ZBMD\u20101 within NP is a small pocket that included NES3. In line with the binding model, further investigation proved that ZBMD\u20101 directly binds to NP and disrupts the interaction between NP and CRM1. Moreover, the docking analysis and SPR assay indicated that aa F338 of NP was another important binding site for ZBMD\u20101. In line with these results, ZBMD\u20101 inhibited the NP\u2010NP interaction, which further reduced the polymerase activity and impaired the protein synthesis of IAV. Taken together, these results strongly support our theory that NP is the target of ZBMD\u20101.",

The discovery of new target has thus been the focus on the development of new anti\u2010influenza therapeutics. Sequence analysis has indicated that NP is a well\u2010conserved protein among different strains of IAV 15. Furthermore, the target sites of ZBMD\u20101 within the NP (R267 and F338) were highly conserved (>99% conservation) 15, thereby indicating that ZBMD\u20101 has a broadly inhibitory potency against various IAV strains, including the replication of H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes and the polymerase activity of H7N9 subtype. An alternative challenge for drug design and development is to avoid the occurrence of serious side effects. Influenza NP protein plays a crucial role in the viral life cycle. The activity, assembly, stability and nuclear transport of vRNP complex all rely on the function of NP 1. Therefore, NP is a highly conserved and functionally restricted protein, thus rendering it a promising specific target for anti\u2010influenza drug design.",

Recently, a small compound, RK424, targeting a functional domain within NP has been identified 15. The pocket targeted by this compound was reported to be surrounded by three different domains, namely the RNA binding groove, the NP dimer interface and NES3. In the present study, the binding pocket of ZBMD\u20101 within NP in our study was similar to that of RK424. Based on similar function and different chemical structures, we concluded that the binding pocket of ZBMD\u20101 is an indispensable pocket of NP, which would be an ideal antiviral target sides. In our studies, ZBMD\u20101 was shown to inhibit IAV replication in vitro and in vivo efficiently. Because ZBMD\u20101 is one of the first\u2010generation hit compounds identified via high\u2010throughput screening, it could be further optimized to become more potent inhibitors.",
