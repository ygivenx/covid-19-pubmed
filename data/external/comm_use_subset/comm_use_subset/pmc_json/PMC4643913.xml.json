The close proximity of patients, visitors and healthcare workers (HCWs) to one another, virus shedding during asymptomatic periods, low vaccination compliance (by both HCWs and the general public) as well as virus persistence in respiratory secretions and fomites can all contribute to the spread of the virus and lead to nosocomial outbreaks [2, 8\u201312]. Limiting nosocomial transmissions in hospitals is particularly important as besides increasing the duration and costs of hospitalization, they can increase morbidity and mortality, particularly in high-risk elderly, infant, seriously ill, and immunocompromised patients [2, 3, 13].",

PCR-based molecular diagnostic assays are generally limited in their capacity to classify etiologic agents beyond the type/subtype level. While this is acceptable for the diagnosis of uncommon hospital acquired infections (HAIs), for more common causes of HAIs such as influenza it is desirable to apply assays that yield enough data to more accurately distinguish unique patient transmission chains. In conjunction with epidemiological data such assays could be effectively used to test whether patient infections have a nosocomial origin [6, 14\u201317].",

For rapidly evolving pathogens such as RNA viruses which accumulate high degrees of genetic diversity during the course of an epidemic, genetic data has been used to provide valuable epidemiological insights [19\u201324]. Specifically, the marriage of phylogenetics, population genetics and epidemiology within the fledgling field of phylodynamics enables the use of nucleotide sequence data and clinical history to study disease transmission dynamics. This form of molecular epidemiology has become a particularly useful adjunct to clinical histories when attempting to determine the nature and timing of infections [25\u201333].",

It is, however, assumed that vaccine compliance is low amongst South African HCWs, as is the worldwide trend, which is concerning given that increased influenza vaccine coverage amongst HCW correlates with decreased incidence of ILI in hospitalised patients [55\u201357].",

Here we assess whether an influenza sequence phylogenetic analysis could, by enriching basic epidemiological data, assist with investigating transmission chains and the frequency of nosocomial transmission within Red Cross War Memorial Childrens Hospital (RXH) in Cape Town South Africa. Over a 4-month period, influenza A positive patient samples from various wards in the hospital were obtained and partial influenza hemagglutinin sequences were generated for each patient. Possible transmission chain/channels were determined through a combination of basic patient admission data and the analysis of Maximum likelihood and time-scaled Bayesian phylogenetic trees, to identify potentially epidemiologically linked transmission chains. The inclusion of a time-scaled phylogenetic analysis allowed us to estimate times to most recent common ancestors of epidemiologically and phylogenetically linked samples with statistical support to evaluate the likelihood of phylogenetically related infections sharing a common transmission source.",

RXH is the largest tertiary paediatric hospital in South Africa and manages approximately 260 000 patient visits per year. Most of its patients are from poor communities, a third of which are less than one year old. Although > 98% of patients are referred to the hospital from the Western Cape region of South Africa, referrals from the rest of South Africa are also common as a result of the unique and high level of paediatric care available at the hospital. For the period spanning 1 April to 31 July 2011, a total of eighteen samples were obtained. Fourteen were confirmed Influenza A, pandemic H1N1 (H1N1pdm) positive RNA samples from pediatric patients admitted to RXH, which formed the focus of our study. A further four samples, served as geographic controls and were obtained from three other hospitals within the same region during the same time period; 1 from Groote Schuur Hospital (GRS), 1 from 2-Military Hospital (2MIL) and 2 from Somerset Hospital (SOM). Clinical history and hospital admission dates were abstracted from hospital records of the RXH patients from whom virus samples were obtained. This study was approved by the University of Cape Town Human Research Ethics Committee (UCT research ethics number: 305/2012). To ensure patient anonymity, study samples were unlinked by being issued with a study identification number. For the purpose of this investigation the transmission case definitions were as follows: (1) a suspected hospital-acquired influenza infection (HAI) case was defined as an influenza PCR positive individual who did not present to the hospital with respiratory symptoms or was confirmed to be influenza negative by laboratory testing within three days of admission (Fig 1); and (2) a suspected community-acquired infection (CAI) case was defined as a patient with laboratory-confirmed Influenza A (H1N1pdm) at or within three days of admission.",

Patient 3.4 (Figs 2 and 3), also a RXH patient, has a sequence closely related to the sequences in cluster 3 but because of insufficient bootstrap support (< 69%) it was not considered as part of cluster 3. All patients whose viral isolates feature in cluster 3 (bootstrap supported) were admitted to RXH within a 43 day span of one another (19 May -1 July) and were confirmed to be H1N1pdm positive by laboratory testing within 25 days of one another. Viral isolates 3.1 and 3.2 are most likely to represent locally circulating CAIs as they tested positive for influenza A within 2 days of admission. Isolate 3.3, is the only sample to conform to our chosen criteria for a HAI in this cluster, testing H1N1pdm positive at 18 days post admission. The possibility does exist that patient 3.3 acquired their infection indirectly from patient 3.2 (the two patients were not housed in the same ward). The time-scaled phylogenetic analysis (Figs 1 and 3) may support this notion as it estimated that the virus isolates in patients 3.2 and 3.3, despite varying in sequence, may have shared a hospital ancestor between 18 April and 5 June (mean = 19 May) (Figs 1 and 3), the upper limit of which coincides with the co-hospitalisation of patients 3.2 and 3.3. In spite of this, due to time constraints, it is still highly unlikely that viral transmission occurred between these patients as the time-frame is an insufficient incubation period for infection symptoms. As indicated, insufficient bootstrap ML support precluded the sequence derived from patient 3.4 from cluster 3. Time-scaled phylogenetic analysis further confirmed that it is highly unlikely that 3.3 and 3.4 shared a common hospital ancestor since the 95% credibility interval of the tMRCA excluded the admission dates of both patients.

This could incorrectly suggest transmission linkage between patients that were infected with viruses with MRCAs that excluded all possibility of a direct intra-hospital transmission chains. Incorrectly assuming transmission linkages between such patients, would lead to an underestimation of the number of times that influenza had been independently introduced into the hospital. While our sequence data suggests that there were at least four and potentially as many as ten independent H1N1pdm introductions into RXH between 26 March 2011 and 15 June 2011 due to no identifiable linkage between the HAI instances.

Our inability to establish epidemiological transmission linkage of cases/viral isolates could be attributed to limited sampling in RXH during the study period which could imply that the viruses we detected originated in either asymptomatic hospital patients, visitors, or hospital staff. Transmission from asymptomatic patients is serious in the context of South Africa\u2019s high HIV prevalence. While studies have demonstrated that HIV-infection status alone in adults does not increase risk of Influenza infection, evidence suggests that prolonged Influenza shedding periods (> 1 week) can be observed in patients exhibiting non-HIV related immunosuppression [62, 63]. Such prolonged influenza positivity was exhibited in patient 1.1 a, who remained influenza PCR positive for 15 days.

Influenza PCR-based testing was unable to determine whether they acquired the infection within this ward.

Furthermore, the identification of HAI sources may ultimately require exhaustive longitudinal sampling and screening of hospital staff, visitors and patients, including review of patient records and collection of other epidemiological data on questionnaires throughout the duration of a single influenza season. Such a large-scale study would also likely benefit from analyses of larger sequence fragments (possibly even multiple full genome sequences from individual patients at each sampling time-point), which would provide greater analytical power with respect to resolving clusters within phylogenetic trees for the identification and characterization of likely virus transmission chains within the hospital setting.",
