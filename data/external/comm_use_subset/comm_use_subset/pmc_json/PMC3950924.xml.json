            "text": "Inflammatory cytokines/chemokines produced during HTNV infection represent a double-edged sword [5]. On one hand, they contribute to viral elimination by inducing and amplifying innate effectors' functions and antigen presentation of viral epitopes to T cells. On the other hand, if not properly regulated, inflammatory cytokines/chemokines may facilitate immunopathological processes in HFRS [5]. We screened a panel of cytokines expressions using Luminex and found that, in the serum from HFRS patients, CXCL10 was the most-highly-expressed cytokine (see Table S1 in the Supplementary Material available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/697837). CXCL10/Interferon-\u03b3-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) is a member of CXC chemokines, which is mainly secreted by endothelial cells, epithelial cells, and keratinocytes. After binding to its receptor CXCR3, CXCL10 induces chemotaxis, apoptosis, cell growth inhibition, and angiostasis [6]. Accumulating data have indicated that CXCL10 plays an important role in many virus infectious diseases infected with Hepatitis Virus B (HBV) [7], Hepatitis Virus C (HCV) [8], HIV [9], influenza virus [10], and some other viruses [11\u201313]. The elevated level of CXCL10 has been found to be correlated with the development and the severity of these infectious diseases. In studies of the regulation mechanism of CXCL10 production, some signaling pathways have been documented to contribute to the regulation of CXCL10's expression, including JAK-STAT pathway [14], TRAF2/TAK1 pathway [7], and PI3K/AKT pathway [15]. Transcriptional factors like NF-\u03baB [7], IRF1 [13], and IRF3 [15, 16] have also been proved to bind to the CXCL10's promoter. Although Geimonen et al. have reported that HTNV induce CXCL10 expression in HUVECs [17], little is known about the molecular regulation mechanism of HTNV-induced CXCL10 production. A better understanding of the regulation mechanism of CXCL10 production in infectious diseases might help us develop new therapeutic interventions in human diseases.",

The serum samples and the peripheral blood samples were collected and stored as previously described [18, 19]. Based on the classically defined 5 stages of HFRS (namely, febrile stage, hypotensive stage, oliguric stage, polyuric stage, and convalescent stage), we classified the HFRS patients in this study into acute phase (including febrile, hypotensive, and oliguric stages) and convalescent phase (including diuretic and convalescent stages) [20, 21]. The plasma viral load, an important indicator of disease severity, had been determined in our lab before [18].

Though Peng-Peng Ip and Fang Liao found that CXCL10 could resist Dengue virus (DENV) infection in mice because the susceptibility of CXCL10\u2212/\u2212 mice to DENV infection was enhanced [12], many other studies reported that the high values of CXCL10 levels could be used as a biomarker of disease progression and some in vivo studies showed that elevated levels of CXCL10 contributed to the tissue damages [7, 9, 24\u201328]. The contradictory findings of CXCL10's role in either protecting or promoting infection may depend on the host immune status and genetic background [29]. In our study, we have found that the serum CXCL10 level in HFRS patients is substantially higher than its corresponding level in healthy donors (Figure 1(a)) and the content of CXCL10 in the acute phase of HFRS is 3 times higher than that in the convalescent phase (Figure 1(b)). Importantly, the elevation of CXCL10 level is correlated significantly with the HFRS severity-indicating clinical parameters (Figures 1(c) and 1(d)). The higher CXCL10 level in the higher viral load group (>1500 copies/mL) is good proof that the production of CXCL10 is correlated with the replication of the HTNV (Figure 1(d)).",

But, the mechanism for the induction of CXCL10 during HTNV infection is still unknown. In our study, the results of the transfection of poly (I:C) suggest that the CXCL10 could be induced by dsRNA, which may be the replicative intermediate generated during HTNV replication (Figure 3). As indicated in Figure 3(a), mock viruses, which lose their ability in replication, fail to activate the expression of CXCL10. The transfection of R848 also demonstrates that it is dsRNA, rather than ssRNA, that induces the CXCL10's production. dsRNA sensors (TLR3, RIG-I, and MDA-5) are activated after HTNV infection and therefore may contribute to the CXCL10's generation, while TLR7 and TLR8, as ssRNA sensors, are not activated (Figures 3(a)\u20133(c)). Sundstrom et al. reported that, during HTNV infection, IRF3 and IRF7, rather than IRF-1 or p65, were the main downstream transcription factors regulating the cytokines' production [31] but they did not explain the direct correlations between these transcription factors and CXCL10's production during HTNV infection. Our results of ChIP and EMSA demonstrate that IRF7 and NF-\u03baB1 are activated after HTNV infection and they bind directly to the CXCL10's promoter in HUVEC (Figure 5). The understanding of the regulations of cytokines/chemokines and their receptors during HTNV infection might provide a novel therapeutic target in HFRS. In our study, we have found that the contents of CXCL10 (10 kDa) in HFRS patients' serum drop to the normal level after the hemodialysis treatment (data not shown). Current treatment of HFRS is often limited to the administration of Ribavirin and primary supports [21, 32]. The patients suffering from a severe or critical HFRS have to be treated by hemodialysis [5] to remove the low molecular weight proteins, such as cytokines and chemokines [33]. But hemodialysis has some serious side effects, such as bleeding, hypotension, infection, and anemia. A combination of antiviral and anti-cytokines/chemokines therapies may be a better therapeutic approach to hantavirus infections [34].",

The disagreement may be due to the different cell lines used in respective studies.

However, mock HTNV infection and R848 treatment for 48 h failed to raise the expression of CXCL10. (b) Real-time PCR screened out that TLR3, RIG-I, and MDA-5 upregulated after HTNV infection for 48 h.
