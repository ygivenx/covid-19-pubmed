Following the outbreak, calls for pandemic-threat warning systems came from both traditional public health policy-makers1,2 and national governments.3 As currently conceptualized, the first step in the identification of a pandemic threat requires an outbreak of sufficient size to come to the attention of medical personnel who are sufficiently influential and persistent to ensure action.4 Once an outbreak is verified, well-established protocols for disease investigation and control can be swiftly put in place \u2013 although it may be many months before the main risk factors and most effective control measures are identified. The Ebola outbreak in western Africa probably began in December 20135 but it took another year before traditional burial practices were found to be a leading cause of the rapid spread of the causative virus.6",

Behavioural assessment was key to the identification of injecting drug users as a high-risk group for HIV infection in the early 1980s.8 It was also crucial in documenting the risks posed by HIV to women.9 Subsequently, an innovative, practical method, which combines biological outcome data with behavioural risk factor data \u2013 i.e. exposure variables \u2013 was developed to document HIV transmission dynamics. Such integrated biological\u2013behavioural surveillance has since become well established and standardized and been frequently implemented globally.10,11 It has contributed extensively to a biologically-based and quantifiable understanding of the behavioural risk factors associated with the acquisition and transmission of HIV12 and the early identification of subgroups of the population that may be more vulnerable to HIV infection.9 More recently, data from integrated surveillance have been used to evaluate the impact of evidence-based interventions to prevent HIV infection and to monitor treatment uptake.13 Similar surveillance could help identify behavioural risk factors and high-risk subgroups for zoonotic infections such as Ebola \u2013 potentially before diseases of pandemic potential are identified in clinical settings or major outbreaks occur in communities.",

Behavioural risk factors, i.e. exposure variables, simply represent the population prevalence of behaviours that may or may not increase the risk of disease. Without the outcome variables, the exposure variables are of little use in elucidating the mechanisms of the spillover of zoonotic disease to humans or of subsequent human-to-human transmission. Effective surveillance requires questions that assess a range of animal exposures, document experiences of unusual illness and measure contextual factors that can lead to an increase or decrease in the probabilities of behavioural risk factors and disease.",

The spillover of zoonotic viruses from wildlife, the source of most emerging zoonoses,15 has been difficult to document. Behavioural risk may be either direct or indirect. Direct contact with primate blood or bodily fluids has been associated with several zoonotic viruses found in humans, such as human T-lymphocyte virus,24 simian foamy virus25,26 and, possibly, Ebola.5 Indirect contact was responsible for the transmission of Nipah virus to humans, which was mediated through date-palm sap contaminated with the urine of infected bats,27 and hantavirus transmission is most frequently associated with inhalation of aerosolized virus from the excreta of infected rodents.28 Both general exposure to animals, e.g. when buying live animals at market, and more intimate exposure, e.g. during the slaughter of animals or as the result of animal bites, must therefore be assessed.",

Exposure to dense or diverse rodent populations in urban or rural environments35,36 and the displacement of wildlife populations as land is cleared for crops are some mechanisms.36 Understanding the context within which spillover to humans can occur is an important component in the prevention of zoonotic outbreaks. The same behavioural risk factors may be risky in one context but not in another. For instance, the sharing of a water source with animals displaced by a change in land use may only have an adverse effect on human health if there is faecal\u2013oral transmission of the zoonotic pathogen to humans. If such transmission requires contact with the animal blood, then the sharing of the water source should not increase the risks of either spillover or transmission. Once human-to-human transmission of a zoonotic pathogen occurs, additional risks come into play, often as a consequence of the human infection, and these should also be measured pre-emptively. Burial practices and health-care-seeking practices were associated with explosive increases in, respectively, the incidence of human infection with Ebola virus in western Africa6 and MERS in the Republic of Korea.37",

The ideal source of biological outcome data, i.e. data that provide the strongest evidence of zoonotic disease spillover, would be community-based screening for acute infection with zoonotic viruses. However, as such infection is rare under non-outbreak conditions, many thousands of individuals would usually have to be screened for a meaningful analysis of the behavioural risk factors. Serological assays, in which previous exposure to a virus is demonstrated by a positive result, can provide alternative biological outcome data. Since many more individuals may have been exposed to a virus than are currently ill with the virus, serology can provide the larger number of individuals, with known viral exposure, required for powerful analyses of behavioural risk factors. We therefore investigated the results of serosurveys for their potential usefulness in the prediction of future outbreaks. We focused on studies conducted in communities under non-outbreak settings in Africa. We collated results presented in peer-reviewed publications \u2013 in English, French or Spanish \u2013 that we identified via Google Scholar and Web of Science searches that ended on 31 December 2015 (available from the corresponding author). We used \u201cAfrica\u201d, \u201cantibody\u201d, \u201cserology\u201d, \u201cserosurvey\u201d, \u201czoonoses\u201d and \u201czoonotic disease\u201d as search terms.

High seroprevalences, i.e. seroprevalences of at least 1%, represented the results for all eight of the high-risk subgroups with evidence of previous exposure to a zoonotic pathogen, 12 (75%) of the medium-risk subgroups with such evidence and three (48%) of the low-risk subgroups with such evidence (available from the corresponding author).

If we are to mitigate the risk of a zoonotic disease outbreak, we need a better understanding of the mechanisms behind the spillover of zoonotic disease into human populations. By making such mechanisms the focus of integrated surveillance, we should be able to: (i) monitor the presence and prevalence of behavioural risk factors and the seroprevalence of specific zoonotic pathogens within particular population subgroups; (ii) deploy targeted control and mitigation strategies rapidly; and (iii) evaluate the efficacy of prevention policies and interventions.",

To be effective as a prevention tool, integrated biological\u2013behavioural surveillance should be implemented as a baseline measure \u2013 to identify behavioural risk factors, determine the prevalence of those risk factors, especially in any population subgroups that are considered at higher risk of zoonotic spillover, and establish seroprevalence. Should an outbreak occur, a database that documents local behaviours and practices, as well as the context within which such behaviours occur, can contribute to the development of appropriate and feasible strategies for disease control and mitigation. Finally, data from integrated surveillance will be invaluable in both informing realistic and effective interventions and policies for the prevention of zoonotic spillover and transmission, and evaluating the impact of such interventions and policies efficiently.",

Rather, it can serve to complement virus detection efforts, by potentially identifying pandemic threats before the need for large-scale clinical intervention. As current behaviours may not reflect the behaviours that originally exposed the individuals who are found seropositive to the virus of interest, both current and lifetime behaviours need to be investigated. This is the strategy that has proved successful in identifying subtle exposure risks in the field of HIV, such as backloading of syringes with drug solution by injecting drug users.55 In identifying specific behavioural risk factors, integrated biological\u2013behavioural surveillance will be most effective when the reported syndromic symptoms are recent, e.g. occurring in the previous 12 months, and their probable association with a zoonotic virus can be confirmed by a positive serological test result.",
