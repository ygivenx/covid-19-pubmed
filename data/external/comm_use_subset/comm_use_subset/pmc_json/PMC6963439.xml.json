            "text": "Toxin A and toxin B are major virulence determinants of this bacterium. Immunity to these two toxins provides protection by inhibiting the action of the toxins, which can effectively prevent serious illness caused by CDI [6,12]. Toxin A is an enterotoxin and cytotoxin with very high toxicity; toxin B is a potent cytotoxin with a toxicity 100\u20131000 times as high as that of toxin A [13,14]. In vaccine development, we search for vaccine candidates with high immunogenicity but low toxicity, so we needed to make changes to the toxins for the development of the new vaccine type. Both toxin A and toxin B are single-chain polypeptides consisting of a highly conserved N-terminal catalytic domain that can modify GTPases, a translocation domain, an autoproteolytic domain, and a receptor-binding domain (RBD) [15,16]. The three-dimensional structures of the glucosyltransferase domain and portions of the RBD have been well defined. The only known native receptor of toxin A is the \u03b1Gal(1,3)\u03b2Gal(1,4)\u03b2Glcgly can sequence, which is not found on human intestinal epithelial cells [16,17]. Human receptors of toxin B have been identified [18,19,20]. Crystal structures of toxin fragments indicate that the toxin A RBD possesses seven carbohydrate binding sites [21], and toxin B is predicted to have four sites [16]. Binding to receptors by RBDs is essential for the toxicity of C. difficile toxins A and B; inhibiting the binding can protect a host from illness caused by the toxins. Usually, the RBDs are known to be nontoxic and immunogenic, and RBDs were used in vaccine candidates against, among others, SARS Coronavirus [22] and C. botulinum [23]. In our study, we constructed recombinant proteins containing the full-length RBD from toxin A or toxin B (named RBD-TcdA and RBD-TcdB, respectively) of reference strain VPI10463 (ribotype RT087). We immunized mice with the recombinant RBD-TcdA and/or RBD-TcdB to test their immunogenicity and protective effect against toxins extracted from the wild-type strain American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) BAA-1870, which belongs to ribotype 027 (RT027).",

Toxins were filtration-sterilized through 0.22 \u03bcm (pore size) membranes and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Toxin A and toxin B were purified using DEAE SepharoseFF, and their molecular weights were measured using the native-PAGE method. Toxicity was determined by using Vero cells and mice. In brief, Vero cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 1.0 \u00d7 105 cells per well. Incubation of Vero cells with crude toxins resulted in a loss of cell adherence and a change in cell morphology, which was observed under microscope to calculate the dose that causes 50% of the Vero cells to round (ED50).",

Therefore, in our study, we tested the humoral immune responses through evaluating toxin-specific antibody titers. To evaluate humoral toxin-specific immune responses elicited by RBD-TcdA and RBD-TcdB, mice were vaccinated twice intramuscularly with 1 \u03bcg RBD-TcdA, RBD-TcdB, or RBD-TcdA/B. On the indicated days, serum samples were collected and evaluated by ELISA. The data indicate that all immunized mice displayed potent levels of RBD-specific serum IgG (Figure 3A,B). As expected, animals immunized with PBS displayed no antigen-specific responses (data not shown). The anti-RBD-TcdA and anti-RBD-TcdB antibody titers can be detected on day 7, and then increased quickly and maintained a high-level titer for a few days (Figure 3A,B). When we increased the immunization dose to 10 \u00b5g of RBD-TcdA, RBD-TcdB, or RBD-TcdA/B, we did not measure higher titers of IgG in comparison with groups immunized with lower doses (Figure 3C,D). The presence of antibody subtypes (IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, and IgG3) specific to vaccine candidates was determined by indirect ELISA. We found significant increases in absorbance for antigen-specific IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b (Figure 3E,F), but not IgG3, in the sera of immunized mice in comparison with controls. Next, we evaluated the neutralizing antibody levels. Sera from immunized mice neutralized a certain dose of crude toxins in our in vitro neutralization assay. The titers of neutralizing antibody induced by the RBD-TcdA/B vaccine were much higher than those of the two univalent vaccines (Table 1).",

However, the RBDs amino acid sequences of toxins A and B of the ATCC BAA-1870 strain show 96.2% and 88.4% similarity with those of the reference strain VPI10463, respectively (Figure S1). To study the protective effect of the recombinant proteins, C57BL/6 mice were immunized with 1 \u00b5g RBD-TcdA, RBD-TcdB, or RBD-TcdA/B and, after two immunizations, inoculated with crude toxins of ATCC BAA-1870. The results show that RBD-TcdA, RBD-TcdB, and RBD-TcdA/B can protect mice against 1 MLD of toxin or prolong their life (Figure 4A). When we increased the immunization dose to 10 \u00b5g, these three vaccines still protected mice against 1 MLD of crude toxins or prolonged their life (Figure 4B). There is no big difference between the effects of the two immunization doses when mice were challenged with 1 MLD. When mice were challenged with a dose of 2 MLD crude toxins, 80% of the mice immunized with RBD-TcdA/B survived. Of the mice immunized with RBD-TcdA, 50% survived, and in the RBD-TcdB-vaccinated group and the control group, there were no survivors. When mice were challenged with a dose of 3 MLD crude toxins, 60% of the mice immunized with 10 \u00b5g RBD-TcdA/B survived; only the group receiving 10 \u03bcg RBD-TcdA/B had survivors. (Table 2) ",

Usually, the treatment of CDI is costly, and the recurrence rate is very high [5,7]. In recent years, FMT has been a promising method for CDI treatment [24]. There are limited data on FMT for treatment of primary CDI, but FMT appears safe and effective for recurrent CDI [24]. Disease prevention is still an important approach that deserves exploration [25,26]. As mentioned before, toxin A and toxin B are major virulence determinants of C. difficile. Binding to receptors by RBDs is essential for the toxicity, and blocking the binding sites can protect hosts from illness caused by toxins [2,14]. Immunization with recombinant RBDs represents a promising method in vaccine development [22,23]. A number of studies have demonstrated that antibodies induced by RBD-based vaccines can efficiently block the toxicity of bacterial or viral replication in tissue [27]. Several C. difficile vaccine candidates exist worldwide [27,28,29]. One vaccine for C. difficile was developed by Sanofi Pasteur [30]. They developed a bivalent candidate vaccine, a formalin-inactivated, highly purified preparation of toxins. Although a significant immune response is evoked, it remains quite difficult to develop this kind of vaccine, especially because it is difficult to obtain a highly pure natural toxin. Novavax developed a chimeric toxin receptor-binding domains vaccine, which induced protection against CDI [31]. The linker in chimeric vaccine may alter the structure of protein. Sometimes, simple design is more useful for vaccine development. An optimized, synthetic DNA vaccine encoding the toxin A and toxin B receptor-binding domains of C. difficile induced protective antibody [31], but DNA vaccine is not the best optimum prophylaxis for an extracellular bacterium infection. One nontoxigenic C. difficile strain expressing mTcd138 provided mice full protection against infection with a hypervirulent C. difficile strain, UK6 (ribotype 027) [32]. It is a promising oral vaccine candidate against CD. As mentioned in this paper, they still need a long time to evaluate whether NTCD/NTCD_mTcd138 survived in animals after antibiotic treatment. Another strategy is developing a novel chimeric toxin vaccine, which retains major neutralizing epitopes from both toxins and confers complete protection [32].

To investigate which subtype is predominant in mice immunized with vaccine candidates, the IgG subtypes were assayed by ELISA. We found a significant increase in absorbance for antigen-specific IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b but not IgG3. The ratio of IgG2a/IgG1 in all vaccine groups suggested that our vaccines elicited a Th2-type immune response. The principal role of the toxin-neutralizing circulating antibody in immunity against C. difficile has also been clearly demonstrated in animal models [27,35,36]. In this study, we identified and characterized efficacious toxin RBD-neutralizing antibodies against crude toxins. Sera from immunized mice neutralized a certain dose of crude toxins in an in vitro neutralization assay. The neutralizing antibody titer induced by the RBD-TcdA/B vaccine was much higher than those induced by the two univalent vaccines.",

Delivery of crude toxins intraperitoneally is lethal in mice. However, systemic toxin is not indicative of a normal infection scenario [37]. Entry of the toxin into circulation is thought to be a possible cause [38]. Therefore, challenging immunized mice with intraperitoneal toxin represents a stringent method for this research. However, we will try to make spores of bacterium to establish the animal CDI model, which can develop a wide range of disease symptoms in the near future. In order to evaluate the protection conferred by the vaccine candidate, the immunized mice were challenged with natural crude toxins extracted from the RT027 strain ATCC BAA-1870 [36]. Among the three vaccine candidates, the RBD-TcdA/B vaccine elicited the strongest humoral immune response and provided the greatest protection against toxins of C. difficile. The most important reason for this observation must be that the RBD-TcdA/B vaccine can induce the production of more types and higher levels of RBD-specific antibodies, which can block two toxin RBDs to inhibit the action of the toxins. Moreover, toxins can be used as adjuvant in several research models [39,40]. In our study, we found that the anti-toxin A, but not anti-toxin B, neutralizing antibody titer induced by the RBD-TcdA/B vaccine was much higher than that induced by the single one. Toxin B is a potent cytotoxin with toxicity 100\u20131000 times as high as that of toxin A. Thus, we presume that RBD-TcdB functions as an adjuvant here. In this case, the RBD-TcdA/B vaccine can activate a broader spectrum of B-cell clones than the univalent vaccine, causing a difference in the protection level they offer against toxins. The protective data we got from the animal experiments will aid us further in the development of a safe and effective vaccine for human beings. C57BL/6 mice were also immunized with different doses to evaluate the relationship between the immunizing dose and the conferred protection. The results show that there is no statistically significant difference between the immunization effects of the two doses after mice were challenged with 1 MLD crude toxin. We need more work to address it and find the mechanism.",
