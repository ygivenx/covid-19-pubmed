The M protein of FCoVs is the most abundant structural protein [25]. The presence of a premature stop codon in a constitutive gene such as the M gene is incompatible with the functionality of the virion. However, this defective virus is no less important than the others, as it provides genetic background for recombination with other FCoVs, resulting in greater genetic diversity and possibly increased virulence of some viral quasispecies. Recent studies suggest that the 3c gene, which encodes a small protein (238aa) of unknown function, is associated with most FIPV isolates when present in truncated form, although not all FCoV strains in FIP+ samples present this 3c form [13, 14, 20]. In the present study, the 3c truncated protein was observed in all clones obtained from tissue samples from FIP+ cats, with the exception of those obtained from the cat USP16, where only 11% (1/9) of the clones demonstrated the truncated protein.",
