Nevertheless, further health education through local media may help raise awareness about the value of influenza vaccination prior to departure for Hajj, especially among older age groups at high risk of influenza complications.15 An evaluation of the MOHP's current risk communication campaigns to increase influenza vaccination use among pilgrims may help identify strategies to improve influenza vaccine coverage.",
