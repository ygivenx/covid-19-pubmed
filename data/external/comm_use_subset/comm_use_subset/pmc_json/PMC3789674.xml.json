            "text": "Coronaviruses cause respiratory, enteric, renal and/or neurological disease in humans, many other mammals and birds. In 2002-03 a previously unknown coronavirus emerged from a wild animal reservoir to cause the SARS pandemic, with about 8,000 human cases and more than 770 deaths [1,2]. Previously, cross-species transmission from coronaviruses of bat and bovine origin had allowed human respiratory coronaviruses OC43, NL63 and 229E to become established in the human population worldwide [3\u20138]. In the Arabian Peninsula in 2012, another novel human CoV, now called Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was isolated in Vero E6 cells from sputum from a fatal case of severe respiratory disease with kidney failure. Since then, MERS-CoV RNA has been detected by RT-PCR in over 70 patients with severe to moderate respiratory disease, 39 of whom have died [9,10]. Genome sequence analysis showed that MERS-CoV is a novel betacoronavirus in genogroup c, closely related to two prototype group c betacoronaviruses of Asian bats, BtCoV-HKU4 from a Tylonycteris pachypus bat and BtCoV-HKU5 from a Pipistrellus abramus bat [11], and to partial sequences of a group c betacoronavirus from a Pipistrellus pipistrellus bat in the Netherlands [12]. Recently group c betacoronaviruses were also detected in a Nyctinomops laticaudatus bat in Mexico [13], and Nycyteris cf. gambiensis bats in Ghana [14]. MERS-CoV, like SARS-CoV, is probably a zoonotic betacoronavirus that has spilled over into humans, directly or indirectly, from one of the species of bats that harbor group c betacoronaviruses or from other unknown animal reservoirs [13,15,16].",

            "text": "The ~200 kDa spike glycoprotein (S) of coronaviruses is an important determinant of virus virulence, tissue tropism and host range. Trimers of S form the characteristic large spikes on the coronavirus envelope that bind to receptors, mediate membrane fusion, virus entry and syncytia formation, and elicit virus neutralizing antibodies. Coronavirus S proteins are Class I viral fusion proteins like the HIV envelope (env), influenza hemagglutinin (HA) and paramyxovirus fusion (F) glycoproteins [17], which typically require protease cleavage between the S1 and S2 domains (Figure 1A) to permit conformational changes in S2, activated by receptor binding and/or low pH, that mediate membrane fusion leading to virus entry and syncytia formation [3,17,18]. In different cell types and tissues, coronavirus S proteins may be cleaved by a variety of host proteases including furin, trypsin, human airway trypsin-like protease (HAT), transmembrane protease serine protease-2 (TMPRSS-2), TMPRSS-4, or cathepsins [18\u201322]. Functional analysis of MERS-CoV S glycoprotein is needed to identify susceptible cell types and host species that affect viral tissue tropism and host range, and to determine how various host proteases promote MERS-CoV virus entry and syncytia formation.",

            "text": "Identification of the receptor or receptors is an important first step in understanding the host range and tissue tropism of coronaviruses. Four receptor proteins for spike proteins of different coronaviruses are now known: murine carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecule 1a (mCEACAM1a) for mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) [23], a betacoronavirus in group a; aminopeptidase N (APN) for human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and several other alphacoronaviruses [24,25]; and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for both SARS-CoV, a betacoronavirus in group b and HCoV-NL63, an alphacoronavirus [26,27]. Raj and co-workers [28] recently demonstrated that MERS-CoV uses dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) as a receptor. In contrast, S proteins of several group a betacoronaviruses including bovine coronavirus and hCoV-OC43 use sialic acid moieties as receptors [29,58]. We have used lentivirus pseudotypes with MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein to identify cells susceptible to infection with MERS-CoV and to study the role of MERS S protein in virus entry and syncytia formation.",

            "text": "Expression of coronavirus S proteins on 293T cell membranes for incorporation into lentivirus pseudovirions can be enhanced by using codon-optimized spike cDNA and deleting an ER/Golgi retention motif and an endosomal recycling motif from the cytoplasmic tail of S [30\u201332]. Codon-optimized cDNA encoding S of MERS-CoV (derived from GenBank: AFS88936) [15], with the 16 C-terminal amino acids replaced by a linker, GGGGS, and a FLAG tag (here called MERS-CoV S\u039416) (Figure 1A) was expressed on 293T cell membranes and incorporated into envelopes of lentivirus pseudovirions. Immunoblotting of SDS-PAGE gels of the cell lysate (Figure 1B, lane 3) with anti-FLAG revealed two bands of MERS-CoV S\u039416 at about 200 kDa which probably reflect changes in glycosylation of S\u039416 during transport through the Golgi. Only the upper S band was incorporated into MERS pseudovirions (Figure 1B, lane 2). No protease cleavage products of the ~200kDa S protein were detected in transfected 293T cells or pseudovirions (Figure 1B). In marked contrast, the MERS lentivirus pseudovirions used to identify cells susceptible to entry of MERS-CoV in the Poehlmann laboratory [33], contained a high proportion of cleaved MERS-CoV S protein at about 100 kDa. This important difference in the MERS pseudovirions is likely due to differences between our 293T cells and those used in the Poehlmann laboratory. Surprisingly, when these MERS pseudovirions and cell lysates were blotted with polyclonal goat antibody AO4 to spikes purified from detergent-disrupted virions of MHV-A59, a betacoronavirus in group a, the MERS S protein bands were detected (Figure 1B). Immunoblotting of soluble, truncated MERS S proteins with C-terminal FLAG tags showed that the AO4 antibody did not recognize the S1 domain of MERS S (Figure 1C), so the cross-reactivity between these proteins from betacoronavirus groups a and c must lie within the S2 domain.",

Cell entry was quantitated by expression of the luciferase reporter gene in pseudovirus-transduced cells. Compared to control pseudovirions with no spike protein, MERS pseudovirions showed a 100 to 1,000 fold increase in luciferase activity in Vero E6 and LLCMK2 cells (Figure 2A and B), and SARS pseudovirions showed a 1,000 increase in luciferase activity in Vero E6 cells. Because the uncleaved MERS-CoV S protein mediated virus entry into Vero E6 and LLCMK2 cells, transduction by MERS pseudovirions was used to identify additional cell lines that express functional receptors for MERS-CoV [10,34]. MERS pseudovirions detected strong MERS-CoV receptor activity on the Calu3 line of human airway epithelial cells (Figure 2A and B), and weaker receptor activity on the A549 line of human alveolar basal epithelial cells (Figure 2A) as also shown by MERS-CoV infection [35]. Interestingly, the EFF embryo cell line from Eptesicus fuscus bats was susceptible to MERS pseudovirions, increasing luciferase activity by nearly 100-fold compared to the no spike control, but the TB1Lu lung cell line from Tadarida brasiliensis bats, murine fibroblasts and HeLa cells were not susceptible to MERS pseudovirions (Figure 2C). Expression of human ACE2 in 293T cells did not significantly increase susceptibility to MERS pseudovirions (Figure 3A), although as expected hACE2 greatly increased susceptibility of 293T cells to SARS pseudovirions (Figure 3A). Figure 3B and C show that neither human CEACAM1, or four related human CEACAM proteins or human APN functions as a receptor for MERS-CoV spike protein. These experiments confirm the observation that MERS-CoV does not use the receptor proteins known for other coronaviruses [33] or related human membrane proteins. Instead DPP4 is the principal receptor protein for MERS-CoV [28]. MERS pseudovirions induced a small but consistent 5 to 10-fold increase in luciferase activity in 293T human embryo kidney cells compared to the no spike control virus (Figure 2C), suggesting that our 293T cells expressed either a low level of DPP4, or an alternative but less efficient receptor, such as CD209L or LSECtin for SARS-CoV [36,37].",

In Vero E6 cells, 20mM NH4Cl inhibited entry of SARS pseudovirions by about 99.9% compared to entry of SARS pseudovirions without inhibitor, and NH4Cl also inhibited entry of MERS pseudovirions by about 99.6% (Figure 3A). Bafilomycin A specifically inhibits the vacuolar-type H+-ATPase that is required for acidification of lysosomes. Figure 3A shows that bafilomycin A inhibited entry of SARS pseudovirions into Vero E6 cells by 99.8% as previously reported [21,38], and also inhibited entry of MERS pseudovirions by more than 99.9% compared to MERS pseudovirions without inhibitor. In LLCMK2 cells, although bafilomycin A inhibited 99.7% of MERS-CoV S mediated entry, NH4Cl reduced MERS-CoV S-mediated entry only 6-fold (data not shown), suggesting that the inhibition of endosomal acidification by NH4Cl may be cell type dependent. These experiments show that MERS pseudovirions with uncleaved S protein can enter monkey kidney cells only by endocytosis.",

Cathepsin activity is essential for infection by several viruses that enter by the endosomal route, including reovirus [39], SARS-CoV [22], and Ebolavirus [40]. E64D, an inhibitor of the cysteine protease activities of cathepsins B, H, and L and calpain, reduced transduction of Vero E6 cells by SARS pseudovirions by 80% as previously reported (Figure 3B) [41]. Since cell entry mediated by VSV-g glycoprotein does not require protease activation [17], E64D treatment of Vero E6 (Figure 3B) and LLCMK2 cells (data not shown) did not inhibit entry of VSV pseudovirions. However, E64D decreased entry into Vero E6 cells of MERS pseudovirions with uncleaved S by 96.7% (Figure 3B) and LLCMK2 cells by 99.2% (data not shown). Thus, cleavage of MERS-CoV S protein by one of the cathepsins or calpain was required for triggering S-mediated membrane fusion and virus entry at low pH in endosomes. As previously reported [41], in Vero E6 cells 10 \u00b5M of cathepsin L inhibitor III, a specific and irreversible inhibitor of cathepsin L, significantly inhibited entry mediated by SARS S protein, but did not inhibit VSV-g-mediated entry (Figure 3B). Cathepsin L inhibitor III reduced entry into Vero E6 cells of MERS pseudovirions with uncleaved S protein by 97% relative to entry without inhibitor (Figure 3B), and similar results were seen in LLCMK2 cells (data not shown). Thus, MERS-CoV S protein on pseudovirions must be cleaved in endosomes by the acid-activated cysteine protease activity of cathepsin L to trigger receptor-dependent entry into Vero E6 and LLCMK2 cells.",

Trypsin treatment at either 4\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C cleaved the S protein of MERS pseudovirions and generated a ~65kDa subunit in the S2 domain of the protein recognized by antibody to MHV-A59 S protein (Figure S1). MERS pseudovirions with uncleaved S protein were adsorbed at 4\u00b0C to cell surface receptors on Vero E6 cells in the presence of 20mM NH4Cl, and then the cells with bound virions were briefly treated with trypsin at pH 7.4 at room temperature to cleave the ~200 kDa S protein and activate its membrane fusing activity. Figures 3A and 4A show that NH4Cl strongly inhibited infection of Vero E6 cells by MERS pseudovirions with uncleaved S. However, trypsin treatment of the MERS pseudovirions bound at neutral pH and 4\u00b0C to the Vero E6 cell membrane triggered both virus entry at the plasma membrane and formation of small syncytia by 40 hours post inoculation (Figure 4A and B). Thus, receptor binding together with protease cleavage and activation of S at neutral pH was sufficient to trigger entry of MERS pseudovirions and syncytia formation. In this experiment membrane fusion did not depend upon synthesis of S protein, but syncytia formation was mediated by the cleaved S protein on pseudovirions adsorbed to virus receptor on the cell membrane. Although acidic pH is required to activate the cathepsin L activity that allows MERS pseudovirions to enter at endosomes, low pH is not required for the conformational changes in trypsin-cleaved MERS-CoV S protein that mediate entry at the plasma membrane.",

Large syncytia were also formed after even a brief 20 minute trypsin pre-treatment at pH 7.4 and 4\u00b0C of 293T cells expressing MERS-CoV S protein, followed by incubation with a 5-fold excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor before layering the cells over confluent monolayers of Vero E6 cells and incubating at 37\u00b0C for 20 hours (Figure 4C, lower central panel, arrows).

We therefore transfected 293T cells with plasmids encoding TMPRSS-2 or -4, MERS-CoV S\u039416 protein, psPAX2 and pLenti-GFP-Luc and investigated whether S proteins on pseudovirions produced in these cells were cleaved and whether they could infect Vero E6 cells in the presence of NH4Cl. Surprisingly, the pseudovirion-producing 293T cells expressing either TMPRSS-2 or -4, formed large syncytia by 40 hrs after transfection (Figure 5A), but the MERS pseudovirions produced by these cells could not transduce Vero E6 cells in the presence or absence of NH4Cl (Figure 5B). In contrast, without TMPRSS-2 or -4, the 293T cells expressing uncleaved MERS-CoV S\u039416 did not form syncytia, and pseudovirions that they produced efficiently infected Vero E6 cells, but virus entry was inhibited by NH4Cl (Figure 5B). Immunoblots with antibody AO4 to MHV S or anti-FLAG (data not shown) revealed that the MERS pseudovirions produced in 293T cells expressing TMPRSS-2 or -4 contained little or no immunoreactive S protein or fragments of S.",

Others have also recently demonstrated that human respiratory tract cells, and also primary human bronchus and alveolar cells are susceptible to MERS-CoV in accord with the severe respiratory disease in MERS patients [10,33,35,46]. Muller et al. [34] recently reported that MERS-CoV can infect cells from four genera of Old World bats, Rousettus, Rhinolophus, Pipistrellus, and Myotis, and one New World genus, Carollia. We found that MERS pseudovirions could also infect cells from one New World bat, E. fuscus, but not from another, T. brasiliensis. The ability of MERS-CoV to infect cells from multiple mammalian species directly and without adaptation [47], including a diverse array of both Old World and New World bats, suggests that the receptor for MERS-CoV, DPP4 [28], is broadly conserved among many species, an important property of many emerging viruses [47,48]. E. fuscus bats, commonly known as big brown bats, are the bats most commonly encountered by humans in North America, and they are a reservoir for an alphacoronavirus [49,50]. It will be important to learn whether these New World bats are susceptible to MERS-CoV or related group c betacoronaviruses. The recent detection in N. laticaudatus bats in Mexico of a group c betacoronavirus with 96% similarity to MERS-CoV [13], coupled with the diverse array of alphacoronaviruses previously discovered in North American bats [49\u201352], justify increased surveillance to identify additional species of New World bats that may also harbor group c betacoronaviruses like MERS-CoV or other coronaviruses with the potential to cause severe disease in humans.",

These observations that the S protein of MERS-CoV, a group c betacoronavirus, contains cross-reacting epitope(s) with S proteins of both some group b (SARS-CoV) and group a (MHV) betacoronaviruses, indicate that serological studies may not accurately distinguish between different phylogenetic groups of betacoronaviruses.

The classes of viral fusion proteins are determined based on their structures and conformational changes during membrane fusion. Most class I viral fusion proteins require proteolytic cleavage upstream of the hydrophobic fusion peptide in the viral spike protein to enable these conformational changes to occur, as well as subsequent steps that trigger membrane fusion including either binding to receptor like HIV gp120, low pH in endosomes like influenza HA, or both like avian sarcoma leukosis virus (ASLV) [9,17,54\u201356]. Coronaviruses in different phylogenetic groups differ in the sequence of steps leading to virus entry [57,58]. The S protein on virions of group a betacoronavirus MHV-A59 requires protease activation--either by furin during virus maturation [18], by trypsin or other serine proteases in extracellular fluids before either receptor binding, or by cathepsin in endosomes at acidic pH\u2014to trigger the conformational changes that lead to membrane fusion and virus entry [59]. In contrast, virions of group b betacoronavirus SARS-CoV that contain uncleaved S [22], first bind to the viral receptor protein, ACE2, and are endocytosed, and then S is cleaved within endosomal vesicles by acid-dependent cathepsin L enabling the conformational changes in S that lead to virus entry [21,22,60].",

The MERS pseudovirions bound to receptors on susceptible cells and were endocytized, and within the endosomes cleavage of S by the acid-dependent cysteine protease cathepsin L mediated virus entry. Gierer et al [33] reached similar conclusions using MERS pseudovirions that, unlike ours, contained more cleaved than uncleaved S protein, although both labs had made the pseudovirions in 293T cells. Gierer et al. [33] showed that batches of 293T cells differ markedly in expression of the MERS-CoV receptor and susceptibility to transduction by MERS pseudovirions.

Upon warming to 37\u00b0C at neutral pH, the MERS pseudovirions fused with the plasma membrane and transduced the cells. Thus, MERS S protein does not require acidification to mediate virus entry, and the acidification required for endosomal entry [33] was required to activate the protease activity of cathepsin. Although treatment of coronavirus virions or pseudovirions with proteases can activate virus entry, it may also make them lose infectivity if the cleaved S1/S2 heterodimer dissociates before receptor binding. We found that MERS pseudovirions released from cells expressing TMPRSS-2 contained reduced amounts of S protein and had lost the ability to transduce susceptible cells. We postulate that the MERS pseudovirions that contain large amounts of cleaved S protein, detected by a c-terminal tag [33,53], could not enter cells at the plasma membrane because S1 may have dissociated from the cleaved spikes on virions. Development of antibodies specific for the S1 domain of MERS S protein are needed to test this hypothesis.",

MERS-CoV infection of Calu-3 and Caco-2 cell lines induced syncytia formation [35]. Our 293T cells were only minimally susceptible to entry of MERS-pseudovirions, and did not form syncytia when producing MERS pseudovirions with uncleaved S. However, when 293T cells expressing MERS-CoV S\u039416 protein were co-cultured in the presence of trypsin with Vero E6 cells that express the MERS-CoV receptor, enormous syncytia formed. These observations suggest that in tissues such as the lung, where trypsin, TMPRSS-2 or -4 and HAT and other serine proteases are available, MERS-CoV virus infection might spread directly from cell to cell by S-mediated, receptor-dependent syncytia formation, potentially escaping from virus-neutralizing antibodies, as do other syncytia-forming viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses, and measles. It will be important to learn whether syncytia are formed in lungs or other tissues of MERS-CoV patients or animal models of MERS-CoV.",

When S proteins expressed on the plasma membrane are cleaved, the S1 domain can detach from the spike, exposing the hydrophobic fusion peptide of the membrane-anchored S2 domain that can directly induce fusion with any nearby cell membranes or lipid bilayers even if they lack receptors. This \u201creceptor-independent spread (RIS)\u201d allows an infected cell to fuse with adjacent non-infected, receptor-negative cells that can, in turn, produce virus and fuse with additional receptor-negative cells. RIS activity depends on the stability of S1/S2 interactions, and low stability of S1/S2 heterodimers correlates with rapid spread of infection through tissues that express little receptor protein [63,64]. We found that transmembrane serine proteases TMPRSS-2 and -4 could activate the syncytia forming activity of MERS-CoV S\u039416 protein expressed in 293T cells as these proteases do for Class 1 fusion proteins of other respiratory viruses including influenza, SARS-CoV and human metapneumovirus [19,20,42\u201345]. We were surprised that 293T cells, which express very little MERS-CoV receptor, were so extensively fused, and we hypothesize that this syncytia formation may be due to RIS.",

            "text": "Due to its high case fatality rate, therapeutic interventions for MERS-CoV are urgently needed. Pooled purified human immunoglobulin containing neutralizing antibody has been used to treat a variety of infectious diseases. Not surprisingly, since MERS-CoV is an emerging pathogen, we found that human immunoglobulin from the USA could not neutralize the infectivity of MERS pseudovirions (data not shown). However, sera from patients infected with either SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV contain antibodies that can neutralize MERS-CoV [33,53]. Most neutralizing antibodies would likely target the receptor-binding S1 domain of MERS-CoV S, which is less conserved than the S2 domain and can mutate, likely generating antibody escape mutants [65]. Here we showed that a polyclonal antibody to the S protein of MHV, a group a betacoronavirus, cross reacts with the S2 domain of MERS S protein in immunoblots. As we and others have proposed for SARS-CoVs [66,67], the more highly conserved S2 domain, and especially its C-terminal heptad repeat (HRC) region, can be important targets for blocking conformational changes in S, inhibiting syncytia formation and virus entry, and also eliciting neutralizing antibodies. If MERS-CoV virions made in the lung have uncleaved S protein and must therefore enter cells through endocytosis, then inhibitory HRC peptides, or neutralizing antibodies to HRC might not penetrate into the endosomes to prevent virus entry. However, MERS-CoV virions in the lung likely have cleaved S protein due to lung proteases, so that virus entry at the plasma membrane might be inhibited by HRC-targeted peptides or antibodies.",
