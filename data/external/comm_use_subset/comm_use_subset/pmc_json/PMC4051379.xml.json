            "text": "In September 2012, a new highly pathogenic human coronavirus (CoV)1, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), has emerged in Jeddah and Saudi Arabia and quickly spread to some European countries [1-3]. The virus causes symptoms similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), yet involving an additional component of acute renal failure [4]. Until 15 May 2014, it has infected at least 572 people with a fatality rate of about 30% globally (World Health Organization, global alert and response, http://www.who.int/csr/don/2014_05_15_mers/en/). Recently, human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV has been confirmed; albeit, a serological study of major livestock suggested dromedary camels also to be a possible host [5,6]. Nevertheless, these findings indicate that the virus have the opportunity to spread globally and pose a significant threat to world health and the economy. Therefore, studies to understand the virus and to develop antiviral drugs or therapy are necessary and urgent.",

            "text": "Like other CoVs, the MERS-CoV nonstructural polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) are cleaved by two types of viral cysteine proteases, a main protease (EC 3.4.22.69) and a papain-like protease (PLpro) (EC 3.4.22.46) [7]. This processing is considered to be a suitable antiviral target because it is required for viral maturation. Unfortunately, initial screening of the existing SARS-CoV PLpro inhibitor, a benzodioxolane derivative against MERS-CoV PLpro, revealed no significant inhibition [7]. The difference represents the requirement of further understanding the MERS-CoV PLpro. In addition to proteolytic activity, similar to those of SARS-CoV, NL63-CoV and murine hepatitis virus, MERS-CoV PLpro acts on both deubiquitination and ISG15-linked ISGylation [8-11]. As a viral deubiquitinating protease (DUB), MERS-CoV PLpro is able to deubiquitinate interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), which can prevent its nuclear translocation and suppress production of interferon \u03b2 [10]. These studies support the multifunctional nature of coronaviral PLpro. Recently, with the crystal structure of SARS-CoV PLpro C112S mutant in complex with ubiquitin (Ub), we have demonstrated that Ub core (residue 1\u201372) makes mostly hydrophilic interactions with PLpro, while the Leu-Arg-Gly-Gly C-terminus of Ub is located in the catalytic cleft of PLpro, mimicking the P4-P1 residues [12]. This bound pattern is similar to that of the ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs), one of the five distinct DUB families [13,14].",

Like other PLpro, there is a catalytic triad consisting of the residues Cys1592, His1759 and Asp1774. Homology modeling suggests that MERS-CoV PLpro, similar to other known PLpro, may have a right-hand-like architecture constituted by palm, thumb, and fingers domains, although their sequence identity are only about 30% [12]. Furthermore, MERS-CoV PLpro is able to recognize and cleave at the LXGG consensus cleavage site, which is essential for most CoV PLpro-mediated processing [10]. Despite this large body of knowledge on MERS-CoV PLpro, in the absence of detailed structural and functional characterization, the molecular basis for its catalytic mechanism remains poorly unknown.",

Specifically, the enhanced fluorescence emission upon substrate cleavage was monitored at excitation and emission wavelengths of 329 and 520 nm, respectively, in a PerkinElmer LS 50B luminescence spectrometer. Fluorescence intensity was converted to the amount of hydrolyzed substrate using a standard curve drawn from the fluorescence measurements of well-defined concentrations of Dabcyl\u2013FRLKGG and APIKGV\u2013Edans peptides in a 1:1 ratio. This will also correct for the inner filter effect of the substrate. For the kinetic analysis, the reaction mixture contained 4\u201350 \u03bcM peptide substrate in 50 mM phosphate pH 6.5 in a total volume of 1 mL. After the addition of the enzyme to the reaction mixture, the increase in fluorescence was continuously monitored at 30\u00b0C. The increase in fluorescence was linear for at least 3 min, and thus the slope of the line represented the initial velocity (v). The steady-state kinetic parameters of the enzyme were determined by fitting the Michaelis\u2013Menten equation (eq. 1) to the initial velocity data",

The measurement indicated that the fluorescent intensity of native PLpro (Figure 3, close circles) shows a 70% increase, as compared with that of the denatured form in urea (Figure 3, open circles). On the other hand, the fluorescence emission spectrum of the native MERS-CoV PLpro shows a maximum at 336 nm, while that of the unfolded one shifts to 340 nm. The tendency is similar to that of SARS-CoV PLpro [19] and suggests a folded structure. Next, we also performed AUC experiments to characterize the quaternary structure of MERS-CoV PLpro. Figure 4A shows a typical absorbance trace at 280 nm of the PLpro during the experiment. After fitting the signals to a continuous size-distribution model, it was clear that the PLpro was monomeric with a sedimentation coefficient of 2.8 S and molar mass of 35.5 kDa (Figure 4B and Figure 4C), consistent with that for SARS-CoV PLpro [12,19]. All of these biophysical observation confirmed that the PLpro of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV should have a very similar structure; albeit they only show 30% sequence identity and 50% similarity [12]. Recent studies hypothesized that the homology model of MERS-CoV PLpro, like other coronaviral PLpro, is a right-hand-like architecture consisting of palm, thumb and fingers domains [10,25].",

            "text": "Besides the structural similarity, previous studies have suggested that MERS-CoV PLpro is also a multifunctional enzyme with protease, deubiquitinating and interferon antagonist activities [10]. MERS-CoV PLpro has a catalytic triad which is able to recognize and cleave at LXGG consensus cleavage sites; however, the detail enzyme kinetic mechanism is not known. Here we used the peptidyl substrate, Dabcyl\u2013FRLKGGAPIKGV\u2013Edans, to measure the proteolytic activity of MERS-CoV PLpro (Figure 5A and Table 2). Interestingly, compared with that of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV PLpro is less active, with a 22-fold loss in kcat/Km, as a result of a 27.5-fold loss in kcat and 1.3-fold loss in Km. According to the sequence alignment and homology modeling, most important residues for the catalysis, including the catalytic triad, Cys110-His277-Asp292 and the residues for substrate P4-P1 binding, Asp164, Pro249, and Gly276 (Asp165, Pro249, and Gly272 in SARS-CoV PLpro) are highly conserved (Figure 6) [10,12]. Previous studies have confirmed that Y265F mutant of SARS-CoV PLpro still maintained comparable proteolytic activity with the wild-type [12]. It indicates that the equivalent residue in MERS-CoV PLpro, Phe268, is able to make a hydrophobic contact with the substrate P4 residue (Ub-Leu73). Furthermore, although different to the residue Tyr269 of SARS-CoV PLpro, the equivalent residue Glu272 of MERS-CoV PLpro, whose carboxyl group can point toward outside the hydrophobic pocket, may not interfere the binding of substrate P4 residue (Figure 6). By contrast, as a putative oxyanion bound residue (Tyr107 in SARS-CoV PLpro) [15], the equivalent residue Leu105 of MERS-CoV PLpro cannot provide any hydrogen bonding interaction with oxyanion (Figure 6). It will disfavor the formation of tetrahedral intermediate. Otherwise, different to the Leu163 of SARS-CoV PLpro, the distinct circular structure of the equivalent residue Pro162 of MERS-CoV PLpro may be too short to hover above the active site for substrate binding and serve to enhance the nucleophilicity of the catalytic triad residue, Cys110 (Figure 6). These two point mutations in MERS-CoV PLpro may significantly lower the catalytic efficiency.",

The results conform to our prediction. However, in contrast, the P162L mutant has a 67-fold loss in kcat/Km, as a result of a 40-fold loss in kcat and 1.6-fold increase in Km (Figure 5A and Table 2). It suggests the requirement of the Proline residue in this site, although the reason is still not known. Nevertheless, the significant activity recovery by L105W mutation confirms the essential role of this residue on coronaviral PLpro catalysis. Theoretically, PLpro with lower proteolytic activity may result in late maturation of viral nsp1, nsp2, and nsp3 proteins; nonetheless, its influence on MERS-CoV remains unknown.",

Interestingly, in contrast with its rather low proteolytic activity, MERS-CoV PLpro shows comparable DUB activity to SARS-CoV PLpro (Table 2 and Figure 5B). It suggests that the two PLpro may show similar binding ability to the Ub core domain (residue 1\u201372). However, it is inconsistent with our previous observation on the structure of SARS-CoV PLpro in complex with Ub [12]. As mimicking the equivalent residue of MERS-CoV PLpro, the arginine mutation of a key residue for Ub core domain binding, Glu168, can result in unstable binding of SARS-CoV PLpro and Ub and significant loss of DUB activity [12]. To verify this inconsistency, a structure of MERS-CoV PLpro in complex with Ub is quite necessary.",

Remove of zinc from SARS-CoV PLpro will cause the tertiary structure more unstable and lead to less active [19]. Based on sequence alignment, MERS-CoV PLpro also has four cysteine residues (Cys190, Cys193, Cys225 and Cys227) on the corresponding position. Here the DUB activity of MERS-CoV PLpro in various EDTA was examined to delineate the possible metal ion effect. The activity was 79% in 10 mM, and 72% left in 50 mM EDTA (Figure 5B). These results suggest the existence of endogenous metal ion, which is beneficial for its DUB activity. By the way, it has been clarified that exogenous zinc ion can efficiently inhibit SARS-CoV PLpro with the IC50 value of 1.3 \u03bcM [24,29]. Here we also confirmed the potent inhibitory effect of zinc ion on MERS-CoV PLpro (Figure 5B); whereas the mechanism of this inhibition by zinc is not yet understood.",

The secondary, tertiary and quaternary structural studies concluded that MERS-CoV PLpro has a similar scaffold to other coronaviral PLpro, as a right-hand-like architecture consisting of palm, thumb and fingers domains. The result of functional assay indicated that MERS-CoV PLpro exhibits potent DUB activity but rather low proteolytic activity. A natural mutation, Leu105, is the major reason for this difference. The present study not only demonstrates the structural and functional characterization of MERS-CoV PLpro, but provides a foundation for further understanding the coronaviral PLpro family, which is an ideal antiviral target. Next, with pure protein and effective proteolytic activity assay, potent inhibitors of MERS-CoV PLpro can be high throughput screened and identified.",
