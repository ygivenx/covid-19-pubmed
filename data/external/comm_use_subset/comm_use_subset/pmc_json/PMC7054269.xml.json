Conversely, phylogenetic analysis revealed distinct sequence clusters containing several very closely related genomes, indicating that these viruses might originate from the same outbreak in the Chinese population (Fig. 3A,D). To exclude contamination, all metagenomic hits to influenza B viruses and HMPV were confirmed by PCR. Interestingly, the MeV sequence in patient 8 exhibited a very close phylogenetic relationship to a Chinese vaccine strain (Shanghai-191, 99.97% nucleotide identity) (Fig. 3F): this suggests a vaccine origin, although one that has clearly replicated to high levels in this patient (702 RPM) (Fig. 2). In contrast, the echovirus 6 virus discovered here (EchoE6/22/ZJ/CHN/2018), was relatively distant to known viruses (<89.78% nt identity), such that it likely represents a new variant of this virus (Fig. 3G).

            "text": "A notable result was the marked difference between the pathogens detected by meta-transcriptomics and those determined by more routine laboratory diagnostics. As might be expected given the focus on RNA26, meta-transcriptomics generated a much larger diversity of viruses, especially those with RNA genomes. In addition, the assays for RNA viruses are costly and time-consuming for most hospital laboratories, and there are insufficient diagnostical tests to cover the entire diversity of respiratory viruses. Conversely, more bacteria were discovered using traditional culture methods, which is also likely true of shotgun DNA sequencing-based metagenomics32. This suggests that RNA-based meta-transcriptomics can be subject to false-negative results in some instances. This likely occurs because metagenomic bacterial identification was based on non-rRNA genes whose RNA expression level is often relatively low25. However, because they may be indicative of more elevated replication, those bacteria identified by meta-transcriptomics are perhaps more likely relevant to disease manifestation.",
