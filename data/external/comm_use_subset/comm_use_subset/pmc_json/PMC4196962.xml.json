            "text": "The blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) is a tight seal composed of capillary endothelial cells, pericytes, and perivascular astrocytes [1]. The BBB contributes to homeostasis in the central nervous system (CNS) by limiting the entry of plasma components, erythrocytes, and immune cells from the circulating blood [2]. Astrocytes play a pivotal role in maintenance of BBB integrity via contact-dependent mechanisms and release of trophic factors [3]\u2013[5]. In addition, a recent study revealed that Sonic hedgehog (SHH) released from astrocytes promotes BBB formation and integrity by upregulating tight junction (TJ) proteins in capillary endothelial cells [6]. Without SHH, its receptor Patched-1 (Ptch-1) suppresses a G-coupled\u2013protein receptor Smoothened (Smo) which is critical for the activation of a transcription factor Gli-1 [7]. Gli-1 is an important regulator of TJ protein expression and BBB formation. SHH binds and inactivates Ptch-1, which allows Smo to activate Gli-1, which upregulates TJ proteins and enhances BBB integrity. Disruption of BBB integrity is frequently observed in neurologic diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson\u2019s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, suggesting that infiltrating molecules and immune cells from the blood perturb CNS homeostasis and exacerbate these disorders [8]\u2013[13]. Microglial activation is another characteristic pathologic feature in these diseases [14]. Activated microglia release various cytotoxic factors such as nucleic acids, glutamate, reactive oxygen species (ROS), proteases, and pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines [15]. Interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) is a major microglial pro-inflammatory cytokine that acts on both endothelial cells and astrocytes to increase BBB permeability [16]\u2013[18]. However, the mechanisms of BBB disruption by IL-1\u03b2 have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we demonstrated that IL-1\u03b2 suppressed SHH expression in astrocytes and increased BBB permeability by downregulating TJ proteins in endothelial cells. Moreover, IL-1\u03b2 stimulated astrocytes to secrete pro-inflammatory chemokines such as CCL2, CCL20, and CXCL2, which induce the migration of immune cells such as neutrophils, monocytes, macrophage, dendritic cells, and pathogenic T cells. Our findings reveal novel mechanisms of BBB disruption by IL-1\u03b2, and suggest that SHH could be used therapeutically against various neurologic diseases.",

Confluent monolayers of MBEC4 cells on Transwell inserts (3 \u00b5m pore size; BD Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) were incubated for 24 h with 2 ng/ml IL-1\u03b2, ACM, IL-1\u03b2-treated ACM, 1\u2013100 ng/ml recombinant mouse SHH (R&D systems), 0.01\u20131 \u00b5M purmorphamine (a Smo agonist) (Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), or 0.3\u201330 \u00b5M cyclopamine (a Smo inhibitor) (Merck Millipore).

IL-1\u03b2 binds to its receptor, IL-1R, whose downstream signaling activates nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB), a key player in the immune and inflammatory response in astrocytes [27], [28]. NF-\u03baB promotes transcription of mediators of inflammation, such as pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines [29]. In addition, NF-\u03baB also increases neurotrophic factor production in astrocytes [30], [31]. Therefore, IL-1\u03b2 plays two opposing roles in astrocytes. Microglia are the main source of IL-1\u03b2 in the CNS. A variety of stimuli, such as damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs), amyloid \u03b2, and pro-inflammatory cytokines, trigger microglial IL-1\u03b2 production via an inflammasome-dependent mechanism [32], [33]. Upregulation of IL-1\u03b2 is observed in a broad spectrum of neurological diseases, including infections, trauma, stroke, and epilepsy, as well as chronic neurologic diseases such as MS, Parkinson\u2019s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer\u2019s disease [32]; BBB disruption is associated with progression of these diseases [34]. IL-1\u03b2 increases BBB permeability by downregulating TJ proteins [17], [18]. In addition, IL-1\u03b2 also induces astrocytes to release vascular endothelial growth factor, which increases BBB permeability [16]. Thus, IL-1\u03b2 induces BBB breakdown via both direct and indirect pathways.",

SHH is a critical activator of Smo\u2013Gli-1 signaling which upregulates TJ proteins and enhances BBB integrity (Fig. 6A). A decrease in SHH allows Ptch-1 to suppress Smo\u2013Gli-1 signaling. In the healthy state, astrocytes release SHH, which upregulates TJ proteins in endothelial cells and maintains BBB integrity (Fig. 6B, left). Once pathogenic stimuli activate microglia to release IL-1\u03b2 (Fig. 6B, right), it suppresses SHH production in astrocytes, downregulates TJ proteins in endothelial cells, and disrupts BBB integrity. Moreover, IL-1\u03b2\u2013stimulated astrocytes secrete the pro-inflammatory chemokines CXCL2, CCL2, and CCL20, which induce migration of immune cells such as neutrophils, monocytes, macrophage, dendritic cells, and pathogenic T cells.

In fact, both glucocorticoids and interferon \u03b2, both of which have been widely used for MS treatment, decrease BBB permeability [38], [39]. Moreover, the efficacy of the \u03b14-integrin antagonist natalizumab has also demonstrated the utility of BBB-targeting drugs in treating MS [40]. By contrast, excessive immunosuppression resulting from conventional therapies for MS sometimes causes progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy [41]. Thus, from the perspective of adverse effects, restoration of TJ proteins represents a superior therapeutic approach. Inhibition of IL-1\u03b2 is a promising potential method for restoring BBB integrity [42]; however, a previous study indicated that simple blockade of IL-1\u03b2 runs the risk of increasing BBB disruption, because this cytokine also enhances the protective effects of astrocytes on the BBB [26]. Treatment with SHH may circumvent this dilemma, allowing reinforcement of BBB integrity without loss of the beneficial effects of IL-1\u03b2.",

Dysregulation of SHH occurs in a variety of neurologic disorders; therefore, activation of the SHH signaling pathway, which would enhance neurogenesis and gliogenesis, has been proposed as a potential therapeutic approach for treatment of these diseases [45]. Downregulation of SHH has been observed in MS brains [46], and interferon-\u03b2 treatment improves symptoms in a MS rodent model, concomitant with reduced BBB breakdown and elevated SHH expression [47]. Taken together, these observations suggest that SHH exerts a synergistic therapeutic effect by promoting CNS tissue repair while reinforcing the BBB.",

IL-1\u03b2 suppresses astrocytic SHH production, leading to downregulation of tight junction proteins in endothelial cells and disintegrity of the BBB.
