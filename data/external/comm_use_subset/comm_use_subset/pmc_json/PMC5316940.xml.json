The titers of the rabies pseudovirus detected at different cell numbers were compared using one-way ANOVA and showed significant difference (n = 6, p < 0.001). Furthermore, when paired comparisons (student\u2019s t test) were performed, no significant difference (p > 0.05) was observed between 40,000/well and 30,000/well, while the difference between 40,000/well and 50,000/well was also found to be insignificant. It is of note that the linear correlation coefficients (R) obtained at cell inoculum from 10,000 to 50,000/well were found to be greater than 0.99, revealing an excellent linear curve fitting. Moreover, when neutralization assays were performed with different cell numbers, the values of 50% maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were similar to those with cell inocula ranging from 10,000 to 80,000/well (Fig. 1C). However, when the input cells numbers were more than 50,000/well or less than 30,000/well, the variation of the IC50 values would increase dramatically.

The Chinese national reference sample (37.0 IU/ml) and an internal control sample (designated as sample A, 7.1\u201312.9 IU/ml) for RFFIT assay were employed for viral dose optimization. As expected, the absolute IC50 values decreased gradually with the increasing amounts of the viral inocula (Fig. 2A,B and C). Furthermore, when the value of sample A was assigned against the reference sample, the titers fell within the acceptable range with virus inocula ranging from 800 to 12800 TCID50/well. It is noted that lower viral inocula resulted in larger variability and less curve fitting (smaller R2 values). Specifically, although the titer of sample A also met the acceptable criteria with lower viral inoculum (200 TCID50/well), there is a trend of increasing variability if the viral inocula were less than 400 TCID50/well (Fig. 2A and B), as further supported by decreasing R2 values. Therefore, we chose the viral inocula at 1600 TCID50/well as the optimal dose.",

The versatility of pseudovirus is achieved by pseudotyping the virus with different outer membrane proteins or envelope proteins, enabling them to infect a variety of cell types. Pseudovirus is much safer because the virus is essentially devoid of virulent viral components and involves in a single round of replication. Yet, the biggest drawback of pseudovirus system is that the harvested viruses are often of very low titers, substantially limiting their applications, particularly for in vivo studies. We resolved this issue by systematically analyzed the type of promoter, various combinations of rabies-G protein expressing plasmid and the core plasmid expressing the luciferase in addition to optimization of all critical steps in high-yield pseudovirus production.",

Given that spleen and liver are the major organs clearing particles in blood circulation, the biodistribution pattern of the rabies pseudovirus administered intravenously is expectedly to be different from that of the wt virus model in which the virus is given intramuscularly32; in the latter case, the rabies virus reaches the CNS by retrograde transport route, followed by spreading centrifugally along the autonomic and sensory nerves to the peripheral organs32. In our pseudovirus model, the bioluminescence was found in brain by 72 hours, a time at which the signal density began to decline in spleen and liver, suggesting that the pseudovirus maintains neurotropic property. Nevertheless, as the spleen is known to be the biggest reservoir for monocytes that outnumbered those in circulation and both human and mouse monocytes are susceptible to rabies viral infection33, this could also explain the strong luminescence signal in the spleen. As expected, after we intracerebrally injected the animals with pseudovirus, the bioluminescent signal was initially found to be mainly localized in the brain, followed by re-distribution into the spleen and liver, which is a biodistribution pattern similar to that of the live wt virus given intracerebrally (data not shown). Therefore, the difference in viral biodistribution is largely due to route of administration. Despite of the different viral distribution223435, data generated with the PBNA in vivo assays demonstrated strong statistical correlation with those obtained with the live wt virus-based assay.",

Briefly, mammalian cells were cotransfected with rabies G protein expression plasmids and the HIV backbone vector using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. Forty-eight hours post transfection, pseudovirus-containing culture supernatants were harvested, filtered (0.45-\u03bcm pore size) and stored at \u221270 \u00b0C or lower in 1-ml aliquots until use. 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) of each rabies pseudovirus batch was determined using a single-use aliquot from the pseudovirus bank; all stock was used only once to avoid inconsistence which could have resulted from repeated freezing-thawing cycle. Serial 5- fold dilutions (9 dilutions in total) were made in hexaplicate wells of 96-well culture plates with a 50-fold initial dilution. The last column was designated as the negative control without pseudovirus. Trypsin-treated mammalian cells adjusted to a concentration mixed with DEAE-dextran were seeded to each well. After 48 h incubation in a 5%CO2 environment at 37 \u00b0C, culture medium was aspirated gently to leave 100 \u03bcl in each well; subsequently,100 \u03bcl of Bright-Glo luciferase reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) was added to each well. Following 2 min incubation at room temperature, 150\u03bcl of lysate was transferred to solid black 96-well plates for luminescence detection using Glomax 96 microplate luminometer (Promega, Fitchburg, WI). The TCID50 was calculated using the Reed-Muench method41.",

In brief, pseudovirus was incubated with serial dilutions of test samples (8 dilutions in a 3-fold step-wise manner) in duplicate for 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C, together with virus control and cell control wells in hexaplicate. After that, freshly trypsinized cells were added to each well. Following 48 hours of incubation in a 5%CO2 environment at 37 \u00b0C, the luminescence was measured as described in the Section for pseudovirus titration. The IC50 values were calculated with non-linear regression, i.e., log (inhibitor) vs. response (four parameter), using GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). The neutralizing antibody titer was calculated by comparing with the national anti-rabies standard (37.0 IU/ml). Samples with neutralizing antibody titer equal or more than 0.5 IU/ml was defined as adequate for protection against rabies43; they were therefore determined as positive.",
