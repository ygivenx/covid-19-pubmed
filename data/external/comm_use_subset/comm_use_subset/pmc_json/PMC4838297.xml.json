G6PD involves the oxidation of glucose-6-phosphate to 6-phosphogluconolactone, which then produces a reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) to fulfill the cellular needs for cellular reductive biosynthesis and redox balance [2]. G6PD deficiency affects cellular functions in nucleated cells, including dysregulated cellular signaling, increased cell senescence or apoptosis and enhanced susceptibility to viral infection [1]. G6PD deficiency increases the risk for degenerative diseases [3\u20136]. Knockdown of G6PD by RNA interference renders HepG2 cells highly susceptible to H2O2-induced cell death because of impaired dephosphorylation signaling [7]. In macrophages, G6PD increases the activation of the p38 MAPK (Mitogen-activated protein kinases) and NF-\u03baB (Nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells) pathways, which may lead to an increased inflammatory response [8]. These findings indicate that the G6PD plays an important role in modulating cellular signaling and physiological responses.",

Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) is a pleiotropic cytokine that plays an important role in orchestrating the immune response.

NADPH oxidases (NOXs) are a ROS (Reactive oxygen species) source in cells besides mitochondria [14\u201316]. NOXs are a family of proteins, including NOX1, NOX2, NOX3, NOX4, NOX5, Duox1 and Duox2, and play a major role in regulating cellular functions, especially membrane-bound NOX in different cell types [17, 18]. NOX uses NADPH as a substrate to produce ROS that can induce cell signaling or directly interact with pathogens to protect cells from infection [19\u201321]. A change in redox status has been implicated in initiating inflammatory responses through the activation of transcription factors, such as NF-\u03baB, AP-1, and other signal transduction pathways, including MAPKs, leading to the enhanced expression of pro-inflammatory genes [22\u201324]. The inflammatory response is also a powerful weapon for the host to be able to fight against pathogen infections. Because G6PD plays a pivotal role in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis, it will be of paramount importance to delineate how G6PD deficiency can affect immune responses as a result of redox imbalance.",

We characterized the effects and mechanisms of G6PD knockdown in the inflammatory response, and compared the antiviral response in scramble and G6PD-knockdown (G6PD-kd) A549 cells modulated by COX-2. The effects of G6PD knockdown on the induction level of COX-2 and PGE2 was analyzed. Furthermore, the involvement of signaling pathway known to mediate regulation of COX-2/PGE2 on coronavirus infection was identified. The results clearly show that the down-regulation of COX-2 and subsequent decline of PGE2 impair antiviral response in G6PD-kd A549 cells upon TNF-\u03b1 treatment. Most importantly, we have provided evidence that G6PD plays an important role in activating NOX/MAPK/NF-\u03baB/COX-2 cascade and protects cells against viral infection.",

The effect of G6PD deficiency on the COX-2 expression transcriptional level upon TNF-\u03b1 treatment was determined. G6PD-kd A549 cells displayed decreased COX-2 mRNA expression in a time-dependent manner, and COX-2 promoter activity was attenuated by G6PD silencing (Fig 1A and 1B). At the translational level, TNF-\u03b1 enhanced the accumulation of COX-2 protein in a time-dependent manner with a maximal response within 3\u20136 h in A549 scramble control cells (Fig 1C), similar to previous reports [29]. A decreased pattern of COX-2 protein was observed in G6PD-kd cells (Fig 1C). In parallel with the increased expression of COX-2, TNF-\u03b1 also induced a time-dependent increase of PGE2 synthesis, the downstream arachidonic acid metabolite product of COX-2. G6PD-kd A549 cells exhibited less PGE2 synthesis than that of scramble control cells (Fig 1D). Our results demonstrated that G6PD acts as a positive regulator in the TNF-\u03b1-triggered inflammatory response and is not a result of the levels of TNFR1 expression in these two types of cells (S1B Fig).",

These findings are consistent with our previous findings [26, 32]. We further analyzed whether impaired COX-2/PGE2 expression via TNF-\u03b1 stimulation plays a role in increasing viral replication in G6PD-kd cells and used viral gene expression to represent viral replication. In doing so, we found that TNF-\u03b1 inhibited viral replication in both scramble control and G6PD-kd cells (Fig 1F). Inhibition of TNF-\u03b1-induced COX-2 expression by celecoxib (COX-2 inhibitor) enhanced viral replication in scramble control cells but not in G6PD-kd A549 cells. These results indicate that TNF-\u03b1-induced COX-2 expression inhibits viral replication; increased susceptibility to viral infection in G6PD-kd A549 cells may occur by an impaired inflammatory response upon cytokine stimulation.",

The significance of the G6PD expression in the inflammatory response, especially in airway epithelial cells, is largely unknown. The present study is the first to show that G6PD knockdown inhibits MAPKs and NF-\u03baB signaling upon TNF-\u03b1 treatment, resulting in a significant decrease in COX-2 expression and PGE2 production. The underlying mechanism is a result of the decreased NOX activation as well as NOX subunits expression in G6PD-kd cells. These results suggest that G6PD deficiency impairs the cellular inflammatory response and has implications in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases in G6PD-deficient individuals.",

G6PD not only provides a key substrate source for NOX, but may regulate the expression of NOX subunits because the mRNA levels of NOX2 components (p40phox, p47phox, and p67phox) are increased by G6PD overexpression in macrophages [8]. Consistent with this report, we have observed that G6PD knockdown markedly decreased the expression level of NOX subunits in parallel with an absence of NOX induction by TNF-\u03b1. G6PD can control nuclear NADPH-dependent superoxide production by NOX4 [43], and G6PD is colocalized with NOX in high glucose conditions, while providing NADPH for NOX activation [44] is an additional evidence to support the hypothesis that G6PD can modulate NOX activity.",

            "text": "Physiologically, the activation of NOX can trigger the production of chemokines and inflammation-associated proteins upon viral infection [19, 45, 46]. NOX2 and Duox play a role in the clearance of viral infection [35, 47, 48]. In the present study, we have found that the replication level of coronavirus is decreased by NOX inhibition and COX-2 activation as well as PGE2 secretion upon TNF-\u03b1 treatment are diminished in G6PD-kd A549 cells. More interestingly, increased viral replication is observed by using COX-2 inhibitor in A549 cells. Together, these findings indicate that COX-2/PGE2 production actually improves anti-coronaviral infection in airway epithelial cells. Such notion is also supported by the finding that viral N gene is decreased by pretreatment with exogenous PGE2 (data not shown). These data are also in agreement with other group's findings, showing that COX-2/PGE2 production inhibits viral replication via the upregulation of antiviral cytokines (i.e. IL-32, IL-27, IFN-\u03bb1) [30\u201331, 49] in A549 cells. In contrast to our observation, it has been reported that inhibition of COX-2 and PGE2 enhanced antiviral activity against virus infection in various kinds of cells [50\u201352]. Possible explanations for these contradicting results include different virus species, conditions for the pretreatment of TNF-\u03b1 in cells, and different regulatory signalings between coronavirus and other upper respiratory tract virus for triggering innate immune response. Nevertheless, our new findings provide additional argument for the notion that NOX-mediated COX-2 signaling can be modulated by G6PD for triggering antiviral response.",

Dysregulation of NF-\u03baB has been implicated in inflammation, viral infection, autoimmune diseases and improper immune development [54\u201356]. It has been found that G6PD-overexpressing macrophages increase the expression of proinflammatory genes via the activation of NF-\u03baB [8]. Interestingly, we have also demonstrated that G6PD knockdown impairs NF-\u03baB signaling triggered by NOX activity in the present report. When cells are infected by pathogens, cytokines are released, followed by the induction of inflammatory mediators. The increased levels of inflammatory mediators play a protective role or initiate an irreversible immune response leading to cell death. Thus, the current study provides novel evidence to suggest that TNF-\u03b1-mediated NF-\u03baB signaling is, in part, modulated by a close interaction between G6PD and NOX. Additional studies are needed to elucidate the detailed interaction between these two well-known enzymes.",

G6PD knockdown can affect viral infection by decreasing the epithelial inflammatory response.

The activated NOX/MAPK/c-JUN/NF-\u03baB signaling is concomitant with the increased expression of COX-2 and production of PGE2. G6PD knockdown results in the reduced generation of cellular NADPH and an impairment of TNF-\u03b1-induced NOX activation. Consequently, COX-2 expression and PGE2 production are also less in G6PD-knockdown cells, suggesting the participation of G6PD in the TNF-\u03b1-induced inflammatory response against viral infection.",
