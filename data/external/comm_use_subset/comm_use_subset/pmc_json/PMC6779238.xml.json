The severity of MERS ranges from asymptomatic or mild disease to acute respiratory distress syndrome leading to death. Clinical features include fever, cough, shortness of breath, and multi-organ failure resulting in death, especially in individuals with underlying comorbidities, such as diabetes and renal failure [1]. Since MERS-CoV was first isolated from a patient with fatal respiratory disease in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 2012 [3], the World Health Organization (WHO) has been notified of >2,300 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection and >800 deaths as of April 2019 [4]. Although MERS occurs in the Middle East, including the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, patients with MERS have also been reported from MERS non-endemic regions, such as Europe, the United States, and Asia, as imported cases from the Middle East. Additionally, a large outbreak in South Korea suggested that MERS remains a serious threat to global public health [5].",

To date, various kinds of candidate vaccines for MERS have been developed, including live attenuated, subunit, DNA, prime-boost, and recombinant vector vaccines [6,7]; however, no approved vaccine or specific treatment for MERS is currently available. MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein comprises S1 and S2 subunit regions, with the S1 subunit of MERS-CoV responsible for its binding to host cells expressing the viral receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 through the receptor-binding domain (RBD) [8\u201310]. During vaccine development, previous studies showed that the S1 protein could serve as a dominant target for virus-specific neutralizing antibodies (VNAs) [11\u201313]. In fact, S1 proteins have been used as the antigen in several MERS-CoV vaccine preparations. For example, full-length S protein or truncated S1-subunit glycoprotein has been incorporated into several vectored vaccines against MERS-CoV, subsequently eliciting VNAs following inoculation of these candidates into animals [14,15].",

Rabies in humans is almost always fatal upon the appearance of clinical symptoms; however, rabies is a vaccine-preventable disease, with rabies-inactivated vaccines providing close to 100% protection by pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis and having saved millions of lives since the development of the first rabies vaccination for humans in 1885 [17]. An estimated 55,000 people still die of rabies annually, with cases reported from >150 countries and territories among various animals (mainly dogs) and humans; therefore, the WHO has set a goal to eliminate human deaths due to rabies by 2030 [18]. Inactivated rabies vaccines are currently available worldwide; however, they are not an ideal strategy because they require frequent administrations (4\u20136 doses). On this point, attenuated live vaccines represent a promising and attractive alternative, because they can elicit both humoral and cellular immunity [19], suggesting that frequent vaccinations are not needed.",

Similarly, M-gene-deficient RV (RV\u0394M) is propagation impaired, because the RV-M protein participates in the budding process [23]. RV\u0394P and RV\u0394M remain capable of expressing viral proteins, assembling, and propagating only in specially constructed cells expressing the RV-P and RV-M proteins, respectively; however, infectious progeny of RV\u0394P and RV\u0394M are not produced in other cells.

After incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h, suspended N2A cells were added to the wells (2.0 \u00d7105 cells/mL; 50 \u03bcL/well), and cells were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 48 h and then fixed with 80% acetone for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were then stained with the FITC-labeled anti-RV antibody at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. The VNA titer was defined as serum dilution at 50% fluorescent focus reduction in the infected cultures.

In this respect, our replication-deficient recombinant RV-based vector (RV\u0394P) is highly advantageous, given that RV\u0394P-vector vaccines are completely non-pathogenic in animals due to the inability of RV\u0394P to replicate in infected hosts [26,29]. Moreover, RV\u0394P-MERS/S1 vaccination did not cause disease in suckling mice, suggesting the safety of this vaccine candidate. Deletion of the gene encoding the P protein from the genome of RV\u0394P-MERS/S1 precluded the possibility of reversion to a virulent virus [22], with this characteristic of the replication-deficient vaccine candidate promoting its efficacy for use as a live vaccine. A previous study reported the avirulence of a replication-deficient RV virus expressing Ebola virus glycoprotein according to the survival of all adult and suckling mice intracerebrally inoculated with the virus along with maintenance of intact brain architecture [58]. By contrast, a replication-competent Ebola virus glycoprotein-expressing RV vaccine recovered from the SAD B19 RV wildlife vaccine strain and harboring an attenuating point mutation retained its neurovirulence in suckling mice when administered intracerebrally [58,59].",

            "text": "In this study, MERS-CoV S1 subunit expressed by RV\u0394P-MERS/S1 was constructed to be translated together with the RV-G transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains and 14 amino acids of the ectodomain of RV-G. There were several reasons to use this construct. First, because of the weak capacity for transcription and replication of the P-deficient RV vector in cells, it was expected that the full-length S gene (~4 kb) was too long to express using the RV\u0394P vector. In fact, we found that a recombinant virus containing the S gene of MERS-CoV with the deletion of C-terminal 16 amino acids was rescued but did not express the S1 protein with the variable deletion of S1 gene in the genome (S1 Fig), presumably suggesting that this fragment was too large to be inserted into the RV\u0394P vector. Second, the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of RV-G were fused with the S1 protein, because these regions play an important role in the expression of foreign proteins on the surface of virions [60]. Interestingly, there appears to be a loss of S1 protein after purification with sucrose gradient compared with that of PEG-precipitated viruses (Fig 3b); nevertheless, S1 was fused with transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of RV for surface expression. Presumably, the specific S1 protein might be produced in the cell line, but it might be incorporated onto the surface partially because the original RV-G protein would be easier to incorporate into the virions and be more dominant than the foreign proteins. Finally, insertion of the S1 subunit is reportedly more effective than insertion of the full-length S gene for the development of DNA vaccines for MERS-CoV [61]. In the case of the adenovirus 5 (Ad5) vector-based vaccine, MERS-CoV S1-subunit-expressing Ad5 induced stronger VNA responses than Ad5 expressing the full-length S protein [62,63]. This might be because immunization with the S1 subunit can induce humoral immune responses more efficiently than that with the full-length S protein [62]. Additionally, there might remain concerns regarding the safety of using vaccines that express the full-length S protein, as such vaccines can potentially induce harmful side effects caused by non-neutralizing epitopes [62]. A previous SARS-CoV vaccine study reported inflammatory and immunopathological effects, such as eosinophilic infiltration, in immunized animals [64]. Therefore, insertion of the S1 subunit might be more favorable as an antigen relative to using the full-length S protein for vaccine development.",
