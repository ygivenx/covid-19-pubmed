            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a highly contagious, acute enteric viral disease of swine characterized by vomiting, watery diarrhea, and dehydration and has become a devastating issue in many pig-raising countries [1]. PED was first reported in feeding and fattening pigs in England in 1971 [2] and then emerged in many European and Asian countries [3,4]. In late April 2013, PED was first confirmed in the United States, and quickly spread to all over the country [5\u20137]. In China, PED was identified as a sporadic viral enteric disease in pig-herds before 2010 [8\u201310]. However, outbreaks of PED with an increased severity of diarrhea, vomiting and dehydration have occurred in China since 2010, and the disease approached a mobility of as high as 100% and a mortality of 80\u2013100% in piglets less than 10 days old, being recognized as a devastating illness causing death in neonatal piglets [11,12]. Pig farms in Jiangxi, one of the major pig-raising provinces located in eastern China, were severely affected by the outbreaks of PED accompanying with certain unique characteristics. Unlike its intrinsic seasonal epidemics ever seen before 2010, the PED prevalent in Jiangxi in 2013 has emerged all year round even in the midst of summer, and much worse, some of pig-raising farms repeatedly got affected from the disease, resulting in massive deaths of neonatal piglets. Likewise, the pigs vaccinated with inactivated CV777-based vaccines could also get affected with the disease [8,12]. The epidemiology of the 2013 PED outbreaks in Jiangxi suggested genetic/antigenic variations of PED virus (PEDV), the etiologic agent of PED, might occur so that the antigenicity, immunogenicity and virulence of the PEDVs had altered. Hence, in this study, we attempted to reveal the molecular characterizations of the PEDV strains currently circulating in Jiangxi, China and elucidate their phylogenetic relationship with PEDV vaccine strains and other reference strains.",

The genome of PEDV is approximately 28 kb nucleotides (nt) in length, containing 5\u00b4untranslated region (UTR), 3\u00b4UTR with a polyadenylated tail and at least seven open reading frames (ORFs), arranged in the order of 5\u00b4UTR-ORF1a/1b-spike glycoprotein (S)-hypothetical protein gene (ORF3)-envelope (E)-membrane (M)-nucleocapsid (N)-3\u00b4UTR [15,16]. The 5\u00b4UTR is about 291\u2013296 nt, and the 3\u00b4UTR is about 334 nt in length. The polymerase gene, occupying about 5\u00b4two thirds of the complete genome, consists of ORF1a and ORF 1b, which encodes the polyprotein 1ab (PP 1ab). The four structural protein genes, occupying the 3\u00b4one-third part of the PEDV genome, encode S, E, M, and N proteins, respectively. The hypothetical accessory protein ORF3 is encoded by the gene located between S- and E-protein encoding regions. Previous analyses on the entire genome sequences indicated that the recent PEDV field strains circulating in China were genetically different from CV777 strain, from which vaccines have been generated and widely used in China for years [17\u201321].",

To eliminate possible co-infections caused by porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine rotavirus (PoRV), and other common pathogenic intestinal pathogens, differentiation assays were performed using standard protocols. Ninety-six out of 125 samples were tested positive for PEDV, and all samples had been confirmed to be free of TGEV, PoRV and other common enteric pathogens (data not shown). To address the genetic/antigenic variations, and phylogenetic characteristics of PEDV strains associated with 2013 Jiangxi PED outbreaks, two representative PEDV strains, designated CH/JX-1/2013 and CH/JX-2/2013 (the GenBank accession numbers are KF760557 and KJ526096, respectively), were used for sequencing the full-length genome.",

The entire PEDV genome was amplified by 33 pairs of primer designed with Primer 3 software (http://primer3.ut.ee/) based on the conserved regions determined by a multiple alignment analysis of the reference strains and CV777 (S2 Table). Fragments were amplified on the conditions of a denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 4 min, 35 cycles (94\u00b0C x 45 sec, 53\u00b0C x 45 sec, 72\u00b0C x 1.5 min), and then with a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 min.

A total of 26 unique nucleotide substitutions were identified between two Jiangxi PEDV strains (CH/JX-1/2013 and CH/JX-2/2013) and 30 reference PEDV strains, which resulted in 14-aa changes, and most of them were located in ORF1a, ORF1b and S gene.

To elucidate the molecular characterization and phylogeny of the PEDV field strains associated with 2013 Jiangxi PED outbreaks, the entire genome sequences of two representative PEDV strains confirmed in Jiangxi were determined and analyzed. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that CH/JX-1/2013 and CH/JX-1/2013 defined in this study along with the strains determined post-2010 were clustered into group 2, whereas the strains detected ante-2010 were clustered into group 1. The results of phylogenetic analyses of those PEDV strains examined in this study were similar to that of described elsewhere [22]. CH/JX-1/2013 and CH/JX-1/2013 showed the highest nucleotide identity (>99%) with six newly confirmed US strains (IA1, Co/13, USA/Indiana, ISU13-22038-IA-homogenate, ISU13-22038-IA-P9, and 13-019349) and five Chinese strains (GD-B, AH2012, BJ-2011-1, CH/ZMD/ZY, and CH-HZ/2012) identified post-2010, suggesting these PEDV strains might have evolved from the same origin although the mechanisms of the evolution of the viruses are roughly unknown yet. Three field PEDV strains, JS2008, JS2008new and SD-M together with two attenuated PEDV strains, DR13 and vaccine_KC189944, were clustered into an independent cluster and showed 24-nt deletions in nsp 3 of ORF1a and 49-nt deletions in the C terminus of ORF3. These unique characteristics suggested that the three field PEDV strains might derive from the same source, and a recombination event might have occurred between these three viruses and the two vaccine strains in the same subgroup. Interestingly, a comparison analysis revealed that CH/JX-1/2013 and CH/JX-1/2013 had 99.7% nucleotide identity to the strain of GD-B (GenBank accession NO.JX088695) isolated from Guangdong, an adjacent province of Jiangxi, in which the severe PED outbreaks emerged in October 2010 [11,23]. Pigs are frequently traded between Jiangxi and Guangdong, which might be one of important factors causing the cross dissemination of PEDVs in this region.

It is known that the 5\u00b4-UTRs of coronaviruses form conserved RNA structural elements which are critical for viral replication, sgmRNA transcription, and translation [24]. Studies on the betacoronavirus have indicated that the stem-loop 2 (SL2) in 5\u00b4 UTR is extremely conserved in all coronaviruses, and plays a cis-acting reaction on transcription and replication, and more importantly the replication of the virus requires the conservative sequence and a firm number of nucleotides with specific properties in SL2 in 5\u00b4UTR [25]. Although the \u2018U\u2019 insertion in SL2 does not alter the RNA secondary structure, it might slightly affect the efficiency of virus replication, which needs to be addressed in the future studies. The core sequence (5\u00b4-CUAAAC-3\u00b4) in TRS of PEDV, which was also present in CH/JX-1/2013 and CH/JX-2/2013, has reported to be a determinant factor in transcriptional regulation in coronavirus because the synthesis of sgmRNA requires the appropriate tertiary structure of core sequence [26]. Both PEDV and TGEV belong to the alphacoronavirus genus within the Coronaviridae family and possess the conserved core sequence structure. Studies based on the infectious genomic TGEV cDNAs have proved that the nucleotides immediately flanking the TRS sequence could apparently affect the expression of the sgmRNA. And the nucleotides adjacent to core sequences of the leader TRS (CS-L) by the 3\u00b4region are more decisive for mRNA synthesis than nucleotides in the 5\u00b4 region. The motif of 5\u00b4-GAAA-3\u00b4 within 3\u00b4CS-L (5\u00b4-CUAAACGAAA-3\u00b4) shows a higher expression than that of other motifs [27]. In respect of the PEDV, an \u2018A\u2019 deletion immediately followed the CS-L sequence in the 5\u00b4UTR of CH/JX-1/2013 and CH/JX-2/2013 as well as other post-2010 PEDV strains analyzed in the study and thus, this deletion formed a four base oligonucleotide (5\u00b4-GAAA-3) adjacent to the CS-L by the 3\u00b4region, which might up-regulate the sgmRNA expression in PEDV [24].",

            "text": "The S protein of PEDV is known to play pivotal roles in viral entry and inducing the neutralizing antibodies in natural hosts, and thus makes it become a primary target for the development of effective vaccines against PEDV [28\u201331]. It was demonstrated that there were significant genetic variations in the S gene between the newly determined PEDV field strains and early isolates [20,32]. The results in this study agreed with previous documentations. Additionally, CH/JX-1/2013 and CH/JX-2/2013 showed extremely high nucleotide and aa identity with each other but less to CV777 and attenuated strains (attenuated vaccine_KC18944 and attenuated DR13). There were significant aa differences between the G1 and G2 members, and most of them were located in NTD of the S protein of PEDVs. When compared to the group 1 strains of PEDV, CH/JX-1/2013 and CH/JX-2/2013, members of group 2, showed significant antigenic and hydrophobic differences, and some of which were located in the neutralizing epitope regions. Those genetic variations made the CH/JX-1/2013 and CH/JX-2/2013 and post-2010 field PEDV strains different from the ante-2010 strains, especially the CV777. It might explain why the recent PED outbreaks were significantly different from the previous sporadic outbreaks. Present PED became a devastating enteric viral disease causing substantial economic losses in the pig industry in major pig-raising countries in the world, and recently made it become a reportable disease by USDA [33]. Moreover, the present PEDV field strains displayed considerable genetic variations from CV777-based vaccine strain, a strain being widely used for production of PEDV vaccines in China for many years. Notably, Leucine, a highly hydrophobic aa residue in the middle of one neutralizing epitope (L1371I) of the S gene of CV777 was substituted by an Isoleucine, a higher hydrophobic index aa residue in both CH/JX-1/2013 and CH/JX-2/2013 strains. This variation might provide a possible mechanism for a poor protection on swine vaccinated with the CV777-based vaccines.",

[29] have reported that a reduced cell-culture-adapted PEDV strain (attenuated DR13, passage 100) has a truncated ORF3 of a 51-nt deletion, suggesting that this gene may be involved in cell tropism and is essential for the virulence of PEDVs. By contrast, CH/JX-1/2013 and CH/JX-2/2013, together with the post-2010 variant PEDV strains had an intact ORF3 of 675 nucleotides encoding a protein of 224 aa. The phylogenic analysis demonstrated that the ORF3-based tree had a similar topology with the one generated from the entire genome sequences. And thus the ORF3 of PEDV may serve as a useful target gene for phylogenetic analysis of newly emerging field PEDV strains since its small size. As recognized previously [34,35], there is a large deletion region existing in PEDV isolates attenuated DR13 (51-nt at the position of 245\u2013295), SM98 (210 nt at the position of 1\u2013210) and SD-M (51-nt at the position of 245\u2013295), a Chinese strain propagated only four passages on cell lines.",

Differences at the level of the nucleotides and deduced aa between the present field PEDV strains and CV777, especially the aa substitutions in the neutralizing epitope of PEDV field strains, might have conferred the less effectiveness of the vaccines currently widely being used in China.
