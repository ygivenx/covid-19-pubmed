            "text": "Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is the leading cause of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) which brings tremendous economic losses to swine industry (Darwich et al., 2004; Opriessnig et al., 2007). PCV2 is a non-enveloped, single-stranded, closed-circular DNA virus, belonging to the genus Circovirus in the family Circoviridae with 1767 or 1768 nucleotides (Meehan et al., 1997). Eleven PCV2 open reading frames (ORFs) have been predicted with six have been well characterized (Ellis et al., 1998; Li et al., 2018). The ORF1 (nucleotides 51\u2013995) gene encodes the Rep protein to initiate replication (Mankertz et al., 1998). The ORF2-encoded Cap protein is the only structural protein and is an immune-associated protein (Nawagitgul et al., 2000). The ORF3 protein has been identified in 2005 as an inducer of apoptosis (Liu et al., 2005). The ORF4 protein is not essential for viral replication but involved in host cell apoptosis inhibition (He et al., 2013). The ORF5 was characterized by our group and has been shown localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and induces ER stress (Lv et al., 2015). Notably, it is reported that PCV2 ORF5 does not affect host cell apoptosis but inhibits host cell proliferation via the prolongation of S phase (Lv et al., 2015).",

GPNMB is a type I transmembrane protein containing an N-terminal signal peptide, an integrin-binding (RGD) motif and a polycystic kidney disease (PKD) domain in extracellular domain (ECD), a single pass transmembrane domain and a 53 amino acid (AA) cytoplasmic tail (Selim, 2009; Singh et al., 2010). Previous studies have showed the GPNMB is involved in various physiological and pathological processes, including immune system activation, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, tissue-repair, especially the invasion and metastasis of malignant tumors (Rose et al., 2010; Oyewumi et al., 2016). Emerging studies have generated a more complex picture regarding the expression of GPNMB in various cancer progression, including lung cancer, ovarian cancer, stomach cancer and breast cancer (Singh et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2012; Maric et al., 2013).",

Accumulating evidence demonstrated that the subversion of host cell cycle is a common mechanism employed by virus to facilitate its replication (Swanton and Jones, 2001; He et al., 2002; Laichalk and Thorley-Lawson, 2005; Grey et al., 2010; Balistreri et al., 2016). As one indispensable physiological process, cell cycle contains a series of consecutive biochemical switches allowing the DNA replication of cell genome at the S-phase, subsequently generating daughter cells (G1 and G2-phase) via the equal division during mitosis (M-phase) and quiescent cells are referred as being in G0-phase (Harper and Brooks, 2005). The binding of Cyclins and Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) is required for the entry into the cell cycle phases (Morgan, 1995). It has been reported that the activation of p53 pathway induced by PCV2 infection causes the S phase accumulation, which provides favorable conditions for efficient viral replication (Xu et al., 2016).",

In addition, we also revealed that GPNMB positively regulates Cyclin A expression and triggers a higher proportion of cells to enter S-phase.

The GST-fused ORF5 or GST protein were treated with pull-down lysis buffer and then immobilized with glutathione beads, followed by the addition of cell lysates with Flag-GPNMB. The GST pull-down assay clearly showed that the host GPNMB can be captured by GST-ORF5 via a direct physical contact (Figure 3A).",

However, whether the GPNMB could regulate Cyclin A expression was still unknown. To explore this, we measured the Cyclin A level in GPNMB overexpression or knockdown cells. As shown in Figures 7C\u2013E, overexpression of GPNMB significantly boosted Cyclin A expression. Cyclin A controls G1/S, S/G2, and G2/M phase cell cycle transitions, which are critical for initiation and progression of DNA synthesis (Yam et al., 2002). Thus, we measured the cell cycle in GPNMB-overexpressed cells. As shown in Figure 7F, the proportion of GPNMB-overexpressed cells found to be in S-phase was 4.12%, whereas which for control cells were 14.59% or 12.47%, respectively.

Previous study has revealed that PCV2 ORF3 protein can facilitate the proteasomal degradation of regulator of G protein signaling 16 (RGS16) to promote IL-6 and IL-8 secretion (Choi et al., 2015). Moreover, ORF3 protein also has been reported competes with p53 in binding to Pirh2 and mediates the deregulation of p53 homeostasis (Karuppannan et al., 2010). Additionally, PCV2 ORF4 has been found for stabilizing the concentration of ferritin heavy chain (FHC) to antagonizes host cell apoptosis (Lv et al., 2016). However, whether PCV2 ORF5 is involved in these responses was still unknown. In the present study, the high-throughput sequencing was conducted and the functional classification and pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs were performed to elucidate this enigma. DEGs libraries analysis provided data regarding transcriptomic changes in PAM cells transfected with ORF5 or infected with PCV2. We found more genes were changed in the ORF5-transfected cell compared with PCV2 infected cells. This could be explained by the fact that the transfection efficiency is higher that PCV infection.",

In this study, the transcription analysis of cellular response to PCV2 infection and ORF5-transfection in PAM cells also revealed that the GPNMB expression was affected by PCV2 infection (Supplementary Tables S2, S3). Next, we experimentally proved that PCV2 infection and ORF5 transfection down-regulates GPNMB expression (Figure 2). This is consistent with the transcription analysis done by other group, which also showed that the GPNMB mRNA level was down-regulated after PCV2 infection (Li et al., 2013). The GPNMB was an ORF5-interacting host factor as identified by yeast two-hybrid assay. In this study, we employed diffident approach to validate the interaction between ORF5 and GPNMB. GST-pulldown assay demonstrated that GPNMB can bind to ORF5 protein (Figure 3A). The isolation of Flag-GPNMB/pEGFP-ORF5 or Flag-ORF5/GPNMB complexes suggested that GPNMB could bind to ORF5 in vitro (Figures 3C,D). Furthermore, confocal microscopy confirmed the co-localization of GPNMB and ORF5 protein, confirming the interaction between GPNMB and ORF5 (Figure 3B). Taken together, these results convincingly demonstrated that PCV2 ORF5 interacts with host protein GPNMB.",

            "text": "It has been demonstrated that PCV2 infection affects GPNMB expression, but whether the GPNMB can alter PCV2 replication remains unknown. In the present study, the effect of GPNMB on PCV2 replication and ORF5 protein expression were investigated. To this aim, cell lines that stalely overexpressing or knockdown GPNMB were generated. Several results collectively showed that GPNMB inhibited PCV2 replication and ORF5 protein expression (Figure 4). Furthermore, the transient overexpression of GPNMB also inhibited PCV2 replication (Figure 5). Taken together, all these results demonstrated that GPNMB is an important cellular factor that restricts PCV2 replication. Growing evidence identified GPNMB as an attractive therapeutic target for tumor and cancer (Swanton and Jones, 2001; He et al., 2002; Laichalk and Thorley-Lawson, 2005; Grey et al., 2010; Balistreri et al., 2016). Here, we showed the GPNMB plays vital role in restricting PCV2 replication. However, whether the GPNMB could also inhibit other viruses needs further investigations.",

            "text": "It has been generally accepted that viruses could regulate host cellular life cycle to favor their replication (Tischer et al., 1987). Rotavirus replication correlated with S/G2 interphase arrest in cell cycle (Gluck et al., 2017). Herpesviruses (Flemington, 2001), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) protein (Yuan et al., 2005), influenza A virus and its NS1 protein (Jiang et al., 2013), human respiratory syncytial virus and murine norovirus (MNV) (Davies et al., 2015) can induce cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase. PCV2 replication is both S-and G2/M-phase dependent, PCV2 infection induces cellular S phase accumulation via the suppression of Cyclin A (Tang et al., 2013). In addition to the finding that the GPNMB interacted with PCV2 ORF5 and restricted PCV2 replication, we surprisingly find that GPNMB enhanced Cyclin A expression and triggered a less proportion of cells to enter S-phase (Figures 7, 8). This is consistent with the previous study that knockdown of GPNMB suppresses the cell proliferation (Oyewumi et al., 2016). Thus, it reasonable to speculate that the GPNMB inhibits PCV2 infection through the up-regulation of Cyclin A. However, the molecular mechanism still needs further investigations. In addition, whether the PCV2 infection regulates Cyclin A expression via the down-regulation of GPNMB should be dissected in further studies.",
