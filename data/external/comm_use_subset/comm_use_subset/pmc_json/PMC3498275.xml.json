            "text": "The need for the timely collection of diagnostic biosamples (such as nasal swabs) during acute symptomatic episodes represents a major obstacle to large-scale studies on acute respiratory infection (ARI) epidemiology. This may be circumvented by having the participants collect their own nasal swabs (\u201cself-collected nasal swabs\u201d or \u201cself-swabbing\u201d). This method has been shown to be highly acceptable and feasible in various populations, e.g. among parents who collected nasal swabs from their children [1] or adults who collected swabs from themselves [2] (also reviewed in [3]). While the mere feasibility of nasal self-swabbing has thus been amply demonstrated, efforts to validate the diagnostic equivalence of self-swabbing compared to staff-swabbing are still ongoing. In a sample of 38 individuals with ARI symptoms, Larios et al. compared self-collected midturbinate swabs with staff-collected nasopharyngeal swabs (gold standard) that were collected the same day. The self-collected swabs had a sensitivity of 86% for the detection of respiratory pathogens compared to the gold standard [4]. Luinstra et al. found similar detection rates for respiratory pathogens between self- and staff-collected midturbinate swabs when one staff-collected and one self-collected swab were taken from opposite nostrils during the same visit to a campus health center [5]. Ip et al. investigated the validity of self-collected nasal (posterior nares) and pharyngeal swabs to detect influenza virus infection and came to the conclusion that self-swabs may be a good alternative [6]. While these results do provide substantial evidence for the validity of self-collected midturbinate swabs, anterior nasal swabs have not been evaluated in this respect. Moreover, self-collected nasal swabs collected on separate days have not been compared with each other.",

In the study center, a trained staff member (A.G.) obtained a nasal swab (regular flocked swab, Copan, Brescia, Italy, product number 359C) from the participant\u2019s left nostril and instructed him/her how to perform a self-swab. The participants also received written and visual instructions for nasal self-swabbing. The participants then self-collected a swab from the right nostril. Briefly, the swab was to be inserted into the nostril to the point where the basal edge of the flocked tip had just entered the nostril, corresponding to a depth of insertion of approx. 1 cm. The swab was then rotated three times, being careful to swab all 360\u00b0 of the anterior nasal lining and to include the superior recess (\u201cLittle\u2019s area\u201d) and the latero-inferior recess. The swab was then placed into 1 ml universal viral transport medium (Copan). A swabbing kit containing written and visual self-swabbing instructions, two nasal swabs and two vials of 1 ml transport medium was then given to the participants with the request to self-collect two nasal swabs (one from each nostril) at home the next day, to place each swab in 1 ml transport medium and to return the swabs to the study center as soon as possible. The swabs were stored at \u221270\u00b0C until analysis. The timeline of the study is shown in Fig. 1.",

            "text": "It should be kept in mind that only two individuals with PCR-proven influenza virus infection were detected. Therefore, anterior nasal self-swabbing for the detection of influenza virus infection still needs to be validated in dedicated studies. Recently, a flocked mid-turbinate swab was developed and turned out to be superior to the gold standard nasopharyngeal swab in terms of ARI virus detection [8]. The anterior nasal swab used in the present study has not been compared to this midturbinate swab. This should be done in a future study. Our findings are also limited by the fact that the study was conducted in a selected study population recruited within a research institution. However, the population included a mixture of scientific, clerical and support staff. Notably, education level spanned a broad range and did not influence viral detection or \u03b2-actin DNA levels. Nonetheless, our findings need to be validated in future studies using random samples drawn from the general population.",
