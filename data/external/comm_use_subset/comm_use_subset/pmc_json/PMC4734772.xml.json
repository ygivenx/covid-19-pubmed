            "text": "Saffold virus (SAFV) is a cardiovirus belonging to the family Picornaviridae. In 2007, SAFV was isolated from a stool sample obtained from an infant who suffered a fever of unknown origin in 1981 [1]. Prior to this, cardioviruses were thought to cause serious diseases, such as myocarditis, encephalomyelitis, and diabetes, mainly in small rodents [2\u20136]. The zoonotic Encephalomyocarditis virus (which belongs to the genus Cardiovirus) is infectious in primates, including humans, but causes only occasional and mild outbreaks [7\u201312]. After its initial identification, SAFV was primarily detected in fecal and throat swab specimens from infants and children with acute gastroenteritis or acute upper respiratory symptoms [13\u201325]. Epidemiological and genetic analyses suggest that SAFV, especially genotypes 2 and 3, is circulating freely in the human population and is transmitted from human to human during early childhood because the sera of children and the elderly have high rates of neutralizing antibodies against SAFV genotypes 2 and 3 [18, 19, 22, 24, 26, 27]. The prevalence of SAFV in other mammals, including rodents, is still uncertain.",

On the other hand, SAFV mono-infection was found in children with diarrhea, hand-foot-mouth disease, and upper respiratory inflammation [25, 30\u201332]. In addition, a surveillance program for acute flaccid paralysis (for global polio eradication) conducted by the World Health Organization occasionally detected SAFV in fecal specimens from patients with non-polio acute flaccid paralysis [15, 27, 33, 34]. Although SAFV is also found in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of infants with cerebellitis [35] and aseptic meningitis [36], it is rarely observed in CSF samples from those with neurological diseases [13, 30, 35]; thus the role of SAFV in neurological diseases remains uncertain.",

Thus, neonatal mice have been used for viral isolation and to investigate the pathogenesis of enteroviruses. However, picornaviruses generally show high host specificity; the natural host for all human enteroviruses is the human [37]. Enterovirus 71, a member of the family Picornaviridae, can cause meningitis and encephalitis because it infects human neurons. Some human isolates induce paralysis in neonatal mice after experimental infection of the brain. However, the mice often show severe myositis due to viral infection of not only neurons but also skeletal muscle; this does not happen in humans [38]. By contrast, coxsackievirus B and mouse-adapted enterovirus 71 infect large neurons in the brains of neonatal or adult mice and these animal models mimic the neuropathology observed in the human brain [39\u201342].",

Indeed, a recent report [43] shows that mice subjected to intracerebral inoculation with HeLa cell-adapted SAFV type 2, which had been passaged eight times in rhesus monkey kidney epithelial (LLC-MK2) cells and then 13 times in the alpha/beta interferon-deficient human glial cell line, U118MG, developed neurological disorders. In the present study, the primary aim was to examine the susceptibility of mouse brain to SAFV-3 in the absence of viral host adaptation. We used two clinical isolates of SAFV-3: the JPN 08\u2013404 strain (isolated from the CSF of a patient with aseptic meningitis) [36], and the Gunma/176/2008 strain (isolated from a throat swab from a patient with acute upper respiratory inflammation) [21]. Neonatal and young ddY mice, and young BALB/c mice were infected and analyzed using virological, pathological, and immunological methods. The results showed that both clinical isolates of SAFV-3 infected neural progenitor cells and glial cells, but not large neurons, and that both were mildly neurovirulent in mice; however, the clinical isolates showed different cell tropism and neurovirulence. Taken together, these results suggest that SAFV-3 is a candidate neuropathogenic virus that causes aseptic meningitis and other neurological disorders.",

Total RNA was extracted using the TRIzol Plus RNA Purification Kit (Ambion, Life Technologies Corporation). The brains from the ddY neonatal mice were removed from the skull, washed three times in PBS, and then separated into two parts (the cerebellum and the remaining brain, including the cerebrum and brain stem). The brains from young BALB/c mice were divided into three parts (the cerebrum, brain stem, and cerebellum) to quantify the viral RNA genome. Tissue samples (except samples of neonatal mice cerebellum) were homogenized using Lysing Matrix A (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA) and diluted in 2MEM to yield 10% homogenates. Samples of neonatal cerebellum were also homogenized using Lysing Matrix A (MP Biomedicals) in 1 ml of 2MEM. After centrifugation at 8,000 \u00d7 g for 5 min, the supernatants were subjected to PCR to detect the viral genome. Total RNA was extracted from the supernatants of tissue homogenates generated from the organs of young mice and the brains of the neonatal mice using an RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen). Contaminating DNA was removed from the extracted RNA using a TURBO DNA-free Kit (Ambion, Life Technologies Corporation). Nested RT-PCR was performed to detect the SAFV viral genome (the conserved 5' non-coding region; accession no. EF165067), and the product was amplified using OneStep RT-PCR (Qiagen) and TaKaRa Ex Taq (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan) kits [27]. The first and second primer sets are listed in Table 1. The nested RT-PCR protocol was as follows: the first-round of the RT-PCR was conducted for 30 min at 50\u00b0C (for reverse transcription) and 15 min at 95\u00b0C (for Taq polymerase activation), followed by 35 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 30 sec, 60\u00b0C for 30 sec, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min. The second-round of PCR was conducted for 3 min at 95\u00b0C, followed by 35 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 30 sec, 60\u00b0C for 30 sec, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min.",

SAFV antigens were detected in degenerated neural cells (which showed eccentric nuclei) around the lateral ventricle, which was the virus inoculation site, and in the undeveloped medulla of the cerebellum (Fig 2A, insets). In addition, a few neural cells within the spinal cord, and skeletal muscle cells throughout the body, were positive for viral antigens (Table 2). However, none of the large pyramidal neurons in the brain and spinal cord were positive for viral antigens. Moreover, viral antigens were detected in the oral cavity of UR-inoculated mice, but the histopathological changes were very weak. The number of viral antigen-positive cells in the cerebellum lobule of AM-inoculated mice was approximately five times greater than that in UR-inoculated mice on Day 3 p.i., and 16 times greater on Day 7 p.i.

RNA in situ hybridization using paraffin-embedded brain tissues harvested from neonatal mice at 3 days p.i. revealed that viral RNA was present in the ventricle, cerebrum, and brain stem of mice inoculated with either virus strain (Fig 2C).

Because the oral cavity of neonatal mice was positive for viral antigens after intracerebral inoculation with the UR strain (Fig 2A), we speculated that SAFV-3 might infect young mice through the mucosa. To explore this hypothesis, we infected young BALB/c mice with the AM and UR strains of SAFV-3 (104 CCID50 per mouse) via various routes (intraperitoneal, intravenous, oral, and intranasal). None of the animals showed clinical neurological signs. In addition, no histopathological changes were observed in the CNS (including the olfactory bulb) or other organs on Days 3, 8, and 21 p.i. However, on Day 3 post-intraperitoneal inoculation, immunohistochemical analysis revealed viral antigen-positive cells in the pancreas of all three AM-inoculated mice and one of the three UR-inoculated mice (S8 Fig). Similarly, on Day 3 post-intravenous inoculation of UR, viral antigens were detected in the pancreas in one of three mice. However, no histopathological changes or viral antigens were observed in the major organs after oral or intranasal inoculation with either virus strain. Interestingly, very mild and focal inflammatory infiltrations (in the absence of viral antigen) were seen in the nasal mucosa of mice inoculated with UR via the oral and intranasal routes. No virus was detected in the feces on Days 3 and 8 after oral infection. We then measured the levels of anti-SAFV-neutralizing antibodies in the sera of mice on Day 21 p.i., to examine seroconversion against each inoculated strain. All of the young BALB/c mice seroconverted after intracerebral, intraperitoneal, or intravenous inoculation with SAFV-3 (Fig 10). Notably, oral and intranasal inoculation with the UR strain induced seroconversion in young BALB/c mice. By contrast, mice orally administered the AM strain did not seroconvert. After intranasal administration, two out of four animals showed low levels of neutralizing antibodies against the inoculated virus. These results suggested that the UR strain, but not the AM strain, infected young BALB/c mice through \u201cnatural\u201d routes, including the oral and nasal mucosa.",

Neither strain caused severe neurological manifestations, such as paralysis or fatal encephalitis, in neonatal or young mice. Neonatal ddY mice intracerebrally inoculated with the UR strain showed poor (but not fatal) weight gain, and neonatal ddY mice intracerebrally inoculated with the AM strain showed mild clinical signs, such as tremors; however, these signs were minor and transient. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that both SAFV-3 isolates infected glial cells, but not large pyramidal neurons, in neonatal mice. However, histopathological investigation revealed that both strains induced an aseptic meningitis (lasting at least 3 weeks) in the brains of neonatal mice after intracerebral or intraperitoneal inoculation; thus both SAFV-3 strains were mildly neuropathogenic, neurotropic, and neurovirulent in neonatal ddY mice. There were some differences between the two SAFV-3 strains in terms of infectivity and cell tropism in the murine neonatal model. For instance, the ependymal cells and mucosal epithelia of the oral cavity and the tooth germ in neonatal mice were infected following intracerebral infection with the UR, but not the AM, strain. In addition, the UR strain infected the mucosa in young mice following intranasal or oral inoculation; thus this animal model recapitulates the potential infectivity of the UR strain observed in human upper respiratory tract infections. Therefore, both the neonatal and young mouse models will be useful for future studies aimed at elucidating the pathogenesis of different SAFV-3 strains.",

            "text": "The present study highlights the similarities and differences between SAFV-3 and other cardioviruses. Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) is a common enteric pathogen in mice and causes poliomyelitis-like flaccid paralysis and a chronic progressive white matter-demyelinating disease, which is considered a relevant viral infection model of human multiple sclerosis [51\u201353]. Neurovirulent strains of TMEV mainly infect the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and spinal cord after experimental inoculation [54\u201356]. Virus-mediated neurological disorders are caused by direct lytic infection of neurons and oligodendroglia and by secondary immune-mediated destruction of infected cells [57]. We found that the UR-inoculated neonatal mice intracerebrally showed foci of demyelination with microglia infiltrations in the spinal cord on day 21 p.i. This seems to be an early phase of demyelination after viral infection, which is likely to be due to TMEV infection. However, SAFV-3 infected adult mice did not show any lesion associated with demyelinating disease. Interestingly, the SAFV-3 strains examined herein were neurotropic for glial cells in the cerebellum but not for oligodendroglia; however, no study has reported a similar tropism for TMEV [54]. Additionally, there is no evidence for an association between SAFV and human multiple sclerosis [13, 58]. The pathological process of demyelination may be different between SAFV and TMEV. In the present study, SAFV-3 infected the pancreas of young mice after intraperitoneal inoculation. Another cardiovirus, Encephalomyocarditis virus, also infects the pancreas of mice and causes type 1 diabetes [3, 5]; thus, SAFV-3 may have the potential to induce diabetes in mice. Similar to other murine enteric cardioviruses, the UR strain infected young mice via the mucosal route. Therefore, this mucosal infection model may mimic SAFV infection in humans and prove useful for furthering our understanding of the pathogenesis of SAFV. However, the routes of viral infection following oral and intranasal inoculation remain unclear.",

            "text": "The difference between the two SAFV-3 strains in terms of their ability to infect epithelial cells and neurons in the cerebellum may be related to the specific receptors used, or to factors that affect viral replication. Although the AM and UR strains differed by only a single amino acid in the VP2 protein; there were seven amino acid differences in the non-structural proteins (L, 2A, 2C, 3B, 3C, and 3D). The capsid protein of cardioviruses contains four loop structures, loops I and II in VP1, and puffs A and B in VP2, all of which are involved in receptor binding [13, 59, 60]. The leader protein of TMEV plays an important role in viral replication by inhibiting alpha/beta interferon production [61, 62] and inducing apoptosis [63, 64]. It also plays a role in neurovirulence [65]. In the present study, the AM and UR strains differed in terms of virus replication and induction of type 1 IFN expression in infected mice. The dissimilarity in the amino acid sequences of the two SAFV-3 isolates may have contributed to the observed differences in tissue tropism, viral replication, and type 1 IFN expression in the two mouse models. Notably, the expression of type 1 IFN in the cerebellum of AM-inoculated young mice was significantly greater than that in UR-inoculated mice. This discrepancy could be related to differences in cell tropism in these mice.",

Nielsen et al. detected SAFV in the CSF and fecal samples from a 16-month-old child suffering from monosymptomatic ataxia caused by cerebellitis [35]. The neural signs, fluctuating from an insecure gait to walking into things and falling, remitted completely without sequelae during the next 2 months. In the present study, AM-inoculated neonatal mice showed neurological signs such as ataxia, rolling, and elevated tails on Days 7 and 8 p.i.; these mice also recovered rapidly. Interestingly, viral antigens were detected in glial cells in the cerebellum (aka Bergmann glia) but not in neural (Purkinje) cells. Bergmann glia and Purkinje cells, which construct glial microdomains, interact with growing neurites [66]. Cerebellar ataxia is generally thought to be caused by the loss of Purkinje cells. Therefore, we speculate that the SAFV-infected Bergmann glia in the present study affected the function of the Purkinje cells, leading to the cerebellar ataxia observed in neonatal mice.",

The present in vivo comparative study using virological, pathological, and immunological methods to examine the effects of clinical viral isolates has further elucidated the pathogenesis of SAFV.
