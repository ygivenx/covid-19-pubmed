The important clinical impact of HAdV infections in immunosuppressed patients is well documented2\u20135. Additionally, although the incidence of HAdV in immunocompetent individuals with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) appears to be low, the current availability of molecular techniques of diagnosis has allowed the identification of HAdV as an important etiologic agent of both occasional cases and outbreaks of CAP in healthy individuals6\u20139. Unfortunately, currently there are not approved antiviral drugs to specifically treat HAdV infections and the clinically available broad-spectrum antivirals show no satisfactory therapeutic response in terms of efficacy or safety against HAdV infections10.",

We next evaluated the ability of these salicylanilide drugs to block HAdV genome accessibility to the nucleus by the quantification of HAdV genomes isolated from the nucleus22. As reflected in Fig. 6a, only NIC and RAF showed a significant block in the accessibility of HAdV genomes to the nucleus (Fig. 6a). The DNA copy number of the cellular gene GAPDH was also evaluated in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm as a control for the purity of nuclear isolation (data not shown).

A549 cells were infected with HAdV and incubated for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C. Then, the unbound virions were washed-out and cell cultures were incubated for 24 h. HAdV DNA was extracted at that point to limit the interference caused by subsequent rounds of infection occurring 32\u201336 h post-infection23. We used quantitative PCR to quantify in a single round of infection the synthesis of new HAdV DNA copies as a measure of DNA replication efficiency. The presence of OXY (25 \u03bcM) significantly inhibited HAdV5 DNA replication by more than 50% (p < 0.05, Dunnett\u2019s Multiple Comparison test), whilst the quantification of the DNA copies of the GAPDH gene did not showed a significant effect (Fig. 6b). This reduction in the HAdV DNA copy number at the nucleus in the presence of OXY implicated two alternatives for its mechanism of action: i) OXY could inhibit HAdV DNA replication by interfering with a protein required in this process like HAdV DNA polymerase, DNA binding protein (DBP) or terminal protein (TP) or, alternatively, ii) OXY could impact transcription of the HAdV immediate early gene E1A, which is a key step before DNA replication. To assay the inhibition of HAdV mRNA transcription, we infected A549 cells in the presence of OXY (25 \u03bcM) for 6 h. After the infection, we quantified the RNA copy number of the E1A gene using quantitative reverse transcription (RT-PCR). As shown in Fig. 6c, OXY exerted a significant decrease in the E1A mRNAs copy number compared with the control treated with DMSO.",

Moreover, we included in our evaluation other two chlorinated salicylanilide anthelmintic derivatives approved for animal use, OXY and RAF, because of their closely related structure and mechanism of action with NIC. It is well-known that these drugs act as uncouplers of the oxidative phosphorylation, involving dissipation of the membrane potential28. In case of NIC, Jurgeitr et al.14 previously demonstrated that its antiviral mechanism of action was specifically associated with the neutralization of the endosomal pH, thus showing a broad antiviral activity against pH-dependent viruses. Although HAdV endosomal escape is not exclusively dependent of pH, a low pH has proven to be associated with the endosomal escape of HAdV20,29. With these premises, we initially assumed a probable common anti-HAdV mechanism of action for these three drugs and decided to characterize their anti-HAdV activity as a previous step before the evaluation of their safety and efficacy in the Syrian hamster model of HAdV infection.",

To put this data into perspective, it is noteworthy that the reported IC50 values for cidofovir, the drug of choice for the treatment of HAdV infections, are higher than those shown by these three salicylanilide drugs30,31. In addition, following our own methodologies, the IC50 value for cidofovir was 24.06 \u00b1 5.9 \u00b5M, significantly higher than the values obtained for the three salicylanilide drugs. As for their mechanism of action, the data obtained from this work demonstrates that one of these three closely-related drugs did not share the expected mode of action. We have confirmed in our work that NIC, and as a novelty RAF, acts to decrease the number of HAdV genomes associated with the host nucleus, however, as demonstrated by our physiologic assay using the ribotoxin \u03b1-sarcin NIC and RAF may act in a later step after HAdV endosomal escape. Unlike NIC and RAF, OXY did not inhibit the access of HAdV genomes to the nucleus. This observation was confirmed in their time-course assay where we found that, for NIC and RAF inhibition occurred at earliest times of the HAdV replicative cycle than for OXY as well as in the western-blot assay at 6 hpi that showed higher inhibition of the E1A gene expression for NIC and RAF. As shown by our results, the high inhibition in the HAdV DNA replication generated by OXY may be the consequence of the previous and significant inhibition of the E1A gene transcription, which is supported by our results showing a clear inhibition of the E1A transcription at 6 hpi, both by quantitative real-time PCR and by western-blot. It is well known that prior to HAdV DNA replication, transcription of E1A by cellular RNA polymerase II takes place from the E1A promoter32. Then, E1A protein promotes its own transcription and is needed for the subsequent expression of the early genes E1B, E2, E3 and E4 from different promoters as well as for DNA replication and that is probably why we observed that significant inhibition on HAdV DNA replication. The existence of different mechanisms for the antiviral activity of these three drugs is supported by the significant combinatory index values obtained using the CalcuSyn software for all the drug combinations (Table 2). The three anthelmintic drugs showed a moderate synergistic to a strong synergistic activity when they were combined in pairs, which was especially strong at all the levels of inhibition evaluated for the NIC-OXY combination. Likewise, using the combination of the three of them they showed a strong synergistic activity at all the levels of inhibition evaluated.",

For OXY, high serum concentrations ranging from 12.26 \u00b5M to 41.69 \u00b5M have been reported in sheep and goats after a single oral dose of 15 mg/kg44. In the case of RAF, an intravenous single dose of 10 mg/kg in goats generated serum concentrations ranging from 2.8 \u00b5M to 139.98 \u00b5M registered at 0.08 h and 12 h, respectively45. After a single oral dose of 22.5 mg/kg also in goats, the maximum serum concentrations obtained were 49.33 \u00b5M and 21.40 \u00b5M at 36 h and 168 h, respectively45. In both cases, OXY and RAF serum concentrations are significantly higher than their IC50 for HAdV (Table 1). As for their toxicity, LD50 of RAF has been reported to be higher than 2,000 mg/kg of body weight in rats while for OXY, according to the European Medicines Agency (EMEA), this LD50 would be higher than 3,000 mg/kg of body weight (also in rats)46.",

Our findings support the evaluation of these three drugs in the Syrian hamster model of HAdV infection to evaluate their efficacy and safety. The pharmacokinetic profile of these salicylanilide drugs showing low water solubility and oral bioavailability may hamper its further clinical development39. In this situation, the generation of derivatives of these salicylanilide drugs based on rational chemical approaches may improve their poor pharmacokinetics, increasing their solubility and bioavailability as potential clinical candidates for antiviral therapy.",
