New species of human virus are still being identified, at a rate of three or four per year (see below), and viruses make up over two-thirds of all new human pathogens [2], a highly significant over-representation given that most human pathogen species are bacteria, fungi or helminths. These new viruses differ wildly in their importance, ranging from the rare and mild illness due to Menangle virus to the devastating public health impact of HIV-1.",

First, we describe and analyse temporal, geographical and taxonomic patterns in the discovery of human viruses (\u00a72). We then consider the processes by which new human viruses emerge (\u00a73). There are a number of definitions of \u2018emergence\u2019 [3]; here, we are interested in all stages of the process by which a virus shifts from not infecting humans at all to becoming a major human pathogen. As experiences with HIV-1 and new variants of influenza A (and also with novel animal pathogens such as canine parvovirus [4]) show, this shift can occur rapidly, over time scales of decades, years or even months.",

Moreover, we recognize that \u2018species\u2019 itself is an imprecise designation, especially for viruses such as influenza A where different serotypes can have very different epidemiologies and health impacts. Indeed, the demarcation between genus, species complex, species and serotype (or other designations of sub-specific variation) can be somewhat arbitrary.

We know that there are greater than 200 viruses at least at level 2 (see \u00a72a). We do not have a good estimate of the total species diversity of mammalian and avian viruses; however, we can get an indirect indication of the magnitude of the barrier between level 1 and level 2. It has been reported elsewhere (R. Critchlow 2010, personal communication) that of the virus species known to infect domestic animals (livestock and companion animals)\u2014to which humans are presumably routinely exposed\u2014roughly one-third are also capable of infecting humans. The species barrier exists: but it is clearly very leaky. Based on data from [25], roughly 50 per cent of the viruses that can infect humans can also be transmitted by humans (level 3), and roughly 50 per cent of those are sufficiently transmissible that R0 may exceed one (level 4). That a significant minority of (mammalian or avian) viruses should be capable of extensive spread within human populations (or of rapidly becoming so [35]) is consistent with experience: there are several examples within the past hundred years alone (HIV-1, SARS, plus variants of influenza A) and many more in the past few millennia (e.g. measles, mumps, rubella, smallpox). It is noteworthy that the \u2018shape\u2019 of the pathogen pyramid for viruses is very different to that for other kinds of pathogen (bacteria, fungi, protozoa or helminths), of which much smaller fractions are capable of extensive spread in human populations (data from [25]). The most straightforward explanation for this is the much more rapid evolution of viruses (especially RNA viruses), allowing them to adapt to a new (human) host much more quickly than other kinds of pathogen.",

First, humans are constantly exposed to a huge diversity of viruses, though those of others mammals (and perhaps birds) are of greatest importance. Moreover, these viruses are very genetically diverse and new genotypes, strains and species evolve rapidly (over periods of years or decades). A fraction of these viruses (both existing and newly evolved) are capable of infecting humans. It is not clear whether some of these human-infective viruses will already be capable of reaching higher levels of the pathogen pyramid\u2014so-called \u2018off-the-shelf\u2019 pathogens\u2014or whether subsequent evolution of their ability to infect and transmit from humans is usually required\u2014\u2018tailor-made\u2019 [31]. The distinction is potentially important as it implies different determinants of the rate of emergence of viruses with epidemic or pandemic potential: for off-the-shelf pathogens this rate is largely driven by the rate of human contact with a diversity of virus genotypes (possibly rare genotypes) within the non-human reservoir (i.e. ecology); for tailor-made viruses, the key variable is likely to be the rate of genetic adaptation within the new human host (i.e. evolution) [35].",

Whether this process will eventually slow down or stop (if the bulk of new virus species constitute extant diversity) or whether it will continue indefinitely (if a significant proportion of newly discovered virus species are newly evolved) remains unclear, although this makes little difference to immediate expectations. There is a hint, from the slower accumulation of new virus families found in humans, that virus diversity may be bounded, but that does not preclude there being a much larger number of virus species \u2018out there\u2019 than we are currently aware of. If anthropogenic drivers of this process are important then it is possible that we are in the midst of a period of particularly rapid virus emergence and, in any case, with the advent of new virus detection technologies, we are very likely to be entering a period of accelerated virus discovery. The unavoidable conclusion is that we must anticipate the emergence and/or discovery of more new human viruses in the coming years and decades. By no means all of these will pose a serious risk to public health but, if the recent past is a reliable guide to the immediate future, it is very likely that some will.",

This topic has been widely discussed in recent years [10,41], but we will re-iterate a few key points here. Firstly, emerging viruses are everyone's problem: the ease with which viruses can disperse, potentially worldwide within days, coupled with the very wide geographical distribution of emergence events [9], means that a coordinated, global surveillance network is essential if we are to ensure rapid detection of novel viruses. This immediately highlights the enormous national and regional differences in detection capacity, with the vast majority of suitable facilities located in Europe or North America. Secondly, reporting of unusual disease events is patchy, even once detected, reflecting both governance issues and lack of incentives [10]. Thirdly, we need to consider extending the surveillance effort to other mammal populations as well as humans, because these are the most likely source of new human viruses.",

A better understanding of the emergence of new human viruses as a biological and ecological process will allow us to refine our currently very crude notions of the kinds of pathogens, or the kinds of circumstances, we should be most concerned about, and so direct our efforts at detection and prevention more efficiently.",
