            "text": "Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) significantly impact the health of children worldwide. Though the pathogens causing ARIs vary geographically and by season, globally viruses play a major role [1\u20133]. In a recent systematic review, the most common respiratory viruses causing acute lower respiratory tract infection (LRI) in children under five years of age were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus (IFV), parainfluenza virus (PIV) human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and rhinovirus (RV) [1]. Besides this, 10%\u201350% of children affected with ARI develop secondary bacterial infections, namely, acute otitis media, sinusitis, or pneumonia [4]. Moreover, viruses are the most common pathogen associated with severe respiratory diseases (e.g., bronchiolitis), exacerbation of asthma, or pneumonia in early life and are leading cause of hospitalization in children under two [5\u20137]. Although viral etiology of ARIs and their impact on health care are much studied in developed countries, there is a gap in knowledge regarding the same in developing countries including India [8]. From the public health point of view, it is important to know the most common viral agents causing ARIs, their manifestations, how often they cause severe disease, and how severe ARIs can be prevented. In this study, we aimed to characterize the viral spectrum and pattern of upper and lower ARIs in children under five from eastern part of India.",

WHO classification of acute respiratory tract infection in children presenting with cough, difficult breathing, or both is as follows: pneumonia\u2014respiratory rate per minute >50 breaths (2\u201311 months of age) or >40 breaths (12\u201359 months of age); no lower chest indrawing; severe pneumonia\u2014symptoms of pneumonia, and lower chest indrawing with or without rapid breathing; very severe disease\u2014symptoms of severe pneumonia, inability to drink, convulsions, central cyanosis, being abnormally sleepy or difficulty to wake, stridor in calm child, or clinically severe malnutrition. Those with suspected bacterial etiology (e.g., streptococcal sore throat, lobar pneumonia, pneumatocele, and empyema), underlying chronic conditions, HIV, illness lasting more than a week, severe malnutrition, and those hospitalized in last one month were excluded. The Institute Ethics Committee approved the study. Written informed consent was obtained from the parents/legal guardians.",

Then the samples were transported over ice to the laboratory (Regional Medical Research Centre, ICMR) situated at Bhubaneswar, a Grade 1 equipped virological laboratory [10]. Samples were kept there in \u221280\u00b0C until further processing. Total nucleic acids (including DNA and RNA) were extracted from 200 \u03bcL of each specimen using a QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON, Canada) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For all collected specimens, PCR or RT-PCRs were performed to detect infection with RSV, IFV, PIV, hMPV, adenovirus (ADV), human bocavirus (hBoV), human corona virus (hCoV), enterovirus (EV), and RV. The method used for each virus is described in the following references: PIVs 1\u20134, EV, RV [8], IFV (A, B, and C), and RSV (A and B) [11] were detected by two multiplex nested RT-PCRs; hCoV [12] and hMPV [13] by two-step RT-PCR; ADV [14] by single-step PCR; and hBoV by touchdown PCR [15]. RT-PCR was performed using a SuperScript II one-step RT-PCR Platinum Taq kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). PCR was performed using ExTaq polymerase (Takara, Otsu, Japan). All products underwent electrophoresis in 2% agarose gel. Typing for IFV, PIV, and RSV was performed according to PCR product size.",

The most common viruses isolated from acute LRI cases were RSV (32.4%), IFV-A (19.6%), ADV (18.6%), and RV (15.7%). Most cases occurred in the month of January, December, and August. In URIs, the most common age group affected was >12\u201360 mo, and in LRIs, the most common age group affected was 2\u201312 mo.",

In the study by Broor et al., RSV, IFV-A, and PIV-3 were important causes of ARI in children under five in the rural Indian community [8]. In the study by Singh et al., RSV was the most frequently detected virus (21.3%) from hospitalised children presenting as ALRI followed by IFV (9.0%), measles (8.5%), and ADV (5.3%) [16]. In the study by Bharaj et al., RSV was the most frequently detected virus (58.1%) from hospitalised children presenting as ALRI followed by PIV (22%), hMPV (10.5%), and IFV-A (9.3%) [17]. In the study by Maitreyi et al., RSV was the most frequently detected virus (17%) from hospitalised children presenting as ALRI followed by IFV (14.5%), PIV (11.5%), and ADV (1.5%) [18]. In the study by Yeolekar et al., RSV was the most frequently detected virus (26%) from hospitalised children presenting as ALRI followed by IFV (5.4%), PIV (2.07%), and ADV (0.8%) [19]. Panda et al. recently found RV as the most frequently detected pathogen (24.7%) followed by RSV (4.22%), PIV (2.11%), and hMPV (2.11%) in children with ARI from Eastern India [20]. In the present study, we found RV as the second most important agent to RSV causing ARI in young infants and children. The present study findings are more or less similar to the recently published studies from other parts of the globe, though the most prevalent virus may be different [21\u201327].",

Similar was finding by previous studies [8, 16, 17]. Infants <12 mo age were most commonly positive for RSV and less commonly for IFV, the latter occurring commonly beyond infancy in older children. This is because maternal antibody protection against RSV during infancy remains questionable, and as the child grows, the immunity builds up against RSV due to repeated exposures [28]. IFV due to marked antigenic diversity evades the herd immunity and does not give long lasting immunity. Therefore, the susceptibility to IFV increases as the child grows [29]. ADV is uncommon during first six months, where maternal antibody confers protection [30].",

Most of the studies report increased incidence of acute respiratory infection (both URI and LRI) during winter and fall season [20\u201327]. This is because of the following sequence of events: decrease in air temperature causing decrease in the nasal airway temperature (compromised cooling of the nasal airway) leading to poor defence against infection (because of decrease mucociliary clearance and phagocytosis) [31]. In the present study, the incidence of both URI and LRI was higher in winter season (as upper airway acts as an entry point to lower airway). However, an additional peak of acute LRI was also found during August. Though this cannot be solely explained based on the above hypothesis, it may be because of an increase in the birth cohort during this period [32].",
