            "text": "As pathogenic hijackers of cellular machinery, viruses enter target cells via diverse, complex, and still fairly enigmatic processes that are presumed to be cell type dependent. It is widely accepted that viruses access a target cell\u2019s interior via interactions between viral envelope glycoproteins and host cell surface receptors. Such glycoprotein: receptor interactions function in attachment and binding at the cell surface, successive internalization (uptake into the host cell), membrane fusion, and trafficking of the virus [1]. The virus entry process is generally studied by methods such as Western blotting, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and imaging techniques using a selection of both permissive and non-permissive cells. Such studies have enlightened us as it pertains to the mechanism by which different viruses interact with receptor molecules on the surface of cells and get internalized in an effort to set up a successful infection. Several viruses, including herpesviruses utilize different modes of endocytosis to enter cells. Over the years, we have gathered scores of literature on how viruses enter cells by endocytosis primarily via the use of inhibitors of these specific pathways. However, there is dearth of knowledge as to exactly how viruses utilizing the endocytic route are trafficked within the endosomes.",

Thus, a subcellular fractionation protocol was established in our laboratory to directly study the transit of virus within the endosomes in human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cells. Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), a gamma-2-herpesvirus otherwise known as human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8), served as our model viral candidate during the standardization process, as KSHV has been demonstrated to enter HFF cells via clathrin mediated endocytosis; the most extensively studied and best characterized mechanism of endocytosis [2, 3].",

            "text": "KSHV has an expansive cellular tropism both in vivo and in vitro, and can infect a plethora of different cell types [4] presumably due to its ability to bind ubiquitous molecules expressed on target cells such as heparan sulfate (HS) [5]. KSHV binding to HS is thought to bring the virus in closer proximity to target cells such that perhaps more meaningful interactions with other receptor molecules, such as integrins [6], can occur to promote the actual entry process [5]. In fact, KSHV sets precedence as the first herpesvirus shown to interact with adherent target cell integrins in a step initiating the entry process [7]. Integrins are heterodimeric cell adhesion receptors composed of non-covalently associated \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits [8]. To facilitate virus entry and infection, KSHV envelope associated glycoprotein B (gB) is shown to interact with integrins via its two distinct integrin recognition motifs: (1) RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp), the major integrin binding motif and minimal peptide region known to interact with subsets of integrins [7, 9]; and (2) disintegrin-like domain (DLD), the lesser studied and highly conserved integrin recognition motif that binds integrins RGD-independently [10\u201312]. A multitude of studies have implicated KSHV gB interactions with RGD-binding integrins, \u03b13\u03b21, \u03b1V\u03b23, and \u03b1V\u03b25, as valuable for infectious virus entry [7, 13\u201315]. However, both RGD and non-RGD-binding integrins are believed to aid equally in virus entry [16]. For instance, recent studies by us [10] identified KSHV gB interactions with cell surface expressed integrin \u03b19\u03b21, a DLD-binding integrin, crucial to promoting viral infection of cells [10]. Aside from integrins, other receptors shown to have a role in KSHV entry are ephrin receptor tyrosine kinase A2 (EphA2) [17], dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) [18], and human cystine/glutamate exchange transporter system x\u2013c (xCT) [1]. After binding to receptors (i.e. proteins, carbohydrates, or lipids), the vast majority of viruses utilize endocytic routes to enter target cells [19].",

Fractions 1\u20133 contained the LEs with the majority being concentrated in fraction 1 as detected by Rab7 and LAMP1 expression. Fractions 4\u20136 contained the EEs with the majority being concentrated in fraction 5 as detected by Rab5 and EEA1 expression (Fig. 2A). To exclude possible contamination of the fractions with other cellular components, nuclear marker histone H3 [24] served as a negative control (Fig. 2A); gradient fractions are void of nuclei which are totally removed during the post-homogenization centrifugation step [25]. Notably, comparatively assessing the density profile of collected gradient fractions 1\u20136 from both uninfected and KSHV infected HFF cells by refractometric analysis revealed that KSHV infection of HFF cells did not alter floating density of the endosome containing gradient fractions (data not shown), nor did KSHV infection of HFF cells seem to alter fraction distribution of early and late endosomes (Fig. 2A). LEs (sometimes referred to as pre-lysosomes [26], lysosomes, and the endolysosome hybrid organelle\u2014from where mature lysosomes bud\u2014are said to be difficult to distinguish [27], as basic sucrose gradient centrifugation procedures are shown to forgo total separation of such organelles [28]. Here, acid phosphatase (an established enzyme marker for identifying lysosomes in subcellular fractions; [29]) activity was analyzed to detect the level of lysosome enrichment in collected gradient fractions (Fig. 2B). Upon fraction comparison, acid phosphatase activity in both the uninfected and KSHV infected HFF cells was detected in fractions 1\u20133 with fraction 1 displaying the highest phosphatase activity. Activity of acid phosphatase foreseeably coincided with the LE fractions (fractions 1\u20133; Fig. 2A); although acid hydrolases (e.g. acid phosphatase) majorly localize in lysosomes, these enzymes can be found in LEs as well [27]. Therefore, such findings provide even further evidence for the presence of LEs in the said fractions.",

            "text": "Having established the fractions that contain early and late endosomes, we purified endosomes via a sucrose flotation gradient to quantitatively track KSHV in infected HFF cells post-internalization and to characterize possible role(s) for DLD-binding integrins during this stage of the entry process via qPCR (Figs. 1, 2C). Earlier studies described KSHV entry as a rapid process wherein the capsid delivers the genetic material to the nucleus allowing eventual expression of viral transcripts in as early as 30 min post infection (PI) [30, 31]. Here, we monitored KSHV particles in endosomes 30 min PI. In the case of cells infected with KSHV, there was notably more KSHV DNA detected in EE containing fractions compared to the fractions containing LEs (Fig. 2C). Similar results were observed in cells infected with a mixture of KSHV and BSA (Fig. 2C). Though incubating soluble integrin \u03b19\u03b21 with KSHV did not significantly alter the levels of KSHV in EEs, it significantly impeded the ability of KSHV to escape the LEs (Fig. 2C). These results suggest a possible role for \u03b19\u03b21 integrin in virus-mediated endosomal escape. Additionally, infection in the presence of our positive control, heparin, results in a significant drop in the number of virus particles observed in both EE and LE containing fractions (Fig. 2C). Notably, pre-treatment of KSHV with soluble heparin is shown to impede the initial attachment of the virus to HS on the cell surface [32], thus blocking binding, signal induction, entry, and efficient infection of target cells [5, 33]. Based on these results, as it pertains to HFF cells, we presume KSHV to be a late penetrating virus that exits from the LE into the cytosol. We could not detect HSV-2 in either the early or late endosome (data not shown), as earlier studies demonstrated HSV-2 to enter target cells via fusion at the cell membrane [20].",

Expression of TRI-1 is ideal for detection of the virus, as the virus envelope is lost upon fusion/penetration. At 1 min post KSHV infection, significantly more virus was observed in EE containing fractions 4\u20136 versus LE fractions with most virus being detected in fraction 5 (Fig. 3). Similar patterns were observed at 1 min PI when the virus was incubated with BSA or soluble \u03b19\u03b21 (Fig. 3). Incubating KSHV with heparin lowered the percentage of virus being internalized as detected by limited staining for TRI-1 in EEs (Fig. 3). By 5 min PI, a significant portion of the virus had reached LEs in KSHV infected cells or cells infected with a mixture of KSHV that was incubated with BSA or \u03b19\u03b21 (Fig. 3). Heparin blocked KSHV internalization effectively as described at 1 min PI. By 30 min PI, there was a marked drop in the levels of virus in LEs (especially LE fraction 1) in cells that were infected with KSHV or a mixture of KSHV and BSA (Fig. 3). Surprisingly, we found an increase in the levels of virus associated with LEs of cells that were infected with a mixture of KSHV and soluble \u03b19\u03b21. Overall, Western blotting results monitoring TRI-1 expression as an indicator of KSHV in collected gradient fractions of virus infected HFF cells (Fig. 3) mimic qPCR results (Fig. 2C), thus confirming escape of KSHV from the LE to the cytoplasm in HFF cells.",

            "text": "For further confirmation, we employed the traditional method of immunofluorescence imaging with FITC-KSHV and TRITC labeled antibodies to Rab5 and Rab7 to monitor the trafficking of KSHV into the target cells. By as early as 1 min PI of cells, KSHV was associated with EEs as observed by co-localization of the FITC-KSHV with Rab5 expression (Fig. 4a). Treating cells with antibodies to \u03b19\u03b21 or pre-immune IgGs did not significantly alter this co-localization (Fig. 4a). At 30 min PI, a fraction of KSHV was associated with LEs as observed by co-localization of the FITC-KSHV with Rab7 expression (Fig. 4b). A similar result was observed when the cells were treated with pre-immune IgGs (Fig. 4b). However, the number of co-localizing events substantially increased when the cells were treated with antibodies to \u03b19\u03b21 prior to infection (Fig. 4b). For further authentication, subsequent intracellular trafficking of KSHV upon cytosolic delivery (post-late endosomal penetration) was similarly analyzed via immunofluorescence microscopy using KSHV and antibodies directed against minor capsid protein TRI-1 (Fig. 5). By 30 min PI, KSHV was shown to accumulate at the perinuclear region as observed by TRI-1 positive viral capsids (similar results were observed in cells treated with pre-immune IgGs) (Fig. 5A, B). However, when cells were treated with antibodies against integrin subunits (\u03b19 or \u03b21), a substantial reduction in perinuclear TRI-1 expression corresponding to KSHV nucleocapsids was observed (Fig. 5A, B). This reduction in the number of capsids positive for TRI-1 was not observed when the cells were treated with antibodies to integrin subunit \u03b15 (Fig. 5A, B). Anti-integrin \u03b15 antibodies which have no effect on KSHV entry and infection [10, 14] served as a negative control (Fig. 5A, B). Thus, these results clearly denote the ability of antibodies against integrin subunits (\u03b19 or \u03b21) to block virus infection by preventing the escape of KSHV from LEs. Overall, we conclude virus:\u03b19\u03b21 interactions to play a key role in trafficking of KSHV via endosomes to eventually escape into the cytoplasm.",

            "text": "Receptors are considered necessary cell surface molecules instrumental for successful virus infection [34]. Herpesvirus entry occurs via viral glycoprotein engagement of target cell receptor molecules. Those receptors considered valuable for KSHV entry into HFF cells are binding receptor, HS, RGD-binding integrins (\u03b13\u03b21, \u03b1V\u03b23, \u03b1V\u03b25; [5, 7, 14, 35]), and DLD-binding \u03b19\u03b21 integrin [10]. In particular, integrins are known to alter different stages of the virus entry process. Much work has been done to establish a role for RGD-binding integrins in regulating KSHV infectious entry. Specifically, RGD of KSHV gB functionally interacts with integrins \u03b13\u03b21, \u03b1V\u03b23, and \u03b1V\u03b25 that have a role in the initial internalization of the virus [5, 7, 14, 35]. However, very little is known about the role of DLD-binding integrins during the initial stages of KSHV infection. Employing subcellular fractionation to assess endosomal trafficking of KSHV, the present study, for the first time, deciphers a role for DLD-binding \u03b19\u03b21 integrin in regulating KSHV entry.",

These findings have taken our current knowledge of KSHV entry a step further, delineating yet another dynamic role for integrins in a post-internalization stage of KSHV infection of HFF cells. Notably, a previous study by Schornberg et al. also provides evidence that viruses utilize integrins for regulation of virus entry at steps beyond binding and initial internalization to promote virus penetration from endocytic organelles. Specifically, they suggest that cell surface integrin expression mediates virus entry at this post-internalization step via controlling endosomal cathepsins (proteases found in endosomes that mediate intracellular proteolysis; [38, 39]). With further studies, we seek to resolve: (1) the role for \u03b19\u03b21 in mediating proteolytic activity within endosomes; and (2) the link between post-internalization virus:integrin interactions and endosomal acidification in supporting a successful virus infection of cells.",
