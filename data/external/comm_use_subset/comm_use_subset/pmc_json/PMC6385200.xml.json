These fears\u2014for perhaps the first time in history\u2014were partially derived from mathematical and computational models, which were developed in near real-time during the outbreak to forecast transmission risk3,4. However, the predictions for SARS failed to match the data3,5. Over the subsequent 15 years, the scientific community developed a rich understanding for how social contact networks, variation in health-care infrastructure, the spatial distribution of prior immunity, etc., drive complex patterns of disease transmission6\u201311, and demonstrated that data-driven, dynamic, and or agent-based models can produce actionable forecasts12\u201317. Additionally, studies have demonstrated that predicting different components of outbreaks\u2014e.g., the expected number of cases, pace, and tempo of cases needing treatment, demand for prophylactic equipment, importation probability, etc.\u2014is feasible3,13,18\u201324. Despite these advances, an ongoing debate continues in the scientific community about both the need and our capacity to forecast outbreaks25,26. What remains an open question is whether the existing barriers to forecasting stem from gaps in our mechanistic understanding of disease transmission and low-quality data or from fundamental limits to the predictability of complex, sociobiological systems, i.e. outbreaks4,6,7,27\u201330.",

However, we find that for most diseases this barrier to prediction is often well beyond the timescale of single outbreaks, implying prediction is likely to succeed. We also find that the forecast horizon varies by disease and demonstrate that both shifting model structures and social network heterogeneity are the most likely mechanisms for the observed differences in predictability across contagions. Our results highlight the importance of moving beyond time-series forecasting, by embracing dynamic modeling approaches to prediction36, and suggest challenges for performing model selection across long disease time series. We further anticipate that our findings will contribute to the rapidly growing field of epidemiological forecasting and may relate more broadly to the predictability of complex adaptive systems.",

However, instead of being based on the probability of observing a system in a particular state, it utilizes the frequency of discrete motifs, i.e symbols, associated with the growth, decay, and stasis of a time series. For example, in a binary time series the permutation entropy in two dimensions would count the frequency of the set of possible ordered pairs, {[01], [10]}, and the Shannon entropy, or uniformity, of this distribution is the permutation entropy. In higher dimensions, one can define an alphabet of symbols over all factorial combinations of orderings in a given dimension, e.g., {[0, 1, 2],[2, 1, 0],[1, 0, 2], etc.}, over which the permutation entropy will be defined. A time series that visits all the possible symbols with equal frequency will have maximal entropy and minimal predictability, and a time series that only samples a few of the possible symbols will instead have lower entropy and hence be more predictable.",

However, the value of Hp should always decline as the embedding dimension d grows, i.e. no minimum value of Hp will exist for finite windows sizes N. To address this issue, we follow Brandmaier38 and exclude all unobserved symbols when calculating Hp, which acts as a penalty against higher dimensions and results in a minimum value of Hp for finite length time series. To control for differences in dimension and for the effect of time-series length on the entropy estimation, we normalize the entropy by log(d!), ensure that each window is greater in length than d!, and confirm that the estimate of Hp has stabilized (specifically that the marginal change in Hp as data are added is <1%). To facilitate interpretation, we present results from continuous intervals by fixing \u03c4 = 1. However, our results generalize to the case where we fix both d and \u03c4 across all diseases and where we minimize over a range of (d,\u03c4) pairs (see Supplementary Figure 4).",

For comparison, we calculate the same moving-window estimate of the permutation entropy for the time series of measles cases in Texas prior to the introduction of the first vaccine. The critical observation is that the moving-window entropy for the measles time series fluctuates between values comparable with that of pure random noise and, at times, values closer to the more predictable periodic signal, which suggests alternating intervals with different dynamical regimes and, thus, predictability. The magnitude of the entropy fluctuations for measles in Texas is statistically significant by permutation test, p < 0.001, as compared with simulated fluctuations obtained by building an estimated multinomial distribution over the symbols and repeatedly calculating the expected Jensen\u2013Shannon (JS) divergence from simulations.",

After re-normalizing time for each disease by its corresponding R0 (the average number of secondary infections a pathogen will generate during an outbreak epidemic when the entire population is susceptible, very large, and is seeded with a single infectious individual)\u2014we used the mean of all reported values found in a literature review (see Supplementary Table 1)\u2014we find that the best-fit mixed-effect slope on a log scale is 1 and that the residual effect is well predicted by the times series\u2019 embedding dimension d (see Supplementary Figures 2 and 3). Moreover, because the embedding dimension d of a time series is the length of the basic blocks used in the calculation of the permutation entropy, it encodes the fundamental temporal unit of predictability in the form of an entropy production rate, thus implying that predictability decreases with time-series data at a disease-specific rate determined to first order by R0, which is further modulated by d. The result that predictability depends on temporal scale also suggests that the permutation entropy could be an approach for justifying the utility of different data sets, i.e. one could determine the optimal granularity of data by selecting the dimension that maximized predictability.",

This observation that Markov chain models of the same embedding order do not reproduce the observed predictability indicates that either the model structure is changing in time and/or the system has a very long memory, which is consistent with our current understanding of the entanglement between mobility and disease3,42.

We consistently observe that predictability decreases after vaccination, again with significance determined by permutation test (Fig. 4a). We also find that the symbol frequency distribution changes significantly after vaccination, as measured by the Jensen\u2013Shannon divergence, across all states in the United States (Fig. 4b). Critically, because\u2014as stated earlier\u2014permutation entropy is not affected by changes in magnitude, the difference in entropy cannot simply be accounted for by a reduction in cases. Instead, it means that the temporal pattern of cases changes after vaccination.

In this model we can control the epidemic threshold and the number of secondary contacts by changing the activity and the number of contacted nodes per activation. We simulated two scenarios, one in which the number of contacted nodes per activation is fixed (regular SAD) and one in which we allow fluctuations in contact number (irregular SAD), which generates fluctuations in the number of secondary infections. For both models, we investigated the predictability from below to above the epidemic or critical transmissibility threshold (set to 1 here). From the resulting epidemic curves, we calculated the permutation entropy. Figure 5a shows that we find the same pattern of decreasing predictability observed in real data with longer time series. Figure 5b shows the predictability obtained for the two scenarios below and above the transition: we see that that the strongest difference is present below the transition, where the lack of peculiar structure (the regular contact pattern) induces lower predictabilities than for heterogeneous contact distributions.

However, across that same body work, researchers typically find that predictions improve when they are trained on longer time series, even for chaotic systems41. Indeed, even for permutation entropy, an active area of research is how spurious aspects of time series can lead to spuriously increasing predictability with increasing time-series lengths37. Our data-driven results suggest that for infectious diseases the opposite is true, more time-series data might often lead to lower predictability. Then, by integrating our biological understanding of each pathogen and simulated outbreaks, we found that changing dynamics, e.g., empirical changes in vaccination coverage and simulated shifts in the number of secondary infections as a disease moves through a heterogeneous social network, can cause the prediction error to increase with increasing data, which is related to earlier findings on the role of airline travel networks and disease forecasting36. What this implies is that different models generate data at different time points and suggests that the optimal coarse-graining of complex systems might change with scale and or time53. The potential for scale-dependent models of infectious disease transmission is supported by a recent analysis of US city-level data on influenza outbreaks that found consistent, mechanistic differences in outbreak dynamics based on city size54.",

Our results demonstrate that outbreaks should be predictable. However, as outbreaks spread\u2014and spatiotemporally separated waves become entangled with the substrate, human mobility, behavioral changes, pathogen evolution, etc.\u2014the system is driven through a space of diverse model structures, driving down predictability despite increasing time-series lengths. Taken together, our results agree with observations that accurate long-range forecasts for complex adaptive systems, e.g., contagions beyond a single outbreak, may be impossible to achieve due to the emergence of entropy barriers. However, they also support the utility and accuracy of dynamical modeling approaches for infectious disease forecasting, especially those that leverage myriad data streams and are iteratively calibrated as outbreaks evolves. Lastly, our results also suggest that cross-validation over long infectious disease time series cannot guarantee that the correct model for any individual window of time will be favored, which would imply a no free lunch theorem57 for infectious disease model selection, and perhaps for sociobiological systems more generally.",

The solid lines indicate the mean value and the shaded region marks the interquartile range across all states and starting locations in the time series. Although the slopes are different for each disease, in all cases, longer time series result in lower predictability. However, most diseases are predictable across single outbreaks and disease time series cluster together, i.e. there are disease-specific slopes on the relationship between predictability and time-series length. To aid in interpretation, the black dashed line plots the median permutation entropy across 20,000 stochastic simulations of a Susceptible Infectious Recovered (SIR) model, as described in the Supplement. This SIR model would be considered predictable, thus values above the black line might be thought of as in-the-range where model-based forecasts are expected to outperform forecasts based solely on statistical properties of the time-series data. The dark brown, dashed vertical line indicates the time period selected for b. In b, the predictability is shown after 4 months, i.e. 16 weeks, of data for each pathogen. The same procedure was used to generate the permutation entropy as in a. The mean predictability differed both by disease and by geographic location, i.e state (analysis of variance with post hoc Tukey honest significant differences test and correction for multiple comparison, sum of squares (SS) disease = 98.22, degrees of freedom (DF) disease = 8, p-value disease < 0.001; SS location = 94.7, DF location = 53, p-value location < 0.001). The solid line represents the median, boxes enclose the 25th to 75th percentiles of the distributions, and whiskers cover the entire distribution",

Although the slopes are different for each disease, in all cases, longer time series, i.e. more data, result in lower predictability. However, we again find that single outbreaks should be predictable and that diseases show a remarkable degree of clustering based on the slope of entropy gain. In this analysis, each dot represents the predictability for an entire state-level time series for a disease, i.e. the window size is the entire time series. b Rescaled time-series length based on the mean published basic reproductive number. Here we plot the log of time normalized by the basic reproductive number, i.e. R0, from the literature (see Supplementary Table 1) against the log of the permutation entropy",

A rolling window estimate of the permutation entropy for weekly measles cases reported to the CDC from the state of Texas between 1927 and 1983 (red dashed line). The vertical blue line indicates when the first measles vaccine was licensed for use in the United States. Shortly after the vaccine was introduced the permutation entropy increased significantly, which is expected after a system experiences a change to its model structure, in this case vaccination. b Permutation entropy detects changing model structure across all states in the United States. The box-plots aggregate the Jensen\u2013Shannon divergences between pairs of windows that are both in the pre-vaccine era (light brown), have one window in the pre- and one in the post-vaccine era (red) and both in the post-vaccine era (dark drown). The Jensen\u2013Shannon divergence of the symbol frequency distribution was calculated between all pairs of rolling 1-year (52 week) windows for measles time series across the United States. The average divergence between symbol distributions was higher between windows in the pre- and post-vaccine era, as compared to windows that were either both in the pre- or both in the post-vaccine era (determined by permutation test and by an analysis of variance that also included state-level differences in the Jensen\u2013Shannon divergence and a Tukey honest significant differences post hoc test, which contained a correction for multiple comparisons).

For each time-series length we randomly select 1000 starting points and find consistent decreases in the permutation entropy for longer time series. The lines (solid, irr.) and (dashed, reg.) represent the smoothed conditional means, i.e. trend, as determined by fitting a generalized additive model with a thin-plate spline penalty. b When considering the uniform (reg., blue) and heterogeneous (irr., brown) scenarios separately, we find that the largest difference in predictability is found below the corresponding epidemic transition consistent with the idea that noisy, sputtering infection trees are harder to predict than the epidemic waves above the transition.
