This is not the first such call for an international ban (Collegium Ramazzini 2010), but it is a significant one because it is endorsed by 10 member organizations of the JPC-SE, numerous major epidemiologic and public health associations, and many epidemiologists (JPC-SE 2012). This position statement also highlights a case of global environmental injustice on a massive scale.",

Asbestos exposure was the number one occupational health problem until its use was banned in most of the developing world (International Ban Asbestos Secretariat 2012). As a legacy of past asbestos use, the number of cases of asbestos-related diseases continues to climb every year across Canada and in many other industrialized countries. Consequently, the countries that used asbestos in the past, such as Canada, the United States, Australia, and countries throughout Europe, have either adopted a legal ban or have virtually ceased using asbestos altogether.",

Therefore, international organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Federation of Public Health Associations, the International Commission on Occupational Health, the International Social Security Association, the International Trade Union Confederation, and the World Bank are unequivocally against the use of asbestos and are also alarmed by its increased use in low- and middle-income countries. An estimated 107,000 people die each year from occupational exposure to asbestos, and > 125 million are exposed to it (WHO 2010). Although asbestos use has been banned in the mostly high-income countries because of its harmfulness, asbestos use is increasing in middle- and low-income countries because of the effective lobbying of the asbestos industry to prevent policies that ban asbestos use; there is also a profound absence of education and awareness about asbestos\u2019 harms in the countries using it the most.",

Much like the tobacco industry, the asbestos industry hires consultants to promote scientific arguments in its favor and to manufacture doubt (Holmes 2013), and it attacks and threatens with law suits those advocates and scientists who speak out against the hazards of asbestos (Morris and Soares 2011). Recently, the journal Inhalation Toxicology issued an apology for publishing four articles that were commissioned by the asbestos industry and authored by consultants who serve as expert witnesses for the industry and use the articles in their litigations (Inhalation Toxicology 2012). A court deposition regarding the research published in those articles indicated that > $850,000 was paid to one of the consultants and > $7 million dollars was provided to the company that commissioned the studies (Holm 2011).",

One of the most extreme examples of such global injustice is Canada, which discouraged the use of asbestos-containing products in Canada but allowed the export of these same products until September 2012 (JPC-ES 2012). Canada had also been a major global producer of chrysotile asbestos. This presents a double standard: Legislators actively protect their citizens from asbestos-containing products but do not ban the exportation of these deadly products, as if citizens from the less-developed countries are second-class global citizens.",

The Canadian government also promised financial aid to the mining communities to promote economic activities other than asbestos mining (CBC News 2012). However, the Russian government has vested interest in their asbestos industry and is reportedly relying on an ethically controversial research collaboration to veto the ban at the convention (Holmes 2013).",
