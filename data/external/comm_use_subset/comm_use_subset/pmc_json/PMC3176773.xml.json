During the past decade, novel viruses, particularly those causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian influenza A H5N1, have attracted international concern. These diseases represent only part of a rich tapestry of pathogens that have emerged to pose public health threats in recent years. Clearly, there is a pressing need for rapid and accurate identification of viral etiological agents. The development of Next Generation Sequencing (high throughput sequencing) technology provides a possible solution to this problem; indeed several recent studies have used these techniques to identify novel viral agents [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]. Palacios et al. identified a novel and deadly arenavirus by employing 454-pyrosequencing technology, the results of which were later confirmed by PCR [4]. Recent studies, have identified a novel strain of Ebola virus which caused a hemorrhagic fever epidemic in Uganda [6], and dengue virus type 1 (DENV-1) sequences in laboratory reared mosquitoes experimentally infected with DENV-1 [7]. Using de novo next generation sequencing, Makoto Kuroda et al. showed that the etiologic agent identified in a deceased pneumonia patient was, in fact, the pandemic influenza A H1N1 virus, rather than that originally assumed to be pneumococcus [8].",

The sequencing technologies offer distinct advantages over traditional viral detection and surveillance methods that generally require prior knowledge of the etiologic agents, as well as depending on virus-specific primers, probes or antibodies. These traditional techniques are, therefore, unsuitable in situations where the causative agent of an outbreak is entirely novel, or is a pathogen variant with several mutations to key priming regions. Hence, high throughput sequencing techniques provide a powerful new opportunity for surveillance and discovery of novel pathogens. The techniques provide a cost-effective mechanism for massive parallel sequencing generating extreme sequencing depth, whilst providing multiplex analyses for etiologic agent identification.",

Surveillance of infectious agents carried by mosquitoes is important for predicting the risk of vector-borne infectious disease outbreaks. Recently, a new strategy based on small interfering RNA (siRNA) immunity to virus infection was proposed for detecting novel RNA viruses in laboratory reared drosophilae and mosquitoes, as well as RNA/DNA viruses in plants using high throughput sequencing techniques [9], [10]. Prompted by these results (in laboratory reared insects and plants by deep sequencing and assembly of small RNAs isolated from the host organisms), we explored the feasibility of using this approach to identify viruses from wild-caught mosquitoes. Our findings show for the first time that high throughput sequencing of small RNAs can detect both RNA- and DNA viruses in wild-caught insects, thus supporting the feasibility of employing this approach for surveillance purposes.",

Preliminary results revealed that a large number of unique sequences in the Culex pipiens molestus sample shared identity with three other viruses, namely Aedes albopictus Parvovirus (GenBank Accession: X74945), Anopheles gambiae densonucleosis virus (GenBank Accession: EU233812), and Aedes aegypti densovirus strain 0814616 (GenBank Accession: FJ360744). Further analysis demonstrated that the matched A. albopictus Parvovirus sequences were also present in the A. gambiae densonucleosis virus genome and the A. aegypti densovirus strain 0814616 genome. The A. gambiae densonucleosis virus and A. aegypti densovirus strain 0814616 shared most of their matched sequences. Sequence alignment showed that these three viruses exhibited more than 80 percent sequence identity, indicating that a virus with homologous sequences to these three viruses was present within the C. pipiens molestus sample. For the other two samples (C. tritaeniorhynchus and A. sinensis), no significant amount of sequence was found that corresponded to any specific virus. To discover potential novel viruses which may be remotely related to known viruses, a BLAST strategy proposed in the literature [9] was adopted. This strategy employs the tblastx search to ensure identification of viruses based on amino acid sequences. However, this analysis did not reveal any additional viral sequences in any of the three mosquito samples tested.",

The results showed that the small RNA reads overlapped which allowed contig assembly. Of the three viruses, A. gambiae densonucleosis had the most mapped reads (4481) and the longest assembled consensus sequence (3248 bp) which covered 78.5% of the whole genome (4139 bp) (Figure 1 and file S1). The overall similarity between the newly identified virus and the A. gambiae densonucleosis virus was about 98% (3182/3248). The distribution of the lengths of the matched small viral RNAs showed that the majority (>60%) of them were 20\u201324 nt in length, with a peak distribution of 21 nt, while the total library small RNA (majority of them were endogenous siRNA) displayed a peak distribution of 22 nt (Figure 2). This is consistent with the discovery in sindbis infected mosquitoes [11] and virus infected Drosophila OSS cells [9], where the matched viral siRNAs had a peak distribution at 21 nt, while the endogenous siRNA in Drosophila [12], [13] and the total library small RNA in mosquitoes [11] had a peak length of 21\u223c22 nt. Most of the small RNAs distributed along three viral transcripts (e.g. NS1, NS2 and Capsid), with more than 80% of the transcript length covered. The viral small RNA +/\u2212 strand ratio approximated 7\u22361 (3933/548), indicating that these molecules were largely derived from the viral RNA transcripts.

It is interesting to note that no small RNAs were mapped to the untranscribed regions, although large numbers of reads mapped to the four inverted sequences (with a coverage greater than 50\u00d7), but not the direct repeats (Figure 1, Table 3). Sequencing was performed on small RNA fragments, therefore, the fact that no reads mapped to the untranscribed region was not unexpected. The fact that reads mapped to the untranscribed 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 inverted repeat regions indicates that those inverted repeat regions may be transcribed by an unknown mechanism. Since the terminal stem-loop structures are usually involved in viral genome replication, it is possible that transcripts from the stem-loop regions are involved in virus replication (e.g. as primers for genomic DNA synthesis).",

High throughput sequencing of small RNA's (esp. miRNA) has become routine practice, with reliable protocols and readily available reagents. Due to the short length of the small RNA molecules, sequencing is even faster and cheaper than standard high throughput sequencing using longer DNA or RNA fragments. This makes high throughput sequencing of small RNA an attractive method for pathogen detection in plants and insects based on siRNA, an innate defense mechanism of plants and insects [9], [10]. Detection of viruses in laboratory reared insects [9] or experimentally infected mosquitoes have been reported [7]. Our work shows that high throughput sequencing is suitable for detecting viral agents in wild-caught insects.",

This perception is consistent with previous reports where only RNA viruses were identified using small RNA sequencing techniques [7], [9]. However, our work clearly demonstrates that small RNA sequencing can also detect DNA viruses in insects, although the underlying mechanism of the biogenesis of these small RNAs is unclear. Similar findings have been reported in plants [10], but again the mechanism has not been defined. It is possible that plants and insects generate small RNAs from infected DNA viruses differently. Possible mechanisms for small RNA biogenesis from DNA viruses include, for example, the local dsRNA formed in the stem-loop structure of the viral transcripts or overlapping convergent viral transcripts [23], [24]. In the case of densoviruses, there seem to be no overlapping convergent transcripts [25], [26] and no obvious stem-loop structure has been identified in densovirus transcripts.",

These are predicted to form a T- or Y-shaped structure that may participate in genome packaging signaling or replication initiation [26]. It is interesting to note that a longer length direct repeat was located very close to each inverted repeat (Figure 1), but no small RNA mapped onto the direct repeats themselves.

Field trials using a densovirus that infects A. aegypti mosquitoes showed that the virus had significant efficiency, although most densoviruses take 2\u201320 days to kill their insect hosts [29], making this agent unsuitable for commercial use.

            "text": "Traditional generic methods for identifying and characterizing novel viral diseases have included electron microscopy, virus isolation in cell culture, immunological approaches and PCR. Recently technologies such as diagnostic microarrays and mass spectrometry have been proposed as generic tools for identifying viruses [30], but all these methods require some prior knowledge of the agents to be identified. With the advent of next generation high throughput parallel sequencing platforms, the possibility of random metagenomic sequencing of diseased samples with the object of identifying new putative pathogens has emerged [6], [31]. However, elimination of host nucleic acid is critical to boost any pathogen signal toward the detection threshold. In addition, the danger of missing extremely low titer viruses is still a possibility with these systems. By comparison, small RNA sequencing requires neither viral particle purification nor viral nucleic acid sequence amplification. With the advantages of high throughput, high speed, low cost and greatly simplified methodologies, small RNA sequencing can now be used more widely to identify known viruses as well for novel virus discovery.",

Total RNA was extracted separately from the different mosquito species using the Total RNA Purification Kit (LC Sciences, Houston, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The quality of total RNA was analyzed on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer system and by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A small RNA library was generated according to the Illumina sample preparation instructions [33]. Briefly, total RNA samples were size-fractionated on a 15% tris-borate-EDTA-urea polyacrylamide gel. RNA fragments 15\u201350 nt long were isolated, quantified, and ethanol precipitated. The SRA 5\u2032 adapter (Illumina) was ligated to the RNA fragments with T4 RNA ligase (Promega). The ligated RNAs were size-fractionated on a 15% tris-borate-EDTA-urea polyacrylamide gel and 41\u201376 nt long RNA fragments were isolated. Next the SRA 3\u2032 adapter (Illumina) ligation was performed, followed by a second size-fractionation using the same gel conditions as described above. The 64\u201399 nt long RNA fragments were isolated by gel elution and ethanol precipitation. The ligated RNA fragments were reverse transcribed to single-stranded cDNAs using M-MuLV (Invitrogen) with RT-primers (as recommended by Illumina). The cDNAs were amplified with pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) using 20 PCR cycles and the Illumina small RNA primer set. PCR products were purified on a 12% tris-borate-EDTA polyacrylamide gel and a slice of gel containing cDNAs of 80\u2013115 bp was excised. This fraction was eluted and the recovered cDNAs were precipitated and quantified on the Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific) and on the TBS-380 mini-fluorometer (Turner Biosystems) using PicoGreen\u00ae dsDNA quantization reagent (Invitrogen). The concentration of the sample was adjusted to 10 nM and 10 \u00b5L used for the sequencing reaction. The purified cDNA library was used for cluster generation (on the Illumina Cluster Station), and then sequenced on the Illumina GAIIx machine, following the manufacturer's instructions. Raw sequencing reads were obtained using the Illumina Pipeline v1.5 software following sequencing image analysis by the Pipeline Firecrest Module and base-calling by the Pipeline Bustard Module.",
