From its initial recognition in 2012 in Saudi Arabia [3] to August 2019, there have been 2,468 patients with confirmed MERS-CoV infection, including 850 deaths, reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) from 27 countries [4]. Dromedary camels are known to be the source of human infection [5]. The virus is enzootic in dromedaries in the Arabian Peninsula, the Middle East, many regions of Africa, as well as Pakistan and Bangladesh. Over 70% of the global population of infected dromedaries are found in Africa, including Morocco [6,7]. Although travel-associated cases have been reported from several countries, zoonotic MERS cases have only been reported in the Arabian Peninsula and the Middle East [2]. The reasons for the apparent absence of zoonotic MERS in Africa in spite of exposure to virus-infected dromedaries is unclear, but likely because of several factors [2]. This may be owed to genetic and phenotypic differences in virus strains circulating in Africa [8], behavioural factors relating patterns of exposure, or alternatively, that MERS is not being detected because of the assumption that zoonotic MERS does not occur in Africa which may lead to a lack of testing for MERS-CoV.",

Thus far, only a limited number of serological studies have been conducted in people with intense exposure to MERS-CoV-infected camels in Africa. Such studies are, however, important to better understand the geographic extent of MERS-CoV infection in human populations. Camel-exposed abattoir workers in Nigeria had no serological evidence of MERS-CoV infection despite intensive exposure to MERS-CoV infected camels [10]. Similarly, people in contact with camels in Kenya and Egypt had no serological evidence of MERS-CoV infection [11-13]. Another Kenyan study of 1,122 individuals without direct occupational exposure to dromedary camels found two individuals with low levels of neutralising antibody to MERS-CoV; to our knowledge, these are the only known instances of MERS-CoV seropositivity in humans in Africa prior to this study [14].",

The extinction value of the calibrator included in the test defines the upper limit of the reference range in non-infected humans and this value was set as the cut-off. The ELISA was made semi-quantitative by calculating the ratio of the extinction value of the serum sample over the extinction value of the calibrator. The manufacturer recommends cut-off ratios of < 0.8 be interpreted as negative, \u2265 0.8 and < 1.1 as borderline, and \u2265 1.1 as positive. Because subsequent publications suggested a lower ELISA cut-off of ratio \u2265 0.3 for screening purposes for the selection of sera to be confirmed by neutralisation tests, we have also included ELISA optical density (OD) ratios of \u2265 0.3 in our analysis [9].",

It is possible that herders are at lower risk than slaughterhouse workers because camels brought to slaughterhouses often transit via camel markets where mixing of camels from diverse sources allows for amplification of virus circulation which may result in higher rates of virus shedding and greater MERS-CoV exposure of these slaughterhouse workers.",

This is not unexpected as even patients with confirmed MERS-CoV disease do not invariably mount robust neutralising or ELISA antibody titres unless they have severe pneumonia [23,24]. Thus, people with mild infections may have low or undetectable antibody titres to MERS-CoV, and furthermore, such antibody may wane over time. Serology may thus considerably under-estimate extent of mild or asymptomatic MERS-CoV infection, as has been previously suggested [20]. A recent study proposed that supplementing serology with MERS-CoV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses may identify additional individuals who have prior MERS-CoV infection in population based studies [20].",

However, it is not yet known if these MERS-CoV circulating in Africa can cause zoonotic disease, i.e. invade the lower respiratory tract to cause severe viral pneumonia. The genetically diverse strains of MERS-CoV found in Moroccan dromedaries, as well as other regions of western Africa, e.g. Nigeria and Burkina Faso, might have a lower potential for severe zoonotic disease compared with the virus strain isolated in the Middle East [8]. Testing for MERS-CoV RNA in patients with severe acute respiratory infections in dromedary camel herding regions of Africa is needed to ascertain whether or not zoonotic MERS disease is occurring in Africa.",
