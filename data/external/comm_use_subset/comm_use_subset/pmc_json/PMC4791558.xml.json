To probe the underlying mechanism by which BTV1 induced autophagy, we analyzed the mTOR pathway in BSR cells because mTOR is the major hub of the whole regulatory network of autophagy18. Rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, was used as a positive control. As shown in Fig. 1a, compared with mock cells, BTV1 infection and rapamycin treatment both caused significant decreases in the levels of phospho-mTOR, while the total mTOR remained nearly unchanged. The ratio of LC3-II to \u03b2-actin, a marker of autophagy, clearly increased, indicating that mTOR signaling is involved in BTV1- induced autophagy in BSR cells.",

The results showed that mTOR phosphorylation activity displayed a reduced trend with the replication of the virus. Consistently, the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 kinase-1(p70S6K), a hallmark substrate of mTORC1, was also found to be diminished with increasing infection time (Fig. 1b). The ratios of p-mTOR/mTOR and p-p70S6K/p70S6K were notably decreased by approximately 3.5 times and 4.5 times, respectively, at 36 hpi. (Fig. 1c, Upper and middle panels, P < 0.01). As expected, the increase in LC3-II was monitored at the indicated times after BTV1 infection relative to mock-infected cells (Fig. 1b). Similarly, the indicator ratio of LC3-II to \u03b2-actin was significantly increased by approximately 3 times at 24 hpi and 4 times at 36 hpi (Fig. 1c, Lower panel, P < 0.01). Meanwhile, monoclonal antibodies that specifically recognize the BTV1 VP2 and NS3 proteins were used to track the progression of infection. Collectively, these observations indicate that BTV1 induces autophagy by inhibiting mTOR signaling, and the process is dependent on viral replication.",

Further confirmation assays were conducted by the inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation with the specific inhibitor U0126. The results showed that the p-ERK1/2 band reduced significantly with U0126 treatment, meaning the inhibitory effect of the drug was obvious. However, the inhibition of p-ERK1/2 by U0126 hardly affect the trends of mTOR phosphorylation and LC3 conversion caused by BTV1 infection (Fig. 2b, Lane 2 and 4), which suggested that ERK1/2 was not the functional upstream regulator of mTOR-LC3 pathway in BTV1 infection (Fig. 2b). Additionally, immunofluorescence analysis was used to quantify the LC3 punctae, another marker of autophagy. After transfection with pEGFP-LC3, the addition of U0126 did not obviously alter the number of EGFP-LC3 punctae relative to the DMSO group with or without BTV1 infection in BSR cells (Fig. 2c,d, P > 0.05). Thus, we conclude that ERK1/2 signaling is not involved in BTV1-induced autophagy. Our findings of viral titer determination are consistent with previous observations of VP2 in western blotting, indicating that U0126 treatment did not affect virus replication (Fig. 2e). All the above results suggest that BTV1-induced autophagy initiation is not dependent on the ERK1/2-mTOR pathway.",

            "text": "It has been shown that mTOR is directly linked to Akt, a downstream product of PI3K36, and the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway plays an important role in cell autophagy. Therefore, we examined Akt activity to investigate whether autophagy induced by BTV1 infection was involved in this mTOR-dependent pathway. We found that BTV1 induced a marked reduction in Akt and mTOR activity as well as a great increase in LC3-II, especially at 36 hpi (Fig. 3a), implying that Akt positively regulates mTOR. Next, to further obtain evidence for the interconnection between decreased Akt signaling and mTOR-dependent autophagy, activator insulin was exposed to BSR cells with or without BTV1 infection. Figure 3b showed that after insulin treatment, the decreases in Akt and mTOR phosphorylation were restored in BTV1-infected or mock-treated cells, which led to reduced autophagy (Fig. 3b). Similar findings were seen in the confocal image of BTV1 plus insulin, showing fewer accumulated GFP-LC3 punctae in Fig. 3c,d. As expected, autophagy suppression led to decreased extracellular and intracellular virus yields with insulin treatment, especially at 36 hpi (Fig. 3e), indicating that Akt links to autophagy and BTV replication at a late stage of infection. Moreover, we constructed mutant plasmids to examine the effects of dominant-negative (DN) and constitutively active (myr) Akt variants on autophagy and virus replication. We found that the abundance levels of LC3-II and NS3 protein were partially recovered by the presence of DN-Akt and partially degraded by myr-Akt compared with the vector group or WT-Akt group (Fig. 3f). Taken together, our data show that the Akt-mTOR pathway contributes to the regulation of autophagy and naturally affects BTV1 infection. However, the effect of this signaling is not strongly influential on BTV1-conferred autophagy and virus replication, suggesting that other mechanisms may exist.",

First, BSR cells were infected with BTV1 or treated with AICAR (an AMPK activator)39 for 36 h to assess the AMPK activity. Figure 4a shows that BTV1 infection led to increased AMPK activity in BSR cells, as evidenced by the heightened expression level of phospho-AMPK. Then, we further analyzed the links of AMPK activation and mTOR inhibition with BTV1 infection. Figure 4b shows that BTV1-infection significantly increased the phosphorylation of AMPK at 24 and 36 hpi, while the levels of p-mTOR steadily decreased, which accordingly resulted in an increase in LC3-II. Thus, it is reasonable to speculate that AMPK might relate to the mTOR signaling pathways.",

Figure 5a shows that in BTV1-infected cells, AMPK inhibition partly restored the phosphorylation of mTOR, and the restoration of mTOR activity subsequently inhibited BTV1-induced autophagy, whereas the inhibition of AMPK by Compound C did not inhibit CaMKK\u03b2 activation in response to BTV1 infection, suggesting that AMPK is a negative regulator of mTOR and occurs downstream of CaMKK\u03b2. The puncta formation of GFP-LC3 was further examined. Compared with uninfected cells, significant puncta formation was found in BTV-infected cells but was dramatically reduced with the application of Compound C (Fig. 5b,c), so we concluded that AMPK could positively regulate autophagy. Additionally, in our previous study, we found that autophagy affected the state of BTV infection. Here, we found that the inhibition of autophagy with Compound C via AMPK not only downregulated the expression of VP2 and NS3 in BTV1-infected cells at 36 hpi (Fig. 5a) but also decreased the yields of BTV progeny both inside and outside the infected cells at 24 and 36 hpi (Fig. 5d). Our findings are consistent with previous observations.",

Lysed samples were used to evaluate the activity of AMPK and mTOR.

A large number of GFP-LC3 puncta were observed in BTV1-infected cells, an indicator of autophagy activation, whereas these puncta were reduced dramatically upon STO-609 treatment, suggesting that activated autophagy was inhibited (Fig. 6b,c). Thus, we concluded that CaMKK\u03b2 could positively regulate autophagy.

We observed that the fluorescence intensity of the peaks shifted rightward with the infection, meaning that [Ca2+]cyto levels increased progressively with increasing infection time (Fig. 7a). Further, to determine whether the BTV-induced increase in [Ca2+]cyto actually performs signaling through CaMKK\u03b2 and AMPK for autophagy induction, we first applied ionomycin as a positive control to perform our assay. Ionomycin (Iono), a Ca2+ ionophore that serves as a mobile Ca2+ carrier, allows Ca2+ fluxes from both the extracelluar space and the ER causing a rapid burst in cytosolic calcium levels and CaMKK\u03b2 and AMPK activation45. As shown in Fig. 7b,c, compared with mock cells, BSR cells treated with BTV1 or ionomycin exhibited similar change trends in [Ca2+]cyto and related moleculars, suggesting that BTV-induced Ca2+ signaling may lead to autophagy stimulation by the same way. Based on these findings, we reasoned that if chelation of calcium resulted in contrary effects. 1,2-Bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester) (BAPTA-AM) is a well-established chelator of intracellular calcium ions40. As expected, the fluorescence intensity of the peak shifted leftward with BAPTA-AM treatment, indicating that BAPTA-AM treatment indeed obviously reduced [Ca2+]cyto level (Fig. 7d). Accordingly, the addition of BAPTA-AM to the cells significantly abolished the activities of CaMKK\u03b2 and AMPK. In addition, the remarkable decrease of LC3 expression with BAPTA-AM was accompanied by an obvious reduction in viral proteins synthesis (Fig. 7e). All these reflected that Ca2+ is required for functional autophagy in a CaMKK\u03b2- and AMPK-dependent manner during BTV infection.",

Based on our existing data, we then planned to focus our attention on TSC2. To address whether TSC2 is an essential intermediate in both the Akt-mTOR and AMPK-mTOR signaling pathways, TSC2 gene knockdown was first performed using TSC2-specific siRNAs to predict related molecules. Some pairs of siRNAs targeting TSC2 (Mesocricetus auratus/mau, GI:524963743) and TSC2 (Cricetulus griseus/cgr, GI:625196261) were designed and screened, and we chose siTSC2 (mau2#) for further use because it exhibited the most significant effect (Fig. 8a). Nontarget siRNA was used as a negative control (siNC). We found that BTV1 infection induced the activation of TSC2 and reduced mTOR activity. The suppression of TSC2 by siRNA recovered mTOR phosphorylation and then downregulated LC3-II (Fig. 8b), suggesting that TSC2 regulated autophagy via mTOR. Furthermore, Akt inhibition and AMPK activation caused by BTV1 infection were not markedly altered in BSR cells treated with TSC2-specific siRNA compared to cells treated with control siRNA (Fig. 8b), implying that Akt and AMPK might be upstream regulators of TSC2 in BTV1-mediated autophagy. To thoroughly confirm this conclusion, we transfected BSR cells with Akt mutant plasmids and siRNAs against AMPK, respectively, then infected the cells with BTV1 for 36 h, and the protein lysates were analyzed. We found that the activation of Akt with plasmid myr-Akt repressed p-TSC2, and the inhibition of Akt with DN-Akt recovered TSC2 activity (Fig. 8c). The inhibition of AMPK also suppressed TSC2 activation (Fig. 8d). All these results indicated that TSC2 is a crucial downstream effector of Akt and AMPK. In addition, LC3 aggregation was markedly decreased in infected cells treated with TSC2-specific siRNA compared to cells treated with control siRNA (Fig. 8e,f), which suggested that TSC2 was required for the BTV1-induced autophagic response. TSC2 interference ultimately led to impaired replication of BTV through the disturbance of autophagy (Fig. 8g). These results imply that TSC2 is a pivotal intermediate of the Akt-mTOR and AMPK-mTOR signaling pathways, ultimately contributing to BTV1-induced autophagy. Figure 8h shows a hypothetical model depicting the signaling mechanisms of BTV1-induced autophagy in BSR cells.",

The mTOR pathway involves two functional complexes: the rapamycin-sensitive mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), which regulates autophagy, and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2), which is not a direct autophagy regulator. The activity of mTOR is controlled by many upstream signals, e.g., PI3K/Akt, AMPK and p53, which subsequently regulate related down-stream molecules and initiate the autophagy process.

The different classes of PI3K exert distinct effects on autophagy49. Increases in the class I PI3K product, PIP3, inhibit autophagy by inducing Akt activation. In other words, class I PI3K/Akt is a negatively regulated pathway of autophagy. In contrast, increasing the levels of the class III PI3K product, PI-3-P, stimulates autophagy. For BTV1, our results suggest that the down-regulation of p-mTOR can be partly attributed to Akt inactivation after BTV1 infection, which leads to autophagy activation (Fig. 3). Mutations causing Akt activation or inactivation cause the suppression and induction of autophagy, respectively. These results are consistent with a previous report50. Similarly to BTV, with slight differences, avian reovirus protein p17-mediated Tpr suppression negatively regulates PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling for its own replication, and HCV infection induces ER stress, which inhibits the Akt-TSC-mTORC1 pathway, thus inhibiting ULK1, and subsequently upregulates autophagy3451. Thus, we deduce that different viruses utilize the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway to promote autophagy through various stimulatory molecules. In addition, it is worth mentioning that the functions of the PI3K/Akt pathway are not limited to autophagy induction. The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is involved in multi-cellular processes such as glucose metabolism, protein synthesis, and proliferation. It also appears to be associated with the host cell immune response to counteract viral infection52. Moreover, previous investigations have suggested that many viruses rely on the activation of this pathway for their replication5354. Hence, we conclude that the PI3K/Akt pathway is a complex and crucial pathway that is distinctively manipulated by various viruses, depending on the virus type or stage of viral replication.",

Phosphorylated AMPK can either negatively regulate the mTOR complex (mTORC1) or directly phosphorylate ULK1, both of which can initiate the autophagy process38. Tracking back upstream from AMPK demonstrated that two signals were involved, Ca2+-mediated CaMKK\u03b2 and cellular energy. Calcium and CAMKK\u03b2 are involved in AMPK activation in hypothalamic neurons, T cells and endothelial cells, indicating that the calcium metabolism also plays a role in AMPK-mTOR-mediated autophagy regulation40. Recent research findings have shown that, in rotavirus-infected cells, CaMKK\u03b2 is stimulated by the increase in the intracellular Ca2+ level and further activates AMPK, the latter potently inducing autophagy55. Rotavirus-encoded viroporin NSP4 plays a key role in this process. Because BTV and rotavirus all belong to the Reoviridae family, and the NS3 of BTV shares a similar structure with viroporin, this CaMKK\u03b2 signaling was verified in BTV1-induced autophagy. Quite predictably, BTV infection caused the elevation of [Ca2+]cyto and Ca2+-mediated activation of CaMKK\u03b2, leading to the phosphorylation of AMPK and the initiation of autophagy (Figs 4, 5, 6, 7). Although BTV1 infection indeed could elevate cytosolic calcium, the mechanisms by which this occurs are unclear. We speculated that BTV might encode one or more proteins to change the biomembrane permeability to calcium, causing the increased [Ca2+]cyto originated from ER or Golgi [Ca2+] stores, or extracellular environment. In our previous study, we have confirmed that ER stress response is involved in BTV-induced autophagy56, which remined us there might be some links between ER stress and elevated [Ca2+]cyto. It\u2019s worth noting that many viruses, such as poliovirus, coxsackievirus, and hepatitis B virus, all could induce [Ca2+]cyto increase as well as CaMKK\u03b2 activation5758, leading to the speculation that virus-mediated CaMKK\u03b2 activation through elevated [Ca2+]cyto might be a common mechanism for the induction of autophagy. Moreover, we noted that the effects of AMPK inhibition on BTV1-induced autophagy are slightly greater than the effects of CaMKK\u03b2 inhibition, so we speculated that AMPK might be simultaneously activated by some other upstream signals, which are currently unclear. According to the literature reports, AMPK is a serine-threonine kinase that functions as a fuel gauge and maintains energy homeostasis during cellular stress59. AMPK is sensitive to the cytosolic AMP-to-ATP ratio, and metabolic stress activates autophagy through the suppression of mTOR signaling24. Thus, whether the decreased ATP level is triggered by BTV1 infection and participates in the activation of AMPK and the induction of autophagy needs to be further explored.",
