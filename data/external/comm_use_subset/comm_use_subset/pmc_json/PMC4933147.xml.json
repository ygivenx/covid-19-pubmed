This working group will conduct several consultations with key health and economics experts around the world \u2013 including many virtual ones \u2013 during 2016\u20137 to collect information and examine local contexts. It will hopefully report to the World Health Assembly in May 2017.",

Extreme weather events \u2013 including droughts, floods, heat waves and extreme storms \u2013 directly claim lives and destroy livelihoods. The changing climate destabilizes food production, and can lead to hunger and even famine. Warmer temperatures are extending the range of various tropical disease vectors, such as those for malaria, dengue fever and Zika virus. As human and animal habitats change because of global warming, emerging and re-emerging diseases such as Ebola, MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and other zoonotic (animal diseases transmitted to humans) diseases are likely to appear. Global warming is also likely to contribute to more stagnant air masses, especially in the tropics and subtropics, thereby contributing to higher levels of air pollution from soot, tropospheric ozone, and other causes, and air pollution is now recognized as the leading environmental cause of death globally.",

Even more rapid decarbonization would be needed to achieve the 1.5-degree centigrade limit also set in the Paris Climate Agreement. Since fossil fuel combustion is a major source of smog and air pollution, the shift to low-carbon and zero-carbon energy sources will also help to clean up the air, especially in the highly polluted cities of Asia. In many highly polluted places today, the enormous gains in health and productivity would cover much or all of the incremental costs of moving to low-carbon energy, not to mention the decisive benefits in reducing or stopping human-induced climate change. The incremental costs of decarbonization are likely to be under 1% of annual national income for typical economies, and for some economies much less than that. The benefits of stopping climate change and improving public health would be vastly greater.",

Zero or low-carbon power can be achieved in several ways: renewables (wind and solar), geothermal, hydroelectric power, nuclear energy, carbon capture and storage, ocean energy, and advanced biofuels. Countries must now consider their choices among the low-carbon and zero-carbon options, taking into account what is and can be made available in each country in terms of alternative forms of low-carbon or zero-carbon primary energy sources. The Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project, for example, has explored a range of solutions for 16 of the countries that emit the most carbon.",

In preparing their long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies known as \u201cLEDS\u201d that are called for in the Paris Agreement (article IV, paragraph 19), countries should measure the health gains they are likely to achieve by making the switch from fossil fuels and incorporate gains into their net benefit calculations.",

There is no single policy instrument that will bring about timely and comprehensive decarbonization. Many policy tools deployed simultaneously will be needed, including carbon pricing.

Under the Paris Agreement, all countries are obliged to prepare long-term, low greenhouse-gas emission development strategies and to present these long-term plans to the global community by 2020 at the latest.

Eventually, all countries will need to decarbonize comprehensively, but it is probably sound to allow the poorest countries, notably in Africa, to continue to use their local fossil fuel resources for longer than is the case in the middle-income and high-income countries. These very poor countries contribute only a very small part of global emissions, but represent a large share of the global poor. Moreover, the richer countries of course have a vastly higher share of the cumulative historical emissions to date, and therefore a vastly higher responsibility for the damages that are already underway.",
