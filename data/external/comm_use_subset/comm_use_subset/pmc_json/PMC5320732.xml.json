Bats have been identified as natural reservoirs of many viruses. Some of these viruses cause outbreaks of severe disease in humans [2], including the Ebola virus, the lyssavirus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and henipaviruses [3]. Interestingly, these viruses rarely cause apparent clinical signs in bats [2]. Bats possess unique characteristics that may contribute to their ability to act as a major natural reservoir for viruses, including a high level of species diversity, a long lifespan, a high population density, and high levels of spatial mobility [4].",

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is classified as belonging to the genus Hepacivirus in the family Flaviriridae. Hepatitis D virus (HDV) is considered to be a subviral satellite because it can only propagate in the presence of HBV. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is classified as belonging to the genus Orthohepevirus in the family Hepeviridae. Hepatovirus-related sequences have been identified in 13 species of bat collected in North America, Europe, and Africa [5]. Hepadnavirus-related sequences have been discovered in five species of bat collected in Panama, Gabon, Myanmar, and China [6, 8\u201310]. Highly diverse hepacivirus-related sequences have been detected in 20 species of bat across the world [11]. Hepevirus-related sequences have been discovered in bats in Ghana, Panama, and Germany [7]. These results indicate that bats may be important reservoirs of these hepatitis viruses (Table 1).\n",
