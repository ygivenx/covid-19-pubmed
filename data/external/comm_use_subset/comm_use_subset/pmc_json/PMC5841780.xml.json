The architecture for the state-of-the-art CNN has many parameters; for example, the VGG-16 Model has 138 million parameters, where the parameters are learned from the ImageNet dataset containing 1.2 million general object images of 1,000 different object categories for training[16]. Deep neural networks are difficult to train using small datasets (i.e., a few hundred images). To circumvent this problem, we used the fine-tuning technique, which is one of the regularization techniques. We fine-tuned a modified VGG model with 16 layers (13 convolutional and three fully connected layers), which uses the convolution filters of the same size (i.e., 3 \u00d7 3) for all convolution layers, as seen in Table 1. Our network configuration is depicted in Fig 2 and Table 1. Each layer and feature map in the CNN is represented by a three-dimensional array of size <h \u00d7 w \u00d7 d >, where h and w are spatial dimensions, and d is the number of channels or feature dimensions. The first layer is the input image patch with pixel size h \u00d7 w, and d is the color channel (Fig 2 and Table 1; \u201cconv\u201d represents a convolutional layer and \u201cFC\u201d represents a fully connected layer).",

A series of convolutional layers (conv1, conv2, conv3, conv4, and conv5) were followed by three fully connected layers: the first 2 fully connected layers (FC6 and FC7) had 4,096 channels each, where each followed a ReLU activation function, while the last fully connected layer (FC8) had 2 channels since our problem was a two-way classification problem (melanoma and non-melanoma class). It should be noted that the number of channels of the last fully connected layer was the same as the number of classes. Hence, we replaced the original fully connected layer (FC8: FC with 1000 channels) with a fully connected layer with two channels.

The scale and location of a skin lesion in a captured image were changed according to the capture conditions. To resolve this issue, we adopted a sliding window strategy and used the cropped patches instead of the full image at the training and inference time. At the inference time, we extracted about 12 image patches from each test image on a regularly spaced grid with a partial overlap between neighboring patches and then each patch was rescaled to the size of 224 \u00d7 224 pixels, as seen in Fig 3. In addition, to increase the robustness of the variation of geometric transformation in our CNN model, the training dataset was artificially augmented at training. Additional augmented data were formed by rotating and flipping images from the original training set. We generated 216 image patches from a single image using rotations by 0\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0, and 135\u00b0, as well as left-right and top-bottom reflections. In addition, the patches that did not contain any melanoma lesions among the melanoma training images were manually removed and the patches that did not contain any skin lesions among the non-melanoma training images were assigned to the non-melanoma class at training time.",

Fig 4(b)\u20134(m) shows 100 filters among the learned filters from the 2nd to the 13th convolution layer, respectively, where each represents a learned filter with a 3 \u00d7 3 kernel size. At the time of inference, we interpreted 12 image patches per test image, and when one or more images were predicted as containing melanoma, the corresponding test image was interpreted as containing melanoma. Each input of the network was an RGB image subtracted from the average image and calculated over the entire training image dataset. We implemented our method using MatConvNet, a Matlab-based CNN framework for computer vision applications[18]. Moreover, we fine-tuned a VGG model with 16 layers downloaded from http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/pretrained).",

These procedures are necessary to construct an automated diagnosis system from small datasets due to the low occurrence rate of acral melanoma.

This method used particular features such as color, shape, size, the boundary of the skin lesion, and statistical features of wavelength, which showed 91.26% of accuracy and 0.937 AUC value[25]. However, these cannot be directly applied to acral melanoma due to the different morphologic features such as ridge or furrow patterns. Although there was a new dermoscopic algorithm reflecting these characteristics for diagnosing acral melanoma: BRAAFF[26], it has not yet been applied to the automated diagnosis. In addition, although there is a state-of-art automated classification method for acral melanoma, these methods cannot be generalized and only work well for a particular pattern of acral melanoma, which is a ridge-and-furrow pattern[27]. Automated diagnosis methods using particular features are able to reflect experts\u2019 perception and the speed of performance is fast. However, it is not easy to catch experts\u2019 perception, although we are trying to reach the goal with significant features. On the other hand, deep learning does not require specific features as inputs. It automatically finds the most correlated features with expert\u2019s perception by learning. Thus the accuracy is higher than feature-based methods. However, a large database is critical for the successful completion of deep learning.",
