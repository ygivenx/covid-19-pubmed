The IBV genome consists of a positive-stranded RNA of 27.6 kb in length, and the virus belongs to the Gammacoronavirus genus (Coronaviridae family, Nidovirales order; Cavanagh et al., 1992). The disease, which affects chickens of all ages, poses a major economic threat to the worldwide poultry industry because of poor weight gain and lost feeding efficiency in broilers, and reduced egg numbers and quality in egg-laying birds (Yu et al., 2001; Xu et al., 2007; Jackwood, 2012).",

            "text": "Currently, the main method of protecting chickens from IB is vaccination with both live and inactivated vaccines (Zhao et al., 2015). However, effective vaccination is undermined by rapidly acquired genetic changes in IBV (e.g., gene insertion, mutation, deletion, and reconstruction; Dolz et al., 2008; Kuo et al., 2010). Additionally, immunity against IBV affords a low degree of cross protection between different IBV serotypes (Cowen and Hitchner, 1975), thus confirming the results of molecular epidemiology studies on IBV (Han et al., 2011; Li et al., 2012). Because of the inaccuracy of the coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and high frequency of homologous RNA recombination, the emergence of new variant strains, genotypes, and serotypes of IBV is continuously reported (Cavanagh et al., 1986). Existing vaccines for IB no longer provide protection and they tend to be ineffective against the epidemic IBV strains when new variant IBV isolates emerge or when new serotypes appear (Sun et al., 2011). Therefore, screening new live-attenuated vaccine strains based on new isolates is necessary to protect chickens against the common epidemic IBV strains.",

We scored the degree of integrity and the preservation of ciliary movement in the tracheal epithelial cells at 3\u201310 dpc in the present study after challenge with IBV GD strain. The results revealed that IBV GD induces a severe respiratory disease and lesions in the experimental chickens, and the associated ciliostasis is extremely severe. Consequently, a secondary infection with other pathogens may be acquired more easily when the protective capability of the tracheal cilia is weakened or lost.",
