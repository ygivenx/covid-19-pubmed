The power of these numerical simulation tools is based uniquely on their ability to appropriately incorporate the underlying nonlinear and multivariate processes of pathogen transmission in order to facilitate plausible predictions outside the range of conditions at which these processes are either directly observed or quantified [8\u201311]. The value of these tools for guiding policy and management decisions by providing comparative predictions of the outcomes of various strategies for achieving the control or elimination of the major Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) has been highlighted in a series of recent publications [8, 11, 12], demonstrating the crucial role these quantitative tools are beginning to play in advancing policy options for these diseases.",

            "text": "While these developments underscore the utility of transmission models for supporting policy development in parasite control, a growing realization is that these models can be useful for this purpose only if the biological processes are well defined and demographic and environmental stochasticity are either well-characterized or unimportant for meeting the goal of the policy modelling exercise [9\u201311, 13\u201316]. This is because the realized predictability of any model for a system depends on the initial conditions, parameterizations and process equations that are utilized in its simulation such that model outcomes are strongly sensitive to the choice of values used for these variables [17]. Any misspecification of these system attributes will lead to failure in accurately forecasting the future behaviour of a system, with predictions of actual future states becoming highly uncertain even when the exact representation of the underlying deterministic process is well established but precise specification of initial conditions or forcing and/or parameter values is difficult to achieve [17, 18]. This problem becomes even more intractable when theoretical models depend on parameter estimates taken from other studies [5, 17, 19]. Both these challenges, viz. sensitivity to forcing conditions and use of parameter estimates from settings that are different from the dynamical environment in which a model will be used for simulation, imply that strong limits will be imposed on the realized predictability of any given model for an application [9, 10, 20]. As we have shown recently, if such uncertainties are ignored, the ability of parasite transmission models to form the scientific basis for management decisions can be severely undermined, especially when predictions are required over long time frames and across heterogeneous geographic locations [4, 5, 7].",

Such approaches, termed model-data fusion or data assimilation methods, act by combining models with various data streams (including observations made at different spatial or temporal scales) in a statistically rigorous way to inform initial conditions, constrain model parameters and system states, and quantify model errors. The result is the discovery of models that can more adequately capture the prevailing system dynamics in a site, an outcome which in turn has been shown to result in the making of significantly improved predictions for management decision making [9, 10, 14, 24]. Initially used in geophysics and weather forecasting, these methods are also beginning to be applied in ecological modelling, including more recently in the case of infectious disease modelling [9, 10]. In the latter case, the approach has shown that it can reliably constrain a disease transmission model during simulation to yield results that approximate epidemiological reality as closely as possible, and as a consequence improve the accuracy of forecasts of the response of a pathogen system exposed to various control efforts [4\u20137, 21, 25\u201327].",

If these driving forces were to change, then it follows that even a model well-calibrated to a given historical dataset will fail. New developments in longitudinal data assimilation can mitigate this problem of potential time variation of parameters via the recursive adjustment of the model by assimilation of data obtained through time [22, 29, 30]. Apart from allowing assessment of whether stasis bias may occur in model predictions, such sequential model calibration with time-varying data can also be useful for quantifying the utility of the next measurement in maximizing the information gained from all measurements together [31]. Carrying out such longitudinal model-data analysis has thus the potential for providing information to improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of data monitoring campaigns [24, 31\u201333], along with facilitating more reliable model forecasts.",

            "text": "A key question, however, is evaluating which longitudinal data streams provide the most information to improve model performance [33]. Indeed, it is possible that from a modelling perspective using more data may not always lead to a better-constrained model [34]. This suggests that addressing this question is not only relevant to model developers, who need observational data to improve, constrain, and test models, but also for disease managers working on the design of disease surveillance plans. At a more philosophical level, we contend that these questions have implications for how current longitudinal monitoring data from parasite control programmes can best be exploited both scientifically and in management [31]. Specifically, we suggest that these surveillance data need to be analysed using models in a manner that allows the extraction of maximal information about the monitored dynamical systems so that this can be used to better guide both the collection of such data as well as the provision of more precise estimates of the system state for use in making state-dependent decisions [2, 35\u201337]. Currently, parasite control programmes use infection monitoring data largely from sentinel sites primarily to determine if an often arbitrarily set target is met [3]. Little consideration is given to whether these data could also be used to learn about the underlying transmission dynamics of the parasitic system, or how such learning can be effectively used by management to make better decisions regarding the interventions required in a setting to meet stated goals [2, 4].",

This protocol proposes that infection data be collected in sentinel sites before the first round of MDA to establish baseline conditions, no sooner than 6 months following the third round of MDA, and no sooner than 6 months following the fifth MDA to assess whether transmission has been interrupted (defined as reduction of mf prevalence to below 1% in a population) [44, 51]. Thus, the four data streams considered for investigating the value of information gained from each survey were respectively: scenario 1\u2014baseline mf prevalence data only, scenario 2\u2014baseline and post-MDA 3 mf prevalence data, scenario 3\u2014baseline, post-MDA 3, and post-MDA 5 mf prevalence data, and scenario 4\u2014baseline and post-MDA 5 mf prevalence data. In addition to these four data streams, a fifth model-only scenario (scenario 0) was also considered where no site-specific data was introduced. In this case, simulations of interventions were performed using only model-specific parameter and ABR priors estimated for each region.",

The number of parameters which were left free to be fitted to these data by each model range from 3 (LYMFASIM and TRANSFIL) to 21 (EPIFIL). The ABR, a key transmission parameter in all three models, was also left as a free parameter whose distribution was influenced by the observed ABR (Table 1) and/or by fits to previous region-specific datasets (see S1 Supplementary Information for model-specific implementations). The subsequent steps used to incorporate longitudinal infection data into the model calibration procedure varied among the models, but in all cases the goodness-of-fit of the model outputs for the site-specific mf prevalence data was assessed using the chi-square metric (\u03b1 = 0.05) [52].",

Fig 1 summarizes the iterative algorithm used for conducting this sequential model-data assimilation exercise [6]. LYMFASIM and TRANSFIL, by contrast, included all the data in each investigated stream together for selecting the best-fitting models for each time series\u2013i.e. model selection for each data series was based on using all relevant observations simultaneously in the fitting process [30, 53, 54]. Although a limitation of this batch estimation approach is that the posterior probability of each model is fixed for the whole simulation period, unlike the case in sequential data assimilation where a restricted set of parameters is exposed to each observation (as a result of parameter constraining by data used in the previous time step)\u2013which thereby yields models that give better predictions for different portions of the underlying temporal process\u2014here we use both methods to include and assess the impact that this implementation difference may have on the results presented below. For all models, the final updated parameter estimates from each data stream were used to simulate the impact of observed MDA rounds and for predicting the impact of continued MDA to estimate how many years were required to achieve 1% mf prevalence.",

For making mf prevalence forecasts beyond the observations made in each site, MDA simulations were extended for a total of 50 annual rounds in each site at an assumed coverage of 65%. While the drug-induced mf kill rate and the duration of adult worm sterilization were fixed among the models (Table 1), the worm kill rate was left as a free parameter to be estimated from post-intervention data to account for the uncertainty in this drug efficacy parameter [4, 7, 21].

First, to determine if data are required to improve the predictability of intervention forecasts by the present LF models in comparison with the use of theoretical models only, and second, to evaluate the benefit of using different longitudinal streams of mf survey data for calibrating the three models in order to determine which data stream was most informative for reducing the uncertainty in model predictions in a site. Table 2 summarises the key results from our investigation of these questions: these are the number of accepted best-fitting models for each data stream or scenario in the three study sites (Table 1), the predicted median and range (2.5th-97.5th percentiles) in years to achieve the mf threshold of 1% mf prevalence, the weighted variance and entropy values based on these predictions, and the relative information gained (in terms of reduced prediction uncertainty) by the use of longitudinal data for constraining the projections of each of the three LF models investigated. Even though the number of selected best-fit models based on the chi-square criterion (see Methods) differed for each site and model, these results indicate unequivocally that models constrained by data provided significantly more precise intervention predictions compared to model-only predictions (Table 2). Note that this was also irrespective of the two types of longitudinal data assimilation procedures (sequential vs. simultaneous) used by the different models in this study. Thus, for all models and sites, model-only predictions made in the absence of data (scenario 0) showed the highest prediction uncertainty, highlighting the need for data to improve the predictive performance of the present models. The relative information gained by using each data stream in comparison to model-only predictions further support this finding, with the best gains in reducing model prediction uncertainty provided by those data constraining scenarios that gave the lowest weighted variance and entropy values; as much as 92% to 96% reductions in prediction variance were achieved by these scenarios in comparison to model-only predictions between the three models (Table 2). The results also show, however, that data streams including post-MDA 5 mf survey data (scenarios 3 and 4) reduced model uncertainty (based on both the variance and entropy measures) most compared to data streams containing only baseline and/or post-MDA 3 mf survey data (scenarios 1 and 2) (Table 2). Although there were differences between the three models (due to implementation differences either in how the models are run (Monte Carlo deterministic vs. individual-based) or in relation to how the present data were assimilated (see above)), overall, scenario 3, which includes baseline, post-MDA 3, and post-MDA 5 data, was shown to most often reduce model uncertainty the greatest. Additionally, there was no statistical difference between the performances of scenarios 3 and 4 in those cases where scenario 4 resulted in the greatest gain of information (Table 2). It is also noticeable that the best constraining data stream for each combination of site and model also produced as expected the lowest range in predictions of the numbers of years of annual MDA required to achieve the 1% mf prevalence in each site, with the widest ranges estimated for model-only predictions (scenario 0) and the shorter data streams (scenario 1). In general, this constriction in predictions also led to lower estimates of the median times to achieve LF elimination, although this varied between models and sites (Table 2).",

This gain in precision, and thus the information gained using these data streams, is, as expected, greater for the stochastic LYMFASIM and TRANSFIL models compared to the deterministic EPIFIL model. Note also that even though the ranges in predictions of the annual MDA years required to eliminate LF by the data streams providing the lowest prediction entropy differed statistically between the three models, the values overlapped markedly (e.g. for Kirare the ranges are 10\u201318, 9\u201314, 9\u201315 for EPIFIL, LYMFASIM and TRANSFIL respectively), suggesting the occurrence of a similar constraining of predictive behaviour among the three models.",

Given the similarity in outcomes of each model, we remark on the results from the fits of the technically easier to run EPIFIL model to evaluate this possibility here. The assessment of the parameter space constraint achieved through the inclusion of data was made by determining if the fitted parameter distributions for the model became reduced in comparison with priors as data streams were added to the system [33]. The exercise showed that the size of the estimated parameter distributions reduced with addition of data, with even scenario 1 data producing reductions for Kirare and Peneng (Fig 5). In the case of Alagramam, however, there was very little, if any, constraint in the fitted parameter space compared to the prior parameter space. This result, together with the fact that even using all the data in Kirare and Peneng produced up to only between 2.5 to 5% reductions in fitted parameter distributions when compared to the priors, indicate that the observed model prediction uncertainty in this study may be due to other complex factors connected with model parameterization. Table 3 provides the results of an analysis of pairwise parameter correlations of the selected best-fitting models for data scenario 1 compared to those selected by the data stream that gave the best reduction in EPIFIL prediction uncertainty for Alagramam (scenario 3). These results show that while the parameter space was not being constrained with the addition of more data, the pattern of parameter correlations changed in a complex manner between the two constraining data sets. For example, although the number of significantly correlated parameters did not differ, the magnitude and direction of parameter correlations were shown to change between the two data scenarios (Table 3). The corresponding results for Kirare and Peneng are shown in S3 Supplementary Information, and indicate that a broadly similar pattern of changes in parameter associations also occurred as a result of model calibration to the sequential data measured from those sites. This suggests that this outcome may constitute a general phenomenon at least with regards to the sequential constraining of EPIFIL using longitudinal mf prevalence data. An intriguing finding (from all three data settings) is that the most sensitive parameters in this regard, i.e. with respect to altered strengths in pairwise parameter correlations, may be those representing the relationship of various components of host immunity with different transmission processes, including with adult worm mortality, rates of production and survival of mf, larval development rates in the mosquito vector and infection aggregation (Table 3). This suggests that, as more constraining data are added, changes in the multidimensional parameter relationships related to host immunity could contribute to the sequential reductions in the LF model predictive uncertainty observed in this study.",

This raises the question as to whether the differences detected in the case of the best constraining data stream between the present study sites and between models (Table 2) could be a function of the simulated MDA coverages in each site. To investigate this possibility, we used EPIFIL to model the outcome of changing the assumed MDA coverage in each site on the corresponding entropy and information gain trends in elimination predictions made from the models calibrated to each of the site-specific data scenarios/streams investigated here. The results of increasing the assumed coverage of MDA to 80% for each site are shown in Fig 6 and indicate that the choice of MDA coverage in this study are unlikely to have significantly influenced the conclusion made above that the best performing data streams for reducing model uncertainty for predicting LF elimination pertains to data scenarios 3 and 4. However, while the model-predicted timelines to achieve the 1% mf prevalence threshold using the observed MDA coverage followed by 80% MDA coverage showed that the data stream which most reduced uncertainty did not change from the impact of using the observed MDA coverage followed by 65% MDA coverage modelled for Kirare and Peneng (Table 2, Fig 6), this was not the case for Alagramam, where data from scenario 3 with a 80% coverage resulted in the greatest reduction in entropy compared to the original results using 65% coverage which indicated that scenario 4 data performed best (Table 2, Fig 6). Notably, though, the entropy values of predictions using the data scenario 3 and 4 constraints were not statistically different for this site (p-value < 0.05) (Fig 6).",

This analysis was performed by using the longitudinal pre and post-infection and MDA data reported for the Nigerian site, Dokan Tofa, where elimination was achieved according to WHO recommended criteria after seven rounds of MDA (Table 5). The data from this site comprised information on the ABR and dominant mosquito genus, as well as details of the MDA intervention carried out, including the relevant drug regimen applied, time and population coverage of MDA, and outcomes from the mf prevalence surveys conducted at baseline and at multiple time points during MDA [60]. The results of model predictions of the timelines to reach below 1% mf prevalence as a result of sequential fitting to the mf prevalence data from this site pertaining to scenarios 0\u20134 (as defined above) are shown in Table 6. Note that in the post MDA 3, 5 and 7 surveys, as no LF positive individuals were detected among the sample populations, we used a one-sided 95% Clopper-Pearson interval to determine the expected upper one-sided 95% confidence limits for these sequentially observed zero infection values using the \u201cRule of Three\u201d approximation after K empty samples formula [61]. The results show that model constraining by scenario 2, which includes baseline and post-MDA 3 data, and scenario 3, which includes baseline, post-MDA 3, and post-MDA 5 data, resulted in both the least entropy values and the shortest predicted times, i.e., from as low as 2 to as high as 7 years, required for achieving LF elimination in this site (Table 6). The data in Table 5 show that the first instance the calculated one-sided upper 95% confidence limit in this setting fell below 1% mf prevalence also occurred post MDA 7 (i.e after 7 years of MDA). This is a significant result, and indicates that apart from being able to reduce prediction uncertainty, the best data-constrained models are also able to more accurately predict the maximal time (7 years) by which LF elimination occurred in this site.",

A secondary aim was to evaluate the relative value of data obtained at each of the sampling time points proposed by the WHO for monitoring the effects of LF interventions in informing these model predictions. This assessment allowed us to investigate the role of these data for learning system dynamics and measure their value for guiding the design of surveillance programmes in order to support better predictions of the outcomes of applied interventions. Fundamentally, however, this work addresses the question of how best to use predictive parasite transmission models for guiding management decision making, i.e. whether this should be based on the use of ideal models which incorporate generalized parameter values or on models with parameters informed by local data [10]. If we find that data-informed models can reduce prediction uncertainty significantly compared to the use of theoretical models unconstrained by data, then it is clear that to be useful for management decision making we require the application of model-data assimilation frameworks that can effectively incorporate information from appropriate data into models for producing reliable intervention projections. Antithetically, such a finding implies that using unconstrained ideal models in these circumstances will provide only approximate predictions characterized by a degree of uncertainty that might be too large to be useful for reliable decision making [14, 33, 62].",

Further, by iteratively testing the reduction in the uncertainty of the projections of timelines required to achieve LF elimination in a site made by the models matching each observed data point, we have also quantified the relative values of temporal data streams, including assessing optimal record lengths, for informing the current LF models. Our results provide important insights as to how best to use process models for understanding and generating predictions of parasite dynamics.

Our results show that these improvements in predictive precision were consistent between the three models and across all three of our study sites, and can be very substantive with up to as much as 92% to 96% reductions in prediction variance obtained by the best data-constrained models in a site compared to the use of model-only predictions (Table 2). The practical policy implications of this finding can also be gleaned from appraising the actual numerical ranges in the predictions made by each individual model for each of the modelling scenarios investigated here. In the case of EPIFIL, the best data-informed model (scenario 3 in Peneng) gave an elimination prediction range of 7\u201312 years, while the corresponding model-only predictions for this site indicated a need for between 6\u201329 years of annual MDA (Table 2). These gains in information from using data to inform model parameters and hence predictions were even larger for the two stochastic models investigated here, viz. LYMFASIM and TRANSFIL, where ranges as wide as 7\u201328 years predicted by model-only scenarios were reduced to 9\u201314 years for the best data-informed models in the case of LYMFASIM for Kirare village, and from as broad as 8\u201348 years to 7\u201322 years respectively in the case of TRANSFIL for Peneng (Table 2). These results unequivocally indicate that if parasite transmission models are used unconstrained by data, i.e. based on general parameter values uninformed by local data, it would lead to the making of predictions that would be marked by uncertainties that are likely to be far too large to be meaningful for practical policy making. If managers are risk averse, this outcome will also mean their need to plan interventions for substantially much longer than necessary, with major implications for the ultimate cost of the programme. Note also that although statistically significant changes in the median years of MDA required to achieve LF elimination were observed for the best data-informed models for all the three LF model types in each site, these were relatively small compared to the large reductions seen in each model\u2019s predictive uncertainly (Table 2, Fig 3). This result highlights that the major gains from constraining the present models by data lies in improving their predictive certainty rather than in advancing their average behaviour. However, our preliminary analysis of model predictive accuracy suggests that the best data-constrained models may also be able to generate more accurate predictions of the impact of control (Table 6), indicating that, apart from simply reducing predictive uncertainty, such models could additionally have improved capability for producing more reliable predictions of the outcomes of interventions carried out in a setting.",

Our critical finding here is that parameter uncertainty in all three LF models was similarly reduced by the assimilation of a few additional longitudinal data records (Table 2). In particular, we show that data streams comprising baseline + post-MDA 3 + post-MDA 5 (scenario 3) and those comprising baseline + post-MDA 5 data (scenario 4) best reduced parameter-based uncertainty in model projections of the impact of MDAs carried out in each study site irrespective of the models used. Although preliminary, a potential key finding is that the use of longer-term data additional to the data measured at the WHO proposed monitoring time points did not lead to a significant further reduction in parameter uncertainty (Table 4). Also, the finding that the WHO data scenarios 3 and 4 were adequate for constraining the present LF models appears not to be an artefact of variations in the MDA coverages observed between the three study sites (Fig 6). These results suggest that up to 5 years of post-MDA mf prevalence data are sufficient to constrain model predictions of the impact of LF interventions at a time scale that can go up to as high as 7 to 22 years depending on the site and model, and that precision may not improve any further if more new data are added (Table 2, Table 4). Given that the WHO post-MDA LF infection monitoring protocol was developed for the purpose solely focussed on supporting the meeting of set targets (e.g. the 1% mf prevalence threshold) and not on a priori hypotheses regarding how surveillance data could be used also to understand the evolution and hence prediction of the dynamical parasitic system in response to management action, our results are entirely fortuitous with respect to the value of the current LF monitoring data for learning about the LF system and its extinction dynamics in different settings [31]. They do, nonetheless, hint at the value that coupling models to data may offer to inform general theory for guiding the collection and use of monitoring data in parasite surveillance programmes in a manner that could help extract maximal information about the underlying parasite system of interest.",

Our major finding in this regard is that even though the parameter space itself may not be overly constrained by the best data stream (scenario 3 in this case for Alagramam village), the magnitude and direction of parameter correlations, particularly those representing the relationship of different components of host immunity with various transmission processes, changed markedly between the shorter (scenario 1) and seemingly optimal data streams (scenario 3). This qualitative change in system behaviour induced by alteration in parameter interactions in response to perturbations has been shown to represent a characteristic feature of complex adaptive ecological systems, particularly when these systems approach a critical boundary [64\u201366]. This underscores yet another important reason to incorporate parameter information from data for generating sound system forecasts [67]. The finding that additional data beyond 5 years post-MDA did not appear to significantly improve model predictive performance in this regard suggests that pronounced change in LF parameter interactions in response to MDA interventions may occur generally around this time point for this parasitic disease, and that once in this parameter regime further change appears to be unlikely. This is an interesting finding, which not only indicates that coupling models to at least 5 years post-MDA will allow detection of the boundaries delimiting the primary LF parameter regions with different qualitative behaviour, but also that the current WHO monitoring protocol might be sufficient to allow this discovery of system change.",

In line with our previous findings, this observed conditional dependency of systems dynamics on local transmission conditions means that timelines or durations of interventions required to break LF transmission (as depicted in Table 2) will also vary from site to site even under similar control conditions [3\u20135, 21]. As we indicated before, this outcome implies that we vitally require the application of models to detailed spatio-temporal infection surveillance data, such as that exemplified by the data collected by countries in sentinel sites as part of their WHO-directed monitoring and evaluation activities, if we are to use the present models to make more reliable intervention predictions to drive policy and management decisions (particularly with respect to the durations of interventions required, need for switching to more intensified or new MDA regimens, and need for enhanced supplementary vector control) in a given endemic setting [64]. As we have previously pointed out, the development of such spatially adaptive intervention plans will require the development and use of spatially-explicit data assimilation modelling platforms that can couple geostatistical interpolation of model inputs (eg. ABR and/or sentinel site mf/antigen prevalence data) with discovery of localized models from such data in order to produce the required regional or national intervention forecasts [5].",

While we have attempted to evaluate differences in individual model structures, their computer implementation, and the data assimilation procedures followed (e.g. sequential vs. simultaneous data assimilation), via comparing the collective predictions of the three models versus the predictions provided by each model singly, and show that these factors are unlikely to play a major role in influencing the current results, we indicate that future work must address these issues adequately to improve the initial methods we have employed in this work. Currently, we are examining the development of sequential Bayesian-based multi-model ensemble approaches that will allow better integration of each model\u2019s behaviour as well as better calculation of each model\u2019s transient parameter space at each time a new observation becomes available [30]. This work also involves the development of a method to fuse information from several indicators of infection (e.g. mf, antigenemia, antibody responses [21]) together to achieve a more robust constraining of the present models. As different types of data can act as mutual constraints on a model, we also expect that such multi-indicator model-data fusion methods will additionally address the problem of equifinality, which is known to complicate the parameterization of complex dynamical models [24, 68].",

We expect that data useful for performing these studies at scale may be available at the sentinel site level in the countries carrying out the current WHO-led monitoring programme. The present results indicate that access to such data, and to post-treatment surveillance data which are beginning to be assembled by many countries, is now a major need if the present LF models are to provide maximal information about parasite system responses to management and thus generate better predictions of system states for use in policy making and in judging management effectiveness in different spatio-temporal settings [24, 31]. Given that previous modelling work has indicated that if the globally fixed WHO-proposed 1% mf prevalence threshold is insufficient to break LF transmission in every setting (and thus conversely leading to significant infection recrudescence [21]), the modelling of such spatio-temporal surveillance data will additionally allow testing if meeting this recommended threshold will indeed result in successfully achieving the interruption of LF transmission everywhere.",
