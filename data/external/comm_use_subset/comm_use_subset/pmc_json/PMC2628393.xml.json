With the sequencing of the human and other genomes [2,3], we are now able to compare the information encoded in the genomes of a wide variety of organisms and study the mechanisms that change genomes over time, including sequence mutations, recombination, duplication and deletion [4,5]. A great deal of research has focused on the coding and regulatory regions of genomes and regularly uses informational content measurements to analyze the structure of loci in the genome [6-8]. In addition, recent interest has turned to analyzing regions that do not encode proteins [9].",

We have also measured the frequency of unique n-mers in those species and the compactness of the human genome in n-mer space. We also have identified all 5- to 20-mers that appear in the human genome more than 30,000 times, as well as the set of 15-mers that do not appear in the human genome and are more than 1 nucleotide different from all 15-mers in the human genome. In addition, we have measured the information content of the human genome for different oligo lengths and compared the information content to the proportion of coding regions in each human chromosome. The results match empirical observations and give a global view of the informational properties across a wide variety of genomes. Finally, we profiled the 10-mer space coverage for a wide range of 433 microbial genomes and found that the extent of sequence space coverage is largely determined by genome size and GC content.",

The n-mer space coverage for each genome is plotted against oligo length n in Figure 1 (See additional file 1 for the data). The E. coli genome includes all 8-mers, and less than 0.21% of all 16-mers. In contrast, the human genome includes all 11-mers and less than 0.38% of all 20-mers. Of course, n-mer space coverage reflects genome size to some extent. For example, the human genome has a much higher coverage than the yeast genome for every oligo length. The 7 genomes that we investigated in this study differ the most in their coverage for 13-mer space, ranging from 11.4% coverage for E. coli to 96% coverage for human and mouse. For comparison, we also generated a random \"pseudo\" human genome with the same length and dinucleotide frequencies (see Appendix for a formal analysis of the expected number of n-mers in this pseudo-human genome). The fact that the true human genome has less coverage of n-mer space than the pseudo-human genome (Figure 1) shows that there are more repeated n-mers in the human genome than one would expect by chance.",

In order to do this, we must choose an oligo length long enough that there are some n-mers that do not appear in the human genome (i.e., > 13-mers), and long enough that some non-human n-mers are likely to appear in non-human organisms, yet short enough that that a large fraction of the non-human n-mers could be probed in a human sample (i.e., < 16-mers). We focused on 15-mers because 38% (406.7 M) of all possible 15-mers do not appear in the human genome. However, 404.1 M of these differ from the reference human genome by a single nucleotide and so may appear as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in human samples. An oligonucleotide array of the remaining panel of 2.6 M 15-mers, that are at least 2 SNPs different from human sequences, could be constructed using current technology (e.g. Roche NimbleGen arrays). We simulated an oligonucleotide array hybridization experiment using these 2.6 M non-human 15-mers to determine the likelihood of detecting any of the fully sequenced microbes. This hypothetical array would detect 75% (2314 of 3065) viruses with a median of 3 positive non-human 15-mers (range: 0 to 1,705) and 100% (of 433) bacterial species with a median of 3,873 positive non-human 15-mers (range: 1 in the obligate endosymbiont Candidatus Carsonella ruddii PV, up to 92,127 in Burkholderia 383).

This leads to the hypothesis that human genomes are much more compact in sequence space than would be expected by chance. To explore this hypothesis, we examined how many 1 bp variants of human n-mers are also in the human genome. For each of the n-mers found in the human genome, we generated its 3n different 1 bp variants and then scanned the human genome for the presence of these variants. We found that significantly more 1 bp variants of human oligos were also in the human genome compared to random n-mers (Figure 4). The same is true for 2\u20134 bp variants of human oligos (Figure 4). Thus, the human genome is more compact, or dense, in sequence space than a random genome. When we generated variants that were more distant from the original human n-mer (up to 10 bp variants), we found in some cases that distant oligos were less likely to be in the human genome than a random oligo (Figure 4).",

This facilitates comparisons between chromosomes. We used the Lempel-Ziv 77 algorithm to estimate the entropy rate of both coding sequences and whole genomic sequences for the human genome [17]. Coding sequences have a higher entropy rate (information content) than genomic sequences (Figure 5). Note that the highly repetitive regions of telomeres and centromeres are generally coded as non-specific bases (\"N\") in the human genome and so are excluded from our calculations. Entropy was calculated from either the entire chromosome, for chromosomes < 130 Mb, or the first 130 Mb of longer chromosomes. This is sufficient to generate stable estimates of the entropy (Figure 5). Figure 6 shows both the entropy and the percent of the chromosome filled by coding regions for each human chromosome.",

We found that virtually all oligomers of length less than 13 are represented in the human genome but only a vanishingly small proportion (< 1.53%) of oligos of length greater than 19. The mouse genome is the same in these respects. Similarly, very few oligos less than 13 bp are unique in the human genome, but the vast majority of oligos of length greater than 19, except repeat elements, are unique in the human genome. This is consistent with practical experience in the design of primers for PCR. Some of the most frequent n-mers in the human genome are microsatellites and ALU elements, as would be expected (Table 2). These ultra-frequent n-mers should be useful as high density markers in the genome and as primers for assays such as random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) [18] in which a large number of regions of the genome may be amplified in a single PCR reaction. In fact, both microsatellites and ALU elements have been exploited for DNA fingerprinting [19-21]. The ultra-frequent n-mers we found are akin to the pyknons identified by Rigoutsos et al., except that pyknons need only appear 40+ times in the human genome, must be at least 16 bp long, and have the additional constraint that they appear in both protein coding and non-coding regions [22].",

The Whiteford measure of uniqueness essentially shatters a genome into n-mers and asks what proportion of those n-mers only occur once in the genome. This is appropriate for analyzing high throughput, short sequencing reads, since high copy-number n-mers will represent a large portion of the reads. Our measure asks what proportion of distinct n-mers only occur once in a genome? Thus, increasing the copy number of an n-mer already present in the genome would not change our statistic but would decrease the Whiteford measure of the frequency of unique n-mers. Our analysis suggests that the 25+bp reads of current high throughput sequencers are unlikely to produce sequences that would appear by chance in a genome other than the genome being sequenced (Figure 1). These longer n-mers should only be shared between species due to descent from a common ancestor.",

Duplication events followed by divergence between the duplicated regions is thought to be a common mechanism for genome evolution [5] and would lead to such compaction. Similarly, transposons and other repeat elements lead to structure in the non-coding region of the genome that can be detected in the difference between the entropy of the coding regions versus the non-coding regions (Figure 5). Previous work has used Renyi entropy to address the problem of failure of convergence for entropy measures on short DNA sequences [24].

The correlation between nucleotides at varying distances (\"mutual information\") is also known to be higher in coding regions than non-coding regions [25]. However, there are a number of chromosomes for which the entropy does not track with the proportion of coding regions in chromosome. Chromosomes 1, 2, 9, 12, and 14 have relatively high proportions of coding regions without relatively high entropy while chromosome 20 has a relatively low proportion of coding regions without relatively low entropy (Figure 6). This may be a signal of functional, non-coding RNA on chromosome 20, for chromosome 20 does not have an unusually low frequency of repeats, an unusual G+C content, or an unusual density of CpG islands [2,3,26]. All of chromosome 20 is conserved as a single segment in the mouse chromosome 2 [2], suggesting it contains little junk DNA. However, the anomaly of non-protein coding information content on chromosome 20 cannot yet be explained by an over-abundance of miRNAs. Out of the 475 currently confirmed miRNAs in the human genome, 11 are located on chromosome 20 [27,28]. This is no more than would be expected by chance (Binomial probability of 11 or more miRNAs, p = 0.46).",

Heterochromatin is highly repetitive sequence, including telomeres and centromeres. Since the sequenced part of the genome often extends past the borders of heterochromatin [29], it is likely that most of the n-mers in the heterochromatin (for n < 20) would have been counted in our analyses of coverage and uniqueness. The remaining 25 Mbp of euchromatic gaps are often associated with segmental duplications and copy number variations between subjects used for the reference sequencing [30]. Again, many of the n-mers in those gaps are probably represented elsewhere in the sequenced genome. However, the absence from our analysis of the 7% of the human genome with highly repetitive heterochromatin means that our estimates of entropy in the human genome (Figure 6) are probably slightly higher than the true values.",

All things being equal (including genome size and mutation rates), we would predict that a population of organisms with greater coverage of sequence space should evolve more quickly to new environmental pressures than a population of organisms with fewer sub-sequences.

We found that with a panel of 2.6 M 15-mers that are at least 2 SNPs different from human 15-mers, we could easily detect all bacterial genomes and 75% of fully sequenced viruses. This approach is inspired by the negative selection algorithm used by the immune system: generate random amino acid sequence (peptide) detectors and then remove those that match self. Patterns of positive probes on an array of non-human 15-mers are likely to be enough to identify known microbes. To identify an unknown microbe, any non-human probe that hybridized to DNA from a human sample could be used as a PCR primer to sequence in both directions from that probe and thereby generate longer sequences of the non-human DNA. This would be important both for identifying pathogens in the etiology of diseases as well as for identifying symbiotic microbes that have received little attention because they either do not cause disease or they only cause disease through their absence. Such an array could also identify non-human sequences generated through insertions, deletions and translocations in cancer where such lesions may be targeted for therapy [35,36]. A number of other approaches have been taken to identifying non-human organisms in human samples. Cellular organisms can be identified by sequencing the 16S rRNA genes in the sample [37-40], though this misses viruses. DeRisi and colleagues have developed an oligonucleotide array with 70-mers of highly conserved sequences within most fully sequenced virus families [41]. This was used to identify the SARS virus as a coronavirus[42,43], though the array may not identify novel viruses that are dissimilar from the known viral families. A brute force metagenomics approach involves sequencing all the DNA or RNA in the sample and removing any sequences that match the human genome [44-47]. Currently, efforts are proceeding to sequence all the microbes found in the human body [48].",

While sequence space coverage is clearly influenced by genome size and GC content, we have also shown that the human genome is more compact in sequence space than a random genome. This is probably the signature of molecular evolution. Our measurements of sequence space coverage and entropy allow for the comparison between genomes and between chromosomes within a genome. This has led to the detection of outliers that may help to reveal properties of organisms and chromosomes that are not currently understood. Coverage data can also be used in a negative selection algorithm to develop assays to detect novel microbes in tissue samples.",

Thus, we transformed GC content by taking the absolute value of (0.5 \u2013 GC content). These transformed variables were used as predictors of coverage in a multivariate linear regression that included an interaction term between the predictors. Both variables and their interaction were significant at p < 0.01. We used Cook's distance to identify the top 1% of genomes that have the strongest influence on the regression analysis. We excluded those five genomes and refit the multivariate regression model. We then used that model to predict the coverage values of the five excluded genomes based on their log genome sizes and GC content deviation from 0.5.

It is informative to consider the n-mer coverage of a random pseudo-human genome of the same length as the human genome and with the nucleotides A, C, G, and T appearing with equal frequency in the genome. This model is equivalent to a sequence of dinucleotides chosen by independent sampling from the set of sixteen dinucleotides {AA, AC, ..., TG, TT}, each dinucleotide selected with equal probability. This permits a more refined comparison with the human genome in view of features such as the marked depletion of CG dinucleotides in mammalian genomes [51], which are not captured by single nucleotide frequencies alone. As we shall see, however, from an analytical perspective, a consideration of dinucleotide frequencies makes very little difference to the conclusions. The n-mer space coverage of the pseudo-human genome will bound from above the corresponding n-mer space coverage of the human genome (see Figure 1), the discrepancy between the two providing evidence of statistical clustering or bunching of n-mers in the human genome. Such discrepancies in coverage are manifested in the entropy rate: the pseudo-human genome has entropy rate equal to the maximal value log2 4 or 2 bits per symbol and bounds from above the entropy rate of the human genome (Figure 5).",

The n-mer coverage for the actual distribution of nucleotide (or dinucleotide) frequencies is bounded below by the coverage of n-mer space by a uniform random sequence over an alphabet of size 5 as the probability 1/5 = 0.2 of selecting a given nucleotide (or probability 1/25 = 0.04 of selecting a given dinucleotide) from an alphabet of size 5 lies below the observed nucleotide (respectively, dinucleotide) frequencies in the human genome. We can get increasingly conservative bounds in this fashion by increasing the alphabet size as, under uniform selection, the nucleotide frequency decreases inversely proportional to alphabet size, while the dinucleotide frequency decreases inversely with the square of the alphabet size. The size of alphabet, however, makes little difference to the point where a phase transition in n-mer coverage is observed as the expression for the phase transition point for n is relatively insensitive to alphabet size (the expression for n depends only on the logarithm of the alphabet size). Consequently, random pseudo-human genomes with nucleotide and dinucleotide frequencies matching that of the human genome exhibit an essentially complete coverage of n-mers with n up to 13, with gaps in coverage occurring abruptly for n-mers of size 14 and beyond. For the analysis in Figure 1, we generated a random pseudo-human genome with the same dinucleotide frequencies as the human genome by using a first-order Markov process with transition probabilities that match the probabilities for each nucleotide following the previous nucleotide in the human genome. The substantial agreement of the stochastic simulation results for the pseudo-human genome in Figure 1 with the theoretical predictions serves to provide a validation of the sampling methodology.",
