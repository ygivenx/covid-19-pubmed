In 2016 the UK lost 34.0 million work days (33.1% of total) due to minor illnesses such as URTI3. An episode of URTI cost \u20ac266.41, \u20ac273.36 in Cardiff and Southampton respectively4. In the US, 72% of respondents had URTI in the past year costing $40 billion annually2. Outbreaks of respiratory tract infections are common in hospitals and care homes with significant morbidity and mortality5. URTI can lead to lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) such as pneumonia, or cause exacerbations in individuals with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cystic fibrosis6. Since URTI precedes LRTI, early intervention could prevent these complications.",

Hence, specific antiviral treatment is impractical, and we need an intervention effective against multiple viruses. Jalaneti (cleaning the nasal passages with salt water), an ancient practice from India is recommended in Yogic texts for the common cold8. A significant reduction in sore throats and colds was reported when Australian wood-workers performed Jalaneti for a year9. Three randomised controlled trials (RCT) report the efficacy of salt water for acute URTI. Adam et al. reported the lack of improvement in symptoms or duration of illness in adults with a common cold or bacterial rhinosinusitis [hypertonic saline (HS)/normal saline (NS) sprays thrice/day vs. standard care]. However, individuals with a common cold who received HS sprays said they would use it again (p = 0.007)10. Sea-water sprays (six-times/day) significantly reduced sore throat, nasal secretions, decongestant/mucolytic use in children with URTI11. A Cochrane review concludes that the evidence is very limited12. In a recent report, both NS and sea-water drops (thrice/day) reduced the severity of URTI symptoms in young children13.",

We have recently reported laboratory evidence that non-myeloid cells (e.g. epithelial, fibroblast and hepatic cells) have an innate immune mechanism, which is augmented in the presence of salt (NaCl)15. In cell culture models, DNA, RNA, enveloped and non-enveloped viruses are all inhibited in the presence of NaCl15. The antiviral effect is dependent on the availability of chloride ions (and not sodium ions)15. In the presence viral infection and the availability of NaCl, cells utilise the chloride ions to produce hypochlorous acid (HOCl)15. Since HOCl is the active ingredient in bleach, which is known to have an antiviral effect, the mechanism could be augmented by supplying chloride ions through NaCl to treat infections. Here, we report the results of the Edinburgh and Lothians Viral Intervention Study (ELVIS), a pilot RCT of hypertonic saline nasal irrigation and gargling (HSNIG) versus standard care in adults with URTI to determine if we can recruit and retain participants in Edinburgh and to get initial information on acceptability, duration of symptoms, and viral shedding.",

When individuals infected with similar viruses (rhinovirus, coronavirus, enterovirus and influenza virus) were compared, 30% more individuals had reduction in viral shedding by \u22650.5 log10 per day in the intervention arm. This could explain both the reduction in the duration of illness and transmission to household contacts in the intervention arm. However, though the difference between the baseline and end-point samples was larger in the intervention arm than the control arm, the difference was not significant (although this study was not powered to detect differences in these measures). In participants who stopped HSNIG before day four, 54% (7/13) had an increase in viral shedding. There was also an increase/stabilisation of symptoms in 50% (8/16) before symptoms resolved. In fact, four individuals felt the need to restart HSNIG for one or more days (Fig. 4). These finding along with the lower rate of symptomatic household contacts in the intervention arm suggest that HSNIG helps reduce viral replication.

We hence need a larger trial to confirm our findings. The lack of a placebo group is another limitation. Since our hypothesis was that the chloride ion has an antiviral effect, we were unable to use NS as a control as it could cause a reduction in symptoms. This is supported by results from earlier studies. For e.g. in a cross over trial (10 weeks twice daily nasal spray and 10 weeks without sprays with a two-week washout period), twice a day saline sprays significantly reduced nasal symptoms in military recruits compared to those with no intervention (p = 0.027). The number of episodes of URTI was lower in the period when saline sprays were used compared to the period when sprays were not used. However, the difference was just short of significance (p = 0.05)25. Our rationale also seems vindicated by a recent report suggesting that both sea water drops and saline drops were equally effective in treating children <2 years of age with URTI compared to symptomatic controls13. Sodium bicarbonate, though commonly used, is uncomfortable in the author\u2019s personal experience. Recent evidence suggests that sodium ion also has an antimicrobial effect26,27. Hence, until a safe and comfortable placebo that contain neither chloride, halide or sodium ion is identified, placebo-controlled trials cannot be done.",

We used self-collected mid-turbinate swabs (Copan, Italy) both for participants convenience (no gag reflex) and as the swabs are designed with a stop which increases safety and should help reduce variation in sampling28. Since nasal irrigation could physically wash off the virus, we collected swabs first thing in the morning before HSNIG. We used eNAT, a transport medium that inactivates viruses and in which samples are stable at room temperature for at least two weeks. In our hands, samples in eNAT were stable for at least a week at room temperature and could be posted back to the laboratory for testing29. Where we identified a virus in the baseline sample, we tested all five samples in the same run to minimise inter-assay variability. To compare viral shedding, we converted CT values to log10 values. The baseline samples were hence tested on two occasions. The inter-assay variation between the two results was very low [mean (SD): 0.21 log10 (1.17)]. The cut-off of \u22650.5 log10 per day used to determine reduction in viral shedding is more than double that of the inter-assay variation seen and hence is unlikely to be an artefact of the testing process. All these measures together have helped produce viral shedding data that could be compared between arms. In four individuals with a positive baseline sample, follow-up samples were negative. In two individuals a sample with a low CT (i.e. high viral copy) were followed by samples with undetectable virus. Since our consent did not include human DNA testing, we could not test for housekeeping genes and cannot be certain if these samples were properly collected. This need to be addressed in future studies.",

However, in patient groups where compliance might be an issue, compliance could be improved by using video monitoring of the procedures (HSNIG and collecting nasal swabs) via smart phones with support from the clinical team similar to the approach used for tuberculosis treatment34,35. The amount of salt used could also be measured at the end of the study. Tests for human DNA could be done to determine if swabs were actually collected before being introduced into the transport medium. Online data entry could be encouraged which would help reduce missing/incorrect data. Reminder messages (by text or email) could be sent to prompt regular data entry and return of samples. However, these decisions would need to be taken considering the population, the burden to the participant and the cost involved.",

Instructions on how to make the solution and perform HSNIG are in Supplementary Methods and in www.elvisstudy.com. Control arm managed URTI as they normally did. As the hypothesis was chloride ion mediated antiviral effect, normal saline could not be used as a placebo. As sodium bicarbonate was uncomfortable in the authors personal experience, we opted for not including a placebo arm. The rationale for not including a saline placebo arm is elaborated in the discussion. Participants documented OTCM use and were asked to contact to their GP if unwell. The trial nurse helped participants in the intervention arm identify the highest concentration of HS they were comfortable with (from 3%, 2.5%, 2.0% and 1.5%). Intervention arm were taught how to prepare HS and perform HSNIG with videos (www.elvisstudy.com) and given the opportunity to perform HSNIG under supervision. Cornish sea salt, digital-measuring spoon, bowls and flask were provided with instructions to perform HSNIG as many times as required (expected frequency up to 6 times/day for the first two days, reducing in frequency from day 3 as symptoms improved).",

Day 0 samples were initially tested. Where an agent was identified, all samples (day 0 \u2013 day 4) were tested in parallel and the cycle threshold value (CT value) converted to log10 to estimate change in viral shedding. CT was capped at 40 as samples with CT values above this level was unlikely to be positive on repeat testing. CT values were converted to log10 using this formula (40-CT of sample)/3.3 (a CT of 3.3 represents a log change in viral load by PCR). Since the baseline sample was tested on two separate occasions, reproducibility of testing was assessed by comparing the two results. Inter-assay variation was expected to be <0.5 log10. Where consecutive samples had undetectable virus, the first sample that was undetectable was treated as the end-point for viral shedding analysis. For the intervention arm, since NaCl could have an antiviral effect, the day with the lowest shedding when HSNIG was being performed was treated as the end-point. Where HSNIG was stopped earlier than 4 days, since swabs were collected first thing in the morning, the day after HSNIG was stopped was considered the end-point. Hence for the intervention arm, the end-point was day 4 [apart from participant numbers 1, 5, 7, 13, 16, 17, 18 and 19 where it was day 3; 2 (rhinovirus), 14, and 15 where it was day 2; and 11 and 12 where it was day 1].
