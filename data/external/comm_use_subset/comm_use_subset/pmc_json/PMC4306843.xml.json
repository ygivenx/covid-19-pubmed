For instance, influenza spreads around the world in seasonal epidemics, resulting in approximately three to five million yearly cases of severe illness and approximately 250,000 to 500,000 yearly deaths [1]. During the previous century, deadly viruses have caused pandemics worldwide on a number of occasions [2]. Moreover, new and re-emerging infectious viral diseases will pose a rising global health threat, and the risk of spreading these viruses between continents and countries is even larger [3]. HIV/AIDS, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and the recent 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza are only a few of many examples of emerging infectious diseases in the modern world [4].",

Vaccines form the basis for the prevention of many viral infections, but there are substantial drawbacks [5]. For the influenza virus only, vaccination failures have been widely documented, and in the elderly population, in which most of the mortality occurs, vaccines are only approximately 50% effective [6]. Moreover, in the eventuality of a pandemic infection with a new strain, antiviral drugs represent the first line of defense [7]. Due to their metabolic properties, viruses are difficult to control, and there are relatively few drugs for the treatment of viral diseases. However, the side effects associated with the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract, as well as the rapid emergence of antiviral resistance during therapy, has limited the usefulness of these drugs [8,9]. Therefore, innovative strategies and responses are required to come across the economic and human health risks associated with viral diseases.",

DMEM alone (untreated and virus-only groups), DMEM with 1000 U of recombinant mouse/human interferon (IFN)-\u03b2 (positive control, Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri, USA) and DMEM with 1.0 \u03bcg/mL (10 \u03bcL/mL or 1%) of Epimedium koreanum Nakai were incubated in different wells for the pre-treatment assay. At 12 h post-treatment (hpt), all of the wells were gently washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before infection. RAW264.7 cells were infected with either VSV-GFP (MOI = 1.0), PR8-GFP (MOI = 1.0), NDV-GFP (MOI = 3.0) or HSV-GFP (MOI = 3.0), using DMEM supplemented with 1% FBS. Additionally, HEK293T cells were infected with VSV-GFP (MOI = 0.005) and HSV-GFP (MOI = 2.0) viruses. Two hours post-infection (hpi), the unattached viruses were aspirated out with the supernatant, and the wells were gently washed with PBS. Then, DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution was added to the wells. GFP expression, which reflects virus replication, was observed at 24 h post infection (hpi) at 200\u00d7 magnification. The virus titration and cell viability were determined at both 12 and 24 hpi. The cell viability was determined via trypan blue exclusion, and the cell counts were performed in triplicate.",

A total aqueous extract of Epimedium koreanum Nakai-treated RAW264.7 cells (1 \u03bcg/mL (1% v/v)) exhibited a marked reduction in GFP expression, whereas the untreated groups had high levels of GFP expression for VSV (Figure 1A), PR8 (Figure 1B), NDV (Figure 1C) and HSV (Figure 1D).

These results correlate with the viral titers of VSV-GFP in the cell supernatant and the viral titers of PR8-GFP and HSV-GFP in infected cells. Epimedium koreanum Nakai treatment reduced the viral titers by nearly 1.5-fold, 1.8-fold and 2-fold against VSV-GFP, PR8-GFP and HSV-GFP at 24 hpi, respectively (Figure 1A\u2013C). Importantly, Epimedium koreanum Nakai-treated cells displayed a significant reduction in cell death following infection with all tested viruses compared with the untreated cells (Figure 1A\u2013D). In the case of NDV, we measured the mRNA expression of the NDV M gene via RT-PCR to estimate the replication (Figure 1C right panels) of NDV-GFP. As expected, the expression of the Matrix gene mRNA in the extract-treated cells was decreased in a time-dependent manner compared with the untreated group at 6\u201324 hpi.

To correlate these observations with the IFN-inducing signaling pathway, we examined the phosphorylation of interferon related signal molecules and p65 phosphorylation related to NF-kB activation. For this, immunoblot analyses were performed using whole cell lysates of extract-treated RAW264.7 cells. As shown in Figure 3C, Epimedium koreanum Nakai significantly upregulated the phosphorylation of IRF-3, STAT1, TBK1, p65, p38 and ERK, which are key signaling molecules belonging to the type I interferons (IFNs) and NF-\u03baB pathways. The phosphorylation of IRF3 is a key indicator of interferon signal transduction. Upon virus infection, the phosphorylated IRF3 translocated into the nucleus and initiated the transcription of type I interferons (IFNs). Consequently, the produced type I interferons (IFNs) binds to the JAK-STAT pathway, leading to the phosphorylation of STAT1 and the transcriptional activation of Interferon-stimulated gene (ISGs). These activated ISGs are then involved in controlling viral infection. Our results clearly demonstrate that treatment with the Epimedium koreanum Nakai extract can induce potent IRF3 phosphorylation at 8 hpt, the effect of which markedly increases with time. Furthermore, this increased STAT1 phosphorylation indicates the active functions of the ISGs. In addition to the activation of type I interferons (IFNs), the extract-treated RAW264.7 cells were able to elicit obvious activation of NF-\u03baB (P65), leading to strong secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The phosphorylation of these molecules induced by extracts is comparable to that obtained with LPS treatment, which is a known potent stimulator of TLR4.",

Moreover, at 8hpt, the IL-6 and OAS-16 transcriptional levels were observed to be up-regulated by 15-fold and 8-fold, respectively. In addition to the elevated levels of IFN-\u03b2, the extract induced the transcription of interferon-stimulatory genes (ISGs), such as ISG-15 and ISG-56 (14-fold and 5-fold), respectively at 8 hpt in RAW264.7 cells. The observed elevated transcriptional patterns for some of the antiviral genes were similar to the pattern of the IFN-\u03b2-treated positive controls. Furthermore, similar transcriptional activation patterns were observed in extract treated HEK293T cells. Interestingly, the highest fold inductions of cellular transcriptional levels were observed at 12 hpt for all the primers. Transcriptional levels of extract-treated HEK293T cells for IFN-\u03b2, GBP-1, IL-6, IL-8, ISG-15, Mx-1 and TNF-\u03b1 were up-regulated by 8-fold, 5-fold, 30-fold, 2-fold, 5-fold and 2-fold, respectively.

All these transcriptional patterns were similar to the pattern of human IFN-\u03b2-treated positive control.

Among marker compounds of Epimedium koreanum Nakai, quercetin and icariin have been representatively identified at 270 nm based on comparison to the standard compounds (14). Based on this, we tested the anti-influenza (PR8-GFP) effect of quercetin upon pre-treatment of the compound (5.0 \u03bcg/mL). Minimum effective dose of 5.0 \u03bcg/mL was chosen based on our preliminary experiments on the efficacy of quercetin (data not shown). Interestingly, treatment with quercetin markedly inhibited virus replication (Figure 6A). The quercetin-treated group displayed reduced GFP expression compared to untreated groups, which had high levels of GFP expression. The observed GFP data correlated with the viral titers where, quercetin treatment reduced the viral titers by nearly 3.5-fold against PR8-GFP at 24 hpi (Figure 6B). Furthermore, treatment of quercetin (5.0 \u03bcg/mL) had marked increase in cytokine secretion in RAW264.7 cells (Figure 6B). These data strongly suggest that quercetin, a major constituent of Epimedium koreanum Nakai, might be able to induce the antiviral state in cells and subsequent inhibition of virus replication.",

In the cytotoxicity of antiviral reagents, Epimedium koreanum Nakai has been used for human consumption for a long time, and side effects after a dose have rarely been reported. Importantly, Epimedium koreanum Nakai did not have any significant cytotoxic effect on the tested cell lines. Moreover, the cell cytotoxic concentration (CC50) of Epimedium koreanum Nakai was several magnitudes higher than the effective concentrations (EC50) and the selection indexes (SI) of Epimedium koreanum Nakai for various viruses indicate the higher safety margin of the extract for therapeutic and/or prophylactic purposes. First, we found that the total aqueous extract of Epimedium koreanum Nakai inhibited the replication of influenza (Figure 1B), VSV (Figure 1A and Figure 2A), NDV (Figure 1C), and HSV (Figure 1D and Figure 2B) viruses in immune cells (RAW264.7) and epithelial cells (HEK293T). Moreover, oral administration of Epimedium koreanum Nakai increased the survival rate of mice subjected to lethal challenges with different influenza A virus subtypes, including H1N1, H5N2, H7N3 and H9N2 (Figure 5). Although Epimedium koreanum Nakai-inoculated mice initially displayed little weight reduction, the majority of them did not lose more than 25% of their body weight. In contrast, all of the mice in the control groups displayed more than 25% losses within 9 dpi and were humanely killed. Influenza virus causes a rapid reduction in the body weight of infected mice. Therefore, 25% body weight loss is considered the humane end point for sacrificing influenza virus-infected mice [46]. These results suggest that Epimedium koreanum Nakai is sufficiently strong to inhibit viral replication and promoted the survival of mice against lethal infections of diverse influenza A viruses.",

However, an induced antiviral state by tight regulation will be a very important defense mechanism against virus infection [50].

Upon stimulation of the PRRs (Pattern Recognition Receptors) or unknown receptors of the host cell by foreign materials containing pathogens, downstream signal transduction activities, including activation of adaptor signal molecules or transcriptional factors, can initiate the induction of type I interferon and pro-inflammatory cytokines to up-regulate the antiviral status of the host cell [51,52]. In this study, we found that Epimedium koreanum Nakai treatment can induce the phosphorylation of IRF-3, STAT1 and TBK1 in a time-dependent manner, providing evidence of the downstream signal transduction in the type I IFN signaling pathway (Figure 3C). Additionally, the activation of NF-\u03baB (p65, pERK, p38), which leads to a strong secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, could also be observed. This phosphorylation can lead to the rapid production of type I IFNs and various inflammatory cytokines that play a pivotal role in stimulating the antiviral state and subsequent clearance of viruses [53].",

            "text": "RAW264.7 cells (mouse macrophages) are versatile immune system cells that play indispensable roles in both the innate and adaptive immune responses [56]. They exhibit various immune responses to pathogenic challenge, such as phagocytosis, cytokine secretion, antigen presentation, and adherence [57]. Because of their wide range of functions, macrophages have been extensively studied for their significant role in the immune system, particularly in antiviral response [58]. Moreover, the immune-stimulating effects of different substances have been well established in murine macrophage cells [23,59,60,61] and previous studies have elucidated the capacity of murine macrophages to achieve the antiviral state upon successful stimulation [22,62,63]. Consequently, we decided to use murine macrophages to evaluate the antiviral effect of the water-soluble herbal extract from Epimedium koreanum Nakai against divergent viruses. In contrast, human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells are epithelial cells which are less known for their relationship with the immune system. It is known that HEK293T cells have less prominent pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), especially Toll-like receptors (TLRs) [64]. This suggests that for activating the HEK293T cells, an active compound/s must penetrate the cell membrane and activate the receptors present in the cytoplasm. Therefore, it is clear that aqueous extract of Epimedium koreanum Nakai contains the components which can stimulate both the cell surface PRRs and cytoplasmic PRRs. Therefore, Epimedium koreanum Nakai which has the ability to modulate both RAW264.7 and HEK293T cells in a beneficial manner indicates its broad antiviral potential.",

In our previous study, we identified the main component of Epimedium koreanum Nakai as quercetin and icariin using HPLC [14]. Quercetin, the major active component of Epimedium koreanum Nakai, has been shown to inhibit porcine epidemic diarrhea virus [67,68]. Based on this lead, we tested quercetin for its antiviral activity and immune-modulatory properties. Quercetin displayed striking antiviral properties and induced cytokine secretion (Figure 6) confirming its importance to the observed biological properties. Therefore, the observed antiviral effects of Epimedium koreanum Nakai must be due to the presence of quercetin and other active compounds in Epimedium koreanum Nakai, and the relationship between mechanisms of antiviral effects and active compounds containing quercetin must be studied further.",
