Many have argued for the adaptive benefit of high mutation rates in pathogenic microbes, which often exist in dynamic environments and are subject to host immune pressure [7,24,25]. However, direct selection of a variant with a higher mutation rate will only occur if it has been advantageous in the past, and in many cases, it has been difficult to separate the causes of a higher mutation rate from its consequences [19,26].",

While interspecies mutation rates range from 10\u22124 to 10\u22126 errors per nucleotide copied [4], studies of antimutators and hypermutators suggests that fidelity can only vary by several-fold within a species [27]. The severe burden of mutational load exerts a strong downward pressure on mutation rates, and hypermutator strains are attenuated in vivo [9,28\u201331]. Given the short generation times and remarkable fecundity of many RNA viruses, a small kinetic cost to higher fidelity should result in strong selection against antimutators [32,33]. However, the observed attenuation of antimutator RNA viruses in vivo has led many to argue for the adaptive benefit of high mutation rates, as genetic diversity provides a rich substrate for a virus\u2019s evolution in the face of varying intrahost environments [7,10,34\u201338]. This concept is central to viral quasispecies theory, which generally proposes a link between genetic diversity and viral fitness [24,25].",

The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, 3D) of this variant contains a single glycine to serine substitution [5\u20137]. The basal mutation rate of 3DG64S is reported to be approximately 20% to 30% that of wild-type (WT) virus. While the 3DG64S mutant is attenuated in poliovirus receptor (PVR) transgenic mice, the relative importance of replicative speed and fidelity to this phenotype is not clear [7,36]. Biochemical assays of 3DG64S suggest a physicochemical cost of high fidelity, but as in other systems, its contribution to overall fitness remains unquantified [6,19,39].",

Here, the fitness of 3DG64S is 0.78 \u00b1 0.01 (n = 3 replicates) relative to WT. This is a moderate fitness defect, falling in the 64th percentile in a dataset of 8,970 fitness values obtained for point mutants of poliovirus under similar conditions [16] (e.g., human epithelial cells [HeLa] multiplicity of infection [MOI] 0.1, 8-hour infection cycle, and 6 passages; Fig 1B). We also measured the relative growth properties of WT and 3DG64S using a plaque-size assay, which measures the growth, burst size, and spread of individual viruses in the absence of competition [40\u201342]. The distribution of clonal plaque sizes was significantly different (p < 0.005; unpaired t test with Welch correction; n = 272 WT and n = 220 3DG64S plaques) and consistent with a moderate fitness defect in 3DG64S (Fig 1C). In contrast with prior work, we were able to detect a significant replication defect for 3DG64S by one-step growth curve, but only with rigorous synchronization, more frequent time points, and larger numbers of replicates (Fig 1D). This replication defect was not specific to HeLa because we observed a similar lag for 3DG64S in a 3T3 cell line that we derived from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from PVR mice (Fig 1E). These data demonstrate that the fitness defect of 3DG64S is largely attributable to its slower replicative kinetics and is consistent with biochemical assays on purified RdRp [6,39].",

The 3DG64S point mutant reverted to WT within 15 passages in 5 independent lineages (Fig 2A). We only observed partial reversion at passage 15 in a subset of 24-hour control lineages, in which virus populations underwent twice as many cellular infection cycles per passage and experienced reduced r-selection. We next asked whether r-selection would lead to genetic compensation of the fidelity phenotype in 3DG64S-3nt, which has all 3 positions in the codon mutated to minimize reversion. After 50 passages of r-selection, we identified fixed and polymorphic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) by next-generation sequencing of all r-selected and control (24-hour passage) populations of 3DG64S and WT (Fig 2B).",

Maximum likelihood optimization of a simple probabilistic model estimated an aggregate bottleneck size of 2.67 between the inoculum and the CNS (Fig 4A, S1 Text Model 2).

This lag persisted even when we infected with doses 20-fold higher than the median lethal dose (LD50) of 3DG64S (S3 Table). The difference in 3DG64S attenuation compared to prior work [7] does not appear to be due to the mouse model used because other studies in cPVR mice have reported results similar to those presented here [36,54]. Both viruses spread to the CNS and replicated to high titers after intravenous inoculation, although WT titers in the brain and spinal cord were marginally higher at 5 days post infection (Fig 4C, p = 0.0012 for brain and p = 0.0221 for spinal cord, Mann Whitney U test). We characterized the mutations present in the CNS populations of 12 spinal cords of intravenously infected mice (Fig 4D, 7 WT and 5 3DG64S). Most mutations were rare, none were shared among mice, and there was an excess of synonymous or noncoding variants relative to nonsynonymous ones.

Our quantitative model of the speed\u2013fidelity trade-off suggests that selection for replicative speed has pushed viral mutation rates to a level that imposes a significant fitness cost at baseline due to lethal or highly deleterious mutations. Consistent with the trade-off model, direct selection for increased replicative speed led to indirect selection of polymerases with higher mutation rates. The genetic interactions are quite strong because the 2 compensatory mutations exhibited reciprocal sign epistasis. The speed\u2013fidelity trade-off in the poliovirus RdRp appears to be a generalizable phenomenon because compensatory mutations that increased the replicative speed of the 3DK359H antimutator also increased its mutation rate (Table 1). Given the structural similarity among viral RdRp, the polymerases of other RNA viruses are likely to be subject to the same speed\u2013fidelity trade-off, and we predict that the molecular mechanisms governing polymerase kinetics and mutation rate will be similar.",

Studies of DNA replication and protein translation suggest that these systems optimize speed over accuracy as long as the error rates are within a tolerable range [57,58].

Similarly, we find that the proposed link between within-host genetic diversity and virulence is confounded by the fact that faster replicating viruses are both more virulent and have higher mutation rates. The high mutation rates of RNA viruses and the highly deleterious fitness effects of mutations ensure that most genetic diversity is extremely rare and unlikely to be consistently maintained in the face of intrahost and interhost bottlenecks [53]. We do not dispute that virus populations will harbor minority variants, that a subset of these mutations may be adaptive or beneficial to the virus, and that some may be virulence determinants. However, the observation of genetic diversity is not in and of itself evidence that selection has optimized mutation rates for the future benefit of novel mutations. Indeed, our data show little adaptive benefit to a marginally increased mutation rate and identify no plausible mechanism whereby the observed increase in rare genetic diversity can influence pathogenesis. We suspect that RNA viruses are subject to other trade-offs of evolutionary significance, perhaps between polymerase speed and recombination rate or between recombination rate and polymerase fidelity. Here too it will be important to define the selective forces at play, thereby separating the causes from the consequences.",

The heads and viscera were removed, and the body was minced with a sterile razor blade, trypsinized, and homogenized by pipetting with a 10 ml serological pipette. Cells were plated in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1x penicillin-streptomycin, and 1x glutamine. An immortalized cell line was derived from PVR MEFs following the 3T3 protocol [60]. Briefly, freshly thawed MEFs were plated in 30 T25 flasks at a density of 3.8 \u00d7 105 cells per flask in complete DMEM. Every third day, cells in each flask were trypsinized, counted, and transferred to fresh flasks at a density of 3.8 \u00d7 105 cells per flask. As the cellular population began to increase (passages 13\u201315), cells were expanded into larger vessels and ultimately frozen down at passage 17.",

Cells were infected at a total MOI of 0.1 with an equal TCID50 of WT and 3DG64S. Three replicate wells were infected with each pair of viruses in 250 \u03bcl for 1 hour with occasional rocking. After 1 hour, the inoculum was removed and 1 ml fresh media applied. Passage 1 virus was harvested after an additional 7 hours (8 hours since infection). The titer of the passage 1 virus was used to calculate the dilution factor necessary to maintain an MOI of 0.1 for the subsequent 5 passages. RNA was harvested from each passage using Trizol (Ambion 15596026). Random hexamers were used to prime cDNA synthesis with 1/10 of the RNA. Each cDNA was analyzed by qRT-PCR using 3 different primer and/or probe sets with duplicate PCR reactions for each sample and primer set.

Two custom TaqMan probes (Applied Biosystems) were used to quantify the number of WT and 3DG64S genomes. Duplicate wells were averaged, and relative amounts of WT and 3DG64S RNA were determined by normalizing the cycle thresholds for each of these probes to those of the COM primer set (\u0394Ct = CtVirus \u2212 CtCOM).

This relative Ct value was converted to reflect the fold change in the ratio (\u0394ratio = 2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct). The change in ratio of the mutant relative to the change in ratio of the WT as a function of passage is the fitness ([\u0394log ratioMut \u2212 \u0394log ratioWT]/time).

Each fluctuation test was performed with 29 replicate cultures in 48-well plates. A total of 65,000 HeLa cells per well were plated the day prior to infection. In all cases, the media were changed to serum-free media 3 hours prior to infection. For infections in ribavirin, this serum-free media also included drug at the specified concentrations. Each well was infected in 200 \u03bcl volume with 1,000 to 4,000 pfu per well depending on the virus and experimental condition. Five independent aliquots were also saved for subsequent titering (see Ni below). For infections in ribavirin, the infection media also included drug at the specified concentrations. Infected cells were incubated for 7 hours and then frozen. The lysed cells and media were harvested following 3 complete freeze\u2013thaw cycles and transferred to a microcentrifuge tube. The empty wells were rinsed with 300 \u03bcl of complete growth media and combined with the initial 200 \u03bcl lysate. This 500 \u03bcl lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 1,400 \u00d7 g for 4 minutes. Twenty-four wells were titered by plaque assay with 1 mM guanidine hydrochloride in the overlay (see P0 below). Five wells were titered by standard plaque assay without guanidine hydrochloride (see Nf below). The mutation rate, \u03bc0, was estimated from these data using the P0 null-class model: \u03bc0 = \u2212lnP0/(Nf-Ni), where P0 was the fraction of the cultures that yielded no guanidine-resistant plaques, Nf was the average number of pfu in the absence of guanidine, and Ni was the average number of pfu in the inoculum. As described in [65], \u03bc0 can be converted to the mutation rate in nucleotide units by correcting for the mutation target (number of mutations leading to the scored phenotype, T) and the number of possible mutations at each target site (constant, 3) using the equation \u03bc = 3\u03bc0/T. The number of distinct mutations that could yield the guanidine-resistant phenotype was determined empirically by isolating and sequencing the entire 2C open reading frame for 15 guanidine-resistant plaques derived from WT virus and 15 guanidine-resistant plaques derived from WT virus treated with 200 \u03bcM ribavirin. In each case, we found 6 mutations that mediated resistance, although there were 7 total among 30 plaques (S1 Table).",

For PVR-3T3 cells, serial passages were performed as follows. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 7.6 \u00d7 105 cells per well the day prior to infection, yielding approximately 1 \u00d7 106 the day of infection. Serial passage lineages were initiated with passage 1 stocks of either WT or 3DG64S, and each passage was performed at an MOI of 0.5 in 1 ml for 1 hour. After 1 hour, the inoculum was aspirated, the cells were washed twice with PBS, and 2 ml of fresh growth media were applied. Viruses were harvested at 24 hours and titered every fourth passage to ensure an MOI of 0.5. There were 5 replicate lineages of WT and 3DG64S.",
