As a result, it is possible to quantitate single DNA target molecules. We utilize the digital array, which is a novel nanofluidic biochip [2], [3] where digital PCR reactions can be performed (Figure 1) by partitioning DNA molecules, instead of diluting them. This chip utilizes integrated channels and valves that partition mixtures of sample and reagents into 765 nanolitre volume reaction chambers. DNA molecules in each mixture are randomly partitioned into the 765 chambers of each panel (the total volume of the PCR mix in each panel: 6 nl\u00d7765 = 4.59 \u00b5l). The chip is then thermocycled and imaged on Fluidigm's BioMark real-time PCR system and the positive chambers that originally contained 1 or more molecules can be counted by the digital array analysis software (Figure 2).",
