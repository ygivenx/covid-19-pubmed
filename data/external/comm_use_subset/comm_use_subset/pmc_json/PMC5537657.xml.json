            "text": "Zika virus (ZIKV) belongs to the Flavivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family, which contains many viruses that cause human diseases, such as dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, and West Nile encephalitis [1]. After ZIKV was first isolated in Uganda in 1947 [2], ZIKV infection was regarded as asymptomatic [3], until outbreaks of febrile disease in the Yap Islands of the Federated States of Micronesia, French Polynesia, and Oceania occurred in 2007 [4]. After French Polynesia reported autochthonous cases of ZIKV infection in 2013, the virus began to spread rapidly [5]. In 2015, ZIKV was reported in Brazil, causing extensive concern owing to the number and severity of cases [6]. Recent studies have indicated that, in addition to mosquito transmission, ZIKV could spread through sexual contact, blood transmission, and mother-to-child transmission [7], in which a short period of viremia is followed by spread to various organs, leading to various complications, such as the neurological autoimmune disorder Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) and microcephaly in the infants of mothers infected during pregnancy [8,9]. As a result, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that Zika virus and associated consequences still remain a significant enduring public health challenge requiring intense action [10]. According to the WHO, since 2015, 84 countries and territories reported evidence of vector-borne ZIKV transmission and more than 60 global and local partners are contributing to the ZIKV response [11].",

Thus, it is necessary to establish an animal model to investigate the pathogenic mechanism and to develop treatment and prevention strategies. Several ZIKV animal models have been studied [15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26], but they have various limitations. Susceptible animal models for ZIKV infection or disease were first studied in the 1950s using rhesus macaques [2]. Mice deficient in the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptors (A129) or IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and \u0194 receptors (AG129) [16,17,18] are expensive and have a narrow range of applications owing to incomplete immunoregulatory mechanisms. Accordingly, a more economical and broadly applicable murine model is urgently needed. ",

KM are outbred, but exhibit minimal variation in growth and reproductive performance, and C57BL/6 and BALB/c are inbred strains. KM was first originated from Swiss mice, which is applied for toxicology and neurology studies [27,28]. Nowadays, KM is the most highly produced in China; it is used in pharmacology and toxicology studies owing to its high yield, good quality, resistance, and strong adaptability. Especially, for Chinese researchers, owing to its flexible neurological signs and symptoms, KM is useful in neurophysiology and neuroethology in the study of congenital human cytomegalovirus infection [29], dementia, anxiety neurosis, stroke, etc. [30,31]. Additionally, KM is also a usage model for central nervous system (CNS) research, like neural tube defects and apoptosis of cerebral nerve cells induced by stimulants. Considering the preferential homing of ZIKV to the CNS, KM is an important candidate for studying CNS damage caused by ZIKV infection. C57BL/6 is widely used in physiological and pathological research [32,33]. Huang et al. have reported that intracranial injections of ZIKV into C57BL/6 during maximal brain growth cause microcephaly and corticospinal neuron apoptosis [34]. Moreover, Manangeeswaran et al. have initially studied the neurodegeneration in the CNS of immunocompetent neonatal C57BL/6, with the results that such an immunocompetent mice can also have susceptibility to ZIKV [35]. BALB/c, which is widely used to prepare the monoclonal antibody, is broadly used in immunological research, especially in vaccine testing of hepatitis C virus (HCV) [36], severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [37], Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [38], and so on. Furthermore, as a common mouse model of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [39], Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) [40], and influenza virus [41], BALB/c is believed to be a feasible animal model for ZIKV infection.

            "text": "Although all of the strains above are immunocompetent mice, even at their birth, their applicability as new models of ZIKV infection is worth exploring. Semple et al. presented that the stage of CNS development of new born mice was equal to that of a human mid-term fetus [42]. Neonatal rodents were found to have strong susceptibility to Chikungunya virus [43], Arenavirus [44], Borna disease virus (BDV) [45], etc. Rossi et al. [17] connected the infection efficiency with the growth process of mice, and showed that juvenile mice are more susceptible to ZIKV. Recently, an immunocompetent neonatal C57BL/6 mouse model for ZIKV infection was initially proposed [35]. We have reasons to believe that choosing suckling immunocompetent mice as a potential ZIKV infection animal model has infinite potential. Instead, interferon (IFN) deficient models do have their superiority with more severe clinical manifestations. However, the profound immunological defects in these strains do confuse us with question regarding how much of a difference in IFN response will make in the natural pathogenic mechanism of ZIKV. Considering that pathogenicity of Flavivirus may be decided not just by the effect of the virus but by the immune response it triggers [46], and an immunocompetent mouse model is urgently needed in order to discover the pathogenesis of ZIKV. Thus, we developed an inventive and normative infective method of ZIKV, i.e., multi-subcutaneous infection. After injecting ZIKV multi-subcutaneously into the backs of suckling mice, we observed signs and symptoms, organ distributions, and pathological changes to determine the application of suckling mouse models to ZIKV infection research. These suckling mouse models represent an important step toward understanding severe neurological outcomes and may be useful for drug screening, vaccine tests, and general ZIKV research. Additionally, by avoiding confounding factors, like transplacental infection and consequent placental insufficiency in brain development, such a neonatal mouse model will contribute to enhancing the understandings about the clinical outcomes of those who are infected in late pregnancy or early childhood.",

These phenotypes were referred to as movement disorders (MD) (Movie S3 and S4) and led to the highest morbidity, 100% (Figure 2A,D). After 3\u20135 days, all mice entered the exacerbation stage; they maintained a seriously hunched posture, tiptoe standing position, jumped while walking, easily fell, and were difficult to turn over. We referred to these phenotypes as serious movement disorders (SMD) (Figure 2D,G, Movie S5). The symptoms of most of the mice (37/45) visibly worsened; mice lost movement abilities, struggled to stand, consistently fell, and finally maintained a side-lying position. They commonly died within 24 h and were described as \u201cendangered mice.\u201d Remaining eight mice who were able to stand during exacerbation finally tended to recover, with a single symptom remaining, i.e., a hunched posture.

ZIKV-infected patients not only exhibit common symptoms, but also show occasional neurological manifestations, including GBS and, in particular, microcephaly in infants [49]. Dirlikov et al. [50] analysed 32 cases and summarized the GBS phenotypes associated with ZIKV, such as hyporeflexia or areflexia, leg weakness or paresthesia, arm weakness or paresthesia, and dysphagia. Similar to our results, during onset, C57BL/6 mice were unable to maintain balance, often swayed, and fell, indicating a connection with upper or lower limb weakness. Endangered mice were unresponsive, and this might be related to hyporeflexia or areflexia. In comparison, Manangeeswaran et al. injected suckling C57BL/6 with 2 \u00d7 103 PFU ZIKV at day 1 of age, their results had interesting differences with ours. With similar neurological manifestations like unsteady gait, loss of balance and ataxia, their C57BL/6 develop their symptoms around 13 days post infection, and recover two weeks later [35]. Instead, our C57BL/6 have especial exacerbation period after their common onset, which may be due to complex influencing factors. Owing to a lack of diagnostic criteria for GBS in mice, further studies of the relationship between this neurological manifestation and GBS are needed. Moreover, the morbidity reached 100%, supporting the feasibility of C57BL/6 as an animal model for ZIKV infection. Although the morbidity of KM was 61.1%, all invalid mice presented neurological symptoms, such as lower limb weakness. The morbidity of BALB/c mice was only 39.4%, with non-uniform signs and symptoms, but a slight yellow extraocular exudate was detected in some of the remaining unaffected individuals, suggesting the presence of ocular changes. Interestingly, non-purulent conjunctivitis is one of the clinical features [49] of ZIKV infection. Ventura et al. [51] analysed three cases of maculopathy along with microcephaly in children with suspected congenital Zika infection, and de Paula et al. [52] and Miranda et al. [53] reported ocular findings in infants with microcephaly associated with presumed ZIKV congenital infection. Miner et al. [25] found that ZIKV infection in mice causes pan-uveitis with shedding of the virus in tears. Unfortunately, the lack of ocular symptom diagnosis, the difficulty in acquiring excretion and tear samples in suckling mice, and incomplete periocular tissue sections limited our ability to systematically explain the ocular findings in BALB/c mice, and the mechanism should be examined in future studies.",

Clinical cases involving foetuses and infants exhibit cerebellar hypoplasia, microglial nodules, and neuronal and glial cell degeneration and necrosis [54], similar to our observations in mice. For example, eosinophilic necrosis of several neurons in the cerebrum and cerebellum was found, and the molecular layer of the cerebrum showed apparent glial cell nodules. Such necrosis and nodules suggest viral replication based on previous findings that ZIKV replicates in both neurons and astroglial cells [55], but this should be confirmed in future studies. Additionally, the cerebellum of C57BL/6 mice had more serious necrosis than the cerebrum. The cerebellum maintains balance, modulates muscle tone, and coordinates voluntary movements, potentially explaining the obvious imbalance and lack of coordination in C57BL/6 mice. Additionally, Purkinje cells as ghost cells were detected in both C57BL/6 and KM mice, but not in BALB/c mice. Purkinje cells are the only neurons that provide outflow and play important roles in motion coordination; they are probably involved in the dyskinesia in C57BL/6 and KM mice. Moreover, lymphocytic infiltration in KM suggested an inflammatory response, similar to the pathological changes reported in clinical cases [54]. Abundant neutrophil infiltration in the arachnoid tissue of C57BL/6 mice indicated acute meningeal infection, in agreement with meningoencephalitis detected in clinical settings [56,57].",

Gourinat et al. [58] found that, compared to serum, the virus could be detected in urine for a longer period of up 10 days and even more than 20 days. In general, through glomerular filtration, tubular resorption, and secretion, urine is derived from blood. Therefore, virus-free serum should correspond to urine without virus. However, after the virus was cleared from the serum, the urine of patients still contained detectable virus, which suggests that ZIKV replication also occurs in human kidneys. Due to the small quantity of urine available from suckling mice, we were not able to determine virus loads in the urine in the present study. However, there is another possibility that biological components in serum which will affect virus replication, different from urine. Additionally, following the kidney, urine will pass the ureters, bladder, and urethra, so we cannot credit the kidney with this discovery. In our study, we did not lucubrate about virus clearance mechanism in serum and urine formation mechanism, so the role that the kidneys play in ZIKV infection still needs further exploration. ",

Even after apparent clearance of the virus from the blood, viral RNA was detected in the urine and saliva for a certain period, and the virus in the cerebrospinal fluid and plasma was suddenly detected after initial clearance. These results indicate that ZIKV could persist for longer durations in certain tissues at low levels, suggesting its storage in certain parts of the body. Our results indicated that viremia in C57BL/6 mice persists for 14 days, and after apparent clearance of the virus in the serum, ZIKV could persist for longer durations in the brain and spleen, indicating that there might be a \u2018container\u2019 for ZIKV. By contrast, viremia in KM and BALB/c mice only continued for seven days. Musso et al.

ZIKV-infected C57BL/6 suckling mice without gene defects or immunosuppression exhibited phenotypes that were most similar to the natural infection status. The highest morbidity (100%), distinctive and easily observable neurological symptoms, regular viral loads in organs, and pathological changes suggested the feasibility and practicality of this animal model. Most of all, with incubation, onset, exacerbation and recovery, our C57BL/6 provide more administration phases and relevant assessment standards for potential therapeutics testing. Additionally, as inbred mice, which benefit from genetic homogeneity and low variation among individuals, C57BL/6 could withstand repeated experiments, and easy to breed at low costs and could be widely applied for drug screening and vaccine tests. By contrast, in spite of lower morbidity, the onset of KM mice exhibited uniform neurological manifestations. With widespread applications in life science research in China, and a long enough prodromal phase for medication around 8\u201310 days, KM will be an acceptable animal model for Chinese scholars. Despite the low morbidity and non-uniform clinical features, BALB/c mice have unique ocular symptoms which are similar to clinical cases. As a potential useful ZIKV-associated ocular manifestation animal models, BALB/c offers the option of testing conditions that may lead to clinical ocular findings. Despite the application mentioned above, we should also be very cognizant of the limitation that discoveries in such a ZIKV-infected suckling mice model may not be extrapolate to the physiological complications largely found in adults, driving us to conduct further research.",
