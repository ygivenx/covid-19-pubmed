Our previous study has demonstrated an association between mannose-binding lectin (MBL) genetic deficiency and cryptococcal meningitis in HIV-uninfected patients [4]. However, MBL deficiency was present in only 21% of the cases, and for the remaining 79% of patients the underlying mechanism for susceptibility remained unclear.",

FCGR2A 131R/R had been reported to attribute to the susceptibility of meningococcal infection, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) caused by Haemophilus influenza, and the development of severe malaria [10]\u2013[12]. FCGR2A 131H/H was reported to contribute to higher risk of bacteremia in pneumococcal CAP patients [13]. Another study showed that HIV-infected patients with FCGR2A 131R/R genotype progressed to a low CD4+ cell count at a faster rate, but conversely in individuals carried FCGR2A 131H/H there was an increased risk of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia [14]. FCGR3A 158F/V gene polymorphism was not associated with progression of HIV infection, but predicted the risk of Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma [14]. A study on infections during induction chemotherapy found that FCGR2A 131H/H was associated with a decreased risk of pneumonia, FCGR3B NA1/NA1 associated with infections, and FCGR3A polymorphisms not associated with infections [15]. Sadki et al. investigated the influence of FCGR3A 158V/F and FCGR2A 131H/R polymorphisms on susceptibility to pulmonary tuberculosis in the Moroccan population but no association was found [16]. A study in East Africa found that the FCGR2B 232T/T genotype provided protectiveness for children against severe malaria [17].",

Patients who had no microbiological or pathological documentation but present with positive cryptococcal antigen titer (\u22651\u223610) in CSF and met at least one of the following criteria were regarded as probable cryptococcal meningitis: (1) abnormal laboratory tests or an increased open pressure (\u2265200 mmH2O) of CSF, (2) abnormalities of cranial imaging (Computerized Tomography or Magnetic Resonance Imaging) which could not be explained by other factors, and (3) comorbidities that compromise the host immune system. Cryptococcal antigen was determined using diluted CSF with the Latex-Cryptococcus antigen detection system (Immuno-Mycologics). Patients and volunteers were assessed for predisposing factors as follow, immunocompromising diseases (liver cirrhosis, chronic kidney diseases, autoimmune diseases, malignancies, solid organ transplantation) [2], [3], [43], and corticosteroid (at prednisone equivalent dose of >0.3 mg/kg/day of for >3 weeks) or immunosuppressive medications (within 90 days before onset of cryptococcal meningitis) [44], and idiopathic CD4+ T lymphocytopenia (unexplained CD4+ T lymphocytopenia with CD4+ T lymphocyte count <300 cells/mm3) [45]. Diabetes mellitus was also included, although this common condition is a controversial predisposing factor [3], [46].
