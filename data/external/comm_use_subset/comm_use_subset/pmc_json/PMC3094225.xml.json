RSV is associated with substantial morbidity in children in both the hospitalized and outpatient setting [2-5]. In addition to the toll on the health of the population, this disease imposes a large burden on the health care system in terms of human and material resources. Although no RSV vaccine exists, infants and children with risk factors for severe RSV infection (eg, lung disease or prematurity) can receive monthly doses of palivizumab, a humanized murine anti-RSV monoclonal antibody, during the RSV season. Palivizumab treatment is extremely costly; the cost-effectiveness of this therapy could be improved if treatment is given only during times of high RSV activity. Treatment of vulnerable individuals also improves overall health in the population.",

This cycle is currently used to gauge upcoming RSV seasonal epidemic size based on total size of the previous epidemic season. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) researchers using the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System found that the prior epidemic season's data were a relatively imprecise predictor of the epidemic season onset in a given community and that timing of the RSV epidemic season may vary substantially in the same year among communities in close proximity [7]. One goal of this research was to explore year-to-year variation in epidemic seasons using local data. The biennial variation in our seasonal epidemic data was seen in the early exponential growth rates (slope of the cumulative case curves, Figure 1) as well as total epidemic size. We explored the relationship between exponential growth of RSV epidemics and the seasonal epidemic characteristics of total epidemic size, days to peak, and epidemic length to assess predictions made early in the epidemic season.",

These methods are being increasingly applied to emerging threats like SARS [10-12] and pandemic influenza, but their application to routine epidemics of common respiratory viruses like seasonal influenza and RSV has only begun to be explored. Weber et al. [8] model RSV transmission to examine how climate and social factors influence transmission in a population. They consider compartmental models using Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible (SIRS) with additions to include latency and stages of susceptibility. They find no single best model for RSV epidemics; many \"competing\" models fit the observed data well. We further explored the variation in seasonal epidemics using compartmental models. The variation in exponential growth could potentially be related to variation in transmission rates, epidemic start dates, or proportions susceptible as well as a host of other factors.",

Test results were used to inform patient cohorting and isolation procedures and to assist with medical management. All samples were initially tested by direct fluorescent antibody staining (DFA).

The exponential growth rate was calculated at four weeks to assess regression predictions made early in the season. For comparison, exponential growth rate was also calculated at weeks one through six. The total epidemic size was the sum of cases over the epidemic year, including sporadic inter-epidemic cases. An observable seasonal epidemic start date of t0 was defined as the start of the first week of the epidemic year with at least five confirmed RSV cases. This was the definition used by the hospital epidemiologists at PCMC to declare the start of RSV outbreaks during the study period. The term seasonal epidemic refers to the period from the epidemic start date until the epidemic end date, defined as the end of the last week of the epidemic year with at least five confirmed RSV cases. The number of days until the peak for the epidemic seasons was calculated as the midpoint day of the largest seven-day moving average window minus the epidemic season start day.

This SEIDR model was applied to a series of seven epidemic years. The population was split into children less than two years old (children) and those older than two (adults). It has been shown that the initial RSV infection is the most severe and occurs in almost every child in their first two years of life. Transmission is modeled as a function of time using a cosine function to mirror the cyclic nature of epidemics [8]. There is an offset to this cycle (\u03b1), which we estimate along with transmission parameter (\u03b2). Births and deaths (\u03bc) are accounted for in the susceptible class only. Achievement of age two is accounted for in all age-separated classes (\u03b7). Assumptions of simple compartmental models that we made were as presented in Koopman [15].",

The biennial cycle of large, early, and short seasonal epidemics followed by smaller, later, and longer seasonal epidemics the next year observed in Utah is similar to other published studies of seasonal RSV epidemics in temperate climates. The theories for this phenomenon include the existence and switching of two RSV disease strains, climate patterns, and waning immunity after infection [6,8,9,22-24]. These and other theories could be investigated in more complex models. It is understood that immunity after infection of RSV is partial, at best. This incomplete immunity and severity of re-infections could be incorporated into more complex models [8,25].

The seven years of data were not sufficient to make conclusive statements on the nature of the relationships. These early findings based on just seven data points can be built upon to explore early prediction of the upcoming RSV epidemic season. These early predictions could be used by hospitals to budget and allocate resources and to coordinate the timing of palivizumab treatment. They can be used by public health to advise clinicians and the public and also to help identify non-standard epidemics earlier in the season. For example, health departments might take specific actions if the number of observed cases during the season greatly exceeds early predictions.",
