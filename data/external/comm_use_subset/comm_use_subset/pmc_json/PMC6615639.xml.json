Over 2.5 billion people are at risk for infection in over 100 countries, 50\u2013100 million are infected with symptoms, and up to 50,000 die from dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) each year [1,2]. No specific antiviral drug has been available against DENV infection; the only approved vaccine, Dengvaxia, has caused considerable controversy regarding its safety and potential benefits [3\u20136]. For decades, anti-DENV vaccine and biological drugs development has been hampered by the high sequence divergence (25\u201340%) among the four DENV serotypes [7,8]. Such divergence leads to the fact that one antibody may not be sufficient to neutralize all DENV infection. Instead, the induced humoral immune response to one DENV infection can enhance the infection and disease processes brought by a subsequent infection with another DENV serotype [2\u20134]. These findings suggest that the development of new and broadly neutralization antibodies against all the serotypes of DENV could be promising candidate anti-DENV agents, and may also guide the design of effective and safe vaccine immunogens.",

            "text": "The DENV envelope glycoprotein (E protein), which mediates virus entry into cells, is the major neutralizing target of antibodies [9\u201313]. E protein is a type II fusion protein and consists of three domains: DI, DII, and DIII of which DIII has been proposed to contain a receptor binding domain [14\u201317]. Recent studies revealed that cross-reactive conserved epitopes exist on DII as well as DIII of the DENV E protein [14,16\u201318]. During the naturally-occurring primary DENV infection, a large fraction of the antibody repertoire consists of DII-specific antibodies which are, unfortunately, typically poor in neutralization and may increase the likelihood of severe disease upon subsequent infection through a mechanism known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) [18\u201320]. In contrast, antibodies targeting DIII have proven to be the most potent neutralizing antibodies, but very few could be elicited in naturally infected individuals [18,19,21\u201335]. Despite this, previous studies indicated that anti-DENV DIII serotype-specific and cross-reactive antibodies could be elicited using DENV DIII as vaccine immunogen [36\u201343] and in infected humans [44\u201347]. It has also been demonstrated that the lysine at position 310 on DIII is the critical residue in the cross-reactive epitope [24]. Therefore, the conserved epitope on DIII represents an attractive target for the development of broadly neutralizing DENV antibodies.",

A competitive sorting strategy using a DIII mutant as competitor was applied to identify antibodies precisely targeting the conserved neutralizing epitope. To our knowledge, m366.6 is the first human mAb isolated from a na\u00efve antibody library which could neutralize all the four serotypes DENV viruses. Importantly, both heavy and light chain genes of m366.6 are very close to their putative germline predecessors. Its fully human origin, the germline-like nature, combined with high-affinity and broad neutralizing activity toward all DENV serotypes, suggest that m366.6 is a promising candidate antiviral agent and may also provide a unique template for designing effective dengue vaccine immunogens.",

In this study, we used a competitive library sorting strategy to isolate broadly neutralizing antibodies against DENV1-4 (Fig 1A and 1B). The yeast-displayed na\u00efve single chain antibody fragment (scFv) library was used to screen against the biotinylated DENV DIII, and, importantly, ten times concentration unbiotinylated DIII K310E mutant was used as the competitor. The yeast cells were selected to present the antibody-expressing cells that could bind well to the wild-type DIII instead of the DIII mutant, resulting in the isolation of antibodies that can target the cross-reactive neutralizing epitopes covering the residue Lysine310 [55]. Potent enrichment was achieved after four rounds of sorting, and a panel of antibodies were identified (Fig 1B). Two antibodies, designated as m360 and m366, bound potently to DENV DIIIs. Their scFv gene were fused with human IgG1 Fc for protein expression, and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments were used to evaluate the antigens binding. The equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of m360 for the DENV1-4 DIIIs were 5.8 nM, 5.1 nM, 0.1 nM and 8.3 nM, respectively. The mAb m366 displayed a broader binding profile compared with that of m360, with the KD of 3.3 nM, 1.2 nM, 1.1 nM and 12 nM to DENV1-4, respectively (Table 1, S1 and S2 Figs).",

Notably, the m366.6 exhibited high affinity to all the DENV DIIIs. The KD of m366.6 for the DENV1-4 were 0.8 nM, 0.3 nM, 0.3 nM, and 1.9 nM respectively, which demonstrated that m366.6 could bind to all the four serotype DENV viruses with high avidity (Table 1, Fig 2).

These animals were monitored for morbidity and mortality daily.

We selected the three top scored docked complexes that contained the key residues identified from an experimental epitope mapping approach. One of the top scored docked models exhibited minimum clashes with appropriate protein interface parameters and was used to demonstrate the lactation the potential epitopes and their interactions with m366.6 antibody, which might shed light on the molecular mechanisms of broadly cross-reactive neutralization. Fig 6D showed the docking model of the DIII-m366.6 antibody complex in which these epitopes are highlighted in green surfaces. The docking model revealed a different orientation of antibody binding as compared to the DIII complex structure with Fab 1A1D-2 that was previously determined [35]. The epitope comprised of three structurally proximal regions, residues 305\u2013311 in green, 325, 327 and 361 in dark green, and 383\u2013385 at the C-terminal in lime. One of the key residues, K310, contacts the CDR-L1 of m366.6 which has a germline mutation. In Env-DIII-Fab-1A1D-2 complex structure, the residue K310 contacts the CDR-H1. The hydrophobic residues, Ile and Trp, of CDR-H3 contact the center part of the epitope, and other loops H1, H2, L2 and L3 also involve in the binding. The surface area of the interface between DIII and m366.6 antibody in the model complex is 716 \u00c52, a typical of antibody-antigen interactions. There are six hydrogen bonds likely to form and no salt bridges at the interface. In brief, the binding regions of the m366.6 may be close to or partially overlaps the dimerization interface between domains II and III, which might indicate the broad cross-reactivity of m366.6 to the four serotypes of DENV.",

At present, there are many therapeutic antibodies to treat viral infections under development, such as antibodies for HIV-1, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Nipah and Hendra viruses, and H7N9 influenza virus [48,50,60\u201366]. Fortunately, screening antibodies from the large na\u00efve libraries has enabled the rapid development of high-affinity human mAbs, especially for the rapid response to the outbreak of emerging viruses and diseases. We recently successfully identified two human germline-like mAbs against MERS-CoV and H7N9 influenza virus from the na\u00efve library, named m336 and m826, respectively [48,50]. They both can naturally exist with very low level of somatic hypermutation in the na\u00efve library with which they have potent binding activity against the envelop proteins of MERS-CoV and H7N9 influenza virus. Most importantly, m336 and m826 all showed highly therapeutic effective in the animal models. Therefore, the na\u00efve library screening can be quickly used to isolate germline-like antibodies that effectively bind to complex protein targets like those in DENV viruses.",

            "text": "How to increase the neutralization breadth is a key issue in developing anti-DENV antibodies. Previous studies revealed two classes of broadly neutralizing antibodies to flaviviruses, including antibodies targeting the conserved epitopes in DII or DIII [16\u201318,20]. While the conserved fusion loop epitope (FLE) in DII is the immunodominant epitope in E protein, unfortunately, this epitope frequently induced poorly neutralizing and strongly infection-enhancing antibodies via ADE [18\u201320]. Therefore, DIII represents the ideal target for neutralizing antibodies. In this study, we applied a highly efficient yeast-display-based sorting strategy by using the highly diverse DENV DIIIs as antigen and the competitive sorting technique. By applying this method, we quickly and efficiently identified two human germline-like broad-spectrum anti-DENV mAbs (m360 and m366) from the na\u00efve scFv yeast library using the DIII antigen that make them as promising candidate therapeutics as well as the template for vaccine development. Another class of highly efficient broadly neutralizing antibodies that target the envelope dimer epitopes (EDE) from the secondary acute DENV infection plasmablasts has been identified by Dejnirattisai et al. [67]. These antibodies may especially get through with high somatic mutations from the secondary virus infection. Compared with the highly somatically mutated antibodies, germline-like antibodies typically have better safety and drug-related property [59]. Importantly, the Hendra and Nipah antibody m102.4 is a near germline antibody and exhibited a very good drugability, which was from a similar library that was also used to isolate our m366 and m366-like antibodies. m102.4 was successful as a candidate therapeutic mAb in animal models and was also completed the phase I clinical trial (ACTRN12615000395538) without side effects [64]. To further improve the affinity of m366 with the four serotypes DENV DIIIs, we subjected m366 to affinity maturation process, and named it as m366.6. Subsequently, we analyzed m366.6 sequence using the IMGT tool to identify its closest VH and V\u03bb germline genes. Interestingly, we found that m366.6 is still a germline-like antibody although it went through the mutation process in vitro, with over 95% identities of its VH and V\u03bb genes to the IGHV3-21*01 and IGLV3-21*01 germline respectively.",

Cells were subsequently fixed in lysed and analyzed for luminescent reporter expression using the Wallac Victor. The percent infection for each concentration of mAb or serum was calculated, and the raw data was expressed as percent infection versus log10 of the mAb concentration or the reciprocal serum dilution. The data were fit to a sigmoidal dose-response curve using Prism (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) to determine the titer of antibody that achieved a 50% reduction in infection.

The VH-VL orientation of m366.6 scFv structure was assigned similar with one of the templates (PDB code: 2DD8) that showed minimum steric clash for creating the final m336.6 scFv model. The crystal structure of DENV DIII serotype 2 (PDB code: 2R29) was used for docking with the modeled scFv antibody m366.6. Docking of scFv m336.6 to the dengue Env-III was performed by ZDOCK server (http://zdock.bu.edu) that uses a fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based rigid-body protein docking algorithm with scoring functions combining pairwise shape complementarity, desolvation and electrostatic energies. Based on the escape mutants that led to the loss of epitopes and available crystal structure of DENV DIII, we selected a list of residues as biological constrains, 307, 309, 310, 311, 327, 361 and 383, on the surface of Env-DIII as potential contacting residues for docking constraints. Similarly, one or two residues from each of CDR-H1, H3 and L3 loops were chosen at the docking interface. CDR-H1 and H3 loops had dominant hydrophobic residues whereas CDR-L1 had a germline mutation, and they all had high antigen-contacting propensities [69]. Results from the top 2000 ZDOCK predictions were filtered using the user-defined residues and a 6 angstrom distance cutoff. Three predicted complexes were only kept as all residues selected come together at the interface and were further examined by PDBePISA (Protein Interfaces, Surfaces and Assemblies). PyMOL was used for the analysis of docked model and graphical illustration [70].",
