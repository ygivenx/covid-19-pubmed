            "text": "Microbial keratitis induced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) is a rapidly progressive ocular disease characterized by a suppurative stromal infiltrate with a marked mucopurulent exudate, and often causes corneal perforation within several days postinfection [1,2]. Innate immunity is the first line of host defense against microbial infection. Upon recognition of invading microbes by pattern-recognition receptors, inflammatory cells, including polymorphonuclear neutrophils and macrophages, are recruited to the infection sites [3,4]. These inflammatory phagocytes not only directly kill the invading bacteria but also produce various proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukin [IL]-6, IL-1\u03b2, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-\u03b1) and anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 to modulate the antibacterial immunity [5]. However, if uncontrolled, these inflammatory mediators often elicit an overly robust response, favoring bystander tissue damage [1,6,7]. Thus, tight regulation of host inflammatory responses, especially the number and activity of infiltrating inflammatory phagocytes, is critical for disease resolution of PA keratitis [8].",

            "text": "As one of the lightest chemical compounds, lithium chloride (LiCl) has been used as a mood stabilizer for treating diseases such as bipolar disorder for many years [12]. Studies have demonstrated that LiCl is capable of modulating various biologic processes, such as glycogen synthesis, gene expression, mobility, apoptosis, and inflammation [13]. For example, LiCl inhibits the activation of glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2) [14], and enhances the activation of wingless (Wnt)/\u03b2-catenin signaling [14]. LiCl also influences the second messenger system by modulating the activity of the enzymes involved in the metabolic processes of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) [15], diacylglycerol (DAG) [16], and cyclic adenosine monophosphatase level (c-AMP) [17]. Furthermore, it has been reported that LiCl functions as an inflammatory suppressor in dermatitis [18], lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation [19], toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated chronic intestinal inflammation [20], and Francisella infection [21]. LiCl also functions to modulate apoptosis of various cell types, including macrophages [22], neuron cells [23], lymphoid cells [24], and epithelial cells [25-27]. To date, LiCl exhibits great potential in treating Alzheimer disease [28], bipolar disorder [29], diabetes [30], and serous ovarian cancer [31]. However, the role of LiCl in ocular infection remains to be determined.",

For example, Nahman et al. reported that LiCl relieves bipolar disorder by reducing the secretion of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, prostaglandin E2, and nitric oxide [19]. Beurel et al. demonstrated that LiCl reduces LPS-induced IL-6 expression in the septic shock murine model and in vitro cultured primary glia [39]. Wang et al. protected against endotoxemic acute renal failure mainly by downregulating proinflammatory TNF-\u03b1 and Regulated on Activation, Normal T cell Expressed and Secreted [27]. Our study indicated that LiCl enhanced IL-10 production and reduced TNF-\u03b1 expression in the infected corneas as well as murine macrophages and neutrophils. Moreover, LiCl also reduced expression of IL-6 in macrophages and IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 in neutrophils. Although the LiCl-modulated inflammatory cytokine profile in different cell types was not exactly the same, overall LiCl plays an anti-inflammatory role in the host immune response against PA infection. In addition to cytokine production, inflammatory infiltration is another hallmark of corneal inflammation. Our H&E staining data showed that at 5 days p.i., the LiCl-treated B6 corneas were much thinner and less swollen, with fewer infiltrated inflammatory cells in the stroma and anterior chamber, in contrast to the NaCl-treated corneas, further confirming the anti-inflammatory activity of LiCl.",

Studies have demonstrated that LiCl promotes apoptosis of macrophages [22,40], neuron cells [23], and chick retina cells [25], but exhibits antiapoptotic activity in human acute T lymphoblastic leukemia cells [24], LPS-simulated renal cells [27], as well as transmissible gastroenteritis virus\u2013infected swine testis cells and porcine kidney cells [26]. These data indicate that whether LiCl executes an antiapoptotic or a proapoptotic effect is largely associated with the cell type and stimulating factor. Our in vivo data demonstrated that in PA-infected B6 corneas, treatment with LiCl prompted the apoptosis of infiltrating neutrophils and macrophages, which together account for approximately 90% of the whole corneal cells. Our in vitro data further confirmed that LiCl exerts proapoptotic activity in murine macrophages and neutrophils after PA challenge, while no difference was detected in the LiCl- versus NaCl-treated cells before the challenge, which shed light on the regulation of LiCl in PA-induced inflammatory cell apoptosis.",

Studies have demonstrated that LiCl executes its immunomodulatory function by regulating the activity of enzymes involved in the second messenger system or signaling molecules such as GSK3\u03b2 and \u03b2-catenin. For example, studies have demonstrated that LiCl induced the apoptosis of macrophages by suppressing inositol monophosphatase (IMPase) activity [22] and nuclear factor-kappaB activation [40], while the mechanism of neutrophil apoptosis induced by LiCl remains unclear. Substantive evidence indicated that in most cases, LiCl promotes anti-inflammatory cytokine production [23] and induces cell apoptosis by suppressing GSK3\u03b2 activity [23]. However, in PA keratitis, specific GSK3\u03b2 inhibitor SB216763 and LiCl displayed different effects in inflammatory cytokine expression, which indicated the participation of other signaling pathways in the LiCl-induced anti-inflammatory responses.",

Dr. Hazlett\u2019s group demonstrated that earlier apoptosis of inflammatory cells is beneficial for host immune defense against PA keratitis, and that interference of apoptosis aggravates tissue damage and enhances bacterial burden in PA-infected mouse corneas [9,10]. However, Dr. Pearlman\u2019s group reported that PA promotes apoptosis of infiltrating neutrophils in the corneal stroma by virtue of the bacterial type III secretion system, and subverts the antibacterial activity of neutrophils [11]. Our study demonstrated that LiCl increased the apoptosis of infiltrating inflammatory cells and promoted host resistance against PA keratitis, which is consistent with Hazlett\u2019s viewpoints. We also examined the microbicidal activity of LiCl by using the same murine model of PA keratitis, and found that LiCl promoted bacterial elimination, suggesting that the protective role of LiCl in PA keratitis depends on anti-inflammatory function and microbicidal activity.",
