            "text": "The 2009 outbreak of influenza A (H1N1), or 'swine flu,' killed 457 people in the UK between April 2009 and March 2010 [1]. Although the illness turned out to be relatively mild for most people, the early stages of the outbreak were characterised by uncertainty as to the nature and severity of the illness, with concern being expressed about the ability of medical services to cope with the volume of patients who might require help. While most attention focused on the ability of hospitals and primary care trusts to care for patients suffering from swine flu, [2] in practice most people who initially sought help did not have the illness. In the UK, NHS Direct, which is a 24 hour telephone and online health advice and information service staffed primarily by nurses and health information advisors, received approximately 63 000 calls relating to swine flu in the first month of the outbreak [3]. During the same period only 185 cases of swine flu were confirmed across the UK [4]. Although the tendency for large numbers of unaffected individuals to seek advice and assistance from the health services is a common occurrence during major public health incidents, [5,6] little evidence exists as to what factors motivate these patients to seek help. A common assumption is that this group consists of worried patients who require reassurance. [e.g. [7,8]]",

After the World Health Organisation declared on 29 April that a pandemic was imminent, widespread Government advertisements about the condition began to appear in the UK, including an information leaflet delivered to every house in the country [9]. These mass media campaigns were supplemented by websites and an automated telephone line which contained more detailed information. Members of the public were advised that if they had \"just returned from Mexico or an affected country\" and \"think [you] might have swine flu\" they should check their symptoms on-line, call the automated telephone number and then telephone either their GP or NHS Direct \"if you have taken these steps and are still concerned.\" [9] Similar remote triage systems have also been used in other countries during both the swine flu outbreak and in previous major public health incidents [10,11]. Similar systems are also recommended for future incidents [5,6].",

All of these issues tend to increase levels of public concern [13] and make it difficult to provide effective reassurance to patients. Indeed, during one previous major incident in the UK, some people who spoke to NHS Direct or to the UK's Health Protection Agency by telephone reported that this contact added to their confusion or made them suspicious as to why they had been asked to contact these services at all [14].",

Participants were again asked to verbally confirm their consent to take part in the interviews and were informed that all data would be anonymised by the removal of any personally identifiable material from our transcripts and publications. Participants were then guided through a semi-structured interview lasting 10 to 15 minutes (see Appendix 1). The questions asked in these interviews were specifically chosen in order to explore several key topics of interest that were identified a priori. We also asked one item adapted from the state trait anxiety inventory: \"when you called NHS Direct, how worried were you about the swine flu outbreak?\" [15] Permitted responses were 'very much,' 'moderately,' 'somewhat' and 'not at all.'",

These were: reasons for wanting to speak to someone about swine flu; reasons why any prior information sources had not been sufficient; reasons motivating patients to speak to NHS Direct rather than to a different healthcare provider; reasons why speaking to NHS Direct had been reassuring; reasons why speaking to NHS Direct had provoked concern or anxiety; and reasons for wanting to seek more advice about swine flu after speaking to NHS Direct. We first looked for quotes from each transcript which related to one of these main themes. Within each theme, we then grouped quotes together which appeared to reflect the same underlying sub-theme, using an iterative process of refining and re-labelling these sub-themes. Once themes were identified, two researchers re-examined each transcript and identified how many participants had explicitly mentioned each sub-theme to ensure that they reflected general experiences among our participants rather than idiosyncratic findings relating to single people.",

Three themes emerged as to why people felt they needed additional advice despite having already used these sources. First, a common reason was simply because the participant had been explicitly told that they needed to seek help from elsewhere. Second, people who had used an internet resource or the Government leaflet also made comments suggesting that they now wanted to speak to a human, because \"you can read so much in a leaflet, and you can watch so much, but I think when you speak to someone it's a bit more reassuring.\" Finally, a lack of trust in the initial source was important for some participants.",

For some participants, it was because they had been informed that NHS Direct was the most appropriate place to get help, while others commented that using a telephone service would reduce their chances of giving swine flu to friends, family members or colleagues. Also important was the ease with which NHS Direct could be accessed. As one participant noted \"it's a lot less hassle than going to your GP.\" Trust in NHS Direct was mentioned by many participants. This often related to a previous positive experience with them (e.g. \"any time I ring NHS Direct about anything, it's always reassuring\"). Finally, some participants mentioned that they wanted to avoid burdening other medical services.",

Although some indicated that speaking to NHS Direct had not been reassuring, in each instance this reflected the fact that the participant had not been worried to begin with. One factor underlying the reassurance was the ability of staff to explicitly rule out swine flu. In addition, providing an alternative explanation for symptoms was mentioned as reassuring (e.g. \"I wanted to check that there were just other kinds of flu bugs going around, because it surprised me that at this time of year I should be having these sort of symptoms. So really I wanted somebody to say yes there are, they do last a few days, it's all perfectly normal\").",

For some, this emerged as only a minor nagging doubt. For others, it was a more central issue which diminished the reassurance that they had obtained. For example, one participant was unhappy that she had been asked if her family member had come into contact with a known case and commented that; \"well you don't know, that's the thing. They were very unhelpful... It just wasn't reassuring... They say you don't fit the criteria, but according to that list [of symptoms], you know, everything that she had is on that list.\"",

As such, we cannot provide any meaningful response rate for the study: it is not clear how many participants were asked to participate in the research, but declined. Nonetheless, we believe that the themes we identified do reflect the key variables that were important in causing people to seek advice from NHS Direct and to find their contact with NHS Direct reassuring or useful. We have no reason to believe that our sampling excluded a large subset of patients whose experiences or perceptions were qualitatively different from those who were included. Although we were unable to feed back our results to the initial callers in order to gauge their credibility, presentation of our results to an NHS Direct call centre team suggested that the issues we identified did appear to be complete, although it is possible that some small subgroups, such as pregnant women or GPs may have had different concerns when they called in.",
