            "text": "To date, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) is the most reliable and easy to perform technique to measure the expression level of a selected gene of interest (GOI) by quantifying mRNA transcripts. qRT-PCR is fast and the sensitivity of the method allows precise quantification of minimal differences in expression across a wide dynamic range even when working with limited amounts of starting material. However, several variables associated with the different steps of qRT-PCR experimental procedures can lead to considerable inter-sample variation and possibly to erroneous results: the different amount and quality of starting material; RNA integrity; efficiency in cDNA synthesis and PCR amplification; and differences between tissues or cells in overall transcriptional activity [1]. Among the strategies proposed to control for technical and sample variation in qRT-PCR experiments [2], the use of reference genes is commonly accepted as the most reliable approach to normalize qRT-PCR and to reduce possible errors generated in the quantification of gene expression. In this normalization strategy, reference genes are used as internal controls and are submitted to the same experimental protocol of the GOI. The expression level measured for the target gene is then normalized according to the values of the internal controls. It is clear, therefore, that an ideal reference gene should be stably expressed within the samples to be compared irrespective of experimental conditions or external factors, otherwise the detection of small changes become unfeasible and unreliable. A number of studies have well assessed that genes classically thought to be stable for their ubiquitous expression and involvement in cell homeostasis (e.g., GAPDH, ACTB, 18S rRNA) are not always the best reference genes, as they show different behaviour across various cell types and tissues [3,4]. Accordingly, a proper evaluation of several candidate genes should be performed before any gene expression study [2].",

            "text": "Studies aimed at identifying the most suitable reference genes in the ovine species have been performed in nervous tissues, spleen, mesenteric lymph node, ileum, lung and pulmonary artery [5\u20138]. However, no specific information on whole blood is currently available. A reference gene for use in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was selected [9], but this study was based on the analysis of the standard deviation of cycle threshold (Ct) and not on specifically designed algorithms. Nevertheless, blood is a readily accessible source of material for analysis and some attempts to identify gene expression markers by qRT-PCR in order to develop blood tests in sheep have been reported for prion diseases. For example, in 2001, Miele et al. discovered a novel erythroid-associated factor (ERAF) and demonstrated a dramatic decrease in expression of the specific transcript within rodent models of prion diseases, providing the first easily detectable molecular marker in a readily accessible tissue [10]. More recently, analysis of blood by qRT-PCR from sheep experimentally infected with scrapie revealed that the extent of differential expression of ERAF in peripheral ovine blood may be insufficient to provide a discriminatory diagnostic test [11]. However, the lack of a set of validated reference genes for sheep whole blood did not allow for the proper normalization of gene expression data and, in this study, glycophorin C (GYPC) was arbitrarily chosen as normalizer based on its higher expression in the human erythroid lineage. Moreover, the use of a single gene to normalise expression is no longer considered sufficient [12\u201315]. Vandesompele et al. (2002) demonstrated that errors of up to 20-fold in expression data can be generated by the use of only a single reference gene [1].",

All primer pairs spanned two exons, generating melt-curve profiles specific to cDNA and genomic DNA amplification. While this strategy entailed much more effort in primer design and reaction optimisation, it assured specific amplification of mRNA transcripts by avoiding/recognizing interference of genomic DNA in quantification. Actually, in most cases DNAse treatment does not completely eliminate genomic DNA contamination, especially when RNA extraction is performed using reagents based on mono-phasic solution of phenol and guanidine isothiocyanate (personal observation). Gene-specific amplification was confirmed for all selected genes by a single-peak in melt-curve analysis and subsequent sequencing of amplicons. The determined reference gene sequences have been submitted to the GenBank database under the accession numbers JN811677-JN811687.",

All studied genes reached acceptable stable expression with low M values, less than 1.5. Based on M value ranking, SDHA appeared to be the most stably expressed gene in control sheep with an average M value of 0.316, followed by YWHAZ and HPRT. In disease-stressed sheep, the overall stability of the candidate genes was lower and YWHAZ was the most stably expressed gene with an average M value of 0.624, followed by GAPDH and SDHA. When data from the two groups were combined, SDHA and YWHAZ resulted to be the most stably expressed genes with average M values of 0.591 and 0.593, respectively. However, after stepwise exclusion of the worst-scoring reference genes, recalculation of the new M values indicated that SDHA/HPRT, YWHAZ/GAPDH and SDHA/YWHAZ represented the most suitable gene combinations in the control, disease-stressed and combined sheep groups, respectively (Figures 1A, 2A and 3A).",

SDHA, YWHAZ and HPRT still occupy the highest positions in control animals, with stability values of 0.068, 0.125 and 0.132, respectively; while YWHAZ, GAPDH and SDHA shows the highest stability values in disease-stressed sheep (\u03c1 values = 0.046, 0.064 and 0.188, respectively). When expression data from control and disease-stressed animals were combined, the resulting ranking confirmed SDHA and YWHAZ in the top positions with stability values of 0.093 and 0.096, respectively, followed by ACTB (\u03c1 value = 0.099). TFRC and PGK1 are equally defined as the least reliable controls by both software and in all sheep groups.",

Both software algorithms are frequently used and freely available but have a different working rationale. NormFinder selects out of a set of potential reference genes one single best-performing reference gene that shows the least variation within the analysed group. GeNorm focuses on pairwise comparisons of reference gene expression in the experimental samples and so is less appropriate for identifying co-regulated genes [18]. To avoid possible bias, we therefore selected the candidate reference genes on the basis of differences in their physiological functions.",

            "text": "To investigate the influence of the animal health status on the stability of the candidate reference genes, the analyses were performed in whole blood of control sheep and of sheep showing disease symptoms after clinical evaluation. Moreover, disease-stressed animals were sampled and analysed twice in order to monitor gene stability in disease-stressed sheep not only at different time points, but also under heat stress conditions, which, in association to disease status, really represent an extreme situation (see the Experimental Section for details on animal selection and sampling procedure). In all sheep groups, the results obtained with geNorm and Normfinder were consistent although not identical, as similarly reported elsewhere [19\u201322]. SDHA and YWHAZ can be considered the most stably expressed genes in ovine whole blood ranking at the top positions in the control and disease-stressed sheep, both when they were analysed separately and when they were combined. SDHA and YWHAZ stability appears to be reliable as it was affected neither by disease status alone nor in association with heat stress. Moreover, geNorm indicated SDHA/YWHAZ as the best reference gene combination in the control and disease-stressed sheep joined datasets, a situation likely to fit most experimental contexts involving case and control animals; however, the SDHA/YWHAZ combination would be suitable for normalization of gene expression data also in studies carried out under physiological conditions, as these two genes demonstrated high stability in the control sheep group as well. Although data in sheep are still limited, SDHA appears to have good stability in this species as it was included in the reference genes required for reliable normalisation in several tissues (cerebrum, spleen, mesenteric lymph node and ileum). Similarly, YWHAZ was included in the optimal panel of reference genes to be used in the cerebellum, obex and ileum [5]. HPRT expression stability was evaluated only in the lung and pulmonary artery of brainstem death and control sheep, but it performed poorly as reference in both tissues on separate and combined analyses [7]. Actually, HPRT ranked as the third most stable gene of the control group in sheep whole blood, but its stability strongly decreased under disease conditions, emphasizing that proper validation of reference genes in a cell type or tissue of interest and under different experimental settings is mandatory before reporting qRT-PCR results. B2M showed stable expression in one study on human leukocytes from 13 healthy donors [1]. B2M also had stable expression in a large study in which 526 human whole blood samples represented healthy individuals and six disease groups [23]. In sheep, however, B2M is outperformed by other genes and demonstrates suboptimal suitability as reference gene in whole blood. In humans, GYPC expression is considerably higher in erythroid lineage cells than in non-erythroid cells [24]. GYPC was therefore used by Brown et al. (2007) to normalize qRT-PCR analyses of erythroid markers in sheep whole blood [11]. In our study, however, both geNorm and NormFinder classified GYPC in the bottom half of the stability ranking under both control and disease conditions, showing that ubiquitously expressed genes would provide a more relevant comparison for measuring erythroid gene expression. In control sheep, GAPDH resulted in being the gene with the highest degree of individual variation in expression level. This finding was not surprising, as GAPDH can be regulated under a large number of physiological states and is generally not considered a good reference gene [25,26]. Nevertheless, GAPDH ranked as the second most stable gene in the disease-stressed and the combined sheep groups. Taylor et al. (2008) found that the levels of GAPDH transcription were the most stable of the genes tested in ovine peripheral blood mononuclear cells during infection with Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis [9]. This finding is consistent with our results indicating stability of GAPDH in whole blood under disease condition. However, it must be taken into account that Taylor\u2019s results could also be attributable to a characteristic of the specific cell type or to the fact that the study based its observations on analysis of the standard deviation of Ct values and not on specifically designed algorithms.",

This aspect has been neglected in the previous works on reference gene validation in sheep, probably because of the lack of ovine genomic DNA sequences available in the public databases. Indeed, we were able to retrieve intron-spanning primers from previous publications for only three genes (PGK1, SDHA and G6PD) among those included in our study. Nevertheless, this approach is highly recommended in combination with DNAse I treatment to avoid/recognize co-amplification of contaminating genomic DNA [1], since spurious PCR signals could affect the selection of reliable references by mimicking individual variation with lower stability scores. Also, when searching RTPrimerDB, a reference database for qRT-PCR primers [27\u201330], we noted that among 8329 real-time PCR primer sets for 5758 genes of 26 organisms available at the time of writing, only 16 SYBR Green assays were deposited under Ovis aries. Importantly, therefore, an additional outcome of our study is a set of validated primer sequences suitable for gene expression experiments based on SYBR Green chemistry to be carried out with other ovine tissues and cells.",

            "text": "A number of studies have been carried out to identify reliable reference genes in specific tissues in various species [34\u201338]. In sheep, analyses of expression stability of candidate reference genes are limited to a restricted range of tissues [5\u20138] and data on ovine whole blood were still lacking. However, peripheral whole blood is attractive because of its accessibility and usefulness in monitoring several physiological and pathological conditions. As regards disease status, blood certainly represents the best tissue for in vivo test development since collection is non-invasive and easy to perform. For example, the identification of differentially expressed genes acting as indirect in vivo markers in blood would represent a major breakthrough for the diagnostics of non-conventional agents (like prions) which currently cannot be detected by standard methods as the diagnosis still rely on post mortem investigations. This study provides a panel of optimal control genes for use in qRT-PCR studies in sheep whole blood. The two softwares tested, based on different algorithms and analytical procedures, produced highly comparable results. SDHA and YWHAZ represent good reference genes for gene expression studies in sheep peripheral whole blood, unaffected by disease status and heat stress conditions, and the geometric mean of these two stable genes is an accurate normalization factor [1]. Our results may be useful for the identification of genes differentially expressed in a readily accessible tissue, with the potential of discovering new physiological and disease markers and as a tool to improve production traits (e.g., by identifying expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTLs) [39,40].",
