Primary, well differentiated human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures have been shown to accurately represent the human airway epithelium, both in appearance and function [12]. HAE cultures have served as a model for numerous respiratory viruses, including RSV, parainfluenza viruses, human/avian influenza viruses, and coronaviruses, and are considered to be an ideal in vitro model of viral interaction with the respiratory epithelium in vivo [13\u201318].",

However, HAE cultures do not express detectable HS on their apical surface [13], leading us to hypothesize that a different viral receptor is responsible for RSV attachment to these cells and likely to human airways. CX3CR1, surfactant protein A, and annexin II have also been shown to bind the G protein and proposed to act as cellular receptors for RSV [20\u201323]. Recombinant RSV lacking its G gene is able to infect HAE cultures [24], albeit poorly, suggesting that the RSV F protein also has attachment activity. ICAM-1, TLR4, and nucleolin have been proposed to function as F protein receptors [25\u201327], but most of this work has been performed in immortalized cells and needs to be reexamined in primary cultures.",

One of the mAbs, 131-2g, previously characterized as \u201cnon-neutralizing\u201d in immortalized cells, did neutralize RSV on HAE cells. This mAb had been shown to block G protein binding to CX3CR1 [23]. Here we find that CX3CR1 is detectable on ciliated cells in HAE cultures. Both a mAb against CX3CR1 and mutations in the G protein CX3C motif reduced RSV infection of these cells. These results suggest that RSV uses CX3CR1 as a cellular receptor on physiologically relevant HAE cultures and, likely, in the airways of the human lung.",

To test this possibility, recombinant green fluorescent protein expressing RSV (rgRSV) was incubated with soluble HS prior to inoculation of HeLa and HAE cultures. Soluble HS (20 \u03bcg/ml) neutralized infection of HeLa cells without reducing infection of HAE cultures (Fig 1A). This result is consistent with HS acting as a virus receptor on HeLa cells, but not on HAE cultures. At a 5-fold higher concentration of soluble HS (100 \u03bcg/ml) RSV infection of HeLa cultures was reduced by over 100-fold, but infection of HAE cultures was reduced by only 2-fold.

However, mAb 131-2g did neutralize rgRSV infection of HAE cultures. The ability of mAb 131-2g to reduce infection of HAE, but not HeLa cultures suggests that mAb 131-2g binds near and interferes with the function of a domain in the G protein that is important for attachment to HAE cultures but not for attachment to HeLa cells. This result demonstrates that these two domains on the G protein are distinct and confirms our hypothesis that RSV uses a different receptor to infect HAE cells compared to HeLa cells.

However, we found that mAb L9 also inhibited rgRSV infection of HAE cells, but the inhibition of HAE infection was approximately 10-fold greater than the inhibition of HeLa infection (Fig 1C). The ability of mAb L9 to neutralize rgRSV on HeLa and HAE cultures may be because the mAb blocks G protein binding to both HS and the unidentified HAE receptor, respectively. We have previously found that recombinant RSV lacking the G gene is much less infectious for HAE cultures than for HeLa cells [24], indicating that the G protein is more important for infection of HAE cultures. The greater neutralizing ability of mAb L9 on HAE cultures is likely due to the fact that the G protein is more critical for efficient infection of these cells. Therefore, the ability of mAb L9 to neutralize rgRSV infection of both HeLa and HAE cells suggests that the attachment sites on the G protein for each cell type are close to each other.",

MAb 131-2g blocks G protein binding to CX3CR1 [23]. Here we found that mAb 131-2g efficiently reduces RSV infection of HAE cultures (Fig 1b\u20131e), leading us to hypothesize that RSV uses CX3CR1 as a receptor on these cells. To determine if CX3CR1 is expressed on HAE cells in general and on ciliated cells, the target cells for RSV infection, we stained fixed cross-sections of HAE cultures with antibodies against CX3CR1. These antibodies stained the apical surface of HAE cultures, primarily and robustly staining the cilia on ciliated cells (Fig 3A). This finding indicates that CX3CR1 is located on the correct cell type to be an RSV receptor on HAE cultures. Its expression in this location could be responsible for the ciliated cell tropism of RSV.",

CX3CR1 is expressed in epithelial cells, smooth muscle cells, microglia, neurons, T cells, monocytes, dendritic cells, and NK cells [47\u201353]. RSV is able to infect nearly all immortalized cell lines and infects primary epithelial cells, smooth muscle cells, neuronal cells, eosinophils, and dendritic cells [19,40,54,55]. Here we found that CX3CR1 is detectable on the cilia of ciliated cells in HAE cultures, the cell targeted by RSV [19]. In two publications that appeared while the present report was under review, Jeong et al. confirmed this location [56] and Chirkova et al. found CX3CR1 on the majority of RSV infected cells in primary human bronchial epithelial cultures [57].",

MAb 131-2g also reduces leukocyte migration in vitro [23] and inflammation in the lungs of RSV infected mice [58], suggesting that the G protein modulates the host inflammatory response via its interaction with CX3CR1. In RSV infected mice, treatment with mAb 131-2g mediates viral clearance and reduces RSV pathogenesis [59]. Because mAb 131-2g is non-neutralizing in immortalized cells, it was thought that this reduction in virus load could not be due to virus neutralization, but might instead be due to antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity. Furthermore, it was suggested that the reduction in pathogenesis was due to prevention of G protein-mediated leukocyte chemotaxis. Here we demonstrate that mAb 131-2g is strongly neutralizing on HAE cultures and that CX3CR1 is likely an important receptor on these cells. As our CX3CR1-/- mouse infection data suggest that RSV uses CX3CR1 as a receptor on the murine airway epithelium, RSV neutralization by mAb 131-2g could have directly caused the decrease in viral load, resulting in decreased pathogenesis. A previous report did not find a difference in RSV yield from CX3CR1-/- and WT mice [60]. However, infectious virus in the lung was not quantified in that study which relied instead on real-time PCR. Indeed, several studies have utilized the mouse model and mAb 131-2g to examine the effects of the RSV G protein-CX3CR1 interaction on the immune response to RSV, but its use of CX3CR1 as a receptor on epithelial cells in the murine lung has not yet been directly examined.",

We found that both F170 and C186 of the G protein are required for binding by mAbs L9 and 131-2g on an immunoblot, indicating that the epitopes of these mAbs overlap. Furthermore, since both mAbs bound the G protein that had been treated with a reducing agent, mAb binding was not dependent on the structure provided by the disulfide bonds, but rather on the primary sequence. Sullender previously found that mAb 131-2g does not bind to cells expressing a fragment of the G protein that includes amino acids 1 to 173 in an immunoblot [46], but does bind this fragment in a cell immunofluorescence assay. It is possible that the site on the G protein that is recognized by mAb 131-2g has two components, one that includes amino acids F170 and C186 and another that is conformational. Further characterization is required and may provide further insights into this HAE-only neutralizing epitope on the G protein.",

Conversely, it is possible that other antibodies that neutralize RSV on immortalized cells may not have neutralizing activity in vivo.
