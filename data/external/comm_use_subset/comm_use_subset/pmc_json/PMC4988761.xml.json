Most severe cases were previously reported to be associated with AdV-3, 4, 7 and 21 [2,3]. A new strain, AdV-55 (formerly known as AdV-11a), has been a major AdV pneumonia pathogen in immunocompetent adolescents and adults in China since 2008 [4]. Our previous study identified a fatal AdV-55 infection case with a patient who presented with systemic infection and high-level viremia [5]. However, even though AdV-55 as well as AdV-3, 4, 7 and 21 can cause severe cases, those strains are not necessarily associated with bad outcomes, and the pathogenesis of fatality is still unknown. We have already ascertained that AdV can be detected in whole blood specimens of severe cases, but we still lack the knowledge about the viral shedding history and the relationship between the viral clearance in the respiratory tract and viremia duration and clinical outcome. In this study, we focus on the dynamic virological changes in whole blood and respiratory tract secretions to see if lethal cases experienced a high viral load and longer duration of viral shedding compared to the non-lethal cases. We hypothesize that sustained virus shedding in the blood and/or respiratory tract can appear in severe immunocompetent adult cases, and it may be a risk factor for fatal outcome.",

For patients with mechanical ventilation, we collected serial tracheal aspirations, and for patients without mechanical ventilation, we collected sputum samples. We also collected data regarding age, gender, co-morbidities, clinical symptoms, vital signs, antimicrobial treatment, chest radiographic findings, and laboratory results. Recorded complications included the following: use of mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and second bacterial or fungal infection.

All of the fatal patients (4/4) were complicated with ARDS and admitted to the ICU. They needed mechanical ventilation, and three of them received ECMO to maintain oxygenation. For surviving patients, one of them (1/10) was admitted to the ICU due to ARDS, and had mechanical ventilation and ECMO; one patient with respiratory failure was treated with non-invasive ventilation, and one patient was treated for myocarditis. The myocarditis patient presented with peak levels of creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB) and cardiac troponin I (CTNI) on day 7\u20138 after disease onset, and eight days later, with viral load going down to negative, CK-MB and CTNI went down to normal levels in parallel (Fig 4).",

Compared to this case in Fig 3, the patient described in Fig 3 not only had a higher viral load (109.25 copies/ml) in tracheal aspiration but also presented with sustained elevated viral copies, especially in whole blood. Shike et al. also reported a 6-month-old infant with systemic infection by adenovirus who had high-level viremia and showed reduction in viral load paralleling her clinical recovery[9]. Therefore, in severe cases, dynamic monitoring of viral shedding, especially in whole blood, could help predict the clinical outcome.
