The sequence of the PCR amplicon of this isolate was a close match with that of a coronavirus isolated from a 60-year-old patient who had died of severe pneumonia in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia in June 2012 [1,2]. Together, these two cases marked the beginning of an outbreak of severe respiratory infections caused by a newly identified coronavirus, designated the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [3]. This outbreak is ongoing, with 836 confirmed cases to date that have resulted in 288 deaths in 19 countries (Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Kuwait, Yemen, Lebanon, Iran, Algeria, Tunisia, France, the Netherlands, Germany, the United Kingdom, Greece, Malaysia, Philippines and the United States of America) as of 14 July, 2014 [The World Health Organization (WHO), Global Alert and Response (GAR), Coronavirus infections, updated on 14 July 2014, http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/en/index.html].",

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which caused severe pneumonia resulting in 8,098 reported infections and 774 deaths between 2002 and 2003 [5], was also derived from bat coronaviruses [6,7]. MERS-CoV, with its similar symptoms and phylogeny, is therefore considered a cousin of SARS-CoV. The reservoir for MERS-CoV remains unclear, but recent reports suggest that camels are the most likely candidate, as a form of the virus has been circulating in camels in Saudi Arabia since at least 1992 [8-13].",

The first probe and primer sets for MERS-CoV detection by real-time PT-PCR were developed by Corman et al. shortly following the first reports of the disease [14,15]. Among them, the probe and primer sets targeting upE and ORF1a exhibit the highest sensitivities, and remain the most widely used targets for MERS-CoV detection. At least two different specific genomic targets are required for a positive diagnosis according to the case definition announced by the WHO as of 3 July 2013 [WHO, GAR, Revised interim case definition for reporting to WHO \u2013 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), updated on 3 July 2013, http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/case_definition/en/index.html]. A single positive target followed by gene sequencing is also considered positive; however, the current gene sequencing technique requires PCR amplicons, and the ability of conventional RT-PCR to produce a sequencing-quality template is generally lower than that of real-time RT-PCR [16-20]. Therefore, it is urgently necessary to develop as many specific genetic diagnostic methods as possible to allow reliable diagnosis of MERS-CoV infections.",

The LAMP procedure is user-friendly, since the reaction mixture is incubated at a single temperature for less than 1 h. Amplification can be detected as the precipitation of magnesium pyrophosphate or by fluorescence under ultra-violet light, and also can be detected in real time by monitoring the turbidity of the pyrophosphate [23]. The LAMP assay can also be used for the detection of RNA by combining reverse transcription with LAMP (RT-LAMP) [21]; RT-LAMP assays have been developed for a variety of respiratory RNA viruses, including SARS [24], respiratory syncytial virus [25,26], and influenza viruses [27,28]. In this study, a novel RT-LAMP method for the detection of MERS-CoV was developed, with a sensitivity similar to that of real-time RT-PCR targeting upE and ORF1a.",

First is a real-time method that monitors the turbidity of the pyrophosphate precipitation using a turbidimeter (LA-320C) (Figure 1a). The differentiated value of each signal is calculated automatically at the same time during amplification, with values > 0.1 considered positive. RT-LAMP can also detect MERS-CoV without any specific instruments by detecting visible signals at the same level as real-time monitoring. Amplification can be determined through visual detection of magnesium pyrophosphate precipitation following completion of the reaction (Figure 1b). Furthermore, amplicons can be detected by means of green fluorescence under ultraviolet light by adding a fluorescence detection reagent to the mixture before the start of amplification (Figure 1c).",

The number of sequences deposited in GenBank is increasing, and this region of MERS-CoV exhibits several sequences variation. Therefore, the primer sequences were checked against the available MERS-CoV sequences. Eighty-one MERS-CoV nucleocapsid sequences were collected from GenBank, along with seven other sequences reported online (England2-HPA, Jeddah_2014_C7149, C7569, C7770, C8826, C9055, and C9355]. An alignment was constructed using the EMC isolate and mismatched sequences (Figure 2). The RT-LAMP primers matched most of the 88 sequences. Primers B3 and LF matched them completely. Primer F3 had one nucleotide mismatch for two sequences. Primer LB had one nucleotide mismatch for one sequence and had another mismatch for two sequences. Primer BIP had one nucleotide mismatch in B1 region of one sequence and had another mismatch in the B2 region of five sequences. Primer FIP had a one-nucleotide mismatch in the F1 region of 11 sequences (Table 1). The efficiency of RT-LAMP for these mismatched sequences was evaluated using an RNA template transcribed from a 1242-bp of PCR amplicon from the nucleocapsid gene sequence of MERS-CoV (Table 6). The sensitivity of RT-LAMP using the RNA control template of the EMC isolate was 15.8 copies and tended to be lower than that using viral RNA as the template. This might be caused by a difference in RT efficiency or the secondary structure of RNA due to the difference in length. The mismatches in the F3, F2, B1, and LB region did not markedly affect the amplification efficiency, and the sensitivity was equal to or twice that of the EMC isolate. The mismatch in the B2 region affected amplification slightly, and showed a fivefold decrease in the sensitivity (73.4 copies). This mismatch in B2 was seen in 5 sequences (KJ156883, KJ156944, KF556336, KF958702, and KF917527) of the 88 MERS-CoV sequences checked in this study.

            "text": "The RT-LAMP method requires only a single temperature for amplification, with results usually available in less than 1 h by observing magnesium pyrophosphate precipitate or fluorescence signals by the naked eye [21,22]. Although RT-LAMP amplification can be monitored in real-time using a turbidimeter [23], the assay can also be performed using basic laboratory equipment, such as a heat block and water bath. The method has been validated using various respiratory viruses, as well as more diverse pathogens, such as bacteria [33-35], protozoa [36-38], and parasites [39,40]. Furthermore, the reagents necessary to perform RT-LAMP are commercially available. Recently, Abd El Wahed et al., reported a genetic diagnostic method for MERS-CoV based on reverse transcription isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-PPA) assay. The method is highly sensitive and can detect 10 copies of virus RNA within 3 to 7 minutes. Therefore, it is useful for the diagnosis of MERS-CoV as well. However, RT-RPA requires a specific tubescanner for detection. By contrast, the RT-LAMP assay enables detection of amplicons by observing a magnesium pyrophosphate precipitate or fluorescence signals with the naked eye with no requirement for any specialized instruments. Taken together, the specificity and sensitivity of the RT-LAMP assay described here, in combination with its accessibility and ease of use, make this assay a valuable tool for the diagnosis and epidemiologic surveillance of human MERS-CoV infection, especially for field use.",

The effect of these mismatches on the RT-LAMP efficiency was evaluated using a synthesized control RNA template: most of the mismatches did not affect the amplification efficiency of RT-LAMP. However, the substitution in B2 region of the primer, namely, a G to T substitution at position 29018 in the nucleocapsid gene sequence of the EMC isolate, was present in five MERS-CoV sequences and caused a slight decrease in sensitivity. Of the five sequences, KJ156883 (Asir_1_2013) belongs to the Buraidah_1 clade, and is the only sequence in this clade with such a substitution [41]. The other sequences (KJ156944, Riyadh_5_2013; KJ556336, Jeddah_1_2013; KF958702, Jeddah_human1; KF917527, Jeddah_Camel1) belong to the Riyadh_3 clade [42,43]; none of the other sequences in this clade have a substitution according to the alignment analysis. Therefore, the substitution does not represent a major population in this clade. Although it is important to improve the primers to increase their sensitivity for sequences in the Riyadh_3 clade by using mixed bases, the results of this study suggest that the RT-LAMP primer is useful for detecting the majority of the prevalent MERS-CoV strains.",

Drosten et al., reported that up to 106 copies/mL of MERS-CoV RNA are present in lower respiratory tract specimens, such as tracheobronchial secretions, and bronchoalveolar lavage. In contrast, only small amounts of viral RNAs were detected in upper respiratory tract specimens and other tissue [44]. The RT-LAMP primers described here were designed based upon the nucleocapsid protein sequence of MERS-CoV, due to the unique coronaviral replication system. Although coronaviruses generate subgenomic mRNAs to produce each viral protein, all subgenomic mRNAs contain nucleoprotein sequences, as they are located on the 3\u2032end of the coronavirus genome [45-47]. This implies that the RT-LAMP procedure described here will exhibit a high degree of sensitivity for specimens containing cellular components.",
