            "text": "As outbreaks emerge, public health agencies often implement a variety of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions to prevent epidemic expansion, including vaccination and medical prophylaxis, school closures and other social distancing measures, and information campaigns to promote awareness, hygienic precautions and voluntary isolation [1\u20134]. However, such measures require population adherence and are often hindered by failure to take recommended actions [5]. Around the globe, for example, seasonal influenza vaccine coverage falls significantly below the 75% baseline recommended by the World Health Organization, but varies widely between countries and across age groups [6]. In the USA, 2015-2016 uptake was only 59.3% in children and 41.7% in adults [7]. For measles, routine childhood vaccination is declining in Texas and other areas of the United States where personal belief and other non-medical vaccination exemptions are allowed [8\u201310]. Parental decision-making regarding childhood vaccines is complex and context dependent [11], but likely influenced by false claims regarding vaccine safety, low perceived risks of infectious diseases, and other forms of misinformation from the \u201canti-vaxxer\u201d movement [8, 11\u201313]. Recently, there have been calls for a special government commission on vaccine safety, despite overwhelming scientific consensus that vaccines are both safe and effective [12, 14\u201316].",

They often judge personal risk based on their impressions of overall disease prevalence and severity [2, 20\u201323]. When infection risk appears low, small risks of adverse effects from the vaccine can seem relatively important and cause vaccine coverage to drop below levels required to control transmission. A variety of other factors can influence the perceived utility of disease prevention, including epidemiological news and rumors, costs of vaccination and other control measures, trust in health professionals, government agencies, media and non-official information sources, as well as societal pressure to ensure the health of one\u2019s children [24\u201329].",

For example, vaccination protects not only the immunized individual, but also social contacts who might have been infected by the individual. Social distancing decisions may break chains of transmission by protecting the decision-maker and more generally disrupting social dynamics. Following [37, 38], we refer to this indirect protection as a herd effect. Although previously equated to the reduction in incidence in the unimmunized population [38], we quantify the herd effect of an intervention effort by estimating the number of infections averted per vaccine administered (or per individual social distancing action). The general phenomenon in which individual intervention actions reduce the risk of infection to others has also been called vaccination efficiency, vaccination effectiveness, herd immunity, and indirect protection [37\u201340].",

Measures taken by gregarious individuals may have greater immediate benefits than those taken by solitary individuals, with downstream epidemiological consequences modulated by the full social network [43, 44]. Contact patterns may also influence the decision-making process itself, by constraining epidemiological perspectives. When gauging infection risk, individuals may consider global information (e.g., from news media) or local first-hand encounters with disease (e.g., infected acquaintances, friends or family members) [30, 31]. While traditional compartmental models assume homogeneity in both epidemiological risks and intervention benefits, network-based models provide a tractable framework for studying the complex interplay between contact networks, intervention decision making and disease transmission [34, 45\u201351].",

When H is between zero and one, more vaccines are given than infections averted, suggesting that vaccines may be mistimed or misplaced. This could happen, for example, if risk is underestimated early in the epidemic and overestimated late in the epidemic. An H near one indicates that approximately one infection is averted for every vaccine given. Note that this is an average, and does not necessarily mean that every vaccination prevents infection of the recipient.

The local count strategy is more protective than the local prevalence strategy. By tracking the number rather than proportion of infected contacts, individuals more accurately assess the local force of infection. For example, compare a solitary individual with just two social contacts and a gregarious individual with 20. If they both have two infected contacts, then their risk of infection will be similar (assuming that time spent with each contact is sufficient for transmission). Under local count, their perceived risk and consequent vaccination probability will be identical; under local prevalence, the solitary individual will perceive higher risk (i.e., 100% of contacts infected) than the gregarious individual.

In general, the higher the degree of a node, the higher their risk for becoming infected and infecting others, and the greater the number of local infections they could potentially perceive when making vaccination decisions. Indeed, across all decision models, higher degree individuals vaccinate earlier, in terms of the fraction of the population infected at time of vaccination (Fig 4A, bottom). However, the fraction of individuals vaccinated in each degree class does not necessarily increase with degree (Fig 4A, top). Local count is the only strategy under which vaccination coverage monotonically increases with degree. Under global decision-making, coverage is inversely related to degree, and under local prevalence, coverage peaks for moderately connected individuals. By the time individuals choose to vaccinate under either of the two suboptimal strategies, their local risk of infection is already quite high (Fig 4A, middle), particularly for more gregarious individuals. Although the vaccinating individuals are immediately protected, comparable individuals (of the same degree class and local risk) who stochastically fail to make the same low probability vaccination decision are likely to become infected. Consequently, the risk of infection increases steeply with degree under all models except local count (Fig 4B). In a sensitivity analysis, we find that these qualitative results are robust to our assumptions about the efficacy of the vaccine, the time lag between an individual deciding to vaccinate and becoming protected against infection, the size of the network and the duration of the infectious period (S3 Fig).",

Risk is highly variable in time and space, given the heterogeneity of the underlying contact network and branching nature of transmission.

The advantage of local risk assessment stems from two sources of variation in risk. First, disease transmission is an inherently local process in which risk aggregates around currently infected individuals.

Massaro et al. model two networks\u2013the epidemiological contact network through which disease spreads and the social network through which risk information spreads. The more similar the two networks, the greater the individual and population-level protection achieved by vaccination [49].

While such limitations should be formally analyzed, our simple analysis suggests that the best paradigm for averting infections also requires the fewest resources. For example, for a flu-like R0 of two, compare the local count strategy, where individuals protect themselves as their number of infected friends and family climb, to the global strategy, where decisions are based on population prevalence. For every individual that takes action, almost two infections are averted under the local strategy whereas less than one infection is averted under the global strategy. Local counting results in far fewer total infections (3% versus 13%) while requiring far less intervention resources (23% versus 60% of individuals taking protective action).",

In reality, contacts can be highly heterogeneous, with household and health care contacts far more likely to transmit disease than casual social acquaintances. Our results should be robust when such heterogeneity is distributed randomly throughout the network. However, if individuals with more contacts tend to spend less time with each one, then epidemiological risk may be more homogeneous throughout the network and the advantage of the local decision strategies reduced. Although we do not model this scenario directly, we considered a homogeneous network where all individuals have the same number of contacts. This is roughly equivalent to mass action models that assume homogeneous contact rates and complete mixing [54]. The local strategies still prevail, but their relative efficiency is reduced, with far more vaccines required to achieve the same benefit (Fig 5). Conversely, in a network with greater heterogeneity (scale-free), the advantages of the local strategies are magnified.",

More likely, individual risk assessments are constrained by historical inertia [21, 24, 34, 46, 72], influenced by decisions of friends and family [1, 3, 10, 26, 28, 46], and integrate information from a combination of local and global data sources of variable reliability. Realistic decision models, driven by sociological survey data, can elucidate vaccine campaign failures and identify key pressure points for increasing uptake. Second, how can we streamline intervention campaigns to achieve efficient, rather than universal, adherence? This study reminds us that more intervention is not necessarily better intervention. The decision paradigm that most reduced transmission also required the least resources. Given the simplicity of our model, we do not suggest that public health agencies should promote \u2018infection-counting\u2019. Rather, we conclude that public health agencies should prioritize local disease surveillance and risk communications efforts and believe that data-driven models can be instrumental in designing effective outbreak information campaigns.",
