Therefore, some health authorities have considered reusing masks after decontamination to remove any infectious material. Most health authorities do not recommend the reuse of masks, but several users have attempted to use various simple methods to reclaim them to protect against noninfectious ambient particulate matter (PM)\u2014particularly PM2.5, PM1 or PM0.1. NIOSH published a series of research articles on mask decontamination [7\u20139]. The filtering effectiveness of reclaimed filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) and masks varies among brands and decontamination methods, so relevant results are applicable only to FFRs treated under the same conditions. Therefore, further tests must be performed to evaluate the filtration performance of filters before and after reclamation. This investigation applied three types of disposable mask, N95 FFRs (Dust Respirator 8210; 3M, St. Paul, MN, N95), gauze double-layer electret masks (Gauze, commercialized type, China) and spunlace nonwoven masks (Spunlace, Oimo, Taiwan), all of which are frequently used, and which can be reused when hospitals in Taiwan have insufficient masks for frontline healthcare workers [4].",

            "text": "Effective reclamation of FFRs requires low penetration of sodium chloride (NaCl) particles, and low resistance to the flow of air through the filter [7,9]. The most frequently performed tests on filtration performance involve a polydispersed aerosol and evaluation of the most penetrating particle size (MPS) [10]. NaCl and dioctyl phthalate (DOP) are adopted as challenge aerosols with count median diameters (CMD) of 75 nm\u00b120 nm and 185 nm\u00b120 nm, and geometric standard deviations (GSD) of 1.86 and 1.6, respectively. ISO published test conditions include a numerical median particle size distribution (PSD) of between 60 nm and 100 nm, and electromobility diameters of 160nm and 210 nm for NaCl and liquid paraffin oil, respectively [11]. Both ISO conditions involve a polydispersed aerosol with a GSD of between 1.4 and 1.8. Calculations of penetration based on the published NIOSH and ISO criteria involve the penetration of particles of all sizes, instead of the penetration of particles of any specific size. The MPSs of various FFRs are not always within the standard range of CMD. Huang et al. observed that the MPS in electret filter media varies with face velocity, fiber diameter, packing density, filter thickness and charge density [12]. Current measurement methods can provide an accurate range of penetrating PSDs [13], and elucidate the penetration and filter quality for particles covering a wide range of particle sizes.",

For a given fiber diameter, packing density, and thickness, electret filters have much higher filtration efficiency than non-electret filters, particularly for submicron aerosols [12]. To assess the effect of charge density on filtration efficiency, filters were dipped in isopropanol to remove charges before measuring the filter quality [2]. The charge density of filters strongly affected the filtration efficiency. Reducing the charge density increased aerosol penetration. Treatment of N95 masks with isopropanol increased the penetration of particles larger than 50 nm, owing to a reduction in the charge density of the filter.",

However, respirator selection should prioritize penetration and fit factor and not qf. Neither mask in the study meets criteria for penetration despite their high qf. In current study, only the tested N95 masks matched the minimum 42 CFR Part 84 criteria [10] because they had both an acceptable pressure drop and penetration. In 2011, Viscusi et al.
