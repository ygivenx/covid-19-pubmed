It catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin II (Ang II) to angiotensin-(1\u20137) (Ang-(1\u20137)). Therefore, it determines the balance between the vasoconstrictor/pro-oxidative peptide Ang II, which is originally produced by ACE and acts via its receptor AT1, and the vasodilatory/antioxidative peptide Ang-(1\u20137), which interacts with its receptor Mas [5,6]. Consequently, the ACE2/Ang-(1\u20137)/Mas axis represents a protective arm of the RAS, which counteracts deleterious actions of the ACE/Ang II/AT1 axis. Accordingly, altered expression and/or activity of ACE2 have been associated with major cardiac and vascular pathophysiologies. ACE2-deficient mice exhibit a higher susceptibility to atherosclerosis [7\u20139], diabetic nephropathy [10,11], myocardial infarction [12], and cardiac hypertrophy [13\u201316].",

The release of nitric oxide (\u2022NO) plays a pivotal role in EF, mediating the crosstalk between endothelium and smooth muscle cells. Oxidation of \u2022NO by superoxide anion (\u2022O2-) and consequent formation of peroxynitrite (-ONOO) is discussed to be an important factor contributing to the development of endothelial dysfunction [2]. Furthermore, one of the pivotal hallmarks of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, including hypertension, diabetes, atherosclerosis, stroke, and heart failure, is reduction-oxidation (redox) imbalance, a condition, known as oxidative stress [17].",

In line with these observations, increased endothelium-dependent relaxation in response to acetylcholine (ACh) in vitro and improved EF in vivo has been observed in a transgenic rat model, overexpressing human ACE2 in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) [20].",

This mode of ACh application does not reduce the heart rate of the animals (S1 Fig), since ACh is degraded before reaching cardiac rhythm generators, and has been used before by our group to evaluate endothelial function in vivo in mice [19] and rats [20]. The vasodilatory response to ACh did not differ between ACE2-/y and WT mice over the dose range of 50 to 200 ng.kg-1 (Fig 1C). In contrast, the endothelium-independent response, elicited by SNP, was drastically increased in ACE2-/y mice (Fig 1D), arguing for an adaptation mechanism in the vascular smooth muscle cells. Normalization of the ACh response to the SNP revealed impairment in endothelium-dependent vascular reactivity in ACE2-/y mice (Fig 1E), indicating that genetic deletion of ACE2 may result in a novel equilibrium with an impaired endothelial release of vasodilators and an increased smooth muscle response to these substances.",

Indeed, evaluation of lipid peroxidation, which is an indicator of oxidative stress, revealed a significant increase in the levels of the TBARS, malondialdehyde (MDA), in plasma, urine, and aorta of ACE2-/y mice (Fig 4A\u20134C). Also direct measurement of the \u2022O2- release in the aorta showed an elevation in oxidative stress in ACE2-/y mice in comparison to WT animals (Fig 4D). However, ACE2 deletion did not affect aortic concentrations of H2O2 (Fig 4E), a \u2022O2- dismutation product generated by superoxide dismutase (SOD). Analysis of enzymes involved in ROS metabolism showed a significant decrease in both total SOD and catalase activity in aorta of ACE2-/y mice (Fig 4F and 4I, respectively). Concurrently, the mRNA levels of SOD1 (Fig 4G), but not SOD2 (Fig 4H) and catalase (Fig 4J) were lower in ACE2-/y than in WT mice.

Other groups may have missed the small change in blood pressure due to the mixed genetic background, high variability of the blood pressure data and a lack of statistical power. The potential reasons for these discrepant results have been comprehensively discussed [33]. Interestingly, the backcross of the ACE2-null allele to the FVB/N background led to a more dramatic blood pressure upregulation in the resulting animals (our unpublished data), similar to the phenotype observed in Mas-deficient mice on the C57BL/6 [5] and on the FVB/N [19] backgrounds, suggesting a protective role of the C57BL/6 background in blood pressure regulation.",

However, the response to the endothelium independent vasodilator, SNP, was enhanced in ACE2-/y mice, pointing to an adaptation process happening under chronic removal of ACE2. These in-vivo observations were reproduced in vitro in isolated aortic rings and are, therefore, not caused by any systemic alterations in these mice. Probably, the altered SNP-response of the smooth muscle layer is induced by the chronic reduction in eNOS activity in ACE2-deficient animals, since a similar phenomenon was observed in eNOS-deficient mice: SNP induced a markedly greater accumulation of cGMP in aortic rings of these animals compared to controls [34]. The underlying molecular mechanisms, however, remained elusive but involved an increased activity of soluble guanylate cyclase.",

            "text": "In this study we observed a drastic reduction in \u2022NO availability in ACE2-/y mice, which was obvious from a reduced \u2022NO release from intact aortic rings and a strong decrease in urinary concentration of NOx and plasmatic nitrite in ACE2-deficient mice. Nitrite serves as an indirect indicator of endothelial \u2022NO release, and is reduced also in humans with endothelial dysfunction [29]. According to our data, these reduced levels of \u2022NO in ACE2-/y mice are due to two different effects of ACE2 depletion: a reduction in active eNOS and an inactivation of \u2022NO by ROS. On one hand, the amount of phosphorylated eNOS at Ser1177, which modulates both the calcium sensitivity and activity of the enzyme, was significantly reduced in ACE2-/y mice compared to control animals. Since ACE2 deletion did not alter the AKT pathway, the decrease in eNOS activity must be regulated by AKT-independent mechanisms [35] and could at least partially be explained by its lowered expression level, whereby the mechanisms leading to this downregulation of eNOS expression need further elucidation. On the other hand, increased oxidative stress observed in ACE2-deficient mice may lead to the depletion of BH4 [36], a cofactor essential for the coupling of eNOS, and thereby shift the balance between \u2022NO and \u2022O2 generation by eNOS to the favor of the second [37,38], further decreasing \u2022NO levels and increasing ROS production in these mice. eNOS uncoupling is an important mechanism leading to pathologic \u2022O2- release in the vascular endothelium, which induces decline in \u2022NO availability. Quick oxidative inactivation of \u2022NO by \u2022O2-, and consequent formation of -ONOO, a potent oxidant [39], plays a pivotal role in the development of endothelial dysfunction [40]. These events are associated with an increase in lipid peroxidation, as we observed in the present study by monitoring increased systemic and aortic TBARS levels. Increased superoxide and peroxynitrite levels have also recently been found by other groups in ACE2-/y mice at baseline or after Ang II infusion and have been linked to increased NADPH oxidase activity [41,42].",

This hypothesis is supported by a significant reduction in aortic SOD and catalase activity in ACE2-/y mice, enzymes, which inactivate \u2022O2- [39]. and convert H2O2 to molecular oxygen and water [43]., respectively. These results are in accordance with those previously demonstrating that exogenous SOD improves the endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation response to ACh at basal conditions [44]. Moreover, increasing vascular SOD activity induces a significant improvement in arterial relaxation in cholesterol-fed rabbits [45]. Unexpectedly, the levels of H2O2 in aorta were similar in both strains. This may perhaps be due to the increase of GPx and the decrease of catalase activities in the aortas of ACE-/y mice, which counterbalance each other and normalize the H2O2 levels, since both enzymes are responsible for H2O2 degradation [43,46].",

Concurrently, Bodiga and colleagues [14] showed an exaggerated increase in \u2022O2- production, probably by NAD(P)H oxidase following pressure-overload induced by aortic constriction in ACE2-/y mice. The authors showed that Ang-(1\u20137) delivery by mini-osmotic pumps decreases the NAD(P)H oxidase activity and improves the early dilated cardiomyopathy in pressure-overloaded animals. Jin et al. [39], showed that endothelial dysfunction induced by Ang II infusion is exaggerated in ACE2-deficient mice mainly by hyperactive ROS generation. In hypertensive rats, overexpressing human ACE2 in VSMC endothelium-dependent relaxation increased in response to ACh in both, in vitro and in vivo conditions [20]. Furthermore, we and others [49,50] recently showed that pharmacological activation of ACE2 ameliorates endothelial dysfunction in hypertensive and diabetic animals. In two different mouse models lacking Mas, a central component of ACE2/Ang/(1\u20137)/Mas axis, we have shown that the increase in local and systemic oxidative stress, observed in these mice, was strongly correlated with in vivo endothelial dysfunction [19]. Hence, our and other reports show that the ACE2/Ang-(1\u20137)/Mas arm of the RAS regulates endothelial function by modulating the oxidative stress and \u2022NO release balance.",
