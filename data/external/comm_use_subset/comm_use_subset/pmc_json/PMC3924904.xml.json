The EV-71 genome is a single-stranded, positive sense RNA with approximately 7411 nucleotides, and consists of an open reading frame flanked by 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) [1]. Internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-dependent translation initiates synthesis of the viral polyprotein, which is subsequently cleaved into structural proteins (VP1-VP4) and non-structural proteins (2A-2C and 3A-3D). The RNA genome is enclosed in an icosahedral capsid assembled from 60 copies of each of the four structural proteins [2].",

EV-71 enters the cells through clathrin-mediated endocytosis and uncoats in the early endosomes. The viral RNA undergoes IRES-dependent translation, and the polyprotein is cleaved by 2A and 3C proteases into structural and non-structural proteins. Non-structural proteins are mainly involved in negative-sense and positive-sense RNA synthesis. The positive-sense viral RNA is then packed into the procapsid, which finally matures into infectious viral particles. Details of the EV-71 replication steps will be discussed according to their therapeutic targets [18,21,22].",

            "text": "Virus-host receptor interaction is the first essential event during virus infection. The ability to recognize and bind to specific receptors determines the host range and tissue tropism [24]. Cell surface carbohydrates such as heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan and sialic acid are often targeted by pathogens as attachment factors. EV-71 uses cell surface heparan sulfate [25] and sialylated glycan [26,27] as attachment receptors, which could concentrate the virus on the host cell surface and therefore enhance infectivity. Further interaction with entry receptors is required to initiate infection. Two functionally important entry receptors have been identified, scavenger receptor class B2 (SCARB2) and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) [28,29]. SCARB2 is expressed in all cell types and regarded as the major EV-71 entry receptor. At low endosomal pH, SCARB2 is needed to induce viral uncoating [30,31]. Human SCARB2 transgenic mice infected with EV-71 showed lethal neurological manifestations with pathological features similar to humans and monkeys, suggesting that SCARB2 contributes to its pathogenesis [32,33]. PSGL-1 is only present on neutrophils and leukocytes. EV-71 binds to PSGL-1 and enters the cells through the caveolar endocytosis pathway [34]. Transgenic mice expressing human PSGL-1 failed to enhance EV-71 infectivity, suggested that PSGL-1 alone does not contribute to its pathogenesis [35].",

The soluble form of cellular receptors could act as molecular decoys of cell-associated receptors. Soluble SCARB2, PSGL-1, sialic acid and heparin or heparin mimetics have been demonstrated to exhibit inhibitory effects against EV-71 infection in vitro[25,26,28,30,36]. Highly sulfated suramin and its analog, NF449, exhibited antiviral activity against EV-71 infection [25,37]. NF449-resistant mutants consist of two mutations in VP1, E98Q and K244R, implying that NF449 inhibited EV-71 infection by binding to the VP1 protein [37]. Similarly, kappa carrageenan, a sulfated polysaccharide from seaweed, also exhibited significant antiviral activity through targeting EV-71 attachment and entry [38]. The mechanism of these soluble decoys is possibly by disruption of the integrity of the EV-71 capsid structure or steric hindrance of receptor interactions.",

A second uncoating event occurs after endocytosis, and an unknown trigger causes RNA expulsion from the A-particles via the 2-fold axis, leaving behind an empty capsid [44]. Formation of the 135S A-particle happens in the presence of SCARB2 receptors and a low pH environment, suggesting that the A-particle is formed in the early endosomes [30,31]. Uncoating inhibitors (pocket binders) have been intensively studied as antiviral agents against many picornaviruses, including rhinovirus [45], PV [45], echovirus [46] and coxsackievirus [47]. The complex of WIN51711 with the EV-71 hydrophobic pocket underneath the canyon depression has recently been resolved by X-ray crystallography [48]. The key success factor of these uncoating inhibitors is their ability to fit into the VP1 hydrophobic pocket, stabilize the capsid structure, and therefore block the receptor-induced uncoating mechanism [48].",

However, a single point mutation in VP1 V192M was sufficient to confer resistance to BPROZ-194 [51]. Other than modified WIN compounds, the broad spectrum enterovirus inhibitor pleconaril also inhibited EV-71 infection in vitro and in vivo[55,56]. However, pleconaril failed to inhibit the cytopathic effect induced by a Taiwan 1998 EV-71 isolate [49]. Another group of capsid binders, pyridazinyl oxime ethers chemically derived from pirodavir such as BTA39 and BTA188, significantly inhibited EV-71 infection [57]. Crystallographic studies showed the pirodavir predecessor R61837 complexed with rhinovirus 14 by binding to the hydrophobic pocket underneath the canyon floor, similar to the mechanism of WIN compounds [58]. 4\u2032,6-Dichloroflavan (BW683C), previously identified as an anti-rhinovirus compound, was also effective against EV-71 infection [59,60]. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that BW683C binds to and stabilizes rhinovirus to heat or acid inactivation, implying that BW682C acts as viral uncoating inhibitor [61-63].",

In addition, short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was effective against EV-71 infection in vitro and in vivo[70-72]. The use of siRNA in clinical settings is hampered by its short half-life in plasma. Improved siRNA with 2\u2032O methylation and 2\u2032 fluoro modifications have recently been demonstrated against EV-71 infection [67]. However, siRNA also has poor endosomal uptake which limits the clinical application of these siRNAs. Other translation suppressing nucleotides, for example, peptide conjugated phosphodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PPMO) showed promising results in inhibiting PV and coxsackievirus B3 [73,74]. Unlike siRNA or shRNA, PPMO interacts with targeted RNA, especially the IRES region, and blocks ribosome recruitment and therefore inhibits viral RNA translation [66]. PPMO readily penetrates the cells and is resistant to nuclease degradation. Our unpublished data confirms that PMO are highly effective against EV-71.",

X-ray crystallography of the complex of EV-71 3C protease with rupintrivir revealed that the half-closed S2 sub-site and the size reduced S1\u2032 pocket of EV-71 3C protease limits the access of the rupintrivir\u2019s P1\u2032 group which contains a lactam ring [94,95].

Compound 10b significantly inhibited EV-71 infection [96]. An orally bioavailable 3C protease inhibitor, designated as compound 1, also exhibited antiviral activities against multiple rhinovirus serotypes and enteroviruses in vitro[89].

The membranous vesicles induced during PV infection have been reported to be associated with autophagy signalling [98,99]. These compartments resemble the autophagosomes and consist of viral proteins as well as microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-II (LC3-II). LC3-II is the membrane-bound form of LC3 that serves as the marker of autophagy induction [100]. During PV infection, these double-membrane vesicles consist of viral particles that undergo autophagic maturation typically characterized by LC3-II co-localization with lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) [100]. Similarly, EV-71 induces autophagy formation in RD and SK-N-SH cells, and association between autophagosome-like vesicles and EV-71 VP1 in neurons of the cervical spinal cords of mice was observed [101]. The authors concluded that autophagic signalling induced by EV-71 is crucial for EV-71 replication. This provides an alternative antiviral strategy for EV-71 to target host factors related to autophagy that are crucial for viral replication.",

The high replication and mutation rates of enteroviruses may generate resistance to these direct-acting antivirals. Targeting host factors may establish a higher genetic barrier to resistance and can be used in combination with viral inhibitors. The compound GW5074, a Raf-1 inhibitor, has been shown to influence EV-71 viral yield [37,102]. Activation of the Raf-1/ERK pathway in host cells induces autophagy signalling [103]. The downstream transducer of this pathway, BNIP3 competes with Beclin 1 for binding with Bcl-2 during autophagy induction [104]. GW5074 may impair autophagy activation through the inhibition of the Raf-1/ERK pathway. Thus, the replication of EV-71 that requires autophagosome formation may be inhibited in the presence of the GW5074 compound. Heat shock protein 90 beta (HSP90\u03b2), an isomer of HSP90, has been reported to have crucial roles in EV-71 entry and assembly. Geldanamycin (GA) and its analog, 17-allyamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG), inhibit HSP90\u03b2 activities and protect hSCARB2 transgenic mice from the challenge with EV-71 [105].",

            "text": "The amino acid sequences of the non-structural proteins of EV-71 are highly conserved and have more than 60% similarity to PV. Two hydrophobic regions are found in the 2B viral protein of PV and are pivotal for its viroporin functionality [108]. 2B viroporin mediates the integration of viral protein into the ER membrane and this increases the membrane permeability to promote virus release [108]. A study has reported that EV-71 2B protein might mediate a chloride-dependent current in oocytes. A chloride-dependent current inhibitor, 4,4\u2032-diisothiocyano-2,2\u2032-stilbenedisulfonic acid (DIDS) has been reported to inhibit EV-71 infection in RD cells [109]. The 2C viral protein of PV consists of Walker A, B and C motifs that are homologous to the motifs found in NTP-binding proteins or in members of the helicase superfamily III [110]. An amphipathic helix domain is located at the N-terminal of 2C viral protein that has the function of promoting oligomerization [110]. Recently, two antiviral compounds, metrifudil (N-(2-methylphenyl) methyl adenosine) and N6-benzyladenosine, blocked EV-71 replication via interaction with 2C viral protein or 2BC precursor protein [37]. Mutants resistant to metrifudil had a mutation in the 2C viral protein (E325G), while N6-benzyladenosine-resistant mutants had double mutations at the 2C viral protein (H118Y and I324M) [37]. However, the mechanism of inhibition is yet to be determined. Both MRL-1237 and TBZE-029, derivatives of benzimidazole, exhibit antiviral activity against various enteroviruses, and have been identified to target the picornaviral 2C viral protein [111,112]. Both of these derivatives may exert potent antiviral activity against EV-71 since EV-71 and PV shared high similarity in all the non-structural proteins. Guanidine hydrochloride is an extensively-studied picornavirus inhibitor [113,114], which inhibits the replication of PV [115,116], coxsackieviruses [117], echoviruses, and foot-and-mouth disease virus [118]. Interestingly, guanidine hydrochloride also inhibits EV-71 infection and a single mutation, M193L at the 2C protein was sufficient to confer resistance [119]. This agent is likely to prevent the association of 2C/2BC with host membrane structures during viral replication [120].",
