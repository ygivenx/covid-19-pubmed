Some patients afflicted by autonomic encephalitis may progress to a more generalized encephalopathy with movement disorder (4). Nonspecific viral infections may lead to breaking immune tolerance and increase the possibility of the antibodies to enter CNS by increasing the permeability of the blood-brain barrier. Occasionally a tumor that produces the target neuronal antigen likely contributes in triggering the immune response. However in many of autoimmune encephalitis disorders the blood brain barrier seems to be intact and the autoantibodies may be synthetized inside the CNS (10).",

The neurologist consultant even tried ketamine, which has had promising effects in controlling refractory status epilepticus, when midazolam, propofol and phenobarbital, failed to control seizures (7). The differential diagnosis were as follows: Fever-induced refractory epileptic encephalopathy (FIRES), infectious and autoimmune encephalitis, however work-ups had not revealed any evidence of any specific diagnosis, at last we assume that he was afflicted by viral infectious encephalitis as he had, fever, vomiting, and prodromal symptoms of infectious (most probably viral) disease, prior to onset of the seizure attacks. Autoimmune encephalitis was considered because of the refractory course and abnormal movements occurred in the course of the illness and ruled out as the antibodies\u2019panel of cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) was negative and no response seen to high dose of methylprednisolone and intravenous immunoglobulin administration.
