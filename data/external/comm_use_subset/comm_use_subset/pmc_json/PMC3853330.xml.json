Among these we recall the HLA-DR and -DQ genes and the HLA-DR15 haplotype in Caucasians [28]. The presence of some breakdown in the peripheral immune tolerance mechanisms that allows the activation of Teff [20,29-32] represents another condition that has been taken into consideration. This scenario has been observed both in mice [33,34] and in humans [35,36]. Furthermore it has been observed in MS and type 1 diabetic patients the presence of a dysfunction of the Treg function and an imbalance in Teff-Treg cross-regulation mechanisms [37,38].

It features an extensive documentation and multiple tutorials and a worldwide community that furnishes great support. It is free and open-source and cross-platform. NetLogo represents a good choice to simulate multi-agents, networks and complex dynamical systems [46]. Another choice for developing the ABM model was represented by the use of a general purpose computer language, for example ANSI C. We used such an approach several times [47-52]. However, NetLogo allowed a faster developing of the model as, at this stage, we did not manage a large quantity of details, entities and interactions. Moreover models developed in NetLogo can be easily shared as Java applets i.e., they are able to be run in almost (if not all) computer platforms. Finally NetLogo models take advantage of the graphical interface that easily allows the plot of various entities dynamics. Of course the implementation of a more detailed model would require the flexibility and the speed given by the use of a pure programming language. For huge simulations, parallel computing is highly advisable and the use of a programming language as C is imperative.",

To this end we built a model that uses a grid of 51x51 cells (namely patches) to simulate a small portion of white matter. Every patch is colored in light gray and is initialized at the beginning of the simulation with non-zero quantity init_mye of myelin that covers the axons in healthy patients. In order to simulate recoverable and unrecoverable damage, we supposed that every patch that is attacked by Teff loses a given value of myelin ate_mye, in this case the patch is colored in dark gray to simulate the presence of damage. If the patch still contains a quantity of myelin that is greater than zero, the damage can be recovered (recoverable damage) at every time-step with a given rate rec_mye up to the initial quantity init_mye; otherwise (i.e. the remaining quantity of myelin is zero) the patch is colored in black and the damage cannot be recovered anymore (unrecoverable damage). This mechanism is supported by several facts in reality. Resident oligodendrocytes (if still present) are activated and are able to restore the lost percentage of myelin [11]. We used a time-step of \u0394(t) = 2.4 hours. We chose such a time-step because it allowed to keep, from a temporal point of view, a good degree of granularity that enabled to simulate singular relapses, yet allowing to reproduce, using reasonable computational resources, the progress of the disease in a time-window of five years (18250 time steps).",

As in the paper by V\u00e9lez de Mendiz\u00e1bal et al. [13], both the introduction of resting Teff and Treg is done using trains of 100 randomly distributed impulses per year.

However activated Treg are able to counterbalance Teff actions maintaining immune homeostasis. This is visible in Figure 4 where we show the levels of damage (recoverable, unrecoverable and total) for all the simulations. In this figure it is possible to see the presence of some spikes in the recoverable damage plots (blue lines) that obviously correspond to the spikes seen in Figure 2.

In this case the spikes in the reversible damage plots (blue lines) are higher and bigger in number. It is also possible to observe the appearing of unrecoverable damage that indicates the appearing MS plaques and to see how the sum of both (total damage, black plots) mimics the typical relapsing-remmiting dynamics observed in MS. Presence of scarring can be also seen in Figure 7 where the spatial plots for all individuals are presented at the end of 5 years.

Figure shows the logic implemented into the model, including the genetic predisposition in developing the pathology (i.e. thyms selection of self-reactive clones), the presence of an external trigger (i.e. EBV), the supposed malfunction of the Treg-Teff mechanism, and the effects caused by the malfunction (i.e. neural damage due to myelin loss). Self-reactive resting Teff and Treg cells are introduced by Thymus selection. An external factor such as EBV latent infection can cause activation of both Teff and Treg cells. Activated Teff cells can then attack myelin causing damage in the brain and duplicate, activated Treg will downregulate Teff receiving a positive feedback from that. reversible damage can be recovered.",
