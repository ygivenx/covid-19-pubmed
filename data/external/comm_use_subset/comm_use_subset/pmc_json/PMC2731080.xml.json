            "text": "The need to analyse the massive accumulation of biological data generated by high-throughput human genome projects has stimulated the development of new and rapid computational methods. Computational approaches for predicting and classifying protein functions are essential in determining the functions of unknown proteins in a faster and more cost-effective manner, because experimentally determining protein function is both costly and time-consuming. Approaches based on sequence and structure comparisons play an important role in predicting and classifying the function of unknown proteins. Generally, if an unknown gene or protein sequence is identified, researchers may carry out a sequence similarity search using BLAST [1], PSI-BLAST [2], or FASTA [3] to find similar proteins or annotation information in public databases. However, proteins that have diverged from a common ancestral gene may have the same function but different sequences [4,5]. As a result, sequence similarity-based approaches are often inadequate in the absence of similar sequences or when the sequence similarity among known protein sequences is statistically weak (called the \"twilight zone\" or \"midnight zone\") [6-12]. Thus, researchers should be cautious when using this approach, because its efficiency is limited by the availability of annotated sequences in public databases and a high-similarity BLAST search result does not always imply homology [13,14]. Structure similarity-based approaches \u2013 such as Deli[15] or MATRAS [16], both of which use structure comparisons \u2013 have routinely been used to identify proteins with similar structures, because protein structural information is better conserved than sequence information [17,18]. Nevertheless, proteins with the same function can have different structures, and a structural comparison through structure determination is more difficult than a sequence comparison [9,19,20].",

Rather than making predictions based on direct sequence or structural comparisons, these approaches use various features to predict protein function, such as protein length, molecular weight, number of atoms, grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY), amino acid composition, periodicity, physicochemical properties, predicted secondary structures, subcellular location, sequence motifs or highly conserved regions, and annotations in protein databases. These features include statistics extracted from the protein sequence, structure, and annotation. In addition, to obtain good predictive power, various machine-learning algorithms such as support vector machines (SVMs), neural networks, na\u00efve Bayes classifiers, and ensemble classifiers have been used to build classification and prediction models. Of these, the most widely used machine-learning algorithm for classification and prediction of protein function is SVM [5-7,22,26,27,29,31,36,39-43,45].",

[29]. Classification of protein function was performed using an SVM statistical learning algorithm, based on features such as amino acid composition, hydrophobicity, solvent accessibility, secondary structure, surface tension, charge, polarisability, polarity, and normalised van der Waals volume. Cai et al. [29] found that the testing accuracy of protein classification was in the range 84\u201396% and suggested that amino acid composition, hydrophobicity, polarity, and charge play more critical roles than other features. Recently, Tung et al. [40] proposed a prediction method for ubiquitylation sites using three datasets (amino acid identity, physicochemical properties, and evolutionary information) and three machine-learning algorithms (k-nearest neighbour, SVM, and na\u00efve Bayes). The greatest accuracy (72.19%) was obtained using SVM with 531 physicochemical properties as features. Moreover, accuracy improved from 72.19% to 84.44% when 31 physicochemical properties were selected and used based on feature selection by an informative physicochemical property mining algorithm (IPMA). In addition, Li et al. [45] demonstrated the ability of the SVM prediction method to identify potential drug targets. On the basis of amino acid composition, hydrophobicity, polarity, polarisability, charge, solvent accessibility, and normalised van der Waals volume, they obtained an accuracy of 84% in predicting known drug targets versus putative nondrug targets. In that study, the performance of the SVM model did not change significantly with a greater number of negative targets, as determined from experiments using various ratios of negative to positive samples.",

In comparing the performance of classifiers for predicting glycosylation sites, Caragea et al. [52] demonstrated that ensembles of SVM classifiers outperformed single SMV classifiers. In addition, Guan et al. [51] illustrated the benefits of using an SVM-based ensemble framework by analysing the performance of ensembles of three classifiers as a single SVM, a hierarchically corrected combination of SVMs, and na\u00efve Bayes classifiers. Ge et al. [53] provided evidence that ensemble classifiers outperform single decision tree classifiers by comparing C4.5 with several ensemble classifiers (i.e. random forest, stacked generalisation, bagging, AdaBoost, LogitBoost, and MultiBoost) for classification of premalignant pancreatic cancer mass-spectrometry data. A prediction method using a domain-based random forest of decision trees to infer protein-protein interactions (PPIs) was proposed by Chen et al.[46]; in experiments using a Saccharomyces cerevisiae dataset, they showed that the random-forest method achieved higher sensitivity (79.78%) and specificity (64.38%) than maximum likelihood estimation (MLE).",

However, in most of the previous studies, features that represent subtle distinctions in small portions of protein sequences have not been sufficiently represented. Although proteins share similar structural organisations, biological properties, and sequences, small changes in amino acids of a protein sequence can result in different functions [19,20,56]. Although local information such as the presence of motifs or highly conserved regions is useful for function prediction, motif detection problems present another arduous task.

The dataset included positive and negative samples for 11 protein functions selected from the Swiss-Prot database [57] using the SRS program [58]. Positive samples are sample sequences associated with a specific protein function and were labelled as belonging to that class of proteins. Negative samples for each protein class were selected from proteins that do not belong to that class and from enzyme families such as oxidoreductases, hydrolases, lyases, and isomerases. For example, the composition of the negative sample set for fatty acid metabolism is shown in Table 1. Proteins that consisted of fewer than 30 amino acids were excluded from the dataset. In the feature extraction step, proteins that had missing values were also excluded. For hypothetically or automatically annotated sequences in protein databases such as GenBank and Swiss-Prot, the percentage of incorrect annotations is not known, because the annotations do not include a description of the specific methodology used for sequence analysis; this sometimes yields incorrect search results [14].

Let us assume that the x value is the 76th amino acid (21%), the y value is the 113th amino acid (30%), and the value of PNP is 4. PNPRDist(21,30) is thus (4/375) \u00d7 100 = 1.06667.

In addition, classification and prediction performance can be improved by avoiding overfitting.

Feature subset selection techniques can be organised into two categories: filter and wrapper methods. Filter methods, which apply statistical approaches without any information on the classification algorithm, are used to select a specific subset of potentially discriminating features. Wrapper methods use a machine-learning algorithm, called a perfect \"black box,\" to assess the quality of a feature subset. For this study, correlation-based feature selection (CFS) [34,65] was used to select a subset of discriminative features. CFS was chosen for the following reasons. First, when the number of features is large, filter methods are faster than wrapper methods because the former do not require the use of learning machines. In addition, filter methods can be used as a preprocessing step to reduce space dimensionality and preclude overfitting. Second, selection and evaluation of a subset of features is preferable to individually important features because a superior classifier can be constructed from features that interact or by a combination of many features that together have discriminatory power. Even if one or two features are not useful alone, these features may be valuable in combination with other features and thus improve the discriminatory performance of a classifier [64].",

It eliminates irrelevant features, as they will be poor predictors of classes. In addition, redundant features are identified that will be highly correlated with one or more other features. A heuristic search to traverse the space of the feature set is conducted, and the subset with the highest merit found during the search process is reported. The subset with the highest merit preserves the most important features \u2013 those that are highly correlated with the class and have low inter-correlation with one another.

The cost parameter used in the training process was selected from {0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12}. For the datasets used in this study, the RBF was found to provide the best results. In the random forest method without feature selection analysis, the number of trees was 10 and the number of features was 9. In the random forest method with feature selection analysis, the number of trees was 10 and the number of features was 6 or 7 because the number of features selected by the feature selection method was small.",

PPR and NNR for guanine nucleotide-releasing factor were higher than for the negative samples. For example, the NNR for guanine nucleotide-releasing factor was 7.04 (mean) \u00b1 1.72 (standard deviation), while the NNR for the negative samples was 3.79 \u00b1 2.0. It is worth noting that negatively charged residues appear more frequently in the guanine nucleotide-releasing factor sequence than in those of other proteins. Furthermore, the NNR and PPR features are related to the number or percentage of negatively and positively charged residues, as these features were computed using a method based on charged residues. Because of this relationship, the mean percentages of positively charged residues and negatively charged residues were found to be similar to the PPR and NNR values, respectively. If the PPR for a specific protein family was high compared to that for other families, then the number of positively charged residues in that protein family was also higher than that in other families; similarly, if the NNR for a specific protein family was low, then the number of negatively charged residues in that protein family was also low. However, if the percentage of negatively charged residues was high and the NNR value was low, it is possible to infer that both negatively and positively charged residues are present in the sequences, because NNR and PPR provide information on whether the two charged residue types co-exist in the sequence. The greater the difference between the percent negatively charged residues and the NNR, the more frequent is the alternating occurrences of negatively and positively charged residues. For instance, golgi transport protein 1 [Swiss-Prot:Q9USJ2] consists of 129 amino acids with five negatively charged residues and eight positively charged residues. However, NNR and PPR were 0 and 2.32, respectively. This indicates that although the protein includes five negatively charged residues, the positively and negatively charged residues in the sequence always alternate among the neutral residues.",

For example, Verma et al. [79] analysed a large panel of plaque-purified recovered viruses and demonstrated that the negatively charged residues at positions 440 and 441 were key residues that appeared to be involved in virus assembly. Therefore, although the total number of positively and negatively charged residues is important, residues in specific positions or local regions of the sequences are also important. Dist(x, y) for PPR, NNR, and PNPR provides information on negatively and positively charged residues in local regions of the sequence. Seven features that provide local information were selected for classification of the guanine nucleotide-releasing factor. For example, PNPRDist(61,70) was 1.29 \u00b1 0.42 for the positive classification samples and 0.72 \u00b1 0.53 for the negative samples. These findings indicate that alternating positively and negatively charged residues occur more frequently in the local region from 61% to 70% in the guanine nucleotide-releasing factor sequence than in the negative protein samples. Therefore, local information on the distribution of negatively and positively charged residues in the interval was informative. Because of these essential differences, guanine nucleotide-releasing factor proteins can be predicted with a high level of accuracy.",
