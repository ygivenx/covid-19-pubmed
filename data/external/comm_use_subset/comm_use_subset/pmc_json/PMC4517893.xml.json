            "text": "For both cells and viruses, the functionality of RNA molecules usually requires correct folding into proper tertiary structures and the association with correct RNA-binding proteins [1,2]. To make the scenario more complex, RNA molecules frequently function via transient base pairing with target RNAs and/or dynamic association/dissociation with distinct RNA-binding proteins [3]. However, correct folding of RNAs is quite challenging and time-consuming, because RNAs can easily become trapped in thermodynamically stable intermediates that are misfolded and inactive. In response, cells and viruses encode a variety of \u201chelper\u201d or RNA remodeling proteins, such as RNA helicases and RNA chaperones, that can destabilize RNA-RNA or RNA-DNA base pairing, thereby lowing the thermodynamic barrier between RNA conformations and promoting the proper formation of RNA tertiary structures [4\u20136]. It is believed that RNA remodeling proteins play pivotal roles in nearly all processes involving RNA molecules.",

They are thought to participate in most ATP-dependent remodeling of structured RNAs and are classified into six superfamilies (SFs), designated SF1 to SF6, on the basis of conserved helicase motifs [7]. On the other hand, RNA chaperones are a heterogeneous group of proteins that share no consensus sequences or motifs but are able to destabilize RNA duplexes and assist in the formation of more globally stable RNA structures. The major difference between RNA chaperones and helicases is that RNA chaperones do not require ATP binding or hydrolysis for their remodeling activities [8]. (Of note, the definition of RNA chaperones is sometimes blurred, as some publications have defined helicases as a subgroup of ATP-dependent RNA chaperones [2]. Herein, like in most publications, we define RNA helicases and chaperones as two separate classes of the RNA remodelers for the sake of clarity.)",

These highly structured RNA elements require RNA helicases or chaperones to aid in their proper folding and re-folding. Moreover, during vRNA replication, replicative intermediate double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) must be unwound by virus-encoded or cellular RNA helicases; therefore, vRNA templates can be efficiently re-utilized to synthesize more progeny vRNA strands. Thus far, a variety of RNA viruses, such as flavivirus NS3 [9], alphavirus NSP2 [10], coronavirus nsp13 [11], and alphatetravirus Hel [12], have been reported to encode their own RNA helicases, and the majority of them belong to helicase SF1 and SF2 [7].",

            "text": "Enteroviruses are a large group of positive-stranded RNA viruses in the Picornaviridae family that contain numerous important human pathogens, including poliovirus, enterovirus 71 (EV71), coxsackie viruses, and echoviruses. They cause approximately 3 billion human infections annually and are responsible for a wide spectrum of diseases, ranging from relatively mild conditions, such as common cold, upper respiratory illness, and hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD), to severe conditions such as aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, myocarditis, neonatal sepsis-like disease, and poliomyelitis [13]. So far, although vaccination has almost eradicated poliomyelitis worldwide [14], no effective vaccine or antiviral therapy is available for many other important human enteroviruses, particularly neurotropic EV71, which is the major causative pathogen for HFMD and a serious lethal threat to children. Enterovirus encodes a single polyprotein that is proteolytically cleaved into separate structural and nonstructural proteins. Among them, the multifunctional protein 2CATPase is the most conserved and complex but the least understood (Fig 1A). Enterovirus 2CATPase has been reported to participate in diverse processes, including RNA binding [15,16], RNA replication [17\u201319], membrane anchoring and rearrangement [20,21], autophagy inhibition [22], encapsidation and viral morphogenesis [23,24], and suppression of nuclear factor kappa B activation [25]. 2CATPase has long been predicted as a putative SF3 helicase on the basis of its AAA+ ATPase activity and conserved SF3 signature motifs (Fig 1B) [26,27]. Similar to other well-defined SF3 helicases, such as Simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen (LTag), human papillomavirus (HPV) E1, and adeno-associated virus (AAV) Rep, enterovirus 2CATPase has been reported to form homo-oligomeric ring-like structures in vitro, which is required for its ATPase activity [28]. Moreover, this protein appears to associate with vRNA in the vRNA replication complexes in infected cells [29], implying that 2CATPase directly participates in enteroviral RNA replication. However, previous attempts to determine the helicase activity associated with 2CATPase or other enteroviral proteins have been unsuccessful [27]. Thus, whether enteroviral or picornaviral RNA replication requires the involvement of any virus-encoded RNA remodeling activity is not known, and this gap hinders our understanding of this large group of medically important pathogenic viruses.",

            "text": "Interestingly, our previous study of the 2CATPase protein from Ectropis obliqua picorna-like virus (EoV; genus Iflavirus, family Iflaviridae, order Picornavirales) revealed that EoV 2CATPase possesses RNA remodeling activity that is more like the activity of an RNA chaperone since EoV 2CATPase can destabilize RNA duplexes and accelerate strand annealing in an ATP-independent manner [30]. This finding obtained from an insect picorna-like virus prompted us to determine whether enterovirus 2CATPase could be an RNA remodeler. Herein, we report that although bacterially expressed EV71 2CATPase did not exhibit any RNA remodeling activity, eukaryotically expressed EV71 2CATPase functions not only as an RNA helicase that unwinds RNA helices from 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 in an ATP-dependent manner but also as an RNA chaperone that destabilizes helices from either direction and facilitates strand annealing and complex RNA structure formation independently of ATP. Moreover, we determined the domain requirements for these two RNA remodeling activities associated with 2CATPase and showed that protein 2CATPase facilitates the EV71 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP)-mediated synthesis of vRNA from vRNA template in vitro. When the helicase activity of 2CATPase was disrupted by point mutation, the RNA replication and virus production of EV71 were mostly abolished in cells. These data indicate that 2CATPase-mediated RNA remodeling plays a critical role in the enteroviral life cycle, particularly in enteroviral replication. In addition, our data show that the RNA helicase and chaperoning activities are also conserved in CAV16 2CATPase.",

The computation-generated structural modeling of 2CATPase indicated that this protein may be comprised of three structurally independent domains: the N-terminal domain (NTD) contains 113 amino acids (a.a.) and is predicted as a helix bundle formed by three \u03b1 helices; the middle helicase core (HC) domain includes a.a. 114\u2013250 of 2CATPase, and is predicted as a central five-stranded \u03b2-sheet flanked by \u03b1 helices on both sides; and the C-terminal domain (CTD) includes a.a. 251\u2013329 and contains several \u03b1 helices. The three domains are linked by flexible loops (Fig 1C). The crystallographic structures of AAV2 Rep40 and Rep40-ADP complex have been previously resolved [32,33]. Our structural alignment of EV71 2CATPase and AAV2 Rep40 shows that the predicted HC domain of 2CATPase is structurally similar with the counterpart region of Rep40. Moreover, similarly with Rep40, 2CATPase is also predicted to contain a P-loop connecting with the central \u03b2-sheet, and the predicted ATP binding site of 2CATPase is also exposed to the exterior and perfectly overlapped with the structurally determined ATP/ADP binding site of Rep40 in the structural alignment of these two proteins (Fig 1D). Altogether, our sequence and structural analyses indicate that enterovirus 2CATPase is similar to other viral SF3 helicases in both conserved motifs and structures, implying that this protein should contain some RNA remodeling activity.",

Interestingly, the eukaryotically expressed MBP-2CATPase had an apparently higher molecular mass than the prokaryotically expressed one (Fig 1E, lanes 4 vs. 3). The identity and purity of the eukaryotically expressed MBP-2CATPase were further confirmed via SDS-PAGE separation followed by silver staining (S1 Fig) or in-gel digestion and high-performance Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis (S1 Table and S1 Text). In total, four proteins (MBP-2CATPase, \u03b1-tubulin, actin and cytochrome P450) were identified with FDR value of 0.97%. MBP-2CATPase turned out to be the highest scoring protein (score: 11200) identified with high protein coverage of 81.6%. The mass spectrometry results showed that the majority (97.8%) of all the spectra obtained in the purified protein sample were originated from MBP-2CATPase. The quantitation information by Mascot Exponentially Modified Protein Abundance Index (emPAI) further confirmed the purity of our target protein: the emPAI value of MBP-2CATPase is 126.76, in comparison to the other three identified proteins including \u03b1-tubulin, actin and cytochrome P450 from Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cell with very low emPAI values of 0.65, 0.11, 0.07, respectively. Furthermore, to examine the oligomerization state of MBP-2CATPase, the purified eukaryotically expressed MBP-2CATPase was subjected to the size exclusion chromatography analysis using a Superdex 200 column. The major peak comprised most protein that was eluted as a molecular mass of ~600 kDa (S2A Fig), and the eluted protein was ~85 kDa in size as determined by 10% SDS-PAGE and silver staining (S2B Fig), indicating that the eukaryotically expressed MBP-2CATPase is oligomerized, consistent with previous studies of poliovirus 2CATPase [28].",

The helix unwinding assay was conducted by incubating the RNA helix substrate with purified MBP-2CATPase, followed by gel electrophoresis. Interestingly, our data showed that, although bacterially expressed MBP-2CATPase did not unwind the RNA helix in the presence of MgCl2 and ATP (Fig 1F, lane 5), consistent with observations reported previously by another group [27], eukaryotically expressed MBP-2CATPase efficiently unwound the RNA helix substrate under the same conditions (Fig 1F and Fig 2A). Of note, EoV 2CATPase and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3 [30,34] were used as positive controls in this assay (Fig 2A). Moreover, EV71 2CATPase could unwind the RNA duplex with 42 matched base pairs but not the duplex with 49 matched base pairs (S3 Fig), as the latter substrate might be too long to be unwound. Altogether, these results indicate that EV71 2CATPase can unwind an RNA helix when the protein is eukaryotically expressed.",

Our results showed that the ATPase activity of EV71 2CATPase was strictly Mg2+-dependent, as this protein was almost unable to hydrolyze ATP in the absence of Mg2+ (Fig 4F). On the other hand, although 2CATPase requires the presence of Mg2+ to reach its optimal unwinding activity, it was still able to unwind a portion of the RNA helix in the absence of Mg2+ or any divalent ions (Fig 4G, lane 3; S4D Fig, lane 3), further confirming that 2CATPase retains partial helix unwinding activity in the absence of its ATPase activity. Moreover, when the Mg2+ concentration was lower than 2 or 2.5 mM, increasing Mg2+ concentrations gradually promoted both the ATPase and helix unwinding activities of EV71 2CATPase (Fig 4F and 4G), whereas at higher Mg2+ concentrations (>2.5 mM), Mg2+ inhibited both activities in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 4F and 4H). Of note, both no protein supplementation and boiled MBP-2CATPase were used as negative controls (S4C Fig, lanes 1 and 5). In addition, the biochemical properties of EV71 2CATPase, including the requirement of divalent ions (Mn2+, Ca2+, and Zn2+) and pH, were also determined (S4D\u2013S4F Fig). Our data showed that while 2.5 mM Ca2+ is dispensable for the helix unwinding activity of EV71 2CATPase, 2.5 mM Mn2+ or Zn2+ blocked the helix unwinding by 2CATPase (S4D Fig). When the concentration of Zn2+ is higher than 0.5 mM, the presence of Zn2+ completely blocked the helix unwinding activity of 2CATPase (S4E Fig). Moreover, EV71 2CATPase prefers a neutral pH as an optimal reaction condition, as this protein exhibited the highest helix unwinding activity with pH 7.5 (S4F Fig).",

            "text": "To distinguish these two activities, we designed a set of experiments based on their fundamental difference in helix unwinding directionality and ATP dependency. First, we constructed two RNA helix substrates, each of which contained the same 42-bp double-stranded region as well as a 6-nt 3\u2032 or 5\u2032 single-stranded protrusion (Fig 5A). Then, each helix substrate was reacted with MBP-2CATPase in the absence or presence of ATP. Our results showed that although the 2CATPase unwound the 3\u2032-protruded helix in an ATP-dependent manner (Fig 5B and 5E), it unwound the 5\u2032-protruded helix exactly like an RNA chaperone, which was able to unwind the helix in the absence of ATP, and increasing ATP concentrations could not further enhance the helix unwinding (Fig 5C and 5E). Moreover, since the motif A \u201cGKS\u201d is recognized as the NTP binding site and the core ATPase site of SF3 helicases, we generated the ATPase-defective GK134AA mutant of 2CATPase. Our data showed that the GK134AA 2CATPase mutant was able to unwind the 5\u2032-protruded helix substrate in the absence or presence of ATP at an efficiency similar to that of wild-type 2CATPase, further confirming that the unwinding of the 5\u2032-protruded helix by 2CATPase is independent of its ATPase activity (Fig 5D and 5E). Furthermore, the unwinding activity of 2CATPase on the 5\u2032-protruded helix could not be promoted by any individual NTP (S5 Fig). Altogether, our data indicate that the 5\u2032-protruded helix could be unwound via the RNA chaperone activity but not the helicase activity of 2CATPase, whereas the 3\u2032-protruded helix substrate could be unwound via both activities. These findings are consistent with our previous observation that 2CATPase unwinds the 3\u2032-protruded RNA helix more efficiently than the 5\u2032-protruded one in the presence of ATP (Fig 3C).",

Two 42-nt complementary RNA strands, each of which formed defined stem-loop structures, were designed and constructed (Fig 6A). Of the two, one strand was 5\u2032 HEX-labeled, and the other was not labeled as indicated. Equal amounts of HEX-labeled and non-labeled strands were incubated in the presence or absence of MBP-2CATPase, and then gel shift assays were conducted to examine the hybridization of the two strands. Of note, all the experiments were ATP-free. Our results showed that although minimal spontaneous hybridization could be observed in the absence of 2CATPase (Fig 6B, lanes 3\u20134; Fig 6C, lane 3; and Fig 6D, lanes 3\u20136), the presence of EV71 2CATPase dramatically enhanced the two strands' hybridization, as did EoV 2C, which is a well-defined RNA chaperone (Fig 6B, lanes 5\u20136). Moreover, increasing either the amount of 2CATPase or its incubation time resulted in an apparent increase in strand annealing (Fig 6C and 6D).

Since the functionality of a hammerhead ribozyme strictly relies on its correct tertiary structure, hammerhead ribozymes often serve as the models for studying the structure and properties of RNAs. RNA chaperones are probably able to enhance the activity and turnover of ribozymes by promoting ribozyme formation, ribozyme-substrate association, and/or ribozyme dissociation from cleaved substrates. Therefore, a canonical hammerhead ribozyme enhancement assay [44] was used to further verify and characterize the RNA chaperone activity of EV71 2CATPase. In this assay, unlabeled ribozyme RNA was reacted with a 5\u2032 HEX-labeled RNA substrate, and the cleavage was expected to take place 16 nts from the 5\u2032 end (indicated by arrow), resulting in a HEX-labeled 16-nt cleavage product that could be detected by electrophoresis (Fig 7A). Our data showed that the presence of 2CATPase effectively enhanced ribozyme activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 7B), indicating that the RNA chaperone activity of EV71 2CATPase can assist in the proper formation and function of relatively complex RNA structures.",

It has been proposed that during vRNA replication of (+)RNA viruses, replicative intermediate double-stranded RNA must be unwound [45]. To assess the potential role of 2CATPase in enteroviral RNA replication, we first incubated purified His6-tagged 3Dpol, the EV71 RdRP, with the (-)RNA template [i.e., we transcribed in vitro the 3\u2032-end 1\u2013357 nts of EV71 (-)RNA], and with an excessive amount (at a ratio of 5:1) of primer RNA, which was a long oligonucleotide and was pre-annealed to the template in the presence or absence of 2CATPase (Fig 9A). Of note, the RdRP reactions were conducted at 22\u00b0C as previously described [46], and at this temperature, EV71 2CATPase was still able to hydrolyze ATP and unwind the RNA helix, although both activities were moderately lower at 22\u00b0C than at 37\u00b0C (S4A and S4C Fig). Our data showed that the presence of 2CATPase significantly promoted the synthesis of (+)RNA strands from the (-)RNA template by 3Dpol, and the promoting effect of 2CATPase was dose dependent (Fig 9B and 9C; Fig 9D, lower panel; and Fig 9E). Interestingly, when the amount of primer RNA was less than that of the (-)RNA template (at a ratio of 1:5), the presence of increasing amounts of 2CATPase was unable to promote (+)RNA synthesis (Fig 9D, upper panel; and Fig 9E), indicating that the major role of the 2CATPase helicase activity is not to directly enhance the RdRP activity of 3Dpol or smoothen the template. Of note, when the primer was absent, 3Dpol was unable to mediate RdRP or elongation reaction in the presence or absence of 2CATPase (Fig 9F, lanes 2 and 3). In addition, the GK134AA mutant of 2CATPase failed to promote (+)RNA synthesis as expected (Fig 9F, lanes 6\u20138; and Fig 9G). Altogether, our results show that 2CATPase can facilitate the 3Dpol-mediated production of enteroviral RNA strands in vitro via promoting the efficiency to re-utilize the RNA template.",

Then, Wt and mutant EV71 RNA transcripts were transfected into human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells. RNA replication was measured via quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) 24 and 48 hours post-transfection, and virus production was detected via immunofluorescent staining of EV71 VP1 in cells. Strikingly, compared to Wt virus, the GK134AA mutation resulted in the loss of EV71 RNA replication (Fig 10A) and viability (Fig 10B), suggesting that the GK motif and the RNA helicase activity of 2CATPase are critical for enteroviral RNA replication and viability.",

            "text": "As the most conserved nonstructural protein among all enteroviruses and even picornaviruses, 2CATPase has been reported to participate in diverse processes critical for the enteroviral life cycle. Although this protein has long been predicted as a putative SF3 helicase on the basis of its AAA+ ATPase activity and conserved SF3 motifs, its potential role in viral RNA remodeling and replication remains elusive. Previous studies have shown that the ATPase activity of poliovirus 2CATPase could be inhibited by GnHCl. This compound is a potent inhibitor of enteroviral RNA replication in vivo, which has been reported to inhibit poliovirus (-)-vRNA synthesis and the uridylylation of the protein primer VPg [38,39], suggesting that the ATPase activity of 2CATPase is critical for enteroviral RNA replication. Here we report that protein 2CATPase of EV71 possesses a nonconventional RNA remodeling activity that can function as both an ATP-dependent RNA helicase and an ATP-independent RNA chaperone and facilitates EV71 RdRP-mediated vRNA synthesis from vRNA template in vitro. The mutation of GK134 to AA, which disrupts 2CATPase helicase activity, mostly abolished EV71 RNA replication and virus production. These data indicate that 2CATPase-mediated RNA remodeling is pivotal for the enteroviral life cycle. Moreover, our results show that the RNA remodeling activities of 2CATPase are also conserved in CAV16.",

It is noteworthy that the recombinant poliovirus 2CATPase protein used in the previous assay was produced in E. coil, while the EV71 and CAV16 2CATPase proteins used here were expressed using an eukaryotic system (baculovirus). Interestingly, we found that although both the prokaryotically and eukaryotically expressed 2CATPase proteins possessed similar ATPase activity (S7 Fig), only the eukaryotically expressed 2CATPase protein possessed the RNA duplex unwinding activity (Fig 1F). Moreover, the eukaryotically expressed 2CATPase showed an apparently higher molecular mass than the prokaryotically expressed one (Fig 1E), implying that the former protein contains some post-translational modifications that potentially play a critical role(s) in the helicase activity of 2CATPase. Future research would uncover the potential post-translational modifications of 2CATPase.",

            "text": "Although they have mainly been characterized in vitro, the RNA remodeling activities of virus-encoded proteins are generally believed to play critical roles in the viral life cycle [48]. The RNA genomes contain multiple cis-acting elements, including the 5\u2032 cloverleaf, 3\u2032 UTR-poly(A), internal origin of replication (oriI or cre) [49,50], internal ribosomal entry site [51,52], and the cloverleaf at the 3\u2032-end of (-)-vRNA [53\u201355]. These highly structured RNA elements play indispensable roles in the replication, translation, and encapsidation of enteroviral RNAs [23,24,54,56] and probably require the RNA chaperoning activity of 2CATPase to facilitate their proper folding and refolding. On the other hand, during the RNA replication of RNA viruses, replicative intermediate dsRNA must be unwound, thereby allowing the efficient recycling of vRNA template for progeny vRNA synthesis. It is very likely that the RNA helicase activity of 2CATPase plays such a dsRNA unwinding role during enteroviral RNA replication, which is consistent with our observations that 2CATPase can facilitate RdRP-mediated enteroviral RNA synthesis in vitro by promoting the recycling of vRNA template (Fig 9), and disrupting 2CATPase RNA helicase activity in EV71 resulted in an almost complete loss of enteroviral RNA replication and virus production in cells (Fig 10). Interestingly, although RNA chaperones can also unwind/destabilize RNA duplexes, RNA chaperones are normally not considered to be involved in unwinding viral replicative dsRNA, as they usually destabilize short base pairs or hairpins within structured RNA elements. Indeed, Banerjee et al. reported that poliovirus 2CATPase can bind the 3\u2032-end cloverleaf structure of (-)-vRNA [15], implying a role of 2CATPase in this structured element. In addition, our finding that disrupting 2CATPase helicase activity but not chaperone activity mostly abolished enteroviral RNA replication and viability strongly suggests that the functions associated with RNA helicase and chaperone play different roles in the same RNA molecule (vRNA) and cannot replace each other.",

In addition, poliovirus 3Dpol has been reported to display unwindase activity that does not require ATP hydrolysis but does require an RNA chain elongation reaction [59]. It is plausible that 2CATPase and 3Dpol work synergistically to unwind nascently synthesized vRNA strands from template. On the other hand, the chaperone activities of 2CATPase and 3AB may function collaboratively or separately on different structured cis-acting elements of enteroviral RNA. However, owing to technical limitations, it is almost infeasible to determine the exact role of RNA helicase or chaperoning activity in the structures and functionalities of RNA molecules in cells or in vivo. Future studies may overcome these technical barriers and provide a mechanistic view of how RNA remodeling proteins function in cells.",

            "text": "RNA helicases and ATP-independent RNA chaperones are recognized as the two distinct classes of RNA remodelers. RNA helicases participate in most ATP-dependent rearrangement of structured RNAs and RNA-protein complexes [60,61]. On the other hand, RNA chaperones are able to unwind RNA duplexes and facilitate RNA strand annealing, thereby aiding the folding or refolding of RNA molecules into correct structures. The major difference between RNA helicase and chaperone is that the former needs the participation of ATP, but the later does not. Different from previously characterized RNA remodeling proteins, enteroviral 2CATPase can function as both a typical RNA helicase and an ATP-independent RNA chaperone. That a single protein can contain these two different types of RNA remodeling activities is intriguing. Our structural analyses of protein 2CATPase may provide some hints. Protein 2CATPase contains a 137-a.a. middle domain that includes the conserved SF3 signature A, B, and C motifs and is structurally similar to the helicase core domains of other SF3 viral helicases, indicating that the middle domain provides the basis of its RNA helicase activity. On the other hand, although RNA chaperones have been studied for decades, the mechanism(s) governing their ATP-independent remodeling activity remains elusive. A popular model proposed to explain the mechanism is the \u201centropy or disorder transfer\u201d, in which certain intrinsic disordered or unstructured regions of RNA chaperones can transfer their disorder or entropy to RNA molecules, and such a transfer of disorder or entropy can destabilize misfolded RNAs and aids RNA refolding. Indeed, many RNA chaperones, such as HIV-1 Vif, Tat and nucleocapsid, flavivirus core protein, hantavirus N protein, and cypovirus VP5, have been predicted to contain multiple intrinsic disordered regions [40,48], providing support for this model. Structure modeling using ROBETTA indicated that the CTD of 2CATPase contains a highly unstructured or disordered coiled-coil region that links the helicase core domain and the CTD (Fig 1C). When the CTD was deleted from the protein, the truncation completely abolished the RNA chaperoning activity of 2CATPase (Fig 8C). The truncation of CTD reduced but did not abolish the RNA helicase activity (Fig 8D), suggesting that the presence of CTD is also important for the helicase activity, probably by affecting the protein's global conformation. Moreover, the CTD alone does not contain any RNA remodeling activity (Fig 8A), suggesting that the RNA chaperoning function of 2CATPase requires the RNA binding capacities of other 2CATPase domains. The coiled-coil regions and the middle core domains are highly conserved in enteroviruses and other picornaviruses, such as encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and foot-mouth-disease virus (FMDV) (S8 Fig). On the basis of all these findings, we propose that the RNA helicase function of enteroviral 2CATPase relies on the conserved helicase motifs and ATPase activity, while specific structural characteristics, like the architecture of RNA binding and intrinsic disorder regions, are the basis of its RNA chaperoning function. Moreover, these findings provide evidence of the correlation between intrinsic disorder and RNA chaperone activity, which supports the \u201centropy transfer\u201d model of RNA chaperones.",

It also provides the first evidence that the two distinct types of RNA remodeling activities, RNA helicase and ATP-independent RNA chaperoning activities, can be integrated within one protein, introducing an extended view of RNA remodeling proteins. Altogether, these findings increase our understanding of enteroviruses and the two types of RNA remodeling activities.",
