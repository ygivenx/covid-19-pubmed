            "text": "As viruses depend on cells to complete their replication cycles, this has driven the evolution of a series of antiviral factors that directly subvert viral replication within cells. Recent work has revealed the striking scale of antiviral mechanisms employed by cells - almost every step of viral replication is apparently targeted by host encoded antiviral factors. For HIV the best defined examples are APOBEC3G/3F and SAMHD1 that inhibit viral reverse transcription, TRIM5\u03b1 that targets viral capsid uncoating, and tetherin that prevents viral egress (reviewed in1,2). However, genomic and proteomic screens can aid identification of further antiviral factors, and so there is an expanding list being described3,4. Such studies identified the MxB/Mx2 protein that targets HIV-1 replication around nuclear entry5,6, and the SERINC3 and SERINC5 proteins that target HIV-1 entry7,8.",

Humans have three antiviral IFITMs - IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3 (reviewed in13). IFITM expression inhibits viral entry into cells9,10, a phenotype that is enhanced by incorporation of IFITM proteins into viral particles14\u201316. Inhibition of viral entry is thought to occur via IFITM-mediated changes in the physical characteristics of the host cell membrane thereby inhibiting virus-cell membrane fusion17, though other inhibitory mechanisms affecting entry have been proposed18. By employing this generic inhibitory mechanism, IFITMs can then inhibit the entry of a broad range of viruses including influenza A virus, hepatitis C virus, Ebola virus, SARS coronavirus, Dengue virus, Zika virus, and HIV-19,10,19\u201321. Of note, the block to HIV-1 entry by IFITM proteins seems to depend on virus co-receptor use, with CCR5-tropic strains typically more sensitive to IFITM1 while CXCR4-tropic strains are typically more sensitive to IFITM2 and IFITM316,22,23.",

In the same study, IFITM1 inhibited the replication of HIV-1 in T-cell culture despite the evidence that IFITM1 had no effect on viral replication steps from cell entry to host genome integration for the CXCR4-tropic viral strain used. Other studies have also noted IFITM1\u20133 expression consistently reduces viral particle production from cells12,14\u201316,23\u201327. When this occurs, IFITM expression is typically associated with reductions in HIV-1 Gag levels, implying a block in viral protein synthesis that is independent from inhibition of virus entry.",

We therefore sought to investigate the potential block in protein synthesis induced by IFITMs and now show that IFITM expression leads to an inhibition of lentiviral production, which for HIV-1 occurs due to specific exclusion of viral mRNA from polysomes. Yet we also find that expression of the lentiviral accessory protein Nef can help relieve the inhibition in virus production, allowing HIV-1 to better replicate in the presence of IFITM proteins. Thus IFITM proteins are able to inhibit HIV-1 replication through three distinct processes - inhibition of viral entry, reduction of viral particle infectivity, and inhibition of viral protein synthesis.",

We used a co-transfection scheme in which we co-transfected HEK293T cells with plasmids containing HIV-1 proviral DNAs together with expression vectors encoding human IFITM1\u20133, allowing the effects on virus production to be studied independently of effects of IFITM proteins on viral entry. The quantity of virus produced was then analyzed by supernatant p24 ELISA and reverse transcriptase activity assays. Increasing levels of IFITM expression decreased HIV-1 NL4-3 output in a concentration-dependent manner consistent with loss of intracellular p55 and p24 levels (Fig. 1A,B), with a similar decrease seen in supernatant when both p24 concentration (Fig. 1C) and reverse transcriptase activity (Fig. 1D) were measured. Notably, the expression of IFITM1 and IFITM2 reduced the HIV-1 output while the effect was weaker for IFITM3. We then studied the effect of IFITMs on other viral proteins, and found IFITM1 and IFITM2 expression led to a reduction in the levels of all HIV-1 NL4-3 proteins assayed in transfected cells (Fig. 1E). Similar to HIV-1 NL4-3, viral production from the HIV-1 plasmid proviral DNAs 89.6 and Indie-C1 was also reduced by IFITM expression (Fig. 1C,D).",

We also wanted to test if IFITMs inhibit viral production in infected cells rather than provirus transfected cells. As such we infected SupT1 cells expressing doxycycline inducible IFITM1\u20133 with wild type NL4-3 virus10. To avoid the well documented inhibition of virus entry by IFITMs playing a role in our experiments, after spinoculation, unbound virus was washed off and cells were resuspended in new medium containing doxycycline and the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 to induce IFITM expression only after virus entry and to limit viral replication to a single round respectively. Complete entry blockade by AMD3100 was confirmed with pre-treatment of cells (Figure S3A). The quantity of wild type HIV-1 produced by IFITM-expressing T-cells was inhibited across a range of viral inputs (Fig. 2A) and was paired with losses in all viral protein levels (Fig. 2B,C). Though collectively this indicates that IFITMs inhibit viral production independent of their effects on viral entry. Notably, the levels of doxycycline induced IFITM were similar to those found in type I interferon treated CD4+ T-cells and monocyte derived macrophages (Figure S3B, C,E).",

We therefore analyzed viral output from HIV-1 NL4-3 plasmid proviral DNA transfected and IFN-\u03b2 treated TZM-bl cells that had been transduced with shRNAs targeting different IFITMs28. Infection of cells with virus produced during transfection was inhibited through the use of the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100, and thus the level of viral output in our analysis cannot be confounded by entry inhibition due to IFITM expression. The efficiency of knockdown in IFITM expression was confirmed by immunoblotting using monoclonal antibodies specific for individual IFITMs (Fig. 3A). As anticipated, IFN-\u03b2 treatment reduced viral production in HIV-1 transfected TZM-bl cells (Fig. 3B). Despite some weak knockdown cross-reactivity, such that shRNA targeting IFITM1 caused weak knockdown of IFITM2 (Fig. 3A), and that it was not possible to knockdown IFITM3 in isolation, knockdown of both IFITM1 and IFITM2 clearly rescued the level of virus produced in IFN-\u03b2 treated cells (Fig. 3C). Further, knockdown of all three IFITMs gave a higher rescue, indicating that the inhibitory effects of IFITM1 and IFITM2 on viral production are perhaps non-redundant in the context of HIV-1 replication. These effects were paired with rescue of all viral proteins levels during IFITM knockdown (Fig. 3D,E). Knockdown of IFITMs rescued viral protein production by around 1.5 to 3.5 fold, and so is concordant with viral production rescue of 2.0 to 2.5-fold. These data then show that endogenous levels of IFITMs can inhibit viral particle output and that our prior results in HEK293T transfections and SupT1 infections are not an overexpression artefact. They also suggest that IFITMs are a significant component of the antiviral response induced by type I interferon, as the 7-fold restriction of virus production seen on IFN-\u03b2 (Fig. 3B) can be reduced to 3.5-fold upon IFITM1\u20133 knockdown (Fig. 3E).",

            "text": "We next sought to confirm if the knockdown of physiologically relevant levels of IFITMs in HIV-1 infected primary cells could rescue viral protein production. Primary human CD4+ T cells were infected with HIV-1 following transduction with lentiviral particles for the expression of shRNAs targeting different IFITMs. Transduction with one shRNAs resulted in a specific ~90% downregulation of IFITM2 (though combined with IFITM1 and IFITM3 upregulation), while another shRNA led to a ~50% downregulation of all three IFITMs (Fig. 4A\u2013C). We were unable to specifically knockdown IFITM1 with reasonable efficiency. To mitigate the effects of IFITMs inhibiting viral entry on our studies of inhibited viral production, we took advantage of recent observations showing that different IFITM proteins vary in their inhibition of viral entry depending on HIV-1 co-receptor usage16,22,23. IFITM1 inhibits entry of CCR5-tropic viruses and IFITM2/3 predominantly inhibits CXCR4-tropic viruses. We therefore studied viral production effects driven by IFITM2 and IFITM3 with dual-tropic HIV-1 89.6, wherein cells were treated with the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 prior to and during infection. AMD3100 treatment would direct viral entry via CCR5 due to CXCR4 blockade and thus mitigate entry inhibition by either IFITM2 or IFITM3. We used intracellular p24 staining of infected cells in single cycle infections to measure uptake of virus after infection with trypsin treatment to remove cell surface bound virus (Figure S4)29\u201331. Although cellular uptake of viral p24 is not an exact measure of virus entry due to the uptake of virus into potentially non-productive endocytic pathways, p24 uptake is commonly found to be inhibited by IFITM expression14,15,25,26, while endocytic uptake of virus occurs at a lower rate in primary CD4+ T-cells32. We confirmed that viral uptake was minimally impeded with these during IFITM knockdown (Fig. 4D,E), consistent with prior observations22. Therefore reductions in virus production were considered to arise predominantly from IFITM-driven effects other than inhibition of viral entry. As such knockdown of IFITM2 led to a clear rescue of viral particle output (7-fold, Fig. 4F) that was coupled with rescue in viral protein expression (Fig. 4G,H), though this was in the context of somewhat elevated IFITM1 and IFITM3 levels (Fig. 4A). Similarly, knockdown of IFITM1\u20133 led to rescue of viral protein production and viral particle output (>10-fold) (Fig. 4F). Though IFITM1 which was depleted in this experiment can inhibit R5-tropic virus entry, thus a proportion of this latter result for IFITM1\u20133 may be attributable to weak IFITM1 driven entry inhibition, which was not the case for our data surrounding IFITM2-driven block to virus production. That inhibition of virus uptake was measurably weak (Fig. 4D,E) suggests that viral production inhibition may be the dominant form of IFITM driven inhibition in this experiment. Overall, this confirms that physiologically relevant levels of IFITM proteins can clearly inhibit HIV-1 production in primary cells independent of their effects upon entry and infectivity, that this is not an overexpression artefact, and occurs in a manner that is consistent with our observations in cell lines.",

We first analyzed the RNA content in cell lysates fractionated on a sucrose gradient by ultracentrifugation. The total RNA profiles (Fig. 5B) recovered from selected fractions of virus producing cells expressing IFITMs are comparable to vector-transfected control, suggesting that IFITM expression did not alter global translation in the cell. We used the level of ribosomal protein L7 as a guide for selection of fractions in our analysis (Fig. 5C) as it is a component of 60S ribosomes, which are enriched in 80S monosomes (such as fraction 10 Fig. 5C) as well as polysomes (such as fractions 14\u201318). The levels of GAPDH mRNA were not reduced in polysome fractions (Fig. 5D). Reductions in the levels of viral transcripts in polysome fractions (in contrast to whole cell lysates \u2013 Fig. 5A) would indicate specific translational inhibition. As such, we analyzed the level of viral transcripts in selected fractions covering the whole RNA profile with RT-qPCR. IFITM1 and IFITM2 significantly reduced the level of unspliced and singly-spliced viral transcripts in polysomes (Fig. 5E,F) and increased the level of these transcripts in the ribosome-free fraction (fraction 6), suggesting that expression of IFITM1 and IFITM2 inhibited translation of these viral transcripts. IFITM1 and IFITM2 also appeared to somewhat reduce the level of multiply-spliced transcripts (Fig. 5G), though the effect did not reach statistical significance, but was nonetheless coupled with a clear accumulation of ribosome-free multiply-spliced transcripts in low concentration sucrose fraction (Fig. 5G - fraction 6) relative to vector control, similar to other viral transcript classes. These data were consistent with our analysis of viral production (Fig. 1) wherein IFITM1 and IFITM2 expression lead to a more potent block in viral production than for IFITM3. Thus IFITM proteins inhibit translation of HIV-1 transcripts by leading to their specific exclusion from polysomes, resulting in reduced levels viral proteins and reduced viral output.",

To address this, we measured the level of unspliced viral RNA transcripts in the polysome fraction of HEK293T cells transfected with a codon-optimized vector for HIV-1 NL4-3 Gag only33 in conjunction with IFITM-expression vectors. Codon-optimization changes the codon bias of the construct towards human and therefore also alters the secondary structures of viral RNA. Changing codon bias thus renders HIV-1 unspliced and singly-spliced transcript expression independent of the HIV Rev responsive element (RRE), a cis acting RNA structure necessary for transcript nuclear export34. Codon optimization of gag rescued the level of unspliced HIV-1 transcripts in polysomes during IFITM expression, nor was there an accumulation of transcripts in low sucrose fractions as was seen with wild type NL4-3 (fraction 7 in Fig. 6A compared to fractions 6 in Fig. 5E\u2013G). As a result, the level of extracellular p24 production from cells expressing IFITM1 and IFITM2 was not only rescued but enhanced, and the production of the gag products p55 and p24 was also restored in comparison to wild type NL4-3 (Fig. 6B, C, F). Notably p24 protein production was only partially rescued, but p55 was entirely rescued (Fig. 6F). Contrasting data for full length pNL4-3 DNA show clear losses of viral production and protein expression in similar experiments (Fig. 6D\u2013F).",

As our findings of transfected HEK293T cells showed that unspliced and singly-spliced viral transcripts are more readily excluded from polysomes by IFITM proteins than multiply-spliced transcripts in those cells (Fig. 5), we reasoned that RRE, which is present in only unspliced and singly-spliced transcripts may be somehow recognized during IFITM protein expression leading to translational inhibition. To address this, we exploited constructs in which singly-spliced and unspliced transcripts had been rendered RRE and Rev independent via the introduction of the Mason Pfizer Monkey Virus (MPMV) constitutive transport element (CTE)35. A modification which allows all transcripts to be exported from the nucleus by the cellular TAP/NXT1 pathway, rather than RRE bearing Rev-dependent transcripts exporting via the CRM1 pathway36. We found that CTE dependent Rev independent virus was still inhibited by IFITM proteins (Figure S5), demonstrating at least that nuclear export pathway does not affect the virus production inhibition seen with IFITM proteins. Further introduction of the RRE into CTE bearing constructs did also not augment the restriction.",

We infected SupT1 cells with either wild type or nef-deleted NL4-3 virus by post-entry induction of IFITM expression via doxycycline (Fig. 7C). We found IFITM expression was typically very weak or absent in SupT1 cells unless induced. As nef-deleted virus has an inherent growth defect, we normalized the quantity of wild type and nef-deleted virus produced from IFITM-induced cells to vector control cells. We chose to induce IFITMs after X4-tropic HIV-1 NL4-3 entry and limit infections to a single round through the use of the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 after infection to mitigate the influence of IFITMs upon viral entry. In this regard, we found that nef-deleted virus was no more susceptible to IFITM-mediated restriction of entry than wild type virus (Figure S6A). Compared to wild type virus, production of nef-deleted virus in infected SupT1 cells was reduced significantly during expression of all IFITMs (Fig. 7C \u2013 compare wild type graph to nef-deleted graph), surprisingly IFITM3 showed the greatest degree of rescue in SupT1 cells, in contrast to data for transfected 293T cells (Fig. 7A,B).",

As IFITM1 does not typically affect the entry of CXCR4-tropic virus such as NL4-3 any difference in replication measured between wild type and nef-deleted virus could only arise from IFITM1-mediated effects on viral production, not cell entry16,22,23. Therefore this experiment was not pursued for IFITM2 and IFITM3, as their constitutive expression would inhibit NL4-3 virus entry and complicate interpretation. We found that in the presence of IFITM1, the growth of nef-deleted virus was significantly reduced relative to wild type virus (Fig. 7D). As wild type and nef-deleted virus data in C8166 cells were individually normalized to the same viruses in C8166 vector control cells, the differences observed are not likely due to Nef overcoming SERINC3/5 expression7,8, as these factors would be similarly present in both cell lines. Interestingly, the benefit of Nef expression in the context of IFITM1 was lost in the later stages of viral culture, when cell-to-cell infection typically predominates42. As nef-deleted virus was no more susceptible to IFITM-mediated restriction of entry than wild type virus (Figure S6A), these findings are only due to the influence of Nef to partially rescue virus production as seen in 293T cell transfections and SupT1 infections (Fig. 7A\u2013C).",

In HEK293T cells the effect principally occurs with IFITM1 and IFITM2, but less so for IFITM3, and was generally consistent throughout our analysis. Yet inducible expression of IFITM3 in SupT1 cells showed an equivalent antiviral effect to IFITM1 and IFITM2 though, and this was also linked to viral protein loss and was independent of IFITM-driven effects on viral entry. We consider that the same translational blocks measured in polysome analysis of HEK293T cells drive the result seen in SupT1 cells and primary CD4+ T-cells. Indeed, we considered it very likely cell type specific differences would occur, as IFITM localization and thus antiviral activity are governed by both ubiquitination and palmitoylation25,45. Reasonably the degree to which IFITM-driven viral entry inhibition or viral translation inhibition occurs in particular cells is then influenced by the activity of these pathways, which are known to commonly vary. Equally, other cell specific factors influencing viral transcription (such as NFkB translocation) might also account for variation in antiviral activity between cell lines, as higher virus transcriptional activity may overcome inhibition. However, it is important to note that we were able to clearly confirm the inhibition of viral production in primary human CD4+ T-cells by IFITM2 and IFITM1-3, demonstrating that inhibition of viral production by IFITMs occurs in HIV-1 target cells at physiologically relevant levels of endogenously expressed IFITM proteins.",

One possibility is a transcriptional inhibition or pre-translational degradation, but degradation of mRNAs that have been inhibited in translation is thought to be common49.

Our data showing gag codon optimization relieves the late-stage IFITM inhibition of HIV-1 supports similar findings27. Singly-spliced and unspliced transcripts that bear the RRE were typically most affected by IFITMs proteins in our analyses. Yet investigation of proviral constructs in which the RRE was substituted for the CTE element were inconclusive, making it difficult to reconcile a role for the RRE in determining inhibition, despite the appealing observation that RRE bearing transcripts are typically most affected. Notably, RRE bearing transcripts also have a non-human codon bias and surrounding splice sites that may prove to influence restriction52\u201355. As such further analysis to identify any HIV-1 RNA determinant of inhibition will then be of much value, though currently our further attempts to identify the viral RNA determinant have been unsuccessful. A recent study demonstrated that viral RNA CG dinucleotide frequency drives ZAP-mediated viral restriction rather than a specific RNA structural determinant, thus the determinant for IFITM-mediated restriction of protein synthesis may be similarly obscure56. However, we were able to exclude the broader possibility of general translational arrest via IFITM expression. Other aspects of the mechanism remain elusive also. IFITMs have no reported RNA binding domain and so would require either an RNA-binding partner to directly achieve inhibition, or would need to be involved in a pathway that could influence translation in this manner.",
