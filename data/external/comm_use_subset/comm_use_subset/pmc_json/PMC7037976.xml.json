            "text": "Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) is one of the most common reasons for hospitalization in the pediatric population [1]. Occasionally, the pneumonia may be severe enough to be complicated by an empyema. Common causative organisms include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes. Viral causes, while not uncommon, tend to occur less frequently. In some cases, both a viral and bacterial source contribute to the development of CAP. In these instances, it is difficult to completely rule in or rule out every organism due to limitations in isolation of the causative organism and sensitivity and specificity of laboratory testing. In this report, we describe an interesting case of CAP complicated by empyema in an otherwise healthy pediatric patient and the hospital course that followed. While we were unable to confidently identify the causative microorganism, her case heighted our suspicion of viral causes of CAP, still emphasizing the importance of following culture results while treating complex cases of infection.",

Blood cultures were drawn before the start of empiric antibiotics and showed no growth after 72 hours. Nasopharyngeal swab to screen for MRSA was negative. The patient was given an intravenous fluid bolus, albuterol/ipratropium breathing treatment, a dose of dexamethasone, and ceftriaxone. Her initial CXR showed left lower lobe pneumonia and parapneumonic effusion with a complex left pleural effusion (Figure 1). An ultrasound was ordered due to evidence of pleural effusion on chest x-ray. It showed a small-to-moderate somewhat complex left pleural effusion demonstrating several irregular septations. On hospital day three, subsequent contrast-enhanced CT of the chest confirmed a large left pleural effusion and lobar consolidation with major atelectasis and mediastinal shift (Figures 2 and 3). Given the severity of the midline shift and her decreasing clinical presentation and respiratory status, vancomycin was added to the antibiotic regimen and pediatric surgery was consulted for left video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical (VATS) decortication and chest tube placement.",

VATS confirmed empyema with the presence of grossly purulent pleural fluid. In an unforeseen turn of events, VATS decortication was stopped prematurely due to an end-tidal CO2 (EtCO2) of 135 mmHg and airway compromise. The endotracheal tube was removed, which revealed a blood clot obstructing the distal end. The patient was reintubated with improvement in air entry and a decrease in EtCO2.

            "text": "A 2015 prospective, multicenter, population-based, active surveillance study by Jain et al. [5] investigated the incidence and causes of CAP requiring hospitalization amongst children in the United States. Bacterial pathogens were considered to be present if detected in blood, endotracheal aspirate, nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab, bronchoalveolar lavage, or pleural fluid via culture or PCR. Similarly, viral pathogens were present if detected in a nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab via PCR. Of the 2,358 children who had evidence of pneumonia, the most commonly detected pathogens were viruses. Specifically, rhinovirus was the second most common detected pathogen (in 27% of children), second only to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Furthermore, the incidence of RSV, rhinovirus, adenovirus, influenza, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, and S. pneumoniae were higher amongst children younger than 5 years of age and highest amongst children younger than the age of 2, like our patient. However, for due diligence, we recognize that rhinovirus was also detected in 17% of controls in comparison to 22% of children with pneumonia. Due to the ability of rhinovirus to shed up to more than 2 weeks after infection, it can be difficult to interpret its detection in pediatric pneumonia, specifically in asymptomatic children [5]. Furthermore, Esposito et al. collected data from children with radiographically confirmed CAP in whom 17 respiratory viruses were detected in respiratory secretion samples using the Luminex xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel (RVP) Fast assay [6]. The results of this large study found RSV and rhinovirus to be the most common pathogens associated with CAP in single viral infections and coinfections. They were isolated in more than 50% of cases, emphasizing a possible role in pediatric CAP.",

The characteristics of children with rhinovirus-associated pneumonia were younger age (less than two years old), history of preterm birth, and higher median white blood cell count at presentation. Rhinovirus-associated pneumonia presented as a more severe disease with higher inflammatory markers and clinical presentation that required intensive care. Increased levels of white cell counts have been earlier reported in rhinovirus-related lower respiratory tract infections [8]. However, inflammatory markers are not highly specific in differentiation between viral versus bacterial cause of infection, and studies may benefit from the use of better biomarkers or microbiologic methods to confirm or exclude bacterial coinfection in rhinovirus-associated CAP.",

            "text": "Due to the clinical ambiguity surrounding the diagnosis of bacterial versus viral pneumonia, we wish to address the rationale for considering rhinovirus as the causative microorganism in this case. From the beginning, our approach followed the national guidelines for the management of CAP by obtaining blood cultures after our patient met criteria for hospitalization [2]. The first set of cultures was drawn 34 minutes after arrival to the ED and 90 minutes prior to the start of ceftriaxone. While it is true that an initial negative blood culture does not rule out a bacterial cause [9], traditionally, negative blood cultures assist in narrowing down the differential to a possible viral cause of pneumonia. Though this method is not without error, it is acceptable because strict diagnosis for viral pneumonia continue to be vague [10]. Two negative blood cultures in addition to a negative wound culture, two negative cultures of pleural fluid, and two negative nasopharyngeal swab cultures expanded the realm of viral causes for our patient. In addition, as per the patient's parents, the patient did not receive antibiotics at any time prior to ED admission, so we do not have concerns that her cultures would be altered for that reason. Additionally, we understood that residual positivity rate after starting empiric antibiotics in septic patients remained high enough that cultures are worthwhile [11], so we continued to order them. Fritz et al. commented on factors that contribute to a low prevalence of bacteremia in pneumonia among pediatric patients. The factors include an \u201cincreased burden of viral etiologies of pneumonia\u201d with reference to Jain et al. [12] as previously mentioned. In their 2015 study, 44% of detectable pathogens were viral and only 8% were bacterial.",

Febrile seizures are a clinical diagnosis with still unknown exact etiology; however, even so, Choi et al. [13] noted that high levels of proinflammatory cytokines released during viral infection may be linked to the onset of febrile seizures in pediatric patients, likely because of the still developing brain. Additionally, it is worth noting that oseltamivir has been shown to be weakly cytotoxic [14]; regardless of when our patient took oseltamivir, it was unlikely to have had any contribution to the onset of seizure-like activity.",

Different approaches are generally categorized as conservative, involving the use of antibiotics alone versus procedural interventions to drain the pleural space, as performed in our case. Antibiotics are a critical component in medical management for parapneumonic effusion and empyema [4]. Regimens are guided by local policies surrounding susceptibility patterns focusing on the current, increased resistance of S. pneumoniae and MRSA to penicillin. As seen in our case, it is crucial to always attempt to obtain blood cultures prior to initiation of antibiotics. In absence of confirmed organism by culture, studies suggest empiric coverage with ceftriaxone or cefotaxime [1]. Some experts suggest the addition of clindamycin for broader coverage of anaerobic or MRSA coverage, with the substitution of vancomycin for clindamycin for suspected MRSA pneumonia. Antibiotics would be switched to oral once drainage is complete and patient improves without oxygen, generally three to four weeks in duration given the absence of additional complications.",

Initially, diagnosis and the decision to drain a pediatric patient with pleural effusion were based on the staging of pleural infection via thoracentesis [15]. However, now thoracentesis is not routinely used in all patients. VATS is performed under general anesthesia with the patient in a supine position and affected side of the chest elevated at 45 degrees to provide adequate exposure and prevent secretion overflow. A single endotracheal tube is used. The first trocar is placed using an open technique in the 5th or 6th intercostal space, midaxillary line. Continuous flow of carbon dioxide is used for lung deflation. There is a risk of displacement of the mediastinum, which can lead to impaired oxygenation, decreased venous return to the heart and carbon dioxide retention. This is especially concerning in small children, such as the patient in this case, due to the mediastinum being displaced more easily [16]. The benefits of VATS, however, outweighed the risk in this case since the patient already experienced mediastinal shift from the progressing infection. VATS, therefore, became critical for resolution of the ravaging infection. Several recent studies suggest that VATS and fibrinolytics decrease the need for reintervention and length of hospitalization, as well as improve health outcomes in comparison with tube thoracostomy alone [17, 18].",

When VATS was compared with fibrinolytic agents as initial therapy for empyema in pediatric studies, there was no significant difference in length of hospital stay, failure rate, days of oxygen requirements, analgesic requirement, and radiologic outcomes [18, 19]. Our patient's presentation provided a clear need for procedural intervention that ultimately cleared enough of her rampant infection, whether bacterial or viral, to allow for complete, eventual resolution of the infection. While she has experienced sequalae that will continue to be monitored, the benefits of these procedures certainly outweighed the cost in her case.",
