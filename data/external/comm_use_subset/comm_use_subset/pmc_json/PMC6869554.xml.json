Due to the small sample size, we may also have been underpowered to detect small variations in the temporal distribution of the investigated agents. Second, attribution of causality remains challenging due to the lack of controls in our study. The association of pathogen detection with illness could not be well assessed, although most of the viral and bacterial pathogens identified in this study have been described in previous case control studies as causative agents of ARI.10, 39 In addition, we did not collect blood samples to assess whether the detection of common bacterial colonizers of the nasopharynx, such as S pneumoniae, were associated with invasive disease. Third, we did not record the number of patients with febrile ARI that refused enrollment, hindering our ability to estimate underenrollment. Last, given that only patients with febrile ARI were enrolled, this could have resulted in an underestimation of the RSV burden since a large proportion of RSV\u2010related illness is not associated with fever.40\n",

Although national guidelines for ARI treatment recommend systematic empiric antibiotic therapy, our results suggest that antibiotic use might be unnecessary in most cases, given the predominance of viral infections as potential cause of febrile ARI. Furthermore, other predisposing diseases such as malaria, malnutrition, and diarrhea may be contributory factors to febrile ARI exacerbation among hospitalized children.",
