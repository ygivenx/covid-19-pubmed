            "text": "Influenza virus is an important respiratory pathogen accounting for 3-5 million infections and responsible for 250,000-500,000 deaths annually worldwide [1]. Recently, newly emerging influenza virus subtypes have infected humans and caused significant public health concerns. For example, since several human cases of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus infection have been first reported in Hong Kong in the late 1990s, hundreds of additional confirmed cases of human infection by H5N1 virus have been reported with a lethal outcome in over 50% of the documented cases [2,3,4]. Also, in 2009, a new swine/human/avian-origin H1N1 influenza virus emerged in Mexico and resulted in a worldwide pandemic [5]. Moreover, recent outbreak of H7N9 avian influenza virus in China has claimed multiple human lives, while the numbers of reported human cases are growing continually [4]. Hence, these examples underscore the necessity for better preparedness against potential influenza virus pandemic caused by different influenza virus strains.",

However, live-attenuated and inactivated influenza vaccines that are currently licensed for human use are designed to induce strain-specific humoral immunity and cannot offer cross-protection against different strains of influenza virus expressing sequentially and/or conformationally related, but unique, viral surface proteins generated by random antigenic changes that influenza virus frequently undergo. Thus, development of vaccines that offer broad-range protection against multiple strains of influenza virus can be immensely beneficial for public health. For development of such influenza vaccines, it is important to consider that the immune response elicited by the vaccination targets viral antigens that are highly conserved among multiple influenza virus strains.",

It has been previously shown that immunization with recombinant adenovirus (rAd) vaccines encoding conserved influenza antigens such as NP and M2e generated cross-reactive immune responses, which can provide protection from lethal virus challenge in mice [9,10,11]. Accordingly, in our present study, we generated a recombinant adenovirus expressing full-length NP (rAd/NP) derived from influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8) and evaluated its potential as a mucosal vaccine candidate that could offer broad-range cross-protection against multiple strains of influenza virus. We focused on the advantages of adopting mucosal vaccination strategy, which has been shown to effectively target both systemic and mucosal immunity, over parenteral vaccination strategy [12,13,14]. Additionally, we compared the vaccination-induced immune responses generated following administration of our candidate vaccine virus via two different, intranasal and sublingual, mucosal routes.",

The cDNA corresponding to NP gene was generated by RT-PCR using forward primer (5\u2019-GGGTACCGCCACCATGGCGTCCCAAGGCACC-3\u2019) which contains a KpnI restriction enzyme site and the Kozak sequence to enhance translation and the reverse primer (5\u2019-TTCTAGATTAATTGTCGTACTCCTC-3\u2019) that contains a stop codon and an XbaI restriction enzyme site at 3\u2019 terminus. The whole open reading frame was then digested with Kpn I/Xba I double digestion and inserted into the pShuttle-CMV vector. For generation of replication-defective adenovirus (serotype 5), the NP sequence was first inserted into adenovirus genome through homologous recombination as described previously [15]. Subsequently, recombinant adenoviral DNA containing the NP gene was transfected into HEK293 cells to generated rAd/NP virus. Mock adenovirus (rAd/Mock) was generated by the same method using the vacant pShuttle-CMV vector. The recombinant adenoviruses were amplified on HEK293 cells and purified by double CsCl2 density-gradient ultracentrifugation. The expression of NP protein by rAd/NP was confirmed by infecting HEK293 cells at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 and immunoblotting using mouse polyclonal PR8-specific anti-serum and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR) as a secondary antibody. To extract cellular proteins from the infected-HEK293 cells, cell lysates were prepared by resuspending cell pellets with a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM sodium chloride, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate and 0.1% SDS, and clear supernatants and pellets were separated by centrifugation.",

Also, mice were immunized intranasally with 1\u00d7108 PFU of rAd/Mock to be used as negative control. In our preliminary studies, a single s.l. immunization with rAd/NP was insufficient to produce detectable immunogen-specific antibody levels in BALB/c mice (data not shown). Therefore, in order to enhance the efficacy of immunogen-specific antibody responses for the s.l. vaccination, sublingually primed mice were boosted two weeks after their first immunization using the same vaccination scheme used during their priming. However, all mice immunized intranasally received a single immunization with the indicated dose of rAd/NP or rAd/Mock. Subsequently, three weeks after their respective final immunization, sera were harvested from all immunized mice, and the levels of PR8-specific IgG in the immune sera were determined via ELISA using detergent-disrupted PR8 virus as the coating antigen. All i.n. and s.l. vaccination groups that received rAd/NP elicited significant levels of PR8-specific serum IgG compared to control mice given rAd/Mock (Figure 2A). Interestingly, while mice immunized via s.l. route generated comparable levels of PR8-specific serum IgG titers regardless of the administered vaccine dose, mice immunized via i.n. route showed significant dose-dependent differences in serum IgG titers between the two vaccination doses used. Further, when PR8-specific serum IgG levels were determined in the sera harvested from PR8-infected mice at day 5 post-challenge, we observed significant increase in the PR8-specific IgG titers in mice vaccinated intranasally with either dose of rAd/NP. However, such increase in PR8-specific serum IgG titers following PR8-challenge was not observed in sublingually vaccinated mice. In summary, these data indicate that both i.n. and s.l. immunizations with rAd/NP elicit considerable levels of PR8 NP-specific serum IgGs and that PR8-challenge following rAd/NP immunization significantly increases PR8-specific serum IgG levels, compared to that of pre-challenge levels, in intranasally immunized mice, but not in sublingually immunized mice.",

Briefly, mice were immunized i.n. once with either 1\u00d7107 or 1\u00d7108 PFU of rAd/NP or immunized s.l. with rAd/NP using the same prime-and-boost vaccination regimen as aforementioned. Again, a group of mice immunized i.n. with rAd/Mock was used as our negative control. All immunized mice were then challenged with a lethal dose of PR8. At day 5 post-challenge, mice lungs were harvested and Kd/NP147-155 tetramer-specific CD8 T-cell frequency was determined via flow cytometry. As expected, we observed significant increase in the percentage (of total lung CD8 T cells) of Kd/NP147-155 tetramer-specific CD8 T cells in the lungs of mice that received rAd/NP via i.n. route compare to the lungs of control mice that received rAd/Mock (Figure 3). Moreover, this increase in NP-specific CD8 T-cell recruitment was dose-dependent, as higher percentage (of total lung CD8 T cells) of NP-specific CD8 T cells were detected in mice that received 1\u00d7108 PFU dose compared to those that received 1\u00d7107 PFU (Figure 3). However, we did not observed any significant differences in the levels of Kd/NP147-155 tetramer-specific CD8 T cells in any of the s.l. immunized groups compared to rAd/Mock immunized control group, notwithstanding the dose of rAd/NP vaccine administered (Figure 3).

However, all mice that received either dose of rAd/NP via s.l. route as well as control mice that received rAd/Mock or un-immunized na\u00efve mice succumbed to PR8 infection by day 9 post-challenge (Figure 4A and B). Interestingly, however, lung virus titers at day 5 post-challenge were detected at similar levels in all immunization groups (Figure 4C). It is probable that rAd/NP may induce long-lasting innate immunity that contributes complementarily with other specific immune arms to the control of the disease by uncharacterized mechanisms [19]. As a result, the protection may not necessarily correlate with virus titers detected in the lungs upon lethal challenge.

Accordingly, we engineered a recombinant adenovirus expressing full-length NP derived from PR8 influenza virus as a potential vaccine candidate in order to investigate whether priming for NP-specific immune responses could offer cross-protection against different strains and subtypes of influenza virus. However, the use of adenovirus-based vaccine raises an important concern regarding development of vector-specific immunity in vaccine recipients as pre-existing vector immunity could interfere with the vaccine efficacy in scenarios requiring multiple booster vaccinations [25]. To address this challenge, we chose to administer of our recombinant adenovirus vaccine via mucosal route as previous studies have shown that a single immunization via nasal route can bypass the development of vector-specific immunity to adenovirus vector in human while eliciting potent immune responses specific for the vaccine antigen [26,27,28]. Moreover, the airway mucosa is the main entry point for various invading pathogens, functioning as the first line of defense against respiratory infections [29]. The mucosal immune system is distinct from the systemic immune system as it possesses distinctly organized immunological tissues of its own which function to maintain the homeostasis within the mucosa [30]. Current method of delivering influenza vaccines via parenteral route relies on the systemic induction of virus-specific IgGs for protection. However, previous studies have reported that influenza vaccination efficacy is also closely associated with the immune responses induced within the respiratory mucosa [31,32,33]. Given that parenteral influenza vaccines presently in use are inefficient in stimulating immune responses in mucosal tissues [34], our study examined the potential application of mucosal immunization strategy which has been shown to effectively target both systemic and mucosal immunity [12,13,14]. However, there is a safety issue concerning the redirection of antigens to the central nervous system in i.n. immunization [35], while s.l. route is thought to be relatively safe [36]. Therefore, in our present study, we assessed i.n. and s.l. immunizations as an approach to evaluate the protective efficacy generated by mucosal vaccination of our rAd-based influenza vaccine, as these two routes of immunization have been shown to promote induction of protective immune responses characterized by the localized responses in the respiratory mucosa [37,38] as wells as systemic induction of vaccine antigen-specific responses [39]. Additional aspects of our study focused on the comparison of humoral and cell-mediated immune responses generated following administration of our vaccine virus via these two different mucosal routes. Further, we wanted to determine the specific branches of immunity, primed by mucosal rAd/NP immunization, which correlate to the establishment cross-protection against different influenza virus strains.",

            "text": "In our present study, we demonstrated that rAd/NP immunization increases the frequency of NP-specific CD8 T cells recruited to the lungs of i.n. immunized mice following homologous challenge with PR8 virus. Accordingly, complete protection against PR8 challenge was observed only in the groups that received the vaccine virus via i.n. route, indicating that NP-specific CTL response may be directly correlated to protection against homologous influenza virus infection. Moreover, protection against heterosubtypic influenza virus infection may also be correlated to NP-specific CTL response as NP-specific blood CD8 T lymphocyte levels considerably increased (starting from day 4 post-challenge) in mice that survived the lethal challenge with heterosubtypic H3N2 virus. However, i.n. immunization failed to confer complete protection against H5N1 infection as only 40% of mice in the group that were given 1\u00d7108 PFU dose of rAd/NP survive this lethal challenge. Our explanation for such lack of protection against H5N1 virus is that, although the immunodominant CD8 T-cell epitope within in NP (NP147-155) are fully conserved among all influenza A subtypes, the magnitude and characteristic of CTL response elicited during differential influenza virus infection may be distinct for each influenza virus strain causing the concurrent infection. Hence, even subtle differences in the CTL responses may affect the degree of protection offered during influenza infection caused by different influenza virus strains [40,41]. Mucosal immunization of mice with rAd/NP also dramatically increases NP-specific IgG levels in the serum independent of the immunization route. However, we observed that subsequent challenge with the homologous influenza virus additionally increases the NP-specific serum IgG levels in i.n. immunized mice, but not in s.l. immunized mice. Further, substantial levels of NP-specific respiratory mucosal IgAs were detected in i.n. immunized mice, whereas no such IgAs were detected in s.l. immunized mice. Thus, it is possible that the presence of influenza NP-specific IgGs and IgAs in the respiratory mucosa may also be involved in the protection against the lethal influenza challenges [42,43], even though the exact mechanisms remain to be determined further. The immunization with adenovirus vector encoding NP induced both cellular and antibody responses. It has been shown recently that influenza virus-infected cells can be eliminated by anti-M2e IgG-mediated cellular cytotoxicity or phagocytosis since these cells express M2 on their surface after infection [44]. Similarly, the NP-specific antibodies may interact with the viral NP expressed on cell surface of infected cells and mediate cell lysis by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.",

Given that influenza NP contains a conserved immunodominant CD8 T-cell epitope shared among all influenza A virus and that mucosal immunization can stimulate both mucosal and systemic immune responses, we believe that i.n. immunization with rAd/NP can induce protective immunity against different strains of influenza virus by priming for cross-reactive NP-specific CTL response and possibly by local and systemic induction of NP-specific antibodies. As such, our vaccination approach, examined in the present study, could be further explored as a next-generation influenza vaccination strategy which could generate broadly protective immunity against multiple influenza virus strains and, thus, greatly reduce influenza virus-related public health burden.",
