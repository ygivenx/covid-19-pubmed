The WHO estimates that ARTIs account for 1.9 to 2.2 million childhood deaths annually, with 42% occurring in Africa [2]. The etiologic agents include viruses, bacteria, and fungi. Among the viruses responsible for ARTIs are members of the Orthomyxoviridae, Coronaviridae, Picornaviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Adenoviridae, and Parvoviridae. Bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae), and Chlamydia pneumoniae are the most common involved microbes [3]. However, in general, viral infections are shown to be responsible for about 80% of ARTIs and are the cause of 90% of hospitalizations in children below 5 years of age [4].",

URTIs refer to pathogenic manifestations of rhinosinusitis, tonsillitis, pharyngitis, laryngitis/laryngotracheitis and otitis, while LRTIs include tracheitis, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and bronchopneumonia [5]. LRTIs are more harmful than URTIs and thus account for most of the serious disease burden. They are the major cause of hospital admissions in young children in the developed world [6].",

Even so, no clinical algorithm exists that will distinguish clearly between different causes of childhood respiratory infections [7]. Accurate and rapid diagnostic tests that identify the cause of LRTIs in children can reduce the use of antibiotics, improve the targeted use of drugs and help to control nosocomial transmission [8]. New technologies permit the detection of more than one pathogen in a single probe and are more relevant than non-multiplex approaches such as conventional PCR, viral cell culture and, immunofluorescence or immunochromatography assays. The recently developed commercial diagnostic assays based on multiplex real-time PCR (qPCR/qRT-PCR) allow sensitive and specific detection of a broad panel of conventional and emerging viruses in respiratory tract specimens. Thus, they have been established as a standard method within the past few years. These technological advances have changed the landscape of virus detection and provide the opportunity to improve our understanding of the epidemiology of respiratory viruses [9].",

The Mastermix contains MgCl2, 10x LC-HYBR (a+b), forward primer Strep-F (5\u2019-TGCAGAGCGTCCTTTGGTCTAT-3\u2019), reverse primer Strep-R (5\u2019-CTCTTACTCGTGGTTTCCAACTTGA-3\u2019) (50 \u03bcM each), probe Strep-TM (5\u2019-ABI-FAM-TGGCGCCCATAAGCAACACTCGAA-3\u2019-ABI-Tamra) (20 \u03bcM), and H2O (Roche). Positive and negative controls were included. PCR was carried out on a Light Cycler 2.0 (Roche) with the following program: initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 7 min, a 50 cycles PCR including a denaturation step at 95\u00b0C for 5 sec and an annealing and extension step at 62\u00b0C for 45 sec. A final cooling step at 40\u00b0C was recommended. PCR results were analyzed using the Light Cycler Software 4.05.",

The characteristics of the study population are summarized in Table 1 and S1 Table. Most hospitalized patients were males (64.24%), living in an urban environment (70.69%), and with siblings (70.96%). A total of 72/372 of cases was premature at birth (19.35%) and less than 10.00% were diagnosed with asthma. Almost half of the population was hospitalized between January and March 2014 (49.46%).

Symptoms included mostly dyspnea (75.26%), polypnea (50.80%) and cough (34.94%). Oxygen support was required in 29.03% of hospitalized subjects, 15.59% of patients were diagnosed for respiratory irritation, and 7.79% required mechanical ventilation. A total of 32.25% of patients had a concentration of C-reactive protein (CRP) ranging from equal to higher than 20 milligrams per liter (mg/l). Due to suspicion of bacterial infections, patients were treated with antibiotics (58.87%) and corticosteroids (59.67%). Recovery was defined by response to treatment and when the need for oxygen therapy was considered to be no longer necessary (88.44%). After hospitalization, 8 patients (2.15%) went home without permission, and a total of 23 cases ended fatal (6.18%).",

Both of these pathogens were also identified by other studies as the major etiologic agents for ARTIs in infants and young children [27, 28]. RSV is well established as a common agent of ARTIs, especially in the manifestation of bronchiolitis. In addition, studies from Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia reported RSV infection rates between 18.00% and 29.80% [10\u201312, 18]. In contrast to RSV, few studies were published describing RV epidemiology in the Arab Maghreb. Similar to our findings, Jroundi and collaborators detected a high rate of RV infection (53.00%) in Moroccan children hospitalized with ARTIs [11]. In another hand, a recent study describing the circulation of respiratory viruses in Tunisia over 3 consecutive years found that RV infection was predominant in only 1 of the 3 years, while RSV was predominant in the other 2 years. Such findings indicate a possible fluctuation of RV and RSV circulation [20]. The interpretation of the presence and the pathogenic role of RV in LRTIs remain unclear. According to Vandini et al, RV is the second most common cause of viral bronchiolitis and the most common virus associated with wheezing in children aged 1 to 2 years [29]. However, the detection of RV in asymptomatic children, or its long persistence after an acute respiratory infection has been also described [30].",

It is also known as an important agent of upper and lower respiratory tract infections in children. In the present study, AdV was found in 25.00% of the tested samples. Besides its role in the induction of ARTIs, AdV was statistically associated with gastroenteritis manifestation (viral tropism, p = 0.004). These findings are in accordance with other studies describing AdV acute infections requiring hospitalization [31, 32]. Similar to AdV, CoVs group including CoV-229E, CoV-HKU1, CoV-NL63, and CoV-OC43, was detected in 21.50% of the samples, which is in contrast to other publications reporting that CoVs are rarely detected in ARTIs [33, 34].",

S. pneumoniae-carriage rates in children of 60.00% up to 93.00% in low- and lower-middle-income countries have been reported [43, 44]. In our study 47 cases from a total of 53 S. pneumoniae positive PCR and a concentration of CRP equal or higher than 20 mg/l; viral RNA/DNA was additionally detected, indicating a possible bacterial co-infection. On the other hand, increased colonization rates of S. pneumoniae in children during RSV epidemics have been reported [45]. In only 6/53 children with CRP concentration values equal or higher than 20mg/l and S. pneumoniae detection, no virus was found in our study, leading to the interpretation that these children were hospitalized due to S. pneumoniae-associated ARTIs. Pneumococcal vaccination is available in many countries. However, in Tunisia, there is no national vaccination program against pneumococcal in public hospitals. Vaccination is available only in the private hospitals and thus is not accessible to all population [46].",

The presentation of clinical symptoms does not often enable clinicians to discriminate between viral or bacterial pathogens.

In this context, viral diagnosis can prevent the use of unnecessary costly antibiotics. For this reason, rapid and reliable diagnostic tools are required for intervention with the appropriate infection treatment measures. This study aimed to profile a large number of viruses and the most common bacteria in the respiratory tract of infected children in Sousse area in Tunisia using the multiplex qRT-PCR for virus\u2019s genome detection and the qPCR assays for bacteria identification.
