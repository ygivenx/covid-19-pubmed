            "text": "Viral infection dramatically reshapes the gene expression landscape of the host cell. By changing overall messenger RNA (mRNA) abundance or translation, viruses can redirect host machinery towards viral gene expression while simultaneously dampening immune stimulatory signals (1\u20133). Suppression of host gene expression, termed host shutoff, can occur via a variety of mechanisms, but one common strategy is to accelerate degradation of mRNA (1\u20133). This occurs during infection with DNA viruses such as alphaherpesviruses, gammaherpesvirues, and vaccinia virus, as well as with RNA viruses such as influenza A virus and SARS and MERS coronaviruses (1,4,5). In the majority of these cases, a viral factor promotes endonucleolytic cleavage of target mRNAs. This strategy bypasses the normally rate limiting steps of deadenylation and decapping to effect rapid mRNA degradation by host exonucleases (1).",

This is exemplified by herpesviral nucleases, including the SOX endonuclease encoded by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), an oncogenic human gammaherpesvirus that causes Kaposi's sarcoma and B cell lymphoproliferative diseases (6,7). KSHV SOX is a member of the PD-(D/E)xK type II restriction endonuclease superfamily that possesses mechanistically distinct DNase and RNase activities (8\u201310). The RNase activity of the gammaherpesvirus SOX protein has been shown to play key roles in various aspects of the viral lifecycle, including immune evasion, cell type specific replication, and controlling the gene expression landscape of infected cells (11\u201314).

Additionally, SOX has been shown to cut within specific locations of mRNAs in cells, further emphasizing that there must be transcript features that confer selectivity (16,20). Indeed, a transcriptome-wide cleavage analysis indicated that SOX targeting is directed by a relatively degenerate motif, often containing an unpaired polyadenosine stretch shortly upstream of the cleavage site, which is located in a loop structure (20). Cleavage within an unpaired loop was confirmed in a recent crystal structure of SOX with RNA, although additional contacts that could confer sequence specificity were not observed (21).",

            "text": "Thus, a major outstanding question is how RNA sequence and/or structure contribute to SOX target recognition. In this context, it is unclear how sequence features surrounding the RNA cleavage site might impact SOX targeting, for example by changing its affinity for a given RNA or the efficiency with which cleavage occurs. To address these questions, we sought to reconstitute the SOX cleavage reaction in vitro using purified components. Using an RNA substrate that is efficiently cleaved by SOX in cells, we revealed that specific RNA sequences within and outside of the cleavage site significantly contribute to SOX binding efficiency and target processing. In particular, we found that the polyadenosine stretch adjacent to the cleavage site is critical for SOX binding, and we experimentally verified the importance of an open loop structure surrounding the cleavage site. Finally, we demonstrated that this in vitro system faithfully recapitulates the initial endonucleolytic cleavage event that is an essential component of mRNA target specificity in vivo. Collectively, our data reveal that specific sequence features potently impact SOX binding, and thus provide key insight into the breadth of SOX targeting efficiency observed across the transcriptome. More broadly, this information provides a framework for better understanding the target specificity of endonucleases, which play central roles in mammalian quality control processes and viral infection outcomes.",

            "text": "Our prior analysis of SOX targets in cells identified the human LIMD1 mRNA, which codes for a protein essential for P body formation and integrity, as being highly susceptible to cleavage by SOX (20). The minimum sequence required to directly cut the putative cleavage site in LIMD1 in cells was mapped to a 54-nucleotide segment (LIMD1-54), and we therefore chose this as our model substrate to study SOX targeting in vitro (20). We first expressed and purified KSHV SOX to greater then 95% purity from Sf9 insect cells (Supplementary Figure S1A). Using the LIMD1-54 substrate, we plotted the observed rate constant (kobs) as a function of SOX concentration, yielding a Hill coefficient of n = 1.11 (Figure 1A). Thus, in agreement with previous observations (9,10), SOX appears to function predominantly as a monomer. Under conditions of half maximal activity (2 \u03bcM; Figure 1A), SOX displayed a strong preference for the \u2018hard\u2019 divalent metal Mg2+ and a weaker preference for the \u2018softer\u2019 and larger metals Mn2+, Co2+ and Zn2+ (Figure 1B). This is again consistent with other characterized members of the P/DExK family of enzymes (9,26). Notably, SOX activity in the presence of Mg2+ was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner upon competitive addition of Ca2+ (Figure 1C and Supplementary Figure S1D). This is likely the result of increased coordination partners engaged by Ca2+, which decreases the ability of catalytic residues to promote proper base hydrolysis (27\u201329). Finally, increasing the NaCl concentration above 100 mM led to substantially decreased SOX activity (Figure 1D), in accordance with the observation that high salt concentrations frequently inhibit nuclease activity by disrupting protein-protein or protein-substrate interactions (29). Given that recombinant SOX displays robust 5\u2032-3\u2032 exonuclease activity (9,10), we sought to confirm that LIMD1-54 was subject to endonucleolytic SOX cleavage, as this is the predominant event that directs mRNA turnover in SOX expressing cells (3,16). Both the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends LIMD1-54 were blocked by capping the 5\u2032 end with a Cy5 fluorophore and the 3\u2032 end with an Iowa Black quencher (LIMD1-54 Flo). We confirmed this RNA was resistant to degradation by the 5\u2032-phosphate dependent exonuclease terminator (Figure 1E, lane 3). However, in the presence of SOX, a cleavage product was observed that correlated with an endonucleolytic cut (Figure 1E, lane 2).",

The cleavage sites for LIMD1-54 and GFP-51 are predicted to occur in an open loop region (Figure 2A, red arrow). Upon direct comparison of these two RNAs, we observed a \u223c6-fold increase in the catalytic efficiency of SOX for the LIMD1-54 substrate compared to GFP-51 (Figure 2B). This difference was not exclusively due to the fact that the GFP substrate was slightly shorter than LIMD1-54, as SOX also displayed a 5-fold reduction of catalytic efficiency on a longer, 100 nt GFP substrate (GFP-100; Figure 2B). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) further revealed a 10-fold increase in SOX binding to LIMD1-54 compared to GFP-51 (Figure 2C). Given that both substrates contain the requisite unpaired bulge at the predicted cleavage site (see Figure 2A and Supplementary Figure S2), these observations suggest that additional sequence or structural features impact SOX targeting efficiency on individual RNAs.",

Structural data indicate that residue F179 forms a stacking interaction with an adenine base in the RNA, likely stabilizing the protein-RNA interaction, while P176 is hypothesized to contribute to structural rearrangements required for F179 engagement (21). We purified both mutants to evaluate their relative RNA processing and RNA binding activity against the optimal LIMD1-54 substrate. Both mutants displayed purity and elution profiles similar to wild type (WT) SOX (see Supplementary Figure S1A-C). However, the catalytic efficiency of each mutant was >10-fold less than WT SOX (Figure 2D). Furthermore, RNA binding was severely perturbed; the binding kinetics of WT SOX for LIMD1-54 are in the single digit nanomolar range (Kd = 7 nM), while P176S and F179A display >2 log defects (Kd = 702 nM and 831 nM, respectively) (Figure 2E and Supplementary Figure S4A\u2013C). Thus, the large defect in RNA binding likely explains the decreased efficiency of RNA processing. Notably, while there was a dramatic decrease in the relative affinities of the two mutants for LIMD1-54, there was not a complete loss of binding or RNA processing. This could be a result of secondary nonspecific interactions and/or nonspecific exonucleolytic degradation by SOX from the 5\u2032 monophosphorylated end of the probe.",

This showed that the LIMD1-54 structure contains a largely base paired stem region, followed by a loop at positions 15\u201327 that encompasses the predicted SOX cleavage site between nt 26 and 27, and a short hairpin structure at positions 29\u201340 (Figure 3B).

In this structure, the only observed contacts between SOX and K2-31 occurred between the four active site residues of SOX (Y373, R248, C247, F179) and the UGAAG motif surrounding the cleavage site of the RNA (21). It was therefore hypothesized that no other residues beyond this unpaired UGAAG motif were involved in transcript recognition (21). However, the binding affinity we observed for LIMD1-54 was 200-fold stronger that what was previously reported for K2-31 (21), suggesting that a more extended interaction surface might distinguish optimal from sub-optimal RNA substrates. We therefore used RNA footprinting to map the SOX binding sites on LIMD1-54. Indeed, SOX protected a region of LIMD1-54 that included the three adenosine stretch (positions 20\u201324) from RNase T1 digestion in a dose dependent manner (Figure 4). Notably, this mapped binding region is the same region predicted from in vivo PARE-seq data to be important for SOX targeting, although the reason for its importance remained unknown (20). We also observed a modest protection of base 27 (G) located directly adjacent to the predicted cleavage site of SOX, which represents the region detected in the crystal structure of K2-31 bound to SOX. Collectively, these findings suggest that while SOX may interact with residues directly adjacent to the cut site, a more extensive interaction interface exists for its preferred in vivo targets.",

First, we preserved the loop structure but replaced the three adenosines bound by SOX (residues 39\u201343) with guanosines (LIMD1-54 3xA-G). Second, we largely abolished the loop structure by providing complementary base pairing (LIMD1-54 Zipper). Third, we mutated the residue located at the predicted SOX cut site that was also protected in the footprinting assay (LIMD1-54 A-G). This mutant has been previously identified to block SOX cleavage in vivo (20). The predicted structures of the LIMD1-54 3XA-G and LIMD1-54 zipper mutants were verified by in-line probing (Figure 5, Supplementary Figure S6). Real-time binding kinetics for SOX with WT LIMD1-54 and each of the three mutant substrates were then measured using bio-layer interferometry (BLI). All RNA probes were 3\u2032 biotinylated and immobilized to a streptavidin-coated BLI probe, whereupon the binding and dissociation of SOX was measured. To prevent degradation of the probe, excess calcium ion was used in place of magnesium (Supplementary Figure S1E). SOX retained similar binding affinity to the cut site mutant LIMD1 A-G (Kd = 25 nM) as to WT LIMD1-54 (Kd = 16.3 nM) (Figure 5B, Supplementary Figure S5A, B and Supplementary Table S2). In contrast, SOX exhibited dramatically reduced binding to both the predicted binding site mutant LIMD1-54 3xA-G (Kd = 710 nM) and to the LIMD1-54 zipper mutant lacking the loop region (Kd = 904 nM) (Figure 5B, Supplementary Figure S5C-D and Supplementary Table S2). To rule out the possibility that the effect on binding affinity to the LIMD1-54 zipper mutant was a result of altered residues within the binding site, we also engineered an additional zipper mutant (LIMD1-54 zipper 2) that did not disrupt the polyadenosine sequence. In agreement with the loop structure playing a critical role in target recognition, this LIMD1-54 zipper 2 mutant also displayed a substantial defect in binding (Kd = 2.09 \u03bcM; Supplementary Figure S7A, B, Supplementary Table S2). Finally, we measured SOX binding to the KSHV pre-miRNA sequence used to obtain the SOX-RNA co-crystal structure (K2-31) (21). Notably, the affinity of SOX for K2-31 was within the range of the LIMD1-54 structural mutants (Kd = 1.08 \u03bcM), suggesting that despite having an UGAAG motif upstream of a predicted bulge, this is unlikely to be a SOX target (Figure 5B, Supplementary Figure S5E and Supplementary Table S2).",

Indeed, we observed a predominant 27 nt band, which is the size of the product released upon LIMD1-54 cleavage at the predicted cut site (Figure 6A, lane 3). Additional bands also appeared, likely representing subsequent processing events. Importantly, when we incubate SOX with the cut site mutant LIMD1-54 A-G, there is a complete loss of this 27 nt product, as well as the additionally processed intermediates (Figure 6A, lane 4).

Here, through the development of the first biochemical system to faithfully recapitulate the internal cleavage specificity observed for SOX in cells, we revealed how both RNA sequence and structure contribute to targeting. These findings resolve a central feature of the current model of SOX activity (Figure 7). Previous observations established that sequences flanking the cut site were required to direct cleavage by SOX (16,20). However, it was unresolved whether they played a strictly structural role in presenting an exposed loop for cleavage, served as a platform for SOX binding, or created a binding site for one or more cellular factors that then indirectly recruited SOX to its targets. Through a combination of mutational analyses, RNA structure probing, and RNA footprinting assays, we showed that efficient SOX targeting requires both an exposed loop structure and upstream sequences that serve as a SOX binding platform. This combination of sequence and structural features within the targeting motif helps explain why some mRNAs are efficiently cleaved by SOX, whereas others are weaker substrates.",

            "text": "A key open question related to SOX function is how it can target the majority of mRNAs in cells, yet with significant site specificity. Our observations suggest that there must be specific mRNA features that influence targeting. Indeed, PARE-seq analyses of cleavage intermediates in SOX expressing cells revealed that cleavage sites were associated with a degenerate sequence motif (20). Sequences proximal to the cleavage site were predicted to be un-base paired and frequently contained a polyadenosine stretch followed by a purine (20). The requirement for these sequence features for SOX targeting was validated for the LIMD1 transcript in cells (20). Because LIMD1 has been established as a particularly robust SOX target in cells (20), we reasoned that it must contain features optimal for SOX processing and therefore would be an ideal substrate to dissect biochemically why these features are important. Indeed, SOX binding to LIMD1-54 was 10-fold better than to the commonly used reporter substrate GFP, and \u223c100-fold better than to the K2-31 pre-miRNA, which has not been demonstrated to be processed by SOX in cells. Importantly, these binding differences correlated with the efficiency of SOX cleavage in vitro, arguing that the ability to bind the targeting motif is a key step in target recognition. Through RNA footprinting assays, we were able to show that SOX binds to a bulge structure proximal to the cleavage site containing the polyadenosine stretch previously predicted to be important for mRNA cleavage by SOX in cells (20). Mutating either just the bulge structure (LIMD1-54 zipper 2) or maintaining the bulge but mutating the polyadenosine stretch (LIMD1-54 3xA-G) resulted in a \u223c100-fold reduction in binding affinity, correlating with a dramatic decrease in cleavage efficiency. Collectively, these data demonstrate that variability in the efficiency of SOX targeting observed in cells is likely due to differences in RNA sequences that mediate SOX binding.",

However, the structure did not reveal additional interactions between SOX and the RNA beyond the three residues surrounding the cut site. Our data suggest that this is likely because the K2-31 RNA lacks the additional residues necessary for SOX binding site found in both LIMD1 and GFP. While the K2-31 RNA does contain adenosines upstream of the cleavage site, structural predictions indicate these residues are within a stem region (21), rather than in an exposed loop as is the case for LIMD1 and GFP. Together, these observations indicate that while upstream adenosines are important for binding, they must be present in an unpaired state to promote SOX binding. It is notable that prior studies reported much weaker interactions between SOX and RNA (Kd = 75 \u03bcM) compared to its DNA substrates (Kd = 1 \u03bcm) (9,10,21). However, in these cases binding assays were conducted with scrambled RNA sequences. We found that SOX binding affinities to RNA substrates vary over several orders of magnitude, in a manner that correlates with cleavage efficiency. Interestingly, the crystal structure of SOX bound to DNA showed more dynamic interactions along the length of the protein (\u223c480 \u00c52 interaction surface), when compared to the K2-31 RNA bound structure (\u223c240 \u00c52 interaction surface). It is therefore possible that more interaction along the length of SOX protein might occur with optimal substrates such as LIMD1 that are more tightly bound.",
