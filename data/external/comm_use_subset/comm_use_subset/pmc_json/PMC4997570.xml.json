Over 28,000 individuals were infected, over 11,000 died, and there are currently an estimated 16,000 survivors [1,2]. In addition to the tragic loss of life, many survivors are now suffering from sequelae that arose after they recovered from their EBOV infections; these sequelae include visual problems, hearing loss, body aches, severe fatigue, and memory loss [3,4]. Moreover, infectious EBOV has been shown to persist in semen for six months, EBOV RNA has been found in semen as late as nine months post-infection, and at least one case of sexual transmission has been reported [5,6].",

            "text": "Currently there are no approved drugs with which to treat EBOV patients. Consequently, during the recent outbreak several agents were administered to patients on a compassionate care basis; these included the ZMapp cocktail of monoclonal antibodies [7,8], hyperimmune serum [9,10], and several low molecular weight anti-viral drugs [11,12,13]. Additional therapeutic antibodies [14,15,16,17] have recently been described, and two novel low molecular weight viral RNA polymerase inhibitors are in development [18,19]. A different approach has been to screen U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs for anti-EBOV activity, with the goal of repurposing an approved drug, or combination of approved drugs, for use as a prophylactic and/or therapeutic in the advent of a future outbreak [20,21,22,23,24]. Clomiphene surfaced in two independent screens of FDA-approved drugs for anti-EBOV activity [20,21,22]; it blocks EBOV entry and infection in tissue culture cells and provides up to 90% protection in the mouse model of EBOV disease [20,21]. Clomiphene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that is used to treat female infertility due to anovulation [25,26,27]. It was also proposed in 1991 as a drug to reverse impotence in men due to low testosterone levels [28], and is currently used off-label for men with hypogonadism. We found, however, that clomiphene exerts its anti-EBOV activity in cell cultures irrespective of expression of the estrogen receptor alpha and/or beta subunits [20]. Instead, clomiphene likely exerts its anti-EBOV activity because it is a cationic amphiphilic drug [29] that accumulates in endolysosomes, the site of EBOV fusion and cytoplasmic entry [30,31,32]. Similar to other cationic amphiphilic drugs [29,33], clomiphene blocks a late step in the complex process by which the EBOV genome gains access to the host cell cytoplasm to initiate replication, most likely by blocking fusion between the EBOV and endolysosomal membranes [29].",

Whereas enclomiphene exhibits high anti-estrogenic properties, zuclomiphene does not [34,35,36]. The two isomers also differ in other pharmacokinetic properties. For examples, zuclomiphene has a longer half-life in serum [37,38] and persists in most tissues for longer periods of time than enclomiphene [39]. It could, therefore, be proposed that zuclomiphene is the major contributor to adverse side effects seen in individuals given clomiphene citrate and, conversely, that enclomiphene would impart fewer side effects [39,40]. Due to these features, as well as its ability to raise testosterone levels, enclomiphene is currently in clinical development as a treatment for secondary hypogonadism (low testosterone levels) [41].",

The cell medium was collected 24 and 48 h post-transfection and was cleared of cellular debris. VLPs in the cleared medium were pelleted through a 20% sucrose cushion by centrifugation, resuspended in HM buffer (20 mM HEPES, 20 mM MES, 130 mM NaCl, pH 7.4), and repelleted. The final VLP pellet was resuspended (1:100 starting volume of medium) in 10% sucrose-HM. The total protein concentration of the VLPs was determined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay. All entry-reporter VLP preparations were assessed by western blot analyses (for the presence of the indicated glycoprotein as well as EBOV VP40) and titered on Vero E6 cells to confirm entry competency.

As seen in Figure 1A, both isomers of clomiphene (enclomiphene and zuclomiphene) as well as the 4-hydroxy metabolites of each (4-hydroxy-enclomiphene, and 4-hydroxy-zuclomiphene) displayed dose-dependent inhibition of trVLP infection similar to that seen with the parent mixture (clomiphene) when cells were pretreated for 1 h with increasing concentrations of compound. At a dose of 5 \u03bcM, all five forms of clomiphene showed approximately equal potency, reducing the trVLP (Renilla luciferase) signal by approximately 1000-fold. Parallel sets of cells showed no evidence of cytotoxicity by any form of clomiphene (Figure 1B).",

We, therefore, compared the effects of clomiphene, enclomiphene, zuclomiphene, 4-hydroxy-enclomiphene, and 4-hydroxy-zuclomiphene on EBOV entry using entry reporter VLPs, as described previously [20,29,30].

In this system, 4-hydroxy-zuclomiphene appeared more potent than the other forms of clomiphene (Figure 2A), but this is likely an assay-dependent result, as 4-hydroxy-zuclomiphene was not more potent in the trVLP assay (Figure 1A).",

As seen in Figure 7A, enclomiphene exerted a similar effect as clomiphene in blocking entry mediated by the GP from Makona EBOV, the isolate that caused the 2014\u20132015 outbreak in Western Africa, and, as seen in Figure 7B, enclomiphene inhibited entry mediated by a Marburg virus GP, representing a different genus within the filovirus family, similar to the effects of clomiphene.",

The main objective of this study was to assess the abilities of enclomiphene and zuclomiphene to block EBOV infection, as the individual isomers might offer (different) advantages in different clinical settings. We found that enclomiphene and zuclomiphene were highly similar to clomiphene in their ability to block trVLP infection and VLP entry, which are validated surrogate assays for EBOV infection and EBOV entry, respectively. Clomiphene, enclomiphene, and zuclomiphene inhibited VLP entry and trVLP infection with similar IC50 values. Where tested, they were equally effective to each other in two cell types and for entry mediated by three filoviral GPs. 4-hydroxy-enclomiphene, and 4-hydroxy-zuclomiphene also blocked EBOV trVLP infection and VLP entry under the conditions tested. Therefore, we propose that, like clomiphene, enclomiphene and zuclomiphene have potential as pan-filoviral inhibitors in multiple cell types.",

Tragically, many of these survivors are displaying post Ebola virus disease syndromes, including visual problems, hearing loss, and excessive fatigue [3,4]. In addition, infectious EBOV has been found in semen for up to six months [5], raising concerns of sexual transmission [6]. Hence, drugs that accumulate in tissues of the eye and male reproductive tract could be particularly helpful for certain Ebola virus survivors. In this respect it is interesting that, in mice, both enclomiphene and zuclomiphene persist in the eye and male reproductive tract longer than in other tissues, with zuclomiphene maintained at higher levels than enclomiphene. Zuclomiphene was also found to persist in the brain, whereas enclomiphene was not [39].",

The maximum serum concentration (Cmax) for a 60 mg/kg dose (intra-peritoneal administration, IP) of clomiphene to female mice was 5.1 \u03bcM (Lisa Johansen, personal communication) and, hence, above the IC50 for blockade of EBOV infection in tissue culture cells [20,21] and above the IC50 values reported here for clomiphene and its isomers in blocking EBOV VLP entry and trVLP infection (Table 1). The standard dose of clomiphene to treat female infertility is 50 mg/day (per os). With this (oral) dose, reported Cmax values (summed for enclomiphene and zuclomiphene) range from 0.04 to 0.05 \u03bcM (Table 2), ~50\u201360-fold below the IC50 (2.4 \u03bcM in Vero E6 cells) for anti-EBOV activity [20,21]. Therefore, for potential treatment of acute EBOV infections, higher doses of clomiphene would certainly be needed, likely in combination with other anti-EBOV drugs. The human equivalent dose (to the mouse dosing employed in [20]) for an adult weighing 60 kg would be 292 mg clomiphene every other day [46]. In this respect it is noteworthy that higher doses of clomiphene (up to 250 mg/day) have been administered to non-responding (anovulating) females [47,48], and that considerably higher Cmax values were obtained when patients were administered the standard dose of clomiphene (50 mg), but by intravenous administration (IV) instead of the oral route (Table 2) [49]. Hence, it is conceivable that higher doses of clomiphene could be administered (perhaps as part of a cocktail) to treat acute EBOV infections.",

For example, enclomiphene and zuclomiphene accumulate ~50- to ~150-fold, respectively, in the Harderian gland (located in the orbit) and the uveal tract of the mouse eye. Similar accumulation of zuclomiphene was seen in tissues of the male mouse reproductive tract [39]. If such accrual occurs in humans, the standard dose (50 mgs per day, per os) of clomiphene, which contains both isomers, could be sufficient to reach anti-viral levels in the eye and male reproductive tract; the levels would more likely be sufficient if clomiphene were given at a higher dose and/or in combination with another anti-EBOV agent. Interestingly, no sperm were seen in the testes and epididymes of male mice treated for 90 days with 40 mg/kg/day of zuclomiphene [40].",

The metabolism of en- and zuclomiphene in humans is well-characterized [37,38], and differences between the isomers have been shown in mice [39,40]. It will, therefore, be interesting to compare the efficacies of the individual clomiphene isomers in the mouse model of EBOV infection. Studies on their relative efficacies in the eyes and reproductive tract will be especially revealing.",

The activity of the isomers was shown in two cell types and against three filoviral GPs. Both isomers of clomiphene accumulate in tissues of the eye and male reproductive tract. Hence we propose that clomiphene, an FDA-approved drug that provided up to 90% protection in the mouse model of Ebola virus disease, remain in consideration as an anti-EBOV agent, especially for the management of post Ebola virus disease syndromes, including visual problems and the risk of sexual transmission, and especially for consideration as part of a potential drug cocktail.",
