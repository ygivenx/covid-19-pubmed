            "text": "Multiple organ failure with vascular hyperpermeability is a common cause of death in severe seasonal and highly pathogenic influenza A virus infection. The condition is usually associated with hypercytokinemia and severe edema in the lung, heart, liver, kidneys and brain [1, 2]. In our previous studies, we proposed the hypothesis of an \u201cinfluenza\u2013cytokine\u2013trypsin\u201d cycle as one of the key mechanisms of vascular hyperpermeability and multiple organ failure in severe influenza [3\u20136]. In the process of influenza A virus entry into the cell, proteolytic conversion of the viral envelope fusion glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA0) into HA1 and HA2 subunits by host cellular trypsin-type proteases is a pre-requisite for membrane fusion activity [5\u201310] because HA-processing protease is not encoded in the viral genome. Once viral infection ensues, ectopic pancreatic trypsin, which is one of the cellular HA-processing proteases and is expressed in limited amounts in various organs, such as the lungs, heart and brain, is markedly upregulated through the induction of proinflammatory cytokines [3\u20136, 9]. The upregulated trypsin potentiates viral multiplication in various organs, leading to cellular dysfunction, vascular hyperpermeability and fluid imbalance through proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) [4, 11\u201313] and tissue damage [14, 15] with the involvement of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) [10, 16, 17]. Trypsin is also reported to be crucial for infectivity of other viruses, such as rotaviruses, members of the family Reoviridae, and coronaviruses, members of the family Coronaviridae [18, 19], in addition to influenza A virus, a member of the family Orthomyxoviridae, and Sendai virus and Newcastle disease virus, members of the family Paramyxoviridae.",

The presence of high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, however, impairs energy metabolism in mitochondria, leading to cellular dysfunction and organ failure [21]. Although we reported in our previous in vivo and in vitro studies [3, 4, 21] that pro-inflammatory cytokine(s) can trigger trypsin upregulation through the influenza\u2013cytokine\u2013trypsin cycle, it is still not clear whether there is a key cytokine that affects trypsin upregulation, followed by the cascades of multiple organ failure in severe influenza.",

            "text": "In this study, our interest was to identify major pro-inflammatory cytokines that can switch on trypsin upregulation in severe influenza A virus infection. We identified IL-1\u03b2 as a key cytokine capable of inducing IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and trypsin in mouse lungs and human alveolar A549 cells in the early phase of infection. We used four experiments to provide support for this result. First, we found that intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1) upregulated ectopic trypsin in the lungs, while a cytokine mixture that lacked IL-1\u03b2 did not (Fig. 3B). Second, incubation of A549 cells in the presence of IL-1\u03b2 stimulated IL-1\u03b2 secretion initially, followed by secretion of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1, and finally upregulated trypsin mRNAs in the presence of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in the culture medium (Fig. 4 and 5). Third, neutralization of IL-1\u03b2 by monoclonal antibody against IL-1\u03b2 almost completely suppressed such inductions in vitro (Fig. 6). Lastly, intraperitoneal administration of anti-IL-1\u03b2 neutralizing polyclonal antibodies efficiently suppressed the development of inflammatory cell aggregation in the lungs of an infected mouse (Fig. 7).",

Figure 8 illustrates our hypothesis on the role of IL-1\u03b2 in the influenza virus\u2013cytokine\u2013trypsin cycle and its synergistic interaction with IL-6 and/or TNF-\u03b1 as indicated by arrow directions based on our results and the data reported [23\u201326]. Influenza A virus infection upregulates the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1\u03b2, followed by IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1, with synergistic interaction. Since upregulated trypsin efficiently converts pro-MMPs to active MMPs [16, 39], induction of trypsin and active MMPs synergistically degrades the vascular basement membrane and extracellular matrix, resulting in tissue damage, edema, and multiple organ failure. In addition, the upregulated trypsin in turn provokes cytokine release [40], cellular fluid imbalance, and loss of the intracellular tight junction protein zonula occludens-1 [3] via PAR-2 activation. These trypsin-based cascades result in vascular hyperpermeability and multiple organ failure in severe influenza.\n",

Our in vivo experiment using anti-IL-1\u03b2 neutralizing antibodies also demonstrated a similar outcome. In addition, our findings regarding the hypothesis illustrated in Figure 8 highlight the important effect of restraining IL-1\u03b2-stimulation to avoid trypsin-mediated disease aggravation. Moreover, further studies focusing on IL-1\u03b2 directed synergic effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines on trypsin upregulation are needed to strengthen our proposed hypothesis. In addition, several hemagglutinin- processing proteases in human airway epithelium other than trypsin, such as TMPRSS2 and HAT, play roles in influenza virus multiplication [48]. We cannot deny the possibility that upregulation of IL-1\u03b2 and other pro-inflammatory cytokines by infection also induces these processing proteases. Therefore, further studies on the effects of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1\u03b2 on these hemagglutinin processing proteases are needed to understand the pathogenesis of multiple organ failure in severe influenza.\n",
