Mutations in human PITX2 or the forkhead box transcription factor C1 (FOXC1; 6p25, RefSeq NM 001453.2, MIM# 601090) underlie the autosomal dominant disorder called Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome (ARS; MIM# 602482) [2\u20135]. ARS is a full penetrant, but clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by developmental anomalies involving both ocular and non-ocular structures [6]. To date, 87 mutations within the PITX2 gene have been identified including deletions, insertions, splice-site mutations, and coding region frameshift, nonsense and missense mutations [7\u201313].",

            "text": "Identifying new disease-associated variants is becoming increasingly important for genetic testing and it is leading to a significant change in the scale and sensitivity of molecular genetic analysis [14]. One of the most frequent approaches for detecting novel variants in target genes is using direct gene sequencing. However, due to increasing number of newly identified missense variants, it is often difficult to interpret the pathogenicity of these variants as not all the mutations alter protein function, and the ones that do may also have different functional impacts in disease [15,16]. Thus, prior to detailed analyses, novel variants cannot be easily classified as either deleterious or neutral, because of their unknown functional and phenotypic consequences. Therefore, further research should be conducted to validate the genetic diagnosis when a novel missense variant is discovered. Preferably, in vitro characterization of novel variants should be undertaken; however, due to facility limitation, it is often not practicable to experimentally verify the impact of large number of mutations on protein function [17]. Another robust approach to substantiate the pathogenicity is using animal models by generating the homologous mutation that recapitulates the human phenotype; but, similar to in vitro studies, these are time-consuming, labor-intensive, difficult and expensive, making this approach unfeasible to experimentally determine the pathogenicity effects of all novel identified variants [18]. To circumvent the above mentioned limitations and to provide fast and efficient methods for predicting the functional effect of nonsynonymous variants on protein stability, structure, and function, several computational tools have been developed [19\u201321].",

Conformational changes are necessary for many proteins\u2019 function and disease-causing variants can impair protein folding and stability. Missense variants are also capable of impairing protein structure, likely by affecting protein folding, protein-protein interaction, solubility or stability of protein molecules. The structural effect of mutational changes can be examined in silico on the basis of three-dimensional structure, multiple alignments of homologous sequences, and molecular dynamics [22\u201324]. Therefore, analysing sequence data in silico first and detecting a small number of predicted deleterious mutations for further experimental characterization is a key factor in today\u2019s genetic and genomic studies.",

The most common criteria considered in many bioinformatics programs for predicting the functional effect of an amino acid substitution are amino acid sequence conservation across multiple species, physicochemical properties of the amino acids involved, database annotations, and potential protein structural changes [23,25,26]. As mentioned above, resources for in vitro and in vivo functional analysis of novel variants are constrained in most clinical laboratories.

Our results showed that integration of different algorithms with in vitro functional characterization serves as a reliable means of prioritizing, and then functional analyzing, candidate FOXC1 variants [27]. Unlike most previous studies that focused on using only PolyPhen and SIFT to predict the pathogenicity of missense mutations, here, we investigated the predictive value of SIFT, PolyPhen and nine other prediction tools by comparing their predictions to in vitro functional data for PITX2 variants. The bioinformatics programs found to be most reliable were then used to predict the likely consequences of 13 functionally-uncharacterized PITX2 variants. We also performed molecular modeling on all the PITX2 missense mutations located in the homeodomain and compared the results with the findings of protein stability algorithms to identify the most reliable tools in predicting the effect of missense mutations on PITX2 stability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that incorporates the results of functional studies in conjunction with bioinformatics approaches for predicting the pathogenicity of mutations in PITX2 gene.",

This study found 47 PITX2 missense variants; 31 of which were described in the literature as being associated with ARS or coronary artery disease (CAD), while the remaining 16 variants, were considered as benign variants (Fig 1). Eighteen of the 31 variants were classified as pathogenic based on functional studies utilizing site-directed mutagenesis, expression studies, and other functional analysis (Table 1). Thirteen of 31 variants were described as associated with ARS and CAD in the absence of functional analyses on PITX2 structure or function. Sixteen SNPs, with population allele frequencies > 0.0005 were identified from the gnomAD and the ClinVar. Based upon the allele frequency (approximately 10-fold greater than the disease frequency of ARS) these have been considered benign polymorphisms. Nucleotide numbering of the mutations herein indicates cDNA numbering with +1 as the A of the ATG translation initiation codon in the NCBI reference sequence NM_000325.5, while the amino positions are based on the corresponding NCBI reference sequence NP_000316.2.

            "text": "SIFT program provides functional predictions for coding variants, based on the degree of conservation of amino acid residues in sequence alignments derived from closely related sequences, collected by PSI-BLAST algorithm [60]. The PolyPhen-2 (Polymorphism phenotyping-2) server predicts possible effect of an amino acid change on the structure and function of a protein using several sources of information such as straightforward physical and comparative considerations [61]. PANTHER-PSEP is a new application that analyses the length of time a given amino acid has been conserved in the lineage leading to the protein of interest. There is a direct association between the conservation time and the likelihood of functional impact [62]. MutPred is a free web-based application that utilizes a random forest algorithm with data based upon the probabilities of loss or gain of properties relating to many protein structures and dynamics, predicted functional properties, and amino acid sequence and evolutionary information [52]. MutationTaster is a tool that combines information derived from various biomedical databases and uses established analysis programs. Unlike SIFT or PolyPhen-2 which work on DNA level, MutationTaster processes substitutions of single amino acids and allows insertions and deletions [53]. Protein variation effect analyzer (PROVEAN) is a web server which uses an alignment-based score approach to generate predictions not only for single amino acid substitutions, but also for multiple amino acid substitutions, and in-frame insertions and deletions [54]. PMUT focuses on the annotation and prediction of pathological variants. PMUT is trained with a massive database of human disease-causing and neutral mutations. PMUT calculates mutational hot spots, which are provided by three different approaches, alanine scanning, genetically accessible mutations, and a very large database of mutation [55]. FATHMM, a web-server software, is able to predict not only the functional consequences coding variants, but also non-coding variants. To assess the large-scale cancer genomic datasets in a short time, FATHMM provides users with unlimited and near instant predictions for all possible amino acid substitutions within the human proteome [56]. sSNPAnalyzer uses the multiple sequence alignment and the 3D structure to evaluate the possible effect of nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (nsSNP) and also provides extra information about the SNP to aid the interpretation of results, including structural environment and multiple sequence alignment [57]. The Align-GVGD Web-based server uses the biophysical features of amino acids and protein multiple sequence alignments to predict the pathogenicity of missense variants. This tool is an extension of the original Grantham difference to multiple sequence alignments and true simultaneous multiple comparisons [58]. REVEL combines 13 individual prediction tools (MutPred, FATHMM, VEST, PolyPhen, SIFT, PROVEAN, MutationAssessor, MutationTaster, LRT, GERP++, SiPhy, phyloP, and phastCons) as features to predict the pathogenicity of missense variants. REVEL was trained with recently discovered pathogenic and rare neutral missense variants [59]. Please see Table 2 for more information on the prediction tools used in this study.",

DUET is a web server that uses integrated computational approach to predict effect of missense mutations on protein stability [66]. DUET calculation is based on complementary data regarding the mutation including secondary structure [67] and a pharmacophore vector [68]. SDM, a computational method, has been demonstrated as the most appropriate method to use along with many other programs. SDM assesses the amino acid substitution occurring at specific structural environment that are tolerated within the family of homologous proteins of defined three dimensional structures and change them into substitution probability tables [69]. mCSM relies on graph-based signature concept and predicts not only the effect of single-point mutations on protein stability, but also protein\u2013protein and protein\u2013nucleic acid binding [70]. I-Mutant3.0 is a neural-network-based web server that predicts automatically protein stability changes upon single point protein mutations based on either protein sequence or protein structure. I-Mutant3.0 can predict the severity effect of a mutation on the stability of the folded protein [71]. MUpro is a set of machine learning programs that accurately calculates protein stability alterations based on primary sequence information particularly where the tertiary structure is unrevealed, overcoming a major restriction of previous methods which are based on the tertiary structure [72]. iPTREE-STAB is a web service and mainly provides two function modules of services including discriminating the stability of a protein upon single amino acid substitutions and predicting their numerical stability values [73]. CUPSAT uses protein environment specific mean force potentials (through solvent accessibility and secondary structure specificity) to analyse and predict protein stability changes upon point mutations [74]. iStable, a combined predictor, was designed by using sequence information and prediction data from various element predictors. iStable is available with two different input types: structural and sequential [75].

We thus first used molecular modelling analyses to assess and compared the total energy difference between native and mutated modeled structure of PITX2 proteins. The results predicted that while most PITX2 variants did not dramatically affect the protein tertiary structure, seven variants (L54Q, F58L, V83F, V83L, W86C, W86S, and R91P) altered the total energy level in comparison with the native structure, suggesting that these amino acid substitutions changed the structure of the PITX2 protein. Molecular modeling of the PITX2 homeodomain predicted that these variants impair the required energy to maintain the proper folding of helix 1\u20133 and cause global destabilization of the structure of PITX2. These seven amino acids are either invariant (e.g., W86) or highly conserved in the approximately 300 homeobox proteins analyzed, consistent with a pivotal role of these residues in the homeodomain [103\u2013105]. These seven amino acids are tightly packed hydrophobic amino acids responsible for holding helices of the PITX2 homeodomain together, supporting our molecular modeling predicting that mutations of these amino acids disrupt PITX2 structure. For F58L, V83F, and V83L, the native wild-type residues and the introduced mutant residues differ in size, probably causing loss of hydrophobic interactions in the core of the protein, particularly involving helix 1\u20133. For L54Q, W86C, W86S, and R91P, the wild-type residues and the mutant residues are different in both size and charge, likely disturb the local structure of protein thereby altering protein structure and function.",

When assessing the pathogenicity of missense variants, it is necessary to be cautious on depending merely on in silico programs without wet-lab experiments. According to standards and guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants: a joint consensus recommendation of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and the Association for Molecular Pathology, in silico predictions only serve as one supporting factor, whereas functional tests are frequently needed to assess the pathogenicity of missense variants.

The statistics used were calculated as follows: Sensitivity = TP/(TP + FN); Specificity = TN/(TN + FP); Accuracy = (TP + TN)/(TP + TN + FP + FN); Precision = TP/(TP + FP); Negative predictive value (NPV) = TN/(TN + FN); Positive predictive value (PPV) = TP/(TP + FP); Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) = (TP \u00d7 TN \u2212 FP \u00d7 FN)/-([TP + FP] \u00d7 [TP + FN] \u00d7 [TN + FP] \u00d7 [TN + FN]R).",
