            "text": "Rumours can be widely exchanged, thus producing a \u2018public temper\u2019, which is \u2018everybody\u2019s without being anybody\u2019s in particular\u2019 (Durkheim, 1947: 102). This article, therefore, describes an approach to measuring public tempers. Social media are a fertile ground for the dissemination of rumours (Tufekci, 2008). Through social media, rumours have experienced a high level of diffusion and have become more influential than in the past, thereby becoming worthy of serious academic research and scholarly attention (Mintz, 2002). Rumours can sometimes be limited and weak but, at other times, they can hit hard, initiating battles and bringing down political systems (cf. Caplow, 1947; Lotan et al. 2011). The effect of rumours can be destructive (Fine and Heath, 2009), and yet it arguably takes time for this destruction to unfold. A concern is that, if a rumour changes public opinion, and then the rumour is discredited, the changed public opinion can remain the same, despite being based initially on false information. Rumours stick easily in the mind and hence people will mentally and subconsciously go back to them. Put simply, \u2018Once we\u2019ve heard an untrue claim, we can\u2019t simply unhear it\u2019 (Harford, Financial Times, 9 March 2017). Echoing these arguments, this article examines how rumours can help us understand the public temper of a society. It first establishes a conceptual framework for the study, explaining the key existing terms and concepts concerning rumours and presenting the existing kinds of writing on rumours. It then talks about the methodological aspects of this study, setting out the data collection and analysis methods. After that, it presents the key findings and engages in interpretation of these findings. It then discusses these findings and links them back to the literature. Finally, it offers concluding remarks, which outline the research in plain language, show the limitations and suggest further research paths.",

Rumours may be \u2018the oldest medium of mass communication of information or ideas\u2019 (Kapferer, 1990: 1). The literature addresses rumours in relation to three types of information: misinformation, disinformation and, indeed, accurate information (Rosnow and Fine, 1976; Lee, 2014). While misinformation refers to unintentionally made false information, disinformation signifies deliberately made false information. In other words, misinformation comes out of limitations in human communication, while disinformation comes out of the human predilection for shaping one\u2019s surroundings in one\u2019s own interests. Disinformation, unlike misinformation, has the subjective intention to deceive and direct (Jowett and O\u2019Donnell, 2006). It is the outcome of deliberate lies that seek to mislead. Misinformation is the result of honest mistakes. However, the current research is not interested in unearthing the reasons behind inaccurate information. Rather, it looks into what rumours tell us about the nature of the society where they have existed.",

            "text": "Studies have looked into the linguistic aspects of rumour and have outlined a number of terms that people tend to confuse with the term \u2018rumour\u2019. One such term is \u2018humour\u2019. Humour is intended to make one laugh, but rumour is meant to make one believe (Knapp, 1944; Allport and Lepkin, 1945). Another confusing term is \u2018gossip\u2019. Gossip is concerned with private, trivial, pieces of information, whereas rumour is associated with public matters (DiFonzo and Bordia, 2007). That said, there is overlap between these two terms and this overlap is increased by such modern ideas as \u2018infotainment\u2019 and \u2018tabloidisation\u2019. Infotainment refers to information that aims to both inform and entertain (Thussu, 2008). In tabloidisation, journalism does not focus only on politics and foreign affairs but also on entertainment and celebrities (Turner, 1999). Considering these linguistic clarifications, the current study will look into rumour (not humour); into what seeks to be believed (not what provokes laughter). It concentrates more on rumours (not gossip) that relate to public, social matters (not the private and personal).",

            "text": "There are certain terms associated with rumours. One is \u2018propaganda\u2019, which is subjective information intended to trigger emotional (instead of rational) responses so as to encourage particular syntheses, influence audiences, further agendas, promote political causes and alter attitudes towards specific positions (Ross, 2002). Another term is \u2018spin\u2019, which is a type of propaganda associated with the psychological mechanisms of using exceedingly deceitful, misleading and controlling strategies, providing highly biased interpretations of events and/or campaigning to persuade public opinion in accord with or opposition to certain organisations or public figures (Branigan, The Guardian, 12 June 2007). An additional term is \u2018fallacy\u2019 or \u2018fallacious reasoning\u2019, which is the application of deficient, untrue or flawed reasoning when building up arguments (Bustamente and Dahlman, 2015). \u2018Circular reporting\u2019 refers to a condition wherein a piece of information seems to originate from multiple independent sources despite actually originating from one single source. \u2018Doublespeak\u2019 is a term that means intentionally reversing, masking, covering up and twisting the meaning of terms (Kehl and Livingston, 1999). \u2018Hoaxes\u2019 are deliberately fabricated false statements made to masquerade as the truth (MacDougall, 1958). \u2018Fabrication\u2019 is used in scholarly enquiry to refer to the deliberate misrepresentation of research findings by making up data. \u2018Gaslighting\u2019 is a type of manipulation that attempts to spread self-doubt in individuals or communities, with the intention of making them rethink their own memory, insight and understanding (Dorpat, 1994). This article is about rumours, not \u2018contemporary legends\u2019, which have been written about by sociologists, such as Fine (1980) and Best (1997), and indeed by folklorists, historians and psychologists.",

            "text": "There are three types of research into rumours. Type 1 is politically oriented research, looking into political issues surrounding rumours and into the political use of rumours (Briant, 2015). For example, Coast and Fox (2015) have shown the key role of rumours in politics, proving that the act of spreading negative rumours about rivals tends to be more successful than the act of promoting positive messages about one\u2019s own party. Type 2 is psychologically driven research, which studies cognitive matters related to rumours. By way of illustration, Bordia and DiFonzo (2004) have argued that rumour transmission is reflective of a collective explanation process and that rumours are \u2018sense-making\u2019 statements and attempts at solving problems. Type 3 is a lawfully oriented investigation, examining legal topics in relation to rumours. For instance, Sunstein (2009) has discussed rumours in line with their risk to personal reputations and according to libel and privacy laws. What is missing among these approaches, however, is a culturally driven type that examines the cultural dimension of rumours. The present research aims to fill this gap, by looking into the relationship between rumours and the culture wherein they exist. Previous studies have focused on the meanings and uses of rumours, whereas the current study looks into the implications of rumours, at what rumours culturally imply. Hence, the research examines whether it is possible to analyse rumours to see if they can be informants of the culture in which they exist.",

It concentrates on what could be called \u2018scholarly rumours\u2019, which are defined in the current article in two ways. First, they are rumours that present causality, in that they show relationships between causes and effects. Second, they are rumours falsely based on research and experimentation. Scholarly rumours are, arguably, influential, considering that society tends to trust scholarliness. This social trust remains because scholarliness has long been an agent for change, having the power to initiate changes in wider society and push or break down cultural boundaries (Corbyn, Times Higher Education, 5 November 2009). Besides, scholarliness is associated with expertise and has been proved to contribute to the \u2018progress\u2019 of human society and the development of standards of living. Another reason for concentrating on scholarly rumours is that they, unlike non-scholarly rumours, have a tendency to sound more \u2018sophisticated\u2019, to last for a longer time, and even be transmitted from one generation to another.",

They do not happen in a vacuum but are influenced by social norms, cultural values and political agendas. This implies that scholarly rumours can be reflections and, moreover, reinforcers of social realities. The norms and values of a culture can be drivers and subjects of scholarly rumours. Scholarliness can, hence, be misused as a tool in daily social and political games. The scholarly language can be spoken to gain social sympathy. A concern is that, when scholarly rumours are well incorporated into the surroundings, they then become \u2018naturalised\u2019 and hidden in the landscape (Bernardi et al. 2012), resulting in neglect of the politics exercised by them. Scholarly rumours can be implicitly objectified in, and \u2018wrapped\u2019 into, social media, penetrating the social fabric and moving across generations. If scholarly rumours are documented and written down, they act as archives and therefore spaces in which certain kinds of power are codified and justified. With these observations in mind, it would be politically na\u00efve to attempt to conceptualise scholarly rumours in isolation from the political intentions behind them. To interpret and discuss scholarly rumours as isolated elements is to risk treating them as being outside the social fabric. It is therefore well worth considering both the \u2018culturalisation\u2019 of scholarly rumours and the \u2018rumourisation\u2019 of cultures.",

Many members of Saudi Arabian society enjoy \u2018journalistic curiosity\u2019, i.e., they care about knowing what others do. Saudi Arabian society is a collective and communicative community where everyone cares about everyone, which makes it easier for rumours to spread. In other words, rumours are used in Saudi Arabian society to aid social bonding, solidarity and community (cf. Miller, 1992; Dunbar, 2004). Many Saudi Arabs seemingly have both a desire to communicate and an unwillingness to read. So, when they encounter lengthy messages, they combine their desire to communicate with their unwillingness to read by forwarding these messages without reading them deeply or checking their accuracy.",

Many Saudi Arabs forward any information (regardless of accuracy) that displays warnings against something, because of their over-concern and over-care about family and friends. Spreading rumours is seen as a means of enhancing communication among family members and friends, given that such communication has social and cultural value (and is even an obligation). Many Saudi Arabs may not realise the implications and ramifications of rumours, and therefore they exchange and spread them merely for fun and to kill time, socialise and overcome boredom. Many Saudi Arabs like rumours because they see them as \u2018fast food\u2019\u2014i.e., like easy-to-reach and consume \u2018ready meals\u2019. Because information is censored and, therefore, limited, it is less available and this, therefore, encourages rumours. Moreover, the relationship between Saudi individuals and managers is not harmonious, and hence some individuals use rumours as an indirect tool to criticise or challenge managers. In Saudi Arabian organisations, transparency tends to be limited, encouraging members to come up with rumours through which they place pressure on managers to reveal truths and be more transparent. Studying rumours in a collective society is different, and the concern is that some readers of this article (who come from an individualistic culture) may default to individualist modes of thinking.",

Informed consent was obtained from candidates after explicitly describing the relevant features of the research and officially asking for their consent. The participants were then asked to collect rumours as part of their critical engagement with educational technology. They were social-science students, aged between 18 and 22 years, Saudi Arabian, male, single (except for two), undergraduates, unemployed (except seven part-time employees) and came from lower-middle-class or working-class families.

They were asked to use mobile phones during class-time (1 h and 40 min) to collect rumours via social networks (as part of their online curricular activities). Once one student found a rumour, he said it aloud immediately so as to reserve this rumour for himself. That is, one could not reserve any rumour that one\u2019s peers had already reserved. A point was won for every rumour reserved. It was easy for Group 1 to collect rumours (and therefore collect points). Group 2, however, found it difficult to find rumours that had not already been found and therefore reserved by their peers in Group 1. Group 3 faced even more difficulty since their peers in Groups 1 and 2 had reserved so many rumours. Groups 4 and 5 reported finding it \u2018impossible\u2019 (in their words) to find rumours that were not already found and reserved by their peers in Groups 1, 2 and 3.

The task of checking the accuracy of rumours is beyond the scope of this research. This research collects merely what appear to be rumours and what are socially perceived as rumours; that is, what the students thought of as rumours. So, the current study is associated with what is thought to be a rumour and is not intended to examine the accuracy of rumours. The authors designed the study and created the methodology in line with the work of Goodwin and Goodwin (2016), who discuss in-class research. It should be clarified that the research was not on students but rather through students\u2014i.e., employing students as \u2018data-collectors\u2019 (Al Lily, 2013). While it is debatable whether it is ethical to employ one\u2019s students for one\u2019s research (Denzin and Lincoln, 1994), this exercise was seen as part of the students\u2019 practical learning about research.

For example, a political interest that sought to discredit a certain product can be seen in the rumour that \u2018Indomie [an instant noodle brand] results in brain damage\u2019. When one has a strong interest in a particular concept (such as the health risk of sugar and chocolate), one may feel excited about spreading any information (regardless of its accuracy) about this concept, such as the information that \u2018Mars bars contain pieces of plastic\u2019. At times, a rumour shows a positive social interest in something (e.g., music), whereas another rumour exhibits a negative social interest in this same thing.

One such psychological value is, for example, being mature. The importance of maturity can be seen in the following rumour: \u2018Having white hair at an early age is a sign of reaching maturity at an early age\u2019. Moreover, psychologically oriented rumours have been used to make people feel good about themselves\u2014for example, to feel good about their \u2018flaw\u2019 of having white hair. A social value is given to colours through such rumours as \u2018Black cats are inhabited by ghosts\u2019. A curse appears to represent a cultural value, around which a number of rumours have circulated: \u2018If one makes fun of the Quran, one may be turned into a sheep\u2019. Another cultural value is the belief in spirits, which can be seen in the following rumour: \u2018If one cannot get up whatsoever after waking up, this means that a ghost is holding you tightly down\u2019. In other cultures, many of these sorts of outlandish sayings would be called \u2018old wives\u2019 tales\u2019 rather than rumours.",

            "text": "Rumour is not \u2018a deviant act\u2019 (Miller, 2006, p. 505). It is rather the natural human response to uncertain situations and the normal social act of addressing uncertainty (Fine and Heath, 2009). It is a cross-cultural phenomenon, being an inevitable \u2018congenital\u2019 disorder integral to the constitution of society (Gluckman, 1963). There cannot be society without rumour (Shibutani, 1966). Although rumour is essentially a structural \u2018error\u2019 in humanity, the current study has examined the possibility of getting truth out of error (Nietzsche 1996). That is, it has examined whether it is possible to systematically analyse rumours (i.e., errors) to see if they can inform us of truths about the society wherein they exist. It has empirically shown that, with rumours, one can get some idea about the concerns, interests, attitudes and values of a society. Although one may think that a society should be the one to be looked into to understand its rumours, the current study reverses this logic by looking into rumours in a society to understand the society. That is, this study has checked if rumours in a particular society can inform us of this society. So, the investigation has not taken this normal path: society \u2192 rumours. Instead, the path for the investigation has been: rumours \u2192 society. Traditionally, the conditions that can ease the initiation and diffusion of rumours, innovations and the like are subject to examination, and yet this examination does not look into the rumours and innovations after they have been initiated and diffused. In other words, the rumours and innovations should be scrutinised after they have been introduced and spread, just as much as they are scrutinised before they are introduced and spread. Hence, the current study looks into rumours after they have been introduced and spread.",

Another example is that \u2018If one lies, one\u2019s nose gets longer\u2019\u2014again, anyone with even the most limited critical-thinking skills should effortlessly realise how false this rumour is, considering that individuals have lied before and yet their noses have actually remained the same.

Another rumour is that \u2018If a child\u2019s tooth falls out, and then he puts it under his bed, it becomes money when he wakes up\u2019\u2014did anyone not do an experiment on this matter to realise how false this is?

Such phrases have created fertile ground for rumours to be easily and smoothly transmitted throughout society. Such phrases are used so that rumour forwarders can hide behind disclaimers and protect themselves if receivers question or blame them. Rumour forwarders may think that the use of such phrases grants them the freedom to forward \u2018anything\u2019 without even reading what they forward. In fact, such phrases actually show rumour forwarders admitting that they have not critically reflected on the received rumours. Besides, thinking themselves protected by such phrases, one person can forward two rumours that show conflicting interests in the same thing. An appropriate example is when one person forwards both: 1) a rumour promoting honesty (\u2018If one lies, his nose gets longer\u2019); and 2) a rumour promoting dishonesty (\u2018Lying a lot makes one live longer\u2019). Such phrases have been used by some rumour forwarders to show a sense of ethics, referencing and honesty in communicating and passing around information.
