PED is characterized by vomiting and lethal watery diarrhea; and is a global problem, especially in many swine-producing countries [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. PED was first reported in feeder pigs and fattening swine in the United Kingdom in 1971 [8]; since then, it has emerged in numerous European and Asian countries, resulting in tremendous economic losses to the pork industry worldwide. In 2013, the first PED outbreak was reported in the U.S.; subsequently, the outbreak spread rapidly across the country, and similar outbreaks were also reported in Canada and Mexico [4,5,6,7]. In China, PED outbreaks have occurred infrequently with only sporadic incidents [9,10]. However, in late 2010, a remarkable increase in PED outbreaks was reported in the pork-producing provinces [11,12]. In 2014, an outbreak of severe acute diarrhea, with high morbidity and mortality, occurred in sucking piglets in Nanjing, China. Herds vaccinated with the CV777-inactivated vaccine were also infected.",

PED has since become one of the most significant epidemics affecting pig farming in China [13]. PEDV is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus belonging to the genus Alphacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae, and order Nidovirales [14,15]. The size of its genome is approximately 28 kb, with 5\u2032- and 3\u2032- untranslated regions (UTRs) and seven open reading frames (ORFs) that encode four structural proteins, i.e., spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N), and three nonstructural proteins [10,16]. The S protein of PEDV is the major enveloped protein of the virion, associated with growth adaptation in vitro and attenuation in vivo [17]. In addition, the S glycoprotein is used to determine the genetic relatedness among PEDV isolates and for developing diagnostic assays and effective vaccines [18,19,20].",

            "text": "The ability to propagate the virus is critical for the diagnosis and molecular analysis of PEDV, particularly the development of inactivated or attenuated vaccine. However, propagation of PEDV in vitro is challenging. Even though PEDV may be isolated from clinical samples, it gradually loses its infectivity during further passages in cell culture [4]. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the disinfection efficiency in vitro viral isolates using a cell culture system that promotes growth of PEDV. Currently, several PEDV strains, such as CV777, KPEDV-9, and 83P-5, have been successfully propagated in Vero cells using media with added trypsin [21,22,23]. In recent years, new variants of PEDV have emerged that are difficult to isolate and propagate in Vero cells with trypsin. Researchers have attempted to use pig bladder and kidney cells to isolate PEDV, with the addition of trypsin to the medium; this is the first report of isolation of PED virus in porcine cell culture [24]. PEDV infects the epithelium of the small intestine, which is a protease-rich environment, and causes atrophy of the villi resulting in diarrhea and dehydration; this indicates that porcine intestinal epithelial cells are the target cells of this virus. In 2014, Wang et al. established a porcine intestinal epithelial cell line (ZYM-SIEC02) by introducing the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene into small intestinal epithelial cells derived from a neonatal, unsuckled piglet [25]. Several studies have used this established porcine intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) line [26,27]; however, the characteristics of PEDV cultured in this cell line have not been reported.",

The remaining five (5/8) piglets infected with 45th passage showed signs of mild diarrhea after inoculation that seemed to be transient. However, in the control group, the piglets were healthy without watery diarrhea (data not shown). As shown in Figure 6E, one piglet death occurred within 3 days and in total seven piglets died after the 10-day challenge in the group that received the 5th passage. However, only three piglets died in the group that received the 45th passage; although the remaining piglets had the significant clinical signs of PED, they survived the 10-day challenge. The small intestines of one of the dead piglets infected with 45th passage IEC-adapted NJ developed severe clinical symptoms, the same as those in the piglets infected with the 5th passage virus. The small intestines were typically distended with accumulation of yellow fluid and mesenteric congestion, and the small intestinal wall was thin and transparent (Figure 6C,D). The diarrheal feces and intestinal tissues collected from these piglets were analyzed by RT-PCR targeting the M gene, and the PCR products were found to be consistent with the expected result. Moreover, immunofluorescence analysis of the small intestine tissue revealed that the viral antigen was predominantly present in the small intestines (data not shown).",

Following the development of a CV777-based vaccine, based on the PEDV strain, and its wide application in the pig industry in China, only a limited number of incidents occurred before 2010; however, PED outbreaks have subsequently increased in frequency, particularly in pig-farming provinces. Notable, even pigs vaccinated with the CV777-based vaccine were found to be infected [31], indicating the need for the development of effective PEDV-based vaccines for the control of PED outbreaks.",

Although Vero cells are commonly used to propagate PEDV, viral infectivity exhibits a gradual decline during serial passage in these cells. Many PEDV strains isolated from clinical samples were difficult to culture in Vero cells in recent years [4,32,33]. The adaptability of PEDV isolate infected with cell lines was the first step to successful isolation in vitro. Thus, it is urgent to develop new methods or cell lines to improve the tropism of PEDV cultured in cells. In this study, we successfully isolated and propagated the epidemic PEDV strain using porcine intestinal epithelial cells in vitro, and demonstrated that these cells are more suitable than Vero cells for the isolation of PEDV. This is the first report on the characteristics of PEDV cultured in this cell line which was established by Wang et al. [25].",

            "text": "The porcine intestinal epithelial cell is recognized as the target cell of PEDV [27]. Porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN), a functional receptor of PEDV that is highly expressed in the small intestinal mucosa, plays a critical role in PEDV infection [31]. In addition, endogenous protease in the small intestine of porcine can cleave the S protein of PEDV in vivo and facilitate entry of PEDV virions into intestinal epithelial cells, resulting in massive propagation [34]. PEDV strain NJ isolated from clinical samples was as difficult to culture in Vero cells as other isolated prevalent PEDV strains; this is mainly attributed to mutations that arise in genes encoding spike proteins during serial passage. Moreover, the low levels of pAPN in Vero cells are thought to limit the attachment and entry of variant viruses. Before this study, we compared the isolation rate of five different positive PEDV strains isolated from clinical samples cultured in IECs and Vero cells. We found all the CPEs in Vero cells were invisible in three generations, and four PEDV isolates could not be detected by RT-PCR after two generations. In contrast, porcine IECs are more suitable than Vero cells for propagating PEDV isolated from clinical samples in vitro. The CPEs in IECs could be observed at the first or the third passage, and at each passage, cultures could be detected. Due to the characteristics of coronavirus, the degradation of the virus impacts the efficiency of the infection. The S glycoprotein forms peplomers on the virion envelope and contains receptor-binding regions and four major antigenic sites [35,36]; therefore, to minimize damage to the surface projections of the virus, the infected IECs were freeze-thawed only once before inoculation. The PEDV strain NJ was detected in cell culture during serial passages, by RT-PCR as well as immunofluorescence assay, indicating that this strain adapted to infection of IECs. Owing to the sensitivity of IECs, the trypsin concentration used in IEC culture was lower than that used in Vero cells during PEDV absorption. The viral titer of the IEC-adapted PEDV strain NJ propagated in IECs increased gradually and reached 104.5 TCID50/0.1 mL at 45 passages.",

In total, 11 amino acids changed during 45 passages. The eight (8/11) mutations were the same as those occurring in the transition from the classical PEDV CV777 strain to CV777 vaccine strain during serial passaging, which suggests that the high-passage IEC-adapted NJ might show attenuation.
