Globally, approximately 240 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV)1, more than 170 million are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV)2,3, and 75 million are infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)4. These viruses can lead to persistent infection and dysfunction of adaptive immunity2,5. Although HCV infection can be cured with antiviral therapy, treatment for HIV and HBV does not result in complete clearance of the virus. Therefore, patients must take antiviral drugs every day to prevent severe clinical problems such as AIDS or end-stage liver failure5,6. Thus, identifying new strategies that result in complete control of virus is one main goal of basic research.",

            "text": "One important reason for immune dysfunction is the abrogation of the function of virus-specific CD8+ T cells. Typically, in T cell dysfunction CD8+ T cells lose their ability to proliferate and to produce cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF) and interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3). Effector and memory functions are also substantially lost. Next, CD8+ T cells undergo apoptosis and are eliminated by phagocytic cells in a hierarchical manner, called T cell exhaustion7,8. Stimulation through the T cell receptor (TCR) triggers phosphorylation signals that not only activate multiple effector pathways but also ensure that T cells respond to an appropriate signal. CD28 family members are mostly co-stimulatory and provide an activation signal via TCR9. Besides positive activation, negative regulators such as programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain containing 3 (TIM3) signal via TCR and by various cell surface receptors9,10. PD-1 is an important inhibitory receptor that induces the exhaustion of CD8+ T cells. Engagement of PD-1 by its ligands PD-L1 or PD-L2 produces signals that inhibit T cell proliferation and function11,12. Blockade of PD-1 restores the function of exhausted CD8+ T cells and can therefore be used to treat diseases that profit from restored CD8+ T cell function13\u201315. Because of the clinical success of PD-1 blockade in humans, current research focuses on the discovery of other checkpoint regulators of CD8+ T cells.",

Therefore, CEACAM1 was believed to be an inhibitory receptor25 that suppresses the activation of CD4+ T cells26,27. CEACAM1-L and CEACAM1-S variants can undergo dimerization depending on the intracellular calcium (Ca2+) concentration16,28. Interestingly, long and short cytoplasmic variants of CEACAM1 provide both inhibitory and activatory signals16,29\u201331. CEACAM1-4S alone in the absence of CEACAM1-4L has also been shown to promote the induction of regulatory T cells and follicular helper T cells (Tfh cells) in the intestine27. In contrast, it has been shown that CEACAM1 interacts with TIM3 and thereby suppresses CD4+ T cell activation32. Besides its direct involvement in phosphorylation and calcium signaling, CEACAM1 interacts with filamin A and therefore modulates the topology of the signaling complex33. In CD8+ T cells, filamin A interacts with CD28 and lymphocyte-specific protein kinase (Lck) and is therefore an important molecule that modulates membrane rearrangement and CD8+ T cell signaling34. Whether CEACAM1 interacts with filamin A in T cells and thereby contributes to CD8+ T cell function remains unknown.",

We adoptively transferred carboxy-fluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-labeled P14 \u00d7 WT or P14 \u00d7 Ceacam1\u2013/\u2013 splenocytes into WT host animals (CD45.1) and then infected them with LCMV-Docile. Activation of transferred virus-specific P14 CD8+ T cells induced proliferation that was comparable between P14 \u00d7 WT or P14 \u00d7 Ceacam1\u2013/\u2013 CD8+ T cells (Fig. 3a). Therefore, we conclude that the induction of proliferation is independent of CEACAM1 expression. However, lack of CEACAM1 limited the survival of CD8+ T cells after activation, as demonstrated by the finding that the number of transferred P14 \u00d7 Ceacam1\u2013/\u2013 CD8+ T cells were significantly lower than those of the P14 \u00d7 WT CD8+ T cells (Fig. 3b). To further determine whether CEACAM1 acts directly on the expansion of CD8+ T cells after activation, we transferred equal (1 \u00d7 104) number of P14 \u00d7 WT or P14 \u00d7 Ceacam1\u2013/\u2013 splenocytes into WT host animals (CD45.1) and then infected them with 2 \u00d7 104 PFU of LCMV-Docile (Fig. 3c). We found that P14 \u00d7 Ceacam1\u2013/\u2013 CD8+ T cells exhibited less expansion than did control P14 \u00d7 WT CD8+ T cells (Fig. 3d). This finding may be due to the poor survival of CEACAM1-deficient CD8+ T cells after activation. Similarly, CEACAM1-deficient P14 CD8+ T cells exhibited limited IFN-\u03b3 production after in vitro restimulation with GP33 peptide (Fig. 3e), and this reduction in CD8+ T cell expansion and IFN-\u03b3 production was associated with enhanced viral titers in spleen, lung, liver, and serum at day 8 after infection (Fig. 3f).",

However, the number of mature CD4+ TCR\u03b2high and CD8+ TCR\u03b2high T cells were lower in Ceacam1\u2013/\u2013 mice than in WT mice. In line with this observation, we observed lower number of mature T cells in the spleen of Ceacam1\u2013/\u2013 mice (Supplementary Fig. 4b) than in the spleen of WT mice. Therefore, we conclude that CEACAM1 affects the generation of mature T cells, possibly by constraining the TCR-dependent thymic-positive selection process.",

Additionally, 8 days after infection with 200 (Fig. 3h) or 2 \u00d7 104 PFU (Fig. 3i) of LCMV-Docile, the virus-specific Tet-GP33+ CD8+ T cells in blood, spleen, and lymph nodes of the second group of mice were derived mainly from CD45.1 WT mice. We conclude that signals intrinsic to CEACAM1 T cells are essential for the activation, survival, or both of virus-specific CD8+ T cells.

Thus, either the absence of CD28 activation or a deficiency in Lck results in limited phosphorylation of Zap-70 and PLC\u03b3-142-44.

Treatment with anti-CEACAM1 mAb increased the number of virus-specific CD8+ T cells, as measured by GP33-specific tetramer (Fig. 5b); because of these enhanced numbers, viral infection was resolved more rapidly (Fig. 5c). Efficient CD8+ T cell function and more rapid clearance of virus caused less damage to liver hepatocytes and resulted in reduced immunopathology, as measured by the activity of the liver-specific enzymes alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) in mice treated with anti-CEACAM1 mAb (Supplementary Fig. 7).",

We infected WT mice with LCMV-Docile, thereby establishing a chronic viral infection in those mice. On day 16 after infection, one group of mice was treated with an isotype control mAb, whereas a separate group of mice was treated with anti-CEACAM1 mAb (Fig. 5d). Mice treated with anti-CEACAM1 mAb exhibited lower viral loads than did mice treated with isotype mAb (Fig. 5e). To further determine whether treatment with anti-CEACAM1 mAb acts specifically on CD8+ T cells, we transferred equal number of P14 \u00d7 WT (CD45.1) splenocytes into Ceacam1\u2013/\u2013 mice and then treated those mice with anti-CEACAM1 mAb or isotype mAb, followed by LCMV-Docile infection (Fig. 5f). We found that treatment with anti-CEACAM1 mAb enhances virus-specific CD8+ T cell responses not only numerically (Fig. 5g) but also functionally by their ability to produce IFN-\u03b3 (Fig. 5h). Viral titers were significantly reduced in several organs by treatment with anti-CEACAM1 mAb 8 days after infection (Fig. 5i). Together, these findings suggest that treatment with anti-CEACAM1 antibody enhances the function of CD8+ T cells not only quantitatively but also qualitatively and thereby restores the function of exhausted CD8+ T cells in chronic viral infection.",

We tested the binding of human CEACAM1 mAb (clone 18/20, made in-house) on CD8+ T cells from healthy donors. Anti-human CEACAM1 (anti-hCEACAM1) antibody exhibited binding to CD8+ T cells (Fig. 6a). To determine whether this antibody could enhance CD8+ T cell function, we cultured PBMCs from healthy donors with anti-CD28 antibody in the presence of influenza (Flu) peptide (GILGFVFTL) with or without anti-hCEACAM1 mAb. We found that anti-hCEACAM1 mAb enhanced the production of IFN-\u03b3 by CD8+ T cells after restimulation with the Flu peptide (Fig. 6b). Similarly, PBMCs from healthy donors exhibited higher IFN-\u03b3 production when cultured with cytomegalovirus (CMV) peptide (NLVPMVATV) in the presence of anti-hCEACAM1 mAb (Fig. 6c). To determine whether anti-hCEACAM1 mAb can also improve the function of CD8+ T cells in vivo, we used a mouse model expressing human CEACAM1 as a transgene. Newly generated na\u00efve hCeacam1+/+ \u00d7 msCeacam1\u2013/\u2013 mice exhibited a splenic structure resembling that of na\u00efve WT mice (Fig. 2) and expressed substantial levels of CEACAM1 on peripheral blood T cells (Fig. 6d). We treated hCeacam1+/+ \u00d7 msCeacam1\u2013/\u2013 mice with anti-hCEACAM1 antibody and then infected them with LCMV-Docile (Fig. 6e). Treatment with anti-hCEACAM1 mAb enhanced virus-specific CD8+ T cell numbers (Fig. 6f). The number of GP33 tetramer-specific CD8+ T cells was significantly higher in anti-hCEACAM1 mAb-treated mice than isotype control mAb-treated mice. Moreover, the number of NP396 tetramer-specific CD8+ cells was slightly higher in mice treated with anti-hCEACAM1 mAb than in mice treated with isotype control mAb (Fig. 6f). Therefore, we conclude that treatment with anti-hCEACAM1 mAb improves virus-specific CD8+ T cell numbers and function both in vitro and in vivo.",

Certainly, reduced number of B cells and CD169+ marginal zone macrophages contribute to deficient control of LCMV. We then focused on the cell-intrinsic role of CEACAM1 in CD8+ T cells. The absence of CEACAM1 in CD8+ T cells resulted in insufficient CD8+ T cell functions. By conducting adaptive cell transfer experiments, we found that CD8+ T cell-intrinsic CEACAM1 deficiency resulted in reduced viral control in the spleen, lymph node, lung, liver, and serum. Therefore, the absence of CEACAM1 within CD8+ T cells contribute to lack of viral control in Ceacam1\u2013/\u2013 mice. Mechanistically, we found that CEACAM1 deficiency within CD8+ T cells was associated with limited TCR activation. CEACAM1 was involved in the recruitment of Lck into the immunological synapse and thereby promoted the phosphorylation of Zap-70, PLC\u03b3-1, and Erk44/42. Additionally, the absence of CEACAM did not influence the proliferation of CD8+ T cells, but did affect the survival of proliferating CD8+ T cells after activation. In line with this finding, the generation of mature CD4+ and CD8+ T thymocytes was slightly reduced in the absence of CEACAM1. However, the difference is less pronounced than in the generation of virus-specific CD8+ T cells in the absence of CEACAM1.",

The expression of CEACAM1-L inhibits T cell proliferation and thereby prevents inflammatory bowel disease, whereas the expression of CEACAM1-S is essential for the development of Tfh-driven IgA production by gut B cells27. Recently, we found that the expression of CEACAM1-L on B cells enhances Syk phosphorylation after B cell receptor activation and therefore is essential for B cell development, survival, and proliferation17,18. In line with these data, expression of CEACAM1 maintains the splenic architecture including the development of B cell follicles, and CD169+ metallophilic macrophages18. Both B cells and marginal zone macrophages play an important role during LCMV infection37,52. CD169+ macrophages, specifically, play an integral function in preventing early viral propagation immediately after infection37,53. Therefore, it is likely that in addition to reduced CD8+ T cell function, the reduced number of marginal zone macrophages contribute to defective LCMV control in Ceacam1\u2013/\u2013 mice.",

Also, virus-specific human CD8+ T cells can be strongly activated by treatment with a species-specific CEACAM1 antibody. Obviously, it remains unknown whether treatment with anti-CEACAM1 antibody for various types of viral infections, autoimmune diseases, and cancer could similarly benefit T cell function. On the basis of our findings, we speculate that whenever the recruitment of Lck into the immunological synapsis is limited, anti-CEACAM1 treatment would improve CD8+ T cell function and could improve the success of vaccination.",
