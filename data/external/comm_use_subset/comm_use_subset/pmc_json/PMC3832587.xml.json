There are approximately 150 million cases of childhood community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) each year [1], [3]. CAP is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among children in developing countries, which is 10\u201350 times more common than in developed countries [1], [3]. Bacteria as the principal cause of CAP in children has been widely investigated [3]\u2013[5]. In more than 50% of cases, however, there is still a considerable deficit in the aetiologic diagnosis resulting in unnecessary or inappropriate antibiotic prescription [2], [6]. It is clear that the involvement of viruses in CAP have been underestimated due to a lack of understanding of the viral etiology in a clinical setting [7]\u2013[12]. In addition, the appropriate sample from infants and young children is critical for the aetiologic diagnosis of CAP. Lung itself is rarely sampled directly, and sputum, representing lower-airway secretions, can rarely be obtained from children [11], [14], [15].",

            "text": "Among children, CAP may be caused by a wide variety of microbes, including \u201ctypical\u201d bacteria (e.g., Streptococcus pneumonia) and atypical bacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and fungi. Viral infections are also involved with 80% of episodes of CAP in children under 2 years old and over 40% of older children [6]\u2013[11]. Studies of CAP have traditionally focused little on viral causes [2]. So for, very few studies have included an extensive and appropriate evaluation of the role of viruses in the aetiology of CAP in developing countries, including China. In recent years, the introduction of better-quality diagnostic tests has markedly improved the ability to detect multiple viral pathogens [11]\u2013[13], shifting attention to the important role of viruses as a cause of CAP [6]\u2013[11]. According to previous studies, up to two-thirds of childhood pneumonia cases are associated with a viral infection [3]\u2013[11]. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus (IFV), rhinovirus (RV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) are the most common viruses associated with pneumonia [3]\u2013[20]. In addition, the roles of cytomegalovirus (CMV), other herpes viruses (HHVs), recently identified human coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63 and -HKU1) and human bocavirus (HBoV) as causes of CAP in infants and children remain controversial [3], [19]\u2013[25]. So far, pathogenic profiles of HHV and its role in CAP among infants and young children from rural areas have not been well characterized. The present study was undertaken to describe the profiles of HHVs and other respiratory viruses associated with hospital-based CAP and non-CAP among infants and young children in a rural area of China using comprehensive and sensitive molecular diagnostic techniques.",

All CAP patients were also selected according to a set of necessary criteria based on respiratory symptoms (i.e., dyspnea or respiratory distress, cough, tachypnea) or evidence of parenchymal infiltrates on chest radiography. A total of 354 high-quality induced sputum (IS) samples (<25 squamous epithelial cells and >25 leukocytes per low-power field) were obtained from 948 hospitalised infants and young children with respiratory illness in Wenling Hospital from September of 2007 to April of 2008. Two hundred and seventy-three samples were preselected from hospitalised children patients who diagnosed as non typical bacterial CAP within 48 hrs of admission, while 81 samples from hospitalized children patients were set as a control group, whom were clinical diagnosis as non-CAP patients based on chest X-ray and other respiratory signs (asthma, chronic bronchitis or cystic fibrosis) at admission. Typical bacterial CAP based on microbiologic tests, treatment algorithms and an elevated leukocyte count (\u22651010/L) were excluded. In addition, all patients were selected as immunocompetent at baseline and negative for HIV-1 and TB test. All the immunosuppressed or typical bacterial CAP patients were excluded. The children with presumed nosocomical CAP and lower-quality induced sputum (IS) samples were also excluded.",

In this study, we screened for DNA of HHVs in IS samples among infants and young children with CAP using a sensitive multiple PCR assay; of the HHVs considered, only VZV was not detected. The highest positive rate was found for CMV infection (91.6%). CMV infection, which is usually congenital, showed no significant difference among various age groups in this study. These data are consistent with those of previous reports [2], [22], [31]. In addition, it was reported here that CMV and HHV-6 were the only detected viral agent among 25 CAP cases and 5 CAP cases, respectively. Furthermore, the prevalence of CMV among IS samples of CAP were significantly higher than that of non-CAP control group. The prevalence of RSV coinfection with HHVs among CAP group was drastically higher than that among non-CAP control (P<0.05). These data suggest an association between infection with HHVs (especially CMV) and CAP in infants and children.",

In this study, 15 common and recently identified viruses associated with acute respiratory infection were screened using molecular methods. Our results are consistent with previous studies conducted in China or other areas [8], [10], [11], [33], which showed that the most-detected agent was RSV, followed by HBoV, RV, HMPV, ADV and PIV3 in IS samples from infants and children with CAP [3], [11], [14]\u2013[16]. RSV and HBoV were also the dominant viruses detected in IS samples from non-CAP group. Moreover, our data show a higher HBoV detection rate (28.2%) compared with previous reports [23], [24]. The prevalence of HBoV among IS samples of CAP were significantly higher that of non-CAP control group. Similar trends were also observed in the prevalence of rhinovirus and ADV among IS samples of CAP when compared with non-CAP control group. Unlike previous data [34], the prevalence of HCoVs among IS samples was significantly lower in present study. These differences might primarily due to the specimens [11], [15], [16]\u2013IS vs. a nasopharyngeal aspirate or nasopharyngeal wash. In the meantime, the impact of other factors, such as area and the duration of the study period on infection, could not be ruled out.",

The clinical consequences of mixed infections have not been fully understood yet. Evidence suggests that mixed viral infections can lead to more severe condition than individual viral infections [2], [7], [35]\u2013[38]. In this study, it was unable to determine whether the HHVs were reactivated from a latent reservoir after another respiratory virus infection, or if an immunosuppressed condition caused by HHV infection increases the potential risk of other respiratory virus infections. Consequently, it is difficult to estimate the true association between the clinical manifestations and virus infection. At the same time, we understand that the detection of viruses in an IS sample by PCR does not necessarily mean that they are the causative agents of the concomitant CAP.",

To evaluate the real pathogenic role played by virus in hospitalized children with CAP in this study, non-CAP hospitalized children with chronic respiratory illness were set as control group. However, this study still has two major limitations. One limitation of this study is that viral detection from non-hospitalised children (due to limitation of ethics) and patients with bacterial CAP, which would have provided a control group for this study, were not included. Therefore, some viral agents detected in this study may represent asymptomatic persistence, prolonged shedding, or other situations. It is also not possible to evaluate the exact importance of each virus responsible for CAP in most cases. Nevertheless, it is believed that overall this study highlights the importance of HHVs (mainly CMV) and respiratory viruses in Children with CAP.
