            "text": "Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are emerging viruses that cause seasonal epidemics and periodic pandemics. Annual epidemics caused by IAVs are substantial causing >200,000 hospitalizations and >36,000 deaths in the United States each year, and worldwide, cause >20 million new cases of disease in children <5 years of age [1]. Despite substantial research on the mechanisms of action, only modest progress has been made in the development of IAV drugs. While annual influenza vaccines are available, antigenic drift and antigenic shift of emerging viruses naturally reduce vaccine efficacy and control. The current approved anti-influenza virus drugs are the M2 inhibitors (amantadine and rimantadine), and NA inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir) [2\u20134]. Drug-resistance to the M2-ion channel inhibitors is associated with single or multiple amino acid substitutions in the transmembrane region of M2, and more than 95% of transmissible, M2 inhibitor resistant influenza A virus strains carry the S31N mutation [5]. Further, both classes of approved anti-viral drugs are only effective if administered within 36\u201348 h of symptom onset having narrow therapeutic value [5]. Similarly, a number of mutations in the NA of viruses have been demonstrated by selection in the presence of NA inhibitors in vitro, thus new antivirals are actively being sought [6\u201310]. Host cellular genes required by the virus to replicate are appealing anti-viral targets due to their limited development of resistance/mutations, and because there are already small molecular drugs identified that target host genes which are currently under preclinical or clinical investigation and can potentially be repurposed.",

            "text": "Karyopharm Therapeutics has recently developed first-in-class, novel selective inhibitors of nuclear export (SINE) compounds using molecular modeling to screen a small virtual library of compounds against the NES groove of human exportin-1 (XPO1) [11, 12]. These compounds inhibit nuclear-cytoplasmic export by reversibly binding to the cargo recognition site of XPO1 and are orally bioavailable. SINE compounds were originally developed as therapeutics for various hematologic malignancies, as these drugs force the nuclear retention, accumulation, and functional activation of tumor suppressor proteins to limit oncogenesis [12\u201317]. One SINE compound, verdinexor (KPT-335), has completed a registration-directed study in companion dogs with newly diagnosed or first relapsed non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The FDA\u2019s Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) considers the effectiveness and safety technical sections under the Minor Use Minor Species (MUMS) designation complete to support conditional approval for oral verdinexor as a single agent for the treatment of lymphoma in companion dogs under a New Animal Drug Application (NADA). Additionally, verdinexor was recently found to be effective to inhibit the replication of various influenza A and B virus strains by blocking the XPO1-mediated nuclear export of viral ribonucleoprotein complexes [18]. A preliminary in vivo study demonstrated verdinexor was efficacious in limiting virus burden and inflammatory cytokines expression in lungs of mice infected with a mouse-adapted strain of pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza virus (A/California/04/09-MA), and mice that received oral verdinexor treatment also displayed reduced lung pathology and mortality upon lethal virus infection [18].",

However, mice do not accurately emulate the clinical signs of IAV in humans, in contrast to the ferret model, which more closely emulates IAV disease pathogenesis [22, 23]. Furthermore, as in human, predominance of \u03b12,6-linkage sialic acid (SA) is found in the upper respiratory track of ferrets, whereas \u03b12,3 SA are more predominant in mice [23]. A pharmacokinetic (PK) study of oral verdinexor administration in ferrets was conducted to determine the feasibility of investigating the in vivo antiviral efficacy in ferrets (Fig 4a and Table 1). The study showed that verdinexor is orally bioavailable in ferrets, but was more rapidly cleared from the plasma compared to mice [18]. To address this, ferrets were dosed daily (QD) or twice daily (BID) for four days for a total of 4 or 8 doses, respectively, starting at 1 h prior to infection with A/California/04/09. Nasal washes were collected from infected ferrets at day 2 and 4 pi for cytology and evaluation of cytokines expression. Ferrets were sacrificed at day 4 pi and lungs were collected for evaluation of virus titers and pathology. The ferrets that received verdinexor at 15 mg/kg QD, 25 mg/kg QD, 10 mg/kg BID, or the standard oseltamivir treatment regimen showed considerably (p\u22640.001) reduced lung virus titers (Fig 4b).

However, limited reduction in pathology was observed in ferrets that received lower verdinexor dose of 15 mg/kg QD or oseltamivir.

Furthermore, virus cultivation in the presence of sub-efficacious dose of verdinexor did not appear to result in the emergence of drug resistance. In this study, the in vivo late dosing result expands on the previously published findings on verdinexors antiviral efficacy in the mouse model [18]. As oseltamivir has to be administered within 48 hours of infection for its optimal effect [5], this result also demonstrates the added advantage of verdinexor treatment when given late following infection. The current study also shows the multifaceted ability of verdinexor to ameliorate influenza-associated diseases, in which reductions of both lung virus titer and inflammation were observed in verdinexor-treated mice and ferrets. It is expected that these studies will serve as important stepping stones for future clinical evaluations of verdinexor for its anti-influenza indication in human. Further, other human pathogenic viruses have also been reported to co-opt the host\u2019s XPO1 pathway for nuclear exit, including the herpes simplex virus type-1 virus (HSV-1), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [24\u201326]. Thus, it is likely that verdinexor can also potentially inhibit replication of these viruses serving as a broad-spectrum antiviral.",
