Cane toads are now present throughout most of tropical northern Australia and their range is continuing to expand into world heritage areas. Predicted warming due to climate change could extend the range of the cane toad south into what are currently temperate regions [1]. The cane toad is a highly toxic and hardy introduced species and presents wide ranging ecological and social impacts within the Australian landscape. Native species such as quolls, goannas and native frogs are particularly susceptible to the cane toad toxin and many populations have been severely impacted by the arrival of cane toads [2], [3], [4].",

            "text": "Selection of target genes for delivery to cane toads has focused on metamorphosis since it is a critical phase in the amphibian life cycle. Metamorphosis is characterised by rapid and extensive morphological changes [12], [13], accompanied by strong shifts in the expression of genes and proteins at the molecular level [14], [15]. Cane toad genes that are expressed in metamorphs but not in tadpoles therefore represent ideal targets to block and thus manipulate aspects of development. One documented example of the transition from a larval to an adult form in amphibians is haemoglobin [16] and we have used microarray analysis to establish that adult haemoglobin is significantly upregulated during cane toad metamorphosis [17]. Injecting tadpoles with adult globin interfered with expression of this protein in Rana catesbeiana, and induced changes in gene expression profiles of metamorphs [18]. Thus we hypothesise that it may be possible to alter metamorphosis by immunologically sensitising larval stages (tadpoles) to proteins expressed only in later post-metamorphic stages. Adult globin is not a cane toad specific gene; we used it here to determine whether autoimmunity might affect the protein profile of metamorphs. If successful, the concept would be extended to cane toad specific genes that were upregulated at metamorphosis.",

Our results indicate that the altered adult globin protein profile seen in Rana catesbeiana metamorphs after exposure of tadpoles to adult globin does not occur in B.marinus.

The fragments were cloned into the bacterial expression vector pDEST17 and expressed as His6-tagged proteins in E. coli BL21-AI cells (Invitrogen). Cultures were grown overnight (37\u00b0C) in LB supplemented with antibiotics, then diluted 100-fold and grown to an OD of 0.6 (600 nm). L-arabinose (Sigma) was added (0.2% final conc.) to induce protein production and incubation continued for 3\u20135 h. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed and resuspended in Tris-buffered saline (TBS: 50 mM Tris, 500 mM NaCl; pH 7.5), disrupted by freeze/thaw cycles and centrifuged at 10,000\u00d7 g for 30 min. The pellet was solubilised in TBS containing 8 M Urea for 30 min and then centrifuged at 20,000\u00d7 g for 30 min to remove insoluble materials. His6-tagged proteins were purified in the denatured state using Ni2+NTA agarose (Qiagen), washed via imidazole-containing steps (TBS+20, 30 or 40 mM imidazol) and eluted in TBS+500 mM imidazole. Size-based secondary purification was then achieved by continuous-elution electrophoresis (Model 491 Prep Cell, Bio-Rad). Globin proteins were dialysed against amphibian Ringers solution [4.89 g NaCl, 0.298 g KCl, 0.265 g CaCl2.2H20, 0.197 g MgSO4.7H20, 1.495 g NaHCO3, 0.127 g NaH2PO4.H2O and 1.982 g glucose per litre dH2O] overnight at 4\u00b0C and concentrations determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay. Proteins were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (15% gels) using the Bio-Rad Protean II System and visualised with Coomassie brilliant blue. Purified recombinant globin proteins were used as immunogens for the generation of rabbit antiserum. Briefly, two rabbits per immunogen were injected 10 days apart with vaccine containing 50 \u00b5g of either adult (rAdglob) or tadpole (rTadglob) recombinant globin.

As seen for the mRNA studies, we detected no change in the protein profiles of adult globin immunised metamorphs (n = 10) compared to control (n = 9) animals by Western blot (Fig. 4b). Similar results were recorded in preliminary trials conducted using native globin purified from the blood of adult toads rather than recombinant globin. These inoculations had no effect at the morphological or mRNA and protein levels (data not shown). We were unable to detect reactive antibodies (IgY) against recombinant globin protein in any of the animals by ELISA. However, we were also unable to detect antibody to a normally highly immunogenic test antigen (ovalbumin) in metamorphs, although reactive antibodies generated by immunising one adult with ovalbumin were readily detectable (Fig. 5).",

We have previously demonstrated strong upregulation of adult globin genes during cane toad metamorphosis and that this was more pronounced than for any of the other genes induced at metamorphosis [17]. We have also previously shown that the recombinant BIV can be genetically modified to express adult globin in vitro\n[11] and confirmed here that this virus (rBIV/neor/Adglob) is capable of infecting cane toad tadpoles. We therefore used rBIV/neor/Adglob to assess the effect of viral delivery of an adult specific gene or protein to tadpoles on subsequent metamorphosis, and compared this to the effects of immunisation with purified protein and adjuvants.",

Firstly, the cane toad has a very short larval stage of approximately 50\u201360+days, depending on tadpole density and temperature [28] whereas the larval stage in the bullfrog lasts at least 120 days and up to 2 years depending on environmental conditions [29]. The long larval stage in the bullfrog enabled an initial immunisation using FCA, followed by a boost 1 month later [18]. By contrast, cane toad tadpoles in our study were only large enough to be first injected at stage 26 (approximately day 9), barely 3 weeks before the onset of adult globin synthesis at stages 36\u201340 (day 30\u201343) and so a similar boost was not given. Nevertheless we considered that there should be sufficient time for a primary immune response to develop before adult globin appeared, provided cane toad tadpoles recognise the adult globin as a foreign protein. Secondly, due to the large difference between the cane toad and bullfrog developmental time frames, and as age at inoculation was not specified, the bullfrog tadpoles may have been inoculated later in development and been more immunocompetent than in our study. In support of this, studies in Xenopus have demonstrated that immune responses improve with age. The affinity of specific IgY antibodies against dinitrophenol (DNP) in Xenopus larvae is reported to be less than in adults, and in turn much lower than the affinity of mammalian anti-DNP IgG antibodies [30], [31]. The range of antibodies produced to DNP were also less heterogeneous in larval than in adult Xenopus\n[32].",

In mammals the antiviral response relies on cytotoxic T lymphocytes and these are Major Histocompatibility Complex Class I (MHC class I) restricted. Larval Xenopus reportedly lack MHC classical class I expression [33] suggesting the antiviral response in larvae may be compromised. Studies of the adaptive immune response in Xenopus adults and larvae to frog virus 3 (FV-3), the type virus of the ranavirus genus, indicate this may be so. While adult Xenopus cleared an initial infection and showed an accelerated response to a second injection, tadpoles were much more susceptible, suffering a high mortality rate and a reduced ability to clear the infection compared with infected adults [34]. In spite of lacking MHC class I, tadpoles do have CD8 T cells [35] and so the role played by the lack of MHC class I in the poor antiviral response is unknown. While most of these studies have been carried out in Xenopus, limited studies indicate bullfrogs are capable of mounting a detectable antibody response to an antigen, but apparently not to influenza virus despite repeated inoculations and a substantial and anamnestic response to bacteriophage T7 [36]. Our own studies indicate that B. marinus tadpoles did not mount a detectable antibody response to a widely used and well characterised immunogen, ovalbumin, to which adult B. marinus did respond.",

The last stage point represents an average of 6 individuals. Adult globin copy number was normalised to a toad actin housekeeping gene. b: Western blot analysis of whole animal extracts (upper panel) provides a general indication of the adult globin protein levels in normal developing animals (stages 28, 36 and 46), as well as FCA control and rAdglob treated animals. The lower panel shows the Coomassie brilliant blue staining for the same blot and provides an indication of total protein loading. rAdglob (\u223c) is an additional 3.3 kDa larger than native adult globin due to Hisx6 tag and linker. Adult (*) control was generated using purified globin from the RBCs of adult B. marinus. The blot is representative of rAdglob treatments (n = 10) and FCA controls (n = 9).",
