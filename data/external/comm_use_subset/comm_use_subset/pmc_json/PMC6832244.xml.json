NAFLD is a multifactorial disease that is caused not by excessive alcohol consumption but by pathological accumulation of triacylglycerol in hepatocytes [1]. Excessive import or diminished export or oxidation of free fatty acids (FFAs) in hepatocytes causes hepatic steatosis [2]. Hepatic triglyceride (TG) accumulates through glycerol and FFA esterification [2]. For unknown reasons, some patients develop non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and, in more severe cases, liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and even hepatocarcinoma [2].",

With an imbalance of lipid metabolism in the liver, insulin fails to inhibit lipolysis of adipose tissue, increasing the efflux of FFA into the circulation and its uptake by the liver [3]. FFA can be transported into the mitochondrial matrix by specific transport proteins and undergoes \u03b2-oxidation [5,6,7,8]. Hyperinsulinemia directly inhibits \u03b2-oxidation of FFA, promoting hepatic de novo lipid synthesis through upregulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and carbohydrate response element-binding protein [5,6,7,8]. Recent studies have applied in vitro approaches to determine the molecular mechanisms involved in hepatic steatosis progression [9].",

The whole plant can be used in herbal remedies, and its tender leaves have been used in dishes or sauces for several years [13]. Until now, hundreds of phytochemical compounds have been identified in T. sinensis, including polyphenols (phenolic acid, flavonoids, stilbene, and lignan), terpenoids, and sterols [14]. It was reported that aqueous extract of leaves of T. sinensis (TSL-1) exhibits many biological functions, such as antiviral [15,16], antibacterial [17], antidiabetic [18], anti-obesity [19], hepatoprotective [20,21], and anti-cancer [22,23,24] functions. However, little is known about other parts of T. sinensis. Our preliminary results demonstrated that, among the root, leaves, bark, and fruit of T. sinensis, the bark and fruit could block lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. It has been shown that a diet with T. sinensis leaves, root, or bark (TSB) enhances sperm quality and improves memory in senescence-accelerated prone-8 mice [25]. T. sinensis fruit (TSF) extract exhibits strong antioxidative effects and protects the kidney from diabetic nephropathy [26]. The present study investigated the molecular mechanism of the effects of TSB and TSF extracts on lipid accumulation using an in vitro cellular model.",

NAFLD is not a benign disease [31]; a substantial proportion of the population is at risk of progressive disease [2]. T. sinensis is a popular dish in Asia and Taiwan, and vegetarians use it as flavoring. Since it is nontoxic and easily cultivated, T. sinensis is widely used as an herbal remedy [32,33]. TSB and TSF have also been used in traditional medicine [13]. In this study, we found that both TSB and TSF extracts blocked the increase of intracellular TG levels and lipid droplets in FFA-treated hepatocytes. Fatty acids transported to the liver are esterified to TG or oxidised to produce energy [34]. However, an increase in TG level is harmful to hepatocytes [35]. The levels of TSB and TSF extracts used in the study were nontoxic to cells. Interestingly, TSB was even more effective than fenofibrate (a hypolipidaemic PPAR\u03b1 agonist). The anti-steatotic effects of TSB and TSF on NAFLD in an in vivo model are currently being examined.",

LXRs\u2019 lipogenic activity arises from upregulation of the master regulator SREBP-1c and induction of FASN, ACC and SCD1 [38,39]. Our data are consistent with this finding. TSB and TSF extracts activated AMPK activity while inhibiting FASN, ACC, SCD1, and LXR expression and TG accumulation.

It has been reported that gallic acid, quercetin, and rutin exhibited anti-steatotic effects on high-fat-diet-fed mice [43,44]. Toosendanin, a triterpenoid extracted from Meliaceae plants, is also known as the major ingredient in Meliaceae fruit, which has been reported to possess antiadipogenic activity in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes [45]. Interestingly, toosendanin in the nanomolar range completely inhibited lipid accumulation, while other compounds attenuated lipid accumulation by only 5%\u201310%. We suggest that TSB and TSF extracts were complex, and all ingredients in the extracts contributed partly to attenuate lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. Therefore, polyphenol-rich TSB and/or TSF may be a safe and potential herbal remedy to prevent NAFLD.",
