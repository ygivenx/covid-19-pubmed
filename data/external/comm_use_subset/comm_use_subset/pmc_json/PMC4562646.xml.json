            "text": "Rolling circle amplification (RCA), which is based on the mechanism of the replication of viral genomes, is an isothermal nucleic acid amplification technique that uses two primers, a circularized template and a DNA polymerase with strand displacement activity [1\u20135]. RCA efficiently synthesizes many copies of repeated sequences from circular DNA and RNA templates (Fig 1). Moreover, it detects single nucleotide polymorphisms using a circularized DNA probe called a padlock probe as well as efficiently amplifying bacterial genomes by a hyper-branch method [6\u201310]. Isothermal DNA polymerization has various application possibilities [11\u201314]. Microwave heating technology is applied to organic and inorganic chemistry using a microwave generator to produce useful effects such as rapid heating, decreased reaction times, and improved product yield and purity[15\u201318]. The microwave effect is debated to be the \u201cThermal-effect,\u201d \u201cNon-thermal effect,\u201d and \u201cSpecific microwave effect (superheating or selectivity heating)\u201d[19, 20]. One of the mechanisms of microwave heating in organic chemistry involves heating a low molecular weight compound with a dipole polarization and an ionic conduction. Enzymatic reactions (in the fields of proteomics, pretreatment, degradation, chemical synthesis, and optical resolution) are performed using microwave heating [21\u201325]. Published studies on PCR using microwave heating (microwave-assisted PCR, MW-PCR) show that amplicon synthesis is inefficient, large reaction volumes are required, and temperature is difficult to control or measure [26]. We reasoned that these problems may be attributed to the use of three temperatures (for annealing, elongation, and denaturation) in the MW-PRC method that are not precisely controlled by microwave heating. Temperature measurement under microwave irradiation is a matter of importance [27, 28]. For strict temperature control by microwave irradiation, a gene amplification study using microwave was reported in Milliliter-scale PCR [29]. Microwave device with several frequencies for PCR is developed to accurately control temperature [30, 31]. In contrast, RCA does not require complex temperature control compared with conventional PCR methods, and isothermal conditions are appropriate for controlling microwave heating. In our previous study, we reported the microwave-assisted RCA for the first time using a multi-mode microwave generator[32], but the reproducibility was difficult. We developed a novel single mode resonant cavity microwave generator with fiber-optic probe to improve accurate temperature measurement and reproducibility. Further, this applicator can be used by a conventional PCR-scale (50\u2013100 \u03bcL). MW-RCA was performed using a circular DNA template and four thermostable DNA polymerases with strand displacement activity. We focused on microwave selectivity heating, which is one of the features of microwave heating. Microwave selectivity heating is thought to alter molecular motion state compared with conventional heating when the reaction temperature is the same. To examine the components of RCA responsible for microwave selectivity heating, we measured the temperature of RCA components under conventional and microwave heating conditions at the same temperature. MW-RCA, which increased the components of selectivity heating, was performed.",

Fluorescence intensity showed a 4-fold increase than conventional RCA in 30 min. Repetitive DNA sequences repeated four times (300 bp) and eight times (600 bp) were accurately replicated using MW-RCA using Bst-LF under microwave irradiation. The results of each assay showed that the yields of DNA produced by MW-RCA using the Bst DNA polymerase (60\u00b0C) were markedly greater compared with those by conventional RCA during the first 30 min (Fig 4B). The fluorescence intensities of the MW-RCA reaction sampled at 20 and 30 min and those of the conventional RCA reaction sampled at 60 min showed that the former plateaued at 20 min (Fig 4B). The Bst DNA polymerase was the most effective enzyme for MW-RCA. In the same way, MW-RCA using the Csa DNA polymerase was accelerated at 60\u00b0C compared with conventional RCA, and polymerization was increased at 20 min. In contrast, DNA synthesis was not detectable in the conventional RCA reaction at 30 min (Fig 4C). The fluorescence intensity in MW-RCA using Csa was higher by a factor of 30 at 30 min compared with that of the conventional RCA, and it was almost equal to that of conventional RCA at 60 and 90 min (Fig 4C). Reactions using the 96\u20137 DNA polymerase were incubated at 55\u00b0C, its optimum temperature, and showed an increase in discrete bands at 120 min, representing repeated sequences that were detected in the conventional RCA reaction. In contrast, MW-RCA using the 96\u20137 DNA polymerase showed diffuse migration of high molecular weight DNA molecules at 20 min, although DNA synthesis using conventional RCA was undetectable after 60 min. The fluorescence intensity of the conventional RCA reaction products at 90 min was twice as that of MW-RCA at 30 min (Fig 4D).

Similarly, MW-RCA using a 4-fold excess concentration of MgSO4 equivalently accelerated to an MW-RCA reaction containing a 4-fold excess concentration of (NH4)2SO4, although the conventional RCA reaction mixture containing a 4-fold excess concentration of MgSO4 yielded a slight increase of DNA.",

We considered the possibility that microwave-assisted enzymatic reactions are more effective at higher temperatures compared with those at typical physiological conditions. Using four thermostable DNA polymerases with strand displacement activity, we compared the products of MW-RCA and conventional RCA and found that microwave heating accelerated the reactions catalyzed by the four DNA polymerases compared with conventional heating at the same temperature (Fig 4). In a previous study, DNA amplification of MW-PCR, which was controlled at the precise temperature using the three steps, was reported [29]. In this study, RCA using four thermostable DNA polymerases was accelerated by microwave heating. A RCA reaction is equivalent to an elongation reaction of three steps (annealing, elongation, and denaturation) of PCR.

We hypothesized that the microwave selective heating could be observed with heating of only one of each buffer component under microwave irradiation. We accordingly prepared four samples of one-fold ThermoPol buffer components [Tris-HCl, KCl, (NH4)2SO4, and MgSO4] and four samples of ThermoPol buffer components in four-fold excess concentrations, and measured their temperatures under microwave heating (Fig 6).

There was no influence of pH change by the additional buffer component in RCA (S4 File). All results of microwave heating were accelerated compared with conventional heating (Fig 7). Two notable results were observed. MW-RCA with 40 mM of (NH4)2SO4 was accelerated relative to the control MW-RCA, whereas RCA with 40 mM of (NH4)2SO4 was amplified like the control of conventional RCA. (NH4)2SO4 plays the role of a buffering solution and is not important for DNA polymerization. In contrast, Mg2+ is necessary for the function of DNA polymerase. The conventional RCA reaction mixture containing 8 mM of MgSO4 contained a slightly amplified concentration of DNA. Conventional RCA with 8 mM of MgSO4 was not at optimum concentration, although MW-RCA reaction in mixtures containing 8 mM of MgSO4 was accelerated. As shown in Figs 5 and 6, buffer solutions of (NH4)2SO4 and MgSO4 showed large temperature increases per 1 mM under microwave irradiation. These findings suggest a link between the amplification of MW-RCA and the temperature increase of (NH4)2SO4 and MgSO4 under microwave irradiation.",

            "text": "In conclusion, we report here the development of a microwave applicator for enzymatic reactions and demonstrate the effect of microwave heating on RCA of DNA. The temperature profiles of RCA components by microwave heating suggest that the ionic components of the ThermoPol buffer are selectively heated and that the rate of temperature increase induced by microwave heating depends on the components of a molecule and the concentrations of buffer components. These findings indicate that (NH4)2SO4 and MgSO4 play important roles in the mechanism of MW-RCA. The shortened reaction time and higher product yields indicate that microwave heating systems can be widely used to enhance enzymatic reactions. Studies are being conducted to further improve the maximum incubation time at temperatures higher than 60\u00b0C as well as to enhance the visualization of the heating process. Preliminary results indicate that MW-RCA can be accelerated at 37\u00b0C.",
