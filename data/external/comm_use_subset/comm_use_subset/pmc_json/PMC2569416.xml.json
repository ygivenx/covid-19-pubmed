Recombinant adenoviruses have been shown to elicit significant immune responses to bacterial (anthrax, plague), viral (Hepatitis C, Rabies, SARS) and tumour-associated antigens [1]\u2013[3]. While these results are encouraging, immunity eventually develops against virus capsid proteins. This severely reduces the immunogenicity of adenovirus-based vaccines in mice, [4]\u2013[8], primates [9] and humans [10]. This problem is also significant since a large portion of the Western world has marked levels of anti-adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) antibodies and is also prominent in regions of sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, where many of these vaccines are needed [11], [12]. Thus, assessment of the impact of pre-existing immunity on immune protection and alternative vaccination strategies may be needed for successful use of many adenovirus-based vaccines.",

Increasing the vector dose or adopting a prime-boost regimen in order to overcome pre-existing immunity to the virus is a common approach [2]. There is mixed enthusiasm for this plan, however, due to the documented toxicity associated with high doses of adenovirus and the length of time required for prime-boost regimens when only a prime could be sufficient [13], [14]. \u2018Seroswitching\u2019, using recombinant adenoviruses constructed from chimpanzees or rare human serotypes with limited exposure rates such as adenoviruses 35 and 11 can elicit potent immune responses that are minimally affected by pre-existing immunity [7], [8], [15]\u2013[21]. Hexon-chimeric adenoviruses can also avoid neutralization [22], [23]. Both approaches offer promise in the context of addressing pre-existing immunity, but require further investigation in response to concerns regarding safety and feasibility of large-scale production. Covalent attachment of polyethylene glycol or incorporation of the virus into polymer matricies can also effectively protect Ad5 from neutralization [24]\u2013[31]. Delivery of Ad5-based vaccines by mucosal routes can also circumvent the effect of pre-existing immunity and induce a significant immune response against an encoded antigen [32].",

This has since led to several Phase I clinical trials [34], [35] in which each component of the vaccine is administered by intramuscular injection. To date, there have been only two reports describing mucosal administration of an Ebola vaccine [36], [37].

According to established protocols, 10 \u00b5g of monomethoxypoly(ethylene) glycol, activated by tresyl chloride (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), was added for each microgram of protein present [38]. The coupling reaction was performed at 25\u00b0C with gentle agitation. The reaction was stopped by the addition of L-lysine, in a 10-fold excess with respect to the amount of PEG added. Unreacted PEG, excess L-lysine, and reaction byproducts were removed by buffer exchange over a second Econo-Pac 10DG disposable chromatography column equilibrated with 100 mM potassium phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). PEGylated preparations were administered in sterile potassium phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4) and had particle to plaque forming unit (pfu) ratios of 100\u22361 or less as determined by the Adeno-X rapid titer kit. Characterization of these preparations revealed significant changes in biophysical properties of the virus once the reaction was complete such as the PEG-Dextran partition coefficient and peak elution times during capillary electrophoresis (as described previously [30], [38]).

Intracellular staining and flow cytometry (FACS) revealed that Ebola glycoprotein peptide-specific activation of CD8+ T cells, as measured by production of IFN-\u03b3, occurred in na\u00efve animals immunized by the nasal route at a frequency of 3.9\u00b11% (I.N., Figure 1A).

At the time of vaccination, mice had an average anti-adenovirus circulating NAB titer of 1\u2236320. Pre-existing immunity did not significantly alter activation of CD8+ T cells when the vaccine was given intranasally (I.N.+PEI, 3.6\u00b11%, p = 0.07). Oral immunization lowered the response against Ebola glycoprotein (P.O., 2\u00b10.5%). Samples obtained from animals with pre-existing immunity and vaccinated in the same manner were barely above the positive threshold (three times the average background level obtained from animals treated with the irrelevant virus, AdlacZ).

Animals treated with the AdlacZ vector alone (AdlacZ-control) served as negative controls and produced 0.5% CD8+, IFN-\u03b3+ T cells in response to the Ebola glycoprotein-specific peptide.",

In this context, T cell mediated immune responses were assessed by ELISPOT from various tissue compartments specific to the route of immunization 45 days after vaccination. The number of activated IFN-\u03b3 secreting mononuclear cells harvested from splenocytes was significantly reduced by 38 and 59% in mice vaccinated nasally or orally when compared to those immunized by intramuscular injection (p\u22640.05, Figure 2A). In contrast, samples obtained from the spleen of animals with pre-existing immunity that were immunized by the I.N. route contained the highest number of activated IFN-\u03b3 secreting cells (815\u00b1190 spot-forming cells (SFC)/million mononuclear cells (MNCs), Figure 2C) although this was approximately 30% lower than that seen in naive animals (1,340\u00b1146 SFC/million MNCs, Figure 2A). Pre-existing immunity also significantly reduced the number of these cells produced by animals immunized by the I.M. (210\u00b168 SFC/million MNCs) and P.O. routes (71\u00b112 SFC/million MNCs) with respect to those seen in na\u00efve animals (2,145\u00b112 (I.M.) and 885\u00b1168 (P.O.)), p\u22640.05, Figure 2A). A very limited number of activated IFN-\u03b3 secreting mononuclear cells were detected in splenocytes of na\u00efve animals immunized with the AdlacZ vector (50\u00b120 SFC/million MNCs, Figure 2A) and those with pre-existing immunity to the same virus (12\u00b11, AdlacZ, Figure 2C). Significant levels of INF-\u03b3 positive cells were detected in bronchioalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) after intranasal immunization (146\u00b114 SFC/million MNCs, p\u22640.05, Figure 2B). This was not significantly compromised by pre-existing immunity to adenovirus (120\u00b116 SFC/million MNCs, p\u22640.06, Figure 2D). A limited number of INF-\u03b3 secreting cells were detected in BAL from na\u00efve animals immunized by the I.M. or P.O. routes (4\u00b12 and 11\u00b15 SFC/million MNCs respectively, Figure 2B) and were similar to that seen in samples obtained from animals given the AdlacZ vector (12\u00b11, negative control). Pre-existing immunity to adenovirus reduced these cell populations further to values that were not statistically significant (1\u00b11 (I.M.), 5\u00b12 (P.O.) and 2\u00b11 (AdlacZ) SFC/million MNCs (p = 0.08, Figure 2D)). INF-\u03b3 positive cells were found in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and Peyer's Patches (PP) (146\u00b111 and 29\u00b15 SFC/million MNCs, respectively) only after oral vaccination with Ad-ZGP (Figure 2B).

To date, few efforts have been made to focus on the mucosa as the primary sight of exposure to Ebola virus and priming it for participation in the host defense by vaccination [47]. This is surprising given that the pulmonary, nasal and oral immune systems which comprise the mucosal-associated lymphoid tissues (MALT) are responsible for the production of approximately 80% of all immunocytes [48], [49] and mucosal immunity is often the first line of defense against pathogens coming in contact with susceptible hosts. Many studies in rodents indicate that systemic immunization produces strong anti-viral systemic responses while mucosal vaccination can stimulate both the mucosal and systemic immune systems and can confer long-term immunological memory against a given pathogen despite the fact that the magnitude of these responses are often reported to be somewhat reduced [37], [48], [50]. We have found this to be the case in the studies outlined here since the systemic cellular response and neutralizing antibody levels against Ebola Zaire GP were consistently lower following nasal and oral vaccination. Mucosal vaccination did, however, generate significant cellular and antibody responses in the periphery (BAL, MLN or Peyer's patches) and a single intranasal immunization with Ad5-ZGP conferred 100% protection even in the presence of pre-existing immunity.",

            "text": "Administration of recombinant adenovirus-based vaccines to the mucosa has also conferred sufficient protection against challenge with a variety of pathogens in the presence of pre-existing immunity to the vaccine carrier in mice and other pre-clinical models of disease [5], [19], [32], [51], [52]. This served as a basis for the present study. A single intranasal dose of a recombinant Ad5 vaccine expressing the Zaire Ebola glycoprotein conferred 100% protection in both na\u00efve mice and those with pre-existing immunity despite the fact that the strength of the immune response generated by this route of administration was quantitatively lower than that seen in animals vaccinated by intramuscular injection. It is also important to note that pre-existing immunity induced by intramuscular injection did not severely compromise the T cell-mediated response at either the systemic or mucosal levels in these animals. The level of anti-Ebola GP antibodies in the circulation and in the lung was also not significantly compromised by pre-existing immunity to adenovirus. While these results suggest that intranasal vaccination with an Ad-based vaccine is indeed a promising strategy to overcome pre-existing immunity, one might wonder how accurately our results translate to natural exposure to the wild type virus via the respiratory tract. This is somewhat difficult to establish in the mouse model since the ability of the wild-type adenovirus to replicate is limited [53]. In addition, the amount of neutralizing antibody present in the nasal cavity of those in the general population with pre-existing immunity to adenovirus 5 has not been assessed to the degree that serum neutralizing antibodies have, making it difficult to set a relative parameter for one to target in pre-clinical animal models. Lack of this data may be due to the invasive nature of the technique for acquiring samples and/or the fact that antibody levels in the mucosa of individuals with established pre-existing immunity to adenovirus type 5 are quite low and transient in contrast to systemic levels of anti-adenovirus neutralizing antibodies which are quite robust and persist over time (unreported observations). Thus, for these studies, we decided to induce pre-existing immunity against adenovirus by intramuscular injection at a dose that has been shown to induce production of systemic neutralizing antibodies at 1\u2236320, a level mostly below what was reported in humans with documented pre-existing immunity [8], [11], [12]. Additional studies designed to assess the amount of neutralizing antibody to AdHu5 in the lung over time after intranasal administration of varying doses of AdHu5 are currently underway in an effort to further define stringent conditions under which pre-existing immunity can be established for experimental testing.",

Immunization by this route induced quantitatively lower T and B cell mediated immune responses against Ebola glycoprotein with respect to that achieved by either intramuscular or intranasal immunization. Despite this, every na\u00efve animal immunized with a single oral dose of Ad-ZGP survived challenge, giving better precision on the minimal threshold of immunity required to achieve protection. As seen with intranasal immunization, the T cell-mediated response was not compromised by pre-existing immunity 10 days after oral vaccination. The number of IFN-\u03b3 secreting T cells in both mucosal and systemic compartments of these animals at day 45, however, was significantly reduced by pre-existing immunity. It is possible that the peak T cell response at day 10 does not reflect the extent by which pre-existing immunity decreases the Ad5-ZGP-induced T cell response. Alternatively, it is also possible that the ELISPOT assay could detect subtle variations that flow cytometery could not monitor accurately due to differences in the sensitivity of each assay. Neutralizing antibody was not detected in the serum of animals with pre-existing immunity given a single oral dose of the vaccine. More importantly, none of these animals survived challenge with mouse adapted Ebola.",

Interestingly, the T-cell mediated immune response was significantly reduced and antibody levels increased in na\u00efve animals given a single oral dose of the PEGylated vaccine with respect to that seen in animals given the same dose of unmodified Ad5-ZGP. It has been shown that modification of virus capsids by PEGylation can significantly dampen the T-cell mediated immune response against the virus and stimulate the antibody response against a secreted antigen [26], [27], [30], [54]. Taken together, these data support the notion that the exposition of the virus capsid proteins facilitates the immune response against the encoded antigen. Optimization of PEGylation chemistries and/or densities on adenovirus-based vaccine that promote and strengthen protective immune responses following oral immunization is currently underway.",

Vaccines administered in this manner will offer improved safety with respect to disease transmission and needle-stick injuries among health care workers, significant issues of concern in developing countries where the demand for many vaccines is high [55]. Mucosal administration of vaccines reduces the pain associated with vaccination, eliminates the need for specialized training programs for large vaccination campaigns and makes self-administration of the vaccine possible. This route of administration may also significantly reduce systemic toxicity associated with recombinant adenovirus despite the fact that it has been shown that nasal immunization with recombinant adenovirus-based vaccines can facilitate translocation of the virus to the central nervous system [52]. Even though testing of other virus-based vaccines such as influenza have reported similar findings and are currently used in the clinic [56], studies designed to fully assess the toxicological profile of adenovirus vaccine after nasal administration are also currently underway.",

While these results are extremely encouraging, further characterization of the immune response against both the encoded antigen and the adenovirus vector in larger, clinically relevant animal models is vital for both understanding the biology of Ad vaccines and for the development of an effective Ebola vaccine suitable to populations with different requirements [57], [58]. The issue of pre-existing immunity must also be adequately addressed in order to develop efficient recombinant adenovirus-based vaccines. While the majority of the literature suggests that pre-existing immunity significantly hamper the effective use of AdHu5 vaccine carriers, other investigators have reported that pre-existing immunity did not interfere with the potency of recombinant Ad5-based vaccines in both pre-clinical models of disease and in humans [59], [60]. Thus, additional studies identifying clinically relevant conditions under which to test Ad-based vaccine candidates are necessary to assess the full impact of pre-existing immunity on vaccine potency, including in different compartments. Better define the role of pre-existing immunity on vaccine-induced immunity will further the understanding of how individuals previously exposed to adenovirus will respond to these immunization regimens.",
