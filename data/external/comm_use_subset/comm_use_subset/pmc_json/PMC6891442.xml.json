S. vastus is well-known for its wound healing activities which were proven by pre-clinical test in rats [3]. In addition, the integument tissue is rich in collagen and can be used as a functional ingredient in nutraceuticals, cosmetics and food products [4]. Furthermore, S. vastus contains novel bioactive peptides which inhibit angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) and also possesses radical scavenging activities [5]. H. leucospilota is widespread throughout the Red Sea, Persian Gulf and the entire Indo-Pacific. Its main habitat are shallow areas, such as reef flats, shallow costal lagoons, and seagrass beds. In some areas such as the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), Marshall Islands, Kiribati, Samoa, Tonga, Cook Islands, Papua New Guinea (PNG), Solomon Islands and Fiji, people consume holothurian\u00b4s gonad as food delicacies and as additional protein diets [6]. H. leucospilota has shown antioxidant effects as well as anticancer activities against HeLa, human lung carcinoma (A549) and skin melanoma (B16F10) cells [7,8,9,10]. Several bioactive compounds have been isolated from it such as leucospilotaside A to C, echinoside B, holothurin A, holothurin B, and holothurin B2 [11]. Organic extracts of body wall, gonad and intestine of H. leucospilota exhibited bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal activity against Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus [12]. This bacteriostatic effect from the organic extracts was confirmed against the Gram-negative bacteria like Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and against the Gram-positive S. aureus and the filamentous fungi Aspergillus niger, A. fumigatus, A. flavus and A. brasilensis [13].",

However, holothurians likely present another very interesting target for the isolation of bioactive bacteria. Since they are being (a) used in traditional Chinese medicine and (b) exposed to, ingesting and reworking marine sediments, which have been shown to be a promising source for the isolation of bioactive bacteria. Even more so, if Actinobacteria, which are prolific producers of bioactive compounds, are the target bacteria phylum, since Actinobacteria have been isolated repeatedly from terrestrial soil and marine sediments. Thus, sediment bioturbating holothurians with their associated microbiome should be a promising target to isolate novel Actinobacteria. A recent publication by Gao, et al. (2014) showed that Actinobactria were enriched in the gut of four deep-water holothurian, accentuating that also shallow water holothurians could be a promising target for the isolation of bioactive Actinobacteria [29].",

Another approach is to focus on drug discovery from unusual environments and unusual biological sources. As many of the terrestrial environments have been investigated in detail for decades, screening of terrestrial organisms and plants is increasingly yielding known compounds rather than novel compounds and new drug leads. Likewise, antibiotic screens from soil derived microorganisms often resulted in the re-discovery of already known antibiotic compounds [53]. To circumvent re-discovery, untapped sources such as various marine ecosystems (e.g., coral reefs, twilight zone habitats) are getting in the focus of researchers [54].

The isolated Actinobacteria produced interesting bioactive metabolites, which exhibited activity against HCV, bacteria, and fungi. In addition, the potentially novel Actinobacteria genera and species displayed anti HCV properties, requiring further research on these bacteria to identify the new anti-infective compounds. It is known that secondary metabolite producing bacteria synthesize different metabolites under certain environmental conditions (i.e., temperature, salinity, O2 stress, different media composition) or when co-cultured with other microorganisms. Such an approach could be a promising strategy for the discovery of new anti-infectant compounds with the new bacteria genera and species.",

There are several reasons why sea cucumbers are a promising source of novel bacteria and potentially bioactive compounds: (1) Sea cucumber have an important ecological role in the marine environment through bioturbation of the sediment, thereby extracting and removing organic material, microalgae and bacteria from the sediment and defecating sediment with a lower organic content [57]. During this process they likely enrich certain bacteria in their gut microbiome [29]. (2) Due to their slow movement and soft to leathery body walls, sea cucumbers rely mainly on potent chemistry for their defense against predators such as fishes. Echinoderms in general are known to have a diverse metabolome that can be highly affected by their surrounding environment and their diet [58]. However, up to this point, it is not known whether the bioactive compounds are produced by the host or the associated microorganisms. ",

Another interesting bioactivity of valinomycin was its potency against the causative agent of the world\u2019s first pandemic in the 21st century; the SARS-CoV virus. Unfortunately, valinomycin also showed enhanced cytotoxicity that prevented the drug to enter the clinical phase [63,64]. The other precursor ions (cf.

Precursor annotation as false positive in MS2 databases has been reported to be in linear correlation with true positive precursor annotation [66]. It means, as more compounds or libraries are added to MS2 databases, the probability of a false positive analysis of the target compounds becomes higher. Orthogonal analysis of the compounds (cf.

Prior to DNA isolation, cell material was spun down and the supernatant removed. For each sample, a barcoded 16S rRNA gene PCR was performed with primers amplifying a 292 bp fragment in the V4 region as previously described [73]. The composite forward primer consisted of the Illumina 5\u2019 adapter, a 8-nt barcode, a 10-nt pad sequence, a 2-nt linker and the 515F-Y 16S rRNA gene-specific primer, whereas the composite reverse primer consisted of the Illumina 3\u2019 adapter, a 8-nt barcode, a 10-nt pad sequence, a 2-nt linker and the 806 rB 16S rRNA gene-specific primer [74] (Table S3). PCR amplifications were performed in a final reaction volume of 25 \u00b5L containing 5 \u00b5L Green GoTaq\u00ae reaction buffer (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), 0.5 \u00b5L 10 mM dNTPs (Promega), 0.5 \u00b5L 10 \u00b5M forward primer, 0.5 \u00b5L 10 \u00b5M reverse primer, 0.15 \u00b5L GoTaq\u00ae DNA polymerase (5 U/\u00b5L, Promega) and 1 \u00b5L template DNA (0.1\u201310 ng/\u00b5L). The PCR program consisted of: initial denaturation of 2 min at 95 \u00b0C; 30 cycles of denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 20 s, annealing at 55 \u00b0C for 15 s, and extension at 72 \u00b0C for 2 min; and final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 10 min. Samples were amplified in triplicate, after which the reaction volumes were pooled and 5 \u00b5L combined solution was run on a 1% agarose gel to assess amplification success. Next, the PCR products were purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands). DNA was eluted from the spin column with 10 \u00b5L distilled DNase/RNase-free water (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA). The DNA concentration of the elute was measured with the Nanodrop 2000c (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). An equimolar mixture of PCR products from unique samples, i.e., a sample library, was prepared and run on a 1% agarose gel. The gel band at ~292 bp was extracted and purified using the ZymocleanTM Gel DNA Recovery Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA). Elution was done with distilled DNase/RNase-free water. The sample mixture was reduced in volume by vacuum drying, and subsequently sent for Illumina paired end MiSEQ sequencing (2 \u00d7 250 bp) at GATC Biotech (Konstanz, Germany). A negative control sample was also included in the sample library because weak amplification was regularly detected in PCRs without template.

Based on these results the 69 active strains were further cultured and extracted to be tested against human pathogenic microorganisms. Seed cultures were prepared by picking a bacterial colony from a 24 to 48 h old marine agar plate into a 15 mL Falcon tube holding 10 mL of liquid Marine Broth media (Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany). After 3 days, 1 mL of this starting culture was transferred to 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask holding 100 mL of fresh Marine Broth media. All flasks were incubated at room temperature (about 23 \u00b0C) for 10 days to assure that the cultures reached the late stationary phase.

So, the highest bioactivity of the extract is the highest dilution (highest letter) in which the well still showed activity. Extracts showing activity in at least three wells were fractionated with semi-preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for peak-activity correlation. HPLC conditions were as described in [78]. Every 30 s 150 \u00b5L extract were collected in a new well of 96-well plates. After fractionation, the dried plate (N2) was inoculated with the former inhibited test organism (150 \u00b5L/well) and incubated overnight. The inhibited wells could be correlated with peaks/retention time/UV-spectrum in the chromatogram. Active extracts were further analyzed by UPLC-HRMS.",
