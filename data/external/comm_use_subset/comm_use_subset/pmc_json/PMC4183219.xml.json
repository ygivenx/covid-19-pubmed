For prostate cancer (PCa), a number of tumor-associated aberrant carbohydrates have been identified and characterized, including the glyco-isoforms of PSA [1\u20133], sulfated glycolipid [4] and blood group antigens and precursors [5,6]. The latter represent a diverse panel of O-glycans. These include, but are not limited to, T antigen [7,8], Tn, sialyl and globo-H [9]; the branched and linear type II backbone regions (I and i antigens); the difucosylated Ley or the monofucosyl, or monosialyl compound of sialyl-Lex, blood group H and Leb [10]; type I backbone-based sialyl-Lea [11]; and sialyl-Lex in association with metastatic PCa [12].",

Wandall et al. [13] developed an O-glycopeptide microarray to monitor human autoantibody responses to tumor antigens that they successfully used to detect cancer-associated IgG autoantibodies against different aberrant O-glycopeptide epitopes derived from MUC1 in sera from breast, ovarian and prostate cancer patients. Last year Blixt et al. [13,14] reported that the presence and level of autoantibodies were significantly higher in the sera from cancer patients compared with sera from the control subjects and a highly significant correlation with age was observed. High levels of a subset of autoantibodies to the core3MUC1 and STnMUC1 glycoforms (GlcNAc\u03b21-3GalNAc-MUC1 and NeuAc\u03b12, 6GalNAc-MUC1, respectively) were significantly associated with reduced incidence and increased time to metastasis. These results suggest that autoantibodies to aberrantly glycosylated MUC1 in early stage breast cancer are associated with a better prognosis.",

Using a novel sialoglycan microarray presenting multiple Neu5Gc-glycans and control Neu5Ac-glycans, these investigators found that antibodies against Neu5Gcalpha2-6GalNAc\u03b21-O-Ser/Thr (GcSTn) are more prominent in patients with carcinomas than in patients with other diseases. Thus, these xeno-autoantibodies and xeno-autoantigens are considered potential targets for diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic applications in human carcinomas.",

These markers include high-mannose (Man9) clusters; tri-antennary type II or multivalent type II (Tri/m-II) chains; and the agalactosyl derivatives, Tri-/m-Gn (GlcNAc)-glycoepitopes. As illustrated in Figure 1, they share the N-glycan Man-cores but differ in the terminal sugar moieties. Unlike the fully glycosylated cellular N-glycans, which are often capped by Neu5Ac, these targets expose the internal sequences that are normally \u201ccryptic\u201d to the immune systems. However, some viral pathogens express these carbohydrates on the surfaces of their virions. For examples, the HIV-1 envelop glycoprotein gp120 are heavily coated with Man9 clusters [19,20] and the spike protein of SARS-CoV expresses Tri/m-II moieties [21]. Importantly, viral neutralizing antibodies often target these carbohydrates [19\u201323].",

Flow cytometry analysis revealed that a monoclonal antibody (mAb), TM10, established by this immunization strategy illustrates a unique binding profile. TM10 does not bind to the cell surface of untransformed normal cells but strongly binds to a number of murine and human tumor cell lines, including those from melanoma, prostate, breast and ovarian cancers. Our carbohydrate microarray analysis revealed that TM10 recognizes the oligomannosyl epitopes presented by two Man9 clusters, (Man9)n-keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) and [(Man9)4]n-KLH [24], which were constructed to investigate the HIV-1 neutralizing epitopes recognized by a human mAb 2G12 [19,20].",

By contrast, carbohydrate microarrays detected significant levels of anti-ASOR (IgGASOR) and anti-AGOR (IgGAGOR) antibodies in sera from both BPH and PCa patients. Since OR, ASOR and AGOR have identical protein components, the differential antibody activities associated with them reflects glycan-binding specificities.

This indicates that while the group means between PCa and BPH did not differ significantly (P=0.14306), a subset of PCa patients produced significantly increased levels of IgGASOR compared with the BPH group.

An extended analysis of a larger cohort of PCa and BPH subjects is clearly required to determine the diagnostic and prognostic value of these autoantibodies. However, current study has sufficiently demonstrated that human immune systems actively recognize the Man9- and Tri-/m-II-expressing autoantigens and produce targeting antibodies. Since these carbohydrate moieties are generally \u201ccryptic\u201d but become highly expressed or surface-exposed in a number of tumors, it is worthwhile to further investigate their potential for the targeted immunotherapy against corresponding tumors. Much remains to be learned about the mechanisms of the host immune recognition and antibody responses to this class of cryptic glyco-antigens.",
