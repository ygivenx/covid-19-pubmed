            "text": "Protein ubiquitination is an important post-translational modification that regulates a variety of cellular biological processes [1,2,3], i.e., signaling transduction [4], protein turnover [5], cell cycle progression [6], and the immune and inflammatory responses [4,7,8], etc. This modification, however, can often be reversed by deubiquitinases (DUBs) through removing various ubiquitin molecules from substrates [9]. Not surprisingly, many DNA and RNA viruses have evolved to encode DUBs to manipulate diverse cellular pathways [10]. The currently discovered viral DUBs largely resemble their cellular counterparts in structure and generally fall into two major classes: ubiquitin-specific proteases (USP) (e.g., coronaviruses, herpesviruses, picornaviruses, etc.) [11,12,13,14,15] and ovarian tumor proteases (OTU) (e.g., arteriviruses, nairoviruses and tymoviruses) [16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23]. Functionally, most of the viral DUBs have been demonstrated to exhibit an immune suppressive activity in vitro and negatively regulate host innate immunity such as interferon signaling and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines [8,24], although the biological significance in virus infection remains to be determined for many of them. This report concerns the deubiquitinase of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), a positive-stranded RNA virus in the family Arteriviridae of the order Nidovirales [25,26] and a major pathogen of swine that causes colossal annual economic losses to the worldwide swine industry [27,28,29,30,31].",

            "text": "The PRRSV deubiquitinase is specified by the papain-like protease 2 domain (PLP2) that is located within the N-terminus of nonstructural protein 2 (nsp2), a multi-domain and multi-functional replicase protein in the virus life cycle [20,21,32,33,34,35,36]. Phylogenetically, PRRSV PLP2 belongs to the newly identified OTU superfamily that represents a novel class of cysteine proteases [16], its putative catalytic sites (Cys55-His124) (Figure 1A) are highly conserved not only among arteriviruses but also among all OTU family members [16,37,38]. The core domain of PRRSV PLP2 has a size of about 100 amino acids (nsp2 aa. 47\u2013150) based on the sequence alignment with the equine arteritis virus (EAV) PLP2 and other OTU family members [39,40]. Different from EAV PLP2, the downstream flanking sequence (aa. 152\u2013240) of PRRSV PLP2 core (Figure 1A) is however required for the protease activity [19,34]. Earlier biochemical studies have demonstrated that the PRRSV PLP2 possesses both cis- and trans-cleavage activities that mediate the proteolytic cleavage at nsp2/3 junction [34]. Moreover, these two activities can be decoupled by a point mutation of the residue Asp-89 [34]. A D89N mutation can selectively block the trans- but not cis-cleavage activity of PLP2. Consequently, this mutation is lethal to PRRSV [34].",

Further, Deaton et al. have reported the DUB activity of PRRSV PLP2 by in vitro assay and found that the E. coli purified recombinant PLP2 (aa. 12\u2013215) is able to cleave both K48 and K63 poly-ubiquitin chains in vitro [41]. On the other hand, although PRRSV PLP2 was shown to have deISGylation activity in transfected human cells [21], the recombinant PLP2 showed little in vitro deISGylating activity toward ISG15 of porcine origin [41,42], leaving in question whether it can actually efficiently cleave swine ISG15 conjugates in primary macrophages.",

However, their biochemical properties and the contribution to viral infection have remained poorly defined. In this study, we started with characterizing the PLP2 DUB activity of HP-PRRSV strain JXwn06 by using in vitro and cell-based assays. By using site-directed mutagenesis, we were able to identify mutations that can differentiate the DUB activity from cis- and trans-cleavage activities and assess their roles in the context of PRRSV infection by reverse genetics analysis. Our results revealed novel biochemical aspects of PRRSV PLP2 and showed that the PLP2 DUB activity, but not the cis-cleavage activity, is likely important for PRRSV replication. Unexpectedly, we also revealed a strong link of PRRSV nsp2 to virus-induced inflammation that occurs in a DUB-independent manner. The findings further advance our understanding of PRRSV nsp2 function and it is the regulation of host immunity and has implications in antiviral drug and vaccine development.",

This fragment, however, was expressed at a very low level in our hands, preventing further efficient purification. Since the downstream flanking sequence (nsp2 aa. 241\u2013323) is critical for PRRSV nsp2 function during infection [34], we hypothesized that this region might be critical for the folding of PLP2 domain, and if so, a C-terminal extension might improve the solubility and yield of PLP2. Accordingly, we made two additional constructs to include PRRSV strain JXwn06 nsp2 region aa. 12\u2013240 and aa. 12\u2013323 (Figure 1B). These proteins were tagged with a strep II epitope tag at the C-terminus to facilitate purification. When expressed in E. coli BL21 cells, PLP2 (12\u2013240)-strep II mostly existed in the pellet, preventing it from efficient affinity purification in large scale (Figure 1B, lane 4). In contrast, PLP2 (12\u2013323)-strepII was well expressed, and a substantial amount was presented in the supernatants (Figure 1B, lane 8). Moreover, this fragment in the sonicated supernatants could be subsequently purified to homogeneity by one-step affinity purification (Figure 1B, lane 10) with a yield of 3\u20135 mg per 100 mL culture. Thus, we have successfully developed a strategy to realize high-level soluble expression of PRRSV PLP2.",

We first tested its ability to hydrolyze Ub-AMC, an ubiquitin conjugated aminomethylcoumarin fluorophore (AMC). By monitoring the release of AMC, the DUB activity was measured. As shown in Figure 2A, the purified PLP2 exhibited DUB property in vitro with better activity achieved at a higher concentration (1\u03bcg). Next, we examined the cleavage of a specific type of polyubiquitin chains (Figure 2B,C). Overall, when the total amount of processed Ub monomer and dimers (Ub+Ub2) was calculated, PRRSV PLP2 exhibited similar efficiency in cleaving both K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitin chains Ub3-7 (% cleavage efficiency = Ub1+Ub2/Ub1-7) (Figure 2B,C). However, PRRSV PLP2 display a differential activity converting K48 and K63 linked ubiquitin dimers into monomers. The results showed that the cleavage into monomer of K48-linked Ub3-7 was relatively inefficient (Figure 2C) with the reaction taking place in a dose and time-dependent manner (Figure 2C). For example, at a lower dose of PLP2 (1 \u03bcg), K48-linked Ub3-7 was mainly cleaved into Ub dimers (Figure 2C, lane 2), even if the incubation time was extended to two hours (Figure 2C, lane 6). However, when the dose increased (3 \u03bcg), PLP2 could hydrolyze K48 Ub3-7 efficiently into monomers within 1 h (Figure 2C, lane 4). The difference in kinetics toward cleaving K63 versus K48 Ub3-7 was further investigated in a more detailed time-dependent manner from 5 to 120 min at a concentration of 1 \u03bcg for PLP2. The result showed that PLP2 was able to quickly cleave both K63 and K48 Ub3-7 within minutes (Figure 2D,E), but the conversion from ubiquitin dimer to monomer was several fold faster for PLP2 K63 DUB activity (Figure 2D\u2013F).",

Thus, we, therefore, selected other 5 residues (D84, D85, T88, E90, D91) for further mutational analysis with a purpose to distinguish DUB from its trans-cleavage activity. The acidic residues were changed to either the residue asparagine (N) or to the opposite charge residue arginine (R), whereas T88 was replaced with either serine (S), glycine (G), or arginine (R).

For a negative substrate control, the PLP2 cleavage site at the nsp2-3 junction was mutated to make the construct nsp2-3\u03941\u2013399 G1166P (Figure 5A). As shown in Figure 5A, except for the control D89N, all other PLP2 mutants were capable of efficiently processing the nsp2-3 polyprotein, suggesting that the mutations did not affect the trans-cleavage activity of PLP2.

            "text": "We next investigated whether the same mutations affect the PLP2 cis-cleavage activity. Since cis-cleavage is essentially an intramolecular interaction, the mutational effect was evaluated by using the full-length nsp2-3 polyprotein precursor as reported previously [34]. In addition, since both cis- and trans-cleavage activities can direct the nsp2-3 cleavage [34], the trans-cleavage has to be silenced in the first place before proceeding to test the effect on cis-activity. Here, we took advantage of the D89N mutation, which is able to decouple the nsp2 cis- from trans-cleavage activity by using PRRSV strain VR-2332 [34]. Consistently, the D89N mutation strongly reduced the trans-cleavage activity of PLP2 to process nsp2-3\u03941\u2013399 in trans in the cotransfection assay (Figure 5A, lane 16), and the cleavage efficiency was only about 2\u20133%. To make sure the full-length nsp2 carrying D89N mutation also behaves the same as seen for the PLP2 fragment (Figure 5A, lane 16), we introduced this mutation into the full-length nsp2 of PRRSV strain JXwn06. As expected, the full-length nsp2 carrying D89N mutation also failed to process in trans the polyprotein nsp2-3 lacking the protease domain (nsp2-3\u03941\u2013399) in the co-transfected cells (Figure 5B, lane 5), suggesting the trans-cleavage activity is blocked. When the same mutation was introduced into the nsp2-3 precursor (nsp2-3 D89N), it, however, did not affect the processing in cis of nsp2 from nsp2-3 D89N (Figure 5C, lane 2). Thus, this result is in agreement with the previous report based on PRRSV strain VR-2332 [34]. Next, we introduced the corresponding acidic cluster point mutations into the background nsp2-3 D89N (Figure 5C), which allows only cis-processing of nsp2. To our surprise, the mutations (e.g., D85N, D85R, T88R, and D91R) that largely ablated the DUB activity also blocked the cis-activity of PLP2 (Figure 5C, lanes 6, 7, 13, and 14, respectively). In contrast, neither D84N nor D84R affected the cis-cleavage activity (Figure 5C, lane 4 and 5). Notably, the mutation T88G could selectively block the PLP2 cis-cleavage activity (Figure 5C, lane 12), as the mutant PLP2 T88G was still equipped with trans-cleavage activity (Figure 5A, lane 11) and largely DUB activity (Figure 4A, lane 11). Together, these results suggest that the requirement for PLP2 DUB activity somehow is more closely related to that for cis-cleavage activity, rather than the trans-cleavage activity. In addition, T88G is a critical mutation that can differentiate the cis-cleavage activity from DUB and trans-cleavage activity.",

(i) Mutations (D85N, D85R, T88R, and D91R) that largely blocked the DUB activity in cell-based assay were all lethal to the virus, (ii) mutations (D84R, D84N, T88S, and E90Q) that did not have an effect on DUB activity did not affect viral viability, (iii) the point mutation T88G that selectively blocked the PLP2 cis-activity did not affect viral viability in cell culture, and (iv) the mutation D91N and E90R, which did not affect either of the PLP2 activities, somehow did not allow the rescue of viable virus. Together, our results strongly suggest a dispensable role of the PLP2 cis-activity for PRRSV viability. On the other hand, the fact that the cis-cleavage activity is not required for PRRSV replication suggests that the lethal phenotype of several point mutations (D85N, D85R, T88R, and D91R), which blocked both DUB and cis-activity, is not due to a block in cis-cleavage activity, but may be linked to the inactivation of PLP2 DUB activity.",

All the mutants tested showed relatively similar growth properties to the parental virus, except for the mutant T88G, which exhibited reduced growth in MARC-145 cells by about half a log and a slight decrease in PAMs although being statistically insignificant (Figure 6B). To test the stability, we sequenced the PLP2 mutation region at the end of experiments or P4 viruses. The results showed that the mutations were stable (Figure 6C). In addition, we did not see any other compensating mutations arising within nsp2. Since PRRSV nsp2 is involved in antagonizing host innate immunity and the PLP2 mutants did not have an apparent growth defect in primary PAMs, we tested whether mutations have an effect on inflammatory cytokine production rather than on interferon signaling. In particular, we focused on the expression and secretion of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 (Figure 7), the most potent inflammatory cytokines. To this end, primary PAMs were infected with WT or mutant viruses with an MOI of 0.1. At 24 h post-infection, the mRNA level of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 were measured by relative quantitative RT-PCR normalized against peptidylprolyl isomerase A (PPIA), a molecule that has been previously used for internal control [46,47,48]. The results showed that PRRSV strain JXwn06 significantly upregulated the mRNA expression of both TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 (Figure 7A). On the other hand, the effect on IL-6 was not impressive (Figure 7A). Interestingly, the mutant E90Q exhibited greatly reduced ability to induce expression of both TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, and to a lesser extent by the mutant T88G (Figure 7A). Similarly, none of the mutants affected the level of IL-6 (Figure 7A). We also measured the secretion of these cytokines in the infected supernatants by ELISA. Consistent with a reduction at the mRNA level, we observed a significant drop of TNF-\u03b1 in the cell culture supernatant from primary PAMs infected with the mutants T88G and E90Q (Figure 7B). For IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6, we tried several commercial kits, and unfortunately, they did not work well in our hands.",

The deubiquitinating ability of nsp2 or its derivatives was then tested in transfected 293T cells by co-expression with HA-ubiquitin. Consistent with the phenotype exhibited by the truncated nsp2, the mutant nsp2 E90Q (Figure 8B, lane 4) behaved just like WT nsp2 (Figure 8B, lane 3), and nsp2 T88G was largely DUB-active (Figure 8B, lane 5). In contrast, the catalytic site mutation C55A blocked the DUB activity of the full-length nsp2 (Figure 8B, lane 3). Together, the above data provided strong evidence on a critical role of PRRSV nsp2 in inducing TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 during infection, and also this property of nsp2 is independent of the PLP2 DUB activity.",

In this report, we went much further to reveal several important biological aspects of this particular protease. Beginning with the in vitro purification, we found that the downstream flanking sequence (nsp2 aa. 240\u2013323) was critical for the yield and solubility of PLP2 domain in the prokaryotic expression system (Figure 1B). Although a previous study reported that the PRRSV strain JXwn06 PLP2 (nsp2 aa. 1\u2013215) is sufficient for DUB activity in vitro, but it did not provide description about the expression level and purification of this fragment [41]. In our hand, this fragment was unfortunately poorly expressed in E. coli BL21 cells despite attempts for optimization of expression conditions. Although truncation is usually the way for protein expression, we used an unconventional approach to solve the problem, making a C-terminal extension dramatically improved the PLP2 yield and solubility (Figure 1B). Our results suggest that the flanking sequence likely plays an important role in the folding of PLP2 core domain, and this is consistent with our previous finding that deletion of nsp2 aa. 240\u2013323 is lethal to PRRSV strain VR2332. The realization of high-level soluble expression also paves the way for future structural studies and in vitro anti-PLP2 drug screening.",

This difference is likely attributed to the PLP2 flanking sequence (aa. 240\u2013323) (Figure 2), which can promote the folding of PLP2 core domain, leading to increased cleavage efficiency toward K48 polyubiquitin chains.

D85, an amino acid that is highly conserved among PRRSV strains [34], was revealed to be a key residue for PRRSV PLP2 DUB activity (Figure 4). Either a conserved (D85N) or non-conserved (D85R) substitution led to a significant destruction of PLP2 DUB activity (Figure 4). The mutational effect also appears specific, as similar mutations of the nearby residue D84 (D84N and D84R) that is also highly conserved did not have an effect (Figure 4). This result is also in accordance with the bioinformatics prediction (Figure 3). The mutational effect of other residues is contingent on the amino acids used for substitution. For example, the mutations D91R and T88R largely blocked the PLP2 activity and E90R partially blocked the DUB activity (Figure 4). We suspect that the mutational effect of D91R is most likely indirect and could result from electrostatic interaction with E90 to change the local structure. In a similar manner, the mutation T88R can potentially interact locally with E90, D91, or D85, leading to local conformational change of PLP2, which may have an adverse effect on PLP2 function. This also partially explains why T88S, E90Q, and D91E did not have an effect. Most interestingly, we found that the T88G mutation can selectively block the cis-cleavage activity (Figure 5C), without affecting the trans-cleavage activity (Figure 5A) and only partially blocking the DUB activity in either truncated (Figure 4B) or full-length form (Figure 8B). This is the first time to report a point mutation that distinguishes cis-cleavage from other activities and paves the way to test the importance of cis-cleavage activity in PRRSV infection.",

Surprisingly, we observed an intriguing relationship between PRRSV PLP2 DUB and cis-activity.

In contrast, none of these mutations had an effect on the PLP2 trans-activity cleaving nsp2-3 polyprotein (Figure 5A). Thus, it seems that the requirement for PRRSV PLP2 DUB activity is somehow more closely related to cis-activity, suggesting that they may share some intrinsic common mechanistic details in terms of recognition and cleavage of the substrates. To our knowledge, this is the first report revealing such intimate relationship between DUB and cis-activity concerning OTU cysteine proteases. The molecular basis for these observations is currently not clear, but hopefully, elucidation of the three-dimensional structure of PRRSV PLP2 may help resolve the puzzle in the future.",

            "text": "A long-asked question is whether the PLP2 DUB and cis-cleavage activities are essential for PRRSV infection. The inability to differentiate the enzymatic activities by point mutations has limited the evaluation of the contribution of individual enzymatic activities. Despite the reports of several studies on the PLP2 DUB activities [20,21,41,42], none of them established a strong correlation between DUB and viral replication, as they did not rule out the mutational effect on both trans- and cis-cleavage activities. By taking advantage of site-directed mutagenesis, we in the first place provided strong evidence to suggest that the PLP2 cis-activity is not necessary for viral replication (Figure 6). This is evidenced by the specific point mutation T88G, which selectively blocked the PLP2 cis-cleavage activity but allowed the successful rescue of viable virus. Moreover, this mutant exhibited similar growth rate to WT in primary PAMs (Figure 6). In contrast, the mutations (e.g., D85N, D85R, T88R, D91R, etc.) that largely disarmed the PLP2 DUB activity were lethal to PRRSV in MARC-145 cells. Although these mutations also crippled the cis-cleavage activity of PLP2 at the same time, the successful rescue of T88G mutant strongly argues against an essential contribution of inactive cis-activity to the non-viability phenotype. In addition, the lethal phenotype is less likely due to a potential defect of deISGylation activity of PLP2, as it has been reported that the HP-PRRSV strain JXwn06 PLP2 used in this study has very limited deISGylation activity [41] and that ISGylation was not observed in PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells [21], a cell line that was used for virus rescue. Thus, there appears to exist a strong correlation between the lethal phenotype of these mutations and the essential role of PLP2 DUB activity in PRRSV infection.",

They also mutated the residues in the acidic cluster, including the residues D458, D459, S462, D463, D465, etc., corresponding to the residues D84, D85, T88G and D91 in this study, respectively [20]. Consistent with our studies, the mutations D459A and D463A were lethal to PRRSV, whereas D458A, S462A, and D465A allowed the successful rescue of the viable virus [20]. In these studies, the mutant D458A did not affect the viral growth, whereas S462A and D465A crippled the virus in MARC-145 cells [20]. Sun et al. further correlated the growth property with the ability to inhibit NF-\u03baB activation and found that the mutations that were lethal to the virus were these capable of completely inhibiting NF-\u03baB activation, whereas the mutations S462A and D465A unable to inhibit the activation as WT lead to viable virus [20]. However, they did not further test the mutational effect of these mutants on cis- and trans-cleavage activity and the DUB activity. Our studies here suggest that the lethal phenotype is not linked to an impairment of cis- or trans-cleavage activity, but rather related to an effect on PLP2 DUB activity. However, because these are negative results, we could not rule out the possibility that the DUB-inactivating mutations may have other unexpected consequences on nsp2, or both, which renders the virus non-viable. On the other hand, the mutations E90R and D91N, which did not affect much the PLP2 DUB activity, did not allow the rescue of viable viruses. This result suggests that the mutations may have an adverse effect on other functions of nsp2, highlighting the complexity of mutational effect on the function of PLP2 or nsp2. Another interesting observation is that the partial ablation (T88G) of PLP2 DUB activity did not affect viral viability whereas a near-complete block (e.g., D85N, D85R, T88R, D91R, etc.) was lethal to the virus. These results may suggest that there exists a threshold of DUB activity required for PRRSV replication, in which the DUB activity may be required to remove polyubiquitins from substrates. Future study will be directed to investigate detailed mechanisms by which the PRRSV PLP2 plays during infection.",

            "text": "Infections by PRRSV often cause de-regulation of inflammatory cytokine production [49]. For the Chinese HP-PRRSV, it inhibits inflammation in early infection, but induces inflammatory storm during the late stage in pigs, contributing to lung injury and interstitial pneumonia [49,50]. The regulatory mechanisms of this process have remained poorly understood, but it is known that several nonstructural proteins, including nsp1\u03b1, nsp1\u03b2, nsp4, and nsp11, are capable of inhibiting inflammation response [51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58], whereas the structural proteins N and E promote inflammation [59,60]. PRRSV nsp2 is a type I interferon signaling antagonist [20] and recently implicated in the modulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine production during infection [20,35,36]. Liu et al. [36] reported that mutants of HP-PRRSV strain BB carrying deletion of nsp2 region aa. 323\u2013433 or aa. 628\u2013747 had the reduced ability to induce the expression of inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6 in PAMs. However, the corresponding mutants also exhibited reduced growth titer by 0.5 to 1 log when compared with the parental virus. Moreover, down-regulation is quite subtle (<30%). On the other hand, the single-site substitution represents a nice approach by which it can minimize the risk of gross conformational alteration as a result of mutagenesis. At the beginning of this study, we did not mean to study the role of nsp2 in inflammatory cytokine induction, but with two independent point-mutation mutants (T88G and E90Q) at hand, we unexpectedly established a strong link of nsp2 to PRRSV-induced induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Figure 7 and Figure 8). The mutants T88G and E90Q retained the similar growth rate to the parental virus JXwn06 in primary PAMs, but exhibited significantly reduced ability to induce TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 at both mRNA and protein levels (Figure 7 and Figure 8). Moreover, this reduction rate was by more than 70% at 24 hpi or later (Figure 8A), suggesting a decisive role of nsp2 in modulating the production of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 during infection. Different from the previous study [36], we did not observe a change in expression level of IL-6.",

            "text": "The crippled ability to induce TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 cannot be attributed to an impairment of PLP2 DUB activity, as the mutant nsp2 E90Q was fully DUB active (Figure 8B). In addition, because viral DUBs often negatively regulate host innate immunity, it is expected that inactivation of DUB activity should promote the inflammatory cytokine production as reported by several cases [12,15,16,19,61]. Our results, however, showed the opposite, the mutant T88G with partially crippled DUB activity showed reduced production of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 (Figure 7 and Figure 8). Thus, with two independent nsp2 mutants (T88G and E90Q) showing the similar phenotype, our results provide strong evidence to suggest a DUB-independent regulatory mechanism by PRRSV nsp2 in inducing TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 production. Together, our findings further deepen our understanding of the biological properties and function of PRRSV nsp2 and also provide clues into the pathogenic mechanisms of HP-PRRSV. Additionally, the results have implications in vaccine development by modifying nsp2 to reduce cytokine-induced lung injury. In the near future, it will be interesting to address molecular mechanisms of how the point mutations in nsp2 lead to crippled ability of PRRSV to induce pro-inflammatory cytokines.",
