            "text": "Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a new, emerging infectious disease that was first reported in 2012 and confirmed with human-to-human transmission in 2013 [1]. On 29 May 2015, the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) of China confirmed the first MERS case in China, an imported case from South Korean. MERS is caused by a coronavirus from the same family as the one that triggered China\u2019s deadly outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003. Previous cases have shown that medical students, especially the pre-clinical year medical students, are at high risk of newly emerging diseases, including SARS [2]. While doctors and nurses played a crucial role in the prevention, detection, and containment of SARS [3] most documented \u201csuper-spreading events\u201d of SARS occurred in hospitals. The underlying causes remain unclear [4], but it has been suggested that lack of systematic training in emerging infectious diseases could be the cause. A similar case was reported with swine flu [5] ",

Although courses regarding preventive medicine are provided to all students, there is no specific course that addresses new emergency infectious diseases. This is concerning because contact with newly emerging infectious diseases such as MERS, H7N9, andH1N1 is not rare in their practice. Chinese medical students\u2019 knowledge on emergency infectious diseases is low. For example, only 35.2% of medical students washed their hands before and 72.5% washed their hands after they physically examined patients in the wards in 2003 before SARS [6] A study from Saudi Arabia addressing the awareness of all procedures concerning prevention of and protection from MERSamong dental students suggested that more information needs to be provided by the authorities for the medical staff [7]. After the first case of MERS was found in China, we designed a study to assess the knowledge of a group of Chinese medical students regarding MERS.",

            "text": "Previous medical knowledge or background might have some impact on the understanding of the disease. The media released the updated information on it. Students from the Department of Management, compared to students in other majors, might be inclined to spend more hours watching TV (especially news programs) or browsing websites in order to follow up with hot social/political topics. The results also reflected the insufficient education on disease prevention and control in the medical school curriculum. The lack of related knowledge among the medical students raises a public concern since they should be prepared with knowledge to confront a potential epidemic and/or pandemic. Although MERS was a newly emergent infectious disease, which people were less familiar with, there are some common principles for dealing with it. The medical staff and public health agencies play a critical role in controlling new emergency infectious diseases. Therefore, it is crucial that healthcare professionals, as well as medical students, be provided with training in controlling infectious diseases [8]. Regarding the contents of the training, the National Health and Family Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China published the second edition of the MERS Prevention and Control Plan on 5 June 2015 [9]. In addition, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also have issued recommendations for the prevention and control of MERS infections in healthcare settings [7]. The prevention of MERS includes hand hygiene, wearing personal protective equipment, and patient placement [10]. In terms of general training, courses such as new emergency diseases, field epidemiology, and tropical medicine can be provided [11,12]. In terms of specific outbreaks, a special course to improve the students\u2019 knowledge of MERS can be provided.",

Firstly, lacking the information about students\u2019 sources and the accessibility/availability of MERS-related knowledge (e.g., TV/internet/newspaper, etc.), as well as the varying levels of exposure (e.g., media/news time/day) to media, could be a limitation that potentially affects the reliability of the results. For example, the difference of knowledge scores between students in different majors could be confounded by students\u2019 individual habits of accessing information from media. Second, we did not have a general population for comparison. A comparison group consisting of randomly sampled non-medical general population might be needed in the study design to better understand the findings.
