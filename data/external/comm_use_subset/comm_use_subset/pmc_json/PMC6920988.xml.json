            "text": "The Zika virus (ZIKV) was first isolated in 1947 when three owl monkeys from the Zika Forest, Uganda, were found to have a fever [1,2]. Even though the first human case was reported in 1952 and although this virus has been circulating in Asia and Africa, very few ZIKV cases were noticed and recorded before the 2015/2016 epidemic, since the symptoms were generally mild [1,3] and fatality was rare. In 2014, the first sign of an oncoming ZIKV epidemic appeared in French Polynesia with around 35,000 known cases of infection. This was followed by a full-blown epidemic in Latin and Central America in 2015/2016, with approximately 1.5 million estimated cases in Brazil alone [3,4]. With such a large number of infections, physicians were able to notice exceptionally large numbers of microcephaly cases among the babies of women who were infected by ZIKV during their pregnancies [1,3,5,6]. Microcephaly refers to a condition in which a baby is born with a smaller than usual brain and head. Further studies of ZIKV in laboratories using animal models confirmed the ability of ZIKV to penetrate both the placenta and the brain [7,8,9,10,11,12,13].",

Similarly to YFV and DENV, ZIKV is also spread by the mosquito, Aedes aegypti [2,6,14]. A flavivirus genome encodes a polyprotein that includes 10 proteins, three structural proteins (capsid (C), precursor membrane (PrM), and envelope (E) proteins), and seven nonstructural (NS) proteins (NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, NS4a, NS4b, and NS5) [14,15]. The immature virion contains an abundance of PrM protein, which is cleaved during maturation, and only M remains in a mature virion [16,17]. In a mature virion, the outermost shell contains E protein, which is followed by a shell containing M and C proteins. In an immature virion, however, both E and PrM are contained in the outer shell [16,17].",

            "text": "The results presented in this study pertain to the concept of protein intrinsic disorder, which is related to proteins or protein segments that have no ordered structure, but this lack of structure can be related to the function of these proteins [18,19,20,21]. Such proteins are often known by other names, such as \u201cnatively unfolded\u201d and \u201cintrinsically unstructured\u201d proteins [20,22]. The penetrance of disorder in the proteins from flaviviruses and ZIKV has already been analyzed [23,24,25]. The abundance and specific functionality of intrinsically disordered proteins in viral proteomes in general have been considered in several large-scale computational studies [26,27] and have been specifically analyzed for human papillomaviruses [28,29], different strains of the influenza virus [30], human immunodeficiency virus type -1 (HIV-1) [31], human hepatitis C virus [32,33], Dengue virus [34], respiratory syncytial virus [35], Chikungunya virus [36], and Alkhurma virus [37]. Furthermore, previous studies have found correlations between virulence and the shell disorder of DENV and flaviviruses, although the sets used in those studies did not include ZIKV proteins [2,14]. The shell proteins examined were M and C proteins, and the highly pathogenic YFV was found to contain the highest levels of shell disorder among the fairly large variety of flaviviruses looked at. Although ZIKV shell disorder has also been inspected in other studies, a comparative analysis between flaviviruses and ZIKV strains with respect to shell disorder and virulence has not been conducted as of yet. Intriguingly, while ZIKV is not known for its virulence [5], there are distinct disparities in the levels of potential to cause fetal morbidity between various ZIKV strains of different lineages [38,39]. However, no attempt has been made to correlate fetal morbidity and shell disorder until now. The research conducted in this paper demonstrates not only that ZIKV fits well within the previously observed correlations between flavivirus virulence and shell disorder, but that the uniqueness of the ZIKV shell disorder pattern is consistent with the varying levels of fetal morbidity caused by strains of different lineages.",

After downloading the sequences and respective protein data bank (PDB) files, the necessary information was imported into the database using tools implemented in JAVA [40]. The corresponding protein sequences in FASTA format were fed into the PONDR VLXT neural network (http://www.pondr.com). The results were given as scores from 0 to 1. Residues with scores of 0.5 and over represent disordered residues [41,42]. An important ratio used in this and previous studies is the percentage of intrinsic disorder (PID), which is defined as the number of residues predicted to be disordered in a protein chain divided by the total number of residues in the chain. The PID can range from 0% (perfectly ordered) to 100% (totally disordered).",

It has successfully been utilized to study the shell disorder of a large variety of viruses, including HIV, smallpox, and polio viruses [2,14,25,30,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52]. PONDR represents a suite of computational tools for sequence-only predictions of the intrinsic disorder predisposition of query in proteins. PONDR VLXT was the earliest predictor created at the end of the last century [41,42]. It involves the use of neural networks that are trained to recognize protein sequences that are ordered and those that are not [53]. Statistical methods, including regression analysis and analysis of variance (ANOVA), were used to analyze the PONDR VLXT results along with data on virulence and morbidity. The statistical package R version 3.6.0. [54] was used to obtain the results. Before obtaining the necessary results, the respective codes had to be written in R.",

ZIKV strains are generally categorized as of African or Asian lineage, and the epidemic that occurred in 2015\u20132016 involved Asian strains that had crossed the Pacific Ocean to reach the Americas. At least two laboratories have found that ZIKV strains of African lineage are more dangerous to fetuses than those of Asian lineage [38,55]. The classical isolate for the strains of African lineage is MR-766, which was discovered in Uganda in 1947 [1,56]. A PID-based wide selection of ZIKV strains and isolates allowed us to see that the strains can be divided into four groups that are consistent with their lineages but that are independent of the dates of the isolates (Figure 1A and Table 1). Interestingly, our results show that there are at least two MR-766 isolates from Uganda-1947 with distinct shell disorder features (Table 1). Furthermore, DENV-2 has also been shown to cause microcephaly in fetuses and newborns, but to a lesser extent when compared to ZIKV [38,39,55]. This has been observed in several laboratories using in vivo and in vitro methods. Chicken liver cells, human nerve cells, and mouse models were used, and the levels of destruction by ZIKV and DENV-2 were observed according to the amount of cells destroyed [38,39,55]. The PIDs of DENV-2 and ZIKV are compared in Figure 1 and Table 1.",

The matrix protein (the M protein in flaviviruses), on the other hand, is likely to play a somewhat different role. A more disordered matrix allows the virus to penetrate organs, namely vital organs, as in the case of HIV-1, but still be able to evade the host immune systems via matrix and surface glycoprotein motions [14,46,52].",

As with the PONDR VLXT plots in Figure 2, the disordered regions of both ZIKV and DENV-1 are restricted to segments near the N-termini. While we have seen that the M proteins of ZIKV and YFV are relatively disordered, the same cannot be said about Pr. The Pr proteins for YFV and ZIKV are quite ordered, as seen in Figure 4C\u2013E. The Pr disorder levels are relatively low for most flaviviruses [2,25], as seen in the cases of ZIKV, DENV, and WNV. With Pr being mostly ordered for most flaviviruses and M being the same for most flaviviruses (with the exception of YFV and ZIKV), one can conclude that both Pr and M contribute to the order of the PrM proteins for most flaviviruses, and this is especially important with respect to protecting the immature virion.",

Given these observations and the fact that similar proteins play similar roles even among nonrelated viruses, what do other viruses have to offer with respect to clues about trends in the correlation between virulence and shell disorder? While very few viruses have shown positive correlations with statistical significance between their virulence and membrane/matrix disorder (as the sole independent variable), HIV offers a unique insight into the role of the matrix (membrane) protein. Of the HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) family, the HIV-1 matrix has the greatest known PID [46,52]. HIV-1 and its closest sibling, SIVcpz, are the most pathogenic when compared to their other cousins and siblings, including HIV-2. HIV-1 patients are known to have much greater viral loads in their bloodstream than patients with HIV-2. Without the help of retroviral drugs, over 90% of HIV-1 patients would die within 10 years of the infection, whereas those infected with HIV-2 take a much longer time to succumb to the disease, if at all [46,63]. The roles of the matrix protein in virulence have to do with viral ability to evade the host immune system and also the ability to bind promiscuously to more host proteins [18,19,21,22]. An important characteristic of HIV is its ability to penetrate vital organs, including the brain, with ease [14]. Apparently, the promiscuous binding potential arising from the disordered matrix shell allows HIV to have easier access to specialized cells. We shall use this argument again in the cases of ZIKV and YFV, which have high PIDs for their M proteins (28.6 \u00b1 0.5% and 35 + 1%, respectively).",

Virulence arising from disorder in the inner shell involves a different strategy of immune evasion, which can be referred to as Trojan horse, since the virus attempts to replicate rapidly before the host immune system is able to recognize its presence [2,14]. It does so by using the disordered inner shell proteins that play important roles in the replication of the virus, where disorder assists the process by allowing for greater promiscuous (and therefore more efficient) binding of host proteins.",

The reason for this has to do with the fact that both shell layers play their roles in protecting the virion from environmental insults. If the outer layer is more disordered, the inner layer compensates by being more ordered. If, on the other hand, the outer layer is more ordered, the inner layer, depending on the type of environment the virus is exposed to, has the luxury of being less ordered.",

A closer look at the data in Figure 1B allows us to conclude that some flaviviruses do indeed have more ordered M proteins when their C proteins are disordered and vice versa. For example, tick-bone encephalitis virus (TBEV) viruses have higher PIDs in their C proteins than do DENV viruses, but they have lower PIDs for M proteins. Similarly, ZIKV has a low PID value for C but a high PID for M. There is also evidence of this trend within ZIKV strains themselves: we can notice a slightly lower M disorder in MR-766 strains (PID: 28 vs 29%, Table 1) despite their higher C PID values even as M PIDs remain relatively high for all ZIKV strains.",

Interestingly, the mean PID of its M protein (~35%) was also far higher than the corresponding values for all other flavivirus species found in our sample. It is likely that the highly disordered C protein allows for more rapid replication via its promiscuity in protein binding. As a result of the rapid replication, greater viral loads are more attainable, leading to greater virulence. A higher disorder in the M protein, however, allows the virus to more easily penetrate different organs, including vital organs such as the liver [2,15]. Apparently, YFV\u2019s extremely high pathogenicity, which reaches above a 50% CFR, arises from its unique ability to utilize disorder from both its M and C proteins to maintain a viral load as a means of evading the immune system.",

Inspection of the PONDR VLXT plot shows that the disordered regions lie in both the N- and C-termini even if the ZIKV C mutations arise entirely within the N-terminus (Figure 3). This provides clues to the evolution of ZIKV with respect to its ability to cause fetal morbidity in its hosts. It is likely that ZIKV had to evolve with the primate species that it most commonly infects. For certain primate hosts, it finds greater fitness when a greater viral load is necessary for it to infect a larger number of hosts because of the peculiarities found in the hosts\u2019 immune system: having a more disordered C protein does the trick. It is therefore likely that the different PIDs of C proteins from the various ZIKV strains and lineages are the result of the types of primates that the peculiar ZIKV strain primarily infects and its ability to fine-tune its C disorder to meet the optimal viral load necessary for more efficient transmission of the virus in a given host, as seen in the case of other viruses and other flaviviruses [2,14,25,39,49,50].",

Additionally, the C protein is trafficked to the nucleus through binding with importin [64]. Upon doing so, it interacts with histones to force the cell to stay longer in the G1 stage of the cell cycle so as to buy more time for viral replication [65]. In the cytoplasm, protein C binds to the Sec3 protein in order to inhibit Sec3 proteasomal antiviral activity [66].",

The other reason is that PrM prevents E from being so embedded in the host membrane that it cannot be removed in the later stages of the virion replication process.

The other is the somewhat large variation in the disorder of ZIKV depending on the strain and lineage of the virus. These oddities are consistent with what we now know as characteristics of ZIKV. Just as other viruses (such as WNV and HIV-1) that have high outer shell (matrix/membrane) PIDs are able to penetrate vital organs, ZIKV can also penetrate the placenta and brain [12]. Furthermore, scientists have discovered that strains of the African lineage possess a greater potential to cause fetal morbidity. This fact correlates with the variations in the disorder levels of the ZIKV C protein. Disorder in the inner shell has already been associated with virulence and higher viral loads in other flaviviruses and other unrelated viruses, such as in the Ebola and Nipah viruses.",

The results presented here could lead to the development of a new vaccine through the creation of attenuated strains resulting from more ordered C and M proteins. The regions for potential vaccine targets are disordered regions of the ZIKV M and C proteins that are ordered in other flavivirus species. Exploration of a ZIKV vaccine could include mutations in these areas. Other applications could include building a more comprehensive model that could anticipate the behaviors of new or little-known viruses. Lastly, the ability of ZIKV and YFV to penetrate vital organs as a result of shell disorder adds to a growing body of knowledge that encompasses a variety of viruses, such as HIV, that use such strategies to enter or to hide in hard-to-reach organs. An important potential application of this is in the field of cancer oncolysis, which involves the use of viruses to \u201cattack\u201d tumors, since both share the same pathways [68,69]. Viruses could be engineered to evade host immune systems that impede the effectiveness of therapeutic viruses. Moreover, since cancers in hard-to-reach organs such as the brain are often problematic for virotherapies and chemotherapies [14,70], a better understanding of the roles of shell disorder in the viral penetration of such organs will lead to improved therapies.",
