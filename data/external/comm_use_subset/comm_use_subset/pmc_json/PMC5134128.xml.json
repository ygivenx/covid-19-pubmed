A resolution was adopted to develop and strengthen efforts for its prevention and management. Sickle-cell anaemia, one of the most common forms of SCD, is due to a point mutation within the sixth codon of the \u03b2-globin chain. The produced abnormal variant \u2013 haemoglobin S (HbS) \u2013 is responsible for chronic haemolytic anaemia and vaso-occlusion which are the underlying causes of the clinical presentation of SCD. Individuals who express the homozygous form (HbSS) manifest the disease, while those with the heterozygous form (HbAS), also known as sickle-cell trait (SCT), are usually asymptomatic carriers.",

The \u03b2S-globin gene is found on five common haplotypes in Africa (Bantu, Benin, Cameroon and Senegal) and Asia (Saudi Arab-Indian) [2] that can be used as a marker of genetic diversity and population origin. Approximately 300,000 children with severe haemoglobin disorders are born every year worldwide [3] and over 75% of SCD occur in Africa where carrier frequency ranged from 1% (Central African Republic, Senegal) to 38% (United Republic of Tanzania) [1]. In Madagascar, several studies conducted in 1950s had estimated the general prevalence of SCD from 4% in the Central highlands [4] to 11-13% in the South-eastern coast [5]. Significant ethnical variation and high prevalence in asymptomatic carrier up to 28% were also reported [6]. To our knowledge, the last published study was done in the early 1980s [7]. These studies, however, were based on the detection of sickle red blood cells in hypoxic conditions, also known as \u201csickling test\u201d, and the sickle solubility test [3] now considered as obsolete techniques.",

The east coast has hot and humid subequatorial climate and an annual high cumulative rainfall of 4,000 mm per year. Transmission of malaria in this region is reported to be strong and intense all over time. A standardized questionnaire on socio-demographic and clinical data was fulfilled for each individual. The Ampasimanjeva community hospital is a Hospital District Centre receiving each year around 950 children between 2 and 5 years old.

Parechovirus infections are usually asymptomatic or lead to a mild gastro-intestinal or respiratory diseases. Only two patients had parechovirus detected, both presenting with symptoms of pneumoniae, suggesting that larger prospective study is required to better describe the real impact of parechovirus infection among SCD population. Conversely, RSV A or B belonging to the family Paramyxoviridae, was significantly associated with a high risk of infection in SCT patients compared to the normal population whereas no virus was detected in SCD patients. RSV A and B are a major cause of lower respiratory tract infection during infancy and childhood and were associated with acute chest syndrome similar in severity to influenza infection in febrile children with SCD [30]. The reason why RSV A and B were not detected in our study using a sensitive molecular tool is unknown but it may be linked either to the small number of identified SCD patients, or the possible death of those children.

            "text": "Detection of respiratory viruses has been facilitated by the recent widespread availability of nucleic acid amplification techniques. In a study carried out previously in Ampasimanjeva to describe the aetiology of a clinically defined cohort of children with fever and acute respiratory infections, the most representative pathogens were human metapneumovirus (hMPV) for pneumonia, human parainfluenzavirus (hPIV) for other acute lower respiratory infections, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) for flu-like illnesses and human adenovirus (HAdV) for upper respiratory tract infections [13]. However, the clinical significance of viral detection in biological samples from patients with respiratory infections remains often unclear. For example, when detected in a patient with severe pneumonia, respiratory viruses may represent subclinical infection, persistent shedding after a prior infection, infection restricted to the upper respiratory tract, or infection involving the lower respiratory tract [31\u201333]. While some pathogens, such as RSV, hMPV and FLU seem to be strict pathogens, other viruses such as HRV are widely identified in both cases and controls. It was beyond the scope of this study to evaluate the viral distribution in asymptomatic patients to study proportion of viral shedding in a control group, or to distinguish between upper and lower respiratory tract infections. Nevertheless, the same study conducted a year ago in the same population has confirmed our findings that a wide range of respiratory viruses might have played a role in escalating respiratory tract viral infections among patients with SCD and SCT.",

However, according to one recent publication [34], HbS seemed to be the most prevalent in Africa where over 700 haemoglobin variants were identified. Additionally, the association between sickle cell trait and malaria is not conclusive for the following reasons: the initial design was probably not optimal to detect this association in the current study, and more accurate methods for detecting HbS should have been used (i.e. hemoglobin electrophoresis). Further independent and well-structured research should be considered in that matter. A second limitation of this study is the absence of long-term follow-up to estimate the outcomes of children and the proportion and causes of death mainly among those living with SCD.",

This study has helped moving towards a better understanding of the epidemiology of SCD, and we hope it will trigger further research in that direction, for the following reasons. Firstly, as SCD is a major public health concern in Madagascar, a large prospective study on the general population to estimate the true magnitude of the disease should be done. Secondly, it is important to document data about the clinical course and mortality associated to SCD in regions where it is endemic. Thirdly, study involving increasing laboratory capacity should be conducted to help a better understanding of SCD epidemiology, as well as other hemoglobinopathies. Finally, conclusions from these studies will be used for awareness-raising among national authorities in order to strengthen the national control program.",
