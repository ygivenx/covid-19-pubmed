The University of Minnesota led this initiative starting in 2011, in collaboration with the American Association of Swine Veterinarians (AASV), the National Pork Board, and the Swine Health Information Center. Since then, the MSHMP has served as a means to capture the occurrence of infectious diseases for situations in which there is an absence of a regulatory framework [4]. At the time of writing of this manuscript, in December 2017, the program represented a considerable portion of breeding herds in the country (approximately 45%; [5]) and collected disease incidence data on a weekly basis.",

However, previous research conducted by our research group suggested that PRRS virus transmissibility as captured by the time-dependent reproduction number is incredibly region- and system-dependent [7], for reasons that could potentially include (but are not limited to) demographic and environmental factors [8, 9]. Even though the swine industry commonly reports PRRS as a seasonal disease, systematic disaggregation of data into regions and systems combined with formal and full assessment and comparison of seasonality PRRS patterns across different US regions has never been published in the peer-reviewed literature. One of the reasons for the lack of such information is that consistent collection of longitudinal disease data over time has been traditionally uncommon for the swine industry in North America. However, after years of data collection, the MSHMP database offered a unique opportunity for conducting, for the first time, temporal analysis such as the one described here.",

Our main hypothesis was that there was one yearly seasonal peak would be found for PRRS for all examined states and systems (winter season). Evaluating that hypothesis will help to understand the epidemiological dynamics of PRRS in the U.S. Ultimately, that information will help to design and implement surveillance and control programs for one of the most financially devastating diseases of swine in the country.",

In brief, the following steps were taken for construction of models: first, data were decomposed and plotted to visually assess the presence and characteristic of the trend and the seasonality, as well as the autocorrelation (ACF) and the partial autocorrelation (PACF) plots. Second, autoregressive moving average modelling was performed, including trend and seasonality terms as covariates. Here, the seasonality was represented by including trigonometric covariates (or Fourier terms). Seasonal cycles of one year and six, four and three months were tested by multivariate linear regression using the least square method [10]. The selection of the most appropriate model for each time series of the study was based on three criteria: assessment of the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), statistical significance of the parameters of the model at a reasonable significance level of 0.05, the Box-Pierce test, and the evaluation of the behaviour of the residuals checking its autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation function. For series in which the counts contained a considerable number of zeros, a generalized linear autoregressive moving average model with a Poisson structure was also attempted (\u2018glarma\u2019 R package; [13]), with model selection again being prioritized as described above.",

This stratification allowed for the comparison across different subpopulations of farms and identification of important differences in disease prevalence over time, which, prior to the study here, were believed to be homogeneous in the country. The main finding of this study was that PRRS seasonality varies according to geographical region, and the commonly referred \u201cPRRS season\u201d is not necessarily the only time of increase in disease incidence. Even though PRRS is anecdotally considered a seasonal disease, we showed that, for some regions among the U.S., there are other considerable peaks of disease during the year.",

Even though it has been reported that cold temperatures (winter season) and low relative humidity favor PRRS virus survival [14], some factors might help explain these off-winter incidence of PRRS cases. First, during summer months there is larger commingling of animal producers in state fairs or animal shows [15], which could facilitate disease transmission in the absence of adequate biosecurity practices [16, 17]. Second, lack of awareness of occurrence of other PRRS cases outside the neighborhood and system could contribute to a relaxed attitude towards some biosecurity measures during these months (e.g. less truck washing, drying and disinfecting events), allowing for virus spread [18]. Lastly, considering the volume of activities that occur in the current structure of the swine industry [19], it is not surprising that there are a lot of opportunities for the pathogens to spread via non-obvious manner such as through feed trucks, fomite and personnel, therefore; even though the virus might be easily transmitted during winter months, the amount of activity is enough for these sporadic events to occur in considerable amounts.",

The period during which this changing point occurred was between May 2013 and late March 2014, which, not surprisingly, coincides with the calendar year in which the U.S. had a porcine epidemic diarrhea outbreak [21, 22]. It has been previously reported that during 2013\u20132014, there were significantly fewer PRRS cases for reasons that are still hypothesized [22]. Due to the fact that an unpredictable event occurred in the population examined here, our data were not considered robust enough for division into testing and training and potential prediction. Such analysis may be, however, conducted in the future, when enough data would be gathered over the years.",

However, the most valuable animals in the value chain of the industry were included in the assessment, supporting the importance and impact of the findings. We also acknowledge misclassification bias is possible for the cases in which farms were not correctly classified by the veterinarian as positive shedding. This would be especially a problem for herds that have some kind of underlying immunity (e.g. vaccinated or live-inoculated herds). We realize that, the utilized scheme of classification does not fully detect farms that have low prevalence of animals that are shedding the virus. However, this was the best available method for classifying swine herds in regards to PRRS at the present time, and we the advantage relies on the fact that a standardized method was used throughout the study period, therefore; if this misclassification occurred, it would be consistent across farms, which we believe would dramatically change our conclusions.",
