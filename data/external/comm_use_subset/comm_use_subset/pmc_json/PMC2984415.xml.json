            "text": "West Nile virus (WNV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus that causes lethal encephalitis has emerged as a significant cause of viral encephalitis in the United States [1]. Since its introduction to North America in 1999, outbreaks of WNV fever and encephalitis have occurred in regions throughout the United States [1]. The fatality rate is approximately 10% for hospitalized encephalitic cases with increased risk in patients with compromised immune systems, older age and having underlying conditions such as diabetes mellitus [2]. Currently there are no therapeutic agents or vaccines approved for use against WNV infection in humans. Following peripheral infection, WNV replication is first thought to occur in skin Langerhans dendritic cells. These cells migrate to and seed draining lymph nodes, resulting in primary viremia [3]. By the end of the first week after infection, the virus is largely cleared from the peripheral organs, but in a subset of patients the virus enters the brain and causes a spectrum of neurological sequeale.",

Activation of glial cells (microglia and astrocytes) together with neuronal death are considered as key pathogenic features of WNV neuropathogenesis [6,7]. Neuronal death in WNV infection is a complex process and involves activation of caspase3/9 dependent apoptosis via both, extrinsic as well as the intrinsic pathways [8-10]. The mechanism(s) by which WNV induces neurological sequeale are not fully understood but it is proposed that apoptotic neuronal death can be a result of both, direct virus infection or bystander injury caused by cytotoxic factors released by non-neuronal cells [11].",

Cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 have been reported as potent inducers of neuronal injury in several neurodegenerative diseases such as cerebral ischemia, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis and viral infections including HIV-associated dementia (HID), JE and influenza [14,16,18,19].

            "text": "The response of WNV infection in the brain is characterized with massive inflammatory events including production of cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2, -6 and TNF-\u03b1, and chemokines [4,11,21,22]. Studies aimed at understanding the role of innate immune response in WNV-infected brain have so far largely focused on chemokines. The role of the chemokines such as MCP-5 (or CCL12), IP-10 (or CXCL10), MIG (or CXCL9) have been established in recruitment of virus-specific T-cells and virus clearance [21,23]. However the role of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 in neuropathogenesis following WNV infection remains obscure. Few studies have recently characterized the role of TNF-\u03b1 in WNV infection in a mouse model, but the data remain controversial [24-26]. Although microglia and astrocytes are classically believed to serve as the predominant source of these cytokines in the CNS, neurons can highly express these cytokines in the setting of disease, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), spinal cord injury, stroke, and sciatic nerve injury [27-29]. Since neurons are the prime target for WNV replication, it seems likely that they may act as a central processor of inflammation by releasing pro-inflammatory molecules. These pro-inflammatory molecules may further activate downstream apoptotic signaling pathway(s) in neurons ultimately resulting in neuronal death and/or activate glial cells, which can further exacerbate neuroinflammation. Herein, we directly evaluate the ability of WNV-infected neurons to produce key proinflammatory cytokines and their role in mediating neuroinflammatory markers and neuronal death.",

At day 1 after infection no significant increase was observed in the mRNA expression of any pro-inflammatory cytokines in both MOI-1 and -5 infected cells (Figure 2A). While IL-18 expression did not change at any time point (data not shown), a robust up-regulation was detected in the expressions of IL-1\u03b2, -6, -8, and TNF-\u03b1 at days 2 and 3 after infection with both MOI-1 and -5 of WNV, which coincided with increase in cell toxicity following WNV infection (Figure 1B). Moreover, in accordance with the cell toxicity data, induction in these cytokine expressions was more in MOI-5 as compared to MOI-1 infected cells. As depicted in Figure 2A, mRNA expressions of IL-1\u03b2, -6 and TNF-\u03b1 increased gradually from days 2 to 3 in both MOI-1- and -5-infected cells.

Neutralization of TNF-\u03b1 also significantly (p < 0.05) rescued WNV-induced cell death at day 2 after infection ( < 50% when compared to WNV-infected cells).

The specificity of neutralizing antibodies in protecting cell death was further confirmed using flow cytometry.

Figure 5B depicts sharp increase in the production of IL-1\u03b2, -8, -6, and TNF-\u03b1 within 24 h of treatment of na\u00efve HBCA cells with UV-inactivated supernatant from WNV-infected SK-N-SH cells when normalized with those treated with UV-inactivated supernatant from mock-infected SK-N-SH cells. We then analyzed the amount of these cytokines released in na\u00efve HBCA cells treated with UV-inactivated supernatant derived from SK-N-SH cells and compared it to the kinetics of cytokine production by HBCA cells directly infected with WNV (MOI-1). In accordance with the mRNA data, the release of IL-1\u03b2, -6, -8 and TNF-\u03b1 from HBCA cells treated with UV-inactivated supernatant derived from WNV-infected SK-N-SH cells was comparatively much higher than those treated with mock-infected SK-N-SH cells supernatant after 24 and 48 h as measured by ELISA (p < 0.05, Figure 6). It was interesting to note that all cytokines produced by WNV-infected HBCA cells were not significantly high at 24 hr after infection and a sharp increase occurred only at 48 h after infection, (Figure 6) which coincided with the peak in virus replication [31]. Furthermore, infection of astrocytes with only UV-inactivated WNV (MOI-1) did not induce the expression of aforementioned cytokines at any time point (Figure 6) thus ruling out the contribution of UV-inactivated WNV in inducing this effect on HBCA cells. These data collectively demonstrate that the supernatant derived from WNV-infected SK-N-SH cell line is capable of activating HBCA cells.",

            "text": "Increased production of cytokines in the brain is a common event observed during infection with neurotropic viruses such as herpesviruses, JC virus, retroviruses (HIV and HTLV-1), poliovirus, rabies virus and arboviruses (JE, St. Louis encephalitis) [12-14,16,40]. Inflammation in the brain is usually characterized by infiltration of immune cells, which along with glial cells are key contributors of these cytokines [13,41,42]. We and others have recently demonstrated in vitro increased production of cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) by WNV-infected astrocytes and microglia [11,22,31]. Since neurons are the prime target of WNV infection, we examined the ability of WNV-infected human neuroblatostoma cell line, SK-N-SH, in producing key cytokines. In this report for the first time we demonstrate that neurons also respond to WNV infection by up-regulating cytokines production. The sharp increase of key pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2, -6, -8 and TNF-\u03b1 at day 2 after infection as determined by qRT-PCR and ELISA is significant and coincides with peak virus replication in SK-N-SH cells suggesting that active virus replication in these cells is a main determinant of cytokines up-regulation (Figure 2). Neurons secrete several cytokines under various brain insults [43]. In the normal intact CNS, neurons are the only cell type known to produce low levels of TNF-\u03b1 [44,45]. IL-6 mRNA has been described within hippocampal and cerebellar neurons of the adult mammalian brain [46,47]. Treatment of neurons with S100B induces the expression of IL-1\u03b2 and -6 [41,48]. Neurons highly express cytokines such as IL-6, -1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1 in neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, spinal cord injury, stroke, and sciatic nerve injury [27-29,49]. In diseases like AD and JE, increased cytokine production by dying neurons is the main determinant of cytotoxicity [41,50,51]. It is important to note that in HIV, another neurotropic virus, which does not infect neurons, the main source of cytokine production are glial cells [14,16,52]. However unlike HIV, WNV infection of neurons is robust, therefore based on our data, it seems likely that they may be one of the main sources of cytokines in WNV-associated neuroinflammation. Though, our data does not rule out the possibility of cytokine production by glial cells and infiltrating immune cells in WNV-infected brain. Neurons have not been implicated as a source of IL-18 in various brain insults, therefore, no change in the expression of IL-18 (data not shown) is not surprising. Moreover, literature suggests glial cells as the main source of IL-18 upon various stimuli [53], including infection with JEV [16] and WNV (Verma et. al., unpublished data).",

            "text": "Cytokines and their respective receptors/ligands are crucial components comprising communication network in brain and immune system [18,54]. Considerable evidence indicates that when over produced, these cytokines mediate diverse range of neurodegenerative functions including disruption of the BBB, chemoattraction of peripheral immune cells and neuronal damage [35,41]. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 have been proposed as potent mediators of neuronal death in several neurodegenerative diseases like AD, traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, stroke, HIV and JE [12-14,16]. Based on our observation of direct correlation of cytokine production from WNV-infected SK-N-SH cells with cell toxicity (Figures 1 and 2), we next investigated the effect of these cytokines by using specific neutralizing antibodies against these cytokines. Protection of cell death as well as reduction of TUNEL positive cells in the presence of anti-IL-1\u03b2 and anti-TNF-\u03b1 strongly suggests that WNV-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines are one of the main factors driving cell death (Figures 3 and 4). Recent studies on JEV also support the role of TNF-\u03b1, where increased expression of TNF-\u03b1 receptor in neurons directly results in the initiation of death cascade via TRADD [51]. TNF-\u03b1 also contributes to neuronal death in brain ischemia [55,56]. Both TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 sensitizes neurons for tat-induced apoptosis in HAD [14]. Moreover, in vivo studies in animal models of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) have demonstrated that blocking of TNF-\u03b1 by neutralizing antibodies, or drugs, ameliorates the disease [57-59]. Central or peripheral administration of IL-1\u03b2 dramatically increases neuronal death following acute brain injury [60,61]. Studies also support that IL-1\u03b2 is the key mediator of caspase-1-dependent apoptosis of neurons [62]. IL-1\u03b2 has been demonstrated to cause bystander damage to JEV-infected neurons [16]. Therapeutic blockade of IL-1 receptors also conferred significant protection in a murine model of fatal alphavirus encephalomyelitis [63]. Our results demonstrating no significant change in SK-N-SH cell death in presence of neutralizing antibodies to IL-6 and -8 was not surprising, as these cytokines are not involved in inducing cytotoxicity [42]. Moreover, production of IL-6 is under the control of IL-1\u03b2 and its pathogenic roles include induction of other cytokines and chemokines [18]. Our data has inherent limitation wherein we are unable to pinpoint that infected and/or uninfected SK-N-SH cells were protected from cell death.",

Signals of astrocyte activation that includes pro-inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide may result from infected or injured glial, infiltrating immune, and/or endothelial cells or from injured neurons per se [13,42]. WNV-induced increased production of cytokines [11,22] (Verma et. al., unpublished data) and MMPs have been demonstrated in astrocytes [31]. Activation of glial cells has been demonstrated in WNV-infected brain [6,7,64]. However, since the infection of astrocytes by WNV in vitro is limited [22,31] and has so far not been convincingly demonstrated in vivo [11,64-66], the trigger of glial cells activation might be produced by non-glial cells. Therefore we hypothesized that cytokines released from infected neurons might be one of the initiator of glial cells activation.",

Since supernatant from WNV-infected SK-N-SH cell line was UV-inactivated and UV-inactivated WNV does not induce the expression of any cytokines upon infection (Figure 6) suggests that activation of astrocytes is mediated by SK-N-SH cells-derived inflammatory mediators only and is not the effect of WNV present in UV-inactivated supernatant. In addition, when the kinetics of cytokine production by astrocytes treated with UV-inactivated infected supernatant derived from SK-N-SH cell line was compared with cytokine profile produced by direct infection of astrocytes with WNV, we observed that direct WNV infection induced cytokines only at 48 h after infection. This could be explained by the fact that WNV infection in astrocytes peaks at day 2 and coincides with cytokine production [31]. Whereas, in astrocytes treated with UV-inactivated infected supernatant from SK-N-SH cells cytokines were produced at early time point, 24 h after treatment, and fold-change of cytokine gene expressions was also significantly higher. This fold-change of cytokine gene expression decreased at 48 h after treatment which may be due to the short half-life of cytokines in UV-inactivated infected supernatant [69,70]. The cytokines and chemokines released from injured neurons have been shown to activate non-neuronal CNS resident cells [41,51,71-73]. Based on our data, we cannot pinpoint the specific neurotoxic mediator derived from infected neurons contributing to astrocytes activation. However, available literature suggests that several factors including IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 are capable of glial cells activation [41,43,74].",

            "text": "The subsequent consequence of astrocyte activation and downstream cascade of inflammatory cytokine production is the secondary wave of inflammation resulting in the death of neurons. Activation of glial cells is a key pathogenic feature of WNV-associated meningoencephalitis [6,7]. Neurotoxic molecules from WNV-infected astrocytes have been demonstrated to induce indirect toxicity in un-infected neurons in vitro [11]. Our recent data demonstrating the disruption of tight junctions of the BBB by MMPs released from WNV-infected astrocytes further confirms the role of astrocytes in WNV pathogenesis [31]. These data signify the importance of astrocyte activation in WNV neuropathogenesis. Similarly, a model proposed by Swarup and colleagues, also argues that neuronal apoptosis and subsequent microglia activation in JEV infection results in bystander injury of un-infected neurons [51]. Further, blocking the downstream effects of TNF-\u03b1 in JEV infection resulted in abrogation of direct neuronal death as well as bystander death mediated by activated microglia [51]. Based on these reports and data reported in this study, we suggest that in WNV infection also, neurons-mediated activation of astrocytes may result in several downstream pathological events such as bystander death of neurons, increased expression of cell adhesion molecules, chemotaxis of activated as well as infected peripheral immune cells and disruption of the BBB.",

Considerable efforts are currently directed on targeting pro-inflammatory cytokines as novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases [19,43]. In vitro as well as in vivo studies have established that attenuating the cytokine production in brain directly correlates to improved disease outcome in virus infection [14,16,51,52] and in neurological disease models such as EAE and multiple sclerosis (MS) [13,17]. Broad spectrum and specific anti-inflammatory drugs such as IL-1ra and TACE-inhibitors are recommended as adjunct therapy to control disease progression of various neurodegenerative diseases such as stroke, cerebral ischemia, traumatic brain injury and MS [17,19]. Currently there is no WNV vaccine for humans and once the virus enters the brain, nothing much can be done. Therefore, the significance of our studies lies in delineating specific cell types and downstream pathways associated with cytokine production in WNV-infected brain, and lay a framework for future in vivo studies using mouse model to test the ability of anti-IL and TNF drugs to improve WNV disease outcome.",

(A) FACS analysis of GFAP expression in na\u00efve HBCA cells treated with UV-inactivated supernatant derived from mock- and WNV (MOI-1)-infected SK-N-SH cells at 48 h after treatment is shown as overlapped histograms with the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) in arbitrary units at the right. The MFI of GFAP increased significantly in HBCA cells treated with UV-inactivated supernatant from infected SK-N-SH cells (*p < 0.05). Data are representative of three independent experiments. (B) cDNA templates synthesized from RNA extracted from HBCA cells at 6, 24 and 48 h after treatment with UV-inactivated supernatant from SK-N-SH cells were used to determine the fold-change of IL-1\u03b2, -6, -8, and TNF-\u03b1 by qRT-PCR. Changes in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were first normalized to the GAPDH gene and then the fold-change in infected supernatant treated cells as compared to corresponding controls was calculated.

Na\u00efve HBCA cells were either mock-treated or infected with UV-inactivated WNV or WNV at MOI-1 or treated with UV-inactivated supernatant derived from mock- and WNV (MOI-1)-infected SK-N-SH cells, and levels of IL-1\u03b2, -6, -8, and TNF-\u03b1 in treated or infected HBCA culture supernatants were determined by ELISA. Supernatant derived from UV-inactivated mock- and WNV-infected SK-N-SH cells significantly increased the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines within 24 h after treatment. While WNV infection per se increased the production of these cytokines only after 48 h. Furthermore, infection of astrocytes with only UV-inactivated WNV did not induce the expression of aforementioned cytokines at any time point. The data expressed are the mean concentration (pg/ml) \u00b1 SD of the amount of IL-1\u03b2, -6, -8 or TNF-\u03b1, secreted in the supernatant and is representative of three independent experiments. *p < 0.05. **p < 0.001.",
