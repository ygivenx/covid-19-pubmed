This pilgrimage attracts millions of worshippers for Umrah and about two to three million people from various countries across the globe converge for the yearly Hajj rituals [1].

The majority of pilgrims develop one form of respiratory tract infection or another during their stay in Makkah and Madinah [4]. Various adverse conditions like overcrowding, extreme climatic condition, pollution, shared accommodation characterize these pilgrimages. Similarly, most of the pilgrims are older people (>50 years) with comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and liver diseases [5,6]. These scenarios could increase the risk of spread and transmission of infections, particularly respiratory tract infections (RTIs) [7]. Respiratory pathogens and symptoms are high among Malaysian Hajj pilgrims and range from 58.9% to 94.3% [8,9,10].",

The gap in knowledge, as well as the poor attitudes and bad practices in relation to disease prevention and control, contribute to the increased risk of infection and negative impacts during mass gatherings [13]. The assessment of pilgrims KAP towards respiratory tract infections and their preparedness have received considerable attention from many researchers from different countries across the globe [14,15,16,17,18]. To ensure effective preventive practice and optimum preparedness regarding respiratory tract infection prevention during Hajj and Umrah, data on pilgrims\u2019 knowledge, attitude, and preventive practices (KAP) are required. This information would be significant in providing the needed strategies to be implemented. Moreover, these would enhance and evaluate the presently available programs as well as recognize possible interventions to improve the behavioral and attitudinal changes. Positive attitude and behavioral changes are driven by the level of knowledge and perceptions towards preventive practices [19]. However, there is no study conducted in Malaysia to assess the KAP of both Umrah and Hajj pilgrims. Therefore, this study is aimed to evaluate knowledge, attitude and practice regarding the prevention of respiratory tract infection and to explore the relationship between the demographic variables and knowledge, attitude and practice scores among 2018 Malaysian Hajj and Umrah pilgrims.",

The questionnaire was initially drafted in English language and then underwent the \u201cforward-backward-forward\u201d translation from English into Malay and then to English again by another translator all from the School of Languages Literacies and Translation, Health Campus Universiti Sains Malaysia. A bilingual expert did the translation aimed to maintain the content meaning over a word for word literal translation. Back translation to the original language version (English) was done without access to the initial English version questionnaires. The questionnaire was then assessed for equivalency to the original version and the back-translated version and ascertained it to be satisfactory by a panel of experts. No significant modifications were identified, showing that the scale was adequate to maintain its meaning and purposes. It also collected participants\u2019 demographics including age, gender, occupation, marital status, educational qualifications, as well as comorbidities and signs and symptoms of influenza-like illness prior to departure to Hajj or Umrah. The difficulty discrimination index of the knowledge domain comprising of six sub-domains ranged from \u22121.26 to 6.29, while the factor loading of the attitude domain which consisted of two sub-domains ranged from 0.414 to 0.791. The practice domain also consisted of two sub-domains and had factor loading range from 0.315 to 0.917. The questionnaire was piloted among 50 pilgrims before Hajj and validated. Results of the reliability test carried out showed Cronbach\u2019s coefficient alpha for knowledge, attitude, and practice was 0.777, 0.709, and 0.729 respectively. The newly developed questionnaire had 79 items divided into five sections: Socio-demographic, knowledge, attitude, and practice sections. The knowledge section consisted of 29 items and was aimed at accessing and evaluating the general knowledge of pilgrims about the etiology, spread, and transmission, signs and symptoms, complications, risk factors and prevention of respiratory tract infections. In the attitude section, 13 questions were used to assess behavioral perception towards prevention of respiratory tract infections. Twelve questions on practices were used to evaluate the actual compliance and uptake of various preventive measures.",

Only 20.0% of the participant believed that viruses do not cause RTI. A good percentage of respondents had good knowledge about the transmission of RTI. These results are in line with the findings from Tashani et al. [18], where 58% of the pilgrims reported correct means of transmission. Contrary to the findings in this study about knowledge of RTIs, several studies reported a low level of knowledge about respiratory tract infections [15,16]. The responses based on the transmission of RTIs through water is 39.1%, by sharing towels with an infected person is 51.6% and through the air is 85.3%. In addition, the high percentage related to knowledge demonstrates the consistency of theory-based approaches in changing human behavior through the information that is based on personal beliefs that could motivate or discourage behavior change towards better health [28]. Based on the data gathered from the questions on the risk of RTI infection, 43.1%, 65.3%, and 28.9% of pilgrims were unaware of smokers, diabetic patients, and those in crowded places, respectively, being at risk of contracting the infection. This is very crucial as these pilgrims are at risk and the tendency to get RTIs could be high if the participants have any comorbidity.",
