In response, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended enhanced influenza surveillance guidelines and implementation of surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) in member countries [9, 10]. The Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS) has conducted statewide influenza surveillance since 1997. Surveillance activities include monitoring influenza-like illness (ILI) among ambulatory patients, tracking laboratory-confirmed cases, monitoring ILI in sentinel schools, and testing and subtyping influenza viruses in specimens submitted to the Arizona State Public Health Laboratory. In 2010, in response to the WHO guidance, ADHS began conducting sentinel surveillance for SARI as part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Border Infectious Disease Surveillance program (BIDS) with the aim of describing the patterns of severe disease in a highly fluid border region. SARI surveillance was established in Pima County, Arizona along the U.S.-Mexico Border, and aimed to complement existing statewide influenza surveillance activities. Previous estimates of mortality among SARI patients in this population have been limited to in-hospital mortality, thus, deaths that occurred after hospital discharge were not captured [11]. The main objective of this analysis was to quantify mortality among adult patients hospitalized with SARI by capturing deaths occurring both in hospital and shortly after hospital discharge, and to identify potential risk factors for mortality.",

Selection of study sites has been described in detail elsewhere [11]. In brief, the ADHS, BIDS program identified hospitals in the four Arizona counties (Cochise, Pima, Santa Cruz, and Yuma) that border Mexico and receive mobile, foreign born and migrant populations. There were 11 acute care hospitals within this area; surveillance was initiated at five hospitals in 2010. Two of the participating hospitals had fewer than five participants in the first season, leaving three in the surveillance system. One of the three sentinel surveillance sites did not have data from electronic records accessible; therefore, only two sites were included in this mortality analysis. This analysis was limited to SARI patients who presented to the inpatient ward of St. Mary\u2019s Hospital or St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital in Pima County, Arizona. These two large acute care sites transfer pediatric cases to other regional hospitals; therefore, only adults \u226518 years were included in this analysis. For this analysis, we defined each influenza season as beginning in week 40 and ending in week 39 of the consecutive year.",

In brief, clinical teams at each surveillance site were trained on the SARI case definition (Additional file 1: Table S1) and surveillance procedures. Patients who presented at the emergency ward who were identified by the clinical team as meeting the SARI case definition were asked for verbal consent to participate. Data for enrolled patients were collected using a standardized case report form. Data collected included age, sex, race/ethnicity, residence, symptom onset date, admission date, existing underlying medical conditions, clinical suspicion of pneumonia (yes/no), chest radiograph findings (new abnormality, normal or not done), laboratory results (e.g., blood culture), and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Due to infrequent ordering of bacterial cultures and recording of chest radiograph findings on case report forms, these variables were not included in the analysis. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from each SARI patient within 24 h of admission and tested for viral respiratory pathogens. Testing was performed using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the ResPlex II assay (v. 2.0) (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) from 2010 to 2012 and the GenMark Respiratory Viral Panel assay from 2013 to 2014 (GenMark Diagnostics Inc., Carlsbad, CA, United States) [12, 13].

In hospitalized patients with pneumonia, a comparable condition to SARI, one study found that deaths within 30 days of admission were generally directly related to pneumonia, whereas deaths beyond 30 days were unrelated to pneumonia [15]. Additionally, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services reported all-cause 30-day post admission mortality for patients with a principal diagnosis of pneumonia [16]. Therefore, we selected the 30-day post admission timeframe to capture SARI-related deaths while allowing our findings to be comparable with other research studies. Potential predictors examined in bivariate analysis included age, sex, race/ethnicity, length of hospital stay, time from symptom onset to hospital admission, ICU admission, presence of comorbidities (\u2265 1, \u2265 2 and \u2265 3 comorbidities), individual comorbidities (hypertension, cardiac disease, lung disease, obesity, immunodeficiency and neurologic disorder), and the presence of individual viral pathogens (influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, coronaviruses, HMPV, RSV and rhinoviruses). Race/ethnicity was defined as a categorical variable with multiple levels. All other variables were defined as the presence or absence of the attribute. Independent predictors of mortality identified with a significance of p < 0.1 in bivariate analysis were included in the multivariate models. Non-significant factors in multivariate models were dropped using stepwise backward selection.",

Among adults \u2265 65 years hospitalized with CAP, previous studies have shown that nearly half of those who died did so after discharge [22]. Among Canadian adults hospitalized with CAP, Johnstone et al. reported a mortality of 12% at 30-days and 28% at one year follow-up [23]. A known limitation of the Arizona SARI surveillance program was that only in-hospital deaths were captured, and deaths occurring in patients discharged to hospices, nursing homes or private residences were not included. By using vital records, seven additional deaths occurring between hospital discharge and 30-days post admission were captured, supporting claims that mortality estimates for SARI were previously underestimated in Southern Arizona [11]. Although there is no gold standard for attributing cause of death to SARI, mortality studies that use vital records and administrative data to capture in-hospital and post discharge mortality may provide guidance for a more accurate way to estimate the proportion of deaths attributable to SARI. While hospital discharge practices vary globally, cross-country comparison of mortality studies may benefit from use of a 30-day post admission timeframe.",

Of 1790 adult and adolescent SARI patients in China, age \u2265 65 years was a significant risk factor for severe SARI outcomes (ICU admission or death) [21]. Among SARI patients aged \u2265 5 years in a South African population with high-HIV-prevalence, Cohen et al. found that ICU admission was a significant risk factor in bivariate analysis while increasing age was an independent risk factor in multivariate analysis [20]. As with previous studies assessing the effect of ICU admission on patient outcome, it is important to consider that our findings are likely subject to confounding by indication. This type of bias arises because patients with more severe illness are more likely to be admitted to the ICU, and more likely to die. Although we expected higher mortality given the 37% ICU admission in our analysis, one study of U.S. Medicare beneficiaries found lower 30-day mortality among patients with discretionary admission to the ICU after adjusting for distance to hospitals with high ICU admission rates for pneumonia [25].",

Second, the geographic location of the surveillance program in the border region allowed for enrollment of a larger proportion of minority populations such as Hispanics and Native Americans, which may provide a better understanding of the burden of SARI in these populations. Lastly, this analysis benefited from the standardized data collection methods of SARI surveillance in conjunction with electronically available state death certificate data. The result was a surveillance database with a high level of detail on risk factors, clinical diagnoses and outcomes for each patient, but particularly for patients who died and had death certificate data.",

First, the exclusion of patients from one sentinel hospital contributed to the relatively small sample size which may have limited the ability to detect potential risk factors of mortality, such as cardiovascular, renal, and neurological disease which have been shown by others to contribute to poor survival of patients with influenza and pneumonia in this population [28]. Second, exclusion of bacterial culture results and admitting chest x-ray findings prevented assessment of factors such as chest x-ray abnormalities and bacterial co-infections as risk factors for mortality. Third, the SARI patients included in this analysis may not be representative of the population of Southern Arizona where an estimated 22 million people crossed the northbound Arizona border in 2014 alone [11, 29]. Since sentinel sites in closer proximity to the U.S.-Mexico border were not included, the results of this analysis may not represent the burden of disease in the highly mobile border population. By limiting surveillance to large referral hospitals, we suspect there may be bias for certain risk groups, such as adults \u2265 65 years old, and more severe cases presenting later in the course of illness. The high frequency of ICU admission in our patients supports this hypothesis. Additionally, the sentinel sites used for this analysis are not major providers of pediatric care in Southern Arizona so a similar pediatric SARI mortality estimate remains unavailable in this population. Lastly, the linkage of death certificate data to SARI patients could have been more thorough had we searched death registries in nearby states and used unique identifiers such as social security number, had they been available.",
