Influenza viruses cause oxidative stress and acute respiratory inflammation \n[3,4]. Recent studies have focused on the role of lung antioxidant defense systems against injury induced by this virus because they likely play a role in virus-associated inflammation, viral susceptibility and immune clearance \n[5,6]. It has been shown that antioxidant compounds inhibit influenza virus replication and diminish the release of inflammatory and apoptotic mediators during virus infection \n[7]. Moreover, the combination of antioxidants with antiviral drugs synergistically reduces the lethal effects of influenza virus infections. This suggests that agents with antiviral and antioxidant activities could be a strategy for the treatment of patients with severe influenza-associated complications \n[8].",

The activation of the majority of antioxidant and defense genes are regulated by Nrf2 through binding to antioxidant response elements (AREs) \n[6]. It has been recently reported that the antioxidant pathway controlled by Nrf2 is pivotal for protection against the development of influenza virus-induced pulmonary inflammation and lung injury in mice in vivo under oxidative conditions \n[6]. Nrf2 also plays a key role in host defense against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in vivo[14], and RSV infection induces down-regulation of airway antioxidant systems in mice \n[15]. Moreover, Cho et al. reported that Nrf2 has antiviral activity in murine models of RSV \n[14], and Nrf2 activation by epigallocatechin gallate decreased viral replication in response to influenza A/Bangkok/1/79 infection in human nasal epithelial cells \n[5]. These results suggest that attenuation of oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis may lessen influenza virus-induced lung injury and exacerbation of existing respiratory diseases.",

Alveolar type I (ATI) cells are large flat cells that cover ~ 95% of the alveolar surface and through which gas exchange takes place. ATII cells make and secrete pulmonary surfactant, and they proliferate to restore the epithelium after damage to the more sensitive ATI cells \n[20]. Human ATI cells have not been isolated and cultured. We chose to use ATI-like cells, which are type II cells cultured to transdifferentiate into a ATI cell phenotype in vitro[20-22]. We analyzed clearance of PR8 virus-induced apoptotic cells by human primary AM and ATII cells. Furthermore, to improve our knowledge on pathways involved in lessening the cellular injury associated with influenza infection, we focused on the role of Nrf2 in human primary alveolar epithelial cells infected with IAV. This is the first study on the effect of IAV on ATI-like cells and to our knowledge there is no study of the role of Nrf2 in influenza A virus infection in cells obtained from children. Our hypothesis is that Nrf2 protects alveolar cells against injury induced by PR8 virus by activation of antioxidant defense genes and decreasing oxidative stress and viral replication. To test this hypothesis we used adenovirus Nrf2 (AdNrf2) and Nrf2 siRNA strategies to study the effect of Nrf2 overexpression and knockdown, respectively in these cells infected by PR8 virus.",

We found significantly lower levels of GSH after cell tranfection with Nrf2 siRNA followed by infection with PR8 virus (Figure \n10, Panel II). Moreover, AdNrf2 increased GSH levels, which protected cells against injury by IAV. These results indicate that the protective role of Nrf2 against cell injury induced by PR8 virus is in part by increasing glutathione levels.",

We observed that PR8 virus induced oxidative stress, cell injury, apoptosis, and proinflammatory cytokine secretion in ATI-like cells and ATII cells. In order to protect cells from injury induced by the PR8 virus, host cells must activate some defense against oxidative stress. Nrf2 is critical factor and can activate antioxidant response genes. Ours is a novel approach in that first, we studied the response of ATI-like cells infected with IAV, second, compared the effect of PR8 virus on ATI-like cells, ATII cells and AM obtained from the same donors and third, to our knowledge this is the first report on the role of Nrf2 in alveolar cells infected with influenza A virus.",

We confirmed our hypotheses and demonstrated the protective role of Nrf2 against PR8 virus infection. To our knowledge there are only two reports on the role of Nrf2 and influenza virus. These studies were performed in human nasal epithelial cells in vitro[5] and in mice in vivo[6]. Cigarette smoke-exposed Nrf2-/- mice showed higher rates of mortality than did wild-type mice after IAV infection, with higher peribronchial inflammation, lung permeability damage, and mucus hypersecretion. It has been recently reported that supplementation with the potent Nrf2 activator epigallocatechin gallate significantly decreased influenza A/Bangkok/1/79 virus entry and replication in nasal epithelial cells \n[5]. The suppressive effect of this compound on viral replication was abolished in cells with knocked down Nrf2 expression. This suggests a relationship between induction of the Nrf2 pathway and the ability to protect against viral infection. Our results are in agreement with these findings. We found Nrf2 translocated to the nucleus in ATI-like cells, ATII cells and AM infected with PR8 virus. We also showed significant induction of Nrf2 and downstream HO-1. This suggests activation of the Nrf2 pathway in response to IAV infection. We also observed the protective effect of Nrf2 against IAV in human alveolar cells. We found that Nrf2 overexpression using AdNrf2 decreased IAV replication, influenza A nucleoprotein expression, antiviral gene expression, ROS generation and oxidative stress in comparison with PR8 virus alone. Furthermore, AdNrf2 also increased GSH level in ATI-like and ATII cells, which protected against injury by PR8 virus. Shih et al. \n[27] also observed higher intracellular GSH levels in neurons infected with AdNrf2, which protected against oxidative stress and GSH has been reported to be an inhibitor of IAV infection \n[38]. Moreover, we found that Nrf2 knockdown followed by infection with PR8 virus decreased cell viability, increased ROS generation and decreased GSH levels. Kesic et al. \n[5] observed that epigallocatechin gallate increased expression of antiviral genes RIG-1, IFN-\u03b2 and Mx1. However, these authors suggested that their expression can be Nrf2-independent or that the effects are species and/or cell-type specific. We found that AdNrf2 did not induce mRNA levels of the antiviral genes Mx1 and OAS1. Our results can be explained by a different strategy to overexpress Nrf2 and/or the cell type studied. Moreover, to our knowledge, essential Nrf2 binding sites have not been identified in promoters of any of these genes \n[5]. Our results are also in agreement with studies of gene expression profiling Nrf2 in mice showing that there are no differences in the antiviral or interferon responsive genes \n[5,39,40]. Our results suggest that the activation of antioxidant and cytoprotective mechanisms orchestrated by Nrf2 (e.g., HO-1 activation) are responsible for cell protection against IAV. To our knowledge, this is the first observation on the antiviral role of Nrf2 in human alveolar epithelial cells.",

Floating murine primary apoptotic macrophages were observed after treatment with PR8 virus \n[46]. Furthermore, Eckardt-Michel et al. \n[47] found that the fusion protein of RSV also induced floating cells that have characteristics of the apoptotic DNA ladder, which suggests that they are extruded from the monolayer before late apoptotic events became apparent. In our studies these floating viral infected apoptotic cells were ingested by AM but not by ATII cells. These results suggest that inflammatory macrophages not the resident epithelial cells are likely responsible for clearing IAV-induced apoptotic cells. This is different from the involutional mammary gland where the epithelium itself is responsible for clearing the apoptotic epithelial cells \n[10,11].",
