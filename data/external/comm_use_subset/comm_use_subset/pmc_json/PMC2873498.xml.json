Therefore, new innovative therapies are urgently required in order to combat the high mortality and morbidity associated with cancers. Antigen-specific immunotherapy has emerged as an attractive approach for the treatment of cancers since it has the ability to specifically eradicate systemic tumors and control metastases without damaging normal cells. For example, in a recent study, immunotherapy using synthetic long peptide vaccine derived from human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) E6 and E7 antigens has led to significant clinical responses in patients with precancerous lesions of gynecological malignancies [1].",

Previously, we have studied the linkage of calreticulin (CRT), a Ca2+-binding protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (for review, see [6]) to several antigens, including human papillomavirus type-16 (HPV-16) E7 [7,8], E6 [9], and nucleocapsid protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [10]. Intradermal administration of DNA encoding CRT linked to any of these target antigens led to a significant increase in the antigen-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses and impressive antitumor effects in vaccinated mice. Thus, CRT has been shown to be highly potent in enhancing the antigen-specific immune responses and antitumor effects generated by DNA vaccination in several preclinical models.",

The exact mechanism of action in which imiquimod and its analogs activate the immune system is still under active investigation. Nevertheless, it is known that imiquimod activates immune cells through the toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), commonly involved in pathogen recognition, on the cell surface [13,14]. Cells activated by imiquimod via TLR-7 secrete cytokines such as IFN-\u03b1, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 [15]. There is evidence that imiquimod, when applied to skin, can lead to the activation of Langerhans cells, which subsequently migrates to local lymph nodes to activate the adaptive immune system [16]. Other cell types activated by imiquimod include NK cells, macrophages and B-lymphocytes [16].",

We observed that treatment with CRT/E7 DNA in combination with imiquimod leads to decrease in the number of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) but not T regulatory cells in the tumor microenvironment of tumor-bearing mice. Treatment with CRT/E7 DNA in combination with imiquimod was also found to lead to an enhancement in the E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses in tumor-bearing mice. Furthermore, treatment with CRT/E7 DNA in combination with imiquimod leads to significantly improved antitumor effects and prolonged survival in treated mice. In addition, treatment with imiquimod led to increased number of NK1.1+ cells and F4/80+ cells in the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, macrophages and NK1.1+ cells were found to play an important role in the antitumor effects mediated by treatment with CRT/E7 DNA in combination with imiquimod. The clinical implications of the current study are discussed.",

In comparison, there was no significant difference in the number of CD4+CD25+ T cells in mice treated with CRT/E7 DNA in combination with imiquimod compared to any of the other groups.

Tumor-bearing mice treated with imiquimod also showed a significant increase in the number of F4/80+ macrophages in the tumor microenvironment (Figure 4). Taken together, these data suggest that the combination of CRT/E7 DNA vaccination with imiquimod treatment may result in an increase in M1 macrophages in the tumor, which can contribute to the antitumor effect (for reviews see [21,22]) It has been shown that TC-1 tumors contain significant number of M2 macrophages, that lead to suppression of antitumor T-cell response, thus facilitating tumor growth [23]. Thus, treatment of TC-1 tumors with imiquimod and the CRT/E7 DNA vaccine may result in a switch from immunosuppressive M2 macrophage phenotype to the inflammatory M1 phenotype.",

NK cells have been shown to express TLR7 and imiquimod-mediated activation of NK cells through TLR7 may result in IFN-\u03b3 production [24]. Thus, it is likely that not only can NK cells directly lead to cytotoxic effects, but NK cells can also lead to increased expression of IFN-\u03b3 which may lead to upregulation of MHC class I, which may render tumor cells more susceptible to killing by CD8+ T cells.",
