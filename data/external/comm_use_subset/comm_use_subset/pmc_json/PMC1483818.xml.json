Achievement of controlled but efficient gene delivery will, however, depend on a detailed insight into virus biology. We have previously shown that A-MLV entry is closely associated with cholesterol-rich microdomains like rafts and caveolae [1] and that A-MLV envelope protein is associated with rafts in infected cells suggesting a possible role of rafts in A-MLV assembly [2]. It has also been shown for other viruses that rafts and/or caveolae are important for their entry and assembly [3-8]; specifically, has caveola-mediated entry been shown for, e.g., SV40 [4], echovirus 1 [7], and human coronavirus 229E [8]. Both domains consist of high concentrations of cholesterol, sphingomyelin, ganglioside GM1, and other saturated lipids [9,10] but in contrast to rafts do caveolae build omega-shaped invaginations within the plasma membrane of cells [11]. The unique lipid composition of rafts and caveolae leads to the specific incorporation or exclusion of proteins in these domains thereby creating distinct microenvironments for cellular processes [10,11].",

We also found these hallmarks of caveolae-mediated entry when studying A-MLV entry of fibroblastic cells [1]. Association of the viral receptor with caveolae would seem essential for viral entry through caveolae and our previous investigations also showed that the A-MLV receptor protein Pit2, a sodium-dependent phosphate transporter, is able to directly associate with caveolin-1 (cav-1) [1], one of the major structural proteins of caveolae [11]. However, the omega-like shape of caveolae and their average size of around 70 nm would suggest that A-MLV with its diameter of about 110 nm binds outside of caveolae. As rafts are suggested to be pre-caveolae [11] and a large fraction of the A-MLV receptor Pit2 was found associated with cholesterol-rich microdomains [1], we have here investigated if rafts and caveolae are involved in the early steps of A-MLV binding.",

Therefore, NIH3T3 cells were incubated for 3 hours at 37\u00b0C with fluorescently labeled A-MLV (GagYFP A-MLV) containing a nucleocapsid protein fused with yellow fluorescence protein (YFP) [12]. After subsequent washing and fixation, the cells were incubated with fluorescently labeled cholera toxin (CTX). This is a standard procedure for staining of cholesterol-rich microdomains since CTX binds specifically to GM1, a marker of rafts and caveolae [13]. As shown in figure 1A, cell-bound A-MLV showed a pronounced attachment to large GM1-positive microdomains. As GM1 is a general marker for cholesterol-rich microdomains, we investigated if these regions of preferred A-MLV binding were also enriched in caveolin-1 (cav-1), a major structural protein of caveolae. NIH3T3 cells were incubated with GagYFP A-MLV particles, washed, fixed, and permeabilized. Subsequently, the cells were stained for cav-1 and investigated using confocal microscopy. As expected a part of GagYFP A-MLV particles co-localized with cav-1 could be observed, however, cav-1 was not enriched at the favored binding sites of GagYFP A-MLV (Fig. 1B). The same was true for GagYFP A-MLV bound to NIH3T3 cells stably expressing a cav-1 mRed fusion protein (Fig. 1C). From these data, we suggest that rafts rather than caveolae are involved in the early steps of A-MLV binding.",

            "text": "Interestingly, in many investigated cells the stained cholesterol-rich microdomains appeared as large patched regions within the plasma membrane of the cells (Fig. 1A). As the cells were fixed before staining with CTX, we could exclude a patching of smaller rafts due to CTX binding. However, it is known, that binding of ligands or viruses to their raft-associated receptor can lead to patching of smaller raft domains [14,15]. We therefore investigated whether virus binding lead to patching of GM1-rich microdomains. As a control, we included VSV-G pseudotyped GagYFP MLV particles (here referred to as GagYFP VSV); VSV enters cells via clathrin-coated pits [16] and binding of these viral particles to the cells should therefore not lead to patching of cholesterol-rich microdomains. Thus, VSV or A-MLV pseudotypes of GagYFP MLV cores were added to NIH3T3 at 37\u00b0C, and after 30 minutes the cells were washed, fixed, and stained for GM1 with fluorescently labeled CTX. Confocal microscopy revealed that large cholesterol-rich microdomains were present in cells incubated with both VSV and A-MLV (Fig. 2). The same was true for NIH3T3 cells incubated with viral like particles lacking viral envelope proteins (data not shown). But in comparison to A-MLV, neither VSV nor viral like particles lacking viral envelope proteins showed preferential attachment to large rafts. Thus, while binding of A-MLV to the large raft regions seems to be A-MLV envelope specific, it did not lead to the formation of the large rafts.",

After this treatment, the cells were incubated with GagYFP A-MLV for 30 min at 37\u00b0C, washed, fixed, and stained for GM1 with fluorescently labeled CTX. Although we have previously shown that this treatment is sufficient to extract up to 70 percent of the plasma membrane cholesterol of NIH3T3 cells [1], large raft regions were still present (Fig. 3). In addition, A-MLV showed the same binding pattern as in the experiments in figures 1 and 2 demonstrating that depletion of cholesterol alone was not sufficient to prevent A-MLV binding to the large raft regions.",

            "text": "Using confocal microscopy we found that A-MLV binds preferentially to large GM1-positive membrane regions of NIH3T3 cells, which are most likely rafts. Cav-1 staining of NIH3T3 cells as well as NIH3T3 cells stably expressing a cav-1 mRed fusion protein revealed that cav-1 was not enriched at the favored binding sites of A-MLV. Interestingly, the large rafts were not a result of virus induced aggregation of smaller rafts (raft patching). NIH3T3 cells incubated together with VSV or with viral particles lacking a viral envelope protein had the same large GM1-positive domains as cells incubated with A-MLV. As VSV enters and infects cells via clathrin-coated pits [16], binding of VSV should not lead to any patching of rafts. Therefore, we conclude that the presence of large rafts in NIH3T3 cells is not a result of A-MLV binding. Raft patching is especially known from investigations of the T cell receptor (TCR) and the T cell coreceptor CD4. It has been shown that crosslinking of TCR and CD4 by antibodies as well as incubation of T cells with CTX lead to raft patching [18-20]. As we fixed the cells prior to staining with CTX, we can exclude that the large rafts are artifacts caused by the staining procedure. It should also be noted that large rafts were not present in other cell lines like 293T (human kidney cell line) or MDTF (Mus dunni tail fibroblasts) regardless of A-MLV binding (data not shown).",

            "text": "The origin of the large rafts in NIH3T3 cells is not known. However, raft patching occurs mainly through ligand-receptor interactions or other protein-protein interactions [14,15] and it is possible that proteins from serum or the presence of a prominent extracellular matrix associated with rafts could lead to raft patching and the appearance of large rafts in NIH3T3 cells. Raft patching in NIH3T3 cells induced by pronounced protein-protein interactions would indeed explain the resistance of these large domains to extraction of plasma membrane cholesterol with MBCD. Thus, it is likely that a complex and rigid protein network could preserve large rafts from disintegration even in the absence of cholesterol. In addition, A-MLV binding to large rafts was independent of plasma membrane cholesterol indicating that the A-MLV receptor Pit2 or other virus interacting proteins were still present in these regions. All vector particles used in the present study were produced by transient transfection of 293T cells and since A-MLV but not VSV or viral particles lacking viral envelope proteins showed favored binding to large rafts, we conclude that this is due to the presence of A-MLV envelope protein on the particles and therefore most likely due to the presence of Pit2 in these regions. Furthermore, in comparison to A-MLV only a small amount of VSV particles were cell-bound at the time of investigation. This is probably due to the faster entry of VSV into cells since we have previously shown that VSV particles enter NIH3T3 cells 4 times faster than A-MLV [1]. In addition, to ensure that the reason for the observed differences in A-MLV and VSV binding was not due to a lesser amount of VSV particles we also have incubated cells with lesser quantities of A-MLV. As expected, the amount of cell-bound A-MLV decreased but a high amount of the cell-bound particles were still found attached to large rafts (data not shown).",

Indeed, the amount of A-MLV particles associated with large rafts within 30 minutes of virus exposure suggests that rafts are involved in early events of A-MLV binding and that A-MLV virions bind to the cells outside of caveolae and subsequently associate with caveolae in the entry process. Furthermore, in agreement with the slow infection kinetic of A-MLV these data also suggest that transport of A-MLV from rafts to caveolae is a limiting step in A-MLV entry.",
