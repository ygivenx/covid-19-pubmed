            "text": "GB virus C (GBV-C) is a common human virus that can be transmitted sexually, parenterally and vertically from mother to child [1], [2]. Infection of immunocompetent individuals usually leads to clearance of GBV-C viraemia within the first years; however, GBV-C can cause persistent infection in approximately 25% of cases [3]. As a member of the flaviviridae family, for which a fourth genus, termed Pegivirus, was recently proposed, it is related to the hepatitis C virus (HCV) [4]. However, acute and persistent infection with GBV-C does not appear to be associated with hepatitis or any other diseases in humans (reviewed in [5], [6]). The GBV-C genome is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA (9.4 kb) that contains one long open reading frame (ORF) [7]\u2013[9]. The polyprotein is post-translationally processed by cellular and viral proteases into the structural proteins such as E1 and E2, as well as the nonstructural proteins NS2, NS3, NS4A/B and NS5A/B [10]. In most industrialized countries 1% to 5% of healthy individuals are viraemic for GBV-C and 10% to 15% have developed anti-E2 antibodies as evidence of past GBV-C infection [11]. In contrast to HCV, in the majority of GBV-C infected individuals, the occurrence of anti-E2 antibodies is associated with clearance of the virus [12]. However, GBV-C elimination has been documented without the appearance of anti-E2 antibodies, indicating that a diagnosis based merely on the detection of anti-E2 antibodies in serum might lead to an underestimation of prevalence of prior infection. Based on the common transmission routes, the prevalence of GBV-C in HCV and HIV\u20131-positive individuals is much higher than in the general population. GBV-C RNA prevalence rates range from 20% to 30% in HCV coinfected individuals and from 15% to 40% in HIV-1 patients (reviewed in [3]). Several, but not all, epidemiological studies and a meta-analysis have reported that GBV-C viraemia has a beneficial effect on the course of HIV-1 disease progression and survival [13]\u2013[20]. Furthermore, mother-to-child transmission of GBV-C reduces the vertical transmission of HIV-1 from GBV-C/HIV-1 coinfected mothers [21], and recently it was reported that accidental GBV-C acquisition via transfusion is associated with a significant reduction in mortality in HIV-infected individuals [22]. GBV-C is a lymphotropic virus that replicates primarily in B and T cells [23]. Therefore, it occupies, at least in part, the same ecological niche as HIV-1. Several effects have been proposed to explain the interference with HIV-1, including induction of chemokines, CD4 receptor and coreceptor modulation, prevention of Th2 cytokine profile, reduction of T cell activation, as well as downmodulation of FAS-mediated apoptosis in GBV-C coinfected individuals [24]\u2013[31]. Cell culture experiments revealed a direct influence on HIV-1 replication by at least two GBV-C proteins, i.e., the nonstructural protein NS5A and the E2 envelope protein [31], [32]. Whereas NS5A leads to decreased HIV-1 receptor expression and stabilization of the Th1 profile, the E2 protein prevents HIV-1 entry by a mechanism as yet unknown [31], [33]\u2013[35]. Using synthetic peptides presenting different regions of E2, we recently demonstrated that this interference with HIV-1 entry can be ascribed to the N-terminal part of the GBV-C E2 protein ranging from residue 29 to 72 (according to GenBank accession no. AF121950) [33]. Two overlapping 20 mer peptides (P4-7 and P6-2) presenting amino acids 37 to 56 (WDRGNVTLLCDCPNGPWVWV) and 45 to 64 (LCDCPNGPWVWVPAFCQAVG), respectively, of the GBV-C E2 protein, were shown to be most potent with IC50s between 2 and 0.2 \u00b5M in a TZM-bl-based HIV-1 replication assay.",

The noncovalent association between the two subunits appears to be maintained by interaction of the N- and C-termini of gp120 with the disulfide loop region of gp41 and parts of the flanking N- and C-terminal heptad repeat regions (NHR and CHR) (reviewed in [36]). The primary receptor for gp120 is CD4, which is expressed on the surface of monocytes, macrophages, and on subsets of dendritic and T cells [37]. Upon engagement of CD4, gp120 undergoes a conformational shift, enabling binding to the chemokine coreceptors CXCR4 or CCR5, respectively [38], [39]. This interaction is thought to induce additional conformational changes in the envelope trimer that result in exposure of the hydrophobic fusion peptide of gp41 and its insertion into the host cell membrane. Subsequently, the NHR and CHR regions of gp41 fold back and interact with each other, in order to form a six-helix bundle (6-HB), that promotes the convergence of the viral and cellular membrane and the formation of the membrane pore (reviewed in [40]).",

All other peptides (listed in Table S1) were synthesized by a standard solid-phase FMOC method using a peptide synthesizer. The N- and C-termini of N36 and C34, as well as the gp120 N-terminus peptides, were acetylated and amidated, respectively. The gp41 disulfide peptides (Loop36ox and Loop36s) were N-terminally biotinylated for site-selective attachment to streptavidin-coated assay plates. Loop36o\u00d7 was cyclized by formation of a disulfide bridge between the two cysteine residues through air oxidation at pH 8. The peptides were purified to homogeneity (>95% purity) by high-performance liquid chromatography and verified by laser desorption mass spectrometry (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) and by ESI mass spectrometry, respectively.

Based on the temperature sensitivity of envelope-mediated membrane fusion, low temperature (<28\u00b0C) during and after CD4/gp120 engagement leads to an arrest of the fusion process at an intermediate state and the blockade of coreceptor binding, 6-HB formation, and final membrane fusion [53]\u2013[55]. As shown in Figure 2, the effect of antibodies that interfere with the initial CD4/gp120 interaction (b12 and B4) was largely abrogated under TAS conditions. In contrast, P4-7 and P6-2 showed full activity under both conditions, comparable to known fusion inhibitors like AMD-3100 and the neutralizing MPER antibody 2F5 that act after CD4 engagement.

In a related approach, the effect of E2 peptides or intact E2 protein on the interaction between gp120 and the coreceptors CCR5 and CXCR4 expressed on cells was tested by immunoblotting. To ensure efficient binding of gp120 to the coreceptors, soluble CD4 (sCD4) was added simultaneously. Use of CCR5-antagonists Maraviroc and TAK-779 or anti-gp120 coreceptor binding site (V3-loop) antibodies 447-52D or F425B4e8, respectively, as positive controls revealed a clear reduction in the gp120/CCR5 and a less pronounced decline (densitometric analysis \u223c50%) in the gp120/CXCR4 interaction. However, after normalization of the band intensity (Hsp90; data not shown) there was no indication for any E2-effect on the binding efficiency between gp120 and the HIV-1 coreceptors CCR5 or CXCR4, respectively (Figure 3C, D).",

The surface of the HIV-1 particle consists of a lipid bilayer with incorporated host cell proteins and a limited number of functional envelope (Env) trimers (on average 14\u00b17) [56]. Therefore, we tested whether the HIV-1-inhibitory E2 peptides interact with trimeric HIV-1 Env proteins expressed on the surface of transfected cells. For this purpose, 293T cells were transiently transfected with an HIV-1 Env expression vector, coding for the gp160 precursor of the CXCR4-tropic NL4-3 envelope (X4env). Binding of FITC-labeled E2 peptides was monitored by flow cytometry. Although we could observe a background attachment of P4-7 and P6-2 to mock- or vector-transfected 293T cells, there was a significant increase in the binding of P4-7 and P6-2 when cells expressed HIV-1 Env and were pretreated with sCD4 (Figure 4A). In contrast, the increase of binding was not observed with the negative control peptide P28. These data suggest that the HIV-inhibitory E2 peptides bind to HIV-1 Env and that this interaction seems to be CD4-dependent, since the induction of conformational changes in gp120 and/or the increase in availability of gp41 after CD4 engagement facilitates E2-binding.",

Of the eight antibodies, only the gp41 interaction of F240 and T32 was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by P4-7 and P6-2, but not by the negative control P28 (Figure 5C). No unspecific binding between the E2 peptides (P4-7 and P6-2) and the antibodies F240 or T32 was observed that could have account for the same competition results (data not shown). Therefore, we conclude that P4-7 and P6-2 compete with F240 and T32 considerably for the same binding region. F240 and T32 represent two of three tested antibodies that recognize the immunodominant disulfide loop region of gp41. Their epitopes overlap partially with each other, implying that the E2 peptides bind approximately between residues 596 and 612 of gp160. The epitopes of all tested anti-gp41-mAbs are shown in Figure 5A and Table S2. Again, the serine variants of P4-7 and P6-2 lost their ability to compete for the binding target with the disulfide loop antibody F240 or were at least less efficient (T32). Finally, we performed a direct binding assay with biotin-tagged 36mer gp41 disulfide loop peptides (residues from 588 to 623 according to HIV gp160HxB2) and GBV-C E2340-Fc. We immobilized via streptavidin an oxidized (closed loop) or a linear variant of the disulfide loop, in which the cysteine residues were replaced with serine (Table S1) onto plates and the binding of graded concentrations of GBV-C E2340-Fc was monitored with HRP-anti-human antibodies. Indeed, a distinct binding of recombinant E2340-Fc protein to the gp41 disulfide loop peptides was evident in a dose dependent manner, whereas for the Fc control only a low background binding was observed. The binding of E2340-Fc was clearly diminished when the linear serine variant of the gp41 disulfide loop was tested (Figure 5D).",

Furthermore, residues within the gp41 trimer, which have been proposed to be involved in the gp120 interface, are located near or within the epitopes of the two antibodies T32 and F240 whose interaction with gp41 was disrupted by the E2 peptides P4-7 and P6-2 (Figure 6C).",

Therefore, we assessed in E2-gp41 competition assays the effect of a gp120 peptide (N35, gp120 residue 31 to 65) that includes the respective E2-similarity region (Figure 7). We observed that N35 efficiently competed with E2 for gp41 binding, implying that E2 and gp120 share the same gp41 interaction site. Not surprisingly, the gp41 affinity was more pronounced for N35 (IC50\u22360.7 \u00b5M) than for the E2 peptides (IC50s: 7.0 \u00b5M for P6-2 and 11.7 \u00b5M for P4-7). The C54S variant of this peptide (N35s) still abrogated the E2-gp41 interaction in a dose dependent manner, but less efficiently than the wild-type N35 peptide (IC50\u22364.6 \u00b5M). Together, these results strongly support the hypothesis that a mimicry phenomenon between the N-termini of the non-related viral glycoproteins E2GBV-C and gp120HIV, enables the E2 N-terminus to approach the gp120 binding site on gp41 that is believed to be the disulfide loop region.",

Our analysis consistently suggests the presence of a folded region spanning residues 76 to 195 of GBV-C E2. The remaining extracellular part, in particular the N-terminal region including amino acids 1 to 75 that comprise the HIV-1-inhibitory domain, does not contain significant amounts of regular secondary structure and is therefore predicted to form no globular conformation (Figure 8).

This notion is evidenced by the observations that neither the cell surface expression of HIV-1 receptors, nor the binding of gp120 to CD4 and coreceptors, respectively, appears to be affected. Instead, HIV-inhibitory E2 peptides showed full activity on HIV entry at a post-binding stage.

Interestingly, the sequence stretch covered by the HIV-inhibitory peptides includes the strongest conserved part of the nonglobular N-terminus of related flaviviridae E2 proteins (Figure S1).

The gp41 disulfide loop region structurally connects the NHR and CHR domains and contains two conserved cysteines [64]. Noteworthy, the N-terminal E2 region contains three cysteine residues (Cys46, Cys48 and Cys60) as well. Previously we could show that variants of the E2 peptides (P4-7s and P6-2s), in which cysteines were replaced with serine residues, lost their HIV-inhibitory capacity [33]. In agreement with these observations, in this study, P4-7s and P6-2s lost their ability to compete with E2 for gp41binding. In addition, the cysteine residues within the disulfide loop peptide appeared to be crucial for the interaction with recombinant E2 protein. This implies that the cysteine residues within the HIV-inhibitory E2 peptides may interfere with the oxidation state of the respective cysteines in the gp41 disulfide loop region. A variety of evidence suggests that a number of viral envelope glycoproteins depend on a dynamic thiol/disulfide balance to mediate virus-cell fusion (reviewed in [65]). For HIV-1 it has been shown that after CD4 binding a cell surface-associated reductase activity leads to cleavage of disulfide bonds at least within gp120 and that this event is obligatory for triggering membrane fusion [66]. However, the insights into the mechanistic role of the disulfide loop cysteines for the fusion reaction are still limited and need further evaluation. Future studies will show, whether reducing agents would change the interference effects of GBV-C E2-derived peptides.",

Thus, the transient states of gp41 appears to be valid HIV-1 inhibitor targets, as evidenced by a number of known HIV-1 fusion inhibitors, including gp41-targeted peptides and low-molecular-weight inhibitors. These inhibitors typically bind to the NHR or CHR regions during the prehairpin stage in order to prevent the formation of the 6-HB. However, M\u00fcnch et al. [42] isolated the natural HIV-1 entry inhibitor VIRIP from human hemofiltrates, targeting the gp41 fusion peptide, and broad neutralizing antibodies, like 2F5, 4E10, and Z13e1, bind the MPER, an epitope that is also transiently accessible at a late stage of HIV-1 entry. Our results show that the interaction of a peptide with the gp41 disulfide loop region can block HIV-1 fusion, thus introducing the gp41 disulfide loop as a new and promising target for HIV-1 entry inhibition. The relevance of disulfide loop-targeting HIV-1 inhibitors is further supported by two reports that describe low-molecular-weight HIV-1 inhibitors causing resistance-conferring mutations within that disulfide loop region [68], [69].",

The difference of action between the cluster I antibodies and E2 peptides is an interesting question that needs further investigation. One possible explanation may be the fact that steric forces prevent globular antibodies to gain access to the gp41 disulfide loops at the right time, whereas peptides may have sufficient flexibility for this purpose. However, it is tempting to speculate whether in vivo the intact E2 ectodomain is able to reach the gp41 disulfide loop in a peptide-like manner? While no structural information on E2 is available, our computer-based structural analysis revealed that the N-terminal region of E2 (residues 1 to 75) appears to be largely unstructured, suggesting that this protein domain may be sufficiently flexible to interact with the disulfide loop of gp41 during HIV-1 entry.

However, little is known at the atomic level about the critical gp120-gp41 interface. Several mutagenesis studies suggest that the N- and C-termini of gp120 interact with the disulfide loop of gp41 and flanking parts of the NHR and CHR regions [62], [63], [72]\u2013[74]. However, our knowledge about the dynamic gp120-gp41 interplay during the different phases of HIV-1 entry is sparse. We do not know which parameters allow gp120 to stabilize gp41 in a metastable conformation in the unliganded trimer and after CD4 engagement but support gp41 rearrangements after coreceptor binding. A recent crystal structure of an HIV-1 gp120 core with intact gp120 N- and C-termini revealed three topologically separate and structurally plastic layers [75]. The conformational mobility of these layers together appears to be relevant for buffering movements of gp120 from gp41. It should be noted that the extended gp120 N-terminus appeared particularly flexible, such that interactions with gp41 in the viral spike could easily induce termini movements [75]. This plasticity of the termini might also offer an explanation for the fact that the interactions of the gp120 N-terminus with gp41 can be mimicked by flexible peptides. Computational and experimental data from this study indicate that N-terminal GBV-C E2 peptides mimic the HIV-1 gp120 N-terminus and are therefore able to compete with gp120 for binding to the disulfide loop region of gp41. Competition experiments confirmed that E2 peptides (P4-7 and P6-2) and a corresponding N-terminal gp120 peptide ranging from residue 31 to 65 of gp120 share the same binding region in gp41. Therefore, we conclude that the respective E2 peptides may displace gp120 and disturb the interface between gp120 and gp41 after CD4 or coreceptor binding. This phenomenon may result in impeding the concerted interplay between stabilization (native, unbound state) and destabilization (receptor-bound and following states) of the gp120-gp41 complex, which is critical for HIV-1 entry to take its proper course. In particular, binding of E2 or E2-derived peptides to the gp41 disulfide loop may influence the proper disulfide formation of gp41, the flexibility of gp41 that is needed to promote the 6-HB formation, or the membrane accessibility of gp41 that is essential for lipid mixing. However, the elucidation of the precise mode of action of the disulfide loop targeting peptides will be an interesting subject for future evaluations. In this context, it would be interesting to consider chimeric peptides that incorporate sequences of GBV-C E2 and the HIV-1 N-terminus of gp120 as a new approach to enhance the antiretroviral activity of disulfide loop-targeted peptide inhibitors.",

Our data do not confirm the association of the GBV-C E2 N-terminus with the HIV-1 fusion peptide during HIV-1 entry. However, it is very plausible that other E2 regions interact with the N-terminal gp41 fusion peptide, in addition to the interaction of the GBV-C E2 N-terminus with the gp41 disulfide loop proposed in this study. Most recently, Xiang et al. [35] reported that the GBV-C E2 protein or a peptide representing the E2 residues 276 to 292 interfered with HIV-1 entry, when expressed in Jurkat cells. However, when added to cells the respective peptide did not inhibit HIV-1 entry unless it was fused to Tat for cellular uptake. Taken together, these observations support the relevance of GBV-C E2 for HIV-1 entry interference but suggest that additionally to the N-terminus at least the C-terminal part of the E2 ectodomain is involved in HIV-1 entry inhibition. This may also explain the modest effect on CXCR4 cell surface presentation upon expression of full length E2 that we do not see after cell incubation with N-terminal E2 peptides. However, it needs further evaluation to what extent E2-presenting GBV-C particles or GBV-C infected cells via a bystander effect, proposed by Xiang et al.
