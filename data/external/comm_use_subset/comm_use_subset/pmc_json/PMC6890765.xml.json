The ligand exchange using polymers with functional groups able to attach the metal NP is a successful approach to attain thin polymer shells6. However to achieve polymer coating with tunable thickness, polymerization in heterogeneous media, as free radical precipitation polymerization (FRPP) is the most widely choice7,8. Since this technique relies on the precipitation of water insoluble growing polymer chain, a previous surface preparation of metal NP is required. Note that the organic polymer is not compatible with the anionic citrate ligand, commonly used to synthesize metal NPs, in aqueous medium9,10. Therefore a variety of strategies can be found in the literature, mainly for gold7,8,11\u201315, whereas works focused on achieving silver@polymer core-shell nanogels are scarce; despite the reliable properties of silver NPs in applications as ultrasensitive analysis of molecules through Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS)2,16, catalysis17, cancer cell imaging16,18 and other applications related to their antimicrobial properties19.",

Previous backgrounds evidenced the curcumin ability to reduce Ag+ and Au3+ ions to silver20\u201322 and gold23 nanoparticles, without any other additional reductant or in the presence of citrate and CTBA to modulate NP shape24. Thus, Kundu and Nithiyanantham20, in a pioneer work, were able to synthesize different shapes of AgNP (spheres, nanowires and anisotropic nanoflakes) by tuning the molar ratio of curcumin to AgNO3. Nevertheless, even though the reductant ability of curcumin has been already reported, it should be noted that, as far as we know, none has postulated that hydrophobic curcumin presence nearby metal surface may facilitate polymer self-assembling during post-crosslinking polymerization. In addition, by considering the antioxidant properties of this natural phenolic compound, our curcumin-promoted Ag@nanogel hybrid system will state a double benefit arising from the biomedical properties of curcumin itself, as antibacterial, self-healing25,26, antiviral27 and anti-inflammatory28; and from the antibacterial19 synergistic effect and remarkable antiviral29 activity of particles comprising silver nanoparticles and curcumin in one hybrid. Moreover, encapsulation of curcumin in the hydrophobic polymer shell will increase curcumin bioavailability protecting curcumin from hydrolytic degradation30, since this is the main limitation for its therapeutic applications.",

After 15 min of reaction, the flask was removed from the silicon bath and allowed to cool to room temperature. The as-synthesized silver nanocores had an average size around 60 nm (90 \u00b0C, series -A) and 40 nm (100 \u00b0C, series B) in diameter, respectively. To elucidate the role of curcumin as stabilizing agent, the sample obtained in this first step was purified by centrifugation to eliminate the excess of reagents that are not protecting the silver core. The presence of curcumin close to the AgNP surface, attained in this first step, was confirmed by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy (Fig. S1). As it can be observed in this Figure, the spectrum corresponding to Ag@cur (green line) is very similar to that of curcumin (blue line). The most prominent vibration band at \u223c1510 cm\u22121 assigned to highly mixed vibration including C=O stretching35 appears in both spectra as well as other characteristic vibration bands of curcumin at 1626 cm\u22121(mixed C=C and C=O stretching), 1429 cm\u22121 (deformation of CH3), 1271 cm\u22121 (deformation of phenyl rings), 817 cm\u22121 (C-H out\u2010of\u2010plane aromatic motions).

As it can be seen, two strong bands corresponding to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching of CO2\u2212 groups at 1562 cm\u22121 and at 1387 cm\u22121, respectively appear with nearly similar intensity for the free sodium citrate spectrum (violet line); whereas for Ag@citrate spectrum (orange line), the most prominent band corresponds to the symmetric stretch at 1362 cm\u22121. In the spectrum corresponding to Ag@cur NPs (green line), this vibration band at 1362 cm\u22121 is absent and only the asymmetric stretching (\u223c 1590 cm\u22121) can be hardly intuited overlapped with vibration bands from curcumin (blue line); these facts indicate that the affinity of sodium citrate for the silver surface is lower than that of curcumin. In addition, the bands attributed to C-H (2937\u20132948 cm\u22121) and C=O stretching vibrations of MEO2MA appear very weak, also suggesting a low interaction of the monomer with the silver surface.",

For the purpose of thermoresponsive-shell polymerization, Ag@cur was first flushed with N2 for 20 min at the lowest possible temperature (room temperature), with the aim of reducing water evaporation during nitrogen flow. Subsequently, APS initiator was added and incubated for 2 h in a closed flask under stirring at 70 \u00b0C. The presence of hydrophobic curcumin nearby the metallic surface led to precipitation-polymerization of P(MEO2MA) around the AgNPs previously formed (Fig. 1B,C); and the resulting Ag@cur-P(MEO2MA) nanoparticles were born negatively charged due to the persulfate groups from the APS initiator, which promotes their colloidal stability. The successful encapsulation of Ag@cur NPs within P(MEO2MA) nanogels can be anticipated by the ATR-FTIR spectrum shown in Fig. S1 corresponding to f4 of Ag@cur-G3B sample (Table 1), which displays typical vibration bands attributed to both curcumin and P(MEO2MA). It should be noted that an attempt to encapsulate AgNPs synthesized solely using sodium citrate caused irreversible aggregation in the second polymerization step (Fig. S2). This fact evidences the role of hydrophobic curcumin to provide both a protection to the AgNPs and a good interface between the polymer and the metal surface.",

Surprisingly, when comparing both cur-G and Ag@cur-G NPs, for similar curcumin/polymer ratios (Tables 1 and 2), qualitative differences were observed in their respective spectra evolution (Fig. 3). Consistently with curcumin data (Tables 1 and 2), curcumin related vibration bands seemed to be differently affected by its content. Cur-G series exhibited an increase tendency of intensity (Fig. 3A,B); whereas Ag@cur-G series (Fig. 3C,D) barely varied. This observation could be explained through the key-implication of curcumin in our nuclei-growth approach (Fig. 1) which determines, at the end, the morphology of Ag@cur-G nanohybrids. In fact, the specific silver-nucleation strategy (Fig. 1B) makes feasible that certain amount of curcumin be preferably confined at the metal surface, being subsequently enclosed at higher concentration during P(MEO2MA) polymer growing shell onto silver core NPs (Ag@cur-G) than during polymer assembling along silver-free P(MEO2MA) nanogels formation (cur-G).",

A mere glance to S-TEM pictures revealed almost concentric nanostructuration of polymer shell coverage around metal core for both series of nanohybrids. Both series were synthesized with similar curcumin/polymer ratios (3.80, 3.15, 2.10 and 1.05 wt%, Table 1). The resultant mean values of Ag-core diameter (60 nm at 90 \u00b0C and 40 nm at 100 \u00b0C) for both series are collected in Table 1. These differences can be attributed to the faster nucleation rate with increasing temperature that leads to smaller NPs. EDX spectra in Fig. S3 confirm the presence of Ag in two representative hybrid samples with 60 nm (Ag@cur-G4A) and 40 nm (Ag@cur-G4B) core diameter, the determined elemental composition is in agreement with ther core size of both nanohybrids.",

At this time, 800 \u03bcL of a citrate solution 0.12 M was added to the reaction mixture instead of 0.029 M, in the presence of 3.8 wt% of curcumin, at 100 \u00b0C. As expected, it resulted in two highly differentiated Ag-core populations (30 nm and 5 nm) shown in Fig. S4. Interestingly, AgNPs (\u223c5 nm) were mostly formed at the limit around the polymeric vesicle boundary but also closely packed inside polymer networking-shell of 250 nm of size (Fig. S4). This behavior is attributed to the high nucleation of the nanoparticles due to the high concentration of citrate that causes a greater ion exchange and increases the total ionic strength in the solution, promoting the formation of particle agglomerates in some cases. Then, in the regime of low curcumin concentration, phase separation can take place, being the smallest spherical cores produced by sodium citrate and the almost rod-like AgNPs promoted by curcumin. So, we hypothesize that an appropriate balance among both reducing agents (sodium citrate and curcumin) is needed to obtain more uniform AgNP population.",

This temperature is known as temperature-induced volume phase transition (VPTT) which can be followed by measuring the particle hydrodynamic size by DLS. In Fig. 5 representative Z-average vs temperature curves are shown for the series of Ag@cur-G#B NPs synthesized at 100 \u00b0C (Fig. 5Ai and Table 1) and of the cur-G# nanogels (Fig. 5Aii and Table 2). As can be observed the VPTT values, calculated from the inflection point of the curve (Fig. 5Ai), are around 20 \u00b0C for the two hybrid NPs series (Ag@cur-G, Table 1), showing no dependence on the curcumin content. These results are in good agreement with the ATR-FTIR spectra (Fig. 3) which indicated rather similar curcumin content for Ag@cur-G hybrids NPs. On the contrary, cur-G nanogels (Fig. 5Aii) exhibit slightly decreasing VPTT values with increasing the curcumin content (Table 2). This implication is clearly evidenced at low temperature, where the decrease of the nanogel size is affected by the hydrophobicity feature of curcumin (Fig. 5Aii).",

Nevertheless, in the present investigation, we only observed this temperature-dependent effect on nanoparticles without curcumin (G0 in Fig. 5Bi). Indeed, hybrid NPs exhibited a tunable \u03b6-potential temperature-dependent behavior before (Ag@cur) and after polymerization (Ag@cur-G). So, initial \u03b6-potential diminution values with increasing temperature (Fig. 5Bii) rapidly transited to high and almost invariant \u03b6-potential values with temperature (Fig. 5Biii) as polymerization progressed.

Figure 5C displays representative UV-Vis spectra (below and above VPTT) for two nanohybrid samples with different core size (Ag60nm@cur-G4A, Fig. 5Ci and Ag40nm@cur-G4B, Fig. 5Cii) and nanogels (cur-G4, Fig. 5Ciii) synthesized with 3.8 wt% of curcumin content (Table 1). In UV-Vis absorbance spectra, SPR band of the nanohybrid with a higher silver diameter (Fig. 5Ci) red-shifted while broadening considerably with respect to SPR band of the nanohybrid with a smaller silver diameter (Fig. 5Cii). Obviously, the SPR band position and width was affected by the core-size and the temperature-induced variation of the electromagnetic field in its neighboring environment. The cur-G4 sample containing silver-free nanogel (Fig. 5Ciii) only showed the curcumin effect on nanogel swelling behavior which determines the refractive index of the polymer-gel with the surrounding aqueous medium. In addition, a reversible red-blue shift was observed, when the temperature increase-decrease the VPTT of the polymer shell (Fig. 5). When the external temperature rises above the VPTT, the nanogel shell expels water dictated by the strengthening of hydrophobic interactions giving rise to (i) a decrease of the polymer shell thickness and (ii) an increase of the refractive index. At that point, the effect of refractive index augmentation exceeds to that of the shell thickness diminution; therefore a red-shift should be observed above the VPTT for plasmonic-core@thermoresponsive-shell nanohybrids. Fig. 5Ci and 4Cii illustrate this behavior for our Ag-based thermoresponsive-polymer (core@shell) hybrid NPs which correlates well with similar results reported for Au-core based thermoresponsive core@shell nanogels38.",

According to Manolova et al.39, in solvents as ethanol, only the enol\u2013keto tautomer is present; whereas the addition of water leads to appearance of a new spectral band (about 350 nm), which was attributed to the diketo tautomeric form. The keto-enol form, due to a strong intramolecular hydrogen bond, undergoes transformation into a totally delocalized \u03c0-system. Due to the hydrophobic character of curcumin, it presents luminescence properties in organic solvents but it is almost non-fluorescent in aqueous solution. However, by complexation through hydrophobic interactions with proteins40 or with amphiphilic polymers as pluronic41, or encapsulating curcumin in hydrophobic polymer nanoparticles30, fluorescence enhancement in aqueous medium has been reported. Previous to the luminescence investigation of the Ag@cur-G hybrid NPs, we investigated the absorption and emission of curcumin encapsulated in the thermoresponsive nanogels, cur-G (Table 3 and Fig. S5). Hydrophobic curcumin was engulfed by thermoresponsive NPs during the polymerization process, based on the precipitation of the growing polymer at 70 \u00b0C due to its unfavorable interaction with the water solvent above LCST (Fig. 1). Absorbance spectra for curcumin embedded in P(MEO2MA) nanogels (cur-G) at the polymer concentration of 1 mg mL\u22121 show an increase of intensity proportional to the curcumin concentration (Fig. S5). In agreement with previous reports of curcumin entrapped in hydrophobic30 or amphiphilic block copolymers41, a main absorption band at 425\u2013430 nm in addition to a shoulder about 450 nm30 appear in Fig. S5. Some authors attributed the signal at 430 nm to the keto-enol tautomer39,42, whereas the band at 350 nm, associated to the keto form and that typically appears in water, is absent in the present case. Fig. S5 inset shows the linear dependence of the curcumin absorption maxima at 427 nm vs molar concentration of curcumin according to the Beer-Lambert law for cur-G nanogels.",

The emission maxima are about 509\u2013515 nm in good agreement with the values reported by Banerjee et al.30 for curcumin encapsulated in polymeric nanoparticles. The position of the emission maxima of curcumin is strongly dependent on the solvent; so by increasing the polarity from chloroform to water, the emission maximum is red-shifted and broadened from 497 nm to 550 nm42. Both the QY values and the emission maxima position for the present cur-G nanogels seem to indicate that curcumin is well protected by the hydrophobic environment provided by the polymer.",

However we know that it can be an \u00a8apparent increase\u00a8 since the absorption band consideration for estimating the QY values was not properly drawn up. Note that this absorption band reflects the additive contribution from the overlapped silver and curcumin SPR bands. Then, on the basis of these considerations, at lower curcumin concentration, the real curcumin contribution to the final absorbance will be lower.

The aim is to draw on the reductive capacity of some bioactive molecules as curcumin for the in situ formation of metallic NPs, meanwhile their hydrophobic character leads the polymer nanostructuration in aqueous medium in the presence of the inorganic metal-core. Therefore, new core-doped shell nanohybrids based on silver plasmonic core, thermoresponsive polymer shell and embedded luminescence and bioactive curcumin are easily obtained with potential bioapplications such as antimicrobial systems. Furthermore, polymeric nanogels encapsulating curcumin were also achieved, which luminescent properties are strongly enhanced by increasing temperature. This last property could be tuned even with the minimum ratio of bioactive compound.",
