All individuals who met the eligibility criteria (>18 years old, healthy [no fever or other illness reported at time of enrollment], and working in a health facility, and reported being actively involved during the 2014 Boende outbreak response) were approached for enrollment in the study. All participants were screened for signs of current illness or fever; no participants included in the current analysis reported ever having been or suspected of having been infected with EBOV. In total, 565 HCWs were consented and enrolled in the study from 26 health facilities (hospitals, health centers, or health posts), and 1 church, which provided health services to the community. The study included a sociodemographic and epidemiologic questionnaire and sample collection. Blood specimens frozen, stored and tested were obtained from all consenting participants by venipuncture into red-top Vacutainer tubes (BD Biosciences). After processing, aliquots of serum were frozen and stored at the Institut National de Recherche Biomedicale in Kinshasa and shipped to the Blood Systems Research Institute in San Francisco, California, for performance of the remaining serological and neutralization assays.",

Among HCWs considered in direct contact with patients, traditional healers, pastors, and midwives had the highest GP and NP seroprevalence (excluding physicians due to sample size, n = 2), whereas Red Cross workers had the highest VP40 seroprevalence and neutralizing capacity (22.2% and 5.6% respectively; P < .05). HCWs having indirect contact with patient demonstrated similar heterogeneity across occupations.

However, within each category there was significant heterogeneity. These differences may be explained by the fact that, in an outbreak situation, everyone, including guards and administrators, could be required to assist with potentially infected persons when regular hospital staff are not able to meet the demands of the patients, potentially leading to exposures to bodily fluids, sick patients, or community members. This group also likely reflects the general population and may indicate that there is endemic EBOV exposure in this area. However, overall these results most likely suggest that the GP ELISA as a standalone test is relatively nonspecific. This may be due to unrelated nonspecific binding, with the high degree of glycosylation in EBOV GP lending itself to such nonspecific recognition. Alternately, it may be that GP is more sensitive than other viral proteins to the presence of cross-reactive antibodies directed against related viruses. In contrast, the unique mechanism of ebolavirus entry lends itself to highly specific, but possibly insensitive, detection of prior ebolavirus infection [43].",

This includes 3 individuals who were seroreactive on all tests and exhibited neutralizing capacity: a 52-year-old midwife, a 48-year-old administrator, and a 78-year-old volunteer. It is not known whether seroreactivity to assays is related to EBOV exposure during the 2014 outbreak\u2014in particular because all HCWs included for this analysis participated in the outbreak response and reported varying levels of contact with EVD patients and biological specimens. It may also be possible that variation in antigenic response and neutralization levels may be related to asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic infection, which would not have been necessarily detected as illness due to EBOV [44]. It is possible that some seroreactive individuals could also have been exposed to a non-EBOV filovirus.",

We were unable to interview every HCW from every health facility in the health zone, notably missing HCWs in Lokolia, which is the village in which the outbreak was concentrated, due to logistical constraints such as impassable roads. We attempted to make our study population as diverse as possible by enrolling participants in both formal and informal settings, and those who may have been displaced from their normal facility to support the outbreak response. There may have been some misclassification of specific HCW occupations, and patient contact was categorized based on occupation type and not recall of contact exposures. In addition, HCWs may play multiple different roles depending on the need of the facility during the outbreak response. We attempted to classify them based on their primary position in the health facility. Furthermore, all results are based on serologic assays, so adjusting the cutoff value can affect the overall results. Thus, we explored the range of responses (Figure 3) from each assay and used a higher manufacturer cutoff based on the calibration curve provided, assuming a higher background rate of cross-reactivity.",

Providing adequate training of HCWs to infection control procedures and availability of personal protective equipment to reduce exposure to bodily fluids of patients they treat before an EVD outbreak occurs is ultimately one of the most important strategies to limit the spread of ebolavirus and other blood-borne pathogens of both high and low consequence. Furthermore, our findings raise additional questions about EBOV exposure, risk, and circulating virus in DRC. Currently, there is no serological gold standard for ebolavirus serology. Our results highlight the need for additional research to better understand the roles each protein plays in immune response. Better understanding of the significance of EVD seroreactivity and risk factors associated with these exposures will improve our ability to design and implement locally sustainable strategies to limit exposure of HCWs to ebolavirus and other pathogens.",
