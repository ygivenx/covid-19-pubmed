Periodontal disease is caused by the formation of biofilm due to the growth of bacteria in the gingival sulcus1. This biofilm elicits an abnormal host immune responses, which is followed by destruction of periodontal tissues such as periodontal ligament and alveolar bone, eventually leading to tooth loss1,5.",

FimA proteins are divided into three genotypes (A, B, and C), based on differences in their putative amino acid sequences8. Among these fimA genotypes, type C P. gulae is considered to be the most virulent, as it is predominant in the oral cavities of dogs with severe periodontitis8. Interestingly, type C P. gulae is also prevalent in the oral cavities of dogs with mitral regurgitation9, which implies that P. gulae may be associated with some types of systemic disease.",

Gingival epithelial cells play an important role in preventing bacterial invasion deeper into tissue21; however, changes in the host inflammatory response produced by gingival epithelial cells exposed to P. gulae remain unknown. The relative ratios of mRNA expression levels of IL-1\u03b2, COX-2, IL-8, and TGF-\u03b21 in Ca9-22 human gingival epithelial cells infected with P. gulae strains were analysed with their respective levels at 0 h after P. gulae infection defined as 1.0. IL-1\u03b2, COX-2, and IL-8 levels in the presence of each P. gulae strain were highest at 2 h after infection; these levels were significantly higher than those in uninfected cells (P < 0.001) (Supplementary Fig. 1a). In addition, at 2 h after infection, IL-1\u03b2 expression induced by P. gulae D049 (type C) infection was significantly higher than that induced by P. gulae ATCC 51700 (type A) or P. gulae D040 (type B) (P < 0.05); a similar trend was observed with respect to COX-2. IL-8 expression tended to be higher in the presence of strain D049 (type C) than in the presence of strains ATCC 51700 (type A) or D040 (type B); however, there were no significant differences among the strains. There was no change in the expression level of TGF-\u03b21 at any time after P. gulae infection. Subsequently, we measured the protein levels of IL-1\u03b2, COX-2, IL-8, and TGF-\u03b21 in P. gulae-infected Ca9-22 cells (Fig. 2a). In Ca9-22 cells infected with each strain of bacteria, increased protein levels of IL-1\u03b2, COX-2, and IL-8 were observed, whereas protein expression of TGF-\u03b21 was nearly absent, regardless of the presence of the bacteria. Similar to the mRNA analysis, expression levels of IL-1\u03b2, COX-2, and IL-8 induced by strain D049 (type C) infection were significantly higher than expression levels induced by strains ATCC 51700 (type A) or D040 (type B).",

Two of 10 dogs (20%) in the clindamycin group and four of 14 dogs (28.6%) in the IFN-\u03b1 group were negative for P. gulae after treatment. The combination group had the lowest rate of P. gulae detection after treatment: P. gulae was absent from the oral cavity in six of 16 dogs (37.5%). Next, we determined the relative ratio of the detection of each fimA type after treatment, compared with that before treatment. In the control group, only the relative ratio of fimA type B was reduced after treatment (Fig. 5b). In contrast, the relative ratios of fimA types A and C were reduced after treatment in the clindamycin group; the relative ratios of all fimA genotypes were reduced after treatment in the IFN-\u03b1 and combination groups. Notably, the relative ratios of fimA type C were dramatically reduced after treatment, which were present in 37.5% and 20% of dogs in the clindamycin and combination groups, respectively.

Consequently, alveolar bone resorption and tooth mobility occur, followed by loss of teeth in some instances26. Periodontal disease is present in more than 80% of mature dogs and is one of the most prevalent diseases in dogs26. P. gulae is a major periodontopathic bacteria that has been strongly associated with the deterioration of periodontal disease in dogs7. However, there have been no studies of the potential for preventing periodontal disease in dogs by reducing the pathogenicity of P. gulae.

In the clinical portion of this study, type C P. gulae was also reduced in dogs that received clindamycin treatment.

COX-2 is the key enzyme involved in prostaglandin synthesis, and is expressed in inflammatory cells35; it is also known as a potent stimulator of bone resorption and is associated with periodontal attachment loss36. IL-8 is a key player in inflammatory conditions with a potent neutrophil recruiting and activating capacity32; it is induced in gingival epithelial cells upon exposure to several types of periodontopathic bacteria37. TGF-\u03b21 has been shown to play a critical role in anti-inflammatory signaling38, which occurs in wound healing and periodontal regeneration11. Our results indicated that P. gulae infection induced overexpression of IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, and COX-2, potentially leading to inflammation involved in deterioration of periodontal disease.",

Stimulation of immortalised human gingival epithelial cells with vesicles from P. gingivalis bacteria led to upregulation of COX-2 and IL-8 mRNA36. Additionally, stimulation with P. gulae has been shown to induce increased secretion of IL-1\u03b239. In the present study, we found that secretion and expression levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, and tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 were increased upon infection with P. gulae. These findings suggest that P. gulae infection induces mRNA expression of a wide variety of inflammatory-related proteins in Ca9-22 cells. TGF-\u03b21 mRNA and protein expression were reportedly upregulated by infection with bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Helicobacter pylori, and group A Streptococcus38,40,41. In contrast, infection of human gingival fibroblast cells with P. gingivalis resulted in an increase in mRNA expression levels of TGF-\u03b21, but did not influence the corresponding protein expression levels42. Following P. gulae infection in the present study, TGF-\u03b21 mRNA expression levels were increased, while corresponding protein expression levels were not affected; this suggested that the effects of P. gulae on TGF-\u03b21 expression were similar to those of P. gingivalis. Moreover, these findings indicate that the protein expression levels of TGF-\u03b21 may not always reflect its mRNA expression levels.",

Therefore, we examined whether a canine IFN-\u03b1 formulation could suppress inflammatory responses in gingival epithelial cells that had been infected with P. gulae. We found that the IFN-\u03b1 formulation could reduce the expression of IL-1\u03b2 and COX-2, which were upregulated by infection with fimA types A and B P. gulae strains. Furthermore, we found that clindamycin was more effective than the IFN-\u03b1 formulation against the fimA type C P. gulae strain; thus, combined use of an IFN-\u03b1 formulation and clindamycin may be effective for P. gulae strains, regardless of fimA genotype. In future studies, we plan to analyse effects of the combined use of an IFN-\u03b1 formulation and clindamycin on the expression of other cytokines and enzymes, as well as on the survival of various periodontopathogenic bacteria.",

In addition, overnight cultured P. gulae bacteria were added to the media at a density of 4 \u00d7 108 CFU/ml and then cultured at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h. Bacterial growth after incubation was measured by determining the optical density at 600 nm using a microplate reader (SH-1000 Lab, Corona Electric, Katsuta, Japan), because the number of P. gulae bacteria in a given suspension has been previously estimated by measurement of the optical density at 600 nm and subsequent extrapolation from a standard curve53. The relative ratio of growth of each P. gulae strain was calculated by comparison with the optical density at 600 nm value of each bacterial broth without clindamycin. All assays were performed in triplicate on three separate occasions (n = 9).",

After incubation, the monolayers of Ca9-22 cells were washed three times with serum-free DMEM to remove unattached cells. Additionally, the number of viable cells in each monolayer was determined using trypan blue dye exclusion and cell counting method. IFN-\u03b1 (100 \u03bcg/ml) was preincubated with Ca9-22 cells prior to addition of bacteria. Overnight cultured P. gulae were harvested and washed with sterile phosphate-buffered saline. The bacteria were then diluted to 1 \u00d7 108 CFU/ml in DMEM and used to infect Ca9-22 cells. For experiments involving bacterial infection of Ca-22 cells, we used the concept of multiplicity of infection (MOI), which is commonly defined as the ratio of infectious microorganisms to cells in a culture54. Ca9-22 cells were diluted to a density of 1 \u00d7 106 and infected with 1 \u00d7 108 CFU of respective P. gulae strains at MOI of 100 for 0\u201312 h. Then, total RNA was extracted from these P. gulae-infected Ca9-22 cells and cDNA was synthesized as described previously55. Briefly, total RNA from Ca9-22 cells was isolated using TRIsure (BIOLINE, Luckenwalde, Germany) and converted into cDNA using an iScript\u2122 cDNA Synthesis kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. cDNAs were amplified using a QuantiFast SYBR Green PCR master mix (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The primers specific for genes encoding IL-1\u03b2, COX-2, IL-8, and TGF-\u03b21, which were used in this study, are listed in Table 2. GAPDH was used as a housekeeping control and negative reverse transcription reactions were included in each assay. Expression values for mRNA were quantified by the \u0394\u0394Ct method, using GAPDH as the control. All assays were performed in triplicate on three separate occasions (n = 9).",

The schedule for clinical treatment is summarized in Fig. 3. In total, 52 dogs (28 males, 24 females; median age: 10 years [range: 1\u201315 years]) were enrolled (Table 1); all dogs received periodontal treatment under general anaesthesia. The subjects were divided into four groups with or without pharmaceutical treatments, as follows: no pharmaceutical treatment (control group; n = 12), clindamycin treatment (clindamycin group; n = 10), IFN-\u03b1 formulation treatment (IFN-\u03b1 group; n = 14), and combined clindamycin and IFN-\u03b1 formulation treatment (combination group; n = 16). In the clindamycin group, clindamycin 5 mg/kg was administered via the oral cavity twice per day, beginning 4 days before treatment and ending 3 days after periodontal treatment (a total of 7 days), in accordance with the guidelines of the American Animal Hospital Association57. In the IFN-\u03b1 group, 2.75 g of IFN-\u03b1 formulation (InterBerry\u03b1\u00ae) was applied to the gingival margin of all teeth, 10 times total over 35 days after periodontal treatment. The combination group received both clindamycin and IFN-\u03b1 formulation treatments, in accordance with the methods described above. Oral swab specimens were collected from the gingival margin of the maxillary right or left canine and fourth premolar using a micro brush (Microapplicator fine, FEED Corporation, Yokohama, Japan), as described previously24, several days before and 5 weeks after periodontal treatment.",
