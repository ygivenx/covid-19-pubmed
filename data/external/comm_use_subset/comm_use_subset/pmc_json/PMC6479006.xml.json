            "text": "Activation of protein kinase R (PKR) is a major innate immune response to viral infection. PKR is an interferon (IFN)-induced protein that is comprised of two major domains, namely, an N-terminal double-stranded RNA binding domain and a C-terminal serine/threonine kinase domain (1, 2). PKR binds to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) (3\u20135), and, once bound, it becomes activated by dimerizing and autophosphorylating (6\u20139). When activated, PKR phosphorylates eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2\u03b1 (eIF2\u03b1), causing inhibition of protein synthesis and reduced viral replication (10\u201313). Many viruses encode gene products that block PKR activation or inhibit its ability to phosphorylate eIF2\u03b1 (14). A common mechanism is that of producing a viral protein that binds and sequesters dsRNA, blocking its interaction with PKR. Examples of this are vaccinia virus E3L (15\u201317), influenza virus NS1 (18, 19), and Ebola virus protein VP35 (20). Other viruses produce proteins or RNAs that bind directly to PKR to inhibit its activation, such as herpes simplex virus US11 (21, 22), HIV-1 Tat protein (23, 24) or trans-activation response element (TAR) RNA (25), and human adenovirus (hAd) virus-associated (VA) RNAs (10, 26\u201328).",

            "text": "Degradation of PKR by viruses is a less extensively documented method of regulating PKR. To date, PKR degradation has been reported in six RNA viruses: Toscana virus (TOSV) (29), Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) (30\u201332), poliovirus (33, 34), foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) (35, 36), encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV [strain mengovirus]) (37, 38), and enterovirus 71 (39). RVFV and TOSV both degrade PKR via proteasomal mechanisms involving a viral nonstructural protein (NSs) (29, 32, 40). RVFV NSs recruits a SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box)FBXW11 E3 ubiquitin ligase to ubiquitinate PKR and target it to the proteasome, though PKR ubiquitination could not be demonstrated (32, 40). The mechanism for PKR proteasomal degradation by NSs has not been described for TOSV (29). FMDV uses the other major cellular protein degradation pathway, the lysosome, to degrade PKR during infection (36). Though the mechanism is unclear, expression of major FMDV protease 3Cpro is required for PKR degradation by the lysosome. However, 3Cpro does not interact with PKR, and its protease activity is not required for PKR degradation. Enterovirus A71 3Cpro causes PKR degradation by direct interaction (39). The mechanism of PKR depletion by poliovirus is unclear, though gene expression is required and the major poliovirus proteases (2A and 3C) are not directly involved (33). The mechanism by which mengovirus depletes PKR during infection is unknown (37, 38).",

However, MAV-1 does not produce VA RNAs (47), and whether MAV-1 induces PKR activation is not known. In our studies of MAV-1 pathogenesis and the innate response, we discovered that during MAV-1 infection, PKR was depleted from cells as early as 12 h postinfection (hpi). Total PKR mRNA levels and levels of PKR mRNA bound to polysomes were unchanged or increased during MAV-1 infection, suggesting that MAV-1 did not appear to be targeting PKR at a transcriptional or translational level. However, inhibiting the proteasome blocked the PKR depletion seen in MAV-1-infected cells, indicating that proteasomal degradation is responsible for PKR depletion during MAV-1 infection. We report results indicating that an early viral gene is likely responsible for mediating PKR degradation. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a DNA virus counteracting PKR by degrading it.",

PKR\u2212/\u2212 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) show increased viral yields compared to wild-type MEFs when infected with vesicular stomatitis virus and influenza A virus (48, 49), but there is no change in viral yield during vaccinia virus infection compared to the results seen with wild-type cells (50).

We analyzed cell lysates for the presence of PKR by immunoblotting using a polyclonal antibody that detects mouse PKR. We probed blots with antibodies to actin as a loading control. To our surprise, in C57BL/6 MEFs, PKR was almost completely depleted from lysates at 24 hpi and remained depleted through 72 hpi (Fig. 2A and B). PKR was also depleted compared to the levels seen with mock infection at 24 and 48 hpi in C57BL/6 MEFs infected at MOIs of 2 and 5 (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). We also observed depletion of PKR in other cell types. In CMT93 cells, PKR was nearly undetectable at 24 hpi (Fig. 2A). PKR levels were decreased in C57BL/6 primary peritoneal macrophages at 48 hpi compared to mock-infected lysates, and PKR was absent in infected lysates at 72 hpi (Fig. 2A).

At 24 hpi, 28% of PKR remained in K271R SV40 MEFs compared to 60% in the WT SV40 MEFs. The fraction remaining at 72 hpi in K271R SV40 MEFs was 10% compared to 30% in WT SV40 MEFs (Fig. 2C). This indicates that the PKR kinase does not have to be functional to be depleted during MAV-1 infection. Also, comparing the PKR immunoblot bands in the mock-infected WT SV40 MEFs and mutant K271R SV40 MEFs suggests that the upper band of the PKR doublet usually seen in wild-type cells is a phospho-PKR band, because only the lower band of the PKR doublet is seen in kinase-dead mutant K271R SV40 MEFs. The data in Fig. 2A and C thus indicate that both PKR and phospho-PKR are depleted during MAV-1 infection.",

We mock-infected or infected C57BL/6 MEFs and primary peritoneal macrophages at an MOI of 10 and collected cell lysates at 24, 48, and 72 hpi. We synthesized cDNA from RNA purified from these cell lysates and assayed for PKR mRNA by qPCR. The PKR mRNA levels in C57BL/6 MEFs were similar between mock-infected and infected lysates at 24 hpi (Fig. 3A), a time point at which the PKR protein levels were already greatly reduced in the infected lysates compared to mock-infected lysates (Fig. 2). Although the PKR mRNA levels were depleted 33% at 48 hpi and 40% at 72 hpi in MAV-1-infected lysates compared to mock-infected lysates, this does not correlate to the 84% and 94% reductions, respectively, in PKR protein levels seen at those time points (Fig. 2B). PKR mRNA levels in C57BL/6 primary peritoneal macrophages in the infected lysates were 2 to 3 times higher than the levels in the mock-infected lysates at all three time points assayed (Fig. 3B), even though the PKR protein was almost completely depleted in infected lysates at 72 hpi (Fig. 2). This represents evidence that MAV-1 was not causing PKR protein depletion by reducing PKR steady-state mRNA levels during infection.",

C57BL/6 MEFs were mock infected or infected at an MOI of 2, and lysates were collected at 24 hpi in the presence of cycloheximide, as described above. The levels of RNA content for mock-infected and infected lysates were estimated by NanoDrop spectrophotometry, and equivalent optical density (OD) amounts of RNA were centrifuged on 10% to 50% sucrose gradients to sediment 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits, 80S ribosomes (monosomes), and polyribosomes (polysomes). A typical polysome profile was obtained (Fig. 4B). RNA was purified from fractions containing monosomes and polysomes and then used to generate cDNA, which we assayed for PKR mRNA by qPCR (Fig. 4C). As a control, GAPDH mRNA was measured by qPCR, and PKR mRNA levels in each fraction were normalized to the GAPDH mRNA content. When the data representing the percentages of PKR mRNA bound to ribosomes were pooled into monosome and polysome fractions and analyzed (Fig. 4D), 90.1% and 91.8% were bound to polysomes (fractions 7 to 19) for mock-infected and infected samples, respectively, compared to 9.9% and 8.2% bound to monosomes (fractions 1 to 6).

To rule out the possibility that PKR was present (not depleted) because the virus infection itself was inhibited by MG132 or bortezomib, we assayed viral replication of MAV-1 with MG132 and bortezomib treatment by qPCR of viral DNA. Viral replication levels were equivalent in all three treatment groups (Fig. S4), indicating that the treatments did not affect the ability of the virus to productively infect the cells. Taken together, these data indicate that MAV-1 infection results in PKR depletion by causing PKR to be degraded by the proteasome during infection.",

After 24 h of cycloheximide treatment, approximately 90% of the starting levels of PKR protein remained (Fig. 7A, bottom, and 7B). Comparing the results from MAV-1 infection (Fig. 7A, top, and 7B) and cycloheximide treatment of uninfected cells (Fig. 7A, bottom, and 7B), we conclude that MAV-1 was actively depleting PKR protein early in infection. E1A was detected by immunoblotting at 18 hpi (Fig. 7C), whereas viral DNA replication was first detected at 24 hpi in CMT93 cells (Fig. S6).

We collected lysates at 20 and 40 hpi and analyzed them by immunoblotting. We confirmed that araC treatment resulted in no late protein synthesis by immunoblotting for late virion proteins (Fig. S8).

While hAds produce VA RNAs that inhibit PKR antiviral activity during infection (10, 71), MAV-1 does not produce such VA RNAs, and how MAV-1 infection is affected by PKR is first described in this report. When we infected PKR\u2212/\u2212 MEFs with MAV-1, viral DNA yields were 5 to 6 times higher than the viral DNA yields from wild-type MEFs (Fig. 1), indicating that PKR plays an antiviral role during MAV-1 infection. The viral DNA yield from the N-PKR\u2212/\u2212 MEFs was nearly 4 times higher than the yield from the C-PKR\u2212/\u2212 MEFs at 48 hpi, but by 72 hpi the viral DNA yields from the two types of PKR\u2212/\u2212 MEFs were similar to each other and were significantly increased compared to the yield seen with wild-type MEFs (Fig. 1). This difference in viral replication kinetics between the two types of PKR\u2212/\u2212 MEFs may be due to differences in the expression and activity levels of the PKR fragments reportedly produced by them; we have not assayed PKR fragment production in our cells.",

While the PKR mRNAs in C57BL/6 MEFs were depleted 33% at 48 hpi and 40% at 72 hpi compared to mock-infected lysates, this was not sufficient to explain the 84% and 94% reductions, respectively, in PKR protein levels at those time points (Fig. 2B). More likely, the reduction in PKR steady-state mRNA levels at the late infection time points can be attributed to other effects from viral infection, including the degradation or inhibition of proteins that induce PKR expression. For example, p53 is capable of binding to the PKR promoter and inducing its expression (72), but MAV-1 proteins cause p53 proteolysis (65). Together, our results from C57BL/6 MEFs and macrophages suggest that the virus does not cause PKR protein depletion by reducing PKR steady-state mRNA levels.",

PKR protein took almost 3 times as long to be completely degraded during infection in macrophages than in MEFs (72 h versus 24 h) (Fig. 2A). Total PKR mRNA levels were 2 to 3 times higher in MAV-1-infected macrophages than in mock-infected macrophages, unlike the MEFs, where total PKR mRNA levels were unchanged or were reduced 33% to 40% during MAV-1-infection compared to the mock-infected MEFs. Since PKR is an IFN-stimulated gene (1, 2), the higher levels of total PKR mRNA seen during infection in the macrophages suggest IFN induction. This suggests that the immune response mounted by the macrophages was greater than the immune response in the MEFs and could help explain why PKR took longer to degrade in macrophages than in MEFs.",

This indicates that PKR is degraded not by lysosomal degradation during viral infection but by proteasomal degradation. Though PKR degradation was due to proteasome activity during MAV-1 infection, we were unable to demonstrate PKR ubiquitination, although we did detect ubiquitination of mouse p53 (see Fig. S5 in the supplemental material). This inability to demonstrate PKR ubiquitination could be explained if at any given moment there were only low levels of ubiquitinated PKR present in the cell. Perhaps increasing the time spent under conditions of MG132 treatment could increase the amounts of ubiquitinated proteins enough that PKR ubiquitination could be seen. However, our inability to detect ubiquitinated PKR is consistent with a similar inability to identify PKR ubiquitination by RVFV NSs, even though NSs is known to recruit an E3 ligase to PKR (32). Alternatively, it is possible that in MAV-1 infection, PKR is degraded in a ubiquitin-independent manner, possibly because of the presence of intrinsic disordered regions of PKR or binding of regulating proteins to PKR that target proteins to the proteasome (73, 74).",

            "text": "Our experiments indicated that MAV-1 actively depletes PKR early in infection. Ongoing experiments are focused on determining the MAV-1 early protein(s) responsible for PKR degradation. Two possibilities are represented by E4 proteins, the homologs of hAd E4orf6 and E4orf3, which we originally termed E4orfa/b and E4orfa/c, respectively (75). In human adenovirus, E4orf6 interacts with another early hAd protein, E1B 55K, to participate in an E3 ligase complex that ubiquitinates and degrades p53 via proteasomal degradation (76, 77). When MAV-1 E4orf6, E1B 55K, and mouse p53 are introduced by transfection into human cells, all three proteins interact and mouse p53 is degraded (65). If MAV-1 E4orf6 and E1B 55K form a similar complex in mouse cells, it may also degrade PKR. We have preliminary evidence indicating that mouse p53 is ubiquitinated in C57BL/6 MEFs during MAV-1 infection, which suggests that the mouse p53 degradation seen in human cells could be paralleled by degradation of endogenous mouse p53 and mouse PKR in mouse cells, mediated by MAV-1 E4orf6 and E1B 55K during infection. Another hAd E4 protein, E4orf3, causes proteasomal degradation of transcriptional intermediary factor 1\u03b3 (78) and general transcription factor II-I (79) in a manner independent of hAd E4orf6 and E1B 55K. E4orf3 has SUMO E3 ligase and E4 elongase activity and induces sumoylation of general transcription factor II-I, leading to its proteasome-dependent degradation (79). MAV-1 E4orf3 may similarly have sumoylation activity that results ultimately in proteasome-dependent PKR degradation. Another possibility of a viral protein involved in PKR degradation is the protease encoded by MAV-1. The hAd protease is encapsidated in virions and proteolytically processes viral proteins IIIa, VI, VII, VIII, mu, and TP (80\u201383). However, we think it is unlikely that the MAV-1 protease degrades PKR, because we showed that UV-inactivated virus was unable to degrade PKR. We assume that UV treatment would not destroy the MAV-1 protease activity, just as HSV-1 VP16 activity is not altered by UV inactivation of HSV-1 (84), but we have not tested this directly.",

Analysis of global PKR steady-state protein levels during infection showed complete PKR depletion by 72 hpi in multiple cell types, including immortalized and primary cells, with even faster kinetics in some. PKR transcription and translation were not decreased by MAV-1 infection, whereas proteasomal inhibition prevented PKR degradation. Taken together, these data suggest that MAV-1 causes PKR to be proteasomally degraded at a posttranslational level. This work provides new insight into possible mechanisms of adenovirus inhibition of PKR by DNA viruses. PKR degradation may be induced by other adenoviruses that do not produce VA RNA, which includes all animal adenoviruses except primate adenoviruses and one type of fowl adenovirus (85).",
