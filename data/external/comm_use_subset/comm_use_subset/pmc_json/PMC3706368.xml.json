            "text": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma [1]. Infection with HCV is also etiologically involved in the development of B-cell lymphomas [2]. This virus belongs to the genus Hepacivirus in the family Flaviviridae. The HCV genome is a single, positive-stranded RNA with a nucleotide length of about 9.6 kb. It encodes a polyprotein precursor of approximately 3,000 amino acids. This polyprotein precursor is processed by host and viral proteases into at least 10 different proteins, which are arranged in the order of NH2-C-E1-E2-p7-NS2-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5A-NS5B-COOH. C, E1, and E2 are structural proteins while NS2-NS5B and perhaps also p7 are non-structural proteins. The release of C, E1, E2 and, p7 from the polyprotein is mediated by the cellular signal peptidase located in the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas the cleavages between NS2-NS5B are mediated by viral NS2/3 and NS3/4A proteases. NS3 protein contains a serine protease activity within its N-terminal 180 residues and NTPase and helicase activities in the C-terminus (for a review, [3]). Molecular mechanisms regarding HCV pathogenesis are not well understood. It has been demonstrated that HCV NS3 protein is involved in cell transformation [4], [5]. To further understand the functions of the HCV NS3 protein, we have conducted a yeast two-hybrid screening experiment to identify the cellular proteins interacting with HCV NS3 protein. Our results indicated that the cytosolic 5\u2032(3\u2032)-deoxyribonucleotidase (cdN, dNT-1) interacts with HCV NS3 protein [6], [7]. We further demonstrated that this interaction can result in the partial repression of the cdN activity.",

To isolate the cDNA fragment that contains the NS3/4A protein coding sequence, polymerase chain reactions (PCR) using primers (5\u2032CGGGATCCGCGCCCATCACGGCGTAC 3\u2032and 5\u2032GCTCTAGACTATTAGCACTCTTCCATCTC3\u2032) were performed. After PCR, the DNA fragment was digested with restriction enzymes (BamHI/XbaI) and inserted into the pcDNA3-myc vector for transient expression in mammalian cells [8]. To clone the DNA fragment encoding HCV NS3 protein (full-length, from a.a. 1 to 631) for yeast two-hybrid screening, oligonucleotide primers (5\u2032GGAATTCGCGCCCATCACGGCG3\u2032and 5\u2032GCTCTAGACTATTACGTGACGACCTCCAG3\u2032) were used to perform PCR. After PCR, the DNA fragment was treated with T4 polynucleotide kinase, digested with the restriction enzyme EcoRI, and cloned into the pBDGal4 Cam (Stratagene, USA) expression vector, which had been linearized with EcoRI and SmaI. Similar approaches were used to clone the DNA fragment encoding HCV NS3 protease domain (from a.a. 1 to a.a. 208) for yeast two-hybrid screening experiments except the oligonucleotide (5\u2032GCTCTAGATTAGCTGCCGGTGGGAGC3\u2032) was used as the reverse primer to perform PCR.

The assay analyzing the dUMP dephosphorylation measures both cdN and mdN activities [15]. To determine the individual contribution of these two proteins in the analysis, shRNA knockdown experiments were performed. When cdN expression was reduced to about 23% by shRNA, the dephosphorylation of dUMP was reduced to about 50% (Fig. 4B). On the other hand, when mdN expression was knocked-down to 27% by shRNA, the dephosphorylation of dUMP was only reduced to 89% (Fig. 4C).

The NS5A protein amount was also used to reflect the NS3 protein amount since the expression of these two proteins correlates very well in HCV replicon cells [23]. The 5\u2032(3\u2032)-deoxyribonucleotidase activity was 1.5-fold higher in 103 U/ml interferon treated replicon cells than that of non-treated cells (Fig. 6B) while the amount of cdN protein remained almost the same (Fig. 6A). Moreover, the 5\u2032(3\u2032)-deoxyribonucleotidase activity was three fold higher in 104 U/ml-interferon treated replicon cells than that of non-treated cells (Fig. 6B) while the amount of cdN protein remained at the same level (Fig. 6A).

The intracellular dNTPs pools in mammalian cells are regulated by substrate cycles. Substrate cycles depend on the interplay between a deoxynucleoside kinase and a nucleotidase [25], [26]. Nucleoside monophosphate phosphohydrases or 5\u2032-nucleotidases dephosphorylate non-cyclic nucleoside monophosphate to nucleosides and inorganic phosphates. At least seven 5\u2032-nucleotidases with different subcellular localization have been cloned [19]. Some 5\u2032-nucleotidases are ubiquitous (eN, cN-II, cdN, and mdN) while others display tissue-specific expression (cN-I and cN-III). All 5\u2032-nucleotidases have relatively broad substrate specificities. Detection of individual nucleotidases by enzymatic assays in cell lysates is problematic because different nucleotidases are co-expressed in the same tissue or cell type. cdN is first purified to homogeneity from human placenta [6]. Our results (Fig. 4) showed that cdN contributed more than mdN to the total cellular 5\u2032(3\u2032)-deoxyribonucleotidase activity, which is consistent to previous reports demonstrating that cdN is responsible for the major 5\u2032(3\u2032)-deoxyribonucleotidase activity in cultured human cells [15], [27].",

HCV NS3 protein is involved in cell transformation. The serine protease domain of NS3 protein is responsible for the cell transformation [4], [5]. HCV NS3 protein derived from certain genotypes has been demonstrated to generate an internally cleaved product containing the protease domain [28], [29]. Our results demonstrated that HCV NS3 protein interacts with cellular cdN protein (Figs 1 to 3), and the protease domain of NS3 was mapped for this interaction. Therefore, our results suggested that the pathogenesis induced by NS3 or its internally cleaved product may be mediated by binding to cdN protein and inhibiting its activity.",

We further showed that HCV repressed the 5\u2032(3\u2032)-deoxyribonucleotidase activity to 65% but did not affect the level of cdN protein expression (Fig. 7). Therefore, we concluded that HCV down-regulated cdN activity, and this inhibitory effect is more pronounced in HCV replicons than in HCV infected cells due to the greater amount of NS3 protein in HCV replicon cells. Thus, attenuating cellular 5\u2032(3\u2032)-deoxyribonucleotidase activity may be a strategy for HCV to benefit its replication. However, neither over-expression nor knockdown of cdN gene affected HCV replication (Fig. 8). The biologic meaning of attenuating cellular 5\u2032(3\u2032)-deoxyribonucleotidase activity in HCV-infected cells awaits further investigation. Interestingly, the ecto-5\u2032nucleotidase activity in B lymphocytes was low in HIV-infected patients [30].",
