Most animal pathogens can infect multiple host species, and pathogen spillover from one host species to another is common [2]. Pathogen spillover has been defined as scenarios in which disease occurrence in a focal population depends on a distinct reservoir source that maintains the pathogen indefinitely [3]. Thus, controlling spillover diseases is complicated by the need to manage not only cases in the target population but also transmission interfaces and reservoir populations. Broadly, a disease reservoir is the source of new cases in a target population. A better understanding of the types of species that form reservoirs will therefore facilitate the management of many emerging infectious diseases.",

Ungulates, carnivores, and rodents are the source of most zoonoses [2], yet recent outbreaks suggest that bats may be a uniquely important reservoir of human pathogens [8,10]. Reservoir species with fast life history characteristics appear to have higher reservoir competence [11] and contribute disproportionately to cases of some zoonotic diseases [12,13]. In a study of reservoirs for tick-borne zoonotic diseases, the mammalian species with the fastest life history traits also exhibited the highest reservoir competence [13]. Species with high reproductive output produce a large number of na\u00efve host individuals that can sustain pathogens, even those that induce long-lasting host immunity. For example, the persistence of classical swine fever in pigs and wild boar has been attributed, in part, to high birth rates that maintain a large population of susceptible individuals [14]. Further, because of trade-offs between pace of life and the immune system investment, fast-lived species may exhibit greater reservoir competence through a proneness to acquire, maintain, and transmit pathogens [15,16].",

And 3) Are mammalian reservoir species distinct in their life history traits compared to all mammals? Given the strong research bias in favor of human and domestic animal pathogens, we expect that most known disease reservoirs will include mammals. We also hypothesize that, more often than not, reservoirs will include multiple species and wildlife. Because past studies suggested that faster-lived species may be more competent hosts, we predict that reservoir species will exhibit faster life histories.",

Searches were conducted using Google Scholar and PubMed with search terms including the scientific names and synonyms of pathogens along with one or more of the following terms: reservoir, reservoir host, epidemiology, ecology, source, spillover, cases, host range, outbreak, and epidemic. We included any pathogen that spills over from one or more non-human animal species to another and causes clinical disease in the recipient (target) species. If, in addition to requiring an animal reservoir host, the pathogen also requires time developing in an external environment, then the environment was included as part of the reservoir. Each record in the resulting database is a unique combination of pathogen, target, reservoir, and geographic region, and is henceforth termed a \u201cdisease system.\u201d Disease systems were excluded if there was weak or disputed evidence for the ability of the pathogen to cause disease in the target. For example, Sangassou virus, a recently discovered hantavirus in West Africa, has been found in its rodent host and neutralizing antibodies have been found in human fever patients; however, it was excluded from our analysis because the evidence remains inconclusive that it is the cause of human disease [20]. We also excluded any disease system for which the loss of the reservoir would not be likely to eliminate disease in the target because, following established definitions of reservoir and spillover, this could not truly be a reservoir. This most often occurred when spillover was well documented, but populations of the target species alone were sufficient for pathogen persistence.",

For example, most species of hantavirus were found to only depend on a single rodent species for persistence. If genetic evidence suggests distinct pathogen populations amongst different reservoir host populations, the pathogen may be maintained by multiple, single species reservoirs. In contrast, multiple species reservoirs comprise a community of more than one host species where the chronological order in which hosts acquire infection does not affect reservoir capacity and pathogen populations are not distinct between host species within the community. Trypanosoma cruzi uses a multiple species reservoir of sympatric opossums, armadillos, and coatis that together maintain a single pathogen population. A pathogen maintained by a complex reservoir completes each generation across multiple species and/or environments in a chronological order. Complex reservoirs are common to many helminth and protozoan parasites. This is illustrated by the life cycle of Toxoplasma gondii, which requires a suitable external environment, followed by a rodent host, followed by a feline host.",

We inferred the most likely zone for each disease system based on evidence of intraspecific transmission in the target species. We gathered evidence through a literature search focused on epidemiology, transmission, and reports of cases and outbreaks. We aimed to assign the system to the zone that best describes the normal pattern of transmission following spillover. For example, if most spillover events result in a single case, but abnormal secondary transmission events are reported, the system was classified as dead-end. This was the case for many dead-end pathogens transmitted to humans, but for which occasional nosocomial or transplant-associated transmissions are known.",

Recognizing that PanTHERIA is incomplete and biased towards well-studied taxa, we augmented our database using other compilations of mammalian life history data [29\u201333]. Male and female ages at sexual maturity are reported separately in the AnAge database [33] but were averaged for inclusion in our dataset. For any species with missing data for all ten life history traits, we searched the literature for adult body mass, which is correlated with the other traits [34].

Neonate body mass and gestation length both have relatively strong negative loadings on PC2, indicating that negative scores on this axis represent a longer gestation length that results in larger neonate body mass (Table 6).

Intuitively, one might expect that there are some features shared among reservoirs that not only enhance their ability to serve as hosts but also their tendency to be involved in pathogen spillover. While anecdotes and simple summaries indicate that rodents, bats, ungulates, and domestic animals are common sources of human disease, our analysis sought to include spillover pathogens affecting other animals as well. In addition, we aimed to account for publication biases and other attributes of the data that could skew inferences. Further, we investigated whether exceptional life history traits may underlie a mechanism by which reservoirs are associated with spillover. We find that most reservoirs of spillover pathogens include wild animals, include mammals, and are made up of a community. We found more artiodactyl and carnivore and fewer bat and primate species to be reservoir hosts than expected by chance. These findings may signify characteristics of these orders that predispose or prevent them from serving as reservoirs. High priority zoonotic pathogens are more likely to have avian reservoirs, while among pathogens with epidemic potential in the target population, primates are overrepresented despite being relatively uncommon reservoir hosts in general. Finally, compared to mammals overall, mammalian reservoir hosts tend to have faster mass-corrected life history characteristics, specifically those associated with high reproductive output rather than long-term survival.",

For example, rather than simply equating natural infection with reservoir status, we sought evidence that would satisfy both parts of the Haydon et al. [6] definition. We made every effort to seek all available evidence for inconclusive cases but made some partially subjective decisions to exclude disease systems on the basis of insufficient data. We felt justified in these decisions since inclusion of disease systems based on weak or even incorrect data could bias our interpretations more than using a sparser (although possibly non-representative) dataset that included disease systems and host species that have received more extensive research attention.",

For example, one disease system that appears to involve a multiple species reservoir could actually include multiple cryptic disease cycles, each with only one reservoir host species. Indeed, multiple species may overlap in space and act as independent reservoirs without sharing the pathogen, as for cowpox virus in England where both bank voles (Myodes glareolus) and wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) serve as distinct, sympatric, single species reservoirs [47]. Alternatively, pathogens we report to have single species reservoirs may in fact depend on multiple species, some of which remain undocumented as hosts. Over half of the reservoirs in our database were classified as multiple species or complex, and two-thirds of disease systems were community-dependent. Our data therefore suggest that most spillover pathogens rely on a community rather than a single species, an idea recently proposed by Brisson et al. [48].",

Similarly, the association of artiodactyl livestock and domestic carnivores with humans likely drives their orders\u2019 high representations among reservoirs, and some pathogens appear to have evolved to exploit the close contact between humans and livestock [49]. Known pathogens of livestock and domestic carnivores are often implicated in spillover events [2], and artificial selection for increased production in livestock can modify life history traits such that domestic species may be more likely to serve as pathogen reservoirs [50]. Finally, livestock species are kept in high densities, enabling rapid disease spread that can cause significant economic losses and attract increased attention from the scientific community.",

In contrast, we found that rodents are the most common mammalian reservoir hosts for zoonotic pathogens (Table 5). This discrepancy may be due to a difference in methodology. Reservoirs were designated as such in previous studies simply based on natural infection. For a given pathogen, evidence of natural infection in a dog, cat, or domestic ungulate is more likely than in other species, including wildlife, owing to the significant research attention given to domestic animals. In contrast, the present study used more stringent criteria for reservoir designation, which resulted in the identification of non-domestic taxa as important zoonotic pathogen reservoirs. However, the use of these criteria limited our sample size because hundreds of systems with weak evidence were excluded (S2 Dataset).

            "text": "Our analysis of life history traits in relation to reservoir status differed from past studies in two important ways. First, we examined mass-independent variation along the fast-slow life history continuum. Most life history traits are significantly correlated with body mass [34], with small species exhibiting greater reproductive output and faster developmental timing than larger species. By including all mammals listed in Mammal Species of the World [22], we covered a 108-fold variation in mass between the smallest and largest species [31]. Controlling for mass, we found that the relationship between pace of life and reservoir status persisted. Second, we chose to impute missing values in an incomplete trait database rather than only analyzing species with complete trait data. Although imputing missing life history data leads to more accurate inference [39], collection of more empirical data on life history traits would be preferable. Life history traits may influence species\u2019 abilities to occupy diverse environments. For example, birds in urbanized habitats appear to be especially fecund [54,55]. Traits associated with reservoir status (e.g., large litter size) may therefore characterize species that are also tolerant of anthropogenic habitat modification. The human population is growing, and disease emergence events have already been linked to anthropogenic disturbances [56]. If the same suite of life history traits predicts both reservoir status and urban adaptability, urban development may inadvertently select for biological communities enriched in pathogen reservoirs.",

Critically, our analysis focused on systems in which the reservoirs we identified are completely sufficient to maintain pathogens and are necessary for continued disease incidence in the target population. In such cases, management of the interspecies transmission interface and reservoir populations may prevent new cases. Diverse reservoir communities and their transmission dynamics may complicate disease management. For example, a transient or uncommon host species may act as a reservoir in the absence of a more permissive species [58]. Thus, control of the primary reservoir host may not effectively reduce disease burden and could, in fact, spread the pathogen to a new host. Effective management strategies therefore depend upon careful study of potential hidden reservoirs in disease systems of interest. We encourage future work that expands upon our database and seeks to identify new patterns to help understand infectious disease cycles.",
