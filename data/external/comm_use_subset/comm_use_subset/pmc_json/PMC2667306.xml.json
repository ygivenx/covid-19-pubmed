(2006) described a mutant with a Ds insertion in AtPSKR1 (pskr1-1), and found that callus derived from the mutant was less sensitive to the growth-promoting effects of PSK in culture. However, they observed little difference in overall plant growth between wild-type, pskr1-1 and AtPSKR1ox, an over-expression line. The most prominent characteristic of pskr1-1 was that vegetative tissues in mature plants lost their ability to form callus. Unlike wild-type plants, leaf discs from the fully expanded leaves of pskr1-1 plants were less capable of producing callus, while unexpanded leaves retained callus-forming capacity. AtPSKR1 over-expressing plants (AtPSKR1ox) showed delayed senescence, and, as a result, leaves continued to expand, resulting in larger leaves than the wild-type.",

Di-basic residues are characteristic of substrate sites for subtilases, subtilisin-like serine proteases (Barr, 1991); therefore, we wished to determine whether any of the proteases encoded by the 56 subtilase genes in the Arabidopsis genome (Rautengarten et al., 2005) are responsible for cleavage of the AtPSK4 precursor. In doing so, we identified a subtilase, AtSBT1.1, that is required for cleavage of the fusion protein AtPSK4\u2013myc. Cleavage of AtPSK4\u2013myc is induced in root explants, suggesting that release of the peptide hormone from the precursor protein is controlled, in part, by the proteolytic processing machinery.",

It was not clear what the causal connection might be between efficient shoot regeneration and expression of a gene encoding a serine protease. Most subtilases are predicted to be secreted proteins (Rautengarten et al., 2005), so we reasoned that AtSBT1.1 could be involved in processing of an extracellular growth factor or receptor related to shoot regeneration. Growth factors that might require the action of AtSBT1.1 include peptide hormones, such as AtPSKs. AtPSKs promote callus formation in tissue culture (Matsubayashi and Sakagami, 2006), and are synthesized as preproproteins with signal peptides that target them to the secretory pathway and with prosequences that are processed during maturation of the peptide hormone.",

PreproAtPSK4 will be referred to as ppAtPSK4 and proAtPSK4 as pAtPSK4. AtPSK4 was chosen for study because it is the most abundantly expressed PSK precursor (Matsubayashi and Sakagami, 2006). The predicted size of pAtPSK4 with the myc tag is 12.8 kDa, but we observed a band at approximately 19 kDa on Western blots, larger than the predicted size (Figure 1a, wt, 0 time). To demonstrate, nonetheless, that this band is pAtPSK4\u2013myc, we analyzed the partially purified myc-tagged protein and identified three peptides derived from the fusion protein by MS/MS analysis (Figure S1). Thus, the larger apparent size of pAtPSK4\u2013myc may be due to anomalous gel migration behavior or post-translational modification of part of the precursor protein.",

We suspected that failure to detect processing may have been due to seedling growth or culture conditions. We had chosen to study AtSBT1.1 in the first place due to observations that we had made about shoot regeneration from root explants (Lall et al., 2004). Therefore, we subjected root explants from 35S:ppAtPSK4-myc seedlings to tissue culture conditions for regenerating shoots. This involves pre-incubating root segments on an auxin-rich callus induction medium (CIM), and then transferring them after 4 days to a cytokinin-rich shoot induction medium (SIM). Under these conditions, a band appeared at approximately 7 kDa in Western blots (Figure 1a, wt, lanes 1d and 4d CIM or SIM), representing the myc-tagged cleaved peptide, AtPSK4\u2013myc. The size of the processed protein was consistent with a cut at or near the cleavage site as determined by the in vitro experiments described below. Thus, cleavage of pAtPSK4\u2013myc appears to be induced by some aspect of the culturing process.",

To do so, we examined cleavage of pAtPSK4\u2013myc in T-DNA mutants with insertions in AtSBT1.1. The gene encoding AtSBT1.1 (At1g01900) has a single intron, and sbt1.1-1 (SALK_111561) and sbt1.1-2 (SALK_108704) have T-DNA insertions in the first exon. The T-DNA lines were judged to be null mutants because AtSBT1.1 transcripts were not found in seedlings from either line (Figure S2). The 35S:ppAtPSK4-myc construct was introduced into the two T-DNA mutant lines, and root explants were subjected to regeneration conditions (4 days incubation on CIM). The pAtPSK4\u2013myc precursor was produced in these lines, but the cleavage product AtPSK4\u2013myc peptide was not detected (Figure 1a, lanes sbt1.1-1 and sbt1.1-2). To demonstrate that the transgenic product in these lines was still cleavable, we out-crossed sbt1.1-1 bearing the 35S:ppAtPSK4-myc construct to wild-type, and demonstrated that processing was restored in root explants of the F1 seedlings (Figure S3). We concluded from these results that AtSBT1.1 is required for pAtPSK4\u2013myc cleavage under these conditions. This finding is quite significant given that there are 56 different subtilases encoded by the Arabidopsis genome (Rautengarten et al., 2005).",

We concluded that the processing activity was probably induced by the wounding or handling of root tissue during explanting. We then determined how rapidly processing was induced. Cleavage of pAtPSK4\u2013myc was first detected approximately 8 h after explanting (Figure 1c).

Prohormone convertases are subtilases in the secretory pathway that cleave substrates with mono- or di-basic amino acids in the general recognition motif R/K-Xn-R/K\u2193 (Seidah, 1997). In Arabidopsis, AtSBT1.1 cleaves substrates in a fairly site-specific manner, cleaving pAtPSK4 at RRSLVL\u2193HTDY and showing preference for cleavage of proAtPSK4 over other PSK precursors. Cleavage by AtSBT1.1 at the preferred cleavage site of the PSK4 precursor leaves three residues on the N-terminus of the five-residue peptide. This is of concern because Matsubayashi et al. (1996) demonstrated that even the presence of the tripeptide GGG severely reduces the activity of PSKs in an asparagus suspension cell system However, the three residues (HTD) remaining on the amino-end of AtSBT1.1-processed AtPSK4 are highly conserved among the PSKs, and it is possible that the sequence is part of the active, mature peptide or serves as a recognition signal for further processing by enzymes such as tripeptyl peptidases (Book et al., 2005).

Presumably, the peptides encoded by each gene should be able to bind and activate the single known receptor, AtPSKR1 (Matsubayashi et al., 2006). Each of the AtPSK precursors has the typical subtilase recognition site signature (di-basic amino acids) 8-10 residues upstream from the mature peptide (Barr, 1991). However, the residues that are critical for AtSBT1.1 recognition (the four or five residues just downstream from the di-basic site) differ somewhat between AtPSK genes, and therefore AtSBT1.1 appears to be most specific for cleavage of PSK4. That suggests that other subtilases might be involved in the processing of other PSKs.",

We found that higher expression levels of the gene encoding AtSBT1.1 (At1g01900) correlated with the presence of the superior allele at the major QTL conditioning shoot regeneration in Arabidopsis tissue culture (Lall et al., 2004). Higher levels of AtSBT1.1 expression may not have anything to do directly with shoot regeneration. However, higher levels of AtSBT1.1 expression might promote the proliferation of callus from which shoots are derived. Similar reasoning was used by Hanai et al. (2000) to explain the stimulatory effects of PSKs on somatic embryo formation in carrot. They concluded that PSKs might promote the proliferation of cells giving rise to somatic embryos, rather than influencing the formation of somatic embryos.",
