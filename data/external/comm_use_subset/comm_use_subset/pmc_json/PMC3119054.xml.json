This might result in an individual researcher has to do a query at each data source. What's more, these data sources are very possible to have different entries, data formats, query options, and complex results [3].",

Cadag and Tarczy-Hornoch address diverse data retrieval via a simple framework for representing coverage and evidence that operates in parallel with an arbitrary schema, and a language upon which queries on the schema and framework may be executed [4]. Gouy and Delmotte proposes a biological sequence database system named ACNUC, which is able to provide powerful and fast query and extraction capabilities to a variety of nucleotide and protein sequence databases [5]. Lacroix presents a tool to query integrated web data sources composed of a retrieval component based on an intermediate object view mechanism and search views, and an XML engine [6]. Some efforts are done on the integration of biological data available on the web and maintained in diverse sources [7], [8], [9], [10], [11].",

Moreover, the existing approaches are not designed to address the remote data retrieval in a mobile network environment, which is welcome by more and more researchers, with the rapid development speed of mobile networks.

Upon the resource layer, the agent environment layer provides a bunch of low-level functional modules which can help agents fully use the resources. The low-level functional modules include local resource management, local security, message transport, class loader, and concurrency. Then upon the low-level functional modules, the agent environment layer provides a set of general-purpose runtime services that are frequently used by agents, including naming service, sensing service, security authentication service, persistency service, and agent migration service. These services alleviate agents from low-level operations and allow agents to be lightweight by separating them from some routine work. This layer of the proposed multi-agent system is implemented based on the ENGM platform. The discussion on design philosophy, layer analysis, service design, functional merits and message-based communication of the ENGM system is beyond the scope of this paper.
