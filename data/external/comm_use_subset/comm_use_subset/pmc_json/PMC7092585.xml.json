            "text": "Bordetella bronchiseptica, a Gram-negative, aerobic, coccobacillus, is regarded as one of the principal pathogens involved in canine infectious respiratory disease complex (CIRD-C) [1\u20134]. Its prevalence in dogs with infectious respiratory diseases ranges from 5.2 to 78.7% [2, 4\u20136]. According to the taxonomical classification, the bacterium B. bronchiseptica belongs to the Proteobacteria phylum, the Alcaligenaceae family and the Bordetella genus [7]. CIRD-C or formerly \u201ckennel cough\u201d is considered as one of the most common infectious diseases in dogs worldwide despite vaccination, and affects mostly young and kennel dogs [8]. Viruses such as canine adenovirus, canine distemper virus, canine parainfluenza virus, canine respiratory coronavirus, pneumovirus and influenza A virus and bacteria other than B. bronchiseptica such as Mycoplasma cynos and Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidermicus are primary infectious agents involved in the complex [4, 8]. Because of the numerous infectious etiologies as well as possible co-infections, clinical signs of CIRD-C are highly variable and difficult to predict ranging from mild illness to severe pneumonia or death [8]. Among the bacteria, Mycoplasma cynos, a Gram-negative organism is considered as an emerging bacterium in CIRD-C [4, 9]. This bacterium belongs to the Tenericutes phylum, the Mycoplasmataceae family and the Mycoplasma genus [10]. The diagnosis of B. bronchiseptica infection can be confirmed either by culture or by specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) on various samples including bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). The bacteria can also be observed on cytological preparations, adhering to the top of the cilia of respiratory epithelial cells [1]. The treatment against B. bronchiseptica can be challenging as the bacterium is localized at the top of the cilia, can adopt a biofilm lifestyle and may drive an immunosuppressive response [11\u201315]. In such cases, classical oral or parenteral antimicrobial drug may not be sufficient even if in vitro susceptibility is shown [16]. Recently, it has been shown that gentamycin nebulization was helpful to achieve therapeutic concentration on the apical surface of bronchial epithelium, mostly when classical antimicrobial drugs failed to be curative [17\u201319].",

            "text": "The 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing is a technique less sensitive than a qPCR but which allows rapid and accurate identification of all the bacteria composing the microbiota, which refers to the global microbial population of an area, including rare, unknown, slow-growing and unculturable bacteria [20\u201323]. Moreover, this technique allows to highlight the complexity of the microbial populations and their alterations in disease processes [20, 23]. In man, the 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing is increasingly being used in clinical contexts such as in acute pneumonia. Acute pneumonia is considered as an abrupt, emergent phenomenon with the predominance of specific taxonomic groups, low microbial diversity and high bacterial load [24\u201326]. Studies in acute pneumonia indicate that the 16S rDNA sequencing improves the microbiological yield and could help to guide antimicrobial therapy [20, 27]. In dogs, the lung microbiota (LM) has only been studied in bacterial secondary or community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and only few data are available in experimental healthy beagles [28\u201330] and healthy dogs from other breeds [31]. In dogs with pneumonia, a dysbiosis of the LM was observed with the loss of bacteria found in health and the domination, mostly in CAP, of one or two bacteria [30]. Moreover a good agreement was found between the results of 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing and culture, although some discrepancies concerning the number of unique taxa identified and presence or absence of predominating taxa were noticed [30]. Results suggest that the 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing could be useful for causal bacteria detection in parallel with culture, mostly if culture is negative [30].",

Despite their implication in CIRD-C, B. bronchiseptica and M. cynos are commensal bacteria found in the respiratory tract of healthy dogs [1, 4, 8]. In the present study, the amplicon sequencing technique detected B. bronchiseptica at very low level in 1 healthy dog, in which qPCR revealed a very low load. The absence of dysbiosis associated with the presence of B. bronchiseptica at a very low level in that dog, corroborates the fact that this bacterium is a commensal bacterium which is not always associated with lung disease [1, 4, 8]. The amplicon sequencing technique also detected M. cynos in low relative abundance in 3 of the healthy dogs, while qPCR results were negative. Since different aliquots from a same initial sample of BALF were used for qPCR and amplicon sequencing technique, a lack of homogeneity between the aliquots could explain this slight discrepancy.",

The Proteobacteria and the Tenericutes phylum were more abundant in the diseased dogs, logically reflecting an increased prevalence of Bordetella and Mycoplasma. The incapacity to show significant differences between healthy and diseased dogs at the species level was probably due to a lack of power in the statistical tests related to the low number of control dogs included in the study as well as to the high number of data (10 000 sequences per sample). Indeed, large dataset requires more severe corrections for multiple tests [39]. In dogs affected with B. bronchiseptica infection, in comparison with heathy dogs, the LM was composed in majority by only one or two bacteria, a finding that has also been reported in dogs with CAP [30]. In pneumonia in man, the dominant pathogenic strain also usually represents the majority of the detected sequences (74% or more) [24]; a low alpha-diversity and low richness reflecting the high predominance of one or two bacteria are also described together with an increased bacterial load [26]. In the present study, we observed identical modifications since the \u03b1-diversity and the richness were drastically lower and the bacterial load higher in diseased compared with healthy dogs. These modifications are supported by the ecological modeling of the LM proposed by Dickson et al. [26]. In healthy individuals, the bacterial communities found in the LM are mainly determined by the balance between immigration and elimination while in injured respiratory tract, the local growth conditions are altered creating a pressure across bacterial members and improving the reproduction rate of adapted bacteria which results in an increase in the bacterial load and a decrease in the richness and the diversity, together with the emergence of dominating bacteria [26].",

            "text": "The prevalence of bacterial co-infections in dogs affected with B. bronchiseptica found in this study by sequencing is quite elevated (40%) in comparison with data from the literature, where bacterial co-infections are reported in 7.69% to 53% of cases [1, 3, 6]. Reported co-infecting bacteria in CIRD-C also found in that study by sequencing included M. cynos [1], other Mycoplasma species [3, 6] and Pseudomonas sp. [8]. Other bacteria with a relative abundance > 5% that have been associated with pneumonia such as Stenotrophomonas sp., Ureaplasma sp., Escherichia-Shigella sp. in dogs [5, 30, 40\u201342], or Elizabethkingia meningoseptica in man [43] were found in that study. Although it is unclear if they are just colonizing or co-infecting bacteria, and if they could potentially play a role in CIRD-C. The high rate of co-infections in this study could be associated with the selection of the diseased dogs. Indeed, in CIRD-C, the disease is often self-limiting and resolves spontaneously within 2 weeks without complications [8] while co-infections are usually associated with more severe and chronic clinical signs [4]. The diseased dogs were referral cases with clinical signs for a median duration of 1 month. Higher bacterial co-infection rate could also be related to underlying viral infection [4, 8], which was not assessed in this study.",

            "text": "As previously reported and confirmed in this study, the qPCR is a very sensitive technique to diagnose B. bronchiseptica infection [1]. All infected dogs tested in this study had a positive qPCR result for B. bronchiseptica generally at moderate to very high load. The result of the culture was negative in 5/11 dogs which could partially be related to the fact that four of those dogs had recently been treated with antimicrobial drugs which may impair culture growth. Negative culture results have also already been described in dogs with B. bronchiseptica infection and could be associated with the sensitivity of the technique [1]. In man, it has been shown that the culture sensitivity in Bordetella sp. infections was lower than the PCR sensitivity [44]. In the present study, B. bronchiseptica was found by 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing in high amount in all the diseased dogs. The results of the amplicon sequencing at each taxonomic level were correlated with the Ct classes and the culture results. Such good agreement between positive culture results and 16S rDNA sequencing results has already been reported [30], with a high relative abundance of the taxa found by culture. Also, as already reported, some ubiquitous bacteria identified by culture were not found with the 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing which could be due to a mis annotation of the SILVA database or to a contamination of the culture which could lead to errors in culture-based antimicrobial drug selection [30]. Other co-infecting and/or colonizing bacteria were detected by the sequencing, showing that the 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing can be an interested technique to identified new potential pathogens. Moreover, the sequencing depicts the global bacterial population on the contrary of the qPCR and culture. Indeed, the qPCR is specific of the targeted sequence and is not useful to detect new bacteria [45]. Culture is quite challenging; some bacteria like Mycoplasma sp. requires specific culture conditions, some bacteria are unculturable and other bacteria are rare and slow growing and therefore may be missed [20]. The present study has some limitations. Firstly, qPCR Ct and culture results were not available in all dogs. Moreover, the qPCRs were performed on different type of materials (frozen or fresh, pellet or crude BALF). Some dogs were treated with antimicrobial drugs at the time of sampling which could have an impact on culture, qPCR and sequencing results. Culture results of BALF samples from healthy dogs were not available. We consider that such results are not essential since our study focuses on the evaluation of the 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing technique in diseased dogs, in a clinical context. Besides, we have a quite limited number of control dogs and in order to compare age-matched groups, we have selected a subpopulation of our diseased dogs for the comparison. Indeed, although in dogs the effect of aging has not been studied, in man, the LM has been reported to be different in young children of less than 3 years compared with adults [24]. Healthy dogs were not breed-matched with the diseased dogs. However, the breed impact on the LM seemed to be subtle [31]. No differences between the selection of diseased dogs and the rest of the diseased group were shown suggesting that the selection is representative of the diseased group.",
