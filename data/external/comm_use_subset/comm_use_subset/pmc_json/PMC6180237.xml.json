This virus is primarily transmitted through the bite of the Aedes mosquito (Zanluca and Duarte dos Santos, 2016). Unlike most other flaviviruses, however, person-to-person ZIKV transmission is possible, although the contribution of this transmission mode to maintaining an epidemic is unclear. Transmission by sexual and perinatal interactions and from blood and platelet transfusions has been described (Mlakar et al., 2016; Noronha et al., 2016; Miner and Diamond, 2017).",

Nevertheless, cases of neurological manifestations, such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (Beckham et al., 2016; Noronha et al., 2016; Schuler-Faccini et al., 2016), have been reported in patients diagnosed with ZIKV. In addition, ZIKV infection during pregnancy has been associated with fetal malformations. Brain microcalcification and other central nervous system disorders, ocular abnormalities, and arthrogryposis are all a part of congenital Zika syndrome (Brasil et al., 2016; Melo et al., 2016; Schuler-Faccini et al., 2016). By March 17, 2017, thirty-one countries or territories in the Americas had reported central nervous system malformations that were potentially associated with ZIKV infection, and Brazil is the most affected country to date [World Health Organization (WHO), 2017].",

Syncytial knots are specializations in the syncytiotrophoblast, and an increase in these structures in late gestation indicates placental pathology and can be used to evaluate villous maturity. Syncytial sprouts are markers of trophoblast proliferation; they are seen frequently during early pregnancy and are increased in many diseases (Loukeris et al., 2010). These findings agree with the results of a study showing the damaging effect of type I interferon (INF I) on ex vivo human mid-gestation placental tissues treated with INF-\u03b2. The authors demonstrated that type I INFs trigger fetal death in a mouse model and that treatment of ex vivo human placentas with INF-\u03b2 induces morphological changes in the villi, such as syncytial knots and sprouts (Yockey et al., 2018).",

(B) Case LRV/16 515\u2014Chorioamniotic membrane from a third trimester placenta negative for anti-ZIKV MAb. Notice that the capsular decidua (*), the smooth chorion above the capsular decidua (arrowhead) and the amniotic epithelium (arrow) are negative for the antibody used. (C) Case LRV/16 515\u2014Decidua basalis (*) from a third trimester placenta negative for anti-ZIKV MAb.
