We estimate that the risk of importation of at least one case to Europe except France and Germany is high. It is larger than 80% if 60 travel-related cases are exported from China. The three countries at highest risk are the UK, Germany, and France (confirming estimates reported by other studies [12,14,15]), with the latter two countries already reporting cases. Delays are expected from date of importation to date of identification that may bias observations at the time of writing. All three cases imported to France were confirmed on 24 January 2020, with two travelling on 18 January 2020 (6 days delay) and one on 22 January 2020 (2 days delay).",
