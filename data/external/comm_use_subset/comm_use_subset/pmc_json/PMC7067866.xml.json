With their strong phagocytic capacity they engulf pathogens early after their invasion and inactivate them by proteolysis1. Especially during virus infection, macrophages are the key effector cells of innate immunity. Mice lacking macrophages are highly susceptible for instance to mouse hepatitis virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and vesicular stomatitis virus and show overwhelming viral propagation2\u20134. The contribution of macrophages to control of systemic infection was linked to their capacity to internalize infectious particles and limit their propagation in a type I interferon (IFN-I) dependent manner, which leads to upregulation of the antiviral genes Mx, OAS, RNase L and Protein kinase R4. While these antiviral mechanisms require hours after infection to become active, macrophages also exhibit robust antiviral suppression already minutes after virus inoculation4\u20136, suggesting the presence of preexisting IFN-I-independent antiviral mechanisms. However, these mechanisms are poorly defined.",

After binding to a target cell, HSV-1 either fuses directly with the plasma membrane or is taken up into endosomes of the cell8,9. Within these endosomes fusion of the outer limiting membrane with HSV-1 membrane leads to infection of the cells in a pH dependent manner10. Upon penetration, the HSV-1 capsid traffics on microtubules to the nucleus11,12, uncoats its DNA genome at the nuclear pore complex13,14, and delivers the genome to the nucleus for replication and assembly of capsids15,16. Newly formed capsids bud through the nuclear envelope17 and exit the infected cell through the secretory pathway or by cell lysis18,19. In an HSV-1 infection model, macrophages play an essential role20. This is linked to the high IFN-I sensitivity of HSV-1, which limits the replication of HSV-1 DNA and the production of newly formed capsids21,22. Interestingly even in the absence of IFN-I replication of HSV-1 is restricted in macrophages, a phenomenon that could be explained by limited uptake of HSV-1 into macrophages or an aggravated or limited infection of the macrophage after HSV-1 has entered the endosome. Whether indeed macrophage-specific mechanisms regulate HSV-1 infection remains unknown.",

Sphingolipids are enriched in MVBs and are involved in the MVB biogenesis and the regulation of their functions24. Thereby sphingolipids modulate diverse cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, signal transduction, and membrane trafficking25\u201327. Modulation of biophysical membrane properties such as fluidity, polarity, vesicle formation, and deformation is one major factor of the regulatory capacity of sphingolipids28. A key enzyme in sphingolipid metabolism in MVBs is the acid ceramidase (aCDase)29\u201331. It catalyzes the degradation of ceramide into sphingosine and free fatty acid, which modulates the shape and the charge of membranes. Whether this process can modulate HSV-1 entry remains unknown.",

Antiviral activity of aCDase is independent of IFN-I, but aCDase expression is dependent on IRF8 during macrophage development.

Na\u00efve mice and HSV-1 infected macrophage-depleted mice served as controls. 1 h after infection most of the virus inoculum co-localized with F4/80+ macrophages within the liver (Fig. 1a), suggesting that macrophages are equipped to take up HSV-1 quickly after systemic administration. Na\u00efve mice did not show HSV-1 staining (Fig. 1a) and macrophage-depleted mice showed no F4/80+ cells in spleen and liver and no co-localization (Supplementary Fig. 1)4. To obtain insights on the functional role of macrophages we treated C57BL/6 mice with clodronate-liposomes to deplete macrophages. Control mice were treated with control-liposomes and all mice were infected with HSV-1. In the presence of macrophages, HSV-1 replication was nearly undetectable 24 h after infection (Fig. 1b, c). In strong contrast, HSV-1 showed overwhelming replication in the absence of macrophages (Fig. 1b, c). Enhanced replication of HSV-1 correlated with production of infectious HSV-1 in liver and spleen of macrophage deficient mice (Fig. 1d). In line with overwhelming virus propagation, macrophage deficient mice developed liver cell damage and died quickly after infection (Fig. 1e, f). To analyze the importance of macrophages during a natural infection route, we infected mice intravaginal with HSV-1 and analyzed local replication of HSV-1 and outcome of the infection. Local HSV-1 replication and production of infectious particles was comparable between control and macrophage-depleted mice (Fig. 1g, h). However, macrophage-depleted mice died after intravaginal infection while control mice were protected (Fig. 1i). This suggests that macrophages in the vagina do not limit early local HSV-1 replication, while, macrophages are critical for the systemic control of HSV-1. In conclusion, we found that macrophages do play an essential role to protect from systemic HSV-1 propagation.",

Following this, we aimed to investigate antiviral mechanisms that are specific to macrophages. To get insights into the macrophage-specific antiviral mechanism we generated bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) and compared their antiviral activity to isolated alveolar fibroblasts. HSV-1 propagated strongly in fibroblasts and infectious HSV-1 was released into the supernatant (Fig. 2a, b). In contrast to fibroblasts, HSV-1 showed limited propagation in macrophages and infectious particles were hardly measurable in the supernatants (Fig. 2a, b). Even higher infection doses up to MOI 1 did not result in productive infection in cultured macrophages (Fig. 2b). Treatment with interferon-\u03b14 (IFN-\u03b14) reduced the infectious particles (Fig. 2b), however the striking difference in virus production between fibroblasts and macrophages remained. These results suggest that administration of type I interferon (IFN-I) cannot induce the strong antiviral capacities of macrophages in fibroblasts. While there are multiple differences between macrophages and fibroblasts, we hypothesized that macrophages have specific antiviral protection mechanisms independent of the presence of IFN-I.",

            "text": "To explore potential antiviral mechanisms we performed microarray analysis to compare cellular pathways between macrophages and fibroblasts. The strongest difference between fibroblasts and macrophages was the high expression of endosomal, lysosomal and vesicular transport pathways in macrophages (Fig. 2c). From these data, we considered it likely that in macrophages the vesicular trafficking of HSV-1 might be extraordinary, and therefore restricts a productive infection. To directly visualize HSV-1 entry in macrophages and fibroblasts, we performed electron microscopy of macrophages and fibroblasts, which were infected with HSV-1 (MOI 250) for 30 min. We chose 30 min, as this is the time that HSV-1 requires to enter cells and first incoming capsids to reach the nuclear envelope of fibroblasts or epithelial cells11,32\u201334. Indeed, 30 min after infection we detected first viral capsids at the nuclear envelope of fibroblasts, but no newly produced viral capsids (Supplementary Fig. 2). Therefore we concluded that 30 min is an ideal time point to analyze the early internalization and intracellular distribution of HSV-1 within the cell. As expected, we found in macrophage and fibroblast cell cultures HSV-1 virions close to the plasma membrane (Fig. 2d). In macrophages, about 30% of all particles were found in endosomes and significantly more particles, about 50% of all particles, were found in multivesicular bodies (Fig. 2d, e). We could hardly detect viral capsids in the cytosol of macrophages (Fig. 2d, e). In fibroblasts, HSV-1 was detectable in vesicular compartments like early endosomes, late endosomes, MVBs and/or lysosomes (Fig. 2d). In addition electron microscopy revealed cytosolic capsids after 30 min of infection (Fig. 2d), indicating fusion of the viral envelopes with host membrane and successful capsid delivery into the cytosol. From these results we concluded that after HSV-1 is internalized by macrophages, it passes early and late endosomes and accumulates in MVBs but cannot deliver its capsid through the outer limiting membrane to the cytosol. This phenomenon might be responsible for limited productive infection in macrophages.",

Strikingly we found overexpression of phospholipase C subtypes, neutral sphingomyelinase (Nsm, Smpd3) and acid ceramidase (aCDase, Asah1) in macrophages (Fig. 2f) in comparison to fibroblasts. Differential expression of these proteins was independent of IFN-I (Fig. 2f). Using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis we confirmed the high expression of Asah1 mRNA and cleaved, i.e., activated, aCDase protein in macrophages compared to fibroblasts (Fig. 2g, h, Supplementary Fig. 7). From these experiments we concluded that macrophages accumulate HSV-1 in MVBs without being productively infected. This strong antiviral activity of macrophages correlated with aCDase expression.",

Next we tested the role of aCDase in vivo. We infected WT and Asah1\u2212/\u2212 mice with HSV-1. In Asah1\u2212/\u2212 mice, HSV-1 showed overwhelming propagation after 12 h to 3 days (Fig. 3c, d) and infectious particles were produced in spleen and liver of Asah1\u2212/\u2212, but not control mice (Fig. 3e). Next we aimed to determine the importance of Asah1 in relation to the known anti-HSV-1 effectors type I interferon (IFN-I)35 and SAMHD136. Therefore we infected mice, which show limited production of IFN-I (MyD88\u2212/\u2212\nx Trif\u2212/\u2212\nx Cardif\u2212/\u2212 mice), limited response to IFN-I (Ifnar\u2212/\u2212 mice) and mice, which lack SAMHD1 (Samhd1\u2212/\u2212 mice), with HSV-1.

From literature it is known that aCDase is usually active in lysosomes and MVBs29\u201331,37. To test whether aCDase directly interacts with HSV-1, we infected macrophages with HSV-1 and stained for aCDase and HSV-1 after 30 min. HSV-1 and aCDase were in close approximation, however we did not see a direct co-localization of aCDase with HSV-1 (Fig. 4a). This suggests that aCDase is not directly modulating HSV-1, but might modulate cellular components such as MVBs, which affect HSV-1 infection. Functionally, aCDase converts ceramide into sphingosine (Fig. 4b) and we considered that enhancement of sphingosine in MVBs was the reason for viral protection in WT macrophages against HSV-1. Indeed, addition of CDase 30 min before infection limits HSV-1 propagation, which suggests that the enzymatic function is most relevant for the antiviral activity (Fig. 4c, d).To reveal the role of sphingosine in HSV-1 infection, we treated macrophages with sphingosine (Sph), sphingomyelinase (SMase), and sphingosine kinase inhibitor (SKI-II), which are all involved in sphingolipid pathway and could enhance sphingosine levels38. Sphingosine treatment, which strongly elevated total sphingosine levels of primary macrophages and the Raw264.7 macrophage cell line (Supplementary Fig. 4), suppressed propagation of HSV-1 (Fig. 4c\u2013e). Treatment with ceramidase, sphingomyelinase, and sphingosine kinase inhibitor resulted in smaller increases of cellular sphingosine levels and a corresponding suppression of HSV-1 propagation (Fig. 4c\u2013e, Supplementary Fig. 4). From these data we concluded that enhanced amount of sphingosine was most likely the reason for antiviral activity in the presence of aCDase. To determine whether sphingosine acted cell type specific, we tested the antiviral activity of sphingosine in different cell types including human monocytes (THP-1), human cervix carcinoma cells (HeLa) and monkey kidney cells (Vero). To note, HSV-1 infects Vero cells via fusion at the plasma membrane while HeLa cells are infected after HSV-1 is endocytosed10,11,39,40. We found that sphingosine and/or SKI-II acted antiviral in undifferentiated THP-1 and HeLa cells (Fig. 4f, g). However we found limited antiviral activity of sphingosine in Vero cells (Fig. 4h), suggesting that the cell type and/or the route of infection might limit the antiviral activity of sphingosine. Taken together we concluded, that sphingosine, which is produced by aCDase in MVBs is antivirally active in macrophages.",

To this end, we incubated cells for 30 min with an HSV-1 carrying a fluorescently labeled tegument (HSV-1-VP16-GFP), and stained with an antibody for viral capsids (VP541), which recognizes the uncoated capsid after virus membrane fusion. In this experimental setup capsid is only visible after dissociation of the tegument11. We mainly observed HSV-1-VP16-GFP puncta, in WT macrophages (Fig. 5a, b), indicating that the HSV-1 capsids were not released from the envelope. In strong contrast, in aCDase lacking (Asah1\u2212/\u2212) macrophages we detected almost exclusively exposed capsids without tegument (Fig. 5a, b), suggesting that the capsids were released from the envelope and the tegument due to virus infection. To get more insights into the reason for limited infection in WT macrophages, we performed electron microscopy experiments in WT and Asah1\u2212/\u2212 macrophages. WT and Asah1\u2212/\u2212 macrophages showed similar amounts of HSV-1 particles attached to the plasma membrane (Fig. 5c, d). In line, similar amounts of HSV-1 particles were detected in WT and Asah1\u2212/\u2212 macrophages in endosomes and MVB (Fig. 5c, d). In WT macrophages HSV-1 particles were located in close proximity to the ILVs, and in some cases appeared to fuse with ILVs (Fig. 5c, d). This correlated with trapping of HSV-1 in ILVs (Fig. 5c, d). In contrast, in Asah1\u2212/\u2212 macrophages, the HSV-1 envelopes were more frequently associated with the outer limiting membranes (OLMs) of the MVBs (Fig. 5c, d), so that membrane fusion here led to a productive release of capsids into the cytosol and infection of the cell. Therefore, we concluded that aCDase-derived sphingosine mediates binding of HSV-1 envelope to ILVs membrane, which results in trapping of the virus.",

Indeed, sphingosine accumulated in ILVs (Fig. 5e). As expected HSV-1 co-stained with these sphingosine-rich ILVs (Fig. 5e). To determine that indeed sphingosine is responsible for interaction between HSV-1 and ILVs, we generated liposomes and loaded them either with ceramide or sphingosine. Liposomes were then incubated with HSV-1 and binding of virions was analyzed after 10 min by flow cytometry. Control and ceramide-liposomes did not bind HSV-1 (Fig. 5f, g). In contrast, sphingosine-liposomes bound HSV-1 (Fig. 5f, g). Concluding, we found that the antiviral effects of aCDase are mediated via fusion of viral envelop to sphingosine containing ILVs of MVBs.",

We aimed to analyze whether Asah1 is also induced by IFN-I. The results show that Asah1 expression was hardly influenced by IFN-I, nor did Asah1 influence the induction of IFN-I or interferon induced genes (Fig. 6a, b). Therefore we concluded that Asah1 is not specifically upregulated during infection, but shows already basal activity in macrophages before infection. To get insights how Asah1 expression is upregulated in macrophages we considered that interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) might play a role in this process. IRF8 is a factor, which induces natural resistance in macrophages during their development43,44. Furthermore, it was shown that IRF8 regulates the expression of aCDase during the induction of apoptosis in cancer cells45. RT-PCR analysis of myeloid pre-cursor cells in the bone marrow revealed IRF8-dependent upregulation of Asah1 (Supplementary Fig. 5). To determine the role of IRF8 in regulating Asah1 in mature macrophages, we analyzed Asah1 expression in the spleen, an organ showing high numbers of macrophages. RT-PCR and Western blot analysis revealed limited levels of Asah1 mRNA and aCDase precursor protein in spleens of Irf8\u2212/\u2212 mice when compared to WT spleens (Fig. 6c, d, Supplementary Fig. 8). In line, Irf8\u2212/\u2212 mice showed elevated levels of HSV-1 DNA as well as increased production of viral particles after infection with HSV-1 (Fig. 6e, f). It has previously been reported, that IRF8 expression in human blood monocytes decreases with age, which correlates with decreased expression of interferon stimulated genes and might be a reason for impaired antiviral resistance to influenza A virus (IAV)46. Whether this reduced IRF8 expression influences also aCDase dependent virus control remains to be studied. We concluded that Asah1 is not induced during infection or by IFN-I, however IRF8 regulates Asah1 expression during development of macrophages.",

During infection with viruses such as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), adenovirus or mouse hepatitis virus, macrophages play a major protective role in limiting infection and preventing severe disease2\u20134,48\u201350. In particular, tissue resident macrophages such as Kupffer cells in the liver clear a range of systemic virus infections4,48. Molecular mechanisms explaining this strong antiviral activity are presently unknown. Here we found that macrophages are essential for the control of HSV-1. With our in vitro data, we linked the strong antiviral activity of macrophages to the expression of aCDase. aCDase produced sphingosine-rich ILVs in MVBs. Once HSV-1 is taken up into MVBs, sphingosine-rich ILVs bind to HSV-1 particles and thereby trap them in MVBs and prevent infection of the cell. Expression of aCDase was not regulated by IFN-I, but was induced in macrophages in response to IRF8 signaling. While we focused in our manuscript on the role of aCDase in macrophages, our in vivo data suggest that aCDase exerts antiviral activity probably also in other myeloid or even none-myeloid cell types.",

Le Blanc et al.51 and Nour et al.52 considered the release of viral capsids into ILVs a relevant step in virus life cycle, and suggested that back-fusion of ILVs, harboring capsids, with the OLMs of MVBs leads to productive infection. Our data show that although back-fusion might occur in macrophages, fusion of viral membrane with ILV membrane is rather a cellular mechanism to limit infection of the cell.

We consider that trapped viral particles are unable to leave MVBs and are targeted to lysosomes for degradation. This pathway of degradation might also facilitate antigen-presentation and immune activation, as high numbers of tetraspanins and MHC-II molecules are contained within ILVs23,59. More studies are required to identify the relationship of aCDase, sphingosine and antigen-presentation on MHC-II. In our study we focused mainly on the role of sphingosine and aCDase in macrophages. In addition, aCDase is expressed in several other tissues, especially in lung, colon and stomach as well as spleen60 (Supplementary Fig. 6). Cells in these organs are involved in building a barrier, which protects against invading viruses. We consider it likely that in addition to macrophages, potentially also other cell types express aCDase in MVBs and are thereby protected against invading viruses.",

A targeting vector was constructed, including Asah1 genomic sequences on the C57BL/6 genetic background, a long homology region of 5.8 kb and a short homology region of 1.7 kb. It also included two loxP sites flanking Asah1 exon 1, a neomycin gene flanked by flipase recognition target sites for positive selection of homologous recombination, and a diphtheria toxin, a negative-selection marker to detect insertions and nonhomologous recombinant embryonic stem cell clones. This targeting vector was inserted into C57BL/6 embryonic stem cells by homologous recombination. Offspring were crossed with CreER mice (Gt[ROSA]26Sortm9[cre/ESR1]Arte; Taconic Artemis Pharmaceuticals [K\u00f6ln, Germany]). In some experiments we used mice in which acid ceramidase deficiency could be induced (Cre \u00d7 Asah1fl/fl). CreER x Asah1fl/fl offspring express a Cre recombinase under the tamoxifen promoter and the Asah1 gene with two LoxP sites flanking exon 1. Administering tamoxifen thus led to the expression of Cre recombinase and loss of function mutation by deletion of exon 1 in the Asah1 gene. In this model, knock out of Asah1 occurs right before infection. Potential developmental defects due to long term knock out of Asah1 are excluded in this model.",
