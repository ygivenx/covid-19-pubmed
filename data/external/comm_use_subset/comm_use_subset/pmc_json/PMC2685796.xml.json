For in-depth interview, one hospital is not-for-profit and located in central Taiwan, while the other is a public hospital located in Taipei. Two of the hospitals assessed were medical centers with more than 1000 general beds and they were well known on outsourcing in medical items as well as on the non medical items. The in-depth interview were to ask the hospital's situation about outsourcing, and the feeling include what they think about the outsourcing can get benefit to them and the advantage and disadvantage of it. The interview time lasted for continuously four hours. The questionnaires were mailed to all 17 medial centers and all 71 region hospitals, while the 77 local hospitals were chosen by stratified system sampling methods from 382 local hospitals. The sample medical centers have the bed number from 800 to 2500, region hospitals' size normally between 300 beds to 800 beds, and local hospitals are from 20 to 300 beds in Taiwan. The total sample size is 165, with 37 completed questionnaires returned; The returned samples in medical centers were 6/14 = 35.3%, in regional hospitals were 21/71 = 29.5%, and in local hospitals were 10/77 = 12.9%. We prudently analyzed the returning samples and find they were evenly spread across the north, central, and south region of Taiwan; therefore, we believe it can represent the Taiwan hospital system. However, the returned local hospital samples were few, the reason could be: this level of small hospitals always own and operate by physicians and his/her families, therefore, unwilling to fill this kind of academic questionnaire due to lack of manpower.",

The second part is the hospital accreditation level, such as medical center, regional, or local; total hospital beds; and hospital type, such as public, private, or not-for-profit. The third part is the definition of outsourcing, and inquires whether the hospital outsources at 9 non-clinical items and 10 clinical items which categories revised from Yigit (2007) paper. The fourth part is the satisfaction scores, using Likert 5 scales to evaluate the outsourcing of medical and non-medical items. The fifth part is the hospital's comments or suggestions.",

The gift store (75%) and linen (73%) follow that high. The lowest percentage is in utility maintenance (13.5%). The reason that the medical and common waste outsourcing rate is high is because Taiwanese hospitals have limited space, and lack the area to build refuse burning facilities. Similarly, the newer hospitals are not built with laundry facilities because the laborers and machines take up too much space. Outsourcing this service has saved hospitals space and funds. The gift store is also frequently outsourced because it is not one of the hospital's major concerns; therefore, they usually rent the space out or cooperate with chains of retail stores.",

A hospital chief of the executive officer (CEO) expressed that night shift and holiday shift ambulances are always contracted out due to the higher cost and the limited human resource concern. The hemodialysis center also has a higher rate of outsourcing (50%) due to there are four giant hemodialysis medical group in Taiwan that hire physicians, nurses, technicians, and purchase discounted hemodialysis filters and supplies. In general, these hemodialysis companies could provide unify and better quality with a reasonable price. However, the other medical items show a much lower percentage of outsourcing rate such as nutrition, pharmacy, and nursing, the outsourcing rate is lower than 3%. This shows that hospitals consider medical items are their core business and very conservative in outsourcing medical items.",

The paired t-test between medical and non-medical items shows only the HR has no statistic significance; other items such SP, SQ, SI, adaptability to environment (AE) and total satisfaction (TS), medical items have statistic higher score than non-medical items. Only in the cost saving do the non-medical items have a higher score than the medical items. In general, the medical items have higher scores than the non-medical items. The reason that medical items can surpass the non medical items on satisfaction score is the medical items need more professional training, purchase and maintain medical equipment, and normally the size of the outsourcing companies are much bigger and show their companies' discipline and speciality performance on their job. However, the \"saving cost\" shows different results, this could be the outsourcing of the non-medical items such as linen and maintenance did pay less to outsourcing companies.",

The interesting point is that the \"saving cost\" is significant on both factor 1 and factor 2 of non medical items. For non medical items, this study define the first factor is \"performance\", this means hospitals believe outsourcing have better ability on the performance. The second factor is \"finance\", this means outsourcing can contribute hospital's finance and also help hospitals to overcome the dramatically changing medical environment, such as the keeping going down reimbursement system of the \"individual hospital global budget\" of National Health Insurance of Taiwan. The third factor is \"human resource\", such as the security, linen, and waste treatment, outsourcing have great contribution to hospital's limited human power. For medical items, this study defined the first factor is \"operation\" since this factor include most of the hospital's operation indices, and second factor could be defined as \"satisfaction\".",
