            "text": "Zaire Ebola virus (EBOV), a member of the filovirus family, causes severe, frequently lethal infections in humans and primates [1]. Since December 2013 the outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa has claimed 11,314 lives of the 28,630 confirmed cases. Clinical symptoms at onset of EVD include headache, fever, asthenia, arthralgia and myalgia. Gastrointestinal symptoms including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea develop, leading to an electrolyte imbalance associated with intravascular volume depletion. Indeed, EVD is associated with profound endothelial dysfunction leading to fluid shifts that may result in cardiovascular collapse and renal failure [2,3]. Notably, the overall fatality rates differed in the 3 countries with the greatest number of confirmed cases: 67% in Guinea, 45% in Liberia and 28% in Sierra Leone [4]. Variables such as extent of viremia, time to onset of supportive care, and the level of supportive care, contributed to the case fatality ratio [5]. In the absence of any approved treatments, the high case fatality ratio prompted the consideration of potential treatment options, including the repurposing of approved drugs.",

IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production occurs as the earliest non-specific response to viral infection, directly inhibiting viral infection and activating the innate and adaptive immune responses to clear virus. Indeed, viruses have evolved immune evasion strategies specifically targeted against the type I IFN response, confirming the importance of IFNs as antivirals. This immune evasion strategy is particularly relevant when one considers IFN and EBOV infection. Experimental data indicate that the EBOV proteins VP24 and VP35 inhibit host cell systems that lead to type I IFN production and also inhibit events associated with an IFN response [7\u20139]. Accordingly, early post-exposure treatment with type I IFN might override these inhibitory effects of EBOV. IFN \u03b2-1a therapy has been shown to prolong survival in a rhesus macaque model of lethal EVD [10] and IFN-\u03b12b treatment reduced viremia and extended the time to death in a similar cynomolgus model of lethal EVD [11]. A combination of monoclonal antibodies targeted against EBOV (ZMAb) protects macaques from lethal EVD, with decreasing efficacy if treatment is delayed to 2 days post-infection [12]. Addition of an adenovirus expressed vectored IFN-\u03b1 to ZMAb extended the treatment window and improved protection [12]. Moreover, in mice and guinea pigs, using this replication-deficient human adenovirus expressing recombinant IFN-\u03b1 alone, post-exposure treatment elicited full protection from lethal doses of the mouse- and guinea pig- adapted EBOV [13]. Notably, examination of serum samples from infected individuals during the 2000 outbreak of Sudan EBOV in Uganda revealed that surviving patients had significantly higher levels of IFN-\u03b1 within the first few days of the onset of critical illness [14].",

These findings provided the basis for this single arm proof-of-concept pilot study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IFN-\u03b2 treatment for EVD. This study was undertaken in an ETU close to Coyah, Guinea, during the 2014\u20132015 Ebola outbreak. While a placebo-controlled study was not permitted by the Guinean Health Authorities due to ethical concerns, laboratory and clinical data from EBOV-infected individuals who received only supportive care at the same treatment center and during the same period as those who received IFN \u03b2-1a was available for comparison.

Inclusion (eligibility) criteria for IFN \u03b2-1a therapy were (1) symptom onset within 6 days, (2) Blood RT-PCR-confirmed positive for EBOV, (3) patient/designate informed consent for use of IFN \u03b2-1a.

Recruitment of patients was difficult in the declining outbreak, limiting this proof-of-concept study to a pilot study. Nine patients met the inclusion criteria for IFN \u03b2-1a treatment.

We also included an additional 17 patients who matched the IFN-treated patients for eligibility criteria based on \u2264 6 days from symptom onset, age, and under care in a Guinean treatment centre, who were better matched for baseline CT values.

The IFN \u03b2-1a treatment and control groups did not differ in age, sex or day of admission relative to symptom onset (Table 1). Elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatinine (CRE) and C reactive protein (CRP) levels were consistent features of EVD in all study participants. Of the 9 patients treated with IFN \u03b2-1a, 5 started IFN treatment on day 3 post-symptom onset, 1 on day 4 post-symptom onset, one on day 5 post-symptom onset and one on day 6 post-symptom onset. One patient started treatment the next day following admission to the treatment unit based on being a high risk contact who was asymptomatic, but was PCR positive. Given the elevated ALT, AST and CRE levels in all patients with EVD, we were unable to determine whether IFN \u03b2-1a treatment negatively affected these biochemical blood measurements. 1 patient (Table 2, #4) with a PCR negative result received a dose reduction (3 x106 IU), related to elevated AST and ALT levels, and had a second 2 consecutive PCR negative result on this reduced dose. Another patient (#5) received a dose reduction (3x106 IU) because of rapid resolution of clinical symptoms and a coincident first negative PCR result.

Notably, ALT, AST and CRE were significantly elevated in all 3 patients who died, despite one patient (#7) exhibiting reduction in blood viremia from a CT value of 20.1 at start of IFN \u03b2-1a treatment, to a CT value of 38 on day 10, when the patient succumbed to disease (Table 2).",

We included an additional 17 patients who matched the IFN-treated patients for eligibility criteria based on \u2264 6 days from symptom onset, age, and under care in a Guinean treatment centre, who were better matched for baseline CT values. Notably, these patients were never approached to participate in the IFN \u03b2-1a treatment trial. Since no data were available to us on serial CT values for these additional patients, we only used vital status (alive or dead) as the outcome. Three logistic regression analyses were performed: (i) An analysis in which all patients were included: 9 IFN-treated and 38 controls. The results suggest that the treatment is significant even when the model is adjusted for CT value. The patients without treatment had an odds ratio of dying 7.54 fold more likely than those treated, when adjusting for the CT value. For a CT value of 20 (median for CT) the probability of dying for those untreated was 1.89 fold larger than for those treated (S1 Table) (ii) An analysis in which patients older than 50 years (which is the maximum age in the IFN-treated group) and with baseline CT values <16 or >31 (the range of values for the IFN-treated group) were excluded. The patients without treatment had an odds ratio of dying 6.39 fold more likely than those treated, when adjusting for the CT value. For a CT value of 20 (median for CT) the probability of dying for those untreated was 1.81 fold larger than for those treated (S2 Table). (iii) A matched analysis. Each patient from the IFN-treated group was matched to a group of patients in the control group such that the age difference was not larger than 5 years and the CT difference was not larger than 2. For 5 patients suitable matches were found: For IFN 02 one match, for IFN 03 one match, for IFN 04 three matches, for IFN 08 two matches and for IFN 10 three matches. For IFN 05, IFN 06, IFN 07 and IFN 09 no matches were found and they did not enter this analysis. The effect of the treatment based on the conditional logistic regression is significant (OR = 0.17, p = 0.012).

Moreover, extensive clinical experience with IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 prepared us for potential adverse outcomes and solutions to these.
