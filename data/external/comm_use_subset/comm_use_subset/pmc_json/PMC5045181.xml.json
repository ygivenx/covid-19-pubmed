CoV N proteins interact with viral-specific RNAs or RNA intermediates and might play important roles during viral transcription and replication [6, 7]. These proteins might also act as RNA chaperones, involved in template switching and required for efficient transcription [8, 9]. Four distinct domains are present in CoV N proteins: intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), an amino-terminal domain (NTD), a carboxy-terminal domain (CTD), and the linker region (LKR) [10\u201313]. The LKR of the N protein might play an essential role in the transformation of the N protein and its interaction with viral RNA [14]. The higher order oligomers of the CoV N protein are mediated by the CTD [15, 16]. However, there are few studies to date on the functions of the LKR and CTD. To further dissect the functions of the N protein LKR and CTD, mAbs to the N protein are needed.",

Indirect peptide ELISA was used to examine the humoral responses elicited by the aa 189\u2013202 and aa 247\u2013256 epitopes. On day 14, the immunized group showed a detectable level of antibody, whereas sera collected from the control group inoculated with PBS did not show any significant level of immune response (Fig 7A). Increases in immune antibodies were observed in the sera of the groups immunized with aa 189-202-KLH or aa 246-257-KLH, collected on day 28 (14 days after the first boost). On day 56, the group immunized with aa 189-202-KLH or aa 246-257-KLH showed the highest antibody levels. Furthermore, IFA results showed that the antibody against aa 189\u2013202 reacted with the N protein of TGEV-infected PK-15 cells.

Mapping the epitopes of CoV viral proteins could enhance our current understanding of the antigenic structure and function of this virus. Although the N protein of TGEV has been instrumental in the diagnosis of TGEV [26\u201328], its biology remains unknown. The N protein of TGEV plays an important role during the life cycle of the virus and also undergoes caspase-mediated proteolysis, suggesting that the N protein can be targeted for destruction by the host cell\u2019s death machinery [29]. Furthermore, the N proteins of CoVs are conducive to template switching and are required for efficient transcription [9]. TGEV N epitopes also elicit T helper cells that collaborate during in vitro antibody synthesis [30]. To understand the multiple functions of the TGEV N protein and to elucidate the mechanism involved in TGEV replication, mAbs against this protein are needed. The availability of specific antibodies against the TGEV N protein might also facilitate further studies on viral biosynthesis.",

In experiments confirming these epitopes, IPMA and GFP did not merge very well (Fig 3), potentially reflecting the factthe dark brown staining of IPMA blocks the green fluorescence of IFA in some cells. Thus, the green fluorescence was not obvious. In the peptide ELISA analysis, mAb 5E8 did not react with aa 189\u2013201 and aa 190\u2013202 (Fig 2), indicating that S189 and G202 are key residues for the activity of the aa189-202 epitope. In addition, mAb 3D7 did not react with aa 245\u2013257 and aa 246\u2013256 in the peptide ELISA analysis (Fig 2), indicating that V246 and A257 are key residues for the activity of epitope of aa 246\u2013257.

The LKR, an intrinsically disordered middle region separating the NTD and the CTD, is also known as the SR-rich domain because of the abundance of serine and arginine residues [33]. This domain is capable of direct interaction with viral RNA [34], and potential phosphorylation sites have been described in the LKR of CoV N proteins [35\u201337]. The phosphorylation site is believed to be a high-affinity region important for the binding of N to the nuclear ribosomal protein [38]. Previous studies have examined the function of the LKR in CoV N protein oligomerization, and mutational analyses have shown that an LKR motif within aa 184\u2013196 is crucial for N protein oligomerization [39]. The LKR might play an essential role in the transformation of CoV N proteins between dimer and multimer configurations [14]. We speculate that the TGEV N protein LKR acts in modulating viral transcription and translation. In the present study, the identified linear epitope of mAb 5E8 is located in the LKR of the TGEV N protein. To our knowledge, mAb 5E8 is the first antibody to recognize an epitope in the LKR region, and it could be used in the future to evaluate the functions of this domain in viral transcription and translation.",

The high conservation of the aa 189\u2013202 epitope in the N protein is advantageous to the development of mAb 5E8 for diagnostic technologies. Indeed, the mAb 5E8 generated against the TGEV N protein could be applied to various assays. For example, mAb 5E8 was used to reveal the location of the N protein during TGEV replication and to immunoprecipitate the N protein from lysates of TGEV-infected PK-15 cells (Fig 6A). The capacity of mAb 5E8 to immunoprecipitate the N protein will promote further studies on interactions of the N protein with viral and cellular proteins. Furthermore, because mAb 5E8 is effective in IHC assays, this mAb will benefit studies on the distribution of TGEV in infected animals and the pathogenesis of the virus in vivo. Interestingly, in the present study we observed TGEV N proteins of different sizes in TGEV-infected PK-15 cells (Fig 6A), suggesting that the N protein was cleaved by host or viral proteases during viral replication.",

            "text": "In virus-infected cells, CoV N proteins are present in the cytoplasm alone or in both the cytoplasm and the nucleolus [13, 49, 50]. In the present study, using the recombinant expression vector pEGFP-TGEV-N, the distribution of the N protein was investigated. We demonstrated the N protein was localized in the cytoplasm and nucleolus of transfected PK-15 cells (Fig 5). In addition, we detected the distribution of the TGEV N protein using mAb 5E8 in TGEV-infected PK-15 cells. However, no nucleolar localization of the N protein was observed using mAb 5E8 in TGEV-infected cells. This finding reflects the higher concentration of the antigen in the nucleus, which might block recognition [51]. Previous studies have reported that N protein nucleolar localization could not be detected in SARS-CoV-infected cells using antibodies against the N protein [52]. The mechanism of TGEV N protein localization to the nucleolus was not determined in the present study. Active transportation is required for proteins or nucleic acids greater than 40 kDa across the nuclear pore [53]. During this process, macromolecular transport across the pore not only requires energy but also a nuclear localization signal (NLS) [54, 55]. The TGEV N protein is predicted to possess two NLSs: 340RKRK343 (pat 4) and 199KKLGVDTEKQQQRSRSK215 (bipartite). Therefore, the TGEV N protein might be transported into the nucleus via an active pathway using an NLS.",

Subcellular localization of the N protein was observed using mAb 5E8, which was also used to immunoprecipitate the N protein from lysates of TGEV-infected PK-15 cells. The mAb 5E8 is a useful tool for investigating the antigenic properties of the N protein and developing a diagnostic test for TGEV infection. Furthermore, these antibodies are relevant to the further understanding of the replication mechanism of TGEV.",
