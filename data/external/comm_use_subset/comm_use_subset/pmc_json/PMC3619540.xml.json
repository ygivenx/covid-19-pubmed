Rhizoma Coptidis has been used for more than two thousand years in China, and it was known as \u201cthe antibiotics in traditional Chinese medicine\u201d. Although many studies were conducted on antimicrobial activities of berberine alkaloids (BAs) in the past few decades [1\u20137], few of them paid attention to the interactions among BAs. As we know, BAs are the active components of several traditional medicines, such as Rhizoma coptidis, Phellodendri Chinensis, and Berberidis Radix [8, 9], and the awareness of the interactions among BAs is of great value for the exploitation of such multicomponent drugs.

MRSA is one of the pathogenic clinically separated strains leading to high morbidity and mortality [10]. Due to its multidrug-resistant genotype, MRSA is not sensitive to the \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, and it is also resistant to aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, chloramphenicol, and macrolides [11\u201313], but not glycopeptides such as vancomycin and teicoplanin [14]. Single-drug treatment modalities have slowed down into bottle neck, alternatively the multi-component natural medicine might be one of the directions of the future antibacterial drug development [15]. We are expecting to clarify the synergetic and antagonistic actions and to seek the optimal combination of BAs which manifests the strongest anti-MRSA activity. We are initiating four steps to seek the optimal combination of BAs, that is, (1) determining the anti-MRSA of single BA, (2) investigating the two-component combination to clarify the interactions among BAs by checkerboard assay, (3) investigating the multi-component combination to determine the optimal ratio by quadratic rotation-orthogonal combination design, and (4) validation of the optimal combination.

Among these methods, checkerboard microdilution is one of the commonly used assays for two-component combinations that can quickly screen the antimicrobial activity [16]. The detection sensitivity of this method could be much improved by adding the fluorescent dye of resazurin, which makes it an accurate method for determining the anti-MRSA activity of BAs. However, checkerboard microdilution is not suitable for the investigation of multi-component combinations, and hence the quadratic rotation-orthogonal combination design (QRCD) was adopted to seek optimal combinations. Compared to unifactor experiment and orthogonal design, QRCD basically retained the advantages of less experiments, simple calculation and absence of the correlation between regression coefficients. In addition, the optimal region of the concentration could be directly obtained [17, 18]. This study can help to clarify the interactions among BAs and provide a new idea for the exploitation of multi-component drugs.",

Resazurin is a blue dye that is nonfluorescent until it is reduced to the pink colored and highly red fluorescent resorufin. It has a large change in perceived color hue when the thickness or concentration of an observed sample increases or decreases. The fluorescence intensity of different growth stages of bacteria was determined by Synergy H1 hybrid multimode microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski, USA). The concentration of resazurin sodium salt (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO, USA) in the assay was 2.84 \u03bcg/mL, and the excitation and emission wavelengths were set to 544 nm and 590 nm, respectively. Fluorescence intensity was determined 17 h after the experiment (when the fluorescence intensity peaked). The concentrations of the extracts of BAs were 2048, 1024, 512, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, and 4 \u03bcg/mL for rows 1\u201310, respectively.

All 10 possible two-component combinations of these 5 active compounds were tested in duplicate in 36-point dose matrices (six doses for each compound, representing 720 data points) for their effects on the proliferation of MRSA. The five test concentrations for each compound were chosen by first determining the EC50 of each compound as a single agent in this assay, and then selecting 4-fold and 16-fold higher and lower concentrations, and the study is performed as Figure 2. Each combination was then scored to identify antibacterial effects that were greater than the effects of the individual components by using a resazurin proliferation assay. For each combination, we calculated the difference between the observed effect of each combination of doses and the predicted effect based on two models of additivism [20]. The highest single agent (HSA) model is the larger of the effects produced by each of the combination's single agents at the same concentrations as in the mixture. In contrast, the Bliss additivism model [21] predicts that the combined response C for two single compounds with effects A and B is C = A + B \u2212 A \u00d7 B, where each effect is expressed as fractional inhibition between 0 and 1. These effect-based synergy models make no assumptions about the functional form of the dose-response curves and do not require dose-response information that lies outside the range sampled by each screening matrix. To determine whether the readout of the combination therapy is additive, synergistic, or indifferent, we calculated the fractional inhibitory concentration indices (FICI) by the checkerboard assay. The FICI represents the sum of the FICs of each drug tested, where the FIC is determined for each drug by dividing the MIC of each drug when used in combination by the MIC of each drug when used alone:\n(1)FICI=(MICdrug  A  in  combinationMICdrug  A  alone)+(MICdrug  B  in  combinationMICdrug  B  alone).\n",

The inhibiting effect could be calculated by the following equation: I = (A \u2212 X)/A \u00d7 100%, where I represents the inhibiting ratio, A represents the fluorescence absorption of the negative control (row 11), and X represents the fluorescence absorptions of alkaloids groups (rows 1\u201310). After that, the EC50 values were calculated from the I-concentration curves. The result showed that, among the alkaloids, berberine showed the strongest antimicrobial activity (Figure 3), and the inhibiting ratios reached 85.2% and 94.0% at the concentration of 512 \u03bcg/mL and 1024 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. The sequence of the activity of alkaloids was Ber > Cop > Jat > Pal > Epi. ",

However, to our knowledge, there have not been any reports on the combinations of ingredients in traditional medicine. The present study showed that alkaloids had anti-MRSA activity, but the activity was relatively weak compared with antibiotics. The reason might be that the bacteria had multiple drug resistance which resulted in low absolute concentration inside the cell membrane. Bacteria have evolved numerous defenses against antimicrobial agents, and drug-resistant pathogens are on the rise [35]. A general and effective defense is conferred by ubiquitous multidrug resistance pumps (MDRs), membrane translocases that extrude structurally unrelated toxins from the cell [36\u201339]. ",

There are a number of algorithms for quantifying synergy in the screening experiments. For example, median effect and isobolographic analyses effectively identify combinations in which one drug enhances the potency of the other drug. From the 36-point dose matrix, it was illustrated that the interactions of BAs were relevant to the proportion of each component. For example, the combination Ber & Epi showed strong synergistic effect while the proportion of Ber was 20%; the combination Pal & Epi showed obvious antagonistic effect while the proportion of Pal was 20%. The interactions among the drugs are the foundation of exploiting multicomponent drugs, and the development of such drugs should retain synergistic proportions and exclude antagonistic proportions. Following this principle, the interactions of the 10 combinations were analyzed and the optimal proportion region was obtained: Ber : Cop : Pal : Jat : Epi = 4 : 1\u20134 : 4\u201316 : 1\u201316 : 1\u20134.",

We developed an immunocompromised mouse model by i.p. injection of cyclophosphamide at a dosage of 100 mg/kg (body weight) once daily for 3 consecutive days to specific pathogen-free female ICR mice. To test the model with pathogens, mice were infected with 0.1 mL of MRSA suspension of 2 \u00d7 105 blastospores per mouse in warmed saline (35\u00b0C) by the lateral tail vein on day 3 after pretreatment with CY. We succeeded in causing 100% mortality within 6\u20138 days, which was suitable for subsequent drug-evaluation experiments. To test whether the BAs combinations had synergistic effects in the CY-immunocompromised mouse model, the test compound(s) either alone or in combination were administered orally by gavage 6 h postinfection and once daily thereafter for 5 days. A control group received 0.1 mL of saline by the same route as the placebo regimens. Organs of dead and killed mice at day 16 after infection were homogenized in sterile saline, diluted, and spread onto sabouraud dextrose agar plates. Colony counts were determined after 48 h at 35\u00b0C for calculation of geometric means. Comparative efficacy assessed by changes in the bacterial density in kidney, lung, and brain tissue of the infected mice after treatment, percent survival, and MST were undertaken for test compound(s). Results obtained from Figure 8 showed that the combination in Phellodendri Chinensis Cortex and geometric proportion of alkaloids group did not have significant therapeutic effects on the body weight and percent survival of infected mice compared with placebo control (P > 0.05). The course of infection indicates that the MST was 5.1 \u00b1 0.5, 6.8 \u00b1 0.6, and 7.6 \u00b1 0.5 for the placebo control, geometric proportion of alkaloids group, and combination in Phellodendri Chinensis Cortex group, respectively. On the contrary, the combination in Rhizoma Coptidis, cefoxitin, and optimal combination in this study group showed significant therapeutic effects (P < 0.01), in which the optimal combination in this study group showed the strongest anti-MRSA activity in vivo. The MST was 11.9 \u00b1 1.2 for the optimal combination group. ",
