These include coronaviruses causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS1), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS2\u20135), porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED6) and swine acute diarrhoea syndrome (SADS7); paramyxoviruses such as Hendra8 and Nipah9; and filoviruses like Marburg10 and Ebola11. Four families of viruses that are pathogenic for other mammalian species (Coronaviridae12, Paramyxoviridae13, Rhabdoviridae14 and Filoviridae15) may also have originated in bats. These viruses often cause serious disease in their secondary hosts, but most do not appear to cause clinical signs or pathology in bats16\u201318, suggesting that uniquely benign relationships have co-evolved between the viruses and their primary bat hosts19,20. While relatively little is known about the dynamics of viral infections in bats, these viruses may be maintained in bat populations as a result of either persistently infected individuals, reinfection after waning immunity, or spatial transmission dynamics21,22.",

The rate of viral shedding and the amount of detectable virus associated with bat colonies fluctuates, with periodic increases often linked to parturition, waning maternal immunity, nutritional stress or increased energy consumption17,24\u201329. Increased shedding of virus by a colony of bats may reflect an increase in the proportion and number of susceptible individuals, or an increase in the replication of persistent or latent virus normally suppressed by the host. For herpesviruses, reactivation from latency is linked to perturbations caused by a variety of physiological, immunological and psychological stressors30. The mechanisms that trigger the reactivation of latent or persistently infecting viruses are not clearly understood, but the increased shedding of viruses is correlated with some incidents of spill-over of bat viruses to other animals31.",

The fungus (Pseudogymnoascus destructans) causes white-nose syndrome (WNS) in hibernating bats, which is characterized by the growth of white fungal mycelia on the face and exposed skin of the wings and tail membranes. The visual and microscopic effects of P. destructans on the skin of the wings are associated with increased expression of several genes devoted to innate immunity and inflammation in wing tissue38,39. Profound systemic effects include dehydration, hypovolemia, metabolic acidosis, and fat depletion, which can lead to death40\u201342. Other systemic effects of bat WNS include an accumulation of neutrophils in the lungs, which is accompanied by an increase in the expression of several cytokine genes43 suggesting that even the most severely afflicted hibernating bats are capable of at least some systemic immune response to fungal infection.",

Similar interactive impacts of co-infection with P. destructans and viruses on bat immune responses are not known. We used M. lucifugus experimentally-infected with P. destructans and/or naturally infected with Myl-CoV as a model to understand how co-infections influence bat-virus interactions. This system allows us to avoid confounding factors of direct pathogen-pathogen interactions, because the fungus affects the skin, while the coronavirus infections occur internally, almost exclusively in the ileum and lungs32. We hypothesized that co-infection would alter the molecular response of bats to a persistent viral infection, and that viral shedding would change as a result of the increased or disrupted host immune response. To test this prediction, we examined tissues collected from M. lucifugus at the termination of an earlier study that quantified the effects and pathogenesis of P. destructans in hibernating bats experimentally infected with the fungus37, some of which were naturally infected with Myl-CoV32. This combination of uninfected, virus-infected, fungus-infected and co-infected M. lucifugus allowed us to test our hypothesis that host responses to co-infection are synergistic and not simply additive.",

Table 2 lists genes from the two processes that were significantly either up or down-regulated when virus-infected bats were compared to co-infected bats. For the MAPK pathway-related transcripts, genes such as RSU1 and RERG were up-regulated while those, such as STYK1, RRAD, MAP3K and SRC were down-regulated. For cytokine-related genes several transcripts were suppressed.

Coronavirus infection may in turn increase the severity of WNS pathology. This is the first study to examine the systemic effects of co-infection on either bat coronavirus or WNS, and our results raise important questions in regard to zoonotic spillover events. Although events of successful viral spillover to distantly related species are thought to be extremely rare, in recent years several coronaviruses have spilled over, including SARS-CoV1, MERS-CoV2\u20135, PEDV-CoV6 and SADS-CoV7. These viruses are thought to have originated in bats. In addition, circumstantial evidence suggests that most alpha and beta coronaviruses that parasitize other mammals may have originated in bats as well46. If so, then understanding host-pathogen interactions between bats and coronaviruses could inform our ability to predict or manage the risk of spillover. In this study, we showed that a coronavirus exhibits low activity in its natural host, M. lucifugus, but that co-infection with a fungus increases the quantity of viral RNA in the intestines. We have no reason to expect zoonotic transmission of the coronavirus i.e. Myl-CoV, but similar co-infection mechanisms may operate in tropical bat species harbouring potentially zoonotic viruses.",

The authors concluded that the targeted coronaviruses do not persist in their hosts but are maintained in populations by the introduction of new susceptible individuals.

IL22RA1 is the receptor present on host cells, including intestinal cells, which help in initiating cellular signalling in response to IL22 produced by T-cells54. IL-22 leads to an increase in anti-microbial peptide production, cellular protection against damage and increases cellular proliferation55. Therefore, reduced IL-22 signalling in the intestines of bats with WNS, might suppress the bat defences that control the coronavirus infection. Additionally, previous studies have shown that the anti-inflammatory gene, IL10, is expressed more in the lungs of bats with WNS than in bats without it43. We saw a similar trend with the levels of IL10 in the intestines which might play a role in suppressing the immune response against the coronavirus. Another altered cytokine gene which was of interest was the suppressor of cytokine signalling-6 (SOCS6) gene. Fungal-infected bats showed lower levels of SOCS6 transcripts, lack of which has been implicated in mild growth retardation in mice56. Overall, our results suggest that WNS triggers changes in gene expression in the ileum (Fig. 5). These may influence expression of interferon-stimulated-genes (ISGs), thereby leading to increased viral replication at the site of viral persistence. Interferon-related transcripts were more highly expressed in the ileum of virus-infected bats that did not have WNS, suggesting that the bat\u2019s response to WNS causes down-regulation of interferon activity. Interferons may control coronavirus replication, as seen in cases of SARS-CoV57 and MERS-CoV58. Therefore, a decrease in interferon activity might cause an increase in coronavirus (Myl-CoV) replication. In addition to interferon-related genes, we also found that RERG, which is related to growth inhibition, was upregulated in the fungus-infected bats when compared to virus-infected bats. Upregulation of RERG could affect the rate of cell proliferation in the intestines59. Finally, this cascade of responses is associated with increased severity of WNS symptoms.",

Direct interactions between the host and the secondary pathogen are limited to the affected tissue, but the systemic response to the disease triggers a cascade of immune responses, including increased release of cytokines or neutrophils. Affected cells such as intra-alveolar macrophages in the lungs or cells lining the intestine, may produce pro- or anti-inflammatory molecules and influence cells that harbour viral genomes.

Diagram summarizes the changes observed by comparing co-infected bats with virus-infected bats. Bats with persistent Myl-CoV infection exhibit relatively low viral shedding. When bats are also infected with P. destructans (shown in yellow arrow) and develop WNS, the level of coronavirus increases. There is a change in the level of some immune genes, such as IL22, RERG and possibly IL10, which may have an effect on immune response and cell proliferation. The increase in coronavirus levels in co-infected bats is possibly due to the bats\u2019 systemic response to WNS reducing innate anti-viral responses.",
