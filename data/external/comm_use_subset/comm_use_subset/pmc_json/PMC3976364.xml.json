            "text": "Influenza is a highly contagious disease of global importance. The virus infects a variety of animals including birds, and infects humans. Three subtypes of influenza A were previously reported to infect humans, i.e., H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 [1]. During the past few years, several subtypes of avian influenza A have been shown to cross the species barrier and infect humans. In the spring of 2013, a novel avian-origin influenza A virus, H7N9, emerged and spread among humans in China. The first documented case of human infection with the influenza H7N9 virus occurred in Shanghai in March [2]. As of May 9, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 131 laboratory-confirmed cases, including 32 deaths [3]. Of the 111 patients with the H7N9 virus infection has been reported recently, 76.6% were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) [4]. On admission, 108 patients (97.3%) had findings consistent with pneumonia. The clinical features, blood cell counts, and laboratory and biochemical findings in patients with H7N9 virus infection have been described [5]\u2013[7]. Patients usually presented with fever and cough, and with early sputum production. The illness progressed rapidly to severe pneumonia, with moderate-to-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome [5].",

The radiographic and CT findings were graded on a 3-point scale: 1 as normal attenuation, 2 as ground-glass attenuation, and 3 as consolidation. The CT scans were scored on the axial images. The ground-glass attenuation and consolidation areas were determined using the method described by Grieser et al [9]. The Hounsfield Units (HU) of normal attenuation, ground-glass attenuation and consolidation areas were measured. Each lung zone, with a total of six lung zones in each patient, was assigned a following scale according to distribution of the affected lung parenchyma using a method modified from a previously described protocol [10]: 0 as normal, 1 as <25% abnormality, 2 as 25\u201350% abnormality, 3 as 50\u201375% abnormality, and 4 as >75% abnormality. The four-point scale of the lung parenchyma distribution was then multiplied by the radiologic scale described above (Figure 1). Points from all zones were added for a final total cumulative score, with value ranging from 0 to 72.",

This is different from H1N1 pneumonia or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). In the previous reports, patients with H1N1 pneumonia or SARS who died were significantly older than those who survived [9], [13]. A possible explanation is the predominance of elderly patients in this outbreak of H7N9 virus infection. However, patients who died had significantly higher frequencies of mechanical ventilation and acute respiratory distress syndrome than those who survived. Acute respiratory distress syndrome is a strong predictor of mortality, which reflects the severity of respiratory failure [14]. Furthermore, for patients with H7N9 virus infection, mechanical ventilation is an important treatment when patients experience respiratory failure [15].",

For the survivors at discharge, their CT score is 30% lower compared with score at admission. Regarding the prediction of mortality, we found an optimal cutoff value of a chest radiographic score of 19 (sensitivity of 71% and specificity of 67%), and a CT score of 21 (sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 73%). The overall radiologic score was based on the severity of air-space disease and its distribution. The more extensive consolidations were observed in the mortality patients than in the survivors. This can be probably explained by the report that main cause of death is hypoxemia [4]. The previous studies stated that patients of viral pneumonias with consolidations on CT have a more severe clinical course than those who present with ground glass opacities [16], [17]. These abnormalities can be pathologically correlated with diffuse alveolar damage [18]. Patients who died tended to have more consolidation and asymmetric disease, while patients of viral pneumonias with bilateral consolidations had a more protracted clinical course [17]. Because H7N9 virus infection is an extremely contagious and potentially fatal disease, risk stratification in our study using the simple scoring method may help triage patient, and may indicate that more aggressive treatment and closely monitoring of disease progression should be applied to the patient with higher overall radiologic scores. However, the efficacy of such approaches to decrease mortality remains to be validated in future study.",

Our finding of a mixed pattern are consistent with the first report indicating that all three patients had coexisting ground glass opacities and consolidation on radiographs or CT on day 7 after the onset of illness [15], and consistent with a recent report in 111 cases [4]. However, this finding was different from the CT findings in H1N1 influenza A (H1N1) virus-associated pneumonia by Marchiori et al. [19] who noted that ground glass opacity (12/20, 60%) was the most common CT finding and that a mixed pattern (6/20,30%) was the second most common finding 4\u20139 days after the onset of symptoms. Studies on the CT findings of pneumonia due to H5N1 infection are limited and do not distinguish between ground glass opacity and consolidation [20]. In addition, mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy was rare. This finding is similar to the CT appearance of pneumonia caused by H1N1 and H5N1 virus infections, which have been consistently reported in other studies [21]\u2013[23]. A small pleural effusion was observed in 12 cases (55%), including bilateral effusion in 6 patients and unilateral effusion in 6 patients. Pleural effusions are generally considered rare with human influenza A infection [20]. However, these occurred relatively frequently in our patients. A previous study also reported pleural effusions with often severe coexisting consolidation observed in one third of 178 patients infected by H5N1 avian influenza virus, and the effusions were bilateral in nearly all patients during the course of the disease [23]. In addition, a small pleural effusion was previously observed in 5 patients (25%) with H1N1 infection using CT [19].",

Schematic coronal representation of zones (A) evaluated in the lungs of patients with H7N9 infection shows upper zones which are above the carina, middle zones between the carina and the inferior pulmonary vein, and lower zones which are below the inferior pulmonary vein. Schematic representation of the extent of ground-glass opacity (GGO) and consolidation (CO) on an axial image (B) which were determined using the modified Grieser system. Points from all zones were added for a cumulative score, with value ranging from 0 to 72. A sample scoring on an axial CT image (C) of a 52-year-old woman from mortality group demonstrates a total score of 18, calculated as 3 (consolidation, solid arrow) \u00d74 (>75% distribution in middle zone of the right lung) +2 (ground-glass opacity, open arrow) \u00d71 (<25% distribution in middle zone of the right lung) +2 (ground-glass opacity, open arrow) \u00d72 (25\u201350% distribution in middle zone of the left lung).",
