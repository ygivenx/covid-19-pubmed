Several reports demonstrated that the neutralizing antibody response exerts selective pressure during HIV-1 replication in vivo, which accounts in part for the extensive variation in the env gene observed soon after primary infection [1], [2]. Furthermore, selective pressure imposed by neutralizing antibodies has been demonstrated in a human trial where three neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) administered during HAART treatment-interruption led to a reduction in viremia followed by selection of escape mutants [3], [4]. Passive transfer studies in macaques showed that the administration of HIV-1 neutralizing mAbs protects against vaginal or intravenous challenge with SIV-HIV-1 chimeric viruses (SHIV) [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. In some models protection depended not only on viral neutralization but also on Fc-mediated antibody effector functions [10], [11].",

            "text": "HIV-1 is characterized by an extraordinary genetic diversity, reflected by the presence of several clades (subtypes), a fact that represents a significant impediment to vaccine development. Env is the most variable HIV-1 gene, with up to 35% sequence diversity among clades, 20% diversity within clades, and 10% diversity in a single infected individual [15], [16], [17]. Several conserved epitopes have been defined by a small panel of neutralizing mAbs isolated using different experimental approaches. One epitope that appears to be relatively conserved and overlaps with the CD4 binding site (CD4bs) on the surface Env glycoprotein gp120 is recognized by mAb b12, which is the most potent and broadly-reactive mAb of such specificity [18], [19], [20]. This site was recently shown to be a significant target of neutralizing antibodies present in the sera of selected patients [21], [22]. However, b12 was derived from a phage library in which heavy and light chains have been randomly re-assorted, thus its relevance to naturally-occurring B cell responses in HIV-1 infection is unclear. A second epitope in a carbohydrate-rich region on the outer domain of gp120 is composed of glycans recognized by mAb 2G12, which shows an unusual interlocked VH domain-swapped dimer generating an extended and monovalent binding surface [23], [24], [25], [26]. The 2G12 epitope is not present in the majority of clade C isolates [27], but, of more concern, no 2G12-like activity has been detected in the sera of HIV-1 infected individuals [21], [22], suggesting that this type of neutralizing antibody may not be generally amenable to elicitation by B cells. A third target of the broadly-neutralizing mAb 4E10, and relatively broad mAbs 2F5 and Z13, is located on the membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of the transmembrane glycoprotein gp41 [28], [29], [30], [31]. As with 2G12, MPER-specific neutralizing antibodies are infrequently encountered in the sera of HIV-1-infected individuals [21], [32], [33], potentially reducing their relevance to vaccine development strategies. Moreover, MPER-specific mAbs have features that suggest they are products of autoreactive B cells, casting doubts over the possibility of inducing such antibodies by vaccination [34]. A fourth target of neutralizing mAbs is the V3 loop, which is immunogenic but also a highly variable region involved in Env-coreceptor binding. Antibodies to the V3 loop, such as mAbs 447-52D and F425-B4E8, are mostly effective against neutralization sensitive (Tier-1) viruses and have generally a limited breadth of reactivity almost exclusively specific for clade B viruses, reflecting their provenance from clade B-infected individuals [11], [35], [36], [37]. A cluster of human V3 mAbs raised from B cells derived from non-B clade-infected individuals showed variable neutralizing activity for two AG and two C clade primary isolates, although these were particularly neutralization sensitive [38]. Finally, the CD4-induced (CD4i) site has been described as a neutralization epitope primarily on Tier-1 isolates with limited accessibility on Tier-2 isolates [39]. Very recently, the isolation and partial characterization of two related MAbs from a clade A-infected donor that appear to have very broad and potent neutralization profiles was reported [40]. These MAbs recognize a discontinuous epitope only expressed on the native Env trimer, made up of segments of the CD4i, V2 and V3 loops. This publication is the first to provide new broadly neutralizing reagents from a non-clade B donor and provides proof-of-principle that new neutralization specificities remain to be discovered on HIV-1 Env.",

Our primary aims were: i) to isolate novel MAbs with cross-clade neutralizing activity from non-B clade donors; ii) to analyze the memory B cell repertoire in a representative panel of predominantly non-B clade-infected individuals. By using an improved memory B cell immortalization method [41], combined with high-throughput parallel screening with a panel of recombinant Env-based antigens, we isolated a panel of 58 human mAbs which we have characterized with regard to epitope specificity and breadth of neutralization. We have more fully characterized three mAbs from this panel that demonstrated complementary and relatively broad cross-clade neutralizing profiles that target the gp120 CD4bs and the V3 crown, and the gp41 heptad repeat 1 (HR-1).",

At the Institute for Tropical Medicine a panel of 4 primary A strains (VI191, 92UG37, VI820, VI 1031), 4 primary C strains (VI829, VI882, VI1144, VI1358) and 6 primary CRF02 strains (VI1090, VI2680, CI20, CA18, VI1380, VI2727) was used to select patients with >80% neutralization was measured at a 1/20 dilution of plasma. The plasma dilution was mixed with virus for 24 hours and absorbed to PHA/IL-2 stimulated freshly isolated PBMC for 1 hour. Virus-antibody mixture was then removed by extensive washing and p24 ELISA was performed after 14 days of culture to determine neutralization. At Queen Mary University of London, the TZMbl-based recombinant pseudovirus assay was employed with a selected panel of Tier 2-type clade A, B, C, CRF02_AG, _AE, F and BF viruses to measure >50% neutralization at a 1/20 dilution. MAbs were isolated using a previously described improved EBV immortalization method [41]. Culture supernatants were harvested 14 days after immortalization and assayed in parallel for binding to trimeric gp140 proteins (UG37, clade A and CN54, clade CRF07_BC) [48], monomeric gp120 (CN54, CRF07_BC and IIIB, clade B) and gp41 recombinant ectodomain (HxB2, clade B). Those that were positive were then subcloned and grown up on a large scale for supernatant purification. The purity of all mAb preparations was assessed using a chromogenic LAL endotoxin assay (Genscript) and endotoxin levels were always <0.05 EU/ml.",

Briefly, appropriate dilutions of the virion-containing culture supernatants were pre-incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h with mAbs at various concentrations. The virus-mAb mixtures were added to HOS-CD4-CCR5 cells and incubated for 3 days at 37\u00b0C. A similar protocol was used for supernatants screening using TZM-bl cells [45]. The cells were then lysed with Britelite reagent (Perkin-Elmer) and the relative light units in the cell lysates were determined on a luminometer microplate reader (Veritas, Turner Biosystems). The 50% inhibitory dose (IC50) was defined as the sample concentration at which relative luminescence units were reduced 50% compared to virus control wells. Some of the neutralization data for the reference mAbs b12, 2G12, 2F5 and 4E10 are taken from previous analyses [41], [42] carried out under identical standardized conditions to those used for the new mAbs reported here. A multi-cycle virus replication assay was used to measure the neutralization of replication competent luciferase-encoding viruses in 5.25.EGFP.Luc.M7 cells [52]. This cell line is a genetically engineered clone of CEMx174 that expresses multiple SIV and HIV-1 entry receptors (CD4, CCR5, CXCR4, GPR15/Bob) [53]. For the neutralization assay, 5000 tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50) of virus was incubated with multiple dilutions of test sample in triplicate for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C in a total volume of 150 \u00b5l in 96-well flat-bottom culture plates. A 100 \u00b5l suspension of cells (5\u00d7105 cells/ml of growth medium containing 25 \u00b5g DEAE dextran/ml) was added to each well. Plates were incubated until approximately 10% of cells in virus control wells were positive for GFP expression by fluorescence microscopy (approximately 3 days). At this time, 100 \u00b5l of cell suspension was transferred to a 96-well white solid plate (Costar) for measurements of luminescence using the Britelite Luminescence Reporter Gene Assay System (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).",

We used a large multi-clade panel comprising 10 Tier-1 and 82 Tier-2 isolates including clade B early-transmitted viruses [61]. The three new mAbs showed a pattern that was clearly distinct from that of previously described mAbs (\nFigure 2\n). In particular, HGN194 neutralized with high potency all Tier-1 viruses from clade A, B and C and 11% of Tier-2 viruses. By contrast HJ16 neutralized only 1 out of 10 Tier-1 viruses, but neutralized 39% of Tier-2 viruses. Thus HJ16 is comparable to b12 and 2F5 in terms of percentage of Tier-2 isolate neutralization and is superior to 2G12 and 447-52D. 4E10, as previously reported [27], [41] showed an extremely broad pattern of reactivity. Taken together the above results indicate that novel neutralizing mAbs can be isolated from memory B cells of non-clade B HIV-1-infected individuals, some of which display relatively broad neutralizing activity. Since one of our primary aims was to isolate and characterize novel MAbs with unusually broad and potent neutralization activity, we focused our attention on HJ16, HK20 and HGN194.",

When compared with the CD4bs-specific mAb b12 for gp120 binding, HJ16 showed similar binding curves (\nFigure 3A\n) and inhibited to a comparable extent the binding of gp120 to solid-phase sCD4 (\nFigure 3B\n, IC50 values of 1.57 and 1.16 \u00b5g/ml, respectively). However, cross-competition analysis of HJ16 and b12 for binding to gp120 revealed incomplete heterologous inhibition, with plateau values of approximately 80% (\nFigure 3C-D\n). These results suggest that HJ16 and b12 recognize related but non-overlapping CD4bs-proximal epitopes. To further characterize HJ16 specificity we measured its binding to two YU2 gp120 mutants: the D368R mutant, which is not bound by CD4 or CD4bs-specific mAbs [21] and the I420R mutant, which is not recognized by CD4i-specific mAbs [62]. As already reported, b12 bound the I420R CD4i mutant, but failed to recognize the D368R CD4bs mutant. By contrast, HJ16 bound both mutants and indeed bound better to the D368R CD4bs mutant compared to the wild-type molecule (\nFigure 3E-F\n). Attempts to map the epitope by Pepscan analysis using overlapping linear peptides were unsuccessful (not shown), consistent with HJ16 recognition of a discontinuous epitope.",

Another interesting finding is that HJ16 does not discriminate between clades as much as b12, 2G12 and 2F5 (e.g. b12 and 2G12 rarely neutralize clade A isolates while 2F5 and 2G12 rarely neutralize clade C isolates, Table S3). These results reveal a largely non-overlapping pattern of reactivity of HJ16 and b12 and suggest that the combination of these two mAbs could be effective against a dominant fraction of HIV-1 isolates (57/82, i.e. 69%).

Similarly, the epitope of 7 additional gp120-specific mAbs was mapped to the same V3 region using different peptide libraries generated from the sequence of the isolate to which each mAb was mostly reactive (\nFigure 4A\n). The minimal sequence recognized by these mAbs ranged from 7 to 17 amino acids and, with a single exception, comprised the G(A)PGR/Q/K sequence, which is modeled to interact with CCR5 or CXCR4 during the viral entry process [63]. However, in contrast to HGN194 which neutralizes with high potency all Tier-1 isolates tested, the other V3-specific mAbs neutralized only a few Tier-1 isolates (\nFigure 1A-B\n\n and \n\nFigure 2\n), similar to the activity of other recently characterized V3 loop-specific mAbs derived from non-B clade infected individuals [38]. We confirmed the neutralization activity of HGN194 in an M7 cell-based assay challenged with replication-competent HIV-1 viruses carrying a Luc reporter [52] and we observed that 3/5 clade B viruses were neutralized (Table S5).",

We therefore compared intact IgG and Fab fragments of HK20 for their capacity to neutralize a panel of 22 pseudoviruses in the HOS-based assay. The HK20 Fab fragments showed markedly increased breadth and potency compared to IgG, being able to neutralize 21/22 isolates with IC50 values ranging from 0.01 to 5.7 \u00b5g/ml (\nFigure 5D-E\n\nand Table S4). By contrast, HK20 IgG neutralized 19/22 isolates with IC50 values ranging from 1.46 to 84 \u00b5g/ml. In addition, when the HK20 Fab fragment was tested in the TZM-bl assay it neutralized 10 out of 33 isolates with IC50 values ranging between 0.4 and 8.8 \u00b5g/ml (Table S2), thus suggesting that the lack of activity observed with HK20 IgG was possibly associated to a different susceptibility of this cell line to this type of entry inhibitors. Overall, these findings suggest that the reduced size of the Fab molecule allows increased access to the HR-1 region and imply that HR-1 accessibility is largely dependent on the target cell used. This is similar in concept to the enhanced neutralization profiles of Fab and ScFv specific for the CD4i surface [39]. Further studies using M7 cells [52] challenged with replication-competent HIV-1 viruses carrying a Luc reporter showed that HK20 exhibits broad neutralization consistent with the results from the HOS cell assay but unlike the TZM-bl assay, being able to neutralize 4 out 5 viruses tested (Table S5).",

A first group of mAbs was assigned to the V3 loop based on cross-competition with two V3 loop specific mAbs (HR10 and HGA9). This group comprised 8 mAbs, which were already mapped to the V3 loop using the Pepscan analysis approach, and 7 additional mAbs that were not analyzed by peptide scanning (i.e. HGF9, HGT4, HGP21, HGP51, HGW48, HGD129 and HGP27). Four mAbs (HX44, HGP105, HGW7, HGY38) reacted with wt and CD4bs YU2 mutants but failed to bind the CD4i mutant, and therefore were assigned to the CD4i cluster. Notably, one mAb (HGP68) was mapped by Pepscan analysis to a novel epitope in the V2 loop (TVYALFYRLDIVP) and neutralized 4 Tier-1 isolates (Table S2). Fifteen other mAbs were assigned tentatively or conclusively to the CD4bs based on their capacity to inhibit gp120-sCD4 binding. Most of these mAbs competed other CD4bs-specific mAbs, such as b12 and HJ16, while in some cases this assay could not be performed due to lack of epitope expression on the gp120 proteins used. Furthermore, this group of mAbs showed variable reactivities with the YU2 mutants. While most of them did not bind the D368R mutant similar to b12, others including HJ16, bound this mutant avidly. In addition, most of these new CD4bs-specific mAbs also showed decreased binding to the CD4i mutant, suggesting that they may span a broader, as yet undescribed region that includes elements of the CD4bs and CD4i sites.

MAbs HGK129, HGN146 and HGN35 were assigned to the C-C loop since they competed with 3D6 [43], reacted with an HR2 construct and recognized synthetic peptides within this region. MAbs HGW17 and HGY25 were provisionally assigned to the C-C region since they competed with 3D6. These data are consistent with the immunodominance of the C-C region and with the notion that the antibody response against this region overlaps with the 3D6 epitope. Several mAbs competed with 5F3 and HK20, and bound both the HR-1 and 5HB constructs, suggesting that they may bind between the fusion peptide and the HR-1 region. HGB33 was provisionally assigned to the HR-1 region according to competition with HK20 and binding to the 5HB construct. Other mAbs bound specifically the 5HB construct but did not compete with any of the mAbs tested, thus indicating that the complete HR-1 coiled coil region exposed in 5HB harbors antibody epitopes available for B cell recognition in the gp41 pre-hairpin conformation [65], [66]. The concomitant binding to recombinant gp41 suggests that the latter may partially resemble the gp41 pre-fusion state. Of note, three gp41 binding mAbs (HGP40, HGP48 and HGY50) neither competed with any of the mAbs tested, nor bound to any constructs representing pre-hairpin conformations or native gp140 (Figure S1), indicating that they recognize as yet uncharacterized regions that are only available in the recombinant gp41 protein. Interestingly, mAb HGF24 was assigned by Pepscan analysis to an epitope in the C-terminal region of HR-2 (TNLIYTLIEESQN), proximal to the 2F5 epitope, and neutralized 4 Tier-2 isolates (Table S2). This mAb competed with HK20 for gp41 binding, in spite of their distinct cognate specificities (HR-2 and HR-1, respectively). This finding would be consistent with the proximity of HR-1 and HR2 in the six-helix bundle structure. Finally, although the gp41 protein used in the primary screening includes the 2F5 and 4E10 epitopes, no MPER specific mAbs were isolated, reinforcing the idea that this portion of gp41 is poorly immunogenic in humans [21], [22]\n",

In this respect, b12 was isolated from a phage library, while 2F5, 4E10 and 2G12, although isolated from memory B cells, do not appear to have a counterpart in human sera [22]. In a recent study, Nussenzweig and coworkers used trimeric gp140 to isolate antigen-binding memory B cells from which 500 antibody sequences were retrieved by single-cell PCR [62]. Surprisingly, although the B cell donors had broadly neutralizing serum activity, none of the mAbs isolated had this property. This raised the possibility that broad serum neutralizing activity results from multiple clonal responses each of unique epitope specificity but restricted breadth of viral strain recognition. However, an alternative interpretation might be that since available recombinant trimeric antigens vary in structure, the \u2018bait\u2019 used for B cell isolation was not optimal for enriching those secreting neutralizing antibodies. Our results indicate that monoclonal antibodies with a limited spectrum of neutralizing activity can be easily isolated, while those with a broad pattern of cross-clade reactivity are rare, in line with the study of Walker et al [40] and consistent with inferences from serum neutralization specificity mapping analyses [21]. In this respect our study demonstrates the feasibility of the EBV immortalization method, which is limited only by the size of the blood samples obtained (20\u201350 ml of peripheral blood).",

The selection of a high-percentage of trimer binding specificities may be a consequence our use of trimeric Env antigens during the screening of the EVB-B cell supernatants. The second aspect relates to gp41-specific antibodies, which, with a few remarkable exceptions, were not neutralizing.

HJ16 showed a breadth of neutralizing activity comparable to, and generally complementary to b12, which aside from PG9 and PG16 [40] is currently the most potent of the relatively broad neutralizing antibodies available. HJ16 also showed selective neutralization of multiple Tier-2 isolates, making it particularly relevant as a template for vaccine design. HGN194 binds to an extremely conserved epitope in the V3 crown, and neutralizes all Tier-1, but only 11% of Tier-2 isolates tested. HGN194 showed broader activity than the well-characterized V3-specific mAb 447-52D against a panel of 92 pseudoviruses. The preference for Tier-1 isolates characteristic of V3-specific mAbs is consistent with the idea that the V3 loop is displayed to varying degrees in the context of the native trimeric Env protein of individual isolates [67], [68] and with the recent observation that sCD4 broadens neutralization of V3 mAbs [69]. The results obtained with HK20 are particularly intriguing, since this mAb has a broad pattern of neutralization observed with HOS but not TZMbl target cells. This mAb recognizes a highly conserved epitope in the HR-1 trimer and it is more effective as an Fab fragment as compared to intact IgG, a fact that is may be explained by the limited accessibility of the epitope, which is likely to be exposed only transiently on the cell surface during the viral entry process [70]. Intriguingly, a recent study indicates that in TZM-bl cells HIV-1 pseudoviruses penetrate the cytoplasm from within endosomes rather than from the cell surface [71], a finding that might help explain the lack of activity of HK20 in the TZMbl assay if binding of this mAb is affected by the endosomal environment. Further studies on primary cells will be required to address the relative importance of these two entry pathways and to establish whether HK20 may be capable of exerting a broad and potent neutralizing activity in vivo. Preliminary studies using M7 cells [52] challenged with replication-competent HIV-1 viruses carrying a Luc reporter showed that HK20 exhibits reasonably broad neutralization consistent with the results from the HOS cell assay, and similar to Fab HK20 in the TZM-bl cell assay. Whereas the TZM-bl assay is sensitive for certain antibodies such as CD4bs mAbs, some mAbs such as 2G12 to other epitopes are less sensitive to neutralization in this assay [72], perhaps owing to the unnaturally high level of CCR5 expression on the TZM-bl cells [60]. In this respect, low coreceptor expression levels have been associated with delayed fusion kinetics and hence enhanced virus sensitivity to HR-1 binding inhibitors, such as T-20 [73]. Therefore, despite the advantages of high throughput with the TZM-bl assay, alternative neutralization assays might have closer relevance to the in vivo situation.",
