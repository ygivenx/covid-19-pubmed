            "text": "The most common mammalian model used for influenza virus research, the mouse, is not susceptible to infection with many unadapted human influenza A viruses of the H3N2 serotype and does not shed virus from the respiratory tract. Ferrets and macaques have increased tropisms to many primary influenza isolates but both are expensive to maintain and difficult to house. Based largely on their recapitulation of human disease signs, ferrets have also been used to derive serotyping reagents for assessing antigenic distance between isolates and potential vaccine strains. However, recent reports suggest that ferrets may not faithfully mimic human immune responses, and that serological tests using ferret sera may not accurately assess vaccine strain efficacy [1,2]. Therefore, there is a need to develop additional permissive small animal models of influenza virus infection that exhibit virus shedding. Serial samples collected from such animal models allow the investigator to determine both the titer and duration of virus shedding from individual animals at multiple times without euthanasia. Further characterization of animal models capable of replicating and transmitting unadapted human, avian, and/or swine influenza viruses can be valuable for studying and testing new and improved vaccines, immunobiotics and anti-virals. Two promising alternative animal models, guinea pigs and cotton rats, have recently been investigated for the analysis of human influenza virus and influenza vaccine [3,4]. These studies focus on the guinea pig as a model for influenza.",

Guinea pigs are relatively inexpensive and easy to maintain for larger studies compared to ferrets and simians. They are readily infected with primary isolates of human influenza strains, and have potential uses for virus evolutionary, prophylactic and therapeutic studies [3]. A small number of reports describing experimental infection of guinea pigs with human influenza viruses were published in the 1970 s and 80 s [5-8]. More recently, we and others have advanced the guinea pig model for the study of virus infection and spread and as a vaccine-challenge model [3]. Guinea pigs can be readily infected with human influenza isolates without prior tissue culture or animal adaptation. The infection in guinea pigs appears to be centered largely in the upper naso-respiratory tract and the animals can pass the virus to others via aerosol transmission [9]. A recent study demonstrated acute viral replication and moderate virulence of the highly pathogenic 1918 pandemic and H5N1 viruses in addition to low-pathogenicity avian and human H1N1 viruses in guinea pigs [10].",

Nasal wash samples were collected at 2, 3, 6 and 9 days post infection (dpi). The guinea pigs exhibited no outward clinical signs of infection and virus was recovered from nasal washes of each animal between 2 and 6 dpi [3]. Peak titers of progeny virus in this study occurred on day 3 and were in the range of 5 \u00d7 104 and 2 \u00d7 105 pfu/mL of nasal wash fluid (Long et al, in preparation). Serological samples were prepared over the course of the regimen for analysis of total anti-HA antibodies by HA ELISA, antiviral antibodies by HI assay, and identification of linear HA epitopes by PepScan ELISA. Equal volumes of sera from each individual were used to produce pools for each time point in each group. To assess the levels of total HA-specific antibodies, serological samples were assayed by ELISA using plates coated with commercially prepared full-length Wyoming HA glycoprotein (Figure 1). Inoculation with virus and subsequent infection of these guinea pigs resulted in a rise in ELISA titer to the HA protein by the 2nd week which continued to increase through Week 4.",

In the process of developing and testing vaccines for the stimulation of broadened immunity, it is necessary to raise sera in multiple species of animals for analysis of cross-strain antiviral responses. In addition, it would be helpful to assess protection from cross-strain challenge in multiple animal models. Because of the attractiveness of the guinea pig model for infection with influenza, we have characterized the immune responses after infection or immunization of guinea pigs. Here we present an immunological comparison between guinea pigs infected intranasally with an H3N2 virus and those immunized with the homologous HA glycoprotein, an attractive potential subunit vaccine candidate.",

The data demonstrated that guinea pigs readily seroconvert in response to both intranasal inoculations of virus and immunizations with the same recombinant HA glycoprotein. A rise in binding antibodies (ELISA positive) preceded the development of antiviral antibodies as determined by hemagglutinin-inhibition (HI positive) for both infected and immunized groups of guinea pigs. The initial lag period was followed by strong correlation between the continued elevation of binding and antiviral (HI) antibodies. ELISA titers rose to approximately 1:100 titers after single inoculations with either infectious virus or purified HA antigen. Peak ELISA titers of infected animals reached 1:10,000, while those of immunized animals reached 1:100,000. However, if Groups 3 and 4 had been limited to only two doses, then titers may have more closely matched Group 2. Measurable antiviral titer required a second dose of virus or immunogen. HI titers of both infected and immunized animals reached approximately 1:1000 and decayed slightly over time. The lack of measurable antiviral immune responses observed before the second inoculation of any of the experimental groups may be due to the lower sensitivity of the HI assay, and is not necessarily an indication that the first infection or immunization did not elicit HI responses. Both ELISA and antiviral antibody titers persisted for many weeks following the final infectious innocula or boost with HA protein. Little, if any, decay of ELISA or HI titers were observed through Week 26 following the final HA immunization at Week 10.",

            "text": "A better understanding of the epitopes recognized by the anti-HA antibody responses in this experimental animal model, and how these epitopes compare to the human immune response, could facilitate more rapid advancements in vaccine design. Five dominant epitopes (A-E) of the HA glycoprotein have been previously characterized by both immunological reactivity in humans and animals, and by evolutionary variability in naturally infected humans. A PepScan analysis was conducted to map the linear B cell epitopes and was intended to correlate immunological reactivity with previous data derived in other animals and in humans. Analysis of conformational epitopes recognized by infected and immunized guinea pigs will be the subject of a future study. Previous immunological studies using overlapping peptides to characterize linear epitopes in influenza and other pathogens have had mixed results [14-19]. Although PepScans have identified epitopes in HIV, Measles, SARs, and Borna virus, most prior studies with this type of analysis failed to detect linear epitopes within the HA glycoprotein [20-22]. However, the continued improvements in peptide synthesis suggested that the approach should be revisited and expanded to encompass the entire HA protein. Interestingly, the data from this study identified two immunodominant epitopes, represented by peptides with N-terminal amino acids 141 and 327, which are recognized by both pre-immune and immune sera. While the interpretation of reactivity by pre-immune sera remains open, these results suggest that recognition of viral epitopes is present in the innate repertoire. If so, it is possible that pre-infection recognition plays a role in skewing the immune system towards a more oligoclonal rather than polyclonal response. Induction of an immune response limited to a small set of epitopes may accentuate recognition of immunodominant epitopes that are often present in regions of high genetic variability in Class II pathogens [13]. The ability to take advantage of the propensity of host immune systems to mount strain-specific immune responses largely limited to variable immunodominant epitopes may be a pathogenesis trait that influenza and other viruses have evolved so as to increase fitness on a landscape made more rugged by host immunity.",

Unexpectedly, reactivities to additional peptides (9, 327, 453, and 483) derived from regions outside of previously defined epitopes, and near the transmembrane domain, were observed after multiple immunizations and two infectious innocula. The amino acid sequences at the cores of these peptides are highly conserved among influenza A strains. The observation of linear epitopes does not preclude the reactivity of the sera to more dominant conformational epitopes that were not detected by this method. However, in a recent study of cross-reactive epitopes in avian influenza serotypes, Meuller et al. identified several linear epitopes in the HA of H4, H5, and H12 through a similar use of overlapping peptide ELISA [24]. We have aligned the sets of peptides used in both studies to determine analogous peptides so that the results can be compared more easily (data not shown). Interestingly, analogues of many of the H3N2 peptides that were recognized in the present study were also recognized by sera against the avian HA glycoproteins. Avian sera recognized analogues to peptides 141 and 327, which were recognized by pre-immune Guinea pig sera. In addition, avian sera also recognized analogues to peptides 9, 453, and 483. The contribution of reactivity to these peptides towards antiviral activities will require further investigation.

The infected guinea pigs mounted vigorous immune responses that had antiviral activities as measured by HI assay. Guinea pigs immunized with purified HA protein developed similar antiviral activities. Pepscan data determined that sera from na\u00efve animals recognize a linear epitope in the defined A epitope and another epitope near the fusion or HA cleavage sites. Further studies will be required to determine whether these innate reactivities are also found in sera from na\u00efve humans. If so, it will be important to assess whether these antibodies offer any protective immunity, or are dysregulatory in nature. Pepscan data also demonstrated the reactivity of sera from infected and immunized animals to linear determinants located both within and outside of previously defined major epitopes. The change in PepScan profiles over the course of the immunization and infection regimens appeared to reflect maturation of the humoral immune responses to linear epitopes. By altering the immunogenicity of the most dominant, yet variable, epitopes, it may be possible to refocus the immune response towards more highly conserved epitopes to derive a more broadly cross-protective influenza vaccine [13,14]. Subunit vaccines, along with well-defined animal models for influenza research, have the potential to more rapidly, and accurately guide the development of future vaccines for both seasonal and pandemic influenza outbreaks.",

After expression, conditioned supernatants containing the secreted HA protein were clarified at 2,000 \u00d7 g for 20 min. The HA protein was purified through a multi-step process including chromatographies on copper-charged Fast Flow Sepharose (GE Bio) using elution with 50 mM imidazole, lentil lectin agarose (Vector Labs) using elution with 0.5 M alpha-methly-D-mannoside, and, finally, anion exchange in DE53 resin (Whatman) at pH 8.8 with elution in 50-100 mM NaCl.

Group 2 (n = 2), were lightly anesthetized and intranasally inoculated with 1 mL of A/Wyoming/03/2003 influenza virus (3 \u00d7 104 pfu/mL). Animals were re-infected at five weeks after the first inoculation with the same dose of virus. Guinea pigs in Groups 3 and 4 (n = 4) were subcutaneously immunized with recombinant HA protein in Complete Freund's Adjuvant (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and boosted at weeks 3, 5, and 10 with HA protein in Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to characterize the boosting effects of the HA antigen. Initial experimental design also included a comparison of increasing antigen load to study how the animals responded to increasing concentrations of antigen. This was an attempt to scale the amount of recombinant HA protein to that which would be presented by natural infection. Animals in Group 3 were immunized three times with 10 micrograms each, and then given a final boost of 40 micrograms at 10 weeks post-prime. Group 4 animals were immunized three times with 30 micrograms of recombinant HA, with a final boost of 40 micrograms. At the same intervals, Group 1 control guinea pigs were immunized with the mock protein preparation derived from the insect cell system used to propagate the HA recombinant antigen.",

After additional washes, bound conjugates were quantitated by the addition of tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (KPL) for 90 sec, followed by an equal volume of 0.1N sulphuric acid. Plates were read at 450 nm and mean values of triplicate wells were calculated. Plate backgrounds were determined from antigen-coated wells detected with secondary antibody only. ELISA extinction titers were calculated as the maximum serum dilutions that resulted in a signal that exceeded a value that was three times plate background (approximately 0.15 OD units). Mean values with error bars equal to one standard deviation of the triplicate were graphed as a function of time over the course of the study.",
