The animal use protocols were performed in accordance with the approved guidelines. Approximately 100 \u03bcl of 3% sucrose in PBS containing 50 \u03bcg of pSARS-PLpro, empty vector or solvent alone were injected into a right chest of mouse using a 1-ml syringe with a 28-gage needle every 2 days. Each group of 5 eight-weeks-old BALB/c male mice was injected 15 times, and then sacrificed. The lung tissues of each mouse in indicated groups were collected for immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, and SYBR Green real time RT-PCR, respectively. For IHC staining, mouse lung tissues were fixed in formaldehyde and dehydrated in 70% ethanol for 30 min, in 95% ethanol for 30 min, and finally in 100% ethanol for 30 min. The tissues were embedded in paraffin at 58 \u00b0C, then cut at 4\u201315 \u03bcm thick section using a rotary microtome. Before staining, the sections were floated in a 56 \u00b0C water bath and mounted the sections onto slides. The slides with paraffin embedded section of mouse lung tissue were dewaxed in xylene 2 times for 5 min, rehydrated in 100% ethanol for 1 min, in 90% ethanol for 1 min, and finally in 80% ethanol for 1 min. Slides with mouse lung tissues were incubated in 3%H2O2 for 1 min to remove endogenous peroxidase activity, washed with PBS, and heated with 100 \u00b0C EDTA pH 9.0 for 20 min to induce antigen retrieval. Subsequently, slides were blocked with a protein block solution, and incubated with primary antibodies for 30 min, including mouse anti-E. coli synthesized PLpro serum, anti-mouse CD11b, anti-mouse TGF\u03b21 (Cell signaling), and anti-mouse vimentin (GeneTex). After washing with PBS, slides were reacted with Polymer-HRP for 20 min, developed using DAB substrate, and counterstained with hematoxylin. For collagen determination, the tissue sections were stained with Sirius red solution for 2 h, and then rinsed 10 times with 0.5% glacial acetic acid in PBS. After dehydrating with ethanol, stained sections were mounted on the glass slides, and then examined using light microscopy (Olympus, BX50).

Transient transfection of A549 cells with empty vector or pSARS-PLpro was performed to analyze the TGF-\u03b21 production induced by SARS PLpro. Quantitative PCR, immunofluorescence staining, and Western blotting indicated transfection with pSARS-PLpro increasing the mRNA and protein levels of PLpro in A549 cells in a concentration-dependent manner, but not empty control vector (Fig. 1A\u2013D). Meanwhile, relative mRNA levels of TGF-\u03b21 in A549 cells were time- and concentration-dependently elevated following the transient transfection with pSARS-PLpro, but not vector control (Fig. 2A). Immunofluorescence staining assays indicated the protein levels of TGF-\u03b21 obviously heightening in transfected cells with pSARS-PLpro compared to vector control (Fig. 2B). For examining the TGF-\u03b21 induction of SARS-CoV PLpro in different cell lines, Huh7 (human hepatocarcinoma), H1299 (human non-small cell lung carcinoma), and ca9-22 (human oral cancer) cells were also evaluated (Supplemental Fig. 1). Real-time RT PCR analysis of transfected cells with pSARS-PLpro indicated that a lower level of TGF-\u03b21 mRNA was detected in transfected H1299 cells compared to transfected A549 cells, but no significant level was found in transfected Huh7 and ca9-22 cells. In addition, comparison of the expression levels of PLpro and TGF-\u03b21 among transfected cells with empty vector, pSARS-PLpro, and pBAC-SARSCoV\u0394ES (a non-infectious SARS-CoV replicon) was further performed (Supplemental Fig. 2). The expression level of PLpro in transfected cells with pSARS-PLpro was 25-fold higher than the cells transfected with pBAC-SARSCoV\u0394ES. A dose-dependent increase of TGF-\u03b21 mRNA levels in A549 cells was induced by pSARS-PLpro and pBAC-SARSCoV\u0394ES, respectively. Meanwhile, recombinant plasmids containing PLpro genes of MERS-CoV and HCoV NL63 (pMERS-PLpro, and pNL63-PLpro) were used for testing the specificity on the TGF-\u03b21 induction compared to pSARS-PLpro (Supplemental Fig. 3). Interestingly, only SARS-CoV PLpro, but not ERS-CoV and HCoV NL63 PLpro, dose-dependently up-regulated the mRNA expression of TGF-\u03b21. Therefore, the result demonstrated that SARS-CoV PLpro plays an important role in triggering a significant increase of TGF-\u03b21 mRNA and protein levels in human lung epithelial cells.",

The mRNA levels of vimentin and GFAP were up-regulated in transfected cells with pSARS-PLpro, but not vector control (Fig. 3A,B). Besides, Western blotting showed the plasmid dose-dependent increase of vimentin proteins in PLpro-expressing cells, but not in vector controls (Fig. 3C,D). Next, a selective inhibitor of TGF-\u03b21 receptor (SB-431542) was used to test the association of pro-fibrotic gene up-regulation with the TGF-\u03b21 induction in PLpro-expressing cells (Fig. 3E). SB-431542 exhibited a dose-dependently inhibitory effect on SARS-PLpro-induced expression of vimentin (Fig. 3D).

Immunofluorescence imaging analysis indicated NF-\u03baB and Sp-1 were localized in the nucleus as well as Erg-1 was localized in the cytoplasm of vector control cells (Fig. 5A\u2013C). However, PLpro stimulated the translocation of Erg-1 into the nucleus, but inactivated the NF-\u03baB and Sp-1 that were localized in the cytoplasm as an inactive complex (Fig. 5A\u2013C). The finding correlated with the previous report in that SARS CoV PLpro has the inhibitory ability on the activation of NF-\u03baB into nucleus10. In addition, Western blotting indicated SARS-CoV PLpro causing the increased expression of Egr-1 in plasmid dose-dependent manners (Fig. 5D,E). Subsequently, gene silencing of Erg-1 by RNA interference was performed to examine the role of Egr-1 in PLpro-induced up-regulation of TGF-\u03b21 and pro-fibrotic responses (Fig. 6). Egr-1 siRNA, not non-targeting siRNA, definitely reduced mRNA and protein levels of Egr-1, TGF-\u03b21, vimentin and \u03b1-SMA in PLpro-expressing cells, but slightly decreased them in vector control cells. The result demonstrated gene silencing of Egr1 linked with the decrease of TGF-\u03b21 promoter activation and pro-fibrotic responses in PLpro-expressing cells. The finding revealed Egr-1 up-regulated by SARS-CoV PLpro playing a crucial role in the activation of TGF-\u03b21 promoter, as well as the induction of TGF-\u03b21-mediated pro-fibrotic responses in SARS pathogenesis.",

Interestingly, the inhibitor of TGF-\u03b21 receptor (SB-431542) significantly reduced PLpro-induced expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 at baseline, but partially inhibited the expression of TSP-1 (Fig. 7A).

Egr-1 gene silencing significantly reduced the mRNA expression of TSP-1 in PLpro-expressing cells (Fig. 7B). The results indicated that Egr-1-dependent up-regulation of TSP-1 as well as TGF-\u03b21-mediated activation of MMP2, MMP9, and TSP-1 expressions were responsible for the proteolytic cleavage of latent TGF-\u03b2 in PLpro-expressing cells.",

Intracellular ROS levels in PLpro-expressing and vector control cells were detected using flow cytometry with DCFH-DA staining (Fig. 8A). DCF fluorescence analysis indicated PLpro triggered the ROS generation in a dose dependent manner. Meanwhile, ROS inhibitor (YCG063) concentration-dependently reduced PLpro-induced up-regulation of Egr-1 and TSP-1(Fig. 8B). For insight into the pathway of ROS-mediated Egr-1 up-regulation, the activity of MAP kinases and transcription factors were analyzed using Western blotting (Fig. 9A,B). ROS inhibitor (YCG063) significantly reduced PLpro-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and STAT3. Furthermore, p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB203580) notably declined the PLpro-induced expression of Egr-1, TGF-\u03b21 and vimentin, as well as PLpro-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 (Figs 9C and 10A,B). STAT3 inhibitor (Stattic) also diminished PLpro-induced expression of Egr-1, vimentin, and Type I collagen (Fig. 10C). Therefore, results showed SARS-CoV PLpro up-regulating Egr-1 dependent TGF-\u03b21 mediated pro-fibrosis via ROS/p38 MAPK/STAT3 pathway.",

In addition, gene silencing by siRNA confirmed the importance of Egr-1 on TGF-\u03b21-mediated pro-fibrosis induced by PLpro (Fig. 6). Previous studies demonstrated Egr-1 exhibiting potent stimulatory action on fibrotic gene expression, and correlating with human fibrotic disorders like emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis, and systemic sclerosis2930. Those results revealed TGF-\u03b2 increasing Egr-1 protein and mRNA levels, stimulating Egr-1-depdent transcription of collagen, and then triggering Smad-independent fibrotic response. However, our study indicated SARS-CoV PLpro causing Egr-1-depdent transcription of TGF-\u03b21, in which was associated with TGF-\u03b21-mediated up-regulation of pro-fibrotic genes (such as vimentin, GFAP, and \u03b1-SMA). Of pro-protein convertases192021, Egr-1 dependent up-regulation of TSP-1 in PLpro-expressing cells was discovered (Figs 7B and 8B), in which TSP-1 was suggested as responsible for the proteolytic cleavage of latent TGF-\u03b21. The finding directed the alternative role of Egr-1 in TGF-\u03b21 induction and TSP-1-mediated latent TGF-\u03b21 activation in PLpro-expressing cells versus vector controls. Therefore, Egr-1 plays an important mediator in SARS CoV PLpro-induced pro-fibrotic response, appearing as a potential target for anti-fibrotic therapies in SARS patients.",

The unique pathway has been confirmed using specific inhibitors of ROS (YCG063), p38 MAPK (SB203580) and STAT3 (Stattic) (Figs 8, 9, 10), as in accord with our previous report in that SARS-CoV PLpro triggered TGF-\u03b21 production via p38 MAPK mediated signaling in human promonocytes13. In addition, ROS was associated with the up-regulation and activation of Egr-1 in hypoxia induced pulmonary fibrosis, hypertension, apoptosis, and atherosclerosis2631. The Egr-1 promoter consists of several functional response elements (such as serum response element (SRE), cAMP response element (CREs), APETALA1 (AP1), gene-specific activator protein 1 (Sp1), and Ets-family transcription factor binding sites)31. Several pathways of ROS-mediated Egr-1 up-regulation were identified, including MEK/ERK, c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), ERK-1/2-Elk-1 and NF-kappaB3132. The increase of ROS production generally activated MAPK pathways (ERKs, JNKs, or p38 MAPKs) in response to growth factors, cytokines, and various stresses33. In addition, the interaction between MAPK and STAT3 has been demonstrated in lipopolysaccharide-triggered inflammatory lung diseases34. Therefore, ROS/p38 MAPK/STAT3 was reasonably responsible for the Egr-1 upregulation of TGF-\u03b21-mediated pro-fibrotic response induced by SARS-CoV PLpro.",
