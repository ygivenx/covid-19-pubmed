Six suspected, 13 probable and 35 confirmed EVD cases had been reported, and 25 (52%) of 48 probable and confirmed EVD cases had died.[1]",

Delayed detection of EVD outbreaks and resulting widespread distributions of EVD have significantly contributed to epidemic growth.[7] In addition to traditional burial practices, Ebola treatment units with low quality care and/or high mortality rates have discouraged Ebola suspects from presenting to care and contribute to community-based transmission.[8\u201310] Fragile, overwhelmed public health surveillance systems have also contributed to higher rates of unreported cases, who endanger urban communities,[11] which potentially have had higher transmission rates than rural communities.[12] Change to subcritical transmission (reproduction number below 1) tends to occur when Ebola response organizations deploy control, prevention and care measures,[13,14] communities adopt more protective behaviors,[15,16] and/or transmission decreases in a social network.[17,18] Scientific advances with rapid diagnostics and vaccines from the West Africa outbreak were deployed in the April-July 2018 EVD outbreak in DRC and had the potential to limit Ebola virus transmission.[19\u201321]",

No exclusions were made; no attempt to model specific features of the April-July 2018 outbreak was conducted. The regression model predicted the outbreak size based on values of the outbreak size at a specific earlier time. The beginning of each outbreak was not reliably characterized; therefore, all time-series were aligned on the day they reached 10 cases. In the April-July 2018 outbreak, we observed cases over the period from April 4 to May 27 (day 0 to day 53). May 27 corresponded to day 34 since reaching 10 reported cases. For the prior 18 outbreaks, linear interpolation was used to obtain the number of cases on day 34 (after reaching 10 cases). To reduce the influence of outliers and high leverage points, and to improve linearity, we calculated the pseudologarithm transform f(x) = arcsinh(x/2), asymptotically logarithmic but well-behaved at 0. We used non-parametric Theil-Sen regression (R-package mblm) followed by calculation of the resulting prediction interval for a new observation.[46,47] Finally, we reported the median and 95% central coverage intervals for the prediction distribution conditional on the value being no smaller than the observed value on day 34.

The trends associated with suspected cases were subject to several factors, including operational choices of response teams and maturity of the outbreak. Nevertheless, suspected case counts may at times provide a better glimpse into the near future of an outbreak than the confirmed and probable case counts. In our case, use of the time series of confirmed, probable, and suspect cases yielded a forecast closer to the final outbreak size.

We included, however, as much real-time information into our estimates as possible, but situations such as the introduction of EVD into a large urban population and implementation of RDTs and vaccines are new to DRC. We did not include vaccination of healthcare workers in the stochastic model. Our estimates of vaccination effectiveness and reported cases were obtained from West Africa because these estimates were not available for the EVD outbreak in \u00c9quateur.

Indeed, our projections were consistent with this concern because models without vaccine coverage projected higher total outbreak sizes. In our stochastic model projections, vaccine use reduced mean total outbreak size by more than half, regardless of coverage levels (p<0.001, Welch\u2019s t-test). As vaccine coverage was scaled up, an influx of support was warranted to support and bolster the evolving rapid response; however, continued efforts to strengthen the health system are equally as warranted so that we can respond to future outbreaks before they become epidemics.
