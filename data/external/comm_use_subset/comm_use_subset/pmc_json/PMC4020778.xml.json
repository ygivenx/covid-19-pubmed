These data are largely used in bioinformatics, covering various areas such as computer science, mathematics and biological engineering several. Thus it is possible to optimize these studies, in a simple way [3]. The bioinformatic data can be used in phylogenetic analysis, as it is used in most branches of biology, such as phylogenetic trees for paralog genes [4], population analysis [5], evolution, epidemiology [6], [7], and genomic and metagenomic sequence comparison [8]. Protein phylogeny is used to indicate synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions along with the branches in order to identify cases of rapid changes of amino acids [9]. The analysis of different trees allows for the observation of topological incongruences, differences in the formation of taxa, and the relationship between nodes and trees [10], [11]. The complete phylogenetic inference at species level is presented in the Tree of Life (ToL) Web Project. ToL is a collaborative project of hundreds of phylogenetic researchers correlating diverse sources of information, including morphological, physiological, and molecular information. (This project is a work in progress [12]).",

            "text": "The presence of pathogens in the environment can interfere in the survival and reproduction of individuals in a population, leading to new evolutionary trends [13], [14]. Multicellular organisms have a rapid immune response to pathogens entering, named innate immunity. This response is performed by specialized cells, which have specific receptors for pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) [15], [16], the most noticeable are Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs) [17]. Tollip (Toll-interacting protein) participates in the signaling pathway of the TLR with an endogenous modulatory role. Tollip has a target N-terminal Myb1 (Tom1) binding domain (TBD), a conserved core domain 2 (C2) and a C-terminal portion of coupling ubiquitin to endoplasmic reticulum degradation (CUE). In resting cells, Tollip controls the activation pathway of Myeloid differentiation primary response gene (88) (MyD88)-dependent NF-kB in two different ways. First, Tollip associates with IL-1R, TLR4 after LPS activation, inhibiting the immune response mediated by TLR [18], [19]. This association requires TLR-TIR domain and intact C-terminal region of Tollip, CUE domain. Second, Tollip binds directly to interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 (IRAK-1) by inhibiting an autophosphorylation but without promoting its degradation. Overexpression of Tollip leads to inhibition of TLR2, TLR4, and IL-1R signaling, confirming a modulatory role of Tollip in immune responses [20]\u2013[23].",

In order to investigate the presence of positively selected codons, the estimation of both positive and purifying selection at each amino acid sites was calculated from the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions, \u03c9, as previously described [40]. Analyses were conducted using the Selecton version 2.1 software [41], [42]. The significance of scores was obtained by using a Likelihood Ratio Test that compares two nested models: a null model that assumes no selection (M8a) [43] and an alternative model that does (M8) [44].",

First, Tollip protein sequences previously aligned at Clustal W2 [45] were back-translated at BioEdit [46] package using standard genetic code, to normalize the codon frequencies and bring/make the comparisons more accurate. Once recombination eventually creates mosaic sequences in which evolutionary history at each site may be different. Then, GARD method [47] available in Datamonkey server [48] was also used to search for evidence of phylogenetic incongruences, and to identify the number and location of breakpoints corresponding to recombination events. In order to confirm GARD results, the recombination was assessed using a recombination cost \u2018\u2018delta dirac\u2019\u2019 and mutation cost \u2018\u2018Hamming\u2019\u2019, implemented in the Recco program [49]. The gap extension cost was fixed to 0.2 and the statistical significance of the analysis was obtained after 1000 permutations. Validation of the previously obtained results was performed with the six methods implemented in the RDP3 program [50]: RDP [51], GENECONV [52], BootScan [53], Maximum Chisquared Test [54], CHIMAERA [55] and Sister Scan [56]. The analysis was performed with default settings for the detection methods, a Bonferroni corrected P-value cut-off of 0.05, and a requirement that each potential event had to be detected simultaneously by four or more methods.",

But it is important to stress that the protein activity seems be intact or just slightly reduced, once its activity is essential to keep the health in animals. Tollip participates in several immune pathways, mediated or not by Myd88 [18], [19], modulating the responses and the loss or reduction of its affinity to molecular complexes made between it and several other compounds, like IRAK-1 [20]\u2013[23], could trigger an exaggerated response of the immune system, leading to death in some cases.

Higher molecular weights showed higher hydrophobicity by AI (p = \u22120.407; r = 0.007) and GRAVY results showed similar findings, being correlated with AI too (r = 0.671; p = 3.7\u00d710\u22126).

This ligand 768 is related with inhibition of calcium-dependent membrane binding activity of prothrombin and of factors Va, VIII and Xa of human coagulation pathway [67] by interaction with C2 domain. This interaction is consistent with Tollip modular criteria and its functions, revealing a potential need of Ca2+ to maintain the C2 domain structure and could be potentially inhibited by 768 ligand.",

In this sense, all primates present the residue K (Lys) at this position (except the ggo and ptr, which present R (Arg) and G (Gly), respectively), despite the common trend to present residue E (Glu) in other animals (55.56%). Residue D (Asp) in this position is important for insects (except for tsp and phu sequences, presenting E and Q (Gln) residues, respectively). This residue is under positive selection (position 166 at Selecton file, Figure 6). This mutation is apparently negative to health in primates and is a trait which was largely incorporated by other animals, reflecting a directional selection in this group, as occurs among insects.",

This study also shows an association between minor homozygote of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), named rs5743899, and a trend of reduced levels of Tollip mRNA in comparison with heterozygotes and major homozygotes, driving down the Tollip expression levels regulating cytokine response. Still, another SNP (rs3750920) was associated with increased levels of Tollip mRNA, providing protection to the organism against TB. The hypofunctional Tollip genotype has an association with increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines and increased risk of TB, as well as production of augmented proinflammatory cytokines. However, the assessed SNPs were related to synonymous variations or mutations in non-coding regions, and therefore, our data could not reveal any kind of correlation with that. Shah et al. [71] finds that tollip's effect in murine models are not applicable because tollip behaves differently in humans. There is a need for more research in this area.",

Primates generally have more unstable proteins, while arthropods have more stability at ININ, AI and GRAVY level. Size was not correlated with any groups and seems to be highly variable in all groups. In/del trends were saw as very frequent. The three dimensional structure analysis revealed the modular characteristic of this protein and the necessity of Ca2+ to keep the correct pocket of C2 domain. Ligand association studies revealed that 768 ligand probably could inhibit the Tollip activity. Positively selected residues were found in almost all domains, but a considerable part of them are relatively conserved, indicating a conservation of active pockets, which is consistent with maintaining protein right activity. The tested animal groups were differentially grouped, when studied with parsimonious and non-parsimonious residues, and revealed through molecular clock analysis that they present different selection and evolving speeds. The recombination supports diverse incongruences observed in the phylogenetic trees obtained with complete and cured Tollip data sets. There are no evidences that support a homogeneity in this immunologic pathway, once Tollip presented evolving trends that are not constant for all groups. Summarizing, some groups are highly evolutionary closed, as arthropods and primates, but when compared between them are totally non consistent.",
