Dromedary camels have been found to harbor the same MERS-CoV and MERS-CoV-like antibodies as humans and to shed the virus in high numbers in secretions from the upper respiratory tract [8]. Studies of archived secretion samples obtained from camels in Dubai in 2005 revealed neutralizing antibodies to MERS-CoV, indicating that the virus is not new to the Arabian Peninsula. These findings also suggest that MERS-CoV is widespread and has previously infected various camel populations, including some in countries where human cases have yet to be reported [9]. Camels are currently recognized as the main animal reservoir, with primary cases occurring in areas where they are an important part of life. Unpasteurized camel milk may be a route of transmission, but so far there are no data that MERS-CoV is excreted into camel milk [10].",

In June 2012, a 60-year-old man presented in Saudi Arabia with acute pneumonia and subsequent renal failure, which eventually led to his death. A previously unknown coronavirus was detected in his sputum and provisionally called human coronavirus Erasmus Medical Center (hCoV-EMC) [1]. Shortly thereafter, in September 2012, the same virus was detected in a patient with severe respiratory illness who had been transferred from the Middle East to the United Kingdom. Combining with retrospective analysis of stored samples from the aforementioned outbreak in Jordan, the novel virus, renamed MERS-CoV, was recognized as the cause of a new severe respiratory disease [12].",

The WHO guidelines apply a relatively sensitive definition of suspected cases and emphasize the importance of a high index of clinical suspicion for diagnosis owing to the high mortality rate. Some countries, especially those in endemic regions, have developed their own preparedness and response plans which are based on WHO and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\u2019s recommendations. The Oman\u2019s Ministry of Health implemented a national plan which was based on strengthening five pillars of action, including: (1) public health surveillance and contact management. Field visits were conducted to every confirmed case by the national public health services and exposed individuals were monitored for 14 days after the last exposure; (2) building laboratory capacity, including diagnostic capacity with primers for MERS-CoV testing, and training laboratory personnel on triple-packing and shipment of samples. Furthermore, training to first responders and intensivists on how to collect nasopharyngeal samples; (3) infection prevention and control, including mask-fit testing for all healthcare workers who could be involved in patient care; (4) case management; and (5) risk communication [26]. The government of the Republic of Korea summoned a Rapid Response Team following the outbreak in their country. The team was composed of infectious disease specialists and infection control professionals, and they established national guidelines for the diagnosis and management of MERS-CoV infection. Together with the epidemiology investigation team of the local government, control strategies were discussed, which included: (1) contact tracing; (2) surveillance of polymerase chain reaction testing of healthcare workers and patients according to their level of contact; (3) preemptive isolation of pneumonia cases; (4) environmental disinfection; and (5) cleaning and enforcing the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) among healthcare providers [27]. The possibility of MERS-CoV occurring in Israel is high given Israel\u2019s geographic location in the Middle East and the thousands of Israeli Moslems who make the pilgrimage to Mecca (the Hajj) each year. Therefore, the Israel Ministry of Health (IMOH) has drafted preparedness guidelines that generally follow the CDC guidelines, although the CDC did not include Israel among the countries at risk. These guidelines recommend laboratory evaluation for all healthcare workers with a severe acute respiratory illness of unknown etiology, and in cases of clusters of severe respiratory symptoms of known etiology. In addition, the approval of the public health services is required before any case may be designated a suspected MERS-CoV infection, thereby ensuring early involvement on a national level in every instance of the disease. Information regarding MERS-CoV was disseminated by the distribution of leaflets and placement of informative posters at Ben-Gurion International Airport and three land-border crossings between Israel and Jordan [28].",

Laboratory diagnosis is based on the detection of the virus in upper respiratory and lower respiratory samples by using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. This detection is performed by targeting upstream regions of the E gene (upE) or within open reading frame (ORF)1b, using upE for screening and ORF1b for confirmation. Another real-time RT-PCR assay targeting the MERS-CoV nucleocapsid protein gene has been developed and can be used for screening and confirmation. When there are discordant results between two real-time RT-PCR assays, the sequencing of an amplicon generated from an appropriate RT-PCR assay should be performed to confirm test results. Lower respiratory tract specimens have been found to be more sensitive than upper respiratory tract specimens for the detection of MERS-CoV. In addition, the development of a rapid diagnostic kit is important for the timely diagnosis of suspected MERS-CoV cases. Serological testing can be used to screen the contacts of infected patients and to retrospectively confirm MERS-CoV infections [30]. Virus isolation in cell culture is not recommended at this time since it requires laboratory working under high biosafety level [29].",

There is no consensus regarding precautionary recommendations for MERS-CoV; whereas the WHO recommends the contact and droplet precautions for all suspected cases and airborne precautions only for aerosol-generating procedures [31], the CDC advocates the use of airborne and contact precautions for all patient care activities [32]. Several countries have taken the hard line of the CDC guidelines and recommend that direct healthcare workers should place all patients with a suspected infection in an isolated negative-pressure room and take adequate precautions by wearing two pairs of gloves, a disposable gown, and a face shield, and donning an N-95 respirator [28, 33, 34]. Currently, all suspected and confirmed cases should be treated in hospitals regardless of their medical condition, however transportation of patients to hospital requires additional emphasis, taking into account the small space of the vehicle and the close contact with the patient. The few guiding principles are that patients should be transported on a dedicated mission with the minimum number of crew members and should wear a surgical mask, if tolerated. The direct healthcare providers should wear the aforementioned PPE against contact and airborne transmission and avoid cough- or aerosol-generating procedures unless necessary. In addition, all transportations of patients should be coordinated with public health services [35].",

            "text": "The recent MERS-CoV epidemic and the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003 emphasized that new emerging diseases can occur at any time and in any place without prior notice. MERS-CoV shares certain similarities with SARS-CoV: both are zoonotic viruses which belong to the genus Betacoronavirus and can cause an acute respiratory illness which may be fatal. Although MERS-CoV has a higher case-fatality rate than SARS-CoV (36 vs. 10 %), both viruses are highly pathogenic and can apparently be transmitted through all routes of exposure. Moreover, currently, there are no effective vaccines or antiviral treatments for these diseases [36]. Failure to contain the outbreak in its first stages can have devastating effects, emphasizing the importance of a national preparedness plan for unusual biological events (UBEs). There are some key elements to improve the readiness for UBEs such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. (1) Containment abilities Implementation of quarantine measures to isolate healthy people who have been in contact with infected people and designated hospitals for receiving sick patients. (2) Infection control Given the unknown route of transmission, PPE against contact, droplet and airborne transmissions should be allocated to first responders. (3) Epidemic management team The need for a multidisciplinary team to advise the Ministry of Health regarding modes of action has been shown to be essential in the last outbreaks. Nevertheless, this consulting team should have routine training sessions in order to be ready during outbreaks. (4) Epidemiologic investigation team An early epidemiologic investigation is vital for containment of an outbreak and it allows early intervention that could prevent morbidity and mortality. Skilled teams with advanced epidemiologic investigation tools can detect earlier the index case and take prompt countermeasures. (5) Table-top and \u201creal-life\u201d exercises Exercises should be undertaken for testing contingency plans and coordination between organizations. The Israeli Orange Flame preparedness build-up project, in which medical and nonmedical staff are trained at three levels: tactical, operational and strategic, is a good example for a comprehensive drill that is aimed at improving national readiness and preparedness for emerging diseases [37].",
