Despite this, data from tropical settings, in which the epidemiology of influenza and other respiratory infections differs substantially from temperate settings, are limited. Increased understanding of the etiology of respiratory infections in these settings is important to identify opportunities for disease control in high-risk military populations and to identify risks of pathogen emergence with potential for spread into the wider community.",

The URI and ILI rates in our study are nonetheless comparable with those reported by other studies in the United States.16\u201318 Despite this, we found low rates of clinical influenza A in this minimally vaccinated population. Possible reasons for this could be exposure to circulating influenza strains before recruits entering the training camps. Thai national influenza surveillance data indicate high influenza activity in the first half of 2014, with influenza A/H1N1 and influenza B predominating.19 Concomitantly, our data indicated that 55% of recruits with available serological information had baseline influenza A/H1N1 titers \u2265 1:40. Titers greater than this value have been shown to be associated with a 50% reduction in risk of clinical influenza from homologous strains, for both influenza A and B viruses.20\u201323 Of interest, 86% of recruits also had baseline titers against influenza B/Massachusetts greater than this level. The higher baseline titers against influenza B/Massachusetts are consistent with the frequent detection of influenza B isolates from the Yamagata lineage in clinical specimens from Thailand in the first half of 2014.19",

Although we did not specifically study transmission chains or epidemiologic links between cases of illness, in the context of our study, recruits did not leave the camps during the 10-week training periods, such that the occurrence of respiratory pathogens is most likely to have resulted from transmission within the camps rather than from external sources. Intense transmission of bacterial species was apparent, as the risks of acquiring H. influenzae non\u2013type B and S. pneumoniae among initially non-colonized individuals were 70% and 31%, respectively. Bacterial species were also commonly found in samples from URI cases. The colonizing nature of these bacterial species makes it difficult to determine the clinical relevance of these detections. However, H. influenzae type B and non\u2013type B were identified in 13% and 9% of clinical samples in the absence of any other pathogens, suggesting that these pathogens could be responsible for illness in a fraction of adult URI cases. Interestingly, H. influenzae type B has not been previously associated with a significant burden of URI in adults.24 It is possible, however, that these cases were caused by other pathogens not included in the multiplex assay.",
