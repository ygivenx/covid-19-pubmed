Viruses are sensed by a subset of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognize evolutionarily conserved structures known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Classically, viral nucleic acids are the predominant PAMPs detected by these receptors during infection. These sensing steps contribute to the activation of signaling cascades that culminate in the early production of antiviral effector molecules, cytokines and chemokines responsible for the inhibition of viral replication and the induction of adaptive immune responses [2], [5]\u2013[7]. In addition to the nucleic acid sensing by a subset of endosome-associated Toll-like receptors (TLR), viral RNA structures within the cytoplasm are recognized by members of the retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) family, including the three DExD/H box RNA helicases RIG-I, Mda5 and LGP-2 [2], [3], [5], [8]\u2013[12].",

            "text": "RIG-I is a cytosolic multidomain protein that detects viral RNA through its helicase domain [13], [14]. In addition to its RNA sensing domain, RIG-I also possesses an effector caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) that interacts with the mitochondrial adaptor MAVS, also known as VISA, IPS-1, Cardif [15], [16]. Viral RNA binding alters RIG-I conformation from an auto-inhibitory state to an open conformation exposing the CARD domain, resulting in the generation of an activated state characterized by ATP hydrolysis and ATP-driven translocation on RNA [17]\u2013[19]. Activation of RIG-I also allows ubiquitination and/or binding to polyubiquitin. In recent studies, polyubiquitin binding has been shown to induce formation of RIG-I tetramers that activate downstream signaling by inducing the formation of prion-like fibrils composed of the MAVS adaptor [20]. MAVS then triggers the activation of IRF3 and NF-\u03baB transcription proteins through the IKK-related serine kinases TBK1 and IKK\u03b5 [10], [21]\u2013[23], leading to the primary activation of the antiviral program, involving production of type I interferons (IFN\u03b2 and IFN\u03b1), as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines and antiviral factors [5], [24], [25]. A secondary response involving the induction of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) is induced by the binding of IFN to its cognate receptor (IFN\u03b1/\u03b2R), which triggers the JAK-STAT pathway to amplify the antiviral immune response [6], [26]\u2013[29].",

In vitro synthesized RNA carrying an exposed 5\u2032 terminal triphosphate (5\u2032ppp) moiety was first identified as RIG-I agonists [30]\u2013[32]. The 5\u2032ppp moiety is present at the end of viral and self RNA molecules generated by RNA polymerization; however, in eukaryotic cells, RNA processing in the nucleus cleaves the 5\u2032ppp end and the RNA is capped prior to release into the cytoplasm. This mechanism distinguishes viral \u2018non-self\u2019 5\u2032pppRNA from cellular \u2018self\u2019 RNA, and renders it recognizable to the innate RIG-I sensor [30], [31], [33]. Further characterization of the RNA structure demonstrated that blunt base pairing at the 5\u2032 end of the RNA, with a minimum double strand (ds) length of 20 nucleotides was also important for RIG-I signaling [17], [33], [34]. Furthermore, short dsRNA (<300 bp) triggered RIG-I, whereas long dsRNA (>2000 bp) such as poly I:C and lacking 5\u2032ppp failed to trigger RIG-I, but was recognized by Mda5 [35].",

A short in vitro-synthesized 5\u2032pppRNA derived from the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs of the VSV genome activated the RIG-I signaling pathway and triggered a robust antiviral response that interfered with infection by several pathogenic viruses, including Dengue, HCV, H1N1 Influenza A/PR/8/34 and HIV-1. Furthermore, intravenous delivery of the RNA agonist stimulated an antiviral state in vivo that protected mice from lethal influenza virus challenge. This report highlights the therapeutic potential of naturally derived RIG-I agonists as potent stimulators of the innate antiviral response, with the capacity to mobilize genes essential for the generation of efficient immunity against multiple infections.",

IRF3 homodimerization (1st panel) and IRF3 phosphorylation at Ser396 (2nd panel) were detected as early as 2 h post treatment with 5\u2032pppRNA, and sustained until 24 h.

I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation was likewise detected as early as 2 h post-treatment and was sustained in A549 cells (6th panel). Altogether, IRF3, IRF7 and NF-\u03baB are required for optimal induction of the IFN\u03b2 promoter [27]. JAK-STAT signaling was detected at 4 h with Tyr701 phosphorylation of STAT1 (9th panel), as well as later accumulation at 24 h (10th panel). IFIT1 and RIG-I itself, were up-regulated 4 h post-treatment (11th and 12th panel) whereas a second group of ISGs (STAT1 and IRF7; 4th and 10th panel) was induced between 6 h and 8 h after agonist treatment.

IFN\u03b1 release was detected later at 12 h, and remained high thereafter (400 pg/ml) (Figure 1D).

As positive control, a constitutively active, CARD domain-containing RIG-I mutant [41] was used to bypass the requirement for RIG-I (Figure 2A).

Figure 3A shows a waterfall plot of differentially expressed genes (DEG; selected based on fold change \u2265\u00b12, p-value \u22640.001) after 5\u2032pppRNA stimulation. The number of genes up-regulated by 5\u2032pppRNA administration steadily increased with time, while the majority of down-regulation occurred at 24\u201348 h (Fig. 3A). The heatmap presents DEG with emphasis on the most highly deregulated genes over time (Fig. 3B). Canonical pathway analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software identified IFN signaling, activation of IRFs by cytosolic PRRs, TNFR2 signaling and antigen presentation as the main up-regulated functional categories, while functions related to cell metabolism and cell cycle were down-regulated by RIG-I agonist treatment (Fig. 3C). Subsequent kinetic analysis revealed that RIG-I agonist induced distinct temporal patterns of gene expression (Fig. 3D, S1 and S2A). For example, some genes were highly expressed early at 6\u201312 h, including IFNB1 and the IFN\u03bb family (IL29, IL-28A, IL28B), but the expression of these genes was not sustained throughout the time course and decreased at 24\u201348 h (Fig. 3D; lest panel). A second subset of genes associated with the antiviral response were induced early at 6\u20138 h, but expression was sustained and markedly augmented at 24\u201348 h, as exemplified by IFI family members, IRF7, and other ISGs (Fig. 3D; middle panel). A third subset of genes was induced primarily at later time points, as part of the secondary response to 5\u2032pppRNA treatment, and included HLA and CCL3 families (Fig. 3D; right panel). Representative genes from different subsets were validated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (Fig. S1). Overall, 5\u2032pppRNA induced a robust bi-phasic transcriptional response, characterized by strong activation of antiviral and inflammatory gene signatures; the kinetics of the transcriptional profile mirrored the biochemical activation events detected in Figures 1.",

As expected, at 6 h (Fig. 4A), induction of antiviral and inflammatory response programs downstream of IRF, NF-\u03baB, STAT signaling were identified (Fig. 4A and S2B); expression of several cytokine and chemokine genes were also up-regulated. Concomitantly, genes related to Fos and TGF-\u03b2 signaling, as well as hypoxic signaling via HIF-1\u03b1 were down-regulated. At 24 h (Fig. 4B), genes associated with pathogen recognition receptor signaling, the ubiquitin pathway, inflammation and apoptosis were also induced by RIG-I activation; interestingly, profiling of down-regulated genes identified functional clusters involved in cell cycle regulation, MYC signaling, and the heat shock response.",

To define gene uniquely induced by 5\u2032pppRNA, gene expression profiles of A549 cells stimulated with 5\u2032pppRNA or with IFN\u03b1-2b for 6 and 24 h were compared. The heatmap in Figure 5A displays the expression profile of genes differentially up- and down-regulated (fold change \u22652; p-value \u22640.001) by 5\u2032pppRNA and IFN (black and blue genes) or exclusively by 5\u2032pppRNA (red and green genes). Interestingly, 5\u2032pppRNA induced a significantly broader gene expression program compared to IFN\u03b1-2b, especially at 24 h. To determine whether differences in gene expression observed between 5\u2032pppRNA and IFN\u03b1-2b were due to sub-optimal stimulation by IFN\u03b1-2b, higher concentrations of IFN\u03b1-2b within the range reported for in vitro applications were tested. Treatment with 5\u2032pppRNA at 10 ng/ml was equivalent to treatment with IFN\u03b1-2b at 100 IU/ml in terms of IFN\u03b1 levels released into cell culture supernatant. Increasing the concentration of IFN\u03b1-2b to 1000 IU/ml corresponded to levels of IFN\u03b1 that were 8-times greater than physiological secretion following 10 ng/ml 5\u2032pppRNA treatment (2500 pg/ml vs 480 pg/ml; Fig. 5B). Regardless of the amount of IFN\u03b1-2b used to activate cells, gene expression levels remained relatively unchanged (Fig. 5A; IFN\u03b1-2b 100 IU/ml vs 1000 IU/ml), indicating that IFN\u03b1-2b treatment was saturating.",

Some of the genes characteristically activated as part of the IFN signature and maximally induced by 5\u2032pppRNA are MX1, IFIT1, ISG15 (Fig. 5A, black portion). This comparison also highlighted the fact that a surprisingly large number of genes are uniquely regulated by 5\u2032pppRNA - 38 genes at 6 h and 730 genes at 24 h (Fig. 5C). Most notably, IFNB1 and all three members of the IFN\u03bb family, as well as the cytokines CCL5, CXCL10, IL-6, and CCL3, were highly induced by 5\u2032pppRNA but not IFN\u03b1-2b treatment (Fig. 5A; red genes). While IFN signaling was highly induced by both treatments, IFN\u03b1-2b strongly activated antigen presentation machinery, and 5\u2032pppRNA preferentially stimulated dendritic cell maturation and crosstalk, linking innate and adaptive immunity as well as induction of a wider range of signaling pathways (Fig. 5D). Significantly, 5\u2032pppRNA preferentially stimulated a more extensive induction of IRF7 and NF-\u03baB signaling nodes compared to IFN\u03b1-2b treatment (Fig. S2C). Thus, 5\u2032pppRNA treatment, besides inducing a complete IFN response, additionally stimulated the transcription of a large and unique set of inflammatory and antiviral genes.",

All viruses established infection in untreated cells as assessed by flow cytometry (60%, 20% and 80%, respectively) but in 5\u2032pppRNA-treated cells, VSV and DENV infectivity was reduced to <0.5%, while infection with vaccinia was reduced to 10% (Fig. 6A). Release of infectious VSV and DENV virus was completely blocked by 5\u2032pppRNA treatment (1.7\u00d7109 and 4.3\u00d7106 PFU/mL in untreated cells, respectively vs. undetectable in treated cells; Fig. S3). Similarly, in primary human CD14+ monocytes, DENV infection decreased from 53.7% to 2.6% in the presence of 5\u2032pppRNA; in the CD14\u2212 fraction, DENV infectivity was lower (3%), but was likewise inhibited by RNA agonist treatment (0.4%; Fig. 6B). To demonstrate the requirement for intracellular delivery of 5\u2032pppRNA, primary CD14+ cells from three patients were treated with 5\u2032pppRNA alone, transfection reagent alone or the combination; DENV infectivity was reduced from \u223c30% to \u223c0.5% only upon transfection of the RNA agonist (Fig. 6C). To evaluate the antiviral effect of 5\u2032pppRNA against HIV infection, activated CD4+ T cells were pre-treated with supernatant isolated from 5\u2032pppRNA-treated monocytes and then infected with HIV-GFP. In the absence of treatment, 24% of the activated CD4+ T cells were actively infected by HIV as determined by GFP expression by flow cytometry, whereas infection of CD4+ T cells treated with 5\u2032pppRNA supernatants was reduced to 11% (Fig. 6D). 5\u2032pppRNA also had an antiviral effect against HCV in hepatocellular carcinoma cell line Huh7; HCV NS3 expression was inhibited by 5\u2032pppRNA treatment (Fig. 6E; lane 4 vs. 2 and 6). The antiviral effect was fully dependent on RIG-I, as demonstrated in Huh7.5 cells (that express a mutated inactive RIG-I) by the absence of IFIT1 up-regulation following 5\u2032pppRNA treatment (Fig. 6E; lane 9) and NS3 expression comparable to untreated HCV-infected cells (Fig. 6E; lane 10 vs. 8 and 12). Thus, 5\u2032pppRNA is a broad-spectrum antiviral agent able to trigger an efficient innate immune response in different cell types and prevent infection by RNA and DNA viruses.",

Next, to determine whether the RIG-I \u2018unique\u2019 gene expression profile characterized in Figure 5 could compensate for the IFN response, A549 cells were knocked down for the IFN\u03b1/\u03b2R; the knock down was efficient, as demonstrated by the absence of IFIT1 and RIG-I induction following IFN\u03b1-2b stimulation (Fig. 7F; lane 6). Interestingly, induction of ISGs was only partially reduced following 5\u2032pppRNA treatment (2.2-fold reduction of IFIT1 vs. siCtrl; Fig. 7F; lane 5 vs. 2); this IFN-independent activation of innate signaling was sufficient to reduce viral NS1 expression by 2.4-fold (Fig. 7E; lane 9 vs. 8).

Whereas all untreated, infected mice succumbed to infection by day 11, all 5\u2032pppRNA-treated mice fully recovered (100% survival) (Fig. 8A). Overall, weight loss was similar between the two groups (Fig. 8B), although a noticeable delay of 2\u20133 days in the onset of weight loss was observed in 5\u2032pppRNA-treated animals; treated mice then fully recovered within 12\u201314 days (Fig. 8B). Influenza replication in the lungs was monitored by plaque assay over the course of infection with virus titers in the lungs of untreated mice reaching a maximum at day 3 post-infection (Fig. 8C). A decrease in virus titer was noted by day 9 post-infection, possibly correlating with the onset of adaptive immunity, and all animals succumbed to influenza infection by day 11 (Fig. 8A). Interestingly, 5\u2032pppRNA treatment inhibited influenza virus replication in the lungs early after infection, within the first 24\u201348 h (Fig. 8C; Day 1); by day 3, virus titers in the lung had increased, although influenza titers were still \u223c10-fold lower compared to titers in untreated mice (Fig. 8C; Day 3). By day 9, the 5\u2032pppRNA-treated animals had controlled the infection, as demonstrated by the decrease in viral titers. Continuous administration of 5\u2032pppRNA at 24 h intervals post-infection had an additive therapeutic effect that further delayed viral replication (Fig. 8D; 3 versus 2 doses of 5\u2032pppRNA), indicating that antiviral immunity may be sustained with repetitive administration of 5\u2032pppRNA. Furthermore, therapeutic administration of 5\u2032pppRNA also controlled influenza viral replication; although prophylactic treatment was most effective at blocking influenza dissemination in the lung, administration of the RNA agonist on day 1 and day 2 after influenza infection also reduced viral lung titers by \u223c10-fold (Fig. 8E).",

Influenza virus infection induced severe and extensive inflammation and oedema in the perivascular space and the bronchial lumen at day 3 post-infection. In animals receiving the RNA agonist, influenza triggered a mild and infrequent inflammation that did not extend to the bronchial lumen at day 3 post-infection. Epithelial degeneration and loss of tissue integrity were more severe in the lungs of untreated, infected animals and correlated with epithelial hyperplasia observed at later times, compared to the lungs of animals treated with 5\u2032pppRNA. Inflammation and epithelial damage progressed in untreated mice by day 8 (Fig. 9E), and correlated with increased virus titer in the lungs (Fig. 8C); inflammation and epithelial damage was consistently less apparent in agonist-treated mice. Strikingly, the surface area of the lungs affected by pneumonia was significantly reduced in 5\u2032pppRNA-treated mice compared to non-treated mice \u2013 on day 3, 16% vs 35%; day 8, 41% vs 73% (Fig. 9C; bottom panel).

Intravenous administration of the 5\u2032pppRNA agonist in mice stimulated an antiviral state in vivo that protected animals from lethal influenza virus challenge and controlled influenza virus-mediated pneumonia. Analysis of the dynamics of the host transcriptome following 5\u2032pppRNA stimulation was characterized by antiviral and inflammation related gene expression patterns with transcriptional nodes of genes regulated by IRF, NF-\u03baB, and STAT families. Virtually all of the genes activated by IFN\u03b1-2b were encompassed within the 5\u2032pppRNA transcriptome; bioinformatics analysis also identified distinct gene patterns and functional processes that were uniquely induced or inhibited by 5\u2032pppRNA.

Among the ISGs, the tripartite motif containing (TRIM) proteins, the IFITM proteins, MX1 and viperin exemplify the range of ISGs induced by RIG-I and all have been implicated as inhibitors of HIV-1, Influenza, VSV, West Nile, Dengue, and HCV [43]\u2013[53]. In a recent study, high throughput screening of antiviral effectors identified a panel of broadly acting antiviral molecules, with the combined expression of multiple ISGs providing additive inhibitory effects against HCV replication [29].

Bioinformatics analysis identified a unique functional signature with up-regulated genes involved in inducing a wider range of signaling pathways and bridging innate and adaptive immune responses. The importance of genes uniquely induced by 5\u2032pppRNA is highlighted by the antiviral response that limited influenza infection in vitro and in vivo, even in the absence of functional type I IFN signaling. We speculate that the extended range of genes induced by 5\u2032pppRNA, compared to IFN\u03b1-2b, reflect the activation of multiple signaling pathways downstream of RIG-I/MAVS [10], versus the more-limited transactivation potential of the IFN-regulated JAK-STAT axis [26].",

IFN\u03bbs have been increasingly implicated in antiviral therapies: 1) IFN\u03bb administration in mice stimulated expression of Mx1 and protected IFN\u03b1R\u2212/\u2212 mice from lethal influenza challenge [55]; 2) IL29 blocked HIV-1 replication by inhibiting virus integration and post-transcriptional events [56]; and 3) the combination of IL29 and IFN\u03b1 or IL29 and IFN\u03b3 enhanced the induction of antiviral genes and effectively inhibited HCV and VSV replication [57]. In addition, polymorphism in or near IFN\u03bb3 gene correlated with spontaneous or treatment-induced clearance of Hepatitis C infection and IFN\u03bb therapy is now actively investigated for the treatment of HCV [58].

The rapid control of virus replication, as demonstrated by significantly reduced virus titers in the lungs within 3 days of virus inoculation, may have prevented excessive immune cell recruitment early after infection. Influenza infection generates a complex pathogenesis mediated in part by viral- and immune-mediated damage [63]; therefore, the activation and recruitment of limited numbers of specific immune cell types, such as neutrophils, alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells may generate a beneficial antiviral microenvironment that additionally favor the initiation of adaptive immune response, which would eventually contribute to the in vivo efficacy of the agonist.",

Recently, a short RNA molecule with dual functionality was developed - a siRNA against influenza NP gene and an agonist of the RIG-I pathway [66]. This 5\u2032pppRNA inhibited influenza infection in vitro and in vivo, but the contribution of RIG-I activation to the inhibition of influenza was not demonstrated. The defective interfering RNA produced during Sendai virus life cycle is the best characterized natural RIG-I ligand and is known to induce strong inflammatory response [67]. Interestingly, this molecule has adjuvant potential and could stimulate an antibody-dependent response directed to influenza antigens.

Interferon therapy has been used in the clinic for over two decades and has proven effective in the treatment of certain viral infections, mainly Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C [58], as well as malignancies and autoimmune diseases [68], [69]. However, IFN therapy is also associated with significant side effects that limit its use [70]. PolyI:C, another dsRNA immune modulator, is also being tested in vitro and in vivo and has demonstrated efficacy against respiratory infections [71]\u2013[73]. Along with antiviral drugs, vaccination is the primary approach to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with viral infection. Increasing the immunogenicity of vaccines with molecular adjuvants eliciting cytokines, co-stimulatory molecules, or immunomodulatory factors enhance the vaccine-elicited immune responses. 5\u2032pppRNA has the advantage of mimicking viral recognition to trigger an immune response analogous to natural viral infection. Furthermore, the response stimulated by 5\u2032pppRNA was reminiscent of the integrated and multipotent response elicited early following immunization by the most protective vaccine identified so far, the yellow fever YD17 vaccine [74]. Therefore, an immune modulator such as a RIG-I agonist may not only function as an antiviral therapeutic, but may also serve as a vaccine adjuvant to increase the magnitude of the antiviral immune response elicited by vaccine epitopes. Thus, the present study not only demonstrated the prophylactic and therapeutic antiviral potential of 5\u2032pppRNA, but also opens the door to further investigation of the potential of RIG-I agonists as vaccine adjuvants.",

For luciferase assays, transfections were performed in wt and RIG-I\u2212/\u2212; wt and Mda5\u2212/\u2212, TLR3\u2212/\u2212, TLR7\u2212/\u2212 MEFs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, New York, USA) or jetPRIME (PolyPlus, France), respectively. Plasmids encoding GFP-\u0394RIG-I, IRF-7, pRLTK, IFN\u03b14/pGL3 and IFN\u03b2/pGL3 were previously described [78]. MEFs were co-transfected with 200 ng pRLTK reporter (Renilla luciferase for internal control), 200 ng of reporter gene constructs, together with 5\u2032pppRNA (500 ng/ml) or 100 ng of a plasmid encoding a constitutively active form of RIG-I (\u0394RIG-I) [41]. IRF7 plasmid (100 ng) was added for transactivation of IFN\u03b14 promoter. At 24 h after transfection, reporter gene activity was measured by Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay, according to manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Wisconsin, USA). Relative luciferase activity was measured as fold induction (relative to the basal level of reporter gene). For siRNA knock down, A549 cells were transfected with 50 nM (30 pmol) of human RIG-I (sc-61480), IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2R \u03b1 (sc-35637) and \u03b2 (sc-40091) chain, or control siRNA (sc-37007) (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Dallas, USA) using Lipofectamine RNAi Max (Invitrogen, NY, USA) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Treatment with 5\u2032pppRNA was performed 48 hrs later.",

IFN\u03b1-2b (Intron A) was purchased from Schering Plough (Kenilworth, NJ). Cells were collected and lysed for RNA extraction (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Reverse transcription reactions were performed to obtain cDNAs which were hybridized to the Illumina Human HT-12 version 4 Expression BeadChip according to the manufacturer's instruction, and quantified using an Illumina iScan System. The data were collected with Illumina GenomeStudio software. First, arrays displaying unusually low median intensity, low variability, or low correlation relative to the bulk of the arrays were discarded from the rest of the analysis. Quantile normalization, followed by a log2 transformation using the Bioconductor package LIMMA was applied to process microarrays. To account for variability between batches, the data were adjusted using the ComBat procedure (http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxj037). Missing values were imputed with the R package (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/impute/index.html). In order to identify differentially expressed genes between treated and controls (untreated) samples, the LIMMA package [86] from Bioconductor was used. For data mining and functional analyses, genes that satisfied a p-value (<0.001) with \u22652 fold change (up or down) were selected. Probes that do not map to annotated RefSeq genes and control probes were removed. The expected proportions of false positives (FDR) were estimated from the unadjusted p-value using the Benjamini and Hochberg method [87]. All network analysis was done with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA: Ingenuity systems, Redwood City, CA). The differentially expressed genes selected based on above criteria were mapped to the ingenuity pathway knowledge base with different colors (red: up-regulated; green: down-regulated). The significance of the association between the dataset and the canonical pathway was measured in two ways: (1) A ratio of the number of genes from the dataset that map to the pathway divided by the total number of genes that map to the canonical pathway was displayed; (2) by over-representation analysis Fisher's exact test was used to calculate a p-value determining the probability that the association between the genes in the dataset and the canonical pathway is explained by chance alone. The pathways were ranked with \u2212log p-values. Microarray data have been deposited in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus.",
