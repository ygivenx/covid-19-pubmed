The infection can eventually lead to hepatocellular carcinoma, liver failure, or cirrhosis, and causes ~ 1 million deaths every year [1]. Treatments for chronic HBV typically involve the life-long administration of approved drugs (e.g., nucleotides and interferon-\u03b1 therapies) that are costly and require patient compliance. Long-term interferon therapy can induce many adverse effects [2]; therefore, interruption to treatment results in unavoidable viral rebound. Less than 10% of patients achieve functional cure, defined as anti-HBs seroconversion [3, 4]. There is thus an urgent need for new treatments that can effectively control the HBV epidemic and eventually eradicate chronic HBV infection.",

Licensed antivirals target HBV reverse transcriptase activity but they fail to eliminate cccDNA. HBV cccDNA elimination is currently only achieved by antiviral immune responses [5]; however, HBV-specific T cells are scarce and are functionally impaired in the context of chronic HBV infection most likely due to high amounts of circulating viral HBeAg and HBsAg [6]. A therapeutic vaccine that is combined with antivirals might restore a functional T-cell response and achieve anti-hepatitis B seroconversion while minimizing the risk of adverse effects. Numerous therapeutic vaccination strategies have been developed over the past 20 years and some have even entered clinical trials. Unfortunately, all these clinical trials have showed disappointing results [7, 8]. More sophisticated approaches are warranted to break immune tolerance and boost functional HBV-specific immune responses in individuals with a chronic infection.",

The ability of TLRs to trigger the innate immune system and boost adaptive immunity is well established [10, 11]. One HBV therapeutic vaccine in clinical trial consisting of HBV antigen-antibody (HBsAg-HBIG) complex with Alum can activate TLR3 on immune cells to induce protective HBV-specific immune response [8]. In addition, a TLR9 agonist CpG has been used as an adjuvant to improve the immune control of persistent HBV infection [12]. A TLR7 agonist has also been reported to induce an innate cytokine response that suppresses HBV replication and to shape the adaptive immune response to achieve durable control of HBV infection [13]. Uniquely designed TLR7 agonists showed adjuvant potential in SIV-infected rhesus monkeys treated with an ad26/MVA therapeutic vaccine and in a prophylactic vaccine against staphylococcus aureus [14, 15].",

To compare TLR signaling stimulation upon T7-EA and T7 treatment, we analyzed all the known genes involved in TLR signaling (identified from PathCards; https://pathcards.genecards.org) in our RNA-seq dataset. We found similar TLR gene expression patterns between T7-EA and T7 treatments in Raw 264.7 cells: only six genes were differentially expressed with an absolute fold-change > 2. These six genes, Stat1, Ifnb1, Irf7, Cxcl10, Ccl5 and Mapk13 (Fig. 2b, Additional file 2: Table S2), were previously reported as interferon stimulation genes (ISGs) [24]. Further analysis showed that more ISGs not involved in TLR signaling were downregulated by T7-EA compared to T7 (Additional file 3: Fig. S1, Additional file 4: Table S3). These results suggest that while T7-EA has a similar biological function as unmodified T7 in terms of stimulating TLR signaling genes, T7-EA and T7 have differential effects on inducing ISGs in Raw 264.7 cells.",

We found that T7-EA induced more potent SEAP reaction than T7 in HEK-Blue hTLR7 reporter cells, but no activity was observed in inducing SEAP reaction in HEK-Blue hTLR8 reporter cells, suggesting that T7-EA is a specific TLR7 agonist that is more potent than T7 (Fig. 3a, b).

We treated PBMCs from 3 healthy donors with T7-EA and T7 at different concentrations for 18 h, and determined the levels of IFN-\u03b1 and IL-6 in the supernatants. Here, we found that T7-EA showed differential capacity to induce IFN-\u03b1 and IL-6 expression than T7.

We administered T7-EA intraperitoneally in a formulation with an Alum adjuvant and a recombinant HBsAg protein in normal Balb/c mice on day 0, 14 and 28, T7 and a TLR7/8 agonist R848 were used as controls. We then evaluated the HBsAg-specific humoral and cellular immune responses on day 35. We found that T7-EA could induce a high titer of HBsAg-specific IgG2a in serum, this effect was absent with the traditional Alum-adjuvant HBV vaccine, and we observed a further increase in HBsAg-specific IgG1 and IgG2a titers in the T7-EA plus Alum group compared to all other groups (Fig. 4a, b). In terms of the cellular immune response, T7-EA could induce a high quality HBsAg-specific T-cell response, as evidenced by the production of more spot forming cells (SFC) compared to other groups, and a further increase in the HBsAg-specific T-cell response was observed in the T7-EA plus Alum combination group compared to all other groups (Fig. 4c, d). R848 and T7 had no effect on inducing HBsAg-specific T-cell response when used as adjuvants in HBV vaccine. In addition, we didn\u2019t observe significant cytotoxicity of T7-EA on THP-1 cells and side-effects of T7-EA used as an adjuvant in vivo evidenced by spleen/body ratio (Additional file 6: Fig. S4).",

We performed cell depletion experiments with CD4+ or Ly6c+ antibody treatment and found that CD4+ T-cell depletion abrogated the HBsAg-specific T-cell response in our HBV therapeutic vaccine, but Ly6c+ cell depletion showed no significant effect (Fig. 4e, f).

A therapeutic vaccine should, therefore, overcome immune tolerance and induce a protective immune response for HBV clearance [29]. We further tested the efficiency of our newly designed HBV therapeutic vaccine, consisting T7-EA adjuvant, Alum adjuvant and a recombinant HBsAg protein, in breaking immune tolerance in an HBV mouse model. The HBV mouse model was generated using a recombinant AAV carrying the HBV genome (AAV/HBV) that was previously reported as an appropriate model for developing novel therapies for chronic HBV infection [30]. Two months after tail vein injection of the AAV/HBV virus, we administered our HBV therapeutic vaccine intraperitoneally on days 0, 14 and 28. We then detected HBsAg, HBsAb and HBV genomic DNA in the serum at different time points before sacrificing the mice to evaluate the HBsAg-specific T-cell response on day 132 (Fig. 5a). The HBV therapeutic vaccine could induce 3-sixfold increase and persistent HBsAb response compared to a traditional HBV vaccine from days 72 to days 132 (Fig. 5b), and a significant increased HBsAg-specific T-cell response. Notably, all the mice that received the HBV therapeutic vaccine achieved a HBsAg-specific T-cell-positive response (Fig. 5c, d). We also noted significant downregulation of HBV DNA copies and HBsAg titers in mice receiving the HBV therapeutic vaccine compared to those receiving normal saline, but no significant difference between mice receiving the HBV therapeutic vaccine and traditional vaccine (Additional file 7: Fig. S3A, B). These data support that our new HBV therapeutic vaccine can break immune tolerance and induce high quality HBsAg-specific immune responses in an HBV mouse model.",

In this study, we aimed to generate a preferable TLR7 agonist that could be used as adjuvant in an HBV therapeutic vaccine. we chemically synthesized a novel TLR7 agonist, T7-EA by conjugating our reported TLR7 agonist SZU-101 (T7) to ethacrynic acid (EA) [34], the function group of T7 and the \u03b1, \u03b2-unsaturated ketone group of EA were kept. We then performed RNA-seq to evaluate T7-EA activity in Raw 264.7 macrophages that overexpress TLRs. Here, T7-EA retained the function exhibited by unmodified T7 in terms of stimulating similar genes involved in TLR signaling. We did note, however, significant differences between T7-EA and T7 treatments in terms of ISG induction. We then moved our analyses to hTLR7 and hTLR8 reporter cell lines, primary immune cells and in vivo model to characterize T7-EA. We found that T7-EA is an hTLR7-specific agonist and is more potent in inducing IFN-\u03b1 and IL-6 expression compared to T7. In addition, T7-EA exhibited tissue-retaining activity and could stimulate local cytokine and chemokine expression for up to 7 days. To evaluate the adjuvant capacity, we administered T7-EA intraperitoneally in a formulation with Alum adjuvant and a recombinant HBsAg protein. T7-EA could induce Th1-type immune responses, as evidenced by an increased HBsAg-specific IgG2a titer and T-cell response compared to traditional HBV vaccine in normal mice. Importantly, T7-EA could break immune tolerance and induce persistent, high quality HBsAg-specific antibody and T-cell responses in HBV-infected mice. These data thus suggest that T7-EA might be used as an adjuvant in a prophylactic and therapeutic HBV vaccine.",

Therefore, several strategies have been devised to optimize TLR 7/8 agonists, such as conjugation with HIV-1 Gag protein for vaccine development, synergy with CD40 and CpG ODN in augmenting immune responses and the invention of novel imidazoquinolines for adjuvant application [16, 35\u201339]. In this study, we chemically conjugated a TLR7 agonist to EA: EA contains a \u03b1, \u03b2-unsaturated ketone group that can automatically bind to thiol-containing proteins, such as LEF1 [40]. There is an abundant resource of thiol-containing proteins in cells, tissues and body fluids, meaning that T7-EA with a \u03b1, \u03b2-unsaturated ketone group should possess new drug activity [41]. In our system, T7-EA acquired the exo-methylene group which we found enabled T7-EA to automatically bind to sulphur proteins, such as GSH, GSH-T7-EA [M + 1] 936.2. We propose that the \u03b1, \u03b2-unsaturated ketone group might underlie why T7-EA has different pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic characteristics compared to unmodified T7. TLR7 signaling activation in early and newly formed endosomes is linked to type I interferon synthesis [42], whereas TLR7 signaling activation in late-stage endosomes induces cytokines (such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6) in a NF-\u03baB-dependent manner [42]. T7-EA showed more potent TLR7 activation activity compared to T7, but we observed significantly different doe-dependent activity in inducing NF-\u03baB-associated genes and ISGs. To clarify the mechanism of the different activity between T7-EA and T7 in inducing NF-\u03baB-associated genes and ISGs, we think that the distribution of T7-EA and T7 in endosomal vesicles across different stages is worth exploration.",

Thus, TLR7/8 agonists are able to drive T-cell-mediated and B-cell-mediated adaptive immune responses [43, 44]. Local DC cell activation is critical for initiating adaptive immune responses; however, reported pharmacokinetic studies in humans, in which imiquimod solution was injected subcutaneously, showed that the serum levels were detectable within 5 min post-dosing (Tmax: ~ 30 min) and > 95% of the imiquimod was eliminated after 12 h [18]. The short half-life of imiquimod at the injection site is likely suboptimal for local DC activation. Thus, a novel adjuvant (Alum/TLR7) formed by attaching a TLR7 agonist to Alum has been designed [15]. Alum/TLR7 shows better local stimulation effects and adjuvant capacity compared to Alum and T7 alone. Alum/TLR7 is currently in phase I clinical development and has been tested in several disease models, such as in the context of staphylococcus, anthrax, meningococcal meningitis infections [15, 27, 45\u201347]. Here, we generated a coupled molecule T7-EA with local retaining activity and evaluated its potential as an adjuvant in an HBV therapeutic vaccine. T7-EA stimulated a robust HBsAg-dependent Th1 response, as determined by IgG2a induction and T-cell responses in normal mice. We also found a synergistic effect in the T7-EA and Alum combination group, which induced a further increase in the HBsAg-specific T-cell response compared to all other experimental groups. Further studies showed that T7-EA could break immune tolerance and induce persistently high quality HBsAg-specific antibody and T-cell responses in an HBV mouse model. Compared to Alum/TLR7, T7-EA is a small molecule easier to synthesize, store and use, and has a more stable chemical structure. However, a comparison of the adjuvant capacity between Alum/TLR7 and T7-EA is now needed.",

We propose that T7-EA might be used as an adjuvant in HBV therapeutic vaccines as it can break immune tolerance and induce high quality HBsAg-specific immune responses in normal and HBV mouse models. Further studies are now needed to confirm the potential of T7-EA as an adjuvant in HBV therapeutic vaccines in other models and in clinical practice. We believe that T7-EA is a candidate for application as an adjuvant in prophylactic and therapeutic hepatitis B vaccines.",
