Studies on health behavior have revealed the weakness of the self-report approach, for example, being subject to relativism, and influenced by engagement and culture [12\u201314]. Similarly, studies on organizational behavior in health promotion have uncovered the bias of self-reports including under-reporting inappropriate behaviors and over-reporting appropriate behavior [15]. This tendency to respond in socially desirable ways has created a problem involving information accuracy. When the WHO uses IHR self-reported information to allocate resources to strengthen national capacity in infectious disease control, this might mislead the focus if the information is inaccurate [16]. Although external evaluation could partly solve the problem, understanding the reliability of national self-reported capacities is still important because it remains the main approach in collecting information from countries. However studies have rarely focused on the accuracy of national self-reported information.",

ProMED-mail is a nongovernmental emerging disease monitoring program established in 1994 to provide early warning about outbreaks based on information from various sources [19]. The credibility of ProMED-mail and its efforts on reporting timely information were repeatedly confirmed by several studies [20\u201322]. By collecting all sources of information including media reports, official reports, online summaries, local observers, and others without political constraints, reports on ProMED-mail is comprehensive. As an internet-based reporting system with electronic communications approach, the effect of reporting in a timely manner of ProMED-mail was also confirmed by previous study through comparing the timeliness of reporting form the WHO. Apart from the WHO, which reports \u201ca public health emergency of international concern\u201d regulated by IHR 2005, ProMED-mail aims at reporting all kinds of information on outbreaks of infectious diseases.

Third, three diseases, i.e., avian flu, yellow fever, and MERS-CoV, together accounted for over 50% of the reports and outbreak reports were concentrated in specific countries. Therefore, the performance observed in these affected countries had a great impact on overall outcomes.

Forth, countries\u2019 self-reported assessments were not validated. However, this is the reason why we conducted this study to see the reliability of such approach and information.
