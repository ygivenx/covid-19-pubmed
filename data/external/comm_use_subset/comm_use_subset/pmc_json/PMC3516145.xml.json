As RNA structure formation is of hierarchical nature, secondary structure is the basis for the tertiary fold that produces the functional structure. Especially for RNAs, structure determination by experimental means is an intricate and expensive task. Computational RNA structure prediction is therefore an invaluable tool for biologists. Comparative structure prediction is considered the most reliable approach for computational RNA structure prediction. Single sequence structure prediction is always limited by the accuracy of the underlying folding model. Three main streams have been identified for comparative RNA secondary structure prediction: (i) predict a structure from a pre-computed sequence alignment; (ii) simultaneously compute an alignment and a structure and (iii) alignment-free methods (Gardner and Giegerich, 2004).",

Such methods heavily depend on the sequence conservation and quality of the underlying alignment. However, ncRNAs are conserved rather on the structure level than on the sequence level. The gold standard of RNA comparative structure prediction is the Sankoff approach as it does not rely on a high-quality sequence alignment and captures the structural conservation of ncRNAs. Sankoff (1985) introduced a theoretical dynamic programming algorithm for simultaneous folding and aligning for a set of N sequences that takes O(n3N) time and O(n2N) space. Practical variants have been derived which more or less retain the Sankoff principle by sacrificing optimality. Alignment-free methods aim to avoid the pragmatic restrictions made in a practical Sankoff approach as well as the reliance on a high-quality alignment [e.g. CARNAC (Perriquet et al., 2003)]. Note that all of these comparative structure prediction methods exclude the prediction of RNA pseudoknots.",

In fact, the majority of comparative RNA structure prediction methods exclude pseudoknots. Biologists have delivered a wealth of studies, which show that pseudoknots have an astonishing number of diverse functions and occur in most classes of RNA (Staple and Butcher, 2005).

Several of these methods take a sequence alignment as an input. ILM is an algorithm that takes as an input either individual sequences or a sequence alignment (Ruan et al., 2004). A base pair score matrix is prepared initially and helices are added to the structure in an iterative fashion. In the approach hxmatch, a maximum weighted matching algorithm with combined thermodynamic and covariance scores is used (Witwer et al., 2004). This program gives the option to be combined with RNAalifold. KNetFold is a machine learning method, which takes a sequence alignment as an input and outputs a consensus structure allowing pseudoknots (Bindewald and Shapiro, 2006). Simulfold takes an alignment as an input and simultaneously calculates a structure including pseudoknots, a multiple-sequence alignment and an evolutionary tree by sampling from the joint posterior distributions (Meyer and Miklos, 2007). Tfold combines stem stability, covariation and conservation to search for compatible stems and subsequently for pseudoknots for a set of aligned homologous sequences (Engelen and Tahi, 2010). Several comparative structure prediction methods including pseudoknots do not rely on an initial sequence alignment. The graph-theoretical approach comRNA computes stem similarity scores and uses a maximum clique finding algorithm to find pseudoknotted structures (Ji et al., 2004). SCARNA performs pairwise structural alignment of stem fragments with fixed lengths derived from the probability dot plot (Tabei et al., 2008).",

In fact, perfect conservation on the sequence level can be more of a curse than a blessing. Especially ncRNAs are known to evolve quickly and so-called consistent and compensatory base pairs in both sequences will give much more confidence for structure conservation than a sequence alignment. One strong point of the DotKnot method for single sequence pseudoknot prediction (Sperschneider and Datta, 2010; Sperschneider et al., 2011) is that the set of possible H-type pseudoknot candidates (and secondary structure elements) is explicitly computed and thus readily available for further investigation. The main steps in the pairwise pseudoknot prediction approach DotKnot-PW are as follows (Fig. 1):\nRun DotKnot for two unaligned sequences Seqx and Seqy. This returns secondary structure element and H-type pseudoknot candidate dictionaries.Calculate pairwise base pair similarity scores for secondary structure elements and H-type pseudoknot candidates. Keep significant pairs that have a low estimated P-value.Use significant pairs to calculate the set of conserved structure elements and pseudoknots for the two sequences that maximizes a combined free energy and similarity score.\n",

Similar to the case of ungapped local sequence alignments (Karlin and Altschul, 1990), it is assumed here that the base pair similarity scores follow an extreme value distribution. However, the main difference is that a comparison between fixed-length stem fragments is made. It is important to remember that parameters \u03bb and K describe the extreme value distribution of optimal local alignment scores in the asymptotic limit of long sequences (Altschul et al., 2001). Here, the parameters for the generalized extreme value distribution are pre-calculated using maximum likelihood fitting of a distribution to the histogram of a large sample of random base pair similarity scores. The maximum likelihood fitting was performed using the ismev package of the R statistical language for a range of stem lengths (see Supplementary Material). The P-value is defined as the probability to obtain a score greater than or equal to the observed score strictly by chance. A stem si(x) in sequence Seqx and a stem sj(x) in sequence Seqy are a significant pair if the score sim[si(x), sj(y)] has an estimated P-value less than \u03b1.

First, the tested methods can be run with different parameters, possibly producing better results. However, as a typical user has no prior knowledge about the structure, the default parameters for each method are used. Of course, a comprehensive benchmark should include a larger number of structures to obtain a more reliable evaluation. However, in this study, the focus has been on a test set where the structures are supported experimentally. Many structures have been published, which were determined using computational tools and this will inevitably create a bias in a benchmark, and thus they were excluded here.",

This approach called DotKnot-PW is designed as an algorithm for finding the structure including H-type pseudoknots common to two sequences. As shown in Table 1, DotKnot-PW can greatly improve structure predictions for RNA families when compared with the single sequence prediction using DotKnot. In some cases, a comparative approach might have lower sensitivity than a single sequence prediction; however, this should not generally be judged as \u2018inferior\u2019. For example, ncRNAs might preserve some integral base pairs throughout evolution and only these will be detected by a comparative approach, which returns the set of base pairs common to a set of evolutionarily related sequences. DotKnot-PW uses a set of unaligned sequences as the input; therefore, no expert user intervention is required. In the future, DotKnot-PW will be extended to include intramolecular kissing hairpins. Furthermore, constrained folding will be implemented to predict a structure subject to constraints, e.g. enforce certain base pairs or regions, which must remain unpaired.",

Prediction accuracy will inevitably decrease for sequences, which are longer than say 400 nt for any single sequence structure prediction method (Reeder et al., 2006). To achieve reliable results, short sequences should be folded using DotKnot and predictions should be compared with results from other methods from the literature. To gain confidence in predictions, subsequent comparative prediction using DotKnot-PW and other comparative methods is highly recommended. Ideally, experimental verification of computationally predicted pseudoknots should be sought.",
