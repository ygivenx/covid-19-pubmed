The idea is that each combination of population risk factors leads to a different model. Our objective is to determine the model (i.e. the combination of risk factors) that best fits the data. Beyond the simple analysis of the risk factors associated with FIV, this work aims to understand why the variability observed in our disease prevalence data is so large - data on disease prevalence in males exhibited significant extra-Binomial variations. Can we isolate population risk factors that would explain particularly high disease prevalence in some populations? Does the spatial aggregation of populations with high virus prevalence help to explain the variability in disease prevalence? Or, in contrast, is the large variability observed in disease prevalence a natural consequence of the transmissible nature of the virus?",

Finally, we determine confidence intervals for the model parameters. The model is very simple, explains the data well, and hence constitutes an interesting tool for further understanding and control of the spread of FIV in these cat populations.

In order to delimit the study area, we considered the geographical characteristics that might limit movements between the studied cat populations and those outside of the studied area. The spatial organisation of geographical barriers suggests that the populations may be organized into three distinct metapopulations, with rare contacts between cats of different metapopulations (Fig. 1, grey areas). At a finer scale, behavioral observations reveal that males can disperse between populations along roads. By adopting a basic assumption that populations are considered connected when they are not too distant from each other (i.e. less than 2 km) and are connected by roads, we propose a connection network between the different populations (see Fig. 1, solid arrows).",

Unsurprisingly, the probability of FIV extinction decreases with increasing external transmission rate (\u03b5M). More interestingly, below a given threshold (here \u03b5M = 10\u22123) the distribution of FIV prevalence is not affected by \u03b5M, meaning that infrequent infections of FIV from external sources have almost no effect on FIV transmission within already infected populations.

One possible explanation is that the presence of older territorial males in some populations ensures greater social stability, which decreases the rate of at-risk (mating) contacts. Reversely, a negative correlation between FIV prevalence and age of cats could be due to the additional mortality induced by the virus.

Since we detected infected cats in 14 out of the 15 populations (and infected males in 13 of them), we can assume regular viral exchange between populations. Previous theoretical studies have shown the importance of the spatial dispersal of the FIV virus between populations [38]. Due to the topographic isolation of our study area, it seems reasonable to assert that viral exchange between the studied populations is primarily responsible for the reintroduction of the virus into populations where it has become extinct. We proposed two different virus dispersal networks between the populations, but neither significantly improved the goodness-of-fit to the observed data. Although our observations are most likely insufficient to capture the exact dispersal network between populations, the networks we analyzed should be quite realistic, because they are consistent with the natural barriers in the study area.",

An analysis of the confidence region of the male transmission parameters shows that the impact of external infections on FIV prevalence within populations is very limited for the smallest values of the external transmission rate (see Fig. 4c). In this case, the connectivity between populations cannot be revealed by a corresponding correlation in FIV prevalence. In contrast, for the highest values of external transmission rate in the confidence region, we can expect a correlation in FIV prevalence between connected populations. To sum up, the fact that no spatial correlation in FIV prevalence is observed may simply be due to the fact that external infections are relatively rare and thus play almost no role for disease prevalence in already infected populations.",

The main difference between the two approaches, based on binomial and dynamic models, comes from the variability expected by their respective H0 models, as illustrated in Fig. 3a. Binomial models predict much narrower distributions than dynamic models. The consequence is illustrated in Fig. 4, where we can see that the simple SI model accounts for the observed variability in FIV prevalence in males for a wide range of parameters. In contrast, the binomial test on the distribution of the infected cats among the 15 populations rejects the global binomial distribution hypothesis (p\u22480.006). To explain the data with a logistic regression model that assumes binomial distributions, additional risk factors need to be invoked. With dynamic models, risk factors are not required to explain the variability in the male disease prevalence observed here. The implication of that is that bringing evidence for population risk factors in infectious disease requires large sample sizes. In our present case n = 499 is not large enough and further sampling is required to bring evidence of population risk factors for FIV transmission.",

The most important conclusion of the paper, i.e. that dynamic models predict much more variability than models where individuals are independent and hence are sufficient to explain highly variable prevalence data, would remain true for more complex model. Another model assumption is that we neglected the contacts with populations outside the study area (white rectangles in Fig. 1). Since we did not find an important effect of the number of infected neighbors on the disease prevalence in populations, we are confident that adding the neglected populations would not deeply affect our results.",

This value appears rather low, meaning that virus transmission is rather rare at the level of the population. This is not surprising, since experimental results indicate that most of the virus present in the saliva is not infectious [39], suggesting a weak efficiency in disease transmission [7]. Given the high frequency of fights between males in such populations and the low rate at which males acquire the infection (around once every four years in a hypothetical scenario where all males are infected), our results are consistent with the concept of a low probability of virus transmission from bites [9].",
