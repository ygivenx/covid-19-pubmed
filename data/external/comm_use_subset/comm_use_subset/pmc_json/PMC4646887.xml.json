Nonhuman primates (NHPs), such as rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) or common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) inoculated with MERS-CoV via combined intratracheal, intranasal, oral, and ocular routes, develop transient respiratory disease with little or no viremia although lethal disease was observed in a small number of marmosets [1\u20134]. 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]-FDG) PET/CT as a real-time noninvasive approach can be beneficial in providing biomarkers for host immune response and disease progression. [18F]-FDG-PET/CT has been used to track host immune response during monkeypox virus and human immunodeficiency virus-1 infections [5\u20137]. As [18F]-FDG uptake is increased in activated macrophages, lymphocytes, and granulocytes during inflammation, the immune response can be localized by PET imaging [8]. Tracking the host response noninvasively is especially useful when animal species studied is limited and/or expensive to obtain or when animals do not develop overt clinical signs of disease.",

The blood volume fraction (Vb) was included in the modeling. Patlak linear regression method was applied for parameter estimation utilizing the IDIF, [18F]-FDG tissue TACs [16], and PMOD version 3.5 (PMOD Technologies). Tissue TACs were fitted to the models by use of the nonlinear least-squares method with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, which minimizes the weighted sum of squared errors between PET measurement and model solutions. A plot of the ratio Ctis(t)/Cbl(t) against the ratio of cumulative to instantaneous blood activity concentration (\u201cnormalized time\u201d) became linear in the late phase after the tracer injection when the concentration of free (i.e., unmetabolized) [18F]-FDG in the blood had equilibrated with that of free tracer in extravascular volume of distribution. This linear part of the plot was fitted by Eq. (1) to identify the Ki as a slope of a regression line:1\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{tis}}}{C_{\\mathrm{bl}}(t)}={K}_i\\frac{{\\displaystyle \\underset{t=0}{\\overset{t}{\\int }}{C}_{\\mathrm{bl}}(t)}}{C_{\\mathrm{bl}}(t)}+{V}_{\\mathrm{dist}} $$\\end{document}CtisCblt=Ki\u222bt=0tCbltCblt+Vdist",

            "text": "As shown by previously published studies, LN activation during viral infection generates an [18F]-FDG signal that can be easily discerned from background activity [7, 18]. Activated lymphocytes increase glucose uptake by approximately 20-fold over 24 h [19]. Moreover, results from a few longitudinal studies in rhesus macaques challenged with simian-human immunodeficiency virus or humans withdrawing from antiretroviral therapy indicate that increased LN tissue [18F]-FDG uptake preceded fulminant virus replication. Systemic factors such as viral proteins or cytokines could be engaged in lymphoid tissue response [7, 18]. As monocytes are part of the immune response to virus infection (e.g., cytokine release, phagocytosis), correlation between an increase in monocyte fraction and [18F]-FDG uptake in the LNs is not surprising.",

            "text": "We compared kinetic modeling using Ki to analysis using SUV to quantify [18F]-FDG uptake. By definition, SUV represents the radioactivity concentration in the region of interest adjusted for the injected dose and the body weight. Therefore, the SUV is influenced by several parameters such as (1) body composition, (2) blood glucose concentration, and (3) time interval from [18F]-FDG injection to image acquisition. As noted in TACs of bone marrow throughout the study and of mediastinal LNs on days 5\u20139 post-exposure, SUVs did not reach a plateau within 60 min (3600 s) after [18F]-FDG injection. Thus, high metabolic activity of proliferating cells in bone marrow requires longer time for [18F]-FDG to reach steady state in this tissue even under physiological conditions. As the LN biopsies have not been performed in the current study, future studies sampling the tissue from mediastinal LNs at peak response will be able to identify the specific cell type associated with increase in [18F]-FDG uptake in the LNs. Notably, by applying kinetic modeling analysis, we were able to determine a steady state parameter that characterizes the system based on two processes: [18F]-FDG delivery from the blood to the tissue of interest and the state of cell metabolic activity. As multiple time points from PET-acquired data are used in the kinetic modeling analysis, the accuracy of Ki computation for small regions of interest is higher compared with SUVs even in the presence of high noise [16]. In this study, kinetic modeling increases the signal-to-noise ratio resulting in an improvement of the accuracy of measurement and method sensitivity over analysis with SUV. If the effect is mild, then a semiquantitative analysis by SUV will not be able to detect it.",

            "text": "In this study, we attempted to develop an aerosol NHP model of MERS-CoV infection. The current NHP aerosol model failed to cause overt signs of MERS-CoV infection. Comparison of our results to other MERS-CoV challenge studies in rhesus macaques is hampered by the different dose units and route(s) of administration. Doses given in previous studies were expressed as tissue culture infectious dose 50 % (TCID50) and was given by a combination of intratracheal, ocular, oral, and intranasal routes [2, 3] or by intratracheal route only [4]. Nevertheless, as [18F]-FDG-PET quantitated the host response to virus challenge while CT revealed no pathology on the images, the sensitivity of CT for detection of host response is lower than [18F]-FDG-PET [20]. Similarly, results from a MERS-CoV exposure in rabbits demonstrated that MERS-CoV replicates in the lung tissue without the development of overt clinical signs [21]. As subclinical MERS-CoV infection has been reported more often in patients without comorbidities than in patients with comorbidities [22\u201324], this animal model can be used to study the host response to MERS-CoV and to test the intervention strategies aimed at inhibition of MERS-CoV replication [21]. However, suppression of immune responses to MERS-CoV exposure in these animals may be needed to reflect the severity of MERS observed in the majority of patients.",

            "text": "[18F]-FDG is generally considered to be a nonspecific tracer for inflammation/immune activation, and the cells involved in the host response cannot be specified by [18F]-FDG-PET. However depending on the virus and the disease stage, certain populations of immune cells will be involved in the response. Therefore, the location and pattern of [18F]-FDG changes in the body during infection progression will be virus specific. Compared with clinical application in which [18F]-FDG-PET is mostly used for diagnostic purposes, preclinical studies are performed under controlled conditions using within subject design. The metabolic map of the body determined prior to virus exposure is used to identify the location of the tissues with elevated glycolytic activity after the exposure. The specific pattern of [18F]-FDG changes in the foci identified by PET at pre- and post-exposure states are monitored day-by-day. When the pattern and the location of [18F]-FDG changes are identified following virus exposure, this pattern can be used to monitor the effects of treatment. In our previous study [6], we described the host response to monkeypox virus showing the pattern and the location of [18F]-FDG changes in lymphoid tissues that was distinctive from that observed after MERS-CoV exposure. In addition, we were able to describe the difference between surviving and non-surviving animals that was detected at early stages of monkeypox infection. Further ongoing studies of the analysis of biopsied tissue samples from the locations identified by PET should be able to shed some light on specific mechanisms associated with [18F]-FDG changes after virus exposure.",
