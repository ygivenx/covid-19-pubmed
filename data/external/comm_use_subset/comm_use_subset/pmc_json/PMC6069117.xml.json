Together with three other families (Arteriviridae, Mesoniviridae, and Roniviridae), the Coronaviridae are part of the order Nidovirales (1). Coronaviridae are divided into four genera, Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus. Feline coronaviruses (FCoVs) are closely related to canine coronaviruses (CCoVs) and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV); all three have been classified as one virus species called Alphacoronavirus 1. Other more distantly related viruses in the genus Alphacoronavirus include, for example, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), and human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) (2).",

On the basis of antigenic properties, FCoVs can be classified into two serotypes (5\u20137). The vast majority (80% to 95%) of natural infections occurring worldwide are caused by serotype I FCoVs, while serotype II FCoVs are less common in the field and mainly occur in Asia (3, 8\u201311). Interestingly, serotype II FCoVs evolve by recombination between serotype I FCoVs and CCoVs (12\u201315). For both FCoV serotypes, two biotypes with fundamentally different pathogenicities in cats have been defined. Feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) causes persistent infections of the gut with only minor or no clinical symptoms (16\u201318). In sharp contrast, feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), the second biotype, causes a fatal systemic disease termed feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). It is characterized by fibrinous and/or granulomatous serositis, protein-rich serous effusion in body cavities, and granulomatous lesions in various organs (19\u201323).",

            "text": "It is now generally accepted that harmless FECVs evolve into highly pathogenic FIPVs by accumulating mutations in their genomes (24, 25). The parental FECV and the resulting FIPV from the same cat are referred to as a \u201cvirus pair.\u201d To date, the mutations responsible for FECV-FIPV biotype switch have not been identified. However, on the basis of extensive comparative sequence analyses of FECV and FIPV isolates, it was concluded that mutations in the S and accessory genes are involved in the development of FIP (25\u201332). In this regard, accessory gene 3c attracted particular interest because it was found to contain deletions, frameshift mutations, and other nonsynonymous mutations in about 80% of the FIPV isolates, while FECVs carry an intact 3c gene. Accordingly, mutations in 3c were considered important virulence markers associated with FIP development (25, 32). More-recent publications suggest that an intact 3c gene is required for viral replication in the gut and that, in contrast to previous suggestions, 3c mutations are not necessarily linked to the development of FIP (26, 33\u201335). However, at this stage, the possibility cannot be excluded that mutations leading to truncation or loss of 3c coding sequences contribute to the emergence of viruses causing FIP. In reports of recent studies based on comparative sequence analyses of complete FECV and FIPV genomes, three substitutions in the S gene were suggested to discriminate FIPVs from FECV (26\u201328). Two of these changes were located in the fusion peptide (FP) and one in the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) region of the S protein. It was proposed that these substitutions change the viral cell tropism and enable efficient infection of monocytes/macrophages. Another study concentrated on differences in the furin cleavage site located between the S1 and S2 domains of the S protein (29). The respective analyses revealed that all of the FECVs contained an intact and functional furin cleavage motif whereas 10 of 11 FIPVs had amino acid changes within (or very close to) the furin cleavage site, thereby affecting the efficiency of furin-mediated S protein cleavage. Modulation of the furin cleavage by substitutions in the respective motif was proposed to be important for the switch from FECV to FIPV (29, 36).",

However, the idea that particular mutations in the FCoV S gene and/or accessory genes indeed lead to a biotype switch from FECV to FIPV remains to be experimentally verified. In order to assess the involvement of mutations in FIPV development, the generation of well-defined viruses by reverse genetics is required (37). One major obstacle for studies on the molecular pathogenesis of FIP is the failure to grow serotype I field FECVs/FIPVs in standard cell culture systems (38). Thus far, reverse genetics systems for FECV field isolates have not been available. Only a few serotype I FIPV laboratory strains can be grown in vitro, but those viruses lost their ability to induce FIP due to cell culture adaptation (6, 39\u201342). Although serotype II FIPVs can be grown in cell culture and some of them also induce FIP, the lack of corresponding serotype II FECVs limits their use (15, 17).",

The full-length genomic sequence was determined by sequence analyses of overlapping reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) fragments amplified from viral RNA and was deposited in GenBank (see below). The 29,298-nucleotide (nt) genome of the serotype I FECV field isolate had the typical genome organization of FCoVs. The 5\u2032 untranscribed regions (5\u2032UTRs) and 3\u2032UTRs of the FECV genome were found to comprise 311 and 276 nt, respectively.

Generally, virus titers obtained after transfection (passage 0) are low and the production of high-titer virus stocks of the recombinant viruses requires an amplification step in vitro. Accordingly, reverse genetic systems have been established only for CoVs (including FCoVs) for which cell culture systems are available that efficiently support viral replication (40, 43\u201348). Serotype I FECV field isolates cannot be propagated in standard cell culture systems. To address this problem, we sought to recover recombinant FECV without any in vitro passaging steps. As a first step toward this goal, we generated a recombinant serotype I FECV in which the S gene was replaced with that of serotype II FCoV strain 79-1146. The latter virus was chosen as an S gene donor because previous experiments had demonstrated that this particular S gene conveyed efficient viral growth in vitro (40, 47). Using this approach, we sought to address the issue of whether the genome of the FECV field isolate characterized in this study supports the replication of and gives rise to the production of infectious FECV progeny when engineered as a chimera with the 79-1146 S gene.",

As shown in Fig. 1A, the modification of vrecFCoV-II was carried out in multiple steps by vaccinia virus-mediated homologous recombination. First, the 79-1146-derived sequences downstream of the S gene (3a, 3b, 3c, E, M, N, 7a, 7b, and the 3\u2032UTR) were replaced by the corresponding parts of the FECV field isolate cDNA, resulting in vrecFCoV-II-FECV3a-3\u00b4UTR. Second, serotype II-derived 5\u2032UTR and open reading frame 1a (ORF1a) sequences were removed from the cDNA and the serotype II ORF1b was replaced by the corresponding FECV part. Thus, the resulting vrecFECV1b-3\u2019UTR-S79 vaccinia virus contained the FECV-derived ORF1b, ORF3abc, E, M, N, 7ab, and 3\u2032UTR sequences and the S gene of serotype II FCoV strain 79-1146.

Accordingly, the experiment performed with chimeric virus recFECV-S79 as described above was only an intermediate step. To generate recombinant serotype I FECV field virus with its authentic FECV S gene, the serotype II S sequence in vrecFECV-S79 was replaced with the appropriate S gene from the FECV field isolate, resulting in vrecFECV (Fig. 2A). The recovery of recombinant viruses from the full-length FECV cDNA was performed as described above. Since serotype I FECV cannot be propagated in vitro, we expected that recombinant viruses would not be able to grow in cell culture. It was therefore not surprising that inoculation of FCWF cells with the supernatant of electroporated cells did not lead to a CPE. Moreover, FECV-specific antigens could not be detected with a monoclonal antibody (anti-M) by immunofluorescence. To address the issue of whether FECV particles were released from the electroporated cells, the cell culture supernatant was subjected to an ultracentrifugation step and the pellet obtained was used for further analyses, including (i) electron microscopy, (ii) Western blotting, and (iii) RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 2B, transmission electron microscopy studies revealed that in the supernatant of electroporated cells, virus particles with coronavirus-like morphological features, including the typical spike structures, were present which looked indistinguishable from recFECV-S79 particles. To verify that the recFCoV particles contained CoV structural proteins, we performed a Western blot analysis using an M protein-specific monoclonal antibody. As shown in Fig. 2C, a prominent band corresponding to the FECV structural M protein could be detected, corroborating the release of recFCoV particles from the transfected cells. Next, the incorporation of viral genome RNA into these particles was assessed by using a capsid protection assay as described previously (49). For this purpose, purified particles were subjected to RNase treatment to remove any free viral RNA prior to RNA extraction from the virus particles. The presence of viral genome RNA in these particles was confirmed by RT-PCR.",

As indicated above, the titer of this virus could not be determined by plaque assay. We therefore decided to use a Western blot analysis to estimate the amount of M protein present in purified recFECV particles. As a reference, we used the M protein content of a control virus that was known to produce infectious virus progeny following electroporation of viral genome RNA and that can be titrated by virus plaque assay. Following electroporation of in vitro-transcribed full-length genome RNAs of recFECV and recFECV-S79, respectively, in a parallel experiment, cell culture supernatants of electroporated cells were collected and subjected to two rounds of ultracentrifugation. The pellet fractions were resuspended in identical volumes of NTE buffer. Equal amounts of the purified recFECV and recFECV-S79 stocks, along with 1:2 and 1:10 dilutions prepared from these stocks, were subjected to Western blot analysis using an M protein-specific monoclonal antibody to compare the amounts of M protein present in the viral rescue experiments performed with recFECV and recFECV-S79, respectively (Fig. 2D). Quantification of the M protein signals in the respective diluted and undiluted fractions revealed very similar amounts of this protein for recFECV and recFECV-S79 (Fig. 2E). On the basis of the comparison of the M protein contents and the titers determined for recFECV-S79 using a virus plaque assay with FCWF cells (5 \u00d7 106 PFU/ml), we concluded that recFECV also contained about 5 \u00d7 106 virus particles/ml. To further support this conclusion, we also determined the genome copy numbers in all fractions (stock and dilutions 1:2 and 1:10) of recFECV and recFECV-S79 by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) after removal of possible RNA molecules outside the particles (capsid protection assay). This experiment revealed very similar genomic RNA amounts of recFECV and recFECV-S79 in both the undiluted and the diluted material (Fig. 2F).",

While the virus particles with serotype II spike (recFECV-S79) enabled efficient infection of cat cells, the authentic FECV spike did not allow the virus to grow and spread in a cell monolayer in vitro. The lack of CPE development and FECV-specific antigens in FCWF cells inoculated with recFECV-containing cell culture supernatant suggests that the in vitro propagation of recFECVs critically depends on the particular S gene used to construct this virus rather than on other viral genes. Furthermore, in spite of the inability to passage recFECV in vitro, we showed that similarly large amounts of recFECV and recFECV-S79 virions could be recovered from cells in passage 0 without further amplification by viral passaging in permissive cells.",

FCoVs with the serotype II strain 79-1146 spike have been reported to efficiently infect cats irrespective of the virus backbone (37, 40). Accordingly, recFECV-S79 was used as a control. Four 5-month-old seronegative specific-pathogen-free (SPF) cats were infected with 1 \u00d7 107 PFU of recFECV (cats 1 and 2) or recFECV-S79 (cats 3 and 4). The numbers of virions used for the cat infection experiments were determined by plaque assay for recFECV-S79 and estimated for recFECV as described above. To avoid cross-contamination, the two groups were housed separately. Previously, oronasal and intraperitoneal (i.p.) infection routes had generally been used for experimental infections of cats with FCoVs (16, 18, 40, 41, 50\u201353). To mimic the natural route of FCoV infections, one animal in each of both groups (cats 1 and 3) received the virus inoculum oronasally. The remaining two cats (cats 2 and 4) were inoculated intraperitoneally. The animals were monitored for clinical signs on a daily basis for a period of 8.5 weeks. To assess virus shedding, fecal swab samples were collected from each cat on a daily basis and analyzed by nested reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Furthermore, blood samples were collected weekly to monitor FCoV-specific antibody responses in serum samples during the course of the experiment.",

Two samples collected from cats 3 and 4 at 1 week p.i. that had tested positive by nested RT-PCR also tested positive using the qRT-PCR assay.

Consistent with this, an immunohistochemistry (IHC) study revealed that FCoV-specific antigens could be detected only in samples originating from the colon (Fig. 4). These data are in agreement with the localization of FECV nucleic acid and proteins reported for naturally occurring persistent FECV infections (18, 54, 55) and corroborate our conclusion that the recFECV generated in this study is able to establish persistent infections that are similar to those caused by FECVs from the field.",

            "text": "In the course of FCoV infections, which generally cause mild or no symptoms in cats, virus variants may emerge that have a fundamentally different pathogenic potential from that of the parental virus (4, 34, 38, 56\u201358). The biotype switch from FECV to FIPV (i.e., the lethal biotype of FCoV) has been estimated to occur in approximately 5% of persistently infected cats (4, 59). Over the past years, significant efforts by several laboratories have been made to identify genetic changes that are involved in FECV-to-FIPV biotype switches. This information is essential for understanding the molecular basis of FIP pathogenesis, which, in turn, may help the development of new diagnostic tools and, possibly, novel therapeutic and prophylactic strategies to combat this important disease. Differences between the genomes of FECVs and FIPVs have been identified by comparative sequence analyses of FECVs and FIPVs and were assumed to be responsible for the biotype switch (26\u201329). Although the described changes correlate with the emergence of FIPV, the specific contribution(s) of single or combined amino acid substitutions to viral pathogenesis and disease progression in infected cats was not established because suitable experimental systems were not available at the time. For this, recombinant viruses with known genome sequences, along with a set of genetically engineered mutants derived from this particular parental virus, have to be generated by reverse genetics and characterized in animal experiments. Unfortunately, FECV field isolates do not grow in cell culture and, more specifically, fail to produce infectious virus progeny unless they are adapted to in vitro growth conditions by serial passaging, which is known to result in mutations in different regions of the viral genome. The lack of suitable cell culture systems also posed a major obstacle in the development of reverse genetics approaches for these viruses. So far, reverse genetics systems have not been established for any of the field viruses, apart from several cell culture-adapted FCoV strains that, however, turned out to be unsuitable for studying the molecular pathogenesis of FIP (37, 40, 46, 60, 61). The major hurdle in establishing reverse genetics systems for FECV field isolates was the inability to recover infectious recombinant viruses from a cDNA clone. We therefore consider it a major achievement that an efficient FECV rescue system could be developed in the present study. Following extensive procedures performed to optimize a previously established vaccinia virus-based system (40, 44, 46, 47), high-titer recFECV virus stocks were produced.",

First, we sought to confirm that the serotype I FECV-derived backbone enables efficient viral replication if combined with the S gene of the serotype II FIPV strain 79-1146. The latter was used because this particular S protein was previously shown to support virus growth in cell culture irrespective of the FCoV backbone used (40, 47). The resulting chimeric virus, recFECV-S79, could be rescued and grown to high titers in vitro, confirming that the FECV backbone was fully functional. Second, we generated a recombinant vaccinia virus carrying the full-length FECV cDNA (including the authentic S gene). Next, BHK cells expressing the FECV N protein were electroporated with recombinant full-length recFECV RNA and supernatants collected from these cells were used to inoculate feline cells. Given that these cells are not permissive for type I field FCoVs, we were not surprised that neither CPE nor FECV-specific antigens could be detected in cat cells inoculated with the supernatant of electroporated BHK cells. However, using a range of methods, we were able to show that recFECVs had been released from the electroporated cells. The release of coronavirus-like particles was demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy, and the identity of purified (and RNase-treated) particles was corroborated further by RT-PCR analysis using FECV genome RNA-specific primers and Western blotting with a FCoV M protein-specific monoclonal antibody. The M protein content and genomic RNA content determined for the recFECV and recFECV-S79 preparations were found to be very similar (Fig. 2D to F), which led us to conclude that the rescue efficiencies were similar for the two viruses. The data also support the idea that the in vitro propagation of recombinant FECVs exclusively depends on the type of the spike protein of virus particles.",

            "text": "Next, we addressed the issue of whether recFECV can induce a productive infection in the natural host. Cats were infected with recFECV or recFECV-S79 using equal amounts of virus. In the two groups, the virus was applied oronasally to one cat and intraperitoneally (i.p.) to the other. Infection with recFECV resulted in continuous virus shedding during the entire course of the experiment. Of 61 fecal swab samples obtained on a daily basis, 57 and 59 samples were found to be FCoV positive (by nested RT-PCR) in the cats infected oronasally and intraperitoneally, respectively. These data show that, irrespective of the infection route, recFECV established persistent infections of the gut. The analysis of FCoV-specific antibody responses revealed that recFECV induced relatively low antibody titers that were very similar to what was previously reported for natural infections with FECV (8, 54, 62). Similar results were observed after oronasal infection of two additional cats (cats 5 and 6) in an independent experiment, indicating that recFECV could reproducibly induce a harmless persistent infection. To determine the major sites of recFECV replication in vivo, the cat infected oronasally (cat 1) was subjected to a postmortem analysis at 8.5 weeks postinfection. Among the large number of tissue samples collected, only the colon tissue samples tested positive for FCoV M protein and viral genome, while viral RNA and protein could not be detected in other tissue samples, confirming that recFECV had established a persistent infection of the colon. This observation is in agreement with the localization of the virus reported for natural FECV infections (18, 54, 55). Finally, we determined the recFECV sequence from fecal samples collected right before the cat was euthanized. The sequence analysis revealed that the majority of nonsynonymous nucleotide changes mapped to the S gene and particularly to the S1 subunit. Desmarets et al. found 8 nonsynonymous mutations in the S1 subunit of the FCoV spike at 84 days p.i. (50). Since the S1 domain is known to be a major antigenic determinant for the induction of adaptive immune responses (54, 63\u201366), it is conceivable that the observed changes in this subunit represent immune escape variants. A structural model produced by Protein Homology/analogy Recognition Engine V 2.0 (Phyre 2) for the recFECV S1 subunit suggests that the observed amino acid substitutions in the S1 domain map to surface regions outside the receptor-binding site (Fig. 5). This localization of amino acid substitutions on the surface of the S1 subunit (including its 0 domain) strongly suggests that these changes might contribute to viral escape from the host immune system rather than increasing/adjusting the affinity to a cellular receptor as suggested in a previous study of the HCoV-229E S protein (67). Taken together, the recFECV sequence data obtained from samples collected at a late stage of infection provide independent evidence that the recFECV produced in this study is adapted to the specific ecologic niche from which it was initially isolated (i.e., feline colon). Thus, recFECV can be expected to provide an excellent tool for future studies into the biological properties of FECVs and the genetic changes required to generate the FIPV biotype.",

The samples tested positive (with nested RT-PCR) only sporadically (in 12 and 11 of 61 fecal swab samples) in the cats infected oronasally and intraperitoneally, respectively. Data generated by qRT-PCR confirmed these results. Interestingly, and in contrast to the titers obtained for FCoV, very high (>1:20,480) serum antibody titers were determined for both recFECV-S79-infected cats, reflecting a strong immune response that was most likely due to a systemic infection. The lack of clinical symptoms in the cats infected with FECV-S79 indicates that the S protein alone of an FIPV strain does not lead to a biotype switch even though it may be responsible for a transition from an enteric to a systemic infection. Interestingly, by the time of necropsy (8.5 weeks p.i.), none of the organ samples obtained from the cat infected oronasally with recFECV-S79 tested positive for FECV by PCR and IHC. It is, therefore, tempting to speculate that the strong immune response elicited by the reFECV-S79 infection eliminated the virus.",

Using recFECV as a tool, the role of FECV-FIPV \u201cdiscriminatory mutations\u201d in the emergence of FIPVs can be directly evaluated. For example, previously proposed \u201cdiscriminatory mutations\u201d in the S protein, such as M1058L, S1060A, I1108T, and D1108Y (26\u201328), as well as a nonfunctional furin cleavage site (29) can be introduced into the recFECV S gene and possible effects on the pathogenicity of the resulting recombinant viruses analyzed in vivo. Also, using the technology established in this study, an FECV-FIPV \u201cvirus pair\u201d obtained from a cat suffering from FIP will serve as a basis to construct a set of chimeric serotype I field viruses to identify the genes and mutations that determine an FIPV biotype. To do this, infectious clones of an FECV and the corresponding FIPV have to be produced. Systematic exchanges of genome segments from FECV with matching genome segments from FIPV will allow the mapping of the genetic changes required for turning an FECV biotype into an FIPV biotype. Obviously, the protocols developed in this study may also be useful to develop reverse genetics systems for other RNA viruses with large genomes (such as other coronaviruses and nidoviruses) for which suitable cell culture systems are not available.",

For the infection of animals with recombinant FCoVs, four specific-pathogen-free (SPF) cats were used at the age of 5 months in the first experiment and a further two cats in the second experiment. Upon arrival, the kittens were tested for FCoV seronegativity and held in a FCoV-free environment for 2 weeks prior to infection. During this time, fecal and serum samples were analyzed to ensure that the cats had not been exposed to FCoVs. Groups of two kittens were kept together for the duration of the experiment (8.5 weeks) in strictly separated rooms. One animal in each group was inoculated intraperitoneally whereas the other cat was infected oronasally with supernatant of electroporated cells (1 \u00d7 107 PFU in 2 ml) in the first experiment.
