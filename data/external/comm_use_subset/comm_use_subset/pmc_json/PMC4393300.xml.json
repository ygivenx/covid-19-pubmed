            "text": "G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily constitutes the largest family of receptors in cell responsible for mediating the effects of over 50% of drugs in the market now-a-days [1\u20138]. GPCRs are involved in the transmission of a variety of signals to the interior of the cell and can be activated by a diverse range of small molecules including nucleotides, amino acids, peptides, proteins and odorants. Activation of GPCRs results in a conformational change followed by a signal cascade that passes information to the inside of the cell by interacting with a protein known as heterotrimeric G-proteins. There are three main classes of GPCRs (A, B and C) depending on their sequence similarity to Rhodopsin (Rho) (Class A). Class A GPCRs is the largest group and encompasses a wide range of receptors including receptors for odorants, adenosine, \u03b2-adrenergic and Rhodopsin [1\u20138]. The \u03b2-adrenergic receptors (\u03b2-ARs) are Gs protein\u2013coupled receptors that play important roles in cardiovascular function and disease, through serving as receptors for the neurohormones: norepinephrine and epinephrine. Norepinephrine released from cardiac sympathetic nerves activates myocyte \u03b21-ARs, which activates adenylyl cyclase via stimulatory G-protein (Gs). The rise in the intracellular [cAMP] level causes the phosphorylation of several intracellular proteins by means of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A. Such type of activated \u03b21-AR results in an increased cardiac inotropy, lusitropy, and chronotropy and the secretion of rennin, all of which contribute to regulate the cardiac functions and blood pressure [9\u201310]. \u03b21-AR predominates in the heart, representing about 80% of the myocardial \u03b2-ARs; thus, they tend to be viewed as the most significant \u03b2-ARs with respect to the cardiovascular system. \u03b21- and \u03b22-ARs in kidneys stimulate the release of renin, thereby playing a role in the activation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system [9\u201310].",

They are also commonly used to control the symptoms of atrial fibrillation and other arrhythmias [11]. There are no cardiovascular drugs that have a wider range of indications than \u03b2-blockers, making them a critical drug class for the management of cardiovascular disease. The availability of uses for \u03b2-blockers also suggests that the activation of \u03b2-ARs, or the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), plays an essential function in most cardiovascular diseases. The fact that \u03b21-AR selective antagonists are equivalent to non-selective blockers in essentially all situations provides additional evidence that \u03b21-ARs are the more important \u03b2-receptors with respect to cardiovascular disease. The development of a large number of rational inhibitors that have the ability to modulate the activity of such receptors has been a major goal for the pharmaceutical industries to improve the clinical treatment of various disease including hypertension, heart failure and asthma [12]. However, finding specific drug against a particular \u03b2-ARs drug target is a slow and laborious process. Furthermore, the lack of 3D structure of hsADRB1 is an obstacle in the identification of specific drug like molecules.",

The use of computational techniques in drug discovery and development process is rapidly gaining popularity, implementation and appreciation. There will be an intensifying effort to apply computational power to combine biological and chemical space in order to rationalize the drug discovery, designing and optimization phenomena. Today, Computer Aided Drug Design (CADD) is based on the knowledge of structure, either of the receptor, or that of the ligand. The former is described as Structure-based while the later as Ligand-based drug designing. Because it is difficult and time-consuming to obtain experimental structures from methods such as X-ray crystallography and protein NMR for every protein of interest, homology modeling is a widely used in silico technique providing the useful structural models for generating hypotheses about a protein's function and directing further experimental work [15].",

Initially, a homology model was generated by ORCHESTRAR that lacks a region of 45 amino acid residues (209\u2013254) of the cytoplasmic loop of TM5 located within the target sequence but absent in the template structure. This region was modeled by I-TASSER, an integrated platform for automated protein structure and function whose prediction is based on sequence-to-structure-to-function paradigm as per multiple threading alignments by LOMETS [33]. The model generated by I-TASSER was named as sub-model 1. Five sub-models were evaluated by replica-exchange Monte Carlo simulations with low free-energy states, spatial restrains and alignments TM regions [34] to identify the best structural alignment almost closed to the structural analogs on the basis of structural similarity. Any further steric clashes were removed to refine the coordinates, and the final results of all sub-models were based on sequence-structure-function paradigm obtained from the consensus of structural similarity and confidence score (C-score) of I-TASSER server. C-score value is the quality for the predicted sub-model on the basis of threading method. Stereochemical properties of each sub-model were evaluated and the best selected sub-model was incorporated to the homology model of hs\u03b2ADR1, generated previously by ORCHESTRAR and after insertion of the model the finalized modelled is subjected for optimization.",

Since 2R4R, 3KJ6 and 24RS are available as apo form with fewer scores, identity and positive values, these structures were not used in this study. Similarly, the complexes 3P0G, 2RH1 and 3SN6 were not used for the modeling of hs\u03b2ADR1 structure due to their lower scores. Hence, 2Y00 is used according to the BLAST results but to establish more confidence on the top-ranked search, we opted for two sorts of multiple sequence alignments: raw multiple sequence alignment and manually-edited multiple sequence alignment. For raw alignment, the ten top-ranked templates sequences (2Y00, 2VT4, 2R4R, 3KJ6, 2R4S, 3SN6, 4GBR, 3P0G, 2RH1 and 3PDS) were aligned against the target sequence illustrated in S2 Fig and S1 Table.

The first 50 residues from N-terminus and 84 residues (393\u2013477) from C-terminus were omitted from the target sequence due to the absence of corresponding homologous sequence in the template and has no important residue which is necessary to be in helical segments. The template sequence has 483 amino acid residues whereas the structure of 33\u2013368 residues has been resolved (total 315 residues as some residues are missing).

The structural and physicochemical properties of the model were validated by PROCHECK. The Ramachandran plot generated by PROCHECK is depicted in S4 Fig. The Ramachandran plot reveals that the model has a good geometrical consistency. According to the Ramachandran plot, ~85%, 13.5% and 1.3% residues are located within the favorable, allowed and the generously allowed regions, respectively while only one residue (Ile208) is found to be in the disallowed region. The visual inspection revealed that Ile208 is far away from the active site region and do not lie within 5\u00c5 of active site. Additionally, stereochemical properties of the model were validated by Verify3D web server. Verify3D evaluated the local environment and inter-residue contacts in the model. Ideally, the 3D-1D profile for each of the 20 amino acids should be in range of 0\u20130.2. Values less than zero are considered as inaccurate for the homology model. The Verify3D plot of hs\u03b2ADR1 model shows that the average score of all amino acid residues is 0.16 which is relatively closed to 0.20. Moreover, ERRAT, a protein structure verification web server was used to verify the model on the basis of model building and refinement, and is extremely useful in making decisions about reliability of the homology model. ERRAT results showed that the overall quality factor for the hs\u03b2ADR1 model is 73.35%., suggesting that the generated model is robust and can be use for virtual screening purpose in future. The 3D model of hs\u03b2ADR1 revealed an excellent agreement with the experimentally determined 3D structure of Mg\u03b2ADR1. (Fig 4) shows the superimposed view of hs\u03b2ADR1 model and Mg\u03b2ADR1 structure. The calculated polypeptide backbone (C\u03b1, C and N atoms) root mean square deviation (RMSD) of hs\u03b2ADR1 model against Mg\u03b2ADR1 is 0.13 \u01fa. This low RMSD value indicates the resemblance of the modeled polypeptide backbone with the template. However, RMSD values slightly vary at C-terminus due to the sub-model region (209\u2013254) of the target protein. Additionally, the modeled hs\u03b2ADR1 is also superimposed on PDB IDs: 2YCW, 2YCX, 2YCY, and 2YCZ with RMSD values of 0.873 \u01fa, 0.973 \u01fa, 0.894 \u01fa, and 0.871 \u01fa, respectively (S5 Fig). These PDBs have comparable sequence similarities, identities and source as that of the template but some conformational changes has been observed for helix6 [36]. However, we found no observable conformational changes especially for those amino acid residues that are involved in molecular interactions with high-affinity antagonists I32, P32 and CAU located within H6 and CL-3. Finally, the hs\u03b2ADR1 model is subjected to the sequence manipulation suite Ident and Sim [37] to observe the similarity and identity of the model with respect to the template structure. The results are better but afterwards much improved after manual editing of the target and template sequences, similarity and identity ratios are increased from 73% to 75.4% and 67% to 68.4%, respectively.",

The conserved Asp in DRY motif at the cytoplasmic end of helix 3 believes to regulate the transition state of active state, while the adjacent Arg is crucial for G-protein activation [40]. Another conserved penta-peptide NPXXY motif known as Tyrosine toggle switch (where X usually represents a hydrophobic residue and N is rarely exchanged against D) located at the C terminus of TM-7 which contributes to GPCR internalization and signal transduction. Several site-directed mutagenesis studies revealed the importance of this motif in signaling [41]. The NPXXY motif is present at position Arg323(7.49), Pro324(7.50), Ileu325(7.51), Ileu326(7.52) and Tyr327(7.53) in the hs\u03b2ADR1model. The direct interaction of NPXXY motif with helix 8 is likely to be very significant in regulating the interactions of the C-terminal end of the GPCRs with various other cellular components involved in signaling (e.g, the PDZ domain), sequestration, and internalization of GPCRs. The tyrosine residue of NPXXY motif plays a decisive role in the phosphorylation of the receptor, presumably by controlling the affinity and activation capacity for the cognate G-protein [42]. Conserved regions of LAXXD motif which is involved in ligand binding and receptor cycling present in TM-2 at position Lys50(2.46), Ala51(2.47), Ser52(2.48), Ala53(2.49), Asp54(2.50) [43]. In general, PDZ domains bind to a short region of the C-terminus of other specific proteins. These short regions bind to the PDZ domain by beta-sheet augmentation. This means that the beta sheet in the PDZ domain is extended by the addition of a further beta-strand from the tail of the binding partner protein. GMGL, Gly10(1.34), Met11(1.35), Gly12(1.36) and Val13(1.37), is the PDZ-binding motif located within the C-terminal domain of modeled hs\u03b2ADR1 [44]. These domains help anchor TM to the cytoskeleton and hold together signaling complexes. PDZ domain have many functions, from regulating the trafficking and targeting of proteins to assembling signaling complexes, and networks designed for efficient and specific signal transduction [45]. The amphipathic amino acid residues present in helix 8 are conserved among all human GPCRs (residues 327\u2013341), located between the TM7 bound with helix 7. The palmitoylation occurs at N-terminus while the biosynthesis of receptor and the proper regulation of surface expression occur at C-terminus of hs\u03b2ADR1. The side chain of two crucial residues of helix8, Asp332(8.49) and Arg334(8.51), are projected within the hydrophilic interface involved in stimulatory G-protein (Gs) activation while the residue Phe333(8.50) and Phe337(8.54) are buried in the hydrophobic core of the helix [46].",

Disruption and the introduction of a salt bridge reduce and increase the stability of the protein, respectively [47]. In membrane proteins, one expects salt bridges to be particularly important because of a smaller dehydration penalty (loss of favorable contacts with water) on salt bridge formation [48]. Charged groups become largely dehydrated when inserted into membranes, and therefore, experience a smaller change in hydration between non-salt-bridging and salt-bridging states. There should also be a smaller effect because of solvent screening, strengthening salt-bridge interactions [48]. Multiple salt bridges are observed in the homology model of hs\u03b2ADR1; Asp154:Arg157, Asp209:Arg213, Asp332:Lys335, Glu155:Arg158, Glu200:Lys203 and Glu212:Arg213. In addition, salt bridges can also serve as key interactions in much the same way as disulfide bonds (S6 Fig).",

The re-docking results were quantified on the basis of RMSD between the top-ranked docked conformation and the co-crystallized (termed as \u02c8reference\u02c8) ligand and visual analysis.
