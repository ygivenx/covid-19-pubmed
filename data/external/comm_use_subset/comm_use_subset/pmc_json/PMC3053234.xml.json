The selection, persistence and spread of such strains within a population is often puzzling and can lead to failures of the usual treatments against infections [2]. Moreover, administration of antimicrobial agents used in human medicine to production animals, such as fluoroquinolones, could lead to the emergence of public health issues due to the persistence and dissemination of resistant bacteria [3]. Although surveillance of resistance in zoonotic bacteria has a direct implication on public health policies, monitoring bacteria from the commensal flora, such as Escherichia coli strains, remains a good indicator of the resistance pattern within a population. Knowledge of the resistance pattern in such commensal bacteria is pivotal because of the risk of transmission of resistant genes from non-pathogenic to zoonotic bacteria [4].",

[6] observed that quinolone treatment caused a strong selective pressure in the E. coli population of the treated sows and their piglets. In this study, the treatment was routinely administered to pregnant sows around farrowing-time. Even though the effects were transitory, the faecal flora of the piglets was clearly modified by the treatment of their dams, leading to a dramatic increase in the within-host proportion of resistant E. coli. The long-term impact of such routine practices of antimicrobial use is unknown, but enrichment of the resistant flora with duration of use is highly suspected [7]. Studies of the long term ecological evolution within a population require a mathematical modelling approach [8,9].",

To the best of our knowledge, only one of these modelling approaches focussed on the impact of antimicrobial consumption on the emergence and/or transmission of resistant strains within a finisher pig herd [13]. This study highlighted the need for a modelling framework which incorporates both current knowledge of the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance in animals and the key factors which can be used to characterize within-herd dynamics of resistant bacteria under the influence of antimicrobial pressure. Knowledge of the transmission dynamics of resistant bacteria would improve the understanding of the influence of on-site farming practices (drug usage, infection control) on the dynamics of resistant bacteria in animals and could also form the basis for a release assessment (component of a risk assessment). Abatih et al. [13] used a deterministic SIS (Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible) model in which infectious individuals were divided into two sub-groups (II and IR) according to their levels of susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. The authors concluded that the persistence of resistant bacteria within the finishers was strongly related to the transmission parameter values [13].",

However, estimation of these parameters often presents a challenge since, in many infectious diseases, only the onset of clinical symptoms or the final outcome of the disease can be observed in field conditions. Experimental transmission trials provide a useful tool for assessing infection dynamics in a controlled environment [14]. Different estimation methods have been used to analyse results from transmission experiments: maximum likelihood estimation (MLE, [15-19]), generalised linear model (GLM, [20-22]) or Becker's martingale formulae based on the final size of the epidemics [14,23,24]. The aim in these studies was to quantify the transmission of pathogenic infectious agents (viral or bacterial). However, to the best of our knowledge, none of these experimental studies focussed on the transmission of resistant bacterial strains.",

Sixty-four Large-White SPF pigs, aged seven weeks at the beginning of the experiment, were used in this study. Animals were weaned three weeks before the experiment and received non-supplemented feed. No antimicrobial treatment was administered either before the start or during the course of the experiment. Six pigs were kept as negative controls and 7 as positive inoculated controls (R5). The 51 remaining pigs were randomly assigned to 5 groups of 7 pigs (3 inoculated and 4 na\u00efve SPF pigs) and 2 groups of 8 pigs (4 inoculated and 4 na\u00efve SPF pigs). Each group was conducted separately and between-group transmission was avoided by having a solid partition between pens. Inoculations were performed orally, by successively administering 10 mL of a bacterial suspension (109 CFU/mL), on the day prior to contact with SPF pigs and on the contact-day. Contact was instigated by mixing the inoculated and na\u00efve pigs about four hours after the second inoculation.",

Transmission by low-shedders was indeed 2.5 times less efficient than that of high-shedders. The role of variations in individual infectiousness on the course of infection has been highlighted in several studies. Indeed, transmission rates could be influenced by several factors such as time-since-infection [16,17,32] or individual bacterial counts [33]. The role of super-spreaders was clearly identified for different infectious agents (e.g. MRSA [34], E. coli O157:H7 [35], Salmonella [36]). As transmission rates were found to be related to the individual bacterial counts, modelling the dynamics of drug-resistant bacteria within a pig herd would require representing the within-host dynamics of the bacterial population accounting for different susceptibility levels [37,38]. Such a modelling approach should take into account the resistance mechanisms of bacteria to targeted antibacterial agents (plasmidic or chromosomal genes) and the impact of selective pressure exerted by antimicrobial exposure. To this end, the within-host bacterial population model, accounting for the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic aspect, could be coupled with an epidemiological model representing the spread of resistance within the population. Such a model would allow the identification of key management and treatment strategies that could limit or prevent the spread of resistant strains between individuals. The present study, focussing on the transmission of an E. coli strain harbouring chromosomal resistance to fluoroquinolones, could be a cornerstone for the development of this pharmaco-epidemiological model.",
