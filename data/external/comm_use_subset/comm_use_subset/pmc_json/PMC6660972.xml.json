Detailed descriptions of the method and approach of GBD 2013 have been published elsewhere.4\u20137 Key changes in the methods from GBD 2010 are the inclusion of new data through updated systematic reviews and the contribution of unpublished data sources from various collaborators; the use of a counterfactual approach for estimating causes of diarrhoea and pneumonia; elaboration of the sequelae list to include asymptomatic states; use of more detailed nature of injury codes (N-codes); improvements to the Bayesian meta-regression method; increased simulation size for comorbidity; estimation of the prevalence of injuries by cohort; and use of a new method to estimate the distribution of mild, moderate, and severe anaemia by cause. In this systematic analysis, we use data from GBD 2013 to analyse the burden of disease and injuries in the eastern Mediterranean region specifically. We report 95% uncertainty intervals for each value in our analysis.",

When data were unavailable, we relied on our ensemble modelling techniques to generate the estimates using other available variables and the information for neighbouring countries or countries with a similar health profile in the region. We used six different modelling strategies for the 240 causes of death using our cause-of-death ensemble model for causes with sufficient information. We estimated national time series from 1950 to 2013 for gross domestic product, educational attainment, tobacco prevalence, and obesity. For mortality rates of children younger than 5 years, we analysed all survey, census, sample registration, and vital registration sources. Wherever possible, we analysed microdata from surveys and censuses with updated methods for child mortality. We corrected for bias in different sources in specific countries. For adult mortality, we identified all available vital registration data, sibling history survey data, sample registration data, and household recall of deaths. We assessed vital registration data for completeness and analysed sibling history data to account for survivor bias, zero-surviving sibships, and recall bias. We used spatiotemporal regression and Gaussian process regression to synthesise all measurements of mortality. We used UN population estimates that account for migration in our analyses. Moreover, we applied mortality shocks based on multiple reports to our analyses.",

However, Egypt, Tunisia, and Yemen have lost about 0\u00b725 years of life expectancy due to the uprising that began in 2010. When comparing observed life expectancy to expected life expectancy if no crisis had occurred, we found a large decrease in life expectancy in Libya of more than 9 years for males and 6 years for females. Conversely, a steady decrease in life expectancy was observed in Syria because of the continuing war. Therefore, between 1990 and 2013 life expectancy for Syria would have been 6 years higher than observed for males and 5 years higher for females had the crisis not happened.

Life expectancy at birth in the region increased from 65 years in 1990 to 71 years in 2013, with an annual increase of about 0\u00b726 years. However, according to our study, the situation has resulted in deteriorating health conditions for many countries that are threatening these gains and will have an impact on the region and worldwide. Hence, on the basis of our results, we call for increased investment in health in the region, and suppression of the conflicts.",
