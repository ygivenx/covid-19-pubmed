MCP-1 levels were measured over time in the cell supernatants (SN) while the cells were harvested for intracellular MCP-expression analysis at 24 hpi. Figure 1A shows a representative time course of MCP-1 levels following CHIKV infection (left panel) and an average of the maximum increase of MCP-1 scored for all donors at different time points (right panel) in the cell supernatant. CHIKV stimulated a rapid increase in MCP- production, with initial chemokine detectable levels at 6hpi. Despite some variability among donors in the MCP-1 basal expression, CHIKV infection increased the levels of MCP-1 on average 2- to 3-fold between 24\u201348 hpi. Intracellular staining of MCP-1 confirmed the increase in expression of MCP-1 following CHIKV infection (Fig. 1b). Also, and in line with previous studies37, non-replicative, UV-inactivated CHIKV (UV-CHIKV) did not trigger an increase in MCP-1 expression inferring that CHIKV replication is required for MCP-1 induction in PBMCs.",

As shown in Supplementary Fig. S1, we did not observe changes in cell viability or CD14 expression as a result of CHIKV infection. At 48 hours post infection levels of CD14 decreased in all experimental conditions (data not shown). Next, we gated the CD14+ (monocytes) vs CD14\u2212 (non-monocytes) cells and compared MCP-1 expression levels following CHIKV infection. Surprisingly, increased MCP-1 expression levels were found following active CHIKV infection in monocytes (Fig. 2a), suggesting that these cells are the source of MCP-1 production. Monocytes have been also proposed to be the cellular vehicle for virus dissemination41637 and therefore we aimed to investigate whether intracellular MCP-1 expression was restricted to only infected monocytes. Accordingly, we performed flow cytometric analysis to search for CHIKV E2 and MCP-1-positive PBMCs. Disappointingly; the frequencies of CHIKV+ monocytes were negligibly low at conditions with high MCP-1 expression. At MOIs high enough to detect convincing numbers of CHIKV+ monocytes (MOI 50 and higher, data not shown) however, we did not observe increase in MCP-1 secretion (nor expression), signifying that infection at such high MOI changes cytokine pattern considerably39.",

            "text": "To verify that CD14+ cells are indeed the main source of MCP-1 during CHIKV infection in PBMCs, we compared it to the levels of MCP-1 secreted by monocytes and monocyte-depleted PBMCs (Mo\u0394PBMCs) from the corresponding donors (Fig. 2b). Counterintuitively however, no MCP-1 stimulation was observed upon infection of monocytes (Fig. 2b) at any MOI tested (Supplementary Fig. S2). Nonetheless, depletion of monocytes (on average 96% CD14+ cells was depleted) abrogated CHIKV-mediated secretion of the chemokine (Fig. 2b). Incubation of non-infected monocytes with the SN of infected Mo\u0394PBMCs also did not stimulate MCP-1 production (not depicted), confirming that infection of monocytes was imperative to lead to the production of this chemokine. Addition of IL-6, used as a positive control, stimulated MCP-1 production in all cell preparations (Fig. 2c), indicating that positive selection did not affect the capacity of the cells to produce MCP-1 and was not the reason for the lack of MCP-1 secretion by infected monocytes. Thus far, these results implied that presence of other leukocytes was crucial for the chemokine production in the context of CHIKV infection. To test this, infected monocytes were cultured in the presence or absence of non-infected or infected Mo\u0394PBMCs in a transwell co-culture system. In agreement with the data presented in Fig. 2b, neither monocytes nor Mo\u0394PBMCs secreted MCP-1 upon CHIKV infection (Supplementary Fig. S3). In contrast, when infected monocytes could exchange soluble factors with other leukocytes, a significant increase (p < 0.5) in MCP-1production was observed (Fig. 2d left panel). In effect, the increase in the chemokine levels was comparable to that found in the infected PBMCs of the corresponding donors (Fig. 2d right panel), although the additive role of the cell-to cell contact cannot be excluded. Notably, the increase of MCP-1 was observed regardless of whether Mo\u0394PBMCs were exposed to the virus or not. Altogether, these data suggest that CHIKV infection of monocytes triggers a communication loop with other leukocytes that ultimately leads to MCP-1 upregulation and production in monocytes.",

            "text": "Next, we sought to disclose the soluble factor involved in MCP-1 upregulation. It has been proposed that IFN type I can modulate MCP-1 secretion in a concentration- dependent manner2340. Type I IFNs are also readily produced in course of CHIKV infection37. Analysis of SN of PBMCs and monocytes revealed that CHIKV infection triggers MOI-dependent production of IFN\u03b2 but not that of IFN\u03b1 (Supplementary Figs S4 and S5). Therefore, we hypothesized that IFN\u03b2 stimulation via IFN\u03b1\u03b2 receptor (IFNAR) played a role in CHIKV infection mediated MCP-1 production in PBMCs. Indeed, pre-incubation of these cells with \u03b1IFNAR1/2 antibody abolished CHIKV-mediated MCP-1 production (Fig. 3a). A similar effect was achieved when JAK1/2-STAT signalling downstream of IFNAR was inhibited by Ruxolitinib (Rux) during CHIKV infection and/or IFN\u03b2 stimulation (Fig. 3b). Together, these results strongly suggest that IFN\u03b2-mediated signalling is responsible for the MCP-1 production in course of the infection. To substantiate the role of IFN\u03b2 in the communication between monocytes and other leukocytes, we next tested whether stimulation of Mo\u0394PBMCs with IFN\u03b2 alone for 4 hours prior to their co-culture with monocytes could induce MCP-1 secretion in monocytes. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 3c, addition of IFN\u03b2-pre-treated Mo\u0394PBMCs (washed cells) to monocyte monoculture increased levels of the chemokine after 24 hours of co-culture. As expected, stimulation of Mo\u0394PBMCs with IFN\u03b2 did not result in MCP-1 production in the absence of monocytes. In summary, we propose a model of IFN\u03b2-driven communication of infected monocytes with other leukocytes that is essential for MCP-1 secretion upon CHIKV infection in PBMCs (Fig. 4).",

This is in line with the study by Pattison and colleagues, which showed IFN\u03b2 is required to sustain MCP-1 production in response to TLR3 activation in bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs)24. Also, in monocytes IFN\u03b2 can stimulate MCP-1 production23. Yet, despite the detectable levels of IFN\u03b2 following CHIKV infection of monocytes at high MOI (Supplementary Fig. S5), we found no MCP-1 production in these cells, which might indicate that the autocrine effect of IFN\u03b2 was blocked during CHIKV infection. This phenomenon could, at least in part, be explained by the fact that CHIKV impedes the ability of infected cells to respond to type I interferon by preventing IFN-induced gene expression44. It remains to be seen why non-infected, bystander monocytes did not secrete MCP-1.",

In fact, IFN\u03b2-stimulated Mo\u0394PBMCs were able to trigger MCP-1 production in monocytes. Hence, MCP-1 secretion was regulated by yet an unknown soluble factor or factors triggered downstream of IFNAR signalling. MCP-1 levels are known to be controlled by several cytokines including, TNF-\u03b1, IL-10, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-621232545. Indeed, in our experiments, addition of IL-6 but not CHIKV infection stimulated MCP-1 production in monocytes. This suggests that IL-6 was either not produced by monocytes upon infection, or it was present in amounts insufficient to trigger MCP-1 amplification loop46. In fact, lack of IL-6 (and MCP-1) production in CHIKV-infected monocytes, despite its presence in in vitro infected whole blood samples, was also reported by Her and colleagues37. We therefore deduced that IL-6 is one of the IFN\u03b2-stimulated cytokines responsible for MCP-1 production, and that it is produced by cells other than monocytes. Counterintuitively however, treatment of PBMCs with Ruxolitinib prior to addition of IFN\u03b2, increased the levels of IL-6 (Ruiz Silva, unpublished) while abolishing MCP-1 production completely. Our ongoing studies focus at the disclosure of the identity and the source of IFN\u03b2-stimulated soluble mediator(s) that govern the MCP-1 upregulation in monocytes upon CHIKV infection in PBMCs.",

Here we showed for the first time that despite the apparent correlation between MCP-1 and CHIKV titre early in infection41736, this chemokine does not play a direct role in CHIKV replication. Yet, it is important to note that in our experimental set up no influx of new target cells was possible. Thus, we cannot rule out a scenario, in which increased levels of MCP-1 in the circulatory system result in an augmented recruitment of monocytes from bone marrow and thereby in an increased pool of cells susceptible to infection294849. Indeed, in mice, inhibition of MCP- 1 with bindarit led to significantly reduced titre of CHIKV at the site of infection34. On the other hand, it has been previously suggested that IFN\u03b2-stimulated increase of MCP-1 can contribute to the MCP-1-mediated inhibition of the CCR2 expression and thereby reduce the responsiveness of monocytes to this chemokine50. Future research should evaluate whether chemokine and migration receptors are differentially regulated in CHIKV infected vs bystander cells.",
