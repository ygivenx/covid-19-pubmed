            "text": "The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection is a recent and fatal disease, detected first in Saudi Arabia, where the majority of cases have so far occurred. Subsequently, it spread through the Arabian Peninsula and into neighbouring Middle Eastern countries before it became a global concern, reaching as far as the Korean Peninsula. By February 2018, its presence was detected in 27 countries worldwide, with 2144 recorded cases, out of which 750 resulted in death [1]. MERS-CoV is a contagious disease caused by C lineage of \u03b2-coronavirus. The infection can occur either through exposure with an infected animal or human [2]. Dromedary camels are believed to have been the carrier of MERS-CoV for decades as camels of the Middle Eastern region appear to be the only zoonotic host able to transmit infection to humans [3]. There is evidence of super spreading of infection (i.e., a single patient infects a disproportionate number of contacts) in MERS-CoV, and therefore, healthcare workers who provide support to infected patients are particularly vulnerable [4]. The disease exhibits a wide range of presentations at diagnosis, e.g., from no symptoms to subtle signs of pneumonia to multi-organ failure, and has the capacity to progress rapidly to cause death [5, 6]. At present, there is no effective vaccine available to prevent this fatal infection [1].",

            "text": "There have been both animal and human studies on treatment efficacy for MERS-CoV infection. A common form of treatment is antiviral drugs that target specific parts of the S protein in MERS-CoV. These are known as anti-MERS-CoV neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), anti-dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) mAbs, peptidic fusion inhibitors, siRNA, and others [7]. MERS-CoV binds with DPP4, which is found on the surface of cells in the lungs and kidneys. Protein-targeting mAbs in mice were not reported to have given in vivo protection from MERS-CoV; nevertheless, mAbs variants, including mersmab1, 2E6 and 4C2, were found to prevent entry into DPP4 cells and effectively neutralise live MERS-CoV infection in mice [8, 9]. DPP4 antagonists target the receptor-binding domain (RBD), competing with and inhibiting MERS-CoV infection. The DPP4 antagonists used in ferrets were found to be highly protective against MERS-CoV entry [10]. Multiple RBD-mAbs were found to elicit protective and therapeutic abilities against MERS-CoV infectivity in humanised DPP4 mice and other variants, as well as in rhesus monkeys [8, 11\u201313].",

In one study, multiple regimens were tested including mycophenolate mofetil, Interferon alpha and beta with or without ribavirin combination, and hydrocortisone [15]. Similarly, the efficacy of Interferon-beta with lopinavir-ritonavir has been the focus of an on-going clinical trial [16]. The most widely tested regimen, however, has been Ribavirin in combination with Interferon. This regimen has been found effective in reducing the virus replication \u2018in vitro\u2019 [17]. It has also modulated the host response and improved the clinical outcome in animal experiments [18].",

Small sample sizes (5, 14, 20, and 31) in some of the included studies likely contributed in the variation of the morality estimate [6, 20, 21, 29]. Additionally, the mortality rate was influenced by the patients\u2019 demography (e.g., age), physical conditions at admission (e.g., fever, shock, organ failure etc.), pre-existing diseases such diabetes or hypertension, or choice of treatment [26, 30].",

The accuracy of data for any patient referred to BCH was crosschecked with the patient\u2019s record from the original hospital. A total of 63 patients met the eligibility criteria and are the focus of this report. Out of 63, 43 patients\u2019 data came from the Department of Archives at BCH; the remaining 20 came from the Department of Infection Control (from discharge summaries) at BCH since they had not yet been archived (Fig. 1). Some key information (temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate) was missing from patients\u2019 records at Infection Control. All acquired data were crosschecked with their respective patient file numbers by two co-authors to ensure there was no data duplication.\n",

We calculated hospital mortality as the number of dead patients over the total number of patients admitted with a MERS-CoV diagnosis. We compared the hospital mortality between patients who did and did not receive the combination therapy. The observed mortality difference, the p-value of the test, and the sample size were used in the power calculation (power = 69%). In addition, we compared demographics, vital signs, MERS-CoV-associated conditions on admission, the number of comorbid conditions on admission, and duration of hospital stay between those who were alive and those who were dead at hospital discharge. We used Chi-square and t-test respectively for comparison of categorical and continuous variables. Finally, we used a binary multiple logistic regression model to identify correlates of hospital mortality (yes, no). We considered age, sex, admission status, and number of chronic diseases for inclusion in the model. For model robustness and ease of interpretation, we made the number of chronic diseases variable binary (no, yes). Similarly, we added the one patient who presented with abdominal pain and diarrhoea to the group with pneumonia and ARDS. We expressed the associations with odds ratio and their associated 95% confidence interval and checked model adequacy with Hosmer-Lemeshow Goodness of fit statistic.",

This could possibly explain some of the non-significant associations that we have found (e.g., sex, number of chronic conditions). We had to rely on paper-based patient records for data abstraction; some handwriting was not legible, and it is known that handwritten records are more prone to error than electronic data. In addition, the 20 patient files that were not part of the archive were very brief, and only a certain amount of information from them was usable. We did not follow patients beyond their discharge from the hospitals; hence, we could not comment on their long-term prognosis, which one study did [6]. Unlike a few other studies [21, 22], our patients almost exclusively received treatment with one regimen, i.e., Ribavirin and Interferon. The lack of a reference group (i.e., patients who received other regimens) prevented us from determining the true efficacy of this combination therapy. Finally, our study included patients 35 years or older, and therefore, we are unable to comment on the clinical outcomes in children or adolescents with MERS-CoV infection.",
