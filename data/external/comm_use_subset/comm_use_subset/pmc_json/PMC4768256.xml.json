To examine the effects of conserved positively charged residues and the Y148 residue in the RNA-binding groove of NP, the amino acid residues Y148, R150, R152, R156, R174, R175, K184, R195, R199, R213, R214, R221, and R236 were respectively replaced with alanine (Fig. 1). Each form of NP was expressed and purified. Subsequently, SPR analysis was employed to determine the interactions between the full-length NPs and RNA. The repeated intergenic sequence of influenza virus, 5\u2032-bio(UCCAAAC)4-3\u2032, was used as a probe in the SPR experiments. The dissociation constants, KD (kd/ka), for the various NP and RNA complexes were obtained from kinetic analyses of SPR experiments (Fig. 2). The ka values for RNA binding to R214A and R236A were similar to that for WT, whereas Y148A, R150A, R152A, R156A, R174A, R175A, K184A, R195A, R199A, R213A, and R221A had smaller ka values than that of WT, suggesting these NP residues are likely important for RNA recognition and interaction. The kd values for RNA binding to all mutants were larger than that of WT, and the Y148A mutant had the largest kd value (5 fold that of WT), indicating the side chain of Y148 increase RNA residence times in NP (Table 1). In addition to K184A, R214A, and R236A, the dissociation constants for RNA binding to Y148A, R150A, R152A, R156A, R174A, R175A, R195A, R199A, R213A, and R221A ranged from 4.5 \u00d7 10\u20138 M to 15 \u00d7 10\u20138 M and were much larger than those for WT (Fig. 2A), implying that these residues contribute more to RNA binding. Previously, Li et al. reported that influenza A virus with NP mutations in Y148, R150, R152, R156, R174, R175, R195, R199, R213, and R221 were significantly attenuated16. These biological properties of mutant viruses corroborate our observations at the biochemical level.",

To explore the role of Y148 in the interactions between H1N1-NP and RNA, the Y148 residue in the full-length NP was replaced by amino acids with various characteristics (e.g., F, R, S, and A) via site-directed mutagenesis. SPR analyses were then performed to measure the binding affinities between RNA and the purified H1N1-NP (WT and five mutants). Traces from the SPR experiments show the binding capacity of RNA to the WT and mutant NPs. Comparison of the binding capacities of these proteins (Fig. 3A) showed that the binding capacity was decreased in the following order: WT > Y148F > Y148S ~ Y148R > Y148A. These results emphasize the importance of the involvement of Y148 in stacking interactions between the NP and RNA.",

The WT NP showed a thermal denaturation midpoint at 73.5 \u00b0C as determined by CD (Table 2). However, as temperature increases, the mutant NPs unfold more rapidly than the WT NP does, as evidenced by a lower Tm of approximately 0.7 to 6.2 \u00b0C (from 67.3\u201372.8 \u00b0C), indicating that Y148 contributes significantly to the structural stability of the NP.

Thus, a virtual screening was performed to target the Y148 of NP. To identify compounds that might interact with the RNA-binding site of NP at Y148, we used the LIBDOCK docking program to evaluate the candidate ligands binding to NP. In the current study, the potential hits with docking scores over 90 were analyzed based on their docking results. We selected seven candidate ligands with high scores (H1 to H7) for the functional assay based on the energy calculated by molecular docking (Table S1). They all contain an aromatic core to stack onto Y148 of the NP. In addition, the aromatic core contains hydrogen bond\u2013forming moieties to mediate the specific interactions with the NP. More importantly, among the 40 potential hits, these seven compounds were readily available. Because our result reported that Y148 is important for NP stability and folding, the top hits were assayed in an in vitro drug-induced fluorescence change experiment. The purified recombinant NP was treated with top hits from the in-house compound collection, then the change of tryptophan fluorescence caused by the compound was used to reflect the NP-drug interaction22. The four compounds that significantly decreased the NP fluorescence by more than 10% were selected for further characterization (Fig. 5A).",

            "text": "NP possesses multiple RNA binding sites. Compound that targets Y148 in the local area can\u2019t inhibit the binding affinity between RNA and NP absolutely. Due to this reason, we determined the binding affinity in the presence of compounds under saturation conditions at protein: compound ratio of 1:20. We further studied the effects of the four compounds (H1, H3, H5, and H7) on the RNA-binding capacity of NP by SPR experiments. Only H7 decreased the RNA-binding capacity of NP by more than 10% (Fig. 5B). We also evaluated the kinetic association (ka) and dissociation constants (kd), respectively, and the dissociation rate constant (KD) to determine the effects of these four compounds on the RNA-binding affinity toward NP. In the presence of compounds under saturation conditions, the affinity of NP bound to RNA (Fig. 6A) for H7 (KD = 19.3 nM) was higher than those for the other compounds. The NP exhibited weaker RNA binding in the presence of H7, with a 2-fold increase in the dissociation constant. The KD values for H1, H3, and H5 were 10.4, 9.7, and 11.7 nM, respectively, which are at the same level as the KD without drug (Table 3). Figure 5A shows that the NP fluorescence decreased with increasing H7 concentration, suggesting that this decrease reflected the interaction of NP molecules with H7; this result was derived by a Hill plot analysis. Assuming that the amount of quenched fluorescence corresponds to the fraction of NP bound to H7, fitting of the binding curve (Fig. 6B) resulted in an unambiguous 1:1 stoichiometry for the interaction between H7 and NP with a Kd of 1.22 \u00d7 10\u20136 M. Based on the docking results of NP bound to H7, the methoxyphenyl on the H7 participates in stacking interactions with the Tyr148 side chains. Hydrogen bonds were also formed between R150 and H7 (Fig. 6C). We have analyzed the proposed interactions using in Y148 and R150 mutants. However, we observed that there is relatively low FL change in Y148 and R150 mutants upon addition of H7 by fluorescence titration assay, compared to the wild type, suggesting that H7 inhibits the RNA-binding activity of NP by directly interacting with Y148 and R150 (Figure S3).",

Different concentrations of H7 were added to A549 cells after virus infection (T2: 2 h after infection), and culture supernatants were collected to determine the viral RNA after one viral replication cycle. The matrix protein 1 (M1) viral RNA expression levels during replication were normalized based on the vehicle control (same volume of DMSO added at T2). As shown in Fig. 7A, upon H7 treatment at 15\u03bcM, the M1 viral RNA synthesis in the influenza virus\u2013infected cells was reduced by 75% at T2. When the infected cells were treated with 30 \u03bcM H7, a similar phenomenon was observed. H7 dose-dependently reduced the viral RNA synthesis during the later steps of the viral cycle after T2. This assay further demonstrated that H7 inhibited influenza virus replication, with an IC50 (inhibition concentration at which viral synthesis was reduced by 50%) of 10.9 \u03bcM.",

Using SPR, we explored the effect of single amino acid substitution at 13 hot spots on the surface of the groove between the head and body domains on the RNA-associated properties of NP, including the kinetic behavior of NP bound to RNA, by evaluating the SPR association and dissociation phases. The association phase mainly reflects the entry of RNA into the NP groove, whereas the dissociation phase measures the hydrogen bonding environment within the groove that accommodates the RNA molecules. The structure of the full-length N protein should be taken into consideration in our studies. Moreover, in gel filtration we obtained and checked the uniformity of the purified construct NP. In addition, in the SPR experiment we designed the 28nt in length RNA oligomer, and the length of RNA oligomer can be bound by one protein molecule. During data analysis, we fit the SPR sensorgram of the wild and mutant NP bound to RNA by using 1:1 Langmuir model. We showed that the dissociation rate of NP from the single-stranded RNA increased in all 13 mutants, while the presence of Y148A, R150A, R152A, R156A, R174A, R175A, R195A, R199A, R213A, and R221A mutants significantly decreased the rates of association between NP and RNA, suggesting these 10 residues play a crucial role in RNA binding. Interestingly, the Kd values of WT, R184A, R214A, and R236A were similar, a finding that is consistent with previous studies showing that the single amino acid substitutions at R184A, R214A, or R236A had no effect on viral-genome replication and transcription16. To characterize the interaction of Y148 with RNA, tyrosine was mutated to phenylalanine, serine, and arginine. The association rates (ka) for RNA binding to most of the mutants was decreased significantly, except that the Y148R mutant is similar to that for WT, suggesting that Y148R may participate in RNA-binding of NPs via electrostatic interactions.",

            "text": "Current antiviral drugs developed to treat influenza virus infections primarily target the viral M2 channel and neuraminidase. However, the use of M2 inhibitors, such as amantadine and rimantadine, has been limited by the propensity of these drugs to cause central nervous system side effects and the rapidly increased number of drug-resistant viral strains2728. The neuraminidase inhibitors (zanamivir and oseltamivir) are commonly employed to treat influenza virus infections with minimal adverse effects29. Yet, recent studies have reported that the influenza virus has started to develop resistance to zanamivir and oseltamivir30. Therefore, novel antiviral strategies are required to combat the drug-resistant influenza viruses. The influenza virus NP is a multifunctional RNA-binding protein that is associated with genome and antigenome RNA, and it is necessary for viral RNA transcription and replication31. Recent studies suggest that NP represents a potential anti-influenza drug target because of its many crucial functions during the viral life cycle. On the other hands, there are no NP homologous proteins in the cell. Antiviral inhibitors targeting NP may not act nonspecifically on proteins in the cell, causing host cell toxicity and severe side effects. Two strategies to inhibit oligomeric NP function have been reported. The first strategy is to impair normal NP function by interfering with monomer\u2013oligomer equilibrium through either enhancement or inhibition of its oligomerization32. Kao et al. identified a small-molecule compound called nucleozin that can trigger oligomeric NP aggregates and inhibit their nuclear entry18. In addition, Su et al. identified several nucleozin analogues that can inhibit the replication of the influenza virus in MDCK cells by inducing the severe aggregation of NP molecules and by preventing RNP formation during the production of viral particles33. Gerritz et al. discovered a series of influenza replication inhibitors that interfere with NP-dependent processes via formation of higher-order NP oligomers34. Shen et al. reported that some small molecules targeting E339\u2026R416 from virtual screening were shown to disrupt the formation of NP trimers and inhibit replication of WT and nucleozin-resistant strains35. The second strategy is to target the RNA-binding site, which contains several conserved residues2125. Lejal et al. discovered naproxen, which interferes with the RNA-binding activity of the influenza virus NP and inhibits viral titers25. Mutation of conserved residues in the RNA-binding groove of the influenza virus NP led to a significant decrease in its RNA-binding affinity and subsequent decrease in viral replication16. According to the protein sequence alignment, the 498-aa NP is highly conserved among all strains of influenza viruses. Because the location of the NP ligand-binding site is highly conserved among influenza viruses, the RNA-binding groove of NP would be a valid target for broad-spectrum antiviral drugs through interference with the RNA-binding activity of the NP. Competitive binders of NP may be employed to combat all strains of influenza virus, including H3N2, H5N1, and influenza B.",

Docking results suggest that several hits can bind to Y148 of the NP-NTD\u2019s groove using virtual screening. Using fluorescence titration and an SPR assay of the NPs, we identified one potential natural compound, curcumin (H7), that targets Y148 of influenza virus NP and potently interferes with its RNA-binding activity. We also found that H7 could inhibit influenza virus replication and the efficacy of H7 is relatively diverse. Previous studies demonstrated that curcumin exist no or low cytotoxicity in normal cells36. Importantly, the safety, tolerability, and nontoxicity of curcumin at high doses have been well established by human clinical trials. Therefore, H7 is an ideal point in designing a new class of inhibitors to interfere with RNA-binding activity of NP. Here, we formulated two general guidelines for developing influenza virus NP-Y148 targeting agents. First, a polycyclic aromatic core is required to enable \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking with the tyrosine residues in the NP groove. Second, introducing hydrogen bond\u2013forming moieties to the aromatic core would mediate the specific interactions with the NP. Our findings will be useful for the development of new drugs to disrupt the interactions between RNA and influenza viral NPs.",

The PCR products were digested with NdeI and XhoI, and the DNA fragments were cloned into pET21b (Novagen) using T4 ligase (New England Biolabs). DH5\u03b1 competent cells that were transformed with the resultant plasmid were grown in culture. Protein expression was induced by supplementing the culture media with 1 mM IPTG, followed by incubation at 10 \u00b0C for 24 h. After the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation (6000 \u00d7 g for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C), the bacterial pellets were lysed with lysis buffer in the presence of RNase (50 mM Tris-buffered solution [pH 7.5], 100 mM NaCl, 15 mM imidazole). The soluble proteins were isolated from the supernatant following centrifugation (13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C) to remove the precipitate. The recombinant NPs carrying an N-terminal 6\u00d7His-tag were purified using a Ni-NTA column (Novagen) with an elution gradient that ranged from 15 to 300 mM imidazole. The pure fractions were collected and dialyzed against the buffer that lacked imidazole. Purified NPs (with greater than 95% purity) were analyzed by gel filtration with Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare) and Coomassie blue staining (Figure S1A). The protein concentrations were determined with the Bradford method using Bio-Rad protein assay reagents.",
