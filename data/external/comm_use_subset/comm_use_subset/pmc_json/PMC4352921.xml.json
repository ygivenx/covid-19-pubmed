Results from the dynamic MRI perfusion function index, Micro-CT-based angiography, and histomorphometry of marrow circulation consistently demonstrated that anti-VEGF reduced both neovascularization and permeability, whereas a Src inhibitor did not reduce neovascularization but did reduce permeability. In addition, immunoblotting for phosphorylated Src also demonstrated significantly decreased Src phospho-Y418 levels in the Src-Inhibition, Anti-VEGF and Supplement & Inhibition Groups at each post-administration time point. Taken together, these results suggest that uncontrolled VEGF-Src signaling underlies the observed continuous increase in vascular permeability during inadequate repair of steroid-associated osteonecrosis, which is consistent with a recent consensus that normal vascular turnover requires precise spatiotemporal control of VEGF expression28. Accordingly, it encourages use of a selective blockade strategy of Src signaling for both maintaining VEGF-mediated angiogenesis and abolishing VEGF-mediated permeability to facilitate repair.",

In contrast, VEGF promoted destructive repair as evidenced by 100% incidence of destructive repair and moderately left shifted size distribution curve of trabecular thickness in VEGF-Supplement Group compared to the Control. VEGF is a chemoattractant for osteoclasts to induce osteoclastogenesis in vitro and in vivo through a matrix metalloprotease 9\u2013dependent mechanism, which is similar to signaling pathways involving receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL)13293031. These data suggest a potential link between uncontrolled VEGF signaling and destructive repair of steroid-associated osteonecrotic lesions for testing a therapeutic strategy by blocking uncontrolled VEGF signaling, which not only challenges the traditionally held opinion that enhanced VEGF signaling might augment bone repair, but also raises an emerging concept that uncontrolled VEGF signaling could induce destructive repair when MSCP is at a continuously low level.",

This could be explained by the significantly reduced vascular permeability caused by the Src inhibitor to avoid diverting blood away from the lesion center towards its periphery and accordingly facilitating delivery of oxygen and nutrients to local lesions for tissue reconstructional repair32. These results also suggest a potential causal relationship between continuous hyperpermeability and inactive reparative osteogenesis for testing a therapeutic strategy via blockade of uncontrolled Src signaling.",

Dr. Weis et al. used it to block Src Y418 phosphorylation by intravenous injection in mice9. Dr.Zan et al. injected PP1 in to a focal cerebral ischemia rat model, and demonstrated that PP1 effectively decreased Src Y418 phosphorylation level and reduced the vascular permeability in the rat brain34. In the present study, PP1 was intravenously administrated at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg according to dose conversion principle among different animals3536, which corresponded to the effective dose for anti-permeability in previous two studies. The efficacy of systemic administration of PP1 was also verified in this study, as evidenced by significantly decreased phosphorylated Src expression in Src-Inhibition Group and Supplement & Inhibition Group.",

All experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Experiment Ethics Committee of Institute for Advancing Translational Medicine in Bone & Joint Diseases in Hong Kong Baptist University (Ref No.TMBJ/12/NR). The methods were carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines and the surgical operation was offcially approved by Hong Kong government (Ref No. (12\u201330) in DH/HA&P/8/2/6 Pt.2). Based on our established protocol for inducing steroid-associated osteonecrosis development7242526, all the rabbits were intravenously injected once with 10 \u03bcg/kg body weight of lipopolysaccharide (Escherichia coli 0111:B4, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) on day 0. After 24 hours, three injections of 20 mg/kg body weight of methylprednisolone (Pharmacia & Upjohn, USA) were given intramuscularly at a 24-hour interval. At 0 (pre-induction/baseline) and 1 week after induction, bone marrow aspiration from iliac crest was conducted to determine size of marrow stem cell pool (SI-MSCP) in hematopoietic and mesenchymal compartment according to our published protocol7. At 2 weeks after induction, 121 rabbits with a decrease of at least 70% in SI-MSCP of both mesenchymal and hematopoietic compartment were identified as high riskers for progress to destructive repair within osteonecrotic lesions according to the published findings7. The selected rabbits were systemically administrated by intravenous injection with either Anti-VEGF antibody (recombinant humanized monoclonal anti-VEGF at 33 mg/kg/two weeks, Anti-VEGF Group, n = 23) or VEGF (recombinant human VEGF at 0.05 mg/kg/two weeks, VEGF-Supplement Group, n = 23) or Src inhibitor (PP1, selective inhibitor of Src activity with IC50 of 170 nM, 0.3 mg/kg/two weeks), Src-Inhibition Group, n = 23) or a combination of VEGF and Src inhibitor (recombinant human VEGF at 0.05 mg/kg/two weeks and Src inhibitor PP1 at 0.3 mg/kg/two weeks, Supplement & Inhibition Group, n = 23) and control vehicle (Saline, Control Group, n = 23) for 4 weeks. Six rabbits were sacrificed as baseline before administration. The sample size in each group was calculated according to our published paper7. At 0, 2 and 4 weeks after administration, in vivo dynamic MRI was performed on proximal femora for vascularization index and permeability index, respectively. After finishing dynamic MRI scan, euthanasia was also executed at 2 (n = 8) and 4 (n = 15) weeks after administration in each group. Bilateral proximal femora were dissected after sacrifice for the following evaluation on intraosseous vasculature, including three-dimensional angiography by micro-CT and two-dimensional histomorphometry of marrow circulation by optical microscopy. Repair pattern of osteonecrotic lesions was both qualitatively classified by histopathology and quantificationally differentiated by micro-CT. Local phosphorylated Src protein expression was quantified by immunoblotting.",

            "text": "Histomorphometry of Marrow Circulation: For micro-vessel density (MVD), fifteen successive hematoxylin and eosin\u2013stained 6-\u03bcm-thick sections from every decalcified sample were scanned initially at low magnification and then at high magnification to identify vascular \u2018hot-spots\u20194445 using the Optical Microscope imaging system (Zeiss). Selection of the hot-spot has been adopted as a standard procedure for angiogenesis studies in both solid neoplasms and for hematological oncology46. It is thought that such areas of increased concentration of micro-vessels may represent the emergence of a neoplastic clone with a higher angiogenic potential47. For each countable micro-vessel, an outline was traced to calculate the total count of micro-vessels per total examined optical fields in those successive sections from bilateral decalcified femoral samples in one rabbit (Micro-vessel Density) using image analysis software (ImageJ 1.32j, NIH, USA). For edema area (EA), the above histological sections were scanned to identify the interstitial marrow edema zone by OM. For each section, four randomly selected fields (up, down, left, right) were examined. The marrow edema zone was automatically traced by thresholding using ImageJ 1.32j24. The total area of the edema zone per total examined optical field area in those successive sections from bilateral decalcified femoral samples (Edema Area) in one rabbit were calculated accordingly. For size distribution of leakage particles, the above sections were examined with OM to identify leakage particles in the region corresponding to the scanned volume of interest during the above-mentioned Micro-CT-based micro-angiography. An easily distinguished black radiopaque particle (perfused angiographic substance) outside of a blood vessel was defined as a leakage particle. For each leakage particle, the outline was manually traced to quantify its area and perimeter using ImageJ 1.32j. Based on the stereology principle in bone histomorphometry48, leakage particle size was calculated as follows: Thickness = 2000/1.199 \u00d7 (Area/Perimeter). A histogram to display the size distribution of all the leakage particles in those successive sections from bilateral decalcified femoral samples in one rabbit was generated using Excel 2007 (Microsoft, USA).",
