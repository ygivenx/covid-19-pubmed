            "text": "Following a large outbreak around 2010, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has emerged as an eminent threat in the swine industry worldwide [1, 2]. Although PEDV can infect pigs of all ages, mortality in infected piglets aged below one week is especially high and could reach 100%. A few strategies have been employed to control PED outbreaks. For instance, feedback of PEDV infected materials to sows can induce lactogenic immunity for piglets [3, 4]. Despite being widely adopted in farms, this strategy poses serious safety concerns as contamination of other pathogens, dosage and virulence are often not well-controlled [3, 4]. Inactivated vaccines have higher safety measures but usually give less robust protection. Especially in Asian countries, antigenic variations between emerging strains (post-2010) and classical strains may have led to failure of traditional attenuated vaccines [3, 5]. These problems urgently call for updated effective PEDV vaccines. Reverse genetics technology can immensely help with creating vaccine seeds that are attenuated and carry matching antigens and bypassing laborious and time-consuming process of tissue culture adaptation. Appropriate cell culture platforms are also critical for virus production at an industrial scale. Although Vero or Vero E6 cells are widely used to propagate PEDV at the moment, improvements in titers and replication kinetics are desirable. Both better understanding of PEDV replication and pathogenesis from basic research and improvement in technologies such as reverse genetics for generation of vaccine candidates and engineered cell lines suitable for efficient propagation of selected candidates could make immense contribution to PEDV vaccine development.",

Its genome comprises two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) encoding two polyproteins, ORF1a and ORF1ab, and five other ORFs encoding five proteins: spike (S), ORF3, envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid (N) [7]. PEDV entry is mediated by S protein. Once inside the cells, ORF1 and ORF1ab are translated by host ribosomes and cleaved by viral proteases into non-structural proteins which are involved in subsequent viral RNA transcription and replication [8, 9]. Structural proteins are then produced, and viral assembly commences at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi complexes where the viral genome encapsidated by multimers of N is packaged with viral structural proteins into virions [10, 11].",

Several lines of evidence suggest that N is required for optimal CoV RNA transcription and/or replication. First, CoV N proteins may act as RNA chaperones [12, 13]. Second, presence of N enhances recovery of several CoVs from infectious RNA, implying early roles of N during RNA synthesis [14, 15]. Third, for murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV), N is found to co-localize and/or interact with replicase components, possibly tethering viral RNA to the replicase complex for efficient viral RNA production [16, 17]. For transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), N is not essential for RNA replication but is required for efficient transcription [13]. Roles of PEDV N during viral RNA synthesis have not been as extensively studied but are assumed to be similar.",

Particularly for PEDV, N has been reported to induce ER stress [18]. Through interaction with cellular protein nucleophosmin, PEDV N was able to protect cells from induced apoptosis [19]. PEDV N has been shown to inhibit interferon-\u03b2 (IFN-\u03b2) production and interferon-stimulating gene (ISG) expression via suppression of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) [20]. In our previous work, we demonstrated that, in some PEDV strains, N is an unusual substrate of PEDV 3C-like protease (3Cpro). Notably, we observed growth retardation of a cell culture-adapted PEDV-AVCT12 strain carrying the cleavage-resistant mutation in its nucleocapsid gene [21]. These data together suggest layers of complexity and multiple roles that PEDV N might be involved during the course of PEDV infection and consequently affect PEDV growth kinetics.",

Briefly, HEK293T cells were transfected with lentiviral vectors in combination with a packaging plasmid (pCMV-\u0394R8.91 encoding the packaging proteins Gag-Pol, Rev, Tat) and an envelope expression plasmid (pMD.G encoding the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein). Viral supernatant was harvested at 48 h and filtered through a 0.45 \u03bcm filter. Subsequently, the lentiviruses were transduced into Vero E6 cells. Single clones of Vero E6 cells expressing PEDV N were identified and selected for clonal expansion. Cell proliferation and viability were followed in a resazurin-based assay [24]. Briefly, Vero E6 and Vero E6-N cells were seeded at 2x104 cells/well in 96-well plates and left to grow at 37 \u00baC with 5% CO2. At indicated time after seeding, 3.125 \u03bcg resazurin was added to each well, and the plates were then incubated at 37 \u00baC for 6 h. Fluorescence signal is measured using SpectraMax M5 multi- detection microplate reader (Molecular Devices, USA) at the excitation and emission wavelengths of 530 nm and 590 nm.

The reverse genetics system for PEDV established in our laboratory did not include an extraneous N-expressing plasmid [22]. However, capped PEDV N transcripts were included during recovery of PEDV PC22A from in vitro-transcribed full-length PEDV RNA [30]. The effect of augmented PEDV N expression during in vitro recovery in the bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-based system has not been documented. To test this, we co-transfected HEK 293T cells with a pCAGGS plasmid expressing either PEDV N (WT), PEDV N-L381P or no protein (vec) together with pPEDV-mCh, the infectious clone for PEDV-AVCT12-mCherry, and subsequently detected the recovered progenies in Vero E6 cells. This infectious clone contains the mCherry coding sequence in place of ORF3 [22], therefore allowing us to easily follow PEDV replication by fluorescence detection. The reason we chose to investigate both of these PEDV N variants was based on our previous work on 3Cpro-induced PEDV N processing. We noticed that recovery from infectious clone and growth kinetics of the laboratory-adapted PEDV carrying 3Cpro-sensitive N (WT) in cell culture were consistently more efficient than the mutant carrying 3Cpro-resistant N (L381P) [21]. Therefore, we suspected that molecular difference in PEDV N protein might have contributed to efficiencies in viral recovery and growth.",

Due to the low numbers of reverse genetics-derived particles, we amplified the viral progenies by passaging once in Vero E6 cells. We qualitatively monitored viral replication by the extent of mCherry expression and syncytium formation and quantified the released PEDV particles at 48 h by RT-qPCR. PEDV N expression during the rescue phase significantly enhanced virus replication as reflected by exhaustive mCherry-positive syncytia and increased the number of PEDV-AVCT12-mCherry viral progenies by three orders of magnitude (Fig 1B). Interestingly, expression of N-L381P from the plasmid also increased the numbers of the viral progenies compared to the negative control, but the effect was not as large as that observed with the wild-type PEDV N (Fig 1B). We next tested rescues of PEDV-AVCT12-mCherry carrying the L381P mutation in its N gene in the presence of absence of PEDV N expression. Consistent with previous observations, reverse genetics rescue of PEDV-AVCT12N.L381P-mCherry was less efficient than its wild-type counterpart. Expression of both forms of PEDV N during the reverse genetics rescue step could significantly enhance subsequent syncytium formation and raise the numbers of PEDV-AVCT12N.L381P-mCherry viral progenies (Fig 1C). Note that the numbers of the mutant viruses were still lower than their wild-type counterparts from the same conditions (Fig 1B and 1C, bar graphs). This might be due to an inherent growth disadvantage of the virus carrying the L381P mutation during the growth phase in Vero E6 cells.",

Upon overexpression of N proteins from field strains, an increase in PEDV-AVCT12-mCherry viral progenies was observed (Fig 1D). The results are not surprising, considering that N proteins are highly conserved among PEDV strains. These data imply a general effect of PEDV N proteins in improving rescue efficiency of a PEDV vaccine strain.

For fluorescence imaging, we followed expression of PEDV S to show extent of PEDV replication, as fluorescence of the virally-expressing mCherry faded upon cell fixation.",

Cells pre-transfected with 2 \u03bcg of pCAGGS-PEDV N-Myc showed even more extensive syncytium formation (Fig 2A). Interestingly, most of the cells that showed extensive infection were cells that displayed PEDV N-Myc expression (Fig 2A, merged). Moreover, even though not all cells were transiently transfected, initially untransfected cells could share PEDV N-Myc from nearby cells upon cytoplasmic fusion during syncytium formation and supposedly showed the enhancement effect on PEDV replication similar to transfected cells. This argued for a direct effect of ectopic PEDV N expression on PEDV replication within the same cells rather than an indirect effect that might be exerted on bystander cells.",

After selecting single clones, growth characteristics of the engineered Vero E6 cells were compared to the original cells. In the resazurin-based viability assay, Vero E6 and Vero E6-N cells displayed similar growth kinetics, suggesting that PEDV N overexpression has no significant impact on growth of the cells (Fig 3A). PEDV N expression in these cells were verified by Western blotting (Fig 3B). PEDV N localization was characterized by immunofluorescence and was observed primarily in cytoplasm (Fig 3C). However, in some cells, PEDV N was observed as punctae inside the nuclei, suggesting that PEDV N is partially localized in nucleolus as previously observed for nucleocapsids of PEDV and other CoVs [31, 32].",

Equal numbers of cells were plated in 6-well plates and infected with PEDV-AVCT12-mCherry or PEDV-AVCT12N.L381P-mCherry (MOI = 0.0001). Low MOI was chosen for the study as it has been shown to give better production yields for some live-attenuated vaccines [33]. Infection and replication were monitored by mCherry expression at 24, 36 and 48 hpi. PEDV-AVCT12-mCherry spread much more rapidly in Vero E6-N cells when compared to infection in Vero E6 cells (Fig 4A). By 24\u201336 hpi, large syncytia were ubiquitously observed; by 48 hpi, almost all cells were dead and detached from the plate (Fig 4A). For the slow-growing mutant PEDV-AVCT12N.L381P-mCherry, very large syncytia could be easily spotted in Vero E6-N cells at 24 hpi, whereas noticeably smaller syncytia were formed in Vero E6 cells (Fig 4B). At 36 hpi, the difference was the most obvious (Fig 4B).",

As expected from the qualitative visual observations, PEDV-AVCT12-mCherry replicated much faster in Vero E6-N cells, especially at early time points, with the peak titer at 36 hpi reaching mid-105 TCID50/ml (Fig 4C). After 36 hpi, the titer dropped sharply possibly due to the pervasive cell death caused by early rapid PEDV replication such that the rate of viral production fell behind the rate of degradation of the infectious virions in the media. At 48 hpi, no significant difference in titers was observed between supernatants from the two cells. However, the virus replicating in Vero E6 cells showed a peak titer of ~104 TCID50/ml at this time, ~10-fold lower than that observed in Vero E6-N cells at 36 hpi (Fig 4C). A similar pattern was observed for the slow-growing variant. At 36 hpi, about two orders of magnitude difference in titers was observed (Fig 4D). Even at the peak titers for the PEDV mutant grown in Vero E6 cells at 48 hpi, there still appeared to be a lag of ~an order of magnitude compared to the peak titer observed from Vero E6-N cells (Fig 4D). These data clearly demonstrate replication advantages of both PEDV variants in Vero E6-N cells and suggest that higher viral yields at a possible shorter culture time could be achieved with Vero E6-N cell platform.",

            "text": "To address how PEDV N-mediated increase in PEDV titer is achieved, we probed some of the mechanistic questions during viral replication. Since the most prominent functions of CoV N proteins involve viral genome management, we focused on the processes of viral RNA synthesis: transcription and replication. To measure genome replication activity, we used primers specific to ORF1 to quantify the levels of genomic RNA being produced over time. To measure transcription activity, we used the forward primer specific to the 5\u2019UTR and the reverse primer specific to the coding region of the S gene to quantify the levels of sgmRNA. Total RNA was extracted from Vero E6 or Vero E6-N cells infected with PEDV-AVCT12-mCherry (MOI = 0.0001) at indicated time points and was used as templates for one-step RT-qPCR with indicated primers. The levels of each RNA species were normalized to the levels of GAPDH mRNA from the same conditions and were expressed as relative quantities to the RNA level at 12 hpi from infected Vero E6 cells. Vero E6-N cells showed slight increase in the levels of genomic RNA at 24 hpi, but the difference disappeared by 36 hpi (Fig 5A). On the other hand, the levels of sgmRNA in infected Vero E6-N cells were consistently and significantly higher than those observed at the same time points in Vero E6 cells (Fig 5B). Notable difference in S expression levels was also observed between Vero E6 and Vero E6-N cells (Fig 5C). Interestingly, the difference between the levels of S protein expression roughly displayed about a 12-h lag between Vero E6-N and Vero E6 cells, corroborating with similar lags observed with the levels of sgmRNA (cf. Fig 5C and 5B) and mCherry protein expression (Fig 4A). Together, these results suggest that the main mechanism through which PEDV N enhances PEDV titer is increased sgmRNA transcription and viral protein synthesis while minimally affecting genome replication activity.",

Using the reverse genetics system established in our laboratory, a vaccine candidate with a spike gene derived from the strain YN144 [34] replacing the intrinsic AVCT12 spike in the PEDV-AVCT12-mCherry background (PEDV-AVCT12S.YN144-mCherry) was generated. This variant grew slightly more slowly than the wild-type PEDV-AVCT12-mCherry in Vero E6 cells expressing aminopeptidase N (Vero E6-APN) (A. Wanitchang and A. J., unpublished observation). First, we tested if expression of PEDV N could enhance viral recovery from an infectious clone for this particular strain. Rescue experiments were performed as described in Fig 1 but with pPEDV-mChS.YN144 plasmid. RT-qPCR quantification of released particles following first-round amplification in Vero E6 cells showed significant increase in viral RNA titers if PEDV N was present during the recovery phase in HEK 293T cells (Fig 6A). We then tested whether Vero E6-N cells could help enhance replication of this vaccine candidate strain. Vero E6 and Vero E6-N cells were infected with equal amounts of PEDV-AVCT12S.YN144-mCherry (MOI = 0.0001), and virus replication was monitored by formation of mCherry-positive syncytium formation and the TCID50 assay over time. As previously observed in Vero E6-APN cells, this PEDV variant replicated noticeably more slowly than its parental strain (cf. Figs 4A and 6B). Remarkably, replication in Vero E6-N cells was enhanced by about two orders of magnitudes at peak titers (Fig 6B, 60 hpi). Visual observation of mCherry-positive syncytia also revealed more robust replication of PEDV-AVCT12S.YN144-mCherry in Vero E6-N cells compared to Vero E6 cells (Fig 6C). Together, data in this section suggest that overexpression of PEDV N in trans could help enhance efficiency of PEDV vaccine production from the reverse genetics rescue step to the viral production step.",

            "text": "To determine if the enhancement effect exhibited by exogenous PEDV N expression is specific to PEDV or can be extended to help growth of other viruses, we examined replication of two other viruses in the presence of PEDV N. The laboratory-adapted influenza A virus (IAV, strain A/Puerto Rico/8/34) was chosen to represent a negative-sense RNA virus, while the vaccine strain of porcine reproductive and respiratory virus (PRRSV, Ingelvac MLV strain) was chosen to represent a closely-related positive-sense RNA virus. Vero E6 and Vero E6-N cells were infected with IAV (MOI 0.001) or PRRSV (MOI 0.01). At 36 hpi, infected cells were harvested for protein analysis, and supernatants were collected for released viral RNA quantification by RT-qPCR. No significant difference in IAV titers produced from the two cells could be observed (Fig 7A). On the other hand, a slight increase (< 1-log) in PRRSV RNA titers was noticed in Vero E6-N cells (Fig 7B). Western blot analysis on infected cell lyases did not reveal drastic difference in viral protein production for either virus (Fig 7). This could be due to the lower sensitivity of Western blotting compared to vRNA quantification by RT-qPCR. These results suggest that PEDV N may help slightly enhance replication of a closely-related virus such as PRRSV but have no effect on replication of an unrelated virus such as IAV. Nevertheless, it is clear that PEDV N-mediated enhancement in viral replication is much more pronounced on PEDV replication than it is on other viruses.",

For minus-strand RNA viruses, nucleocapsid proteins are required for viral RNA transcription and replication [35, 36]. Therefore, reverse genetics systems for these viruses typically include separate expression systems for their nucleocapsid proteins [37, 38]. Although theoretically not necessary, for some plus-strand RNA viruses, expression of nucleocapsid proteins is required for or can enhance viral recovery during rescue. For TGEV, recovery of virus from transfection of TGEV transcripts requires transfection of TGEV N transcripts, even though TGEV recovery from the BAC system does not exhibit this requirement [39]. Similar observations were reported in efforts to rescue other CoVs from RNA transcripts, such as infectious bronchitis virus, MHV, and SARS-CoV [14, 40, 41]. In the case of PEDV, rescue from infectious RNA was aided by inclusion of the N gene transcript [30]. However, for the BAC-based PEDV reverse genetics system, the virus could be recovered without an extraneous N-expressing plasmid [22]. In this report, we showed that exogenous N protein, although not necessary, can significantly enhance PEDV rescue titers from the BAC system. These data from multiple CoV rescue experiments demonstrate the importance of N in efficient transcription and replication of CoVs and support previous suggestions that CoV N might play essential roles during early RNA synthesis [15, 16].",

Based on its role during the replication cycle, possible mechanisms through which PEDV N exerts its effect include viral RNA synthesis, viral particle assembly and IFN antagonism [11]. As our experiments were conducted in IFN-\u03b2-deficient Vero E6 cells, we are inclined to think that IFN antagonism is not primarily responsible for the observed enhancement in PEDV replication kinetics. Nevertheless, we could not entirely dismiss this possibility as PEDV N interferes with IRF-3 signaling [20], which could lead to suppression of other ISG responses independent of IFN-\u03b2. Indeed, it would be interesting to use other experimental systems with an intact IFN pathway to tease apart possible contribution on viral growth enhancement from PEDV N\u2019s IFN antagonism function. On the other hand, CoV N has been shown to be critical for CoV assembly. CoV N interacts with other CoV structural proteins, especially the membrane protein, as observed in MHV, TGEV and SARS-CoV [42, 43]. Even though N is not necessary for CoV envelope formation, expression of N greatly increases yields of virus-like particles in MHV and SARS-CoV, suggesting its important role in formation of complete virions [44, 45].",

            "text": "As the primary role of nucleocapsid protein involves viral genome management, we directly asked if ectopic PEDV N expression affects viral RNA synthesis during infection. While genome replication activity is enhanced at an early time point, marked increase in subgenomic RNA production could be observed in Vero E6-N cells over a sustained period, leading to large excess of viral protein production (Fig 5). In this experimental system, enhancement of subgenomic transcription might be the primary mechanism of the PEDV N-mediated viral growth enhancement. Several reports have also documented important roles of nucleocapsid proteins during viral RNA synthesis. In general, CoV N can act as an RNA chaperone, facilitating the adoption of proper RNA conformation for transcription or replication [12, 13]. For TGEV, efficient replicon activity could be observed only from replicons harboring the N gene, while activity of a replicon lacking TGEV N could be rescued in cells expressing TGEV N, demonstrating that N expression either in cis or in trans is required for efficient viral RNA synthesis [46]. Replication of Human CoV-229E genomic RNA is substantially increased by expression of HCoV N and, to a lesser extent, PEDV N [47]. MHV N interacts with a replicase component and is implicated in formation of the initiation complex required for negative-strand synthesis [16, 17]. Similar interactions between N and a replicase component have been recently described in PRRSV, a member of the same Nidovirales order [48]. Indeed, structural analysis has previously indicated structural similarity between C-terminal portions of SARS-CoV N and PRRSV N and suggested a common origin between the two viral families [49]. Interestingly, while influenza virus, a minus-strand RNA virus that replicates inside the host nucleus, was unaffected by PEDV N expression, PRRSV shows slightly enhanced replication in Vero E6-N cells. This specificity also indicates that the enhancement mechanism might be more specific to the replication cycle or machinery commonly shared by Nidoviruses rather than broadly antagonizing host antiviral state. As discussed in Yount et al., other possible mechanisms include enhancement of viral mRNA translation or viral genome protection performed by CoV N proteins [50].",

Indeed, we could not observe any advantage in propagation of PEDV field isolates in Vero E6-N cells (B.L. unpublished results). However, in combination with other technological advancement, we might be able to harness the potential of PEDV N in improving yields for the whole chain of modern vaccine production, from rescues of vaccine candidates from the reverse genetics process to cultivation and amplification of PEDV vaccine viruses in cell culture. Although the increase might seem small, ~1\u20132 orders of magnitude improvement and a decrease in cultivation time to harvest at peak titers could translate to significant cost reduction during manufacturing processes.",
