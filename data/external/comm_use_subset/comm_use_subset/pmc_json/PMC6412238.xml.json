They circulate in the blood protein-bound, serving as an energy source for tissues [1,3]. Chronically elevated FFAs level has been observed in obese people and in diabetic patients and is associated with insulin resistance and with sudden death in middle-aged men without known ischemic heart disease [1,3,4].

Critical illness is characterized by hypercatabolic state and by a change in the contribution of the endogenous protein, fat, and carbohydrate sources to oxidative fuel [5]. Lipolysis is accelerated by the high catecholamine and other stress hormone milieu leading to increased release of FFAs from adipocytes, thus, increasing FFAs level [6]. Insulin resistance during critical illness impairs the use of FFAs for energy, and, thus, contributes to increased FFAs level [7]. Heparin given during critical illness may also increase FFAs level by activating lipoprotein lipase [8]. FFAs may have toxic effects by increasing reactive oxygen species leading to cell death and necrosis [9] and by depressing the immune cell function [10]. In addition, FFAs potentiate insulin resistance and impair glucose metabolism by inhibiting glucose oxidation and by stimulating protein kinase C [1,10]. In an acute setting, elevated FFAs level has been associated with the development of acute lung injury in at-risk patients with sepsis, trauma, and pancreatitis and after on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting [8,11,12].",

Normally, serum FFAs level increases during fasting and exercise and after a fatty meal. FFAs level goes down postprandially due to the anti-lipolytic effect of insulin that is released after carbohydrate intake [13]. On the other hand, caloric restriction and weight loss lead to a lowering of FFAs level and can attenuate FFAs-induced hepatic insulin resistance in obese healthy patients [14,15,16]. However, the effect of caloric restriction on serum FFAs level has not been investigated in critically ill patients. The aims of this study were (1) to evaluate the clinical and nutritional correlates of high FFAs level in critically ill patients and the association with outcomes, and (2) study the effect of short-term caloric restriction (permissive underfeeding) on FFAs level during critical illness.

A separate informed consent was obtained for participation in this sub-study. The study was approved by the Institutional Board Review of the Ministry of the National Guard Health Affairs, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Blood was collected at the time of enrollment (baseline or study day 1) within 48 h of ICU admission and on days 3, 5, 7, and 14. Serum was prepared from the blood samples by centrifugation at 4 \u00b0C at 1600 g for 20 min and divided into aliquots. These aliquots were stored immediately in a designated freezing area at \u221270 \u00b0C to be analyzed once the sample size was completed.

We found that high FFAs level correlated highly with other lipid profile parameters (total, HDL and LDL cholesterol, but not triglycerides) and with age. Compared to those with normal FFAs level, patients with high FFAs level were at baseline significantly older, more likely to be diabetic, had higher HgbA1c, blood glucose, creatinine and non-HDL and LDL cholesterol concentrations, and had more hypoxemia (as reflected lower pO2: FiO2 ratio) despite lack of differences in APACHE II scores, SOFA scores, and vasopressor demands. During ICU stay, patients with high FFAs level had increased demand for insulin, disease-specific nutrition therapy, RRT, aspirin, and statins. The differences suggest the association of high FFAs level with metabolic syndrome. There was no difference in BMI, between the two groups; however, BMI is known to have its limitations in predicting obesity [22]. Because of these differences, we carried out multivariable analyses to account for the confounding effect of some of these variables on clinical outcomes. These analyses show that high FFAs level is not associated independently with clinical outcomes. Interestingly, patients with high FFAs level had less 24-h urinary nitrogen excretion and less negative nitrogen balance. This may be related to lower muscle mass in this older population and more frequent insulin therapy.",

FFAs level are elevated in obesity and diabetes [1,3]. In acute critical illness, where lipolysis increases, serum FFAs level increases [6]. Our study demonstrated that one-third of critically ill patients had high FFAs level; most (63.6%) of these patients were diabetics. We found that baseline cholesterol level and diabetes were independent risk factors for high FFAs level on multivariable logistic regression analysis. The effect of propofol on FFAs level is uncertain. In an experiment on dogs undergoing general anesthesia, high concentration of propofol (200 and 400 mcg/kg/min) were associated with increased FFAs level, although a study in humans undergoing general anesthesia for cardiopulmonary bypass showed that propofol (50 mcg/kg/min) compared to midazolam did not alter serum FFAs level [23,24]. In our study, categorization of patients into high and low FFAs level was based on baseline serum specimens, and doses of propofol preceding enrolment were not collected. Our study was not designed to specifically address the effect of propofol on FFAs level. Nevertheless, the doses of propofol that were used during the ICU stay were on average much lower than what was used in these studies, and, therefore, the effect of propofol on FFAs level in our cohort is likely to be small. The slightly lower dose of propofol given to patients with high-FFAs level was likely to be related to being older and more susceptible to sedation. Therefore, these patients would normally receive smaller doses of propofol.",

FFAs were found to exacerbate hyperglycemia-induced Toll-like receptor expression and activity in monocytic cells, increase superoxide release, enhance Nuclear factor-\u03baB activity, and induce the release of proinflammatory factors in diabetics [27]. Whether FFAs affect inflammation in critically ill patients is less clear. In a porcine endotoxemia model, infusing lipids at two different concentrations was associated with no differences in plasma tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin6, and leucocytes between animals with low and high FFAs suggesting that FFAs does not play a significant pro-inflammatory mediator effect [28]. However, FFAs have been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome and has been identified as a prognostic factor for this syndrome. In a lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury model, a 15-fold increase in free oleic acid was observed in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from mice 8 h after lipopolysaccharide application [20]. The FFA, oleic acid has been demonstrated to be elevated in patients with ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and in patients at-risk for ARDS [11,29]. Patients with sepsis demonstrated a six-fold increase in plasma oleic acid levels compared to healthy volunteers [19]. In addition, FFAs are elevated in the blood of patients with sepsis who are at increased risk for ARDS [30]. The exact mechanism of FFAs-associated lung injury is unclear; however, FFAs have been shown to increase permeability and to impair transepithelial active sodium transport mechanisms in the lung, and could, thus, promote alveolar edema formation and prevent edema resolution [31]. In our study, where almost all patients were on mechanical ventilation at baseline, hypoxemia was more significant in patients with high FFAs compared with patients with normal FFAs (median PaO2: FiO2 ratio was 115 vs. 200, p = 0.02), a finding that may be in line with the association of FFAs and lung injury. Whether FFAs are toxic to the kidneys is unclear. In an animal study, FFAs led to severe tubulointerstitial damage [32]. FFAs and their metabolites have been implicated in renal cell injury and development of chronic kidney in patients with the metabolic syndrome [33]. In our study, patients with high FFAs had a higher rate of new renal replacement therapy, although this association became not significant in multivariable analysis. This finding suggests that the observed crude association may be related to other confounders that put these patients at a higher risk for acute kidney injury; for example, patients with high FFAs level were more likely to be diabetics and had higher baseline creatinine compared to patients with normal FFAs level.",

However, the effects of short-term caloric restriction are different. In one study, 11 subjects were fed for two periods of 6 days with hypo- and eucaloric diet with the same macronutrient composition in random order [34]. At 6 days, fasting FFAs significantly increased with the hypocaloric diet compared with the eucaloric diet [34]. Whether the macronutrient composition affects FFAs was investigated in an animal model, and the study found that energy-restricted high-fat versus low-fat diet did not result in different FFA levels [35]. In the current study, serial levels of FFAs did not differ with time between patients receiving permissive underfeeding and standard feeding. ",
