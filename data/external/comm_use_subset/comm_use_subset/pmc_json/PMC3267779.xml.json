Guatemala is divided into 22 departments, which are further subdivided into 10-29 municipios (similar to counties), made up of multiple communities. The Guatemalan Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare (MSPAS) provides free healthcare in several different settings, including hospitals, health centers, health posts, and outreach centers. Hospitals and health centers are staffed by physicians and nurses, whereas health posts are staffed by nurses. Outreach centers provide preventive and primary healthcare but are only visited by trained medical staff a few days each month. In addition to the MSPAS facilities, formally-employed workers who contribute to the Guatemalan Institute of Social Security (IGSS) can receive healthcare from IGSS hospitals and health centers, which are concentrated in Guatemala City. Other non-governmental locations where people may seek healthcare are private hospitals and clinics, pharmacies, drug shops, and traditional healers and midwives. Communities in Guatemala vary in their access to healthcare depending on their size and location (e.g., urban vs. rural).",

These findings suggest that in Santa Rosa, sentinel surveillance for pneumonia in government hospitals will significantly underestimate the burden of disease, by up to 75% for children <5 years old and 88% for persons aged five years and older.

We used a case definition that required self-report or report by a proxy of an illness that occurred up to one year prior to interview. It is well known that such self-reports are limited by recall decay, and recent episodes are more likely to be recalled than earlier episodes.[21] This could be noted in our data that demonstrated a decreasing report of pneumonia with increasing time before the survey. As long as recent illness episodes do not differ from prior episodes with regard to patterns of healthcare-seeking behaviors, there is no reason to believe that recall decay causes bias with regard to these variables. Because our case definition is based on self-report, there is substantial potential for misclassification, especially between mild and severe acute respiratory illness, and this can be seen in the report of some lower respiratory tract symptoms among respondents with ILI. However, the behaviors associated with episodes of ILI compared to pneumonia (lower probability of seeking care outside the home, less likely to seek treatment at a hospital) are suggestive of a more mild illness and we are reasonably confident that we have described the healthcare seeking behaviors that are broadly associated with both pneumonia and ILI. An additional limitation is our sample size, which is too small to permit age to be stratified into more than two groups, restricting our ability to model healthcare-seeking behaviors more precisely by smaller age groups. Finally, it is not clear whether results from one area of Guatemala with a significantly lower indigenous population than the rest of the country can be generalized to the nation as a whole.",
