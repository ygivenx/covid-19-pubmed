            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an enteric coronavirus which causes diarrhea, vomiting, severe dehydration, and death in pigs. Neonatal pigs are particularly susceptible, with mortality rates that can be as high as 90\u2013100%. In older pigs, manifestation of the disease is milder but growth and production parameters are affected (1, 2). Classical strains of PEDV (G1 strains) were first detected in the UK in 1971, and spread to Asia and Europe. More recently, highly virulent strains (G2 strains) which emerged in China have spread to other countries, with the first case in the US being recorded in 2013 (1, 3, 4). It is estimated that the outbreak resulted in the losses of $0.9\u20131.8 billion and the death of 7 million pigs (5, 6). The availability of effective vaccines and the practice of stringent biosecurity measures are critical for the prevention of PEDV. However, the development of effective vaccines has been complicated by frequent viral evolution and the fact that PED is most severe in immunologically na\u00efve neonates. Effective and safe vaccines development was also challenging because active vaccine replication in the gut is required to induce good and lasting mucosal immunity.",

Vaccination of sows prior to farrowing induces lactogenic immunity which is transferred to neonatal piglets via colostrum. Inactivated vaccines are very safe but have a low duration of immunity and appear to produce a predominantly Th2 type immune response (7). Attenuated vaccines, produced by serially passaging field strains between 83 and 100 passages, are more effective against homologous strains but have a long lead development time and have been associated with safety concerns of recombination with field strains (2). Regardless of the type of vaccine used, viremia and transmission of PEDV is not prevented in vaccinated animals. Outbreaks in vaccinated herds and the periodical emergence of new, highly pathogenic strains are not uncommon in countries were vaccines have been routinely used for many years (2, 7\u20139).",

However, their efficacy has also been questioned by independent studies, as vaccination of PEDV na\u00efve sows did not result in strong protection in neonatal piglets (8, 10, 11). As the strong need for effective PEDV vaccines remains unmet, the practice of feeding back minced intestines from infected piglets to sows, in an attempt to induce more effective immunity against PEDV, is common in the field (8, 10, 11). The use of autogenous vaccines, where a custom inactivated vaccine tailored to each herd is prepared using a sample provided from the production unit, is also practiced (8, 12, 13). Both the feedback and autogenous vaccine approaches are, once again, associated with significant safety and efficacy issues but natural or intentional exposure of pigs of all ages to PEDV provides stronger homologous and partial heterologous protection (2, 8). Further, vaccination of na\u00efve animals is less effective than vaccination of previously exposed pigs, indicating that current vaccines are less effective than natural infection at priming the immune response but can effectively boost the memory response (14). It is established that the viral spike protein is a critical protective antigen, as anti-spike protein-specific serum IgG levels correlate well with protection against PEDV and virus neutralizing responses (15). However, the S-protein based subunit vaccine (iPED plus, Harris Vaccines Inc.) is of questionable efficacy, indicating that other viral components could contribute to protection.",

Previously published data shows that the SARS coronavirus capsid is metastable and can be reversibly denatured by changes in temperature or pH, with unfolding commencing at 35\u00b0C and complete denaturation occurring at 55\u00b0C (16). Hence, in this study, our vaccine development approach consisted of exposing PEDV virions to 44\u00b0C to unfold the capsid, followed by fragmentation or digestion of the genome with RNAse to diminish viral replication and subsequent refolding of the capsid at 25\u00b0C. Gamma-irradiated PEDV virions were used as an inactivated control vaccine (17). The objective of this study was to evaluate the heat and RNAse treated PEDV vaccine for its safety, immunogenicity and ability to reduce viremia in a weanling piglet model, with the ultimate goal of developing a process which can potentially reduce lead vaccine development time, is safe and be easily applied to newly emerging strains.",

Intact structures were detected at all temperatures tested. However, increasing numbers of misshapen and fragmented virions were detected at 50\u00b0C and above. Cultures treated at 37 and 45\u00b0C remained viable as viral replication was visible by immunofluorescence (IFA) in infected Vero cells using a PEDV-specific antibody, without any amplification by serial passaging. Virus was detected after the 1st passage in the cultures treated at 50\u00b0C. Virus cultures treated at 55 and 60\u00b0C were not amplified even after four serial passages in Vero cells, indicating that complete inactivation occurred at these temperatures. Hence a temperature of 44\u00b0C for 10 min was chosen for reversible unfolding of the viral capsid (Figure 1B) without completely inactivating the virus. Untreated control virus culture remained structurally intact as expected (Figure 1A). Similarly, while RNAse treatment alone did not affect viability, the reduction in viral replication was proportional to the dose and time of exposure to RNase in the heat-treated virions. A dose of 10 units of RNase A and 1,000 units of RNase T with an exposure time of 4 h was chosen as optimal for the final vaccine preparation. While the untreated virus control showed robust replication (Figure 2A), following the heat and RNAse treatment protocol, viral replication was detected only in the 3rd passage in Vero cells (Figure 2B).",

Gamma irradiation has been traditionally used to inactivate viruses. The mechanisms involved include nucleic acid degradation, destruction of covalent bonds, and release of free radicals (30). As commercial inactivated vaccines were not available at the time of testing gamma irradiation was selected as the method of choice to prepare an inactivated control vaccine for this study. Moreover, similar to the heat and RNAse treated vaccine, the virus-like-particulate structure was more likely to be maintained by gamma irradiation, while achieving complete inactivation.",

However, a gamma irradiated, Lassa virus vaccine failed to protect vaccinated mice (32). Although both approaches tested in this study targeted nucleic acids and preservation of structure, the protective outcomes varied significantly between the two vaccines tested. It is possible that release of free radicals during the irradiation process could have a deleterious effect on integrity of antigenic structures and antigen presentation in vivo. A more detailed characterization of these parameters will be the focus of future studies. Similar results for the gamma irradiated vaccine in this study, it has been shown that a dendritic cell targeted spike protein-based subunit vaccine against PEDV exacerbated intestinal pathology in vaccinated pigs, despite stimulating strong CD4+/CD8+ T cell responses (33).",

Although the heat and RNAse treated virus culture was amplified after 3 passages in cell culture (Figure 2), the absence its detection by RT-qPCR (Figure 4), or immunohistochemistry (Table 1 and Figure 5) and the lack of strong Ab responses to the non-structural NP (Figure 3), in vaccinated pigs prior to challenge indicates that active vaccine viral replication was absent in the host or was undetectable by the techniques used.

Insertions and deletions in the spike protein, especially the S1 region, influence pathogenicity, and immunogenicity of PEDV. The core neutralizing epitope of the PEDV spike protein has been localized to amino acid positions 503\u2013568 (35, 36). The SNPs identified in the spike protein of the vaccine virions (Table 2) did not map to these residues. While a limitation of the described method is that genetic changes induced by treatment and repair are unpredictable, repair of mutations (37) or complementation in trans of the fragmented genome could have led to detection of a fluorescent signal in the 3rd passage after treatment. Indeed, it has been shown that replication deficient genomes with deletions or mutations are produced during serial passaging of foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) for attenuation. They are not infective by themselves, but when present in the same cell, the mutations in the genomes can complement each other in trans to produce plaques in vitro. When the defective-complementing virus system was used as a vaccine by Rodriguez-Calvo et al. vaccine virus replication was not detected but strong protection was elicited. This observation can be explained by vaccine virus replication in the host being limited by the requirement of coinfection of the same cell. Even if such an unlikely coinfection event were to happen despite active host innate immunity, the recombined progeny viruses were more likely to be highly attenuated than acquire virulence, thus providing an additional vaccine safety barrier in vivo (38). In vivo, the presence of the host innate immune system was likely able to effectively curtail replication, despite exposure to 105 TCID50 of the heat and RNAse treated virus culture. More detailed studies are required to confirm these hypotheses, but they are not within the scope of this manuscript.",

            "text": "The importance of spike protein-specific antibodies for protection against PEDV is well-established (15). Several studies describing experimental subunit and vectored vaccines or commercial attenuated and inactivated vaccines against PEDV establish a strong correlation between spike protein-specific antibodies, virus neutralization titers and protection against infection (9, 29, 37, 39\u201343). Similar to these studies, strong spike-protein specific Ab responses and virus neutralizing responses were noted in the pigs immunized with the heat and RNAse treated vaccine. A commercial inactivated vaccine was able to reduce challenge viral shedding by 3\u20134 logs but an attenuated vaccine induced IgA responses but did not affect viral shedding (43). Testing of two attenuated PEDV strains produced by serial passage in weanling pigs showed that the passaged viruses were attenuated but were not protected against challenge viral shedding or clinical signs (29). While direct comparisons are not possible due to differences in experimental conditions, unlike the other cited studies, intestinal lesions, or challenge virus was not detected by qPCR in the heat and RNAse treated vaccine group in this study. Although boosters were incorporated in the study design to minimize risk, it is likely that they were not required to achieve adequate protection as strong spike protein specific antibody responses and virus neutralizing responses were detected after the first dose of the heat and RNAse treated vaccine, at DPV 14 (Figure 3). While cell mediated immunity was not assessed due to difficulties with transportation of cells, it is very likely that it was not compromised by the process used as the heat and RNAse treated vaccine was very effective in preventing challenge viral replication in vaccinated pigs.",

Although clinical signs are less severe in older piglets (28) and virulence can vary between isolates used for challenge (44, 45), PEDV can infect and replicate well in pigs of all ages (14, 46). Hence several researchers have used weanling piglets to screen vaccine candidates for efficacy and safety (9, 13, 29, 43, 47\u201352). This approach can help reduce animal use and cost if the candidates fall short of expectations. Several swine bioassay studies in growing piglets have reported that peak PEDV replication occurs between DPI 3 and DPI 7 after which viral loads decrease (28, 43, 47, 48). Similar patterns of infectivity were observed in this study, as the uninfected control pigs had a mean fecal viral RNA load of 8.35 log copy numbers at DPI 7 (Figure 4) developed microscopic lesions, but not severe clinical signs. In comparison to the untreated control and irradiated vaccine groups, no fecal viral shedding or intestinal pathology was detected in the pigs immunized with the heat and RNase treated vaccine, indicating that vaccine induced immunity was highly effective against PEDV challenge, within the limits of this weanling pig study model.",
