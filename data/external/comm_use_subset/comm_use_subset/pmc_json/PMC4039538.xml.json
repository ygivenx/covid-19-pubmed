            "text": "Respiratory disease in pigs is common in modern pork production worldwide and is often referred to as porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC) [1]. PRDC is polymicrobial in nature, and occurs following infections with various combinations of primary and secondary respiratory pathogens. There are a variety of viral and bacterial pathogens commonly associated with PRDC including porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (App) [1]. Both are considered pathogens of major importance or relevance for the pig industry [1]. Furthermore, bacterial-viral co-infections can exacerbate the pathogenicity of respiratory pig diseases [1]. For example, co-infections with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and swine influenza virus (SIV) exhibited more severe clinical disease [2], PRRSV and Streptococcus suis co-infection experiments confirmed that PRRSV predisposes pigs to S. suis infection and bacteremia [3] and increases the virulence of PRRSV in pigs [4], M. hyopneumoniae infection increases effectiveness of PRRSV infection and lesions [5], and PRRSV infection was able to accelerate Haemophilus parasuis infection and loads [6]. Those studies on co-infections principally looked at the macroscopic lesions and at the clinical signs. Only a few recent studies are investigating more closely the direct interactions and mechanisms involved between the pathogens. As an example, Qiao and collaborators showed that PRRSV and bacterial endotoxin (LPS) act in synergy to amplify the inflammatory response of infected macrophages [7]. Thus, it is crucial to develop new in vitro models to investigate in more details the mechanistic and the interactions involved in polymicrobial infections.",

Exposure to the organism may lead to chronic infection such that animals fail to thrive; alternatively, they survive as asymptomatic carriers that transmit the disease to healthy herds. Many virulence factors of this microorganism have been well characterized [14]\u2013[16]. To date, fifteen serotypes of App based on capsular antigens have been described [17], [18].

Consequently, based on this previous report, only a cytotoxicity experiment was performed in order to verify if PRRSV infection increases the cytotoxicity of App. Moreover, this assay was done to confirm that inactivation of the toxins ApxI and ApxII in the mutant App\u0394apxI\u0394apxIIC reduces cell death seen with Appwt strain. Thus, LDH cytotoxicity assays to detect cell death were performed on cells infected with PRRSV for 72 hours and then co-infected with Appwt strain or App\u0394apxI\u0394apxIIC. As shown in Figure 2, the cytotoxic activity of Appwt was higher in both cell lines after 2 hours of incubation, around 36% in SJPL cells (Figure 2A) and around 14% in MARC-145 cells (Figure 2C) compared to the one of App\u0394apxI\u0394apxIIC mutant after 6 hours of incubation, which was less than 15% in SJPL cells (Figure 2B) and around 7% in MARC-145 cells (Figure 2D). As expected, the App\u0394apxI\u0394apxIIC mutant is markedly less cytotoxic than the parental strain Appwt. Thus, App\u0394apxI\u0394apxIIC mutant allows much longer incubation periods with cells and facilitate in vitro observation. Furthermore, co-infection with PRRSV and App\u0394apxI\u0394apxIIC increased SJPL and MARC-145 cells death compared to App single infection (Figure 2B and D, respectively), showing an additive cytotoxicity effect of PRRSV and App\u0394apxI\u0394apxIIC. Because of its markedly reduced cytotoxicity, the App\u0394apxI\u0394apxIIC was used for all the subsequent experiments.",

MARC-145 cell line was used to compare results obtained with SJPL cell line since MARC-145 cells are the most common cells used during in vitro PRRSV studies. Interestingly, results were different between the two cell lines. In PRRSV infected MARC-145 cells, only a small reduction of cells expressing the PRRSV N protein was observed following a co-infection with App\u0394apxI\u0394apxIIC (Figure 3G). Thus, SJPL cells were qualitatively more responsive to the App antiviral affect than MARC-145 cells. Moreover, since SJPL cells were recently shown to be from monkey origin [21] and not from swine as first described [22], evaluation of the antiviral activity of App was tested in a porcine relevant cell model, the PAM cells. Co-infection with App\u0394apxI\u0394apxIIC and PRRSV in PAM cells also presented total absence of PRRSV N protein detection (Figure 3L), as in SJPL cells (Figure 3B), suggesting that App\u0394apxI\u0394apxIIC can also inhibits PRRSV in PRRSV\u2019s in vivo porcine target cells, the porcine alveolar macrophages. Incubation with UV-inactivated App\u0394apxI\u0394apxIIC bacteria after PRRSV infection allowed the detection of N proteins of PRRSV by IFA in all cell types (Figure 3C, 3H and 3M) showing that UV-inactivated bacteria were not able to block PRRSV infection. Interestingly, the bacteria-free culture supernatant of App\u0394apxI\u0394apxIIC also effectively blocked PRRSV infection in SJPL and PAM cells (Figure 3D and 3N, respectively). A weak inhibition was observed in MARC-145 cells (Figure 3I). pH did not vary between all the tested conditions, being stable at around 7.3\u00b10.1. The active metabolites present in the culture supernatant did not seem to be App LPS (Figure 3E, 3J and 3O) nor peptidoglycan fragments (assayed with NOD1 or NOD2 ligands) (Figure S1D and S1F, respectively). Dilutions of App\u0394apxI\u0394apxIIC supernatant showed a dose-dependent effect on PRRSV\u2019s detection by IFA. A 1\u22362 dilution resulted in twice as much PRRSV N protein when observed with IFA (data not shown). The loss of antiviral activity of App\u0394apxI\u0394apxIIC supernatant was observed with 1\u223610, 1\u223620 and 1\u223640 dilutions.",

SJPL, MARC-145 and PAM cells were infected or treated as described previously. In SJPL cells after 72 hours post PRRSV infection, viral titer obtained was 6.25 log10 TCID50/ml (Figure 4A), in MARC-145 cells, was 7.6 log10 TCID50/ml (Figure 4B) and in PAM cells, 6.0 log10 TCID50/ml (Figure 4C). Co-infection with App\u0394\u0394apxI\u0394apxIIC or treatment with its culture supernatant blocked completely PRRSV replication (P<0.01) in SJPL cells (Figure 4A). But in MARC-145 cells, their antiviral effect on PRRSV replication was markedly less efficient. More specifically, in MARC-145 cells, PRRSV titers were 4.9 log10 TCID50/ml (which correspond to a 751 fold decrease compared to PRRSV non-treated infected cell) and 6.5 log10 TCID50/ml (which correspond to a 19 fold decrease compared to PRRSV non-treated infected cell) for App\u0394apxI\u0394apxIIC (P<0.01) and its cell-free culture supernatant (P<0.05) treated cells, respectively (Figure 4B). In PAM cells, results obtained with PRRSV\u2019s titration showed that live App\u0394apxI\u0394apxIIC completely blocked PRRSV replication (P<0.001) and that its culture supernatant significantly inhibits PRRSV infection in PAM, reducing its amount of infectious virions to 2.9 log10 TCID50/ml (P<0.001 compared to PRRSV infection at 106 TCID50/mL) which correspond to a 1250 fold decrease (Figure 4C). Stimulation of the cells with App purified LPS or co-infection with UV inactivated bacteria did not have any effect on PRRSV titer in all cell types (Figure 4A, 4B and 4C). Those results confirm the IFA data obtained previously. In addition, it is important to note that inhibition in PAM is total with live App\u0394apxI\u0394apxIIC as observed previously in SJPL cells and below PRRSV inoculum when treated with App\u0394apxI\u0394apxIIC cell culture supernatant. Thus, those results indicate that App\u0394apxI\u0394apxIIC antiviral effect against PRRSV can be observed not only in SJPL cells but also in porcine alveolar macrophages.",

First, the SJPL cells permissivity was tested in regards to different DNA genome viruses such as: BAV3, BHV-1, BHV-4, CPV, EHV-1, and PCV2; as well as RNA genome viruses such as: BVDV-1, Influenza H1N1, and Influenza H3N2.

Thus, treatment with App\u0394apxI\u0394apxIIC culture supernatant was performed after infection with those viruses in SJPL cells, to verify its spectrum of antiviral activity. Overall, 50% of the viruses tested that are able to replicate in SJPL cells (excluding PRRSV) were inhibited by App\u0394apxI\u0394apxIIC cell culture supernatant. Those inhibited viruses were: EHV-1, Influenza H1N1 and H3N2. However, it is important to note that the inhibition of PRRSV replication observed following treatment with App\u0394apxIC\u0394apxIIC supernatant was significantly higher compared to than the inhibition observed against EHV-1, Influenza H1N1 and H3N2 (Table 1). These results are important because they indicate that SJPL cells were still able to allow the replication of several viruses in the presence of App\u0394apxI\u0394apxIIC cell culture supernatant, indicating that the SJPL cells are still metabolically active and fit for viruses\u2019 replication.",

Inhibition of PRRSV replication by App\u0394apxI\u0394apxIIC is not generated by contact between bacterial and eukaryotic host cell, since it was also observed with App cell culture supernatant; thus without the presence of App bacterial cells. Furthermore, this antiviral effect is not only observed in SJPL cells but also in the PRRSV natural host target cells, i.e. PAM. This suggests that the antiviral action of App\u0394apxI\u0394apxIIC can be efficient in different cell species and types. Viral inhibition in PAM cells was complete in presence of the bacteria App\u0394apxI\u0394apxIIC and was partial when treated with its cell culture supernatant. Other combinations of treatments have been tested. Data obtained gave some information about the mechanism of the antiviral activity of App\u0394apxI\u0394apxIIC supernatant. Overall, they suggested that App\u0394apxI\u0394apxIIC supernatant\u2019s antiviral activity is not interfering with PRRSV attachment and entry.

This study might lead to the development of a new treatment against PRRSV derived from App cell culture supernatant.

Moreover, since we have demonstrated that the antiviral effect of the metabolite(s) secreted from App is not only specific to PRRSV, but also effective against other RNA viruses, this antiviral activity might as well lead to a new antiviral treatment. For example, molecules such as Ribavirin, which is currently used against human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [50], [51] and hepatitis C infection [52], was initially demonstrated to have a broad antiviral activity against animal viruses [53]. This study might therefore allow the development of a new antiviral molecule against PRRSV, but also against other viruses such as influenza.",

Webster (St. Jude Children\u2019s Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA) [22] and later was demonstrated to be from monkey origin [21]. This cell line was grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS (Wisent Inc), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 \u00b5M MEM nonessential amino acid, 10 U/mL of penicillin, 10 \u00b5g/mL of streptomycin and 250 g/L antibiotic-antimitotic solution and, 100 mg/L gentamicin. Porcine alveolar macrophages (PAM) were harvested from lungs of 2 to 14 weeks old pigs as described previously [19]. Pigs were sacrificed following ethic protocol 12-Rech-1640 approved by our institutional ethic committee (Comit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9thique de l\u2019utilisation des animaux \u2013 C\u00c9UA) following the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care. Briefly, an instillation of the lungs with PBS containing 10 units/mL penicillin, 10 \u00b5g/mL streptomycin and 100 mg/L gentamicin was realized. Then, phosphate buffer saline solution (PBS) was collected and PAM removed following low speed centrifugation. Cells were washed with DMEM medium complemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 0,1 mM HEPES, 1 \u00b5M non-essential amino acids, 250 g/L amphotericin B (Wisent Inc), 10 units/mL penicillin, 10 \u00b5g/mL streptomycin and 100 mg/L gentamicin. Cells were then collected following low speed centrifugation and were resuspended in freezing medium (same as wash medium plus 20% foetal bovine serum and 10% DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich, St-Louis, MO, USA)) and slowly frozen, than stored in liquid nitrogen until further utilization. PAM cells were cultured for 24 hours in complete DMEM prior to assay. All cells were cultured and infected at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 atmosphere.",
