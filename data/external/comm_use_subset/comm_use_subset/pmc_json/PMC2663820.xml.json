            "text": "Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is a common illness affecting all age groups worldwide. Even in developed countries, most of the population will average one episode of AGE per year [1]. Among young children and the elderly, the rate is higher and the disease more severe [2],[3]. Globally, approximately 1.5 billion episodes and 1.5 to 2.5 million deaths annually in children under age five are estimated to be associated with AGE, the majority occurring in developing countries [4]. Among the elderly, underlying immunological, physiological and functional deterioration exacerbate severity, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality attributed to diarrheal disease. Mortality may exceed 50% in the above 73 years age group in the US [3]. However, for such an important disease, our understanding of causality remains incomplete. The importance of bacteria and parasites in AGE has been known for many years, although the roles of campylobacter (1972) [5] and cryptosporidium (1976) [6] in human infection were recognized more recently. Viruses such as rotavirus and enteric adenovirus were also first described over 30 years ago and shown to have an association with diarrheal disease. Rotavirus is the most common cause of viral AGE in children under age five [7]. The recent widespread availability of molecular diagnostics has allowed an increased understanding of the role of other viruses in causing AGE. The human calicivirus genus Norovirus (NoV, formerly Norwalk-like virus, NLV) is now recognized as the most common cause of epidemic outbreaks of AGE across all age groups [1] with noroviruses belonging to genogroup 2 (NoV GII) more frequent than those belonging to genogroup 1 (NoV GI). Recent reports suggest prevalence rates of 9 to 20% for NoV in sporadic AGE in children [8]\u2013[11]. Similarly, associations with AGE have also been made for both a second calicivirus genus Sapovirus (formerly Sapporo-like virus, SLV or classic calicivirus) and astrovirus. A limited number of reports suggest sapoviruses are less frequently found in cases of AGE than NoVs, are mainly restricted to children less than age five years and may cause less severe symptoms than infections with rotavirus and NoV [12]\u2013[14]. Human astroviruses are reported to have an association with AGE, especially in children, with prevalence rates up to 8.6% documented [15]\u2013[17]. Higher rates (39%) have been reported in children less than 1 year old [18] and in areas lacking adequate sanitation [19]. Other viruses such as torovirus, picobirnavirus, picotrinavirus, pestivirus and coronavirus have also been implicated [20]\u2013[23]. Lately, there have been reports of human bocavirus (HBoV) sequences in feces of children with respiratory infections or AGE [24]\u2013[26]. However, many of these observations are from uncontrolled trials and in the absence of large prospective controlled studies, their association with AGE is uncertain. Despite this wide range of known and suspected pathogens, in both pediatric and adult populations, the pathogen causing AGE remains unidentified in up to 67% of cases [7],[14],[27],[28].",

            "text": "In order to further investigate the causes of AGE in children, in late 2000 we commenced a prospective controlled study of patients presenting to a children's hospital in Adelaide, South Australia. Unexpectedly, even with extensive molecular testing, we could not find a cause in 28% of cases (Ratcliff, R.M. unpublished). Proposing that novel viruses may be the cause of the undiagnosed cases, we developed a method for \u2018non-selective\u2019 detection of viral DNA in feces. This method uses degenerate oligonucleotide primed (DOP) PCR amplification [29] to non-specifically amplify DNA from diarrheal samples. Previously, DOP amplification had been utilized to replicate DNA from minute samples such as single cell nuclei, and forensic and archaeological sources [29]. An alternative \u2018non-specific\u2019 amplification method used nuclease digestion to specifically purify virus nucleic acid by exploiting the protection of the virus nucleic acid from digestion afforded by the virus capsid [30]. Combining nuclease digestion with DOP amplification ought to facilitate the sole replication of viral nucleic acid from nucleic acid \u2018soups\u2019 such as feces. The DNA produced from such virus enrichment followed by non-specific amplification can be cloned and sequenced to assess the presence of viral DNA and provide a method to screen for novel enteric viruses. We initially investigated a \u2018summer\u2019 cluster of sporadic AGE cases occurring between January and April 2001 and who were part of the case control study into the etiology of pediatric AGE. We detected a previously unknown parvovirus, which we have named Human Bocavirus species 2 (HBoV2). Following the development of specific amplification assays to detect HBoV2, we screened all samples collected from cases and controls in the study during 2001 and assessed their association with pediatric AGE. During this screening, we discovered a second novel parvovirus which we have named Human Bocavirus species 3 (HBoV3).",

From this alignment we predict that the W153 sequence spans the entire coding region of the virus genome but lacks up to 100 nucleotides of both terminal regions. At the nucleotide level the W153 sequence is 23% variant from its closest relative, the HBoV but contains open reading frames (ORFs) for NS1, NP1, VP1 and VP2 proteins in a similar arrangement to the HBoV including the alignment of the NP1 ORF in an alternate reading frame to VP1 whereby it overlaps the start of the VP1 by 13 nucleotides (Figure 2). A comparison of the length of the coding regions, and the genetic distance (percent dissimilarity) between them, for W153 and HBoV at the nucleotide and amino acid level are presented in Table 1. These results are in contrast to strains of the HBoV where the homology between all strains exceeds 98% at both nucleotide and amino acid level for all ORFs [24],[31]. The ICTVb criteria for defining a new species in the bocavirus genus is a non-structural gene genetic homology of less than 95% (C. B\u00fcchen-Osmond, International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ICTVdb/Ictv/fs_parvo.htm, Columbia University, New York, USA). Thus we propose that the virus detected in sample W153 is not a new strain of the HBoV but rather a new species of Bocavirus (family Parvoviridae subfamily Parvovirinae) and have assigned the name Human Bocavirus species 2 (HBoV2; see Discussion and reference 35 for further details). The sequence of the HBoV2-W153 strain has been deposited in GenBank (designated HBoV2-W153, accession number EU082213).",

The sequence analysis showed the presence of both HBoV2 and HBoV, as well as another novel parvovirus. The genome of this virus from sample W471 was sequenced using specific PCRs incorporating primers homologous to recovered W471 sequence and homologous regions in an alignment of HBoV2-W153 and HBoV, plus a semi-DOP approach similar to that used for HBoV2-W153 to extend the sequence, to recover 5242 nucleotides of sequence spanning the entire coding region, but missing the termini sequences as for HBoV2-W153. The alignment of the W471 sequence with other Parvovirinae confirms it is also a bocavirus (Figure 1) with the genetic distance of the ORFs at both nucleotide and amino acid level (Table 1) indicative it is a novel bocavirus species. To the virus in sample W471, we have assigned the name Human Bocavirus species 3 (HBoV3; GenBank EU918736). The unusual pattern of similarity for HBoV3 seen in Table 1 (genetically closer to HBoV in the non-structural protein-encoding regions but to HBoV2 in the structural protein-encoding region) suggests that HBoV3 might be the result of an ancestral recombination event between HBoV and HBoV2. To investigate this possibility a similarity analysis (Simplot) was performed comparing HBoV3 with HBoV and HBov2. This confirmed that two recombination sites are present, immediately upstream of both NS1 and VP1/2 ORFs (Figure 3).",

Based on a comparison with other species, the 5204 and 5242 nucleotide sequences recovered for these virus respectively, represents over 98% of the predicted genome for both viruses, each containing the ORFs typical of other bocaviruses and only lacking both termini. Our initial attempts to sequence the termini have failed, consistent with Allander's observations that the terminal regions of HBoV are problematic [32], most likely due to hairpin loop structures as identified at the termini of other parvoviruses [33]. Work to clarify the sequence of the viral termini is ongoing. Genetic homology alignments place both HBoV2 and HBoV3 in the Bocavirus genus of the Parvovirinae (Figure 1) and both have a similar genome arrangement of putative ORFs to HBoV. HBoV2 is 23% variant from HBoV, its closest previously known relative. HBoV3 lies between the two, 18% variant both from HBoV2 and HBoV at the genome level. The level of dissimilarity to HBoV is maintained for HBoV2 across the coding regions at both nucleotide and amino acid levels. Intriguingly, this is not the case for HBoV3, where the non-structural ORFs NS1 and NP1 are more similar to HBoV, where as the structural ORF (VP1/VP2) is more similar to HBoV2 (Table 1). Thus HBoV3 may be the consequence of a recombination event between ancestral forms of HBoV2 and HBoV. The SimPlot analysis on an alignment of the three viral genomes (Figure 3) supports this hypothesis, indicating recombination sites close to genome positions 200 and 3000, just upstream of the NS1 and VP1/2 ORFs. There are homologous regions in both these locations which would facilitate such an event. Interestingly, recombination events have been reported for NoV GII with the recombination site similarly located in conserved sequence immediately upstream of the capsid-encoding ORF [34]. Nevertheless, since there is less than 95% genetic similarity for all putative ORFs including those encoding non-structural proteins (NS1 and NP1), this is consistent with both HBoV2 and HBoV3 being new species of bocavirus.",

In the univariant analysis of first samples, only rotavirus infection was significantly associated with AGE (Table 2). The inclusion of second samples collected within three days of presentation for 105 cases resulted in significant AGE-association for HBoV2, adenovirus and astrovirus, in addition to rotavirus. It was only in the multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis (Table 3) that NoV GII was associated with AGE. Thus, although an association with AGE was not achieved for HBoV2 in the most rigorous univariant analysis so further conclusions require caution until additional data are available, it is persuasive that an association with AGE was achieved for HBoV2 in the same data analysis (pooled case samples) in which significance was achieved for adenovirus and NoV GII, the role of which as pathogens causing AGE is not disputed [37]. HBoV2, at 17.2%, was the third most prevalent virus after rotavirus (39.2%) and astrovirus (21.5%), and was greater than that for NoV GII (13.4%) and adenovirus (4.8%). Two further factors may be influencing the prevalence rates for HBoV2 we have detected in both cases and controls. Firstly, S phase synchronized replication observed for other parvoviruses may also be applicable for HBoV2, in which case delayed and perhaps cyclical or pulsed shedding of HBoV2 during infection may result, consistent with our finding that 10 cases (31.2% of positive cases) had detectable virus only in their second sample. Therefore, the statistical association in the pooled sample data may better reflect the true disease association. Secondly, long term virus shedding post-infection, which is increasingly being recognized for other enteric viruses such as NoV GII [38], may also account for asymptomatic carriage among the controls. However, until the natural history of HBoV2 infection is elucidated, the influence of S phase replication and asymptomatic shedding can only be speculative.",

Further, while little trouble was experienced recovering the near identical genomic sequence of HBoV2-W208 using HBoV2-W153-derived primer sets, limited attempts with the more variant HBoV2 and HBoV3 strains has proved problematic. Therefore, sub-optimal primer binding may have led to an under representation of HBoV2 and HBoV3 in our samples. Indeed, Kapoor et al.\n[35] have recently reported a number of such variants.

The lack of statistical association with symptoms is consistent with the presence of HBoV in feces being incidental, perhaps indicative of swallowed virus of respiratory origin [24] or systemic spread as has been reported for B19 parvovirus [36].

Application of novel molecular testing techniques has resulted in the identification of one novel virus, HBoV2 with statistical data suggestive that it is causally associated with AGE and a second novel virus, HBoV3, with as yet no disease association. The detection of HBoV2 has reduced the pathogen-negative cases by 17.5%. Although not a prime focus of the study, we have additionally demonstrated a statistical association with AGE for astrovirus, the first such study to do so with prospectively enrolled matched case and control pairs. Lastly, we have similarly demonstrated that HBoV is not statistically associated with AGE and its presence in fecal samples is possibly the consequence of swallowing respiratory secretions. There is evidence of further genetic variation within strains which may be accounted for by additional variant strains of HBoV2 or HBoV and perhaps other bocaviruses. The role of HBoV3 in human disease is unknown. Although detected equally in samples from cases and controls, the prevalence is too low for meaningful analysis until further screening for its presence in a variety of samples has been completed.",

Confirmation of the presence of HBoV2 in AGE cases elsewhere in the world is needed as are further prospective controlled studies of viral prevalence in AGE. HBoV2 may be associated with diseases other than AGE and testing in other contexts will be needed. Finally, despite the addition of HBoV2 to the list of proven and probable causes of viral gastroenteritis, 25% of cases in this study remain undiagnosed.

The study was approved by th je Research Ethics Committees of the Women's and Children's Hospital (WCH) and the Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science (IMVS). Following informed patient/parent/guardian consent, prospective enrolment was offered to patients presenting to the WCH in Adelaide, South Australia, and meeting the case definition of three or more loose stools within the last 24 hours, with or without vomiting, and a duration prior to presentation of less than 7 days. Clinical histories and parameters of disease progression were recorded for the enrolled cases. One or two faecal samples were collected from cases within 72 hours of enrolment but only a single sample from controls. Samples were screened for bacteria (microscopy and culture), parasites (microscopy) and viruses rotavirus and enteric adenovirus by antigen capture immunoassay [41] and caliciviruses and astrovirus by RT-PCR [17]. All PCR products were confirmed by nucleic acid sequencing before being classed as positive for the caliciviruses or astrovirus, see Table 1. In order to limit costs, the prevalence of bacteria and parasites, which have been previously assessed in prospective case control studies, was determined for the cases only, where the cost of testing was met by existing hospital pathology expenditure as part of patient management. Age matched controls (within 3 months for patients less than 6 months of age, within 9 months for patients 6 months to 2 years of age, within 12 months for 2 to 5 year old patients and within 24 months for patients older than 5 years) without symptoms of AGE were selected from patients and their siblings presenting to hospital at a similar time (median 8 days, maximum 35 days) with non-diarrheal conditions such as respiratory infections, asthma or surgical admissions. Insufficient controls were available to permit sex matching. Samples from an apparent cluster of undiagnosed sporadic AGE cases enrolled during the summer of 2001 were chosen for the initial screening for the presence of novel viruses since we hypothesised this may represent an outbreak of a novel viral infectious agent even though we had no epidemiological information to link the cases.",

Briefly, the DOP 25-mer oligonucleotide primer consists of a 3\u2032 four base anchor region which binds to both strands of any nucleic acid at approximately 250 base intervals. Adjacent to this is a six base degenerate region that provides sufficient binding homology to stabilize the primer binding at low annealing temperatures and permit priming and amplification during the first cycling phase which utilizes low annealing temperatures (30\u00b0C), slow temperature ramping and long extension times (5 minutes). In the initial replication cycles, the DOP primer 5\u2032 tag region of 15 specific bases does not participate in the binding, but as replication proceeds, this sequence becomes incorporated at the termini of the amplified product, increasing the homology of the DOP primer to its target and therefore permitting the second cycling phase which utilizes higher annealing temperatures (50\u00b0C) and fast temperature ramping.",

Additional complete parvovirus sequences obtained from GenBank and used in the phylogenetic analyses (PAUP* 4, Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, Massachusetts) were as follows; NC_006148 snake parvovirus 1; NC_001701 goose parvovirus; NC_006147 Muscovy duck parvovirus; AF043303, AF063497, AF513851, AF513852, AF085716 Adeno-associated viruses; AY622943 human parvovirus 4; U86868 Chipmunk parvovirus; AF321230 Kilham rat virus; NC_001358 H-1 parvovirus; NC_001510 and DQ196317 minute virus of mice; NC_001630 mouse parvovirus 1; NC_001539 canine parvovirus; EF988660 Feline panleukopenia virus; NC_001718 porcine parvovirus; NC_001662 Aleutian mink disease parvovirus; AF221123 Pig-tailed macaque parvovirus; U26342 Simian parvovirus; NC_000883 human parvovirus B19; NC_006259 bovine parvovirus 2; DQ335247 and NC_001540 bovine parvovirus 1; AB158475 minute virus of canines and human bocavirus strains: St1 DQ000495; St2 DQ000496; WLL1 DQ778300; WLL2 EF441262; CU74 EF203922).

            "text": "DNA was extracted from 100 \u00b5l of a 10% (vol/vol) fecal specimen using the RNeasy Mini Kit system (QIAGEN) and amplified using a modification of the \u2018hanging drop\u2019 nested PCR method [17]. Current published primer sets to amplify HBoV [25],[26],[31],[32],[42] do not contain sufficient homology to successfully amplify products from HBoV2-W153. From an alignment of the NS1 gene sequences from HBoV2-W153 and HBoVs (DQ000495 and DQ000496), several primers (Sigma-Genosys, Castle Hill, Australia) targeting regions of shared sequence homology were chosen to amplify both HBoV2 and HBoV sequence. The primers were then tested in a variety of relevant combinations to ascertain which primer pairs achieved the most sensitive amplification in a nested PCR reaction, as measured by serial 10-fold dilutions of W153. Extracted nucleic acid (2.5 \u00b5l) was added to the primary amplification mix (25 \u00b5l) containing 1\u00d7 GeneAmp PCR Buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM of each dNTP 1.25 U AmpliTaq Gold and 10 pmol each of the primers Adel-OF (AGGTAAAACAAATATTGCAAAGGCCATAGTC) and Adel-OR (TGGGAGTTCTCTCCGTCCGTATC). The mix was overlaid with paraffin oil. The secondary amplification mix (25 ul) containing 1\u00d7 GeneAmp PCR Buffer, 5.5 mM MgCl2 (to yield 3.5 mM during secondary amplification), 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 1.25 U AmpliTaq Gold and 40 pmol each of the primers Adel-IF (AGGGTTTGTCTTTAACGATTGCAGACAAC) and Adel-IR (TATACACAGAGTCGTCAGCACTATGAG), was located in the tube cap, to be suspended by surface tension during the primary amplification cycles. After 15 min activation at 94\u00b0C, 40 cycles of amplification (94\u00b0C for 30 secs, 52\u00b0C for 30 secs, 72\u00b0C for 1.5 min) were performed using an unheated lid. Once completed, the tubes were microfuged briefly to introduce the secondary amplification mix, and after 15 min activation at 94\u00b0C, 60 cycles of amplification as above, were performed. Several negative samples were included in each batch to monitor for false positive reactions resulting from contamination. Amplification products were visualized using agarose gel electrophoresis for products of the predicted size; primary amplification product, 732 bp, and secondary nested product 518 bp. Products of 590 and 659 bp may also be present, the result of amplification between an outer and inner primer pair. Products of the predicted size were sequenced using Big Dye 3 terminator chemistry (ABI) to confirm the sequence identity. Sequence alignments, error correction and similarity analysis (Maximum likelihood) were performed using Kodon and PAUP* 4. Additional sequence similarity analysis was performed with SimPlot 3.2 (S C. Ray, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD) [43].",
