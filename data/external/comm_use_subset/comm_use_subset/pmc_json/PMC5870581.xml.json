            "text": "Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are conserved kinases regulating critical signaling pathways, such as apoptosis, differentiation, and immune response1. So far, four subgroups of MAPKs are identified, namely extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), ERK5, p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK)2, 3. Among them, ERK1/2 is activated by growth factors and mitogens, whereas p38 and JNK respond to cellular stresses and/or environmental stimuli2. MAPKs are activated by kinase cascades. In particular, JNK is activated by MAPK kinases 4(MKK4) or MKK7, which are phosphorylated by upstream MAPK kinase kinases4. JNK activation requires dual phosphorylation of Thr and Tyr within a conserved Thr-Pro-Tyr motif4. Active JNK phosphorylates c-Jun and other substrates to modulate their activities5. For example, phosphorylated c-Jun dimerizes with other transcription factors to form activator protein-1(AP-1) complex, thereby activating transcription of target genes6.",

We found that IBV infection activated the MKK7/JNK/c-Jun pathway in two mammalian cells (H1299 and Huh-7). IBV-induced JNK activation was mediated by MKK7, and required both its ATP binding and phosphorylation sites. We also showed that JNK-promoted apoptosis during IBV infection, and this activity was not mediated via c-Jun, but involved modulation of Bcl2.

Similarly, although ectopically expressed FLAG-MKK4 was highly phosphorylated, it actually reduced IBV-induced JNK phosphorylation compared with vector control. Although phos-JNK was only marginally increased in FLAG-MKK7-tranfected IBV-infected cells, phos-c-Jun level was significantly higher than vector control. Thus, overexpressed FLAG-MKK7 was functionally active and promoted phosphorylation of JNK and c-Jun induced by IBV infection.",

Wild-type MKK7-enhanced UVC-induced JNK phosphorylation by ~2.2-fold. Phos-JNK in MKK7-KM-transfected cells was slightly lower than vector control, so it might serve as a dominant negative mutant that inhibited activation of endogenous MKK7. Unexpectedly, although previously treated as constitutively active, the 3E mutant promoted UVC-induced JNK activation only similarly as wild-type MKK7. Also, unlike KM mutant, MKK7-3A-transfected cells had similar phos-JNK level as vector control, indicating that MKK7-3A was not dominant negative.\n",

We found that IBV-induced phosphorylation of MKK7, JNK, and c-Jun in the infected cells. Transfection of MKK7, but not MKK4, promoted IBV-induced phosphorylation of JNK and c-Jun. Using various MKK7 mutants, we showed that both ATP-binding activity and phosphorylation sites in MKK7 were required for optimal JNK activation in IBV-infected cells. Finally, gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies demonstrated that JNK phosphorylation plays a pro-apoptotic role during IBV infection. Thus, this study established a crucial involvement of JNK in regulating apoptosis induced by coronavirus infection.",

In one study, JNK inhibition was found to suppress apoptosis induced by overexpression of SARS-CoV protein 635. Previously we reported that hyper-phosphorylation of JNK was associated with increased apoptosis observed in IRE1-knockdown cells infected with IBV36, 37. Here we showed that overexpression of MKK7 or constitutively active JNK-promoted IBV-induced apoptosis, while inhibition or knockdown of JNK suppressed apoptosis, further supporting the pro-apoptotic role of JNK during IBV infection. Interestingly, our data suggested that, opposite to JNK, c-Jun actually promotes survival during IBV infection. This is not totally unexpected, because under certain situations the pro-apoptotic activities of JNK was mediated independent of c-Jun38. For example, both vinblastine and taxol induce JNK-dependent apoptosis with similar kinetics and induce c-Jun expression, but c-Jun phosphorylation is only observed in cells treated with vinblastine, but not taxol39. Also, DNA damage-induced apoptosis is mainly mediated by JNK-dependent phosphorylation of p53 or p739, 10. Thus, JNK-mediated apoptosis during IBV infection might also involve similar c-Jun-independent mechanisms.",
