This novel virus was initially reported in Hong Kong in 2012 [2], and then outbreak of PDCoV in pig herds was announced in the United States in early 2014 [3,4]. Since then, the detection of PDCoV was reported subsequently in many countries, such as South Korea, Canada, China, Vietnam and Japan [5\u20139]. PDCoV could cause acute diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration and even lead to death in nursing piglets, with the main lesion of villous atrophy in intestines [10\u201313]. The prevalence of PDCoV in Henan province of China was about 23.49%, and up to 36.43% in suckling piglets [14,15]. Infected sows usually did not show obviously clinical signs so that the PDCoV detection in sows was often ignored.",

Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), the re-emerged porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and the novel swine acute diarrhoea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), which all belong to genus Alphacoronavirus [16], have similar clinical symptoms with watery diarrhea, vomiting and dehydration, and similar pathological features with small intestinal enterocyte necrosis and villous atrophy in neonatal piglets. The co-infection of PDCoV with these viruses is common in clinic. However, PEDV could cause severe diarrhea and high mortality (up to 100%) in piglets worldwide [17]. The prevalence of PEDV infection was higher in cold season, especially in January and February, compared with that in warm seasons [18,19]. With TGEV infection, the mortality rate of neonatal piglets comes up to 100%, especially in piglets no more than 2 weeks of age [20,21]. SADS-CoV mainly infected newborn pigs which are less than 5 days of age, and the mortality rate was 90% [16].",
