Among viruses, viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) is affiliated to Novirhabdovirus genus, which is a member of the Rhabdoviridae family4. The six gene were contained in the VHSV genome of about 11 K bases and each of them coded nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), glycoprotein (G), nonstructural viral protein (NV), and RNA polymerase (L) in the following order 3\u2019-N-P-M-G-NV-L-5\u20194. Infection of VHSV results in contagious viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS) in diverse fish species regardless of their inhabitation; seawater or freshwater5.

Interestingly, judging from infection experiments using various scuticociliates plus identification outcome of 8 isolates acquired from olive flounders with symptom of ulcers and haemorrhages, Miamiensis avidus was suggested as the major aetiologic agent of scuticociliatosis because of high pathogenicity and mortality rate compared with other scuticociliates14,17.",

A huge quantity of genomic information from next generation sequencing (NGS) technique has been gradually increasing for the last few years, indicating that researchers could approach more comprehensive understanding view about genome of organisms than when they research a single gene level. With development of wide-sized analysis methods, it is not difficult to figure out change of gene expression level after any chemical treatment or environmental change. Recently, studies to identify large-scale genes were conducted in the olive flounder genome for researches about vaccine, gonadal development, and sex determination28\u201330. In particular, characterizing of immune-related genes was reported in olive flounder spleen tissue31. A lot of studies reported earlier were focused on gene expression analysis of single pathogen and specifically defined the expression pattern of limited genes32\u201336. Further, infection by two or more pathogens were reported in the olive flounder genome37,38. In order to solve these problem, we need plentiful genomic information to respond rapidly to multiple infection of pathogens. However, researches, which were comprehensively analysed about change of gene expression pattern by different type of pathogens, have not been reported in the olive flounder genome, so far.",

To gain the sufficient number of transcripts, twelve independent RNA samples acquired from normal and pathogen-infected olive flounder gill tissues were employed for construction of cDNA library. Then, these cDNA libraries were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq2500, generating the numbers of approximately 78.4 million, 65.2 million, and 45.7 million raw reads from three control samples, 44.0 million, 56.9 million, and 62.0 million raw reads from bacteria-infected samples, 41.2 million, 62.4 million, and 40.0 million raw reads from virus-infected samples, 39.6 million, 41.6 million, and 53.1 million raw reads from parasite-infected samples, respectively (Table 1).

Interestingly, 11,051 DEGs (89% of all DEGs) showed down-regulated pattern after viral infection. This phenomenon that global gene expression was decreased by viral infection must cause pathogenic disease by affecting immune-related gene expression level, finally leads to death. This view was supported by our findings (Supplementary Table 2), which showed expression decrease pattern of all genes in the immune-related GO terms. Especially, GO terms in viral infection group showed that all genes tend to be down-regulated after pathogen infection, indicating loss of resistance against pathogens by down-regulating the expression of immune-related genes.

The understanding of fish immune system structure and function is essential for the development of new technologies and products to improve productivity. The transcriptome analysis bring exposure to basic difference in expression profile of all pathogens in the host. These differences were due to nature of parasite, their mode of infection, antigenic variations and many other factors. Additionally, along with all above differences, disease progressed in host due to external surface variation of pathogens (viral, parasite and bacterial) and their appropriate recognition by host immune systems for making the basis to initiate microbial clearance44,45. Disease research requires the knowledge of important key factors like method of avoiding host immune surveillance, antigenic variations, subversion of immune responses through phagocyte and inhibition of cytokines and chemokines in common with pathogen infections (viral, bacterial and parasite)44,45. On the other hand, the disease progression was different in accordance to type of pathogens. In case of viral infection, understanding of complement inhibition and blockade of cellular immunity is the most important, while parasite and bacterial infections required knowledge and research of innate pathway and acquired immunity44,45. Our analysis indicates the complexity and difference of expression profile could be due to all the above reasons. In addition, important basis of fish vaccine is depending on innate and adaptive immunity46. There were many vaccine types which depend upon antigens, live microorganisms or specific DNA segment of pathogens or polyvalent vaccines. All above vaccines required complete knowledge of pathogenicity and deep research of efficacy47. Our study clearly indicates about various immune and antigenic genes which can be chosen for pathways analysis and use for therapeutic agents or as some vaccine candidates (Supplementary Table 2).",

The down-regulation of gene could sequentially influence on expression of various molecules positioned in down-streams in metabolic pathway. In this view, CD13, which is one of down-regulated genes by infection of three pathogens on common, was reported to inactivate interleukin 849. Representative function of this cytokine is to induce migration of neutrophils and granulocytes toward infection site. In addition, absence of CD13 considerably improves cross-presentation of soluble antigen via regulation of receptor-mediated uptake75. Thus, decrease of CD13 expression consequentially might activate immune response in the olive flounder. MTCP1 gene induced malignant T-cell transformation59 and was related in the leukemogenic process of mature T-cell proliferation61. This gene was thought to maintain balance of immune response by T-cell. The innate immune system mediates the initial inflammatory response by pathogen infection or injury. For rapid response against external pathogens, infected cells secrete various cytokines to induce effector cells and complements. The type I collagen, which is comprised by proteins coded from COL1A1 and COL1A2, was involved in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the innate immune system. However, two genes (COL1A1 and COL1A2) showed decreasing expression pattern after infection in our study. Given sampling period (7 days from infection) of olive flounders for this study, it might be explained that the adaptive immune response was activated in the olive flounder genome.

The size-selected 250\u2013300 bp cDNA fragments were loaded on a 3% Nusieve 3:1 (Lonza) agarose gel for libraries. The cDNA fragments were recovered using QIAEX II gel extraction reagents (Qiagen), and amplified using Phusion DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) for 14 PCR cycles. The amplified libraries were purified by AMPure XP beads, their concentration and product sizes were assessed on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Sequencing of paired-end libraries were conducted with the Illumina HiSeq2500, (2 \u00d7 100 nucleotide read length).",

Mapping of Sequences were conducted against the Olive flounder draft genome (Submitted at present) using TopHat v2.0.9 with default options for paired-end sequences. Transcripts expression were estimated using the Cufflinks program v2.1.1. Total sequencing reads were subjected to preprocessing as follows: adapter trimming was performed using cutadapt with default parameters, and quality trimming (Q30) was performed using FastQC with default parameters. Processed reads were mapped to the Olive flounder draft genome (Submitted at present) using tophat and cufflink with default parameters76. The differential analysis was performed using Cuffdiff76 using default parameters. Further, the FPKM values from Cuffdiff were normalized and quantitated using R Package Tag Count Comparison (TCC)77 to determine statistical significance (e.g., P values) and differential expression (e.g., fold changes.). Through these statistics analysis, we sorted DEGs having p < 0.05 and showed them as results.",
