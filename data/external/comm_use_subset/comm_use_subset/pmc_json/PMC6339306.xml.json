            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus and the family Coronaviridae, is an enveloped single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus [1, 2]. PEDV is a highly effective pathogen responsible for causing porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), a disease characterized by severe and acute watery diarrhea, dehydration and vomiting that results in high mortality rate of one-week-old piglets [3, 4]. Since the first appearance in England in the early 1970s, outbreaks of PED have been reported in several European and Asian countries [5, 6]. PED was first reported in China in 1973, followed by a large-scale outbreak of PED in December 2010 that led to heavy economic loss [7, 8]. Therefore, it is of great importance to properly and routinely monitor PEDV.",

            "text": "Unfortunately, due to the fact that PEDV and a different Alphacoronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), have the same epidemiological and clinical features. These two viruses have led to complications in clinical diagnosis. Therefore, it is of great importance to develop differential laboratory tests [9, 10]. To date, several methods including RT-PCR [11], separation identification [12], serological method [13], enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [14] and colloidal gold method [15\u201317] have been used to detect the PEDV antigen. Although RT-PCR serves as a good standard due to its high sensitivity and accuracy, this method relies heavily on sophisticated equipment and expensive apparatus. Several other common methods are also not suitable for on-site diagnosis due to the following reasons. Separation identification means to isolate PEDV in Vero cell cultures from the small intestine of a PEDV infected piglet. It is a classical method for PEDV detection, but it is time-consuming for it needs at least one week. The serological method can only detect PEDV antibody. However, whether the PEDV antibody is from vaccine infection or wild infection is still unknown. ELISA is a cheap and simple approach for PEDV detection, however, it involves long incubation period, multiple washing steps, and the assistance of a microplate reader. In contrast, recently developed immunochromatographic assay (ICA) is much more applicable for on-site diagnosis of PEDV for it is simple, sensitive, specific and can be operated without training. Therefore, this method could be useful for monitoring the infection of PED [18\u201320].",

The strain was harvested from a suspension of minced small intestine from infected neonatal pigs in south of Korea [21]. Considering regional differences in strains, it might not be the best choice for PEDV detection in south of China. A PEDV strain CHYJ130330 was isolated from the fecal specimen of a 3-day-old dead piglet in March 2013 on a commercial swine farm in Guangdong Province in the south of China [22]. In this study, we prepared monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) using cell surface fluorescence immunosorbent assay (CSFIA) [10], a simple and rapid method for selecting positive hybridoma cells. Fourteen mAbs against this PEDV strain were prepared. Relying on signals emitted from gold nanoparticles labeled mAb (AuNPs-mAb), a new ICA was developed for sensitive, specific and on-site detection of PEDV in swine stool in China. A comparison between RT-PCR, BIONOTE test strip and the ICA was performed to confirm the applicability of the newly developed ICA for on-site PEDV detection.",

Gray value corresponding to signal from the red T-line was obtained using image J [23\u201325]. The assembly of the new ICA was as follows: The new ICA was made of PVC plate, NC membrane, sample pad, conjugate pad and absorbent pad. PBS (0.015 M, pH 7.4) diluted mAb (0.875 mg/mL) and goat anti-mouse IgG (1 mg/mL) were dispensed on specific areas of NC membrane called the test line (T-line) and calibration line (C-line) using an automatic dispenser at a volume of 1 \u03bcL/cm. The NC membrane was dried at 37 \u00b0C and saved for later use. The AuNPs-mAb was loaded onto the conjugate pad using an automatic dispense system set to 5.0 \u03bcL/cm and then dried at 37 \u00b0C. The pretreatment of sample pad involved soaking in PBS (0.015 M, pH 7.4, containing 2.5% (w/v) sucrose, 2% (w/v) BSA, and 1% (w/v) Tween-20) and drying at room temperature and then at 37 \u00b0C. The PVC plate acted as the holder of the new ICA, onto which sample pad, conjugate pad, NC membrane and absorbent pad were pasted with an overlap of 2 mm between each part. After the assembly was completed, the new ICA was cut into 3.8-mm-wide and 60-mm-long strips using a programmable HGS201 strip cutter and kept in a suitable plastic cassette for further use. A fully assembled new ICA is shown in Fig. 2a.",

To select PEDV mAb pairs with high sensitivity and specificity, a double antibody sandwich ELISA was used.

On the other hand, if too small, the red signal of T and C line was weak and it was not easy to observe it. Considering both, the AuNPs of 40 nm were found to be the optimal AuNPs in this study. The spray volume of AuNPs-mAb was also optimized. If the spray volume was too high, it was easy to produce nonspecific adsorption. However, if it was too low, the result would have low sensitivity. 5 \u03bcL/cm was selected considering both sides.",

When detecting PEDV in PBT, the LOD was 0.47 \u03bcg/mL (5.9 \u00d7 103 TCID50/mL) and the liner detection range was 0.625\u201310 \u03bcg/mL (7.8 \u00d7 103 -105 TCID50/mL). The PEDV concentration in cultured PEDV was pretty high. Therefore, it can be used to detect cultured PEDV. The data obtained by the new ICA were compared with those obtained by both RT-PCR and commercial strip. It has been described that RT-PCR is the most sensitive and trustworthy method for PEDV detection. In this study, the commercial strip was included for comparison purpose. The data analyzed in the present work showed that the total coincidence of BIONOTE test strip to RT-PCR was 62.3% while that to the new ICA was 74.07%, indicating that the new ICA was more comparable to RT-PCR than commercial test strip. These results suggested that the new ICA was suitable for monitoring PEDV.",

In addition, the new ICA exhibited high specificity with little interference from swine stool, and could achieve recoveries ranging from 90 to 110.27% in spiked samples. Compared to RT-PCR and ELISA, the new ICA does not require sophisticated instruments and training. Relative to commercial test strips, the new ICA provides more accurate detection of PEDV in swine stool samples from south of China. Our study highlighted the potential of the on-site application of this new ICA for diagnosis and prevention of PED.",
