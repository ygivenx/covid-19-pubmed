Mosquito-borne flaviviruses, such as dengue, Zika, and West Nile viruses (WNV), are responsible for a variety of debilitating pathologies, including hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, flaccid paralysis, and microcephaly. WNV alone has accounted for over 20,000 cases of neuroinvasive disease in the United States since it emerged in New York City in 1999 [1]. Human cases of WNV have been documented on all continents except Antarctica making it the most widespread viral cause of encephalitis (reviewed in [2]) and an important pathogen for study. In addition, a robust mouse model makes it an excellent system to study arboviral pathogenesis.",

Three structural proteins make up the virion: capsid (C), premembrane/membrane (prM/M), and envelope (E). C protein packages the genome into a nucleocapsid, which buds into the ER membrane containing E and prM and forms an immature particle (reviewed in [3]). E and prM proteins are subsequently glycosylated by the host cell machinery. Fully mature particles are formed when prM is cleaved by host cell proteases in the Golgi, resulting in M and E in the viral envelope and structural rearrangement of the particle, prior to release from the host cell [4].",

The very first cells infected by WNV are currently unknown although early cell targets in mouse models are keratinocytes [11] and presumably macrophages and dendritic cells, which are infected by flaviviruses in immunocompromised mice early after infection [12, 13]. In cell culture studies, flaviviruses and alphaviruses derived from mosquito cells have a greater infectivity for dendritic cells compared to virus derived from vertebrate cells due to the interaction of the viral proteins with C-type lectins (e.g. DC-SIGN) [9, 14\u201316]. Furthermore, this interaction of mosquito cell-derived virus with cultured dendritic cells results in a dampened antiviral response with lower production of Type I interferon for WNV [15, 17] and alphaviruses [16]. In contrast to the cell culture studies, we previously showed in mice that mosquito cell-derived WNV elicits earlier, but similar levels, of type I interferon in serum compared to mammalian cell-derived WNV [15]. The explanation for the discrepancies between the cell culture and animal studies remains unknown. Finally, early after inoculation and before WNV production, WNV derived from mammalian cells exhibits greater viral spread from the inoculation site to the draining lymph node and blood in mice, compared to WNV derived from mosquito cells [15].",

Replicon genomes are deleted for some or all of the structural protein genes, which are often replaced with a reporter gene. Replicon genomes can be packaged into replicon particles (RPs) by providing the structural proteins in trans. Since RPs resemble authentic virus particles, but are unable to produce progeny virions, they are valuable for investigating the first round of cell infection from binding and entry to replication of viral RNA. RPs for WNV have been used in cell culture and animal studies, including vaccine development, antiviral screens, tropism, and immune studies [9, 11, 18\u201324].

Furthermore, the mosquito cell-derived RPs were compared in vivo to mammalian cell-derived RPs in their spread from the inoculation site and replication in target tissues. We discovered that mammalian cell-derived RPs spread from the inoculation site to distant lymphoid tissues earlier and to higher levels than mosquito cell-derived RPs. This greater spread of mammalian cell-derived inoculum at early time points was confirmed using infectious WNV derived from mammalian and mosquito cells. Thus, our West Nile RPs mimic arboviral inoculum and are an essential tool to investigate early immune responses and to characterize initial tropism in vertebrates. Importantly, this work suggests that to accurately simulate the arboviral inoculum for studies of early infection, arthropod cell-derived virus or RPs should be used.",

For our first attempts to package WNV RPs in C6/36 cells (C6/36-RPs), we followed previously published methods for packaging RPs in BHK cells [21]. Briefly, in vitro transcribed RNA derived from the WNV replicon vector (WNV replicon RNA) was electroporated into C6/36 cells. After incubation for 24 hours, the cells were electroporated with in vitro transcribed RNA derived from the packaging vector (packaging RNA). Culture medium was harvested 48 and 72 hours after the second electroporation and titrated by IFA. This method yielded no detectable RPs. We observed high levels of cell death after electroporation of C6/36 cells, which reduced the chances of transfecting one cell with both RNA constructs. Thus, we developed a packaging method to reduce electroporation-induced cytotoxicity and efficiently deliver WNV replicon RNA into the C6/36 cells. Our method consisted of inoculating C6/36 cells at a high MOI with BHK-RPs containing WNV replicon genomes and then electroporating these cells 24 hours later with packaging RNA. This novel packaging method produced the first known mosquito cell-derived RPs and yielded increasing titers from 102 RPs/mL on day 2 to 104 RPs/mL on day 5 post-electroporation (Fig 1). While these results were encouraging, higher concentrations of mosquito cell-derived RPs are needed to mimic the arboviral inoculum deposited by mosquitoes [37].",

For each buffer, C6/36 cells were electroporated with WNV replicon RNA. Cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity 4 through 9 days post-electroporation. Cells electroporated in cytomix produced the highest luciferase activity through 8 days and resulted in 10-fold higher luciferase activity at 4\u20136 days post-electroporation compared to cells electroporated in PBS or Ingenio (Fig 2A).

Different ratios of RNA to lipofection reagent were tested according to manufacturers\u2019 recommendations. Luciferase activity was an indicator of transfection efficiency. All transfection conditions resulted in luciferase expression. C6/36 cells transfected with FlyFectin exhibited the highest luciferase activity, and transfection was not appreciably different at the various RNA to reagent ratios (Fig 2B). Furthermore, luciferase values were comparable (approximately 105 RLU) for electroporation with cytomix and lipofection with FlyFectin although we did not conduct a direct side-by-side comparison for these two transfection methods. Since lipofection offers a smaller scale experimental procedure, allowing for more efficient optimization of other parameters, we used FlyFectin in subsequent experiments at an RNA to reagent ratio of 1 \u03bcg RNA to 4 \u03bcL FlyFectin. Transfection efficiency for these parameters was quantified using a VEE replicon RNA that expresses high levels of GFP under the subgenomic promoter. Both VEE and WNV efficiently replicate in C6/36 cells [28, 38]. The VEE system was used because it is more specific and sensitive than using an antibody to detect cells transfected with WNV replicon in C6/36 cells, which are highly autofluorescent. The percentage of GFP-positive cells was determined by flow cytometry, resulting in an average transfection efficiency of 0.2+/-0.04% (Fig 2C). A similar transfection efficiency of 0.3\u00b10.05% was determined using fluorescence microscopy. The low transfection efficiency warranted further optimization to produce RPs.",

Peak viral replication and translation in C6/36 cells following either RP inoculation or transfection of WNV replicon RNA using FlyFectin was measured by assaying for luciferase activity. In cells inoculated with RPs, luciferase activity began by 12 hpi at 103 RLU and increased to 107 RLU through 5 days pi (Fig 2D). In comparison, cells lipofected with WNV replicon RNA exhibited 10-fold higher luciferase activity (104 RLU) at 12 hours post-lipofection, but greater than 100-fold lower luciferase activity (104 to 105 RLU) 3\u20135 days post-lipofection. These results suggest that the method of WNV replicon delivery into cells influences the kinetics and magnitude of replicon replication and translation. A delay between delivery of the replicon and packaging RNAs may enhance RP production by allowing time for WNV replicon RNA amplification, thereby increasing cellular concentrations of WNV replicon RNA and non-structural proteins. Accumulation of these proteins and replicon RNA could also prevent excessive production of empty subviral particles, which lack nucleocapsid, and ensure physiologically relevant ratios of infectious to noninfectious particles for use in vivo.",

The 48 and 72 hour delays produced equivalent titers by day 3 post-lipofection with peak titers of 5.4x106 RPs/mL/day (48 hour delay on 4 days post-lipofection) and 5x106 RPs/mL/day (72 hour delay 6 days post-lipofection).

Thus, we measured the yield of RPs packaged in C6/36 cells after inoculating BHK-RPs at an MOI of 0.05, 0.5, or 1 and transfecting with packaging RNA 48 hours later. C6/36-RPs were packaged through 10 days post-lipofection, and peak production was observed between 4 and 6 days post-lipofection for all three MOI conditions (Fig 3B). The greatest C6/36-RP concentration was 2x107 RPs/mL, which is sufficient to inoculate mice in the footpad with 10 \u03bcl of 105 RPs, the median dose of WNV inoculated by Culex tarsalis mosquitoes [37]. The MOI of BHK-RPs did not correlate with production of C6/36-RPs.

E protein content of C6/36-RP stocks was below the limit of detection of the assay (<0.5 \u03bcg/mL), resulting in a ratio of <8x10-10 \u03bcg E:GE, which was comparable to C6/36 cell-derived WNV stock at 4x10-10 \u03bcg E:GE (Table 1). The BHK-RP stock exhibited a high E protein to GE ratio of 295x10-10, which was 7-fold higher than WNV derived from BHK cells, suggesting the presence of more empty subviral particles in BHK-RPs. In summary, the characteristics of our C6/36-RP stock were similar to WNV stocks, validating the use of C6/36-RPs in vivo as a model of WNV inoculum from a mosquito.",

We compared the initial tropism and spread of RPs derived from mammalian cells and mosquito cells by assaying for luciferase activity in various tissues of mice from 3 to 48 hpi. After inoculation in the left rear footpad, luciferase activity was detected in the ipsilateral footpad skin and popliteal lymph node as early as 3 hpi for both BHK-RPs and C6/36-RPs (Fig 6A and 6B), demonstrating that the RPs had entered cells and initiated translation of the reporter. No significant differences were observed in the ipsilateral footpad skin through 48 hpi for mice inoculated with the two different RP inocula. At 3 hpi, we observed significantly higher luciferase activity in the draining popliteal lymph node for BHK-RPs, but at all other time points, there were no significant differences in luciferase activity in the draining popliteal and inguinal lymph nodes for mice inoculated with the different RP inocula (Fig 6B and 6C). In contrast, greater differences were observed for distant lymphoid tissues. There was significantly higher luciferase activity in the spleen for BHK-RPs from 3 through 48 hpi compared to C6/36-RPs (Fig 6E). Furthermore, luciferase activity was only observed at 12 and 24 hpi in the spleen for C6/36-RPs. In addition, there was luciferase activity in the popliteal and inguinal lymph nodes on the contralateral leg of mice at 24 hpi only in mice inoculated with the BHK-RPs (Fig 6F and 6G). There was no spread to the footpad skin on the contralateral leg for either RP inocula (S2 Fig). In summary, both the BHK-RPs and C6/36-RPs replicated in skin at the inoculation site, draining lymph nodes, and spleen, but there was more rapid and greater spread of the BHK-RPs to distant lymphoid tissues, suggesting that either RP-infected cells or RPs from the inoculum are moving through the blood to distant tissue sites.",

In contrast, replicon RNA was observed as early as 3 hpi for both RP inocula, but there was significantly higher levels of replicon RNA in blood of mice inoculated with BHK-RPs compared to C6/36-RPs from 3 to 12 hpi (Fig 6H). Replicon RNA levels were 160-fold (3 hours), 60-fold (6 hours), and 10-fold (12 hours) greater in the blood of mice inoculated with BHK-RPs compared to C6/36-RPs.

These stocks had less than 2-fold difference in their GE:IU ratios (Table 1), allowing us to directly compare both infectious virus by plaque assay and genome levels by qRT-PCR in blood and tissues. Mice were inoculated in the left rear footpad, and tissues were harvested at 3 and 6 hpi, which is prior to viral production [28, 35]. At these early time points, infectious virus is from the inoculum, and viral RNA is from the inoculum and/or infected cells. Significantly higher infectious viral loads in the footpads and draining popliteal lymph nodes were detected in mice inoculated with WNV-BHK compared to WNV-C6/36 (Fig 7A and 7B), suggesting that WNV-BHK enters cells less efficiently at the site of inoculation. This difference was dramatically reduced when the tissues were assayed for WNV RNA (Fig 7E and 7F), supporting the conclusion that WNV-C6/36 enters cells more readily and most of the viral RNA in these tissues was from infected cells in the eclipse phase for mice inoculated with WNV-C6/36. Infectious virus from the inoculum was detected in serum in 3 of 4 mice at both 3 hpi (average of 103.4 PFU/ml) and 6 hpi (average of 102.7 PFU/ml) for WNV-BHK, but no infectious virus (< 50 PFU/ml) was detected in serum for WNV-C6/36 in any of the mice (Fig 7D). In addition, greater levels of WNV RNA were observed for WNV-BHK in whole blood compared to WNV-C6/36: over 500-fold more at 3 hpi (p-value<0.05) and 14-fold more at 6 hpi (Fig 7H). Systemic spread to the spleen occurred earlier in mice inoculated with WNV-BHK compared to WNV-C6/36 (Fig 7C and 7G) with significantly higher levels of WNV RNA (over 90-fold) at 3 hpi for WNV-BHK compared to WNV-C6/36. Taken together these data suggest that WNV-BHK inoculum enters the blood more readily than WNV-C6/36. Furthermore, these studies with infectious virus confirm our results with WNV RPs, demonstrating greater spread of the inoculum to distant tissues for the mammalian cell-derived compared to mosquito cell-derived virus and replicon particles.",

Here we successfully produced and characterized high titer stocks of RPs derived from C6/36 mosquito cells. When inoculated into mice, the mosquito cell-derived RPs showed reduced systemic spread from the inoculation site in comparison to mammalian cell-derived RPs. These results underscore the importance of arthropod cell-derived RPs to accurately mimic the arthropod inoculum when studying early events in arbovirus infection.",

We found that C6/36 cells were not as robust during electroporation; thus, we developed a protocol by which replicon RNA is delivered via RP inoculation, and packaging vector RNA is delivered via lipofection. Although previous studies optimizing RP packaging in mammalian cells observed benefits from delivering the packaging vector 24 hours after delivery of the replicon RNA [26], we found it was optimal to deliver packaging vector RNA 48 or 72 hours following delivery of replicon RNA (Fig 3A). Numerous variables could account for these different results. For example, inherent differences between WNV replication within mosquito cells compared to mammalian cells may play a role. The growth rate of WNV is faster in mammalian cells compared to mosquito cells [28], and a longer delay may be required to allow for adequate replicon replication in mosquito cells. In addition, we delivered replicon RNA by RP inoculation and packaging vector RNA by lipofection, which is quite different from the double electroporation method used for BHK cells. Thus, differences in methodology may also account for the optimal delay between the replicon and packaging RNA delivery.",

We produced RPs through 10 days often with minimal decrease in titer whereas the previous study producing RPs in BHK cells using double electroporations observed severe cytopathic effect or a large reduction in RP production after 3 days post-electroporation [26]. These same investigators produced sustained RP production in BHK cells through 10 days post-induction by using a packaging cell line that selected for and maintained the WNV structural protein genes [25]. We propose that the sustained RP production in C6/36 cells in our system is most likely due to minimal cytopathology in mosquito cells.",

One explanation is that the transfection efficiency for lipofection of the packaging RNA is very low, resulting in very few cells with both replicon and packaging vector. These few cells will produce RPs, which will then infect other cells in the culture, delivering replicon genome to the limited cells with packaging RNA. The actual MOI would quickly rise, masking any difference between MOIs upon initial inoculation.",

            "text": "Since flaviviruses can produce several types of particles, such as mature, immature and empty subviral particles [4, 39\u201344], we characterized our mosquito cell-derived RP stock to ensure that it resembled infectious WNV for several key characteristics. This is especially important for animal studies because immature, non-infectious and empty subviral particles have reduced or no infectivity, but they can still interact with cellular receptors, stimulate the immune response [9, 45\u201347, 49], and potentially confound results if present in excessive quantities. In our RP and WNV stocks, prM was fully cleaved, indicating that minimal immature particles were present. We used genome equivalents to infectious unit as a measure of non-infectious to infectious particles and again WNV and RPs were similar within a single cell line. The GE:IU ratios were comparable to other published studies for WNV [15, 50], but lower than for dengue and yellow fever viruses [51, 52]. Finally, we used E protein content to genome equivalents as a measure of total particles to particles containing genome (the latter encompasses infectious, non-infectious and immature particles); a high ratio indicates more empty subviral particles. This ratio was similar for the RPs and WNV derived from C6/36 cells. In contrast, the ratio was 7-fold greater for BHK-RPs compared to WNV derived from BHK cells and 39-fold greater compared to C6/36-RPs, suggesting that BHK-RPs have greater amounts of empty subviral particles. It is possible that the higher transfection efficiency in BHK cells compared to C6/36 cells results in more cells singly transfected with the packaging vector, which would produce more empty subviral particles. For the characteristics measured in this study, C6/36-RPs were very similar to full-length WNV, supporting their use to mimic an arbovirus inoculum transmitted by mosquitoes. On the other hand, it is important to consider that the use of cell culture-derived virus or replicons is still an artificial system and may not fully represent virus particles produced in a mosquito or vertebrate hosts.",

This is consistent with our previous studies using WNV in which viral loads were first detected in contralateral skin at 2\u20133 dpi (1\u20132 days later than spleen and contralateral lymph nodes) [35].

This was indeed the case; we observed significantly higher amounts of replicon RNA present in the blood of mice inoculated with BHK-RPs up to 12 hpi compared to mice inoculated with C6/36-RPs (Fig 7). In addition, the replicon RNA in the blood does not appear to be due to infected cells since we did not find evidence of RP-infected cells trafficking through the blood at the limit of our luciferase assay (Fig 6). One caveat of these RP studies is that we inoculated equivalent infectious units in order to directly compare the luciferase activity of RP-infected tissues, which necessitated inoculation of different GEs. In fact, four-fold more GEs of BHK-RPs than C6/36-RPs were inoculated (Table 1), which would affect replicon genome levels. This does not, however, account for the higher levels of replicon RNA in the blood for BHK-RPs (160-fold difference compared to C6/36-RPs at 3 hpi). Furthermore, we confirmed these results, using WNV stocks that were less than 2-fold different in GE:IU ratios with BHK-WNV (GE:IU = 57) having a lower ratio than C6/36-WNV (GE:IU = 75) (Table 1). Like the study with RPs, the mammalian cell-derived WNV exhibited greater spread from the site of inoculation to the draining lymph node and into the blood compared to the mosquito cell-derived WNV (Fig 7). These results are also consistent with our previously published studies, which demonstrated earlier spread with BHK-WNV compared to C6/36-WNV although morbidity and mortality were not altered late in infection [15].",

            "text": "Overall, our data in mice support a model that free particles in the inoculum are trafficking to the draining lymph node and entering the blood to infect distant sites, and mammalian cell-derived particles travel from the site of inoculation more than mosquito cell-derived particles. The exact mechanism responsible for these differences in spread from the inoculation site is unknown. One likely explanation is the glycosylation differences of the E protein of the virus particles derived from vertebrate versus invertebrate cells. Flaviviruses derived from mosquito cells have high-mannose glycans [9, 10], which may enhance particle binding to cells and/or the extracellular matrix at the site of inoculation, limiting the number of particles that enter the lymphatics or blood and spread to the draining lymph nodes and spleen. Another possibility is that the glycosylation differences alter cell tropism of the particles. Cell culture studies have shown that more dendritic cells are infected with WNV derived from mosquito cells compared to WNV derived from mammalian cells [9, 15], but such an effect in vivo is unclear. Our current studies in mice showed that equivalent replication (as measured by luciferase expression) occurs in the skin at the inoculation site through 48 hpi and in the draining lymph node 6\u201348 hpi for the RPs derived from mammalian and mosquito cells. There was, however, significantly greater replication in the draining lymph node at 3 hpi for the BHK-RP compared to C6/36-RPs, which is due to either movement of infected cells and/or free RPs trafficking to the lymph node. Based on the previous cell culture studies, one would expect more infected dendritic cells trafficking to the lymph node for mosquito cell-derived RPs, but this was not observed. Finally, empty subviral particles are produced in flavivirus-infected mammalian and mosquito cell culture and in mice [39\u201343], and it is possible that variable amounts of these particles might influence spread (e.g. by stimulating immune cells and changing the microenvironment). This is an important consideration for the RP studies, in which the BHK-RPs had 39-fold greater E:GE ratios compared to C6/36-RPs (Table 1). We cannot rule-out this possible factor; however, we still observed greater spread with BHK-WNV, which possessed only 10-fold greater E:GE ratio compared to C6/36-WNV. While empty particles may be a contributing factor to spread of a flavivirus inoculum, it is unlikely to explain all of the differences.",
