The human health concern was identified as environmentally derived antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) that may adversely affect human health (e.g., reduced efficacy in clinical antibiotic use, more serious or prolonged infection) either by direct exposure of patients to antibiotic-resistant pathogen(s) or by exposure of patients to resistance determinants and subsequent horizontal gene transfer (HGT) to bacterial pathogen(s) on or within a human host, as conceptualized in Figure 1. ARB hazards develop in the environment as a result of direct uptake of antibiotic-resistant genes (ARG) via various mechanisms (e.g., mobile genetic elements such as plasmids, integrons, gene cassettes, or transposons) and/or proliferate under environmental selection caused by antibiotics and coselecting agents such as biocides, toxic metals, and nanomaterial stressors (Qiu et al. 2012; Taylor et al. 2011), or by gene mutations (Gillings and Stokes 2012). Depending on the presence of recipient bacteria, these processes generate either environmental antibiotic-resistant bacteria (eARB) or pathogens with antibiotic-resistance (pARB) (Figure 1).",

In this review we focus on how to apply HHRA to the risk of infections with pathogenic ARB because they are an increasing cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly in developing regions (Grundmann et al. 2011). An antimicrobial-resistant microorganism has the ability to multiply or persist in the presence of an increased level of an antimicrobial agent compared with a susceptible counterpart of the same species. For this review, we limited the resistant group of microorganisms to bacteria and therefore to antibiotic resistance, an area in which the term \u201cantibiotic\u201d is used synonymously with \u201cantibacterial.\u201d It is important to understand the contribution that the environment has on the development of resistance in both human and animal pathogens because therapeutic-resistant infections may lead to longer hospitalization, longer treatment time, failure of treatment therapy, and the need for treatment with more toxic or costly antibiotics, as well as an increased likelihood of death.",

A particular area of focus in terms of exposure in a community setting has been antibiotic use in livestock production and the presence of eARB and pARB in food of animal origin. In 2011, the Codex Alimentarius Commission [established in 1963 by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) to harmonize international food standards, guidelines, and codes of practice to protect the health of consumers and ensure fair trade practices in the food trade] released guidelines on processes and methodologies for applying risk analysis methods to foodborne antimicrobial resistance related to the use of antimicrobials in veterinary medicine and agriculture (Codex Alimentarius Commission 2011).",

The environmental consequences from the use and release of antibiotics from various sources (K\u00fcmmerer 2009a, 2009b) and the HGT of antibiotic-resistance genes (ARG) between indigenous environmental and pathogenic bacteria and their resistance determinants (B\u00f6rjesson et al. 2009; Chagas et al. 2011; Chen et al. 2011; Cummings et al. 2011; Forsberg et al. 2012; Gao et al. 2012; Qiu et al. 2012) has yet to be quantified, but is of global concern (Finley et al. 2013; WHO 2012a). The genetic elements encoding for the ability of microorganisms to withstand the effects of an antimicrobial agent are located either chromosomally or extrachromosomally and may be associated with mobile genetic elements such as plasmids, integrons, gene cassettes, or transposons, thereby enabling horizontal and vertical transmission from resistant to previously susceptible strains. From an HHRA point of view, the emergence of ARB in source and drinking water (De Boeck et al. 2012; Isozumi et al. 2012; Shi et al. 2013) further highlights the need to place these emerging environmental risks in perspective. Yet, assessing the range of environmental contributions to antibiotic resistance may not only be complicated by lack of quantitative data but also by the need to coordinate efforts across different agencies that may have jurisdiction over environmental risks versus human and animal health.",

Further, the use of antimicrobials in crops, animals, and humans provides a continued entry of antibiotics to the environment, along with possible novel genes and ARB. A summary of the fate, transport, and persistence of antibiotics and resistance genes after land application of waste from food animals that received antibiotics or following outflow to surface water from sewage treatment has emphasized the need to better understand the environmental mechanisms of genetic selection and gene acquisition as well as the dynamics of resistance genes (resistome) and their bacterial hosts (Chee-Sanford et al. 2009; Crtryn 2013). For example, the presence of antibiotic residues in water from pharmaceutical manufacturers in certain parts of the world (Fick et al. 2009), ponds receiving intensive animal wastes (Barkovskii et al. 2012), aquaculture waters (Shah et al. 2012), and sewage outfalls (Dolejska et al. 2011) are important sources, among others, leading to the presence of ARG in surface waters. In particular, the comparatively high concentrations of antibiotics found in the effluent of pharmaceutical production plants have been associated with an increased presence of ARG in surface waters (Kristiansson et al. 2011; Li et al. 2009, 2010). Most recently, 100% sequence identity of ARG from a diverse set of clinical pathogens and common soil bacteria (Forsberg et al. 2012) has highlighted the potential for environmental HGT between eARB and pARB.",

This exceedingly rare event that results in the transfer of a novel (to clinically important bacteria) resistance gene from a harmless environmental bacterium to a pathogen need happen only once if a human is the recipient of the novel pARB. Unlike the emergence of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and similar viruses where, in hindsight, the risk factors are now well understood (Swift et al. 2007), the conditions for a \u201cone-time event\u201d could occur in a range of \u201cnormal\u201d habitats. Once developed, the resistant bacterium/gene has a possibility to spread between humans around the world [such as seen with the spread of NDM-1 (New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1) resistance (Wilson and Chen 2012)], promoted by our use of antibiotics. Although it seems very difficult to quantify the probability for such a rare event (including assessing the probability for where it will happen and when), there is considerable value in trying to identify the risk factors (such as pointing out critical environments for HGT to occur, or identifying pharmaceutical exposure levels that could cause selection pressures and hence increase the abundance of a given gene). After such a critical HGT event, we may then move into a more quantitative kind of HHRA.",

The consensus of workshop participants was that management could best be applied at points of antibiotic manufacturing and use, agricultural operations including aquaculture, and wastewater treatment plants (Pruden et al. 2013). Assessing the relative impact of managing any particular part of a system is hampered by the lack of knowledge on the relative importance of each part of the system for the overall risk. That is, as recently stated by the WHO (2013), \u201cAMR is a complex problem driven by many interconnected factors so single, isolated interventions have little impact and coordinated actions are required.\u201d Hence, a starting point for an assessment of environmental antibiotic-resistance risks intended to aid risk management is a theoretical risk assessment pathway based on a) local surveillance data on the occurrence and types of antibiotics used in human medicine, crop production, animal husbandry, and companion animals; b) information on ARG and ARB in the various environmental compartments (in particular, soil and aquatic systems including drinking water); and c) related disease information. This assessment should be amended by discussion with the relevant stakeholders, which requires extensive risk communication and could form part of the multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach discussed in detail below. As a result of the workshop, Pruden et al. (2013) also advocate coupling environmental management and mitigation plans with targeted surveillance and monitoring efforts in order to judge the relative impact and success of the interventions.",

Thus, the key issue is how experimental and modeling approaches can be used to derive estimates. Furthermore, hazard concentration, time, and environmental compartment-dependent aspects should also be taken into account. First, the current understanding is that for non-mutation-derived antibiotic resistance to develop in environmental bacteria (including pathogens that may actively grow outside of hosts) to develop into eARB/pARB (Figure 1, processes 1 and 2), a selective pressure (i.e., presence of antibiotics or antibiotic-resistance determinants) must be maintained over time in the presence of ARG; for existing pARB released into the environment, survival in environmental media is the critical factor. However, the exact mechanisms and quantitative relationships between selective pressures and ARB development have yet to be elucidated, and they may be different depending on the antibiotic, bacterial species, and resistance mechanisms involved. In cases where selective pressure is removed, the abundance of antibiotic-resistance ARB may be reduced, but not to extinction. (Andersson and Hughes 2010, 2011; Cottell et al. 2012). Even a small number of ARB at the community level represents a reservoir of ARG for horizontal transfer once pressure is reapplied. Because it seems inevitable that ARB will eventually develop against any antibiotic (Levy and Marshall 2004), the key management aim seems to be to delay and confine such a development as much as possible.",

A corresponding metric for environmental antibiotic concentration could be developed based on the concept of the minimum selective concentration (MSC) (Gullberg et al. 2011), defined as the minimum concentration of an antibiotic agent that selects for resistance. Unlike the traditional chemical risk assessment approach, with the MSC assay it would be necessary to address the human health effects arising from ARGs and the resistance determinants that give rise to ARB, including resistance associated with mutations (Figure 1, processes 1 and 2). In the absence of specific data, an MSC assay could inform a risk assessor of the selective concentration of a pharmaceutical or complex mixture of compounds in a matrix of choice, allowing description of thresholds for significant ARB development.",

An MRA is used qualitatively or quantitatively to evaluate the level of exposure and subsequent risk to human health from microbiological hazards. In the context of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms, environmental MRA is in its infancy but is needed to address resistant bacteria and/or their determinants. The MRA was originally developed for fecal pathogen hazards in food and water [ILSI (International Life Sciences Institute) 1996], with more recent modifications to include biofilm-associated environmental pathogens such as Legionella pneumophila (Schoen and Ashbolt 2011). Some human pathogens can grow in the environment (and may become pARB; Figure 1, processes 1 and 2), and many will infect only compromised individuals (generally termed opportunistic pathogens).",

In considering gene transfer rates, there may be hot spots of activity; for example, there is evidence for HGT of clinically relevant resistance genes between bacteria in manure-impacted soils (Forsberg et al. 2012) and in association with the rhizosphere because of its organic-rich conditions (Pontiroli et al. 2009). In addition, selection pressures for subsequent proliferation of eARB may be higher in these hot spot environments (Brandt et al. 2009; Li et al. 2013). Therefore, it is important to recognize likely zones of high activity during the problem formulation and hazard characterization stages of a risk assessment, and when using sampling to identify in situ exchange rates. As an example marker of anthropogenic impact with potential to predict the impact on the mobile resistome, class 1 integrons could be used because of their ability to integrate gene cassettes that confer a wide range of antibiotic and biocide resistance (Gaze et al. 2011). In semi-pristine soils, prevalence may be two or three orders of magnitude lower than in impacted soils and sediments (0.001 vs. 1%, respectively) (Gaze et al. 2011; Zhu et al. 2013).",

Each of these fecal and environmental pathogens is well known to be able to acquire ARG; thus, given further data on environmental HGT rates, they could be used as reference pathogens in microbial risk assessments.

To properly characterize human risks, it is typical to select hazards for which there are dose\u2013response health data described either deterministically or stochastically, as available for the reference enteric pathogens (e.g., Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella enterica, E. coli) (Schoen and Ashbolt 2010), but these dose\u2013response health data have yet to be quantified for the skin/wound reference pathogens (Mena and Gerba 2009; Rose and Haas 1999). However, as noted above for processes 1\u20135, (Figure 1), an important difference for ARB is the need to account for the phenomena associated with selective environmental pressures for the development of ARB, and ultimately that form the human infective dose of either eARB or pARB. The exact mechanisms and dose\u2013response relationships have yet to be elucidated, and may be different depending on the bacterial species and resistance mechanisms involved. Nevertheless, it seems reasonable for the noncompromised human exposed to a pARB to fit the published dose\u2013response/infection relationship (e.g., derived from \u201cfeeding\u201d trials with healthy adults or from information collected during outbreak investigations) for strains of the same pathogen without antibiotic resistance. What appears more limiting are dose\u2013response models that describe the probability of illness based on the conditional probability of infection and including people who are already compromised, such as those undergoing antibiotic therapy. Although there is definitive data on pARB being more pathogenic or causing more severe illness than their antimicrobial-susceptible equivalents (Barza 2002; Helms et al. 2004, 2005; Travers and Barza 2002), that may not always be the case (Evans et al. 2009; Wassenaar et al. 2007). Clear examples of excess mortality include associated blood stream infections for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and from third generation cephalosporin-resistant E. coli (G3CREC). In 2007 in participating European countries, 27,711 cases of MRSA were associated with 5,503 excess deaths and 255,683 excess hospital days, and 15,183 episodes of G3CREC blood stream infections were responsible for 2,712 excess deaths and 120,065 extra hospital days (de Kraker et al. 2011). The authors predicted that the combined burden of resistance of MRSA and G3CREC will likely lead to a predicted incidence of 3.3 associated deaths per 100,000 inhabitants in 2015. Yet for many regions of the world, such predictions are less well understood.",

Such models are largely based on hydrodynamics, with pathogen-specific parameters to account for likely inactivation/predation in soil and aquatic environments, such as sunlight inactivation (Bradford et al. 2013; Cho et al. 2012; Ferguson et al. 2010). A key aspect of the fate and transport models is the ability to account for the inherent variability of any system component. In addition, our uncertainties in assessing model parameter values should be factored into fate and transport models such as by using Bayesian synthesis methods (Albert et al. 2008; Williams et al. 2011). To better account for parameter uncertainties, more recent models are including Bayesian learning algorithms that help to integrate information using meteorologic, hydrologic, and microbial explanatory variables (Dotto et al. 2012; Motamarri and Boccelli 2012). Overall, these models also help to identify management opportunities to mitigate exposures to ARB and antibiotics and are an important aspect in describing the pathways of hazards to points of human exposure in any risk assessment.",

MCDA is a well-established tool that can be used for evaluating and documenting the importance assigned to different factors in ranking risks (Lienert et al. 2011), albeit heavily dependent on expert opinion. In the context of MRA, MCDA has been used to rank foodborne microbial risks based on multiple factors, including public health, market impacts, consumer perception and acceptance, and social sensitivity (Ruzante et al. 2010), as well as to prioritize and select interventions to reduce pathogen exposures (Fazil et al. 2008). Examples of MCDA applications in structuring decisions for managing ecotoxicological risks have also been reported (Linkov et al. 2006; Semenzin et al. 2008) and provide useful MCDA approaches. MCDA could be used, for example, to evaluate and rank the relative risks between habitats highly polluted with antibiotics, ARG, and ARG determinants, as described above for possible hot spots for HGT and development of ARB. MCDA could be applied to evaluate the relative contribution of coselecting agents (e.g., detergents, biocides, metals, nanomaterials) from various sources to the overall risk of ARB in the environment. Moreover, for a range of antibiotics considered to be of environmental concern, MCDA approaches could be used for risk ranking according to criteria based on relevant contributing factors (e.g., mobility of resistance determinants in genetic elements, antibiotic-resistance transfer rates in different environmental compartments, accumulation levels of antibiotics in environmental compartments, environmental fate and transport to exposure points). In the MCDA process, it is also important to identify low probability but high impact \u201cone-time-event\u201d types of risk.",

Their study included 31 transmission routes related to direct contact with animals and ingestion of food and water, and resulted in a ranking of the most significant sources of exposure. Although their study focused on foodborne transmission routes and did not deal with antibiotic-resistant Campylobacter strains, a similar approach could be applied to estimate human exposure to ARB hazards using the environmental exposure pathways described by Evers et al. (2008). This would require data on the prevalence of ARG and ARB, as well as levels of antibiotics present in all exposure routes to be considered in the risk assessment.

            "text": "Because we are addressing an international problem and because the precautionary approach is used in many jurisdictions, there are many risk management approaches that can be implemented now, before antibiotic-resistance issues worsen, as noted in the related risk management paper resulting from the workshop (Pruden et al. 2013). Furthermore, many current risk management schemes start the process from a management perspective and delve into quantitative assessments as needed in order to improve risk management actions, such as in the WHO water safety plans (WHO 2009). We propose that environmental aspects of antibiotic-resistance development be included in the processes of any HHRA addressing ARB. In general terms, an MRA appears suitable to address environmental human health risks posed by the environmental release of antibiotics, ARB, and ARG; however, at present, there are still too many data gaps to realize that goal. Further development of this type of approach requires data mining from previous epidemiological studies to aid in model development, parameterization, and validation, as well as in the collection of new information, particularly that related to conditions and rates of ARB development in various hot spot environments, and for various human health dose\u2013response unknowns identified in this review. In the near-term, options likely to provide a first-pass assessment of risks seem likely to be based on MCDA approaches, which could be facilitated by Bayesian network models. Once these MRA models gain more acceptance, they may facilitate scenario testing to determine which control points may be most effective in reducing risks and which risk-driving attributes should be specifically considered and minimized during the development of novel antibiotics.",
