Since probiotics have positive effects on preventing certain diseases and maintaining good health, they have become one of the widely applied feed additives as an alternative strategy to antibiotics. The positive roles of probiotics for humans and animals, especially with the development of commercial-scale animal husbandry, have widely been accepted. Many studies have shown that the supplementation of probiotic products can improve feed efficiency and growth rate and reduce intestinal infections in many various animals (2\u20135).",

Moreover, the administration of probiotics to dairy calves results in improvement daily weight gain and resolution of diarrhea (17). Similar results have also been reported in other animals, including poultry (2, 18), ostriches (19), raccoon dogs (20), and silver foxes (20). LAB have widely been applied in animal feed. At present, screening for new probiotics, especially from some undeveloped species has become an ongoing practice (21).",

And in recent years, researches have confirmed that the addition of probiotics to feed supplements is a promising approach for exerting a positive effect on the pigs in different growth stages (43). However, to ensure the efficiency and safety of these bacteria, they must be systematically identified and characterized. The purpose of our research was to analyze the potential probiotic characteristics and evaluate the safety of the LAB isolated from the wild boar in order to explore potentials for the development of feed additives for animals. This is the first report, to our best knowledge, to evaluate the probiotic characteristics of the LAB strains isolated from wild boar.",

The L. mucosae LM1 strain isolated from pig feces has been considered as potential probiotic because of its adhesion to pig ileum mucous and inhibition of intestinal pathogens in vitro (28, 48). Lactobacillus salivarius as common gut inhabitants of raised pigs have been proven to offer benefits for gut health of pigs (49). The LAB isolated from wild boar in this study colonized in their host intestinal tract. Therefore, it is expected that these LAB isolates could be more adaptable to internal environment than other LAB. Enterococcus are also autochthonous flora in the GI tract of host and have different useful functions in dairy industry. Beneficial effects of the addition of Enterococcus to diets include improvement of the pig's intestinal microbiota and performance, and immune modulation (50).",

Autoaggregation can enable microorganisms which belong to the same species to join self-forming groups, and this phenomenon usually associated with microorganisms binding to intestinal mucosa (51). And coaggregation is the intercellular adhesion between different strains, which is also bound up with the ability of interacting with pathogens. Therefore, aggregation may constitute one kind of defense mechanisms of host for anti-infection (52). In this study, five LAB isolated from the same wild boar were observed to have different levels of autoaggregation and coaggregation. This may be a result of complex interplay among bacteria surface molecules, such as proteins, and secreted factors, etc. A previous study has confirmed that any potential aggregation phenotype depends on possible internal factors and the environment (53). The components related to the aggregation phenotype of these isolates need to be identified. Moreover, LAB expressing the aggregation-promoting factors could further promote eliminating pathogens via balancing gut microbial ecosystems and the coaggregation mechanism. Thus, the isolated LAB in this work possessing the ability to autoaggregate and coaggregate pathogens could be beneficial to the intestinal health. Likewise, the high coaggregation level can facilitate the presence of these strains in the intestinal tract of animals.",

Adherence not only enables probiotics to live longer in the GI tract and enhances the interactions of bacteria and host, but also helps itself to overcome gastric motility (55). Therefore, the adhesion ability to mucosal surfaces and epithelial cells is a crucial feature of probiotics. A possible explanation to the adhesive ability of isolates varying from strain to strain in our study is that each of the strains has specific cell-surface molecules to play roles in the ability of adhesion. These molecules may mediate attachment to intestinal mucosa and regulate the immune system. Al Seraih et al. previously reported that high autoaggregation ability is correlated with strong adhesion (56). Similar results have been observed in the current study that the L. mucosae M6-29 and L. salivarius M2-71, with strong aggregation ability, have stronger capacity to adhere to cells than other isolates. It is supposed that aggregation factors which favorably increase H-bonding between and among cell surfaces have correlation with increased general adhesion ability (29). Our results support the hypothesis that a notable correlation was observed between aggregation and adhesion. Although the relation of the aggregation and adhesion was not characterized in this study, it would be an interesting topic for the next project.",

These strains as putative probiotics should have antimicrobial activities against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogenic microorganisms. Among our LAB isolated from wild boar, L. salivarius M2-71 had the strongest antibacterial activity and a significant co-aggregation ability. Actually, antimicrobial activities are also related to coaggregation. The intimate contact between probiotics and pathogenic bacteria occurs during co-aggregation and the anti-microbial substances produced by the former can inhibit pathogens (61). In addition, the reports of the antiviral and anticancer activities are good examples of much broader than originally considered health-promoting activities attributed to probiotic LAB (62, 63).

The effects on the general health of animals are used to evaluate the safety profile of probiotic isolates. In order to assess the effects of probiotics on overall health condition, body weight gain and organ indices have been established and measured. No differences in organ indices, noticeable abnormal behavior, and loss in body weight were monitored after 3-week feeding with the LAB strains, indicating that these five isolates administered did not adversely affect the general health of mice.
