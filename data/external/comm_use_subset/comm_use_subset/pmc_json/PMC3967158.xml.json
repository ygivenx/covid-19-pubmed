The S glycoprotein is post-translationally cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits and S1 is the most divergent region, which carries conformationally-dependent virus-neutralizing and serotype-specific epitopes [4,5]. The N protein located in the capsid of the virion is involved in RNA replication, assembly and carries group-specific antigenic determinants [6] and has high immunogenicity, readily inducing antibodies and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte immunity in chickens [7]. S1 and N genes have been used most frequently to determine the relatedness of emerging strains of IBV [5,8]. The M protein is a structural membrane protein and plays an important role in the viral assembly process and particularly is indispensable for many biological functions including viral core stability. Interactions of M and E proteins are important for virus budding and formation of virus-like particles, which are involved in mucosal immunity [9]. ",

Pathogenicity of IBV is associated with the spike gene as well as genes outside of the spike gene [12]. The M protein is associated with virus assembly and change this protein will affect the efficiency of virus particles formation and subsequent transmission of the virus [3]. The N protein plays an important role in viral replication, assembly, and immunity. In addition to S1 glycoprotein, the N protein could represent an important target in the prevention of IB outbreaks [13]. Recent evidence revealed that there are significant variations in the N and M genes between strains [13,14]. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze multiple genes especially to analyze the genetic variation of S1, M and N genes considering their importance as structural proteins. ",

Therefore, it is extremely critical to identify the prevalence of IBVs and genetic characteristics of circulating strains in a region or a country in order to develop effective vaccines for the control of the disease. Outbreaks of IB have been occurring frequently in China in spite of intensive vaccinations for many years [15,17,20,21,22]. IB is still a major problem in Guangxi province [15,17], which is located in southern China and produces a total of 700 million birds per year and ranks third in China [23]. It is very important to know the genetic characteristics of prevalent strains of IBVs in this region. We previously reported the genotype diversity of Guangxi IBV isolates based on the hypervariable region I (HVR I) of S1 gene [15], but the available comprehensive genetic information of circulating IBV strains in this region was limited. Therefore, in the present study we performed the analysis of the phylogenetic tree, of the entropy of the amino acid sequences, of positive selection as well as of computational recombination based on the sequencing results of the viral structural protein genes S1, M and N in order to provide molecular epidemiology information of IBV and to lay a good foundation for the control of IB in the field.",

A gene which undergoes positive selection promoted by natural selection usually has highly important functions [29]. Some investigators reported positive selection wasn\u2019t detected in the spike protein of IBVs although they differed markedly in the sequence of the spike protein [26,30]. However, other investigators showed different results. Positive selection was detected in the spike protein of IBV California-type viruses, for which no vaccine exists but was not detected in Massachusetts- and Connecticut-types where attenuated live vaccines are routinely used [11]. Another report showed that positive selection was found in the S1 protein of variants isolated from layer-type birds but was not found in variants isolated from broilers, even though a high number of mutations was significantly associated with broiler-type chickens [25]. Positively selected sites in the nucleocapsid protein of the Taiwan IBV and their effects on RNA-binding activity were reported recently [31]. Previous reports on SARS-CoV indicated that positive selection on S protein was changeable in different epidemic groups and positive selection on replicase of SARS-CoV was detected only in human patients, not in any proteins of bat SARS-like-CoV [29]. We found positive selection was observed on S1 protein of 4/91-type and CK/CH/LSC/99I-type strains, M protein of CK/CH/LSC/99I-type and BJ-type strains, N protein of CK/CH/LSC/99I-type and LX4-type strains. Thus, not only S1 protein but also M and N proteins experienced positive selection during the IBV epidemics. The variation of positive selection of S, M and N proteins among different groups may explain why these field variants escape immune pressure and may provide valuable evidence that these three structural proteins may be critical for virus evolution. It is the first time to analyze the positive selection of S1, M and N genes of IBVs.",

High scoring amino acid positions may correlate with structurally or functionally important residues [33]. The greater the entropy is, the higher variation frequency of amino acid sites is. An entropy value bigger than 0.4 indicated the corresponding amino acid site was not conserved [34]. A Shannon entropy analysis of immunoglobulin and T cell receptor revealed that the T cell receptor is significantly more diverse than immunoglobulin-suggesting T cell receptor has new complementarity determining regions, which represent a larger antigen combining site, additional combining sites, or an evolutionary strategy to avoid inappropriate interaction with other molecules [35]. A recent study used the Shannon entropy and relative entropy to measure the diversity of amino acid site of H3 HA between the 1992\u20131993 season and the 2009\u20132010 season and showed that the rate of evolution increases with the virus diversity in the current season and the Shannon entropy of the sequence in the current season predicts relative entropy between sequences in the current season and those in the next season [32]. According to our results, the average entropy of amino acid sequences, the percentages of entropy bigger than 0.4 and the number of amino acid sites with high entropy of S1 gene are biggest, and those of N gene were bigger than M gene. Thus, these observations revealed that amino acid sequences of S1 gene had the largest variation; the M gene had less variation than the N gene. To our knowledge, it is the first time to analyze the entropy of S1, M and N gene amino acid sequences. The variation of amino acids will have an important effect on the biological function and evolution of viruses. Hence, observing the biological function of the amino acid residues with higher entropy and identifying the positively selected sites among IBVs will be further studied. ",

In our study, convincing evidence showed five S1-gene recombinants GX-NN8, GX-NN9, GX-NN10, GX-NN11 and GX-YL7, with their putative parental strains of vaccine strain 4/91 and CK/CH/LSC/99I-Type field strain GX-YL2, and their crossover regions were at nucleotide position 7\u2013677 or 7\u2013678. A recently report showed a recombinant (ck/CH/LZJ/111113 strain) came from a Chinese field isolate (ck/CH/LDL/091022 strain, LX4-type) and a 4/91-like strain, with switches at 3 sites, namely upstream of S, the N gene and the 3' UTR [39]. Besides the Mass-type vaccine, 4/91-type live vaccines are also commonly used in China including during the breeding period [39], even without official authorization. Our finding provides another evidence that 4/91 vaccine strains are contributing to the emergence of variants in the field in China. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the vaccine licensing system before introduction of exotic IBV strains. We should continued 49/1-type recombinants surveillance in China. The pathogenicity of 4/91-derived recombinants should be assessed in further studies.",
