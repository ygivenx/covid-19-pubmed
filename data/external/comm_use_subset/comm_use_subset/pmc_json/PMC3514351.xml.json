            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), the causative agent of PRRS in swine, is a member of the Arteriviridae family in the order Nidovirales. PRRSV causes highly significant economic losses to the swine industry worldwide [1] as a result of both reproductive failure (late-term abortions and stillbirths) in pregnant sows and respiratory disease (pneumonia) in nursery and grower/finishing pigs [2]. Infection with PRRSV also predisposes pigs to infection by bacterial pathogens as well as other viral pathogens [3-7], as such, PRRSV is a key etiological agent of the porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC). Clinical disease caused by PRRSV is highly variable, ranging from mild, subclinical infection to acute death of adult animals [8]. Differences in virulence have been attributed to numerous factors including host genetics, management practices, and virus strain heterogeneity [9-16]. Relatively little is known about the interactions of PRRSV and host cells. The lymph node is an anatomic site where the innate immune response and adaptive immune system interface. Tracheobronchial lymph nodes (TBLN) in swine drain the lung field and provide the focal structure that can reproducibly be identified. Although the TBLN contains a number of cell types, sampling this tissue allows study of direct and indirect effects of an infectious agent on the lung and cells within the lymph node.",

Experimental infection of pigs in China with these novel viral isolates reproduced the clinical disease providing strong evidence for the role of PRRSV as the causal agent of PHFD. However, there was still a question as to whether there was some unknown agent in the PRRSV preparations that increased the severity of the clinical disease over what was expected for a \u201croutine\u201d PRRSV infection. This question was resolved when PHFD was reproduced in China with virus derived from an infectious clone of the JX143 PRRSV isolate [18] demonstrating that PRRSV isolates with a common genetic motif had a causal role in PHFD leading to this lineage of virus being called highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV). We imported a plasmid containing a full-length clone of the 2006 JXwn06 HP-PRRSV isolate [19] from which infectious virus (rJXwn06) was rescued. An animal study was conducted comparing the pathogenicity of HP-PRRSV isolate rJXwn06 with the North American prototype strain VR-2332 PRRSV [20]. The objective of this report was to investigate gene expression profiles in porcine tracheobronchial lymph node (TBLN) during viral infection with HP-PRRSV rJXwn06 strain alongside of US PRRSV strain VR-2332 at a snapshot of 13 days post-infection using bioinformatics.",

Transcripts up-regulated in both HP-PRRSV rJXwn06 and VR-2332-infected TBLN by > 9-fold and > 4-fold vs. control TBLN, respectively, were three serum amyloid A2 (SAA4) acute-phase isoforms, as well as gene ENSSSCG00000013369 F1S9C0_PIG serum amyloid protein (no HGNC annotation), that are expressed in response to inflammatory stimuli (Table 2). Other annotated genes (Table 2) that were up-regulated in HP-PRRSV rJXwn06 TBLN vs. control were resistin (RETN) which is secreted by immune and epithelial cells and participates in the immune response by increasing transcriptional events that increase expression of several pro-inflammatory cytokines [24]; three members of the S100 family (S100A9, S100A8, S100A12) of calcium-binding proteins localized in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus of a wide range of cells, involved in the regulation of a number of cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and differentiation, and mediators of inflammatory and protective anti-infection responses [25]; xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) a generator of reactive oxygen species and possible cause of hypoxia-mediated lung injury [26]; and peptidylarginine deiminase, type IV, (PADI4) which may play a role in granulocyte and macrophage development leading to inflammation and immune responses [27]. Also in the top ten up-regulated transcripts were two genes without a HGNC symbol, TREM1_PIG (ENSSSCG00000001617) trigger receptor, which is expressed on myeliod cells, and the interleukin-1 receptor, type II gene (IL1R2) which is associated with host responses to subdue inflammation as a consequence of disease. Down-regulated in HP-PRRSV TBLN vs. control TBLN were diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) which catalyzes triglyceride synthesis which is critical for formation of adipose tissue [28]; perilipin-1 (PLIN1) an important regulator of lipid storage; a member of the cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYP4B1) of unknown specific function; soluble galactose-binding lectin 12 (LGALS12), cell death-inducing DFFA-like effector C (CIDEC), tumor suppressor candidate 5 (TUSC5), protein phosphatase 1, regulatory (inhibitor) subunit 1A (PPP1R1A), C-type lectin domain family 4, member G, that encodes a glycan-binding receptor and a member of the C-type lectin family which plays a role in T-cell immune responses (CLEC4G). Also in the top ten down-regulated transcripts were the following genes without projected HGNC symbols: CES1 liver carboxylesterase (ENSSSCG00000002825) and F1STY2_PIG thyroid hormone-responsive protein (ENSSSCG00000014888). In VR-2332-infected pig TBLN vs. control TBLN, transcript abundance was down-regulated to a lesser extent and featured genes linked to metabolism in adipose tissue and regulation in neuronal activity functions including dermatopontin (DPT) extracellular matrix protein with possible functions in cell-matrix interactions and matrix assembly which enhances transforming growth factor beta (TGFB1) activity; beta-1 adrenergic receptor (ADRB1); Solute carrier family 2, facilitated glucose transporter member 4 (SLC2A4); uncharacterized MLX interacting protein-like protein (MLXIPL); basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor 15 (TCF15); forkhead box transcription factor protein C2 (FOXC2); protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 1B also known as dopamine- and cAMP-regulated neuronal phosphoprotein (PPP1R1B); potassium voltage-gated channel, KQT-like subfamily, member 4 (KCNQ4) that is thought to play a critical role in the regulation of neuronal excitability; plexin domain containing 1 (PLXDC1); and adenosine A1 receptor (ADORA1).",

The top functions identified with the Ingenuity Canonical Pathway list, filtered to apoptosis, cellular immune response, cytokine signalling, humoral immune responses and pathogen-influenced signalling, based on differentially expressed genes were: granzyme A signalling, crosstalk between dendritic cells and natural killer cells, IL-10 signalling, role of pattern recognition receptors in recognition of bacteria and viruses, IL-12 signalling and production in macrophages, complement system, interferon signalling, communication between innate and adaptive immune cells, IL-17A signalling in fibroblasts, granzyme B signalling, production of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species in macrophages, differential regulation of cytokine production in macrophages and T helper cells by IL-17A and IL-17F that were above the threshold of p value < 0.05, as calculated by Fischer's test representing the ratio of number of genes from the dataset that map to the pathway and the number of all known genes ascribed to the pathway. The genes up-regulated in the HP-PRRSV rJXwn06 infected pigs\u2019 TBLN were associated in 18 networks: from biological networks with functions associated with cell death, antimicrobial responses and cancer, with the highest network score of 37, i.e. the likelihood of genes in this network would have approximately a 10-37 chance of occurring randomly, and 21 focus molecules, i.e. the starting points for generating biological networks; to networks with functions associated with nervous system development and function, organ morphology and reproductive system disease with a score of 2 and 1 focus molecule. Many of the up-regulated networks related to cell death and inflammatory response functions fit with the results previously reported [17,29] where HP-PRRSV strain rJXwn06 caused severe disease, resulted in up to 100X higher abundance of virus and produced an exacerbated release of cytokines, including pro-inflammatory cytokines, when compared to Type 2 prototype strain VR-2332. Wide spread tissue damage [30] and cell death were observed as predicted by up-regulation of cell-death associated genes (circled in orange in Figure 1) in the network representation of the mostly highly rated network for HP-PRRSV rJXwn06 by IPA. The down-regulated network functions in the HP-PRRSV rJXwn06 infected TBLN included activities associated with cellular function and maintenance, tissue morphology, metabolic disease, organismal development, carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, small molecule biochemistry, post-translational modification, protein folding, developmental disorder, which may be associated with cell death and reflects a severe disease state. Similarly, the down-regulated network functions in the VR-2332 infected TBLN were associated with cellular function, maintenance, development and organization.",

            "text": "It is well established that many pathogens cause changes in expression of specific genes that act to protect the host and clear the infection. PRRSV strains differ in their dysregulation of the immune response to infection and delay in development of a protective immune response in vaccinated pigs [33,34]. A higher number of significantly differentially expressed gene instances were detected in HP-PRRSV rJXwn06 than VR-2332 when normalized to control samples at a snapshot of 13 days post inoculation (dpi). As anticipated, some of the genes (e.g., resistin) and pathways identified would be expected to be involved in the host response to a severe disease. In the case of resistin, it would be expected that adipose tissue stores are being mobilized as part of the host response to infection, which includes a high fever typical of infection with HP-PRRSV. There are specific cellular proteins that regulate a protective immune response, for example the pro-inflammatory genes that were up-regulated to a greater extent in HP-PRRSV rJXwn06 than VR-2332 when normalized to control samples as observed when comparing the pathogenicity of HP-PRRSV isolate rJXwn06 with the North American prototype strain VR-2332 PRRSV. At 13 dpi HP-PRRSV rJXwn06 inoculated pigs had an interstitial pneumonia that was significantly more severe than theVR-2332 inoculated group which appeared to be convalescing [30]. Future studies of these differentially expressed genes, their transcript abundance, protein level, and protein function will enhance our understanding of the interaction of PRRSV with the host. Identification of new virulence mechanisms of PRRSV may improve the prospects for rational design of more effective vaccines to limit viral replication and shedding.",

This was carried out with the construction of a RNAseq analysis pipeline (Figure 2) comprised of GSNAP for alignment and genome construction, and Cufflinks to determine if differential expression and changes in transcript abundance were statistically significant. Three files of transcriptome data from the sham, HP-PRRSV rJXwn06 and US PRRSV VR-2332 inoculated groups were aligned to the UCSC pig genome build using the GSNAP alignment program in preparation for differential expression analysis. The next step in the pipeline was to put the GSNAP output into the Cufflinks program and run it through three separate utilities or tools within the software package; Cufflinks, Cuffmerge, and Cuffdiff. First the three files were run through Cufflinks in order to assemble the aligned RNA Sequence reads into transcripts and estimate the abundances in FPKM of the paired\u2013end reads. The Cufflinks q-value was the false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted p-value of the uncorrected test statistic. The q-value used in this study was 0.05. The significance status was \u201cyes\u201d when p was greater than q after Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple-testing (Additional file 1). Cuffmerge was then used to create a single transcript dataset from the multiple reconstructions. Two runs were then conducted using the HP-PRRSV rJXwn06 vs. control and the US PRRSV VR-2332 vs. control datasets using the Cuffdiff program to test for differential expression and regulation amongst the two disease states. Gene annotation of all significant hits was then carried out using a MySQL database matching to the Ensembl Sscrofa 9.56 reference genome currently supported by the Integrative Genomics Viewer (Broad Institute).",
