            "text": "Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a febrile exanthematous disease with typical symptoms or atypical symptoms. The typical symptoms of HFMD include flat discolored spots or bumps that may blister, on the hands, feet, and mouth, and occasionally buttocks and groin, even inflammation of the heart, fluid in the lungs, or bleeding into the lungs, inflammation of the brain, inflammation of the meninges, or acute flaccid paralysis, sometimes accompanied by death in children younger than 5 years of age. Epidemiological results show that typical HFMD usually is caused by enterovirus 71 (EV71) or coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) (Chan et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2012). Atypical HFMD, on the other hand, is characterized by severe rash, onychomadesis in young children, and a higher rate of infection in adults, and it is usually induced by coxsackievirus A6 (CVA6). Increasing epidemiological data indicates that outbreaks of CVA6-associated HFMD have markedly increased worldwide in recent years (Gao et al., 2016; Laga et al., 2016; Li J. S. et al., 2016; Li W. et al., 2016; Mirand et al., 2016). However, the current vaccine development, drug development or basic research for HFMD principally targets EV71 and CA16. Therefore, strategies for preventing and treating CVA6-related-HFMD are scarce, and even the current knowledge on the infection, pathogenic mechanism, and immunogenicity of CVA6 remains limited.",

            "text": "As part of their pathogenic mechanism, many viruses are known to control the host cell cycle to maximize their own replication. Examples can be found among DNA viruses, retroviruses, and RNA viruses. Small DNA viruses, such as simian virus 40 (DeCaprio et al., 1988), adenovirus (Howe et al., 1990; Eckner et al., 1994), and human papillomavirus (Werness et al., 1990), as well as large DNA viruses, such as herpesviruses (Flemington, 2001), can arrest the host cell cycle to utilize host resources. The Vpr protein of the retrovirus human immunodeficiency virus type 1 is responsible for accumulating cells in G2/M phase (He et al., 1995; Goh et al., 1998). Among RNA viruses, the coronavirus family virus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) arrests cells in S and G2/M-phase for viral proliferation (Dove et al., 2006; Li et al., 2007); mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (Chen and Makino, 2004), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Yuan et al., 2005, 2006) and enterovirus 68 (Wang et al., 2017) can induce cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase. The etiological agents for typical HFMD, EV71 and CA16, induce cell cycle arrest in S phase for viral production through non-structural protein 3D (Yu et al., 2015). However, whether the atypical HFMD agent, CVA6, regulates the host cell cycle is not clear.",

            "text": "Cell cycle progression in all eukaryotes is controlled by an intricate mechanism that involves CDKs binding with the corresponding cyclin regulatory subunits tightly in sequential order. The G1 phase cyclins, cyclinD, and cyclinE, associate predominantly with CDK4/CDK6 and CDK2 to promote G1 progression and S-phase entry (Sherr, 1994). Up-regulation of P53 and P16 can inhibit the activity of cyclinD/CDK4 or cyclinD/CDK6 complexes to arrest the cell cycle at G0/G1 phase (Sherr and Roberts, 1995). Subsequently, cyclinA and cyclinE combine, mainly with CDK2, to promote S-phase progression (Lundberg and Weinberg, 1998), and then CDK1 and cyclinB regulate mitotic entry (Yu et al., 2008, 2013). Some viruses have been well known to manipulate cell cycle progression by regulating cyclin and CDK expression (Caffarelli et al., 2013; Adeyemi and Pintel, 2014; Yu et al., 2015), but the potential effect of CVA6 on cell cycle regulation is unknown.",

Our data demonstrate that CVA6 replication arrests cell cycle in G0/G1 phase, and, conversely, that cell cycle arrested in G0/G1 phase provides favorable conditions for CVA6 production. We further demonstrate that the non-structural 3D and 3C and proteins are responsible for G0/G1-phase arrest. These results further advance our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of CVA6 and provide a potential target for the treatment and prevention of HFMD.",

These data suggest that CVA6 infection induces G0/G1-phase accumulation. Meanwhile, to determine whether or not G0/G1-phase arrest is exclusive to the RD cell line, human embryonic kidney cells 293T were selected for further analysis based on screening cell line with cytopathic effect after CVA6 infection. 293T cells in G0/G1 phase were increased from 40.80 \u00b1 1.05 to 44.89 \u00b1 0.95% (10.02% increase; P < 0.00\u20131; Figure 1B) at 48 h post-infection, and it was found that cytophathic effect induced by CVA6 in 293T is not obvious as RD cell line (data not shown), which might explain that CVA6 manipulated cell cycle in 293T cell line not as strongly as in RD cell line.

However, CVA6 was unable to accumulate cells in G0/G1 phase that had been treated with thymidine (Figure 3B). The viral genomic RNA levels, as assessed by VP1 qRT-PCR remained similar in S phase-synchronized cells and control non-synchronized cells at 2 h post-infection (Figure 3C) but were reduced in S phase-synchronized cells at 24 h post-infection (P < 0.01, Thymi vs. Con; Figure 3D).

Our results demonstrate that 3D expression shifted the cells toward G0/G1 phase, and the extent of the arrest in G0/G1 phase was dependent on the dose of 3D plasmid that was transfected (0, 0.5, 1, 2 \u03bcg) (R = 0.897; P < 0.001). Similar results were observed for 3C (R = 0.924; P < 0.001) (Figures 8A,B). To further confirm the role of 3C and 3D in manipulating G0/G1 phase, we transfected PEGFP, 3C-PEGFP and 3D-PEGFP into 293T cells for analyzing successfully transfected cells, and it was found that in PEGFP-transfected cells the ratio of G0/G1 is 24.34 \u00b1 1.89%, in 3C-PEGFP-transfected cells it is 70.79 \u00b1 0.44% (P < 0.001, compared to PEGFP), and in 3D-PEGFP-transfected cells it is 70.79 \u00b1 0.63% (P < 0.001, compared to PEGFP), meanwhile in three groups, for non-transfected cells the ratio of G0/G1 is 55.53 \u00b1 1.07, 57.86 \u00b1 0.24, and 58.60 \u00b1 0.19%, respectively (Figures 8C,D). Therefore, these results suggest that the viral proteins of 3D and 3C may each contribute to the enhanced percentage of G0/G1 cells after CVA6 infection.",

A number of viruses create a favorable environment for own replication through manipulating host cell-cycle (Chen and Makino, 2004; Helt and Harris, 2005; Dove et al., 2006; He et al., 2010; Yu et al., 2015). Therefore, our results are consistent with the possibility that the G0/G1-phase arrest induced by CVA6 might serve as a strategy for viral proliferation. To evaluate this possibility, cell cycle synchronization in G0/G1, S, and G2/M is executed by serum deprivation, thymidine and nocodazole treatment, respectively. Our results show that G0/G1 synchronization promotes CVA6 replication and viral production but not affecting virus entry, however that synchronization in S and G2/M phase decreases viral replication and inhibits viral production. These results suggest that G0/G1 phase is most favorable for CVA6 production, and that S or G2/M phase is inhibitory for viral production.",

These results are surprising, given that EV71, CA16 and CVA6 each belong to the Picornaviridae family and cause HFMD. Although we do not know the reason for this difference, it could explain why EV71 and CVA6 have different characteristics, such as region of the epidemic (Europe and Asia), symptoms in clinic, and scope of the epidemic. We also demonstrated that human enterovirus 68 (EVD68), which is an alternate emerging pathogen that can cause severe respiratory disease, induces cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase (Wang et al., 2017). Therefore, CVA6 and EVD68 share this ability to regulate cell cycle progression at G0/G1. Similar to the results of our study, G2/M synchronization has been shown to inhibit the production of EV71 (Yu et al., 2015). Therefore, for treatment of either typical or atypical HFMD symptoms, agents inducing G2/M cell cycle arrest should be considered.",

Each of these proteins was down-regulated after CVA6 infection, though the timepoint of downregulation varied. Furthermore, the CyclinD1 inhibitory proteins P53, P21, and P16 were upregulated by CVA6 infection. These findings support a model in which: (1) CVA6 infection can arrest at G0/G1 phase by down-regulating CDK4, CDK6 and cyclinD1 and upregulating the P53-P21 and P16 pathway; (2) CVA6 infection can inhibit S phase entry by down-regulating cyclinE and CDK2 expression; (3) CVA6 infection can promote G2/M exit by down-regulating cyclinB1 and CDK1 expression.",
