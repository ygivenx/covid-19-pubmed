Prevalence of NTM lung diseases is unexpectedly increasing in industrialized countries, as consistently uncovered by recent studies [3, 4]. The key issue remains to determine whether NTM are the true and single promoter of an evolving lung disease or chronic airway colonizers, among others. To standardize the diagnosis of NTM lung disease, the guidelines for NTM diagnosis of the American Thoracic Society (ATS)/Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) and the British Thoracic Society (BTS) require isolation and growth of the same NTM strain on at least two separate samples from the patient [5, 6].",

NTM lung disease is strongly associated with pre-existing pulmonary conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, idiopathic bronchiectasis, prior active tuberculosis or pneumoconiosis [6]. It is also frequently associated with genetic or acquired systemic immune deficiency such as defects in the pathways of inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-12, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 or interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, immunosuppressive treatments (including anti-TNF-\u03b1 therapy or corticosteroids), solid-organ transplantation, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)/human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection [1\u20137]. However, it may also occur in individuals without recognized severe immune local or systemic deficiency. In the absence of patent predisposition, NTM diseases are overrepresented among the specific morphotype of slender women with a low body fat [8].",

There is debate as to which patients should benefit the most from treatment according to medical background, comorbidities, clinical status, radiologic features and causal NTM strain. Assessment of clinical, microbiologic, and radiologic response to treatment is not standardized as well. We focused on NTM lung diseases in adults without systemic immunodeficiency that met the ATS criteria guidelines. Based on the comparison of a group of treated and untreated patients, the primary objective was to identify the factors associated with physician decision of initiating anti-NTM treatment. Secondary objectives were to study the outcome upon treatment and to propose a standardized evaluation for the diagnosis and decision making to treatment of NTM lung diseases in adults without systemic immunodeficiency.",

Exclusion criteria were HIV infection, cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia, active malignant disease, solid-organ transplantation or ongoing immunosuppressant treatments such as TNF inhibitor or high-dose corticosteroid (\u2265 1 mg/kg more than 21 days). Case identification was based on cross-referencing the databases of the mycobacteria laboratory and the departments of infectious and pulmonary diseases. Patients eligible for inclusion in the NTM lung disease cohort were those who matched the criteria previously defined by the ATS/IDSA and the BTS guidelines with the minimum requirement of clinical and microbiologic following criteria: (i) pulmonary symptoms associated with multifocal bronchiectasis with multiple small nodules on computed tomography (CT)-scan; (ii) proper exclusion of other diagnoses; (iii) NTM-positive culture results from at least two separate expectorated sputum samples or a NTM-positive culture result from at least one bronchial wash or lavage [5, 6]. Patients\u2019 characteristics at diagnosis were collected in order to perform analysis on 146 selected variables: demographics; history of predisposing factors; underlying pulmonary diseases; comorbidities; pulmonary function testing; respiratory bacterial or mycological co-infection(s), which definition was similar to NTM criteria, namely positive culture isolation of the same species from at least two separate expectorated sputum samples or a positive culture result from at least one bronchial wash or lavage; immunologic status; nutritional status; clinical features; microbiologic assessment through identification of NTM species on positive NTM cultures and sample culture conversions; radiologic features on high-resolution CT-scans (fibrocavitary disease or nodular/bronchiectasis disease); prior treatment for NTM lung disease, treatment combination and duration; outcome. Because of the retrospective observational nature of the study and the lack of any modification in patients\u2019 management, the need for informed consent was waived with the authorization of the Ethics Committee of Lyon University Hospital (Comit\u00e9 d\u2019Ethique, Hospices Civils de Lyon), which approved the study under the number 17\u2013207.",

In the treated group, 21 (84%) received \u22653 anti-NTM drugs, among whom 23 (92%) received a macrolide as part of a first-line regimen. Median anti-NTM treatment duration was 36.3 (IQR, 13.1\u201364.4) weeks. Thirteen (52%) of the treated patients developed at least one antimicrobial-related adverse event, among which gastrointestinal disorders (n = 6), impaired blood cell count (n = 5) and cholestatic and/or cytolytic hepatitis (n = 4). According to physician judgment, clinical stabilization and improvement was obtained for 8 (34.8%) and 12 (52.2%) of treated patients, respectively. Patient\u2019s median follow-up from diagnosis assessment was 17.1 (IQR, 8.7\u201327.1) months. Eighty-five CT-scans were reviewed for comparative assessment after treatment or over the course of follow-up in the untreated subset. The median interval between the initiation of NTM treatment and the date of the assessed images was 56.7 (IQR, 43.3\u201397.7) weeks. Although 34.8% (n = 8) and 39.1% (n = 9) experienced regression or stabilization of their pulmonary lesions in the treated patients, these rates did not differ from the untreated patients with 30.8% (n = 4) and 46.2% (n = 6) of regression and stabilization over the course of their follow-up, respectively (Table 2). Finally, all-cause mortality was not different between treated and untreated groups, although lost to follow-up was high in the untreated group (n = 10, 38.5%). Regarding the four patients that deceased (n = 3 in the treated group and n = 1 in the untreated group), the cause of mortality was linked to the underlying diseases rather than NTM-related mortality.",

Aspergillus spp. co-infection was the only independent factor associated with treatment initiation. A single study from five English centers has recently addressed the factors that influence anti-NTM treatment initiation using similar retrospective design of treated and untreated cohort comparison (2010\u20132014), to the exception of different inclusion criteria which allowed non-AIDS/HIV immunosuppressed patients (36 and 33% in the treated and untreated subsets, respectively) to be evaluated. In the multivariate analysis, patients had increased odds of anti-NTM treatment in case of cavitation on CT imaging, night sweats and weight loss [9].",

            "text": "Here, three out of four criteria are part of guideline criteria leading to decision of anti-NTM treatment. They all reflect a degree of severity of NTM lung disease linked with progression of an impaired respiratory condition. The current problematic of NTM lung diseases shifts from distinguishing colonization from infection toward differentiating stable, poorly active vs. progressive active NTM disease, the latter being responsible for further structural lung damage(s). The risk/benefit analysis includes prescribing recommended long-term multidrug regimens with concerns over suboptimal cure rates and frequently reported drug-related side effects. To support these arguments, others have already shown that physician ATS/IDSA guideline adherence is moderate confirming such a trend of intuitive clinical behavior mostly based on evidence of severity and/or patent progression of the disease. A multicenter study has reported a sample of 349 US physicians treating 915 patients with M. avium complex (MAC) lung disease. Overall, 55% (n = 411) of patients with MAC lung disease received some type of anti-NTM treatment from their physician and 13% prescribed antibiotic regimens were consistent with ATS/IDSA guidelines [10]. Another study conducted in France has shown that among a cohort of 31 NTM lung diseases, only 12 (38.7%) received appropriate treatment matching ATS/IDSA guidelines [11]. Inappropriate prescriptions were mostly related to shorter treatment duration (6 months or less) and/or off-recommendation regimen, particularly those excluding macrolide from the combination or those using a single-drug macrolide regimen [10, 11]. It has to be acknowledged that guidelines specify that treatment for MAC-associated lung disease in HIV-negative individuals can be a three-times-weekly drug regimen upon culture conversion while on therapy for 1 year, which may favor treatment compliance [5, 12, 13].",

By itself, the coexistence of NTM and Aspergillus in lung airway justifies the need for testing Aspergillus serology, total serum immunoglobulin (Ig)E and Aspergillus-specific IgE levels as well as mycological direct examination and culture of sputum or bronchial aspirates for presence of filamentous fungi in the diagnosis algorithm of patients with NTM lung diseases. Active co-infections with NTM and Aspergillus spp. have also been described, in which patients with NTM lung disease develop chronic forms of pulmonary aspergillosis which definitions and management have been revisited in recent updated guidelines [14\u201317].",

A previous study has investigated radiologic response to treatment showing consistent results with those found in the present study. Although anti-NTM treatment led to an improvement or stabilization of lesions for a majority of patients, these modifications were not significantly different from the untreated group who went through CT-scan follow up indicating that anti-NTM treatment did not lead to radiological abnormalities reversion [9]. The present study has strengths and limitations. The strength is the study of the largest cohort so far of NTM lung diseases in patients without systemic immunodeficiency with exhaustive data collection and blinded radiological assessment. We acknowledge the biases that contribute to mitigate conclusions from the study such as being conducted in a single center, the important differences in physician\u2019s management resulting in lack of consistency in treatment decision making, the number of missing data. In addition, the CT-scans were not performed at fixed intervals, particularly in the untreated subset of patients. Finally, treatment duration and outcome criteria were not standardized, which prevent to properly assess treatment efficacy. Useful consensus definitions for key outcome parameters to be used in the treatment of NTM lung diseases have been released very recently, which should harmonize data collection regarding NTM treatment [18].",
