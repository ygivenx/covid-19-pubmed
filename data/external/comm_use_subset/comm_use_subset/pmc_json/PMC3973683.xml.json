The advances in deep sequencing processes provide an important new tool for the identification of novel viruses. Correct phylogenetic analysis and virus transmission studies are best performed with as much sequence information as possible. Given the relatively small genome sizes of most viral genomes and the increased sequencing depth now available with deep sequencing platforms, generating full genomes of novel viruses should become the standard for virus identification. The characterization of novel full viral genomes present in clinical, animal or environmental samples is important for diagnostics, for identifying unexpected pathogens and for discovering disease etiology. Sample origin can also influence complexity: fecal samples have significant bacterial and dietary content and the derived nucleic acids contain large amounts of bacterial, bacteriophage, and plant viral nucleic acids in the resulting sequence data complicating detection of mammalian viruses.",

Fecal viruses are often found in high titers further improving detection. In addition to the enteric viruses that actually replicate in the gut, the fecal compartment can contain respiratory viruses (e.g. coronavirus) and hepatitis viruses improving the range of detection. The utility of searching for novel viruses in this compartment is well documented and deep sequencing of fecal derived nucleic acids is a rich source of new viruses from bats [2], [3], [4], wild rodents [5], pigs on domestic farms [6], California sea lions[7], wild pigeons [8] and human fecal material [9]\n[10], [11]. Changes in the fecal virome may be an extremely important feature of AIDS pathogenesis and detailed characterization of the fecal virome may provide new understanding of HIV-1 pathogenesis [12]. Studies seeking virus in sewage [13], [14], may present different set of discovery challenges including concentration of diluted starting material, the mixture of material from multiple individuals and species found in sewage and the risk that virus genome assembly creates an artificial chimera. Algorithms to process deep sequencing data have been devised and these are providing important advances for virus detection [15], [16]. An assumption has been made that a single dominant host nucleic acid exists in the sample. This may be the case with some sample types, however fecal material may include bacterial, fungal, plant nucleic acid from either commensal organisms or diet.",

All of the studies so far have used manual or batch BLAST searching to identify the resulting sequences. Although this is quite effective, it is time consuming work, both implementing the BLAST searches themselves or parsing the BLAST output to extract useful information. Furthermore, as sequencing technologies have improved (e.g. moving from 454 to Illumina platforms) the total number of sequence reads to be processed has increased 10 to 100 fold, further increasing the processing work. Furthermore, a common challenge facing all virus detection in fecal material is the high content of bacteria and dietary nucleic acid that can interfere with the detection of mammalian viruses. This bystander nucleic acid both consumes precious sequencing resources and can dominate the resulting sequence data. Methods that improve or simplify virus detection amidst large amounts of peripheral nucleic acid are needed. The work described here provides a computational solution to simplify virus detection amidst the increasing amount of sequence data now available.",

The method has been used successfully in a number of virus detection applications [17], [18], combined with 454 deep sequencing to identify pathogens [19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22] and with autologous antibody capture to identify the immunogenic viruses within a sample [23]. The method presented here is a combination of sample processing using VIDISCA enrichment for particle-protected nucleic acid and conversion of RNA to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) [19], [20] followed by Illumina MiSeq deep sequencing and SLIM iterative BLAST processing. The analysis of the larger quantities of sequence data generated by this method required a novel iterative classification process, SLIM which removes abundant sequences and facilitates identification of rarer viral sequences amidst large amounts of host or bystander sequences. The novel method, ViSeq, was used to document the viral content of human fecal samples from HIV-1 infected patients and to provide full genome catalog of viruses found in this compartment in late stage AIDS patients.",

Some samples contained norovirus at different genome loads as measured by real time PCR. The total number of norovirus reads in each sample was determined by ViSeq followed by mapping all reads to a close norovirus genome. This value was compared to the norovirus viral load determined by real-time PCR. Norovirus reads ranging from 1 to 42,000 were detected across the sample set and there was a strong correlation with the viral load measured by real time PCR (Figure 3). The cutoff for a positive clinical norovirus diagnosis with this real-time PCR assay is a threshold cycle (Ct) of 40; the ViSeq method detected norovirus with similar sensitivity, however without prior sequence knowledge required to design specific real-time PCR primers. Although deep sequencing is currently not a faster alternative to a virus specific real time PCR assay, it is clear that the two detection methods show similar levels of sensitivity for a known virus. Furthermore, the four samples with norovirus Ct values below 27 provided sufficient sequence coverage for full genome assembly (see below).",

A read may share identity in multiple taxa, thus the algorithm places the read in the lowest (most general) taxon that encompasses the set of all identified taxa for that read. At least 5 read hits must occur before a taxon is considered present in the read set. The results of such a taxonomic analysis are presented in Figure 4, organized into 15 taxonomic categories, with colors indicating the number of reads found in each sample for that category (see color bar scale, Figure 4). Several patterns emerge from such an analysis. The viral categories showed the widest range of results. Despite the pretreatment which reduces bacterial material (via centrifugation and DNase treatment) a substantial amount of bacterial sequences were found in these fecal samples (approximately 10%). A large proportion of the reads fail to return a significant BLAST hit with a median of 69,000 of the 100,000 analyzed short reads found in the No Hit category. This may be due to the short sequences, the stringent cutoff used (BLAST Expect value <0.001) and/or the large amount of yet-to-be-characterized micro-organisms in the gut. One important feature becomes clear with such a taxonomic analysis: there is seldom a single species of non-viral material present in these samples. For example, one sample contained ca. 80% reads mapping to Phyllostachys edulis (a bamboo), and another sample had ca. 20% reads mapping to Sphingobacteria bacterium, etc. Because the samples contents were so varied, a strategy to rapidly remove high frequency, sample-specific, non-viral reads was developed.",

These abundant, non-interesting reads are often host or commensal organism ribosomal or repetitive sequences. Manual subtraction of sequences mapping to individual species is possible, but becomes time-consuming when there are multiple species to identify and remove. An iterative search-classify-remove process, SLIM, was developed that addresses this difficulty (outlined in Figure 2). A read in the dataset is subjected to a nucleotide BLAST search, if a significant BLAST hit is returned (Expect value less than 0.001) the full BLAST hit sequence was retrieved from GenBank and a rapid mapping algorithm (MUMmer, [31]) was used to map all reads in the dataset to the GenBank hit (Figure 2). Reads mapping to the GenBank hit were removed from the dataset and categorized as virus or non-virus using identifiers from the GenBank entry. Reads not returning BLAST hits with an Expect value less than the threshold (0.001 used here) were placed into the unknown, mystery category. A new cycle of the process was then initiated with the remaining reads. This process limited the amount of computational time spent identifying and removing sequences from abundantly represented species (e.g. from bacterial ribosomal repeats).",

The initial 10 cycles used a batch size of 10 reads, increased to 100 reads/batch from cycles 11\u20131000 and then 300 reads per cycle thereafter. For each cycle, the numbers of reads classified as virus, non-virus and mystery, the number of reads removed and the remaining reads were plotted. The time required for 50 cycles (removal of ca 24,000 reads) was 95.7 minutes with 252 reads/minute removed. The highest rate of read classification by SLIM occurred in the initial cycles. The average classification rate for cycles 1\u201310 in this sample was 549 reads/minute for the first 10 cycles. Once the abundant reads were classified and removed, the classification rate per minute fell to that of simple BLASTn searching and SLIM provided no additional advantage (the rate for SLIM cycles 41\u201350 was 50.3 reads/minute). For comparison, straight BLASTn classification of reads using the same batch sizes and BLASTn settings proceeded at 30 reads/minute and would require 800 minutes to classify all 100,000 reads. Analysis of the entire 100,000 reads are required because the viral reads are distributed randomly throughout the 100,000 read set. If the goal is to identify all virus reads present at sufficient levels for secure virus identification by full genome assembly, straight BLASTn search required 800 minutes while SLIM performed this in 95.7 minutes providing an 8.4 fold increase in processing speed.",

We considered it more effective to leave the weaker homology reads in the remaining read set and allow BLAST to identify a closer homology hit at a later step.

Consistent with the frequent identification of this virus in fecal samples, cosavirus sequences were detected in 5 of the 20 samples (Figure 6). Reference-based mapping of the sample 4 reads to either of the two closest cosavirus genomes was unable to generate a complete genome (results not shown), however de novo assembly of the sample 4 reads generated a full length genome (Cosavirus_Amsterdam_1994) with the expected conserved features of a cosavirus (Figure 8). The genome has a low G/C content of 43.15%, similar to that reported for cosavirus (43.8%, [32]). A methionine codon at nucleotide position 746 is within a standard Kozak sequence (RNNAUGG : AATATGG) and a short stretch poly-pyrimidine is found just upstream (TTTTCCTTTT). Cosaviruses typically encode a single large open reading frame that is translated into a polyprotein and processed into 11 proteins. The Cosavirus_Amsterdam_1994 genome shows the expected large open reading frame of a cosavirus (Figure 8) with the predicted protease cleavage sites conserved relative to other cosaviruses (results not shown). According to the classification proposed by Kapusinszky et al. [33], Cosavirus_Amsterdam_1994 can be considered a new genotype within the D species, since the VP1 amino acid sequence is less than 88% identical to the other 5 cosavirus D-serotypes, while phylogenetically it clearly clusters within the cosavirus group D (Figure 8). As expected, the recombinant E2/D cosavirus (Nigeria_2007_JN867757) is phylogenetically placed between species D and E, when performing the analysis on the whole genome. According to our analysis, the closest relative to Cosavirus_Amsterdam_1994 is genotype D1 (VP1 AA sequence identity: 69.1%) and the most distant is genotype D3 (54.9%), while the identity range between all the other genotypes is 52.4\u201363.9%. To our knowledge, only 5 genotypes within the cosavirus D species are known (D1 to D5, excluding the E2/D recombinant whose VP1 belongs to species E). The new genotype described here is the first member of genotype D6. Interestingly, between the only 2 complete genomes of species D (D1 and D6), the recombinant cosavirus E2/D is more closely related to serotype D6 than to serotype D1 (AA identity after the breakpoint of E2/D vs. D1 is 94.3%, while vs. D6 is 96.8%).",

The method shows detection sensitivity approaching real-time PCR assay levels, however without a priori sequence information on the target viruses. For many of the viruses detected, the depth of sequencing provided by the method allows assembly of full viral genomes. In order to process the increased quantity of sequence data generated by this method, we have developed a virus identification algorithm, SLIM which employs iterative cycles of BLAST identification, clustering and read removal. The combined ViSeq and SLIM method facilitated the identification and assembly of 12 complete mammalian virus genomes (including a previously unknown cosavirus genotype) from the 20 fecal samples without prior sequence data on these viruses.",

One obvious step for future improvement lies in the handling of the BLAST unidentified reads. The current virus identification methods, including those described in this work, rely heavily on the data in GenBank. However, a large fraction of the sequence data generated here was not classified by nucleotide BLAST searches. Malboeuf et al. [42] also noted a similar high level of unknown sequences (48\u201395%) in their analysis of viral samples, highlighting the challenges of identifying short read data using BLAST.

This in turn may lead to leakage of bacterial endotoxin and T-cell activation promoting further HIV-1 replication. The diversity of the fecal virome during SIV infection showed a much higher level of vertebrate viral genome content and diversity in pathogenic SIV infection (Rhesus monkey) compared to non-pathogenic SIV infection (African Green Monkey) [12]. A number of potentially enteropathic viruses showed elevated levels during pathogenic SIV infection, including adenovirus. Consistent with the non-human primate data, adenovirus, HPV, HBV and norovirus were identified in sufficient levels in HIV-1 infected human fecal samples for full genome assembly. The methods described here would provide a sensitive method of tracking the fecal virome during AIDS progression and could reveal the replication of pathogenic viruses as a consequence of immune decline.",
