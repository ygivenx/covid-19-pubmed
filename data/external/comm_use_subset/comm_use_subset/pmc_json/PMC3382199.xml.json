Based on phylogenetic analysis of viral genomes, four species of HBoVs (HBoV1-4) have been identified [1], [7]\u2013[9]. HBoV1 is associated with respiratory tract diseases [1], [2], [12]\u2013[14]. HBoV2 and 3 have been detected in the respiratory tract, but are associated mainly with stool samples [8]\u2013[11], [15], [16]. HBoV4 has been detected in enteric infections [9]. However, as HBoVs are frequently co-detected with other viral infections in patients with respiratory or enteric infections, the exact roles of HBoVs in pathogenicity are unclear.",

The genome consists of four open reading frames (ORFs), encoding two nonstructural proteins (NS1 and NP1) and two overlapping capsid proteins (VP1 and VP2) [1]. The lack of a well-established cell culture system or animal model to propagate HBoVs has hampered understanding of the infection and pathogenicity of HBoVs. Studies have shown that the VP2 protein harbors the major antigen of HBoV and can form the empty virus-like particles (VLPs) which mimic HBoV virions morphologically and antigenically. The VP2 VLPs have been successfully used as antigens for detecting antibodies against HBoVs [17]\u2013[22].",

The prevalence of HBoV1, which is mainly detectable in children under two years old [23], is 2\u201319% in patients suffering from acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) worldwide as detected by PCR analysis [1], [2], [10], [12], [13], [23], [24]. The detection rate of HBoV2, HBoV3, and HBoV4 DNA in stool samples have been reported as 1-26%, 0.4-5%, and 0-2%, respectively [8], [9], [23], [25]. The prevalence of HBoV2-4 is higher in children than in adults according to some, but not all studies [8], [9], [11], [16], [25]. However, the data collected from patients may not represent HBoV infection in the general population as subclinical infections can occur and HBoV persists in the nasopharynx [26]\u2013[29].",

            "text": "Seroepidemilogical investigations of healthy populations may be more useful than patient studies in assessing the prevalence, spread, and exposure distribution of HBoVs in the population. The seroprevalence data also allow a comparison between the frequency of natural infection and the frequency of this virus in individuals with infections [30]. However, previous seroepidemiological studies of HBoVs have mainly focused on HBoV1. HBoV1 specific IgG antibodies were frequently detected in children, with a seropositive rate ranging from 40.7%-60% for children < four years old and up to >85% for those \u2265 four years old [19]. The seropositive rate of HBoV1 VP2-specific IgG antibodies is about 94% in healthy adults [18]. However, Kantola et al. recently showed cross-reactivity between the VP2 VLPs of HBoV1-4, which can largely affect the seropositive data of HBoV species. They showed that after depletion of cross-reactive antibodies, the approximate seroprevalences of HBoV1-4 in adults were 59%, 34%, 15%, and 2%, respectively [22]. However, the samples used in that study were only collected from healthy young people with a narrow range of age, including 115 subjects aged 21-32 years from Finland and 80 subjects aged 18-20 years from Pakistan. Given that the prevalence of a virus infection may vary by age as well as geographically, there remains to be a need to estimate the seroprevalence of HBoVs based on the detection of antibodies against HBoV1-4 from data of a more complete age range and from other global, geographic regions.",

The negativity of those samples was confirmed using a competition ELISA (cELISA) assay, in which the absorbance value at 450 nm did not change significantly with or without competition assays (Figure 3). Serum samples identified by cELISA as positive for individual HBoV species were obtained from 3 children and 4 adults and used as positive controls. However, we did not obtain a serum sample that was positive only for HBoV4 based on the assay; we used a sample from an adult that was IgG positive for HBoV1, HBoV2 and HBoV4.

Considerable cross-reactivity was found among the four HBoV species. However, human IgG antibodies against HBoV did not cross react with human parvovirus B19 and PARV4. These findings are consistent with those of a previous report [22], suggesting that to obtain accurate data of the seroprevalences of the different HBoV species, it is necessary to correct for cross-reactivity between the four HBoVs. Comparison of the VP2 protein sequences of HBoV1-4 revealed a high degree of similarity. These similarities may account for the cross-reactivity of these viruses, and should be confirmed through epitope analysis. Human parvovirus B19 and PARV4 have no antigen cross-reactivity with HBoVs, suggesting that human parvovirus B19 and PARV4 antibodies do not interfere with the HBoV seroprevalence results. The specificity of human bocavirus VLP-based ELISA with human sera has also been demonstrated with human parvovirus B19 VP2 and PARV 4 VP2 by Kantola et al [22].",

This finding agrees with reports on HBoVs prevalence obtained from most parts of the world using DNA analysis [10], [14], [16]. Of note, our finding that the seroprevalence of HBoV4 is much lower than that of HBoV1-3 is consistent with the rare detection of HBoV4 DNA in clinical samples [9]. Overall, the seroprevalence of HBoVs indicated by results of the cELISA decreased less in children than in adults in comparison to the results without competition, indicating that HBoV infections are more specific in children, especially for HBoV1 [22].

High Five cells (Invitrogen) were infected with recombinant baculoviruses at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of five and harvested after three days. Cells were suspended in 25 mM NaHCO3 solution at 2\u00d7107 cells/mL and kept on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation at 18,000 rpm for 10 min at 4\u00b0C, (NH4)2SO4 was added to the supernatants at a final concentration of 20% (w/v). Precipitants were harvested by centrifugation and dissolved in CsCl solutions with densities of 1.4 g/mL in Tris-EDTA buffer (10 mmol/L Tris, pH 8.7, 1 mmol/L EDTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100). After centrifugation at 35,000 rpm and 18\u00b0C for 39 h in a SW41 rotor centrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA), the fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using mouse sera against HBoV VP2 proteins. A Tecnai12 transmission electron microscope (FEI, Hillsboro, OR) at 80 kV was used to verify the morphology of the VLPs. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis were used to identify the VLPs [18].",
