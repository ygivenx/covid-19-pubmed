Viruses belonging to these families are large positive strand RNA viruses and are known to infect mammals, birds, fish and arthropods [1]. Entry into a host cell is usually mediated by an interaction between the virus spike glycoprotein and a cellular receptor [2]. After entry, the virus disassembles and a replication/transcription complex forms on double-membraned vesicles ([3] and references within). New subgenomic RNA is produced by a mechanism known as discontinuous transcription [4]. Coronavirus replication requires the production of negative-strand RNA from which positive-strand RNA is produced.

These open reading frames (ORFs) encode polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab which are cleaved by self-encoded proteases. The proteins encoded in ORF1a and ORF1a/b function as the replicase, making subgenomic RNAs and new copies of the genomic RNA [5]. Production of the pp1ab polyprotein requires the translating ribosome to change reading frame at the frameshift signal that bridges ORF1a and ORF1a/b. Like most viral frameshift signals, frameshifting at the coronavirus signal leads to expression of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), a protein essential for viral replication (for review, see [6]). The proteins upstream of the frameshift signal include the predicted proteases and other uncharacterized proteins [5]. We have previously suggested that the ratio of the pp1a and pp1ab proteins might affect the regulation and production of genomic and subgenomic RNA [7].",

During programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1PRF), the tRNAs positioned on the slippery site uncouple from the mRNA and reconnect in the new reading frame. The second stem of the stimulatory pseudoknot is formed by the distal 3\u2019 sequence base-pairing with residues in the loop region of the first stem loop. Unlike other frameshift-stimulating pseudoknots the SARS pseudoknot contains an additional internal stem loop [8,9,10]. The function of this structure, called stem 3, is unknown. We have shown that alterations to the SARS coronavirus frameshift signal affect frameshifting efficiency [9,11]. Reduction in frameshifting efficiency is expected to result in decreased expression of the frameshift proteins, including the RdRP. Some mutations that reduced frameshifting were associated with a several-fold reduction in the amount of genomic RNA [7]. Unfortunately, the mutations employed in prior studies altered both the nucleic acid and protein sequences making it impossible to separate the contributions of RNA and protein. Here, analyses using synonymous protein coding mutations demonstrate that the region of the genome that harbors the frameshift signal affects the regulation of genomic and subgenomic RNA production without altering protein sequence. We discuss possible reasons for this.",

There are at least three different types of structures used by the coronaviruses to stimulate frameshifting. Some coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV, use a three stemmed pseudoknot, others such as human coronavirus 229E have an \u2018elaborated pseudoknot\u2019 or kissing stem-loops, while the avian infectious bronchitis virus utilizes a two stemmed pseudoknot [9,12,13]. That these diverse coronaviruses retain some sequence between stems 1 and 2 yet have quite different frameshift stimulating structures is intriguing. One inference that can be made is that the RNA sequence, or a structure formed by it, is involved in some other aspect of the virus lifecycle. Our initial hypothesis was that a regulatory element was contained within this sequence. Here we describe deletion and mutagenesis experiments with a dual luciferase reporter to show that the effect the sequence between stems 1 and 2 has on frameshifting efficiency is due to structural changes those mutations cause in the pseudoknot. Further, we show by making synonomous mutations in the virus that different levels of frameshifting efficiency affect the production of genomic and subgenomic RNA differently. This could be caused by disruption of a regulatory element or the altered ratio of proteins derived from the coding region flanking the frameshift signal.",

For example, while stem 2 is essential for frameshifting, stem 3 is not. Even small changes in Stem 2 (e.g., replacing or deleting the bulged adenosine in stem 2 with a cytosine) reduced frameshifting to levels similar to those observed with the complete disruption of stem 2 [9]. In contrast, altering the bulged adenosine in stem 3 or disruption of stem 3 promoted only modest changes in frameshifting [9]. These observations engendered the hypothesis that stem 3 formation may affect frameshifting by enhancing or facilitating the formation of stem 2. ",

            "text": "Experiments were designed to test the effects of changes to the length of stem 3 while still maintaining a stable structure. Beginning with the wild-type stem 3 containing nine paired bases and a nine residue loop, the following series of mutants were constructed. First, the loop capping stem 3 was replaced with a shorter tetraloop; the L2Tetra construct contains ten paired bases and a four residue loop. This was used as the basis for construction of two additional tetraloop constructs with progressively shorter stem 3 structures: L2Tetra/S3-4bp, containing only four paired bases in the stem, and L2Tetra/S3-2bp, which has only two paired bases. The 5\u2019-uucg-3\u2019 tetraloop sequence used in the L2Tetra/S3-4bp mutant was selected because the last base-pair before the tetraloop affects its formation. The closing pair for UNCG tetraloops is usually C-G compared to the G-C closing base-pair found in CUUG tetraloops. All of the truncated structures promoted frameshifting at levels equal to or greater than the wild-type pseudoknot structure using a dual luciferase reporter assay (Figure 1). Interestingly, the L2Tetra/S3-4bp mutant stimulated frameshifting at 25.1% compared to the 15 to 17.5% observed for the other stem 3 mutants. It is possible that the difference in the tetraloop contributed to the slight increase in frameshifting efficiency. These results, and experiments reported by Brierley et al., for another coronavirus [12] indicate that the length of stem 3 does not play a critical role in frameshifting, suggesting that it may serve some other function.

            "text": "While alteration of the bulged adenosine in Stem 2, or disruption of Stem 2 primary and secondary structures dramatically reduces frameshifting efficiency, neither the bulged adenosine in Stem 3, nor the sequence of Stem 3 itself, have similarly strong roles [9,11]. However, given the ability of tetraloop-capped stem 3 mutants to promote high levels of frameshifting, we asked if these mutations could compensate for deletion of the bulged adenosine in stem 2. To this end, the bulged adenosines in stems 2 and 3 were deleted both individually and together in the context of the L2Tetra construct (Figure 2). L2Tetra was chosen as the baseline because, among the tetraloop mutants, it most closely represents the wild-type sequence. Deletion of the bulged adenosine in stem 2 (L2TetraS2\u0394) reduced frameshifting by 84.2% (17.5% versus 2.77%, p = 9.3 \u00d7 10\u221219, Figure 2). When the bulged adenosine from stem 3 was removed (L2TetraS3\u0394) a similar reduction of 82.5% was observed (17.5% versus 3.1%, p = 1.1 \u00d7 10\u221219). Interestingly, removal of both adenosines (L2TetraS2\u0394S3\u0394) partially restored frameshifting with only a 28.2% reduction in frameshifting (17.5% versus 12.6%, p = 7.5 \u00d7 10\u22125). Bulged adenosines, which are known to bend helices [14], may be participating in formation of a functional pseudoknot structure. Indeed, many frameshift-stimulating structures have bent conformations that are postulated to help effect frameshifting [15,16,17]. Importantly, however, the contribution of the bulges in the SARS pseudoknot is not the same in the context of the native stem 3/loop 2. Specifically, removing both bulged adenosines (S2\u0394S3\u0394) from the wild-type backbone decreased rates of frameshifting by 93% (15.3 versus 1.06%, p = 1.7 \u00d7 10\u221218), similar to that observed with the removal of the stem 2 bulge alone (Figure 2). Together these results suggest that stabilization of stem 3 assists in the formation or stability of stem 2, which in turn is essential for frameshifting. However, the actual sequence of loop 2 or the tetraloop-capping stem 3 also affected frameshifting efficiency, either through the stabilization of stem 3 or the formation of stem 2 itself, thus implicating the nucleotides in loop 2 or the tetraloop in tertiary structure interactions. Further evidence comes from the chemical protection data (below), demonstrating that the altered sequence of loop 2 affects the structure of stems 2 and 3. Although secondary structure predictions indicate that the nucleotides in loop 2 are not part of a helix, those nucleotides are susceptible to both single- and double-strand-specific nucleases [9] suggesting that these nucleotides participate, at least part of the time, in some ordered structural state.

A control plasmid, L2-UCC, with a synonymous mutation in loop 2 was also made. The AGU codon was changed to UCC because the latter is present at the same position in the TGEV coronavirus and would be expected to have a minimal impact.

The observed effects in vivo should therefore reflect changes related to RNA structure within the frameshifting signal, rather than changes in the function of the encoded proteins. The silent codon changes in S3D promoted moderate reductions in -1 PRF efficiency as compared to the silent S2 mutants (3.95% versus 0.19%; compare Figure 3A and 3C.

In addition to the expected changes in reactivity to the mutated bases in stem 3, bases in the 3\u2019 region of both loop 2 which caps stem 3 and the loop joining stems 2 and 3 (L3) also showed increased reactivity for S3D. The S2\u0394S3\u0394 mutant was also more reactive to NMIA. However, the NMIA reactivity pattern of the S3D mutant, with more reactivity in the 5\u2019 proximal end of stem 3 and the 3\u2019 portion of loop 2, differed from that seen for S2\u0394S3\u0394 in which reactivity was more clustered in the 5\u2019 portion of loop 2 and adjacent stem 3 nucleotides.

Similar changes in viral RNA ratios were seen with viruses with mutated slippery sites, implicating a broader region of this part of the genome as being involved in regulation of transcription [7]. While the changes in the previous report resulted in an altered protein sequence, it is unknown if the pseudoknot structure in the slippery site mutants was affected.

The reduction in virion-associated gRNA levels could occur if a packaging signal was disrupted. Disruption of a packaging signal would result in fewer complete virions and lower TCID50 and gRNA values as observed for the S3D mutant. Although the efficiency of frameshifting is similar for the L2-UCC and S3D mutants the gRNA levels differ by several log. The stabilization of L2-UCC stem 3 structure and loss of S3D stem 3 structure (see Figure 3) also support the idea that this region may contain a packaging signal.",

The structures of the pseudoknots were probed using the selective 2\u2019-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) procedure of Wilkinson et al. [22]. SHAPE analysis utilizes N-methylisatoic anhydride (NMIA), which tests the local backbone flexibility of RNA. More flexible nucleotides assume conformations that are reactive to NMIA which irreversibly acylates the ribose 2\u2019-hydroxyl groups. This then presents as a stop upstream of the modified base during primer extension. Thus, a more intense band in the primer extension autoradiograph represents a more flexible region of the RNA. Briefly, DNA was amplified from each mutant plasmid using PCR master mix (Fermentas Inc., Glen Burnie, MD) and a forward-direction primer containing the T7 RNA promoter; T7forSHAPE, 5'-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAAGATGCACCTGATGAAATGG-3' and the reverse-direction primer; revSHAPE, 5'-GCCCATATCGTTTCATAGCTTC-3'. RNA was synthesized from the PCR products using the Ambion T7 MEGAscript kit (Austin, TX) as per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. RNA (2 pmol) in a volume of 12 \u03bcL was denatured at 95 \u00baC and cooled on ice. Reaction buffer (6 \u03bcL) containing 333 mM HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid) pH 8.0, 20 mM MgCl2, and 222 mM NaCl was added to each RNA sample and the mixture was incubated at 37 \u00baC for 20 minutes. The reactions were split into two equal aliquots, one with 1 \u03bcL Dimethyl Sulfoxide, the other with 1 \u03bcL of 65 mM N-methylisatoic anhydride (NMIA), and incubated at 37 \u00baC for 45 minutes. The RNA was then precipitated with 90 \u03bcL H2O, 4 \u03bcL 5M NaCl, 1 \u03bcL 20 mg/mL glycogen, 2 \u03bcL 100 mM EDTA pH 8.0, and 350 \u03bcL ethanol overnight at \u221280\u00baC.

RNA (7 \u03bcL) was incubated with 32P-labeled oligonucleotide (3 \u03bcL) at 65 \u00baC for 5 minutes, 35 \u00b0C for 5 minutes and cooled to 0 \u00baC. Reverse transcription reactions were performed using SuperScript III enzyme (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at 52 \u00baC for 20 minutes.

            "text": "The correlation between stem 3 structure and gRNA levels indicates that a structural requirement in stem 3 is required for optimal RNA production but we cannot, at this stage rule out a frameshifting threshold similar to that observed for the yeast double-stranded RNA virus M1 [31]. That is, if frameshifting drops below a certain frequency, the change in the ratio of pp1a to pp1ab results in a dramatic reduction in gRNA production. Indeed, recent reports describing the function of a nonstructural protein (nsp8) encoded upstream of the frameshift signal provide an alternative hypothesis to regulatory element hypothesis investigated in this work. Nsp8 was initially described as a non-canonical RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and produced as part of the pp1a protein whether or not frameshifting occurs [32]. In contrast, the canonical RdRP Nsp12 is produced as part of the pp1ab protein only if frameshifting occurs. This, in conjunction with our data suggests that the nsp8 polymerse might direct sgRNA production and that the RdRP encoded in nsp12 is predominantly used for gRNA production. It has been hypothesized that coronavirus RNA synthesis involves structurally and functionally separable RNA synthesising complexes [33]. The nsp7+nsp8 complex from three different coronaviruses have recently been shown to have primer-independent RNA polymerase activity [33,34] in contrast to the nsp12 RdRP which is primer dependent [35]. Currently the details regarding coronavirus RNA synthesis are very limited and do not explain how the polymerases distinguish between templates or prime synthesis. te Velthuis and colleagues suggested that the separate RdRPs may influence plus and minus strand synthesis [33] but our results indicate that the division might be between genomic and subgenomic RNA synthesis. The RT-PCR for detection of gRNA and sgRNA in our study generated a cDNA intermediate using random hexamers and because of this the analyses performed here do not distinguish between the production of positive- and negative-strands nor between mRNA and sgRNA. Thus, we do not know if the regulatory sequences or proteins regulating genomic RNA production act upon the positive- or negative-strand replication intermediates or transcription intermediates.",

Similar to previously described viruses containing mutations in the slippery site of the frameshift signal [7], here we show that mutations to the SARS-CoV frameshift stimulating mRNA pseudoknot can also affect the production of viral genomic RNA. In both instances, the abundance of viral genomic RNA was reduced to 10-fold lower levels than the subgenomic RNA and several orders of magnitude below that of the wild-type virus. It is not clear if this result is due to a change in the abundance of gRNA available to be transcribed to sgRNA or if it is attributable to other factors, such as interactions between the gRNA and other proteins or RNA elements as discussed above. It is also possible that the synonymous changes altered the rate of translation and/or the folding of the RdRP [36] which, in turn, could have affected production of genomic and/or subgenomic RNA. Regardless of the mechanism, our observations provide a backdrop against which new questions about coronvirus replication and transcription may be explored.",
