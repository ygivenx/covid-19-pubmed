            "text": "IR thermography\u2014also known as thermal imaging\u2014is a non-contact and noninvasive imaging approach that has been exploited for a wide range of biomedical and non-biomedical applications. It has been studied for use in cancer imaging [1\u20137], ischemic monitoring and vascular disease [8, 9], wound assessment [10], corneal temperature measurement [11\u201313], diagnosis of rheumatologic diseases [14], fever screening [15\u201326], etc. However, significant difficulties have been encountered in clinical translation of IR thermography. Standardization in different aspects of medical thermography, including tools (both acquisition hardware and processing algorithm) and examination environment, has always been a general agreement among the community of medical thermography [27]. The concept of standardization in thermography was introduced by the European Association of Thermography in 1978 and later a proposal for a standard was outlined by Clark et al [27]. Factors such as examination room conditions (temperature, humidity, etc.), thermographic imager accuracy, and image analysis methods were discussed in this proposal. Thereafter, with the steady increase in development and utility of IR thermography in medical applications, more detailed criteria for deployment of IR thermography were discussed and presented, resulting in improved diagnostic capability and reliability [28, 29]. Following two guidance documents published by the Standards, Productivity and Innovation Board of Singapore (SPRING Singapore), the International Standards Organization (ISO) produced two documents [18]: one describes the essential performance specification of suitable imaging systems for fever detection in humans [30], and the other describes the deployment, implementation and operational guidelines for identifying febrile humans using a screening thermograph [31]. These two documents lay a foundation for the best practices of evaluation and application of fever-screening IR thermographs (IRTs). Many parameters are defined in these documents. Assessment of these parameters is more important for absolute temperature measurement (e.g. fever screening) than relative temperature measurement.",

IRTs and NCITs enable nearly real-time estimation of body temperature by detecting IR emissions, which may result in more prompt quarantine of infectious individuals. Currently, NCITs remain a more popular choice for fever screening, and all IRTs cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration have been limited to use in an adjunctive capacity and/or as a relative measurement. A document from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates that IRTs are not as accurate as NCITs and may be more difficult to use effectively [35]. However, there has been increasing evidences in the literature that IRTs can provide greater accuracy in estimating body temperature than NCITs. A study directly compared an NCIT to three IRTs indicated that the NCIT was less accurate [36]. Another study has shown that forehead skin temperatures measured by most NCITs are a much less reliable indicator of fever than inner canthi temperatures, the suggested measuring spots for IRTs [19, 30, 37].",

There have been standard and technical report recommending specific device performance testing requirements as well as best practices for thermographic fever screening [30, 31]. Currently, IEC 80601-2-59 is the only international standard for performance evaluation of IRTs intended for fever screening. However, some testing procedures and performance characteristics in this standard are not well-defined and the reference papers provide no discussion of their suitability or practical demonstration of their implementation. The purpose of this study is to evaluate, optimize and demonstrate the utility of a battery of test methods for standardized, objective and quantitative assessment of IRT performance based on IEC 80601-2-59.

All the mentioned clauses (e.g., clause 201.101.6) in this paper are cited from this standard unless otherwise specified. A screening thermograph (ST) is composed of an IRT and an external temperature reference source (ETRS, usually a blackbody with known temperature and emissivity\u2014clause 201.3.205), and in some cases, a computer and software for data acquisition, processing and storage. A calibration source (CS, a highly accurate blackbody with known and traceable temperature and emissivity\u2014clause 201.3.202) is employed as a target to perform standard compliance tests. A workable target plane (WTP) is a specific region of target plane that meets the performance requirements (clause 201.3.215). Images of WTPs are used for temperature measurement. A minimum WTP image resolution of 320 (horizontal) \u00d7 240 (vertical) is required (clause 201.12.2.103). During each test, the temperature should be maintained between 18\u00b0C and 24\u00b0C and relative humidity between 10% and 75% (clause 201.5.3). Airflow from ventilation ducts should be deflected to minimize forced cooling or heating of the target (clause 201.7.9.3.9). The laboratory space chosen for IRT performance evaluation should be checked to ensure that no source of IR radiation (e.g., incandescent and halogen lightings) surrounds the experimental setup (clause 201.7.9.3.9).",

The reflected temperature could be measured based on the \u201creflector\u201d method specified in a standard [45]. A thermographic inspection of the laboratory (e.g., walls, air vents, and devices) was conducted using a hand-held IRT (FLIR ONE, FLIR Systems Inc., Nashua, NH). Since no external source of IR radiation was found, the reflected temperature was assumed to be the same as the ambient temperature. The difference between the temperatures calculated based on measured Trefl and assumed Trefl over the range from 30\u00b0C to 40\u00b0C is less than 0.08%, confirming that the assumption is reasonable. Approximating Trefl with the ambient temperature is for ease of testing. However, this approximation should be verified for a given system under a given environment. In case of the presence of an excessive surrounding IR radiation, reflected temperature should be measured per ASTM recommendations [45]. Ambient IR transmissivity could be less than unity in long distance imaging and high relative humidity conditions. But given the current testing at 0.8 m, an assumption of \u03c4atm = 1.0 was implemented. The measuring distance, relative humidity and ambient temperature can affect \u03c4atm and such assumption should be verified for a different system under a different environment.",

The working distance between the blackbodies and the IRTs was d = 0.8 m (exception: working distance was set to 0.15 m for IRT-1 and 0.05 m for IRT-2 for short distance uniformity test and 0.35 m for MRTD evaluation inside a temperature chamber, respectively).

BB-2 was repositioned at 29 locations throughout the WTP including four corners, center, and 24 random locations. At each location, a thermal image of BB-2 was captured by the ST. BB-2 temperature was recorded from a single image pixel value (no averaging algorithm was implemented) of the thermal image. Uniformity of the WTP was then calculated from the maximum difference between the 29 measured values. The uniformity value of an ST should be less than 0.2\u00b0C (clause 201.101.6). A larger uniformity value indicates worse uniformity. This procedure was performed separately for ST-1 and ST-2. For this study, this method is called IEC-29-pixels method.",

It determines the IRT efficiency for discriminating details in a scene and provides insights into its sensitivity and spatial resolution. In this study, MRTD compliance was checked based on the ASTM E1213-14 standard [50]. The MRTD test target (named 4-bar target) was an aluminum plate with high-emissivity coating. Five groups of four bars were etched away to obtain five spatial frequencies, between 0.04 to 0.2 cycles/mrad (measured at the working distance of 0.8 m). The 4-bar target was mounted in front of the extended surface of BB-2 so the BB-2 surface can be seen through the etched bars. The aspect ratio of each bar was 1:7. The differential temperature (\u0394T) between the etched bars (the background BB-2) and the conjugate bars (the area on the aluminum plate between the etched bars, maintained at the ambient temperature) was adjusted using the BB-2 controller. IRTs were focused on the target, located in the center of the WTP with the bars in the vertical direction, and images were captured and viewed on a monitor with proper brightness and contrast. The resolution of the monitor should be high enough so that the MRTD is only affected by the input thermal images instead of the monitor. Initially, \u0394T was set to zero, then gradually increased in increments of 0.005\u00b0C, until the observer could visually distinguish the four bars on the screen. The mean temperatures of the etched bars and the conjugate bars were then calculated from captured thermograms, and their difference was recorded. No offset compensation is necessary for this experiment since the etched and conjugate bars are imaged in the same frame at the same time. The test was then repeated with three other observers. For each particular spatial frequency, the lowest recorded temperature difference with a detection probability of at least 50% was selected as the MRTD value [50] (in this study at least two of the four observers shall resolve the bars). The data were then plotted against spatial frequency as a metric of IRT performance. The MRTD shall be less than or equal to 0.1\u00b0C (clause 201.101.5).",

Due to the chamber size constraint, working distance was decreased from 0.8 m to 0.35 m.

The second is a vignetting artifact (intensity reduction near the corners), likely caused by the lens. In IRT-2, striping artifacts are less apparent than in IRT-1. However, a dark circle when the camera focused at 0.05 m (and a brightened circle when the camera focused at the working distance) is seen in the center of the image, likely a narcissus effect due to IRT-2 optics [49]. A vignetting artifact, especially when the camera focused at the working distance, is also apparent in the IRT-2 image. These thermograms show the uniformity changes at different focal lengths for both IRT-1 and IRT-2 and the change for IRT-2 is more significant. Therefore, the camera should be focused at the working distance for uniformity evaluation to avoid the effect of focal length.",

From Fig 4b, the SD values are stable with the change in pixel numbers, especially when the pixel number is larger than 1000. The figure also shows that for the same image, the SD values can distinguish the uniformity difference from different regions: the uniformity within the FOV (the \u201cIRT-2, FOV\u201d curve) is worse than the selected WTP (the \u201cIRT-2\u201d curve). The smaller error bars in Fig 4b than those in Fig 4a indicate a better repeatability of the SD measure than the maximum difference measure.

On average, IRT-2 showed a better level of uniformity than IRT-1 within the WTP per the modified-29-pixels and all-pixels methods. While IRT-2 benefits from its higher sensor resolution and larger FOV compared to IRT-1, the area outside of its WTP might not be as useful. The all-pixel method always resulted in higher level of non-uniformity as discussed in the previous paragraph. From Fig 5, IRT-1 failed to satisfy the IEC requirement regardless of the test method used.

Fixed pattern noise can be removed with the help of a dark frame (for dark signal noise) or offset and gain for each pixel (for photon response noise). Temporal noise can be suppressed by averaging multiple images. Larger number of frames for averaging may lead to a higher level of uniformity for a static object, but require longer image acquisition time and may introduce blurring of the averaged image for a moving object. Presumably, motion artifact is negligible in standardized fever screening where subjects are asked to remain still at a given distance from the imager. While such image processing algorithms can be implanted in the IRT image processing pipeline to reduce image noise and improve uniformity before the output, they are not the topics of this manuscript. Our focus in this paper is on the evaluation of a whole thermograph system including its image processing pipeline (i.e., we consider the whole system including hardware and software as a black box). We consider images from the system as the final ones and should not be further processed to artificially improve the uniformity results.",

            "text": "The all-pixels method is a more comprehensive way of uniformity evaluation since it considers the entire pixels of WTP and is as fast as the modified-29-pixels approach. Moreover, finding a WTP with best uniformity within a FOV is easy using the all-pixels method. However, the uniformity value based on the all-pixels method is much larger than other methods since the value is calculated from the maximum and minimum values of all the pixels. On the other hand, the uniformity value will be rather stable if we use SD as a uniformity measure. Our data (Fig 4b) have shown that the SD values from randomly selected pixels are rather constant if the pixel number is larger than 1000. Therefore, a simple way of evaluating uniformity is to calculate the SD values from all the pixels within the region of interest. Of course, the uniformity criterion based on SD is different from the IEC-29-pexels criterion of 0.2\u00b0C. IRT-2 has uniformity values of ~0.2\u00b0C based on the modified-29-pixels method (Fig 5) and ~0.05\u00b0C based on the all-pixels-SD method (Fig 4b). Therefore, it is reasonable to mirror the IEC uniformity criterion of 0.2\u00b0C to a criterion values of approximate 0.05\u00b0C based on the all-pixels-SD method. The maximum difference and SD of a large number of pixel intensity values do have correlation. Statistically, if we assume the intensity values of the pixels has a normal distribution and the largest intensity difference of 0.2 \u00b0C cover 95.45% of confidence level (a confidence level covered by 4 times of SD values), then the SD of the pixel intensity values can be directly calculated as 0.05\u00b0C (0.2/4 = 0.05). Therefore, we propose to use the all-pixels-SD method to evaluate the uniformity and set the uniformity criterion as SD of 0.05\u00b0C.",

In general, combined stability and drift was improved by 80% and 95% for ST-1 and ST-2 than IRT-1 and IRT-2, respectively. These findings also provide quantitative support for the use of an ETRS during screening measurements, if necessary, as noted in the standard. For drift analysis, the standard requires that the experiment should be repeated every day for the device\u2019s calibration interval or two weeks, whichever is longer. We measured the device drift over two weeks since our focus is on the evaluation methods instead of the device evaluation and we assume the ETRS has high stability and low drift and has been calibrated per the calibration interval. From the experience of thermal camera drift measurements at National Physical Laboratory, drift caused by lens and/or detector changes can only truly be determined over a period longer than one month. The standard requires data acquisition every 5\u201315 seconds for 8 hours each day for stability and drift measurement, which will accumulate a huge amount of data for drift measurement. We evaluated the stability and drift based on longer data acquisition intervals of 30, 60, 120 and 300 seconds, and got similar results for different intervals.

Therefore, uniformity testing needs to be performed by focusing at the working distance but placing the CS at a shorter distance so that the CS is defocused to reduce its non-uniform effects on uniformity evaluation.

The MRTD values in both directions and at different locations should be averaged. The technique recommended in the standards is subjective and time-consuming. The objective test method described in this paper could streamline the procedure and improve consistency. We suggest to average frames captured in 0.2 seconds and calculate the contrast level of the averaged frame to simulate the human eye/brain time integration system. Our data show that 10% contrast can be defined as the minimum recognizable contrast level.

The highest frequency a camera can detect is limited by both the optics (cutoff frequency) and the sensor pixel size (Nyquist frequency).
