Given the evidence that TB patients develop immune dysfunction, immune intervention regulating counterproductive inflammation and/or enhancing anti-TB immune responses may be beneficial for clinical treatment of TB and MDR TB (2, 3). While immune therapy has been long considered attractive for adjunctive clinical treatment of TB (especially MDR TB); successful immunotherapeutic modalities have not been identified (4\u20136). In fact, little is known about human TB immunity except that human CD4+ T cells are generally believed to be important for TB resistance (2, 7\u201310) Accumulating evidence suggests that \u03b3\u03b4 T cells play a critical role in TB protective immune responses and may be key both as early responders to acute infection and for bridging innate and adaptive immunity (2, 11\u201318).",

Natural phosphoantigens, including prenyl pyrophosphate synthetic precursors of lipid and steroid biosynthesis and phosphorylated nucleotides, are secreted in increased amounts as by-products from infecting pathogens and host cells altered by infection (23\u201325).

            "text": "Specific to M. tuberculosis, earlier biochemical analysis identified 4 molecules from M. tuberculosis lysates, termed TUBag1 to -4, that stimulated the proliferation of a human \u03b39\u03b42 T cell clone (G115) (26). These TUBag compounds have been shown to be active in the nanomolar range (i.e., with bioactivities up to 30,000-fold higher than that of isopentenyl pyrophosphate [IPP]), thus suggesting that these molecules could account for most of the \u03b39\u03b42 T cell-stimulating activity recovered from mycobacteria. Shortly after isolation of TUBag1 to -4, the first \u03b39\u03b42 T cell antigen structurally identified was IPP, a metabolite all organisms use to synthesize isoprenoid compounds. The prenyl pyrophosphate family of phosphoantigens includes isomers, conjugates, or concatemers of IPP (27). Exchange of the pyrophosphate moiety for a single phosphate moiety significantly reduces the ability of these isoprenoids to stimulate the expansion of \u03b39\u03b42 T cells (23, 28). In contrast, alteration of the alkyl chain or conjugation to UTP had only minor influences on the potency of these phosphoantigens to expand \u03b39\u03b42 T cells, suggesting that IPP is the naturally occurring prenyl pyrophosphate capable of stimulating \u03b39\u03b42 T cell expansion. However, the concentration of IPP present in bacterial lysates is not sufficient to stimulate \u03b39\u03b42 T cell expansions (29). The most potent natural phosphoantigen described so far is a phosphorylated intermediate produced by Eubacteria and some eukaryotic organisms, called (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enylpyrophosphate (HMBPP, also known as HDMA-PP for hydroxy-dimethyl-allyl-pyrophosphate). This compound is 10,000 to 30,000-fold more potent for stimulation of \u03b39\u03b42 T cells than IPP (30, 31). In addition, synthetic bromohydrin pyrophosphate (BrHPP) is a strong activator of \u03b39\u03b42 T cells and has been tested for tumor immunotherapy and as a vaccine component (21, 32\u201334).",

We found that \u03b39\u03b42 T cells capable of inhibiting intracellular M. tuberculosis growth represent only a subset of the phosphoantigen (IPP and HMBPP)-responsive \u03b39\u03b42 T cells. This protective subset expresses a more oligoclonal set of T cell receptor (TCR) sequences, capable of pathogen-specific recognition of M. tuberculosis-infected human macrophages. We hypothesized that the high potency of natural HMBPP phosphoantigen present in mycobacterial extracts could obscure detection of the protective \u03b39\u03b42 T cell subset. We also hypothesize that live mycobacteria express antigens (Ags), other than the previously identified phosphoantigens, which are required to induce the subset of \u03b39\u03b42 T cells protective against M. tuberculosis intracellular replication. These natural TB-specific \u03b39\u03b42 T cell Ags must be identified and purified for use as optimal immunotherapies or vaccines targeting the protective subset of \u03b39\u03b42 T cells.",

We first ruled out protein, nucleic acid, and apolar lipids with basic separations and enzymatic digestions. Mild acid hydrolysis, which digests complex carbohydrate structures, had the largest effect on specific activity. Fractions derived from a 10:10:3 chloroform-methanol-water extraction of M. tuberculosis H37Rv cells primarily consisted of glycolipids and carbohydrates. Antigenic fractions were tested for the ability to clonally expand human \u03b3\u03b4 T cells with inhibitory activity for intracellular mycobacteria. The highest biological specific activity (SA) was found in the most polar fractions eluted off silica columns with 100% methanol. Further fractionation using size exclusion column chromatography (G-50 column) was utilized and demonstrated the highest activity in an early-eluting fraction. These complex, antigenically active fractions were analyzed via matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization\u2013time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS), thin-layer chromatography (TLC), 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). These analyses revealed that methylglucose lipopolysaccharides (mGLP) are the predominant components present in all of the most highly active fractions. Further identification, purification, and synthesis of the novel mycobacterial lipid components which induce TB protective \u03b39\u03b42 T cells may result in new immune intervention strategies for sensitive and drug-resistant TB.",

Percentages of mycobacterial growth inhibition were determined as follows: percent inhibition = 100 \u2212 [100 \u00d7 (DPM in the presence of \u03b39\u03b42 T cells) (DPM in the absence of \u03b39\u03b42 T cells)], where DPM is disintegrations per minute. In an effort to normalize data and apply a standard quantifiable metric to specific antimycobacterial activity of \u03b39\u03b42 T cells, we defined specific activity (SA) as (expansion index) \u00d7 (percent inhibition of intracellular mycobacterial growth)/dry weight of sample.",

Therefore, our recent screening strategy to reveal \u03b39\u03b42 T cell antigens focused on the identification of M. tuberculosis fractions that not only expand \u03b39\u03b42 T cells but also expand \u03b39\u03b42 T cells with the ability to inhibit intracellular mycobacteria. We first verified that expansion of protective \u03b39\u03b42 T cells did not require infection of host cells with viable mycobacteria by comparing the ability of MtbWL-expanded \u03b39\u03b42 T cells and live BCG-expanded \u03b39\u03b42 T cells to inhibit intracellular mycobacterial growth. Similar preparations of MtbWL-expanded and live BCG-expanded \u03b39\u03b42 T cells produced IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, and granzyme A (GzmA) (Fig. 1A and B). Importantly, MtbWL-expanded and live BCG-expanded \u03b39\u03b42 T cells displayed similar functional capacities to inhibit intracellular mycobacterial growth (Fig. 1C).

Most proteinase digestions cleave proteins into peptides that are 10 to 20 amino acids long, which remain large enough to be loaded onto MHC molecules. Thus, two proteinases were used to increase the likelihood that MHC binding motifs would be cleaved by at least one treatment.

Chloroform-methanol-water (10:10:3) extractions of whole M. tuberculosis cells were found to retain the greatest biological activity. The resulting extract was subsequently loaded onto a silica gel column and products were eluted with an increasing methanol gradient. All eluted fractions were tested for the ability to expand inhibitory \u03b39\u03b42 T cells. The highest biological SA was found in the most polar fractions eluted with 100% methanol (Fig. 3A). A 100% MeOH fraction was analyzed by TLC and stained with \u03b1-naphthol to detect carbohydrate, ninhydrin to detect peptide, and Dittmer-Lester to detect phosphate (Fig. 3B). The crude fraction of CHCl3-CH3OH-H2O (10:10:3) starting material (left lanes) and the further-resolved 100% methanol sample (right lanes) demonstrate the complexity of the initial extract and the partial purification success achieved with the downstream 100% MeOH fraction. The consensus analyses identified products rich in hexose residues, devoid of products containing amide bonds or peptides, and with few phosphate and no aromatic (phenyl) residues. Additionally, NMR spectra revealed a significant presence of O-methyl groups and anomeric protons corresponding to hexosyl residues (Fig. 4A). MALDI-TOF analysis revealed a series of high-molecular-mass products (\u223c2,100 to 3,900 amu), with profiles similar to that reported for the spectra of methylglucose lipopolysaccharide (46\u201348) (Fig. 4B and C). The MALDI-TOF data directly support the data obtained from the NMR spectra and GC-MS analyses of alditol acetate derivatives of the enriched fractions (Fig. 4D). GC-MS analyses corroborated the NMR findings and further identified 3-O- and 6-O-methylglucose in these highly active fractions. In order to achieve further enrichment of mGLP (estimated by GC-MS [Fig. 5]) from the crude 100% CH3OH fraction, the methanol fraction was dried, reconstituted in water, and subjected to size exclusion (Sephadex G-50; MWCO of 1,500 to 30,000) chromatography. \u03b39\u03b42 T cells expanded with the fraction from 62.5 to 70.0 ml, eluting after the void volume of the column (6-O-Me-Glc, Glc, and 3-O-Me Glc in a ratio of 6:4:1) was found to exhibit the greatest antimycobacterial activity (Fig. 6A). In addition, the results in Fig. 6B demonstrate that the mGLP fractions induce significant proliferative expansion only in \u03b39\u03b42 T cells and not in \u03b1\u03b2 T cells. Furthermore, Fig. 6C shows that blocking BTN3A1, known to be involved in phosphoantigen activation of \u03b39\u03b42 T cells, also inhibits mGLP-induced \u03b39\u03b42 T cell activation. To determine if the mGLP-enriched fractions induced \u03b39\u03b42 T cells in a TCR-dependent manner, or simply via innate immune activation receptors, we utilized an anti-V\u03b39 blocking MAb known to inhibit \u03b39\u03b42 T cell responses induced by IPP and HMBPP. These results confirm that the mGLP fractions contain antigens capable of inducing TCR-dependent responses (Fig. 6D). Based on these findings, we hypothesized that 6-O-methylglucose lipopolysaccharide, or a derivative or similar product thereof, is responsible for the biological activity inducing the mycobacterium-inhibitory capacity of \u03b39\u03b42 T cells.",

            "text": "Previously identified small antigens known to stimulate \u03b3\u03b4 T cells include phosphorylated metabolites generated in the methyl erythritol pathway in mycobacteria. The most representative stimulatory molecules are isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl pyrophosphate (HMBPP). Both are very small molecules, with molecular weights of 246 and 262, respectively, and are composed of one isoprene unit to which a diphoshate is attached. The phosphate groups of IPP are sensitive to terminal phosphatases such as alkaline phosphatase (23, 26) or apyrase. The novel mycobacterial antigenic activity present in mGLP-enriched fractions could not be abrogated by treatment with alkaline phosphatase (Fig. 7A). These results suggested that the \u03b3\u03b4 T cell-stimulating bioactivity present in the novel mGLP-enriched mycobacterial fractions is not due to phosphoantigens. 31P NMR chemical shifts detected by analysis of the 100% MeOH fraction, as well as commercially available and highly pure HMBPP, are shown in Fig. 7B. The 100% methanol fraction did not show spectral peaks consistent with the HMBPP spectra, further supporting our conclusion that the biologically potent molecules in our novel, mGLP-enriched MtbWL capable of expanding protective \u03b39\u03b42 T cell inducing antigen are not IPP or HMBPP. Finally, an SRM MS assay was developed for sensitive and targeted detection of HMBPP. This assay can detect levels of HMBPP in the picomolar concentration range known to activate \u03b39\u03b42 T cells. Our application of improved chromatography and use of our identical final preparation of mGLP in this assay greatly improved the sensitivity of detection (to 19 pM HMBPP; with reliable quantification of 38 pM HMBPP; see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). With this improved sensitivity, we can confidently conclude that our mGLP preparations were contaminated with <2 pM concentrations of HMBPP, at least 25-fold less than required for efficient \u03b3\u03b4 T cell stimulatory activity. HMBPP was not detected in the 100% methanol fraction using this targeted assay, confirming that our fractions were not enriched for this phosphoantigen (Fig. 7C).",

Therefore, these cells may serve as potent targets for TB immunotherapy. Clinical trials using various \u03b39\u03b42 T cell activating agents, such as aminobisphosphonates and phosphoantigens, are ongoing for treatment of cancer (55\u201358). Such trials report low toxicity and improved objective clinical outcomes, including stabilization and partial or full remission of advanced-stage metastatic carcinomas of the prostate (59), lung (60), and kidney (61). Therapeutic activation of \u03b39\u03b42 T cells may also prove to be beneficial in numerous other disease settings, due to their potent adjuvant and effector functions in innate and adaptive immunity (32, 58, 62\u201365). Data from a recent proof-of-concept study indicate that expansion of \u03b39\u03b42 T cells in vivo during pulmonary M. tuberculosis infection can limit M. tuberculosis replication and dissemination and attenuate TB lesions in nonhuman primates (3).",

In contrast, TCR spectratypic and sequence analyses of \u03b39\u03b42 T cell lines expanded by multiple rounds of stimulation with dendritic cells either infected with live BCG or pulsed with IPP demonstrated that the TCR CDR3 sequences of \u03b39\u03b42 T cells expanded by BCG and IPP were markedly different. BCG-expanded \u03b39\u03b42 T cell subsets were significantly less polyclonal than IPP-expanded cells. In addition, the BCG-expanded \u03b39\u03b42 T cells were universally responsive to IPP, but only a small fraction of the total IPP-expanded \u03b39\u03b42 T cells were responsive to BCG. Similar results were seen with T cell lines generated from 5 PPD+ individuals and with hundreds of T cell clones expanded from a single individual. Furthermore, the more recently identified HMBPP phosphoantigen, a more potent phosphoantigen for \u03b39\u03b42 T cells expressed in M. tuberculosis- and BCG-infected macrophages, also did not induce \u03b39\u03b42 T cells with pathogen-inhibitory activity. Overall, these results clearly demonstrated that BCG-expanded \u03b39\u03b42 T cells represent a subset of IPP-responsive \u03b39\u03b42 T cells and strongly suggest that BCG-expanded \u03b39\u03b42 T cells express a restricted TCR diversity capable of recognizing unique M. tuberculosis antigens expressed by infected host cells distinct from the previously identified phosphoantigens. Based on this understanding, one of our goals has been to identify the unknown M. tuberculosis antigens capable of stimulating \u03b39\u03b42 T cells with optimal TB protective capacity.",

As an initial step, we proved that MtbWL retain the capacity to stimulate \u03b39\u03b42 T cells with mycobacterium-inhibitory activity. We observed that mild acid hydrolysis of mycobacterial lysates removed the inhibitory \u03b39\u03b42 T cell-stimulatory activity. Enriched polar lipid extracts obtained with chloroform-methanol-water (10:10:3) were further separated on a silica column, and products were eluted with an increasing gradient of methanol. Products eluted with 100% methanol were found to possess the highest specific activity when tested in \u03b3\u03b4 T cell expansion and M. tuberculosis growth inhibition assays. This novel fraction was then analyzed by TLC using \u03b1-naphthol, ninhydrin, and Dittmer-Lester staining and was further analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, GC-MS, and NMR. The consensus analyses identified products rich in O-methylglucose and other hexoses, devoid of peptides, with either low or no phosphate or phenyl residues, including undetectable levels of HMBPP. HMBPP conjugation to our product is still possible despite the MS evidence to the contrary, especially if such conjugates were minor products and their detection was suppressed due to poor ionization. MALDI-TOF MS analysis revealed a series of high-molecular-mass products (\u223c2,100 to 3,900 amu), with profiles similar to that reported for the spectra of methylglucose lipopolysaccharide. From these analyses, we hypothesized that 6-O-methylglucose lipopolysaccharide (mGLP), or a derivative or similar product thereof, is responsible for expansion of \u03b39\u03b42 T cells with mycobacterium-inhibitory activity.",

The major subset of human peripheral blood \u03b3\u03b4 cells express \u03b39\u03b42 TCR heterodimers stimulated by phosphorylated metabolites (commonly called phosphoantigens). Our TCR blocking studies indicate that signaling through the V\u03b39V\u03b42 TCR is required for activation of \u03b39\u03b42 T cells by our novel mGLP-enriched M. tuberculosis stimulatory molecules. In addition, recent studies have identified butyrophilin (BTN3A1) as a key molecule involved in either presenting or sensing phosphoantigens, necessary for stimulation of \u03b39\u03b42 T cells. Butyrophilin-3A (BTN3A/CD277) is present in humans in three isoforms (BTN3A1, BTN3A2, and BTN3A3) (68, 69). Recent studies have shown that antibodies specific for BTN3A1 could either mimic phosphoantigen-mediated activation of the TCR (antibody 20.1) or abrogate this stimulatory effect (antibody 103.2) (70). Biophysical analysis of the underlying interactions suggested that the 20.1 antibody induced or stabilized a TCR-activating conformation of BTN3A1 (71). Additionally, phosphoantigens and 20.1 antibodies activated the same intracellular signaling pathways in the responding \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, suggesting a common recognition process (72). Sandstrom et al. demonstrated that BTN3A1 acts as an intracellular sensor of phosphoantigens binding phosphoantigen to a surface pocket located in the intracellular domain termed B30.2 domain. This result was confirmed by structural analysis of B30.2-phosphoantigen crystallized complexes and by mutational analysis (73). In the present work, we have provided evidence that our novel mGLP-enriched M. tuberculosis lipid components also require BTN3A1 recognition for activation of \u03b39\u03b42 T cells. It will be crucial in future studies to elucidate the detailed mechanisms involved in mGLP-mediated activation of protective \u03b39\u03b42 T cells and how precisely BTN3A1 is involved (in either presenting or sensing mGLP stimulatory molecules).",

Note the absence of HMBPP (to a limit of detection of 19 pM), which resolves between the retention time of 8.55 and 8.95 min, in mGLP, even when 2.63 \u03bcg of sample (green line) is injected onto the MS instrument. Minor peaks represent other mGLP products, resolving separately from HMBPP, during chromatography of mGLP. The x axis represents retention time (minutes); the y axis is normalized to percent relative abundance of signal in each sample based on the total peak area for 76 pM HMBPP.",
