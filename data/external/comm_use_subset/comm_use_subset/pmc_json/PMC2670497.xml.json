The ability to generate nanoscale materials that can specifically target and image sites of disease is an important goal in biomedicine. A variety of nanoparticle strategies have been developed for targeting and imaging in vivo including antibodies [8], dendrimers [9], liposomes [10], nanoshells [11], quantum dots [12], and viruses [13],[14]. Viruses are particularly suited for these applications because they are naturally designed for efficient circulation and specific ligand-binding and cellular internalization. Recently interest has turned toward self-assembling plant viruses, bacteriophages [4], and protein cage [15] architectures that can be adapted for in vivo targeting purposes without the pathogenic properties of animal viruses. However these viruses must generally be tailored to recognize their targets using specific ligands.",

Recent studies have also shown that CPMV can be chemically modified with specific ligands to achieve tumor-specific targeting [14]. Although the host range for CPMV replication is restricted to plants, interestingly the unmodified CPMV capsid also naturally interacts with mammalian cells. Intravital imaging studies using fluorescently-labeled CPMV particles yielded high-resolution images of normal and tumor vasculature in vivo\n[13]. These imaging studies showed that CPMV particles were readily internalized in mouse and chick endothelial cells following intravenous administration in living embryos, and this internalization produced high-resolution images of vasculature in real-time using epifluorescence microscopy [13]. Tumor neovasculature in particular was labeled very strongly by CPMV, and differential internalization by arterial and venous vessels was also observed, however the mechanism of uptake was unknown [13].",

Since the interaction between CPMV and the 54 kD protein correlated with such high-resolution intravital vascular images, we reasoned that identifying the 54 kD CPMV attachment protein would potentially reveal a useful endothelial marker for vascular imaging. We also hypothesized that understanding the mechanism of CPMV attachment to mammalian cells would provide important information regarding the relationships between plant and animal picornaviruses. Thus the aim of this study was to identify and characterize the 54 kD CPMV binding protein (CPMV-BP) using proteomics, biochemical assays, flow cytometry, and fluorescence confocal microscopy.",

            "text": "To identify the 54 kD CPMV-BP, a proteomics study was performed using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The 54 kD protein is found in the plasma membrane-enriched fraction of cells, lacks N- and O-glycosylation, and was identified by its ability to bind directly to CPMV particles using a Virus Overlay Protein Blot Assay (VOPBA) [21]. The VOPBA technique has identified many high-affinity virus receptors including those for coronaviruses [22],[23], adenoviruses [24], and arenaviruses [25]. Mass spectrometry analysis focused first on enriched plasma membrane proteins that co-migrated with the 54 kD band on SDS-PAGE; this resulted in identification of 68 individual proteins (Table 1). Surface biotinylation of cells, followed by isolation of enriched plasma membranes and streptavidin-sepharose purification of biotinylated proteins, separation on SDS-PAGE and VOPBA, yielded a sample in the 54 kD range that was also analyzed by LC-MS/MS and yielded 7 proteins (Table 1). The third approach used the enriched plasma membrane fraction as starting material (Figure 1A) followed by sequential column chromatography (Figure 1B). Here the membrane fraction was first run over a concanavalin A-sepharose column to remove glycoproteins, and the flow-through fraction was bound to an affinity matrix that was generated when surface lysine residues on purified CPMV particles were directly conjugated to N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester-sepharose (CPMV-sepharose). The CPMV-bound sample was washed several times, and then CPMV-sepharose beads were pelleted by centrifugation and bound proteins separated on SDS-PAGE (Figure 1C). Three bands were easily visible by SimplyBlue (Invitrogen) staining, corresponding to the 54 kD CPMV-BP, the 42 kD large capsid subunit of CPMV, and the 24 kD small CPMV capsid subunit. The 54 kD band was excised from the gel, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by LC-MS/MS using nano-electrospray on a linear ion trap mass spectrometer (Figure 1D). In this analysis two proteins were positively identified: vimentin and keratin. Keratin is a common laboratory contaminant that is isobaric with vimentin. Vimentin was also identified in all the preceding mass spectrometry analyses (Table 1). A complete listing of all proteins identified in each screen can be seen in Table S1.",

Expressed in cells of mesenchymal origin, vimentin plays a key role in intracellular dynamics and architecture [26]. Vimentin encodes head, rod, and tail domains, and these domains are identified based on sequence and function [26]. Although it has long been considered a cytosolic protein, surface-expressed forms of vimentin have recently been discovered on several cell types including apoptotic neutrophils and T cells [27],[28], activated macrophages [29], platelets [30], vascular endothelial cells [31], brain microvascular endothelial cells [32], Sezary T cells [33], and skeletal muscle cells [32]. The mechanism by which vimentin reaches the cell surface, which domains are exposed, and its function at the surface, remain unknown.",

All cells contained the 54 kD band when probed with CPMV particles by VOPBA (Figure 2A). Significant signal could be observed even when incubating the virus with membrane for as little as 5 minutes. Mouse embryo fibroblasts derived from knockout mice lacking the vimentin gene (vim\u2212/\u2212, MFT-16; lane 5) [34],[35] were negative for the 54 kD CPMV-interacting band, while membranes isolated from control vim+/+ fibroblasts (MFT-6; lane 4) contained the 54 kD protein and bound CPMV by VOPBA. CPMV also bound to purified recombinant vimentin protein (lane 7), which migrated at the expected molecular weight. Expression of vimentin in the cell lines as detected by western blot using anti-vimentin antibodies (Figure 2B) correlated directly with binding of CPMV in VOPBA. CPMV capsid proteins were also included on the gels (Figure 2A, lane 6) as a positive control in the VOPBA for detection by CPMV-specific polyclonal antibodies. As expected CPMV capsid proteins did not react with anti-vimentin antibodies in the western (Figure 2B, lane 6; in addition, a loading control for the VOPBA and western blot samples is provided in Figure S1). Together these results demonstrate that vimentin is present in the enriched plasma membrane fraction of human cells and binds directly to CPMV.",

Although MFT-16 vim\u2212/\u2212 cells had low transfection efficiencies (ranging from 0.1 to 8.0% of cells using a GFP-reporter plasmid, not shown), in the cell population that was transfected with vimentin, a statistically significant (p = 0.036) increase in CPMV binding or uptake was observed when compared to mock-transfected MFT-16 cells.

The surface vimentin expression pattern observed in HeLa cells is virtually identical to confocal observation of surface vimentin expression previously reported in macrophages [29]. Fixation and staining procedures to verify cell surface and cytosolic staining were verified through the ability to detect \u03b2-COP, an intra-Golgi transport marker (Figure S3). Approximately 50% of HeLa cells exhibited surface vimentin expression by confocal microscopy, and surface vimentin expression was also quantified by flow cytometry when HeLa cells were stained using an anti-vimentin antibody (Figure S4). These data correlated with CPMV binding or uptake by flow cytometry (Figure 4E). CPMV-positive cells were observed within the surface-vimentin-expressing population in FACS (41.3% of the total population), although not all of these cells interacted with significant quantities of CPMV.

In order to focus on surface vimentin displayed on the lumenal surface of vascular endothelium rather than cytosolic vimentin, cylinder-shaped rat aorta segments were excised, and prior to sectioning were incubated with CPMV-A555 or V9 mAb, washed, and then embedded in OCT medium and 10 \u00b5m cryosections prepared. The sections were then stained with a secondary anti-mouse antibody. The expression of vimentin was observed on the lumenal surface of aortic endothelium, and co-localized with CPMV binding (Figure 4F\u2013J, and Figure S7). The colocalization of CPMV and vimentin in vessels correlated with the observed vascular endothelial uptake of CPMV in vivo (Figure S6 and [13]). Specificity of the staining procedure was also confirmed (Figure S8). There was no CPMV colocalization outside of the endothelial cell marker (Figure S6), or outside the surface vimentin expressing cells (Figure 4F\u2013J). Taken together, the CPMV colocalization with vascular endothelium, the CPMV interaction with living vasculature shown previously through intravital imaging [13], and our current results indicating that surface vimentin facilitates this interaction, illustrates that endothelial cell targeting of CPMV is mediated via vimentin.",

            "text": "Together these studies identify the 54 kD protein that mediates binding of CPMV in mammalian cells as surface vimentin. These results demonstrate that CPMV is a useful nanoparticle probe for examining the expression of surface vimentin on endothelial cells and circulating cells in vivo. The ability of CPMV to efficiently visualize tumor neovasculature and differentiate arterial from venous tissues [13] may now be attributed to upregulation of surface vimentin. Upregulation of cytosolic vimentin has long been associated with tumor progression and metastasis during the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [39], however our findings suggest that increased surface vimentin is also a key feature of tumor endothelium as evident by ability of CPMV to preferentially image these areas [13] and may signal a role for surface vimentin in tumor metastasis or invasion, in addition to cellular adhesion and stress. The use of CPMV as a natural endothelial probe may also extend into the investigation of other vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis. Finally, the CPMV-vimentin interaction may provide a tool for understanding the display and internalization of surface-expressed vimentin, the mechanism and function of which is currently unknown.",

CPMV is not known to be dependent on cellular receptors for cell-cell spread; rather like many plant viruses CPMV encodes a movement protein (MP) that mediates movement of virus particles within leaf tissue via the plasmodesmata [40],[41]. The mechanism of CPMV loading and unloading from the plant host's vascular elements is not understood [42]. Access to plant vascular tissues may be mediated by direct virus capsid-cellular interactions independent of MP, and intermediate filament-like proteins may play a role in the vascular tropism of CPMV in plants.",

Coupled with our findings, this further strengthens the link between animal and plant picornaviruses not only structurally and genetically, but with regard to attachment mechanisms as well. The original characterization of CPMV bioavailability was performed following oral administration of virus or infected leaves, whereby virus was subsequently found in the blood circulation [16]. The stability of CPMV in the gastrointestinal tract and its subsequent systemic biodistribution provides an opportunity for interactions between CPMV and mammalian cells following ingestion [16]. While there is no evidence for CPMV replication in mammalian or avian cells, the conserved interaction with vimentin, coupled with the conserved capsid structures of the plant, insect and animal picornaviruses, supports the hypothesis that the picornavirus superfamily of viruses evolved from a common ancestor. The identification of conserved mechanisms of attachment and entry also point to a possible mode of cross-kingdom transmission.",

The liquid chromatography separation was performed on a laser pulled 100 \u00b5m ID C18 column with a tip of <5 \u00b5m that is also used as a nanoelectrospray emitter. An Agilent 1100 HPLC system equipped with a nanopump was used to perform the gradient elution at a flow rate of 300 nL/min with 0.1% formic acid/acetonitrile as the mobile phases, from 5% to 35% acetonitrile in 100 minutes, then up to 90% acetonitrile for 15 minutes. The MS/MS analysis was performed on a LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron Corp.), as well as an Agilent LC/MSD Trap ion trap mass spectrometer. Data-dependent scanning was used to maximize the number of peptides sequenced in the highly complex mixture. This mode of operation uses preset criteria to select unique peptides on-the-fly for undergoing MS/MS. Over 10,000 MS/MS spectra were obtained during the runs. These were searched using MASCOT (Matrix Science, Limited) with the Sprot protein database. To improve searching efficiency, taxonomic category was limited to rodent proteins. Only peptides producing good quality fragmentation spectra and scoring higher than the threshold required for 95% confidence level for Mascot were used for protein identification. A protein identification was only validated if two or more peptides were identified with ion scores needed for 95% confidence level.",
