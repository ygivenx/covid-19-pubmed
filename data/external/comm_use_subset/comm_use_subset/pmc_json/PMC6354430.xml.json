            "text": "West Nile virus (WNV) is an emerging human pathogen that causes seasonal outbreaks through the Western hemisphere since its introduction in 1999 [1]. A member of the Flavivirus genus, WNV is an enveloped, single-stranded positive sense RNA virus that cycles between birds and mosquitos. Symptoms of WNV infection can range from a relatively mild flu-like illness, West Nile fever, to severe neuroinvasive disease. After peripheral infection, WNV replicates within lymphoid tissues before entering the CNS, where it targets neurons in the cerebellum, brainstem, and cerebral cortex [2, 3]. In 2017, 2002 symptomatic WNV cases were reported to the CDC, and of those, 1339 (67%) were classified as neuroinvasive [4]. Prolonged neurological deficits, which include motor functions, verbal learning and memory, and executive functions, are a significant problem for survivors of WNV infection and appear to manifest even in cases where neuroinvasion is absent [5\u20137]. Recent work indicates that persistent phagocytic microglia contribute to prolonged cognitive dysfunction following WNV encephalitis [8], and thus, limiting microglial activation may alleviate the associated neurological sequelae.",

            "text": "Microglia are the resident immune cells in the CNS, originating from yolk sac progenitor cells that seed the brain early in development [9]. In addition to a multitude of homeostatic functions throughout development and healthy aging [10, 11], microglia participate in both innate and adaptive immune responses through recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns [12], which stimulate morphological changes [13, 14] and increase production of reactive oxidative species [15, 16] and cytokines/chemokines [17, 18]. During neurotropic virus infection, virally infected cells secrete chemokines including CCL2, CCL5, and CXCL10, which facilitate immune cells crossing the blood brain barrier (BBB) [19\u201321]. Mononuclear cell infiltration into the CNS is a hallmark of WNV encephalitis, and monocytes and T cells are critical for CNS virologic control. Elimination of monocytes using a liposome-encapsulated drug dichloromethylene diphosphonate or by genetic deletion of CCR2 increases mortality in mice infected with a neurotropic strain of WNV [22, 23]. However, monocytes may also contribute to dissemination of virus to the CNS [24, 25], and inhibition of monocyte infiltration may also protect against nitric oxide-mediated immunopathology [26]. CD4+ T cells produce antiviral molecules, such as interferon \u03b3 (IFN\u03b3) and IL-2, which promotes antiviral humoral immunity and sustains WNV-specific CD8+ T cell responses, enabling viral clearance in all organs [27, 28]. CD8+ T cells contribute to viral clearance and recovery from WNV infection via both cytopathic and noncytopathic mechanisms [29\u201332]. Mice lacking either CD8+ T cells or MHC-I molecules have higher CNS viral burdens, increased mortality after infection, and prolonged viral persistence, suggesting that cell-mediated immunity controls virus within the CNS [32].",

            "text": "CSF1 receptor (CSF1R) signaling is essential for the development of many mononuclear phagocytes including microglia. Tissue-resident macrophages, such as microglia, fail to develop in Csf1r\u2212/\u2212 mice [9], but in contrast to many tissue macrophages, adult microglia can still form in Csf1op/op mice, which carry a natural null mutation in the Csf1 gene [33]. This is due to an alternative CSF1R ligand, IL-34, which is highly expressed by neurons [34, 35]. Similar to Csf1op/op mice, IL-34\u2212/\u2212 mice develop fewer microglia but do not lack peripheral macrophages [36]. These mice are more susceptible to lethal neurotropic WNV infection, which is associated with increased neuronal apoptosis without increased viral replication [36]. In order to temporally control microglial depletion, pharmacologic agents that antagonize CSF1R have been developed, including antagonist PLX5622, which depletes microglia in as little as 3 days and may be sustained for at least 6 weeks [37]. These agents are being investigated as therapeutics in models of neurodegenerative diseases in which microglial activation is considered a contributing factor, such as traumatic brain injury [38, 39], experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis [40], and Alzheimer\u2019s disease [41]. Here, we used PLX5622 in a model of WNV encephalitis to examine the effect of CSF1R antagonism in the setting of neurotropic viral infection. Our results show that mice treated with PLX5622 are more susceptible to lethal WNV infection, which is associated with increased CNS viral burden and neuronal apoptosis. PLX5622 also reduced expression of proinflammatory cytokines and B7 co-stimulatory molecules within the infected CNS by depleting cellular sources, including resident microglia and infiltrating macrophages, as well as decreasing expression on peripheral antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The loss of APCs in the CNS resulted in limited local reactivation of recruited antiviral CD8+ T cells, which are required for virologic control in the CNS. Together, these data demonstrate the impact of CSF1R antagonism on APC activation during viral infection in both the CNS and periphery and highlight the importance of microglia in orchestrating cell-mediated antiviral immunity during neurotropic infection.",

To examine the impact of CSF1R antagonism on both peripheral and CNS mononuclear cells, we used PLX5622, which reportedly depletes microglia in as little as 3 days and may be sustained for at least 6 weeks [37, 41]. Mice were provided either control chow or PLX5622-embedded chow for 2 weeks, after which microglia numbers were assessed by flow cytometry using the microglia-specific marker P2RY12 (Additional file 1) and by immunohistochemistry using Iba1 (Additional file 2). Quantification shows that 2 weeks of PLX5622 treatment reduced microglia in the CNS by 90\u201395% (Additional file 1 A\u2013F, P, Q). Specificity of P2RY12 for CNS-resident microglia is demonstrated by lack of staining in leukocytes isolated from peripheral immune compartments (Additional file 1 G\u2013O). Within the CNS, PLX5622 treatment significantly depleted microglia across hippocampal, cortical, and cerebellar brain regions (Additional file 2). To determine whether PLX5622 treatment depleted mononuclear cells in peripheral immune compartments, we assessed numbers of antigen-presenting cells (APCs, Fig. 1) and T cells (Additional file 3) in the spleen and blood of uninfected mice in control versus PLX5622-treated mice. PLX5622 treatment significantly reduced circulating CD11c+ (Fig. 1a\u2013c), MHCII+CD11c+ (Fig. 1d\u2013f), and CD11bnegCD11c+ (Fig. 1g\u2013i) cells in the blood. In the spleen, however, there was no significant difference in populations of APCs with PLX5622 treatment (Fig. 1j\u2013r). In addition, no significant difference in populations of T cells was detected in uninfected mice in either compartment (Additional file 3). Because of the sensitivity of microglia and APCs to CSF1R antagonism, we assessed whether CSF1R antagonism depleted CD11b+, Ly6C+, and Ly6G+ cells in the blood, spleen, and bone marrow of PLX5622-treated versus control-treated uninfected mice. Flow cytometry analysis revealed no significant differences in populations of these cells in uninfected mice (Additional file 4). Together, these data indicate that circulating APCs, but not bone marrow or splenic mononuclear cells, are decreased in the context of CSF1R antagonism.",

Consistent with published data [8, 49], 30% of control-treated mice survived infection with 104 PFU and 90% of control-treated mice survived infection with 102 PFU; however, mice treated with PLX5622 universally succumbed to infection with either inoculum titer (Fig. 2a). This was associated with significantly increased weight loss (Fig. 2b) and more severe clinical score (Fig. 2c, d) in PLX5622-treated compared with control-treated mice infected with 102 PFU WNV-NY. To determine whether increased mortality caused by PLX5622 treatment is associated with increased viral replication in peripheral or CNS tissues, tissue viral loads were assessed by plaque assay, and serum viral loads were determined by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) at 2, 4, 6, and 8 days post-infection (dpi). In the CNS, virus was first detected in the olfactory bulb (Fig. 2e), then sequentially in more caudal regions including the cortex (Fig. 2f), cerebellum (Fig. 2g), brainstem (Fig. 2h), and spinal cord (Fig. 2i). Compared with control-treated animals, PLX5622-treated mice exhibited higher viral titers in the olfactory bulb and cortex at 6 and 8 dpi and in the cerebellum, brainstem, and spinal cord at 8 dpi; however, viral titers were also significantly higher in peripheral tissues of PLX5622-treated mice including the spleen at 4 dpi (Fig. 2j), kidney at 4 and 6 dpi (Fig. 2k), and serum at 2, 4, 6, and 8 dpi (Fig. 2l). PLX5622 treatment did not cause increased BBB permeability in infected mice (Additional file 5). Once WNV-NY enters the CNS via intracranial (i.c.) inoculation, PLX5622 treatment did not affect neuronal permissivity to infection (Additional file 6). Together, these data indicate a loss of immune-mediated virologic control in both peripheral and CNS tissues in CSF1R antagonist-treated mice, consistent with prior data suggesting that CSF1R signaling plays important roles in the function of both peripheral and CNS myeloid cells [50\u201352].",

The NS5-E218A point mutation abolishes 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase activity, which functions to methylate the 5\u2032 cap of viral RNA and facilitate escape of IFN-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT)-mediated suppression; thus, this attenuation limits viral replication by increasing sensitivity of the virus to type I IFN-mediated innate immune mechanisms [45, 49]. Despite this attenuation, mice treated with PLX5622 were significantly more susceptible to lethal WNV-NS5-E218A infection than those receiving control chow (Fig. 3a). Weight loss was also significantly increased in PLX5622-treated mice (Fig. 3b). Consistent with this, viral titers measured by plaque assay at 2, 4, 6, and 8 dpi in the olfactory bulb (Fig. 3d), cortex (Fig. 3e), cerebellum (Fig. 3f), brainstem (Fig. 3g), and spinal cord (Fig. 3h) were significantly higher in PLX5622-treated compared in control-treated mice infected with WNV-NS5-E218A. As virus was inoculated into the cortex, it was detected there at 2 dpi, followed by spread to the olfactory bulb by 4 dpi, and cerebellum, brainstem, and spinal cord by 6 dpi. PLX5622 treatment also led to decreased proinflammatory cytokine expression in the cortex at 8 dpi (Fig. 3c) and increased neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus and cerebellum at 6 dpi (Fig. 3l\u2013p) after i.c. infection with WNV-NS5-E218A.",

After f.p. infection, WNV-infected cells traffic to draining popliteal lymph nodes (pLN) and stimulate an antiviral immune response [53]. At 4 dpi, a time-point of high serum viral loads (Fig. 2l), flow cytometric assessment revealed a trend towards decreased CD11c+CD45+ cells in the blood (Fig. 4a\u2013d) and significantly reduced percentages and total numbers of CD11c+CD45+ cells in the pLN of PLX5622-treated compared with control-treated mice (Fig. 4k\u2013n). There was no difference in numbers or percentages of MHCII+CD11c+CD45+ cells in either blood or pLN (Fig. 4e\u2013g, o\u2013q); however, the percentages of CD11c+CD45+ cells in the blood positive for co-stimulatory molecule CD80+ was significantly decreased in PLX5622- versus control-treated mice (Fig. 4h\u2013j). In the pLN, the numbers and percentages of CD11c+CD45+ cells positive for co-stimulatory molecule CD86 were significantly reduced in PLX5622-treated mice compared with control mice (Fig. 4r\u2013t). The impact of CSF1R antagonism on CD80 and CD86 expression appears to be tissue-dependent as the blood showed no difference in APCs expressing CD86 and the pLN showed no difference in APCs expressing CD80 (Additional file 7). Together, these data indicate that CSF1R antagonism decreases the expression of co-stimulatory B7 molecules on peripheral APC populations.",

To determine the impact of CSF1R antagonism on recruitment of these cells to the CNS, leukocytes isolated from the cortices of WNV-NS5-E218A-infected mice were assessed by flow cytometry at 8 dpi. As expected, CD45loCD11b+ (P1) population, which is primarily microglia [58], remained significantly depleted in the PLX5622-treated compared with control-treated mice (Fig. 6a\u2013c). The population of CD45hiCD11b+ (P2), which is primarily infiltrating monocytes/macrophages [58], were non-significantly reduced in the PLX5622-treated compared with control-treated mice. However, the number of CD45hiCD11bneg (P3) lymphocyte population [58] were non-significantly elevated in PLX5622-treated compared with control mice, though the percentage of this population was significantly elevated (Fig. 6a\u2013c). This increase was largely due to elevated numbers of CD8+ T cell infiltration in PLX5622-treated mice (Fig. 6d\u2013f). Though there was no significant difference in the percentage of CD8+ T cells specific for the WNV immunodominant peptide between PLX5622 and control-treated mice, there were significantly more WNV-specific CD8+ T cells isolated from PLX5622 compared with control-treated cortex (Fig. 6g\u2013i). Despite the increased infiltration of WNV-specific CD8+ T cells in PLX5622-treated mice, the percentages of cells expressing early activation marker CD69 and their level of expression were significantly reduced in PLX5622-treated compared with control-treated mice (Fig. 6j\u2013m). Additionally, the percentage of WNV-specific CD8+ T cells positive for CD160 as well as the level of CD160 expression, which is specifically expressed on highly activated CD8+ T cells [59], were reduced in PLX5622-treated compared with control-treated mice. However, the numbers of NS4B+CD8+ cells positive for either CD69 or CD160 were non-significantly elevated in PLX5622-treated compared with control-treated cortices (Fig. 6l, p) due to the increased numbers of NS4B+CD8+ cells.",

In order to distinguish resident microglia from infiltrating monocytes/macrophages, CNS myeloid cells were examined for expression of the microglia-specific marker P2RY12 (Fig. 7a). Infiltrating monocytes/macrophages were then identified via gating of P2RY12negCD11b+ cells (Fig. 7b). Populations of both CNS-derived P2RY12+CD45+ microglia (P1, Fig. 7a) and CD11b+P2RY12negCD45+ monocytes/macrophages (P2, Fig. 7b) were reduced in PLX5622-treated compared with control-treated mice (Fig. 7i, j). While no differences in the overall number of cells expressing MHCII were observed in P2RY12+CD45+, a significant reduction of MHCII+CD11b+P2RY12negCD45+ was seen (Fig. 7c, d, l). This corresponded with a relative increase in the percentage of MHCII+ cells in both P2RY12+CD45+ and CD11b+P2RY12negCD45+ populations due to the decreased numbers of total P2RY12+CD45+ and CD11b+P2RY12negCD45+ cells in the cortices of PLX5622-treated mice compared with control-treated mice (Fig. 7k). However, the numbers of P2RY12+CD45+ cells expressing B7 co-stimulatory signals CD80 and CD86 were significantly reduced in the CNS of PLX5622-treated mice compared with control-treated animals (Fig. 7e\u2013h, m\u2013p). The percentage of remaining P2RY12+CD45+ cells expressing CD80 or CD86 were not reduced (Fig. 7m, o); however, the percentage of remaining CD11b+P2RY12negCD45+ cells expressing CD86 was significantly reduced (Fig. 7o), similar to results seen in peripheral APCs (Figs. 4, 5) Together, these data suggest that resident microglia and infiltrating macrophages are important sources of CD80 and CD86 in the CNS, and PLX5622 treatment depletes these cellular sources of co-stimulatory molecules.",

            "text": "Recent studies have reported increased viral titers in the CNS of mice treated with CSF1R antagonists [36, 60, 61]; however, the mechanisms underlying this loss of virologic control and the effects on peripheral immune responses have not been well characterized. We sought to determine the role of CSF1R signaling in viral clearance of both systemic and neurotropic infection. Our results indicate that antagonism of CSF1R signaling limits virologic control within the CNS via reduction of critical APCs that express co-stimulatory B7 molecules, CD80 and CD86, necessary for local reactivation of antiviral CD8+ T cells. Our data also indicate that CSF1R antagonism reduces expression of co-stimulatory B7 molecules on peripheral APCs, contributing to loss of virologic control in the periphery and dissemination of virus to the CNS. As previously reported, WNV-NY inoculated into mice via f.p. is detected first within the olfactory bulb then spreads caudally through the cerebral cortex to the brain stem with significant virus not detected in the cerebellum until 8 dpi [20]. CSF1R antagonism with PLX5622 leads to increased viral replication within each of these CNS regions and also in the peripheral organs: the spleen, kidney, and serum. In contrast to CNS titers, the virus is cleared from the spleen and serum by 8 dpi in WNV-infected, control, and PLX5622-treated mice. Notably, we detected expansion of viral tropism with significant viral replication in the kidney of PLX5622-treated mice at 4 and 6 dpi compared with control-treated animals. These data suggest that renal macrophages may be sensitive to CSF1R antagonism, which is consistent with a study utilizing a model of recovery from acute kidney injury in which CSF1R inhibition with GW2580 reportedly decreased both kidney macrophage proliferation and their polarization towards wound-healing phenotypes [62]. In order to better isolate the role of microglia during neurotropic infection, we examined the effect of PLX5622 in an established murine model of CNS infection using an attenuated strain of WNV (WNV-NS5-E218A), which lacks 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase activity, thus increasing sensitivity to IFIT-mediated suppression and limiting virulence in peripheral organs with intact immunity [8, 45, 49]. Mice infected i.c. with WNV-NS5-E218A exhibited increased viral titers in the CNS and increased lethality with PLX5622 treatment compared with control treatment. These data suggest that loss of CNS immunity increases lethality of WNV infection.",

Under homeostatic conditions, microglia express very low levels of co-stimulatory B7 molecules (CD80/CD86); however, microglia upregulate expression of these molecules in response to inflammatory cytokines [54, 64]. Our results show PLX5622 treatment decreased expression of these molecules by depleting their cellular sources in the CNS, which include both resident microglia and infiltrating monocytes/macrophages. In the periphery, PLX5622 also reduced cellular expression of B7 molecules on splenic, blood, and pLN APCs. Under certain conditions, other co-stimulatory molecules are able to compensate for the loss of B7 signals in T cell reactivation. For example, expansion of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus-specific antiviral T cells can be driven by either alternative co-stimulatory TNFR superfamily members or by enhanced expression of antiviral cytokines, such as high levels of type I IFNs [65]. However, during WNV encephalitis, PLX5622 treatment also significantly decreased transcriptional expression of both TNF and IFN\u03b2. Together, our results indicate that CSF1R antagonism contributes impaired local reactivation of antiviral T cells within the CNS by depleting co-stimulatory signals including both B7 molecules and inflammatory cytokines.",

            "text": "In addition to augmenting antiviral T cell activation, many cytokines have essential protective roles during WNV infection. Infected human monocyte-derived macrophages release IL-8, IFN\u03b1, IFN\u03b2, and TNF [66, 67]. Microglia become activated in response to neurotropic WNV infection and upregulate expression of CXCL10, CXCL1, CCL5, CCL3, CCL2, TNF, and IL-6 [18]. Neurons and astrocytes in WNV-infected brains also release proinflammatory mediators including CCL2, CCL5, CXCL10, IL1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF, which promote lymphocyte trafficking to the CNS [19\u201321]. In fact, results from a recent study demonstrated that peripheral infection with WNV increased CNS expression of chemokines important for lymphocyte trafficking, including CCL2, CCL7, CXCL9, and CXCL10, in PLX5622-treated mice compared with control-treated mice [61]. Type I IFN response is widely accepted as the most immediate antiviral host response, essential for controlling viral replication during the initial infection. Mice lacking type I IFN signaling are highly vulnerable to uncontrolled WNV replication, exhibiting 100% mortality [68]. Clearance of viral infections, however, requires additional immune response including type II IFN, i.e., IFN\u03b3, which is produced by activated CD8+ T cells. Mice deficient in IFN\u03b3 show higher peripheral viral load, increased CNS infection, and increased lethality [69]. Data described here show significantly decreased cytokine expression in PLX5622-treated mice, which may also contribute to the loss of virologic control via the above-described mechanisms.",

            "text": "The exact role of microglia during viral infection has been difficult to define because infiltrating monocytes can mask the impact of resident microglia. In a previous report, IL34\u2212/\u2212 mice, which have significantly reduced development of microglia, are more susceptible to lethal infection after WNV-NS5-E218A i.c. inoculation [36]. Similar to results reported here, IL34\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited increased neuronal death compared with wildtype controls. In contrast with PLX5622-treated mice, IL34\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited similar levels of viral burden compared with wildtype controls in the brain at 3 and 6 dpi. Numbers of infiltrating monocytes/macrophages and WNV-specific T cells were also similar between IL34\u2212/\u2212 and wildtype controls; however, the authors did not investigate antiviral T cell activation in this model [36]. In another model of flavivirus encephalitis, in which suckling mice were infected with dengue virus, depletion of microglia with liposome-encapsulated clodronate resulted in increased viral replication and reduced infiltration of IFN\u03b3+CD8+ T cells [70]. Here, we report no reduction in CD8+ T cell infiltration; however, this difference may be due to the age of mice, virus, and/or method of microglial depletion. Another recent study reported use of PLX5622 in a model of neuroattenuated murine corona virus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Similar to our results, PLX5622 treatment resulted in increased viral replication and lethality. In contrast to our results, PLX5622 treatment reduced expression of MHCII on microglia and macrophages and reduced CD4+ T cell response [60]. While CD4+ T cells can improve CD8+ T cell response, the dependence of CD8+ T cells on CD4+ T cells varies by virus, antigen exposure, tissue environment, and effector sites [71]. In models of MHV encephalitis, control of viral replication requires a collaborative effort between CD4+ and CD8+ T cells [71]. However, when virus replication induces activation of APCs, activation of CD8+ T cells is relatively CD4+ T cell-independent [71].",

Genetic studies have confirmed the relevance of inflammatory response in common neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease and multiple sclerosis, indicating that neuroinflammation is likely implicated in the primary pathogenesis, rather than a secondary response [73]. We and others have reported that microglia impact neurocognitive function by executing complement-mediated synapse elimination [8, 74, 75]. Because of the neurological consequences of microglial activation, researchers have attempted to use CSF1R antagonism to deplete microglia in a variety of models to improve neurological function, including traumatic brain injury [38, 39], brain irradiation [50], myelin-induced catatonia [76], experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis [40], and Alzheimer\u2019s disease [41]. However, our results indicate that CSF1R antagonism may ultimately be detrimental to brain health due to loss of innate and adaptive immune response in the CNS, as well as decreased peripheral APC activation. Thus, in assessing the benefit of CSF1R antagonism, it will be important to consider the diminished immune response in both the CNS and peripheral immune compartments.",

Mice were fed chow containing PLX5622 or control chow for 2 weeks, infected i.c. with WNV-NS5-E218A at 104 PFU, then monitored for a mortality and b weight loss for up to 25 dpi. a Survival curves show a significant increase in mortality in mice treated with PLX5622 compared with control as calculated by log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. b Weight was measured daily during acute illness as a measure of illness. After death, the last measured weight was carried through to the end of the experiment. Significantly greater weight loss was measured in PLX5622-treated mice compared with controls as calculated by two-way ANOVA with matched values comparing group means without multiple comparisons. For a and b, data represent the compilation of two independent experiments with 10 mice per group. c At 8 dpi, cortical brain tissue was extracted and relative transcript levels in tissue homogenates were measured by SYBR qRT-PCR for indicated cytokines. Data for individual mice were normalized to Gapdh. Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM of three to five mice from one experiment.
