            "text": "It is well documented that Watson and Crick paired DNA duplex interacts with sequence specific oligonucleotides to form triple helices stabilised by either Hoogsteen (parallel triplex) or reverse Hoogsteen (antiparallel triplex) pair of hydrogen bonds. Evidences for involvement of triple helices in biological processes come from their participation in regulation of gene expression [1, 2], DNA damage and repair [3, 4], RNA processing and folding [5, 6, 7] and chromatin organization [8]. Triplexes are also known to impair DNA polymerization and influence DNA recombination process [9]. Base triple interactions crucial for function are shown to be present in pseudoknots in telomerase RNA [10] and in transcripts during programmed ribosomal frame shifting in viruses like SARS coronavirus [11]. Most recently, intramolecularly folded RNA triplexes are shown to be formed in the highly abundant and up-regulated long noncoding transcripts such as metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) and others to evade exonuclease action [12, 13]. Formation of RNA.DNA hybrid triplexes involving noncoding RNA found to repress genes like DHFR, TGF-\u03b2 and MAT2A has further enhanced the biological importance of nucleic acid triplexes [14, 15, 16]. Existence of triplexes in vivo is supported by the discovery of triplex unwinding helicases [17, 18], triplex-specific antibodies [19, 20] and other endogenous triplex specific proteins [21\u201324]. Association of triple helices with colorectal cancer [25], neurodegenerative disorder Friedreich\u2019s ataxia [26] and a number of inherited as well as acquired human diseases [27] further underscore their profound significance.",

            "text": "DNA triplexes have evoked potential technological applications which include creating high quality DNA vectors for human gene therapy [28], nanomachines for monitoring intracellular pH gradient [29], molecular switches [30,31,32], and for developing drug delivery systems [33,34]. They have also been used as biosensors for the recognition and analysis of toxic metal ions [35], SNPs [36], DNA methylation [37] and cancer cells [38]. Quite recently, DNA triplex formation process has been exploited in developing PCR based biosensor for detection of pathogens [39], high-throughput assays for measuring activity of DNA topoisomerases and other enzymes involved in DNA topology modification [40], controlled assembly of liposomes [41] and as modular probes for DNA detection [42]. Recognition of abundant putative triplex target sites in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes [43, 44, 45], together with new experimental approaches for identification of triple helices [46\u201350] and development of algorithm/databases for analysis of triplex target sites [51, 52, 53] highlight their increasing relevance in the post genomic era. Several reviews detailing the biological significance [2, 54\u201360] and potential therapeutic applications [61] of triplexes have been appearing to underscore their importance. Notwithstanding, structural information on triple helices, specifically those addressing the issue of base triplet nonisostericity and their effects, crucial in the design of Triplex forming Oligonucleotides (TFOs) for targeting duplex is rather inadequate.",

            "text": "It is well recognised that TFOs rich in (i) T & C+, (ii) G & A, (iii) G & T can interact with purine rich strand of DNA forming a pair of hydrogen bonds to result in T*AT, C+*GC, G*GC and A*AT base triplets. Predictably, T*AT & C+*GC triplets are isosteric (structurally alike) like the Watson and Crick pairs, while the other triplet pair combinations such as T*AT & G*GC, T*AT & G*GC and A*AT & G*GC are nonisosteric (structurally dissimilar) [56, 62]. While T & C rich TFOs favour parallel triplex [63, 64], those with G & A favour antiparallel triplex [65, 66]. Although TFOs with G & T form both parallel and antiparallel triplexes, they predominantly favour the latter [67\u201370]. Interestingly, both intramolecular [67, 71] and intermolecular [62, 72\u201374] parallel triplexes containing a limited number of G*GC & T*AT triplet pairs are observed. They are shown to be effective in interfering with biological functions in several instances. For instance, GT rich 38-mer and 15-mer TFOs inhibit transcription of HIV-1 in infected human cells [75] and replication in SV40 containing plasmid in COS-1 cells [76] respectively, through formation of parallel triplexes. On the other hand, the 22-mer TFO with 10 T*AT & G*GC juxtapositions, and the 36-mer TFO with 21 T*AT & G*GC juxtapositions, targeted against the promoter region of human Ki-ras [77] and the human epidermal growth factor receptor gene [78] respectively, are unable to form parallel triplex, but forms only antiparallel triplex. Seemingly then, selective ability to form parallel triplex appears to be determined by the number of G*GC & T*AT juxtapositions, their larger incidences, thwarting parallel triplex formation. While this may be notionally attributed to nonisosteric traits between them, their quantitative estimates and precise mechanistic effects on the ability and stability for triplex formation are obscure.",

We argue that this might be responsible in imparting differential mechanistic influence in parallel vis-\u00e0-vis antiparallel triplexes causing selective preference of the former. To probe this, extensive MD simulations of a variety of parallel and anti-parallel DNA triplexes formed by these triplets, in different sequence contexts (Sequences 1\u201319 in Table 1) have been carried out. Results have yielded clear insights into the role of nonisostericity on triplex stability, stereochemical reasoning for the prevalence of antiparallel triplex and selective preference for parallel triplex. These should aid in comprehensive understanding of sequence dependent structure of nucleic acid triplexes and their implication in biological processes.",

Appearance of a twist between the adjacent Hoogsteen bases (GH & TH) or reverse Hoogsteen bases (GRH & TRH), even prior to the application of formal helical twist (t) constitutes the residual twist \u0394t\u00b0. This together with the radial difference \u0394r \u00c5 between the two superposed triplets, suffice to quantify nonisostericity between them.

This results in the largest value for the residual twist angle \u0394t\u00b0(\u00b1 21.6\u00b0) between the G\u2026G and A\u2026T Hoogsteen pairs. It is obvious that the effect of residual twist would be to impart over winding (+\u0394t\u00b0) at the GHTH step (G*GC preceding T*AT) (Fig 1C) and under winding (-\u0394t\u00b0) at the THGH step (T*AT preceding G*GC) in the Hoogsteen strand of the triplex (Fig 1D). Consequently effective triple helical twist would be 30\u00b0 (t\u00b0) + 21.6\u00b0 (+\u0394t\u00b0) = 51.6\u00b0 and 30\u00b0 (t\u00b0)\u221221.6\u00b0 (-\u0394t\u00b0) = 8.4\u00b0 at the GT and TG steps of the Hoogsteen strand respectively. 51.6\u00b0 is close to nearly twice the value of triple helical twist of 30\u00b0 (t\u00b0), while 8.4\u00b0 is an exceptionally low value for triple helical twist. Outcome of these creates disconnects of nearly one nucleotide length (5.5 \u00c5 to 6.3 \u00c5) in the sugar-phosphate backbone at the successive steps of the Hoogsteen strand (S1B Fig). They also generate severe steric overlap between the adjacent sugars, especially, at the under wound TG step. Bridging these disconnects and ensuring a steric free conformation, while retaining Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds in the G*GC & T*AT triplets, demand considerable conformational rearrangements (see below). Incidentally, the other nonisostericity parameter viz., radial difference (\u0394r \u00c5) is relatively small (\u2245 0.4 \u00c5) for the parallel (Fig 1A) compared to the antiparallel base triplets (\u2245 1.1 \u00c5) (Fig 1B). Given this, it is expected that \u0394t\u00b0 would impact more than \u0394r \u00c5 in a parallel DNA triplex.",

This can happen only at the expense of losing canonical Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding. Such a loss in a large number of triplets would critically affect triplex stability. This is clearly reflected in the very low binding free energy of only\u20149.4 kcal/mol for the parallel triplex (Sequence 1) in sharp contrast to the comparatively high value of\u201470.80 kcal/mol for the antiparallel triplex (Sequence 2). The latter by and large retains all the reverse Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds in all the triplets. Thus, the parallel DNA triplex with consecutive G*GC and T*AT triplets is not expected to be stable due to the mechanistic effects of extreme nonisostericity at every base step of the Hoogsteen strand.

The first pair of NIBT at the TG (T27G28) step results in a residual twist of -\u0394t\u00b0 =\u221221.6\u00b0 and effects under winding. This is followed by a residual twist of +\u0394t\u00b0 = +21.6\u00b0 at the GT (G28T29) step to effect over winding. MD simulation of this triplex reveals that the interrupting G28*G17C6 triplet loses the N1\u2026O6 hydrogen bond of the canonical Hoogsteen scheme (Fig 4A and S2B Fig) in favour of the noncanonical NC5 Hoogsteen scheme (Fig 3H). This clearly demonstrates that even an isolated nonisosteric triplet is unable to retain the canonical Hoogsteen pair and instantly transits to a noncanonical scheme (NC5) which reduces the \u0394t\u00b0 values to ~\u22124.1\u00b0 and + 4.6\u00b0 at the T27G28 and G28T29 steps respectively from the initial value of 21.6\u00b0. As a result, slightly lower (20.2\u00b0) and higher (36.6\u00b0) helical twist angles are seen at these steps occurring on either sides of the G*GC interruption (Fig 5A). Stacking interactions between the Hoogsteen bases (G28 and T29) are minimal at the GT step compared to that between T27 & G28 at the under wound TG step (Fig 5B). Better stacking between A16 & G17 and G17 & A18 and relatively poor stacking between T5 & C6 (Fig 5B) of WC paired duplex prevail.

Here again the results of MD simulation reveal preservation of canonical Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds in the nonisosteric triplet pairs (Fig 6B). The under winding effect caused by the T37G38 step is reflected in the low X-displacement for the WC pairs, C8 \u2026G23 (~ -1.31 \u00c5) and T9\u2026A22 (~ -0.65 \u00c5) respectively, proximal to the triplex junction. This is in contrast to large X-displacement seen at the GT junction interface (see above). X-displacement for the other C\u2026G and T\u2026A pairs correspond to ~ -3.23 \u00c5 and -2.45 \u00c5 respectively. Although a small warp is observed at the triplex junction (Fig 7B) it is not as prominent as in GT step junction interface (Sequence 10). Interestingly BII phosphodiester conformation is found at the under wound T37G38 (S9B Fig) while the rest favour BI. As expected, a low twist angle of ~ 15\u00b0 is found at the Hoogsteen T37G38 step concomitant with a higher twist at the abutting C8T9 (~38.3\u00b0) and C7C8 (~35.1\u00b0) steps of WC duplex (S8B Fig). Twist angles at the other CC & TT steps of the WC duplex remain at ~ 30\u00b0. As in the previous case, propeller twist for the C\u2026G pair (-4.02\u00b0) is lower than T\u2026A pair (-13.7\u00b0). Average minor groove width is ~13.12 \u00c5 in the mini G*GC triplex and it is ~11.7 \u00c5 in the mini T*AT triplex. Average major groove width in both the triplexes is ~ 21.1 \u00c5. Likewise, WH and CH groove width lie in the range of ~ 9 \u00c5 and 13 \u00c5 respectively (S3D Fig). Stacking interaction is minimal at the neighborhood of triplex junction (S8D Fig) involving Hoogsteen bases, G38 & G39 and WC duplex pyrimidines, C7 and C8. However partial stacking prevails between the purines, A22 & G23 of WC duplex Binding free energy of this triplex corresponds to ~ -78.4 kcal/mol. These data clearly brings about the distinctions in the influence of overlapping and non-overlapping NIBTs.",

The 15-mer triplex with 4 junctions or 4 sets of non-overlapping pairs of NIBTs shows a further decrease in binding free energy of ~ -44.3 kcal/mol (Sequence 14) reflecting the progressively declining stability of triplexes with increase in number of non-overlapping pairs of NIBTs as well (S11 Fig).

            "text": "One of the key revelations from the present study is the disruption of canonical Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds in both the G*GC and T*AT parallel triplets when they occur alternately (Sequence 1; Fig 2A) and as interruptions (Sequences 4\u20136, 8, 9; Fig 4A and 4B & S2 and S4 Figs) in a parallel triplex in sharp contrast to antiparallel triplex where reverse Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds remain intact (Fig 2B and S5 Fig). This is directly correlatable to the vastly contrasting nonisostericity between the triplet pairs in parallel and antiparallel orientations, as reflected in the disparate values of \u0394t\u00b0 and \u0394r \u00c5. While \u0394t\u00b0 is twice (21.6\u00b0) the value in parallel compared to 10.6\u00b0 in antiparallel triplexes, \u0394r \u00c5 is slightly larger in antiparallel (1.1 \u00c5) than in the parallel (0.4 \u00c5) triplexes. Though both \u0394t\u00b0 and \u0394r \u00c5 independently impact in creating backbone disconnect at the successive phosphodiester links, influence of \u0394r \u00c5 seems to be more in the antiparallel triplex although the effects are absorbed by the intrinsic triplex flexibility. On the other hand, mechanistic influence of the large residual twist of 21.6\u00b0 in parallel triplexes is reflected in lowering the stability sharply through disruption of Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds and associated effects through significant conformational modifications (Figs 2A, 3, 4 & 7). In contrast, smaller \u0394t\u00b0 (~10.6\u00b0) merely causes a zig-zag sugar-phosphate-sugar backbone conformation concomitant with minor twist angle variations in the antiparallel triplex and these by no means affect its formation [83]. Therefore, it can be reckoned that the role of \u0394t\u00b0 is more dominant than \u0394r \u00c5 in influencing the formation as well as stability of triplexes.",

By doing so, nonisosteric effects are offset via reduction in \u0394t\u00b0 (Fig 3D\u20133J) concomitant with loss of adjacent base stacking (Fig 8). Thus, loss of canonical Hoogsteen G\u2026G and T\u2026A hydrogen bonds together with interrupted stacking decrease triplex stability. Absence of these in the antiparallel DNA triplex [82] results in highly favorable binding free energy of -70.8 kcal/mol compared to -9.4 kcal/mol for the parallel triplex.

            "text": "As mentioned earlier, a single base triplet interruption in an otherwise homopolymeric triplex (typified by isosteric base triplets) results in two consecutive and overlapping pairs of NIBTs, with the interrupting NIBT simultaneously bearing the brunt of nonisostericity effects of +\u0394t (+21.6\u00b0) and -\u0394t (-21.6\u00b0) (Sequences 4,8; Table 1). This causes the canonical Hoogsteen hydrogen bond to switch to noncanonical scheme (Fig 3D and 3H), resulting in disrupted base stacking (Fig 5B and 5D). It is obvious that loss of even one of the canonical hydrogen bonds in the triplet interruption enables the Hoogsteen base to sway in a direction to elude the deleterious effect of large \u0394t\u00b0. The base triplet interruption under these circumstances is reckoned as a triplet mismatch and a limited number of them, spaced apart, could be tolerated in a sufficiently long sequence (Sequence 15). Systematic investigations made here suggests that an interrupting G*GC or T*AT triplet decreases the binding energy by nearly 10\u201311 kcal/mol with reference to the homopolymeric triplex (Sequence 3 vs. Sequence 4 and Sequence 7 vs. Sequence 8). This reduction nearly doubles to ~ 23 kcal/mol with 2 interruptions (Sequence 3 vs. Sequence 5 and Sequence 7 vs. Sequence 9, Table 1). Increase in the incidence of interruptions from 1 to 3 (Sequence 4 vs. Sequence 6) further reduces the binding energy by ~ 37 kcal/mol indicating a linear correlation between the base triplet interruptions and the binding energy penalty. Hence, it is obvious that multiple incidence of interruptions ie. overlapping pair of NIBTs leads to less stable nature of parallel triplex leading even to inhibition of triplex formation. On the other hand, in the antiparallel triplex (Sequence 16 vs. Sequence 17), the estimated loss in the binding energy (~3 kcal/mol) caused by an interruption due to retention of canonical reverse Hoogsteen hydrogen bond (S5 Fig) and marginal loss in stacking is not severe or detrimental to antiparallel triplex formation.",

The over winding influence of +\u0394t\u00b0 at the GT step causes the triplex to bend (Fig 7A and 7C and S10 Fig). Unwinding influence of -\u0394t\u00b0 at the TG step merely brings about change from BI to BII phosphodiester conformation (S9 Fig; Sequences 11\u201314). Comparison of the binding energies of the five 15-mer triplexes (Sequences 10 to 14) designed out of 8 G*GCs and 7 T*ATs suggest a reduction in the binding energy with the increase from 2 (Sequences 12 and 13) to 4 (Sequence 14) in the number of non-overlapping NIBTs (triplex junctions). Sequences 12 and 13 have 1 TG and 1 GT junction while in Sequence 14 there are 2 TG and 2 GT junctions. This causes a reduction in binding energy of ~ 11.5 to 13 kcal/mol (Sequence 13 & Sequence 14 and Sequence 12 & Sequence 14) when non-overlapping NIBTs are increased from 2 to 4. Using this, a crude estimate of the binding energy penalty for a non-overlapping pair of NIBTs turns out to be ~ 5.8 to 6.5 kcal/mol. This is nearly one half compared to the binding energy penalty (~ 11 to 14 kcal/mol) for an interruption entailing 2 overlapping pairs of NIBTs.",

Also, it has been shown earlier [83] that the GA step triplex junction interface also exhibits bending of ~ 17\u00b0. Besides, it is known that a tethered GT rich TFO induces a bend in the triplex formed [84, 85] which regulates the transcription of Luciferase gene [86]. Therefore it might be speculated that bent triplexes could serve as recognition sites for triplex binding proteins. Interestingly, an intramolecular triplex formed by GT rich TFO is demonstrated to bind a few hnRNP family proteins [87]. Likewise an intermolecular triplex formed by a CT rich TFO is shown to bind the GAGA transcription factor from drosophila melanogoster [88].",

            "text": "Present results convincingly provide a mechanistic argument for the experimental observations concerning the ability or lack of it for formation of parallel DNA triplex with G*GC & T*AT triplets and preference of antiparallel over triplex. For instance the 22-mer TFO, GGGTTGTGGGTTGTGGGGGTGG targeted to form parallel triplex with the human Ki-ras promoter [77], entails 5 interruptions (marked bold) resulting in 8 sets of overlapping pairs of NIBTs, of which 3 occur consecutively twice in the sequence. Apart from this, 2 sets of non-overlapping pairs of NIBTs (mini triplex junctions marked in italics and underlined) occur in the sequence. As a consequence, it is expected that a parallel triplex would be less stable owing to the disruption of canonical Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds (5 out of 22) in the 5 triplet interruptions (3 T*AT & 2 G*GC). Indeed, this TFO forms only antiparallel triplex. Similarly, the 31-mer TFO, 5\u2019GTTTTTGGGTGTTGTGGGTGTGTGTGGTTTG, designed to inhibit transcription of HIV-1 in infected human cells [75] could bind target duplex only in anti-parallel and not in parallel orientation due to presence of 12 sets of overlapping pairs of NIBTs due to 8 interruptions, spaced in proximity, effecting disruption of Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding in 8 out of 31 triplets. On the other hand, a G*GC triplet interruption in 5\u2019TTTTGTTTTG [62] and 5\u2019TTCTTCTTGTTTCT [89] does not inhibit parallel triplex formation due to loss of only one Hoogsteen hydrogen bond out of 9. Likewise the 14-mer TFO, 5\u2019 GTGGTGGGTGTGTG can form only antiparallel triplex [73] since in parallel triplex it will result in 5 interruptions (10 overlapping pairs of NIBTs) causing loss of Hoogsteen pairs in 5 out of 14 triplets. Similarly the 36-mer TFO, 5\u2019GGTGGTGGGTTGGGGTGGTGGTGTGGTGGTGGTGTT3' (10 interruptions with 19 overlapping pairs of NIBTs), and the 38-mer TFO, 5' GGGGGGGTGGGGGTGTTTGGGTGGTGTGGTGGGGGTGG 3' (8 interruptions with 15 overlapping pairs of NIBTs) targeted against the promoter region of human epidermal growth factor receptor gene and the transcription start site of mouse insulin receptor gene respectively, form only antiparallel triplexes [78] to effect transcription inhibition. Their inability to form parallel triplex is obvious in view of expected loss of Hoogsteen pairs at all the interruption sites (9 out of 36 in 36-mer TFO and 8 out of 38 in 38-mer TFO) making the triplex less viable due to lower stability.",

Likewise, a stable parallel triplex [81] is formed with the TFO 5\u2019 GGGGGTTTTCTTTT 3', in spite of GT step triplex junction (a pair of non-overlapping NIBTs) which facilitates retention of Hoogsteen pair. This finding that triplex junctions (non-overlapping NIBTs) do not significantly influence triplex formation or its stability gains further support from the observation that the 5' TTTTTGGTTTTTGG 3' forms a triplex in both parallel and antiparallel orientation with a Tm of ~ 46\u00b0C [80]. Likewise, parallel and antiparallel triplex formed by 5' GGGGTTTTGGGG 3' with 2 triplex junctions (2 sets of non-overlapping pairs of NIBTs) display a similar Tm of 57\u00b0C & 58\u00b0C [72]. But, Tm is lowered by ~ 10\u00b0C for the parallel triplex formed by the TFO 5\u2019 GGTTTGTTTTGTTT 3\u2019 compared to its antiparallel counterpart triplex formed by the TFO 5\u2019 TTTGTTTTGTTTGG 3\u2019. This can be readily attributed to the loss of 2 (out of 14) canonical Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds at the two G*GC interruptions (4 overlapping NIBTs) in the parallel triplex [80]. In the antiparallel triplex, reverse Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds are preserved since minor effects of low residual twist of \u0394t = 10.6\u00b0 are absorbed by the inherent triplex flexibility. Thus, there exists a direct bearing between the experimental observations and the number and type of NIBTs with MD simulations clearly bringing out the criticality of the mechanistic attributes of base triplet nonisostericity.",

            "text": "Growing evidence for occurrence of nucleic acid triple helices in vivo and their implication in diverse critical biological processes, disease and therapy, makes their structural study imperative. Unlike DNA and RNA duplexes where isosteric WC base pairs dominate, nucleic acid triplexes encounter mixture of isosteric and nonisosteric base triplets. Nature and magnitude of base triplet nonisostericity is solely determined by neighbouring triplets. This together with the number of nonisosteric base triplets (NIBTs) determines triplex forming ability, parallel or non-parallel, with or without sequence dependent structural variations as well as their stability. Although base triplet nonisostericity between the parallel G*GC & T*AT triplets is seemingly obvious [74] quantitative estimates of its nature and magnitude and its mechanistic influence are by no means readily comprehendible. The work presented here fills this critical gap by providing quantitative description of base triplet nonisostericity as well as their mechanistic effects in influencing stability and formation of DNA triplexes. It is found that the extreme base triplet nonisostericity (residual twist) prevalent between the parallel G*GC & T*AT triplets adds an element of instability, owing to the inevitability of significant stereochemical rearrangements, to the extent of even precluding triplex formation when their incidences are recurrent. Thus, the concept of residual twist has provided a means not only to assess the source and degree of nonisostericity but also has enabled in providing a mechanistic basis for the experimental observations in relation to the feasibility or the lack of same to form parallel DNA triplexes. Although these results are derived from analyses of DNA triplexes they should hold valid in assessing the role of nonisostericity in RNA and RNA.DNA hybrid triplexes as well thus enabling a comprehensive understanding of sequence dependent structural variation in nucleic acid triplexes in general. In fact, this concept has found an application in developing an algorithm to identify triplex forming sequences [90]. The results presented here should aid in designing more specific and efficient TFOs as gene targeting agents (antigene therapeutics). Interestingly, the concept of residual twist proved immensely useful in predicting mechanistic effects of base pair nonisostericity due to juxtaposition of Watson-Crick and different non-Watson-Crick pairs in RNA duplexes [91].",

Triplexes were solvated in a periodic box of TIP3P waters and net-neutralized with Na+ counter ions using Leap module of AMBER Tools 13.0 [123]. Following this, initial equilibration minimization was carried out using steepest descent (2000 cycles) and conjugate-gradient (500 cycles) algorithms, with a positional restraint of 500 kcal/mol \u00c52 on the solute atoms. Further minimization was carried out with positional restraints on the solute reduced in steps of 100 kcal/mol \u00c52. Subsequently, minimization was effected for 1000 cycles without any positional restraints. MD simulation was then carried out in an NVT ensemble, during which the entire system was heated from 0 to 300K over 100 ps. Further equilibration MD was carried out for 200 ps under constant pressure (NPT). Following this, production run MD simulations were initiated for 250 ns for Sequence 1 and 100 ns each for triplex sequences in Sequences 2\u201319 (Table 1). Equilibration and production run simulations were carried out using the Sander and PMEMD module (optimized for CUDA) of AMBER 12.0 (ff99+parmbsc0) respectively. Periodic boundary conditions and PME under isothermal isobaric conditions (T = 298 K; P = 1 atm) with an integration time step of 2 fs was employed in the simulation. All bonds involving hydrogen were constrained using SHAKE algorithm (tolerance = 0.0005 \u00c5) [124]. Trajectories were analyzed using Ptraj module of Amber Tools 13.0. Base pair, base step parameters and backbone torsion angles were extracted from the output of 3DNA Ver 2.1 [125] using in-house programs. Helical twist angles were calculated with respect to C1\u2019\u2026C1\u2019 vector due to the presence of nonisosteric base pairs [82, 83]. Hydrogen bond distances and angles were computed using the criteria of donor\u2026acceptor distance of < 3.6 \u00c5 and hydrogen bond angle >120\u00b0. Figures were prepared either using PyMOL (ww.pymol.org) or graphical interface of insight II [126].",
