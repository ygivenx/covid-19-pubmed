Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) is the etiological agent of a highly contagious viral disease of swine affecting domestic pigs and wild boars [1], which has caused major losses in stock farming [2, 3]. CSFV is composed of a lipid envelope, a capsid and a single plus-strand RNA genome carrying a single, large open reading frame (ORF) flanked by two untranslated regions (UTRs). The ORF encodes a polyprotein of approximately 3900 amino acids, which are processed by cellular and viral proteases in the four structural proteins\u2014C, Erns, E1, E2\u2014and in the 8 non-structural proteins\u2014Npro, P7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B [4].",

Over the six weeks after postnatal infection, most of the infected animals remained clinically healthy, despite persistent high virus titres in the blood, organs and body secretions. Importantly, these animals were unable to mount any detectable humoral or cellular immune responses. At necropsy, the most prominent gross pathological lesion was severe thymus atrophy. Four weeks after infection, PBMCs from persistently infected seronegative piglets were unresponsive to both specific CSFV and non-specific PHA stimulation in terms of IFN-\u03b3-producing cells. These results suggested the development of an immunosuppression state in these postnatally persistently infected pigs [5, 6]. In addition, it was shown that six-week-old, persistently CSFV-infected pigs were unable to elicit specific immune responses following vaccination with a CSFV lapinised C-strain vaccine (HCLV) [7]. Interestingly, the RNA of the vaccinal C-strain was undetectable by specific RT-PCR [8] in any of the samples analysed after vaccination, including blood, nasal and rectal swabs, or organs throughout the experiment, suggesting a phenomenon of homologous interference, also known as superinfection exclusion (SIE), between the high viral load generated by the primary persistent infection and the CSFV vaccine strain.",

From an evolutionary standpoint, SIE might be a conservative strategy, reducing the likelihood of recombination events between related strains [17, 21, 22], thus determining the stability of viral sequences within the same cell. From a practical standpoint, SIE has significant implications for the treatment or prevention of viral infections. In this regard, cross-protection of crops by purposeful infection with milder virus isolates is a widely accepted practice, and it is viewed as an effective and economical antiviral management strategy [23]. Additionally, transplantation of HCV-infected liver grafts has been suggested as a treatment for already infected patients, given that the transplantation of a healthy organ would lead to rapid damage to the newly transplanted liver by the virus of the recipient patient [15, 24].",

Additionally, it was shown that CSFV is generally noncytopathic, and it readily establishes persistent infections in cell culture. Nevertheless, when persistently infected cultures were serially passaged more than 100 times, spontaneous generation of cytopathogenic (cp) CSFV variants could occur. The few surviving cells of the cytopathic effect (CPE), although still infected, were also protected from the CPE after superinfection with cp CSFV [25]. Both studies supported the ability of pestiviruses to generate SIE in cell cultures. Thus, along with the availability of a persistent infection model of CSFV, in the present study, we sought to assess SIE against a highly virulent CSFV strain at the organism level in six-week-old wild boars, rendered persistently CSFV-infected at birth. Our results showed that SIE could occur at the systemic level in CSFV-infected swine.",

These animals were acquired from Gestion Cinegetica Integral SL farm (Segovia, Spain) and were housed in the experimental isolation facilities in the biosecurity level 3 laboratory of the Centre de Recerca en Sanitat Animal (CReSA); they were fed a conventional piglet starter diet and pellets until the end of the trial (Startrite 100, Kwikstart, and Prestarter; SCA Iberica S.A., Zaragoza, Spain) and were handled according to previous studies conducted in CReSA [6]. Group A (animals 1 to 3) was used as controls, and they tested Pestivirus-free at the beginning of the study. The second group (Group B), housed in an independent isolation unit at the BSL-3 facility of CReSA, (animals 4 to 6), were postnatally persistently CSFV-infected animals. These animals, which had been intranasally infected in the first 24 h after birth with the CSFV Cat01 strain, were viraemic and apparently healthy at six weeks old, although being immunosuppressed, they lacked CSFV-specific cellular and humoral responses [5, 6]. Both groups had an average weight of 6 kg per animal. After a five-day acclimation period, all of the animals were experimentally infected by i.m. injection in the neck [33\u201335] with 105 TCID50 CSFV Margarita strain. In previous studies, this viral dose caused acute CSF and often induced death at 10\u201315 days post-infection (dpi) [36]. Sera and nasal and rectal swabs were collected at 0, 3, 7, 10 and 13 dpi. Blood samples for the isolation of PBMCs were obtained at day 0 and at the time of euthanasia.",

The clinical signs compatible with CSFV infection were anorexia, fever, conjunctivitis, diarrhoea, constipation, cyanosis of the skin, abdominal petechiae, dyspnoea, tremors, locomotive disturbances, reluctant walking, swaying movement of the hindquarters, posterior paresis, convulsions from mild to severe and prostration. Particular stress was placed upon the registration of nervous symptoms [29, 33, 34, 36]. The clinical status of the animals was scored from 0 to 6 [29, 33, 34, 36] as follows: 0: no signs; 1: mild pyrexia; 2: pyrexia plus mild clinical signs; 3: mild-to-moderate clinical signs; 4: moderate clinical signs; 5: moderate-to-severe clinical signs; and 6: death. For ethical reasons, the animals were euthanised when the clinical score reached 5, when exhibiting a fall of the hindquarters, when there was inability to drink or feed, when prostration occurred or when exhibiting moderate nervous disorders. After euthanasia, an exhaustive necropsy was conducted, in which the presence of pathological symptoms in different organs and tissues was evaluated. Surviving wild boars were euthanised at 13 dpi, and urine and tissues (spleen, liver, intestine, mesenteric lymph node, prescapular lymph node, bone marrow, medulla oblongata, lung, kidney, thymus and tonsil) were obtained at necropsy. Euthanasia was performed according to European Directive 2010/63/EU, using a pentobarbital overdose of 60\u2013100 mg/kg administered via the anterior vena cava. The animal care and procedures were in accordance with the guidelines of the Good Experimental Practices (GEP), under the supervision of the Ethical and Animal Welfare Committee of the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB), and they were approved under number 8804, according to the existing national and European regulations. Additionally, the biosafety level of the viruses used in this study was stated as biosecurity level 3, as approved by the Biosafety Committee of the UAB, with registration assignment AR-296-15.",

Two primers and probes were designed for specific detection of the Margarita strain sequence (1.4 CSFV genogroup) by targeting the 5\u00b4 end of the E2 gene, as follows: forward primer (2333\u20132356), 5\u00b4-AAGATTACGACCACAATTTACAAC-3\u00b4; reverse primer (2411\u20132431), 5\u00b4-TCC TACTGACCACATTAAGCG-3\u00b4 and probe (2369\u20132389), 5\u00b4-CCATCAAGGCTATCTGCACGG-3\u00b4. The nucleotide positions were based on the genome sequence of the Margarita strain (GenBank accession number AJ704817). The probe was labelled with 6-FAM at the 5\u00b4 end and with BHQ1 at the 3\u00b4 end. The primers and probe were purified by reverse phase HPLC. The one-step RT-PCR protocol was undertaken using the commercially available TaqMan\u00ae One-Step RT-PCR Master Mix Reagents Kit (Applied Biosystems Roche). The real-time RT-PCR assay was optimised using a total volume of 25 \u03bcl. Real-time qRT-PCR was performed using an Applied Biosystems\u00ae 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System. The temperature profile was 30 min at 50\u00b0C (reverse transcription), 15 min at 95\u00b0C (inactivation reverse transcriptase/activation Taq polymerase), followed by 42 cycles of 15 s at 94\u00b0C (denaturation), 30 s at 57\u00b0C (annealing) and 30 s at 68\u00b0C (elongation). Identical temperature profiles were used for all of the real-time RT-PCR runs, and fluorescence values were collected during the annealing step. Twenty CSFV RNA preparations strains were used to determine the specificity and sensitivity of the assay (Table 1) [30, 38]. To exclude the possibility of presence of CSFV Cat01 strain RNA interfering with the assay sensitivity for the CSFV Margarita strain RNA detection, mixtures from serial RNA dilutions from both viral strains were analysed. In addition, mixtures from RNA serum samples of group B (prior to the Margarita strain inoculation), with samples from group A at 7 days post-infection with the Margarita strain, were analysed.",

The PBMCs were isolated from whole blood by centrifugation on Ficoll gradients (Histopaque-1077; Sigma). The number and viability of the PBMCs were determined by staining with Trypan blue [33]. A total of 4x105 PBMCs/well from each animal were plated in quintuplicate at 37\u00b0C in 96-well plates with: (i) vehicle; (ii) the Cat01 strain at a 0.1 multiplicity of infection (MOI); and (iii) the Margarita strain (0.1 MOI). After 72 h, the PBMCs were accurately washed twice and were resuspended in a final volume of 200 \u03bcl of PBS per well. To release the virus from the cells, two freeze-thaw cycles at -80\u00b0C were undertaken, and the quintupled samples were harvested in a single aliquot. The presence of virus RNA in PBMC samples was analysed by generic CSFV qRT-PCR [39] and for the specific Margarita strain by qRT-PCR detection assay (see above, section 2.3). For virus isolation, an established cell line sensitive for specific CSFV proliferation, ST cells, were cultured at 37\u00b0C in 96-well plates in triplicate in the presence of each of the collected cell suspensions. After 72 h, the supernatants were removed, and the collected ST cells were washed twice and resuspended in 200 \u03bcl of sterile PBS. After two cycles of freeze-thaw at -80\u00b0C, the presence of CSFV RNA in the ST cell samples was analysed by qRT-PCR for CSFV [39] and the Margarita strain (see above). In parallel, a ST plate similarly inoculated with cell suspensions was used for confirmation by PLA [27]. A delta Ct (\u0394Ct) for Margarita strain RNA detection was calculated as the differences between (i) the Margarita Ct value detected from the isolation of ST from groups A or B and (ii) the Ct value in ST inoculated with Margarita-infected na\u00efve PBMC extract, being \u0394Ct = Ct(a)-Ct (b). The whole protocol was repeated twice, in ST and also in SK6 cells using PBMCs from animals 1 (Group A), 4 and 5 (group B) and cells from the na\u00efve animal (number 1, Group A), collected before Margarita infection.",

The specificity of the assay was based primarily on mismatches in the probe-binding region but also to some extent on mismatches in primer-binding regions. The sensitivity of the assay was evaluated by testing 10-fold dilutions of the Margarita strain RNA. The analytical sensitivity was estimated to be as high as 0.4 TCID50. The assay had a reaction coefficient (R2) of 0.994 (data not shown). Positive results were considered for threshold cycle values (Ct) equal to or less than 38.

In the present work, we observed that progression of disease in group A was correlated with an increase in the levels of endogenous IFN-\u03b1 after infection, as measured by ELISA, with values that reached more than 240 U/ml in two of three animals at 7 dpi and 10 dpi (data not shown).

Consequently, to examine whether the PBMCs collected from the CSFV-superinfected animals (group B) and the acutely infected animals (group A), were permissive (or not) to CSFV superinfection, we assayed in vitro inoculation of such samples, with either Cat01 or Margarita CSFV strains. Similarly, PBMC samples were mock-infected. Additionally, PBMCs from a na\u00efve animal were used as controls. As was expected, CSFV-specific Margarita RNA was detected in the PBMCs from animals developing the CSF acute disease (group A) in both mock and Margarita-infected samples. Furthermore, PBMCs from group B in vitro inoculated with Margarita were also positive for CSFV-specific Margarita RNA detection, but with a high Ct value correlated with a lower RNA load (Table 3). Otherwise, PBMCs from group B in vitro mock-infected were negative for CSFV-specific Margarita RNA detection (Table 3). Following these findings, to decipher whether the detected RNA load in group B might correspond to RNA traces from the inocula or to the infecting virus, the previously analysed PBMC extracts were inoculated into a ST cell line. Consistently, the detected RNA load notably increased in ST after inoculation with the extract from Margarita in vitro inoculated-na\u00efve PBMCs; the obtained 7.76\u0394 Ct positive value confirmed the infectivity of the virus recovered from the PBMC samples. In contrast, Margarita RNA in group B in vitro mock-infected PBMCs remained undetectable even after ST inoculation. Furthermore, Margarita RNA load detection in group B in vitro Margarita-infected PBMC samples decreased after inoculation of ST cells, corresponding to higher Ct values than those previously detected directly from PBMC extracts. Remarkably, an 11.6 \u0394Ct value was found in the ST cells with Margarita in vitro inoculated PBMCs from group B, relative to the value obtained in the ST cell extracts from Margarita-inoculated na\u00efve PBMCs (Table 3). The whole protocol was repeated twice for animals 1 (group A), 4 and 5 (group B) in both SK6 and ST cells, supporting the results with similar Ct values (data not shown).

Against this background, we assessed the capacity of CSFV to generate SIE in CSFV persistently infected swine. For that purpose, CSFV persistently infected wild boars were inoculated with a CSFV strain that induce acute disease with a higher replication rate [29, 36].",

To differentiate the CSFV Margarita strain RNA from the CSFV Cat01 strain RNA in the samples from the present study, a specific qRT-PCR for Margarita strain RNA detection was developed. Thus, alongside the model of infection with the Margarita strain, the qRT-PCR assay developed allowed for clear discernment of whether there was actually a blockage that prevented susceptibility to infection by the second virus in both the absence of clinical signs and the absence of molecular detection of the superinfecting virus.",

Despite the important role that neutralising antibodies play in CSFV protection [29, 54], complete absence of neutralising antibodies response was found after Margarita strain infection in these animals. Similarly, absence of an IFN-\u03b3-producing cell response against CSFV or PHA was also observed. Considering the role played by IFN-\u03b3 in the control of CSFV infection [34, 55] and the lack of responsiveness to IFN-\u03b3-producing cells after PHA stimulation, the CSFV-superinfected animals maintained a immunosuppression state similar to that previously described in postnatal persistent infection [5, 6]. Previous work has proved how the failure to induce optimal levels of the humoral and cellular responses after CSFV infection promoted the spread of the virus and its relationship with disease progression [29, 54]. In this regard, the implications of the cellular and neutralising antibody response in clinical protection against the acute form in the CSFV-superinfected animals from this study are excluded.",

At the same time, the progression of the acute disease in group A was correlated with an increase in levels of endogenous IFN-\u03b1, as has been previously described [29, 46, 56, 57]. The absence of an IFN-\u03b1 response in the Cat01 persistently infected animals after Margarita strain inoculation (secondary infection) probably was due to the almost complete lack of Margarita strain replication in these animals. Otherwise, specific CSFV-blockade phenomena for IFN-\u03b1 might be occurring. Efficient viral strategies to escape the type I IFN-induced antiviral mechanisms have been described within Pestivirus. In this regard, the viral RNA triggers IFN synthesis, and the viral RNase Erns inhibits IFN expression induced by extracellular viral RNA [58]. In addition, the viral protein Npro suppresses type I IFN (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) induction by mediating proteasomal degradation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) [58\u201360]. For instance, in persistent infection, BVDV maintains \u201cself-tolerance\u201d by avoiding the induction of IFN, without compromising the IFN action against unrelated viruses (\u201cnonself\u201d) [58]. In the case of CSFV-infected pigs, it has been recently demonstrated that functional Npro significantly reduced local IFN-\u03b1 mRNA expression responses at local sites of virus replication [61]. These highly selective \u201cself\u201d models of evasion of the interferon defence system might be key elements in the success of persistent infections and could promote, in addition, the generation of SIE phenomena.",

These results suggest that SIE still occurs at the tissue level (Table 3). In contrast, the Margarita strain RNA could not be detected after the sequence analyses of the samples from persistently infected Margarita-inoculated animals (Group B) nor even in the tonsil, one of the main targets for CSFV replication [3, 63]. Nevertheless, next-generation sequence analyses would be of great interest to analyse these samples in detail, emphasising the spleen and liver tissues that were also positive for RNA Margarita strain detection after superinfection.",

Nevertheless, the colonisation of a multi-cellular host is a complex process during which the viral load can dramatically change in different organs and at different stages of the infection, and not all of the potential target cells are infected in persistently infected animals despite the high viral load generated by the Cat01 CSFV strain in persistently infected animals [5, 6]. Illustrative examples include some of the works performed to demonstrate SIE at the cellular level because some cells uninfected by one viral primary infection are subsequently infected by the second viral infection [11, 50]. In contrast, the implications of other mechanisms in the host cannot be excluded, and it remains unclear whether the observed phenomenon is really due to a blockage at the level of infection of cells. This was precisely in the case of a citrus tristeza virus (CTV) SIE model, wherein a CTV protein (p33) was required to mediate SIE at the organism level but that did not appear to be implicated in exclusion at the cellular level [50].",
