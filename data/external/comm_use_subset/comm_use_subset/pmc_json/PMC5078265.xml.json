This phenotype is determined by K loci located on the Z chromosome (Elferink et al., 2008). It has been found that the avian endogenous retrovirus gene 21 (ev21) and K genes are tightly linked (Bacon et al., 1988; Elferink et al., 2008). Chickens that harbor locus ev21 express infectious endogenous viruses (EV21; Bacon et al., 1988). The integration of ev21 is therefore associated with several avian production problems, including reduction in egg production, increases in infection by exogenous avian leucosis virus (ALV; Harris et al., 1984), and increased mortality rates (Smith and Fadly, 1988).",

            "text": "In chickens, exogenous ALVs can be classified into five subgroups including ALV-A, -B, -C, -D, and -J. Compared with endogenous viruses, exogenous ALV, especially subgroup J avian leucosis virus (ALV-J), causes serious commercial losses resulting from neoplasm and immunosuppression (Payne and Nair, 2012; Feng et al., 2016). Endogenous viruses are known to act on exogenous ALV in various ways. There is evidence that ev21 loci can induce immunological tolerance to exogenous ALV infection (Harris et al., 1984; Bacon et al., 1988). Notably, new virus and disease manifestations can arise via genetic recombination between endogenous viruses and exogenous ALV. It has been well-known that ALV-J caused damage in poultry industry all over the world (Payne and Nair, 2012) and emerged as a result of a recombination event between exogenous ALV and the endogenous retrovirus element designated EAV-HP (Sacco et al., 2000, 2004). In recent years, two novel ALV recombined by ALV-C, ALV-E, and ALV-J were identified in different lines of layer chicken in China (Cai et al., 2013). Furthermore, a novel cross-species recombinant retrovirus has been also reported (Henzy et al., 2014).",

However, it remains unclear as to whether the presence of ev21 in late-feathering Chinese yellow chickens has any effect on the host; exogenous ALV infection is of particular concern. Despite extensive control and eradication of programs against exogenous ALV has been put into practice in China, these viruses remain a challenge to Chinese poultry producers. In this respect, it is unknown whether or not a novel and dangerous ALV subgroup that recombined by ev21 and ALV-J will appear, and when the new recombined virus will appear. Thus, it is necessary to continuously monitor the chicken flock harbored ev21 seriously.",

            "text": "Previous study has found that endogenous viruses can induce immunological tolerance to exogenous ALV infection (Bacon et al., 1988). However, endogenous ev21 may not influence the adaptive immunity in late-feathering and fast-feathering chickens (Bacon et al., 1986). Given that immunological tolerance is not perfect and that endogenous viruses are part of the host genome, ev21 may activate the innate immune response by producing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) including proteins or nucleic acids (Hurst and Magiorkinis, 2015). Recently, a study published in Science showed that endogenous retroviruses have been co-opted to regulate host innate immunity (Chuong et al., 2016). In this study, we also found that the envelope protein of endogenous ev21 can facilitate the expression of PKR at 6h post ALV-J infection and facilitate the expression of ISG12 and CH25H at 24 hpi. Hundreds of ISGs are known to be induced by many viruses, and directly exert antiviral functions (Schoggins and Rice, 2011). However, to date, relatively few chicken ISGs have been identified, and their functions remain poorly understood. Our results, suggest that the envelope protein of endogenous ev21 was co-opted to regulate the expression of ISGs in the ALV-J infected DF-1 cells. Further studies will be necessary to further characterize their specific action mechanism and to extend our findings to living animal. Interestingly, our results showed that the ALV-J replication was not affected by the envelope protein of endogenous ev21. This result is consistent with our luciferase assay results. Our previous study found that chicken interferon alpha (ChIFN\u03b1) can restrain ALV replication (Dai et al., 2016b). However, it remains unknown as to which specific ISGs may inhibit the replication of ALV. We suspect that ISGs regulated by the envelope protein of endogenous ev21 are not the specific ISGs that inhibited the replication of ALV-J. In addition, ALV-J may use some unknown strategies to evade host innate immunity. The function of the endogenous retrovirus env gene was focused on placentation and receptor interference (Mi et al., 2000; Dupressoir et al., 2009; Aswad and Katzourakis, 2012). The antiviral functions of endogenous ev21 env gene await further study.",

This is a good news for the poultry industry in China. It has been well-known that ALV-J caused damage in poultry industry all over the world and emerged as a result of a recombination event between exogenous ALV and the endogenous retrovirus element designated EAV-HP (Sacco et al., 2000, 2004). What is more interesting, meattype broiler breeders, and broilers had been generally free of leukotic diseases caused by retroviruses from the 1979 to 1987 (Payne and Nair, 2012). And subsequently, ALV-J outbreak and sweep across the entire world. In order to prevent similar tragedies, I think we should continuously monitor the chicken flock harbored endogenous retrovirus seriously, especially in such a big background that chicken farm in China are eradicating the ALV and the virus is faced with enormous pressure. In addition, although endogenous retrovirus is considered to be our enemy, it is useful to us in sometimes. I think we should be aware the enemies and use it for our own purposes. Lastly, I think that our study can be as a model to continuously monitor the chicken flock harbored endogenous retrovirus and eradicate the new recombined virus in the bud.",
