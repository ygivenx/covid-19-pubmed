A common family of such methods derives from the innovatory application of a periodic regression model on pneumonia and influenza mortality data, presented by R.E. Serfling in 1963 [5]. The general principle of this type of method is the use of long-term historical data for estimating expected values for future time-dependent upper thresholds of the relevant distribution, to which the actual observations made are subsequently compared [5], [6]. Alternative sets of statistical methods that use the same general principle, but require input of relatively few recent historical data have also been proposed, yielding favorable results [7], [8]. Such statistical methods belong to the broader classes of time-series, regression and industrial quality control methods. Cumulative sum (CUSUM) statistics of the latter class, are nowadays widely used in biomedical research [7], [8], [9] and constitute one of the components of the Early Aberration and Reporting System (EARS) that is used for syndromic surveillance by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [9].",

This network performs emergency, fee-per-service, house-call visits for both adults and children on a 24-hour basis at the metropolitan area of Athens, Attica, Greece, that is populated by approximately 5 million people. The data we used referred to the 9-year period between January 01, 2000 and December 10, 2008 and were recorded by a total of 38 SOS Doctors specialists. Briefly, on each house visit they filled a specially designed form with data for the chief complaint of the patient, present illness, past medical and surgical history, physical examination, overall clinical assessment, likely diagnosis and management plan. They also filed the primary diagnosis into prespecified diagnostic categories (including upper or lower RTIs). As a general rule, lower RTIs were considered those affecting the respiratory tract below the level of the vocal cords. The operational characteristics of SOS Doctors including the methodology used for the collection and archiving of clinical data as well as the main characteristics of the patient population they serve have been described previously in detail [10]. Subsets of the database we used have also been analyzed in previous studies assessing the effects of meteorological variables on respiratory and lower urinary tract infections [11], [12].",

The ARL is a measure of the time interval between false alarms, therefore it is analogous to a Type I error. In order to understand the comparability of (k, h) parameters it should be mentioned that for a fixed k value, increasing the h value would generally result in lower sensitivity and higher specificity results (and vice-versa). The same applies for k, for a fixed h value [15]. For the purposes of this study we tested two sets of values: a) (k, h) = (0.5, 5), which is a commonly used set for a CUSUM procedure [18], [19], [20], [21], and b) (k, h) = (0.75, 1.53). The first set corresponds to an ARL of 930 weeks. For the second set of values, k was selected for the CUSUM to detect shifts of \u0394 = 2k = 1.5\u03c3, and h was calculated with respect to a specific ARL approximately representing the desired Type I error rate \u03b1 = 0.10 (as in the simple regression method). Hence, this ARL was selected to be 45, roughly one tenth of the total 467 observations. The h value, given k and ARL, was computed as 1.53. As in the simple regression model described above, we assigned values for m between 4\u20136 (weeks).",

The use of a standardized case-definition for syndromic surveillance could have helped in this regard [30]. We analyzed both upper and lower RTIs, so that our findings would not be affected from bias by potential misclassifications. Still, the upper RTIs might more clearly be associated with community outbreak of viral illnesses than lower RTIs. Accordingly, the models we used for short-term recognition of community outbreaks of respiratory tract infection performed better for upper RTIs. Instead of daily values, we selected to analyze weekly-averaged values for RTIs to minimize the likelihood for high auto-correlation or variability between successive observations. We also chose to analyze the proportion of the visits for upper or lower RTIs to the total house call visits, instead of the absolute counts of RTIs, to minimize the effect of various factors, such as seasonal variation in morbidity, meteorological conditions, vacation periods, or strikes in the public healthcare sector, which could influence the demand for private house-call visits [3], [10].",

We analyzed a large data-set of historical data as the reference standard for characterization of the outbreaks. Future studies aiming to prospectively evaluate data from house call visits for the detection of outbreaks of respiratory infections could use data from official sentinel surveillance networks, if available, as the reference standard [25]. We can only assume the performance of the models used for the detection of outbreaks after the outbreak has begun. The models might continue generating an alert for the phase of the outbreak that the number of cases steadily increases, whereas alert generation might cease once the outbreak peaks and in the phase that the number of cases decline.",

Both methods we evaluated (simple regression and CUSUM, respectively) performed reasonably well, in this regard, showing excellent sensitivity and very good specificity, when compared to a reference standard classification that used long-term historical data. A CUSUM model with a specific set of parameters appeared to be the best-fit one. The determination of the optimal set of parameters may, however, be database-specific, and it could require the evaluation of long historical time-series. Simple regression models could be elected if long-term historical data are lacking. Additional studies are needed in order to validate the performance of the above models in the prospective detection of the onset of RTI outbreaks on the basis of data for house call visits.",
