This was well illustrated by the rapid spread of the recent influenza (H1N1) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemics, where all continents were quickly threatened by an emergent pathogen in one corner of the world. The purpose of International Health Regulations (IHR[2005]) is \u201cto prevent, protect against, control and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease in ways that are commensurate with and restricted to public health risks, and which avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade.\u201d [1]. Article 13 (Public Health Response) of the IHR(2005) obligates States Parties to develop, strengthen and maintain the capacity to respond promptly and effectively to public health risks and emergencies of international concern as soon as possible but no later than five years from the entry into force of the regulations [1]. Progress by States Parties toward the attainment of the stated goals is based on eight core capacities, to be implemented by the year 2012.",

Laboratory services therefore play a major role in all the key processes of the IHR, including detection, assessment, response, notification, and monitoring of events. Developed countries with well-organized routine laboratory services can easily meet this core capacity through existing systems. However, resource-limited countries, especially those in sub-Saharan Africa, need considerable capacity building. Attaining adequate capacities will require functional community, sub-national and national systems. Therefore, laboratory capacity building for IHR core capacity 8 must by necessity focus on strengthening the routine systems within which events are detected and reported.",

The need for building laboratory diagnostic capacity in Africa has been well articulated over the recent past [2-6]. Consequently, there have been efforts to enhance laboratory capacity over the past five years in many sub-Saharan countries. These efforts have largely been driven by the need for improved laboratory support to surveillance and treatment programs for specific diseases such as HIV/ AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis (TB) and avian influenza [7] at national and a few regional centers. Indeed, a recent review by Olmsted et al (2010) suggests a general improvement in infrastructure and service provision [8]. However, more challenges still exist, including the lack of sufficient numbers of well-trained laboratory scientists in public health service and inadequate laboratory management and leadership skills. There is no or limited distribution of available national laboratory guidelines and a lack of internal and external quality assurance systems, which is usually accompanied by low appreciation of quality control. No efforts have been made towards assisting laboratories to attain international standards such as ISO 15189 and hence slow progress to accreditation. Other challenges have been the poor quality, limited analysis and utilization of laboratory data; inconsistent and inadequate reagent supply chains; and lack of equipment maintenance [9].",

Over 500 field staff have been trained in these short courses. The short course curricula are available as open resources, and AFENET provides technical support to any country desiring to conduct these courses at any time [12]. Through the graduate and short course trainings, AFENET is playing a critical role in fast-tracking the building of a sustainable senior-level cadre of laboratory personnel that will champion the attainment and maintenance of IHR core capacities in the region. Moreover, there is evidence that if appropriate steps are taken, the retention rate of these graduates in their countries of origin is quite high [11].",

Laboratory sites implementing BLIS receive an initial evaluation prior to installation of the software which is customised to the facility needs. The laboratory receives hardware as well as training.

WHO advocates for the establishment of national public health networks to ensure the timely exchange of information and the adequate support of laboratory services at all levels. At both the national and sub-national levels, only a few countries have functional public health laboratory networks in place. In order to strengthen public health capacity within Africa, AFENET created an AFENET-Lab unit to oversee the networking and implementation of laboratory strengthening initiatives. One of the unit\u2019s mandates is to promote public health net working and cross-border collaborations between sub-national, national, regional and inter national public health laboratories and laboratorians for information sharing, technical support, training and other capacity building programs. We believe that this will enhance laboratory capacity by reducing the isolation of peripheral laboratories and enabling them to access network resources. AFENET-Lab began a pilot laboratory net working project in Uganda in 2009, when a memorandum of understanding was signed with the Ministry of Health, Biomedical Laboratory Network (BLN), Uganda Medical Laboratory Technology Association (UMLTA) and Uganda Association of Biomedical Scientists (UABMS).",

To address this problem, the training sub-committee of the Uganda National Health Laboratory Technical and Advisory Committee (LTC) received financial and technical support from AFENET to put together a comprehensive training package to equip laboratory workers with the management skills they require to be effective in their positions. The training packages are a compilation of learning materials from various partners that were customized to meet the requirements of agreed upon curriculum.
