            "text": "Chronic viral hepatitis C (HCV) is characterized by a progression of fibrosis, which ultimately leads to the formation of cirrhosis. The management of chronic hepatitis depends on the degree of liver fibrosis. Thus, the assessment of the degree of liver fibrosis is important for choosing a therapeutic strategy and for determining the prognosis. Liver biopsy is the gold standard method for evaluating the degree of liver fibrosis [1]. However, the invasive nature of liver biopsy makes it impractical, especially for patients who require follow-up [2]. Therefore, many reports have demonstrated noninvasive examination methods for assessing the degree of fibrosis in chronic liver disease, which may be alternatives to liver biopsy, such as new serum biomarkers or biomarker panels and transient elastography [3\u20135].",

It is well established that key activators of the inflammatory and reparative response after tissue injury, such as proinflammatory cytokines, damaged tissue-derived signals, and microbial molecules, induce PTX3 production in different cell types, including vascular endothelial cells, mesenchymal cells, and fibroblasts, as well as in cells of innate immunity, such as monocytes and granulocytes. Neutrophils store PTX3 in secondary granules and upon appropriate stimulation promptly release it. In a simplistic view, PTX3 plays a crucial role in inflammation through activation of the complement cascade and inhibition of P-selectin-mediated neutrophils extravasation. Since PTX3, an acute-phase protein rapidly produced by vascular tissues as well as by cells of innate immunity in response to inflammation, is a rapid and reliable marker for primary local activation of innate immunity and inflammation in several disorders, including acute kidney injury, severe acute respiratory syndrome or LPS-induced lung injury, atherosclerosis, and acute myocardial infarction [for more detail, see review [6]].",

In various murine models of tissue damage, including skin-wound healing, chemically induced sterile liver, and lung injury and arterial thrombosis, PTX3 deficiency was associated with increased clotting as well as with fibrin and collagen deposition/persistence, epithelial hyperplasia, and defective mature tissue formation at healing. This phenotype was attributed to the lack of PTX3-dependent facilitated plasmin-mediated fibrinolysis by tissue remodeling cells, which is a prerequisite for appropriate tissue repair [7]. In this respect, fibrin and other provisional extracellular matrix proteins are deposited after tissue injury and their subsequent timely degradation is essential for tissue repair [12, 13].",

The experiments in cell showed that while PTX3 is mainly expressed in neutrophils in healthy liver; in injury it is mainly expressed in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) [14], the main cell type responsible for the reparative response after tissue injury and liver fibrosis [15]. The differential expression of PTX3 in healthy and injured liver together with the data that show that PTX3 drives HSC activation [14] suggest that in response to injury PTX3 released by neutrophils may promote HSC activation. However, in chronic liver disease, activated HSCs would become the main cell type producing PTX3, which may enhance the reparative response after liver injury and exert protective and immune modulatory effects. In light of these observations, further clinical studies are needed to elucidate the precise role of the PTX3 in liver fibrosis.",

We performed one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to evaluate whether PTX3 was useful to judge the METAVIR fibrosis score or not. Afterward, we examined the correlation of PTX3 with liver function parameters and other conventional fibrosis markers using the Spearman rank correlation. For logistic regression analyses, the P value of each independent variable was determined by the Wald chi-square value (Wald), which was calculated by squaring the ratio of the regression coefficient divided by its standard error. The diagnostic value of PTX3 for predicting significant (F\u22652) and advanced fibrosis (F\u22653) or cirrhosis (F=4) was assessed by calculating the areas under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves. ROC curves were generated by plotting the sensitivity against 1 \u2212 specificity, and the area under the curve (AUC) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) was calculated. According to DeLong [24], the empirical nonparametric method was performed to make pairwise comparisons of ROC curves. Based on the ROC analysis the optimum cut-off point was established by selecting the value that provides the greatest sum of the sensitivity and specificity, i.e., the point closest to the upper left point of the ROC plot. For the optimum cut-off point provided by each ROC analysis, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated using standard formulas. Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using Statistica version 13.3 and R version 3.5.1.",

PTX3 significantly correlated with the histological stage of liver fibrosis (rho = 0.64, P < 0.001), and the levels of PTX3 were significantly higher in patients with significant fibrosis (F\u22652) compared to F0-F1 (P < 0.001) (Figure 1(b)). PTX3 was also significantly higher in patients with advanced fibrosis (F\u22653) compared to F0-F2 (P < 0.001) (Figure 1(c)). We used ordered logistic regression analysis with METAVIR fibrosis score as the dependent variable and PTX3 and ten biochemical parameters as the explanatory variables. In the univariate analyses, natural logarithms of the serum PTX3 and TGF-\u03b21 levels provided the most significant coefficients (Wald = 66.78, P <0.01 and Wald = 96.06, P <0.01, respectively) (Table 2). Since PTX3 was related to the histological stage of liver fibrosis in HCV patients, we investigated whether PTX3 correlated with validated fibrosis markers, including direct serum markers (hyaluronic acid (HA), transforming growth factor\u2010\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), and indirect markers, such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to platelet index (APRI index), FIB\u20104 score, and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase to platelet ratio (GPR ratio). Serum PTX3 levels were significantly correlated with HA (Figure 2(a)) and TGF-\u03b21 (Figure 2(b)) (P < 0.001 each). There was also a significant correlation between PTX3 levels and indirect serum markers of liver fibrosis, including APRI index (Figure 2(c)), FIB-4 score (Figure 2(d)), and GPR ratio (Figure 2(e)) (P < 0.001 each). Additionally, using the Spearman rank correlation analysis, a positive correlation between LSM and PTX3 level (rho = 0.53, P < 0.001) was observed (Figure 2(f)).

This complies with previous studies [16\u201318, 30], which show close associations between PTX3 levels, disease progression, and stages of liver fibrosis in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and/or alcoholic hepatitis and chronic viral hepatitis C. The results of our study further demonstrate that among ten variables, including PTX3 level, platelet count, albumin, AST, ALT, GGT, total bilirubin, INR, HA, and TGF-\u03b21, both PTX3 and TGF-\u03b21 (a direct fibrosis marker) were the most significant serum markers associated with severity of liver fibrosis. Although there was a positive correlation of PTX3 with the progression of liver fibrosis stage (rho = 0.64, P < 0.001) in our patients with HCV, the results from an in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro studies [7, 10] suggest that PTX3 exerts a hepatoprotective and a modulatory effect on chronic inflammatory events, taking into account the fact that PTX3 protein and regulation are conserved between mice and humans [31]. One likely explanation of this apparently contradictory result is that PTX3 might be expressed as a strong evidence emerging from studies of Perea et al. [14] suggesting that the liver may be an important source of circulating PTX3. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that PTX3 hepatic gene expression and plasma levels showed a positive correlation in patients with alcoholic hepatitis and alcoholic cirrhosis. Independent of their etiology, the common hallmark of chronic liver diseases is chronic inflammation which shows a correlation with the progression of fibrosis. In the injured liver chemotactic stimuli trigger the rapid recruitment of immune cells including macrophages and neutrophils. These infiltrating immune cells then produce numerous proinflammatory cytokines and growth factors, which trigger the activation of myofibroblasts, the main effector cells of tissue remodeling [32]. Accordingly, there are reasons to believe that the increase in circulating PTX3 levels is likely triggered by ongoing production of proinflammatory cytokines at necroinflammatory injury, including IL-1 and TNF-\u03b1, which are known to be potent inducers of PTX3 release [33].",

In the early stages where fibrosis reduces PTX3 production may be more efficient than in the advanced fibrosis stages with more inflammation. On the contrary, in the CCL4-induced liver injury model, PTX3 deficiency did not affect necrosis; however, it was associated with an augmented fibrosis [7].

The AUCs of reported fibrosis markers (APRI index, FIB\u20104 score, GPR ratio, HA, TGF-\u03b21, and LSM values) increased as the liver fibrosis stages progressed; the AUC of PTX3 increased accordingly as well. The diagnostic performance of PTX3 was significantly better than that of the GPR ratio for detecting F\u22652 with an AUC = 0.802. It is worth noting that PTX3 shows better diagnostic accuracy than the FIB-4 score, but with overlapping confidence intervals; therefore, it is not significantly different. Several studies evaluated the diagnostic performances of FIB-4 score and APRI index as noninvasive algorithms for detecting significant and/or advanced fibrosis [34\u201336]. They all obtained similar results as us, except for Wai et al., who found that the mean APRI AUC for significant fibrosis is 0.800 [20]. This APRI test showed that AUCs for detecting significant fibrosis ranged from 0.740 to 0.870, which was similar to the diagnostic performance of PTX3 (0.756-0.906). In light of these observations, results about the possible use of PTX3 as an early marker for predicting fibrosis stages are promising and further both preclinical and clinical studies are needed to elucidate the precise role of the PTX3 in the fibrosis.",

            "text": "There are three main strengths of this study. Firstly, the sample size (n = 138) was large enough and included well-determined baseline clinical characteristics. Although the number of patients enrolled might seem relatively small, it adequately represented the sample size estimated to provide the specific power. Secondly, in this study, we excluded patients with fatty liver disease, which may affect the LSM values. Thirdly, major strength of the study is the comparison to FibroScan\u00ae as this novel elastography technique fulfills a number of the requirements of an ideal noninvasive marker of fibrosis. However, FibroScan\u00ae has some limitations such as the lack of standardized cut-off for diagnosing fibrosis stages [32]. Because we relied on a single determination of PTX3, we cannot take into account any variation that may have occurred over time. However, this does not seem to be a major limitation because other fibrosis markers were measured only once in this study. Finally, liver biopsy is prone to sampling errors in the scope of the evaluation of the degree of liver fibrosis, leading to bias. Despite the fact that in this study PTX3 detects significant fibrosis with similar accuracy to that of indirect biomarkers APRI and FIB-4, PTX3 is still clinically relevant as it reflects fibrosis-related inflammation and not liver function such as APRI and FIB-4 calculation (AST and ALT values). Further, recent progress in antiviral treatment has normalized AST and ALT values in many patients even though they still have fibrotic liver [37]. In this context, PTX3 may be of more clinical relevance in terms of the general clinical practices related to the monitoring of patients whose treatment has been deferred to reconsider the indication of treatment and to discuss new therapies as they emerge.",
