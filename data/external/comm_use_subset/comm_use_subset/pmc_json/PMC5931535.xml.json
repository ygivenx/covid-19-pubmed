These clinical associations, however, are neither predictive of a certain HPIV species nor mutually exclusive. Low- and middle-income countries have a high burden of disease due to severe ALRI with the highest number of HPIV infections among young children. High-risk populations include individuals with chronic respiratory conditions, prematurely-born infants, and the immunosuppressed. HPIV3, in particular, infects younger children after waning of maternal antibodies4. Nonetheless, country-specific descriptions of clinical profiles for individual HPIV species are largely lacking5. Clinical severity has been attributed to the ability of the virus to efficiently replicate in the upper respiratory tract prior to spread to the lower respiratory tract2,6. Whereas the majority of HPIV infections occurs in children, these viruses can infect individuals from all age groups. Consequently, they likely form one gene pool with endemic circulation across all ages.",

Transmission of HPIVs is by close contact and short-range transmission by respiratory droplets with minimal aerosol transmission9. HPIV also retains its infectivity on inanimate objects for up to 10 hours10 and its incubation period as found in volunteer studies was estimated at 3\u20136 days11.

Results indicated that HPIV1 has been circulating in humans since the 1940\u2019s, with time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) estimated as 1948 (95% highest posterior density (HPD): 1944\u20131952) (Table 2). Since the mid-1990s, HPIV1 has diverged into two distinct monophyletic lineages (clades 1 and 2) that co-circulate worldwide. All Vietnamese viruses sequenced within this study clustered in clade 2 along with viruses from Argentina, Japan and USA (Fig. 1A). Limited genetic data is available for HPIV2 and HPIV4 and this may influence the estimation of dates and these results must therefore be interpreted with caution. The mean TMRCA for HPIV2 was estimated as 1896 (95% HPD: 1850\u20131925). HPIV2 also diverged into two clades with clade 1 viruses predominant in the 1980s until they were superseded by clade 2 viruses during the early 2000s (Fig. 1B). All Vietnamese HPIV2 viruses sequenced from this study, as well as all sequences obtained after the year 2000 from Asia, belong to clade 2. The mean TMRCA of the HPIV4 viruses was estimated at 1955 (95% HPD: 1938\u20131968), while the TMRCAs for HPIV4A and HPIV4B were estimated as 1989 (95% HPD: 1981\u20131994) and 1994 (1989\u20131998), respectively.

HPIV3 has also diverged into two major monophyletic clades (clades 1 and 2 in Fig. 2). In marked contrast to other HPIVs, the HPIV3 phylogeny exhibits more extensive lineage diversification in the 2000s, with some indication of continuous genetic drift, indicated by a ladder-like phylogeny27, that is more evident within the clade 1 than clade 2 (Fig. 2A). Viral lineage turnover is also present, whereby older virus strains become extinct and are replaced by newer strains. Clade 1 viruses also demonstrated greater diversification of multiple independent lineages and inter-continental mixing of the viruses than clade 2 viruses. Our results also show that the HPIV3 infections in Viet Nam during 2009\u20132010 resulted from at least five independent virus introductions that are highlighted as clades V1\u2013V5 in Fig. 2A. The viruses detected in Viet Nam were generally closely related to viruses from East Asia, although clades comprised viruses from diverse geographic areas (for examples see Fig. 2B and C). In clades V2 and V4 there is one cluster each of HPIV3 viruses from Viet Nam that were detected over a period of 14\u201315 months, suggesting sustained endemic circulation. The mean TMRCA of clade V4 was estimated as 2005 (95% HPD: 2004\u20132006) suggesting that these viruses may have been circulating in Viet Nam for at least 5 years. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that this may be due to inadequate global sampling and sequencing of HPIV3 viruses. We also reconstructed the HPIV3 phylogeny using 24 newly generated whole genomes and 138 publicly available genomes. The whole-genome HPIV3 phylogeny was largely congruent with the HN phylogeny, showing multiple clades of viruses that circulate globally (Supplementary Fig. 1).",

In the inpatient cohort, which in contrast to the outpatient cohort used clinically manifesting ALRI as an inclusion criterion, two cases of HPIV3 infection resulted in admission to the intensive care unit, possibly indicating enhanced pathogenicity of HPIV3 over the other species as suggested previously1,4,29, although the episode duration was similar for all HPIV species.",

Our rate of viral co-infections of 41% is within previous reports and highlights the importance for screening for several viral pathogens simultaneously32. Rhino-/Enteroviruses were most commonly found in combination with HPIV, possibly due to longer duration of shedding with the former and/or frequent orofecal transmission in paediatric patients33. Notably, co-detection of bocavirus was found among all HPIV species and in both cohorts. Furthermore, the complete absence of influenza virus co-infection in both cohorts is remarkable. Human adenovirus, human respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, seasonal coronaviruses, and human parechovirus were only incidentally detected in combination with HPIV. The concurrent detection of HPIV3 and HPIV4 occurred in nine instances in the outpatient cohort, suggesting this combination to be rather common. HPIVs are usually detected throughout the year, but enhanced epidemic transmission probably occurs during the colder months of the year. Fry et al. described an interaction of HPIV1 and HPIV3 detections in the US30. In our study, we found co-detection of HPIVs year-round, however, no distinct peak was observed. This is likely due to the study design as the original studies among in- and out-patients were conducted over a limited time span.",

Two groups of HPIV1 co-circulate globally but only restricted diversity was detected in this study. Viet Nam viruses belong to clade 2 and are most closely related to virus sequences from Argentina, Japan and USA. In contrast, HPIV3 sequences from Viet Nam belonged to multiple clades and grouped with viruses from diverse geographical regions. Multiple introductions of HPIV3 into Viet Nam were observed in 2009 and 2010, and in two cases these may have resulted in sustained endemic transmission, while clades comprised of viruses from different geographical areas suggests frequent transmission between those areas. In addition, phylogeographic analysis indicated that Viet Nam was a net importer of HPIV3 diversity. While other viruses such as influenza A/H3N2 viruses and RSV circulate globally35\u201338, this has not been demonstrated for HPIV, but is a probable scenario. However, the current lack of sequence data, particularly from large population centres, renders it difficult to draw firm conclusions on the transmission of these viruses at any temporal or spatial scale without additional sampling from diverse geographical regions.",
