CDV produces immunosuppression3 in susceptible hosts by targeting cells that express the signalling activation molecule (SLAM)4, which frequently results in opportunistic infectious diseases caused by agents such as Bordetella bronchiseptica5,6, Candida sp.7, Clostridium piliforme8, Toxoplasma gondii9\u201311, Dirofilaria immitis11, Mycoplasma cynos12, and Talaromyces marneffei13. Although the occurrence of CD is significantly reduced in domestic dog populations in developed countries due to the use of vaccination14, the disease is endemic and a major cause of canine mortality in urban populations of Brazil15,16, where an estimated 147.5\u2013160.3 million USD is spent annually due to the therapy of the systemic effects of CDV15.",

Additionally, studies have detected canine infectious disease agents due to the amplification of nucleic acids in symptomatic6,23\u201325 and asymptomatic19 dogs by molecular assays. Alternatively studies have combined the pattern of organ disease observed by histopathology with electron microscopy20, immunohistochemistry (IHC)8,12,21,22,25,26 and/or the molecular identification8,10,12,18,22,27 of infectious disease agents of dogs.",

The objectives of this retrospective study were to evaluate the frequency of concomitant traditional infectious disease agents in the development of infectious diseases in puppies, correlate the presence of these pathogens with histopathologic patterns, and review specific aspects of the pathogenesis involving these infectious disease agents.",

At the cornea, there were areas of disruption of the basement membrane of the corneal epithelium, separation of the Descemet\u2019s membrane, and foci of ballooning degeneration of the corneal epithelium (Fig. 6B,C). Furthermore, there was degeneration and necrosis of the epithelial cells of the lacrimal glands at the conjunctiva with ballooning degeneration to the adjacent epithelium. These affected lacrimal glands were surrounded by accumulations of moderate lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory cells (Fig. 6D); being the only focus of inflammatory reaction observed within the eye of this puppy. By IHC, there was positive immunolabelling for CAdV-1 antigens at the degenerated epithelial cells of the lacrimal glands at the conjunctiva (Fig. 6E), degenerated anterior epithelium of the cornea (Fig. 6F,G), and the bile duct epithelium of the liver (Fig. 6H), but without immunoreactivity to hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, or the oedematous gallbladder epithelium.

Consequently, these puppies demonstrated pathologic and histopathologic findings that could be attributed to conventional canine diseases including CD, ICH, parvoviral enteritis, CIRD, and neosporosis. Additionally, antigens of CDV were more frequently identified by IHC in the epithelial cells of the lungs (n = 11), predominantly in the white matter of the cerebellum (n = 5), and brainstem (n = 4) of these puppies (Supplemental Fig. 2). It must be highlighted that CDV antigens were only identified from five dogs with a histopathologic diagnosis of white matter demyelination. Furthermore, antigens of CDV were identified in the epithelial cells of the intestine (enterocytes and dilated/necrotic crypts) of two puppies that were simultaneously infected with CPV-2. This widespread distribution of CDV antigens in affected organs, demonstrated the tropism of this virus to produce infection in multiple tissues.",

The location (cytoplasmic or nuclear) for the labelling of the antigens for all infectious disease pathogens observed during this study is consistent with previous studies26,36. During this investigation, 60% (9/15) of the puppies demonstrated triple or quadruple infectious diseases; similar results were described in a population of German Spitz puppies18, while a 45-day-old puppy was infected by five pathogens10, and triple viral infections were diagnosed in dogs from Mexico by IHC26. These findings suggest that concomitant infectious diseases in dogs, principally in puppies, as observed in this and other studies8,10,12,21,22,26 may be more frequent than previously described, and can result in sudden death, as occurred in all puppies from this study, probably due to multiple organs failure10.

            "text": "Nevertheless, this is one of the few studies that have associated traditional infectious disease pathogens of dogs with their respective histopathologic patterns and the intralesional identification by IHC; this strategy was used to identify several infectious disease pathogens in puppies8,11,26,38. This methodology has the advantage of confirming the participation of infectious disease agents in the development of disease processes, since tissue antigens are easily observed within histological sections39. Alternatively, other investigations have used several methods to associate the participation of pathogens with disease in dogs, including the exclusive identification of characteristic histopathologic findings5,7, histopathology with electron microscopy20, genotyping35, and with the IHC identification of associated pathogens21,26,38, or histopathology with molecular testing10,12, and in situ hybridization, ISH12,27. Moreover, these investigations have identified the presence of infectious disease pathogens using molecular techniques in symptomatic9,23,24, or asymptomatic19 dogs. Although there are advantages and disadvantages with the utilization of diagnostic IHC40, this method is recommended for the identification of intralesional antigens of infectious disease agents in Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue sections36,39,41, and has been used extensively in veterinary medicine39. Additionally, immunohistochemistry, ISH, and electron microscopy, unlike molecular identification methods, clearly demonstrates the active participation of the infectious disease agent in the development of the disease process, while the molecular identification of disease pathogens does not necessarily imply that the identified pathogen is the cause of the associated disease process42.",

These findings demonstrated the disseminated tropism of CDV for epithelia and its capacity to induce clinical disease with associated histopathologic alterations in multiple tissues. The concomitant infections identified in most puppies can be attributed to the immunodepressive effects of this virus3,4, associated with the immature immunological system of these puppies, which facilitated the development of simultaneous infections in the same puppy. The immunodepressive effects associated with infections induced by CDV is associated with the selective destruction or impairment of cells that express the signalling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM, CD150) due to tropism for lymphoid tissues4. Moreover, experimental studies have demonstrated that in cases of fatal CDV-induced infections, as occurred during this study, there are reduced gene expressions of interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) and interleukin-4 (IL-4)43. Collectively, reduced expression of cytokines (IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4) and downregulation of CD150 cells may be the key to understand the immunodepressive effects of CDV.",

Additionally, gallbladder oedema was observed during the autopsy of several of these puppies during this investigation, as well as in other studies20,45,46. Moreover, the \u201cblue eye\u201d phenomenon and gallbladder oedema observed in one puppy are considered as typical clinical findings associated with CAdV-130,33,49,50. Intriguingly, positive immunolabelling to CAdV-1 was observed within hepatocytes and/or Kupffer cells but not at the oedematous epithelium of the gallbladder in any of these cases, while there was positive immunoreactivity to CDV at the oedematous gallbladder in one of these puppies. These findings might suggest that gallbladder oedema in ICH is not a direct viral-induced lesion but may be associated with CAdV-1 related haemodynamic alterations that are characteristic of this disease30,49, resulting in oedema to the gallbladder but without IHC evidence of this viral pathogen. However, the absence of positive IHC detection of CAdV-1 antigens in these cases can also be related to the clearance of the virus from the gallbladder and be time dependent, since infected dogs develops effective antibody response resulting in virus clearance from the liver seven days post-infection30. The authors have not located any manuscript that described this association, so these results are unique and add to the understanding of this important disease of dogs. In addition, the positive labelling of CDV at the oedematous epithelium of the gallbladder may simply represent the widespread tropism of this virus for epithelia and not directly related to the development of oedema at this or any other location.",

This ocular lesion is traditionally considered and accepted as a type III hypersensitivity reaction of CAdV-130\u201332,50,53, and occurs in 20% of recovered puppies after 2\u20133 weeks of being infected31,32,53. However, in the case herein descried (puppy #15) as well as the eye from a previous study10, there was oedema of the corneal stroma with disruption of the anterior corneal epithelium and the Descemet\u2019s membrane; these lesions were previously described in experimentally induced CAdV-1 infection puppies in which where there were accumulations of neutrophils, mononuclear inflammatory cells31,32,51, and fibrinous exudation31,32, frequently resulting in uveitis and interstitial keratitis31,32. However, in the cases herein described, moderate inflammatory reactions were restricted to the conjunctiva of puppy #15 and not observed in any anatomical region of the eye of a puppy from a previous study10. Alternatively, degenerative alterations to the corneal epithelium were not described in the experimentally induced ocular disease31,32,52. Furthermore, the post-infection period of the occurrence of corneal oedema in ICH seems to coincide with the initial manifestations of hepatocelular necrosis30,49. However, in puppy #15 with the \u201cblue eye\u201d phenomena, hepatocellular swelling (hydropic degeneration) and not hepatocellular necrosis was the predominant histopathologic pattern with positive immunoreactivity observed only within epithelial cells of bile ducts. While in puppy #16, there was necrohaemorrhagic hepatitis associated with intranuclear inclusion bodies characteristic of CAdV-1, with the hepatic disease being further aggravated due to the concomitant presence of intralesional cysts of T. gondii10. Additionally, the hepatocellular alteration as observed in puppy #15 is frequently described in ICH49, and may be associated with reduction in levels of blood glucose33. Consequently, it is proposed that CAdV-1 should be considered as a possible cause of hepatocellular degenerative lesions in puppies, principally those that have died after an acute onset of clinical manifestations.",

            "text": "Collectively, these findings may suggest that the histopathologic features of the ocular lesions associated with CAdV-1 seem to be predominantly degenerative in the spontaneous disease herein described and inflammatory in experimental-induced infections. Although the differences in histopathologic findings observed between the spontaneous ocular disease and the experimentally induced lesions32,52,54 are not fully known, we postulate that these differences might have occurred due to several factors. Firstly, they may be related to the routes of inoculation in the experimental studies; being subcutaneous and intravascular31,51 or intraocular32,52, as compared to the oronasal exposure in the natural disease. Secondly, the post-inoculation observation period of 2\u20133 weeks31 relative to the one week after initial manifestation of disease in the spontaneous disease can also contribute to these histopathologic differences. Furthermore, these time-based differences can be related to the pattern of histopathologic lesion observed in ICH. The hepatic pattern observed in puppy #15 was degenerative and not necrotic, and may probably represent an initial manifestation of hepatocellular injury induced by CAdV-1, since hepatocelular degeneration is commonly observed in ICH49, and antigens of CAdV-1 were identified in another puppy with this pattern of hepatic injury. Thirdly, the viral load used in the experimentally induced infectious studies might have been significantly elevated when compared to that of the spontaneous exposure of susceptible puppies to CAdV-1. Notwithstanding the above findings, two inflammatory phases of the CAdV-1 associated ocular disease were proposed50,52,55: the first is considered as a subclinical/clinical infection that is characterized principally by oedema with mononuclear accumulations and occurs at the anterior uvea, while the second is predominantly manifested by corneal oedema with histopathologic lesions indicative of type III hypersensitivity and results in keratouveitis. However, these phases are based on the results of experimental induced studies and not on the spontaneous occurrence of this unique ocular disease. Nevertheless, additional spontaneous cases of the \u201cblue eye\u201d phenomenon are required to efficiently characterize and understand the histopathologic findings of the ocular lesions in puppies naturally infected by CAdV-1.",

In this case, the puppy did not demonstrate clinical manifestations suggestive of muscular disease; therefore, canine toxoplasmosis and not neosporosis was suspected, since T. gondii is frequently identified in dogs infected by CDV9,10. This puppy contained CDV RNA by RT-PCR, with additional positive immunolabelling for CDV, CAdV-2 and CPV-2, resulting in a quadruple infection; five infectious disease agents including T. gondii and CDV were diagnosed in puppy10. Moreover, coinfections of Leishmania chagasi, N. caninum, and T. gondii have been investigated in dogs, where it was suggested that the immunodepressive effects of L. chagasi might have influenced infections by N. caninum and T. gondii58. Therefore, one wonders if the known immunodepressive effects of CDV4 might have favoured the development of the protozoan infection in this puppy. This case represents one of the few documented reports of coinfections involving CDV and N. caninum in dogs. A clinical study demonstrated seropositivity to N. caninum in a dog with neurological manifestations and the simultaneous molecular identification of CDV nucleic acid9. Nevertheless, additional studies confirming concomitant infections involving these two infectious disease agents are required to efficiently evaluate this intriguing relationship.",

During this study, antigens of CAdV-2 were identified in the bronchiolar epithelium of puppies with interstitial pneumonia and CIRD, as well as in the liver of puppies with a histopathologic diagnosis of necrohaemorrhagic hepatitis and hepatocellular degeneration; similar findings were observed by ISH in puppies with interstitial pneumonia but without necrotizing bronchiolitis27 and by IHC in dogs with pneumonia26. However, we have not located a previous description of the intrahepatocellular localization and intestinal of CAdV-2 in dogs; disseminated infections involving the brain, lung, spleen and with ISH signals in Kupffer cells but not hepatocytes associated with CAdV-2 have been described in dogs with neurological manifestations27. These findings suggest that CAdV-2 can be associated with extra-pulmonary disease and that the occurrence of this pathogen should be investigated in multiple tissue of dogs. Additionally, the widespread identification of CAdV-2 in multiple organs and in several puppies can be associated with the immunosuppressive effects of CDV2, since all puppies were simultaneously infected by both pathogens.",

Additionally, antigens of CDV, CAdV-2 and intralesional cysts of N. caninum were also identified concomitantly within the intestine in some of these puppies with haemorrhagic enteritis, suggesting that these infectious disease agents should also be included in the differential diagnoses of puppies with clinical histories of bloody diarrhoea.

However, when the head conformation of purebred dogs was analysed, brachycephalic breeds were more frequently affected relative to dolichocephalic dogs; similar findings were described in an epidemiological study of 250 dogs naturally infected by CDV16. Moreover, it was proposed that brachycephalic breeds are more predisposed to develop CD60, other neurological disorders, ocular and facial dysfunctions61 when compared to dolichocephalic dogs. Although the actual reason for this breed predisposition to develop diseases has not been fully elucidated, phenotypical head conformations of brachycephalic dogs was suggested as a possible reason due to differences in the orientation of the olfactory bulb in these specific breeds of dogs61. Additionally, dysfunctions to the olfactory bulb have been associated with the development of neurodegenerative diseases in humans due to the accumulations of pathologic proteins, \u03b1-synuclein, and neurofilament protein in the affected areas62. Consequently, it can be theorized that brachycephalic breeds of dogs are more likely to develop neurological disease, including CD, relative to their dolichocephalic counterparts, due to predisposed genetic confirmations at the olfactory bulb. Nevertheless, studies are needed to confirm the possible existence of histological differences at the olfactory bulb of brachycephalic and dolichocephalic breeds of dogs.",

Canine morbillivirus (CDV) continues to be one of the most important infectious disease agents of puppies and due to its immunosuppressive effects can facilitate the development of other infectious disease pathogens. The histopathologic pattern observed in the spontaneous cases of the \u201cblue eye\u201d phenomenon associated with infection by CAdV-1 in ICH was predominantly degenerative in nature. Antigens of CAdV-1 were not detected in association with gallbladder oedema in multiple animals from this study. Hepatocellular degeneration may be an initial degenerative phase of infections associated with CAdV-1, particularly in puppies that died suddenly. Interstitial pneumonia in dogs should be associated with multiple viral infectious disease pathogens, and several infectious disease pathogens must be included in the differential diagnosis during the investigation of the cause of death in puppies.",
