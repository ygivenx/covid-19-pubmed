The autophagic response to HSV-2 infection was not previously assessed. Thus we monitored autophagy flux in cells during HSV-2 infection using sequestosome1 (or p62) immunoblotting. p62 is a protein that is degraded mainly by autophagy and thus its levels represent a reliable indicator of autophagy flux in cells303132. Id est, accumulation of p62 marks suppression of the autophagy flux, whereas its depletion reflects autophagy induction303132. We found that HSV-2 infection does not cause any significant changes in autophagy flux in host cells (Fig. 1a\u2013d). This result indicated that HSV-2, similarly to HSV-1, prevents autophagy induction in response to infection, but meanwhile maintains the basal autophagy activity of the host mostly unhampered.",

To investigate such a role of autophagy in HSV-2 infection, we used pharmacological means to suppress cellular autophagy levels. First, we used chloroquine to suppress autophagy. We found that chloroquine treatment of the cells led to reduced viral yields in cells (data not shown). Various chemical agents have been classically used in the field to suppress autophagy, however some of these agents suffer from side effects that make it difficult to interpret whether the results are directly caused by autophagy. For example, 3-methyladenine, a commonly used autophagy inhibitor, was also reported to enhance basal autophagy despite suppressing starvation-induced autophagy33. In addition, chloroquine and vinblastine were shown to cause autophagy-complicating nonspecific effects such as mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition34. In a comparative study testing various side effects of autophagy inhibitors, bafilomycin A1 (BFN), a well-known autophagy inhibitor that blocks fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes35, was shown to have least nonspecific effects, and no effect on mTOR activity, in treated cells in contrast to other agents tested34. Thus, we decided to confirm the chloroquine preliminary finding with a more specific autophagy inhibitor, BFN.",

We then confirmed BFN-mediated suppression of autophagy through p62 and LC3 immunoblotting. Suppression of basal autophagy by BFN was confirmed by the accumulation of p62 along with LC3-II (Fig. 2a). To rule out any possible effects of BFN on viral entry, we incubated the cells with HSV-2 for 2 hrs, and the cells were then untreated or treated with BFN. Using HSV-2-GFP virus, we monitored the progress of infection microscopically. We observed a significant drop in virus levels in BFN-treated, relative to mock-treated, cells (Fig. 2b,c). To confirm this finding, we employed a quantitative FACS-based assay to measure virus yields in cells. We found that BFN-mediated block of autophagy suppressed viral yields and HSV-2 infection (Fig. 2d,e). To further confirm, we determined virus levels in the cells via qPCR virus genome quantification. qPCR assay confirmed that BFN treatment significantly reduces HSV-2 infection (Fig. 2f). Moreover, the possibility of cell death upon BFN treatment was ruled out (Fig. 2g). These results demonstrated that suppression of basal autophagy in host cells interferes with viral replication and the progress of infection.",

Even at higher MOIs, ATG5\u2212/\u2212 MEFs still showed significant block of infection (Fig. 5a,b). qPCR assay also showed that ATG5 knockout in cells dramatically diminishes the infection (Fig. 5c). Finally, we determined virus titer from WT or ATG5\u2212/\u2212 cells using plaque assay. While WT cells secreted approximately 102-103 plaque-forming units (PFU)/monolayer, ATG5\u2212/\u2212 cells secreted approximately 106-107 PFU/monolayer (Fig. 5d). Additionally, in order to rule out the possibility that autophagy deficiency may interfere with virus entry into cells, we assessed internalized virus levels in WT or ATG5\u2212/\u2212 cells. We found that autophagy deficiency does not affect virus entry into the cells (Fig. 5e).

First, we tested the effect of autophagy inhibition on infection in other cell types. We found that autophagy suppression caused a significant reduction of infection in a retinal pigment epithelial cell line (Fig. 6a,b) or in human foreskin fibroblast cells (Fig. 6c,d). Second, using ATG5\u2212/\u2212 cells, we assessed the importance of autophagy for infection at various time points and under infection with various MOIs. We found that autophagy deficiency was always associated with diminished viral replication levels and infection under all these condition (Fig. 6e,f). Finally, this requirement of autophagy for infection was independent of the virus strain used (Fig. 6g). Collectively, these results confirm that basal autophagy is an important factor required for a robust HSV-2 infection.",

Induction of autophagy was previously shown to enhance HSV-1 viral clearance and diminish viral growth2339. HSV-1 establishes virulence through inhibiting cellular autophagy2223, or at least preventing its activation29, during infection. In this study, we show that HSV-2 prevents autophagy induction but maintains the basal levels of the pathway (Fig. 1). Although reports suggested that HSV-1 may inhibit autophagy via ICP34.5-mediated beclin1 binding while HSV-2 ICP34.5 was not tested for its ability to bind beclin1, our results may suggest that HSV-2 ICP34.5 also binds beclin1 to a certain extent; however this hypothesis remains to be experimentally investigated. Notably, a closely related \u03b1-herpesvirus, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), which lacks the ICP34.5 gene can allow robust induction of autophagy responses to infection4041. Moreover, in similarity to HSV-2 results shown here, autophagy suppression downregulated VZV virus replication and growth in cells40. Thus, these findings together suggest that these different viruses may benefit from the autophagy pathway to varying extents and perhaps the viral autophagy-modulating genes serve to optimize or fine-tune the autophagy flux to levels that bolster each virus\u2019s growth, according to the differential reliance of each virus on autophagy. The present study provides insights that may support this concept which requires further work to be firmly established.",

Under certain autophagy-inducing conditions such as nutrient deficiency and some viral infections, autophagy may be induced above its constitutive levels. Induced autophagy qualifies the cell to adapt to drastic conditions and generate required energy from alternative sources, or to combat infections121314394243. On the other hand, basal autophagy performs various homeostatic and quality control functions such as preventing protein aggregation or limiting reactive oxygen species (ROS) production3738. Basal autophagy takes place at low or modest levels under normal conditions and regardless of the feeding conditions, as in embryogenesis44. A prominent example of basal autophagy is autophagy in neuronal cells and the brain. Autophagy in the brain proceeds at its basal levels, without significant induction even under nutritional deficiency (due to the fact that the brain can quickly compensate nutrient deficiency by relying on nutritional supply from other organs). Disruption of such basal autophagy leads to neurodegeneration, indicating that the role of basal autophagy is important for normal neuronal cell functioning and survival45. Moreover, suckling and non-suckling ATG7\u2212/\u2212 mice all died at the same time, within 1 day of birth38, suggesting that the reason of death is not due to nutrient deprivation and that it may be due to disruption of a cellular function performed by basal autophagy. The absence of induced autophagy in HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection and persistence of basal autophagy suggest a role for this basal autophagy that supports infection (as we show here for HSV-2).",

Third, autophagic vesicles may facilitate intracellular trafficking of the virions. For example, virions can be released from the cell via fusion of the lysosomes with the plasma membrane46.

Inflammasomes induce maturation and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines50, which represent powerful antiviral effectors515253. Autophagy-deficient cells (lacking LC3B or beclin1) showed increased NALP3 inflammasome activity and caspase-1 levels, and exhibited enhanced inflammatory responses (e.g. interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, and IL-18) to lipopolysaccharide in vitro and in vivo54. Autophagy could also limit inflammasome activity directly through targeting inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2 for autolysosomal degradation55. Additionally, several autophagy proteins target components of the antiviral type-I interferon (IFN) response. Atg5\u2013Atg12 blocks caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-mediated signaling and the downstream production of type I IFN5657. Also, Atg9 was shown to regulate STING (Stimulator of Interferon Genes) cytoplasmic localization and thus control IFN-I responses5859. It is thus possible to hypothesize that autophagy-deficient cells inherently possess elevated cytokine levels that help confer on these cells resistance to HSV-2 infection.",

            "text": "In addition to the role of autophagy in regulating an innate immune response to infection, housekeeping functions of autophagy may also provide a possible reason for supporting HSV-2 infection. First, autophagy-mediated removal of damaged organelles such as mitochondria (mitophagy) prevents accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Ref. 60). ROS may induce NALP3 inflammasomes61, type-I IFN responses62, or cytokine production in response to infection63. Compounds that enhance ROS production suppress HSV infection64, while factors that relieve herpesvirus-induced oxidative stress65 significantly enhance infection6667. Second, protein aggregation under autophagy-deficient conditions38 could also present a reason for infection halt. Third, dysregulation, in ATG5\u2212/\u2212 cells, of metabolism and turnover of metabolites known to regulate infection6869 may contribute to their resistance to HSV-2 infection. Finally, a distinct role of autophagy machinery in enodosomal trafficking and endolysosomal functions was recently reported70. Perhaps, impairment in autophagy-deficient cells of intracellular endosomal trafficking of viral, or infection-regulating cellular, components participates to infection suppression in these cells.",
