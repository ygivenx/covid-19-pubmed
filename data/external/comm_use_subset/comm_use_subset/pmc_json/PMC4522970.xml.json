MERS-CoV is most closely related to Tylonycteris bat coronavirus HKU4 and Pipistrellus bat coronavirus HKU5 [1], highlighting the ever present threat of zoonotic transmission of novel pathogenic coronaviruses. Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) resembles acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS) caused by severe acute respiratory disease syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and 2003, with some MERS patients exhibiting progressive respiratory distress and renal failure [1, 2]. Despite similarities in overt clinical disease, MERS-CoV is distinct from SARS-CoV in that the virus utilizes a different cellular receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) [3], and exhibits an expanded host cell tropism, readily replicating in a variety of human lung cell types including fibroblasts, microvascular endothelial cells, and type II pneumocytes [4].",

Human cell culture models of MERS infection have shown a deficiency in interferon (IFN) induction and innate immune responses, which may in part result from multiple mechanisms of MERS-CoV regulation of host antiviral responses. In addition to accessory protein 4a (p4a), the MERS-CoV viral papain-like protease (PLpro) can also block IFN-\u03b2 induction, as well as downregulate expression of CCL5 and CXCL10 pro-inflammatory cytokine genes [5, 6]. Siu and colleagues showed that the block in IFN production is in part the result of MERS-CoV p4a interaction with cellular dsRNA-binding protein PACT that interferes with the activation of RIG-I-like receptors RIG-I and MDA5 [7]. In A549 lung epithelial cells and human bronchus and lung tissue ex vivo cultures, MERS-CoV SA 1 failed to induce significant expression differences of IFNB1 and TNF genes relative to mock throughout the 72 hour infection course [8]. The delay of IFN-\u03b2 expression in response to MERS-CoV was also observed in Calu-3 airway cells [9]. In a separate study, the expression of a panel of interferon-responsive genes, including DDX58 (encoding RIG-I), IL1B, and CXCL10, was undetectable in human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures infected with MERS-CoV SA 1, despite efficient viral replication [10]. However, pre-treatment of HAE cells with recombinant IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03bb suppressed MERS-CoV SA 1 replication, indicating viral sensitivity to innate immune responses [10].",

The human immune response to MERS-CoV appears to be distinct across patients, with increased secretion of IL-17A and IL-23 in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) supernatants and increased CXCL10 in serum of patients infected with MERS-CoV [12]. The patient with the poor outcome showed decreased expression of innate immune genes, such as DDX58, IFIH1 (encoding MDA5), IRF3, IRF7, IFNA, and IFNB1, which may be the result of host and virus-specific genetic differences. Recent phylogenetic analyses of the complete viral genome from 21 different MERS cases demonstrate the extent of adaptive changes in MERS-CoV since the initial outbreak [13].",

We first characterized topological differences of the whole transcriptome on Euclidean metric space for the collection of 93 samples (mock, MERS-CoV SA 1, MERS-CoV Eng 1 and icSARS-CoV) using recent methods from computational topology, including persistence homology [15, 16]. Many data reduction methods rely on embedding high-dimensional data into two dimensions. Multi-dimensional scaling (MDS), for example, calculates coordinates for a 2-dimensional embedding of the experimental data by minimizing the deviation between embedded and original data (Kruskal stress). Persistence homology, on the other hand, performs computation of topological invariants in the dimension of the original dataset and is, unlike MDS, more stable under perturbation. To assess global kinetic dissimilarities across different CoV infections, we calculated topological differences between MERS-CoV SA 1, MERS-CoV Eng 1 and icSARS-CoV, each grouped throughout all time points and with data set-matched mock samples. The kinetics of the host response refers to the spread of infected samples relative to mock samples over time. There were large topological differences between MERS-CoV Eng 1 and icSARS-CoV (score: 2.42), and between MERS-CoV SA 1 and icSARS-CoV (score: 2.18), and moderate differences between MERS-CoV Eng 1 and MERS-CoV SA 1 (score: 0.29) (Methods and Table 1).",

MERS-CoV genomic RNA was measured by qRT-PCR using primer (KL200F) located in the leader region (nt 9-28) and primer (KL201) located in the ORF1 region of the CoV genome (Figure 1A and Additional file 1: Table S5). Additionally, we measured viral titers by plaque assay and found MERS-CoV SA 1 had more robust infectious viral particle production than MERS-CoV Eng 1, with significantly different viral titers at 18 and 24 hpi, despite similar viral genomic RNA levels at these late time points (Additional file 2: Table S4). In measuring viral genomic RNA and infectious viral particle production, we assessed two different stages in the viral life cycle and the data support differences in the kinetics of replication for the two MERS-CoV strains. Since our analysis focuses on the host response to infection and its origin in pathogen recognition and activation of innate immune responses, we computationally integrated viral genomic RNA with host mRNA to better assess the differences in host response kinetics. Towards this end, we used a filtered clustering method [17] that reduced the space of 93 samples to a clustering graph of 18 nodes. First, the viral genomic RNA levels were used as a filter to bin the samples into overlapping subsets with similar viral load (i.e., viral gRNA). Second, within each subset, samples that showed a high degree of interconnection were retained. Thus, there was high similarity in gene expression levels within each subset. For a graphical representation, each set of retained samples formed a node and nodes were considered as adjacent whenever they had at least one sample in common (Methods and Figure 1B). Mock-infected samples were all in one isolated cluster. With increasing viral load, the temporal delay between MERS-CoV Eng 1 and MERS-CoV SA 1 started as early as 3 hours post infection (hpi), with 3 and 7 hpi MERS-CoV Eng 1 samples clustering with 7 and 12 hpi MERS-CoV SA 1 samples. Genomic RNA levels at 18 and 24 hpi between the two viruses were not statistically different as determined by the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test. Despite similar viral gRNA at 18 and 24 hpi (Figure 1A), the filtered clustering approach demonstrated MERS-CoV Eng 1 and MERS-CoV SA 1 were distinct at the late time points, with 18 and 24 hpi MERS-CoV Eng 1 samples separated from 24 hpi MERS-CoV SA 1 samples (Figure 1B).",

Compared to MERS-CoV SA 1 there was an accelerated host response to MERS-CoV Eng 1, with differential gene expression observed as early as 7 hpi. As shown in Figure 2, MDS representation of MERS-CoV SA 1, MERS-CoV Eng 1 and icSARS-CoV samples for 6432 DE genes changing in at least one virus condition and at one time-point confirmed the early onset of host responses to MERS-CoV Eng 1 infection and the sustained separation between MERS-CoV Eng 1 and MERS-CoV SA 1 beginning at 18 hpi. The MDS representation also showed MERS-CoV Eng 1 samples in an intermediate position between MERS-CoV SA 1 and icSARS-CoV, with the host response to icSARS-CoV being largely delayed until 30 and 36 hpi. There is increasing evidence that interferon (IFN) antagonism and avoidance of interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) effector functions are major contributors to the delayed host response in icSARS-CoV infection [18, 19]. In this context, the intermediate positioning of MERS-CoV Eng 1 between MERS-CoV SA 1 and icSARS-CoV led us to investigate MERS-CoV strain-specific differences in innate immune signaling early in infection and the subsequent impact on the later host response.",

            "text": "The greatest number of gene expression differences between MERS-CoV SA 1 and MERS-CoV Eng 1 were induced at the late time points, with 2160 genes and 2611 genes differentially expressed (DE) at 18 and 24 hpi, respectively (Figure 3A). There was a total of 4861 DE genes between MERS-CoV SA 1 and MERS-CoV Eng 1 in at least one time point (herein known as contrasting genes). In comparison to MERS-CoV SA 1, there was an earlier host response to MERS-CoV Eng 1 at 7 and 12 hpi. The accelerated Calu-3 response to MERS-CoV Eng 1 may be the result of the difference in kinetics of viral gRNA replication, with MERS-CoV Eng 1 more efficiently replicating at 3 and 7 hpi compared to MERS-CoV SA 1 (Figure 1A). Alternatively, the delay in the host response to MERS-CoV SA 1 may be due to the virus more efficiently evading innate immune responses that leads to enhanced viral replication compared to MERS-CoV Eng 1 (Additional file 2: Table S4). Between the two viruses there are amino acid differences in ORF4a and PLpro, viral proteins known to modulate the innate immune response during MERS infection [5\u20137]. We further examined host gene expression at the early time-points (3, 7 and 12 hpi) and found significant enrichment of genes associated with the STAT3 pathway. STAT3 pathway genes CDC25A, MYC, SOCS3 and SOCS4 were more strongly induced by MERS-CoV Eng 1 compared to MERS-CoV SA 1, particularly at 7 hpi (Figure 3B). Increased SOCS gene expression and decreased expression of PIM1 gene in response to MERS-CoV Eng1 indicated decreased STAT3 activity and possibly differential induction of apoptosis-related pathways. In a direct virus comparison, differential expression of pro-apoptotic BID, BAX, and BIM genes was observed at the early time-points and by 24 hpi there was extensive cytopathic effects caused by both viral infections that was likely the result of caspase-dependent apoptosis, as previously shown for MERS infection [20]. Of the 4861 contrasting genes, 2653 genes were also DE against time- and data set-matched mocks. Hierarchical clustering of the 4861 DE genes resulted in distinct gene clusters, with striking expression pattern contrasts between MERS-CoV SA 1 and MERS-CoV Eng 1 at 18 and 24 hpi. As shown in Table 2, functional analysis of the five most prominent clusters with contrasting gene expression revealed enrichment of integrin linked kinase (ILK) signaling and epithelial adherens junction signaling pathways, glutathione metabolism, and interferon and pro-inflammatory signaling pathways. Genes related to glutathione metabolism included GSTM1 and GSTM3, which were strongly downregulated in response to both viruses. ISGs, IFIT1 and IFIT3, were highly induced in response to both MERS-CoV Eng 1 and MERS-CoV SA 1, with pronounced early up-regulation specifically in response to MERS-CoV Eng 1. Genes associated with ILK signaling and epithelial adherens junction signaling pathways were strongly downregulated in response to MERS-CoV SA 1, whereas MERS-CoV Eng 1 predominantly up-regulated expression of these genes at the late time points (Additional file 3: Figure S1). Within the highly enriched pathways, cellular genes including PVRL1, RHOF and CREBBP with highest expression contrasts between the two infections were chosen for confirmation by qRT-PCR (Additional file 4: Figure S2). Pro-inflammatory CSF3 gene was found more highly induced by MERS-CoV SA 1 (log ratios in MERS-CoV SA1 and MERS-CoV Eng1 respectively: 2.2 and 0.5), whereas CCL5 gene was more highly induced by MERS-CoV Eng 1 (log ratios in MERS-CoV SA1 and MERS-CoV Eng1 respectively: 0.71 and 2.2). Examination of the aforementioned contrasting genes showed that only a small number of those were already differentially expressed at the early time-points. For example, expression of RHOF gene in response to MERS-CoV Eng 1 was increased 4-fold relative to mock at 12 hpi, whereas MERS-CoV SA 1 did not induce RHOF gene expression at this time-point. We therefore focused on differences in the host response mainly at the later time-points that had the highest number of contrasting genes.",

To explore potential mechanisms regulating cytokine activity in response to MERS-CoV, we designed a microarray experiment to analyze Calu-3 responses to various cytokine treatments and develop signatures that were then examined in the context of MERS-CoV-infected Calu-3 cells. Calu-3 cells were treated with either human recombinant interferon IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, TNF or IL-1\u03b1, and cell lysates collected at different time points post-treatment for microarray. We found 399 DE genes responsive to recombinant IFN-\u03b1 and 261 DE genes responsive to recombinant IFN-\u03b3, and as expected, the majority of these genes were up-regulated following stimulation [22]. In response to pro-inflammatory cytokine treatment, we found 76 DE genes responsive to recombinant TNF and 383 DE genes responsive to recombinant IL-1\u03b1, which were also differentially expressed in response to MERS-CoV SA 1 or MERS-CoV Eng 1. Many of these genes showed cytokine-specific expression for IFN-\u03b1 (260 DE genes), IFN-\u03b3 (107 DE genes), and IL-1\u03b1 (209 DE genes (Figure 4A). TNF induced the least number of DE genes compared to the other cytokines (8 DE genes). Within the cytokine-stimulated genes we identified a set of 149 genes showing strong contrasts at late time points (18 and 24 hpi) between MERS-CoV SA 1 and MERS-CoV Eng 1 (Figure 4B).",

Through a separate binding motif prediction analysis using JASPAR and PSCAN, we confirmed the STAT3 prediction based on enrichment of STAT3 binding sequences in DE genes at the late time points (Table 3).

In addition to BCL3, several other contrasting STAT3 target genes, including BCL6, IL11, and PML, have been reported to impact pro-inflammatory responses [28\u201330], epithelial integrity and the severity of lung injury after infection [27, 31]. We postulate the difference in pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression may be the result of differential STAT3 activity. For example, SARS-CoV directly impacts STAT3 activity by dephosphorylating STAT3 at Tyr-705 after 18 hpi in infected Vero E6 cells [32]. Here, the MERS-CoV strain-specific differences may be a causative factor in leading to differential STAT3 activation and the down-stream effects of pro-inflammatory responses.",

            "text": "At present, nonhuman primates serve as the best available model of MERS-CoV pathogenesis, with animals developing moderate clinical disease and signs of histopathologic changes in the lung [33, 34]. While there is no current small-animal model of MERS infection, immunocompromised mice transduced with an adenoviral vector expressing human DPP4 show increased susceptibility to MERS-CoV infection [35]. In a separate study, a variant of Pipistrellus bat coronavirus (BtCoV) strain HKU5 expressing the SARS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein ectodomain (BtCoV HKU5-SE) resulted in enhanced morbidity and acute changes in lung histopathology in aged BALB/c mice following mouse adaptation [36]. The present cytokine systems approach provides valuable insight into differences of cellular antiviral responses to distinct MERS-CoV strains. In line with these observations, reversal of infection gene signatures that can attenuate viral replication or enhance innate immune responses to the most highly pathogenic MERS-CoV strain could be investigated in this model system. We are beginning to better understand that different MERS-CoV strains can result in variable host responses, as observed with the recent clinical study by Faure and colleagues [12]. The patients infected with MERS-CoV SA 1 and MERS-CoV Eng 1 had both a fatal outcome, with the MERS-CoV SA 1-infected patient succumbing to infection within 11 days after admission, 18 days to death following initial symptoms [1]. The MERS-CoV Eng 1 patient on the other hand had an initially transient illness and then rapidly declined to a severe acute respiratory distress syndrome remaining in this state for 9 months before death [2]. Having an efficient innate immune response likely dictates a patient\u2019s disease progression and would thus be a primary goal for in silico drug predictions, which could then be tested in vitro with a particular focus on cytokine stimulated genes [37]. Toward this end, extending the collection of transcriptomic profiles to include more MERS-CoV strains will be important for a deeper view of the host response during MERS infection and toward a greater understanding of MERS-CoV pathogenicity.",

We used a freely available MATLAB implementation of this algorithm (http://appliedtopology.org/) with the parameter setting filterSamples = 5, pverlapPct = 65, mFudge = 5. The topology induced by a distance matrix can be described by a filter function, which assigns to every sample a value (phenotypic outcome, viral load, etc.). First, the topological space is decomposed into overlapping subsets using level sets of the filter function. The set of samples falling into a particular subset are clustered, and the cluster tree is partitioned into two parts using statistical criteria of the single linkage length. Only the part of the cluster tree with small linkage lengths (dense part) is retained. If resulting filtered clusters of different subsets have at least one sample in common, then they are defined as adjacent in a global discrete cluster graph. Topological differences between MERS-CoV SA 1 and MERS-CoV Eng 1 gene expression during the course of infection was furthermore assessed using homology persistence barcodes (only 0- and 1-homology were taken into account) as described in [15]. For calculations, we used the freely available R package phom [40] and their maximum weighted bipartite graph matching [41] as a measure of difference (see R script implementation in Additional file 5).
