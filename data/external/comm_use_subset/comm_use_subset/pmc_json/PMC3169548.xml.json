            "text": "Mammalian cells respond to viral infection by producing pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and also interferons (IFNs), of which type I IFNs, consisting of IFN-\u03b2 and several IFN\u03b1 proteins, are particularly important. IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 then act in an autocrine and paracrine manner to switch on hundreds of target genes which contribute to anti-viral innate immunity by blocking virus replication and alerting neighbouring cells to the danger of infection (reviewed in [1]). In addition to their role in innate immunity, type I IFNs also promote adaptive immune responses by priming T helper cells and cytotoxic T cells [2]. The initial production of type I IFNs is due to the activation of IFN regulatory factors (IRFs), and in particular IRF3, downstream of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which recognize viral DNA, RNA and proteins. PRRs that detect the presence of foreign RNA include the RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) and retinoic acid induced gene I (RIG-I), which sense intracellular double-stranded (ds) RNA and single-stranded (ss) RNA containing a 5\u2032 triphosphate, respectively [3]\u2013[6]. Other PRRs that aid the detection of viruses include the endosomal toll-like receptors (TLRs), namely TLR3 which senses dsRNA, TLR7 and TLR8 which sense ssRNA and TLR9 which recognizes unmethylated DNA (reviewed in [7]). Intracellular DNA sensors such as AIM2, RNA polymerase III, DAI and IFI16 are also involved in sensing DNA viruses by recognizing the presence of dsDNA in the cytosol [8]\u2013[15]. RNA polymerase III, DAI and IFI16 signal to cause type I IFN production, while AIM2 activates the inflammasome leading to processing of pro-interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and release of IL-1\u03b2 [9], [11], [12], [15]. RNA polymerase III is unusual in that it does not signal directly in response to DNA, but instead transcribes AT-rich DNA into RNA species, which are then recognized by RIG-I [8], [10].",

            "text": "The signalling pathways activated by the RLRs, the IFN-inducing intracellular DNA receptors and by TLR3 converge at the level of the kinases TNF receptor associated factor (TRAF) family member NF-\u03baB activator (TANK)-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and I\u03baB kinase-\u03b5 (IKK\u03b5). These kinases exist in complexes with the scaffold proteins TANK, NAP1 (NAK-associated protein 1) or SINTBAD (similar to NAP1 TBK1 adaptor) [16]\u2013[18]. To activate these kinases, RLRs and consequently RNA polymerase III signal via the adaptor protein MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signalling) [19]\u2013[21], other intracellular DNA sensors employ STING (stimulator of IFN genes) [22], [23], while TLR3 uses TRIF (TIR-domain containing adaptor molecule inducing IFN-\u03b2) [24], [25]. PRRs also require TRAF3 for the activation of TBK1 and IKK\u03b5 (reviewed in [26]). Once activated by PRR signalling, TBK1 and IKK\u03b5 phosphorylate IRF3, causing its translocation to the nucleus and the transcriptional activation of promoters containing appropriate binding sites, such as the IFN-\u03b2 and CCL5 promoters, and a subset of promoters containing IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs) [27], [28]. A related transcription factor of the IRF family, IRF7, also plays an important role in anti-viral responses and can be activated in a similar manner to IRF3 during viral infection [29]. However, while IRF3 is expressed constitutively, IRF7 is present at low levels in most cells, but is induced by type I IFNs in a positive feedback loop. Thus, IRF7 is particularly important for the continued expression of IFN-\u03b2 during viral infection, and also contributes to induction of IFN-\u03b2 by co-operation with IRF3 [29], [30]. In addition, IRF7 is essential for the induction of IFN-\u03b1 genes that are not induced by IRF3 [29]. In plasmacytoid dendritic cells, an alternative TBK1- and IKK\u03b5-independent signalling pathway resulting in the activation of IRF7 is employed by TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9. These endosomal TLRs signal through the adaptor protein MyD88 (myeloid differentiation factor 88), leading to activation of the kinase IKK\u03b1 which then phosphorylates IRF7 [29], [31], [32]. This is unusual, because in other PRR signalling pathways IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2 are involved in the phosphorylation of the inhibitor of NF-\u03baB (I\u03baB), causing its degradation and the subsequent activation of NF-\u03baB. NF-\u03baB is another transcription factor activated by PRRs, and is critical for innate immunity. NF-\u03baB and IRF3 (or IRF7) co-operate with the activating protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factor family to induce the transcription of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter.",

            "text": "A functional type I IFN response provides a potent means of controlling virus infections [33] and consequently viruses have evolved numerous counter-measures to stop the production or action of IFNs or IFN-induced anti-viral proteins (for review see [34]). These strategies include blockage of antiviral PRR signalling pathways (reviewed in [34], [35]). Viruses with a large DNA genome, such as poxviruses, encode an extensive array of immunomodulatory proteins. Vaccinia virus (VACV), an orthopoxvirus used as a vaccine to eradicate smallpox, has many immune evasion mechanisms, and these include intracellular proteins that block PRR signalling, secreted factors that sequester IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines, and proteins that inhibit the effector actions of an IFN response (reviewed in [36]). However, the exact function of many of the approximately 200 virus proteins remains unclear. Here, a functional screen was used to identify VACV proteins that inhibit the induction of the type I IFN response after PRR activation. It is shown that protein C6, the product of the C6L gene, is an inhibitor of IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation. The C6 protein is a member of a family of VACV proteins that includes B14, A52 and K7 [37], [38]. The crystal structures of B14, A52 and K7 were solved [39], [40] and showed that they, and also VACV proteins N1 [41], [42] and F1 [43], adopt a Bcl-2-like fold. Functional characterisation showed that only F1 and N1 inhibit apoptosis [42], and consistent with this these proteins have a surface groove for binding BH3 peptides from pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins [42], [43]. In contrast, proteins B14, A52 and K7 lack this groove and inhibit innate immune signalling pathways instead [40], [44]. Interestingly, the protein N1 is both anti-apoptotic and inhibits NF-\u03baB activation induced by IL-1 [40], [42], [45].",

Inhibition of IRF3 and IRF7 by C6 may be mediated by its interaction with the scaffold proteins TANK, NAP1 and SINTBAD. Consistent with the ability of C6 to inhibit IFN-\u03b2 expression, recombinant viruses that do not express C6 are attenuated in vivo compared to the wild type and revertant viruses.

            "text": "To uncover novel VACV proteins that inhibit innate immune signalling pathways, a functional screen of proteins from VACV strain Western Reserve (WR) was used to identify those that inhibit type I IFN induction. For this, poorly characterized proteins encoded in the terminal regions of the VACV WR genome were selected, because these regions are rich in immunomodulatory proteins [46]. Proteins encoded within the highly conserved central region of the VACV genome were excluded from the screen, as were proteins with well-characterized functions, secreted proteins and those smaller than 8 kDa. This selection process identified 49 ORFs, and these were amplified from VACV WR strain genomic DNA, and cloned into mammalian expression vectors. Plasmids encoding these ORFs were transfected individually into HEK293 cells, and the effect on the IFN-\u03b2 promoter following PRR stimulation was measured by reporter gene assays. ORF VACVWR022 (gene C6L in VACV Copenhagen strain) encoding the protein C6 emerged from this screen as an inhibitor of IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation. Expression of C6 inhibited the activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter by transfected poly(dA-dT) (which acts via intracellular DNA sensors) or poly(I\u2236C) (which acts via RLRs) in HEK293 cells (Figure 1A, B), and by infection of cells with Sendai virus which activates RIG-I signalling [4] (Figure 1C). C6 also inhibited poly(I\u2236C)-induced IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation in mouse NIH3T3 cells (Figure 1D). Furthermore, the presence of C6 inhibited the expression of endogenous IFN-\u03b2 mRNA in Sendai virus-infected cells (Figure 1E), as well as the secretion of the chemokine CCL5 from infected cells (Figure 1F). Thus, the C6 protein significantly reduced the expression of IFN-\u03b2 and CCL5 after stimulation of PRRs by ligands or viral infection.",

In a similar way, the kinases IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2 phosphorylate I\u03baB, which then releases activated NF-\u03baB and allows its nuclear accumulation. To investigate whether the signalling pathways leading to NF-\u03baB or IRF3 activation are inhibited by C6, the translocation of the NF-\u03baB subunit p65 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus was measured by confocal microscopy. For this, HEK293T cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing GFP-tagged C6, or a control plasmid expressing GFP for 16 h. The cells were then infected with Sendai virus for 6 h, or stimulated with IL-1 for 15 min, fixed and stained for endogenous p65. During Sendai virus infection, approximately 20% of control cells expressing GFP displayed p65 accumulation in the nucleus (Figure 2A, B), and the presence of GFP-tagged C6 did not affect the extent of p65 nuclear translocation. Furthermore, the expression of C6 did not affect the nuclear accumulation of p65 in cells stimulated with IL-1, an activator of NF-\u03baB, which, regardless of whether the cells expressed GFP or GFP-tagged C6, caused p65 nuclear translocation in more than 80% of cells (Figure 2A, B).",

This assay uses a fusion protein consisting of the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 and the transactivation domain of IRF3. When the IRF3 transactivation domain is phosphorylated by upstream signalling events, it induces expression of a luciferase reporter gene under the control of a Gal4-dependent promoter. Using this assay, C6 inhibited poly(dA-dT)-stimulated IRF3 transactivation (Figure 3C), providing further evidence that C6 inhibits the activation of IRF3 by PRRs. To determine which step of the signalling cascade that leads to IRF3 activation is targeted by C6, the ectopic expression of signalling proteins that act upstream of IRF3 activation was used to drive the IRF3 transactivation assay. The RLR adaptor MAVS and the kinases TBK1 and IKK\u03b5 all promoted IRF3 activation in this assay when overexpressed (Figure 3D, E). Co-expression of C6 inhibited the activation of IRF3 in a dose-dependent manner in each case (Figure 3D, E), indicating that C6 acts at the level of these signalling components or further \u2018downstream\u2019 to prevent IRF3 activation.",

A LUMIER interaction assay was used, in which a FLAG-tagged scaffold protein and luciferase-tagged TBK1 were co-expressed in the presence or absence of C6, and the amount of luciferase co-immunoprecipitated with the FLAG-tagged allele was quantified [17], [53].

Similar results were obtained for the interactions between the scaffold proteins and IKK\u03b5, which were not disrupted by C6 (Figure S2A\u2013C).

These viruses included a C6L deletion virus (v\u0394C6) lacking the C6 ORF, a plaque purified wild type virus (vC6WR) that was isolated from the same intermediate virus as the deletion mutant during transient dominant selection (see methods), a revertant virus where the C6L ORF was re-inserted into the deletion virus at its natural locus (vC6Rev), and an additional recombinant virus (vC6FS) where the C6 translational initiation codon was disrupted by the insertion of an adenine nucleotide. As expected, this virus, as well as v\u0394C6, did not express C6 protein whereas vC6WR and vC6Rev both did (Figure 6B). For localisation and interaction studies a virus expressing HA-tagged C6 was constructed (vC6HA). Reduced levels of C6 were detected from this recombinant virus using the anti-C6 serum, perhaps due to the lower expression of this protein compared to wild-type C6 or poorer detection by the antiserum. Nevertheless this protein was detected using an antibody against the HA epitope (Figure 6B), and shown to be functional in that it was capable of inhibiting IFN-\u03b2 promoter induction when expressed from a plasmid (data not shown).",

While the family members share structural similarity, their degree of amino acid similarity is low indicating they diverged long ago and although they share an ability to manipulate innate immune signalling pathways, they differ in their targets and mechanisms of action. While A46 acts at the interface between TLRs and their adaptors [56], A52 targets the more downstream signalling factors TRAF6 and IL-1 receptor associated kinase 2 (IRAK2) [57]. B14, K7 and now C6 all appear to target the kinase complexes located at the point of convergence between several different PRR signalling pathways. However, each of the viral proteins targets distinct components of these complexes. B14 binds IKK\u03b2 and thereby inhibits I\u03baB phosphorylation and NF-\u03baB activation [47]. In contrast, K7 inhibits IRF3 phosphorylation by binding to the helicase DDX3, which is part of the complexes containing TBK1 and IKK\u03b5 [58].",

They are essential for the innate immune response to several different viruses and PAMPs, and in particular for the activation of IRFs, but not NF-\u03baB, upon stimulation with Sendai virus or poly(I\u2236C) [16]\u2013[18]. The observation that the scaffold proteins are targeted by a viral immunomodulator provides additional evidence for the importance of these proteins in the antiviral response. The precise function of TANK, NAP1 and SINTBAD in the process of TBK1 and IKK\u03b5 activation has not been defined fully, but there is evidence that the adaptor proteins link the kinases to the upstream signalling pathways, possibly by interaction with TRAF3, which is a component of TLR and RLR signalling pathways [16]. The recruitment of the kinase complexes to TRAF3 would then require the scaffold proteins, and lead to the phosphorylation and activation of TBK1 and IKK\u03b5, ultimately leading to the phosphorylation of IRF3 and IRF7.

In contrast, truncated proteins containing only the TBD of either NAP1, TANK or SINTBAD inhibited all the scaffold-kinase interactions in this assay, as described previously [17]. Thus the exact mechanism whereby C6 disrupts IRF activation remains to be determined. It is possible that C6 prevents the association of the scaffold-kinase complexes with TRAF3, or else prevents the activation of TBK1 and IKK\u03b5 once the complexes are formed. Also, it is possible that the interaction between C6 and the scaffold proteins is indirect and is mediated by additional proteins that may be part of the kinase signalling complexes. Further analysis of the effect of C6 on these protein complexes may shed some light on the mechanism by which TBK1 and IKK\u03b5 are activated - and inhibited - during viral infection.",

However, despite this, the effects of K7 and C6 are evidently not duplicative, because when K7 is still expressed, loss of C6 caused a marked virus attenuation in two models of infection. Similarly, there are several VACV proteins that inhibit NF-\u03baB activation, for instance A52, A46, N1, B14. Yet deletion of any single member of this group causes virus attenuation suggesting non-redundant functions. Possible explanations for this non-redundancy might be cross talk between different pathways, so the outcome of blocking a pathway is influenced by the point at which a virus inhibitor functions to block the pathway. Alternatively, the virus proteins might have multiple functions as has been demonstrated for VACV protein N1. The need for the virus to express so many different non-redundant viral inhibitors of host signalling cascades may be due to the host innate immune system being able to partially compensate for the inhibition of an individual signalling component by using parallel pathways all ultimately leading to the induction of type I IFNs and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, the importance of one particular signalling pathway or component may vary depending on the cell type infected or stage of infection, thus requiring the inhibition of several, seemingly redundant signalling proteins. Finally, it is plausible that the inhibition exerted by a single viral protein in not complete, particularly at early stages of infection, thus requiring the expression of several different factors targeting components of the same pathway to have an additive effect.",

Also, the deletion of ORFs that encode inhibitors of the innate immune system would be predicted to make the virus more immunogenic, and thus make a more effective vaccine.
