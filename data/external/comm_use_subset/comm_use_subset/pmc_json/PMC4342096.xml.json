Mortality varied from <1% to 48% and is associated with advanced age, co-morbid conditions, and CAP severity [1]. Clear etiology is essential for the management of CAP patients [2]. Although CAP guidelines acknowledge respiratory viruses (RVs) as a \u201ccause\u201d of adults pneumonia [3], few recommendations are made regarding management, largely due to the short of data regarding prevalence and clinical severity, as most relevant data concern infants and children [4,5]. In addition, the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian influenza A (H5N1) virus, and the pandemic influenza A 2009 (pH1N1) virus has emphasized the important role of RVs as causes of CAP [6]. Thus, much better knowledge of the potential role of RVs present in adolescents and adults patients with pneumonia is needed.",

Among 94 cases, 68 (72.3%) had IFV A as the only identified pathogen, 20 (21.3%) had co-infection with bacteria, and six (6.4%) had co-infection with other RVs. Similar with other reports [18,19], the analysis of subtypes of IFV A revealed that pH1N1 virus was circulating along with sH3N2 virus, as this surveillance was carried out from the post-pandemic period of pH1N1 [20]. It has been reported that younger age and more severe respiratory compromise are key features of patients with pH1N1-associated pneumonia compared with seasonal influenza pneumonia [21]. Here, oppositely, pH1N1 infected patients were mostly distributed in patients older than 45 years, which was coincident with the findings reported by Viasus D et al. [22]. This upward shift in age distribution is probably due to a higher seropositivity against A (H1N1) pdm09 virus in young adult patients. On the other side, although IFV A infected cases distributed through all PSI groups, all cases in high risk group were determined as pH1N1 (accounting for 16.7%, p < 0.05). And 93.3% of sH3N2 positive patients were found in low risk group, without high-risk cases. Two of four dead patients were caused by pH1N1. These findings suggest that the severity of pH1N1-associated CAP is still higher [22]. Four co-infection cases of pH1N1 and H3N2 were presented with PSI I-II, the reason was unclear. Further analysis of corresponding viral load and antiviral treatment might be needed.",
