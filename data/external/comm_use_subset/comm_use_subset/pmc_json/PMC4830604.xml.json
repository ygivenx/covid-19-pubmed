            "text": "Digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) is a powerful method for nucleic acid detection and absolute quantification, in which the diluted sample and reaction components are partitioned into hundreds, or even millions, of individual, parallel reaction chambers so that each contains one or no copy of the templates [1\u20134]. After endpoint amplification, the template concentration in the original sample is determined by a Poisson statistical analysis of the number of \u201cpositive\u201d partitions (in which the amplified target is detected) versus \u201cnegative\u201d partitions (in which it is not). dPCR offers many advantages over quantitative PCR (qPCR) [5], such as absolute quantification without dependence on cycle thresholds or external references, and much higher accuracy and sensitivity [6\u20139]. Applications of dPCR span many areas of biology, including liquid biopsy [10\u201312], copy number variation analysis [13,14], rare sequence detection [15,16], gene expression analysis [5,17,18], single-cell genomics analysis [19\u201321], pathogen detection and microbiome analysis [2,22,23], as well as calibration for next-generation sequencing [24].",

However, most of the reported microfluidic chips still require a complex fabrication process, many tubes for liquid transportation, syringe pumps for pressure-driven flow, and a pneumatic system for microvalve control [36]. Current droplet-based approaches also require pumping equipment and an external rapid readout device. To ensure a homogeneous droplet size distribution, the flow rate of droplet production by T-junctions [37,38] or flow focusing [39\u201341] must be precisely controlled. Moreover, all of these dPCR methods still require thermal cycling and accurate temperature control.",

In contrast to other isothermal amplification techniques, RPA offers several important advantages for point-of-care applications: it requires a lower amplification temperature of between 25\u00b0C and 42\u00b0C, is tolerant to impure samples, amplifies targets to detectable levels more rapidly (15\u201330 min), and uses lyophilized enzymes without cold chain storage and transport [48].",

The PWA chip was manufactured from a silicon substrate and etched with 27,000 consistently sized picoliter wells. We demonstrated that sample loading using a scraping liquid blade is suitable for the PWA chip, which was simpler, faster, and resulted in less reaction dropout than droplet-based approaches. Additionally, unlike other microfluidic chips, it did not require a complex fabrication process or a pneumatic control system. Passivating the PWA chip surface using a methoxy-PEG-silane agent eliminated cross-contamination. For wide-field fluorescence imaging in situ, we creatively placed an optical cube between the chip and object lens to reduce the loss of light intensity in a conventional microscope. Not only did this ensure that the light intensity was able to excite the fluorescence signal, but it also avoided the need to obtain images by scan shooting and stitching serial small images together. Finally, we sealed the PWA chip in a homemade copper chamber filled with oil and successfully performed real-time dRPA on an isothermal incubation setup for the absolute quantification of serial dilutions of a Listeria monocytogenes gDNA stock solution.",

The scraping liquid blade was composed of a hard glass slide and a piece of soft silica gel (thickness, 3 mm), which were pasted together at an end; the chip carrier was composed of another glass slide and a 3M adhesive tape, which prevented the chip from sliding in the process of scraping (Fig 1a). The prepared 20-\u03bcL digital RPA reagents were carefully transferred onto one end of the PWA chip by a pipette. Depressing the pipette to the second stop was unsuitable for reducing the introduction of air bubbles to the chip. The blade was held at a 40\u201360\u00b0 angle relative to the chip carrier so that the edge of silica gel was placed at the end of PWA chip. The angle of the blade was adjusted slightly until visual confirmation that RPA reagents were wetting the chip. Then, in one smooth motion, the blade was dragged slowly across the chip, while a slight downward pressure was applied to dispense the reagent (Fig 1a and 1b). The scraping time was approximately 5 s. The PWA chip sat at room temperature for 20 s for residual liquid evaporation. The chip was then gently overlaid with excess mineral oil (M8410; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) via a disposable pipette until the entire surface was fully covered (Fig 1b). Mineral oil was used because it is lighter than water (0.82\u20130.88 g mL\u22121) and its solubility in water is extremely low [9]. It makes the RPA reaction independent of each other. Therefore, the subsequent packaging operation can not affect the accuracy of dRPA results, even at room temperature. The copper chamber was filled with mineral oil prior to transferring and packaging the finished PWA chip after sample loading (Fig 1c and 1d). Finally, a piece of 2.5-mm-thick quartz glass cover-plate was fixed on the copper chamber by four screws (Fig 1e and 1f). The whole process avoided air bubbles. To strengthen the air tightness between the glass and the copper chamber, a rubber O-ring was added around the chamber. The bright images of the sample loading and chip packaging process can be found in S2 Fig.",

A 12 V \u00d7 3 A fan and a custom-fabricated aluminium block were placed beneath the TEC unit to dissipate waste heat. After sample loading and chip sealing, the picoliter droplets were heated to 39\u00b0C for 20 min. The ability to perform on-chip isothermal heating was necessary for real-time observations of the entire PWA chip during RPA amplification.",

A resolution of 16 pixels per microwell can be achieved for the whole PWA chip. These were not sufficient to generate greater than 20 mW cm-2 light intensity on the entire chip area, which is necessary to excite the fluorescence signal for detection by the CCD camera. To address this problem, an optical cube was placed between the chip and object lens to shorten the path of excitation light to reach the fluorescent material. This improvement could reduce the loss of light intensity using a conventional microscope. The cube filters (Chroma Technology Corp., Bellows Fall, VT, USA) were composed of a 505-nm dichroscope, a filter set of 480/30 nm for fluorescence excitation and 535/40 nm for emission collection of the FAM dye, and were positioned 10 mm above the chip packaging device.

Native silicon is an inhibitor of PCR [70]; accordingly, the chip surface was coated with a compact 200-nm-thick silicon dioxide (SiO2) layer by thermal oxidation. However, the chip surface still absorbed polymerase protein and other reaction reagents, primarily owing to the great increase in the surface-to-volume ratio in the micro-scale environment, thus decreasing the DNA amplification efficiency. The conventional strategy involves treating the reaction chambers with 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution at 80\u00b0C for 30 min before loading the PCR reaction mix [71] or adding 1 \u03bcL of 50 mg mL\u22121 BSA solution to 20 \u03bcL of PCR master mixture as a blocking protein to occupy the adsorption sites and reduce the loss of polymerase [9].",

There may be a thin liquid film on the chip surface after scraping PRA reagents into the picoliter wells. Although it will evaporate quickly, i.e., in 10\u201330 s, before oil sealing, the precise evaporation time is unknown because it is related to environmental humidity and temperature, which vary among experiments. The DNA amplification products enter adjacent microwells by residual liquid passage; thus, many clusters of positive RPA wells appear gradually from 5 min to 10 min with cross-contamination on the non-silanization chip (Fig 3a). Passivating the PWA chip surface by a silanizing agent may effectively eliminate cross-contamination during dRPA. Methoxy-PEG-silane could produce a compact monomolecular layer on the SiO2 surface by covalent binding (Fig 2c), which can protect PCR enzymes from being adsorbed and does not interfere with PCR reactions [72]. Additionally, it is highly compatible with mineral oil for sealing and fixes water molecules by hydrogen bond interactions. Accordingly, even when minor residual liquid remains after evaporation for 20 s, it is unable to flow on the methoxy-PEG-silane surface and connect adjacent microwells. There is no cross-contamination on the silanization chip; positive wells with a single DNA template amplify independently and the fluorescence intensity for adjacent negative wells does not change (Fig 3b). Moreover, the silanization of the PWA chip is very easy to perform, unlike the complicated modifications required for OpenArray, with a hydrophilic interior surface and hydrophobic exterior surface [72].",

Thus, after dispensing the reagent effectively, there was lesser residual liquid on the surface for reducing the opportunity of cross-contamination [73]. To produce a large number of monodispersed droplets, the scraping time (~5 s) is much shorter than that of other microdroplet techniques, in which droplets are commonly produced sequentially by T-junctions or flow [37\u201341]. Current digital droplet systems take considerable time for droplet production, which leads to amplification in the bulk solution. Thus, they cannot be used to perform dRPA. In contrast, the platform presented here can be applied to many DNA amplification techniques, such as RPA, PCR, RCA, and LAMP. This sample loading style does not require pumping equipment or precise microvalve control [36].",

In contrast to previously performed dRPA reactions on the SlipChip, the PWA chip works without precise \u201cslip\u201d control [66]. If the SlipChip reduces the microwell volume and increases the density rapidly for a high-throughput detection like the PWA chip, the complexity and precision of the \u201cslip\u201d operation would increase rapidly, too. In contrast to previously performed dRPA reactions in droplets produced by centrifugal step emulsification, the droplets of the PWA chip are more consistently sized, avoiding the uneven droplets volumes affecting the quantification results, and their volumes are smaller, i.e. picoliter-sized [67]. Reagent consumption for each experiment on the PWA chip was less than 20 \u03bcL. A small reaction volume not only contributes to powerful and high-throughput detection, but also generates much less reagent waste and reduces the cost of each reaction.",

Overall dRPA-on-chip processing requires less than 30 min, which is a 4-fold decrease compared to dPCR, with a processing time of approximately 2 h. The reduced time to results is especially important for fast field analysis and critical clinical applications, such as in cases of sepsis. Furthermore, real-time analysis improves detection sensitivity because it allows the use of a reference frame to subtract background noise, which cannot be achieved with a single end-point frame.

We repeated the experiments three times at each gDNA concentration to test the robustness and reproducibility of digital RPA on the PWA chip.

As shown in Fig 6, the measured cpw with dRPA was highly concordant with the expected cpw, with an average error rate of less than 11% (N = 15). Accurate qPCR experiments can estimate original DNA concentrations with variation of less than 1 cycle number, resulting in 150\u2013200% errors in original concentration estimates [75]; accordingly, this dRPA method had better performance. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that potential pipetting errors during dilution and potential losses of DNA during sample preparation could increase the deviation between two estimates.",

Sample loading using a scraping liquid blade was simple, fast, and consumed minimal reagents (< 20 \u03bcL). Passivating the PWA chip surface by a methoxy-PEG-silane agent eliminated cross-contamination among wells. Our optical design enabled wide-field fluorescence imaging in situ, with both end-point and real-time analysis of picoliter wells in 6-cm2 areas during dRPA. We applied the PWA chip to accurately quantify serial dilutions of a L. monocytogenes gDNA stock solution. The dRPA reaction was robust and free of cross-contamination on the PWA chip, but the specificity of the device and strategies for multiplex detection remain to be examined. The digital PWA chip can be readily applied to other nucleic acid amplification techniques, such as PCR, RCA, ELISA, and LAMP.",
