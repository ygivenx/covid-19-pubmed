It spread quickly, but was successfully contained within areas of South East Queensland (Qld) and New South Wales (NSW). Although EI was not detected in other States and Territories, stringent disease control procedures were put in place across all States; which included an initial stand-still of all horse movements and subsequent controls, movement restrictions, and biosecurity requirements for many months. Colour-coded EI control zones were established within four weeks of the outbreak based on the level of disease/disease risk in Local Government Areas in NSW and Qld; these were adjusted as the disease spread, and each zone was subject to specific controls and restrictions. Controls were reviewed, revised and expanded as the disease spread, subsequent disease containment and control progressed, and policies were revised. These zones are summarized in Table 1. Further details of the outbreak, restrictions and zoning are available via the NSW Department of Primary Industries (NSW DPI) and Qld. Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries (DPI&F) websites [2,3]. Throughout the outbreak movement restrictions and biosecurity requirements remained in place, and no (or very limited) horse movement was ever allowed from higher risk zones to lower risk zones.",

The current study was conducted to gain additional complementary data to assess the impacts of EI on the social and emotional health and well-being of those affected. This paper reports data collected on non-specific psychological distress; however the full study covered many other aspects, such as adherence to biosecurity requirements, effects of social isolation due to quarantine and the consequences of restricted horse movement and related activities, and sources of support and coping during the EI outbreak.",

During these FMD outbreaks an estimated 4 million livestock were slaughtered on 9,000 farms in the UK (including many healthy animals as part of 'contiguous' or preventative culling on farms neighbouring infected farms) and 270,000 were culled in The Netherlands. The impacts on people were both economic, through financial/business/tourism-related losses, and psychological, through the exposure to loss of livestock, culling, and massive funeral pyres; the latter affecting not just farmers and their families, but also the wider population through media images on the television and in newspapers [6-8]. In the UK higher 'caseness' as indicated by the GHQ(G) was found in farmers from 'badly infected' areas, although higher psychological morbidity generally, was reported in farmers from both badly infected and unaffected areas [9].",

These authors report several aspects of relevance to the current study, including the increasing role of horses as companion animals as opposed to livestock or economic investments, and hence an increasing emotional attachment to horses; the complex and dynamic emotional relationship between farmers and their livestock; the emotional and practical implications of the animal-human relationship in disaster management, e.g. compliance with disaster management behaviours; and the impacts on veterinarians as first responders in disasters. These authors conclude that recognizing the mental health aspects of the animal-human bond is an important factor in public health approaches to disaster and can be critical in promoting the resilience of individuals and communities. Therefore, it follows that in an animal-centred disease outbreak, such as EI affecting horses, the potential disruption of the animal-human bond, and the impact of policies restricting animal-human activities could have significant implications for the mental health and resilience of those affected.",

Scores from the K10 can be related to levels of intervention, with 'very high' psychological distress scores (> 30) equating to 'caseness' for a mental disorder, and high scores are strongly associated with current diagnosis of anxiety and depression using the Composite International Diagnostics Interview (CIDI) [20]. The K10 is also able to discriminate between DSM-IV cases and non-cases, and is felt to be an appropriate screening instrument for identifying likely cases of anxiety and depression in the population providing a strong marker for a possible mental health disorder [21-23].",

This alerting service was used regularly during the EI crisis to update registrants with government support agency communications and general industry news and support information. Approximately 8,000 addressees were registered on the HECD; most were individuals, but also included were industry associations, pony clubs, and horse groups that would forward information to their own memberships nationally.

The prevalence of 'very high' psychological distress in this sample was approaching five times the level reported in recent population health data for NSW [24]. Although this prevalence is very high, and there are some methodological reasons why this may be distorted (see study limitations section) it is certainly true that many of those impacted by EI, or the threat of EI, were subject to a wide range of acute stressors over a prolonged period, in a country where EI and such rigorous disease containment and control measures were previously unknown.",

This finding suggests high levels of anticipatory anxiety. Interestingly, the risks of higher psychological distress in the purple zone (the region in NSW with the highest infection rate and earliest infections) were lower than in the red and amber areas. It is probable that during the timing of the study EI was more of a 'known' threat to those in the purple zone and there would have been some habituation to this risk; with many properties already infected or recovering, and restrictions eased due to the decision to let EI 'run its course' in this area at that time.",

Although Victoria remained EI-free throughout the crisis, those in Victoria were 1.57 times more likely to experience high psychological distress that those in the other uninfected States. There are probably a number of reasons for this effect: Victoria has a very extensive horse industry and is geographical closer to the infected States and disease-affected areas of NSW and Qld; there is also a high level of business interaction and physical movement of horses between Victoria and NSW and Qld; hence the level of proximal threat and the degree of disruption caused by disease control measures was probably experienced more widely in Victoria and may explain some of this effect.

This is interesting because in the general population psychological distress is generally found to peak around middle age (40s\u201350s). The study findings would suggest that younger people were particularly vulnerable and were coping less well with the consequences of EI. The reasons for this finding are not known, however, research literature suggests that younger people form stronger emotional attachments to animals [28], and they are also less likely to be resilient or practised, generally, when it comes to coping with adversity. From the general perspective of mental and physical health of younger people, it is interesting to consider the longer term consequences and potential burden of disease if these effects are enduring.",

As mentioned earlier, foot and mouth disease in Europe resulted in high distress and PTSD in farmers. In relation to avian influenza, most research has focussed on risk perception and compliance with protective behaviours. A large European Union project on risk perception to avian influenza in Europe and Asia found moderate levels of risk perception generally, with higher levels of risk perception noted in Europe, and in females in most countries [29]. Considering distress and risk perception in relation to human epidemics; it is likely that psychological distress would be far greater, since these present a threat to human health and possibly death. Certainly data collected during and after SARS in Hong Kong found high levels of fear and PTSD in health care workers and hospital workers [30], and high levels of emotional disturbance in the general population [31]. Research in Canada found enduring psychological distress, up to two years following SARS, among health care workers in a hospital that treated SARS patients [32].",

Firstly, the target population; those affected by EI, is a complex, disparate, and unknown population and therefore it is difficult to comment accurately on the representativeness of the sample. All horse owners in Australia are not registered on a centralized database, or otherwise controlled, and as a result, it is not possible to know how extensive the database used to access horse owners (the HECD) was. However, at a national cross-industry sector level it is believed that this was the most extensive and efficient online route to access the target population, and the use of the database as a central communication facility during the EI crisis meant that this was likely to have been a focus for those affected during the epidemic.",

The high proportion of women in the sample may be due to greater interest and participation in studies of this nature, but may also be indicative of higher levels of females in the target population, in particular in the main industry sectors represented in the data, i.e. recreational and equestrian. There are no official statistics on gender breakdown across horse industry sub-populations in Australia, but data indicate that the equestrian sector in the United States may comprise 80% women [33], so the gender bias may reflect a gender bias in the main industry sub-populations in our data. Research data often report higher levels of psychological distress in women in the general population, and therefore, the gender demographic bias in our study might have led to an elevation in the levels of psychological distress reported in this study. However, the absence of a significant gender effect in this study, and the close matching of relative levels of psychological distress in men and women with data from the Australian general population, suggests that EI, as an adversity, was exerting similar impacts on males and females. It is not possible to explain why there was an absence of a gender difference in the data. One possible explanation is that the timing of the study; around the height of the EI epidemic, and the high levels of psychological distress generally, reflected peak, acute levels in which gender differences were minimised and insignificant.",

It is probable that the study findings under-represent the responses of those in certain demographics, e.g. those who are less educated (as noted), those less affluent, and older respondents. Not all horse owners would have access to the internet, and online survey methodology is relatively uncontrolled, e.g. the sample was self-selected and therefore may be more prone to response bias than a sample that was randomly selected or otherwise controlled. Also, those experiencing higher distress may have been more motivated to respond. The extent of this response bias on the data cannot be accurately estimated, however, in anticipation of potential response bias, actions were taken to ensure that the study was presented to potential respondents in a way that would minimize such effects; e.g. the study was presented as independent of any industry group or government organization and it was clearly identified as a university research study. It was hoped that such presentation of the study would reduce political or self-interest motivation for completing the study.",

Study findings indicated that this affected population had highly elevated levels of psychological distress and that, although prevalence of high psychological distress was greater in infected EI control zones and States, elevated levels of psychological distress were experienced in horse-owners nationally, and not just in areas where equine influenza was present. Statistical analysis indicated that certain groups were more vulnerable to high psychological distress; specifically younger people, those with no formal educational qualifications, and those whose main income was linked to a horse-related industry.",

Was it the social and emotional impacts of disease control measures and restrictions, e.g. social isolation, quarantine, loss of freedom or control, stigma of being 'infected'? Was it loss of income or sporting aspirations? More importantly, how enduring is this elevated psychological distress, and what are the longer term mental or physical health consequences for those affected? The latter is of critical importance given the increased prevalence of high psychological distress reported in young people in this study. Some of these questions can be addressed using additional data collected in the wider study; however, the issue of enduring psychological distress will require further assessment.",
