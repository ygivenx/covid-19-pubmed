However, the proteins and mechanisms associated with the destruction or defense of beta cells in human type 1 diabetes have yet to be elucidated. Furthermore, to date there have been no reports of in situ protein profiling in human inflamed islets affected by type 1 diabetes (insulitis).",

We performed a proteomic analysis of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded pancreatic islet tissues of enterovirus-associated fulminant type 1 diabetes (FT1DM), a representative subtype of virus-related human type 1 diabetes in which most of the islets are affected by insulitis [7]\u2013[11]. Furthermore, we immunohistochemically validated the localization of the identified proteins in type 1 diabetic islets. An important feature of our findings was how selectively many proteins function in affected islets, including remaining islet cells and infiltrating immune cells. The catalog of profiled proteins and the protein-protein network model presented here provide new insights that will both enhance our understanding of the pathogenesis of virus-induced type 1 diabetes and facilitate development of future interventions. In addition, our LMD-LC-MS method is applicable to routine analysis of pathological specimens of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues.",

The RP-LC system (Paradigm MS4, Michrom BioResources, Auburn, CA) consisted of an L-column Micro Trap (0.3\u00d75.0 mm) and a capillary separation column (0.1\u00d7150 mm L-column Micro packed with reversed-phase L-C18 gel particles of 3 \u00b5m in diameter and 12-nm pore size [CERI, Tokyo, Japan]) fitted with an emitter tip (FortisTip, 20-\u00b5m ID and 150-\u00b5m OD with a perfluoropolymer-coated blunt end, OmniSeparo-TJ, Hyogo, Japan). An autosampler (HTC-PAL, CTC Analytics, Zwingen, Switzerland) was used to load aliquots of samples onto the trap, which then was washed with solvent A (98% distilled water with 2% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid) for concentrating peptides on the trap and desalting. Subsequently, the trap was connected in series to the analytical column and the columns were eluted for 100 min at a flow rate of 0.3 \u00b5L/min with a linear gradient from 5% solvent B (10% distilled water and 90% acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid) to 45% B, then from 45% B to 90% B over 5 min, maintaining at 90% B for 5 min, then from 90% B to 5% B over 0.01 min, followed by re-equilibration with 5% B for 9 min.",

LCP1 has been implicated in cell migration [12], [13]. Chemokine binding to the receptor results in phosphorylation of LCP1, which induces movement of the F-actin cytoskeleton to the leading edge of the T cell and subsequent activation of cellular polarization and migration of the chemokine-stimulated T lymphocytes [12], [13]. Thus, aggressive homing of activated CD8+ T cells to affected islets in response to CXCL10 chemokine stimulation in FT1DM can be explained by the increased expression of LCP1.",

Thymidine phosphorylase (TYMP) was highly expressed in CD68+ macrophages and CD8+ T cells infiltrating to FT1DM-affected islets (Figure 2I, J, K, L). TYMP is a well-known mediator induced by pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic conditions [27]\u2013[29]. However, there are no reports regarding the involvement of TYMP in islet inflammation and beta cell destruction. In many types of cancers, TYMP is expressed in the cancer cells and by infiltrating macrophages [27]. TYMP is assumed to contribute to angiogenesis by accelerating the migration of endothelial cells. Expression of TYMP is induced by many inflammatory mediators including IFN-gamma, IFN-alpha, TNF-alpha, and IL-1 beta [27], [28]. The JAK-STAT signaling pathway, probably through STAT1 (see below), mediates IFN-gamma-induced activation of macrophages/T cells and exhibits angiogenic effects, such as migration to islet cell clusters and vascular neogenesis with bleeding, which are characteristic pathological feature of FT1DM. This in turn leads to aggressive macrophages/T cell infiltration to the islets and massive destruction of beta cells. TYMP is a target of manipulation in oncology, suggesting that it could serve as a target for interventional applications of anti-cancer agents [29] to the treatment of type 1 diabetes.",

Treatment with the serpin family member alpha1-antitrypsin reduces insulitis and prevents diabetes in NOD mice [34].

Proteasomes are constitutively expressed in almost all cells and function in cleaving peptides in an ATP/ubiquitin-dependent process in a non-lysosomal pathway. PSME 1 and 2 are constituents of the immunoproteasome, which is an alternative type of proteasome that plays a central role at the interface between the innate and adaptive immune responses. Immunoproteasomes are constitutively expressed in immunity-related cells and somatic cells, including islet beta cells, after stimulation with IFN-gamma and IFN-beta [40]. The immunoproteasome degrades peptides in a ubiquitin-independent manner and is exclusively connected with the adaptive immune response and increased MHC class I antigen presentation. In addition, the immunoproteasome maintains protein homeostasis against IFN-induced oxidative stress [40]. We previously reported strong expression of IFN-gamma and IFN-beta in FT1DM-affected islet cells [11].

We detected expression in islet cells of viral replication-associated proteins typically induced by virus infection and proteins for which expression is induced by IFN-gamma. These proteins exert their major effects through the JAK-STAT1 signaling cascade, which leads to activation of innate/adaptive immunity, up-regulation of angiogenesis and anti-angiogenesis factors, and initiation of cell repair mechanisms through chaperone activity. In CD8+ T cells and CD68+ macrophages in the islets, proteins involved in cell motility and migration to target islets are over-expressed. We hypothesize that through immunological mechanisms and angiogenesis with bleeding in the pancreas, some of the identified proteins play crucial roles in the aggressive beta cell destruction that is a characteristic pathological feature of FT1DM. Other molecules we identified have antiviral, cell repair, and anti-inflammatory actions. Several proteins that may prove useful in future vaccination or chemical interventions to treat type 1 diabetes were also identified.",
