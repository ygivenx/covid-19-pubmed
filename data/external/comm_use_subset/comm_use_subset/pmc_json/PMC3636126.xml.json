            "text": "The chloroplast is an essential organelle in plants which performs photosynthesis. Chloroplast contains independent genome derived from a cyanobacterial ancestor [1]. Chloroplast genome typically consists of circular double-stranded DNA molecules of 110\u2013200 kb size, including 100\u2013200 unique genes. Most chloroplast genomes contain two large inverted repeats (IRs) of 6\u201376 kb which are highly conserved and divide the genomes into one large and one small single-copy region (called LSC and SSC, respectively) [2]. The chloroplast genomes contain important genes involved in photosystems and biosynthetic pathways. Many coding and non-coding sequences of chloroplast genomes have been used for the phylogeny analysis of plants, including: rbcL, matK and psbA-trnH[3,4]. Because of the conserved nature, appropriate size, persistent gene organization and potential ability for plant phylogenetic inference and transgenic expression, chloroplast genomes have been widely sequenced and used for the comparison and phylogeny analysis [5-7].",

The chloroplast genome database (CGDB: http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/34/suppl_1/D692.full) and GOBASE (http://gobase.bcm.umontreal.ca/) are specialized chloroplast repositories [8,9]. Dual organelle genome annotator (DOGMA: http://dogma.ccbb.utexas.edu/) is a web-based annotation tool for chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes [10]. GeneOrder (http://binf.gmu.edu:8080/GeneOrder3.0/) and BADGER (http://badger.duq.edu/manual2/models.html) can be used for comparative analysis of gene arrangements in small genomes [11]. GRAPPA (http://www.cs.unm.edu/~moret/GRAPPA/) and MGR (http://grimm.ucsd.edu/MGR/) perform phylogenetic analysis based on gene order changes [12-14]. Several tools offer the option to create chloroplast genome maps (e.g. PlasMapper, CGView and OGDRAW) [15-17]. However, there is no comprehensive platform or tool which can be used for the comparative and phylogenetic analysis of chloroplast genomes. We aim to construct a platform which integrates genome collection, visualization, comparison, phylogenetic analysis and annotation functions together. It will facilitate the comparative and phylogenetic analysis of complete chloroplast genomes.",

In the genome maps, different features were indicated by different colors, and every feature was annotated using its name. For each genome map CGAP provided five types of figures for viewing and downloading, including TIFF, PNG, JPG, GIF and PS. In order to create maps of the modified published genome, user needs to indicate the genome using its organism name or accession number, and submit a file which contains the modified items of the published genome. Every line contains one modified item which has three fields separated by comma, including FeatureName, the Start and End position. For maps of unpublished genomes, user needs to submit the annotation file of the genome. The first part of the annotation file contains the annotation items, one annotation item per line. Every annotation item has four fields separated by comma, including FeatureType, FeatureName, the Start and End position. The second part of the annotation file contains the complete genome sequence in Fasta format. Model files for test can be found from the website where it is used.",

In general, chloroplast genomes differ from each other in feature content. CGAP compared the similarities and differences of the feature content between different genomes, which was implemented based on text mining method and the annotated feature information of the genomes. CGAP also visualized the comparison results in high quality, detailed circular layout using Circos [18]. CGAP implemented two functions for the comparison of feature content, including one by one and one by more comparison. Figure 3 showed the comparison results between Pinus thunbergii [GenBank: NC_001631.1] and Porphyra purpurea [GenBank: NC_000925.1]. Figure 4 showed the comparison results of Medicago truncatula [GenBank: NC_003119.6] versus Gossypium barbadense [GenBank: NC_008641.1], Nuphar advena [GenBank: NC_008788.1], Cuscuta reflexa [GenBank: NC_009766.1], Cuscuta gronovii [GenBank: NC_009765.1], Ephedra equisetina [GenBank: NC_011954.1] and Syntrichia ruralis [GenBank: NC_012052.1]. In both Figures the internal annotations and lines between genome features indicated the same features between the genomes compared, and the external annotations indicated the different features. For both types of comparisons, you can submit your own draft genome and customize the chloroplast genomes used in your comparative analysis. For one by more comparison using only the published genomes, user needs to submit a file which contains the names of organisms or accession numbers of the genomes compared. All names are placed in the first line of the file and separated by comma. For one by more comparison using the user unpublished genome, all names are also placed in the first line and separated by comma, and the first name indicates the user unpublished genome. The second line describes the length of user genome. From the third line to the end of the file, each line contains one focused feature of the user genome. Optionally, you can supply a range of the genome, and then CGAP will compare the genomes and visualize the comparison results only on the focused range of the genome. Results of the regional comparison of genomes can be seen in Additional files 1 and 2.",

Thus, various alignment-free methods have been proposed [19,20]. CGAP used a novel sequence feature called base-base correlation (BBC) to characterize the complete chloroplast genome. BBC was first proposed by Liu et al. [21,22]. For each chloroplast genome CGAP extracted one BBC feature vector, and then calculated the distance matrix of the feature vectors using one of the ten distance methods implemented in CGAP. Finally, CGAP constructed the phylogenetic tree based on the distance matrix and neighbor-joining (NJ) method [23]. In order to compare the results of alignment-free method with traditional alignment-based method, CGAP also implemented phylogenetic analysis based on whole genome sequence alignment. The alignment of whole genome sequences was performed using MUMmer, and the distance of genomes was calculated using following formula [24].DAB=\u2212log2NmatLmax",

Then, CGAP attached biological information to the elements identified based on the information of the most similar feature [28-32]. Finally, CGAP returned you a list of non-redundant annotated entries which described the potential features on your genome. Every annotated entry for a segment sequence of your genome has 8 fields, including NormalizedFeatureName, Start, End, FeatureName or Location, LengthRatio, Identity, Score and Expectation. The meaning of each field was described in Table 1. CGAP also visualized the genome in high-quality circular map based on the annotations.",

Users can customize the comparative and phylogenetic analysis using their own unpublished genomes. To our knowledge, CGAP represents the first comprehensive platform for the comparative analysis of chloroplast genomes. It would facilitate the researches and applications of complete chloroplast genomes.",
