Pandemic viruses typically cause heightened morbidity and mortality [1]. The continued circulation of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses H5N1 has resulted in occasional coincident infections among humans. Since late 2003, when widespread H5N1 virus poultry outbreaks were reported in multiple countries in Asia, there have been 467 laboratory confirmed human cases in ten countries reported to the World Health Organization as of December 2009 with a mortality rate of about 60% [3], [4]. Global public health concerns surrounding H5N1 viruses include not only individual transmission events between infected poultry and individual humans, but also their pandemic potential, should these viruses acquire genetic changes that result in sustained human-to-human transmission. To date, several case clusters of H5N1 infections have been reported [5] and limited epidemiologic information has suggested person-to-person transmission of H5N1 in a few instances, usually involving family members. Of additional concern to both human and animal health, is the extensive geographic spread of HPAI H5N1 viruses in recent years and their isolation from multiple species of wild birds and mammals [6]\u2013[9]. Despite the recent emergence of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic [10], the pandemic threat from HPAI H5N1 viruses has not diminished [11].",

In addition to pulmonary complications, other clinical manifestations of H5N1 virus infections may include severe lymphopenia, gastrointestinal symptoms, and liver and renal dysfunction [14], [16], [17], [19], [20].

Levels of plasma macrophage attractant chemokines CXCL10 (IP-10), CXCL9 (MIG), and CCL-2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, MCP-1) and of neutrophil attractant interleukin-8 (IL-8) were substantially higher in patients with H5N1 disease compared with those experiencing seasonal influenza virus and were significantly higher in H5N1 patients who died compared with those who recovered [23], [24]. The elevation of plasma cytokine levels was positively correlated with pharyngeal viral load [23] and may simply reflect more extensive viral replication, and consequently, direct viral pathology rather than being causative of the pathology observed in H5N1-infected patients. Compared with human H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses, infection of human primary macrophage cultures in vitro with H5N1 viruses also lead to the hyper-induction of proinflammatory cytokines [25].",

Although H5N1 virus infection of humans is primarily one of the lower respiratory tract, more recent reports suggested that influenza A H5N1 may in rare, severe cases, disseminate beyond the lungs and infect brain [26], [27], intestines [20], [27] and lymphoid tissues [27], and result in extra-pulmonary clinical manifestations including encephalopathy or encephalitis [15], [28]. This extrapulmonary dissemination of HPAI H5N1 virus contrasts with seasonal influenza virus infection of humans which, even in fatal cases, is restricted to the respiratory tract. However, there have been relatively few reports describing histopathology and virus distribution in H5N1 cases [5], [16], [21], [24], [26], [27]. To better understand the pathogenesis of human H5N1 virus infection, and investigate the route of virus dissemination in vivo, we report on the use of different techniques to detect virus distribution and infection of 5 organ systems in a laboratory confirmed fatal human H5N1 virus infection, and analyze the relationship between viral load in tissues and host response. Our results suggested that the virus can infect multi-organs besides pulmonary. High viral load is associated with increased host response though the viral load is significantly difference in various organs. Cells of immunologic system could not be excluded to play a role in dissemination of the virus.",

In the digestive system, virus was isolated from tissues collected from the ileum, colon and rectum, but not the stomach, duodenum or liver. Of note, virus culture was also positive on tissues collected from brains, ureter and axillary lymph-node. Sequencing results showed that the sequences of isolates are identical. Real time RT-PCR results were consistent with the detection of virus by culture, except for the liver and spleen tissues which were positive by real time RT-PCR but negative for virus isolation. The tissue distribution of viral RNA or antigen detected by ISH and IHC stains respectively, was also generally consistent with virus isolation by culture or real time RT-PCR result. However, several exceptions were noted. There was a lack of detectable staining by either method in bronchus tissue, despite virus detection. On the other hand, both staining methods detected viral product in the kidney, although virus isolation and real time PCR were both negative.",

The relative H5N1 viral load in different tissues by determining the ratio of viral HA copy number relative to the copy number of the beta actin gene for a given tissue sample. Tissues of the respiratory system yielded higher copy number ratios than tissues from all to other organ systems with the lower left lung lobe yielding the highest viral load, overall. Interestingly, ureter tissue had the highest viral load of non respiratory system tissues. All other tissues had lower viral loads that were not. Among the digestive system tissues, the viral load in the liver was the highest (See Fig. S1). Additionally, we detected mRNA copies of macrophage attractant chemokine CXCL10 (IP-10), macrophage inflammatory protein 3\u03b2 (MIP-3\u03b2), RANTES, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u2013related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and TNF-\u03b1 in tissues of brain, respiratory organ, spleen and lymph-node. RANTES and TRAIL can be detected in all selected tissues. MIP-3\u03b2 is positive in selected tissues except right upper lobe lung with positive \u03b2-actin. IP-10 can be determined copies in cerebral context, left upper lobe lung, left lower lobe lung, right middle lobe lung, right lower lobe lung, and aortopulmonary vessel. TNF-\u03b1 can be showed copies in left upper lobe lung, left lower lobe lung, right middle lobe lung, right lower lobe lung, aortopulmonary vessel and spleen. The correlation among levels of viral load and were showed by Fig. 1. The Pearson's cross correlation analysis (See Table S1) showed that high viral load is associated with high host response figured out by proinflammatory factors (p<0.05) except TNF-\u03b1 (P>0.05), and the correlation is significant between proinflammatory factors except between TRAIL and TNF-\u03b1 (p>0.05), and between TRAIL and IP-10(p>0.05) as well.",

As influenza virus is a negative-strand RNA virus, ISH stain with sense and antisense probes detected both virus RNA (with sense probe), mRNA and cRNA(with anti-sense probe). ISH stain showed that the two sets of probes (for hemagglutinin and nucleoprotein) generated similar staining results. In the selected 24 autopsy tissue from 5 organ systems, positive staining of ISH was detected in all samples except Bronchus, stomach and duodenum. In the lung tissue samples, sense probes extensively hybridized in the nuclei of pneumocytes (Fig. 4A), whereas antisense probes hybridized in both the cytoplasm and nuclei. In all other organs with positive staining, both sense and antisense were present mainly in the cytoplasm of infected cells. In respiratory system, the positive staining was found in epithelial cell of lung (Fig. 4A), trachea and aortopulmonary vessel (fig. 4B), but was not found in bronchus. The positive staining also presented in lymphocytes of lymph-nodes (Fig. 4C), and spleen (Fig. 4D), neuron of brains (Fig. 4E), epithelial cell of intestines (Fig. 4F), epithelial cell of liver (Fig. 4G), and kidney (Fig. 4H), mononuclear cells and epithelial cell of ureter (Fig. 4I).

Our results presented that the viral antigens or viral RNA can be found in trachea, lung, brain, intestines, liver, spleen, lymph-node and kidney which were reported as same before [20], [26], [27], [30], as well as in aortopulmonary vessel and ureter which were not reported before. Notably, the virus can be found in tissues of lower gastrointestinal tract including small intestine and large intestine but in stomach and duodenum. The origin of infection in the extrapulmonary organs could be blood-borne, which is supported by previous studies showing live H5N1 virus can be isolated from the serum [20] and plasma [31]. Unfortunately, we haven't obtained blood samples to perform viral detection. However, other routes for virus dissemination in vivo, such as circulating immune cell that has been postulated to be involved in the pathogenesis of SARS [32], can not be excluded because previous in-vitro and/or in-vivo results have showed that the virus can replicate in multiple immune cells including monocyte and macrophage [25], [30], [33]\u2013[36] and T lymphocytes [37].",

The liver had the highest viral load in tissues of digestive system. Interestingly, renal duct showed a high viral load although PCR detection of kidney was negative. And viral load was high in spleen and lymphonode. Despite of the viral cells tropism, possible reasons of different viral load could include activation of low PH [38], viral receptor distribution [39], cell N-linked glycoprotein distribution [40] or other unknown mechanisms. On other hand, non-permissive or abortive infection is extra possible in some of the tissues where the virus cannot replicate effectively. Additionally, it should be possible that phagocytosis of viral antigen from pathologically significant lytic/replicative infection caused positively viral detection in these tissues.",

            "text": "High viral load is associated with increased host responses. To be different with seasonal influenza virus, the H5N1 virus caused intense transcription induction and secretion of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, as documented in human cases [15], [22], and increased induction of cytokines and chemokines has been demonstrated in H5N1-infected mice [41]. Moreover, High virulence of H5N1 virus is associated with increase with increased host responses [42]. However, the relationship between viral load and host immuno-response has never been reported. Our study suggested that the high viral load is correlated with proinflamatory factors including IP-10, RANTES, MIP-3\u03b2 and TRAIL. This finding is particularly relevant to the mechanism of H5N1 pathogenesis which is associated not only with the virus but also with the host responses. Inflammatory protein can be produced by almost any infected cells and by immune cells, including alveolar macrophages [43]. However, type II pneumocytes have a marked ability to secrete large amounts of cytokines, such as TNF-\u03b1, GM-CSF, MCP, and IL-8, in response to various insults [44], [45] and can be induced to secrete IL-1\u03b1, IL-6, RANTES, and MCP-1, in response to TNF-\u03b1 [45], [46], the last being produced by alveolar macrophages during H5N1 infection. Therefore, it is possible that the much greater cytokine induction by the H5N1 virus was as much a consequence of the response of individual, infected cells as it was a consequence of the numbers of infected cells.",

Moreover, our finding showed that viral RNA can be detected in CD3+ T lymphocytes, progenitor cells and follicular dendritic cells of spleen. The spleen is a complex organ with several functions, including the removal of senescent or aberrant red blood cells from circulation, as well as the removal of circulating pathogenic organisms [47].

The primer and probe of H5 HA gene is from the WHO-released primer sets [50]. The primers and probes of proinflammatory factors and beta-actin gene were obtained from the literature [51], [52]. The concentration of primer and probe used was 40 \u00b5M and 10 \u00b5M, respectively. The reaction was completed in a total volume of 25 \u00b5l performed by QuantiTect Probe PCR Kit (Qiagen, Germany). The reaction mixture was incubated with 5 \u00b5l DNase-treated total RNA (the template which was used to amplify \u03b2-actin gene was performed by 100-fold dilution) at the following temperature cycles. First, the reverse transcription reaction was completed by 1 cycle at 50\u00b0Cfor 30 min. Next, H5N1 HA gene, cytokine/chemokine gene and house keeping (\u03b2-actin) genes were amplified by 1 cycle at 94\u00b0C for 15 min and 45 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 15 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 30 s each. As described in previous report [53], the standard curve was generated using serial dilution of in vitro transcribed standard RNA (from \u223c10 to 107 copies). The viral load and cytokines/chemokine levels are presented as the log10 value of the ratio between copies of the target gene and \u03b2-actin gene.",

For controls, we used unrelated antibodies in place of the primary antibody. Briefly, sections were deparafinized by 2 washes in xylene and were rehydrated through decreasing concentrations of ethanol. After washing in PBS at pH 7.6 for 5 min at room temperature (RT), sections were heat-treated with antigen-retrieval solution (TRIS/EDTA buffer, pH 9, Dako, Denmark) for 10 min using microwave antigen retrieval method. After blocking with 10% normal horse serum for 10 min at RT, the sections were incubated with the specific antibody (1\u2236100) for 30 min at RT. Unbound antibody was removed by 3 washes in PBS before adding HRP-labelled polymer for 30 min at RT (Dako CSA Detection System, Denmark). After washing unbound labeled polymer in PBS 3 times, peroxidase staining in tissue sections was revealed by DAB solution (CSA Detection Systems, DAKO, Denmark). After stopping the reaction in running water, sections were counter-stained with a quick rinse in Mayer's hematoxylin solution.

Oligonucleotide DNA probes representing conserved gene regions were used. Probes were labeled by digoxigenin-UTP (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany) and tested for specificty using human biopsy of gut tissue with in vitro infection of H5N1 virus. Since H5N1 is a negative-stranded RNA virus, sense probes were defined as the probes that detect the viral RNA (negative-stranded), whereas antisense probes detected mRNA and complementary RNA (cRNA), which are both positive-stranded. Briefly, before hybridization, all solutions were prepared with DEPC-treated water. After deparaffinization and rehydration, tissue sections of 5 \u00b5m thickness were treated with proteinase K digestion for 30 min. Tissue sections were then incubated with a hybridization cocktail containing 25 \u00b5g/mL of probes at 37\u00b0C for 16\u223c18 h. All sense and antisense probes were applied separately on consecutive tissue sections. After blocking with normal horse serum (1\u2236100), sections were incubated with alkaline phosphatase-labelled digoxigenin antibody (1\u22361000, Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany) for 1 h, and the reaction products were colorised with nitroblue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-choloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Roch Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany) for 1\u20131.5 h, and counterstained in 2% nucleic fast red liquid for 1 min. As a positive control, we used human lung and gut biopsy tissues with in-vitro infection of H5N1 virus. Negative controls also included an unrelated antisense probe against the fragment of the heamaglutinin gene of the seasonal influenza virus H3N2 as well as H5N1 in-situ hybridization probes to tissues.",
