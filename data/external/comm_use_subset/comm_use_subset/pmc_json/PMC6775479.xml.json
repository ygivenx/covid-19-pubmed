            "text": "Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women in China (Chen et al., 2016). Almost all these cases result from the persistent infection of human papillomavirus (HPV) (Bosch et al., 2002). HPVs are a large viral family consisting of about 200 different types (Bernard et al., 2010). Among them, 18 types have high oncogenic properties, and these are regarded as the high-risk types, such as HPV16, HPV18, and HPV58. The high-risk types of HPV have relatively low self-clearance rate compared to the low-risk types of HPV (Safaeian et al., 2008). To prevent the infection of these high-risk HPVs and the occurrence of cervical cancer, several prophylactic vaccines, like Cervarix, Gardasil, and Gardasil 9 (Deschuyteneer et al., 2010; McCormack, 2014), have been developed and approved for marketing in many countries. However, no therapeutic vaccines or drugs have been approved for clinical use to treat HPV-infected patients.",

They are both involved in receptor binding and viral entry. Analysis of the atomic structure of native T = 7 HPV virus-like particle (VLP) reveals that 72 L1 pentamers form the icosahedral shell of HPV (Baker et al., 1991; Li et al., 2016). The L1 pentamer strongly binds to HPV receptors, such as heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), on the basement membrane to mediate viral entry and infection (Kines et al., 2009). The highly potent neutralizing antibodies elicited by HPV vaccines were found to bind to the L1 protein and prevent HPV infection (Li et al., 2018). Thus, the L1 pentamer is regarded as the most important target for development of antiviral agents against HPV infection.",

            "text": "Viral entry inhibitors represent a class of antiviral agents that inhibit virus infection by blocking virus entry into the host cells. Jiang et al. reported the first peptide-based HIV entry inhibitor, SJ-2176, in 1993 (Jiang et al., 1993) and the first HIV entry inhibitor-based anti-HIV drug, enfuvirtide, was approved by U.S. FDA for clinical use in 2003 (Dando and Perry, 2003). Later, Jiang and colleagues have reported that anhydride-modified proteins such as 3-hydroxyphthalic anhydride (3HP)-modified proteins are potent virus entry inhibitors against a number of enveloped viruses, such as HIV (Neurath et al., 1996), herpes simplex virus (HSV) (Neurath et al., 1996), and Ebola virus (EBOV) (Li et al., 2017). In 2012, Jiang\u2019s group reported that 3HP-modified bovine beta-lactoglobulin (3HP-\u03b2-LG) could also inhibit entry into the target cell of the pseudovirus (PsV) of non-enveloped virus, HPV (high-risk HPV16 and HPV18, and low-risk HPV6) (Lu et al., 2013). In the clinical trial, the topical application of vaginal gel containing 3HP-\u03b2-LG was proven to be very safe and highly effective in suppressing HPV infection and reducing viral load in vaginal mucosa (Guo et al., 2016a,b). However, we still do not understand the molecular mechanism by which 3HP-\u03b2-LG inhibits HPV infection. In this study, we found that while 3HP-\u03b2-LG could not inactivate HPV PsV, it was effective in inhibiting HPV PsV entry into the host cell via its interaction with virus, not the cell. Unlike \u03b2-LG, 3HP-\u03b2-LG could bind with L1 protein and the peptides derived from the positively charged region in the HPV L1 protein, suggesting that 3HP-\u03b2-LG inhibits HPV infection by binding, via its negatively charged region, to L1 protein, and thus competitively blocking HPV binding to the receptor on the basement membrane in vaginal mucosa, which then inhibits HPV from entering and replicating in the host cell. We have also shown that topically applied 3HP-\u03b2-LG does not enter the host cell and blood circulation. Therefore, the 3HP-\u03b2-LG-containing formulations can be safely used in vagina for treatment of HPV infection and prevention of cervical cancer development.",

The cells were suspended in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer and incubated for 24 h at 37\u00b0C with slow rotation. The lysate was cooled on ice for 5 min, mixed with 5 M NaCl solutions to adjust the concentration of NaCl to 0.85 M, and further kept on ice for 10 min. Then, the lysate was centrifuged at 5,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C, and quantified for the concentration of L1/L2 capsid protein levels. To remove aggregates, the pseudovirion stock was filtered before use for the neutralization assay. The inhibitory activity of 3HP-\u03b2-LG against HPV PsV entry into HeLa or HaCaT cells was detected as previously described (Surviladze et al., 2012; Kwak et al., 2014).

This inhibitory activity was attributed to the interaction of the increased net negative charges on \u03b2-LG after 3-hydroxyphthalic anhydride modification (Lu et al., 2013). One may ask whether all proteins with increased net negative charges can inhibit HPV entry into the target cell. To answer this question, we compared the inhibitory activity of 3HP-\u03b2-LG with that of 3-hydroxyphthalic anhydride-modified human serum albumin (3HP-HSA) and 3-hydroxyphthalic anhydride-modified chicken ovalbumin (3HP-OVA) against entry of HPV16 PsV into HeLa cells, using the unmodified \u03b2-LG, HSA, and OVA as controls. As shown in Figure 1A, 3HP-\u03b2-LG exhibited potent anti-HPV activity in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 (the half maximal inhibitory concentration) of 0.59 \u03bcg/ml, which is more potent than that of 3HP-HSA (IC50: 2.28 \u03bcg/ml). 3HP-OVA and all three unmodified proteins at the concentration as high as 10 \u03bcg/ml showed no significant inhibitory activity against HPV16 PsV entry into the target cell.

Here, we performed a time-addition assay to pinpoint the window of functional 3HP-\u03b2-LG blocking of HPV entry into the target cell.

            "text": "To confirm the functional stage of 3HP-\u03b2-LG in blocking viral entry, we used a temperature shift assay to slow down the viral infection process. At 4\u00b0C, HPV PsV could bind to cell receptors, but could not fully enter the cytoplasm because the speeds of membrane fusion and cytoskeletal transformation are largely reduced at such low temperature. We incubated HPV PsV and HeLa cells at 4\u00b0C for 12 h so that HPV could bind to the cell surface. Then we washed away the unbound HPV before shifting the cells to 37\u00b0C for further 72 h of incubation. When 3HP-\u03b2-LG was added into the cells at the beginning and then removed by washing, no viral entry occurred (Figure 3C). This proved that 3HP-\u03b2-LG blocked the attachment between PsV and cell receptor at the earliest stage of infection. To determine whether 3HP-\u03b2-LG could also bind to the receptor on the target cell surface to block HPV entry, we incubated HeLa cells with 3HP-\u03b2-LG (control: \u03b2-LG) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. The cells were washed with DMEM to remove the unbound proteins, or not washed (as control), before addition of HPV PsV. Under the washing conditions, HPV PsV entry into the HeLa cells was not blocked, while under the non-washing conditions, HPV PsV entry into the HeLa cells was effectively blocked. No inhibition was observed in the \u03b2-LG control groups, no matter whether the \u03b2-LG-treated HeLa cells were washed or not washed (Figure 3D). These results suggest that 3HP-\u03b2-LG inhibition of HPV PsV entry into HeLa cells does not result from its binding to HPV\u2019s receptor on the host cell.",

Indeed, 3HP-\u03b2-LG can also inhibit infection of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) (Wyand et al., 1999) and HSV (Neurath et al., 1996), but it is not effective against infection of MERS-CoV and VSV (unpublished data). In this study, we showed that 3HP-modified HSA (3HP-HSA) was also effective, while 3HP-modified OVA (3HP-OVA) was not effective in inhibiting HPV PsV entry (Figure 1), even though 3HP-OVA also contains high net negative charges on its surface. Thus, aside from having high net negative charges, these results suggest that the active site in 3HP-\u03b2-LG for binding to the viral protein must possess a conformation that fits with that in the corresponding site in the viral protein (Figure 6B), enabling 3HP-\u03b2-LG to strongly and closely interact with the viral protein to block HPV entry into the host cell. Indeed, the molecular docking analysis indicated that 3HP-\u03b2-LG could strongly bind to the positively charged region of HPV L1 protein, which is the binding site for the negatively charged HSPG receptor for HPV (Figure 6B). 3HP-\u03b2-LG has many more negative charges on the surface, and the interface between 3HP-\u03b2-LG and HPV-L1 is much larger than the HSPG molecule.

The newly invaded HPV accesses the basal cell layer through micro lesions or breaks in the cervical epithelium and binds to the HSPG receptor on the basement membrane through interaction between the positively charged region in L1 protein of HPV and the negatively charged region in HSPG. This interaction results in a series of conformational changes in the capsid, which leads to protease digestion of L2 and exposure of its N terminus, thus initiating entry of HPV into to the epithelial cells (Kines et al., 2009; Pyeon et al., 2009). After HPV infects the epithelial cell, it gradually matures along with the host cell cycles and moves toward the top layer of epithelia, followed by eventual release from the epidermal cells. The newly released HPV particles access the basement membrane through micro lesions of the cervical epithelium and start another infection and replication cycle, gradually establishing persistent infection and promoting the development of cervical cancer.",

These biological properties of 3HP-\u03b2-LG make it an ideal anti-HPV agent for topical application to treat HPV infection because it can interact with HPV particles on the vaginal mucosa and block the virions binding to the receptor, e.g., HSPG, on basement membrane. Since 3HP-\u03b2-LG cannot enter into the cell or the blood circulation, it is not expected to cause systemic toxicity to human or induce harmful 3HP-\u03b2-LG-specific antibodies. Therefore, the topical formulations containing 3HP-\u03b2-LG can be safely used to treat local HPV infection.",

The structures were shown as an electrostatic surface by Pymol (Alexander et al., 2011). (B) Predicted interactions between HPV L1 pentamer and 3HP-\u03b2-LG. Crystal structure of HSPG-bound HPV L1 pentamer (PDB entry: 5W1O) was shown as electrostatic surface (Dasgupta et al., 2011), and the docking structure between HPV L1 and 3HP-\u03b2-LG was generated by AutoDock (Trott and Olson, 2010). (C) Schematic illustration showing how 3HP-\u03b2-LG inhibits HPV entry and infection. The newly invaded or newly released HPV particles access the basal layer through the mucosal lesion, or breaks, and bind to the HSPG receptor on the basement membrane, resulting in the entry of HPV into and replication in mucosal epithelial cells. 3HP-\u03b2-LG can bind with HPV L1 protein, through the electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged region in 3HP-\u03b2-LG and the positively charged region in L1 protein, to block the attachment of HPV to the HSPG receptor, resulting in inhibition of HPV infection in vaginal mucosa.",
