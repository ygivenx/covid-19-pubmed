They can, however, also present with high morbidity outcomes of the lower respiratory tract including bronchiolitis, pneumonia, [1-3], asthmatic exacerbations [4] and acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [5], where human coronavirus OC43 has been shown to be the prevalent strain in several regions [6]. Given the high burden of coronaviruses to human health, and their potential for genetic recombination to give rise to the emergence of completely novel strains, the presence of antiviral strategies is paramount. However, there is currently no commercially available molecular entity which is capable of inhibiting infection with human coronaviruses [7]. The 3CLpro has been validated as an effective drug target in several studies and has even been termed \u201cthe Achilles\u2019 heel of coronaviruses\u201d [8] making it an ideal target for the identification of novel lead compounds.",

Domain III is composed of several globular \u03b1-helices and plays a role in protein dimerization, along with the N-terminal N-finger (residues 1\u20137). The active site is located in a chymotrypsin-like fold between domains I and II and contains a catalytic dyad of His41, which acts as a proton acceptor, and Cys144/5, which undergoes nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of the substrate [8,13]. The 3CLpro is so named for its close structural and sequence homology to the 3 chymotrypsin protease (3Cpro) of rhinoviruses, which contains a catalytic triad composed of His, Cys and Glu or Asp. Superimposition of the structures of 3CLpro and 3Cpro shows that the His and Cys of both proteases is almost perfectly aligned, which may explain the similar substrate specificity and catalytic mechanism [14]. The position of the Glu/Asp in 3Cpro is, however, replaced by a water molecule in 3CLpro, which shares three hydrogen bonds with surrounding residues including the catalytic dyad member His41. It is assumed that this water molecule is responsible for stabilization of the histidine in the intermediate state during enzymatic cleavage [8].",

            "text": "All coronavirus 3CLpro share a high sequence homology, as well as main chain architecture and substrate conservation [15,16]. The substrate binding site of the 3CLpro has two deeply buried S1 and S2 subsites, with shallow S1\u2019, S3 and S4 subsites with varying degrees of solvent exposure. Substrate specificity of coronavirus 3CLpro is mainly determined by the P1, P2 and P1\u2019 positions [16]. The P1 position has an absolute specificity for glutamine which stabilizes the S1 subsite via a hydrogen bond with the imidazole N\u03b52 of His162/3 and van der Waals interactions with surrounding residues of the S1 pocket. The P2 site has a preference for leucine or methionine to fill the hydrophobic S2 pocket. The sidechains of the S3 site are solvent exposed and therefore this site is expected to tolerate a wide range of functionality, but shows a preference for basic residues [17]. Sidechains and backbones of residues surrounding the S4 site create a highly congested pocket which favors a small, hydrophobic residue in the P4 position, either Ser, Thr, Val or Pro [17-19]. The S1\u2019 and S2\u2019 subsites also accommodate small residues in the P1\u2019 and P2\u2019 positions, which may include Ser, Ala or Gly [18,20]. A typical cleavage recognition site is therefore (Ser, Ala)-(Val, Thr)-Leu-Glu \u2193 (Ser, Ala, Gly), which is conserved among all coronavirus 3CLpro [21]. Theoretically, since these viruses share a highly homologous binding site and substrate conservation, it is reasonable to anticipate that broad spectrum inhibitor strategies might be successful.

The DOPE score profile of target and template (Figure 2) were nearly perfectly overlaid, indicating that the model was close to its native state. A peak in DOPE score for HKU1 3CLpro (3D23) was observed at approximately residue 50, where OC43 3CLpro showed a moderate conservation in DOPE score. Colouring the HKU1 3CLpro (3D23) structure by B-factor indicates the presence of a highly variable loop region from Ser46 to Asp53 (Figure 3). The presence of this highly variable loop structure could explain the increase in the DOPE score profile in this region and may suggest that the homology model has assumed a more stable conformation than the template. Structural alignments where the root mean square deviation (RMSD) is below 2 \u00c5 between target and template indicates that the positions of all backbone elements are correct [24,25]. Superimposition of the 3D23 template and modelled OC43 3CLpro structure displayed an RMSD of 0.327 \u00c5 suggesting a highly accurate prediction of the position of all backbone elements (Figure 4). Analysis of the overall model quality of target and template by ProSA Z-score indicated that both fall within an acceptable range for crystallographic structures with a Z-score for 3D23 of \u22127.04 and \u22127.34 for the homology model of OC43 3CLpro (Figure 5). Stereochemical analysis of phi-psi dihedral angles indicated that 91.8% of residues were in the most favoured regions with none in the disallowed regions (Figure 6).",

To ensure the modelled 3CLpro of OC43 is in its active conformation, several features can be used to differentiate between the active and inactive states. These features include the maintenance of a loop conformation of the loop connecting domain II and III and the oxyanion loop. If these features assume an alpha helical conformation it directly or indirectly leads to the collapse of the oxyanion hole and thereby forms an inactive state [26]. An alpha helix conformation of residues 186\u2013190 in the loop region between domain II and III causes a further collapse of the S2 and S4 subsites [19]. The orientation of the His163 sidechain in the S1 pocket is also vital for substrate binding [27]. This residue is largely kept in place by a stacking interaction with the benzene ring of Phe140 and imidazole ring of His163 [26]. The orientation of His172 is also stabilized by a hydrogen bond with the sidechain of Glu166. This prevents steric interactions between His172 and His163 allowing it to maintain its orientation in the S1 pocket. A hydrogen bond between His163 and Tyr161 has also been implicated in stabilizing the sidechain of His163 [27], however we could not observe the formation of this bond in the crystal structure of SARS-CoV 3CLpro (3V3M), raising the question of its importance to maintain the orientation of His162/3.",

A further two hydrogen bonds are formed between ligand carbonyls and Gly143 and Glu166 with three methyl groups inserting into the deep hydrophobic S2 pocket [12]. The conformation of 16R is almost completely conserved when bound to the 3CLpro of OC43. Notable exceptions include the shifting of the hydrogen bond formed with Gly143 to a furan ring oxygen as opposed to the carbonyl oxygen seen in SARS-CoV 3CLpro. The hydrogen bond formed with Glu166 is also absent in OC43 3CLpro, however the distance between the ligand carbonyl and backbone hydrogen is 2.75 \u00c5 and therefore this may be capable of mediating hydrogen bond formation in a dynamic system (Figure 8). Free energy of binding between 16R and SARS-CoV and OC43 3CLpro, as assessed by MM-GBSA, is -85 kcal/mol for both receptors.

Molecular dynamics of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro-16R complex are in strong agreement with the crystal data of 3V3M [12]. The simulation predicts an average of 3.17 hydrogen bonds formed over the 10 ns trajectory, with these bonds predominantly forming with Glu166, His163 and Gly143. The bond formed at Gly143 does however display the potential to form a bifurcated interaction with Asn142. As predicted by the previous results, detailed in the section describing the binding conformation, the 3CLpro-16R complex of OC43 displayed a high occupancy of 100% and 85% at both His163 and Gly143 positions respectively. These results however suggested that the bond formed with Gly143 was mediated via the furan ring oxygen, where molecular dynamic simulations indicated that this bond was formed between the carbonyl oxygen and Gly143, as seen with the crystal structure of SARS-CoV. Molecular dynamics also confirmed that the hydrogen bond at the Glu166 does not stably form in a dynamic environment and only displays the potential to form at 0-2 ns and 4-5 ns, with an overall occupancy of 21.62%.",

Ligand RMSD within the active site was approximately 0.75 \u00c5 and radius of gyration and solvent accessible surface area remained within a stable range of 3.9 \u00c5 to 4.0 \u00c5 and 4.8 nm2 to 5.4 nm2 respectively (Figure 9).

Further analysis of a previously identified lead compound, 16R, suggests that it makes extensive and stable interactions with the 3CLpro binding site of OC43. Additional analysis of the free energy of binding by MM-GBSA suggests that the ligand binds with the same affinity to the 3CLpro of OC43 as it does to SARS-CoV, a receptor it is experimentally proven to inhibit. These results are strongly suggestive that the lead compound, 16R, not only displays the potential to inhibit the 3CLpro of SARS-CoV but also that of the highly homologous OC43. In additional studies (data not shown) 16R was shown to remain stably bound to the 3CLpro of 229E and NL63 in molecular dynamic simulations and may therefore even display the potential to inhibit the 3CLpro of additional coronaviruses. 16R is therefore an excellent lead compound in the pursuit of true broad spectrum inhibitors of all coronaviruses.",

A general conservation in the pattern of respective DOPE scores was used as an indication of an accurate model. A low RMSD, as assessed by PyMOL [32], indicated structural homology between solved structure and template. The GA341 score was used to analyse fold-assignment. Z-scores, obtained from ProSA-web [33,34] were used to analyse overall model quality and to assure template and query models were in a range acceptable for structures of their respective size. A Z-score outside a range characteristic for native proteins will suggest the production of an erroneous model [33]. Stereochemical analysis of dihedral angles was then further conducted using PROCHECK [35,36] on models corresponding to the lowest DOPE score with GA341 scores amounting to 1.0. Stereochemical analysis by PROCHECK assessed residue geometry, where more than 90% of residues should be located in the \u201cmost favoured region\u201d to indicate a stereochemically favourable structure.",

Histidine protonation was assigned to the epsilon nitrogen in accordance with crystal data. A restrained minimization was then performed using the OPLS2005 force field [37,38], during which heavy atoms were restrained to remain within 0.3 \u00c5 of the original structure. To assess the conformation of the known inhibitor, 16R, when binding to the OC43 3CLpro, the experimental structure of 3V3M and OC43 3CLpro were aligned in Maestro, the interface for all Schr\u04e7dinger\u2019s software. The inhibitor, 16R, was subsequently superimposed over the OC43 3CLpro active site using coordinates present in the 3V3M crystal structure. Side chains of residues in the active pocket assuming orientations that resulted in a steric clash with the ligand were refined and the ligand was minimized with Prime [39,40] to better fit the pocket. Prime utilizes both empirically and theoretically derived constraints to predict and replicate the dynamic motion of protein sidechains, allowing for conformational changes that arise through the \u201cinduced-fit\u201d phenomenon, which is often neglected in molecular docking screens.",

All input hydrogens in the coordinate file were ignored and were assigned according to the force field. Histidine protonation states were assigned to the epsilon nitrogen in the neutral form in accordance with crystallographic data. The ligand, in the previously predicted pose, was prepared by SwisParam [41]. The protein-ligand complex was then placed in the centre of a solvated, cubic box, 1 nm from the box edge. The system was solvated with the spc216 water model and sodium counter ions were added to neutralize the system. The system was energy minimized by a brief dynamics simulation using Steepest Descent Minimization until steepest descent converged to Fmax < 1000. Long range electrostatic interactions were calculated with the Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) method [42] with a cutoff of 1 nm and periodic boundary conditions were applied. Both NVT and NPT equilibrations were run for 50 000 steps or 100 ps using a 2 fs time step and a leap-frog integrator. All bonds were constrained by the lincs algorithm. PME was again used for long range electrostatics with a 0.16 fourier spacing. Short range electrostatic and van der Waals cutoffs were 1.0 nm and 1.4 nm respectively. Coordinates, velocities and energies were saved every 0.2 ps. During NVT equilibration temperature coupling was achieved by V-rescale algorithm with a target temperature of 300 K. Pressure coupling during NPT equilibration was achieved via the Parrinello-Rahman algorithm and is incorporated in the NPT equilibration once temperature is stable to ensure the proper density is reached (approximately 1000 kg/m3). Following NVT and NPT system equilibration an unrestrained, 10 ns simulation (5 000 000 steps) was run with the leap frog integrator, saving coordinates, velocities and energies every 2 ps. All other parameters were maintained from the NVT and NPT equilibration including both temperature and pressure coupling.",
