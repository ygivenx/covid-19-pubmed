Emergency containment and preventive measures required hospitals to cancel most clinics and operative procedures [16-18]. At the University Health Network (UHN) in Toronto, rigorous surveillance measures were instituted, and hospital access was restricted to single entrance points for staff and patients. Visits to the hospital were limited or prohibited. Working closely with public health authorities to maximize the impact of these measures, affected hospitals established Command Centres to prevent the spread of infection and provide information to staff and the public [19]. Whenever appropriate, hospital staff with no direct clinical responsibilities were encouraged to work remotely. Websites and Internet-based messaging systems were implemented to notify staff about policies and procedures instituted to contain the outbreak [20]. Telephone-based call centres made thousands of calls per day to alert patients about changes in clinic schedules and to provide nonurgent medical advice and prescription refills.",

Considering that most Canadians have access to the Internet [21], it could be argued that the Internet may have the potential to facilitate information flow between hospitals and many of their patients during a crisis, complementing or replacing other means of communication. To our knowledge, no studies have explored patients\u2019 views with regard to the use of the Internet as a complementary or alternative form of communication during an epidemic. This study was designed to explore these views and the specific Internet-based services patients would like to have available in the event of a future outbreak.",

The e1000 survey [23] is a longitudinal study that has gathered cross-sectional data twice (January 2001 and April 2002) in seven ambulatory clinics. For this study, we continued assessing patients\u2019 patterns of Internet use for general and health-related purposes, adding questions regarding their opinions about services they would like to receive through the Internet in the event of hospital closure, clinic postponement, or procedure cancellation due to an outbreak. Respondents could also suggest other uses for the Internet in a health-related context. Additionally, the survey examined the influence of patients\u2019 demographics (ie, gender, age, level of education completed, first language, and country of birth) on awareness and use of the Internet in general and on seeking health-related information in particular. The Command Centre recommended that the survey should not take more than 3 minutes\u2014much shorter than initially planned\u2014in order to avoid congestion in the screening lineups by the entrance doors (Figure 1).",

These results are related only to the proportion of patients using the Internet for general and health purposes. Earlier iterations indicate that 60% of respondents have used the Internet for general purposes and 69% for retrieving health information [23]. During SARS, the proportion of UHN patients using the Internet was higher (69%). This increase may be due to a combination of factors (timing of the survey, higher awareness and adoption, chance) and not necessarily due to the epidemic. Previous results showed that three of every four patients wanted to use email and websites as means of communication with health providers. This result is comparable with the one obtained during the SARS outbreak (75%). Consistent with previous results, patients more likely to be aware of and use the Internet were younger, more educated, and spoke English as their first language [23]. Unlike our previous surveys, the current one shows that older patients (> 60 years) were more likely to be interested in communicating about nonurgent matters with health professionals than their younger counterparts (41 to 60 years). This may be due to a combination of increased familiarity with the Internet over the previous two years in a population that faces chronic conditions and the realization that some face-to-face meetings may be replaced with online alternatives [26].",
