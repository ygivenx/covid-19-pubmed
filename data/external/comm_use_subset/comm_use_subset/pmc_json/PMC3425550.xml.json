Mosquitoes transmitting DENV in humans has been a major cause of dengue diseases in tropical and subtropical counties; approximately one-third of the world's population is at risk of the infection. People infected with DENV typically show self-limited febrile dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). Life-threatening dengue shock syndrome (DSS) is more likely to occur after a second DENV infection [1], [2]. Other than supportive treatments, no specific therapy is available for dengue-related diseases. Several tetravalent DENV vaccine candidates are under development, but an effective, safe and affordable dengue vaccine remains elusive [3].",

Particularly, the mononuclear phagocyte lineage of macrophages, monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) and skin Langerhans cells are the primary cell targets [4], [5], [6]. Similar cellular tropism of macrophages and DCs was observed in the experimental DENV mouse infection model [7]. Macrophages and DCs are the most crucial cell types in innate immunity and rapidly produce type I interferons (IFNs) and cytokines to fight against microbe invasion. Type I IFNs are potent inhibitors of virus replication. Therefore, many pathogenic viruses have developed strategies to escape the IFN-triggered anti-viral effects. More than 170 different virus-encoded IFN antagonists from 93 distinct viruses have been described [8]. For example, hepatitis C virus (HCV), a member of Flaviviridae, evades innate immunity by cleaving mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein, an IFN stimulator, with its protease NS3/4A [9]. The nonstructural proteins NS4B of DENV-2, West Nile virus (WNV), and yellow fever virus (YFV) block the activation of STAT1 in cells stimulated with type I IFN [10], [11].",

However, JEV induced higher activation of IRF3 and NF-\u03baB than DENV-2 in human A549 cells [12]. Furthermore, type I IFN production triggered by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) stimulation was blocked in DENV-2-infected human DCs [13], [14]. Microarray results from rhesus macaques also indicated that type I IFN, interleukin 10 (IL-10), IL-8, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) were not upregulated with DENV-1 infection [15]. Therefore, DENV-2 might modulate the induction pathway of type I IFN and other cytokines.",

Different TLRs recognize the different molecular patterns of microorganisms; for example, TLR4 recognizes lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and TLR3 recognizes dsRNA. Engagement of TLRs with their ligands triggers signal cascades to activate IRFs and NF-\u03baB, thus leading to production of cytokines and type I IFN [17]. NF-\u03baB activation is crucial for cytokine induction, and many viruses evolve various strategies to manipulate NF-\u03baB signaling [18], [19]. Several RNA virus-encoded proteins, such as HCV NS5B, SARS CoV M protein, measles virus V protein, and enterovirus 71 2C, inhibit NF-\u03baB activation directly or indirectly [20], [21], [22], [23].",

The TLR3 ligand polyI:C and the TLR9 ligand CpG greatly stimulated the mRNA expression of IFN-\u03b2 (124-fold induction at 2 h by polyI:C and 531-fold induction at 6 h by CpG), IL-10 (77-fold at 12 h by polyI:C and 74-fold at 36 h by CpG), IL-12p40 (381-fold at 24 h by polyI:C and 1551-fold at 6 h by CpG), and TNF\u03b1 (64-fold at 2 h by polyI:C and 180-fold at 6 h by CpG) (Figure 1A\u2013D, left panels). However, levels of IFN-\u03b2 and these cytokines were much lower in cells with DENV-2 infection (Figure 1, left and right panels): especially, IL-10 was not induced by DENV-2 infection. The kinetic of DENV-2 replication in BMDCs was measured by qPCR with primers specific for DENV-2 5\u2032-UTR (Figure 1E) and by immunofluorescence staining with antibody specific against DENV-2 NS3 (Figure 1F). DENV-2 replication peaked around 12\u201324 h post infection, in consistence with cytokine induction peaked around 12\u201336 h post infection. Therefore, infection with DENV-2 inefficiently triggered type I IFN expression and that of other cytokines. Since DENV-2 infection would produce intracellular viral RNA to turn on RLR and TLR signaling cascades for cytokine production, weak induction of DENV-2 for these cytokine genes (Figure 1) implies that DENV-2 may interfere with a common signaling pathway for inducing type I IFN and other inflammatory cytokines.",

In our infection system, two strains of DENV-2, PL046 and NGC, triggered low degree of NF\u03baB p65 nuclear translocation. Nuclear staining of p65 was noted in 7% and 13% of PL046- and NGC-infected cells, respectively (Figure S2A panels b and c); in contrast, about 80% of the control virus infected cells showed nuclear staining of NF-\u03baB p65 (Figure S2A, panel d). Thus, we checked whether DENV-2 could suppress NF-\u03baB activation triggered by TLRs engagement. With use of a NF-\u03baB-dependent luciferase reporter, NF-\u03baB activation stimulated by the TLR ligands LPS and polyI:C was readily blocked in DENV-2-infected cells at 12 and 24 h post stimulation (Figure 3A). Immunoblotting result of DENV-2 NS3 indicated that the virus was replicating in A549 cells and was not affected by LPS and polyI:C posttreatment (Figure 3B). As well, DENV-2 infection blocked LPS-triggered NF-\u03baB activation in Vero cells as measured by nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB p65 (Figure 4A); similar results were also observed in J774A.1 macrophages (Figure S2B). Nuclear translocation of NF-kB p65 was slightly increased in A549 cells up to 60 h post DENV-2 infection, but the polyI:C-triggered p65 nuclear translocation was greatly blocked in DENV-2 infected cells (Figure S2C). We also tested the influence of TLR singling in DENV-2 replication, polyI:C pretreatment blocked DENV-2 replication; whereas, the antiviral effect of polyI:C was not seen in cells with established DENV-2 infection (Figure 4B). This data is consistent with previous report [30] and suggest that DENV-2 inhibits TLR signaling to benefit its replication. DENV-2 replication in these two cell lines, A549 and Vero, was confirmed by qPCR with viral 5\u2032 UTR primers and plaque assay for virion production (Figure S3). Thus, DENV-2 downregulates TLR-activated NF-\u03baB, which leads to reduced cytokine expression.",

The incidence of DHF/DSS is higher in people with previous exposure to different serotypes of DENV, and antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) may be a mechanism for DHF/DSS [1]. Enhancing antibodies may increase viral entry and increase the number of infected cells. DENV infection via the ADE route has also been shown to downregulate several genes of the innate immunity system, resulting in suppression of the innate response and increase of DENV replication [35], [36], [37]. In this study, we further demonstrate that DENV per se is a weak cytokine inducer because IL-10, IL-12, and TNF\u03b1 were induced to a lower extent in DENV-2-infected BMDCs. Furthermore, even in the absence of enhancing antibody, DENV could block NF-\u03baB activation and cytokine induction triggered by TLR signaling. Downregulation of the cytokine system may provide a growth advantage for DENV to propagate in host macrophages and DCs.",

            "text": "IL-10 is a potent immunosuppressor produced by several immune cells [38], and its expression can be triggered by TLR [31], [32]. IL-10 is critical in suppressing excessive inflammation and immunopathologic conditions caused by the host immune system responding to infections [39], [40]. DHF patients showed high serum levels of IL-10, which may be involved in the pathogenesis of severe dengue disease [41], [42]. In a WNV animal infection model, IL-10 downregulated T cell-mediated immunity and had a negative role in antiviral immunity [43]. Thus, our findings that DENV-2 failed to induce IL-10 expression in BMDCs (Figure 1) are unexpected but are consistent with previous reports that IL-10 is not produced from mature human CD1a+ DCs infected with DENV-2 [44], [45] and that microarray data from DENV-1-infected rhesus macaques showed no transcription of IL-10 or other cytokine genes [15]. In addition, we found that DENV-2 could inhibit TLR-triggered IL-10 expression. Therefore, the high IL-10 expression found in patients with dengue-related diseases might not be simply stimulated by the DENV itself. Instead, it may be resulted from uncontrolled DENV replication, which then triggers increased levels of immune activation and increased IL-10 production. DENV infection through the ADE route often induces IL-10 expression, which worsens the host anti-viral system and results in increased DENV production [35], [37], [45]. Thus, DENV infection via ADE or non-ADE routes might have different effects in the immune system.",

            "text": "TLR signaling cascades are mainly controlled by the MyD88-dependent and TRIF-dependent pathways, which both lead to activation of NF-\u03baB and mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) [17], [46]. NF-\u03baB and MAPKs have been suggested to have critical roles in cytokine induction [47], [48]. A recent study showed that constitutive intestinal NF-\u03baB activation does not lead to destructive inflammation unless accompanied by activation of MAPKs such as p38 and ERK [49]. Our results that DENV-2 blocked activation of NF-\u03baB, as well as ERK1/2, support our findings of cytokine production hampered in DENV-2-infected cells. Because both NF\u03baB and ERK1/2 were affected, DENV may suppress an upstream molecular event such as TLR gene expression, as that has been reported for DENV infection through an ADE route [37]. We also detected TLR genes expression in DENV-2 infected J774A.1 macrophages and found that polyI:C-triggered TLR4, TLR5 and TLR13 expression was significantly downregulated by DENV-2 (Figure S4, panels a\u2013c), but not for that of TRL6, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR2 (Figure S4, panels d\u2013g). In contrast, DENV-2 enhanced the gene expression of TLR1 and TLR3 triggered by polyI:C stimulation (Figure S4, panels h\u2013i), suggesting that DENV-2 may modulate certain TLR genes expression in macrophage. Other possibilities, such as whether DENV protease, found to block IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation [13], may target common molecules involved in type I IFN and cytokine production in TLR signaling, or whether ISG15 that is induced by DENV-2 and functions as an inhibitor of type I IFN production [50] may also contribute to immune evasion, remain to be further studied.",

However, one of the strain ARA6894 did not show such kind of inhibition effect, as ARA6894-infected DCs triggered CD4+ Th1 polarization with high expression of IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1. Interestingly, the polyprotein sequences of strain ARA6894 contain nonsynonymous amino acids that are not present in other DENV-2 strains such as PL046, 16681 and NGC [55], suggesting that different impacts on DC's function between these DENV-2 strains might be due to viral genome diversity.",

(B) A549 cells were infected with DENV-2 for 24 h (panels a and d), or treated with polyI:C (2 \u00b5g) by transfection for 24 h prior to DENV-2 infection (panels b and e) or 24 h post DENV-2 infection (panels c and f). DENV-2 infection was monitored by IFA with anti-DENV-2 NS3 antibody (green fluorescence) and the cell nuclei were counter stained by DAPI (blue fluorescence).",
