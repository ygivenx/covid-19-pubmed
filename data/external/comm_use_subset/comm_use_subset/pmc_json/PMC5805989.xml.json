In general, individuals who have high connectivity are considered to be at elevated risk of infection and of passing infection on [2], and control interventions which target those individuals are often efficient, particularly for sexually transmitted infections. It is an open question as to whether such an approach is feasible for respiratory infections, and the link between social connectivity and infection risk for respiratory infection has only recently received research attention [3,4].",

A few smaller studies have measured encounter patterns of individuals over multiple days, but are generally limited to 2 day samples, and have focused on quantifying differences between school-term and holidays for schoolchildren [5], and contrasting days of wellness and illness [6]. Longer studies of encounter patterns have so far been conducted in small and potentially non-representative sample [7\u20139]. There is, therefore, a need to understand how stable or consistent the mixing behaviour of individuals is over longer periods of time, for determining both the reliability of information gained from single day studies and for the ability to identify and target individuals at high risk of infection. The most appropriate measure of contact rate is also unclear. Both the number of different individuals encountered and the time spent with them are important for transmission, but it is unclear how they may combine with exposure to infectious individuals to generate infection risk. Consequently, several studies of contact mixing patterns report the total number of contacts and estimate the total contact duration [10,11].",

            "text": "Between-individual variation in the rate at which contact occurs is known to have important implications for the transmission of infectious diseases and its control [12]. Daily differences in the behaviour of an individual can also impact transmission, particularly if triggered by illness [13,14]. For many acute infectious diseases that are spread through close contact, infectious individuals can pose a transmission risk for several consecutive days until the infection is cleared or treated. This may be particularly important for influenza, where individuals may be infectious prior to symptoms developing [15]. The set of people such individuals may encounter during this infectious period defines their effective neighbourhood of contacts\u2014the totality of people they could potentially infect [16]. In other words, the speed and extent to which infection can transmit may be determined by how quickly contacts are made and how the number of people encountered may accumulate during the infectious period. The number of different people encountered by an individual may asymptote as the number of days considered increases [7]. This saturating relationship may reduce the final variation between individuals' effective neighbourhood size, such that variation in the number of secondary infections arising may not be as great as estimated by information from a single day, particularly for infections with long (multiple day) infectious periods. Currently, there is little evidence as to how individuals\u2019 contact rates may change over time [3,7,17]. Understanding how effective neighbourhood size may vary in different populations and for different infections has import implications for public health control, including the effort that should be invested in contact tracing during outbreaks.",

This connectivity is reflected in its significance for infectious diseases: SARS emerged in the region and spread to the rest of the world through Hong Kong [18]. Annual seasonal influenza is also thought to originate in the region [19]. A previous survey of social mixing behaviour was conducted in Hong Kong to examine how social connectivity related to incidence of influenza infection during the 2009 pandemic influenza [20,21]. Here, we present an extension of that work: a longitudinal study of the social mixing behaviour of Hong Kong residents, where participants reported on the social encounters they made on up to four different days over 17 months. Using the information collected by the study, we explore the patterns and variation in three key contact rates\u2014the number of people encountered (number of contacts), the total duration of contact events and the number of different locations in which contacts are reported.",

Firstly, we fitted an exponential model to the observed distribution of categorized durations recorded for all contacts using an adaptation of the expectation\u2013maximization algorithm. Secondly, drawing randomly from this model, we assigned durations (minutes) to each contact event reported. Thirdly, we repeated this process 200 times, to permit estimation of uncertainty in derived duration metrics. Finally, the total contact duration was found by summing the estimated contact durations for each contact event, for each participant for each day they reported.

Model fitting was performed using information from participants with two or more observations and implemented within the R statistical language [24] using the gamm4 package [25]. Random effects were modelled as participant-specific intercepts. Explanatory variables included age at interview date and sex, study wave (R1 to R4, to test for temporal effects), and the day of reporting (to understand the effect of different days of the week). For models with number of contacts and total duration as response variables, we also included the number of contact locations reported (categorized as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 or more) as an additional explanatory variable, to understand the contribution of multiple locations to contact rates. We fitted penalized thin-plate splines to explore the potential for nonlinear relationships of the explanatory variables with age at interview date in decimal years (i.e. measuring age as number of months). Percentage contributions for each of the covariates were calculated by predicting the relevant contact rate as a percentage of the predicted modelled rate for a comparator set of covariate values; we used a 50-year-old male, reporting contacts on a Monday in the first study wave, with a household size of one and with a single contact location as the comparator. Additional supporting regression models were fitted for alternative response variables and exploratory variables: these models are described within the electronic supplementary material (appendices F and H).",

We found broadly similar patterns of mixing between age categories across the four study waves (figure 3; electronic supplementary material, table S4 and figures S3 and S4), though there are some differences which may be important when considering the potential spread of infections. All age groups, except the 20\u201339 and 40\u201364 groups in wave 4, were significantly more likely to have a greater number of contacts with a member of their own age group than would be expected if mixing were at random across all four waves: this is indicative of age-assortative mixing. The strongest assortative mixing rates were made by younger (5\u201319 years old) and older (65+) participants: these individuals were, respectively, at least 3.4 and 1.9 times as likely to have contact with individuals of their own age than would be expected by proportionate mixing, in study waves 1 to 3 (figure 3). In comparison, wave 4 showed reduced assortative mixing of the younger age group (5\u201319 years old). This may be due to more sampled days within this wave coinciding with the summer school holidays than for other waves. This explanation is supported by an observed reduction in the average number of contacts made in school by this age group in wave 4 (electronic supplementary material, table S5). From an infectious disease perspective, wave-to-wave differences in assortative mixing do translate into differences in epidemic growth rates, with wave 2 having the fastest growth (electronic supplementary material, figure S5, appendix E). Similar average aggregate age mixing patterns were observed for skin-on-skin touch contacts (electronic supplementary material, table S6), which may be a more appropriate representation of a transmission opportunity for particular diseases [7,28].\n",

We found no association of number school/work contacts with contact locations greater than 1 or study wave. The number of contact made in other settings, which included leisure and shopping activities, was associated with age: the number of contacts in these settings decreased with age up to 30 years, and then increased with increasing age (electronic supplementary material, table S7 and figure S7). Females made more contacts in these settings than males, and more of these contacts were made at weekends; there was no effect of study wave. There was a very large effect of number of contact locations with these types of contact, suggesting that this type of contact may be responsible for the relationship with total number of contacts as the response variable. The number and proportion of contacts made in different social settings varied by study wave (electronic supplementary material, table S5).",

A similar distribution of variance was observed for total contact duration (28.6% between and 71.4% within individuals) and number of locations (25.9% between and 74.1 within individuals). When we limited our study observations to only those where participants reported \u2018typical\u2019 days, we found between variation to increase slightly, but still less than within individuals (electronic supplementary material, table S8). Similar patterns were found for models of number of contacts in different social settings (electronic supplementary material, table S8). Finally, to further explore wave-to-wave variation in individuals' contact rates, we considered how likely individuals were to report a consistent number of contacts across study waves, by calculating the percentage of participants remaining in the same contact quantile as the number of quantiles increased (electronic supplementary material, figure S10). Only between 30% and 40% of participants had consistent contact rates in the range of quantiles we explored, though we consistently found a greater proportion of participants\u2019 observations remained in their quantile than for a null model which excluded within-participant dependencies.",

We explored changes in the variation of cumulative contact rates over multiple study waves (electronic supplementary material, figure S11). While nearly all measures of between-participant variation decreased with increasing number of study waves, in many cases we found the variation to be greater than that expected by a null model which excludes within-participant dependencies. Thus, there was evidence that contact rates saturate to some extent (particularly for contact duration and number of locations), though within-individual variation is still sizable.

The distribution of contact number reported as individuals was consistent across waves, though there was more variability between waves for contacts reported as groups (electronic supplementary material, figure S13). We also fitted independent regression models following the method of that described for the total number of contacts, with two different response variables: the number of contacts reported as individuals or groups (electronic supplementary material, figure S14). These models present similar results to the combined contact model, though associations deviate for several of the variables, most notably the relationship with number of locations and study wave. Whether a contact is reported as an individual or part of a group is the choice of the participant, and participants tended to use groups for reporting large number of contacts. These deviations from the principle model likely reflect differences between participants, and encounters between waves, and may also reflect participants tending to reporting groups more often for as they grew accustomed to participating in the study.",

These aggregate contact patterns were similar to those observed in other studies based on European and Chinese populations [10,11,26,27,30], and a recent study of Hong Kong residents [31]. However, large representative studies of contact patterns have so far been limited to cross-sectional observations of behaviour over a single day per participant. Our findings suggest that this is an appropriate methodology when the objective of the study is to provide aggregate measures of contact patterns (e.g. contact rate per age group or age assortativity patterns) for modelling purposes. If the objective is to parametrize individual-based models or more finely resolved group-structured models; however, our findings suggest it may be important to incorporate individual-level variation in contact rate and social mixing behaviour.",

Individuals who visit more locations accrued a greater number of contacts, while contact duration quickly asymptotes with location number.

Individuals may visit many locations and make a correspondingly large number of contacts, but overall tend to spend less time per contact. This suggests an intriguing interplay between the spatial roaming of individuals and their network of social encounters in environments not easily represented by demographic and occupational-derived models, presenting a complex challenge in representing social or transmission networks within geographical space, and in developing realistic models of infectious disease transmission.",

While our study suggests that the number of contacts made by individuals is variable on a day-to-day basis, we find that the variation in contact rate reduces little when we consider the accumulation of contacts over multiple days. Our analysis is limited to only four observations per participant and our methodology does not permit unique contacts to be identified between waves. Nonetheless, these results suggest that inter-individual variation in the number or people encountered, the time spent in contact with them, and the variety of locations they are encountered in, may not saturate as quickly as expected over longer infectious periods. Our analysis does not explore the potential source of the intra- and inter-individual variation, and a deeper exploration of the setting and reasons for the contacts reported by participants may prove illuminating from both sociological modelling and public health perspectives.",

A further limitation is that as our study was conducted across several waves spanning several months, we do not have contact behaviour information from participants from consecutive days. A consequence of the telephone study team not working on weekends, and the random assignment of contact reporting days to participants meant that lower numbers of contact days were recorded for Saturdays and Sundays. The bias in sampling of different days of the week is, therefore, a consequence of our study design; the principal aim through sampling was to recruit a representative sample of households and individuals therein, and representativeness for day of the week was secondary in our sampling aims. Weather conditions may have a confounding effect on the contact patterns we have observed [32] and we did not adjust for these in our analysis. Finally, due to the design of data collection, we cannot identify repeated contact made between a participant and the same individual (their contact), which limits our ability to fully identify any neighbourhood saturation effect.",
