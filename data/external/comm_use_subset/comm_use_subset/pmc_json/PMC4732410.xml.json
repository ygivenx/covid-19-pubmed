            "text": "The earliest disseminating vaccine for animals was designed to target two highly lethal rabbit-specific EIDs in the European rabbit population, myxoma virus (MV) and rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV).[21] The vaccine was based on a naturally attenuated MV strain (strain 6918) selected for low virulence (non-lethality), high immunogenicity, and maintenance of horizontal transmission.[22] MV6918 is essentially identical to the highly pathogenic wild-type strain except for disruption of four genes, two of which are known virulence factors.[23] MV6918 was able to protect against lethal MV challenge following vaccination using direct inoculation. Importantly, MV6918 was transmitted to >50% of co-housed rabbits (assessed by sero-conversion), and immunity conferred by transmission was protective.[22] Onward transmission was less efficient (approx. 12%) and was no longer protective. MV1698 was subsequently engineered to express RHDV capsid protein as a transmissible bi-valent vaccine against both RHD and myxomatosis.[21,22] Under laboratory conditions, the MV6918VP60-T2 bivalent vaccine was shown to exhibit similar characteristics to MV6918. Direct inoculation was immunogenic and protective in essentially all animals with >50% transmission from directly inoculated to co-housed rabbits and a substantial drop in onward transmission.[21] MV6918VP60-T2 was shown to perform in a remarkably comparable fashion in a limited field trial performed on an island with an estimated population of 300 wild European rabbits with the vaccine showing maintained avirulence, high immunogenicity following direct inoculation and >50% transmission rate.[24]",

            "text": "In the above studies, MV was selected as the genetic basis for the disseminating vaccine due its ability to spread through rabbit populations. High species specificity of MV for rabbits also decreased the potential for spread to \u2018off-species\u2019 targets within the environment. However, use of a normally virulent pathogen for the host species being targeted as the self-disseminating vaccine platform necessarily required use of an attenuated MV strain. This requirement had a clear impact on the disseminating capacity of the MV6918-based vaccine. More recent self-disseminating vaccine approaches have used cytomegalovirus (CMV), which is a beta-herpesvirus, as the disseminating vaccine platform. Similar to MV, CMVs are immunogenic and spread efficiently through their host species.[25\u201327] However, CMV infection is normally benign in the healthy host. This important difference removes the need to use attenuated strains, thereby potentially enabling use of wild-type CMVs with preserved animal-to-animal transmission characteristics. Similar to MV, CMVs are also highly species-restricted with each mammalian host species studied carrying its own CMV.[25] The species barrier for CMV appears remarkably robust, with direct experimental inoculation being unable to establish off-species infection even between closely related rhesus and cynomolgous macaque CMVs (90% identical at the nucleotide level).[28] A recent study showed this strict species restriction to extend to CMVs in the wild, with the absence of cross-species CMV transmission even between chimpanzees and monkey prey species involved in an intimate NHP predator\u2013prey relationship in the Tai Forest National Park, Cote d\u2019Ivore.[29] CMVs are also ubiquitous within their host species,[25] which allows vaccines to be engineered from CMV strains already endemic within the target species. This helps remove concerns associated with introduction of new viruses into animal populations with which there is no long established biological relationship.",

            "text": "Although not targeting an EID, over a decade of work toward the use of a murine CMV (MCMV) as a viral vectored immunocontraceptive vaccine to control mouse plagues in Australia gives some insight into the application of disseminating vaccines to target high risk pathogens for EID control. Mice directly infected with MCMV strains expressing female mouse fertility antigens develop prolonged \u2013 essentially life-long \u2013 infertility.[30] Immunocontraception was dependent on antibody production and led to the ablation of ovarian follicles.[31,32] Despite the success of MCMV as an injectable vaccine, lack of direct transmission to uninfected mice under laboratory conditions has been a hurdle to its further development. Transgene expression by MCMV is frequently associated with salivary gland attenuation (a major organ involved in animal-to-animal transmission of CMV). However, even low passaged, non-genetically manipulated wild-type strains of MCMV transmit poorly under laboratory conditions.[32] Therefore, it is not clear if poor transmission of vaccine strains is due to genetic manipulation of the virus and/or reflects a general lack of viral transmission under laboratory conditions. It is possible that the inability to transmit under laboratory conditions may be due to transmission characteristics unique to rodent CMVs. Similar to the situation with MCMV in mice,[33] transmission of Sin Nombre hantavirus (SNV) in deer mice could not be demonstrated under standard laboratory conditions. However, efficient transmission was observed following co-housing in outdoor enclosures and correlated with the number of aggressive encounters enumerated by the number of biting wounds.[34]",

            "text": "The first studies using CMV as a disseminating vaccine targeting a human EID used CMV from deer mice (Peromyscus CMV (PCMV)) to target SNV in the wild deer mouse SNV transmission species. Using a PCMV expressing the SNV envelope glycoprotein G1, the PCMV(\u0394P33:G1EGFP) vaccine induced G1-specific antibodies following direct inoculation of deer mice.[35] PCMV(\u0394P33:G1EGFP)-induced immunity was durable, persisting over a 12-month period,[36] but was associated with a lower level of PCMV-specific antibodies compared to the wild-type PCMV.[35,36] An observed delay in replication in vitro combined with the lower anti-PCMV antibody levels suggested a level of attenuation. However, PCMV(\u0394P33:G1EGFP) was still able to induce G1-specific immunity in healthy deer mice previously infected with either PCMV(\u0394P33:G1EGFP) or wild-type PCMV.[35,36] This ability of CMV to re-infect the CMV seropositive host is a characteristic shared by other CMVs, and is critical for use of this virus as a disseminating vaccine platform due to CMVs being ubiquitous within their mammalian hosts.[37] The ability of PCMV(\u0394P33:G1EGFP) to transmit G1-specific immunity in co-housed mice, or to protect against SNV challenge has not been determined. However, these studies further suggest the importance of using a non-attenuated virus-based vaccine platform with wild-type characteristics, which is possible with CMV given its benign nature in the healthy host.",

            "text": "A disseminating CMV-based approach is also being developed toward the control of Ebola virus in wildlife reservoir and transmission species in Africa.[38,39] Approximately 30% of past human Ebola virus outbreaks are known to have resulted from the direct handling of infected ape carcasses,[40] identifying apes as a critical wildlife Ebola virus transmission species. Ebola virus is also regarded as a major threat to the survival of African ape populations in the wild.[41] Consequently, a disseminating CMV-based strategy is being developed as part of an ongoing multidisciplinary effort between human health scientists and the conservationists at the World Wildlife Fund to target Ebola virus infection in African great apes (bonobo, chimpanzee and gorilla) and potentially also fruit bats. Fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) are also a known reservoir of Marburg virus [42]; a disseminating vaccine platform targeted at bat roosts may also therefore be suitable to interrupt transmission of this related filovirus. A recent series of studies have shown that a CMV-based vaccine is able to provide protection against Ebola virus challenge following direct inoculation.[38,39] In these studies, a MCMV vector expressing a CD8 + T cell epitope from nucleoprotein (NP) of Ebola virus fused to a non-essential MCMV protein (MCMV/ZEBOV-NPCTL) was shown to induce durable NP-specific immunity (>14 months).[38,39] MCMV/ZEBOV-NPCTL vaccinated mice showed no evidence of Ebola virus disease (EVD) following lethal Ebola virus challenge. Impressively, 5/8 mice completely controlled Ebola virus infection, with no detectable viremia; the remaining 3 mice showed a 2.8 log reduction in viremia relative to non-vaccinated controls. Protection was long-lived as mice vaccinated with a single dose of MCMV/ZEBOV-NPCTL were protected against EVD following lethal challenge 17 weeks post-vaccination \u2013 an attractive quality for a disseminating vaccine to be used in wildlife populations. Studies in the NHP Ebola virus challenge model were recently completed (manuscript under review). In this model, the key question of transmissibility of immunity in CMV seropositive animals (which cannot be assessed in the laboratory mouse model (see above)) can now be addressed in an experimental system more translatable to NHPs in the wild.",

A 2008 study examining HCMV seropositive women showed the frequent presence of multiple glycoprotein N (gN) and/or gB variants within HCMV positive urine and blood samples suggesting that most individuals are infected with multiple HCMV strains.[43] A subsequent study monitoring development of HCMV strain-specific antibody responses in a cohort of healthy seropositive women reported 29% of participants developed new strain-specific antibodies with a mean time of 17.8 months (\u00b1 10.3 months) indicating that superinfection is a relatively common event.[44] Superinfection of CMV seropositive NHPs has been demonstrated experimentally in the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV):rhesus macaque AIDS model following direct inoculation of recombinant rhesus CMV (RhCMV) genetically modified to express SIV antigens.[45] Following superinfection, recombinant RhCMVs were able to establish a persistent long-term infection and induced CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses against the expressed SIV antigen comparable to those observed in RhCMV seronegative animals.[45] This ability to induce a robust T-cell response against the \u2018new\u2019 heterologous antigen encoded by the RhCMV vector in the presence of prior CMV immunity is notable [46] as it suggests that \u2018original antigenic sin\u2019 \u2013 a phenomenon first observed for influenza A-specific antibodies,[47] and then for virus-specific T-cell responses in the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus mouse model,[48] whereby the presence of pre-existing immunity blunts the immune response against a new but cross-reactive antigen \u2013 may not apply in this situation. However, the effect on more closely antigenically related heterologous target antigens within the context of CMV infection will need to be determined.",

Interestingly, following recovery of the CD8+ T-cell response in these animals, the US2-11 deleted viruses were able to persist, which indicates that once established, the host CD8+ T-cell response is unable to clear virus infection. Outside of the MCMV mouse model (see above), the ability of recombinant CMVs to spread between animals has not been tested. However, a recent study investigating transmission of RhCMV in co-housed animals showed that non-recombinant, but tissue culture-passaged RhCMV strains maintain an ability to be shed into bodily fluids (saliva and urine) at levels comparable to those of wild-type RhCMV, provided that a region of the genome encoding several genes involved in tropism and immune evasion (called the UL/b\u2019 region) is intact.[50] CMV transmission is generally believed to involve mucosal exposure to such fluids (as well as genital secretions and breast milk).[25] Consistent with their maintained shedding characteristics, the tissue culture-passaged viruses also retained the ability to spread between co-housed RhCMV-seropositive animals. This observation indicates that it is at least possible for laboratory manipulated CMV strains to maintain the ability for wild-type transmission.",

Experience from studies exploring the use of disseminating vaccines targeting other pathogens (see above) are expected to prove invaluable for these studies, especially in regard to the importance of avoiding vaccine attenuation to maintain wild-type characteristics of CMV transmissibility. Where studied, frequencies of CMV infection from natural transmission in animal populations approach 100%. Consistent with epidemiological studies in humans, a major peak of infection occurs at an early host age, with essentially all US primate center rhesus macaques being RhCMV seropositive by the age of one year.[37] Environmental stresses, such as SIV infection of chimpanzees, can result in immune suppression of animals in the wild.[51] It will therefore also be important to ensure that any CMV-based vaccine presents no higher risk in immune-compromised animals than the wild-type CMV strains with which they are already infected.",

Recent history also tells us that these pathogens will probably have never been seen before. The 2014/2015 Ebola virus outbreak shows the difference healthcare infrastructure can have on human-to-human transmission of EIDs. Until the time when overall healthcare infrastructure in all countries has been raised to a level that enables identification and control of high-risk EIDs at source, we as a global community will be fated to reactive responses to EID outbreaks. Innovative strategies are therefore urgently required to identify and then pre-emptively control EIDs in these under-resourced \u2018hotspot\u2019 regions. Self-disseminating vaccination is one innovative approach that may potentially overcome the problems associated with use of conventional vaccines for pre-emptive pathogen control in \u2018high-value\u2019 animal populations within these challenging environments. Although still in relatively early stages, the nascent field of self-disseminating transmissible vaccines has the potential to solve many current intractable public health and conservation problems that cannot be addressed by conventional vaccines (Table 1).\n",

However, the initial poor adaptation of many emerging zoonotic pathogens may provide a window of opportunity during the initial, stuttering transmission phase into humans enabling the nascent EID to be targeted within its animal host at a stage when it is still amenable to control. Following such pathogen identification, a self-disseminating vaccine platform provides one means to pre-emptively control the emerging pathogen. Adaptation of new technologies such as CRISPR/Cas9 will also greatly increase the ease and speed with which these new vaccine vectors can be constructed following identification of a target pathogen.[53] The next five years has the potential to place us in the position of being able to achieve high vaccine coverage against \u2018nascent\u2019 zoonotic pathogens in animal species involved in transmission that are otherwise inaccessible to conventional vaccination.

The increasing rate of EID incidence can be directly linked to human activity.Current funding paradigms often focus on wealthy countries rather than developing countries which contain geographic EID \u2018hotspots\u2019. This funding paradigm leaves the world ill-prepared to detect and then control these diseases.Targeting zoonotic pathogens in wildlife populations by vaccination is a potentially powerful method for reducing transmission of EIDs. Direct vaccination of these animals may be hampered by a number of obstacles, including: poor infrastructure to support necessary cold chains, inaccessibility of animal species, inhospitable terrain and cost.Vaccines capable of self-dissemination may overcome many of the hurdles faced by direct administration of conventional vaccines. Self-disseminating vaccines will need to display species specificity, immunogenicity and normal transmission dynamics. Cytomegalovirus (CMV)-based viral vectors potentially fulfill many of these requirements, including being native to and endemic in target animal species.\u2018Proof of concept\u2019 studies using direct inoculation of CMV-based vaccine vectors have been performed for viral pathogens such as Sin Nombre hantavirus and Ebola virus. CMV-based vaccine vectors have also been used for successful \u2018proof of concept\u2019 of viral vectored immunocontraception.Production of CMV-based vaccines with proven capacity to transmit is the next step in the development of self-disseminating vaccines.\n\n",
