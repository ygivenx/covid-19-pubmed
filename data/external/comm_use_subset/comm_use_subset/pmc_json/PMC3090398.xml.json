Our first prototype\nof this platform uses loop-mediated amplification (LAMP) [21] as the model for an isothermal\namplification technique and malaria as a model diagnostic target. The amplification\nprotocol requires incubating the reaction mixture at \u223c65\u00b0C for at least 60\nminutes. This temperature requirement is sufficiently flexible that small excursions\n(+/\u22121.5\u00b0C) around this target are tolerable. [22]\u2013[26] LAMP (and several other\nisothermal techniques) have been shown to far less sensitive to inhibitors than PCR,\nto the point where direct assay of whole blood and other unpurified specimens is\nfeasible.[18],\n[19] In those\ncases, no power or instruments are required for NA purification, as is the case with\nPCR. In addition, recent advances in protein stabilization make it likely that the\nreagents can be dried-down in the reaction tubes with sufficient stability to avoid\nthe need for a cold-chain during delivery and storage. Thus, another power consuming\n\u201cinstrument\u201d is eliminated. We have not yet attempted to package all of\nthese features and advances into a single prototype device; however, the successful\ndemonstration of electricity-free temperature-controlled heating in a disposable\nformat reported here is an important first step toward the long-term goal.",

In this\nembodiment a standard PCR tube can be the reaction chamber and could be used\nlater as a cuvette for fluorometric analysis to resolve the presence of\namplicons. This would free the user from the high power requirements of\nelectrical heating but would still require some sort of detection instrument or\ndevice with its attendant requirements. One could also imagine how a properly\ntuned, stand-alone heater unit could be applicable to any field analytical or\npreparative method that requires a constant heat source; e.g., cell lysis or\ntemperature-responsive polymer mediated concentration. More compelling is the\npotential of the NINA heater as the core component of a stand-alone assay kit,\ncapable of providing a result without external electrical power, a reader\ninstrument, or any complex ancillaries. Such a device might include the NINA\nheater, reaction chambers containing lyophilized reagents, sample metering\ndevices, a readout chamber or lateral flow strip for visible interrogation, and\nan LED \u201cpenlight\u201d for fluorescence excitation (if required). We\nenvisage versions of the kit that are fully disposable (for high-value\napplications in developed countries such as for home testing and for\nfirst-responder biothreat detection) and partially reusable (primarily for LRS\nuse). Most of the components necessary to create such a NINA kit already exist.\nWe are currently working to combine them into a field-ready, instrument- and\nelectricity-free, sample-to-result, molecular diagnostic test system (Figure\nS1).",

To keep the isothermal device within the\ntemperature band required for LAMP, the reaction chambers were surrounded with\nan engineered fat-based compound with a high specific heat capacity and specific\nmelting range centered around 65\u00b0C (Renewable Alternatives, Inc., Columbia,\nMO, USA). While several prototype heater designs have been explored, the\noptimized heater uses an off-the-shelf insulated food storage container (a\n\u201cthermos\u201d) to provide an insulated housing with two chambers (Figure 5). The bottom chamber\ncontains the exothermic reaction, and the upper chamber contains the EPCM and\nreaction wells. To facilitate directed heat transfer to the reaction wells, an\naluminum \u201choneycomb\u201d material (Plascore, Inc., Zeeland, MI, USA) was\nadded to the upper chamber prior to introduction of the EPCM. The machined\nreaction wells, sized to closely fit a standard 200-\u00b5L PCR tube, are\nembedded in the EPCM. Three reaction wells were used for most prototypes (one\nfor a positive control, one for a negative control, and one for an unknown\nspecimen); however, the existing prototype could easily be modified to accept\nseveral times this number without significant loss of performance, based on the\navailable space in the EPCM and first principles of heat transfer. An\ninexpensive spring timer (manufacturer's suggested retail price\n[MSRP] \u224810 US$) with an audible \u201cready\u201d\nindicator was affixed to the lid of the heater unit for added electricity-free\nfunctionality.",
