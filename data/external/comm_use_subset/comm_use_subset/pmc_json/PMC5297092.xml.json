About 214 million (range 149\u2013303 million) new cases of malaria occurred worldwide in 2015 [2]. Now, an ambitious new goal has been set by the World Health Organization (WHO) to reduce the global malaria burden by 90% by 2030 [1], and to eliminate malaria by 2030, as well as to eliminate falciparum malaria by 2025 in all countries of Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS) [3]. Malaria is closely correlated between any two countries such as China and Myanmar along their common border [4, 5]. Control and elimination of malaria are challenged by diversity and complexity of the determinants in the GMS [6, 7], especially on the international border [6, 7]. Malaria movement across international borders is one of the major obstacles to malaria elimination [8\u201310].",

A combination of clinical symptoms and results of presumptive treatment with anti-malarial drugs were some of the definitions for malaria cases at that time. In the study, annual malaria incidence (AMI) was used to replace annual parasite incidence as the outcome variable, so the AMI included both microscopy confirmed cases and cured cases by presumptive treatment. The amount and impact of intervention activities were described for each stage in the process from hyperendemicity to elimination, although the quantitative relationship between AMI and intervention activities was not done because of unavailability of sequential data. In linear regression analysis, independent variables for social and economic development were national GDP in billions of China Yuan (CNY) and urbanization rate (%). In Hekou County, banana growing is major part of the economy, which has changed the environment in terms of malaria transmission. Transition from paddy field to banana plantation reduces breeding sites for mosquito larvae, and insecticides used in growing bananas kills mosquitoes. In this reason, BPA (hectares) was used as an independent variable for environmental changes (Fig. 2). In order to obtain a more normal distribution of data, all outcome and independent variables were transformed into common logarithms, and then a linear regression analysis was used to analyse relationships of AMI respectively with GDP, urbanization rate, and BPA from 1952 to 2013 [20]. The number of malaria cases during 2014\u20132015 was zero, so data of the 2 years could not be taken into the analysis model. The rapid development of society and economy has improved health information system and reduced the data bias from 2000 to 2015, so the analysis model was conducted for years 2000\u20132013 again. In order to learn the impact of socio-economic development and environmental change, a bilinear regression analysis was conducted to on AMI association with national GDP and BPA, and with urbanization rate and BPA for years 2000\u20132013 [20].\n",

In 1939, Yunnan Commission of Malaria Control and six Provincial Institutes for Malaria Control (PIMC) were established in the Province, and PIMC 6 was allocated in Hekou County. PIMC 6 organized outreach teams visiting communities to treat malaria, promote use of bed nets, and treat mosquito larvae breeding sites with emerald green (copper acetoarsenit).

One VMCW was in charge of five to ten households to administer drugs and spray insecticides. Malaria investigation and control activities were initiated in the winter of 1952. Two treatment methods were utilized: (1) presumptive treatment was given to people with enlarged spleens and malaria attack episodes in prior 6 months; (2) intermittent preventive treatment (IPT), once a week, was administered to others. Methods for vector control were treatment of larval breeding sites with insecticides in the low-transmission dry season from December to April, and indoor residual spraying (IRS) in the high-transmission rainy season from May to November; in addition, community mobilization was conducted for environmental management. During those years of low supplies, drugs and insecticides were used as long as they were available. Occasionally obtainable drugs were quinacrine hydrochloride, quinine sulfate, paludrine and/or plasmoquine. Obtainable insecticides were dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) or hexachlorocyolohexane (C6H6C6). These interventions reduced AMI from 358.62 per 1000 person-years (89.32% Plasmodium falciparum of cases) in 1953 to 5.69 per 1000 person-years in 1960 (Table 1; Fig. 3).\n",

The system conducted vector control and parasite treatment regularly, and radical cure treatment in low-transmission seasons.

When a malaria epidemic broke out in 1987: AMI increased to 34.41 per 1000 person-years and five malaria-related deaths in the year; Honghe Prefecture had the highest number of malaria cases among 17 prefectures in Yunnan Province. Ultimately, deterioration of the malaria situation brought a political will to malaria control. Hehong Prefecture Government invested enough funding for anti-malarial drugs and insecticides. Additionally, artemisinin was registered in China in 1986. Introduction of artemisinin saved the life in control of the epidemic, and then oral and injective artemisinin monotherapy was recommended as the first line drugs for treatment of P. falciprum malaria and artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACTs) as the second line treatment in China. By 2002, AMI was lowered to fewer than one per 1000 person-years (Table 1; Fig. 3).",

In the context of shortage of armamentarium, medicine and human resources, the effective collaboration between military and civil medicine sectors set up an effective system for malaria prevention and treatment in a short time, which reduced malaria burden significantly (Fig. 3). Importantly, the system of malaria control expanded into a primary health care system (PHCS). Similarly, malaria elimination in Sri Lanka documented the importance of political will for malaria control. Strong governmental commitment eliminated malaria in this underdeveloped country [21].",

With the collapse of RCMS financing, many barefoot doctors created private practices, charging patients for service and selling drugs [25, 26]. Accumulative impact of economic reforms contributed to the malaria epidemic in 1987. The epidemic and increasing malaria incidence attracted the attention of local government to invest for drugs and insecticides. However, financing and personnel problems in healthcare were not solved until after the epidemic of SARS in 2003. The epidemic of SARS urged a strong commitment from central government to public health, including financing and coordinating a national malaria control and elimination programme.

In spite of facing challenges today, such as resistance of anti-malarial drugs and insecticides [2], and the difficulty of finding a radical cure of vivax malaria [27], enough intervention could be effective. When five of the six GMS countries (all except China) reported artemisinin resistance of P. falciparum [28], the high coverage of intervention dramatically reduced the malaria burden [9], while drug sensitivity of malaria parasites has not changed significantly along the China-Myanmar border [29, 30].",

One of the major obstacles to achieving malaria elimination is movement across international borders. Strengthening surveillance activities for rapid identification of importation or re-introduction of malaria is essential to address the movement of malaria [10]. During American and Vietnam conflict from 1955 to 1975, China gave a full support to Vietnam for malaria control. The collaboration might contribute a stable malaria situation in Hekou County in the time. In 2010, collaboration and information exchange mechanism, including annual meeting, routine information exchange, migrant management was again established between China Hekou County and Vietnam Lao Cai Province for border malaria surveillance and control (Table 1) [31]. That overall incidence of malaria is low in Vietnam, where the most affected are the central and south central hilly and mountainous areas, and malaria transmission is interrupted in northern provinces [32, 33], would also benefit malaria elimination of Hekou County on the China\u2013Vietnam border.",

The close relationship between AMI and NGDP and NUR documented that facilitated malaria elimination in Hekou (Table 2; Fig. 4). Growth of GDP provided assurance of financial investment for malaria control and urbanization. Increasing production has been changing the biophysical environment. Increasing banana-growing areas reduce mosquito-breeding sites, and the use of insecticides kills mosquitoes directly. This is showed by the strong correlation between the AMI and BPA, especially during 2000\u20132013 when the BPA were increasing rapidly (Table 2; Fig. 4). Results of bilinear regression analysis indicate that socio-economic development and biophysical environment changes are associated with reduction of burden and elimination of malaria, as well as interventions, in Hekou County (Table 2; Fig. 4).",

Firstly, data of individual interventions and associated reduction of the malaria burden are not available, population level figures and qualitative descriptions are used as replacements. The results on malaria burden before 1951 was descriptive and were based on fragmentary descriptions. Similar limitation is that an ecological study existed in the study that was not able to prove impact given the lack of a control [35], only suggestive evidences can be provided. Secondly, from 1966 to 1986, malaria cases might have been under-reported, so that the true malaria situation cannot be documented (Table 1; Fig. 3). Thirdly, although the single and bilinear regression analysis documents that socio-economic development and environmental change contributes to reduced malaria burden and elimination, it cannot be used to document quantitative contributions from control interventions because of lack of sequential data of interventions. Fourthly, annually sequential data of GDP and urbanization for Hekou County are not available, so the national and provincial data are used for the linear regression analysis. However, Hekou is an underdeveloped border county in China so that investments from upper government, such as national and provincial governments, are the main resource for regional socio-economic development as well as malaria control. From this view, the national and provincial data for the analysis would work equally as the data from the county level.",

First, political commitment and governmental executive ability are pivotal for malaria control and elimination. Under strong governmental commitment many socio-economic constraints (such as financial and human resources) could be overcome and healthcare systems can be strengthened. Second, national health orientations and policies can dramatically affect efficacy and interventions of malaria control. Third, integration of primary healthcare together with malaria control contributes to sustainability of effective malaria control and surveillance. Fourth, high coverage of malaria intervention and population access to the intervention is crucial at any stage of malaria control and elimination. Fifth, malaria incidence is affected by socio-economic development, biophysical environment change, and malaria situation of neighbouring countries or regions. Multifaceted factors, including political commitment, effective interventions, socio-economic development, and changing biophysical environment work together for the elimination of malaria in Hekou (Additional file 1).",
