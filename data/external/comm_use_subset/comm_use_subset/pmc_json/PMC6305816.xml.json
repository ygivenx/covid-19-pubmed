The MS2 is a single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) virus with positive-sense strand and icosahedral capsid, which belongs to the Leviviridae family. Its genomic size is nearly 3.6 kb, which encodes four proteins, including coat protein, maturase protein (A-protein), lysis protein, and replicase protein[6]. The MS2 attaches to the fertility factor (F) on the E. coli and enters the bacteria using maturase protein. After entering the bacteria, the viral RNA acts as messenger RNA and translates into structural proteins. In the MS2 assembling stage, one molecule of viral +ssRNA, one copy of the maturase protein (A-protein), and 180 copies of coat (14 kDa) protein are required[7].",

There are a number of methods, such as in vitro transcription, for producing positive RNA as an internal or external control in PCR assay[17]. RNA molecules are unstable in hard conditions such as high pH and high temperatures. In addition, RNA is easily degraded in the presence of divalent cations. Moreover, RNase is abundant in the environment; even minor contamination makes the RNA molecule extremely vulnerable[18]. Therefore, the synthesis of RNA and improvement of its stability are very important for the nucleic-acid-based assays. In the past decade, AR RNA technology has been developed to improve the stability of RNAs, used as standard or control in clinical diagnostic assays. Based on the use of AR RNA technology, target RNA was synthesized in E. coli by transformed plasmid and assembled along with the phage genome in the MS2 capsid; these PLPs contain the target sequence and are resistant to ribonuclease enzyme. The aim of current study is the constructing the positive-control RNA based on AR RNA technology, using HIV-1 RNA as a model.",

We also have shown the durability of AR RNA in the presence of ribonuclease enzyme.

The AR RNA was stable after treatment with DNase I and RNase A; this result is similar to other previous studies[14,24]. In another study, a part of the HIV-1 virus genome was packed in the MS2 phage capsid, and the PLPs were assembled based on AR RNA technology. Moreover, in a study by Burchard et al.[25], the cyber green dye was used to perform PCR reaction, but in the present study, we used the TaqMan method that is more specific than dsDNA-binding dye. Furthermore, in other studies[26], MS2 phage was used as an internal control for monitoring the cDNA synthesis steps in clinical specimen and nucleic acid preparation process, including lysis of the pathogen. In addition, the AR RNA was challenged by ribounuclease enzyme, and the stability of AR RNA was compared with naked RNA. The results of current study indicated that the stability of AR RNA in the presence of ribonuclease enzyme and durability of AR RNA and naked RNA was similar to previous studies[27,28]. In the current study, PLP standard was prepared and used as a positive control in real-time RT-PCR. The duplicate of real-time RT-PCR assay had high sensitivity, and the LoD of the channel (FAM) was 101 copies/\u00b5l of AR RNA, indicating a constantly high amplification efficiency (>99%).",
