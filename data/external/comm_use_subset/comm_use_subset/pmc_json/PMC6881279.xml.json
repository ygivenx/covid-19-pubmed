The present global upsurge in outbreaks of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases has necessitated the search for reservoirs of zoonoses of public health importance in order to develop resilient response strategies.",

Surveillance and discovery programs of EIDs in wildlife have identified rodents and shrews as natural reservoirs of diverse RNA viruses such as hantaviruses, arenaviruses, astroviruses, picornaviruses, paramyxoviruses, etc. (Klempa et al., 2006; Meheretu et al., 2012; Firth et al., 2014; Hu et al., 2014; Sasaki et al., 2014; Gryseels et al., 2015; Gouy de Bellocq et al., 2016; T\u011b\u0161\u00edkov\u00e1 et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017). It is believed that these viruses establish themselves in their hosts through co-evolution and are maintained in nature by both vertical and horizontal transmissions (Streicker, 2013). Spillover events into humans and livestock result from encounters with these small mammals whose presence around human dwellings is on the rise either as pests or as food (Bonwitt et al., 2016). Evidently this poses a potential threat to public health and it is imperative that pathogen surveillance and discovery programs are implemented on high risk wildlife groups including rodents and shrews.",

Expansion in agricultural activities among other anthropogenic factors encourages encroachment into wildlife habitats and amplifies the frequency of human contacts with these animals and pathogens carried by them (Young et al., 2017). However, there is currently no documentation of viruses harbored by rodents and shrews in Kenya yet they have been sighted and trapped around human dwellings. Also, there could be a possibility of misdiagnosis and underreporting of human infections with rodent-borne viruses in the country. These gaps justify the need to investigate and characterize the diversity of viruses in rodents and shrews and quantify the possible impact of these viruses on public health in Kenya. It was against this backdrop that we carried out this study, in which both wild and peridomestic species of these animals around and within agro-ecological zones near human habitations were sampled and screened for a variety of RNA viral families. This work thus constitutes the first virus surveillance study in Kenyan rodents and shrews, and provides baseline data for understanding the distribution, genetic diversity, as well as potential spillover risk of RNA viruses circulating in small mammals in Kenya.",

Each location provides unique ecotype in a high human density neighborhood with intensive large and small scale farming practices indicating high probability of human contacts with rodents and shrews. Line transects were established in homes (compound, kitchens, and stores), farms, and natural habitats (bushes and forests) between August and September, 2016. In every transect, a combination of peanut butter with oat meal as well as fish was used as bait in 20\u201350 Sherman and Museum Special traps.",

PCR assays utilizing the Platinum Taq DNA polymerase kit (Invitrogen) were applied to screen the presence of following RNA viruses: hantaviruses (Klempa et al., 2006), arenaviruses (Li et al., 2015), coronaviruses (Watanabe et al., 2010), paramyxoviruses (Tong et al., 2008), astroviruses (Chu et al., 2008), hepeviruses (Drexler et al., 2012), picornaviruses (Lau et al., 2011), and flaviviruses (Moureau et al., 2007). The information of primers used in PCR testing of different viral families are presented in Table 1. Hantaviruses, arenaviruses, and flaviviruses were screened using kidney, liver, lung, and spleen tissues. Feces were tested for astroviruses, coronaviruses, paramyxoviruses, and picornaviruses which are known to infect gastrointestinal tract. Liver tissues were tested for hepeviruses as liver is the major target tissue for hepatitis E virus infection. Since paramyxoviruses can be secreted in urine, we also screened kidney and the nine urine samples for paramyxovirus RNA. Identities of positive host species were confirmed by sequencing of mitochondrial Cyt b gene, recommended for species identification (Bowen et al., 1997). Nucleotide sequences of products with expected amplicon sizes were determined by Sanger sequencing. Sequences were aligned with representative members of relevant family using ClustalW. Phylogenetic inference of each alignment was done in MEGA version 7.0, using the maximum-likelihood (ML) approach and the Tamura\u2013Nei model with a bootstrap of 1000 replicates (Hall, 2013).",

The genome end sequence was amplified through the SMARTer\u00ae RACE 5\u2032/3\u2032 Kit (Takara). The recovered genome sequence was used for ORF prediction and aligned with those of representative members of mammarenavirus using ClustalW. Pairwise sequence similarities of the L/S segments and ORFs of the novel arenavirus to other mammarenaviruses were calculated using DNAstar. Phylogenetic inference of the aligned homologs of the four ORFs was done in MEGA version 7.0, using the ML approach and the Tamura\u2013Nei model with a bootstrap of 1000 replicates.",

Although with large diversity, the phylogeny of mammalian astroviruses shows grouping with host restriction, in which most of rodent astroviruses fall into one big clade and are further clustered by rat, mice, and vole host species (Mombo et al., 2019). In this study, we detected two different novel astroviruses in fecal samples from Kenya corresponding to two different species R. rattus and M. natalensis, which tend to be species specific.

This finding indicates the potential cross-species infection of astroviruses between cats and rodents. Feline astrovirus infects felids including domestic cats and cheetahs, and has been worldwide reported (Atkins et al., 2009). However, viruses detected in different geographical locations and in different felid species are closely related, suggesting that feline astrovirus has existed and evolved in cats for long history. Hence, the infection of feline astrovirus in C. gamnianus from Kenya was more likely to result from the cross-species transmission from cats to rodents. The C. gambianus individual in this study was captured in a farm store where this rodent has a high likelihood of interactions with domestic cats. However, as the virus was detected in feces of the rodent, there also existed the possibility that the C. gambianus ingested foods contaminated by domestic cats. The virus passed intact through its gastrointestinal tract, but did not actually infect the rodent.",

In this study, we present diverse novel paramyxoviruses found in rodents from Kenya, all of which cluster within the genus Jeilongvirus. Within these large clade, the phylogenetic clustering of most Kenyan paramyxoviruses showed host specificity, as different viruses are grouped separately with those from the same rodent species or genus described in other African countries. For example, two viruses from L. aquilus constitute a lineage with another Lophuromys paramyxovirus from Mozambique. Five viruses from four rodent species in Kenya detected in our study showed distinction from each other, as well as from previously reported ones, further expanding the genetic diversity of jeilongviruses. The results provide additional support for recognition of rodents as the important natural reservoir of this paramyxovirus genus.",

Hepeviruses which infect humans can cause self-limiting acute hepatitis in immune competent individuals (Smith et al., 2014). All mammalian and avian HEV isolates belong to the genus Orthohepevirus, and can be divided into four species. The species Orthohepevirus A consists of HEV variants detected in human populations worldwide and those from pigs, wild boars, camels, some of which can be transmitted to humans and cause zoonotic diseases. The species Orthohepevirus C is composed of two genotypes with host restriction. All HEVs identified from rodent hosts are designated genotype C1, while genotype C2 includes isolates derived from ferrets (Smith et al., 2014). We discovered a novel HEV within genotype C1 from a R. rattus in Kenya, further suggesting the global distribution of Orthohepevirus C variants. Previous studies revealed that HEVs detected in Asian musk shrew (Suncus murinus) from different regions of China were closely related to rat HEVs and fell within HEV-C1 genotype. As those shrews always share the same environment with wild rats, they may carry rat HEVs as a result of the cross species transmission from the wild rat reservoirs (Guan et al., 2013; He et al., 2018). In this study, we detected a distinct HEV in C. olivieri, a shrew species native in Africa, which is phylogenetically distant from rat HEVs. Full-length genome sequence of the new shrew HEV needs to be obtained to judge whether it can be classified as a novel species or it remains within Orthohepevirus C as a new genotype, following the demarcation criteria for Orthohepevirus species by the ICTV. In order to better understand the evolutionary position of shrew HEVs in Hepeviridae family, virus sequences from a greater diversity of shrew host species and geographic origin need to be determined. The zoonotic potential of rodent and shrew HEVs is also yet to be characterized.",

Among Old-World mammarenaviruses, besides the worldwide spread Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and Wenzhou-related viruses which have recently been widely reported in China and southeast Asia (Wang et al., 2019), all other viruses have been exclusively found in Africa, with each virus hosted by a specific host species or group of species (Charrel and de Lamballerie, 2010). These include LASV, Gbagroube virus, and Menekre viruses in West Africa; Ippy and Luna viruses in Central Africa; Morogoro, Gairo, and Mobala viruses in East Africa; Mopeia, Mariental, and Merino walk virus (MWV) in Southern Africa (Ishii et al., 2012; Gryseels et al., 2015). In Kenya, regardless of its large rodent diversity and the prevalent populations of M. natalensis, one of the most important host species of arenavirus, there are no records of arenavirus in rodents up to date. In this study, we characterized an arenavirus from rodents in Kenya for the first time. The novel virus from G. macmillani termed Kitale virus shows significant sequence distinction from all previously known arenaviruses in both of the two genomic segments, as well as in the four ORFs.

Another pathogenic arenavirus in Africa, Lujo virus, was discovered in South Africa following a nosocomial infection occasioned by a patient who traveled from Zambia (Ishii et al., 2012). In Asia, a genetic variant of Wenzhou virus was reported to have been associated with influenza-like human respiratory illness in Cambodia (Blasdell et al., 2016). The pathogenicity of other OWA remains unclear. However, Ippy virus, to which Kitale virus is most closely related, was found to be antigenically a member of the Lassa fever complex of arenaviruses via cross-immunofluorescence test (Swanepoel et al., 1985). While the pathogenic potential of Kitale virus requires further studies, the spillover risk of this novel rodent arenavirus should not be neglected. Additionally, the detection of Kitale virus in all tested tissues of the infected animal suggests its wide tissue tropism in the natural host. This may increase the potential of being transmitted to humans by enabling viral shedding into the environment through numerous routes such as saliva, urine, and feces.",

Therefore, identification of known and novel viruses in rodents and shrews is of public health significance. In this study, diverse novel RNA viruses of different families were discovered in rodents and shrews from regions of intensive agricultural activities, including a novel arenavirus related to those known to infect humans. The findings extend our knowledge on the host range, ecological distribution, and evolution of these RNA viral families. It also highlights the need for continued pathogen surveillance and disease monitoring not only in risk wildlife but also in livestock and humans in Kenya to prevent the occurrence of future zoonotic diseases.",
