The pathophysiology of diarrhea is complex, poorly understood and can involve a wide array of infectious and non-infectious etiologies [2], [3]. Clinical evaluation of ill animals directs the selection of diagnostic procedures such as parasite studies, microbiological examinations and/or toxin testing. Clinicians must weigh the cost of diagnostic procedures, the owner's willingness to pay for them and the time spent waiting for a result against the likelihood that the results of a diagnostic test will affect their therapeutic recommendations. This cost-benefit analysis often results in diarrhea in pets being managed by empirical therapy with antihelmintics and antimicrobials [4].",

The temporal trend for all antimicrobials combined and for each antimicrobial was examined by fitting a linear regression model to the data. The number of antimicrobial treated cases, normalized by the total number of diarrhea cases for each month, was the dependent variable and the month/year was the independent variable. If the antimicrobial use data fit the slope estimated by the linear regression (p<0.05), the proportions of cases treated with this antimicrobial were plotted as a function of time [25]. Further exploratory data analysis included data smoothing by: i) pooling the number of cases treated with each class of antimicrobial in each quarter of each year; and ii) plotting the results in scatterplots with quadratic overlays (Stata/IC 10.0).",

Despite increased AMR concerns [4], [6] there was evidence that nitroimidazole and penicillin use for the management of diarrhea in companion animals was increasing. Metronidazole (a drug of the Nitroimidazoles Class) was the most frequently prescribed antimicrobial and its use increased over the 4 years of the study. It is the drug of choice for anaerobic and microaerophilic bacteria (Bacteroides and Clostridia) and parasites (Giardia spp.) in animals [4]. In people it is important in the management of these pathogens and Helicobacter pylori\n[31], [32]. There are few therapeutic alternatives for these infections in people and so it is classified as a Category I antimicrobial [24]. Sensitivity testing for anaerobes is not routinely performed but treatment failures have been documented [32], [33] and the molecular basis for resistance has been established [31]. We found no papers documenting the transmission of metronidazole-resistant bacteria from pets to people.",

Convenia is the trade name for cefovecin, a third generation cephalosporin. The increase in cefovecin use corresponded to a decrease in the use of penicillin \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor combinations. The indications for use are similar for the 2 classes of drugs so it is possible that one class was being used as an alternative to the other. Starting in the middle of 2009, the relationship appeared to be inverted and this trend continued until the end of 2010, the reason for which is unknown.",
