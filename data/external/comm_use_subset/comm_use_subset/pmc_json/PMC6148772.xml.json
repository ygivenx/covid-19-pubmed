TGEV infects the epithelial cells of the intestinal tract, resulting in villus atrophy and impaired absorption of nutrition [3, 4]. The porcine small intestinal epithelial cell line IPEC-J2 is an intestinal columnar epithelial cell line that was isolated from the mid-jejunum of a neonatal piglet [5]. IPEC-J2 cells are used for in vitro investigations of swine viruses and nutrition [6, 7].",

Several growth factors, including epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor \u03b1 (TGF-\u03b1), elicit their functions by binding to EGF receptors (EGFR) and instigating an intracellular PKC signal transduction cascade [25, 26]. EGFR is a transmembrane protein and is expressed on the surface of many different cell types. Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that EGFR promotes TGEV entry into intestinal epithelial cells by regulating cofilin activity, and that both clathrin- and caveolin-mediated endocytosis are important for TGEV and EGFR internalization [27, 28].",

It has been demonstrated that CAT-1 is a higher-affinity carrier for cationic amino acids, and has more pronounced trans stimulation compared with CAT-2 [8, 36]. Our experiments showed that expression of CAT-1 was consistent with the trends of arginine uptake, while CAT-2 mRNA levels remained unchanged.

Activated EGFR triggers numerous downstream signaling pathways, including PKC-mediated cascades, and activates Ras, which affects various MAP kinases [40]. Hu et al. demonstrated that EGFR influences TGEV entry, and plays a synergistic role with APN early in TGEV infection. TGEV acts via the EGFR-PI3 K-Rac1/Cdc42-PAK-LIMK signaling pathway to regulate coflin activity and F-actin arrangement early in infection, and promotes TGEV entry [27]. Further research showed EGFR acts as a co-factor for TGEV entry, and TGEV S1 protein is able to bind to EGFR [28]. Moreover, EGFR is also involve in the regulation of glucose uptake during TGEV infection [41]. Our data provide evidence that EGFR regulates arginine uptake by functioning as a signal molecule in an EGFR-PKC \u03b1-caveolin-1-CAT-1 signaling pathway in TGEV-infected cells (Figure 6B). Our model includes a previously unreported signaling pathway that links EGFR with CAT-1. However, it is not yet known how EGFR passes a signal to CAT-1, or if other as yet unidentified signaling molecules regulate CAT-1.",

Caveolin-1 is the main protein component of caveolae, and is necessary for caveolae formation [42]. CAT-1 and caveolin-1 were reported to co-localize on the surface of cells. Our results showed that increased caveolin-1 levels are involved in the regulation of CAT-1. A possible explanation is that TGEV infection promotes CAT-1 clustering to caveolae islands, resulting in co-location.",
