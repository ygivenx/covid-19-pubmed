The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that vaccines save around 2\u20133 million lives a year [3]. Traditional vaccines are based on two main methodologies: live-attenuated and inactivated/killed pathogens [4]. Even though vaccines produced with these methods are immunologically effective, they still show some disadvantages, such as the need for a cold-chain, reduced shelf life and the time-consuming processes involved in the production and purification [5\u20137]. On the other hand, new methodologies have been used such as subunit and recombinant vaccines that weakly stimulate the immune system and their immunological effect is of short durability, so they require the use of adjuvant to potentiate their effect. Currently available adjuvants may lead to unwanted effects such as the generation of granulomas, allergies and neurotoxicity due to the different components used [5, 8, 9]. However, even with the evolution of vaccines, vaccination continues to represent a high cost mainly for developing countries, due to the fact that they have the highest number of people vulnerable to infectious diseases [10\u201312]. An effective, low cost technology to produce thermostable vaccines would represent a major advancement in the fight against infectious diseases worldwide, and may significantly reduce the risk of pandemics [13].",

The strategy is based on the generation of crystal structures known as polyhedra, where the virus is occluded and protected from the environment for several years. Most interestingly, a single protein (known as polyhedrin) forms the polyhedra crystal during the infection of insect cells. Polyhedrin self-aggregates inside the nucleus and during aggregation viruses get occluded inside the crystal. Thus polyhedra is a natural preservative of proteins, whose function is to maintain the virus viable for many years at ambient temperature [24, 25].",

A transfer plasmid containing the strong polyhedrin promoter drives the expression of the PH(1\u2013110) followed by a poly-linker [29], which allows the insertion of any sequence to generate the fusion protein (Fig. 1a). In this particular case we introduced the sequence from the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) to produce the fusion protein PH(1\u2013110)\nGFP [28]. This plasmid was utilized to produce recombinant baculovirus expressing the fusion protein in Sf9 insect cells. Sf9 insect cells infected with our recombinant baculovirus carrying the gene to expressed the fusion protein PH(1\u2013110)\nGFP were sonicated to release the particles. Particles were centrifuged at low speed and the protein purified in this manner was subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 1b). As control we utilized a pure soluble form of GFP. As illustrated in the figure, a simple centrifugation results in highly pure PH(1\u2013110)\nGFP protein, showing that the major component is the expected protein. Figure 1c illustrates an example of a Sf9 insect cells expressing PH(1\u2013110)\nGFP visualized by confocal microscopy (for a 3D reconstruction of the particles please refer to Additional file 1: Video S1). Notice that all particles were contained within the nucleus (labeled with DAPI in blue). Electron microscopy (transmission electron microscopy in panel D and scanning electron microscopy in E) shows that the PH(1\u2013110)\nGFP particles are polydisperse, formed micro and nanoparticles. A capillary electroforesis analysis indicates that over 80% of the protein content is PH(1\u2013110)\nGFP (see the Additional file 2).\n",

The speed of diffusion should be related to the laxity of the structure [30].

            "text": "Using the PH(1\u2013110)\nGFP particles we immunized mice to evaluate the antibody response generated by our particles. Initially we explored if one or two immunization would make a difference in the immune response and found no significant differences (see the Additional file 3). The immunization protocol included 2 vaccinations a week apart (Fig. 4a). Blood samples were taken in two-week intervals for 24 weeks to assay for antibodies against GFP used as model antigen (Fig. 4a). GFP is poorly immunogenic and adjuvants are required in order to obtain antibodies when using soluble GFP as antigen. Most interestingly, ELISA assays show the generation of anti-GFP antibodies in all animals vaccinated with the PH(1\u2013110)\nGFP particles obtained from the sucrose gradients shown in Fig. 3. As indicated by the data, no significant differences in the antibody generation were observed with any of the particles obtained from the 40\u201360% sucrose gradients (Fig. 4b). When the different particle sizes where compared with the combined mixture (particle mix), no statistically significant differences in antibody levels were observed. Thus, particle size does not appear to influence in the production of immunoglobulin IgG. Therefore, in the subsequent experiments we use the mixture of particles. The presence of anti-GFP antibodies was observed even after 24 weeks, indicating the induction of a long lasting immune response by the PH(1\u2013110)\nGFP particles (Fig. 4c). The antibody titers obtained with our PH(1\u2013110)\nGFP particles were high (12,800 dilution) without the use of any adjuvant. Using the gold standard adjuvant aluminum hydroxide (Alum) resulted in higher antibody titers (51,200, Fig. 4d). High antibody titers were maintained for at least 24 weeks post-vaccination (see the Additional file 4). Most noticeable, when GFP was used in the absence of any adjuvant, no antibodies were produced (Fig. 4c-d, green triangles). These results show that even though the use of adjuvant improves the immune response, the PH(1\u2013110)\nGFP particles can induce a robust, long lasting immune response comparable to that obtained with the use of an adjuvant (Fig. 4c-d). Thus, our results indicate that particles have an adjuvant effect, since using free GFP (without the particles) requires adjuvant in order to induce a measurable immune response (Fig. 4c-d).\n",

ELISA analysis was carried out using microtiter plates (Corning, USA, cat. no 3590) coated overnight with 50 \u03bcL of GFP at a concentration of 1 \u03bcg mL\u2212 1 in 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.2). Microplates were washed 5 times with 200 \u03bcL of PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and blocked with PBS-Triton + 5% fat-free milk for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. Then, 50 \u03bcL of the sera diluted 1:100 in PBS-Triton-fat-free milk (for the experiment of PH(1\u2013110)\nGFP particles of different sizes a dilution 1:400 was used) were added and plates were incubated 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. After washing as described above, 50 \u03bcL of anti-mouse IgG diluted 1:5000 (Sigma-Aldrich, USA, cat. no. A9044) or anti-mouse IgG1 diluted 1:3000 (Thermo Fisher, USA, cat. no. 04\u20136120) or anti-mouse IgG2a diluted 1:3000 (Abcam, UK, cat. no. ab98698) or anti-mouse IgG2b diluted 1:3000 (Thermo Fisher, USA, cat. no. 610320) (all HRP-conjugated) were added and plates were incubated 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. Plates were washed 5 times as described, 50 \u03bcL of the 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substratum was added to each well (Sigma-Aldrich, USA, cat. no. 00\u20132023) and microplates were incubated at RT for 20 min. 50 \u03bcL of 0.16 M sulfuric acid solution was added to each well to stop the reaction. The OD reading at 450 nm was registered using Multiskan FC 3.1 microplate reader (Thermo Fisher, USA). For the titration of antibodies, sera were tested by performing serial 2-fold dilutions from 1:50 to 1:102400.",
