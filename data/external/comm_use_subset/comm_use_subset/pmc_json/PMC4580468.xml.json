We did not include systems for \u201cevent-based surveillance\u201d. Even if only one manifestation of the pathogen (e.g. invasive infection or strains with antibiotic resistance) was under surveillance, that pathogen was considered to be under surveillance. In addition, according to Swedish law, all cases of viral meningoencephalitis are notifiable. Thus we considered the viruses that can cause viral meningoencephalitis to be under surveillance. Second, we asked all epidemiologists responsible for surveillance of a particular pathogen at the National Public Health Agency to estimate how many full-time equivalents (FTEs) (1 year of full time work = 1 FTE) that were spent on surveillance activities for each pathogen, as an average over a year (if several people worked with one pathogen their work time was combined).

The reasons for excluding the weighting step was that in the experience from Germany for some variables, such as \u201cPublic attention\u201d there was a high variation in the weight given by different experts. In addition for some variables the weight given differed between different groups of experts in Germany. For example \u201cIncidence\u201d was given a high weight by epidemiologists and public health experts but a low weight by clinicians. The relationship was reversed for the criteria \u201cWork and school absenteeism\u201d and \u201cHealth care utilization\u201d. The number of experts invited from each category therefore affected the weighting score. Due to these limitations and in order to make the procedure less time consuming we decided to remove the weighting step.",

We changed the criteria for \u201cincidence\u201d so that it would also include asymptomatic infections. We made this change since even asymptomatic infections can require interventions such as contact tracing and vaccination of those exposed. In addition, the Swedish sureveillance system for notifiable diseases does not include data on whether the infection was symptomatic or not. Thus, there is a lack of epidemiological data in Sweden that differentiates between symptomatic and asymptomatic infections. We also modified the criteria for chronicity of illness and sequelae from the contribution of a pathogen to the total amount of chronicity or sequelae for all pathogens combined to the individual risk for each pathogen to cause chronicity and sequalae. This was done in order to give the incidence of a pathogen less influence as incidence was already included as a separate variable.",

True differences in incidence could explain why \u201cWork and school abseentism\u201d and \u201cHealth care utilization\u201d was scored lower in Sweden than in Germany for S. epidermidis. The incidence for Borrelia could also be higher in Sweden which could have affected the scoring for \u201cIncidence\u201d and \u201cChronicity of illness or sequelae\u201d. Public and media attention probably also differ between countries, which could explain why \u201cPublic attention\u201d for S. epidermidis and hepatitis E scored lower in Sweden than in Germany. Lower scores for \u201cPrevention possibilities and needs\u201d and \u201cTreatment possibilities and needs\u201d for hepatitis E in Sweden than in Germany more likely reflect a difference in the interpretation of the available evidence on if and how this infection should be treated than a real difference in the available interventions for prevention or treatment between Sweden and Germany.",

This could partly be explained by the law requiring all viral meningoencephalitis to be under surveillance, thus JC virus is under surveillance. For Salmonella our method divided Salmonella spp and Salmonella Typhi and non-Typhi but the law requires surveillance for all forms of Salmonella which could explain why Salmonella Typhi and non-Typhi was under surveillance although it was considered to be of low relevance to public health.",

Reasons for this could be that in the past, suitable methods for typing for some of the pathogens were lacking, but as new techniques such as whole-genome sequencing become less expensive, this might change. Another reason for lack of surveillance through typing be due to the pathogenesis of the disease caused by the pathogen under surveillance. For example, when the symptoms for tick-borne encephalitis virus are seen, the virus is usually no longer detectable and isolation for typing is therefore not possible.",

Apart from the associated costs, it could have led to \u201cexpert fatigue\u201d and a changing interpretation of the ranking criteria over time. Another limitation of this study is that we estimated full-time equivalents for surveillance through notifications per pathogen by self-assessment. This might not accurately reflect the actual time spent on surveillance through notifications for over a year. For example surveillance activities with a yearly variation (e.g. for influenza virus) might be overestimated if the assessment takes place during the influenza season and vice versa. In addition to that, FTEs per pathogen also depend on the efficiency of the surveillance system. A poorly designed surveillance system might require more time spent than several well designed systems. We did not have the possibility to assess FTEs for surveillance of typing results. Furthermore, we did not measure the resources spent on research activities at the Public Health Agency of Sweden. It would be of interest to find out how they are distributed among the priority groups.",

In addition the results indicate that other countries with a similar panorama of communicable diseases and the same level of health care as in Sweden and Germany could consider using the list from either Sweden or Germany in order to save time. For countries who plan to conduct the prioritization method we recommend to consider additional modifications of the prioritization method in order to make it less time consuming, such as replacing the Delphi procedure with a \u201cmini-Delphi\u201d that can take place during a one-day workshop, which has previously been done in other settings [12].",
