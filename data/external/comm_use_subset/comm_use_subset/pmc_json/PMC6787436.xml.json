The molecular function of VCP is ATP-driven protein unfolding (Ye et al., 2017; van den Boom and Meyer, 2018). Depending on the different associated co-factors (Hanzelmann and Schindelin, 2017), it is involved in many cellular pathways, ranging from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrial associated protein degradation (Taylor and Rutter, 2011; Wolf and Stolz, 2012), ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) (Meyer et al., 2012), chromatin structure regulation (Torrecilla et al., 2017), DNA break repair (Torrecilla et al., 2017), DNA replication (Ramadan et al., 2017), NF-\u03baB activation (Schweitzer et al., 2016), stalled ribosome turnover (Verma et al., 2013), endomembrane fusion (Zhang and Wang, 2015), full capacity of autophagy and lysosomal system (Papadopoulos and Meyer, 2017), and lipid droplet turnover (Olzmann et al., 2013).",

Using a CHIKV trans-replication system, VCP was verified to be an important factor required during RNA replication of the virus life cycle, but not for the stability of the non-structural proteins (nsPs). We also showed that VCP co-localized with several nsPs. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms involved in VCP proviral role, including its viral interacting protein partners, will be crucial in developing therapies targeting VCP pro-viral functions potentially efficient on several viral families.",

Reduction of VCP protein levels was verified by western blot assays at 48 h (time of infection) and 64 h post-siRNA transfection (16 h post infection, time of supernatant collection) (Figure 1A). Knockdown of VCP significantly reduced the increase of viral RNA in the supernantant from 0 to 16 hpi (Figure 1B). Next, we validated that Gluc luminescence correlated with viral RNA and viral particle amounts in the same cell supernatants (Supplementary Figure S1), confirming that Gluc luminescence could be used as a marker of viral replication. Using Gluc, we confirmed that VCP knockdown severely impacted viral replication (Figure 1C).",

The different chemical inhibitors assessed included DBeQ, a reversible inhibitor of VCP (Fang et al., 2015), NMS-873, a specific allosteric VCP inhibitor (Magnaghi et al., 2013), and CB-5083, an orally bioavailable active compound derived from the scaffold of DBeQ (Anderson et al., 2015). Notably, CB-5083 has been shown to be selective, specifically inhibiting the ATPase activity of the D2 domain of VCP by binding in the nucleotide binding site (Tang et al., 2019). All VCP inhibitors showed a dose-dependent effect on Gluc production with an approximate effective concentration 50 (EC50) ranging from 0.4 to 10 \u03bcM (Figure 2). Toxicity of the different inhibitors at different concentrations was verified using the Cell Titer Glo assay and showed cytotoxic concentration 50 (CC50) very close from their respective EC50 for DBeQ and NMS-873 suggesting that their inhibitory effect on viral Gluc production could be linked to the cytotoxicity effect. However, no significant toxicity for CB-5083 was observed (Figure 2E), suggesting that the inhibitory effect on CB-5083 on viral Gluc production is not due to cytotoxicity. Interestingly, the time-of-addition of chemical inhibitors relative to viral infection had no significant impact on the anti-CHIKV EC50 (Figures 2C,D,F), with CB-5083 having the lowest EC50 (0.4 < EC50 < 0.45 \u03bcM) (Figure 2E).

During binding on ice, no difference in the relative amount of CHIKV RNA was observed during VCP inhibition by CB-5083 treatment compared to the control samples (Figure 3A). Intriguingly, higher CHIKV RNA levels in the DMSO control-treated samples were observed when binding was performed at 37\u00b0C, suggesting that VCP could be involved in an early post-entry replication step. Together with the binding on ice, a lower amount of CHIKV RNA in the treated group indicates that some replication has occurred in the DMSO control, but not in the treated group.",

In this system, the nsPs are encoded on a separate plasmid and expressed constitutively using a CMV promoter (Utt et al., 2015) (Plasmid 1, Figure 4A). Since the use of viral RNA templates generated by cellular RNA polymerase II could produce high background signals (Utt et al., 2015; Abraham et al., 2018; Bartholomeeusen et al., 2018), and the replicase of CHIKV is capable of using non-capped RNA templates (Utt et al., 2015), a human RNA polymerase I promoter was used to generate non-capped viral RNA template (Plasmid 2, Figure 4A) (Utt et al., 2019). This template codes for Firefly luciferase (Fluc) instead of the non-structural open-reading frame (ORF) and codes for tdTomato instead of the structural ORF (Plasmid 2, Figure 4A). These reporters would be translated after template RNA replication by the viral replicase, with minimal expression of either reporter in absence of template RNA replication. Thus, tdTomato protein would be expressed and detectable only when RNA replication occurred allowing us to assess the effect of VCP inhibitor on viral replication.",

Next, we verified that VCP inhibition did not affect expression of the nsPs from the CMV plasmid by assessing nsP1 protein levels by western blot (Figures 4C,D). Altogether, results showed that CB-5083 had no negative effect on production of CHIKV replicase proteins or template RNA. However, when the replicase and templates were co-expressed, VCP chemical inhibition drastically decreased the amount of tdTomato mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) detected per transfected cell (Figure 4E) despite the increased Fluc RNA template availability.

Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient for all the acquired images indicated that VCP co-localized more with nsP2 and nsP3 than nsP1 (Figure 5D).

Therefore, we assessed the performance of a polyclonal rabbit anti-VCP antibody in immunofluorescence assay which would allow co-localization with the mouse antibody recognizing dsRNA. Using this combinaition of antibodies, we did not observe co-localization between VCP and dsRNA foci (Figure 6A). Interestingly, this antibody against VCP presented a very different localization pattern than the mouse monoclonal antibody used previously in both infected and non-infected conditions (Figure 5). Since the rabbit antibody, directed against the N-terminal, gave a punctuated localization different from the pattern observed previously near the cytosolic membrane with the mouse monoclonal antibody against VCP C-terminal (Figure 5), we assessed co-localization of the two anti-VCP antibodies (Figure 6B). Signals from both antibodies did not co-localize, and localization of VCP near the plasma membrane was not observable using the N-terminal directed antibody raised in rabbit. Since the N-terminal of VCP is a site of interaction with several co-factors (Hanzelmann and Schindelin, 2017), we hypothesize that the observed absence of co-localization of dsRNA with VCP could be due to a lack of N-terminal accessibility.",

CHIKV can be categorized into three main genotypes, the West Africa, East-Central-South-African (ECSA), and Asian genotypes. We compared the Chikungunya strain isolated during the La Reunion epidemic [La Reunion isolate LR2006-OPY1 (LR)] and an Indian (IND) strain isolated in India during the same epidemic from a patient presenting neurological complications both belonging to the ECSA genotype. We also compared a Caribbean (CRB) isolate (CNR20235) belonging to the Asian genotype, isolated during outbreaks in the CRB islands in December 2013, which we have previously shown to be less pathogenic than the LR isolate in vitro and in vivo in mouse models (Teo et al., 2015). VCP inhibition with CB-5083 showed a dose-dependent inhibition of viral Gluc production with all viruses tested (Figure 7A). A dose-dependent decrease of ZsGreen signal was also observed in cells infected with ZsGreen-tagged CHIKV or ONNV (Figure 7B). In addition, we assessed if the effect of VCP inhibition on CHIKV replication was reproducible in more relevant human cells related to cell types infected in patients: a human foreskin fibroblast cell line (BJ cells) and a muscle cells line (RD cells) (Suhrbier et al., 2012). VCP inhibition with CB-5083 resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of CHIKV in BJ and RD cells (Figure 7C).",

Time-of-addition assays using specific chemical inhibitors of VCP suggested that the virus life cycle step involving VCP as a proviral factor would be viral RNA replication rather than binding or entry. Although the effect of VCP inhibition demonstred to be conserved across different alphaviruses (Figure 7), variations in the level of virus inhibition were observed between the different cell types and virus isolates. These variations are likely due to the calculation for each virus and cell type, where the relative luciferase is normalized against the signals from the untreated infected internal controls, where background signal comes from initial Gluc contained in the inoculum.",

In addition, viral replicase components nsP1, 2, and 3 were demonstrated to co-localize partially with VCP differentially (Figure 5). This difference could be due to the fact that a significant portion of nsP1 is anchored in the plasma membrane while VCP, nsP2, and nsP3 are cytoplasmic. These results are consistent with earlier studies with SFV and HCV showing association of VCP with their replication complexes (Varjak et al., 2013; Yi et al., 2016), and the role of VCP during virus RNA replication of poliovirus, enterovirus 71, human cytomegalovirus, West Nile virus, and HCV (Arita et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2016; Yi et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2017; Phongphaew et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017; Yi and Yuan, 2017). Interestingly, VCP was also involved in the egress of viral particles for poliovirus and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) (Arita et al., 2012; Brahms et al., 2017). The results on RVFV are of particular interest, where the study identified VCP as the target of FDA-approved drug Sorafenib effect on RVFV (Benedict et al., 2015; Brahms et al., 2017). The same group has also identified Sorafenib as a potential drug that reduces replication of several alphaviruses including CHIKV (Lundberg et al., 2018). It would be interesting to verify if Sorafenib inhibits alphaviruses in a VCP-dependant manner similar to RVFV.",

This is likely due to the unavailability of the VCP N-terminal for recognition with the antibody used, which is reinforced by the lack of co-localization of the VCP antibodies recognizing the C- and N-termini (Figure 6B). Importantly, the apparent re-localization of VCP with an available C-terminal at the infected cell membrane is consistent with the localization of the dsRNA foci. Further studies will be needed to assess if and how VCP is involved in the replication complexes of CHIKV and other alphaviruses.",

A link between one or more of the described VCP functions and viral replication remains poorly understood. For example during infection, virus could use VCP to hijack ER or mitochondria-associated degradation, proteasome, or UPS modulating functions (Taylor and Rutter, 2011; Wolf and Stolz, 2012). Proteasome activity was reported to be essential for CHIKV replication (Karpe et al., 2016), and CHIKV can manipulate the UPS to prevent host-cell shut-off (Fros et al., 2015). Along the same line, CHIKV could use VCP modulating function on autophagy. Such mechanism could explain how CHIKV induces autophagy (Papadopoulos and Meyer, 2017) to delay cell death and increase replication (Joubert et al., 2012a, b). It is also plausible that VCP\u2019s role in membrane rearrangement (Zhang and Wang, 2015) could be hijacked by the virus in order to form invaginated membranous structures of the replication complexes efficiently (Reid et al., 2015). This would explain VCP co-localization with CHIKV nsPs (Figure 5), and its presence in replication complexes of HCV and SFV (Varjak et al., 2013; Yi et al., 2016).",

Other cellular functions of VCP, such as NF-\u03baB activation (Schweitzer et al., 2016), stalled ribosome turnover (Verma et al., 2013), full capacity of autophagy and lysosomal system (Papadopoulos and Meyer, 2017), are cellular functions and pathways that could possess pro- or anti-viral functions.
