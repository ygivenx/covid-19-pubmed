            "text": "Today, most intensive care unit (ICU) patients survive their ICU stay [1], although they may experience critical illness, trauma, or deterioration of chronic disease, and many require support with a ventilator, vasoactive drugs, or dialysis. During their ICU stay, patients may experience sleep deprivation [2\u20134], pain [5], discomfort [6], delirium [5], and physical deterioration [7]. All of these experiences, and the critical illness itself, may negatively be associated with ICU survivors\u2019 health-related quality of life (HRQOL) long after their ICU stay [8\u201316]. Previous research on this population has demonstrated that preexisting disease or comorbidity has a negative impact on HRQOL following an ICU stay [8, 17, 18], and that chronic pain had a negative impact on HRQOL [19]. Quality of life (QOL) is a multidimensional concept that, in its broadest interpretation, comprises almost every aspect of life, includes numerous definitions [20, 21]. For the purposes of this study, we used the definition of QOL that regards a person\u2019s sense of satisfaction or dissatisfaction with areas of life that are important to them [22]. HRQOL, then, is QOL in the context of health and illness [23].",

Cancer research has shown that help from friends and family is important for patient recovery and coping [25]. ICU survivors often undergo dramatic changes in health and functioning [26\u201328]. Their social life may also be altered because of reduced contact with family and friends during their ICU and hospital stays, and because they are absent from work, school, and/or leisure activities. It may take a long time for these patients to regain normal activity levels, if they ever do [29, 30]. We hypothesized that these factors could explain changes in HRQOL. Previous research [31] found that instrumental and emotional social support influence HRQOL in ICU survivors; however, to our knowledge, little other research has been conducted on social support in ICU survivors and its impact on HRQOL. The aim of the present study was to investigate a possible association between social support, pain interference, and comorbidity on HRQOL 3 months and 1 year after ICU discharge.",

            "text": "Two measures were used to assess disease severity during ICU stay: the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II) and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. The SAPS II was developed to quantify the likelihood of hospital mortality in ICU patients [32] and is based on multiple parameter values (vital signs, Glasgow Coma Scale, and the presence of malignancy or human immunodeficiency virus infection) measured during the first 24 hours after ICU admission. These values are summed for a total SAPS II (range 0\u2013163), with a higher score indicating greater severity of illness. SAPS II has been shown valid and reliable for use in medical, surgical [32], and coronary ICU patients [33]. A SAPS II score of 29 indicate a mortality of 10% and if the SAPS II score increase to 40 the morality also increases to 25%. If the SAPS II score increase to 64 and above the morality increase to 75% [32].The SOFA score describes different levels of organ failure over time, as well as the risk of death from sepsis, and has been used with many critically ill patients and patient groups [34]. The SOFA score has been shown valid and reliable in adult ICU patients [35]. The SOFA score is based on respiratory, cardiovascular, hepatic, coagulation, renal, and cognitive failure, each rated on a 4-point scale (total score range 0\u201324). A higher SOFA score indicates a higher level of organ failure and a higher risk of death. SOFA score of 0\u20136 may on a group level indicate mortality of 10%. If the SOFA score increase to 7\u20139 mortality increases to 15\u201320%, and SOFA score of above 15 indicates mortality of above 90% [35]. Both SAPS II and SOFA scores provide information about critical illness severity and can be used to predict mortality.",

The SF-12 (v1) consists of 12 questions about eight health concepts: physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, energy/fatigue, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. These concepts are summed to create a Physical Component Summary (PCS) and a Mental Component Summary (MCS) [37]. The SF-12 PCS and MCS are calculated using norm-based data from the 1998 general US population, with a mean of 50 (standard deviation [SD] 10), which is similar to the general Norwegian population, which has a mean PCS of 50.3 (SD 8.8) and mean MCS of 50.6 (SD 9.9) [38]. The mean cutoff score of 50 means that if the study sample scores a mean value for PCS below 50, then they have reduced physical health compared with the general population; if the study sample scores higher than 50, then they have better physical health compared with the general population. This also applies to the MCS. Higher summary scores indicate better HRQOL. The SF-12 is widely used and has been validated for use in many patient groups, as well as the general population, and has been translated into many languages, including Norwegian [38]. The SF-12 has specifically been shown to be valid and reliable in relation to, and to be a good alternative for, the longer SF-36 [37, 38].Based on recommendation from Ware et al [39] a reduction of 5.0 in PCS and MCS score was considered to be clinical relevant in this present study.",

A high score indicates a high level of social support [43].

The total SPS score is calculated by summing the scores of the four provisions (maximum score 64). The revised SPS has been shown to be valid and reliable for use with older adults living in Norway [43], and the original SPS has been used in studies of hospital nurses [44], pregnant women, first time mothers [45], and schoolteachers [46]. The primary differences between the original and revised SPS are the decrease from six to four provisions, respectively, and a change in total score from a maximum of 96 in the original to 64 in the revised version.

Pain interference with the seven functional domains was rated on a numerical rating scale from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes).

Collecting any baseline data from ICU survivors is difficult, but previous studies have shown that this population has lower HRQOL than the normative population, even before their ICU stay [8, 17]. Second, we compared PCS and MCS derived from our sample with 1996 normative US data. Ideally, we would have used normative Norwegian data but, as mentioned above, Norwegian cutoff scores are similar to the US data [38]. Finally, our drop-out rate at 1 year was relatively high (32%). These factors may have resulted in a selection bias, though we did not find any differences between responders and non-responders at 1 year with regard to gender (p-value 0.71), age (p-value 0.87), ICU LOS (p-value 0.35), MV days (p-value 0.64) and SPAPS II score (p-value 0.21). More details are presented in supplementary material to Langerud et al [65]. Therefore, we assume that our results might be generalizable to other ICU survivors. Others have reported that the most severely ill are difficult to study [66, 67]; therefore, illness severity may explain our relatively high dropout rate.",
