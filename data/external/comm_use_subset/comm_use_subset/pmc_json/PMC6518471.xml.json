            "text": "Acute respiratory infection (ARI) seasonality is generally believed to stem from three main factors: the cyclical nature of host immunity, weather variations and changes in host behaviour, most notably in how people interact with each other [1, 2]. Close person-to-person contact, particularly among school-age children, is frequently cited as an important example of the latter. An association between school sessions and ARI outbreaks has long been observed [3], and many researchers have proposed school attendance as an important driver of early autumn and winter spikes in ARIs. Yet research demonstrating this effect is relatively limited. Measles was one of the first viruses that showed a strong correlation with school sessions [2, 4, 5]. More recent research on influenza [6, 7] has also suggested a link, and rhinovirus has demonstrated autumnal peaks that correlate closely with the onset of school [8]. Any attempt to discern a correlation between school attendance and seasonality, however, is necessarily complicated by other potential drivers that these studies do not address.",

Colder temperatures are associated with increases in ARIs, and studies have largely confirmed an inverse relationship in temperate regions. Inverse relationships between viral prevalence and temperature have been shown for common viral pathogens, including influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, adenovirus, coronavirus and human metapneumovirus [9\u201313]. Relative humidity has been studied extensively, albeit with less consistent findings. Several studies suggest that higher relative humidity correlates with increased prevalence of RSV, rhinovirus, adenovirus and coronavirus [9\u201311, 14\u201316]. Research on the role of temperature and relative humidity in bacterial causes of seasonal ARI is more limited as seasonal ARI outbreaks are primarily viral in children [17, 18] and often viral in adults [19, 20].",

Partially due to Wisconsin state mandates, academic year start and end dates, as well as winter breaks were relatively uniform across the state with variation of less than 1 week between districts. School districts showed more variation in timing of spring vacations, so schools were assumed to remain in session throughout the spring semester for data analysis. Spring break typically lasts 9 days (5 school days), but varies widely over a 5-week period among school districts within any given year. As de-identified ARI events were aggregated over a wide geographic area, representing the catchment areas of 28 clinics and several dozen school districts, we were unable to assess for the differences in the aggregated data based on individual exposure to a particular school district break timing. School attendance for each week of every calendar year was coded with one of six values representing: (1) 1 week in session, (2) 2 weeks in session, (3) more than 2 consecutive weeks in session, (4) 1 week out of session, (5) 2 weeks out of session or (6) more than 2 consecutive weeks out of session.",

We included pneumonia and otitis media, as these diagnoses are often associated with viral aetiologies. For example, influenza vaccines reduce episodes of otitis media in children by 83% during the influenza season [24]. Utilising a common measure, however, prevents assessment of contributions from specific pathogens which may impart a stronger correlation with school attendance [25]. Other factors may have also influenced risk ratios. First, we used a wide-rage age category (25\u201364) based on the US Influenza Sentinel Providers Surveillance Network, which may have significantly affected the estimate of impact in younger adults, especially in parents of school-aged children. Second, we used a school calendar with mostly uniform annual autumn start dates and spring end dates. However, we could not account for spring school breaks, which may hamper transmission through school closure or conversely lead to higher risk due to increased travel [26]. Post-hoc graphical analysis demonstrated a consistent reduction in ARI visits for individuals age 5\u201317 years during the five potential weeks of spring break. Accordingly, our approach is conservative and likely underestimates school effect for the 5\u201317 year group. Parents may also be less likely to present to clinics during winter breaks either due to changes in care seeking behaviour or clinic closure.",

Enveloped viruses, for example, are known to be highly infectious at low relative humidity, whereas non-enveloped rhinoviruses have increased transmissibility at high relative humidity [14]. Because outbreaks of these viruses peak at different times and frequently overlap, underlying weather effects may be obscured. Further, the relationship between meteorological variables and virus infectivity may not be monotonic. Recent studies of influenza demonstrated a complex relationship to relative humidity [12, 27], and other meteorological variables such as absolute humidity can explain the seasonality of influenza in temperate climates [28]. Nevertheless, temperature and relative humidity are principal attributes of seasonality in temperate latitudes. Hence, the driving influences of these climatic factors were statistically accounted for by incorporating a seasonal term in the analysis. We were not able to isolate a significant role for short-term fluctuations in temperature and relative humidity.",

Coupled with advanced community surveillance [29], public health mitigation efforts for significant outbreaks of respiratory infection may be more feasible. For example, if school exposures are shown to be an important cause of seasonal respiratory infectious disease outbreaks, then appropriately timed temporary school closures may be an effective way of disrupting local seasonal or pandemic outbreaks [30]. School closure appeared to be effective in preventing the spread of both severe acute respiratory syndrome [31] and H1N1 influenza [32\u201334]. Future research on seasonality and the contribution from school attendance will both help to establish a causative link and may improve predictive models for specific pathogens.",
