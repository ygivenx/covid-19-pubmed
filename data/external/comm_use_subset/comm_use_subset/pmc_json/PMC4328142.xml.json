The combined action of hundreds of expressed ISG proteins creates multiple lines of defense against viral infection. It is not surprising that different ISGs block different pathways and have varying potency against different classes of viruses (Schoggins et al., 2014). Our knowledge of ISG effector functions has been somewhat biased toward inhibition of early replication stages, such as entry, or viral translation initiation. However, viral assembly and release have proven to be an Achilles heel for viruses and are the targets of therapeutic small molecules (influenza A virus [IAV] neuraminidase inhibitors; HIV-1 protease inhibitors) and intrinsic ISGs such as tetherin (Neil et al., 2008) or viperin (Wang et al., 2007).",

Applying an approach that accurately monitors several rounds of viral replication in the presence of single overexpressed ISGs, we discovered a direct antiviral function of the well-known gene SERPINE1, which encodes PAI-1 (Ny et al., 1986). We demonstrate that PAI-1 inhibits IAV maturation by targeting host proteases needed for viral glycoprotein cleavage and that this is physiologically relevant in natural proteolytic landscapes both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we link a human genetic polymorphism in extracellular PAI-1 production to enhanced IAV susceptibility in vitro. In all, we show that shaping the extracellular environment can be a powerful mechanism in the vast arsenal of the innate immune response against invading pathogens.",

Human lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549) were transduced with lentiviral vectors to express individual ISGs (Figure 1A).

Nineteen ISGs reduced the IAV spread ratio to <20, greater than two SDs from the empty vector control in both screens (Figure 1B and Table S2). Among these ISGs were several broadly acting antiviral factors involved in pattern recognition and IFN signaling, such as DDX58 (RIG-I), IFIH1 (MDA5), IRF2, IRF7, IL28RA (IFNLR1), inflammatory cytokines, CCL5 (RANTES), and broadly acting or IAV-specific inhibitors, such as IFITM3, Mx1, and BST2 (Schneider et al., 2014). IFITM3 and Mx1 act early (IAV entry or replication), whereas BST2, also known as tetherin, prevents release of budding virus particles at the host cell surface. Although conflicting data exist on IAV inhibition by tetherin (Mangeat et al., 2012; Watanabe et al., 2011; Yondola et al., 2011), it potently inhibited spread in A549 cells and was subsequently used as a positive control. We also identified a number of ISGs with previously uncharacterized antiviral activities: MAP3K14, ELF1, PMM2, FAM46C, TBX3, SCO2, CRY1, TNFSF10 (TRAIL), XAF1, MAFF, and SERPINE1 (serine protease inhibitor, member E1). We validated this set of genes with independently generated, high-titer lentiviral stocks and A549 cells, as well as normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE). All but FAM46C, which did not inhibit virus spread on NHBE cells, were confirmed as antiviral (Figure 1C). To exclude false positives due to cytotoxicity, we tested cell proliferation, apoptosis, DNA damage, and cell death profiles by high-throughput microscopy (HTM) (Figure S1D). We found that only expression of MAP3K14, the most potent hit in our screen, and TNFSF10 were cytotoxic relative to the empty vector control.",

We compared A549 cells and the more relevant in vitro model of NHBE-derived, differentiated human ciliated airway epithelium cultures (HAEC), which mimic both the morphology and physiology of the airway epithelium in vivo. In A549 cells, SERPINE1 mRNA was slightly upregulated upon IFN-\u03b2 stimulation and following infection with IAV WSN/33 (Figure 2A). This was not due to nonresponsiveness of A549 cells, since other ISGs were highly upregulated (Figures S2A\u2013S2C). TGF-\u03b2 is known to trigger SERPINE1 expression via the canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway (He et al., 2010). Indeed, TGF-\u03b2 treatment of A549 cells strongly induced SERPINE1 expression with no or modest effects on ISG15, IFITM3, and BST2 mRNA levels (Figures S2A\u2013S2D). Stimulation of SERPINE1 gene expression led to increased intracellular and extracellular levels of PAI-1 (Figures 2B, 2C, S2E, and S2F). Consistent with PAI-1 being efficiently secreted, total PAI-1 levels in the supernatant were about 16-fold higher than in respective IFN-\u03b2-treated cell lysates at 24 hr (Figures 2B and 2C). We observed apical secretion of PAI-1 by HAEC after either IAV WSN/33 infection (Figure 2D) or TGF-\u03b2 treatment (Figure S2G). Of note, even mock-treated A549 cells and HAEC constantly produced and secreted basal levels of PAI-1 that accumulated over time (Figures 2B\u20132D). However, PAI-1 is further upregulated by certain stimuli, including virus infection.",

We tested whether known HA-cleaving proteases might be direct targets for PAI-1 inhibition. PAI-1 inhibits protease function by forming a covalent, SDS-stable bond with the target protease, detectable in gel shift assays. Urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), a major target of PAI-1, formed a complex of \u223c85 kDa with rPAI-1, but not in the presence of the PAI-1 inhibitor triplaxtinin (Figure 3A). TPCK-trypsin is another established target of PAI-1 and a prototype chymotrypsin-like serine protease (Olson et al., 2001). To allow multiple rounds of IAV infection in cells lacking endogenous HA-cleaving proteases, such as A549, trypsin is typically added in low concentrations to the tissue culture medium. We readily detected PAI-1-trypsin complexes formed in vitro and their degradation products, which were again absent when triplaxtinin was added (Figure 3B). Furthermore, we identified human tryptase and human airway trypsin (HAT) as PAI-1 targets (Figures 3C and 3D). In contrast, we were unable to detect complexes of PAI-1 and furin, although this interaction has been previously reported (Figure S4) (Bernot et al., 2011).",

Both H1PR8 and H2Japan were uncleaved at baseline but were readily cleaved by either exogenous trypsin or overexpressed TMPRSS2 (Figure 4D). The slight differences in HA1 size between trypsin- and TMPRSS2-treated HA has been previously shown to be caused by altered glycosylation patterns in TMPRSS2-overexpressing cells (Bertram et al., 2010a). Further, we found that wild-type but not mutant PAI-1 inhibited TMPRSS2-mediated cleavage of both HA subtypes. In contrast, cleavage of H5Vietnam, which is mediated by endogenous intracellular proteases such as furin, was not impaired by PAI-1 (Figure 4E). This result is in line with data from PAI-1-furin gel shift assays (Figure S4) and from experiments with furin-dependent HPIV3 (Figures S2H and S2I), further suggesting that furin is indeed not inhibited by PAI-1.",

Serpine1 was transcriptionally upregulated in B6 mouse lungs upon IAV infection (Figure 5B). We also detected increasing levels of murine PAI-1 (mPAI-1) in mouse lungs over the course of IAV infection with a 10-fold increase at 5 dpi compared to PBS-treated B6 (Figure 5C). Both Serpine1 mRNA and mPAI-1 protein were undetectable in Serpine1\u2212/\u2212 lung homogenates. IAV-infected Serpine1\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited significant weight loss and succumbed to infection on average 1 day earlier than B6 parental mice (Figures 5D, 5E, 5G, and 5H). This difference was not observed in mice infected with VSV control (Figure S5A). Despite the modest difference in survival, lung IAV titers at late times of infection were significantly elevated in Serpine1\u2212/\u2212 (Figures 5F and 5I), which correlated with the levels of mPAI-1. Keller et al. (2006) used Serpine1\u2212/\u2212 mice to study the effect of influenza virus infection on thrombosis, and they found no impact of PAI-1 on IAV infection, as measured by the amount of viral RNA at day 4 dpi. However, given the role of PAI-1 in blocking viral maturation, the levels of infectious virus particles (Figures 5F and 5I) are a more relevant measure. Serpine\u2212/+ mice exhibited an intermediate phenotype with respect to weight loss, survival, and murine lung PAI-1 levels, indicating a co-dominant effect of PAI-1 on IAV infection (Figure S5B).",

These proteins remain linked via a disulfide bond (Skehel and Waterfield, 1975), which forms a hinge, a prerequisite for viral envelope fusion during entry (Klenk et al., 1975; Lazarowitz and Choppin, 1975). Because IAV does not encode its own protease, HA cleavage depends on the presence of host proteases at the site of IAV replication. Furin and PC5/6, members of the subtilisin-like family of serine-proteases, are known to cleave HA intracellularly (Horimoto et al., 1994; Stieneke-Gr\u00f6ber et al., 1992). We could not find evidence for inhibition of furin by PAI-1. Human tryptase, HAT, TMPRSS2, TMPRSS13, mosaic serine protease large-form (MSPL), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), and plasmin are known extracellular HA-cleaving proteases (Lazarowitz et al., 1973; reviewed in Bertram et al., 2010b). Most are members of the chymotrypsin-like serine protease family, the \u201ctarget family\u201d of PAI-1.

            "text": "Accessibility to glycoprotein cleavage is a major determinant of IAV pathogenicity (Bosch et al., 1981). Whether, and at what efficiency, an HA subtype can be cleaved by a given protease is determined by its cleavage site sequence. Highly pathogenic avian H5 and H7 HAs contain a multi-basic cleavage site, which makes them accessible to ubiquitiously expressed, intracellular proteases like furin (Bosch et al., 1981). Hence, viral particles of these subtypes are immediately mature and infectious upon budding. Less pathogenic IAV HAs, in contrast, contain a single arginine residue in their cleavage site, which makes them dependent on cleavage by extracellular airway proteases, such as TMPRSS2. Variation in the amino acid sequence surrounding this arginine alters cleavage efficiency (Galloway et al., 2013). Recent studies in TMPRSS2\u2212/\u2212 mice revealed a direct influence on pathogenicity of IAV strains relying on this protease (Hatesuer et al., 2013; Sakai et al., 2014; Tarnow et al., 2014). In the absence of TMPRSS2, IAV of H1N1, H3N2, or H7N9 origin were unable to spread from the trachea to the lungs, making the mice highly resistant. This was not the case for highly pathogenic H5N1 virus (Sakai et al., 2014). Thus, sensitivity to PAI-1-mediated inhibition (or inhibition by other protease inhibitors) will depend on the nature of the cleaving protease, as well as on the cleavage efficiency of a specific HA subtype by that protease (Figure 5). In this regard, it will be interesting to determine whether the protease inhibitor PAI-1 has differential impact on pathogenicity of different IAV subtypes in vivo.",

This is significant because HA-cleaving proteases are often upregulated by IAV infection, skewing the protease-protease inhibitor balance in favor of the virus (Kido et al., 2012). Thus, PAI-1 may tip the balance back toward the host.

Naturally occurring human genetic variations in PAI-1 impact the ability of IAV to spread from cell to cell, thus identifying PAI-1 as a candidate human gene that may influence susceptibility to IAV and the outcome of infection. In this regard, it will be of immediate interest to determine whether PAI-1 deficiency might be linked with the severity of human IAV infection. Finally, our work suggests that localized administration of PAI-1 to the respiratory tract might provide a new therapeutic approach for treating IAV and other respiratory viruses that require extracellular protease-driven maturation.",

            "text": "Using Gateway technology, we transferred a previously published library of ISGs (Schoggins et al., 2011) from ORFEXPRESS entry clones into a new lentiviral expression vector (pSCRPSY), co-expressing TagRFP as a transduction control and puromycin resistance. A549 cells in 96-well plates were first transduced and then challenged with IAV WSN/33 at MOI 0.01. Due to varying transduction efficiency between the lentiviral stocks, the percentage of non-transduced cells was variable. IAV production from non-transduced cells masked potential inhibitory effects of ISGs and was eliminated by adding puromycin 1 hr prior to IAV infection. Lentiviral transduction was performed in duplicate plates for each ISG, where one sample was fixed after one round of replication (8 hpi), defining the number of initial producer cells, and the other after several rounds of replication (24 hpi). \u201cSpread ratio\u201d was calculated by dividing the IAV-infected cells at 24 hpi by 8 hpi for each individual ISG over empty vector-transduced cells (Figures 1A, S1A, and S1B) and yielded results that were stable over a wide range of transduction efficiencies (Figure S1B). Infected cells were detected by staining for IAV nucleoprotein (NP) and HTM (Figures 1A, S1A, and S1B).",

            "text": "Extended Experimental ProceduresViruses, Cells, and PlasmidsEgg-grown influenza viruses A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) (PR8), A/Vietnam/1203/2004(HALo) (H5N1), pandemic A/California/04/2009 (H1N1), and A/sw/Texas/4199-2/1998 (H3N2) were obtained from Peter Palese, and A/Puerto Rico/8/1934-NS1-GFP reporter virus was from Adolfo Garcia-Sastre. Human parainfluenza virus 3 \u2013 GFP (HPIV3-GFP) was a gift from Peter Collins, NIAID, NIH. We received Sendai virus-GFP from Dominique Garcin, University of Geneva. IAV WSN/33 (H1N1) and X-31(H3N2) were grown on MDCK cells. Vesicular stomatitis virus strain Indiana was grown and titrated on BHK cells. Adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells (A549), rhesus macaque kidney (LLC-MK2) and 293T cells were purchased from ATCC, and normal human bronchial/tracheal epithelial cells (NHBE) were from Lonza.Human airway tracheobronchial epithelial cells isolated from airway specimens from patients with normal lungs were provided by Lonza, Inc. (Walkersville, MD). Primary cells derived from single patient sources were expanded on plastic to generate passage 1 cells, which were subsequently plated (5x104 cells/well) on rat-tail collagen type 1-coated permeable transwell membrane supports (6.5 mm; Corning Inc). HAE cultures were grown in B-ALI medium supplemented with inducer (Lonza, Inc.) at each media change with provision of an air-liquid interface for approximately 6 weeks to form differentiated, polarized cultures that resemble in vivo pseudostratified mucociliary epithelium.For infection, HAE were rinsed with PBS to transiently remove apical secretions and supplied with fresh basolateral medium prior to inoculation. We used 5x104 PFU A/WSN/33 or 1.4x104 TCID50 HPIV3-GFP, respectively, per culture. Virus was diluted in PBS and supplemented with either 5 ng rPAI-1, buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 6.6), 400 ng \u03b1-PAI-1 (abcam), or 400 ng rabbit IgG control per culture. The inoculum was applied to the apical surface of HAE for 2 hr at 37\u00b0C. Following incubation, viral inocula were removed, and cultures were washed 3 times with PBS. rPAI-1, buffer, \u03b1-PAI or IgG were replenished in 20 \u03bcl volume per culture, and cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0C for the duration of the experiment. Progeny virus was harvested at indicated times by performing apical washes with 100\u03bcl of PBS for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. After each wash, rPAI, buffer, \u03b1-PAI-1 or IgG were replenished. Washes were harvested and stored at \u221280\u00b0C prior to analysis. Viral titers in the apical washes were determined by plaque assay on MDCK cells (A/WSN/33), or TCID50 assay on LLC-MK2 cells (HPIV3-GFP).Primary human dermal fibroblasts were obtained from punch biopsies from human subjects from a cohort with various infectious disease. The cells were electroporated with a plasmid encoding the simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen to create SV40-immortalized fibroblasts (SV40-fibroblasts), and were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with gentamycin and 10% FBS until primary cells were no longer present.To screen ISGs for antiviral activity, we obtained sequence-validated ORFEXPRESS ISG shuttle clones (GeneCopoeia) and used Gateway technology to move genes into pSCRPSY lentiviral vector co-expressing RFP and a puromycin resistance gene. SERPINE1 was cloned into pCR\u00ae8/GW/TOPO\u00ae TA (Life Technologies). This entry clone DNA was used as template to insert mutation T356R using Quikchange technology (Agilent). SERPINE1 T356R (referred to as SERPINE1\u2217) was previously described to convey loss of function (Lawrence et al., 1994). Both SERPINE1 wild-type and SERPINE1\u2217 were moved into either pSCRPSY, for lentivirus production, or pDEST40 (Life Technologies), for transfection experiments.HA1PR8, H2Japan and H5Vietnam in pCAGGS-LIC were obtained from David Steinhauer (Emory University, Atlanta). Plasmids encoding TMPRSS2 and HAT were obtained from Gary Whittaker (Cornell University, Ithaca).Antibodies, Stains, and Recombinant ProteinsFor high-throughput microscopy, we used \u03b1-nucleoprotein (NP) mAb (Millipore), AnnexinV-AlexaFluor-647 conjugate (Life Technologies), anti-phosphorylated H2AX (Pierce), SYTOX green dead cell stain (Life Technologies), and AlexaFluor-488 or \u2212647 secondary antibodies. To block spread of IAV in tissue culture, we used \u03b1-HA mAb 2G9 at 0.125 \u03bcg/ml (kind gift of Adolfo Garcia-Sastre). To neutralize PAI-1 in cell supernatants, we used rabbit polyclonal anti-PAI-1 (Abcam) at 50 or 10 \u03bcg/ml dilution, and rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch) as control. For visualization of HA in western blots, the following reagents were obtained through the NIH Biodefense and Emerging Infections Research Resources Repository, NIAID, NIH: Polyclonal anti-influenza virus H1 (H0) hemagglutinin (HA), A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1), antiserum, goat, NR-3148; polyclonal anti-influenza virus H2 hemagglutinin (HA), A/Singapore/1/1957 (H2N2), antiserum, goat, NR-4523; and polyclonal anti-influenza virus H5 hemagglutinin (HA), A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1), antiserum, goat, NR-2705.We used recombinant active human PAI-1 (carrying stabilizing mutations N150K, K154T, Q319L and M354I, Abcam) in tissue culture at 25 or 12 ng/ml final concentration and in in vitro assays at 1 \u03bcg/reaction. TPCK trypsin, human tryptase (both Sigma), recombinant HAT (R&D Systems), recombinant active furin (Abcam and NEB), and recombinant active urokinase plasminogen activator (both Abcam) were used in a 1:2 serial dilutions starting at 1\u03bcg/reaction.We used a stable form of rPAI-1, which carries four amino acid changes, prolonging its half-life from 2 to > 140 hr (Berkenpas et al., 1995). Target rPAI-1 levels in this experiment were chosen to reflect physiological concentrations, at 25 or 12.5 ng/ml, respectively.High-Throughput Microscopy Screening of Host Factor LibraryA549 cells in 96-well plates were transduced with the lentiviral ISG stocks for 2d, on duplicate plates, and then infected with IAV WSN/33 at 100 PFU/well (MOI 0.01). Puromycin selection of 10 \u03bcg/ml was applied from 60 min prior to IAV challenge until the end of the experiment to suppress virus production from untransduced cells. To detect single round infection, cells were fixed with 1.5% paraformaldehyde at 8-12 hpi, and to monitor viral spread, duplicate wells were fixed at 24 hpi. Cells were then permeabilized with Triton X-100 (0.1% in PBS), and stained for NP-positive cells and DAPI. Fish gelatin (0.2% in PBS) was used as blocking reagent, and all washing steps during immunostaining were performed using BioTek EL406 Plate Washer and Dispenser. 48 overlapping images per well were taken using the ImageXPressMICRO System (Molecular Devices), and images were stitched and analyzed for total (DAPI), transduced (RFP) and infected cells (Alexa488) with MetaXPress software V5.1.0.46. 24hpi values were normalized to their respective early values to account for differences in transduction efficiency and to determine the number of cells that were infected at late stages from one initially infected cell (\u201cfounder cell\u201d). For all ISG hit validation experiments, we generated lentiviral stocks that were independent from the primary screening preparations. When indicated in the respective figures, we modified the HTM protocol regarding cell type, virus and timing of time points.ISG Induction AssaysTo determine SERPINE1 mRNA expression and protein secretion kinetics, we treated A549 cells or HAE cultures with the following conditions: IFN-\u03b2 (Abcam) at 1pmol/ml, TGF-\u03b2 (Abcam) at 1 pg/ml, IAV WSN/33 infection at MOI 1 (A549) or 0.1 (HAE). mRNA levels, normalized to housekeeping gene RPS-11, were determined by qRT-PCR (SuperScript III First Strand Synthesis System, Life Technologies) and SYBR green assay (Roche) as described previously. Primer sequences can be found in Table S3. Total PAI-1 protein levels from cell supernatants or cell lysates (1% Triton X-100 in PBS, sonication for 10 min) were measured by Human PAI-1 Platinum ELISA (BD Biosciences). mPAI-1 levels from mouse lung homogenates were measured by PAI-1 total mouse ELISA kit (Abcam).InhibitorsAll inhibitors used in tissue culture were titrated for toxicity (by Sytox stain, AnnexinV stain, PrestoBlue assay) and subsequently used at the highest possible, non-cytotoxic dose. Diphyllin (ChemDiv) was used to block IAV entry at 10 \u03bcM, and Ribavirin at 500 \u03bcM as replication inhibition control, respectively. Triplaxtinin (PAI-039, Axonmedchem) was used as PAI-1 inhibitor for in vitro assays at 10 \u03bcM. JAK inhibitor 1 (Calbiochem) was used at 500 ng/ml in SeV-GFP spread assays.Virus Infection MediaUnless stated otherwise, the following media was used during virus infections on A549 cells: DMEM, 0.3% BSA (Equitech), 0.1% FBS, Pen/Strep, 1 \u03bcg/ml TPCK-trypsin. For infection of human fibroblasts, we used DMEM, 0.3% protease-free BSA (Sigma), 0.1% FBS, Pen/Strep, and 1\u03bcg/ml TPCK-trypsin. For infection in serum-free conditions on BHK cells, MEM with Pen/Strep was used, with or without addition of 1 \u03bcg/ml TPCK, as indicated. We used serum-free overlay for plaque assay on MDCK cells: DMEM, 0.00001% DEAE, 0.0001% NaHCO3, GlutaMax, NEAA, 0.5\u03bcg/ml TPCK, 1.2% avicel (or 1% oxoid agar).IAV Life-Cycle AssaysWe transduced A549 with the indicated lentiviruses, and performed all assays 2d after. For the mini genome assay, transduced cells were transfected, in a 24-well format, with pCAGGS constructs for IAV WSN/33 PB1, PB2, PA (100 ng each), and NP or empty pCAGGS (200ng), as well as the RNA polymerase II-driven Renilla luciferase reporter pRLTK (40 ng), and the IAV-specific RNA polymerase I-driven firefly luciferase reporter (pPolI-luc, 60 ng). Diphyllin or Ribavirin were added as controls 4h before transfection and until the end of the experiment. Cells were harvested 20h post-transfection, lysed and assayed using Dual Luciferase Assay Kit (Promega).For determination of egress efficiency, transduced A549 were challenged with IAV WSN/33 at MOI 0.1. At 24 hpi, cells were harvested for quantitation of intracellular vRNA and supernatants for determination of extracellular vRNA and number of infectious particles. Viral RNA was extracted with RNeasy kit (QIAGEN, for cells) or QIAmp Viral RNA kit (QIAGEN, for supernatants). For genome quantification by Taqman RT-PCR we used RealTime ready RNA Virus Master (Roche); primer and probe sequences can be found in Table S3. The number of infectious particles in the supernatants were determined by plaque assay on MDCK cells using avicel overlay and crystal violet staining (A/WSN/33), or agar overlay followed by NP-immunostaining (A/PR/8/1934).HA Cleavage and Specific Infectivity AssaysFor HA cleavage assays with trypsin and rPAI, BHK cells were transfected in 6-well plates in serum-free MEM, with either 4 \u03bcg pCAGGS encoding HAPR8. At 48h post-transfection, MEM was replaced by fresh MEM, MEM containing 5 \u03bcg/ml TPCK, or MEM containing a mix of 5 \u03bcg/ml TPCK and 20 \u03bcg/ml rPAI (previously incubated for 1h at 37\u00b0C). Cells were incubated for 60 min. Then, floating cells in media were collected by centrifugation, and remaining adherent cells were harvested with 1 ml/well of enzyme-free PBS-based dissociation reagent and scraping. For cleavage assays in the presence of TMPRSS2, BHK cells were transfected with 3 \u03bcg of respective HA plasmid, and 3 \u03bcg of SERPINE1/SERPINE1\u2217 plasmid plus 1 \u03bcg TMPRSS2 plasmid. At 48h post-transfection, 5 \u03bcg/ml trypsin were added to the control well for 30 min. Cells were then harvested by scraping, collected by centrifugation, and lysed in 1x NuPage loading buffer and reducing agent. HA cleavage was analyzed by western blot using antibody specific for the respective HA.For specific infectivity assays, BHK cells were co-transfected, in MEM, with previously published protease-encoding plasmids (HAT or TMPRSS2) and pcDNA-DEST40 plasmids encoding PAI-1 wild-type or mutant T356R. At 36h post-transfection, media was collected, cells were washed twice with PBS and infected in serum-free MEM with A/PR/8/1934 at MOI 0.5. After 1h of incubation, cells were washed again, and overlaid with the same media from before (containing PAI-1 and proteases). Supernatants were collected for plaque assay and vRNA at 24hpi. vRNA was determined by qRT-PCR, and FFU by focus forming assay. To rescue specific infectivity, a duplicate of supernatants was incubated with additional 2 \u03bcg/ml TPCK-trypsin in the dilution medium for 30 min prior to focus forming assay.MiceWild-type (C57BL/6J; referred to as B6) and Serpine\u2212/\u2212 mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (100 mg/10 mg/kg), and 36 LD50 IAV PR/8/1934 or WSN/33 virus, diluted in a volume of 35 \u03bcl, was administered intranasally. Dose-response experiments with PR8 and WSN in WT and KO mice had showed that 36 LD50 (corresponding 1000 PFU of PR8) was optimal to reveal the difference between WT and KO mice regarding weight loss, survival and viral titers. For VSV strain Indiana, 105 PFU per mouse were administered intranasally.Clinical signs were assessed by visual inspection, as well as daily weighing of the animals. Animals that became moribund and lost > 25% of their body weight as compared to day 0 were immediately euthanized.For the poly(I:C) challenge experiment, mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (100 mg/10 mg/kg), and 100 \u03bcg of poly(I:C) (InVivogen), diluted with PBS in a volume of 35 \u03bcl, was administered intranasally.For determination of virus lung titers and ISG mRNA profiles, animals were sacrificed at indicated time points, whole lungs were collected, homogenized in 500 \u03bcl PBS, and debris was spun down at 15,000 rpm for 10 min. Supernatants were analyzed by plaque assay and qRT-PCR. Primer sequences for mouse ISG SYBR green assays can be found in the Table S3.For pathology, following euthanasia by CO2 inhalation, the chest was opened and 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF) was injected in the trachea with a syringe and a 25 g needle until the lungs were expanded to their normal in situ size. The lungs were then immersed in 10% NBF, and 72h later were processed in ethanol and xylene, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 4 m thickness, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. One longitudinal section was obtained from each pair of lungs, and included the whole lungs and major airways. Slides were examined by a board-certified veterinary pathologist and bleeding was scored semiquantitatively: (0: absent, 1: minimal, 2: mild, 3: moderate, 4: marked).Primary Mouse Tracheal Epithelial Cell CultureIsolation and culture of primary mouse tracheal epithelial cell cultures (MTECs) were performed as previously described. Briefly, tracheas were washed with media, opened longitudinally, and then incubated in Ham\u2019s F-12 containing 3 mg/ml pronase for 18 hr at 4\u00b0C.Cells isolated by enzymatic treatment were then seeded onto 0.4 \u03bcm pore size clear polyester membrane (Corning) coated with a collagen solution. At confluence, media was removed from the upper chamber to establish an air-liquid interface (ALI). Fully differentiated, 14-20 day-old post-ALI cultures were used for experiments.For infection, the apical surface of MTEC cultures was washed extensively to remove accumulated mucins before inoculation with influenza A/X-31(H3N2) virus (MOI 10\u22126). After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 1 hr, the virus inoculum was removed and the cultures were incubated in complete growth medium. Aliquots of the supernatants were collected at different time points for virus titration.RNA was isolated from MTEC cultures by directly lysing the cells in the transwells, using the QIAGEN RNeasy mini kit, according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Total RNA was reverse-transcribed using the ThermoScript RT-PCR System kit (Invitrogen). The cDNA served as template for the amplification of genes of interest and the housekeeping gene (Hprt1) by real-time PCR, using TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems), universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and the ABI-PRISM 7900 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). The fold increase in mRNA expression was determined using the \u0394\u0394Ct method relative to the values in mock treated samples, after normalization to Hprt1 gene expression. Virus was quantified by qPCR for the Matrix gene; primer sequences can be found in Table S3. Alternatively, virus was titrated on MDCK cells by the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50), by eight replicates of 10-fold serial dilutions, according to the Spearman-Karber method.",
