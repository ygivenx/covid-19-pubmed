Despite\nthe success story of vaccination and other public health interventions, the\nnumber of susceptible individuals has grown to date following cessation of\nroutine vaccination, and the threat of bioterrorist attack has led to debates\non countermeasures in such an event [2]. Various mathematical studies have been\nconducted as part of a preparedness program, including large-scale simulation of\na bioterrorist attack and the public health countermeasures against it [3\u20136]. Theoretical\nstudies on the spread of smallpox include not only simulations but also\nquantitative analysis of historical data [7\u201310]. A\nstatistical modeling study suggests that a small outbreak could be contained only\nimplementing contact tracing and isolation [11]. Moreover, those who underwent\nvaccination in the past are believed to be still protected against severe and\nfatal manifestations of smallpox even today [7, 12].",

            "text": "The best available evidence stems from a series of studies by Sir Leonard\nRogers (1868\u20131962) [16], who\nconducted epidemiologic surveys of smallpox outbreaks in India\nover a long period of time [17\u201319]. He also conducted\na similar survey in England and Wales [20]. By analyzing the monthly mortality data from the late 19th to the early\n20th century in these countries, Rogers argued that the smallpox epidemic in India is relatively \nuniform (i.e., not apparently cyclical) compared to that in England and Wales [17, 19, 21]. Further, he\ndescriptively and implicitly suggested that there is a negative correlation\nbetween humidity and smallpox mortality, but there was little association\nbetween smallpox and rainfall [17, 18]. This effort was followed by Russell and\nSundararajan [22] who supported the notion that a dry environment offers\nfavorable conditions for smallpox transmission. These consistent findings have also\nbeen reported during the Smallpox Eradication Program (SEP), where a peak of smallpox\nincidence occurred from December to January in the Northern hemisphere (e.g., Indonesia and Bangladesh)\nand from May to June in the Southern hemisphere (e.g., Brazil) [23\u201326]. However, the\nobserved data during the SEP were greatly modified by intensive immunizations,\nand perhaps because of this, epidemics in other locations were not suggested to\nbe seasonal [26\u201328], leaving this issue yet to be clarified.",

Figure 1 shows the time series data\nby location with a monthly reporting interval.

The right-hand side of (1) represents\nsecondary transmissions at calendar time t,\nwhich are determined by the number of those who were infected at time t \u2212 \u03c4, I(t \u2212 \u03c4), and the magnitude of\nsecondary transmissions at time t, R(t). \nSince the data in the present study were recorded only monthly, the equation\nhas to be simplified to comply with discrete points of time data. From the\nbeginning of the history of mathematical modeling of smallpox in the late 19th\ncentury [50], cases tended to be modeled by generation, the idea of which is\napplied as follows. Given the number of cases in generation i, I\ni, the expected number of cases in generation i + 1,\nE(I\ni+1) is given by(2)E(Ii+1)=RiIi, where R\ni is the effective reproduction number of generation i [51]. That is, the reproduction number\nis simply given by ratio of successive generations of cases, which was\nimplicitly understood in history by a pioneering epidemiologist, Clare Oswald\nStallybrass (1881\u20141951) who\napplied the theory to analyze the seasonality of various infectious diseases\n[52, 53]. Since the mean generation time of smallpox is approximately 15 days\n(i.e., half a month) [50, 54], monthly data contains exactly two generations. Let\nus consider three successive generations, i, i + 1, and i + 2. Given the reproduction numbers R\ni and R\ni+1, we get(3)E(Ii+1)=RiIi,E(Ii+2)=Ri+1Ii+1. Considering that the generations i and i + 1 are grouped together and reported in\nthe same month j, the reproduction\nnumber cannot be estimated by generation i. \nInstead, by assuming that the reproduction numbers in the successive\ngenerations are identical, that is, R\ni = R\ni+1(:= R\nj), (3) can be rearranged as(4)E(Ii+1)=RjIi,E(Ii+2)=RjIi+1. The expected number of cases in the next generation i + 3 is given\nby product of I\ni+2 and the\nreproduction number in the next month j + 1, R\nj+1, that is,(5)E(Ii+3)=Rj+1Ii+2. Given (4) and (5), the number\nof cases in month j + 1, C\nj+1(:= I\ni+2 + I\ni+3)\nis given using C\nj(:= I\ni + I\ni+1), that is,(6)E(Cj+1)=E(Ii+2+Ii+3)=(1+Rj+1)Ii+2=(1+Rj+1)RjIi+1=(1+Rj+1)Rj2Ii=(1+Rj+1)Rj2Cj1+Rj. We assume that the expected\nvalues are sufficient to characterize Poisson distributions. This assumption\nindicates that the conditional distribution of the reported number of cases in\nmonth j + 1, C\nj+1, given\nC\nj is given by(7)Cj+1 \u2223 Cj\u223cPoisson[(1+Rj+1)Rj21+RjCj]. Thus, for the observation of\ncases (or deaths with a 1 month lag) from month 0 to N, the likelihood of estimating R\nj is given by(8)L=constant\u00d7\u220fj=0N\u22121[(1+Rj+1)Rj21+RjCj]Cj+1 \u00d7exp [\u2212(1+Rj+1)Rj21+RjCj]. By minimizing the negative\nlogarithm of (8), the maximum likelihood estimates of the monthly-approximated\nreproduction numbers, R\nj were obtained.",

This finding is consistent\nwith implicit suggestions which have accumulated in the historical literature\n[1, 17, 19]. Whereas the data from The Hague and\nBerlin did not offer the relevant interpretations, their periodic peaks were also observed\nduring the winter seasons. Assuming that these records captured mainly the\nlarge periodic outbreaks alone, it is plausible that the old data were\naccompanied by underreporting during less intensive years, and thus, did not\nprecisely contain subtle seasonal fluctuations. Given that the seasonal force\nof infection was obvious even in the short-term epidemic data from the entire Netherlands, \nnot only endemic but also epidemic smallpox would greatly vary with the season\nand most likely would be enhanced by dry weather. Historically, virologists\nattempted to attribute the annual cycle to the seasonal preference of the variola\nvirus [56\u201358]. To date, it\nis known that the variola virus could survive in an infective state under\ndifferent conditions of temperature and humidity [56, 57]. However, as temperature\nand humidity rise above 30\u00b0C and 55%, respectively, the virus is known to\nimmediately lose infectivity [57]. Such a virological explanation supports the epidemiologic\nfindings from this present study and reasonably explains the seasonal\npreference of the virus as a factor behind the seasonality of outbreaks. The\nabove-mentioned point implies that we cannot ignore the seasonality even in the\nevent of a short-term reintroduction of variola virus due to bioterrorist\nattack.",

One approach to resolve this issue is to employ a Bayesian method,\nexplicitly dealing with dependence in a Poisson regression model [59], which is,\nhowever, computationally complicated for nonspecialists. As an alternative, the\npresent study suggested the use of R(t). R(t) reasonably reflects time-dependent\nchanges in the susceptible fraction of the population in question and other various\nfactors determining the transmission (including seasonality) [60, 61]. In\nparticular, it should be noted that R(t) does not reflect onset or death but\ncan represent an infection event with time, proving its potential as a marker\nto model seasonal and periodic transmission cycles. In addition, quantitative\nassessment of R(t) is theoretically important, because the amplitude of seasonal\nforces of infection characterizes the length of the interepidemic period\n[33, 62, 63]. A continued super-annual cycle mathematically requires seasonally\nvarying forces of infection, which determines the season-specific threshold\ncondition [64] and evolutionary dynamics of a disease [65, 66]. To the best of\nour knowledge, the present study is the first to suggest a quantitative method to\nreasonably extract the amplitude using the notation of R(t) and extending the previous\nefforts of Stallybrass [53].",

At least, experimental evidence supports the role of dry weather in the dynamics of influenza [67, 68]; a recent study found that low (dry) relative humidity in the range of 20 to 30% produced the spread of the influenza virus faster than at relative humidity in higher percentages. In fact, at a humidity of 80% or above, the study found no spread of the flu [68]. Since there are also various social factors which vary\nwith the season, the seasonal preference of pathogens cannot be captured\nwithout sufficiently highlighting the time-varying human contact patterns, and\nthus, further analyses (e.g., reanalysis of small-scale outbreaks where we can\nadjust the contact frequency) are needed.
