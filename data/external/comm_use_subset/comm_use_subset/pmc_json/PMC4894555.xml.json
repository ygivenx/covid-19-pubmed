Maternal near miss (MNM) is any situation in which a woman survives a very severe complication with proven organ dysfunction, during pregnancy or puerperium (42 days after childbirth), with at least one of the following criteria: clinical (e.g., shock or clotting disorder), laboratory (lactate > 5, PaO2/FiO2 < 200 mmHg) or management (hysterectomy due to infection or hemorrhage and blood transfusion \u2265 5 units of packed red blood cells). Severe Maternal Outcome (SMO) accounts for cases of MNM plus Maternal Deaths (MD) [6].",

Obstetric transition is important to help understand the occurrence of severe maternal morbidity and provide patients with the appropriate treatment in different settings.",

Overall, the prevalence of respiratory disease was rare (5 %). Nevertheless, respiratory disease accounted for one-quarter of MNM cases and two-thirds of MD. Worse adverse outcomes occurred among cases of confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09, with an impressive MNM:MD ratio below one, meaning that there were more deaths than near miss cases in this group.",

The MI is known to correlate to quality of care and when the index is above 20 %, it represents substandard care [22]. Numbers of MI over 50 % most likely reflect that poor outcomes were not only due to the severity of disease, but also to substandard care, including delays in diagnosis and management of the considered cases. Our data further confirmed that the increased risk of SMO was linked to delays in health care (delays due to women/family members, health services or health professionals).",

Brazil followed these recommendations and launched a national vaccination campaign before the winter of 2010, targeted at high-risk groups, including pregnancy. The vaccine was available in all public health facilities, at no cost for the patient and reached very high coverage (around 80 %), most likely due to the long term experience in the National Immunization Program for Children and due to the awareness about the severity of the disease, among health professionals and among the society [23]. We cannot evaluate the impact of those preventive measures in our study, since we lack information on the total number of cases and specific data on individual history of vaccination or treatment, however, from our Fig. 2, we can see on the linear traces that there is a trend towards decrease in numbers of severe cases, through time, especially after vaccination.",
