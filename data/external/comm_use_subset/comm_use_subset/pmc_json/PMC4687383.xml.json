Another possibility is translocation of bacteria from the intestinal tract [3], given that the patient had concurrent severe diarrhea caused by whipworm infection, which could have damaged the gut/blood barrier. A final possibility is that the whipworm infection may have made the dog more susceptible to anthroponotic infection and the bacteria may have been normal flora from a human in contact with the dog. In this case, P. acnes was not detected in urine via Gram staining. This was also demonstrated in a previous study [11], and should be taken into account when considering P. acnes infection as a differential.",
