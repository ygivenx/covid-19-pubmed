            "text": "Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) was first identified in a rectal swab collected in 2009 from a pig in Hong Kong, China, and is related to avian and Asian leopard deltacoronaviruses identified in apparently healthy wild animals [1\u20133]. Recently, PDCoV has been described in association with diarrhea in pigs across all production stages in North America [4\u20136]. Specifically, in February 2014, the Ohio Department of Agriculture issued a press release indicating that PDCoV was detected in swine feces from five separate pig farms in Ohio, with clinical signs of watery diarrhea in sows and enteric disease associated with increased mortality in piglets [4]. The presence of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) was ruled out but a portion of the samples were also positive for porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) [4]. In response to the impact of the newly emerging porcine coronaviruses PEDV [7,8] and PDCoV [4] in the U.S. pig population, the USDA issued a federal order requiring reporting of all novel cases associated with all porcine enteric coronaviruses effective June 5, 2014 [9]. In contrast to PEDV [10\u201312], the epidemiology, viral pathogenesis and clinical symptoms associated with PDCoV infection are still largely unknown. Nevertheless, preliminary results obtained after experimental infection of gnotobiotic pigs with this virus indicate severe clinical signs (diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration) and microscopic lesions consistent with coronavirus infection in the small intestines [13]. However, serological assays to undertake field based epidemiological studies are not available to date. Sequencing of the complete genome of U.S. PDCoV strains from different states indicates a nucleotide identity of approximately 99% when compared to the PDCoV sequence initially reported in China [6,14,15].",

In general, coronaviruses are enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses and contain four major structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) [17,18]. The S protein region of coronaviruses contains major neutralizing epitopes and also stimulates induction of neutralizing antibodies in the host [17,19,20]. Previously, the entire S protein or portions thereof have been successfully utilized for PEDV and TGEV ELISA development [21\u201324].",

Specifically, 60 serum samples were collected from 30 sows acutely affected by diarrhea and again four weeks later on Farm A. Another 120 serum samples were collected from Farms B and C in which pigs had been diagnosed with PDCoV at least two months prior to the serum collection (n = 60/farm). The last 30 samples came from PDCoV negative Farm D. The PDCoV infection status was determined based on real-time RT-PCR for PDCoV on fecal samples. PEDV, PRCV and TGEV RNA were not detected in the feces. All RT-PCRs were performed according to routinely performed standard protocols at the ISU-VDL. Farm A samples collected at the first time point and samples from the negative farm D were classified as negative (n = 60). Farm A samples collected at the second time point and samples from the two positive Farms B and C were classified as positive (n = 150).

Furthermore, in silico prediction of the PDCoV epitopes was performed and results were compared with the alphacoronavirus PEDV, TGEV and PRCV. As expected, the S1 protein contained the majority of the mapped epitopes within the coronavirus proteins known to elicit humoral response (E, M, N and S). In addition, a comparison of the amino acid identity between the expressed PDCoV S1 antigen for the developed ELISA and the other 19 PDCoV sequences in the GenBank indicated a similarity higher than 99% for the S1 polypeptide, which suggests that this segment is conserved enough to detect humoral responses directed to it.",

Anti-PDCoV antibodies and seroconversion were detected within four weeks of initial observation of clinical disease and detection of PDCoV RNA in fecal samples. Ideally, the cut-off value should be derived by testing a panel of samples obtained from reference animals with known history and infection status relative to the disease [29]. Due to difficulties in classifying pigs from farms as true negative, i.e. no previous exposure to PDCoV which would have required to obtain fecal samples over-time from an adequate number of pigs on the farm, samples from the start of perceived PDCoV outbreaks (PDCoV real-time RT-PCR positive pigs) were considered to be seronegative for test development purposes. Although this strategy was sufficient to confirm diagnosis of acute infection as seroconversion was detected in paired samples from PDCoV outbreaks, the lack of a second serological assay and known negative samples did not permit a precise estimation of the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the test. Selecting a single arbitrary cut-off value entirely on the basis of field samples and association with clinical history and RT-PCR results could result in a loss of sensitivity and/or specificity. To further address this, the established cut-off value of 0.34 was evaluated using the cumulative data of 573 samples originating from seronegative farms (classified as negative due to absence of any PDCoV ELISA positive pig among the pigs tested) by calculating the average OD (data not shown). It was determined that the adoption of this method obtained lower cut-off value (0.24; OD average \u00b1 3 \u00d7 SD; average \u00b1 SD 0.09 \u00b1 0.05), and provided a greater sensitivity. Therefore, samples with an OD value between 0.24 and 0.34 should perhaps be considered inconclusive. The lack of a gold standard for PDCoV antibody detection further contributes to the problem in establishing an appropriated cut-off and accurately measure the sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA developed herein.",

Access to archived serum samples can be limited and to overcome this issue, archived porcine plasma samples were also used in this study. While the PEDV assay was not validated on plasma, evidence in the literature suggests that the degree of antibody detection in serum and plasma is essentially identical [31\u201334]. Overall, the obtained data suggest that PDCoV has been circulating in the North American pig population prior to 2013 without being recognized. Specifically, antibodies to PDCoV were detected in archived serum and plasma samples from 2010, whereas anti-PDCoV IgG antibodies were not detected in serum samples collected in 2011 or 2012. This could be due to the limited number of available retrospective serum samples in combination with an overall low PDCoV seroprevalence. Alternatively, the positive samples collected in 2010 could be false positive; however, at least one sample presented a high OD value. Upon availability of another PDCoV serological test in the future these results will need to be confirmed.",
