It mainly gives rise to encephalomyelitis or vomiting and wasting disease in piglets. As a neurotropic virus, it spreads via the peripheral to the central nervous system (CNS), resulting in neurological damage by virus infection (Andries and Pensaert, 1980). Nervous lesions caused by pathogens often lead to abnormal nerve cell morphology, unnatural protein accumulation, vesicular transport or neuronal gene transcription disorders, and synaptic transmission obstacles (Xilouri and Stefanis, 2010). Similarly, as a virus invading the nervous system, rabies virus (RABV) can cause severe encephalitis and induce analogous cytopathic features (Peng et al., 2016). Although, some studies of PHEV pathogenesis have been performed, the underlying mechanism of PHEV replication is still poorly elucidated. Therefore, a more detailed description of the mechanism should be revealed, especially the biological changes of the host cells induced by infection.",

Among the intracellular membrane transport pathway, the corresponding cytoplasmic proteins and cargos are delivered to the lysosomes (Levine et al., 2011). As a cytoprotective process, autophagy is an inherent host defense mechanism against viral aggression, which helps to maintain cell homeostasis in response to multiple external stress stimuli, containing a nutrient-poor environment, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, especially pathogen infection (Kroemer et al., 2010). Dysfunction in autophagy has been associated with many illnesses that infect humans such as neurodegeneration diseases, cancer, metabolic syndrome, lysosomal diseases, and aging (Rubinsztein et al., 2011).",

            "text": "Previous studies have indicated that autophagy not only protects cells under stressful conditions, but also plays an important part in the process of pathogen infection (Shintani and Klionsky, 2004). Some viruses have also developed strategies to reverse the autophagy defense pathway. US11, a late gene of herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1), blocks the formation and development of autophagosomes in both fibroblasts and HeLa cells. US11 also interacts with PKR to suppress autophagy (Lussignol et al., 2013). Nevertheless, there are viruses that utilize autophagosomes for promoting their replication, such as in poliovirus infection, where the formation of autophagosomes provides a conservative platform for viral replication (Suhy et al., 2000). Conversely, in the Sindbis virus and tobacco mosaic virus infections, autophagy successfully suppresses viral replication (Liu et al., 2005). More interestingly, several coronaviruses can hijack the important autophagy-related protein LC3-I and endoplasmic reticulum vesicle structures for their replication (Reggiori et al., 2010) using the same mechanism as rotavirus (Crawford et al., 2012). This mechanism induced by viral proteins is associated with their own pathogenic non-structural proteins, exemplified by the infectious bursal disease virus infection (Hu et al., 2015). However, whether PHEV, as a member of the coronavirus family, infection is associated with autophagy is unknown. In this study, we confirmed that PHEV infection induces atypical autophagy and leads to the accumulation of autophagosomes while blocking their fusion with lysosomes, which creates conditions for the virus to replicate within nerve cells.",

The Neuro-2a cells were transfected with GFP-LC3 and prepared for rapamycin for 6 h or PHEV-infection (Figure 1B). In the mock-infected Neuro-2a cells, GFP-LC3 shows a diffuse distribution (Figure 1B). PHEV infection leads to the accumulation of autophagosomes in cells, as observed by GFP-LC3 punctate redistribution. Similarly, short-term treatment with rapamycin efficiently induced autophagy, resulting in GFP-LC3 puncta formation in ~40% of cells (Figure 1C). To further corroborate the finding that PHEV induces autophagy, we measured the expression of LC3-I and LC3-II in cells by western blotting. Consistent with the GFP-LC3 fluorescence and TEM data, an increase of LC3-II was detected in the rapamycin treated and PHEV-infected cells (Figure 1D).",

The neurological dysfunction by PHEV infection, results in neurological symptoms, vomiting and other clinical features. Some cases also accompanied with the characteristics of diarrhea, but whether the infection is associated with nerve injury is not yet clear (Li et al., 2016). In a previous study, we found that the invasion of nerve cells by PHEV is mediated by the S protein and neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), which is an adhesion molecule on the nerve cell surface (Gao et al., 2010; Dong et al., 2015). However, the specific mechanism by which the virus invades and replicates in nerve cells remains ill-defined. Autophagy plays a vital role in the replication of DNA and RNA viruses (Dreux and Chisari, 2010). Many RNA viruses induce autophagy in order to produce the membrane-associated replication complexes (Miller and Krijnse-Locker, 2008). During the coronavirus infection, LC3 could be recruited to form double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) from the ER (Reggiori et al., 2010). These DMVs appear to have a subcellular structure similar to the autophagosome, which is called a \u201cvirus factories\u201d in a recent study. These viral factories provide a suitable platform for the replication and encourage autophagy, implying that a covered connection between DMVs and autophagy (Blanchard and Roingeard, 2015).

            "text": "Autophagy is often closely related to viral replication, and several viruses use autophagic substances or the autophagosome to escape the immune system in order to achieve viral proliferation, while others use the autophagosome or autophagic vesicle model structure as its own site for genome transcription and replication (Jackson et al., 2005). Therefore, the development of autophagy often contributs to the proliferation of the virus (Levine and Kroemer, 2008). Several studies have determined the mechanism of virus-induced autophagy, such as influenza A virus. The virus inhibits the autophagic degradation process, and its matrix protein 2 plays a key role in this process (Gannag\u00e9 et al., 2009). Rotavirus also blocks the maturation of autophagosomes and inhibits autophagy maturation, both of which may offer the rotavirus as a way for escaping the antiviral function of autophagy (Crawford et al., 2012). Recently, it has been reported that coronavirus membrane-associated papain-like protease PLP2 (PLP2-TM) could promote autophagy. In addition, the interaction between PLP2-TM with Beclin 1 affected the replication of the coronavirus, and further regulated the innate immune defense mechanism against viruses. (Chen et al., 2014). The similar phenomenon is shown in our results which demonstrated that PHEV could activate the appearance of autophagosome but influence its fusion with lysosomes.",

The term \u201cautophagic flux\u201d is used to denote the dynamic process of autophagosome synthesis, the delivery of autophagic cargoes to the lysosome, and the degradation of autophagic cargoes inside the lysosome and is a more reliable indicator of autophagic activity than measurements of autophagosome numbers. Some recent studies have demonstrated that the induction of autophagy not only increases autophagosome formation and expression of autophagy proteins but also increases autophagic flux, which can be measured by detecting the levels of p62 (Pankiv et al., 2007). Using several means of measuring autophagic flux, including p62 degradation, LC3-II turnover, and GFP-LC3 lysosomal delivery and proteolysis, we confirmed that autophagic flux remained unchanged upon PHEV infection. The cells were infected with PHEV after CQ treatment, the level of LC3-II was increased, but PHEV infection was suppressed. The effect of CQ treatment may be related to its inhibition of autophagic proteolysis by suppressing acidification of lysosomes and endosomes. Cellular entry of coronaviruses is dependent on clathrin-mediated endocytosis, CQ treatment may block viral genome release from the lysosome into the cytoplasm for replication (Burkard et al., 2014). This may also be another dominant effect of CQ. These findings illustrate that an incomplete autophagy is activated in Neuro-2a cells by PHEV infected, like we mentioned as \u201catypical autophagy\u201d above, and this autophagy induced by PHEV is involved in viral replication.",

On the other hand, such a seemingly contradictory process precisely sets the stage in the formation of early autophagy rather than the autophagolysosome. It may also be an evolutionary mechanism in which the virus escapes the immune system. Our studies provide insights into PHEV-host interactions and may develop a theoretical basis for further study between the virus and autophagy.
