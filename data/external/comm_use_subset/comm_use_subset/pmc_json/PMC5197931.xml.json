Influenza A and B, human rhinoviruses (HRV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenoviruses (ADV) and parainfluenza virus (PIV) are common respiratory viruses in adults and children [1\u20135]. Of respiratory infections, influenza is the most well studied viral infection, and is commonly reported (around 50%) as the cause of epidemics of respiratory infection, including nosocomial outbreaks [6]. Influenza virus is commonly isolated from febrile paediatric and elderly patients presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI) and acute respiratory illness (ARI) symptoms [1]. The accepted clinical case definition of ILI includes fever, which may be suitable for identifying paediatric cases, but less so for adults.",

            "text": "Fever is thought of as the most common presenting symptom of influenza in hospital emergency departments; however, the presence of fever depends on the age of person and the type of virus [7\u201310]. It is known that fever is less common in adults than children with influenza, and that adults may have atypical presentations [5, 6, 11]. In a matched case-control study in Finland, 317 laboratory-confirmed influenza cases and 353 controls with respiratory symptoms were recruited in children aged \u2a7d13 years. Fever was present in 89\u00b78% (317/353) and 35\u00b77% (126/353) of cases and controls, respectively [12]. In contrast to this, fever is not a common presentation in adults with laboratory-confirmed influenza. Monto et al. [13] examined clinical trial data of 3744 adult ILI cases (defined as body temperature \u2a7e37\u00b78 \u00b0C or patients subjective feeling of feverishness) and of those 2470 (66%) had laboratory-confirmed influenza. Fever (\u2a7e37\u00b78 \u00b0C) was reported in 68% of laboratory-confirmed influenza cases, compared to 40% other ILI cases [13]. During a randomized clinical trial (RCT) around the efficacy of facemask and hand hygiene in the household setting, 44% (15/34) of secondary cases with influenza A and 32% (8/25) of cases with influenza B had fever history [14]. The rate of fever was 66% (137/207) in hospitalized influenza cases in a US study [15]. Another US study showed that less than half (42\u00b74%) of healthcare workers (HCWs) with laboratory-confirmed influenza presented with fever [5]. Fever is a less common presenting symptom in elderly people which may lead to diagnostic and treatment delays [16]. In patients admitted with myocardial infarction, 9% had unrecognized and undiagnosed influenza on testing at admission, highlighting the low level of clinical suspicion of influenza [17].",

            "text": "We have shown, using prospectively collected data, that the rate of fever in adults with confirmed viral respiratory infections is much lower than described in children [1, 9]. The standard clinical case definition of ILI requires fever to be present \u2013 the majority of influenza cases in this series would have been missed using the ILI definition. This has implications for effective triage, early antiviral treatment and preventive measures for adults with influenza, particularly during outbreaks and pandemic situations. For other respiratory infections, clinical case definitions need to be more sensitive, or >75% of cases will be missed. The main implication for future surveillance, measurements and research studies is that the ILI case definition in adults may be highly insensitive. For some types of surveillance systems, this may not be an issue, but for diagnostic screening in event of an emerging viral infection (such as for triage and implementation of infection control protocols) [24, 25], a more sensitive case definition is needed.",

However, this variation may be due to different study base, case definition and viral strains, as well as the prospective measurement of incident infections. Many research studies use fever as an inclusion criterion for laboratory testing [13, 26]. While this may be suitable for studies in children, it is not adequately sensitive for studies of adults, as we have shown the majority of confirmed cases will be missed. The cut-off point for fever could be another factor in sensitivity. Some studies have set lower cut-off points for fever, and report higher rates of fever in laboratory-confirmed influenza cases [13, 27]. Carrat et al. collected data of cases presented in 35 general practices in France and collected nasal swabs from suspected influenza cases and defined fever as \u2a7e37\u00b78 \u00b0C. They found fever in influenza A(H3N2), influenza A(H1N1) and influenza negative cases in 95\u00b72%, 77\u00b75% and 72\u00b77%, respectively. Applying a cut-off of \u2a7e38\u00b72 \u00b0C, the corresponding rates are 82\u00b72%, 59\u00b73% and 43\u00b79% [27]. Symptoms of feverishness (subjective feeling of fever) are included in ILI definitions in some cases [13].",

Smoking increases the risk of viral and bacterial infections through changes in respiratory epithelial and altered immune response [40\u201343].The risk of influenza also increases several times in smokers, compared to non-smokers [40]. Atypical clinical presentation of influenza and other respiratory infections in adults could be due to altered structural and immune response associated with active/passive smoking and other environmental hazards. The mechanism by which smoking increases the risk of fever is not clear. High rates of fever in smokers may also be due changes in immunoglobulin levels which could increase viral load. The severity of symptoms generally increases when high viral load is detected in the blood [44].",

Lower fever rates in Chinese HCWs in this study might be due to due to differences in circulating viruses (and their pyrogenicity) between the two countries when the studies were conducted.
