One type of MLC, porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs), are the primary responders of the pulmonary innate immune system and defend against various pathogens\n[14]. While PAMs are known to be involved in PCV2 defense, the underlying molecular mechanisms of PCV2 pathogenicity remain to be completely elucidated. Furthermore, an immunosuppressive role has been characterized for PCV2 in porcine circovirus diseases (PCVD)\n[15,16], but little is known about the genes that are involved in this process. The presence of granulomatous inflammation and multinucleated giant cells in PMWS pigs\n[16] suggests a significant role for secreted cytokines and other immune-related signaling factors. Previous studies have investigated the cytokine and chemokine gene expression profile of PMWS by transcriptomic and genomic analyses. For example, the cytokine mRNA expression profile in lymph nodes of PMWS pigs was reported\n[17], as was the global transcriptome profile of colostrums-deprived piglets experimentally infected with PCV2\n[18,19]. The genomic expression profile in lymph nodes of lymphoid-depleted PCV2-infected pigs was also reported\n[20]. However, these results can not fully illustrate the pathogenesis of PCV2.",

All RNA samples were considered to be of high quality, based on RNA integrity number (RIN) values (ranging from 8.0 to 9.4). The isolated mRNA samples from 24 HPI and 48 HPI PAMs hybridized to 6345 and 5856 probe sets on the transcriptome microarray, respectively corresponding to 34.25% and 31.65% of all probe sets (Additional file\n1: Table S1). After quantile normalization and statistical analysis, 1277 transcripts were identified (false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted p-value <0.05). Furthermore, the criteria of a two-fold or greater change in differential expression and a FDR of 5% were chosen to determine up-regulated and down-regulated genes. According to these criteria, 266 and 175 genes were differentially expressed (DE) from baseline at 24 HPI and 48 HPI (Additional file\n2: Table S2 and Additional file\n3: Table S3). According to the corresponding biological process Gene Ontology (GO) terms, or potential biological processes reported in recent publications, the majority of these genes were related to Immune Response, Inflammatory Response, Antigen Processing and Presentation of Peptide or Polysaccharide Antigen via MHC Class II, Anti-viral Immune response, Cell Motility, and Negative Regulation of Apoptosis (Table \n1). However, the differential expression between 24 HPI and 48 HPI reached the threshold of statistical significance for only six of those genes (Additional file\n4: Table S4 and Additional file\n5: Table S5). A total of 17 differentially expressed genes were selected to validate the microarray results by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) using the primers in Table \n2. The qRT-PCR results confirmed, in general, the patterns of up-regulated and down-regulated expression of the 17 genes that was indicated by the microarray analysis (Table \n3).",

To date, 13 TLRs have been identified and characterized for their particular cognate ligands and signaling cascades to trigger pathogen-targeted immune responses\n[28]. For example, TLR7 recognizes guanosine- and uridine-rich sequences derived from ssRNA viruses\n[29], while TLR9 recognizes single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) in endosomal compartments and signals to induce the production of type 1 interferons (IFNs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines; PCV2 DNA has been shown to modulate cytokine secretion thorough interaction with TLR9\n[30]. In our study of the circular, single-stranded DNA virus, PCV2, differential gene expression of TLRs was found. Specifically, PCV2 infection of PAMs led to increased expression of TLR1, TLR4 cofactor CD14, and TLR9. Monocytic CD14 signaling is usually activated upon exposure to bacterial LPS, and this molecule\u2019s up-regulation may induce ineffective antibacterial immunity. In addition, a similar mechanism has been demonstrated in human monocytic cells upon exposure to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus\n[31]. These receptors\u2019 up-regulation may contribute to the increased sensitivity of macrophages to other pathogens, thereby augmenting the inflammation and host immune response. Such an enhanced immune response may be beneficial, but an over-stimulation of the innate response could result in tissue damage. For example, the same phenomenon was observed upon macrophage exposure to tobacco smoke, wherein the expression of TLR3 was increased and severe inflammation was observed after treated with TLR3 ligand\n[32].",

Thus, macrophage infiltration has been suggested as an important feature of the pathogenesis and progression of PMWS\n[56].",

            "text": "Recruitment of inflammatory cells in injured tissue is regulated by various cytokines and chemokines. PMWS-affected pigs present with increased expression of MIP-1, CCL-2, IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1 mRNA in the lymphoid tissues and PBMCs, suggesting that such cytokines and chemokines may contribute to the development of granulomatous lymphadenitis and recruitment of macrophages or other inflammatory cells to the PCV2-infected tissues\n[17,52,57]. The PCV2-infected PAMs in our study showed up-regulation of MIP-1, CCL-2, IL-1\u03b2, IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1 mRNA expression. TNF-\u03b1 is known to activate microvascular endothelium and cause a pyrexic response\n[47]. Increased production of TNF-\u03b1 may induce fever and respiratory distress in PCV2-infected pigs\n[58,59]. IL-8 is a chemoattractant for neutrophils and other polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) that are produced following acute infection\n[60]. Interaction of IL-8 and MCP-1/CCL-2 is also known to trigger tight adhesion of monocytes to vascular endothelium under flow conditions\n[61]. The ability of PCV2 to induce IL-8 production in PAMs or PBMCs has been previously reported\n[57,62,63]. Similar to IL-8, the PAM-derived chemokine AMCF-II/CXCL5\n[64] is able to recruit PMNs to a lesion area\n[65]. Unlike the PMN-derived chemoattractants discussed above, MCP-1 is a powerful chemoattractant for monocytes and its activities can be further enhanced by IL-8\n[61]. It is reasonable to speculate that the development of interstitial pneumonia in pigs suffering from naturally-acquired PMWS or experimental infection of PCV2 may result from the recruitment of acute phase inflammatory cells and subsequent mononuclear phagocytic cells from blood vessels to interalveolar septa and alveolar spaces by up-regulated cytokines and chemokines released from PCV2-containing PAMs.",

It has a potent antiviral property that contributes to the control of acute viral infections, and is an important mediator of cellular responses. IFN\u03b3 mRNA was found to be slightly down-regulated at the early stage of in vitro PCV2 infection (24 HPI) of PAMs. This repressed expression may be indicative of suppressed Th1 responses, which may facilitate viral persistence and delayed viral clearance. At the late stage of in vitro infection (48 HPI), however, the IFN\u03b3 expression level increased. Such an up-regulation of expression may indicate a virus-modulated mechanism to enhance infection and replication at the late stage of PCV2 infection in vivo[39].",

Ficher\u2019s exact test was used to calculate a p-value determining the probability that each biofunction assigned to that data set is due to chance alone. Genes from the dataset that met the fold change cut-off of 2.0 were considered for the analysis. The score is the probability that a collection of proteins equal to or greater than the number in a network could be achieved by chance alone. A score of 3 indicates that there is a 1/1000 chance that the focus proteins are in a network due to random chance, therefore, score of 3 or higher have a 99.9% confidence of not being generated by random chance alone.",
