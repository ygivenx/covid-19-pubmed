HCV, a hepacivirus member of the Flaviviridae family and an enveloped virus, is encoded by a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome [14]. Viral RNA is directly translated by the host machinery into a single polyprotein, which is cleaved by host and virus-encoded proteases to release the individual structural (core, E1, and E2) and non-structural (NS) proteins (p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B) [15]. During infection, HCV-encoded proteins promote reorganization and accumulation of LDs in the perinuclear region of the cell [16]. The HCV core protein is targeted to LDs [17] and orchestrates the assembly and release of infectious viral particles during the late stages of infection [18]. Hence, disrupting the interaction of the HCV core protein with LDs compromises this essential stage within the HCV lifecycle [8], [10], [11].",

            "text": "Overstimulation of host lipid metabolism by HCV during infection is achieved through a variety of molecular mechanisms (reviewed in [27], [28], and [29]). For example, HCV employs multiple strategies to activate the sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) pathway, which is important for regulation of host lipid homeostasis [19], [30]\u2013[32]. SREBPs are endoplasmic reticulum (ER), membrane-anchored transcription factors that respond to changes in intracellular sterol levels through interactions with sterol-sensing proteins (reviewed in [33]). When sterol levels are high, SREBPs are retained as inactive precursors in the ER [34], [35]. Under low sterol conditions, SREBPs are escorted to the Golgi, where two resident endoproteases (subtilisin kexin isozyme/site-1 protease (SKI-1/S1P) and SREBP Site-2 protease (S2P); reviewed in [36] and see below) cleave the precursor polypeptide SREBP, allowing the release of transcriptionally active SREBP molecules from the ER [37], [38]. The released SREBP fragment migrates to the nucleus and binds to sterol response elements in the promoters of cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthetic target genes, and it activates their transcription [39]\u2013[41]. Activation of the SREBP pathway by HCV aids the virus lifecycle and may ultimately promote the development of steatosis and liver disease in chronically infected individuals [42], [43].",

SKI-1/S1P displays unique substrate specificity among the PC members by showing preferred cleavage after non-basic amino acids [47]. SKI-1/S1P cleaves at the carboxy-terminus of the peptidyl sequence Arg/Lys-Xaa3-Xaa2-Leu/Ser/Thr [48], where Xaa3 is any amino acid except Cys at the P3 position of the scissile peptide bond and Xaa2 is a hydrophobic amino acid containing an alkyl side chain at the P2 position [49]. In addition to the proteolytic processing of transcription factors [36], SKI-1/S1P participates in the proteolytic activation of viral-envelope glycoproteins of the Lassa virus [50], the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus [51], and the Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus [52]. Importantly, endoproteolytic processing of these viral glycoproteins by SKI-1/S1P is a critical step for the production of infectious progeny viruses, suggesting that SKI-1/S1P may represent an attractive target for therapeutic intervention against human pathogenic arenaviruses [47], [48], [50]\u2013[52].",

Because of our previous success with engineering serine protease inhibitors (serpins) to develop effective and selective PC inhibitors [54], [55], we hypothesized that engineering a naturally occurring serpin scaffold could also provide a powerful approach for developing selective SKI-1/S1P inhibitors. Serpins differ from non-serpin inhibitors in that they require a large inhibitor conformational change in order to trap proteases in an irreversible complex [56]. The conformational change is initiated by reaction of the active serine of the protease with the reactive center loop (RCL) of the serpin, which results in a covalent species involving an acyl ester linkage to the \u03b3O of the protease active site serine [57]. This cleaves the RCL, which then moves 71 \u00c5 to the opposite pole of the serpin, taking the tethered protease with it [57].",

The identification of Spn4A by our group as the most potent natural serpin inhibitor of the human PC furin (Ki,13 pM [58]) provides us with a novel and unique molecular tool for dissecting the contribution of SKI-1/S1P-dependent proteolytic activity in the secretory pathway to viral infection of eukaryotic cells. We report that engineering of the RCL of Spn4A to mimic the consensus sequence Arg/LysP4-Xaa3-Xaa2-Leu/Ser/ThrP1\u2193 for cleavage by SKI-1/S1P (Spn4A RCL: ArgP4-Arg-Lys-Arg\nP1\u2193 -> ArgP4-Arg-Leu-Leu\nP1\u2193) resulted in the development of Spn4A-RRLL, a novel, selective, and effective serpin-based inhibitor of SKI-1/S1P. We demonstrated the anti-proteolytic and anti-HCV activities of our new recombinant adenovirus-expressing Spn4A-RRLL \u201csecreted\u201d (s) variant directed at the secretory pathway SKI-1/S1P. Expression of Spn4A.RRLL(s) in Huh-7.5.1 cells results in a strong inhibition of the SKI-1/S1P-mediated activation of SREBP-1 and down-regulation of SREBP target gene products. As hypothesized, inhibiting SKI-1/S1P activity robustly blocked HCV infection of Huh-7.5.1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. We found that specific inhibition of SKI-1/S1P activity by Spn4A.RRLL(s) dramatically reduced the abundance of LDs in hepatoma cells. Use of the specific active site-directed small-molecule inhibitor of SKI-1/S1P, PF-429242, confirmed the results of our studies with the protein-based therapeutic Spn4A.RRLL(s), with a robust inhibition of HCV infection.",

We selected this novel Drosophila melanogaster serpin scaffold to engineer a novel protein-based inhibitor directed at the PC SKI-1/S1P. First, we cloned our pre-His/FLAG-tagged Spn4A construct [58] into an adenoviral shuttle vector to generate Spn4A.RRKR(r) (Figure 1A). Spn4A is a unique \u201cretained\u201d (r) serpin that presents, at its C-terminus, an HDEL sequence (Figure 1A), a functional variant of the C-terminal KDEL retention signal that directs secretory protein retention in the ER [59]. Because SKI-1/S1P cleavage of SREBP substrates occurs in the Golgi apparatus [35], we next needed to generate a \u201csecreted\u201d (s) variant of Spn4A, Spn4A.RRKR(s) (Figure 1A). We hypothesized that only an Spn4A (s) variant, which traffics through the late secretory pathway prior to secretion in the extracellular space, would encounter active SKI-1/S1P molecules in the early Golgi compartment. This was accomplished by inserting a stop codon before the C-terminal ER-retention signal, HDEL. Next, we employed site-directed mutagenesis to optimize the interactions between the RCL of Spn4A and the substrate binding sites of SKI-1/S1P. Residues at positions P2 and P1 of the Spn4A RCL \u201cbait\u201d region ArgP4-ArgP3-Lys\nP2-Arg\nP1\u2193 were substituted to generate ArgP4-ArgP3-Leu\nP2-Leu\nP1\u2193, thereby mimicking the Lassa virus glycoprotein precursor GP-C cleavage site [50] (Figure 1A and 1B: Spn4A.RRLL(r) and Spn4A.RRLL(s), respectively).",

Cellomics HCS analysis revealed that over 90% of these Huh-7.5.1 cells expressed Spn4A.RRLL(r) at a moi of 50 (Figure S1). Cellomics HCS was also used to determine if cell death occurs following 2 days of pre-treatment with Spn4A.RRLL(r) or Spn4A.RRLL(s) compared to the control (Ad-Empty) followed by 72 hours of HCV infection as employed in the experiments below (Figure S2). We observed no significant reductions in total cell numbers under these experimental conditions.

This allows for detection of the high molecular weight, heat-stable, and SDS-stable enzyme-inhibitor (EI) complex by standard SDS-PAGE and Western blot [54], [55], [58], [62]. To determine if Spn4A.RRLL(s) is a functional and selective inhibitor of SKI-1/S1P, recombinant Spn4A variants (furin- and SKI-1/S1P-directed inhibitors) were expressed in Huh-7.5.1 cells for 72 hours. Cell media and extracts containing recombinant serpins were then harvested and incubated with purified recombinant His-tagged human SKI-1/S1P or furin (Figure 2B) as described previously [47], [54], [58]. Reaction mixtures were analyzed by Western blot and probed for EI complex formation with anti-His antibody (Figure 2B) and anti-FLAG antibody (Figure S3). The results shown in Figure 2B clearly demonstrate EI complex formation between recombinant SKI-1/S1P and Spn4A.RRLL(s) in cell media and in cell extracts (lane 5, upper and lower panels). As expected, Spn4A.RRLL(s) did not form a complex with furin (Figure 2B, lane 10, upper and lower panels), whereas the furin-directed serpin Spn4A.RRKR(s) formed an EI complex with furin but not with SKI-1/S1P in cell media and extracts (Figure 2B, lanes 9 and 7, respectively, upper and lower panels). Lysed cellular extracts expressing Spn4A.RRLL(r) also demonstrated EI complex formation with SKI-1/S1P (Figure 2B, lane 12, bottom panel). The results of our biochemical analysis confirmed the serpin-like properties of recombinant Spn4A.RRLL(r) and (s) biosynthesized in human hepatoma cells and the selectivity of Spn4A.RRLL(s) against SKI-1/S1P. Importantly, Spn4A.RRLL(s) inhibits SKI-1/S1P by a suicide substrate mechanism and forms a kinetically trapped heat- and SDS-stable complex with SKI-1/S1P as is characteristic of other physiological serpin-protease pairs [58], [63].",

As a positive control, we also treated cells with the selective, reversible, and competitive small-molecule inhibitor of SKI-1/S1P: PF-429242 [64], [65]. This compound was recently synthesized and characterized both in vitro and in vivo for its anti-lipidemic properties including efficient inhibition of nuclear SREBP accumulation. As previously described [64], [66], the calpain inhibitor, alpha-N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO (ALLN), was employed to facilitate the detection and accumulation of the N-terminal fragment of SREBP-1 in the nucleus. An anti-fibrillarin antibody was used to positively identify the nuclear fractions (Figure 3A) [67]. As expected, Western blotting of nuclear extracts from cells treated with 10 \u00b5M of PF-429242 (PF-429242 + ALLN), using an antibody against the N-terminal fragment of SREBP-1, revealed a complete block of SREBP-1 accumulation in the nucleus (Figure 3A). Nuclear extracts from cells infected with Ad-Spn4A.RRLL(s) (RRLL(s) + ALLN) also exhibited a dramatic decrease in nuclear SREBP-1 accumulation when compared to Ad-Empty (control + ALLN) and Ad-Spn4A.RRLL(r) (RRLL(r) + ALLN)-infected cells.

We investigated these host cell proteins because of their proposed contribution to HCV entry (LDLR and PCSK9) and propagation (SREBP-2) [19], [68], [69]. A time course analysis of cells expressing Spn4A.RRLL(s) in complete media showed the most significant block in SREBP-regulated LDLR expression after 72 hours (Figure S4). As HCV is known to induce SREBP activation [19], [31], [32], we then analyzed the expression of SREBP-regulated proteins under SREBP-activated conditions (Figure 3B). Huh-7.5.1 cells were depleted of exogenous sterols for 24 hours to induce SREBP transport from ER-to-Golgi prior to infection with Ad-Empty, Ad-Spn4A.RRLL(r), or Ad-Spn4A.RRLL(s). The levels of LDLR, PCSK9, and SREBP-2 (all regulated by nuclear SREBPs [70]-[73]) were then measured using Western blot analysis of lysed cell extracts (Figure 3B). After 72 hours of Spn4A.RRLL(s) expression, mature LDLR (160 kDa) levels were reduced by 74% compared to Ad-Empty-treated cells. Similarly, an 85% block in mature PCSK9 (60 kDa) expression and a 79% reduction in full-length SREBP-2 expression were observed. No significant reductions in LDLR or SREBP-2 levels following Spn4A.RRLL(r) treatment were observed. Interestingly, a significant reduction in PCSK9 expression was detected in Spn4A.RRLL(r)-expressing cells (Figure 3B). The expression of \u03b2-tubulin and of the Golgi marker GM130 were not affected by Spn4A.RRLL(r) or Spn4A.RRLL(s) expression (Figure 3B). These results confirm that expression of Spn4A.RRLL(s) in Huh-7.5.1 cells specifically inhibits the SREBP pathway including target genes identified as cellular cofactors affecting HCV infection.",

We investigated the impact of inhibiting SKI-1/S1P using both Spn4A.RRLL(s) and PF-429242 on total intracellular lipid levels, specifically cholesterol, cholesterol-esters, triglycerides, and phospholipids (Figure 3C and 3D). Among the cell lipids examined, Spn4A.RRLL(s) and PF-429242 had the most dramatic impact on cholesterol-ester levels, a major constituent of cellular LDs [5]; these were reduced by 74% in Spn4A.RRLL(s)-treated cells compared to control (Ad-Empty)-treated cells (Figure 3C). Similarly, PF-429242 reduced cholesterol-ester levels by \u223c 63% compared to control cells treated with DMSO (Figure 3D). A 14% reduction in triglycerides was also induced by Spn4A.RRLL(s), although this reduction did not reach significance, whereas PF-429242 caused a significant 51% reduction in total intracellular triglycerides. A significant 5% reduction in free cholesterol levels was also observed in Spn4A.RRLL(s)-treated cells and a 25% reduction was observed in PF-429242-treated cells compared to respective controls. No significant reductions in phospholipid levels were detected (Figure 3C and 3D). These results suggest that sustained inhibition of SKI-1/S1P-mediated cleavage and activation of SREBP causes increased cellular utilization of lipid stores.",

Because SREBP activation controls the expression of genes directly involved in intracellular fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis (reviewed in [36]) and because cholesterol-ester levels were reduced by Spn4A.RRLL(s), we investigated the effect of serpin-mediated SKI-1/S1P inhibition on cellular LD abundance. Fluorescence microscopy was used to determine the relative abundance of LDs stained with BODIPY 493/503 in Huh-7.5.1 cells infected with Ad-Empty (control), Ad-Spn4A.RRLL(r), and Ad-Spn4A.RRLL(s). After 72 hours, the level of BODIPY-stained LDs in Spn4A.RRLL(s)-expressing cells was dramatically reduced compared to empty vector-treated cells (Figure 4A). By contrast, Spn4A.RRLL(r)-expressing cells had no apparent reduction in LD size or abundance compared to control-treated cells (Figure 4A). Quantification of confocal microscopy images demonstrated that, on average, LD abundance was reduced by 80% in Spn4A.RRLL(s)-expressing cells compared to controls (Figure 4B). The effect of Spn4A.RRLL(s) expression on cytosolic LD abundance was confirmed by visualizing the LD marker ADRP/perilipin 2 using confocal microscopy (Figure 4C) and by using quantitative Western blot (Figure 4D). Spn4A.RRLL(s) was observed to reduce ADRP/perilipin 2 protein expression by 50% compared with control cells (Figure 4D), whereas there was no reduction in ADRP/perlipin 2 expression following Spn4A.RRLL(r) treatment. We subsequently confirmed that reduced cellular LD levels were due to inhibition of SKI-1/S1P using 10 \u00b5M PF-429242 whereupon ADRP/perilipin 2 levels were reduced by 62% compared to control DMSO-treated cells (Figure 4E). These results confirm that Spn4A.RRLL(s)- and PF-429242-mediated inhibition of SKI-1/S1P enzymatic activity dramatically reduces intracellular LD abundance in Huh-7.5.1 cells.",

Huh-7.5.1 cells were treated with increasing moi (1\u201350) of Ad-Spn4A.RRLL(r), Ad-Spn4A.RRLL(s), or Ad-Empty (control) for 48 hours in complete media with or without exogenously added sterols followed by 72 hours of infection with HCV. The number of HCV-infected cells, as evidenced by positive core protein expression, was measured using Cellomics HCS (Figure 5A). It was determined that Spn4A.RRLL(s) expression inhibited HCV infection in a dose-dependent manner compared to control-treated cells. HCV infection was not significantly reduced in cells infected with Ad-Spn4A.RRLL(s) at a moi of 1. A moi of 12.5, however, caused a 40% reduction, a moi of 25 caused a 60% reduction, and a moi of 50 caused a 75% reduction in the number of HCV-infected cells compared to controls. Spn4A.RRLL(r) had no significant impact on HCV infection up to adenovirus moi 50 when compared to the control (Figure 5A). Supplementing sterol and lipid metabolites significantly restored infectivity when cells were treated with moi 50 of Ad-Spn4A.RRLL(s), where a 2-fold increase in HCV infection compared to non-supplemented cells was observed (Figure 5A). These results show that the anti-HCV activity of Spn4A.RRLL(s) is, at least in part, associated with its capacity to decrease intracellular lipid stores within the host cells.",

We engineered and developed a novel, recombinant adenovirus expressing an effective and specific secretory pathway, SKI-1/S1P-directed serpin, Spn4A.RRLL(s). We showed that Spn4A.RRLL(s) forms a kinetically trapped heat- and SDS-stable complex with SKI-1/S1P molecules characteristic of other physiological serpin-protease pairs. We then demonstrated that it blocks the SKI-1/S1P-mediated cleavage of endogenous SREBP-1 and the expression of SREBP downstream effector gene products (e.g., SREBP-2, LDLR, and PCSK9). The SREBP target gene products identified in Spn4A.RRLL(s)-treated cells are involved in lipid homeostasis and reported to participate in HCV-host interactions. SREBP-2, along with the other SREBP isoforms SREBP-1a and -1c, are activated by HCV-encoded proteins or during HCV infection [19], [31]. PCSK9 has been implicated in HCV infection through its regulation of two HCV entry factors: CD81 and LDLR [68]. Although the specific role of LDLR in HCV infection is unclear, increasing evidence indicates that LDLR promotes attachment and uptake of lipoprotein-associated HCV particles into hepatocytes [29], [69], [79], [80].",

In addition, we observed a decrease in ADRP/perilipin 2 abundance in Spn4A.RRLL(s)-expressing cells compared to control-treated cells. The physiological role of ADRP has yet to be fully established but it plays an important role in LD structure and formation. Interestingly, ADRP is degraded through the proteasome-dependent pathway during regression of lipid-storing cells, indicating that when ADRP is not bound to LDs, such as in SKI-1/S1P-inhibited cells, it will be susceptible to rapid proteasomal degradation [81]. Clinical studies have demonstrated that there is a correlation between the level of ADRP and the degree of hepatocyte steatogenesis in humans [82]. In addition, ADRP is found to be up-regulated in fatty liver in humans and in mice with liver steatosis [83].

Western blotting also confirmed that HCV core protein post-translational processing was unaltered by serpin expression because the size of the protein was unaltered. Supplementing Spn4A.RRLL(s)-expressing cells with compounds such as mevalonate, oleate, and cholesterol resulted in an incomplete rescue of HCV infection, suggesting that the antiviral activity of our protein-based inhibitor cannot be explained solely by the decreased availability of lipids in these cells. This also supports our hypothesis that reduced LDLR levels may compromise HCV entry into Spn4A.RRLL(s)-treated hepatocytes. LDLR, a well-established SREBP-regulated gene, has been repeatedly shown to support HCV entry into hepatocytes [69], [80]. Also, no significant reductions in HCV RNA levels were observed in Spn4A.RRLL(s)-treated cells harbouring subgenomic HCV replicons or following full-length genomic HCV RNA transfection in Huh-7.5.1 cells.

            "text": "We first confirmed a reduction in abundance of neutral lipids and ADRP/perilipin 2 expression in PF-429242-treated cells. Then, we confirmed that inhibition of SKI-1/S1P using PF-429242 blocks HCV infection and extracellular infectious virus production in a dose-dependent manner. The anti-HCV activity of PF-429242 is very robust and particularly striking. A single 24-hour pre-treatment with the compound was sufficient to block HCV infection, and the antiviral effect of PF-429242 was still apparent 72 hours post-treatment. Importantly, pharmacological treatment of already infected HCV cells resulted in a 90% reduction of HCV virus production. Similar to Spn4A.RRLL(s) treatment, PF-429242 did not reduce HCV RNA levels in the two stable subgenomic replicon cell lines that were examined. This, in combination with the observed reduction in abundance of a central organelle (LD) involved in HCV assembly, and the reduction in HCV particle secretion in cells treated 24 hours after HCV inoculation, supports PF-429242 as an inhibitor of late stages of the HCV lifecycle, i.e., during assembly or egress. Taken all together, these results indicate that inhibiting SKI-1/S1P can interrupt the HCV lifecycle at multiple stages of viral infection both preventing na\u00efve cells from becoming infected and preventing virus release from already infected cell populations. Thus, developing more effective active-site-directed SKI-1/S1P small-molecule inhibitors (< nM range) with better pharmacokinetic properties [64] could lead to novel indirect-acting antiviral treatment options for HCV-infected patients [42], [76], [85], [86]. Importantly, inhibiting the SREBP pathway in HCV-infected cells, which have exacerbated lipid production and which are steatotic, may relieve symptoms caused by chronic HCV infection in addition to blocking viral infection [87].",

On the other hand, the toxicity issues associated with the inhibition of host cell proteases such as SKI-1/S1P [89] could be addressed by using adjunctive therapy, combining our novel class of lipid-modulating agents with the current standard of care or with the appropriate synergistic direct-acting antivirals [85], [86].",

For this reason, we selected Spn4A as a prototype of a protein inhibitor scaffold for engineering a secretory pathway SKI-1/S1P-directed inhibitor. First, the N-terminus of Spn4A was modified to encode the alpha-1-antitrypsin signal peptide (residues 1\u201324, pre-\u03b11-AT) followed by a 6-His tag (HHHHHH) and FLAG-tag (DYKDDDDK) sequence (HF) [58]. The Spn4A-variants directed at furin contain the P4 \u2013 P1 cleavage sequence [49] ArgP4-Arg-Lys-ArgP1\u2193 (RRKR) in the reactive center loop (RCL). The ER \u201cretained\u201d (r) variant of the furin-directed serpin, designated Spn4A.RRKR(r) (Figure 1A), presents the His-Asp-Glu-Leu (HDEL) ER retention motif at the C-terminus. A \u201csecreted\u201d (s) variant of the serpin, Spn4A.RRKR(s), was generated by mutating the His codon in the HDEL sequence to a stop codon. SKI-1/S1P was reported to cleave the Lassa virus glycoprotein sequence ArgP4-Arg-Leu-LeuP1\u2193 (RRLL) [50]. Thus, to specifically target this enzyme, we altered the furin-directed RCL sequence to RRLL through site-directed mutagenesis using QuikChange (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) to generate Spn4A.RRLL(r) and Spn4A.RRLL(s) (Figure 1A and 1B). To produce Ad-Spn4A.RRKR(s), Ad-Spn4A.RRLL(r), and Ad-Spn4A.RRLL(s), all Spn4A constructs were cloned into adenovirus vectors (pShuttle) [55] and then were amplified by ViraQuest Inc.

Two liters of cell culture supernatant were used for purification. Two hundred milliliters of 200 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl was added, and then the pH was adjusted to pH 8.0 by further addition of 2 M NaOH. The resulting precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 10000 x g for 30 minutes and subsequently filtered through a glass filter. The cleared supernatant was then applied to a small (0.9 ml column volume) IMAC column (Ni-Sepharose, GE Healthcare, Freiburg, Germany) by continuous flow (1.0 ml/minutes). The column had previously been equilibrated in 50 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl (buffer A), and bound recombinant SKI-1/S1P was eluted with a continuous gradient over 30 column volumes to buffer A plus 300 mM imidazole. Collected fractions were assayed for SKI-1/S1P enzymatic activity as previously described [47] using the paranitroanilide (p-NA) acetylated (Ac) tetrapeptidyl substrate Ac-RRLL-pNA [custom synthesized by Peptides International (Louisville, Kentucky, USA)].

The final preparation was, after addition of 30% v/v glycerol, stored at -80\u00b0C and had a specific activity of 0.018 U/mg (measured as above). Recombinant His-tagged furin (0.432 mg/ml) was purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA), and reactions with adenovirus recombinant serpin were performed under the buffer conditions for furin assays as previously described [54], [58].",

Spn4A.RRKR(r) encodes for the naturally occurring serpin Spn4A, isolated from Drosophila melanogaster, with potent inhibitory activity against the human proprotein convertase furin. Spn4A.RRKR(r) contains the alpha-1 antitrypsin signal peptide (SP) at the N-terminus followed by a tandem His-tag (HHHHHH) and FLAG-tag (DYKDDDDK) sequence (HF). The P4 \u2013 P1 furin cleavage sequence in the RCL is Arg-Arg-Lys-Arg. Spn4A.RRKR(r) also contains the His-Asp-Glu-Leu (HDEL) ER retention motif (r) at the C-terminus. The secreted (s) serpin, Spn4A.RRKR(s), contains a stop codon before the HDEL signal. The RCL of Spn4A-RRKR(r) and (s) was modified to mimic the predicted SKI-1/S1P target cleavage site present in the Lassa virus glycoprotein pre-GP-C, which is Arg-Arg-Leu-Leu. Thus, Spn4A.RRLL(r), which is also retained in the ER, encodes the P4 \u2013 P1 Arg-Arg-Leu-Leu cleavage recognition sequence in the RCL. Spn4A.RRLL(s) contains a stop codon before HDEL, allowing the serpin to be secreted. (B) In silico homology model of the Spn4A.RRLL(r) variant was generated as described in the Materials and Methods. Ribbon diagram of the molecular model was generated using Pymol. The side chains of the RRLL residues within the flexible \u201cbait region\u201d of the RCL are shown as sticks in wheat colour.

(2) During HCV infection, the SREBP pathway is activated by a variety of molecular mechanisms [19], [30]\u2013[32]. (3) For SREBP to activate genes involved in lipid biosynthesis, its N-terminal domain must be released through sequential endoproteolytic cleavage first by SKI-1/S1P and then by S2P [37], [38]. (4) The released N-terminal domain translocates to the nucleus and activates various aspects of lipid metabolism [36]. (5) Activation of lipid biosynthesis increases LD formation where the HCV core protein localizes to orchestrate HCV assembly and subsequent secretion [8], [10], [16]. (6) Biosynthesis of LDLR, a proposed receptor for HCV entry, is also activated by SREBP signaling [69], [79], [101]. (7) Spn4A.RRLL(s) is a secretory pathway-expressed serpin (Figure 1). (8) Spn4A.RRLL(s) interacts and forms a covalent complex with enzymatically active SKI-1/S1P molecules (Figure 2 and S3) in the Golgi apparatus preventing SKI-1/S1P-mediated endoproteolytic cleavage of SREBP protein (Figure 3A). (9) A small-molecule inhibitor PF-429242 also efficiently inhibits SKI-1/S1P endoproteolytic activity (Figure 3A). (10) SKI-1/S1P inhibition blocks expression of the putative HCV receptor, LDLR (Figure 3B and S4), and reduces HCV entry (Figure 5). (11) The expression of other SREBP-regulated genes, such as PCSK9 and SREBP-2, are also blocked (Figure 3B). (12) Downstream lipid synthesis is interrupted resulting in overall reduced intracellular cholesterol-ester and triglyceride abundance (Figure 3C and 3D). (12) This is then detected as a decrease in LD abundance (Figure 4), which impedes assembly and secretion of infectious HCV particles.",
