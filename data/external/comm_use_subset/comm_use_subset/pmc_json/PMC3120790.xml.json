More importantly, occasional transmission of H9N2 viruses from land-based poultry to humans and pigs have been reported [5-7]. Some investigations suggest that a significant proportion of H9N2 field isolates have acquired human virus-like receptor specificity; a few that could recognize \u03b1 2,6-linked sialic acid (SA\u03b12-6) have been transmitted directly to humans [7-10]. In addition to possessing human virus-like receptor specificity, avian H9N2 viruses induce a typical human flu-like illness, which can easily go unreported, and therefore have the opportunity to circulate, reassort, and improve transmissibility [7,11-14]. Hence, global concern is focused on the prevention and treatment of H9N2 avian influenza virus infections.",

Currently, most avian influenza vaccines used in clinics are the inactivated type, which are propagated in embryonated chicken eggs. However, the use of inactivated avian influenza vaccines can induce little or no cellular immune response; thus, it cannot provide wide and persistent protection against influenza, and it will interfere with serological monitoring. In addition, egg-based influenza vaccine production is dependent on the availability of embryonated eggs, which is at risk in the event of outbreaks of avian diseases. In view of these potential drawbacks, we sought to develop a new type of H9N2 vaccine using the Baculovirus Dual Expression System constructed in this study.",

The main objectives of this study were: i) to effectively display functional HA on the baculoviral envelope in the hope that HA would retain superior immunogenicity upon in vivo immunization, and ii) to efficiently express HA in transduced mammalian cells. The results showed that stronger immune responses were induced in a mouse model immunized with BV-Dual-HA than in those vaccinated with a DNA vaccine encoding the same antigen. Moreover, complete protection against lethal challenge with H9N2 virus was observed in mice, indicating the potential of BV-Dual-HA as a vaccine candidate against H9N2 virus infection.",

Thus, the HA protein displayed on the envelope of BV-Dual-HA allowed it to engage antigen presenting cells (APCs) and activate the HA-specific immune reactions via the major histocompatibility complex II-mediated antigen presentation pathway, leading to more potent immune responses. Moreover, compared with the DNA vaccine, the baculovirus can directly transduce APCs [24,25] resident in the muscle tissues, especially more efficient antigen presentation to dendritic cells (DCs), which are the most important APCs [26]. Furthermore, Martyn et al. [27] reported that transduction by a recombinant baculovirus was more efficient than the transfection of conventional DNA plasmids driven by the CMV promoter in both cell lines and primary cells. The transduction of primary marmoset hepatocytes with recombinant baculovirus was 55 times more efficient than DNA transfection, highlighting a major advantage of recombinant baculovirus for the delivery of foreign genes to mammalian cells.",

This might be because the baculovirus envelope protein gp64 recognizes the TLR9 molecule and thus activates an innate immune response [28]. This is consistent with a previous study that determined that intranasal immunization with wild-type baculovirus alone also provides sufficient protection from the H1N1 influenza lethal challenge [29], though we didn't evaluate the cellular immune responses. And there are accumulated studies have demonstrated that the baculovirus itself has the ability to induce innate immune responses through a signaling pathway that is dependent on Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9)/MyD88, which results in the production of various cytokines, including members of the IFN family [25,28,30]. Hervas-Stubbs reported that baculoviruses have strong adjuvant properties in mice, promoting potent humoral and CD8+ T cell adaptive responses against co-administered antigens [30]. Besides, previously studies also have proved that baculovirus expressing PRRSV GP5 and M protein [31], PCV2 Cap protein [32], H5N1 virus HA protein [33], Pseudorabies virus glycoproteins[34] could induced a high level of IFN-g responses. The unique ability of the baculovirus to induce innate and adaptive immunity may have contributed to the protection from H9N2 influenza lethal challenge.",

The baculovirus vector contains a large genome that enables insertion of large, foreign DNA fragments or the construction of multivalent vaccines. In subsequent studies, we plan to improve the protective range of this system using appropriate selection of HA genes derived from different clades of the H9N2 avian influenza virus for the composition of multivalent vaccines.
