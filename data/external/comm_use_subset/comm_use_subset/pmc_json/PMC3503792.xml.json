The standard therapy is a combination of pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV). In addition, Peg-IFN, RBV, and telaprevir triple therapy is a new strategy expected to eradicate the HCV even in patients infected with difficult-to-treat genotype 1 strains, although adverse effects, such as anemia and rash, are frequent\n[5,6].",

OLP can occur, become exacerbated and persist during IFN treatment for hepatitis C, even when serum HCV RNA becomes negative.

Risk factors associated with symptomatic candidiasis include: local or systemic immunosuppression, haematological disorders, broad-spectrum antibiotic use, inhaled or systemic steroids, xerostomia, diabetes, wearing dentures, obturators and orthodontic appliances, and smoking\n[20-23]. Candida is has been reported to be found in 37.0% to 76.7% of OLP cases\n[24,25].
