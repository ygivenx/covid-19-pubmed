ARIMA model was applied to a dataset consisting of 22 number determinations. Fig. 1 shows that the overall prevalence of COVID-2019 presented an increasing trend that is reaching the epidemic plateau. The difference between cases of one day and cases of the previous day \u0394(Xn-Xn-1) showed a nonconstant increase in the number of confirmed cases. Descriptive analysis of the data was performed to evaluate the incidence of new confirmed cases of COVID-2019 and to prevent eventual bias.",
