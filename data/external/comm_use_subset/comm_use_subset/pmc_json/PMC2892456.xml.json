According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of 30 April 2010, worldwide at least 17919 death cases have been reported [1]. Compared with influenza A H1N1 virus, the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 has a much higher mortality rate: H5N1 has a mortality rate of more than 50% while novel pandemic H1N1 has only about 1% [2]. Nevertheless, pandemic H1N1 and highly pathogenic H5N1 manifest similar clinical symptoms at the early stage of infection [3]. Early detection of these two pathogens is an essential prerequisite for effective control and prevention of the pandemic.",

Moreover, multiplex assays allow to measure several fluorophores in one well, which can simultaneously detect different target sequences [5]. Since the outbreak of pandemic H1N1 influenza, many real-time RT-PCR assays have been developed for detecting of the novel H1N1 [6-13]. Some multiplex real-time RT-PCR assays for simultaneous typing (A/B) and subtyping of H1, H2, H3, H5, H7 and H9 of influenza A viruses have also been reported [14-17].

Different concentrations of the primers and probes for both H5N1 and H1N1 were combined and adjusted to improve the sensitivity of the assay [20]. The concentrations of primers and probe for H5 gene in the duplex system was optimized by using a serial of 10-fold diluted H5N1 RNAs as templates. The sensitivity of the duplex assays was evaluated at the concentration of H5 primers as 0.4 \u03bcM, 0.8 \u03bcM, 1.6 \u03bcM and 3.2 \u03bcM. The results showed that the sensitivity of the duplex assays dramatically increased with the concentration of H5 primers. The duplex assay had the best detecting result at the H5 primer concentration of 1.6 \u03bcM. The concentration of probes for H5 gene was also optimized by examining the concentration at 0.1 \u03bcM, 0.2 \u03bcM, 0.4 \u03bcM and 0.8 \u03bcM, and any significant different results at different concentrations was not observed. Therefore, 0.1 \u03bcM was selected as the final concentration of H5 probe in the duplex real-time RT-PCR system. Similar to the duplex assay for H5 gene, the concentrations of primers and probe for H1 also were optimized by using RNA from 2, 0.2, 0.02 and 0.002 TCID50 H1N1 as templates. The concentration of H1 primers was optimized from 0.1 \u03bcM, 0.2 \u03bcM, 0.4 \u03bcM, 0.8 \u03bcM and 1.6 \u03bcM, while the concentration of H1 probe was optimized at 0.1 \u03bcM, 0.2 \u03bcM, 0.4 \u03bcM and 0.8 \u03bcM. Thus, 0.4 \u03bcM of primers and 0.2 \u03bcM of probe were selected as the optimal concentration for H1 gene. The reactions were incubated at 50\u00b0C for 30 min, followed by 95\u00b0C for 10 min, 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s, and 52\u00b0C for 1 min. Fluorescence was recorded at 52\u00b0C.",

The lessons from 1918 and 1957 influenza suggested that the pandemic might return in a much more lethal form in the second wave [21]. Recently, the increasing geographic distribution of high pathogenic H5N1 as well as its ability to transfer to humans and to cause severe infection has raised serious concerns regarding the control measures of this virus. The duplex real-time RT-PCR assay for pandemic H1N1 and high pathogenic H5N1 would play an important role for control and prevention of pandemic caused by these viruses.",
