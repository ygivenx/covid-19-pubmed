We designed the iLOV sequence to be flanked with 2Apro cleavage sites and then inserted between the RV genomic sequences encoding the VP1 and 2A proteins. 2Apro mediates auto\u2010cleavage between VP1 and 2A proteins.20, 47 Since self\u2010catalytic cleavage is a characteristic of picornavirus replication, this design should allow extension of our technique to all human RVs.
