Moreover, these CoVs contain RBDs similar to that in the SARS-CoV S protein for binding to ACE2, suggesting that they can cause direct human infection without an intermediate host.23, 24 However, it remains unknown whether bat SARS-like CoVs that are even closer to SARS-CoV exist. Identification of the immediate progenitors of SARS-CoVs and their bat hosts will not only shed light on the animal source of SARS-CoVs but might also have implications in the formulation of strategies to prevent the re-emergence of SARS-like CoVs in human.",

The 5\u2032-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5\u2032-RACE) and 3\u2032-RACE systems (v. 2.0, Invitrogen) were used to amplify the 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-untranslated regions (UTRs), respectively. To validate the viral genome, we designed primer pairs that generated overlapping amplicons for the whole genome of F46 (primer sequences are available upon request).

Four breakpoints were detected in the F46 genome, with strong P-values (<10\u201330) supported by similarity plot and bootscan analyses (Figures 4B and 4C). The breakpoints generated recombination of fragment A covering 1\u20138 and 848 nts (a total of 8 and 848 nt), including the 5\u2032-UTR and partial ORF 1a, and fragment B covering 21 684 to 23 271 nt (a total of 1587 nt), including a partial ORF of the spike gene. Both similarity plots and bootscan analyses revealed that F46 was highly phylogenetically related to SL-CoV LYRa11 in the first 9000 nt of the genome. Downstream of the first 9000 nt of the genome, F46 shared similar sequence similarity to SARS-CoV BJ01 and SL-CoV Rs3367. Phylogenetic analysis using the major and minor parental regions showed that F46 is grouped in the SL-CoVs and close to SL-CoV LYRa11(Figures 4D and 4E).

Samples from other bat species (R. luctus, R. affinis, M. daubentonii and fruit bat) were negative for these viruses, further confirming that the least horseshoe bat is a prominent natural reservoir or mixer of genetically diverse Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus species and plays a pivotal role in the evolution and dissemination of these viruses.",

The S protein RBD of F46 possesses identifying features typical of those belonging to bat SARS-like CoVs, namely three deletions and mutations within the key residues required for binding ACE2 (Figures 2A and 3).31, 32 Predicting from these features, F46 should be incapable of infecting humans directly. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that F46 is placed in one clade with strain Rs3367 and RsSHC014, which were more closely related to SARS-CoVs than to other SL-CoVs (Figure 1), and particularly between LYRa11 and Rs3367 (Figure 2). F46 likely represents an intermediate between LYRa11 and Rs3367. To understand the evolutionary pathway of F46, we conducted recombination analysis using available genome sequences of human/civet and bat SARS-like CoVs. A total of four breakpoints were detected in the F46 genome with strong P-values (<10\u201330). The results showed that F46 is a recombinant from Rs3367, LYRa11 and BJ01 lineages.",
