In humans CPS-CQ is about 20 times more efficient than RAS, requiring bites from a total of 45 versus 1,000 mosquitoes, respectively [4-6]. Moreover, long-lasting immune responses after CPS-CQ immunization in studies with mice [7] and healthy human volunteers [8] go together with protracted protection. Several murine studies have demonstrated the essential role of CD8+ T cells in sporozoite-induced pre-erythrocytic immunity [9-14,2]. Generation of these CD8+ T cells against pre-erythrocytic antigens requires cross-priming by dendritic cells [15].",

The first topic of investigation was the effect of CQ on immunization by RAS, an established immunization model relying on CD8+ T cell responses, thus potentially benefiting from improved cross-presentation. CD8+ T cells recognizing the immunodominant circumsporozoite (CS) protein can mediate protective immunity [24]. Therefore, the effect of CQ on the induction of CS-specific CD8+ T cells by immunization with P. berghei parasites that express a mutant CS protein containing the model SIINFEKL H-2Kb epitope was investigated next. Finally, a direct comparison was performed betweeen CPS-CQ and CPS with mefloquine (MQ), an anti-malarial with little known immune modulating effects [25-27], not including improvement of cross-presentation. Akin to CQ, MQ induces arrest of early blood-stage parasites without an effect on pre-erythrocytic parasite stages, allowing full liver-stage development and brief exposure to early blood stages. By performing experiments in these selected complimentary P. berghei murine models, the aim of this study was to explore the effect of CQ on protection and T cell responses after whole sporozoite immunization.",

Both CQ and MQ are lysosomotropic agents that limit endosomal acidification [22], which for CQ is known to result in inhibition of lysosomal enzymes that require an acidic pH to function and the fusion of endosomes with lysosomes [34]. As such CQ, but not MQ, has been widely used to study the role of endosomal acidification in cellular processes [35]. CQ has also been studied extensively for its inhibitory effect on autophagy [17], but a recent publication suggests that MQ has similar effects on autophagy [36]. Because both endosomal acidification and autophagy might influence antigen presentation, the effect of MQ on these processes may result in immune modulating effects just as is the case for CQ.",

Furthermore, some reports show a negative effect of blood-stage parasites on induced pre-erythrocytic CD8+ T cell responses by interfering with dendritic cell function [38,1].
