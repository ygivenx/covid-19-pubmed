Clinical evidence shows that ZIKV can cross the placental barrier and cause microcephaly in developing foetuses and neurological complications in adults such as Guillain-Barre syndrome [4,5]. The ZIKV envelope (E) protein mediates viral attachment to the host cell and fusion with cell membranes [6]. The flavivirus E ectodomain has three distinct domains: EDI-III [7]. Several ZIKV-specific antibodies have been isolated from infected individuals [8\u201312]; among these, E-binding antibodies, especially those targeting EDIII, manifest the most potent neutralizing activities in vitro and in vivo [8\u201311]. The presence of EDIII-targeted antibodies correlates with serum-neutralizing activity against ZIKV [8].",

            "text": "The human adaptive immune system consists of B and T cells, both of which play important roles in the defense against infections. A successful antibody response relies on the generation of a diverse repertoire of B cell receptors (BCRs). BCRs are membrane-bound antigen-binding immunoglobulins (Ig) that, like any antibody, are composed of two immunoglobulin heavy chains and two light chains. BCR diversity is achieved by rearrangement of the variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments in the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (IgH) and the V and J gene segments in the light chain locus (Ig\u03bb or IgK) [13]. B cells are activated upon encountering an antigen that binds to their BCRs. Once a B cell encounters an antigen, it is recruited to a local lymph follicle and undergoes a process called somatic hypermutation (SHM), which increases the antigen-specific affinity in the germinal centres [14]. SHM occurs in a specific region, the complementary determining region (CDR), which is critical to antigen binding. The CDR is divided into three sub-regions: CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3. CDR3 typically plays a key role in determining antibody specificity and affinity [15]. Therefore, the CDR3 sequence is often used for lineage structure analysis of the antibody repertoire [16,17]. Activated B cells proliferate and differentiate to generate a population of antibody-secreting plasma B cells and memory B cells. Antigen-specific memory B cells in humans peak 14\u201321 days after infection or vaccination and can account for approximately 1% of all B cells in the peripheral blood [18]. Memory B cells can differentiate into both long-lived memory B cells, which mediate a rapid recall response, and long-lived plasma cells, which maintain antibody production [13].",

He was hospitalized in Guangzhou 8th People\u2019s Hospital in Guangzhou, China [10,23,24]. ZIKV RNA was detected in his serum, saliva, and urine samples by RT\u2013PCR. The patient manifested relatively mild symptoms including fever, rash, sore throat, and fatigue. ZIKV was no longer detectable in the patient\u2019s urine 14 days after symptom onset. He recovered completely and was discharged from the hospital after approximately three weeks. The patient tested serologically negative for DENV1 NS1, indicating that he had no previous exposure to DENV1 [10]. Whole blood samples measuring 8, 6, 8, and 8 mL (containing 4.8\u20136.4 million mononuclear cells) were collected from the patient at 14, 64, 181, and 412 days, respectively, into EDTA anticoagulant-containing tubes. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by density gradient separation on a Ficoll-Hypaque gradient (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). All plasma samples were heat-inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30 min prior to aliquoting and storage at \u2013 80\u00b0C. This study was conducted in accordance with the rules and regulations stipulated by the Chinese government for the protection of human subjects. Furthermore, the patient provided written informed consent approving the use of his blood samples in the present study.",

ZIKV E protein (Cat. No. 40543-V08B4; Sino Biological, Inc., Beijing, China) was used as a probe to isolate ZIKV E-specific memory B cells. CD3-CD20 + CD27 + IgG + HIS+ memory B cells were sorted using a multi-laser BD FACSAria\u2122 II cell sorter (BD Biosciences). Individual B cells were sorted into 96-well PCR plates containing 20 \u00b5L of lysis buffer per cell. The lysis buffer contained 0.25 \u00b5L RNasin\u00ae inhibitor (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), 5 \u00b5L 5 \u00d7 first-strand buffer, 1.25 \u00b5L 0.1 M DTT, and 0.0625 \u00b5L IGEPAL (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). PCR plates containing the sorted cells were frozen on dry ice then stored at \u2013 80\u00b0C or used for reverse transcription (RT). RT\u2013PCR was performed and the Ig genes were cloned into expression vectors as described previously [19]. Briefly, RT was carried out by adding 1 \u00b5L of random hexamers (150 ng/\u00b5L; Promega), 2 \u00b5L dNTPs (each at 10 mM), and 0.5 \u00b5L SuperScript III (Invitrogen) to each well, followed by incubation at 42\u00b0C for 1 h. IgG heavy and light chain variable regions were independently amplified with nested PCR. The first round of PCR was performed with 2 \u00b5L of cDNA directly following RT with HotStarTaq Plus DNA polymerase (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and the primer mixtures. PCR was performed as follows: 1 cycle at 94\u00b0C for 5 min, 50 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 55\u00b0C (round 1) or 60\u00b0C (round 2) for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min, followed by 72\u00b0C for 10 min before cooling to 4\u00b0C. The PCR products were evaluated on 2% agarose gels. Regions displaying bands of the expected size (nearly 500 and 450 bp for the heavy chain and kappa/lambda chains, respectively) were excised from the gels and sent for Sanger sequencing after purification. Human antibody sequences were analysed using IMGT/V-QUEST (http://www.imgt.org/). Full-length IgG1 was expressed by co-transfecting HEK-293T cells with equal quantities of paired heavy and light chain plasmids based on the backbone of the pCI-neo vector [25]. Culture media were harvested four days after transfection and purified using protein A agarose (GE Healthcare).",

Non-productive sequences that had either stop codons or out-of-frame IGHJ were excluded from further analysis. Ig isotype proportion and global VH gene usage were calculated using the R package alakazam [31]. To determine whether the IgH repertoires contained sequences related to the antibodies we cloned, we first identified the sequences sharing the same VH and JH gene segments. Then we applied CD-HIT [32] to find the HCDR3 sequences that were 100% identical to the HCDR3 sequences of the cloned antibodies. To track the ontology and development of the isolated antibodies longitudinally, sequence identity relative to the isolated antibodies was measured via MAFFT [33] and the values of divergence from germline VH genes were calculated according to the IMGT/HighV-QUEST results.

To draw the CDR3 tree-map for each repertoire, a set of rectangles, each of which corresponding to a distinct V gene segment in the entire repertoire was drawn, followed by a set of V-J rectangles within each V gene rectangle. Finally, within each V-J rectangle, V-J-CDR3 rectangles representing distinct V-J-CDR3 combinations were created. The V-J-CDR3 rectangles were ordered from the largest at the bottom right side to the smallest at the top left side. Therefore, each rectangle represents a cluster of nucleotide sequences with the same V gene and J gene, and identical CDR3. The size of an individual V-J-CDR3 rectangle is proportional to the relative frequency for each V-J-CDR3 combination sequence. Different rectangles were displayed in different randomly generated colours. The top 10,000 most frequent CDR3 sequences in the IgH transcripts were used for the tree-maps. Diversity index D50 is a measurement of the diversity of an immune repertoire. J represents the total number of CDR3s and S represents unique CDR3s in a ranked dominance configuration. The abundance of the most abundant CDR3 is represented by r1, while r2 is the abundance of the second most abundant CDR3 and so forth.

Fourteen E-binding mAbs, including five out of seven EDIII-targeted mAbs (7B3, 1C11, 8D10, 6B6, and 7F4) and nine out of twenty-four EDI/II-targeted mAbs (6A6, 6A11, 1E7, 6A5, 1E6, 6A9, 6B1, 6C2, and 5D2) demonstrated neutralizing activities at a concentrations lower than 5 \u00b5g/mL against the ZIKV GZ02 strain in a cell-based neutralizing assay (Table 1). Seven mAbs were bound to EDIII, indicating that they were EDIII-targeted antibodies. Detailed characterizations of some of these E-binding mAbs have been described previously [23].\n",

Between 2.4 and 3.9 million IgH sequence reads were obtained from the samples at each timepoint by NGS using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencer (Figure 1A). During sample collection, the patient was serologically confirmed to have no DENV infection [34]. The day-14 repertoire contained the highest percentage of IgG transcripts, accounting for 58% of the total, which then decreased to 35%, 29%, and 19% of the total on days 64, 181, and 412, respectively. In contrast, the IgM transcripts were lowest in the 14- and 64-day repertoires, accounting for 27.6% and 26.6% of the total, respectively; however, the IgM transcripts increased on days 181 and 412\u201359.5% and 60.3%, respectively. As expected, the IgE abundance was very low at all time points. Interestingly, the IgD and IgA transcripts underwent a transient increase on day 64 (Figure 1B, 1C). To obtain a holistic view of the antibody repertoire dynamics over time, we constructed four tree-maps, each representing the 10,000 most frequent unique CDR3 sequences on days 14, 64, 181, or 412 (Figure 1D). Each rectangle in a tree-map represents a unique CDR3 and its size is proportional to the relative abundance of an individual CDR3 sequence at that timepoint. On day 14, the IgH repertoire appeared to contain many dominant clones, as demonstrated by the presence of many large rectangles in the corresponding tree-map. The IgH repertoire continued to show clonal expansion until at least day 64. The tree-map of the day-64 repertoire was similar to that of the day-14 repertoire and appeared very different from the tree-maps of the day-181 and day-412 repertoires. The dominant clone content of the antibody repertoire recessed from day 64 to day 181, as demonstrated by far fewer large rectangles in the day-181 repertoire. Notably, ZIKV RNA was detected in the patient\u2019s urine 13 days after disease onset, but it was undetectable at day 14 (Figure S1). The tree-map of the day-181 repertoire was similar to that of the day-412 repertoire, indicating that the antibody response to ZIKV ceased before day 181 (Figure 1D).\n",

Further evidence of lower antibody diversity during the early stages of infection was obtained by calculating the relative abundance of unique CDR3 sequences among the total CDR3 reads. The relative abundance of unique CDR3 sequences was lower in the day-14 (3.07%) and day-64 (2.64%) repertoires than in those of the day-181 (12.22%) and day-412 (10.23%) repertoires (Figure 1A). Taken together, these results illustrated that the antibody repertoire was largely committed to responding to the virus after ZIKV infection and lasted at least until day 64. However, when the ZIKV threat was over, the antibody repertoire recessed to a quiescent steady state with fewer dominant clones, but greater clonal diversity.",

The frequency of each VH gene used to generate their corresponding IgH sequences was ranked from high to low based on the sequencing data of the day-412 IgH repertoire. Since day 412 was the last timepoint collected after the patient recovered, we assumed that the corresponding repertoire reflected the most quiescent state. Indeed, the frequency of global VH gene usage in the day-181 repertoire appeared very similar to that in the day-412 repertoire, suggesting that the antibody repertoire nearly reached the quiescent state by day 181 (Figure 2). In contrast, the frequency of global VH gene usage on day 14 was very different from that on days 181 and day 412. Notably, several VH genes appeared to be more frequently used on day 14.\n",

The global SHM rates of all IgG sequences were 3.25% on day 14, which then increased to 4.68% on day 64 then slightly decreased to 3.72% on day 412 (Figure 3A). We also analysed the SHM rates of 31 E-binding mAbs and compared these rates with those of their corresponding VH gene-derived IgH sequences in the repertoires (Table 1). The average SHM rate of the 31 E-binding mAbs was 6.91% (1.72 \u2212 14.78%), with changes in 10.9 amino acids on average.

Since the B cells that we sequenced were isolated from 6\u20138 mL of peripheral blood, the B cells harbouring the same V-J-CDR3 sequences may have been missed in the limited blood sample volumes that we obtained. To our surprise, 17 out of 31 E-binding mAbs with the same V-J -CDR3 sequences were found in the day-14 repertoire, whereas only 4, 3, and 3 mAbs with the same V-J-CDR3 sequences were found in the day-64, -181, and -412 repertoires, respectively (Figure 4A). This result indicated that the B cells producing E-binding antibodies were abundantly present in peripheral blood soon after infection, while these B cells quickly disappeared after the clearance of ZIKV infection. It is important to note that the 31 E-binding mAbs were cloned from the memory B cells in PBMCs collected on day 64. We next performed a two-dimensional identity-divergence analysis by searching the IgH lineage sequences of three representative mAbs (6A6, 6B6, and 8D10) in the repertoires corresponding to each time point. These three mAbs were neutralizing antibodies and their V-J-CDR3 sequences were found on day 14 but not thereafter, indicating that these mAbs were abundant on day 14 (Figure 4B).

During \u201cwartime\u201d and the aftermath (the first two months after ZIKV infection), there was a dramatic expansion of dominant B cell clones in response to ZIKV infection; therefore, clonal diversity was lower. During \u201cpeacetime\u201d (six months and one year after disease), the antibody repertoire recessed to a state involving few dominant B cell clones and greater B cell clonal diversity. Given that heavy chain antibodies play a key role in antibody binding, the contribution of the light chain was not assessed in the present study. However, this may constitute a worthwhile investigation in the future. It is important to note that the patient was verified to be DENV-negative during sample collection and showed no cross-reactivity to DENV E protein for serum samples collected between two months and two years post-ZIKV infection [34], indicating that this individual had no DENV infection prior to or after the primary ZIKV infection. We inferred that if this individual manifested a DENV infection after recovery from ZIKV infection, the IgH repertoires would likely reveal changes such as the dramatic expansion of dominant B cell clones in response to a new infection. However, the IgH repertoires on day 181 and day 412 showed fewer dominant B cell clones with higher clonal diversity than the IgH repertoires on day 14 and day 64.",

Each unique sequence represents a B cell clone. B cells containing the exact or same lineage of IgH sequences may have been missed in the blood samples collected. Although impossible for a living subject, a complete antibody repertoire should ideally come from sequencing all B cells in an individual. Our study demonstrated that even 6\u20138 mL of peripheral blood can provide insightful information about antibody response. Among the 31 E-binding mAbs that we cloned from this single individual, 17 mAbs with the same V-J- CDR3 sequences could be found in the day-14 repertoire, whereas only 4 and 3 mAbs with the same V-J-CDR3 sequences could be found in the day-64 and day-181 repertoires, respectively. This finding demonstrated that B cells expressing these E-binding mAbs or their closely related lineage clones were present soon after ZIKV infection. A recent analysis of serum antibody epitope repertoires of ZIKV-infected patients also revealed that E-binding and EDIII-targeted antibodies were present early, even on the day of symptom onset, and matured with increasing affinity as early as day 7 after symptom onset [36]. This result supported our NGS analysis that B cells expressing E-binding and EDIII-targeted antibodies were abundantly present soon after ZIKV infection.",

One group reported the cloning of a germline-like mAb using a phage display from a na\u00efve human antibody library [37]. Another group reported that a panel of germline-like antibodies was cloned from circulating plasmablasts of a ZIKV-infected patient 12 days after symptom onset [38]. These mAbs exhibited weak-to-moderate neutralizing potency. One mAb had no SHM capacity, but could nevertheless bind to an immunodominant epitope and neutralize ZIKV [38].

Nevertheless, we gathered that the PBMCs from day 412 could be considered the \u201cno infection state.\u201d Based on our NGS analysis of the IgH repertoire, we obtained the frequency of global VH gene usage in the same subject from early infection until over one year after recovery. Diverse VH genes were used to generate E-binding mAbs; i.e. 17 VH genes contributed to 31 mAbs that we cloned from memory B cells. However, several VH genes, such as VH4-39 and VH3-23, had a high frequency of global VH gene usage at all timepoints and a high frequency of representation among the E-binding mAbs. The contribution of the VH5-10-1 gene was particularly interesting. As in the general population [11], VH5-10-1 had a very low frequency of global VH gene usage in this patient. In this study, although VH5-10-1 had a very low frequency of global usage (average 0.32%) in the day-64, -181, and -412 repertoires, its usage on day 14 after ZIKV infection transiently elevated five-fold to 1.6%. Since VH5-10-1 had a high percentage of representation among the E-binding mAbs and low SHM rates (Table 1), we propose that VH5-10-1 was likely preferentially enlisted for rapid response to ZIKV infection in this patient. Such rapid response required only low level SHM activity; therefore, these antibodies do not require a long maturation process to achieve affinity. In this study, all three VH5-10-1-derived mAbs (6A6, 6A9, and 6G3) had low SHM rates ranging between 4.17% and 4.51% (Figure 3B, Table 1). ZIKV specific mAbs derived from VH5-10-1 has also been reported in other patients in response to ZIKV infection. For instance, another group reported that VH5-10-1 was frequently used by ZIKV-specific antibodies in DENV-ZIKV cross-infected patients and in primary ZIKV-infected patients [11]. In comparison, VH1-69 had a high frequency of global usage, but it did not contribute to any E-binding mAbs that we cloned. Among ZIKV E-binding mAbs reported by other researchers, VH1-69 was also rarely used. Since VH1-69 is frequently used in antibodies against the influenza virus [39,40], it is likely that VH1-69 is preferentially enlisted for responding to pathogens like the influenza virus but not ZIKV. In our study, by combining single B cell antibody cloning and longitudinal analysis of IgH repertoires in the same patient, we found that several VH genes such as VH5-10-1, VH4-39, and VH3-23 appeared to be preferentially enlisted for the rapid generation of E-binding antibodies after ZIKV infection.",

Antibodies with a large number of SHMs require frequent antigen encounters and helper T cells in the germinal centre. We proposed that as a mechanism for rapid defence against ZIKV infection, which generally manifests a short disease course, certain VH genes are preferentially selected to generate ZIKV-specific antibodies without the need to undergo a long maturation process. When a person is exposed to ZIKV infection, the primary B cell response from na\u00efve B cells can rapidly generate ZIKV-specific antibodies, including neutralizing antibodies that do not require the accumulation of a large number of SHMs. The preferential usage of these VH genes may be attributed to evolution through many years of interaction between Homo sapiens and ZIKV, along with other flaviviruses. Our longitudinal analysis of IgH repertoires corroborated well with the results from single B cell antibody cloning and with the neutralizing, E-binding, and EDIII-binding activities in the serum samples collected from days 14\u2013412. Our study showed that EDIII-targeted antibodies in the IgH reservoirs correlated well with serum-neutralizing activities against ZIKV. This result was also in line with a report that the presence of EDIII-targeted antibodies correlated with serum-neutralizing activity against ZIKV [8]. Our study also indicated that E-binding antibodies persisted longer than EDIII-binding antibodies and neutralizing antibodies in this patient, implying that EDI- and EDII-binding antibodies may last longer in the patient. Since most EDI- and EDII-binding antibodies have no or low-neutralizing activities, they may play a role in the antibody-mediated enhancement of infection of other flaviviruses that share similar epitopes. It would be worthwhile to study a large cohort of samples in the future. This study provides insight on the antibody response after ZIKV infection and has implications for the design and development of vaccines against ZIKV.",

(A) The total sequencing reads, total CDR3, unique CDR3, and CDR3 diversity index (D50) of the IgH repertoires. (B) The Ig subtypes were isolated and counted based on the constant sequence. Listed are the percentages of IgA, IgD, IgE, IgM, and IgG. (C) The percentages of each Ig subtypes were presented in a pie chart. (D) The V-J-CDR3 tree-map and CDR3 diversity index (D50) of the IgH repertoires. Each rectangle in the tree-map represents a unique V-J-CDR3 sequence. The size of each rectangle denotes the relative frequency of an individual V-J-CDR3 sequence. The colour of the individual CDRH3 sequence in each tree-map plot was randomly chosen; thus, the colours do not match between plots. The D50 metric value indicates the diversity of the antibody repertoire.",

(B) Two-dimensional (2D) identity-divergence analysis of mAb heavy chain populations in the IgH repertoires. The heavy chain was plotted as a function of sequence similarity to the template and sequence divergence from the putative germline gene. The x-axis represents the percentage of diversity from VH genes 6A6H for VH5-10-1, 6B6H for VH4-4, and 8D10H for VH4-31 germline. The sequences are shown as a heatmap with the indicated colours.
