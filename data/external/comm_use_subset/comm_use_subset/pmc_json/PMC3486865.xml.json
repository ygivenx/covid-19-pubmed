            "text": "Influenza A viruses (IVs), which belong to the orthomyxoviridae family, consist of eight negative RNA strands. Hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are two glycoproteins that are encoded by the IV genome, expressed from segments 4 and 6, respectively. The selection due to various host immune systems and anti-flu drugs accelerate the mutation rates of viral proteins, especially for these two membrane proteins [1], [2]. There are 17 HA subtypes and 10 NA subtypes, designated H1-H17 and N1-N10, respectively. Over 118 combinations of IVs can be isolated from wild birds, which are also the natural reservoir of these viruses (except the H17N10 virus, which, until recently, was isolated only from bat) [3]\u2013[5]. The species jumping ability of IVs can result in the infections of poultry and mammals, such as chicken, swine, equine or whale species, with different virulence levels [6]\u2013[9]. The H1N1, H2N2 and H3N2 viruses have been responsible for tens of millions deaths during the deadly history of human influenza epidemics. Furthermore, the H5N1, H7N7, H7N2, H7N3 and H9N2 viruses have been isolated from sporadic human infections and deaths [10]\u2013[13]. It is worth noting that the H5N1 virus is the most severe for human and avian species, with sudden onset and high mortality. The mortality rate in hundreds of patients who were hospitalized for H5N1 infections was roughly 59.05%, much higher than the mortality rates of the Spanish Flu or the 2009 influenza pandemic (H1N1) [11], [14], [15].",

The nascent HA of all subtypes consists of conserved structures, including the signal peptide, the cytoplasm domain, the transmembrane domain and the extracellular domain [16]. The mature HA monomer can be cleaved by proteases into the global HA1 and stalk HA2 subunits [17]. When IVs are located in the host digestive tract or respiratory tract cell, the receptor binding domains (RBDs) at the tip of HA1 bind to the SA\u03b12-3Gal or SA\u03b12-6Gal receptors, which are essential for endocytosis [18], [19]. HA unfold and expose the interior HA2 subunits in the acid environment, then the fusion peptides in HA2 insert themselves into the host membrane (viral membrane fusion) [20], [21].",

Various studies have reported that some of the factors that influence HA include the number of the basic residues in the HA0 cleavage site, the mutation of key residues in the RBD, the changing of antigenic sites or N-glycosylation sites (glycosites) and the variation of the topology of N-glycan structures [15], [27]. Meanwhile, the factors that influence NA include deletion of the stalk domain, the mutations drug-resistance, as well as the changing of antigen sites or glycosites and the variation of the topology of N-glycan structures [28]. As a kind of glycan-binding protein (GBP), HA works with NA, which functions as an exoglycosidase, cooperatively. Only by achieving a dynamic equilibrium between attaching to the host and releasing progeny virions can the IVs gain a long-term mechanism for infection and diffusion.",

The biosynthesis and modification of nascent secretory or membrane proteins occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi, N-linked glycans encode crucial information for the folding, maturation, transport or degradation of proteins [29]. To escape both the host's humoral and cellular immune systems, the potential glycosites in viral envelope proteins can provide the identical glycans as those of the host's cells to mask the antigenic sites [28], [30]. Additionally, glycosylation also impacts the sensitivity of HA to temperature, the protection of cleavage sites and the stalk domain, and even the receptor-binding preferences [31]\u2013[33]. As the ideal model for the influence of N-glycosylation in pathogen-host interaction, the present studies show that the envelope glycoproteins of IVs appear to only have N-glycosylation, with no O-glycosylation and GPI-anchors [34]; hence, the glycosites discussed in this paper only pertain to N-glycosylation site.",

In addition, another highly conserved glycosite appears at C-terminal part of the HA1 sequence, which is near the connection of the global and stalk domains, except in H7 and H15 sequences [52]. Three to ten characteristic glycosites were distinctive in each subtype. Their conservative rates were influenced by different internal evolution branches, ranked from 0.5% (e.g., 292NGS with 2.85% in H3) to 100% (e.g., 38NGT with 99.94% in H3), distributed mainly in the global domain.

Additionally, no such glycosylation appeared in those H1N1 viruses isolated from swine H1N1 flu (e.g., A/swine/Guangdong/1604/2010 (H1N1)), Spanish flu (e.g., A/South Carolina/1/1918 (H1N1)) and the 2009 influenza pandemic (H1N1) (e.g., A/Mexico city/CIA1/2009 (H1N1)). It has been partially shown that vaccination of mice with the 1918 influenza strain protected against subsequent lethal infection by the 2009 virus; however, the 1918 strain did not protect against the seasonal H1N1 flu [56]. It is interesting to note that the migration of the 179NKS to 177NLS tracks with these effects. Almost all of the 179NKS glycosites identified were centralized in swine-origin influenza viruses (S-OIVs, e.g., A/Swine/Guandong/1604/2010 (H1N1)) and parts of the 2009 influeza pandemic H1N1 virus (e.g., A/Mexico City/014/2009 (H1N1)), while the 177NLS glycosite was mainly found in the swine or human H1N2 viruses (e.g., A/New York/481/2003 (H1N2)) and most seasonal flu viruses (e.g., A/California/04/2007 (H1N1)). These date further confirm that the HA of the 2009 influenza pandemic (H1N1) originated from S-OIV, not previous seasonal virus [57]. Similar positional conversion of the glycosites in H5N1 caused by \u201cantigenic drift\u201d was the \u201c179NYT/181NNT\u201d. The conserved 181NNT glycosites have been replaced by the 179NYT in parts of clade 7 viruses since 2005. It reminds us that although these glycosites were adjacent, their N-glycans would shield different antigenic sites, which would provide some suggestions for the development of influenza vaccine.",

Wagner et al. believed that a longer stem domain would enhance the replication capacity of the virus, while the deletion of the stem domain would decrease the enzymatic activity of NA [63].

The results of the molecular dynamics simulation indicated that the \u03b12-3-sialoglycans adopted a straight-like and outward topology structure while the \u03b12-6-sialoglycans were fishhook-like and inward; therefore, we inferred that the that the deficiency of the glycosite would benefit the binding of SA\u03b12-3Gal sialoglycans [68].

In general, two highly conserved glycosites near the HA0 cleavage site and fusion peptide site may maintain the basic function of HA; these sites were seldom absent in the HA subtypes. More glycosites were identified in the global domain or in the connection of global and stalk domains, along with long-term and large-scale epidemics in several of the subtypes. The distributional regularity of the glycosites in the NA subtypes is also complex; two to four glycosites located in the stalk domain are highly conserved in various subtypes, and are affected by the deletion of the stalk domain. Another highly conserved glycosite was found at the tip of tetramer NA in all subtypes. Other glycosites were found to be mainly concentrated in the global domain, which surrounds the antigenic sites.",

Since 2003, the H5N1 virus has exhibited a rapid evolutionary dynamic. Under the selection pressure of different hosts and antigenic drift, the glycosite pattern of current H5N1 viruses in different geographical locations has been distinctive: the HA in clade 2.2.1.1, isolated from Egypt, lacked the 181N glycosite but had added the 88NVS glycosite. In addition, the HA in clade 2.3.2.1, isolated from China or Vietnam, lacked the 170N glycosite but had added the 152N glycosite. In contrast, as the glycosites in HA became more diverse in the H5N1 virus, the glycosylation in NA was impaired by a decreasing number of glycosites.
