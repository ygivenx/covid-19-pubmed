Lytic (virulent) phages bind to specific host\u2010cell receptors, then penetrate and infect their host cell to hijack its replication and translation machinery to produce virions; once sufficient virions have accumulated (tens to thousands, depending on the phage), the lytic enzymes they produce cause the host cell to lyse, releasing the virions into the surrounding environment where they can infect new host cells. Lytic phages can have narrow or broad host ranges, infecting only one strain of a prokaryote or multiple species of closely related prokaryotes. These entities have been used in the past to treat infections, and have recently been revisited as alternatives to antibiotic therapies for a range of infections and as means of controlling food\u2010contaminating bacteria such as Listeria spp.3 Their gene products are also of interest in biotechnological and medical applications.4 Lysogenic (temperate) phages do not kill their host but instead integrate into their host's genome without interfering with its replication, incorporating the phage into its genome as a prophage that is transmitted to its progeny at each cell division. Lysogenic phages can be converted to a lytic cycle in response to environmental stressors (eg, antibiotics).",

While in its infancy, this work holds great promise for improving our knowledge of the gut virome, will facilitate metagenomic studies and aid in vitro and in vivo studies investigating the influence of phages on prokaryote populations in the human gut. Significant improvements to isolation methods are needed to allow the efficient and reliable isolation and characterisation of phages infecting fastidious anaerobic prokaryotes.

Induction of lysogeny may have contributed to changes in phage abundance during the dietary intervention, though this has not been demonstrated empirically. In contrast to total faecal metagenomes, which were enriched in genes for synthesis (amino acid, carbohydrate precursors), translational machinery and cell component biogenesis, VLPs were enriched for genes associated with replication, recombination, repair and unknown functions; consistent with viruses recruiting host\u2010cell machinery for their propagation. Findings regarding prophages were not in accord with previous studies (they did far more in\u2010depth analyses than previous studies): 2814 contigs had significant amino acid homology with an ACLAME prophage sequence, 41% were assigned to Firmicutes, 0.9% were assigned to Bacteroidetes, 16% were assigned to the Proteobacteria.20 This pattern did not match abundance of bacteria within samples, leading to the suggestion prevalence of temperate phages in faeces may differ among different phyla with the caveat that conclusions were dependent on phage sequences available in public databases at the time of the study.

Antibiotic therapy influences viromes, not by affecting VLPs directly but by affecting their prokaryote hosts.35 For example, quinolones have been shown to induce Shiga\u2010toxin\u2010encoding prophages by Escherichia coli in mice, leading to toxin production and death of animals.36 In a longitudinal study involving four individuals on various broad\u2010spectrum, long\u2010term intravenous antibiotic therapies for Staphylococcus infections, oral viromes were affected more than faecal viromes by antibiotic treatment, with an increase in representation of papillomaviruses in the oral virome of antibiotic\u2010treated patients.35 A nonsignificant increase in antibiotic\u2010resistance genes was seen in the faecal viromes of the patients. It was suggested sampling of individuals should be done at more regular intervals to get a true picture of the effect of antibiotics on viromes. It should also be noted the study was hampered by confounders relating to age of patients compared with controls and the patients being on different treatment regimes.",

The same anelloviruses were detected in faecal samples of the same infant collected 12 months apart, suggesting a persistent or stable source of recurring infection.46 It was speculated the increase in anelloviruses between 6 and 12 months was the result of lowered immune status associated with the decrease in maternal IgG, though no data were provided to support this. Eukaryotic viral (DNA) richness was low at 3 months but increased thereafter, indicating environmental exposure contributes to the establishment of this component of the virome. Eukaryotic RNA viruses (ssRNA\u2014alphaflexiviruses, astrovirsues, caliciviruses, picornoviruses, tombamoviruses, virgaviruses; dsRNA\u2014chrysoviruses, picobirnaviruses) were detected less frequently across the study period, but related twins harboured the same strains of parechovirus and enterovirus. Phages were detected at high abundance in all infants across the study period, with the majority of reads belonging to the order Caudovirales (Siphoviridae > Myoviridae > Podoviridae), Inoviridae (ssDNA), Microviridae (ssDNA), Corticoviridae and Tectiviridae. No RNA phages were detected in any of the faecal samples. Phage richness and diversity were greatest at month 0 and decreased as the infants aged, and the relative abundance of Caudovirales (high at 0 months, low at 24 months) was inversely correlated with the abundance of Microviridae. crAssphage22 was detected in one sample of one infant, suggesting this phage is not acquired early in life. Of note, reads associated with the family Lipothrixviridae, an archaeal virus family, were detected in the faecal virome of all twins at various points across the study period. Each infant had a unique faecal virome, though the viromes of related infants were more similar to one another than nonrelated infants after controlling for age. Bacterial species richness and diversity increased with age, being predominated by Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria at 24 months. An inverse correlation of phage and bacterial richness (high phage\u2013low bacteria to low phage\u2013high bacteria) was seen from month 0 to 24 months. The infant faecal virome is suggested, therefore, to display a reversed predator\u2010prey cycle: ie, limited prey diversity controls predator abundance.46 The initially high phage population is unsustainable because of low numbers of bacteria colonising the GI tract. Consequently, the phage assemblage shrinks in size and diversity, relieving pressure on the bacterial community and allowing it to establish and colonise the gut.",

For example, when using the WTA2 kit it is recommended to use the Nextera XT library preparation kit to avoid cluster\u2010calling problems during Illumina sequencing. However, the Nextera kit causes under\u2010representation of ends of viral genomes because of the way this kit works.66 CsCl centrifugation has been shown to be the most efficient method for removing host DNA, but it discriminates against some phages and is not reproducible; consequently, this method is not suitable for quantitative studies.67\n",

The question will then become how many sequence data are required to adequately characterise the virome. Current sequencing depths and paucity of available virus genome sequences (Figure 2) may mean phages that infect different bacterial hosts may be indistinguishable.20 Low sequencing depth also means low coverage of VLP genomes within samples, making it difficult to differentiate between spurious alignments and real virus sequences and potentially leading to overestimation of VLPs in samples when relying on automated read alignments.68 Bioinformatics tools are required that allow differentiation of authentic sequences from artefacts.",

Because most nucleotide sequences obtained from viral metagenomes are novel, BLASTN analyses are generally uninformative.71 It has been stated that isolating \u201cjust a few phage genomes from novel environments will greatly increase our understanding of viral diversity in these environments\u201d.72 Recently, OligoNucleotide Frequency profiling, in conjunction with abundance profiling and homology methods, has been proposed as a means of improving identification of microbial hosts for novel viruses from total community metagenomes73, 74; deriving full benefit from this approach relies on classical isolation and genomic characterisation of viruses and their hosts from environmental samples. Therefore, it is of utmost importance that isolation of phages from the GI tract and their genomic characterisation are at the forefront of future research: incorporation of ecological studies into those exploiting lytic phages or phage\u2010encoded gene products for biotechnological or medical applications would be of great benefit to the research community.",

As of July 2017, there are ~2040 complete genome sequences available for the Caudovirales, the main order of phages (Figure 2). Our coverage of eukaryote\u2010associated infectious viruses is equally poor, mostly because we do not (1) know how to propagate known infectious agents and (2) there are a number of medical conditions speculated to be linked with viral infections (eg, type I diabetes, chronic fatigue syndrome, obesity) but for which no infectious agent has been found. It has been estimated over half of human\u2010infecting viruses remain to be discovered.76 Numerous conditions in which patients suffer unexplained symptoms may also be virus\u2010associated. Therefore, there is a need to sample a wide range of body fluids and tissues from individuals globally to better understand the role of viruses in human health and disease.75 Propagation and characterisation of prokaryote\u2010 and eukaryote\u2010infecting viruses will require huge efforts to fully characterise extant viral populations, and there is still a wealth of viral diversity (pathogenic and nonpathogenic) to be discovered within human viromes. Those in areas with poor sanitation and crowded living conditions, travellers, children and the immunocompromised are expected to have higher viral loads, at least in terms of potentially pathogenic viruses,75 while pre\u2010term infants, breast\u2010 and formula\u2010fed infants and the elderly are likely to have very different viromes compared with adults based on the general information we have about the composition of the human gut microbiome throughout life.27, 50 Interactions with pets, insects and wild animals will also influence the composition of the human virome. From a pathogen perspective, bush\u2010workers, abattoir workers and individuals exposed to insect bites have been highlighted as likely sources of new human\u2010infecting viruses.75\n",
