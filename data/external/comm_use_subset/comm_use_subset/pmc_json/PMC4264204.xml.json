            "text": "Aromatase is a cytochrome P-450 dependent enzyme that catalyzes the aromatization of androgens to estrogens. Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) reduce the synthesis of estrogens and offer a therapeutic alternative for the treatment of estrogen-dependent cancers, such as breast cancer [1,2,3]. There are two classes of AIs, steroidal and non-steroidal compounds, which cause potent estrogen suppression [4]. The non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors (NSAIs) are mostly azole type compounds, such as the clinically used anastrozole and letrozole, which compete with the substrate for binding to the enzyme active site [5]. Among steroidal aromatase inhibitors (SAIs), formestane was widely used during the early 1990s, but it is not used nowadays because of the need to administer it by intramuscular injection. Therefore, the orally active exemestane is the main steroidal inhibitor [6]. These SAIs mimic the natural substrate androstenedione and are converted by the enzyme to reactive intermediates, which bind irreversibly to the enzyme active site, resulting in inactivation of aromatase [7]. Despite the success of the third-generation NSAIs (anastrazole and letrozole) and SAIs (exemestane), they still have some major side effects, such as increase of bone loss, joint pain, and heart problems [8]. In addition, after some years of usage they can develop cellular resistance. For these reasons, it is important to search for other potent and specific molecules with lower side effects and which can overcome the resistance phenomena.",

Comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) and comparative molecular similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA) are two of the most widely used three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D QSAR) methodologies. CoMFA calculates the energies of steric and electrostatic interactions between the compound and the probe atom at various intersections of a regular 3D lattice according to Lennard-Jones and Coulomb potentials. The resulting energies derived from these two potential functions can be contoured to offer a quantitative spatial description of the molecular properties [17]. CoMSIA introduces the Gaussian function for the distance dependence between the molecular atoms and the probe atom in order to avoid some inherent deficiencies arising from the Lennard-Jones and Coulomb potential functional forms. CoMSIA is applied to gain an insight into how steric fields, electrostatic fields, hydrophobic fields, hydrogen bond donor (HBD) and hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) influence the activity of inhibitors [18].",

Pharmacophore searches are the best option to find a range of chemical structures with viable features. A pharmacophore model can be considered as the ensemble of steric and electrostatic features of different compounds, which are necessary to ensure optimal supramolecular interactions with a specific biological target structure and to trigger or to block its biological response. Thus, pharmacophore modeling is the method of choice for the first round of compound selection. This ability of a pharmacophore model is used to find new classes of inhibitors when one class is known. This is known as \u201cscaffold hopping\u201d [19,20,21].",

However, for CoMSIA models, the model with global descriptors is not the best model in all probability. Some papers [28,29] have discussed whether the five different descriptor fields in CoMSIA are totally independent of each other. The dependencies of the individual fields usually decrease the signal-to-noise ratio in the data [29] and lower the statistical significance of the results. Therefore, in our study, an optimization of 31 possible combinations of five different descriptor fields was evaluated from the values of the q2, which is shown in Figure 1. The higher the value of q2 shows, the better the model is. With the highest q2 of 0.843, CoMSIA model with the combination of steric and HBA fields (SA) was finally chosen as the best model, which indicates that the steric and HBA fields mainly contribute to the binding affinities. This CoMSIA (SA) model was obtained with seventeen optimal components. The analysis results are summarized in Table 2 (q2 = 0.843, r2ncv = 0.989, F = 174.304, SEE = 0.096).

It can be seen that a large green contour near C-6 of the ring B indicates a bulky group in this position is favorable to bioactivity.

It also can be observed that there are two large yellow contours: one is next to C-3 of the ring A, and another is near C-15 and C-16 of the ring D, which suggests that a bulky group in the two regions will decrease inhibitory activity. It is confirmed by the fact that compound 17 with bulky substitution on C-3 of the ring A has lower bioactivity than compound 14 with small substitution in that position, and all the compounds with bulky groups near C-15 and C-16 of the ring D (compounds 1\u20133, compounds 29\u201366) show low bioactivities (pIC50 < 6).",

It is clear that the distribution of steric field in CoMSIA is basically consistent with CoMFA results. A little difference is that there is a yellow contour below the large green contour, which indicates a proper bulky substituent on C-6 of the ring B, is favorable to bioactivity while too large substituent in that position is unfavorable.

All the twenty models had Pareto rank 0, which means no one model is superior to any other one. Model_03 has very high energy, which is recognized that a high-energy value is due to steric clashes [30]. Small value of energy and high values of Specificity, N_hits, Sterics and Mol_Qry are desired for the best model [31].

Among the inhibitors, the crystal structure of compound 7 bound with aromatase is available from the protein data bank (PDB code: 4GL7) [23]. Therefore, compound 7 was extracted from the complex and chosen to define the most likely binding conformation, which was modified by adding hydrogen atoms without any change of conformation and was minimized with the following steps: (i) Optimization by Steepest Descent with initial optimization of 200 simplex iterations using Tripos force field and Gasteiger-Marsili charges; (ii) Optimization by conjugate gradient; and (iii) Optimization by BFGS [34]. Three-dimensional structures of the other molecules were constructed from the compound 7. Energy minimizations of each compound were performed according to the above procedure. In the present study, compound 7 was used as a template because of its highest activity and all other compounds were aligned on the basis of the common structure shown in Figure 7. The alignment of training and test compounds is shown in Figure 8.",

The grid pattern extended 4.0 \u00c5 units in all directions beyond the dimensions of each molecule. The steric and electrostatic probe-ligand interaction energies were calculated by using a sp3 carbon probe atom and a +1.0 charge with a distance-dependent dielectric function at each lattice point.

CoMSIA models were also derived with the same lattice box and all five fields were calculated using a probe of charge +1, a radius of 1, hydrophobicity and hydrogen bonding properties of +1, and an attenuation factor of 0.3 for the Gaussian distance-dependent function [18].",

PLS method with cross-validation (leave-one-out) was used in SYBYL to determine the optimal numbers of components by using cross-validated coefficient q2 (r2cv). After obtaining the optimal numbers of components, a PLS analysis was performed with no validation and column filtering 2.0 to generate the final model with the training set. The obtained final non-cross-validated correlation coefficient (r2ncv) is a measure of the quality of the model. The predictive capability of the 3D QSAR models was determined from the predictive correlation (r2pred). The predicted activities for the test set were obtained from the model produced by the training set.",

In order to search for more potent SAIs with lower side effects and overcome the drug resistance, 3D QSAR studies, pharmacophore modeling and virtual screening were performed. The 3D QSAR techniques, CoMFA and CoMSIA, were applied for the first time to 66 new-synthesized SAIs, and the obtained models show good statistical results, q2 = 0.636, r2ncv = 0.988, r2pred = 0.658 for CoMFA and q2 = 0.843, r2ncv = 0.989, r2pred = 0.601 for CoMSIA, which indicate that both of the models have good quality and predictive ability. CoMFA and CoMSIA contour maps show that a proper bulky group near C-6 is favorable for activity while a bulky group near C-3, C-15 and C-16 is unfavorable, and the hydrogen bond acceptor atoms on C-3, C-4 and C-17 can enhance the bioactivity. In addition, pharmacophore models were derived from eight highly active and structurally diverse compounds using GALAHAD. The obtained best pharmacophore model includes two acceptor atoms and four hydrophobic centers, which was used as a query to search NCI2000 database. Six hit compounds were obtained after the screening of the pharmacophore query, and their pIC50 values were further predicted using the obtained CoMFA and CoMSIA models, which are expected to design potent and novel SAIs. The present 3D QSAR, pharmacophore modeling, and virtual screening approach provide useful information to design and synthesize potent and novel SAIs.",
