Examples of viruses include human papilloma viruses (HPVs) in cervical cancer, epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in nasopharyngeal cancer, hepatitis B and C in liver cancer (HBV and HCV), human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8) in Kaposi sarcoma (KS); human T-lymphotrophic virus-1 (HTLV-1) in adult T cell lymphocytic leukemia (ATL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma; merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV) in Merkel cell carcinoma (ACS, 2007). Bacteria such as Helicobacter pylori have been implicated in stomach cancer. Parasites have also been associated with cancer, examples are Opisthorchis viverrini and Clonorchis sinensis in bile duct cancer and Schistosoma haematobium in bladder cancer (ACS, 2007). Detection and characterization of these infectious agents in tumor samples can give us better insights into disease mechanisms and their treatment (Hausen, 2000).",

These include the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA or EIA) (Yoshihara, 1995), chemluminescent immunoassay (ChLIA), Indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA), Western blot (WB), Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), and Rapid immunoassays1. ELISA and WB test detects and measures antibodies in serum taken from the patient's blood, and are typically prescribed after certain symptoms are observed in the patient.",

NGS technologies are able to perform rapid sequencing, and in a massively parallel fashion (Datta et al., 2015). In recent years, applications of NGS technologies in clinical diagnostics have been on the rise (Barzon et al., 2011; Byron et al., 2016). Amongst the various NGS technologies, whole-transcriptome sequencing, also called RNA-seq, has been very popular with methods and tools being actively developed. Exploring the genome using RNA-seq gives a different insight than looking at the DNA since the RNA-seq would have captured actively transcribed regions. Every aspect of data output from this technology is now being used for research, including detection of viruses and bacteria (Khoury et al., 2013; Salyakina and Tsinoremas, 2013; Wang et al., 2016). They are also independent of prior sequence information, and require less starting material compared to conventional cloning based methods, making them powerful and exciting new technologies in virology (Datta et al., 2015). These high throughput technologies give us direct evidence of infection in the tissue as compared to ELISA-based assays, which only proves presence of infection somewhere in the human body. RNA-seq technology has hence enabled the exploration and detection of viral infections in human tumor samples. This technology also enables detection of variants in viral genome, which have been connected to clinical outcome (Moyes et al., 2005; Downey et al., 2015).",

We found existing RNA-seq quantification tools to be not sensitive enough for viruses, and hence developed our own algorithm for this module. Our in-house algorithm used region-based information from the general-feature-format (GFF) files5 of each viral genome, and the reads from the BAM file. It created a summary file, which had a total count of reads within or on the boundary of each region in the GFF file. This is repeated for each sample and for each viral GFF file. At the end, a matrix is obtained where the features (rows) are regions from the GFF file, and the columns are samples. The read count output from Module 3 (viral gene expression module) allowed for downstream differential expression analysis of viral genes between case and controls groups. The source code for our in-house algorithm, written using the R programming language (R Core Team, 2014), has been made public at available at github.com/ICBI/viGEN.",

The Viral reference file was created from combining all known and sequenced human viruses obtained from NCBI2. Because viral variants are known to be low frequency, we have selected a variant calling tool Varscan2 (Koboldt et al., 2012), which allows detection of low-frequency variants (Spencer et al., 2014). Low quality and low depth variants were flagged, but not filtered out, in case these low values were due to low viral load. Once the variants were obtained, they were merged to form a multi-sample VCF file. Only variants that had a variant in two or more samples were retained. PLINK (Chang et al., 2015) was used to perform case-control association test (Fishers Exact Test) to compare groups.",

These variants map to frameshift and missense mutations in the putative envelope protein of this virus (Q779_gp1, also called \u201cenv\u201d). Studies have shown that this envelope protein mediates infections of cells (Robinson and Whelan, 2016). HERV K113 is a provirus and is capable of producing intact viral particles (Boller et al., 2008). Studies have shown a strong association between HERV-K antibodies and clinical manifestation of disease and therapeutic response (Moyes et al., 2005; Downey et al., 2015). It is hypothesized that retroviral gene products can be \u201creawakened\u201d when genetic damage occurs through mutations, frameshifts and chromosome breaks. Even though the direct oncogenic effects of HERVs in cancer are yet to be completely understood, it has shown potential as diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers and for immunotherapeutic purposes including vaccines (Downey et al., 2015).",
