            "text": "\nMycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), a disease existing for millennia and still remaining a major global health problem. Primary infection occurs by inhaling aerosol particles containing bacteria. Mtb is able to replicate inside alveolar macrophages and inflammatory cells recruited at the infection site determine formation of a histological pulmonary lesion named granuloma. In most cases Mtb is never cleared and survives inside granulomas in a non-replicative and non-infectious state known as latency1. Around one third of the world\u2019s population is affected by latent TB. Latently infected individuals have 5\u201315% probability to develop the active disease during their lifetime. According to the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) report, 10.4 million new TB cases were estimated worldwide, with 480,000 new cases of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and 1.4 million deaths. In addition, the emergence of extensively drug\u2013resistant TB (XDR-TB) and totally drug\u2013resistant TB (TDR-TB) is becoming one of the biggest threats to public health and TB control programs2. Therefore, new insights into Mtb physiology are required to better characterize the pathogenesis mechanisms that Mtb exploits to survive and persist in its host, in order to individuate strategies to eradicate this ancient pathogen.",

            "text": "G-quadruplexes (G4s) are nucleic acids secondary structures that may form in single-stranded G-rich sequences under physiological conditions3. Four Gs bind via Hoogsteen-type hydrogen bonds base-pairing to yield G-quartets, which stack to form the G4. The presence of K+ cations specifically supports G4 formation and stability4. Based on the strand orientation, G4s can adopt three main topologies: parallel, antiparallel, and hybrid-type structures. Stability studies about the formation of G4s have demonstrated that these non-canonical DNA secondary structures are able to destabilize the double helix, since many G4 structures are thermodynamically more stable than double stranded DNA and their unfolding kinetics are significantly slower5, 6. In eukaryotes G4s have been reported to be involved in key regulatory roles, including transcriptional regulation of gene promoters and enhancers, translation, chromatin epigenetic regulation, DNA recombination6\u201310. Expansion of G4-forming motifs has been associated with relevant human neurological disorders8, 11. Formation of G4s in vivo has been consolidated by the discovery of cellular proteins that specifically recognize G4s12, 13 and the development of G4 specific antibodies14, 15. In viruses G4s have been implicated in key steps16: in the human immunodeficiency virus, the presence of functionally significant G4s10, 13, 17\u201319 and their targeting by G4 ligands with consequent antiviral effects10, 20, 21 have been reported. G4s have been also discovered in herpesviruses22\u201325, SARS coronavirus26 and human papilloma, Zika, Ebola and hepatitis C virus genomes27\u201330.",

A G4 was reported when at least four consecutive G-islands (n = 4) were identified. We also defined two parameters, l and d, corresponding to the minimal length of a G4 homopolymeric G-island and the maximum allowed distance between consecutive G-islands, respectively. Different combinations of l and d parameters were applied to allow the detection of G4 motifs with increasing stringency (i.e. 2 \u2264 l \u2264 5 and d = 7, 11, and 15); we chose G4s with loop length up to 15 nucleotides since it has been reported that they can fold into stable G4s59. Computational searches have detected a high concentration of G4 motifs near promoter regions both in eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes and in some cases a possible role of G4 motifs in transcription regulation has been reported60. For this reason and because of the abundance of GC content in Mtb, we restricted G4 analysis to regions close to transcription start sites (TSS). A short and a long score were computed considering 15 and 50 nucleotides, respectively, both upstream and downstream of the G4 motif, according to Beaudoin et al.61 (Table 1).\n",

Cultures were then grown up to mid-exponential phase (OD540 0.6\u20130.8) and then diluted to an OD540 of 0.01. Microplates suitable for fluorescence reading (96-well FluoroNuncTM black flat bottom plates) were used to determine the MIC of each bacterial strain. Serial dilutions were used to dispense the correct amount of each compound in each well. Each well was than inoculated with a bacterial suspension containing 5 \u00d7 104 cfu. The plates thus obtained were sealed and incubated for 1 week at 37 \u00b0C. After incubation, 10 \u00b5l (10% of final volume) of Alamar-Blue (Invitrogen) was added to each well and the plates, after another day of incubation at 37 \u00b0C, were read on a microplate reader (Tecan Infinite 200 Pro) to determine the relative fluorescence (excitation 535 nm and emission 590 nm). For each strain we used a positive control (cells without antibiotic) to determine the maximum fluorescence that could be obtained, and a negative control (medium plus antibiotic without cells).",
