It has a range of functions that affect gene expression including regulation of transcription, alternative splicing, microRNA biogenesis, and RNA transport and translation (reviewed in [3\u20135]). Under normal physiological conditions, TDP-43 is predominantly localized in the nucleus [6], but is synthesized in the cytoplasm [7] and is shuttled between the nucleus and cytoplasm in a transcription dependent manner [8]. Several neurodegenerative diseases display TDP-43 pathology [4], and TDP-43 was identified as the main component of the distinctive cytoplasmic aggregates seen in ALS and FTLD-TDP [9]. In the pathological state, TDP-43 is cleared from the nucleus and mislocalized in the cytoplasm or neurites, in addition to being hyperphosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and cleaved [9\u201311].",

We previously [13] developed a tet-off inducible transgenic mouse overexpressing human TDP-43 (hTDP-43) with a mutated (K82A/R83A/K84A) nuclear localization signal (\u0394NLS-hTDP-43) so that the protein preferentially localizes to the cytoplasm [7]. Despite the mainly cytoplasmic mislocalization of the hTDP-43 protein product, these mice did not exhibit a significant number of cytoplasmic aggregates. Interestingly, there was a time-dependent neurodegeneration which coincided with dramatic changes in gene expression as measured by microarray. An intriguing aspect of the observed gene expression effects was a selective and significant upregulation of chromatin assembly and histone genes, hinting at a role for TDP-43 in transcription and histone transcript stability.",

This revealed significant changes in multiple molecular pathways, including confirmation that cytoplasmic TDP-43 expression alters transcription related pathways and histone transcript levels. Supporting a gain of cytoplasmic function mechanism, biochemical analysis of nuclear and cytosolic fractions of the \u0394NLS-hTDP-43 mice brains showed that total nuclear TDP-43 expression is largely unaltered, suggesting that the exogenous human TDP-43 is able to compensate for autoregulatory reduction of endogenous nuclear mTDP-43. The transcriptomic changes were compared with RNA sequencing data from mice with reduced levels of TDP-43 after injection with an ASO against TDP-43 [14], revealing a complete absence of correlation between the two experiments, showing that the main effects of overexpressing \u0394NLS-hTDP-43 are likely not due to the loss of TDP-43 function. Furthermore, we identify dysregulation of the histone 3\u2019 end processing machinery upon transgene overexpression, identifying a mechanism by which overexpression of the \u0394NLS-hTDP-43 transgene impairs the transcriptional machinery.",

Briefly, a Camk2\u03b1 promoter was used to drive expression of the tetracycline transactivator protein (Camk2\u03b1-tTa), and a tetracycline responsive promoter was used to drive \u0394NLS-hTDP-43 expression (tetO-\u0394NLS-hTDP-43) such that \u0394NLS-hTDP-43 protein expression was inhibited by doxycycline in bigenic mice (Camk2a-tTa x tetO-\u0394NLS-hTDP-43). Expression was repressed in bigenic mice (n = 4, 3 male) with a doxycycline diet until 28 days of age at which time expression was induced by removal of the doxycycline diet. RNA was obtained 10 days later because this is when neurodegeneration began in these mice [13]. Nontransgenic mice (n = 4, 3 male) bred from heterozygous parents for Camk2\u03b1-tTa and \u0394NLS-hTDP-43 were used as controls, and followed the same diet timeline to control for doxycycline effects. RNA-seq libraries were constructed and sequenced as previously described [15], with mean RNA integrity number (RIN) 8.74. After mouse sacrifice, the right cortex was extracted and solubilized in TRIzol and treated with DNase. Polyadenylated messenger RNA was selected using the Dynabeads mRNA direct kit (Invitrogen), followed by fragmentation, 5\u2019 phosphate addition, size selection, Illumina v1.5 RNA adapter ligation, cDNA library generation, PCR amplification, and purification before sequencing on an Illumina Genome Analyzer II. Raw reads and processed data have been deposited in NCBI\u2019s Gene Expression Omnibus repository [16] and are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE65973.",

Only uniquely mapping reads were considered for further analysis except for histone analysis (see below). Coverage of the protein-coding segment of the genome was computed using the bedtools coverage [19] tool against the RefSeq mm9 genome, and coverage of the entire genome was computed using the bedtools genomecov [19] tool. The mapped reads from the RNA sequencing pipeline were analyzed for differential expression by using bedtools multicov [19] to compute the number of reads mapping to each exon. Exon counts were merged into gene counts using bedtools groupBy [19], which were then analyzed for differential expression with the DESeq2 R package [20]. Splicing analysis was performed using the DEXSeq R package [21] following the protocol described in the paper and vignette. Briefly, exon reads were counted using the dexseq_count.py script and read into R [22], where the DEXSeq analysis pipeline was followed using the Ensembl mm9 genome annotation [23]. For both the differential expression and the differential splicing analyses, significantly differentially expressed genes/exons were defined as having an adjusted p-value of less than 0.05 using the Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction [24].",

To normalize, we chose 50 random unchanging genes, defined as having an adjusted DESeq2 p-value of greater than 0.5, and mapped them with up to 10 multimappings as well. Then, we took the geometric mean of the unchanging gene coverage for each sample, and converted these means into normalization factors by dividing them all by the mean of the geometric means of the nontransgenic samples. All histone genes with no coverage were converted to 0.1, the lowest possible coverage, and histone values were divided by the normalization factors. Finally, we took the separate geometric mean in each sample for the normalized canonical and variant histone genes.

Additional 1.6M sucrose in TKM was then added to obtain ~4 mL of homogenate, which was overlaid on 3 mL of 1.8M sucrose in TKM followed by ultracentrifugation at 100,000xg for one hour at 4\u00b0C. The pellets were resuspended in 30 \u03bcL of PBS with protease inhibitors, and nuclei were counted using a hemocytometer. Finally, based on the nuclei counts, nuclei were diluted in PBS with protease inhibitors so that all samples contained the same concentration of nuclei. Sample buffer was added to all fractions followed by sonication and freezing at -80\u00b0C until SDS-PAGE analysis.

Of these genes, 2,166 were upregulated in the \u0394NLS mice compared to the control mice, and the remaining 2,155 were downregulated (Fig 1a). By principal component analysis, the bigenic mice and the nontransgenic mice overall clustered separately, indicating a robust change in the transcriptome due to overexpression of \u0394NLS-hTDP-43 (Fig 1b). Comparison of these results with the previous microarray analysis [13] found that 7,696 of the 10,601 genes meeting the minimum read threshold had matching probes in the microarray, including just 3,092 of the 4,321 significantly differentially expressed genes, illustrating the increased sensitivity of RNA sequencing over microarray technology.

Several transcripts regulate transcription and RNA processing, including Srsf5, which is part of the serine/arginine rich family of proteins that are involved in splicing as well as other aspects of gene expression [31], Med20, an essential component of the Mediator complex that regulates transcription [32], and Usp49, a histone H2B deubiquitinase which has been shown to regulate splicing [33]. Other transcripts are involved in cell signaling and membrane activity, notably Nrcam, a cell surface molecule that has been associated with autism [34,35]. However, given that TDP-43 has known effects on RNA splicing within the nucleus, the relative paucity of splicing alterations observed here suggest that the main transcriptomic effects of \u0394NLS-hTDP-43 overexpression may be due to a gain of cytoplasmic function and not a loss of nuclear splicing function. Alternatively, TDP-43 has several other RNA functions other than splicing which were not directly assessed here.",

The relative absence of splicing alterations in \u0394NLS-hTDP-43 mice suggests that at least some TDP-43 protein was present within the nucleus, resulting in functional recovery from the loss of mTDP-43 in terms of splicing and supporting the idea that the effects of transgene overexpression are mainly due to cytoplasmic gain of function. To biochemically investigate the levels of TDP-43 protein in \u0394NLS-hTDP-43 expressing mice, we performed nuclear and cytosolic fractionation on neocortex from bigenic (Camk2a-tTa x tetO-\u0394NLS-hTDP-43) and non-transgenic or monogenic control mice. Samples were immunoblotted for total (mouse and human) TDP-43 protein. As expected, the bigenic mice showed increased cytosolic levels of total TDP-43 (Fig 2). Moreover, total nuclear TDP-43 protein was slightly higher in \u0394NLS-hTDP-43 mice relative to control mice, suggesting that the exogenous hTDP-43 is indeed able to localize to the nucleus despite the mutation in the NLS. This slight nuclear increase may also contribute to toxicity. The lack of histone H3 in the cytosolic fraction and the lack of HSP90 in the nuclear fraction confirmed successful fractionation. These results demonstrate that \u0394NLS-hTDP-43 overexpression leads to a marked increase in cytoplasmic TDP-43 protein with relative preservation of total nuclear TDP-43 protein levels, despite the loss of endogenous mTDP-43. The increased presence of cytoplasmic TDP-43 protein supports a gain of cytoplasmic function as one potential mechanism underlying the observed transcriptomic changes, but additional mechanistic studies to demonstrate this functionally are needed.",

While the differentially expressed genes in \u0394NLS-hTDP-43 mice seem to be mainly caused by a cytoplasmic gain of exogenous TDP-43 function as shown by Western blot analysis and the lack of splicing changes, the differentially expressed genes upon ASO knockdown are more likely to be directly linked to the loss of normal, endogenous TDP-43 protein.

Our analysis discovered many more genes than the 362 upregulated and 239 downregulated found in the original report, likely due to our improved mapping power as well as the statistical improvements of DESeq2 over the original approach, which used a simple Z score statistic based on the assumption of reads following a normal distribution to detect differential expression [14,20].

To demonstrate that this was not due to a lack of power to detect splicing changes in our analysis pipeline, we performed an identical DEXSeq analysis on the RNA sequencing data from the TDP-43 ASO knockdown experiment. Remarkably, 1,029 out of 250,620 exons were significantly differentially spliced upon ASO knockdown, corresponding to 752 unique genes (Fig 3e). The previously described splicing analysis of this data found 788 genes containing splicing alterations using a splicing sensitive microarray [27]. Comparison of our results with these results is not straightforward, as DEXSeq only identifies differential exon usage, while splicing microarrays assay other classes of splicing events including alternative transcription start sites and alternative 3\u2019 or 5\u2019 splice sites. In line with this, we found that 115 of the genes we identified as containing changes in exonic splicing events were present in the splicing microarray results. It is important to note that transcriptome wide splicing analysis is still difficult, with different technological platforms and computational methods yielding different results [36]. Despite the low overlap with the splicing microarray analysis, likely due to these technological differences, this analysis nevertheless supports the lack of alternative splicing events due to \u0394NLS-hTDP-43 overexpression. Given that the \u0394NLS and ASO experiments had similar numbers of uniquely mapped reads, the low number of alternative splicing events identified in the \u0394NLS mice does not appear to be due to insufficient read depth or inappropriate choice of methodology. Rather, there appears to be a real paucity of alternative splicing events upon \u0394NLS-hTDP-43 overexpression, supporting the hypothesis that the main effects of \u0394NLS-hTDP-43 are due to a cytoplasmic gain of function rather than a nuclear loss of function.",

These pathways appear to reflect an overall wound response with associated neuronal loss: nearly all of the downregulated pathways represent loss of neuronal function (including synaptic transmission, dendrite, synaptosome, neurotransmitter transport, synaptic vesicle, microtubule cytoskeleton, and many more). Additionally, almost all of the upregulated pathways appear to be related to inflammation and the wound response (including positive regulation of cell death, response to wounding, regulation of cytokine production, myeloid cell differentiation, T cell proliferation, and many more). This indicates that the transcriptomic changes seen in ASO mice may reflect not only the effects of knocking down TDP-43, but also changes due to reaction against the invasive injection of the antisense oligonucleotide [14].",

Out of 34 canonical histone genes and 15 variant histone genes, we only found 5 and 10, respectively, that met the read count threshold in our DESeq2 analysis. However, because the 3\u2019 ends of many histone mRNAs are identical and the coding sequence is highly conserved between histone transcripts [40], we reasoned that the DESeq2 analysis, which used only uniquely mapping reads, was limiting our ability to quantify the expression of histone transcripts. With this in mind, we allowed reads to multimap to up to 10 genomic loci within histone genes, weighted by the number of multimappings. Results were normalized against 50 random unchanging genes (see methods). Indeed, although some histone genes still had very low coverage, this analysis retrieved additional coverage for each of the 34 canonical and 15 variant histone genes (S3 Table). Analysis of the difference between bigenic and nontransgenic control histone gene coverage showed that the canonical histones were upregulated in the bigenic mice (fold change = 2.12, 2-sided t-test p = 0.046), while the variant histones were slightly but significantly downregulated in the bigenic mice (fold change = 0.841, 2-sided t-test p = 0.017) (Fig 4a). Notably, the significant upregulation of canonical histones in this poly(A)+ selected dataset implies that these transcripts were aberrantly polyadenylated, allowing our protocol to detect them.",

To test whether the observed changes in canonical histones were due to aberrant polyadenylation, we used both an oligo-dT primer, which selects for polyadenylated RNA transcripts, and random hexamer primers, which have no such selection bias. RT-qPCR measurements using either oligo-dT priming or random hexamer priming validated our RNA-seq data for transcripts which regulate histone 3\u2019 UTR processing (Fig 4d and 4e). Interestingly, in the oligo-dT primed experiment, canonical histone genes were significantly upregulated (Hist1h4 fold change = 2.07, t-test p = 0.0001; Hist1h3 fold change = 1.79, t-test p = 0.00003; Fig 4d), while the random hexamer primed experiments revealed no upregulation in these genes (Fig 4e). In fact, Hist1h4 was significantly downregulated in the bigenic mice when there was no poly(A)+ selection step (fold change = 0.74, t-test p = 0.003, Fig 4e). Visualized another way, comparison of the expression changes based on RNA-seq versus RT-qPCR showed a high correlation with the exception of the random hexamer primed canonical histone genes (Fig 4f, white boxes). This confirms that \u0394NLS-hTDP-43 expression leads to differential expression of transcripts which regulate histone 3\u2019 UTR processing, coincident with an upregulation in aberrantly polyadenylated canonical histone genes. Additional mechanistic studies are required to establish a direct link between \u0394NLS-hTDP-43 overexpression and the observed histone dysregulation, but these results suggest that this dysregulation may be mediated through changes in expression of histone 3\u2019 UTR processing genes.",

Histological analysis of the \u0394NLS-hTDP-43 expressing mouse brain sections stained with cresyl violet revealed widespread nuclear abnormalities (Fig 5a). Normal pyramidal neurons within the hippocampus demonstrate moderately sized nucleoli together with several additional foci of heterochromatin (n = 16 nontransgenic or monogenic mice). In contrast, hippocampal pyramidal neurons from bigenic mice demonstrated markedly enlarged nucleoli. Moreover, the nuclear chromatin was altered such that there was prominent, densely packed perinucleolar chromatin and a loss of non-nucleolar heterochromatin. These changes were accompanied by uniform enlargement of nuclei (i.e. nucleomegaly). These morphologic changes were seen not only in hippocampal pyramidal neurons, but also in many neuronal populations which express the TDP-43 transgene in this transgenic model including neocortical neurons, olfactory bulb granular neurons and others (Fig 5a). In contrast, regions devoid of transgene expression such as the cerebellum did not exhibit histologic evidence of chromatin abnormalities or nucleomegaly (Fig 5a). These histologic changes were seen in all bigenic mice in which transgene expression was turned on for 3 months or longer (n = 14, ranging from 3 months to 15 months of transgene expression). In contrast, nuclear changes were subtle or absent in mice with shorter lengths of transgene expression (n = 21, ranging from 0 to 2 months of transgene expression). Overall, these results corroborate the results of the transcriptomic analysis, supporting a role of cytoplasmic TDP-43 overexpression in chromatin assembly pathways as well as nucleolar structure and function.",

To verify this finding, the cross-sectional areas of neuronal nuclei with and without TDP-43 inclusions were measured from three-dimensional confocal microscopy image stacks. 133 nuclei associated with TDP-43 inclusions and 254 adjacent uninvolved nuclei were measured from 13 human cases which revealed that nuclei of neurons with cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates had a 31.4% larger cross-sectional area (75.66 \u03bcm2) relative to nuclei of adjacent uninvolved neurons (57.56 \u03bcm2) (Fig 5b).

This is further supported by the paucity of splicing changes upon expression of \u0394NLS-hTDP-43, implying that the exogenous hTDP-43 seems to be able to mostly compensate for the disruption of endogenous mTDP-43 nuclear splicing regulatory activity. It is important to note that cytoplasmic TDP-43 inclusions are very rare in these mice, suggesting that the effects observed in this model seem to be due specifically to a gain of cytoplasmic function as opposed to toxic aggregation. Furthermore, comparison of the transcriptomic results with HITS-CLIP data of TDP-43 RNA binding partners showed that six out of the eight significantly changing pathways were significantly enriched for TDP-43 binding targets (data not shown). This suggests that many of the transcriptomic effects in these mice involve the direct interactions of TDP-43 with its RNA targets, as opposed to indirect effects arising from the cytoplasmic mislocalization.",

Knockdown of stem loop binding protein, the protein that binds the stem loop of histones and facilitates proper histone transcript processing and trafficking, leads to aberrantly polyadenylated histone transcripts which are retained in the nucleus and therefore not translated [42]. However, another study suggested that polyadenylated histone transcripts can be transported to the cytoplasm, bound to polyribosomes, and translated [43]. Furthermore, as histone translation is highly dependent on cell cycle stage [39], the regulation of histone transcripts in non-dividing neurons is not well understood. We did not detect a change in the levels of histone protein H3 in bigenic mice compared to nontransgenic controls at steady state (Fig 2). Given the strong physical association between histone proteins and chromatin, a reduction in histone protein synthesis may not lead to changes in steady state histone levels but rather could lead to more subtle changes in histone turnover or flux. Another layer of complexity is that independent of any effects on translation, the degradation of these histone transcripts, which is also cell cycle dependent [39], may also be affected by aberrant polyadenylation.",

Although this model artificially induces a gain of cytoplasmic function, the results observed here provide an insight into the consequences of pathological cytoplasmic accumulation of TDP-43. The question of whether the pathological effects of TDP-43 in ALS and FTLD-TDP are caused by a nuclear loss of function or a cytoplasmic gain of function is still uncertain [44], but this study provides an improved understanding of the effects of a cytoplasmic gain of function. The mice expressing the \u0394NLS-hTDP-43 transgene suffered neurodegeneration without common cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregations [13], suggesting that the mechanisms identified in this study may play an important role in the pathological process even without the development of TDP-43 inclusions, perhaps modeling a pre-aggregated disease state.",
