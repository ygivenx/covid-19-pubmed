            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is an acute and highly contagious disease, which causes severe enteritis, vomiting, watery diarrhea, dehydration, and high mortality rates in pigs [1]. PED was first described in 1971 in United Kingdom, affecting fattening pigs [2], and the etiological agent was identified in Belgium as a new coronavirus, which was designated as PED virus (PEDV) [3]. PEDV belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae, subfamily Coronavirinae, and order Nidovirales. PEDV genome consists of 28 kb long single-stranded RNA with positive polarity and includes seven known open reading frames (ORFs). Two large ORFs, 1a and 1b, occupying two-thirds of the genome, encode two nonstructural polyproteins (pp1a and pp1b) that direct genome replication and transcription. The remaining one-third of the genome encodes four structural proteins, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N), and one hypothetical accessory protein encoded by the ORF3 gene [4]. Of all viral proteins, the PEDV S protein has a pivotal function regulating interactions with specific host-cell receptor glycoproteins to mediate viral entry [5]. Therefore, PEDV S protein has been often used to understand the genetic relationships between different PEDV strains and the epidemiological status of PEDV in the field (reviewed in [4]). Other genes including ORF3, E, M, or N have been also utilized for phylogenetic inference [6\u20139] and some studies have included PEDV full genome sequences to get better phylogenetic resolution [10, 11]. However, realistically, sequencing the full genome of PEDV is still expensive, from both computational and laboratory perspectives. Moreover, for many computationally intensive analyses, utilizing the full genome is unfeasible. It would be, therefore, beneficial to use only those genomic regions that contain the highest phylogenetic signal to reduce cost without losing valuable information [12]. In fact, phylogenetic markers together with powerful Bayesian phylogenetic approaches have been successfully applied to track the origin of important viral outbreaks [13, 14] and establish molecular epidemiology links among different viral strains including coronavirus members [15]. For PEDV it was recently shown that the S and nsp3 genes contain the lowest phylogenetic noise; therefore both are the highest recommended for phylogenetic analysis and molecular characterization studies [11].",

            "text": "In 2010, new Chinese strains of PEDV clinically more severe than the classical strains emerged [16]. These strains were spread to United States in 2013 through an intercontinental transmission from China [17] with further spreading to Canada [18], Mexico, and other countries into the American continent including Colombia and Dominican Republic (reviewed in [1]). Moreover, in Europe, the recent reports in Germany [19], France [20], and Belgium [21] of PED-outbreaks caused by strains closely related to the variants identified in China and the United States evidence the emergent nature of these strains. The epidemiological situation regarding PEDV turned more complicated since in December 2013 a second PEDV strain OH851 (later named as S-INDEL strain) emerged in the US [22]. This new PEDV strain was also reported in spring 2014 in Germany [19, 23], as a consequence of a probable single or simultaneous introduction [24] and with later reports in other European countries including France [20], Belgium [21], Italy [25], Austria [26], and Spain [27]. Even though the PEDV S-INDEL strains have shown lower virulence in the field [28] the clinical manifestations of the disease in the European countries affected have been very variable, with ranges of mortality between 0 and 70% (reviewed in [29]). This recent global reemergence of PED requires urgent attention and deeper understanding of PEDV epidemiological links driving the changes in viral pathogenicity. Therefore, this report was conducted using the complete sequence of the S gene and powerful Bayesian phylogeographic reconstructions to clarify the putative origin of PEDV in Ecuador, revealing the wide expansion of the emergent PEDV strains, which caused the first PEDV outbreak in this country.",

Nucleotide BLAST analysis (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/Blast.cgi) was initially used to verify the identity of the sequences obtained.",

            "text": "In the present study, an analysis of PEDV field sequences from Ecuador was conducted by comparison with all the PEDV S gene sequences available in the GenBank database. In addition, phylogenetic comparisons and Bayesian phylogeographic inference based on complete S gene sequences were conducted to track the origin and putative route of PEDV. The S gene of PEDV has more than 4000 nucleotides and encodes the S protein, which constitutes the spikes of the viral envelope, responsible for its high variability. The PEDV S glycoprotein is known to be an appropriate viral gene for determining the genetic relatedness among PEDV isolates [4]. The sequences obtained from the animals selected and the viral isolate PEDV/Cotopaxi/2014 were assembled, yielding a final fragment of 4414 nt of length for each one, all of them containing the 4160 nt of the complete S gene. The identity of the sequences obtained was 100% between them; therefore, to avoid redundant entries at GenBank database, the sequences were submitted as a single entry under the accession number KT336490. The genetic identity of the sequence KT336490 (thereafter mentioned as PEDV/Cotopaxi/2014) was initially inferred from BLASTn analysis sharing 99% with more than 94 isolates or strains of PEDV from US and Korea. The sequence of the PEDV USA/Colorado/2013 isolate (accession number: KF272920) was selected to compare the sequence PEDV/Cotopaxi/2014 since it showed the highest score from the BLASTn analysis. Thus, the sequence PEDV/Cotopaxi/2014 showed four nucleotide changes 1093AxG, 2454CxT, 3051CxT, and 3607CxT when both sequences were compared. Only two of these mutations led to amino acid changes when the deduced sequence was analyzed. The sequence PEDV/Cotopaxi/2014 showed the changes 360SxG and 1203LxF compared with the sequence of PEDV isolate USA/Colorado/2013. These mutations were not located at the neutralizing epitopes (SS2, SS6, or 2C10) [37]. Therefore, associations with possible adaptive advantages caused by escaping to the immune response of the host cannot be suggested. The mutation 360SxG was located into the N-terminal domain (NTD) of S1 (Figure 1). Even though this domain has not been directly linked to PEDV tropism and functionality as in transmissible gastroenteritis virus and murine hepatitis virus [38], it is recognized that it can influence virus infectivity [30]. Therefore, a mutation of serine in this domain could lead to an increase of the infectivity of the viral strains with this mutation, since serine is recognized as a catalytic residue of the trypsin (enzyme involved in the entry of the virus into the host cell in the digestive tract). Nevertheless, further virulence studies will be required to verify this role.",

            "text": "The phylogenetic relationships among the PEDV strains were reconstructed based on complete S gene by means of NJ, ML, and BI analyses. All algorithms yielded congruent results showing the same topologies, which was supported by moderate to high confidence values given by the bootstrap percentage and the posterior probability (Supplementary Material Figure S1). Even though the tree yielded by BI was the best, the statistical support for this tree was not significantly different from the NJ or ML trees (Supplementary Material Table S2). Thus, all topologies obtained showed two highly divergent genogroups (2a and 2b) (Supplementary Material Figure S1). For a better visualization of the results, a short tree obtained from 60 PEDV strains, representative of all genogroups or clades, was built by BI (Figure 2). Thus, the short tree showed the same distribution than the full tree (Supplementary Material Figure S1 and Figure 2). In Figure 2, two clades belonging to the PEDV genogroups 2a and 2b can be clearly observed. In addition, from the genogroup 2a, two main clades (I and II) previously described by Vlasova et al. [28] were also obtained (Figure 2). The sequence from the PED-outbreak in Ecuador PEDV/Cotopaxi/2014 was grouped into the clade II of PEDV genogroup 2a together with other sequences of isolates from Mexico, Canada, and United States (Figure 2). This group was highly supported by 0.93 posterior probability value (Figure 2). After the PED US outbreak, the virus rapidly spread to Canada and Mexico [4]. Whilst contaminated food by spray-dried porcine plasma positive to PEDV genome is pointed out as a possible way for introducing PEDV from US to Canada [18], the legal movement of pigs is suggested as the source of introduction to Mexico (http://www.thepigsite.com/swinenews/36693/mexico-reports-83-outbreaks-of-pedv-to-oie/). In the group of sequences in which PEDV/Cotopaxi/2014 was included, the nearest country to Ecuador is Mexico, indicating that the movement (legal or illegal) of animals between Mexico and Ecuador could be a possible source of introduction of the virus to Ecuador. However, evidence about this possible link has not been found. Phylogeographic reconstruction identified a specific location for the root of the tree with posterior probabilities for state sp = 0.81 for the locality of China (Supplementary Material Figure S2). The phylogeographic study revealed the emergence of the Chinese PEDV strains followed by spreading to US in 2013 (Figures 3(a) and 3(b), Supplementary Material Video S1). Huang et al. [17] previously observed this result describing the US PED-outbreak as an intercontinental transmission of the Chinese strains. After introducing the Chinese PEDV strains to US the virus spread from US to Korea (Figure 3(c), Supplementary Material Video S1). S. Lee and C. Lee [39] reported the circulation of new PEDV strains in South Korea that were genetically like PEDV strains that affected United States during 2013. This result suggested that the recent strains from South Korea might have been originated in the United States, caused by the importation of pig breeding stock during or after the sudden emergence of PEDV in the United States [39]. During 2010-2011, more than one-third of the total pig population in South Korea was slaughtered as control measure to foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks; thus a huge importation of breeding pigs from US was carried out without a proper implementation of a vaccination policy [39]. The phylogeographic study also revealed the introduction of the virus in Canada, Mexico, and Ecuador directly from the US (Figure 3(d) and Supplementary Material Video S1). This result frames the most probable route of entry of PEDV to Ecuador from US. The sources of imports of live swine in Ecuador in 2014 were mainly from Chile and US (http://data.trendeconomy.com/trade/Ecuador/Import?commodity=0103). Thus, this movement of pigs is suggested as the principal way for introducing PEDV to Ecuador.",
