Multiple epidemiologic studies of serotype circulation conducted between 1975\u20131983 showed that >90% of field isolates could be identified with the 90 serotype-specific antisera prepared before 1973, and many serotypes identified earlier were still circulating [6], [7], [8]. These results suggested HRV serotypes are stable and do not undergo influenza virus-like antigenic drift [7].",

This traditional serological method is insensitive, labor intensive and cumbersome [24]. More sensitive and faster molecular methods have been developed for serotyping enteroviruses, which are closely related to HRV [25]. In addition, molecular typing methods have been used to identify the links between illnesses and specific strains of pathogens such as dengue viruses, influenza viruses, human papillomaviruses, hepatitis C viruses, and HIV [26], [27]. Molecular typing involves PCR amplification of a portion of the target viral genome, sequencing and phylogenetic analyses. In this report, we analyzed clinical specimens from sick infants with a new molecular method, and identified 26 new HRV strains including 9 that constitute a new HRV group.",

The degenerate primers EV292 and EV222 for PCR amplification of NIm-1A region were not sensitive enough for direct detection of small amount of HRV in original clinical samples (data not shown), and high titer infected cell lysates of cultured isolates were needed to produce enough PCR product for cloning and sequencing. The length of NIm-1A and P1-P2 sequences ranged 329\u2013356 bases and 263\u2013271 bases, respectively. Based on phylogenetic tree reconstruction of NIm-1A sequences, the 79 clinical isolates were assigned to 24 different serotypes with highly significant bootstrap values (77\u2013100%, Table 1). Identical assignment results were obtained with P1-P2 tree, although a number of assignments (HRV1B, HRV15, HRV85 and one of the 5 HRV89) had low but still significant bootstrap values (60%, 64%, 61% and 62%, respectively). Interestingly, the nucleotide divergence between the clinical isolates and the respective reference strain was lower at the P1-P2 region (mean 3.5%, range 0\u20138%) than at the NIm-1A region (mean 9.6%, range 5\u201313%) (Table 1). This result agreed with previous reports that nucleotide sequences were more conserved at the NCRs than the coding region due to the preservation of conserved RNA structure elements within the NCR[31], [32].",

Phylogenetic tree reconstruction has been shown to be more accurate than the other sequence analysis methods for molecular typing of enteroviruses [34]. Interestingly, the 5'NCR is not suitable for typing of enterovirus. For example, the 5'NCR sequence of coxackieviruses do not correlate with serotype and VP1 sequence due to frequent recombination at the 5\u2019NCR [35], [36]. In contrast, HRV maintains consistent phylogeny across its genome and has limited recombination [31], and this characteristic enables 5'NCR sequence (P1-P2) to be used for strain identification. For enteroviruses, VP1 sequencing is commonly used for molecular serotyping because this region contains major antigenic sites that correlate well with serotype [25]. However, VP1 sequences of HRV are less conserved, and degenerate primer pairs such as EV292 and EV222 [24] that target this region were relatively insensitive for PCR amplification.",

The P1-P2 phylogenetic tree (not shown) revealed that HRV-QPM and one of our new HRVA viruses, W24, were the same strain and thus supported McErlean's conclusion that HRV-QPM was a group A virus. The VP4 tree (not shown) confirmed McErlean's finding that HRV-QPM and the 8 NY HRVs belonged to the same cluster within HRVA group.

These findings indicate that the number of HRV strains has been markedly underestimated by traditional viral culture and serotyping techniques, and also raise additional questions. First, how widespread are these putative \u201cgroup C\u201d HRV? Our study population consisted of a group of infants who experienced frequent illnesses, and additional studies are needed to define the spectrum of HRV infections in unselected populations, and in subjects of other age groups. Secondly, is the biology of these novel strains similar to that of other HRV? The inability to culture these viruses suggests that receptor utilization or other growth requirements are distinct. The development of molecular assays for the detection and analysis of respiratory viruses provide important tools for new epidemiologic and mechanistic studies to address these questions. A more complete understanding of the spectrum of respiratory viruses and their biology is essential for efforts directed at prevention and treatment of these common and clinically significant illnesses.",

The output signal is expressed as MFI (median fluorescence intensity), and samples with an average signal >6 standard deviations of average negative control signals (typically 400 to 500 MFI) are regarded as positive. The RMA is capable of distinguishing closely related HRV and enteroviruses [33].",

Careful alignment analysis of these sequences showed that only the 5'NCR region had highly conserved sequences (P1, P2 and P3 regions, Figure 1) that could be used for making pan-HRV primers, and a long variable sequence (P1-P2, Figure 1) suitable for serotype differentiation. However, 5'NCR sequences were available for only a fraction of 101 serotypes.",

Detailed viral RNA preparation, RT-PCR, cloning and sequencing procedure have been described elsewhere [33]. Briefly, total nucleic acids were prepared from 100 \u00b5l of infected cell lysate by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. RT (reverse transcription)-PCR was performed in a RT-PCR mix (Invitrogen 11922-028) using the following conditions: 30 min at 50\u00b0C, 2 min at 94\u00b0C, 33 cycles of (30 sec at 94\u00b0C, 30 sec at 50\u00b0C, 60 sec at 68\u00b0C) and 5 min at 68\u00b0C. The PCR primer pairs were forward primer P1-1 (CAAGCACTTCTGTYWCCCC) for all serotypes and a serotype-specific reverse primer. Primer P1-1 was designed within the conserved P1 region (Figure 1). The reverse primer was selected for each of the 101 serotypes within a region corresponding to bases 1000-1100 of HRV16 near the 5' end of VP2 gene (Figure 1) according to published sequences [29]. The PCR product, a DNA fragment of about 900 bp covering 75% of the 5'NCR, complete VP4 gene and about 200 bases of VP2 gene (PCR fragment A of Figure 1), was isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis. After the agarose was removed by phenol extraction, PCR fragments were treated with kinase, ligated to a StuI-linearized plamsid vector pMJ3, and then transformed into E. coli. Three plasmids with PCR fragment inserted were isolated for each serotype, amplified and purified. Each viral DNA fragment was completely sequenced (Automated DNA Sequencing Facility, U. Wisconsin). The serotype identity of each sequence was verified by matching of its VP4/VP2 sequence to the respective published sequence [29].",

Next, a new isolate or detection was assigned the serotype to which it clustered with in the phylogenetic tree with a significant bootstrap value (>50%) [34]. In contrast, if the P1-P2 sequence of a new isolate or detection did not cluster with one of the 101 serotypes in the phylogenetic tree, and had >9% pairwise nucleotide divergence from the nearest reference serotype, it was designated as a new strain (prefixed with W). The threshold pairwise divergence value (9%) for assigning a new strain was determined after considering the pairwise divergence values between the 101 known serotypes (Figure 2), and the pairwise divergence values between reference serotypes and clinical isolates of the same serotype (Table 1, last column).",
