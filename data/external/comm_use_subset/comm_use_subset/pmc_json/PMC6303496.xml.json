            "text": "Poultry production in Algeria faces many zootechnical and health constraints, such as viral infections like avian infectious bronchitis (IB). The avian IB virus (IBV), a member of the Coronaviridae family (order Nidovirales and genus Coronavirus), frequently infects broilers and egg-laying hens and leads to severe economic losses to the poultry industry [1]. Since its discovery in the 1930s [2], the IBV has been identified as the major cause of respiratory infections and poor zootechnical performances. Interestingly, it can also multiply in the renal tissue and cause nephritis [3], a phenomenon first described in the United States [4]. More recently, IBV-associated nephritis has been accepted as the most pressing problem in broiler flocks in many countries [5-9].",

However, nephritis associated with infectious bronchitis has been observed in several vaccinated flocks, suggesting that the current vaccination strategies against IBV may not provide adequate protection [3,10]. In fact, outbreaks of IB are frequently caused due to the strains serologically different from those used for vaccination [11,12]. Since its discovery in 1931, a large number of serotypes or variants of IBV have emerged [5,13,14], and little or no cross-protection occurs between these serotypes [15]. Therefore, it is crucial to track epidemic-causing serotypes in each geographic region or country and produce new vaccines to control IB.",

All samples showed 93% homology to the partial-S1 sequence acquired from the IB 4/91 reference strain (Figure-1). The IBDZ13a strain was characterized as an IB 4/91 variant IBV with 29 nucleic acid substitutions differing from the known IB 4/91 vaccine reference strain sequence, which corresponded to eight amino acid substitutions relative to this reference strain (Table-3). Three of these amino acid substitutions were from a hydrophobic to a hydrophilic amino acid. A change in hydrophilicity altered the epitopes on the S1 protein of the IB DZ13a virus. The predicted epitopes with differences between the field virus and IB 4/91 vaccine strain are shown in Figure-1.",

The HI test and virus neutralization test (VNT) are the most commonly used tests for detecting IBV antibodies [9,23]. Studies show extensive cross-reactions between the IBV serotypes detected by the HI test and similar antigenicity detected by the VNT and HI test [24-26].

After reporting the nephropathogenic form of IB [3], the above serotypes have been reported in China, Europe, and Africa and have been seen to be associated with severe kidney damage, high morbidity, and mortality in the vaccinated flocks. At present, these serotypes are the predominant field strains in most poultry farms worldwide [13,28]. The serological analysis showed significantly lower titers of IB 4/91 compared to IB-QX, which could be related to the vaccination of some flocks with the IB 4/91 strain. De Wit [23] reported that many factors influence the level of IBV antibodies, of which the most critical is the presence of immunity at the time of infection. This is consistent with the lower anti-IB 4/91 antibody titers seen in the vaccinated flocks compared to the unvaccinated ones. Another factor that can reduce the sensitivity of HI and thus affect the interpretation of the results is the cross-reaction between the different serotypes, especially when multiple serotypes of IBV are involved. We detected cross-reaction between the QX and 4/91 serotypes in many flocks, and 4 flocks showed mixed infection of three serotypes (QX, 4/91, and M41). Therefore, the serotype specificity of HI is reduced after reinfection or vaccination, especially when the subsequent serotype is heterologous [23].",

The S1 gene of the IBDZ13a field strain was most closely related to that of the IB 4/91-type strain (Figure-2) as determined by the criterion of Worthington et al. [13] and Kannan et al. [30], who classified IBV sequences with <99% homology to vaccine strains as variants. Our findings indicate the circulation of virulent strains of IB 4/91, which have become the predominant genotype in Africa, Asia, and Europe [28]. However, we did not see a strong correlation between the HI results which showed the circulation of the QX and 4/91 serotypes and RT-PCR which showed the emergence of a new genotype of the 4/91 strain. This is consistent with the findings of Kusters et al. [31] who also reported that RT-PCR and HI results were not exactly correlated, wherein different serotypes showed considerable differences (20-50%) in the amino acid sequences of the S1 subunit. HI is used for routine testing of sera from young growing chickens to determine the serotype-specific antibody status of a flock [32]. However, the presence of multiple cross-reactive antibodies against antigenically unrelated strains, as is often seen during IB outbreaks, reduces the serodiagnostic value of HI. Therefore, a combination of serotyping and genotyping is recommended to identify field strains. Based on the results of HI and RT-PCR, we conclude that the IBDZ13a variant of IB4/91 is involved in kidney damage of broiler flocks.",

However, vaccinated flocks in many regions of Algeria have shown considerable mortality and production losses in recent years. The isolation of a new IBV strain from the vaccinated and unvaccinated flocks can be explained by two hypotheses. The first hypothesis, based on the mutations and amino acid alterations in the S1 epitope, is that the IBV strain evolved to escape the host immune response elicited by the current vaccines [34]. However, this hypothesis is weak since amino acid alterations do not always translate into differences in antigenicity or biological function. Furthermore, the sequence data only provide information regarding the primary structure of the protein and not the secondary and tertiary structures which are vital for its biological function and antigenicity [23]. The second hypothesis is the failure to adopt the vaccination programs to the IBV field strains circulating in the farms. In our study, only two flocks received the combined vaccine of IB Ma5 (at day 7) and IB 4/91 (at day 14). The failure to protect broilers against nephritis could also be related to the shorter inter-vaccination interval of 7 days. Terregino et al. [35] demonstrated improved protection against several IB serotypes by vaccinating with two antigenically different IB vaccines given at the interval of 14 days. This approach obviates the need to develop a new IB vaccine for each new emerging serotype. One flock was vaccinated with the Mass vaccine type H120 strain, which, however, did not provide sufficient protection against IBV infection [33,36].",
