As the etiologic agents, DENs can cause severe flu-like illness called dengue fever (DF), and sometimes lethal complication called dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) [1,2]. They transmit diseases to human beings primarily through mosquitoes, mainly Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. With dramatically growth in recent decades, DF affects 100 million people and results in about 25,000 deaths annually, mostly in tropical and sub-tropical regions. DHF has become a leading cause of serious illness and death among children in some Asian countries [3]. Unfortunately, effective vaccines or therapies against the infection are still not available [4].",

Upon introduction into the cells, exogenous dsRNAs are cut into 21-25 nt small interfering RNA (siRNA) by an RNase III-like enzyme called Dicer. The siRNAs form RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) with other cellular components, and lead to the cleavage of their homologous transcript and eventually the silencing of specific gene [9-11]. RNAi is believed to be an effective endogenous mechanism for host cells to defense against virus attack [12], and has been applied as an exogenous measure to inhibit viral replication, such as HIV [13,14], influenza A virus [15], HBV [16] and SARS-CoV [17].",

Like other flaviviruses, DEN generates intracellular dsRNA as an intermediate of their replication, which may induce RNAi in the host cells. A new explanation for mosquitoes' non-pathogenic and persistent infections of DEN is that RNAi could be an important modulator [19]. Exogenous long length dsRNA corresponding to DEN sequences, introduced by either plasmid or Sindbis viruses, has been proven to mediate RNAi in mosquito C6/36 Cells and lead to inhibition of DEN replication in cultured mosquito cells [20,21]. Genetically modified Aedes aegypti has been raised to develop dengue virus resistance [22-24]. The mixtures of DEN specific small interfering RNAs, the hallmark of RNAi, were detected in all aforementioned studies. But little was known about the role of single siRNA with particular target sequence in the inhibition of DEN replication. Our present study was designed to investigate if a single siRNA has the inhibitory effect on DEN-1 replication in mosquito cells.",

This likely happened at the moment between the uncoating of viral RNA and the viral replication [25]. Virus resistance has been proven to be generated by RNAi triggered from exogenous DEN-specific dsRNA. Adelman et al. [20] showed this resistance by a 290 nt dsRNA homologous to the type II dengue virus PrM gene which was expressed by plasmid, in cultured mosquito C6/36 cells. Travanty et al. [23] developed transgenic mosquito lines that transcribed the same 290 nt dsRNA with insect promoters, but failed to express in critical site for DEN replication such as midguts. Franz et al. [24] increased the size of dsRNA to 578 nt and succeeded in midgut expression and viral transmission diminishing. In addition to DEN-2, alternation of the replication kinetics of DEN-1 has also proven to be triggered by dsRNA in C6/36 cells [26].",
