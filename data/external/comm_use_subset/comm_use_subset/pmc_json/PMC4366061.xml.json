Two serotypes of BRAV have been identified, BRAV1 and BRAV2, while BRBV consists of a single serotype. The BRAV1 strain SD-1 was isolated in Germany in 1962 from nasal secretions from a calf with rhinitis [2]. Additional BRAV1 strains were subsequently isolated from both healthy and diseased bovines in England, Japan, Italy and the U.S. and shown to cross react in serum neutralization assays [3\u20136]. The sole BRBV isolate EC-11 was isolated in England in 1964 by Reed from the lung of a specific pathogen free calf with respiratory disease [7]. Likewise, BRAV2 consists of a single specimen, strain H-1, isolated from an outbreak of respiratory disease in cattle in 1984 [8]. Despite numerous studies on bovine rhinitis viruses (BRV) in the 1960\u2019s through mid-1980\u2019s, little work has been published on their epidemiology and ecology the past several decades.",

BRDC has a multifactorial etiology involving a variety of bacteria and viruses in addition to host and environmental factors [10]. Numerous commercial vaccines including both killed and attenuated live bacteria are available. Viruses commonly included in commercial vaccine include bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine herpes virus 1 (BHV1), parainfluenza virus 3 (PI3) and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV). Despite their widespread use, BRDC incidence has increased over the past 20 years [11,12]. BRDC pathogenesis often involves a primary viral infection which damages respiratory mucosa and alters host immune responses leading to secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by commensal bacteria already present in the respiratory tract [13].",

Experimental inoculation of calves with BRAV1 via intranasal (IN) or intratracheal (IT) routes, either singly or in combination, resulted in variable clinical signs of respiratory disease and histologic lesions consistent with pneumonia [14]. BRAV1 was also recovered from nasal swabs of IN inoculated animals and all animals inoculated or exposed by contact seroconverted to BRAV1 by day seven post inoculation. A similar experiment using a different BRAV1 strain (RS 3x) and colostrum deprived calves failed to reproduce clinical disease but was successful in isolating BRAV1 from nasal swabs post inoculation and found histological lesions of focal rhinitis and a neutralizing antibody response in all inoculated calves [15]. BRBV pathogenesis was investigated using intranasal inoculation of gnotobiotic calves [16]. Clinical signs including fever, nasal discharge and increased respiration rate were observed. Foci of epithelial necrosis were observed histologically in the turbinates and trachea and interstitial pneumonia was evident in the lungs. Virus was isolated from multiple tissues and was neutralized by convalescent antiserum. In addition to controlled studies, numerous investigations of acute respiratory disease in cattle resulted in the isolation of bovine rhinitis viruses where paired acute and convalescent sera suggested a causative role for bovine rhinitis virus [6,8,17,18].",

Samples were collected in years 2011\u20132014 from twelve states: Nebraska (n = 48), Kansas (n = 112), Colorado (n = 6), Missouri (n = 1), Mississippi (n = 7), Texas (n = 4), Oklahoma (n = 2), Idaho (n = 2), Montana (n = 6), Oregon (n = 4), Washington (n = 11) and Virginia (n = 1). Samples were also screened for influenza D virus (IDV) using quantitative real time reverse transcription PCR as previously described [20]. A 5\u2019-nuclease reverse transcription PCR assay was designed to detect bovine rhinitis viruses targeting the 3D polymerase gene: probe, 5\u2019-FAM-CGG CAG TCC AGG TCC AGT GT-Iowa Black-3\u2019; Forward: 5\u2019-CTT TTC GGT GTG ATT GGC AG-3\u2019; Reverse: 5\u2019-GAA ATC TAT CAG GGC AGG TCT G-3\u2019. Viral RNA was extracted using the MagMAX-96 viral RNA isolation kit (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Real time reverse transcription PCR was performed using Qiagen Quantitect RT-PCR with BRV primers and probe as follows: 50\u00b0C, 30 minutes; 95\u00b0C, 15 minutes; followed by 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 seconds and 60\u00b0C for 60 seconds. The PCR assay specificity was confirmed using bovine rhinitis virus positive samples as determined by metagenomic sequencing as well as with cultures of common BRDC pathogens BVDV, BHV-1, BRSV, BCV, Mannheimia haemolytica, Histophilus somni, Pasteurella multocida and Mycoplasma bovis.",

Antiserum from a gnotobiotic calf hyperimmunized with BCV was used as a negative control (National Veterinary Services Laboratories catalog #320-BDV). Sera from two high health cows housed in isolation at the Kansas State University Veterinary Health Center were also used as negative controls. Non-infected cells were also stained to determine level of background fluorescence. MDBK cells were infected with BRBV at a dilution of 1:15 and incubated overnight. Once the onset of cytopathic effect (CPE) was evident in approximately 20% of the cells, plates were washed with PBS and fixed in 80% aqueous acetone. Serum was added at a 1:10 dilution and seven serial two-fold dilutions were made in PBS, with a final serum dilution of 640. Plates were incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C, then washed three times with PBS. FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-bovine IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch) was added at a dilution to 1:50, along with Evan\u2019s Blue at 1:500, and incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C.

Aerobic culture identified Mannheimia haemolytica. A bovine respiratory disease PCR panel was also performed and was positive for Mycoplasma bovis [cycle threshold (Ct) = 27.8] and bovine coronavirus (BCV, Ct = 20.0). Metagenomic sequencing was next performed on the sample to investigate BCV genetic diversity for an unrelated project. The nasal swab sample was filtered through a 0.2 micron syringe filter and treated with a cocktail of nucleases before nucleic acid isolation. Reverse transcription, second strand synthesis and amplification were performed using sequence independent single primer amplification (SISPA) and sequencing libraries were prepared from the resulting amplicons [22]. Approximately 4 million reads were generated on an Illumina MiSeq instrument. Reads mapping to host DNA were subtracted (\u223c3.6M reads) and the remaining sequences (\u223c430k reads) were assembled de novo into 192 contigs and classified based on best BLASTN expectation (E) scores. Besides the expected BCV, contigs with similarity to bovine adenovirus 4 (BAdV4), BRAV2 and BRBV were identified with E values of 0. Templated assembly was next performed using reference genomes identified by BLAST analysis. A near complete BCV genome was assembled from 15,500 reads to yield a consensus sequence of 31,017 nucleotides (nt) (missing the 5\u2019-terminal 4 nt) with 99% identity to strain E-AH65 [24]. Significantly fewer reads mapped to BAdV4 (238 reads) which resulted in \u223c25% genome coverage with 91% identity to strain THT/62 [25]. Assembly using a BRAV2 reference genome mapped 5,924 reads which spanned the 5\u2019-non coding region and the complete polyprotein open reading frame with the exception of a 16 nt gap approximately 150 nt from the 3\u2019-end of the polyprotein. The determined BRAV2 sequence was 89% identical to the BRAV2 strain H-1. Similarly, assembly using the BRBV reference genome identified 2,505 reads which spanned the entire reference sequence with the exception of 48 and 13 nt at the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019-termini. The consensus sequence was 87% identical to BRBV strain EC11 [1]. As only a single genome each of BRAV2 and BRBV have been published and neither of the viruses have previously been identified in U.S. cattle, further investigation was warranted.",

            "text": "Similar to all picornaviruses, the genome of BRAV1 consists of a long 5\u2019 non-translated region (NTR), a single large ORF encoding a polyprotein and a short 3\u2019-NTR followed by a poly-A tail. The region of the 5\u2019 NTR sequenced encompasses 537 nt and is 89% identical to BRAV2 H-1. The 5\u2019 NTR contained three insertions (G334, C350, C527) and one deletion (A345) as compared to BRAV2 H1. The Aphthovirus 5\u2019NTR contains a type II internal ribosome entry site [26\u201328]. The polyprotein initiation codon is typically preceded by a polypyrimidine tract by approximately 20 nt\u2019s. A polypyrimidine tract is present in BRAV1 from nt 514\u2013522 (UUUUCCUUU) followed by an AUG initiation codon at nt 538\u2013540. A second initiation codon is present closely downstream and in the same reading frame at nt 553\u2013555. Aphthoviruses typically express two different forms of the leader polypeptide (Lab and Lb) from alternate initiation codons [29\u201330]. FMDV favors translation from the second initiation codon while ERAV favors the first AUG. AUG codons favored for translation are located in the context of Kozak sequences [31]. For BRAV1, the second AUG from nt 553\u2013555 is in the context of a strong Kozak sequence and expression of a 2,213 amino acid polyprotein is expected to be dominant. The complete ORF of BRAV1 Sd1 encodes a predicted 2,218 amino acid polypeptide with 93% identity to BRAV2 and 50% identity to BRBV (Table 1). The polyprotein is processed by viral proteases into L, four structural (VP4, VP2, VP3, VP1) and seven non-structural (2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3C, 3D) proteins. The non-structural proteins of BRAV1 were very similar to those of BRAV2 with over 90% identity. The most divergent proteins were the capsid proteins VP1, VP2 and VP3 with 84.9\u201387.5% identity. VP1, VP2 and VP3 are the only surface-exposed viral proteins and consequently are antigenic determinants [32,33]. As BRAV1 and BRAV2 are serologically distinct, the sequence divergence observed between VP1, VP2 and VP3 represents serotypic differences [8].",

A large ORF was identified from nt 488\u20137,219 encoding a predicted 2,243 amino acid polypeptide with 97% identity to BRAV2 H-1 that was preceded by a polypyrimidine tract of CCCCUCUUU at nt 468\u2013476. The L protein of BRAV2 strain 140032\u20131 was unusual such that it had four initiation codons in frame with the polypeptide within the first 100 bp of the ORF (nt\u2019s 488\u2013490, 539\u2013541, 554\u2013556 and 578\u2013580).

The Lab proteins of BRAV1 and BRAV2 strain H-1 consist of 179 amino acids while the full length L protein of 140032\u20131 is more similar in length to that of BRBV (207 amino acids). The L protein autocatalytically cleaves the polyprotein at the L/P1 junction and also catalyzes the cleavage of the p220 subunit of the cap binding complex eIF4G resulting in inhibition of cellular cap-dependent translation initiation [34]. Further studies are required to determine if translation initiation of 140032\u20131 occurs at all four codons and if these proteins have similar biological properties.

An E value of \u22641x10\u20135 is generally considered significant for organism identification by metagenomic sequencing [36]. One sample, 6\u201317, had four contigs with best blast hits only to BRAV1 (Table 4, E values 8.9x10\u201378\u20136.1x10\u2013146). Four samples, 5\u201352, 6\u201319, 20\u201376 and 21\u201322, showed evidence of co-infection with two different BRV (BRAV1 and BRAV2, BRAV1 and BRBV, BRAV2 and BRBV). Sample 4\u201326 had multiple individual contigs with high similarity to all three species/serotypes. Resequencing of 140032 found contigs mapping to BRAV2 and BRBV similar to the initial analysis. Likewise, reanalysis of the raw data obtained for the reference BRAV1 Sd-1 found contigs with BLASTN hits solely to BRAV1. Similar analysis of metagenomic sequences from a BRV PCR-negative nasal swab submitted for BRD diagnostic testing failed to identify any contigs with E values >10\u20135 to BRV. Together, these results suggest that co-infections with multiple species and/or serotypes of BRV are common in cattle. Similar observations were made during the discovery of BRBV, where analysis of viral isolates from cattle with acute respiratory disease found 32 out of 38 isolated viruses were BRAV1 using serum neutralization tests [8]. The remaining six isolates were not neutralized by BRAV1 or BRBV antiserum and were subsequently shown to represent a new serotype, BRAV2.",

Bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (BPI3) was identified in sample 6\u201317 (E = 0.0). BLASTN analysis of 21\u201322 identified BCV (E = 0.0) and BRSV (E = 8.5x10\u201355). Analysis of 140032 identified bovine adenovirus 4 (BAdV4, E = 0.0) and BCV (E = 0.0). Viruses identified by metagenomic sequencing were in good agreement for those included in the BRDC RT-PCR panel where Ct values were less than 30: for 21\u201322, both metagenomic sequencing and RT-PCR identified BCV and BRSV; for 140032, both assays detected BCV. The inability for metagenomic sequencing to detect viruses with Ct values greater than 30 is likely due to insufficient sensitivity.",

Sera represented 15 herds in six states. All samples were positive with a titer of 160-\u2265640. Where age of animal was known (n = 44), the minimum age was 9 months (n = 4) and the majority of animals were adults >2 years of age. Controls including gnotobiotic calf antiserum, sera from high health animals held in isolation and uninfected cells were negative. Attempts to perform IFA using BRAV1 and primary embryonic bovine kidney cells were unsuccessful due to non-specific fluorescence. IFA was not performed with BRAV2 as we were unable to acquire the virus. These results suggest that BRBV infections are common in cattle however additional serological testing is needed to confirm these results. In particular, while BRAV and BRBV are serologically distinct from one another in serum neutralization assays, cross reactivity between BRAV and BRBV in our IFA assay was not performed [7]. Similar detection rates and seroprevalence were recently reported for the newly described bovine IDV [37]. IDV was found in 4.8% of BRD diagnostic submissions and serosurveys found 87.5% of herds and individuals had hemagglutination inhibition assay titers greater than 40. Previous serological studies also found evidence for widespread BRV infections [4,7,17,38,39].",

This is likely in part due to difficulty in isolating these viruses in cell culture. Nearly all reports of BRV isolation utilized primary cells and the titers obtained in vitro were relatively low. Also, controlled animal inoculation with BRV resulted in mild respiratory disease and histopathology. Combined, these results likely contribute to the lack of research on these viruses. Advances in sequencing technology now allow researchers to readily characterize metagenomic samples in a sequence-independent manner, enabling detection and characterization of both established and novel or neglected organisms.",
