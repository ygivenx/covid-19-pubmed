            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a group of enveloped viruses with a large positive single-stranded RNA genome (\u223c26\u201332 kb in length) of the subfamily Coronavirinae under the family Coronaviridae. The complete genome of CoV contains five major open reading frames (ORFs) that encode replicase polyproteins (ORF1ab), spike glycoprotein (S), envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M), and nucleocapsid protein (N) flanked by a 5\u2032- untranslated region (UTR) and a 3\u2032- UTR. Currently, members of the subfamily Coronavirinae are classified into four genera, Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus (Fehr and Perlman, 2015; Su et al., 2016). CoVs can cause upper and lower respiratory diseases, gastroenteritis, and central nervous system infections in a wide variety of avian and mammalian hosts. Some CoVs are human pathogens that cause mild to severe disease, including NL63 and 229E of the genus Alphacoronavirus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), OC43, and HKU1 of the genus Betacoronavirus (Dijkman and van der Hoek, 2009; Desforges et al., 2014; van den Brand et al., 2015; Lim et al., 2016). The SARS pandemic originated in Guangdong Province in China between 2002 and 2003, and spread to 29 countries, resulting in nearly 8,000 cases and 800 deaths worldwide (Donnelly et al., 2004). Since being discovered in Middle Eastern countries in 2012, MERS-CoV has infected 2,260 people with a current fatality rate of 35.5% (Mackay and Arden, 2015; van den Brand et al., 2015; de Wit et al., 2016).",

            "text": "With the discovery of diverse wildlife-borne CoVs indifferent regions of the world, previous studies have indicated that bats are the main and original natural reservoirs of Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus (Calisher et al., 2006; Woo et al., 2012). The special metabolic and immune systems allow bats to tolerate diverse viruses, and the social roosting behavior of many bat species lets them serve as ideal incubators for the occurrence of frequent co-infection, recombination, and intra-species transmission of CoVs (Zhang et al., 2013; O\u2019Shea et al., 2014; Hu et al., 2015; Lu et al., 2015; Sola et al., 2015). Although 15 years have passed without a recurrence of the SARS outbreak, the consistent discovery of SARS-related CoVs (SARSr-CoVs) in Rhinolophus bats indicates an ongoing risk of SARS re-emergence (Li et al., 2005; Balboni et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2016b; Hu et al., 2017). Recently, a CoV of Rhinolophus bat origin, swine acute diarrhea syndrome CoV (SADS-CoV), was found to be responsible for the death of 24,693 piglets across four farms in Guangdong Province (Zhou et al., 2018). Besides similar clinical signs, the outbreak of SADS coincided with infection by another swine enteric CoV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV; Zhou et al., 2018). It is worth mentioning that a PEDV-related bat CoV, BtCoV/512, was previously identified in Scotophilus kuhlii bats (Tang et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2016; Gerdts and Zakhartchouk, 2017; Zhou et al., 2018). All of these findings emphasize the importance of continuous monitoring for ecological diversity of CoVs in bats to minimize the impact of potential CoV-related diseases on public health and economic growth.",

Since the supply of wildlife for consumption in Guangdong mainly comes from Yunnan and Guangxi Provinces (Wu et al., 2016b), understanding the presence and dynamic changes in SARS- or SADS- related bat CoVs within and between these provinces is important for predicting and tracing CoV-related diseases. Sichuan is next to Yunnan Province, and has high ecological diversity of animal resources, and it is the largest pig-farming province in China. Although PEDV-related pig diseases were reported previously (Cai et al., 2016), no systematic survey of bat-borne CoVs has been conducted in Sichuan to establish if there are SARS- or SADS- related CoVs.",

The viral DNA and RNA were simultaneously isolated using a QIAmp MinElute Virus Spin Kit (Qiagen, United States). First-strand viral cDNA was synthesized using the primer K-8N and a Superscript III system (Invitrogen, United States). The cDNA was converted into dsDNA by Klenow fragment (NEB, United States). Sequence-independent PCR amplification was conducted using primer K. The PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. All DNA smears larger than 500 bp were extracted by a MinElute Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). The extracted nucleic acid libraries were then analyzed using an Illumina HiSeq2500 sequencer, for a single read of 100 bp. The sequence reads were filtered using previously described criteria (Wu et al., 2012, 2016a, 2018). Reads with no call sites, reads with similarity to the sequencing adaptor and the primer K sequence, duplicate reads, and low-complexity reads were removed.",

All of these beta-CoVs had high sequence identity with SARSr-CoVs. These five SARSr-CoVs showed 92\u201397% nt identity with human SARS-CoV SZ3. The genome sequence similarity among the five SARSr-CoVs and SARS-CoV SZ3 strain was examined by Simplot analysis (Figure 3C). These five SARSr-CoVs were highly conserved and shared a uniformly high sequence similarity to SARS-CoV with 94.2\u2013100% aa identity in ORF1a, ORF1b, E, M, and N (Supplementary Table 4). There were some differences between the SARSr-CoVs and SARS-CoV SZ3 in the coding regions of ORF3a, ORF3b, ORF7a, and ORF7b. After further analysis, the SARS-CoV SZ3 showed the highest sequence similarity to \u03b2-YN2018B with 92\u201396% aa identity in S, ORF3a, and ORF3b; and to \u03b2-YN2018A with 93.2\u201395.9% aa identity in ORF7a and ORF7b. In contrast, considerable genetic diversity was shown in the S (72.9\u201392.4% aa identity) and ORF8 (32.6\u201334.1% aa identity) among the five SARSr-CoVs and SARS-CoV SZ3 strain.",

In our previous study, a large-scale virome analysis was conducted between 2010 and 2013 to understand the ecological diversity of bat viruses and the bat origin of emerging infectious diseases. Rhinolophus bats in Yunnan and Guangxi Provinces have provided genetic clues to the origin of SARS-CoV, and a SADS-CoV- and HKU2-related CoV, BtRf-alphaCoV/YN2012, has also been found in Yunnan Province (Wu et al., 2016a).

            "text": "When we collected S. kuhlii in Guangxi Province, we found that there were many C. sphinx at the sampling site. The Pteropodidae bats (C. sphinx bat belongs to Pteropodidae) are natural hosts of several emergent human pathogens such as Hendra virus, Nipah virus, and Ebola virus (Leroy et al., 2005; Halpin et al., 2011; Sendow et al., 2013; Mari Saez et al., 2015; Paez et al., 2017). An Ebola-related filovirus was found in the Chinese Pteropodidae bats recently (Yang et al., 2019), and thus, we collected samples of C. sphinx for virome analysis. The C. sphinx beta-CoV, \u03b2-GX2018, represents an evolved independent lineage different from HKU9 of Rousettus and GCCDC1 of Eonycteris under lineage D. Based on the partially sequenced region, CoV strain Philippines/Diliman1525G2/2008 previously identified in C. brachyotis from the Philippines, could also be clustered into this separate \u03b2-GX2018 clade. By providing full-length sequence data, this finding reveals a new host range of this virus in an unreported location.",
