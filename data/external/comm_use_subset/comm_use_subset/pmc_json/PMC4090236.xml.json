We found that computerized free-text analyses aimed at uncovering ARI symptoms documented in outpatient clinical notes could complement diagnostic codes and other structured data to improve case detection. In this report, we asked if those EMR-enabled gains in case-detection could accelerate the discovery of ARI outbreaks. Using software to reconstitute a surveillance system operating prospectively on historical data sets, we compared alternative case-detection approaches for their ability to reduce the delay in detecting a modeled community outbreak of influenza. Our approach and results begin to chart how EMR-based information could be systematically organized to better serve public health surveillance.",

The model included 30 contiguous ZIP codes centered on Baltimore, Maryland, and consisted of a coupled series of differential equations to describe the overall epidemic [21]. The susceptible population has the size and age structure described for Baltimore in the 2000 Census [22]. Age-specific death rates for each of the 20 demographic age-classes (age-class 1 = 0\u20134 years, age-class 2 = 5\u20139 years and so on) were derived from the United States Life Table Functions for the 1994 calendar year [23]. The birth rate for each age-class was obtained from Guyer et al. [24]. Model parameters were adjusted to mimic the estimated transmission and severity characteristics of the 1918 pandemic influenza in a non-immune population [25]. The proportion of cases that would be present for medical evaluation at the VA Maryland Health Care system was adjusted to reflect the age, gender, and population estimates of Baltimore veterans, over half of whom are older than 60 years old and more than 90% are male [26]. The same model-generated outbreak that was used as a common signal for all of our surveillance simulations is shown in Fig. 1 (upper panel, blue circles). Assuming that the synthetic epidemic cases would be discovered at the same rate as authentic cases, simulated cases from the epidemic model were first discounted by the sensitivity of the ARI CDA before being injected into CDA-specific background time series.",

Starting on the day when the synthetic epidemic was injected into a CDA-specific authentic background time series, and then daily for a total of 80 days, a statistical outbreak detection method (see below) was applied in parallel to corresponding time series that included either: a) both background and epidemic cases (\u201cCombined\u201d dataset; Fig. 1, red circles, upper panel for the case counts, lower panel for the corresponding W2c statistic); or b) background-only cases (\u201cBackground\u201d dataset; Fig. 1, black diamonds, upper panel for the case counts, lower panel for the corresponding W2c statistic). A true positive alarm was issued if the value of the computed statistic exceeded a set threshold in the Combined but not in the Background dataset (Fig. 1, lower panel, instances where red circles are above threshold whereas black diamonds remain below threshold). The 80-day cycle length was chosen because it ensured at least one true-positive alarm with each surveillance cycle. This prospective surveillance cycle was then repeated 51 times, each time shifting the outbreak injection to a different week of the one-year evaluation period (from 1/8/2002 to 31/7/2003, a year with average seasonal ARI activity).",

In keeping with our goal to create a realistic evaluation platform, we also used an epidemic model to simulate the cases expected to present to our particular health system during an outbreak of severe influenza.

Our data bolster the argument for providers to assign ICD-9 codes to summarize outpatient encounters, as it is done in VA medical centers, so that this coded information can quickly be made available for surveillance purposes. Our results further argue that diagnostic codes sets used for case-detection should routinely optimized during surveillance system development or expansion. In contrast, prescriptions for cough suppressants, the only structured EMR data found to contribute to ARI case detection aside from ICD-9 codes [19], did not benefit outbreak detection. While these data suggest how to streamline CDAs for this particular use-case, structured EMR data other than diagnostic codes may very well prove useful in discovering diseases that typically cause abnormal vital signs or prompt predictable diagnostic or therapeutic interventions.",

To date however, little is known about how information extracted from free text EMR fields should be combined with structured data to accelerate outbreak detection. We had previously found that text analyses aimed at abstracting ARI symptoms typed in clinical notes [49] could improve the performance of ARI CDAs [19]. Our simulations suggest that when these text analyses were combined with structured data so as to improve case-detection accuracy, timelier outbreak discovery ensued. In contrast, when text analyses were directed toward maximizing the area under the ROC for single-case detection, outbreak detection performance deteriorated despite near-perfect case-detection sensitivity. These results seem counter-intuitive until we consider that outbreak detection depends upon a statistical rendering of the size of the epidemic signal relative to that of a baseline. With sensitivities in the 69\u201375% range, the high-specificity CDAs did not recognize the largest possible number of epidemic cases. Yet, with PPVs in the 50% range, they disproportionately reduced the number of false-positive background cases and improved the system's signal-to-noise ratio. Our results therefore suggest that CDA performance measures that attribute equal weight to sensitivity and specificity, such as the area under the ROC curve, may not anticipate how well a CDA will discover epidemics. Because of the complex interplay between epidemic signals, background noises and statistical processes, promising CDAs should be evaluated in a whole-system context before they are incorporated into an operational surveillance system.",

Text analyses would indeed be expected to complement structured data differently for diseases that are not defined through symptoms only. Optimal EMR data integration may also depend on the characteristics of the epidemic, as well as on the nature and utilization of the EMR in other health care cultures. Our assumption that epidemic cases would be discovered at the same rate as authentic cases may also not hold in reality, as real epidemic cases may have a peculiar disease presentation or severity, and vigilant providers may change their coding or documentation behavior. Our results may also not represent the final word on ARI outbreak detection in our own health system, as we did not formally optimize individual system components, such as ICD-9 groupings, text analyses or statistical approaches, and have not validated our simulation findings in other medical centers.",

The platform can also be extended to help improve detection of any disease or event cluster, and may thus allow automated surveillance systems to more vigorously participate in the promotion of safe and effective healthcare practices.",

True positive alarms occur when the value of the W2c statistic exceeds a threshold in the combined dataset while remaining sub threshold in the background dataset.
