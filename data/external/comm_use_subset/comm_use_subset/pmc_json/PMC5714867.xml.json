The most studied subclass, M2a, is induced with interleukin IL-4 or IL-13 (9, 10). M2a or M(IL-4) M\u03a6 upregulate Arginase-1 expression (11), and express high levels of mannose receptor (CD206) and chitinase-3-like protein 3 (Chi3l3) (6, 18). As such, M(IL-4) M\u03a6 are widely considered regulatory and reparative cells (19). However, unchecked expansion of M2 M\u03a6 can cause severe pathologies (19). For example, during chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, circulating and liver monocytes convert to an M2-like state resulting in fibrosis development (20). It is therefore important to study M\u03a6 polarization during virus infection as a strategy to unlock M\u03a6 targeting therapeutics to limit virus-associated damage (17).",

Activated CD8+ T cells proliferate, gradually acquire cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) effector function and home to the site of infection to secrete IFN-\u03b3 and lyse virally infected upon recognition of viral epitopes on MHC-I (27). It is known that M(IL-4) peritoneal M\u03a6 and BM-M\u03a6 inhibit OT-II proliferation in a signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-6-dependent fashion (28). Moreover, in a murine norovirus infection model, helminth-induced M2 cells inhibit CD8+ T-cell proliferation (29). Yet, how polarized M\u03a6 engage CD8+ T cells to control proliferation and functions during RNA virus infection remains unexplored. Here, we report on a novel finding supporting a dichotomized regulatory role of M(IL-4) tissue M\u03a6 where they can inhibit CD8+ T-cell proliferation without affecting their IFN-\u03b3 production after peptide-specific antigen presentation.",

Nevertheless, LCMV has evolved mechanisms to interrupt APC activation and costimulatory molecule expression (32). Therefore, in order to assess the ability of polarized Sp-M\u03a6 to engage CD8+ T-cell receptors, we characterized surface expression of activated Sp-M\u03a6 markers following 24 h of LCMV infection (Figure 1B). With regard to CD80 expression, M0 and M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) cells increased surface levels following viral infection, while M(IL-4) cells expression of CD80 remained largely unchanged (column 1). Interestingly, M0 cells slightly decreased CD86 expression following LCMV infection compared with M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) and M(IL-4) cells where no change was detected (column 2). M0 cells exhibited slight MHC-I reduction but not M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) or M(IL-4) Sp-M\u03a6 (column 3). In addition, we also assessed expression of the inhibitory molecule PD-L1 (column 4). We observed that M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) cells expressed the greatest levels of PD-L1, while M0 and M(IL-4) had similar expression levels, which confirmed data in BM-M\u03a6 published by another group (33). LCMV infection increased expression of PD-L1 in M0 and M(IL-4), while reduced expression in M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) Sp-M\u03a6. These data demonstrate that polarized cells are not negatively affected by LCMV infection when considering CD80/86 or MHC-I expression, while LCMV increases inhibitory molecule PD-L1 expression in M2 and M0 cells, but not M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3).",

In this system, SIINFEKL-Kb-specific TCR ligation results in binding to the IL-2 promotor and expression of downstream Lac-Z that can be detected by colorimetric changes (38). Using two different concentrations of the SIINFEKL peptide (10\u22127 and 10\u22129 M), we observed that M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) M\u03a6 populations elicited B3Z activation better than M0 and M(IL-4) (Figure 2C).

These publications utilized culture systems with M(IL-4) BM-M\u03a6 and na\u00efve P14 CD8+ T cells (specific for GP33-41) or anti-TCR and anti-CD28 antibodies to artificially stimulate na\u00efve CD8+ T-cell proliferation in an antigen-independent fashion proliferation (28, 29). However, how M(IL-4) cells direct memory recall responses is unknown. Therefore, we asked how CD8 T cells from LCMV memory, non-transgenic mice would respond to antigen presentation by polarized Sp-M\u03a6. To assess this, we cultured peptide-pulsed either polarized or unstimulated Sp-M\u03a6 with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) labeled splenocytes from LCMV immune WT mice in the absence or presence of IL-2 (Figures 5A,B). Without exogenous IL-2 added to cultures, all the three M\u03a6 populations failed to induce recall proliferation in vitro (data not shown), confirming previously published data by other groups (44). We then increased IL-2 culture concentrations to determine the minimum threshold of exogenous IL-2 required for T-cell expansion. At 5 U/mL, M0 and M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) M\u03a6 induced 40 and 60% CD8+ T-cell proliferation, respectively (Figures 5A,B). In contrast, M(IL-4) induced the lowest proliferation (20%) by antigen-specific CD8+ T cells (Figures 5A,B).",

Upon increasing culture conditions to 10 U/mL of IL-2 (Figure 6B), we noted a partial restoration (an increase of approximately 10%) of IFN-\u03b3 production by CD8+ T cells cocultured with the M(IL-4) stimulators.

LCMV infected all three subsets of M\u03a6 as detected by LCMV-NP expression 24 h post-infection. However, we observed a substantial reduction of LCMV-NP in M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) cells. This is likely owing to the upregulation IFN-\u03b3-induced anti-viral genes inhibiting the replication of capacity of LCMV described (55). M(IL-4) cells effectively processed and presented de novo synthesized antigens to activate GP33-41- and NP396-404-specific CTL. However, when polarized cells were cultured with splenocytes cells from LCMV-immune mice, M(IL-4) cells stimulated the lowest level of CD8+ T-cell proliferation, a deficit that was overridden by increasing the levels of exogenous IL-2 added to the culture system. Collectively, these observations highlight how polarized M\u03a6 modify CD8+ T-cell function and are of particular importance to the design of cell-based immunotherapies.",

Subsequent gene analysis revealed several M(IL-4)-specific markers including program death ligand (PD-L2), resistin like molecule (RELM)-\u03b1 and YM-1, regulating CD4+ T-cell and CD8+ T-cell proliferation (28, 29, 54). Moreover, in vitro M(IL-4) M\u03a6 express high levels of Arginase-1 and can also interrupt TCR signaling through l-arginine deprivation (56). For instance, coculture of M(IL-4) M\u03a6 with Jurkat T cells or spleen T cells for 24 h resulted in the downregulation of CD3\u03b6 T-cell surface expression and inhibition of CD4+ T-cell proliferation (56\u201358). Moreover, l-arginine deprivation yields a G0\u2013G1 arrest by preventing increases of cyclin D3 and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) levels (58). Thus, M(IL-4) cells have the ability to modulate T-cell proliferation by contact-dependent and contact-independent mechanisms.",

Interestingly, supplementing the coculture medium with additional IL-2 restored CD8+ T-cell proliferation and subsequent IFN-\u03b3 secretion upon restimulation. The most likely explanation for this finding is likely due to the ability of IL-2 to tune TCR sensitivity and regulate cell-cycle progression. With regard to TCR sensitivity, exogenous IL-2 restores basally depressed CD3\u03b6 expression in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (59). Moreover, it was recently demonstrated that IL-2 reduces the threshold of activation in CD8+ T cells promoting responsiveness to low antigen levels (60). Therefore, by adding IL-2 we ostensibly improved the TCR sensitivity to antigen. In terms of cell cycle, IL-2 enhances expression of cyclin D3 and CDK4, and activates CDK2 promoting cell-cycle progression into S phase (61, 62). Therefore, it is plausible that additional IL-2 overrides the M(IL-4) cell-induced CD8+ T-cell impairments by increasing CD3\u03b6 expression and promoting entrance into cell cycle. In agreement with this notion, delivery of IL-2 complexed to anti-IL-2 monoclonal antibody breaks established CD8+ T-cell tolerance in an FBL model of murine leukemia (63). As such, future research into the biological mechanisms of our reported novel finding that IL-2 can overcome M(IL-4) stimulatory deficits CD8+ T cell is of immense interest to the immunotherapy field.",

A limitation of these studies was that they did not address the consequence of short-term (<24 h) M(IL-4) M\u03a6\u2013T-cell interactions on CD3\u03b6 expression (57, 59).

However, as ligand concentration increases, so does the diversity of cytokine response and proliferation levels (64, 65).

CD4+ T cells were negatively sorted from LCMV-infected mice (20,000 pfu) on day 4 post-infection as described in Section \u201cMaterials and Methods.\u201d The CD4+ T cells were added in different ratios to a polarized, GP33-41 pulsed Sp-M\u03a6 mixed with splenocytes in culture containing 5 U/mL IL-2. As in Figure 5B, after 4 days of coculturing, the CD8+ T cells were tested for CFSE dilution as described before.
