To appreciate the role that the host immune system plays in Mtb reactivation, we used relatively resistant (C57BL/6) or susceptible (CBA/J) mice, whose susceptibility phenotype is most apparent during late stages of infection, to represent differences in the natural progression of TB between different human populations. CBA/J mice have low numbers of antigen-specific CD4 T cells that produce relatively small amounts of IFN-\u03b3 [1]\u2013[4]. CBA/J mice also have elevated amounts of IL-10 during Mtb infection [5], [6], contributing to their increased susceptibility to infection. However, the importance of CD8+ T cells during Mtb infection in this mouse strain remains unclear.",

PD-1 has classically been used as a marker of T cell exhaustion in viral infection and in cancer [27]\u2013[30], while other studies have found that cells expressing Tim-3 are dysfunctional and lack regulation [31], [32], and that coexpression of PD-1 and Tim-3 leads to extensive dysfunction of CD8+ T cells [33]. Furthermore, CD8+ T cells expressing both PD-1 and CD122 (the \u03b2 subunit of the IL-2 receptor) have been shown to have suppressive qualities and secrete IL-10 [34]. We, and others, have previously demonstrated that Mtb susceptibility in CBA/J mice is mediated by excessive pulmonary IL-10 during infection [1], [2], [5], [35], [36], yet the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Although numerous cell types are capable of producing IL-10, studies have previously shown that IL-10-producing T cells can actively suppress the immune response in TB patients [37], supporting an investigation into the IL-10-producing properties of CD8+ T cells during Mtb infection in CBA/J mice.",

CD8+ T cell expansions expressed the inhibitory molecules PD-1, Tim-3, and/or CD122, and were capable of secreting IL-10. CD8+ T cells from CBA/J mice also preferentially expressed TcR V\u03b28 and V\u03b214, severely limiting the diversity of the CD8+ T cell repertoire. Although V\u03b28 CD8+ T cells could secrete IL-10, in vivo depletion of this specific T cell clonal population during chronic infection did not overtly change the Mtb burden in the lungs in the timeframe tested, although the amount of IL-10 in the lung was reduced indicating some biological impact of depletion. Comparing mouse strains that are relatively resistant and susceptible to Mtb has enabled us to uncover a previously unappreciated role for CD8+ T cells in Mtb susceptibility, and links the poor T cell function previously described by us [4], [6], [36] with increased production of IL-10 in the CBA/J mouse strain.",

In contrast to the reduced number of CD4+ T cells, CBA/J mice demonstrated a significant late accumulation of CD8+ T cells within the lungs as Mtb infection progressed (\nFig. 1b\n), eventually reaching or surpassing the number of pulmonary CD8+ T cells observed in C57BL/6 mice. This late accumulation was absent from C57BL/6 mice which reached a plateau at day 60. Skewing of T cell subset proportions in CBA/J mice could be better appreciated by determination of CD4\u2236CD8 ratios throughout the course of infection (\nFig. 1c\n), where a significant decline in the ratio of CD4+ to CD8+ T cells was observed by day 90 of Mtb infection, preceding the increasing CFU within the lungs of CBA/J mice (\nFig. 1d\n) [4], [6]. BrdU staining of pulmonary CD4+ (\nFig. 1e\n) and CD8+ T (\nFig. 1f\n) cells from CBA/J mice was not dramatically altered throughout infection, suggesting that the increased numbers of CD8+ T cells that were evident in CBA/J mice may not be due to local proliferation, but a consequence of enhanced cellular recruitment. CBA/J mice are known to produce abundant IL-10 in their lungs as Mtb infection progresses [5] and IL-10 can stimulate the proliferation of CD8+ T cells [41]. Therefore, we examined the numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells present in the lungs of CBA/J IL-10\u2212/\u2212 mice over the course of Mtb infection (\nFig. 1g, h\n) and did not observe any differences between wild-type and IL-10\u2212/\u2212 CBA/J mice in CD8+ T cell accumulations at late stages of infection, demonstrating that CD8+ T cell expansions occur independent of IL-10. A significant increase in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was observed in CBA/J IL-10\u2212/\u2212 mice at day 30, reflecting enhanced TH1 immunity in these mice (unpublished observations). These data demonstrate that the accumulation of CD8+ T cells in the lungs of CBA/J mice during chronic infection is not mediated by IL-10.",

As expected, C57BL/6 mice had increasing numbers of CD4+\n[4] and CD8+ T cells that could produce IFN-\u03b3 as infection progressed (\nFig. 2a\n), which paralleled the increasing numbers of T cells within the lung (\nFig. 1\n). CBA/J showed an equivalent increase in IFN-\u03b3-producing CD4+ T cells (\nFig. 2b\n), albeit at a significantly lower number compared to C57BL/6, as we have previously described [3], [4]. Where the data differed, however, was in the finding that the number of IFN-\u03b3-producing CD8+ T cells reached a plateau as early as day 30 post-infection and did not increase any further, despite a significant accumulation of CD8+ T cells within the lungs of CBA/J mice. As Mtb infection progressed we also observed a significant increase in the number of CD8+ T cells from CBA/J mice that could express CD69 (\nFig. 2c\n), with over 40% of all CD8+ T cells in the lungs of CBA/J mice being activated during chronic infection. CD8+ T cells also expressed the suppressor of TH1 responses Tim-3 (\nFig. 2d\n), PD-1 (\nFig. 2e\n), with a small population expressing both PD-1 and CD122 (\nFig. 2f\n). Therefore, although highly activated, a proportion of CD8+ T cell expansions from chronic Mtb infected CBA/J mice had a phenotype that was not associated with TH1 cytokine secretion but was instead linked to immuno-suppressive properties including IL-10 production [34]. Because IL-10 production has been closely linked to Mtb susceptibility of CBA/J mice [5], we next examined the capacity of CD8+ T cells to produce IL-10.",

CD8+ cells from CBA/J mice, and not C57BL/6 mice, were capable of secreting IL-10 in response to TcR cross-linking (\nFig. 3a\n). In contrast, CD8neg cells from both mouse strains were capable of secreting IL-10 under these same conditions (\nFig. 3b\n). IL-10-secreting CD8neg cells were predominantly CD4+ as adherent cells were removed during cell purification and we have failed to detect IL-10 within B cells and neutrophils in both mouse strains (not shown). We also observed that CD8+ T cells from CBA/J and C57BL/6 mice were capable of secreting IFN-\u03b3 under the same culture conditions (measured in the IL-10 ELISPOT supernatants) (\nFig. 3c\n). Culture of purified CD8+ and CD8neg cells from Mtb infected CBA/J mice with Mtb-infected BMDCs in the absence of TcR cross-linking, indicative of an Mtb-specific response, resulted in the secretion of IL-10 from both CD8neg and CD8+ cells (\nFig. 3d\n). Interestingly, the capacity of CD8+ T cells to produce IL-10 increased over time, in parallel to the increasing CFU and CD8+ T cell numbers in the lung. The low SFU, relative to TcR cross-linking likely reflects the challenges of delivering of Mtb antigen into the appropriate processing pathway for presentation to CD8+ T cells.",

At late stages of Mtb infection, we observed that CD8+ T cells from CBA/J mice primarily expressed two variable regions of the TcR beta chain (V\u03b2). V\u03b28 (8.2,8.3) and V\u03b214 were expressed by approximately 45% of all CD8+ T cells in CBA/J mice at day 120 after Mtb infection, compared to a less restrictive repertoire in C57BL/6 mice (\nFig. 4a\n). V\u03b2 expression was comparable on CD4+ T cells from both mouse strains (\nFig. 4b\n), indicating a unique expansion within the CD8+ T cell pool in CBA/J mice as Mtb infection progressed. More detailed examination over the course of Mtb infection showed that the percentage of CD8+ T cells expressing V\u03b28 or V\u03b214 was always significantly higher throughout Mtb infection in CBA/J mice, and this population significantly expanded further at late time points of Mtb infection (\nFig. 4c, d\n). Similar to our findings with CD8+ T cell expansions, we found that both V\u03b28 and V\u03b214 CD8+ T cells were highly activated (\nFig. 4e\n).",

Following CD8+ depletion, Mtb CFU (\nFig. 5a\n), total CD4+ T cell numbers (\nFig. 5b\n) and IFN-\u03b3-producing CD4+ T cells (\nFig. 5c\n) were all moderately altered but data did not reach statistical significance. Interestingly, CD8+ T cell depletion led to a significant decrease in the total amount of IL-10 in the lungs of CBA/J mice (\nFig. 5d\n), reflecting the IL-10-secreting capacity of CD8+ T cells we observed in vitro. Depletion of CD4+ T cells led to significantly increased Mtb burden and mortality before day 120 (not shown) showing that depletion of a known protective T cell subset increased susceptibility. Specific depletion of V\u03b28+ cells also failed to significantly impact the Mtb burden (\nFig. 5e\n), although a modest reduction in CFU was similarly observed. This modest reduction, similar to our findings with CD8+ T cell depletion, suggests that although IL-10 producing CD8+ T cells may not negatively impact the growth of Mtb during the timeframe we investigated, they do not provide protection.",

CD8+ T cells within the lung expressed CD69, indicative of activation and functional capacity, yet failed to show a concomitant enhancement of IFN-\u03b3-producing capacity. These findings indicate that highly activated CD8+ T cells within the lung have alternate function, which we show here to be the capacity to secrete IL-10, measured by ELISPOT due to the known difficulties of measuring IL-10 by intracellular flow cytometry. Altered function was associated with the co-expression of a variety of receptors know for negative regulation of cell function (PD-1, CD122, Tim-3) [25], [28], [33], [34]. In support of our findings, previous studies have shown that in chronic murine Mtb infection PD-1+ T cells can proliferate but fail to secrete IFN-\u03b3 unless this inhibition is overcome by direct TcR stimulation [45], [46]. It is unclear at this time why CD8+ T cells with inhibitory properties arise in CBA/J mice as Mtb infection progresses but we can hypothesize that this is a consequence of enhanced immune activation and subsequent exhaustion due to increasing bacterial loads in this mouse strain (Fig. 1) [4], [6].",

            "text": "Our failure to observe any significant change in CFU following CD8+ or V\u03b28+ T cell depletion can be interpreted in several ways, the simplest being that IL-10-producing CD8+ T cells have no biological influence on the control of Mtb infection. While this is a possibility, we would reason that at the least the presence of IL-10-producing CD8+ T cells can be a putative biomarker of TB disease progression as they are only observed in a mouse strain of Mtb susceptibility, and IL-10 producing T cells have been previously described in the blood of TB patients [37]. In support of a negative role for CD8+ T cells in CBA/J mice, in vivo depletion led to a moderate, albeit not significant, decrease in CFU. Thus is in contrast to CD4+ T cell depletion in which all the mice were either dead or moribund before the necropsy time point (data not shown). These findings indicate that some CD8+ T cells from CBA/J mice fail to contribute to protection in a similar manner than might be expected from studies of other mouse strains [47]\u2013[49]. One possibility for our failure to detect significant changes in CFU following CD8+ T cell depletion is our observation that CD8+ T cells can secrete both IL-10 and IFN-\u03b3. Depletion of all CD8+ T cells would also remove a protective population, leading to a neutral effect. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that blocking the action of IL-10 in CBA/J mice during Mtb infection provides enhanced protection [5], and we consider that blocking the action of IL-10 from IL-10/IFN-\u03b3-secreting CD8+ T cells contributed to this phenotype.",

            "text": "In addition to IL-10 production, we also observed that CD8+ T cells from CBA/J mice had severely restricted diversity of their TcR repertoire which would significantly limit the breadth of antigens that CBA/J CD8+ T cells can recognize. CBA/J mice have an endogenous mouse mammary tumor virus (MTV-6) that selectively deletes various TcR V\u03b2 chains such as V\u03b28.1, and V\u03b2 17a [50], [51] however this alone is not sufficient to explain the limited TcR diversity in CBA/J mice. It is possible that Mtb infection leads to specific deletion of certain subsets of protective CD8+ T cells or is driving clonal expansion of less protective cells (V\u03b28, V\u03b214). Alternatively V\u03b28/V\u03b214 CD8+ T cells in CBA/J mice may respond to a dominant Mtb antigen(s) expressed in vivo, where persistent responsiveness leads to immune exhaustion and subsequent regulation through receptors such as PD-1 and Tim-3. Clonal CD8+ expansions have been described in TB patients [52], including pediatric TB [42], supporting the relevance of our findings to TB in man. Clonal CD8+ expansions are also common in the elderly and in many viral models [42], [43], [53]\u2013[58], yet their importance in Mtb infection is still unclear.",

In combination with our previous finding that blocking the action of IL-10 can improve outcome of Mtb infection [5], these data further support a negative role for IL-10 in the generation and maintenance of protective immunity against Mtb infection. Our findings are of significance because vaccines that specifically stimulate CD8+ T cells are currently under development [59]\u2013[63].
