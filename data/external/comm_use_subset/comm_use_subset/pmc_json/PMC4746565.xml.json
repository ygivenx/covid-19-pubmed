Developing this surveillance system has helped strengthen laboratory and epidemiologic capacity, and these capacities help Jordan in achieving compliance with International Health Regulations, 2005.18 This system provides important data that can contribute to the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System.19 In addition, this system was developed in Jordan in parallel with regional partners as part of the multinational EMARIS Network. The goal of the EMARIS Network is to provide a forum for partner countries to share experiences and develop common methods with the goal of using future data for shared research activities. Finally, this system of surveillance sites linked to advanced laboratory capacity allowed for the rapid development of surveillance for the novel respiratory pathogen Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV) that has recently been described in the region.20 Consequently, this system of SARI and influenza surveillance clearly provides a variety of important benefits both to Jordan and more broadly to regional and international partners working toward disease control and prevention.",

Our system detected hospitalized patients meeting the SARI case definition, which intrinsically limits our sample to those with more severe illness. Therefore, the results may not be indicative of milder influenza activity and trends. The ability of our system to identify cases of influenza is influenced by the sensitivity and specificity of the SARI case definition. Moreover, different case definitions were used over time, and this may have affected the sensitivity of the system over time. The consistency of our data with respect to seasonality, its comparability to other Northern Hemisphere temperate countries, and the proportion of SARI cases that are influenza positive suggest that this surveillance system is performing comparably to other SARI\u2010based influenza surveillance systems. In addition, the high proportion of children among those with SARI and influenza observed may have been influenced by a number of factors. This may reflect societal differences in who is brought in for care. It may also reflect biases in surveillance with better case ascertainment and enrollment among children. Other SARI surveillance systems have also found high proportions of young children,12, 13, 14, 15 so this may suggest that the SARI case definitions used might better identify pediatric symptomatology. Finally, incomplete clinical information was provided for some of our clinical variables, which may have limited our ability to examine these factors in those with influenza. Efforts are ongoing to maintain the motivation of surveillance staff to collect complete and accurate information.",
