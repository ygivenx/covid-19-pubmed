Overall, 34 of 48 measured cytokines and chemokines in the plasma harvested within the first 7 days of the disease onset of H7N9-infected patients were significantly higher than in samples from non-infected control individuals (Fig. 1, Supplemental figure S1). Notably, the elevation of chemokine IP-10, a critical player in the induction of lung injury151617, was the most robust among all of the cytokines and chemokines measured (Fig. 1). Additionally, increased levels of IL-2 and other mediators that participate in the development of T-helper 1, T-helper 2, and T-helper 17 cells were also observed (Fig. 1, Supplemental figure S1)18. Similar cytokine/chemokine profiles were noted in patients whose plasmas were collected during the second week between 8 and 14 days after disease onset (Supplemental Table S1). These data confirmed the presence of hypercytokinemia, also known as a \u201ccytokine storm\u201d, in patients infected with the H7N9 virus and discovered 18 novel hypercytokinemia factors that were elevated in these patients, including MIF, SCF, HGF, SCGF-\u03b2, IL-18, \u03b2-NGF, SDF-1\u03b1, CTACK, IL-1ra, IL-9, G-CSF, IL-7, IL-5, GM-CSF, VEGF, IL-13, basic-FGF, and PDGF-bb elevated in avian influenza infected patients plasmas.",
