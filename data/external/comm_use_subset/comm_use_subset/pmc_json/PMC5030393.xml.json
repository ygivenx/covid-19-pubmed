The virus causes infectious bronchitis (IB), a contagious disease associated with huge economic loses in poultry industry worldwide [2]. Of major concern in the control of IB is the continued emergence of variant IBV strains that differ in terms of their tissue tropism, pathogenicity, and cross protection. Over the years, serological and molecular studies have been carried out extensively to determine the epidemiology of local IBV strains. Remarkably, both classical and variants IBV strains have been reported in different countries [3]. Among the widely identified IBV strains are IBV M41 (classical strain), originally recognized in USA [4, 5], and CR88 (variant strain otherwise known as 793/B or 4/91) which was first reported in Europe [3, 6, 7].",

            "text": "Over the years, control of IBV infection largely depends on vaccination using live attenuated and killed vaccines. However, one of the challenges with live attenuated IB vaccines is that such vaccines are reported to encourage mutation and recombination, thus leading to the emergence of new variant strains. Live attenuated vaccines have also been linked with reversion to virulence, severe disease, and increased mortality rate [8\u201310]. On the other hand, killed vaccines induce humoral but not cell mediated immune (CMI) response and in most cases require adjuvants as well as repeated boosting especially in laying chickens and breeder flocks. These challenges therefore necessitate the needs for novel broad vaccines for the control of IB in poultry [11]. To achieve this, stimulation of both humoral (B-cell) and cell mediated immune (CMI) responses is considered very essential for any candidate vaccine [12]. Neutralizing antibodies are important in removing freely circulating IB virus, whereas cytotoxic T- lymphocytes (CTL) response is crucial for the control and clearance of virally infected cells. The latter is achieved through MHCI immune surveillance as well as antigen presentations which is the function of MHCI molecule and both have been associated with the epitope within the S1 glycoprotein [13, 14]. While much has been documented on MHC restricted allele in human and mouse models, little information is available on the biological functions of these molecules in poultry [15]. A large binding groove of BF2\u22172101 MHCI molecule identified in B21 chicken line is thought to confer conformational flexibility to the crucial Arg9 residue which allows remodeling of key peptide-binding sites and play a role in the resistance against poultry viral infections [16]. Chicken MHC B\u2013F molecules have been structurally and functionally linked to mammalian MHC class I molecules and involved in antigen presentation to the CD8+ T lymphocytes, which is crucial in antiviral immune response [17]. Interestingly, the S1 glycoprotein of IBV (520 aa) contains different immune epitopes responsible for both antibodies and CTL-based immune responses, thus playing major protective role as viral antigenic determinant [18].",

This technology may employ the use of in silico analysis to predict novel B-cells and T-cells immune epitopes for further use in their in vivo applications. One of the innovations in using this technology is the ability to incorporate several epitope peptides directed against different viruses and/or multiple virus strains into one single delivery system with the view to induce broad and specific immune response in single administration [11]. To date, only few epitope based peptide vaccines have been developed and evaluated against IB [20, 21]. The objective of this study therefore is to identify novel B-cells and T-cell epitopes within the S1 glycoprotein of M41 and CR88 IBV strains. The antigenicity of the predicted peptides was also evaluated.",

The present study identified novel B-cells and T-cells epitopes presence in the S1 glycoprotein of M41 and CR88 IBV strains. Predicted antigenic B-cell epitopes were found to be highly conserved and demonstrated strong transmembrane potentials which probably predicts regions of virus-cell interaction.

Remarkably, this study has identified 21 and 18 MHCI binding peptides located within the S1 glycoproteins of M41 and CR88 IBV strains, respectively. Chickens with MHC homozygous B12 and B19 are reported to be more susceptible to infection with IBV-Grey strains as compared with B2/B2 and B5/B5 haplotype which often resist infection [30]. Recently, Tan et al. [21] used BF2\u22174, BF2\u221712, BF2\u221715, and BF2\u221719 chicken MHCI haplotypes to predict 21 CTL-peptide candidates in Massachusetts and Australian T strains. The study revealed that the constructed poly-CTL-epitope DNA vaccine was capable of inducing protection in 90% of the vaccinated chicken following challenge with SH1208 IBV strain. In a different study, Tian et al., 2008 [31] have identified seven T- and B-cells epitopes within the IBV S1 and S2 and NP proteins chimeric DNA vaccine derived from these epitope was found to be associated with 80% protection rate. Interestingly, the regions through which B-cells and T-cells epitope were predicted in this study correspond to the IBV receptor binding domain (RBD) which play a role in sufficient binding as well as entry of IBV viruses [32]. Similarly, epitopes peptides found within RBD have been reported in different study to induce neutralizing antibody response, for example, against human coronavirus and mouse hepatitis virus [33, 34].",
