            "text": "Globally, influenza has been associated with a heavy burden of mortality and morbidity [1]. Vaccination remains an important strategy to reduce disease severity and virus transmission within the community [2]. Although numerous clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of influenza vaccines in children [3], adults [4], and healthy elderly people [5], few studies have included high-risk groups particularly the elderly with underlying chronic conditions. A recent systematic review also concluded that influenza vaccine only had a modest effect in preventing influenza infections among community-dwelling elderly people [6]. Previous cohort or case-control studies reported that vaccine effectiveness was 48% in preventing all-cause mortality [7]. However, according to a study in the US, < 5% of all-cause mortality was specifically associated with influenza, suggesting that the estimates from the observational studies could have been seriously overestimated [8, 9]. Another ecological study conducted in Ontario, Canada also found significant relative reductions in influenza-associated mortality and health care utilization after the introduction of universal vaccination since 2000 in those aged < 65 yrs., but not in those aged \u226565 yrs. [10]. Taken together, available evidence suggests that there is a need to assess the effect of influenza vaccination at the population level, especially for those aged \u226565 years.",

            "text": "Previous studies in Hong Kong have shown that annual vaccination rates for community-dwelling elderly people were less than 3% during the period 2000\u20132002 [11], but increased to more than 50% in 2004\u20132006 [12]. Since October 2009, a subsidy of HK$80 (US$10.30) for annual influenza vaccine and HK$190 (US$24.50) for pneumococcal vaccine has been provided to those aged \u226565 years under the Elderly Vaccination Subsidy Scheme. The vaccination rate remained nearly 40% in the elderly in the 2012/13 season [13]. In Australia, the federal government has been providing free influenza vaccinations for people aged \u226565 years since 1999, and the coverage rates in the older population remained between 70 and 80% during the period of 2002\u20132006 [14]. Unlike Hong Kong, where the SARS outbreak and a new subsidy program greatly increased influenza and pneumococcal vaccine coverage among the older population, Brisbane has had a relatively stable vaccination rate for both vaccines since 2000. Here we hypothesize that if influenza vaccine was effective in older people, the dramatically increased uptake among the older population of Hong Kong since SARS could have resulted in a reduced influenza disease burden. We expect such a reduction to be larger than in Brisbane, where uptake of the vaccine has remained stable among the community dwelling elderly people. Further decrease in disease burden of influenza could have occurred after 2009, as the increased uptake of pneumococcal vaccines in the older population could have reduced the risk of secondary bacterial pneumonia after influenza infections.",

Given that seasonal influenza peaks at different times in these two cites, we defined annual study period as January \u2013 December in Hong Kong and May \u2013 April of next year in Brisbane. These periods begin three months after the usual launch dates for the annual seasonal influenza vaccination campaigns (March in Brisbane and September in Hong Kong), which shall allow for a valid assessment of the vaccination effectiveness. The whole study period was divided into the pre-SARS, SARS, post-SARS, influenza pandemic and post-pandemic periods. The pre-SARS period in Hong Kong was featured with a much lower vaccination rate in the older population compared to the post-SARS and post-pandemic periods, whereas the vaccination rate in the older population of Brisbane was stable across these periods. The burden during the SARS and pandemic periods was not presented, as this was highly affected by different control measures adopted by the health authorities of Hong Kong and Brisbane. The cut-off dates for these periods in Hong Kong and Brisbane are listed in Additional file 1: Appendix 2.",

The proxy variable for influenza in the model was the percentage of specimens that tested positive for influenza each week out of annual total number in each city. The reason why we decided to use annual percentage instead of weekly proportion used in our previous studies is that total numbers of specimens were not available in Brisbane during the whole study period. We added seasonal trends, temperature, humidity, and other respiratory viruses to the model as covariates to estimate influenza-associated excess risks. Dummy variables for the pre-SARS, post-SARS, and post-pandemic periods, together with the interaction terms between these period dummies and the virus activity variables, were also added to test the statistical differences in risk estimates between the different periods, respectively for Hong Kong and Brisbane.",

Kwong et al. [10] compared the relative change of disease burden in Ontario, where a universal influenza vaccination program was launched, to that in other Canadian provinces without such a policy. They found that influenza-associated mortality fell in Ontario and other provinces, but a larger reduction occurred in Ontario. In this study, we found that excess rates of IHD mortality decreased more from the pre-SARS to the post-SARS period in Hong Kong than in Brisbane, but with regard to the other mortality outcomes, excess rates increased more in Hong Kong. With respect to hospitalization in the post-SARS period, significantly lower excess rates were only found for CRD in Hong Kong.

However, due to ethical concerns, a large body of knowledge on the effectiveness of influenza vaccine in the older population has been derived from observational studies, as few randomized controlled trials have been conducted in this high-risk population. A review by Goodwin et al. found that seroprotection and seroconversion achieved in the older population after vaccination was only 25\u201350% of vaccine response in younger adults [19]. A Cochrane review concluded that influenza vaccines were of limited effects, which could probably be explained by weak antibody response in the older population [6]; however, in a recent reanalysis using the same data, Walter et al. made the opposite conclusion [20]. They estimated that influenza vaccine resulted in a 30% reduction in complications after influenza infections, 40% in influenza-like illnesses, and 50% in laboratory confirmed influenza infections, specifically during influenza epidemics. However, there is still an on-going debate on vaccine effectiveness in the older population. Our findings add some evidence of a decrease, or a slow increase, in influenza-associated disease burden among the older population, following a marked increase in influenza vaccine coverage at the population level. However, it should be noted that this effect could have been partially caused by an increase of pneumococcal vaccination at the same time. Given that the effectiveness of influenza vaccine is affected by many factors including pre-existing immunity, antigenic shift, and underlying condition, it is not surprising that we failed to find consistent and significant estimates. This also highlights the challenges of evaluating the benefits of vaccination at the population level, even in the most susceptible older populations.",

The potential explanation could be that H3N2 was more often predominant after 2003 and this subtype has been found associated with higher disease burden than H1N1 and B. The point estimates of RRs were sensitive to modeling parameters, and most had wide confidence intervals. This could be due to only a relatively small proportion of deaths or hospitalizations attributable to influenza. According to our previous studies, each year influenza is associated with nearly 1000 deaths and 10,000 hospitalizations in Hong Kong, accounting for only 3 and 1% of annual total deaths and hospitalizations, respectively [22\u201325]. Negative estimates of excess rates were occasionally derived from some disease outcomes, making it difficult to assess the relative increase/decrease between two cities. Relatively small counts in Brisbane could be the reason why we obtained extremely large or small point estimates for the post-SARS RR of CRD hospitalizations and the post-pandemic RR of stroke mortality in Brisbane; hence, these RRs need to be interpreted with caution. Unfortunately, good quality mortality, hospitalization, influenza surveillance and vaccination data are available in few subtropical countries/regions. Nevertheless, this study is the first to investigate the effectiveness of influenza and pneumococcal vaccination at the population level in warm climates, to our best knowledge.",

Individual vaccination status of those who have died or been hospitalized is unknown and the outcome variables are not specific to influenza. Nevertheless, we have used a previously validated modeling approach to estimate disease burden associated with influenza. Second, we assume that circulating influenza strains and pre-exisitng immunity at the population level are similar between Hong Kong and Brisbane. Therefore, a relative decrease (or less of an increase) in influenza-associated disease burden could reflect the effectiveness of influenza vaccination in terms of reducing adverse outcomes after influenza infections. This assumption may not hold, but there is also no strong evidence against it. Third, only two to five years of data were included in each study period, because influenza virology and hospitalization data prior to 2000 were not available in Hong Kong or Brisbane. Our model obtained some unstable points estimates, especially in the pre-SARS period, which could be due to the short time series and low counts. Last but not least, although we have carefully adjusted for seasonal trends, temperatures, and humidity in our models, there are many confounding factors that remain unadjusted for in this study, such as the prevalence of underlying condition, and difference in health-seeking behaviors between two older populations.",
