Is pulmonary hypertension simply an indicator of the severity of lung injury or is it part of the underlying pathophysiological process contributing to the development of ARDS?

Nineteen had macrothrombi in the pulmonary arterial and capillary vessels [38]. They also found endothelial injury in all stages of ARDS in all cases on both standard histological preparations and electron microscopy. There is now ample evidence supporting the concept of lung injury causing local, as opposed to systemic, coagulation in ARDS [28],[39],[40]. Tissue factor (TF) is released from endothelial cells that have been injured, in response to a variety of pro-inflammatory stimuli [41]. TF is a strong activator of the extrinsic clotting cascade. Increased activation of pro-coagulant processes occurs in the lung in ARDS and does not result from the systemic activation of coagulation (such as is seen in sepsis) [42],[43]. Animal data suggest that blockade of the TF-factor VIIa-factor Xa complex may reduce the degree of pulmonary hypertension in ARDS [44]. Levels of protein C, a natural anti-coagulant, are also reduced in ARDS [45] while levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 are increased in ARDS patients, and both are prognostic of increased mortality in ARDS [46]. More recently, biomarkers of coagulation and inflammation have been shown to provide good discrimination for the diagnosis of patients with ARDS [47],[48], and analysis of SARS-CoV infection in laboratory models has shown that the delicate balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis is shifted towards fibrin deposition during infection leading to ARDS [49]. Therapies targeting this pulmonary coagulopathy may also have an anti-inflammatory effect and attenuate the severity of ARDS [50].",

When PEEP is applied to a diseased lung, the change in PVR is determined by the balance between overdistension of lung units and recruitment of areas with previously low numbers of open alveoli. When the number of open alveoli increases following a recruitment manoeuvre and application of high PEEP, then PVR may even fall in keeping with Whittenberger\u2019s-U shaped relationship between pulmonary vascular resistance and lung volume. Any increase in ventilated alveolar area may also reduce HPV. Canada et al., found that the pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRi) was lowest at 5 cm H2O in the normal lung but 10 cm H2O had to be applied to the injured lung in order to achieve minimal PVRi [58]. Above \u2018optimal PEEP\u2019 levels, the PVR increased, presumably due to compression of intra-alveolar capillaries by the increased airway pressure resulting in an increase in zone 1 and 2 characteristics [23],[59].",

This reflects what we know of the pathophysiology of pulmonary embolism, but the evidence is not as definitive in ARDS. The presence of ACP has not been consistently demonstrated to be associated with excess mortality in ARDS in the modern era of protective ventilation. Perhaps this is because the authors modified their approach to mechanical ventilation in these studies when ACP was recognised, in order to limit the distension of the right ventricle by reducing the airway pressures (PEEP and plateau) and putting the patient in a prone position [17],[21]. Recent echocardiographic derived data on right ventricular dysfunction from Boissier et al. [20] suggest that even when tidal volume and plateau pressure are limited in line with best practice, the incidence of ACP in ARDS is still 22% and is independently associated with mortality in spite of greater use of prone positioning and nitric oxide. Lheritier et al. [21] found a similar incidence of ACP (22.5%) in moderate to severe ARDS patients ventilated with a lung protective strategy, but they could not find an association between the presence of ACP and outcome. In both studies, the groups with ACP had a higher use of nitric oxide and prone positioning compared to those without ACP. It is unclear what accounts for the different findings in these studies.",

This suggests that excessive HPV may contribute to the development of acute oedema, possibly by redistributing pulmonary blood flow away from areas with high degrees of HPV to other sections of the lung, with resultant hyper-perfusion, endothelial injury and capillary leak. This causes a secondary inflammation which is clinically indistinguishable from ARDS [76].",

Many of the mechanisms of PVD in ARDS (the release of multiple vasoactive mediators, vascular remodelling and the formation of vaso-occlusive microthrombi) are caused by the disruption of the normal endothelial-inflammation-coagulation pathways. PVD may be a good summative index of vascular damage from these mechanisms. Nuckton et al. has previously reported that an increased dead space fraction was associated with increased mortality in ARDS [77], which they postulated might be due to injury to the pulmonary capillaries from inflammation and thrombosis and obstruction of pulmonary blood flow in the extra-alveolar pulmonary circulation. There is evidence that extra-pulmonary organ dysfunction in ARDS is caused by the systemic inflammatory response, which in turn is driven by the initiating pulmonary injury [78]. If PVD is primarily a downstream result of the activation of the inflammatory-coagulation cascade in the lung, then, the reason it is associated with mortality in ARDS may be because it reflects the severity of the underlying inflammatory process. This hypothesis may also help to explain why PVD is associated with mortality in well-controlled studies of patients with ARDS whereas right ventricular dysfunction has not been consistently shown to be associated with mortality.",

Using PVD as an index of disease severity might allow researchers an additional way to stratify the severity of lung injury and to test the efficacy of new treatments for ARDS by measuring the change in PVD, which is known to improve as the patient recovers from lung injury. In order to develop new treatments for ARDS, we need better methods for examining their efficacy. Using PVD as an endpoint might improve the predictive value of phase II trials prior to embarking on full scale clinical studies of new treatments. Assessment of pulmonary vascular resistance may be possible using non-invasive echocardiographic technology [79] which would increase the applicability of this approach and may be worth pursuing.",

The two points identified (open circles) show a normal cardiac output and a reduced cardiac output, respectively, in the hypertensive condition. At each of these cardiac outputs, it is clear that the ratio of P to Q is the same and therefore can be used to easily characterise the resistance of the systemic circulation. (B) In the pulmonary circulation, the plot of mean pressure against flow is curvilinear with an intercept on the pressure axis that is equal to left atrial pressure. The blue curve represents a normal pressure flow curve (healthy lung), while the red curve represents pressure flow curve in the presence of hypoxic pulmonary hypertension. The two points identified (open circles) show a normal cardiac output and a reduced cardiac output, respectively, in the hypertensive condition. At each cardiac output the pulmonary vascular resistance, (Ppa-LAP)/Q, is illustrated as the slope of the straight dashed line.
