Recent studies based on large-scale gene knock down and overexpression screenings have evaluated the antiviral activity of hundreds of ISGs acting against RNA and DNA viruses [1\u20134]. Some ISG products display direct antiviral activity and sometimes act on a narrow virus range. Others act by regulating signal transduction pathways controlling IFN production and IFN responses and thus act on a broad range of viruses. The emerging picture is that a given virus is controlled by a specific range of ISGs, some of these ISGs being virus- or virus family-specific and others acting in a more general fashion.",

            "text": "We recently identified a group of mouse ISG that are not or weakly expressed in primary neurons after IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 treatment. Among these genes was the gene encoding apolipoprotein 9b (Apol9b). Apolipoproteins are typically associated with the transport of lipids in the organism. Accordingly, human apolipoprotein L1 (ApoL1) was originally described as a member of the high density lipoprotein family, which is involved in cholesterol transport [5]. However, the other members of the ApoL family were classified on the basis of sequence homology to ApoL1 but their functions may have diverged and remain to be characterized. The ApoL family is highly conserved across species [6]. APOL genes have been implicated in diseases such as schizophrenia and osteoarthritis, and are upregulated by both type I and type II IFNs [6, 7]. In human, six ApoL-coding genes (APOL1, APOL2, APOL3, APOL4, APOL5 and APOL6) are clustered on chromosome 22q12 [8]. ApoL1 has been extensively studied and acts as a restriction factor for trypanosome infection [9]. In addition, ApoL1 and other human ApoL members (ApoL1, L2, L3 and L6) have emerged in high-throughput screenings of ISG activity, as proteins with antiviral activity against various classes of RNA viruses [1, 4]. ApoL1 restricted infection of cells by the AR86 strain of Sindbis virus and more modestly by Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus and human parainfluenza virus type 3, but increased infection by Yellow fever virus. ApoL2 slightly inhibited hepatitis C virus replication but had pro-viral activity toward Influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). ApoL6 was reported to have antiviral activity against two picornaviruses, coxsackie B virus and poliovirus. ApoL6 also displays inhibitory activity against RSV [1, 4]. Overexpression of ApoL6 triggers apoptosis, which suggests that the antiviral effect of ApoL proteins may correlate with cell sensitization to apoptosis [10].",

The murine Apolipoprotein L family is encoded by 12 genes and 1 pseudogene (Apol6, Apol7a, Apol7b, Apol7c, Apol7e, Apol8, Apol9a, Apol9b, Apol10a, Apol10b, Apol11a, Apol11b and pseudogene Apol10c) clustered on chromosome 15 (Fig 1). Murine ApoL6 is orthologous to human ApoL6, murine ApoL7a to human ApoL5, murine ApoL7b to human ApoL4 and murine ApoL8 to human ApoL2. It is unclear which human protein is orthologous to mouse ApoL9. We previously reported that ApoL9b is an antiviral ISG active against Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV or Theiler\u2019s virus) [11]. The weak expression of Apol9 in IFN-treated mouse primary neurons contributes to the surprising susceptibility of these cells to virus infection. This study aimed at defining the properties of murine ApoL9 proteins and at characterizing their antiviral functions.",

These viruses contain capsids adapted to infect L929 cells efficiently [26]. KJ7 and KJ26 were produced, as described [27, 28], from the corresponding full-length cDNA clones pKJ7 and pKJ26. The TMEV replicon expressing the firefly luciferase (called TM973) was constructed by replacing the L-capsid-part of 2A region (nucleotides 1064 to 3925 of pTMDA1-accession JX443418 [29]), by a DNA segment assembled by PCR and carrying in frame: i) the firefly luciferase ORF PCR-amplified from pGL4.16 (Promega); ii) the 2A coding sequence of FMDV which enables co-translational dissociation of the protein segment translated downstream of this sequence [30], and iii) the CRE replication signal of pTMDA1 [31]. The VSV (Strain Indiana) derivative expressing eGFP from an additional transcription unit located between the G and L genes was a gift from Martin Schwemmle (Univ. of Freiburg, Germany) [32]. The MuHV-4 derivative used in this study contains the eGFP gene in a bacterial artificial chromosome cassette [33] and was generated and purified as described previously [34]. Viruses used in this study were produced and titrated on BHK-21 cells.",

First, we confirmed that N-terminally and C-terminally FLAG-tagged ApoL9b conserved the ability to exert an antiviral activity against TMEV in L929 cells (Fig 2A). Next, FLAG-tagged ApoL9b was detected by immunofluorescence in HeLa-M cells transduced with lentiviral constructs. ApoL9 localization was similar in cells transduced with pMK65 and pMK66, expressing N- and C-terminally tagged ApoL9b proteins respectively (not shown). We observed a diffuse cytoplasmic labeling and accumulation of ApoL9b as granule-like structures in part of the cells (Fig 2B). ApoL9b granules did not co-localize with markers for mitochondria (Fig 2C), endoplasmic reticulum, endosomes, lysosomes, P-bodies, Golgi vesicles, and lipid droplets or with viral components such as double-stranded RNA or VP1 capsid antigen (data not shown). Interestingly, in contrast to prototypic apolipoproteins, which are secreted, ApoL9 does not contain any predicted signal sequence (Signal P scores were 0.119 for ApoL9a and 0.133 for ApoL9b \u2013cutoff value was 0.5) nor is it predicted to be secreted by a non-canonical secretory pathway by the Secretome P server. Absence of ApoL9 secretion by the classical secretion pathway was further confirmed by showing that Brefeldin A treatment did not trigger accumulation of N- or C-terminally FLAG-tagged ApoL9 proteins in transfected 293T cells, in contrast to C-terminally FLAG-tagged IFN-\u03b1 that was taken as a secreted protein control (Fig 2D). We conclude that ApoL9 are cytoplasmic proteins that are not secreted, at least not by the classical secretion pathway.",

            "text": "Expression patterns of Apol9a and Apol9b in mouse organs were very similar, in agreement with the fact that their putative gene promoter sequences were highly conserved. In untreated mice, both genes were predominantly expressed in the liver, and to a lesser extent, in pancreas, adipose tissue and intestine (Fig 3A). Circulating IFN-\u03b1 triggered Apol9 upregulation in many tissues (Fig 3A). In the liver, upregulation of Apol9 expression by IFN-\u03b1 was less clear, likely because basal expression of Apol9 was already very high in this organ. In the central nervous system (CNS), the induction of Apol9 was also moderate, presumably because ApoL9 gene transcription is low in neurons and because circulating IFN-\u03b1 did not cross the blood brain barrier. However, Apol9 expression was upregulated in the brain and spinal cord after infection with Theiler\u2019s virus, likely because of local type I IFN production (Fig 3B). Accordingly, screening of the GEO microarray database [44] confirmed that Apol9 expression increased with viral infection, in vivo, in many mouse tissues (Table 4). In L929 fibroblasts, time course of Apol9a and Apol9b gene induction after IFN-\u03b2 stimulation was comparable to that of Oasl2 (Fig 3C). Upregulation of Apol9 gene transcription was almost maximal from 6 hours post-treatment, suggesting that Apol9 expression is directly induced by type I IFN. Taken together, our data indicate that Apol9a and Apol9b are bona fide ISGs that share a similar expression profile. Intriguingly, in spite of the unusual cytoplasmic nature of these apolipoproteins, they are mainly produced by liver cells, like typical apolipoproteins.",

L929 cells were first transduced with lentiviral vectors pMK85 and pMK44 co-expressing Apol9a or Apol9b and mCherry, or with the control vector, pTM942, expressing mCherry alone. Three days after transduction, cells were infected with the various GFP-expressing viruses and analyzed by flow cytometry. Replication of the various viruses (GFP fluorescence) was analyzed in the population of transduced (mCherry-positive) cells. As shown in Fig 4A, Apol9a and Apol9b expression significantly inhibited infection by both persistent and neurovirulent TMEV strains but had little impact, if any, on the other tested viruses. To confirm these results, infectious virus yield was examined by plaque assay. Therefore, cells were transduced with the same Apol9-expressing lentiviral vectors. Three days after transduction, mCherry-positive cells were sorted and cultured for 2 days before infection with the GFP-expressing TMEV, MuHV-4 and VSV derivatives. Infectious virus yield was measured by plaque assay (Fig 4B). Again, ApoL9 expression significantly reduced TMEV but not MuHV-4 or VSV production. These data confirm the restricted virus range of ApoL9 antiviral activity.",

Since this domain is well conserved in other ApoL proteins including ApoL9 (Fig 1C), we tested whether ApoL9a and ApoL9b proteins could exert their antiviral activity by sensitizing cells to apoptosis. Apoptosis was measured with a caspase 3/7 assay, in L929 cells that were transduced with an empty vector or with lentiviral vectors expressing Apol9a or Apol9b (Fig 5A). In the absence of TMEV infection, ApoL9 expression did not increase but rather triggered a minor decrease of caspase activity. Staurosporine strongly increased caspase activity as expected, irrespective of ApoL9 expression. Infection of cells with TMEV induced apoptosis. However, cells expressing Apol9 were slightly but significantly less sensitive to virus-induced apoptosis than control cells (Fig 5A). This result excludes that ApoL9 may act by sensitizing infected cells to apoptosis. In contrast, ApoL9 appears to restrict viral infection and thereby to limit virus-induced apoptosis. Similar results were obtained by comparing caspase activity in three Apol9b-overexpressing and three control L929 cell clones obtained previously [11] (data not shown). In conclusion, contrary to the reported pro-apoptotic activity of human ApoL6, the antiviral effect of ApoL9 does appear to be mediated by a pro-apoptotic influence of ApoL9.",

Replicon-derived luciferase activity was measured in L929 cells transduced with the empty pTM942 vector or with the pTM942 derivatives expressing ApoL9 (Fig 5B). From 10 hours post-transfection, luciferase activity was significantly lower in all ApoL9-expressing cell populations. We conclude that ApoL9 restricts the replication of TMEV.",

Therefore, mouse (Neuro-2A) and human (293T) cells were transfected with vectors allowing the expression of N- or C-terminally FLAG-tagged ApoL9b. Cellular partners of ApoL9b were identified 24 hours post-transfection, by co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry. Two protein bands were detectable on Comassie blue-stained gels loaded with products that co-precipitated with ApoL9b in both Neuro-2A and 293T cells (Fig 6A and data not shown). For both mouse and human cells, bands 1 and 2 were identified as prohibitin 1 and -2 (Phb1 and Phb2) respectively (Fig 6B and S1 Dataset). Prohibitins (PHBs) 1 and 2 are two ubiquitous multifunctional proteins that may act as chaperones (reviewed by Thuaud, Ribeiro [46]). Interaction between ApoL9b and PHBs was further confirmed by detection of FL AG-ApoL9b and ApoL9b-FLAG after immunoprecipitation of endogenous Phb1 or Phb2 proteins from cells expressing the FLAG-tagged ApoL9 proteins (Fig 6C). In these experiments, a N-terminally FLAG-tagged TMEV L* protein, used as negative control, was not (Phb1) or very weakly (Phb2) co-immunoprecipitated with prohibitins, supporting the specificity of the ApoL9-prohibitin interaction. The experiment could, however, not be confirmed with endogenous ApoL9 proteins, given the lack of anti-ApoL9 antibodies.",

Knock down of PHBs expression was confirmed by western blot (Fig 7A and data not shown). As reported previously [48], knocking down either Phb1 or Phb2 triggered a strong reduction in the amount of both Phb proteins, presumably because stability of Phb1 and Phb2 depends on their mutual interaction. It is worth noting that PHBs knock down triggered a cell growth inhibition from about 5 days post-transduction, which prevented the use of sorted pure populations of PHB knock down cells. Thus, three days after the transduction of ApoL9-expressing cells with vectors expressing shRNA directed against PHBs or control vectors, cells were infected with the GFP-expressing KJ7 virus and analyzed by flow cytometry.",

Knocking down Phb2 and, to a lesser extent, Phb1 expression in cells that overexpressed Apol9 significantly enhanced but did not fully restore infection (Fig 7B). Interestingly, knocking down Phb2 also increased infection by TMEV in cells that did not overexpress Apol9, suggesting that this prohibitin has antiviral activity per se, against TMEV. This increase of TMEV infection after knock down of Phb gene expression was unexpected. Indeed, PHBs were previously reported to act as pro-viral factors that facilitate Dengue 2 (DENV-2), Chikungunya (CHIKV) and H5N1 virus entry in cells [48\u201350]. We therefore compared the influence of Phb knock down on infection by TMEV (KJ7 or KJ26), MuHV-4, and VSV, using flow cytometry (Fig 7C). While Phb2 knock down reproducibly favored the infection by both strains of TMEV, it failed to significantly affect MuHV-4 infection and even inhibited VSV infection. We also monitored virus yield, by plaque assay, after PHBs knock down. For this purpose, cells were transduced with the shRNA-expressing lentiviral vectors, at concentrations calculated to yield 90\u201395% of transduction. Three days after transduction, cell populations were infected with VSV, MuHV-4 and TMEV and virus yield was measured by plaque assay (Fig 7D). This experiment confirmed the strong pro-viral activity of PHBs toward VSV but failed to show the anti-viral effect of PHBs toward TMEV. The discrepancy between the highly reproducible negative effect exerted by PHBs against TMEV infection, measured by flow cytometry and the positive effect on infectious virus particles production may be the consequence of contrasting roles of PHBs at different steps of the virus infection cycle (pro-viral for entry and anti-viral for replication). Alternatively, it may be an indirect effect of the progressive cell growth inhibition that occurs over time, after PHBs knock down.",

Furthermore, immunofluorescent detection did not show any association of ApoL9 with components of the secretory pathway, such as the endoplasmic reticulum or the Golgi apparatus. Our interpretation of these data is that ApoL9 is not secreted, at least not by the classical secretory pathway.

In part of the cells, ApoL9 formed granule-like structures. In the absence of anti-ApoL9 antibodies to detect the endogenous protein, we cannot prove that these granules are formed in physiological conditions. However, a recent work reports the appearance of similar granules in the case of human ApoL2 [52]. Neither ApoL2 nor ApoL9 granules colocalized with tested subcellular compartments.

PHBs are highly conserved and widely expressed proteins, which are present in many different cellular compartments including the cytoplasm, mitochondria and cell surface [53, 54]. They interact with many proteins, including viral proteins and are sometimes considered as chaperones (reviewed by Thuaud, Ribeiro [46]). Knocking down Phb2 expression did not completely abrogate the antiviral protection conferred by ApoL9 overexpression (Fig 7B). This suggests that PHBs association with apoL9 is not strictly required for ApoL9 antiviral activity. Alternatively, the incomplete abrogation of ApoL9 activity may result from incomplete Phb knock down. It is tempting to speculate that PHBs may act as chaperones to stimulate the antiviral activity of ApoL9. More surprisingly, Phb2 knock down slightly but reproducibly increased cell susceptibility to TMEV replication, independently of ApoL9 expression. This suggests that PHBs may, per se, have an antiviral activity. This is contrasting with the strong proviral effect of PHBs observed for VSV (Fig 7B and 7C) Dengue virus 2 (DENV-2), Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and H5N1 influenza virus [48\u201350].",
