One such viral strategy involves hijacking signalling pathways that ultimately control host gene transcription. Interactions between intracellular viral proteins and cellular kinases responsible for signal transduction are a means by which to achieve this. However, there is growing evidence to support the premise that glycoproteins on the surface of virus particles may trigger intracellular signalling pathways by interacting with their cognate receptors on the host cell membrane [1].",

Inhibition of NF-KB signalling by the introduction of a dominant-negative NF-\u03baB repressor abolished protection from gD-induced Fas-mediated apoptosis.

However, it has come to light that HSV-1 may induce two distinct phases of NF-\u03baB activity. The initial phase is transient, lasting only two hours, and occurred shortly after viral adsorption by both wild-type and UV-inactivated virus particles. This correlates with evidence showing that supernatant taken from gD-expressing cells may also cause an increase in NF-KB binding activity in monocytoid cells by 30 minutes post-treatment [6]. A second phase relied on de novo viral protein synthesis as it was stimulated only by replication-competent HSV-1 and not by UV-inactivated virions [8]. During this second phase, NF-\u03baB complexes were shown to have associated with their consensus sequence found in the promoter region that drives ICP0 expression [8].",

The use of UV-inactivated particles in signalling studies simulates infection but these particles are able to enter cells and deliver virion proteins to the cytoplasm.

Recalling that the more abundant a transcript the fewer number of cycles it takes to cross a threshold set in the exponential phase of PCR product accumulation (the CT value), Figure 2 plots the \u0394CT value on the y-axis, (i.e. the CT value for the gene of interest after normalisation against the RPL13) against the multiplicity of infection on the x-axis. As the multiplicity of \u0394gH increases the CT value decreases, indicating an increase in the abundance of transcripts for all three NF-\u03baB targets (Figure 2(a)). A logarithmic regression analysis across three logs of multiplicity show a high correlation between the four CT values for each transcript with r2>0.98. Similarly for the JAK/STAT responsive target NOS2A there are almost two cycles of a difference between the level of transcripts after infection with 1 particle/cell compared to 1000 particles/cell (Figure 2(b)).

Suppression of NF-\u03baB activity is via negative feedback up-regulation of the inhibitor I\u03baB\u03b1 (nfkbia), which was also stimulated by the binding of entry-defective HSV-1 virions. The triggering of early NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity was most likely through the coupling of gD on entry-defective virions to the TNF superfamily receptor HvEM [1]. In doing so, not only does the initial activation of this pathway allow for the subsequent sequestration of the NF-\u03baB p65 subunit to the ICP0 promoter, but is crucial for immediate-early gene transcription and subsequent HSV-1 replication [8].",

Nevertheless, productive infection with HSV-1 can down-regulate the triggered ISG response, allowing viral replication to continue unhindered [40]. Despite our evidence that gD binding by entry-defective virions can induce IFN-\u03b1 mRNA expression, independent of gD glycosylation status, these data also fit with published observations that binding by HSV-1 is insufficient to cause the up-regulation of interferon-stimulated genes [30]. The up-regulation of IFN-\u03b2, albeit it through a different mechanism, is suggestive of a previously unidentified role for gH in eliciting a change in host gene expression. An entry-defective HSV-1 mutant lacking gB that also contains an RGE rather than the integrin binding RGD motif of gH has been constructed and future studies may further elicit the role of gH in interferon stimulation.",

Its up-regulation is rapidly induced after mitogenic stimulation or the introduction of serum and increased expression of c-Myc is consistent with the advancement of cellular proliferation [41]. Control of myc transcription can be influenced by a number of pathways, including PI3K/Akt signalling, which was shown here to occur as a result of binding by gD. A central role for c-Myc in promoting cell-cycle progression is evident from the genes that it can up-regulate such as eIF2 [42]. Progression of the cell cycle depends on the additional activity of cyclin-dependent kinases. By interacting with the promoters for genes encoding cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases, c-Myc can influence the advancement on the cell cycle into the G1/S phase [43].",

Binding by gD to HvEM may lead to the activation of TRAF molecules, which in turn stimulate the NF-\u03baB signaling cascade. This pathway up-regulates a number of cellular genes in addition to augmenting early viral gene expression. NF-\u03baB-responsive genes, birc2 and birc3, have an anti-apoptotic role, but paradoxically, inflammatory mediators such as ccl2 are also up-regulated. gD-induced signalling of the Jak/Stat and Jak/Src pathways also results in the differential expression of genes associated with anti-apoptosis and inflammation. The up-regulation of c-Myc could lead to a corresponding increase in cdk2, which has a role in promoting DNA replication and gene transcription during infection. It should be noted that most signalling cascades have been elucidated in non-fibroblast cells lines, so the role of specific kinases may vary in HFFs.",
