            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoV) affect a diverse group of animal hosts, and cause a plethora of diseases in animals including progressive peritonitis, acute and chronic hepatitis, gastroenteritis, nephritis, and encephalitis [1]. In humans, coronavirus infection results in respiratory tract complications with varying degree of severity and has been associated with gastroenteritis. Four human coronaviruses (HCoV; 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1) are endemic in the human population and are mainly associated with mild, self-limiting respiratory illnesses. Another two human coronaviruses, namely severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, cause severe respiratory syndromes and present a significant threat with their high fatality rates. The clinical presentation of the four non-severe, endemic, human coronaviruses is largely indistinguishable symptomatically, commonly presenting with rhinorrhea, sore throat, cough and fever [2,3]. Majority of infections are associated with self-limiting upper respiratory tract disease or \u201cthe common cold\u201d but can also present with high morbidity outcomes of the lower respiratory tract including bronchiolitis, pneumonia, [4,5,6], asthmatic exacerbations [7] acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [8] and croup in HCoV-NL63 infected patients [9], and commonly results in hospitalization. Febrile seizures have been reported for most human coronaviruses but the significance of HKU1 is alarming with one study indicating that 50% of patients infected with HKU1 experience febrile seizures [7].",

With the ever increasing diversity of animal coronavirus species, especially within bats, the likelihood of recombination leading to future outbreaks is high and the threat of potential pandemics is real as highly pathogenic coronaviruses continue to spill over from zoonotic sources into the human population. Misdiagnosis of these outbreaks pose a further substantial threat to healthcare workers with nosocomial spread to other patients putting further pressure on an already strained healthcare system. As there is currently no antiviral strategy to combat infection with human coronaviruses [14], and supportive care is the primary treatment regime, the importance of identifying broad spectrum lead compounds is increasing.",

It has even been termed \u201cthe Achilles\u2019 heel of coronaviruses\u201d [15]. A wide variety of inhibitor classes, including peptidomimetic analogues, covalent inhibitors and small molecule inhibitors have been assessed. These compounds have been identified by ab initio structure-based design, high throughput and virtual screening [15,16], where inhibitors either target the enzyme active site or the allosteric dimerization domain [17,18]. The first generation of 3CLpro inhibitors were irreversible peptidomimetic structures, often five residues in length with at reactive warhead at the terminus that formed a covalent bond between the thiolate anion of the catalytic Cys145 residue and the reactive atom of the warhead [19]. These reactive warheads have included Michael acceptors [20,21,22], aldehydes [23], epoxy-ketones [24], halo-methyl ketones [25], and trifluoromethyl ketones [26]. Peptide derivative warhead inhibitors were later followed by the development of non-peptidic covalent inhibitors [27,28]. The use of covalent inhibitors is however limited due there propensity for off-target side-effects and toxicity [29]. Recent studies have therefore focused more on the development of noncovalent inhibitors, which have generally produced large peptidomimetic compounds with low ligand efficiency [19] and currently there is still no effective therapy for the treatment of HCoVs [14]. All coronavirus 3CLpro share a high sequence homology, as well as main chain architecture and substrate conservation [30,31], which makes the identification of broad spectrum lead compounds more viable.",

Substrate specificity of coronavirus 3CLpro is mainly determined by the P1, P2 and P1\u2032 positions [31]. The P1 position has an absolute specificity for glutamine which stabilizes the S1 subsite via a hydrogen bond with the imidazole N\u03b52 of His162/3 and van der Waals interactions with surrounding residues of the S1 pocket. The P2 site has a preference for leucine or methionine to fill the hydrophobic S2 pocket. The sidechains of the S3 site are solvent-exposed and therefore this site is expected to tolerate a wide range of functionality, but shows a preference for basic residues [32]. Sidechains and backbones of residues surrounding the S4 site create a highly congested pocket which favors a small, hydrophobic residue in the P4 position, either Ser, Thr, Val or Pro [32,33,34]. The S1\u2032 and S2\u2032 subsites also accommodate small residues in the P1\u2032 and P2\u2032 positions, which may include Ser, Ala or Gly [33,35]. A typical cleavage recognition site is therefore (Ser, Ala)-(Val, Thr)-Leu-Glu \u2193 (Ser, Ala, Gly), which is conserved among all coronavirus 3CLpro [36]. These features can therefore be exploited in the design of potential broad spectrum lead compounds.",

At the time this study commenced, only one structure could be identified in complex with a small molecule inhibitor. This structure, with PDB code 3V3M [19], also represented the only coronavirus 3CLpro with a noncovalent inhibitor. As this structure could be used for necessary benchmarking in latter studies, it was chosen to represent the SARS-CoV 3CLpro. The crystallographic structure contains a noncovalent, furyl amide ligand, ML188, which was identified by a high throughput screen, with subsequent lead optimization based on structure-activity relationships within the S1, S1\u2032 and S2 binding pockets.",

Accurate replication of the experimental binding pose by molecular docking will confirm the suitability of the docking algorithm for virtual screening. Initial studies on structure-based design of inhibitors, targeting the 3CLpro of coronaviruses, were focused on peptidomimetic compounds with a reactive warhead group that formed an irreversible, covalent interaction with the active Cys residue [19]. These large, covalent inhibitors would be incompatible with molecular docking as replication of the quantum mechanics necessary for covalent bond formation is outside the capabilities of molecular docking [55]. From the PDB several experimental structures of the 3CLpro of various species of coronaviruses with bound inhibitor could be identified. Almost all of these structures represented large, peptidomimetic, covalent inhibitors, with the exception of 3V3M [19]. The structure of 3V3M represented the only noncovalent inhibitor of modest size that we could identify from the PDB. Replication of the binding mode of the bound inhibitor, ML188, by the docking algorithms used in the virtual screen and subsequent refinement process would indicate that they are well calibrated for this class of receptor.",

Ranking the initial virtual screen based on docking score alone serves as a starting point in the selection criteria and assumes that the predicted binding affinity somewhat reflects true binding affinity [58,59,60]. The lowest binding score within this hit-list corresponded to \u22129.5 kcal/mol. Scoring functions have shown success in differentiating between binders and non-binders [61] by ranking the binding score. For this reason, all ligands which achieved this score were also included in the study, yielding a total of 1527 hit compounds.

The initial stage of refinement included redocking with Glide under standard precision and rescoring with its internal Glide GScore scoring function. In order to define a threshold binding score cut-off to prefilter hits, the crystallographic structure of 3V3M, with bound inhibitor ML188, was used. As most scoring functions cannot be compared between structures it is important to define a binding score cut-off based on a related experimental structure [57]. The inhibitor ML188 achieved a binding affinity estimation of \u22128.1 kcal/mol when bound to 3V3M. In an effort to reduce the numbers of false negatives this value was decreased to \u22127 kcal/mol. As a subsequent stage of hit-list refinement the identified hit compounds and 2ZU2 receptor were directly imported into GOLD for redocking and rescoring. A GOLDScore Fitness cut-off was defined as 60 and again used to prefilter hits [42].",

Each ligand was therefore assessed with the Pose Filter script of Schr\u00f6dinger and manually in Maestro to confirm that each ligand identified in the hit-list met these pharmacophoric constraints. These comprehensive filters of three sampling and scoring algorithms and pharmacophoric feature constraints provided us with a highly defined hit-list of 116 compounds.

The use of multiple techniques therefore improves the probability of identifying a diverse set of lead compounds. The pharmacophore model was based largely on a single covalent inhibitor. This inhibitor was chosen as it possesses several favorable noncovalent features for the generation of a pharmacophore model. As general practice, several inhibitors are often used to generate a pharmacophore model where features that are frequently repeated are included in the pharmacophore [73]. For 3CLpro these features are well documented [32,70,71,74] and the presence of several active ligands would only serve to replicate the prior knowledge. The essential features of the pharmacophore model included a hydrogen bond acceptor in the P1 position and a hydrophobic moiety in the P2 position. Non-essential features included a hydrogen bond donor and acceptor in the position to interact with Glu166, a hydrogen bond acceptor in the P4 pocket, a single hydrogen bond donor in the P2 and P3 pockets and an acceptor in the P1\u2032 pocket. A total of four features, including the two essential features and any two of the non-essential features, within an excluded volume of 1 \u00c5 were required for a potential hit to satisfy the pharmacophore model.",

The protonation of the ligands generated several steric clashes within the active pocket of 3D23 and refine-only docking with Glide was therefore used to remove these clashes.

This was the sole reason for the inability to replicate the binding mode, seen in 2ZU2 and 3D23, in the remaining structures.

The orientation of all S1 subsite residues including His162, Phe139, Glu165, His171 and Tyr160 remained unaltered and therefore could not attribute to this loss of stability. The movement may most likely be attributed to by an initial minor loss of stability caused by the movement of Ala143 closer to the pyridine ring, with subsequent bond formation between the Ala backbone and pyridine N. This movement destabilized the pyridine ring, which subsequently formed a new hydrogen bond with Gly142. At this point the pyridine had almost completely lost its orientation in the S1 pocket, which resulted in further loss of the van der Waals interactions leading to complete dissociation from the pocket (Figure 5).

The orientation of the pyridine ring in 3TLO is somewhat stabilized by a bifurcated interaction with the sidechain of Glu166 which promoted the movement of the pyridine N away from Ala143 without disrupting the interaction with His162. Lead optimization steps may therefore preferentially incorporate a core structure that prevents rotation of the pyridine by resulting steric clashes. As mentioned previously, the exploration of a phenylalanine substituent, imidazole or lactam ring in this position may also contribute positively to the stability of the ligand within the S1 pocket [46,47,77].",

The sidechain of Gln189 was shown to form a hydrogen bond with the ligand in 3V3M, 3D23 and OC43 3CLpro, however this residue was highly solvent exposed and therefore resulted in a high degree of flexibility of the sidechain, which should hinder the formation of this bond. For 3D23 and OC43 3CLpro this was observed, where the frequency of bond formation was 27% and 6% respectively.

Structures, including 3V3M and 3D23, observed significant fluctuations within their stable conformation which was largely attributed to by the presence of the solvent exposed dioxolane moiety, which had few features and interactions to stabilize it within the pocket. As this structure contributed few interactions, future studies may explore the removal of this substituent to ascertain its effects on stability. Radius of gyration again confirmed RMSD results where all structures fluctuate between 4.7 \u00c5 and 5.0 \u00c5, with the exception of 2ZU2 which deterred greatly at approximately 6 ns that signified the point at which the pyridine ring completely dissociated from the S1 pocket. This however did not result in an increase in solvent accessible surface area where all structures fluctuated between 3.8 nm2 and 4.4 nm2. With the exception of 2ZU2, these structures confirmed, with great confidence, the interactions and conformations observed within our rigid pharmacophore model.

For this reason, we used a joint docking and pharmacophore modeling based virtual screening strategy to identify a highly defined list of potential lead compounds. Molecular docking and pharmacophore modeling are extremely useful tools in the design and identification of novel lead compounds and have relatively low infrastructure and fiscal dependence. Its importance in the pharmaceutical industry cannot be overlooked even though it does have several shortcomings. Fundamental flaws in these structure-based techniques include the static nature of the receptor and the implicit solvent models used for virtual screening. Molecular dynamics is the most advanced in silico tool, which allows us to fill this void by incorporating Newtonian physics to simulate the dynamic movements of proteins in an explicit solvent model thereby replicating the native environment of the protein. Molecular dynamic simulations also provide a mechanistic explanation for any ligand inactivity, which would be impossible to identify with in vitro techniques. In this study, it has identified the key feature responsible for the destabilization of the ZINC09411012 ligand within the 2ZU2 binding pocket and thereby allowed us to identify which substituents should be replaced in further rounds of lead optimization. As ligand inactivity may be a result of a single misplaced substituent this mechanistic view point provides extensive information for future lead optimization.",

The pyridine ring that fills the S1 pocket in 3V3M is stable in both modelled ligand-protein complexes and with the known inhibitor, ML188, it is evident that this feature contributes positively to antiviral effects of the inhibitor [19]. However, with the remaining 3CLpro, several complexes showed instability of the pyridine ring within the S1 pocket. We therefore propose that future lead optimization explores the effects of incorporating a lactam ring in this position as it is known to better replicate the interactions of the natural substrate and is also effective against the SARS-CoV 3CLpro [46]. A phenylalanine substituent and an imidazole ring have also been shown to be efficacious in this P1 position [47,77]. The replication of the majority of interactions that were observed in the static structure-based models for ZINC27332786, from molecular docking, and ZINC09411012, from pharmacophore modeling, suggests that the structure-based techniques were correct in identifying the key interactions and orientation of the ligand within the pocket. We can therefore confidently assume that the remaining ligands identified in the structure-based techniques are, in fact, in their correct conformation and do represent promising lead compounds.",

The diverse and comprehensive approach of hit-list refinement also ensures a high likelihood of the presence of bioactives within the list. This study provides a promising start in the pursuit of active lead compounds for the broad spectrum inhibition of the 3CLpro associated with human coronaviruses. These results strongly support further in vitro testing of this highly refined hit-list. Activity data will provide valuable information on the structure of bioactive scaffolds and could represent the next generation of small lead molecules. In conclusion, in the drug-design sphere, a variety of computational approaches have been used at the various stages of the drug-design process in support of the experimental techniques. Structure-based and ligand-based drug design approaches have developed into valuable drug discovery tools [78], owing to their versatility and synergistic character [79]. Importantly, however, predictions from virtual screening methods are not meant to replace experimental affinity determination, but can complement the experimental methods by producing an enriched subset of a large chemical database, with an increased possibility of the compounds actually binding to the drug target of interest [80,81]. Therefore, since past research has shown that many predicted drug candidates fail to prove effective in vivo the experimental validation of the identified 19 ligands reported in this manuscript is essential.
