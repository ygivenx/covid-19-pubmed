Previous studies on DENV-challenged mice showed that DIII-specific antibodies form a significant fraction of neutralizing antibodies and possess highly neutralizing activity.19, 20 Intriguingly, it was found that the neutralizing human antibodies mainly recognize quaternary structure-dependent epitopes presented on the intact virion in human immune sera;21 however, the majority of antibodies produced during a primary infection of individuals are non- or poorly neutralizing antibodies that are typically recognized by the fusion loop or bc-loop on DII of the E protein22, 23 and may cause antibody-dependent enhancement.6, 24 For instance, pre-existing DENV immunity was found to be highly cross-reactive to ZIKV and potently increase the subsequent infection of ZIKV.6, 24 These findings highlight the importance of directing antibodies specifically against ZIKV DIII to prevent and treat ZIKV infection.",

            "text": "A number of potent neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting ZIKV DIII have been recently described, but all were isolated from ZIKV-infected mice or individuals.25, 26, 27, 28 The current study sought to develop ZIKV DIII-specific fully human mAbs with novel properties and minimal divergence from their germline predecessors. To do this, we chose recombinant ZIKV envelope DIII as the antigen for panning a very large na\u00efve IgM library (containing ~1011 antibodies) constructed from the blood of healthy adult donors. We identified a panel of antibodies that bound ZIKV DIII with high avidities ranging from low-nanoLar to subnanoLar and exhibited weak to moderate neutralizing potency. The most potent mAb, m301, broadly neutralized the American and Asian ZIKV strains circulating in the 2015\u20132016 outbreak. Combination of m301 with another mAb, m302, showed a synergistic effect in neutralizing ZIKV in vitro and in a mouse model of ZIKV infection. Interestingly, m301 and m302 bound adjacent regions of the DIII C\u2013C\u2032 loop, which represents a recently identified cryptic epitope according to the structure of the mature flavivirus virion. Though cryptic, this epitope is speculated to be intermittently exposed in an uncharacterized virus conformation. Further immunogenetic analysis suggests that m301 and m302 are germline-like antibodies with ~98% identity to the germline IGHV3\u201330 gene and that the fast and effective elicitation of such antibodies by immunization is promising. These results may be relevant for the understanding of antigenic epitopes of ZIKV antibodies, and the design of effective ZIKV vaccines and serodiagnostics.",

Panning protocols were essentially carried out as previously described.29 Briefly, one aliquot of each of the frozen library phage stocks was precipitated with 5% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000-NaCl (20% PEG8000, 2.5 M NaCl) and resuspended in PBS. The recombinant biotinylated ZIKV DIII-hFc fusion protein was used for panning of the libraries. For screening, 5 \u03bcg of biotinylated antigen was utilized in round 1, 4 \u03bcg was utilized in round 2, 2 \u03bcg was utilized in round 3, and 1 \u03bcg was utilized in round 4, followed by immobilization on streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA). Approximately 1 \u00d7 1012 phage particles were used for each bio-panning. Phages from the library were preblocked in 3% milk powder (w/v) in PBS (MPBS), incubated with the biotinylated antigen in 1% MPBS for 30 min, and then incubated with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads for 1.5 h. After washing with PBST (PBS buffer supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20), bound phages were used to infect mid-log phase Escherichia coli TG1 bacteria at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. Then, the TG1 bacteria were grown in 2 \u00d7 YT medium containing 100 \u03bcg/mL of ampicillin and 2% (w/v) glucose at 37 \u00b0C and 250 r/min. After 2 h, the cells were infected with 1 \u00d7 1012 VCSM13 helper phages for 45 min at room temperature. The infected cells were harvested and resuspended into 2 \u00d7 YT medium supplemented with 100 \u03bcg/mL of ampicillin and 100 \u03bcg/mL of kanamycin. Cells were then incubated overnight at 30 \u00b0C and 220 r/min. The phages were precipitated from culture supernatant with PEG-8000-NaCl and resuspended in sterile PBS until the next panning. The enrichment for antigen-specific phages after each round of panning was assessed by polyclonal phage enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Positive clones expressing Fab were identified from the third and fourth rounds of panning using monoclonal phage ELISA. The identified clones were analyzed and classified into different families based on their amino-acid sequence diversity in the complementarity-determining region (CDR) 3 region of the VH or VL gene.",

The equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of m301 for DIII was 0.2 nM with an on-rate (kon) of 2 \u00d7 105 per M per s and off-rate (koff) of 4 \u00d7 10\u22125 per s. The m303 mAb displayed a binding pattern similar to that of m301 with a KD of 0.15 nM. The m302 and m304 mAbs had much faster off-rates (koff 2 \u00d7 10\u22123 and 3 \u00d7 10\u22123 per s, respectively), and m302 had the slowest on-rate among the four mAbs (kon 4 \u00d7 104 per M per s). Consequently, m302 had a measured KD of 47 nM, and m304 had a KD of 4 nM. The m301 and m302 mAbs showed no binding to influenza HA protein (Figure 2B), which suggests that the m301 and m302 binding could be specific.",

Interestingly, the germline V-gene IGHV3-30 was frequently used by a number of human neutralizing mAbs isolated from individuals infected with flaviviruses, including West Nile virus,39 DENV,40 and ZIKV.41 To further investigate the IGHV3-30 recombination frequency with specific IGHD and IGHJ genes among other germlines, we analyzed in detail the deep sequencing data of our antibodyome studies on naive IgM repertoires of 33 healthy adult donors and neonatal IgM repertoires of 10 newborn babies (unpublished). As expected, we observed a high IGHV3-30 recombination frequency with various IGHD and IGHJ genes. Notably, 32 unique VH clones were successfully identified as sharing a VDJ recombination pattern similar to that of m301 (IGHV3-30, IGHD6, IGHJ4) (Supplementary Figure S2). Thirty-three unique clones related to m302 (IGHV3-30, IGHD7, IGHJ6) and 16 unique clones related to m304 (IGHV3-30, IGHD3, IGHJ3) were also identified (Supplementary Figures S3 and S4). In contrast, only seven unique clones were related to m303, the antibody that utilized the IGHV3-64D germline gene (Supplementary Figure S5). Taken together, these results suggest that the elicitation of these germline-like antibodies, especially the IGHV3-30 lineage m301- and m302-like antibodies, could be relatively quick and effective by immunization of ZIKV DIII-based immunogens.",

In comparison, m302 had modest neutralization activity, while m303 and m304 did not show any evident neutralization against ZIKV SZ01. To determine the breadth of neutralization of m301, we also tested its neutralizing activity against a panel of representative circulating ZIKV strains in addition to Asian lineage SZ01, including R103451 (Honduras strain), PRVABC59 (Puerto Rico strain), H/PAN/2015 (Panama strain), and FLR (Colombia strain). We found that the DIII of all these circulating strains is highly conserved, with only one mutation from the PRVABC59 strain (Supplementary Figure S6). Indeed, m301 was able to neutralize all these strains with similar potency, suggesting that m301 is a broadly neutralizing anti-ZIKV antibody (Figure 4B). The m301 mAb inhibited ZIKV infection in a dose-dependent manner with 2 \u03bcM resulting in ~57% neutralization by plaque reduction neutralization test, which was less effective than the control sera of mice immunized with recombinant ZIKV E glycoprotein (Figures 4B and 4C).

To test this hypothesis, we performed binding competition experiments using biolayer interferometry. The biosensors labeled with ZIKV DIII were saturated with a mAb analyte in solution, followed by the addition of a second mAb in the presence of the first antibody. As shown in Figures 5A\u20135D, m301 competed with m304 for binding to DIII, but not with mAbs m302 and m303. Neither m302 nor m303 showed any competition with the other three mAbs. Furthermore, m302 exhibited a much slower binding phase compared to the other three mAbs, which is consistent with its 10-fold lower kon value, as observed in the DIII binding assay (Figure 2). These data reveal three distinct epitopes on DIII. Although m301 and m304 may recognize overlapping epitopes, the much lower neutralizing activity of m304 could be attributed to its 20-fold lower DIII binding avidity. Taken together, these results suggest that m301 and m302 bind different epitopes on DIII and thus may have a synergistic effect in inhibiting ZIKV infection. Indeed, an enhancement in the neutralization of an antibody cocktail (m301 in combination with m302) was detected compared with that of either m301 or m302 alone at the same concentration, indicating a moderate synergistic effect of m301 and m302 on ZIKV neutralization (Figure 4D).",

The structure of m301 was generated by homology modeling based on the crystal structure of a human germline antibody sharing 97% amino-acid sequence identity with m301, while m302 was built based on another germline antibody with 93% sequence identity.34 The structures were energy-minimized in a water box and then docked onto the crystal structure of the ZIKV E protein DIII.25 Interestingly, we found that both m301 and m302 engaged the \u2018C\u2013C\u2032 loop\u2019 encompassed by C- and C\u2032-strands and their connecting loop, but in different directions and spatial locations (Figure 6A). As shown in Figure 6B, the epitopes of m301 and m302 on DIII were different, but mostly concentrated on the C\u2013C\u2032 loop (9 and 12 residues, respectively). This result explains the competitive binding between m301 and m302 on DIII, but relatively moderate synergistic effect when used in combination for ZIKV neutralization. Analysis of antibody contact residues indicates that m301 binding is dominated by light-chain CDR usage, whereas m302 primarily used heavy-chain CDRs engaging DIII.",

Therefore, it was hypothesized that the cryptic C\u2013C\u2032 loop epitope could be intermittently exposed in an uncharacterized virus conformation via a process named \u2018viral breathing\u2019. Through this process, antibodies targeting completely inaccessible epitopes on the mature virion can still neutralize flavivirus infection.43 Recently, mouse mAbs recognizing C\u2013C\u2032 loop epitopes were also identified after immunization with ZIKV.25 Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that m301 and m302 target an uncharacterized virion structure and moderately neutralize ZIKV via viral breathing.",

This was followed by daily monitoring for well-being (weight loss and other clinical manifestations) and mortality. In the first 6 days, mice in the antibody groups were significantly more active and healthier than mice in the control group. At day 7, all mice in the control group suffered from complete loss of mobility, while only two mice in the m301 group and one in the cocktail antibody group appeared to have signs of limb paralysis. All others appeared healthy. However, all mice died within 10 days in spite of the considerable difference in clinical manifestations between the antibody groups and control group (Figures 7A and 7B).

Similar to the previous challenge, 103 PFU of ZIKV also resulted in 100% mortality within 9 days (Figures 7C and 7D). One mouse from the control group died at day 7, and three more died at day 8 (33.3% survival). In comparison, three of six mice from the cocktail antibody group died at day 8 (50% survival). The remaining three mice did not show signs of limb paralysis, but they did exhibit reduced mobility, albeit to a lesser extent than the remaining two mice in the control group. The absence of significantly prolonged survival in the treatment groups could be attributed to the high sensitivity of the IFN-deficient mice to ZIKV infection. Residual virus load could also cause lethal infection in mice in the absence of complete neutralization of viruses by the anti-ZIKV mAbs. This interpretation is supported by a recent finding that even the lowest dose inoculum of 1 PFU of ZIKV virus resulted in 100% mortality.47 Interestingly, in one study, all mice receiving different doses of ZIKV (from 104 to 100 PFU) died at the same time point (100% mortality at day 8),47 which is consistent with our current findings. In another study, instead of using immune-deficient transgenic mice, the authors evaluated ZIKV-neutralizing mAbs in wild-type mice treated with an anti-IFN-\u03b1-receptor mAb, in which the mice exhibited less severe signs of disease and lower mortality compared to the IFN receptor knockout mice.25 A more dramatic difference between antibody groups and the control group would likely be observed in such a model.",

However, FLE is the immunodominant epitope in the ZIKV E protein, and most ZIKV-specific antibodies in infected patients were found to be FLE antibodies.27 It is therefore arduous to direct specific and potent immune responses to certain epitopes of DI/II without the elicitation of cross-reactive antibody-dependent enhancement antibodies.",

These mAbs specifically bound to three distinct epitopes on DIII and efficiently inhibited the infection of African, Asian, and American ZIKV strains. Furthermore, those mAbs targeting the DIII lateral ridge region conferred complete protection in ZIKV-infected mice.25 However, fully human mAbs with minimal immunogenicity in patients would be preferable. Except for isolating neutralizing antibodies from infected or vaccinated subjects, combinatorial antibody libraries and phage/yeast display-based technologies have revolutionized human antibody selection with high binding activity and novel properties.29 Herein, through bio-panning of a human Fab library with ZIKV DIII, we successfully selected and characterized a panel of novel germline-like human mAbs with high affinity and specificity against ZIKV DIII. This is the first study to use a phage display screen to identify human antibodies against ZIKV. The four mAbs (m301\u2013m304) recognized three distinct epitopes on DIII and displayed functionally different properties. Since germline mAbs typically exhibit good druggability and low to no immunogenicity, these antibodies, especially the most potent neutralizing mAb, m301, have the potential for further development as antibody-based therapeutics, either alone or in combination with other DIII- or E protein-targeting human mAbs.",

We previously found that IGHV1-69 allele-specific residues, for example, Phe54 in HCDR2 and Lys73 in FR3, are critical for antigen binding and virus neutralization.35 Further structural studies are warranted to explore whether allele-specific residues contribute to the binding of IGHV3-30-encoded antibodies to flavivirus E proteins.",

E protein DIII was once considered to be the antigen of choice for vaccine development.53, 54 However, in a number of studies, it was found that the use of recombinant flavivirus DIII as subunit vaccines only elicited poorly neutralizing antibodies targeting the AB loop of DIII.19, 55 These findings suggested that the human antibody repertoire against flaviviruses may actually be directed away from these DIII-neutralizing epitopes, especially an epitope on the lateral ridge region of DIII recognized by many of the strongest flavivirus-neutralizing antibodies.56 Therefore, DIII subunit vaccines are not among the leading candidates (and recently approved) for dengue vaccines, nor are they prominent among platforms leading the way for ZIKV vaccine design.11, 57, 58 Our results indicate that antibodies targeting the cryptic C\u2013C\u2032 loop are inherently less protective against ZIKV infection in vitro and in vivo than previously described potent neutralizing antibodies targeting the upper lateral surface of DIII. Although the binding affinities were very high, the neutralizing activities were low. Consistent with low neutralizing activities, these antibodies have only modest protection in mouse models. These results suggest that such antibodies targeting the cryptic epitope on DIII of the ZIKV E protein are probably not suitable as therapeutic agents against ZIKV. As human antibodies targeting the C\u2013C\u2032 loop also exist in ZIKV-infected patients, a current priority is to understand whether such novel antibodies contribute to protective immunity in vivo, followed by translating this information into the design of more effective DIII-based vaccine candidates.",
