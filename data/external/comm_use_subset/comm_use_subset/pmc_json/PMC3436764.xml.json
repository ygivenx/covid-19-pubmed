These respiratory infections maybe caused by a wide range of microorganisms. Approximately 80% of cases are viral [3]. Some common viruses responsible for respiratory infections include Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), human Rhinovirus (hRV), human Enterovirus (hEV), Influenza A Virus (IAV), Influenza B Virus (IBV), human Metapneumovirus (hMPV), Coronavirus (CoV), Parainfluenza Virus (PIV), Adenovirus (AdV), and human Bocavirus (hBoV) [4]\u2013[9]. The similar clinical presentations of patients infected by various respiratory viruses make etiological diagnoses difficult when doctors simply make decisions based only on physical symptoms [10]\u2013[12]. This can lead to the misuse of drugs, i.e. oseltamivir and amantadine are two effective drugs used to treat IAV infections but have no effect on URTIs caused by other respiratory viruses.",

This is one important reason for the over-prescription of unnecessary antibiotics to children presenting with fever in pediatric hospitals in Shanghai. With support from the Chinese Key SciTech Programme for Infection Control (under The Eleventh Five-year Framework), our laboratory began a pilot program to monitor virus pathogens responsible for URTIs symptoms in Shanghai. We adapted a VRDAL method for this surveillance pilot program based on a previously published paper by Australian scientists [16]. This multiplex RT-PCR method can detect 10 viruses at the same time, but cannot differentiate between hRV and hEV, PIV-1 from PIV-3, or RSV A from RSV B. The Seeplex\u00ae Respiratory Virus Detection assay (SeeGene Inc., Seoul, Korea) was introduced to the respiratory research community in 2007 and can efficiently differentiate 15 respiratory viruses [5]. Thus, the Seeplex\u00ae RV15 ACE Detection kit was also used to assess the virus profiles.",

We randomly select average of three patients from the hospital to take part in the respiratory virus surveillance program based on their hospital registration number per week.

Three groups of reactions were performed for each sample. Group 1 included reactions for IAV, IBV, and AdV. Group 2 included reactions for RSV A/B and picornaviridae (with primers specific for all enterovirus and rhinovirus). Group 3 included reactions for PIV1-3. Internal positive control of BVDV and negative control of nuclease-free water were included in each group of reactions. Primers used for first and second round PCR amplifications are referred in original paper [16]. Subtyping of hEV, hRV, and PIV depends on the sequencing results from acquired PCR products. For the first round amplification, 2.5 \u00b5L cDNA was added to a 22 \u00b5L master mixture containing 500 nmol first round primers (100 nmol for picornavirus), 25 mmol MgCl2, 2.0 mmol dNTPs, and 0.3 U Hotstar\u00ae Taq polymerase (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). The PCR reaction protocol included a 15 min denaturation step at 94\u00b0C, then 35 cycles of 30 s at 94\u00b0C, 30 s annealing at 55\u00b0C, and 60 s extension at 72\u00b0C, then a final elongation step at 72\u00b0C for 7 min. For the second round amplification, 1 \u00b5L of each product from the first round was transferred to a freshly prepared master mixture containing primers for second round reactions. PCR conditions were the same as used in first round reactions. Final PCR products were separated by 30 min electrophoresis (10 V/cm) on a 2% agarose gel prestained with ethidium bromide.",

In addition to those viruses not covered by VRDAL (PIV4, hBoV, CoV and hMPV), the Seeplex\u00ae RV15 assay showed 40% higher sensitivity for detection of IAV, PIV1-3, IAV, AdV, and RSV A/B. For example, Seeplex\u00ae RV15 yielded a 8.5% infection rate for AdV compared to 6.1% by VRDAL. Since VRDAL requires a two round amplification procedure, whilst Seeplex\u00ae RV15 is performed using only one round, the improvement in sensitivity is attributed to a better primer design strategy adopted by Seeplex\u00ae RV15 assay as dual-priming oligonucleotide system.",

For other viruses, in concordance with other studies, hEV was most frequently isolated in summer, while RSV A/B was most frequently observed in winter, hRV in fall, and PIV1\u20134 in springs. The IAV/IBV virus showed two peaks in seasonal distribution in Shanghai, a city with a temperate climate. This pattern was different from more northern cities like Beijing. Thus, more accurate forecasting of seasonal epidemic viruses could help healthcare professionals better prepare for combating respiratory infections in children. Since hRV and hEV showed different seasonal distribution patterns, Seeplex\u00ae multiplex PCR may be superior over the VRDAL PCR method, which can differentiate between hRV and hEV and so as to correctly detect seasonal changes in respiratory virus distribution.",
