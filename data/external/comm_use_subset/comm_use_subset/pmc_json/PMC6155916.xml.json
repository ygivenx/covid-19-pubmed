Trypsin inhibitory activity was located in fraction D2. When fraction D2 was subjected to affinity chromatography on Affi-gel blue gel, the activity was recovered in the larger unadsorbed fraction B1 (data not shown). Upon ion exchange chromatography on SP-sepharose, fraction B1 was resolved into a small unadsorbed fraction S1 and two large adsorbed fractions (S2 and S3) of approximately equal size. Activity resided in fraction S2. Further purification of S2 on Superdex 75 yielded two fractions, SU1 and SU2. Only fraction SU2 exhibited trypsin inhibitory activity. SU2 was the purified trypsin inhibitor (GBTI). The yields of the various chromatographic fractions are presented in Table 1. The N-terminal sequence of the trypsin inhibitor is shown in Table 2. GBTI exhibited a molecular mass of 17.5 kDa in both sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and gel filtration (Figure 1). Its trypsin inhibitor activity remained unchanged in the temperature range 20\u201380 \u00b0C, was reduced by 60% at 90 \u00b0C, and, was totally abolished after exposure to 100 \u00b0C.",

Some of the legume trypsin inhibitors, for instance, field bean trypsin inhibitors, inhibit in vitro proliferation of cancer cells and metastasis in vivo [20,21]. Gold bean trypsin inhibitor is dissimilar from broad bean trypsin inhibitor [9] in that the former lacks HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitory activity. The lack of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitory activity in gold bean trypsin inhibitor is similar to the findings on lily bulb trypsin inhibitor [22]. Gold bean trypsin inhibitor is also devoid of any inhibitory effect on HIV-1 integrase and SARS coronavirus proteinase. The absence of antifungal activity in gold bean trypsin inhibitor is also in agreement with the observation on some trypsin inhibitors, such as lily bulb trypsin inhibitor [22]. The results demonstrate that HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitory and antifungal activities of trypsin inhibitors have structural requirements different from those of trypsin inhibitory activity.",

The assay takes advantage of the ability of reverse transcriptase to synthesize DNA, starting from the template/primer hybrid poly (A) oligo (dT) 15. The digoxigenin- and biotin-labeled nucleotides in an optimized ratio are incorporated into one of the same DNA molecule, which is freshly synthesized by the reverse transcriptase (RT). The detection and quantification of synthesized DNA as a parameter for RT activity follows a sandwich ELISA protocol. Biotin-labeled DNA binds to the surface of microtiter plate modules that have been pre-coated with strepatavidin. In the next step, an antibody to digoxigenin, conjugated to peroxidase enzyme, binds to the digoxigenin-labeled DNA. In the final step, the peroxidase substrate is added. The peroxidase enzyme catalyzes the cleavage of the substrate, producing a colored reaction product. The absorbance of the sample at 405 nm can be determined using a microtiter plate (ELISA) reader and is directly correlated to the level of RT activity. A fixed amount (4\u20136 ng) of recombinant HIV-1 reverse transcriptase was used. The inhibitory activity of the protein was calculated as percent inhibition compared to a control without the protein [15]. The positive control used was kale antifungal peptide.",

The pellet was homogenized in 50 mL buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 M NaCl, 2 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol) containing 5 mM imidazole. The suspension was rotated at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h, and cleared by centrifugation at 40,000\u00d7 g at 4 \u00b0C for 20 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a 1-mL chelating Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) charged with 50 mM NiSO4 and was equilibrated with buffer A containing 50 mM imidazole. The column was washed with five column volumes of buffer A containing 5 mM imidazole, and the protein was eluted with three column volumes of buffer A containing 200 and 400 mM imidazole, respectively. Protein containing fractions were pooled, and EDTA was added to a final concentration of 5 mM. The protein was dialyzed against buffer B (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 M NaCl, 20% glycerol) containing 2 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, and then against buffer B containing 1 mM dithiothreitol. Aliquots of the protein were stored at \u221270 \u00b0C [19].",

After the integrase reaction, the biotinylated DNA immobilized on the wells was detected by incubation with streptavidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer-Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany), followed by colorimetric detection with 1 mg/mL p-nitrophenyl phosphate in 10% diethanolamine buffer (pH 9.8) containing 0.5 mM MgCl2. The absorbance due to the alkaline phosphatase reaction was measured at 415 nm. The ribosome inactivating protein luffin was used as a positive control [16].",
