The results suggest that RNA-folding in the cell has evolved strategies that help promote the formation of correct structure. They further suggest the direction we need to pursue to achieve better thermodynamic models of RNA. Finally, polymer-solvent effects are predicted for the first time in computational programs of this kind.",

Perhaps developing a more detailed approach to analyzing the local structure and fine tuning of the parameterizations will favor the reported structure.

However, the Flory model [20] and/or the McKenzie-Moore-Domb-Fisher model (Ref. [13]) becomes important for long compact functional RNA structures where polymer-solvent interactions begin to dominate. In Fig. 2b, the structure is fitted using \u03b4 = 1.4, \u03b3 = 1.5 and default parameters for the effective Flory model. The parameter \u03b4 reflects the extent or weight of the correlation in the polymer chain: a large value for \u03b4 indicates that the memory of the previous monomer dies off very rapidly and a small value suggests that the information persists in the structure over a much longer distance. The default parameter is \u03b4 = 2 (the Gaussian distribution). The parameter \u03b3 scales the volume occupied by a polymer in accordance with a self avoiding random walk [13]. This suggests that long sequences with extended interactions also tend to have more correlation over the entire sequence and the dimensionality may be slightly reduced. Many of these structures fold correctly with a variety of parameter values, but long sequences appear to favor smaller values for \u03b4, and \u03b3.",

For a typical Kuhn length of 7 or 8 nt, the structure takes a form shown in Fig. 3a. This occurs for many of these sequences. The reported structure is obtained when we force open the large loop structure shown in Fig. 3b\n[21].When forced in this way, the structure in Fig. 3b appears to be the minimum free energy. The free energy difference between the two structures is approximately 7 kcal/mol (at 37\u00b0C). The reported activation barrier for the two conformations is \u0394H = 12 kcal/mol [21]. Including the entropy contribution from the model, this is approximately the correct order of magnitude. Therefore, this would suggest that in the fast quenching preparation that was used, obtaining a distribution of RNA structures ranging 7 kcal/mol is not unusual. The ribosome may provide a major part of the binding interaction. Since vsfold5 only predicts the minimum free energy in normal operation, for this structure, only results like Fig. 3a are expected (for Kuhn length around 7 nt or greater).",

The unique features of this model are the mapping, its folding strategy, and its ability to explore the role of polymer swelling and globular structure formation within the context of RNA structure. The approach shows that it is possible to develop a calculation approach that accounts for long range interactions and permits the development of modules to address them. Further, if the time window is seen as a progressive process of updating the 3\u2032 end with the new structure, the behavior is consistent with the hierarchical folding hypothesis [25] and the contact order model [26]\u2013[28]. Very complex secondary structures can be built if the components of the structure can be explained in terms of some recognizable folding pathway.",

Two buffers are built up: one that contains the current structure and tests for new secondary structure at the current sequence position and another that tests for pseudoknots on that same structure and sequence. The buffers compete with each other and the minimum free energy is selected from the best result: whether secondary structure or pseudoknot. As a result, the structure that is predicted is the minimum free energy for a given sequence fragment with a given persistence length, temperature and solvent condition.",

These have also been referred to as ABACBC PKs, but like the core PKs, extended PKs can be embellished to any extent required (Text S2). A domain of RNA structure consists of a RNA sequence fragment that forms a stable isolated secondary structure independent of the remaining sequence on the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 sides of the domain. In this respect, the fragment can be snipped out and folded without major changes happening to the structure. An example of such a domain is shown in Fig. 4b where domain 1 and domain 2 could be snipped out of the sequence and each structure would persist unaffected. When a pseudoknot joins these independent domains, the entire complex becomes a single domain (Fig. 4b). The approach for extended PKs assumes that evolution has selected domains that are stable when formed during the folding process and do not change significantly even with the addition of pseudoknot interactions. This is shown schematically in Fig. 4b and is consistent with the hierarchical folding hypothesis [25]. A pseudoknot becomes part of a subdomain when it is incorporated into other secondary structure (Fig. 4c).",
