National statistics tend to underestimate the incidence of infectious gastrointestinal disease, as many cases are not notified, so the true incidence will be higher [5].",

Symptoms usually resolve in one to two weeks, with oocysts being excreted for an additional one to four weeks. Chronic infections may occur due to the oocysts\u2019 ability to excyst in the intestinal tract, and cause autoinfection [9]. Infection can lead to prolonged or life-threatening illness in immunocompromised patients [11]. The pathophysiological mechanism causing the diarrhoea is unclear, but is thought to be the result of direct mucosal damage by the parasite or an enterotoxin [12].",

Zoonotic transmission is considered the most common route of infection of C. parvum for humans and is an important occupational risk for people working with livestock. Outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis have previously been reported among veterinary students as a result of direct or indirect contact with farm animals and through anthroponotic transmission [10,11,14,15,16]. These outbreak events highlight the need for stringent prevention and control procedures. An outbreak of cryptosporidiosis occurred at Massey University in 2006 with 25/80 (31%) respondents developing clinical signs from a cohort of 96 veterinary science students. Investigation at the time suggested that contact with apparently healthy calves during a practical class was the most likely exposure [17]. This paper describes the investigation of an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis among veterinary science and veterinary technology students at Massey University over an eight-week period during the spring-calving period in 2013.",

There were also calves with other health problems, sheep, alpacas, and a pig that the students would have been in contact with. An aetiological diagnosis was not reached for all of the calves with diarrhoea due to cost constraints, the fact that it would make no difference to treatment protocol, and because most of these calves came from two farms and it was assumed that the causative agent would likely be the same in all calves from the same property. Faecal samples from eight calves were submitted to the local veterinary diagnostic laboratory for testing; a sample from one calf cultured Salmonella spp. and the remaining seven were found to contain Cryptosporidium oocysts, with four of these also being positive for rotavirus antigen.

Seven of the students were confirmed as suffering from cryptosporidiosis. Furthermore, the subtype from the one human isolate that was genotyped, C. parvum subtype IIa A18G3R1, is the most common subtype in calves [20,21]. Other outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis among veterinary students have been linked to contact with calves [11,17]. The seasonal pattern of an increase of cases of cryptosporidiosis in humans in New Zealand coinciding with the calving and lambing seasons [22] provides further evidence that contact with neonatal livestock is a significant risk factor for disease in people. These findings constitute a significant occupational health and safety concern for people in contact with infected animals.",

In fact, it is almost an annual occurrence during the calving season, despite ever-increasing hygiene measures and student education about zoonoses. Anecdotally, the attitude of veterinary students at Massey University towards zoonotic infections is changing. Previously, being affected by enteritis was seen almost as a rite of passage, whereas now students are more concerned with preventing infection. A variety of strategies have been implemented to reduce human cases of cryptosporidiosis including: demonstrations in class on the correct use of personal protective equipment (PPE), provision of case studies and personal stories of students who have experienced cryptosporidiosis which emphasise how unpleasant the symptoms can be, increased signage in the large animal hospital about the risks of zoonotic disease, more hand and boot-washing stations provided in the large animal hospital, and more hand sanitisers mounted within the veterinary teaching hospital. Most recently, gates have been installed in the farm animal corridor of the large animal hospital to further limit access to the patients, and sets of boots and waterproof bib-over-trousers that stay within the large animal hospital have been provided rather than students using their own PPE and attempting to disinfect it. All of these strategies can be implemented to minimise zoonotic transmission throughout veterinary education but are particularly important in the control of cryptosporidiosis due to the low infectious dose, the resistance of oocysts in the environment, and the risk of indirect contact with infectious material. The provision of keyboard covers in student computer laboratories has also been considered as a means of limiting transmission, but these would need to be regularly wiped down, as would door handles and other surfaces, so most effort has gone into preventing the movement of infectious material from the large animal hospital. Another approach to safeguard student health would be to limit the involvement that veterinary students have with sick calves, however, this approach must be balanced with the value of clinical experience in producing practice-ready new graduates.",

This finding suggests that instruction to this group of students could be more intensive and practical which would allow them the opportunity to acquire more skills by the time they have contact with possibly infected animals.
