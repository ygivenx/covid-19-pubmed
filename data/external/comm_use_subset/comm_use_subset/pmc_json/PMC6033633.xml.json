In EAE, CD4+ and CD8+ T\u2010cells specific for self\u2010antigens expressed in CNS myelin initiate a localized inflammatory process that results in demyelination, axonopathy, and clinical deficits 4, 5, 6. The concept that the adaptive immune response is critical for new lesion development and disease progression in MS is emphasized in that FDA\u2010approved disease modifying therapies are designed to limit infiltration of encephalitogenic lymphocytes into the CNS 7. Among the mechanisms by which myelin\u2010reactive CD4+ T\u2010cells contribute to disease is through localized secretion of cytokines, e.g. IL\u201017 that increases expression of chemokines that attract myeloid cells into the CNS 8. Monocytes and macrophages amplify white matter damage through active stripping of the myelin sheath leading to axonal damage, presentation of novel myelin epitopes to T cells and amplifying neuroinflammation through secretion of proinflammatory molecules. In addition, IL\u201017 secretion increases expression of the neutrophil chemoattractants CXCL1 and CXCL2 resulting in recruitment and accumulation of these cells within the CNS 9.",

In patients with relapsing\u2010remitting MS, there are elevated systemic levels of neutrophil\u2010activating chemokines including CXCL1, CXCL5, and neutrophil elastase accompanied by increased numbers of neutrophils having a primed phenotype 10, 12.

To overcome some of these limitations, we have derived a transgenic mouse whereby expression of CXCL1 is under the control of a tetracycline\u2010inducible promoter that is active within glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)\u2010positive astrocytes 21. Recent studies have emphasized an important role for CXCL1 and it is receptor CXCR2 during the effector phase of EAE 9, 22, 23, 24. Although resident cells of the CNS including microglia and endothelial cells express CXCL1 24, 25, astrocytes have been shown to express CXCL1 in EAE as well as in MS lesions 26, 27, 28 and this informed our decision to select astrocytes as our target cell for ectopic expression of CXCL1. Our present study was undertaken to better understand how elevated and sustained neutrophil recruitment into the CNS impacts EAE disease progression and white matter damage. Our findings indicate that increased expression of CXCL1 within the CNS results in more severe EAE as measured by both clinical disease and demyelination. The CXCL1\u2010mediated disease enhancement was not dependent on an increase in myelin\u2010reactive Th1 or Th17 cells but correlated with increased numbers of neutrophil infiltration into the spinal cord. Indeed, depletion of neutrophils resulted in a reduction in the severity of white matter damage highlighting a role for these cells in demyelination.",

The accumulation of neutrophils in the CNS is rapid yet transient and reflects the expression kinetics of CXCL1 and CXCL2. To better understand how neutrophil infiltration impacts demyelination and disease progression in EAE, transgenic (tg) mice were engineered to express CXCL1 within GFAP\u2010positive astrocytes upon doxycycline administration, as previous studies have shown these cells to be the primary source of CXCL1 in models of neuroinflammation 29, 30. Doxycyline (Dox) responsive double tg mice (pBI\u2010CXCL1\u2010rtTA) or single tg controls lacking the reverse tetracycline transactivator (rtTA) were immunized with MOG35\u201355 peptide and treated daily with Dox (50 mg/kg) i.p. between days 9 through 19 postimmunization (Fig. 1A). Onset of clinical disease was similar between Dox\u2010treated double tg and single tg mice (day 9 p.i.), but double tg mice exhibited a significant increase in clinical disease severity compared to single tg mice (Fig. 1B). Examination of mRNA transcripts encoding proinflammatory chemokines/cytokines indicated a selective >twofold increase in CXCL1 in Dox\u2010treated double tg mice versus single tg mice at day 12 postimmunization that represents a time in which there is a separation in clinical disease between double and single tg mice following MOG35\u201355 immunization. No differences in expression of transcripts encoding CXCL2, CXCL10, CCL2, CCL5, IFN\u2010\u03b3, and IL\u201017A at day 12 between Dox\u2010treated double tg and single tg mice were observed (Fig. 1C). A significant (p < 0.05) increase in CXCL1 protein was detected only in the spinal cord (Fig. 1E) and not in the serum (Fig. 1D) of double tg mice 12 days postimmunization compared to single tg controls. Notably, we also observed a significant (p < 0.05) increase in CXCL1 protein within the spinal cords of Dox\u2010treated na\u00efve mice in which EAE was not induced indicating that disease induction did not selectively enhance transgene expression (Fig. 1E). We did not detect differences in proteins levels of G\u2010CSF, GM\u2010CSF, or IL\u201017 (data not shown) either prior to or following Dox treatment of double tg or single tg EAE mice. Immunofluorescence staining confirmed astrocytes (GFAP+) as the primary cellular source of CXCL1 in Dox\u2010treated double tg EAE mice (Fig. 1F). Together, these findings indicate that CXCL1 expression was specifically elevated in the CNS of Dox\u2010treated double tg mice that correlated with an increase in clinical disease.",

We determined if overexpression of CXCL1 in the CNS of Dox\u2010treated double tg mice immunized with MOG35\u201355 peptide altered the infiltration of inflammatory leukocytes into the CNS. We did not detect differences in the frequency or numbers of CD45hi leukocytes (data not shown), CD4+ T cells (Fig. 2A and B), or CD8+ T cells (Fig. 2C and D) in spinal cords of Dox\u2010treated double tg mice compared to single tg mice. Moreover, there was no difference in intracellular CD4+ T\u2010cell cytokine expression of IFN\u2010\u03b3, IL\u201017A, or coexpressing IFN\u2010\u03b3 and IL\u201017A within the spinal cords at day 12 p.i. following PMA/ionomycin stimulation (Fig. 2E and F).

We next investigated whether Dox\u2010induced overexpression of CXCL1 promotes neutrophil accumulation in double tg mice induced with EAE. Histopathologic examination of spinal cord sections revealed increased localization of inflammatory cells in the anterior median fissure and meninges of the spinal cords of Dox\u2010treated double tg mice compared to single tg EAE mice (Fig. 4A). The majority of inflammatory cells within spinal cords of double tg mice had a multilobed nucleus characteristic of neutrophils (Fig. 4B). Immunofluorescence staining revealed increased numbers of cells positive for the neutrophil\u2010associated surface antigen Ly6B.2 within the spinal cords of Dox\u2010treated double tg EAE mice compared to single tg mice treated with Dox (Fig. 4C). In addition, flow analysis of spinal cords isolated from experimental mice indicated the frequency and numbers of neutrophils (CD45hiCD11b+Ly6G+) within the spinal cords of Dox\u2010treated double tg mice were significantly (p < 0.01) increased compared to single tg mice (Fig. 4D and E). Importantly, we did not observe an increase in Ly6C+ monocytes in either brain or spinal cords of double tg mice treated with Dox (data not shown). Together, these findings argue that the Dox\u2010induced increase in CXCL1 expression within the CNS enhances the recruitment and accumulation of neutrophils within the spinal cords associated increased clinical disease severity. Using a model of viral\u2010induced demyelination, we have previously shown that Dox\u2010induced CXCL1 expression within the CNS increases the severity of white matter damage and this was correlated with enhanced neutrophil recruitment into the spinal cord 21. Assessment of spinal cord pathology between Dox\u2010treated single tg and double tg mice was assessed using H&E/LFB staining at day 21 p.i. (Fig. 4F). We recorded an increase in both meningeal infiltration (p < 0.05) and demyelination (p < 0.05) of double tg compared to single tg was observed (Fig. 4G).",

Administration of anti\u2010CXCR2 antisera to Dox\u2010treated double tg mice resulted in a dramatic reduction in clinical disease severity compared to animals treated with NRS alone (Fig. 5B) and this was correlated with reduced numbers of circulating CD45hiCD11b+Ly6C+Ly6G+ neutrophils (Fig. 5C). The reduction in clinical disease in Dox\u2010treated double tg mice treated with anti\u2010CXCR2 correlated with a significant (p < 0.01) reduction in the severity of demyelination compared to NRS\u2010treated mice (Fig. 5D and E) and this was associated with reduced numbers of neutrophils present within the spinal cords (Fig. 5F and G). Together, these findings indicate that neutrophils can enhance the severity of demyelination in MOG35\u201355\u2010induced EAE.",

The importance of these cells to disease is highlighted in that FDA\u2010approved disease modifying therapies used in treatment of relapsing remitting MS limit immune cell infiltration and lesion development 34, 35. Nonetheless, there is increasing interest in the potential role of other cell types, including neutrophils, in participating in demyelination. The diverse functions of neutrophils include phagocytosis, release of toxic granules, and secretion of ROS, nitrogen species, and neutrophil extracellular traps that can lead to bacterial clearance and tissue damage 36, 37, 38, 39. In addition, neutrophils can produce many different cytokines and chemokines that participate in tailoring the immune response as well as enhancing neuroinflammation 36, 37, 38, 39. Although there is direct evidence that neutrophils are important in both disease initiation and progression in EAE models only indirect evidence exists showing these cells also play a role in MS pathogenesis 40. Since neutrophils are typically short\u2010lived and have a half\u2010life in circulation (between 6 and 8 hours in humans) 41, direct evidence of neutrophils in MS lesions from available autopsy tissue samples has been limited. Nonetheless, recent studies from Segal and colleagues 12 have demonstrated increased systemic levels of the chemokines CXCL1 and CXCL5 as well as neutrophil elastase that correlated with lesion burden and clinical disability in MS patients arguing for a role for neutrophils in augmenting disease.",

            "text": "The current study was performed to better understand the functional role of CXCL1 within the CNS following induction of MOG35\u201355 immunized EAE in mice. CXCL1 is a member of the ELR (+) family of CXC chemokines and binds with high affinity to the chemokine receptor CXCR2 11, 42. Neutrophils express CXCR2 and signaling enhances egress out of the BM and aids in homing to sites of inflammation 36. In the context of EAE, CXCL1 is detected early in the CNS 24 both prior to and following disease onset 12. Mice treated with anti\u2010CXCL1 blocking antibody showed a delayed onset of disease and decreased clinical disease correlating with diminished numbers of Ly6G+ neutrophils yet CNS T\u2010cell infiltration was not affected arguing for a role for neutrophils in disease 24. Similarly, a better understanding of molecules, e.g. CXCL1 that influence neutrophil accumulation within the CNS also allows insight into the therapeutic relevance of these potential targets. Lira et al. 43 have previously shown that transgenic mice in which CXCL1 was constitutively expressed from oligodendrocytes led to the development of neurologic disease associated with microglia and astrocyte reactivity that correlated with increase in neutrophil accumulation within the brain. Using the animals described in this study in which transgenic Cxcl1 is selectively expressed in astrocytes upon Doxycycline treatment, we recently showed that increased and sustained expression of CXCL1 was associated with increased clinical disease and demyelination in animals infected with the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) 21. Enhanced clinical and histologic disease correlated with a dramatic increase in neutrophil infiltration into the CNS; targeted ablation of neutrophils resulted in a reduction in the severity of demyelination further supporting an important role for neutrophils in augmenting white matter damage 21.",

            "text": "Using this transgenic mouse in which CXCL1 expression is selectively induced within astrocytes allows for an increased understanding of how neutrophils may augment neuroinflammation and demyelination in EAE. Similar to our previous report using JHMV infection of CXCL1 double transgenic mice 21, we found that Dox administration resulted in elevated CXCL1 transgene expression within the brains and spinal cords of double tg mice that was restricted to astrocytes and correlated with rapid and robust neutrophil migration to the CNS compared to Dox\u2010treated controls. As a result of CXCL1 transgene expression, MOG35\u201355\u2010immunized double tg mice displayed sustained increase in clinical disease severity. Increased accumulation of neutrophils in the CNS did not affect the expression of proinflammatory factors that could potentially attract inflammatory leukocytes and/or increase numbers of resident glial cells. Indeed, we observed no statistical difference in the frequencies or numbers of either activated macrophages or microglia expressing MHC class II and CD80 between Dox\u2010treated double tg and single tg mice. Furthermore, we did not detect any increase in either frequency or numbers of CNS inflammatory CD4+ or CD8+ T cells in Dox\u2010treated double tg mice compared to Dox\u2010treated single tg mice. In addition, there were no differences in the expression of IFN\u2010\u03b3 and/or IL\u201017A by CD4+ T\u2010cells between Dox\u2010treated double and single tg mice. Collectively, these findings indicate that the increase in MOG35\u201355\u2010induced clinical disease upon Dox\u2010induced CXCL1 expression is not the result of increased infiltration/activation of either macrophages/microglia or T cells. Of additional interest is our observation that Dox\u2010treatment of na\u00efve double tg mice resulted in increased expression of CXCL1 within the CNS and these findings argue that induction of EAE is dispensable in terms increased expression of this transgene. Ongoing studies in our laboratory are determining if sustained CXCL1 expression within the CNS is sufficient to contribute to demyelination mediated by neutrophil accumulation in the absence of MOG35\u201355 immunization.",

            "text": "In contrast with our findings, Omari et al. 44 demonstrated that overexpression of CXCL1 by astrocytes protected animals from EAE by limiting neuroinflammation as well as increasing numbers of oligodendrocytes associated with enhanced remyelination. This difference in results most likely reflects that the Cxcl1 transgene employed in our study was lacking the 3\u2019 UTR resulting in an increase in the half\u2010life of CXCL1 mRNA and therefore sustained CXCL1 production and subsequently neutrophil accumulation whereas Omari et al. was using a transgene containing the 3\u2019UTR and nonsustained expression of CXCL1 44. We do not believe CXCL1 had any direct cytotoxic activity on oligodendroglia as we have previous shown that treatment of differentiating mouse oligodendrocyte progenitor cells with recombinant CXCL1 does not kill these cells 45. Rather, our findings argue that increased white matter damage is associated with a selective increase in neutrophil accumulation within the CNS and this is consistent with earlier studies from our laboratory using the CXCL1 transgenic animals in a model of viral\u2010induced neurologic disease 21. Although recent studies suggest that Ly\u20106C+ myeloid precursor cells play a pathogenic role during autoimmune demyelination 46, our findings reveal that the increase in tissue damage was not the result of enhanced migration of these cells to the CNS of Dox\u2010treated double tg mice when compared to single tg mice. Molecules that neutrophils are known to possess that potentially could impact cell survival include neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G, and matrix metalloproteinases 39. Indeed, neutrophils have clearly been shown to exacerbate brain injury in a model of focal cerebral ischemia 47. Blocking neutrophil trafficking to the CNS or inhibition of the NAPDH complex in mouse models of ischemic injury results in a dramatic reduction in both the vascular endothelium and brain parenchyma 47, 48. Moreover, both the generation of ROS and nitric oxide is thought to contribute to vascular damage as well as impact axonal integrity and oligodendrocyte viability 49, 50. Neutrophils are also implicated in exacerbating lesion development within spinal cords on patients with neuromyelitis optica (NMO) 51, and inhibition of neutrophil elastase, a serine protease released from the primary granules of neutrophils, within mouse models of NMO resulted in reduced neuroinflammation and myelin loss 52, 53. Within the EAE model of chronic neurologic disease, neutrophils have recently been reported to have a role in maturating local APCs within the CNS thus potentially contributing to increased disease severity by increasing numbers of autoreactive T cells 54. However, we believe it unlikely that the increase in disease severity is the result of enhanced macrophages presenting antigen as we determined there was no increase in either activated macrophage or microglia in the CNS of Dox\u2010treated double tg mice nor were there increases in either Th1 and/or Th17 CD4+ T\u2010cell responses.",
