            "text": "Sphingolipids, which are an integral part of membranes in all eukaryotic cells, have been involved in a variety of cell signalling functions [1]. One of these signalling sphingolipids is sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) which has well-known critical roles in cell growth and development [2] and T-lymphocyte recruitment [3]. This latter property has drawn considerable recent attention and has led to the clinical use of S1P analogues in the treatment of diseases such as multiple sclerosis [4]. S1P is a normal metabolite produced following the phosphorylation of sphingosine by the sphingosine kinases (SKs) which can play an important role in cell signalling and inflammation [5]. For example, a recent study by Harikumar et al., showed that SK1 was required for interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1- mediated induction of CXCL10 and CCL5 chemokines following interleukin 1 (IL-1) stimulation [6]. There are two forms of SK, designated SK1 and SK2 [7]. Both isozymes show a high degree of sequence similarity although they vary in size, catalytic properties, tissue distribution, and subcellular localisation [8], and have been proposed to have complementing but also distinct physiological roles [1, 9].",

            "text": "A role for SK1 during viral infections is emerging, as we have recently reviewed [10]. Several viruses have been shown to modulate the activity or level of SK1 for efficient viral infection. For instance, bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) reduced the catalytic activity of SK1 to promote viral replication [11]. In contrast, an increase of SK1 expression and activity during human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) [12], influenza A virus [13], and measles virus (MV) [14] infections enhanced viral replication. Moreover, SK1 can promote viral infections through different biological mechanisms. SK1 has been shown to prolong survival of virus-infected cells [12], and viral protein synthesis [14]. We have previously shown that SK1 activity is altered during dengue virus (DENV) infection [15, 16], and that a reduction in SK1 affects the ability of DENV to induce interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in vitro [17]. Here, we investigated the effect of SK1 on DENV replication and the induction of ISGs using an in vivo model comprising intracranial (ic) injection of DENV.",

            "text": "DENV is a globally important human pathogen that can cause a wide spectrum of clinical presentations from a febrile illness to a life threatening infection with bleeding complications [18]. The disease severity and pathogenicity is thought to be immune-mediated in which immune responses to DENV exacerbate damage to the host [19\u201321]. Unlike DENV-infection in humans, DENV does not replicate well or cause symptoms reflective of human disease in immunocompetent wild type (WT) mice [22], but can cause a similar pathology in mice deficient in the interferon (IFN) response, such as in the AG129 IFN receptor knockout mouse model [23]. Analysis of neurovirulence\u2014the induction of symptoms of brain infection including reduction in hind limb function has been a widely used historical method to indicate the presence of virus following ic inoculation. Ic injection of DENV into WT mice, although not reflective of a natural mode of DENV-infection, is associated with DENV replication and neurological symptoms [24, 25] but additionally, may reflect some aspects of DENV-associated neurological disease in humans [26]. Although DENV does not antagonise IFN responses in mice as it does in humans [27], in our study we utilised the DENV ic mouse infection model as a means to assess the role of SK1 in DENV infection and induction of ISGs in vivo in an immunocompetent animal. We compared virus replication and immune responses following ic injection of DENV into WT and SK1-/- mice. Our data define novel ISG and T-cell responses, and a lack of change in the SK/S1P axis in the brain following DENV infection and demonstrate that SK1 is not a key regulator of these processes in the brain.",

In addition, animals were monitored for body weight. Any sign of neurological disease or loss of more than 10% of body weight represented a termination point and animals were sacrificed immediately by isoflurane anaesthetic inhalation and humane decapitation. Brain tissues were harvested at sacrifice and divided into two parts. The ipsilateral section was resuspended in TRIzol reagent (Ambion Life Technologies) for RNA extraction and real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis and the contralateral section was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for SK activity assay and S1P quantification or fixed for histological analysis.",

Total RNA (0.5 \u03bcg) was reverse transcribed using M-MuLV reverse transcriptase (NEB) and random hexamers (NEB) in a 20 \u03bcl final volume, and subjected to a real-time qRT-PCR. qRT-PCR was carried out using 2 \u03bcl of cDNA template in a 10 \u03bcl reaction using iTaq SYBER green (BioRad) with 20 \u03bcM of each forward and reverse primer. All PCR primers were synthesised by GeneWorks with sequences as listed in Table 1. Real-time qRT-PCR was performed using Rotor-Gene 3000 real-time PCR system (Corbett research, Australia) under the following conditions: one cycle of 95\u00b0C for 5 minutes; 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 seconds, 59\u00b0C for 30 seconds, and 72\u00b0C for 30 seconds; and one cycle of 72\u00b0C for 60 seconds followed by melt curve analysis. Quantitative DENV copy number was calculated from a standard curve generated from known concentration of MON601 DNA quantitated by spectrophotometry. DNA copy numbers from 15 pg/\u03bcl to 0.015 pg/\u03bcl were analysed in concurrent real-time PCR to generate a standard curve from which unknown DENV RNA copy numbers were calculated. Relative RT-PCR quantitation was determined by the \u0394Ct method [30] for all other genes. All PCR reactions were normalised against the reference housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH).",

Animals were challenged by ic injection with 800 pfu/mouse DENV-2, and body weight and neurological symptoms (slow movement, hunched posture, and reduction in hind limb movement) recorded daily. Mock-infected mice did not demonstrate any loss in body weight or neurological symptoms (Fig 1A\u20131D). Although there was a tendency towards a greater and earlier body weight loss in DENV-infected SK1-/- mice compared with DENV-infected WT mice, there was no significant difference in terms of the overall number of mice that lost body weight, the time of onset of body weight loss, nor the percentage of mice that lost more than 7% of body weight (Table 2). When average body weight gain as a percentage of the initial body weight was analysed, results showed that both DENV-infected WT mice and SK1-/- mice started to lose body weight at 6 days post infection (dpi) in comparison to mock-infected mice (Fig 1A and 1C). As expected, analysis of survival demonstrated a significantly higher mortality in DENV-infected compared to mock-infected mice (Fig 1B and 1D). Comparison of body weight loss and survival of DENV-infected WT and SK1-/- mice support the trends in Table 2 and demonstrate that DENV-infected SK1-/- mice show a significantly greater weight loss at 7 dpi than WT mice (Fig 1E). At this time point, 7 out of 17 WT mice (~41%) and 7 out of 13 SK1-/- mice (~54%) were sacrificed due to either excessive body weight loss and/or appearance of signs of DENV-induced neurovirulence. This is reflected by an apparent higher survival rate of WT compared to SK1-/- mice at 7 and 8 dpi, although this was not statistically significant (Fig 1F). These results suggest that C57BL/6 mice deficient in SK1 tend to be more susceptible to body weight loss following DENV-2 infection than their counterpart WT mice but the overall disease profile is comparable.",

Eight WT or SK1-/- mice were injected ic with DENV-2 and brain tissues harvested at 3 dpi. DENV RNA levels at 3 dpi tended to be higher in SK1-/- compared with WT mice (p = 0.083), but were not significantly different (Fig 2B). RNA levels were also quantitated in WT and SK1-/- mice at the termination of experiments. DENV RNA level was significantly higher at day 7\u20138, than at 9\u201314 dpi in both WT and SK1-/- mice (Fig 2C). The sacrifice of mice at 7\u20138 dpi was due to symptomatic presentation and ethical termination, but those sacrificed at 9\u201314 dpi showed body weight loss but lacked neurological symptoms and represented an elective time for termination of the experiment. Based on the disease presentation and comparable level of DENV RNA at 7 and 8 dpi, we have considered this combined time point as \u2018end-stage disease\u2019. We have indicated the 9\u201314 dpi animals in Figs 4\u20137 as half-filled symbols but excluded these animals from our statistical analysis since they did not show DENV-induced disease. It should be noted, however that the inclusion of the 9\u201314 dpi mice in the data set did not influence the statistical outcomes. At end-stage disease (7\u20138 dpi), DENV RNA levels again tended to be higher in SK1-/- mice brains in comparison to WT mice (Fig 2C) but were not significantly different (p = 0.116). These data suggest that DENV-2 can replicate and cause body weight loss and neurological symptoms when introduced directly into the mouse brain, with a moderate but not statistically significant increase in DENV RNA in SK1-/- compared to WT mice.",

This reflects the pathogenicity and virulence of the DENV-2 MON 601 strain in mouse brain, as has been previously reported [29, 34]. Similar to other studies of DENV ic infection, not all mice develop neurological symptoms [29, 34]. We have further shown here that symptomatic DENV-infection with body weight loss and neurological signs is positively associated with the level of DENV RNA in the brain with a lower level of DENV RNA in the brains of asymptomatic mice at 9\u201314 dpi. The data from these mice has been represented graphically but we have excluded these from our statistical analysis. Interestingly, these asymptomatic mice strikingly group together with lower induction of viperin compared to symptomatic mice (Fig 4B) but are interspersed with the symptomatic mice in terms of responses such as CD8+ mRNA levels (Fig 7B). This suggests an association of viperin with symptomatic DENV-infection in the brain, and this remains to be investigated further.",

            "text": "Mice that are deficient in SK1 showed moderately greater and earlier body weight loss and tended to have higher levels of DENV RNA following DENV-2 infection than their counterpart WT mice. Since SK1 is a pro-survival factor [35], it is possible that without SK1 mice are more prone to weight loss and growth deficiencies. Additionally, the trend towards an increase in DENV RNA in SK1-/- mice, although not statistically significant (p = 0.116), is consistent with our recent data showing enhancement of DENV-2 infection in SK1-/- primary mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF), that we demonstrated is associated with a reduced ability of DENV to induce ISGs in the absence of SK1 [17]. Thus, we assessed the SK1-dependency of the induction of ISGs in this DENV-brain infection model. We chose to analyse the mRNA level of selected important type I IFN driven ISGs: viperin [36], IRF7 [37], and CXCL10 [38] that have been described previously as antiviral factors against DENV and we have previously shown to be induced in a SK1-dependent manner in response to DENV infection in vitro [17]. Ifi27l2a was also assessed as an ISG, previously reported to be induced in the brain in response to West Nile Virus (WNV) infection [39], and for which the response to DENV-infection has not been previously defined. At 6 dpi and end stage disease the level of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA tended to be increased. In contrast there was a more rapid (1\u20133 dpi) and significant induction of ISGs viperin, Ifi27l2a, IRF7 and CXCL10 that persisted until end stage disease. IFIT1 and OAS1, which are similarly anti-viral against DENV [40, 41] were also induced rapidly but were not analysed in our complete experimental set (data not shown). This is the first report of induction of these ISGs in the brain following DENV-infection and the first report of DENV-induction of Ifi27l2a. The discordance between the induction of IFN-\u03b2 and these ISGs contrasts to studies that show IFN-\u03b2 to be a major driver of neuronal ISGs response during WNV infection in the brain [42, 43] and ISGs following DENV-infection in some cells [16, 44]. This suggests that IFN-\u03b2 may not be the major driver of induction of these ISGs following DENV infection in the brain. Potentially, other factors such as IFN-\u03b3 or \u03bb may be more important in this tissue [45\u201347]. Studies have shown the activation of microglial cells, an increase in neurological disease severity when these cells are depleted and a role for microglia in production of cytokines and chemokines such as RANTES, IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, MCP-1 and MCP5 following DENV-infection in the brain [48]. Similarly, in our model of DENV-ic infection, these resident microglial cells may be the source of the induction of ISGs we have observed here.",

            "text": "The induction of ISGs is evident prior to the presence of symptomatic infection but was not significantly different between WT and SK1-/- mice. This contrasts to our prior data from in vitro studies where embryonic fibroblasts from SK1-/- mice or cells treated with an SK1 inhibitor (SK1-I) show reduced DENV-induction of ISGs such as viperin, IFIT1 and CXCL10 [17]. Similarly, genetic deletion or chemical inhibition of SK1 reduced the IL-1 induced expression of CXCL10 [6]. This suggests that in contrast to MEF and peripheral responses, the deficiency of SK1 does not compromise the induction of ISGs in the model herein of DENV-infection of the brain. Further, that lack of a major effect of the lack of SK1 on DENV-disease suggests that similarly SK1-dependent inflammatory pathways are not involved in regulating DENV replication and pathogenicity in the brain. This contrasts to LPS [49] or ischemia-induced neuroinflammation [50] where SK1 has been shown to be present in microglia and to promote the induction of factors such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1 and nitric oxide [49] but intriguingly a lack of SK1 exacerbates LPS induced neuroinflammation [51]. Our observed lack of influence of SK1 on DENV in the brain may be due to pathogen or stimulus specific roles for SK1 in brain inflammation or tissue specific roles for SK1, where in the brain SK2 is known to be the dominant SK isoform [52]. The brain is an immune privileged site and previous studies have also reported differences in the expression of ISGs between the brain and other tissues. For example, mRNA levels for genes such as OAS, MDA5, and STAT1 as well as ISGs IFIT1, IFIT2, and ISG15 are greater in the liver than the brain of mice [53, 54]. Studies also showed expression of ISGs vary between the different cell types within the brain itself. For example, the basal and inducible levels of OAS were lower in neurons than microglia in response to MHV infection [53] and higher levels of both basal and induced ISGs (e.g. IFIT1 and IRF7) are observed in microglia than oligodendrocytes [53, 55]. Additionally, mouse cortical neurons fail to express basal levels of ISG54 and ISG56 [56] while distinct neuronal subsets in the brain differentially express Ifi27, IRF1 and viperin that make these cells more susceptible to WNV infection [43]. Thus, although we saw no overall effect of a lack of SK1 in a whole brain extract, and in situ analysis of SK1 and ISGs in different cells of the brain may be informative.",

We demonstrated a marked cell infiltrate in DENV-infected mouse brain by H&E staining and further characterised the nature of this cellular infiltrate as CD8+ but not CD4+ T-cells by RT-PCR analysis, although we did not analyse the presence of monocytes, a cell type also known to infiltrate the brain in WNV infection [59, 60]. A prior study has shown both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells infiltration into the brain following DENV-3 challenge in C57BL/6 mice [25], or DENV-2 challenge in BALB/c mice [34]. Further, Hsieh et al. showed predominant CD8+ compared to CD4+ T cell infiltration in DENV-infected mouse brain [38]. Similarly, the infiltration of T cells has been demonstrated in mouse brains during infection with other flaviviruses. Increased CD8+ but not CD4+ mRNA levels were detected in Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV)-infected mouse brains [61], and similarly CD8+ T-cells infiltrate WNV-infected mouse brains [62] and following ic challenge with the Alphavirus, Semliki Forest virus (SFV) [63]. In contrast, both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells have been reported in mice challenged with a WNV [60, 64] and Yellow fever (YF)-17D virus [65]. Thus, there is an overall consensus from a number of flavivirus and other virus infections in the brain that CD8+ T-cells are a major infiltrating cell type, and our data is consistent with this suggestion.",
