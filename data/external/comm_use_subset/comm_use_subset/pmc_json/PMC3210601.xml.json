Coronaviruses are also important pathogens that mainly cause respiratory and enteric diseases in humans. For example, SARS-CoV causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) resulting in the epidemic in 2002\u20132003 with more than 8000 death cases worldwide [1]. The increasing resistance to current therapies and the toxicities of existing drugs aggravates the prevalence of these infectious diseases. These issues thus necessitate the need for alternative therapies. A promising strategy is to develop new drugs targeting the parasites\u2019 cysteine proteases that are crucial for their growth, differentiation and pathogenicity. Examples of these proteolytic enzymes are rhodesain from Trypanosoma rhodesiense, falcipain from Plasmodium falciparum, and cysteine cathepsins from Leishmania spp. [2]. Moreover, the coronavirus main protease (Mpro, also named 3C-like protease 3CLpro) as well as the papain-like protease (SARS-CoV PLpro) are also considered to be major targets for new antiviral drugs against SARS and other coronavirus infections [3].",

More than 5300 different natural products have so far been isolated from marine sponges and their associated bacteria and more than 200 new metabolites are reported from sponges annually [4]. Owing to their filter-feeding capacity and to the frequent presence of massive amounts of microbial symbiotic consortia in the mesohyl tissues, sponges are also rich sources of microorganisms, many of which produce interesting bioactivities [5,6]. Cultivation efforts have focused particularly on the actinomycetes, as this taxonomic clade is responsible for the production of about half of the discovered antibiotics to date [7\u20139]. We have recently described the isolation of a new actinomycete species, Streptomyces axinellae type strain Pol001 cultivated from the Mediterranean sponge, Axinella polypoides [10]. Here, the isolation of new tetromycin derivatives with unprecedented inhibitory activities against several clinically important cysteine proteases is reported. The choice to use cysteine proteases as possible target enzymes is based on the tetronic acid moiety which is part of all the isolated metabolites. Due to its lactone ring with the double bond activated for nucleophilic attack by its electron withdrawing substituents, this moiety is predestined to inhibit cysteine proteases.",

HPLC fractionation yielded five compounds, tetromycins 1\u20134 (1\u20134), and tetromycin B (5) [12]. HRESIMS and extensive 1D and 2D NMR analysis (Table 1) suggested that the compounds were new constitutional isomers with several tetromycins that had been previously isolated from a Streptomyces sp. strain MK67-CF9 [13]. Tetromycin 1 displayed a pseudo-molecular ion in the positive ESIMS spectrum at m/z 910.4388 [M + Na]+ that corresponded to a molecular formula of C50H65NO13 and was isomeric with tetromycin C5 [13].

The presence of these functional groups was further supported by the 1H, 13C and DEPT NMR data. The carbon-proton connectivities were unambiguously assigned by HSQC experiments. In all four compounds, the 13C NMR indicated the presence of a two-times hydroxy/alkoxy-substituted aromatic moiety made of carbons C33\u201338. The corresponding signals in the 1H NMR spectra showed only two aromatic protons (H35; H37) in meta-position to each other of the aromatic ring (see Table 1 for shifts, multiplicity, and coupling constants). HMBC correlations of the methyl group protons H34\u2032 to the carbonyl C32 and to C33\u2013C35 of the aromatic ring confirmed an additional ortho-substitution pattern. COSY interactions of H34\u2032 to only one of the aromatic protons (H35) left C36 and C38 open for further substitution. Aromatic carbon shifts of C36 and C38 at ~160 ppm indicated the hydroxy or alkoxy substituents to be located at these positions. In tetromycins 2, 3, and 4, the hydroxy group at C38 is methylated, as evident from the correlations between methoxy group protons H38\u2032 and C38 in the HMBC spectrum. By contrast, compound 1 is hydroxylated at C38. C36 carries a methoxy group in compounds 1 and 2 and hydroxy groups in 3 and 4 as clearly indicated by HMBC, 13C and 1H data (Figure 1).",

            "text": "The main differences between tetromycins 1, 2, and 4 and their previously isolated congeners covered in a patent [13] lie in the presence of a double bond between C20 and C21 (instead of between C25 and C26 as stated for tetromycin C5) of the decalin ring system and the position of a methyl group at C21 instead of at C20. The following detailed NMR correlations accounting for these altered positions are exemplarily discussed for tetromycin 4 using selected key NMR interactions (Figure 2). HSQC spectra showed two diastereotopic protons H22 (\u03b4 2.26, 1.95) attached to C22 (\u03b4 39.7). Strong ROESY and COSY correlation of H22 (\u03b4 2.26) to H23 (\u03b4 3.39) and correlative coupling constants suggested a 3J-coupling and a direct connection between C23 and C22. In the HMBC H22 (\u03b4 1.95) correlates with a methyl carbon at \u03b4 18.9 (C21\u2032) and two vinylic carbons at \u03b4 125.8 (C20) and 140.4 (C21), the latter presumably carrying the methyl group in agreement with the higher shift and according to HMBC signals. Methyl protons H21\u2032 (\u03b4 1.69) showed three strong correlations, not only with vinylic carbons C21 and C20 but also with C22 suggesting again the positioning of the methyl group at C21 and not at C20 as described earlier [13]. This conclusion was further substantiated by a strong HMBC correlation of the vinylic proton H20 (\u03b4 4.92) with C24 (\u03b4 46.5). Closing the first six-membered ring of the decalin system, C24 is directly connected to C23 as evidenced by direct COSY interactions and HMBC correlations of H22 (\u03b4 2.26) to C24. C24 also correlated with proton H26 (\u03b4 2.09), which in turn showed HMBC correlation with C23 (\u03b4 84.9), C25 (\u03b4 37.8), C4 (\u03b4 52.6) and C4\u2032 (\u03b4 15.6). Looking at the corresponding 13C NMR shifts, no C-C double bond could be located in the second six-membered ring of the decalin system, specifically not between C25 and C26 as featured in the previously described compounds. HMBC, 13C, and 1H data confirmed this result. We have thus discovered a series of tetromycin derivatives possessing a double bond between C20 and C21 and a methyl group at C21. The remaining partial structures of compounds 1, 2, and 4 are in turn in accordance with the already published compounds.",

            "text": "Interestingly, tetromycin 3 exhibiting a molecular ion in the positive ESIMS spectrum at m/z 861.4062 [M + H]+ corresponding to a molecular formula of C48H61O14 was found to be a completely new derivative. The differences are again found in the decalin ring system made of C4, C5, C19\u2013C26 and additionally in the cyclohexene fragment (C12\u2013C17) carrying the acid group at C14 (Figure 3). As seen for tetromycins 1, 2, and 4, HSQC data of tetromycin 3 revealed two diastereotopic protons H22 (\u03b4 1.93, 2.32) located at C22 (\u03b4 34.1). HMBC correlation of C23 with H22 (\u03b4 1.93) again accounted for the single bond between C23 and C22 as discussed before. However, in this compound C23 also shows strong HMBC correlation to vinylic proton H21 (\u03b4 4.95), suggesting close proximity to the carbon at \u03b4 120.3 (C21) which is a CH-unit according to DEPT data. H21 furthermore correlates with methyl group C20\u2032 (\u03b4 14.3), C19 (\u03b4 42.1), and interestingly also with C27 (\u03b4 103.1), which reinforces the proposition of assigning \u03b4 120.3 to C21 instead of to C20 as was found in our other isolated compounds. Unobserved in tetromycins 1, 2 and 4, methyl group protons H20\u2032 of 3 correlated with C20, C21, and also with C19 (\u03b4 42.07), the bridge atom of both six-membered rings of the decalin system, leading to the undoubted conclusion about the methyl group position at C20. The second six-membered ring only features saturated carbon atoms as was discussed above.",

The loss of the methyl group at C12 was in accordance with the observed lower molecular mass, also indicating a formal loss of a CH2-fragment compared to the other compounds. We therefore report the discovery of the new tetromycin derivative (3) featuring a double bond between C20 and C21, a methyl substituent at C20, and hydrogen at C12.

For compounds showing considerable inhibition at this concentration (>50%), inhibition kinetics were analyzed in detail. Progress curves of substrate hydrolysis in absence or presence of inhibitor were monitored over a period of 10\u201340 min. For compounds showing non-time dependent inhibition the residual enzyme activities vi (obtained from the slopes of the progress curves) were fit to the inhibitor concentrations using the Dixon equation vi = vo/(1 + I/Ki app), and correction to zero substrate concentration by the Cheng-Prusoff equation [20,21] for competitive inhibitors: Ki = Ki app/(1 + [S]/Km). For compounds showing time-dependent inhibition the progress curves were fit to the exponential equation: y = limit \u00d7 (1 \u2212 exp(\u2212kobs \u00d7 t)) + offset yielding the pseudo-first order rates of inhibition kobs. These were then fit to the inhibitor concentrations with kobs = ki \u00d7 I/(Ki app + I) yielding ki and Ki app; Ki app values were corrected to zero substrate concentration by: Ki = Ki app/(1 + [S]/Km) and k2nd was calculated from k2nd = (ki/Ki).
