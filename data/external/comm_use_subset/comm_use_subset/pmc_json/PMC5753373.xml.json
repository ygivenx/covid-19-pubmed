            "text": "The process used to study any new biological entity begins by classifying it in relation to other known biological organisms, and then giving it a name (1\u20133). This process of classification and naming comprises the discipline of taxonomy, and has been an integral part of biological research since at least the 18th Century when Carl Linnaeus defined the principles of modern taxonomy (4). Taxonomic classification is a scientific endeavor whereby biological organisms are grouped together and placed into their proper taxonomic hierarchy based on the characteristics that form a unique descriptor identifying a particular organism. This research process is driven by individual scientists who publish their work, providing their evidence for the proposed classification. As new data are obtained either on the organisms previously studied, or on related organisms, the classification hierarchy may change. The principles, procedures, and nomenclature used to name taxa, is handled by one of the international organizations charged with developing the necessary guidelines. For example, naming of animal species is subject to the principles established by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (2,5). Naming of bacterial species is guided by the International Committee on Systematic Bacteriology (3).",

The ICTV consists of a series of officers, subcommittee chairs, and elected members that oversee taxonomic classification and naming. There are six subcommittees, each of which covers a different group of viruses, differentiated by the type of host the virus infects (animal, plant, fungal and protist, or bacterial and archaeal) and the molecular composition of the virus genome (DNA, RNA, double or single stranded and translational polarity). Each subcommittee contains a series of study groups, generally one per virus family, that develop the demarcation criteria used to define each new taxon, and evaluate proposals using those criteria for classification and naming. These demarcation criteria are based upon the genetic and biological properties of the taxon members, and cover each of the taxonomic ranks currently recognized by the ICTV: order, family, subfamily, genus and species.",

The properties that define higher-level taxa are shared with all lower-level taxa that belong to higher-level taxa (15). For example, viruses of the order Picornavirales all are non-enveloped, icosahedral particles containing one or two segments of positive-sense RNA (16). The family Picornaviridae is one of (currently) five families belonging to the order Picornavirales. Members of the family Picornaviridae contain a single monocistronic genome with conserved genome organization (arrangement of encoded polypeptides). Members of the genus Enterovirus (family Picornaviridae) share more than 42% amino acid identity across the length of their polyprotein. Finally, members of the species Enterovirus C, share a limited range of hosts and host receptors, have similar polyprotein processing programs, and share more than 70% amino acid identity in the polyprotein. Once these criteria for grouping similar viruses into common taxa are established, they are used as demarcation criteria to determine if newly discovered viruses are members of an existing species (and therefore also in existing higher-level taxa), or if the new viruses warrant creation of a new species (and potentially new higher-level taxa), if their properties are sufficiently distinct from the viruses in an existing species.",

            "text": "Every year, virologists submit proposals to the ICTV recommending the creation of new taxa as well as renaming, moving, or abolishing existing taxa. These proposals are submitted to the appropriate study group which then evaluates and modifies the proposal as necessary, in consultation with the original author. Once a year, the ICTV Executive Committee (EC) meets, discusses all submitted proposals, and will either accept a proposal, send it back for modification, or reject it. Then the set of accepted proposals are sent to the ICTV membership for ratification. Once ratified, the newly approved taxonomy is entered in the ICTV taxonomic database. The database utilizes a relational schema built using Microsoft SQL Server. The tables store a controlled vocabulary used for specific fields where the possible data values remain fairly constant. These include taxonomy level (currently species, genus, subfamily, family, and order), possible taxonomic changes from the previous release (new, split, move, merge, rename, and abolish), and virus genome type (e.g. dsDNA, ssDNA, dsRNA, ssRNA(+), ssRNA(\u2013), etc.) that forms part of the annotation available for the member viruses of each species. Each record in the taxonomy table stores data on a single taxon including its name, numerical id, parent taxon, release number and date, most recent taxonomic change, filename of the proposal establishing the taxon, and a pointer to its previous record if a change has occurred in taxon data (such as moving a species to another genus). With this information, a complete history of every taxon can be reconstructed from the database. Table 1 displays an example set of database records for the species Measles morbillivirus.",

Each of these releases can be accessed using the taxonomy browser by following the appropriate link on the release history web page (http://ictv.global/taxonomyReleases.asp). In addition, by selecting the \u2018history\u2019 link from the taxonomy browser (Figure 2), a page displaying the complete history of the selected taxon is displayed (Figure 3). This history is constructed from the complete set of database records that are part of the historical path leading to the selected taxon, and to the most recent child of that taxon in the last release recording a change. For example, in Figure 3, the most recent change to this particular taxonomic lineage was the creation of the species Alphacoronavirus 1 in 2009. But in fact, this was not a new species, but was a merging of three existing species (transmissible gastroenteritis virus, feline coronavirus, and canine coronavirus) into one, newly renamed species, Alphacoronavirus 1. In addition, the species were moved from the now defunct genus coronavirus, into the genus Alphacoronavirus that is a member of the subfamily Coronavirinae. This particular history goes back to the first ICTV data release in 1971 when the species transmissible gastro-enteritis virus of swine was created as a member of the genus coronavirus. (The species concept in virus taxonomy was not defined until 1996 (8). Therefore any \u2018species\u2019 present in the database between 1971 and 1995 represents an informal taxonomic rank, existing to contain the viruses that are members of each genus and higher-level ranks.)",

This has been published as a hard-copy book, and contains a complete listing of all taxa, along with a list of exemplar viruses corresponding to each species. In addition, these reports provide extensive information on each taxon, describing the properties and characteristics of the virus members of each taxon. These reports also contain a description of the demarcation criteria used to determine whether a particular virus should be classified into an existing species, or whether the creation of a new species (and potentially higher-level taxa) is warranted. The last hard-copy ICTV Report published was the ninth Report, published in 2012 (1). (Due to the length of time required to compile the report, the ninth Report was based on the 2009 ICTV taxonomy release.) The ninth report is currently available as an open-source publication from the ICTV web site (http://ictv.global/9th-report/). The ICTV 10th Report on Virus Taxonomy is being published in an online format, and is available from the ICTV web site (http://ictv.global/report/). The 10th report is being published sequentially as chapters are released at the rate of \u223c25 a year.",

Virus discovery has been one of the areas of emphasis of large environmental sampling and metagenomic sequencing projects. The goal of these projects is to more thoroughly assess, in an unbiased manner, the true diversity of biological organisms in a particular environment at a particular place in time, by sequencing the genomes of all organisms present in a sample using high-throughput sequencing technologies. For viruses, this entails utilizing methods that sequence not only DNA-based organisms, but organisms (viruses) with RNA genomes, by including a reverse transcription step in the metagenomic isolation and sequencing pipeline. Once the sequence reads have been generated, efficient sequence assemblers are then able to then identify the reads unique to a single virus genome, and assemble them into a complete, or almost complete, genomic sequence. These metagenomic sequencing projects have resulted in the assembly of thousands of new virus genomes that when classified, should result in the creation of thousands of new virus species and higher-level taxa.",

A consensus statement published by meeting participants recommended that viruses detected solely by metagenomic sequencing contain sufficient information in their genomic sequence to support their classification and naming (30,31). The ICTV concurred with that recommendation. Therefore, the ICTV is now accepting proposals for new virus taxa supported solely by metagenomic sequence information. This policy should ensure that the official ICTV virus taxonomy will be much more reflective of the true diversity of existing viruses. But at the same time, this will require that the systems in place for characterizing virus diversity, proposing new virus taxa, storing these taxa in the ICTV database, and browsing and searching for these taxa from the ICTV web pages, be streamlined and made capable of handling the many thousands of new taxa that will need to be created. The ICTV may also need to modify its policies and procedures for naming of virus species and expand the available taxonomic ranks needed to classify these viruses, to handle the large number of new, diverse viruses discovered using metagenomic sequencing methods.",
