As the World Health Organization pointed out in its report, \u2018Life in the 21st century: a vision for all\u2019, there is a shift to focus on preventive medicine in effort to improve and maintain baseline health [1]. In China, non-infectious chronic diseases (NCDs) have become a serious health threat, and are recognized as a severe public health problem. National data showed that one in five people in China have been diagnosed with at least one chronic disease, and deaths caused by chronic diseases comprise an estimated 80% of total mortality [2, 3]. This chronic disease burden constituted 70% of total disease burden in 2005 [2, 3]. While the incidence rates of infectious diseases dropped drastically in recent years, infectious diseases continue to be major threats to the health of the Chinese people [4]. The outbreaks and onslaught of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), avian flu, and HIV/AIDS provides evidence that the threat of infectious disease is a prevalent issue. Also, aside from challenges from both chronic and infectious diseases, China faces other public health issues such as a rapid aging population, smoking, environment pollution, obesity, and other health disorders [5\u20137]. In order to meet these challenges, competent public health professionals are urgently needed by the Chinese society. However, there is still a shortage of public health professionals in China [8, 9]. For example, the number of health professionals for disease prevention and control is around 14 per 100,000 people in China, which is only one-fifth of that of the United States [10]. The number of health professionals at China\u2019s Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDCs) decreased from 157,000 in 2005 to 147,000 in 2011 [11]. Nearly half of China\u2019s public health professionals have graduated from secondary schools with a vocational degree (i.e. Zhong Zhuan), adding to concerns regarding the public health professionals\u2019 level of education [8]. Therefore, China\u2019s public health education system is faced with the task of coping with increasing demands for its public health workforce.",

When the People\u2019s Republic of China was founded in 1949, public health, formerly called \u201chygiene\u201d, was one of the only four undergraduate majors for health professionals, and remained as a core major though the official list of majors was revised several times.

From the 1950s to 1970s, the Chinese model of public health education was adopted from the former Soviet Union, placing emphasis on sanitation and hygiene. During this era, many medical universities and colleges established departments of hygiene or, as it was later called, preventive medicine. Public health education mainly consisted of five core disciplines: food and nutrition, environment health, labor health, radiation health, and school health [10, 12, 13]. Beginning in the 1980s, departments of preventative medicine began founding schools of public health [14]. New disciplines were also established, based on western models, which included epidemiology, health statistics, social medicine, and health policy and management. In 2002 and 2003, the outbreak and spread of SARS not only raised people\u2019s attention to public health and infectious diseases prevention, but also led to a strong call for the education and training of health professionals to tackle public health emergencies [15]. In the past few years, globalization and the aging population triggered the establishment of some new disciplines, including global health and elderly health [16].",

Master and doctorate education belongs to graduate education, of which the focus has shifted from academic education (e.g. PhD degree programs) to professional education (e.g. Master of Public Health degree programs) [10]. A number of the most competitive universities also offer 7-year combined undergraduate-master programs, and 5-year combined master-doctorate programs. The Master of Public Health (MPH) program was initialized in 2002 [17]. As of 2010, there were 24 universities that were authorized to admit MPH students, with an annual enrollment of about 1500. The annual enrollment of undergraduate, master, and doctorate public health students were about 7000, 1500, and 300 to 400, respectively [18].",

Typically, the former admits high-school graduates as full-time students by the national college entrance examination, while the latter provides adults with higher education on a part-time basis through distance education or select on-campus courses. Regular HEIs may best represent China\u2019s higher education of health professionals because they are dominant in the educational system and all top HEIs are regular ones. Furthermore, a person who wishes to study health science at HEIs for adults should be an in-service health professional or have obtained a license for practice [21], making it difficult to estimate the effects of education output on the development of health workforce. Therefore, only regular HEIs are included in our analysis.",

We found that the number of public health education institutions, enrollment, students, and graduates generally increased over the years. The expansion of public health education has played a positive role in addressing the deficit of the public health workforce. Indeed, the number of public health workers in China increased from 533,000 in 2005 to 667,000 in 2012 [22]. From this study, we can also support that the decrease in junior college enrollment and increased enrollment in undergraduate, master, and doctoral programs directly affected the education attainment composition of public health professionals. By 2012, 28.7% of public health practitioners had a higher educational attainment beyond undergraduate level [23]. In China\u2019s CDCs, this percentage grew from 15.5% in 2005 to 30.7% in 2010 [11].",

Also, the enrollment quota at the university was considered to be insufficient for the public health and preventive medicine programs [24]. Although China plans to increase the public health workforce to 1.2 million by 2020, the country has yet to establish a national-level plan to regulate the increased scale of public health education [22].

Due to a large proportion of students that were dissatisfied with their majors, these students were more likely to find a job that is not related to health science. The survey also found that about one in five public health student were unwilling to find a job in public health after graduation [31]. Furthermore, the education for public health students in China lags behind due to outdated curriculum and teaching materials [18], excessive focus on teaching biomedical sciences [8], insufficient or low quality practical training in the public health sector [6, 32]. Finally, although it is essential to equip future physicians with the knowledge of disease prevention and support their ability to deal with public health emergencies [33], insufficient attention was given to teaching public health and building public health competencies in the medical education in China, leaving medical students with poor awareness of disease prevention and creating a deficiency in training for these students on infectious diseases and population health topics [34, 35].",

In 2017, the State Council called for a close correlation between the education of health professionals and Chinese health system\u2019s demand for health professionals. This emphasizes a major aim of the education reform: to increase the supply of those health professionals in highest demand, and to improve the quality of those graduates. A number of measures were suggested to strengthen the reform: establishing a balancing mechanism between the supply and demand of health professionals to optimize the scale and structure of education, prioritizing standardized education to improve the quality of graduates, and improving incentive policies for health professionals. In the first health professional education policy issued by the General Office of the State Council since the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China in 1949, public health professionals are listed as one of the health professionals that are scarce and urgently needed by the Chinese society, indicating a need to continue expanding the overall scale of public health education [36]. In the near future, concrete actions may be needed to accelerate the reform progress in education for public health. To optimize the overall scale of education, it may be necessary to plan and reform public health education by developing evidence-based research and policy-making. Meanwhile, it is also important to take measures to recruit students who are more likely to stay in public health. In addition to improving the public health curriculum, China\u2019s HEIs may consider providing MD (Doctor of Medicine)- MPH (Master of Public Health) dual degree programs.",
