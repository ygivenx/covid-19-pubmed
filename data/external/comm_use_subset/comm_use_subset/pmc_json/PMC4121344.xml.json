Although the etiology of the disease remains unknown, postmortem studies have indicated that dying cells not only bear signs of necrosis, but also of apoptosis, in particular chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, oxidative damage, mitochondrial dysfunction and caspase activation (3,4). 1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) is commonly used in vitro and in vivo to produce models of PD (5,6). Similar to other dopaminergic toxins, MPP+ causes oxidative stress and the selective death of dopaminerigic neuronal cells, such as PC12 (7) and SH-SY5Y cells (8).",

The present study clearly confirms that GA exerts marked neuroprotective effects, as evidenced by our results: GA greatly ameliorated the MPP+-induced reduction in cell viability, the increased apoptotic rate, the intracellular Ca2+ overload and the dissipation in MMP in the DPC12 cells. GA also exerted suppressive effects on the overproduction of intracellular LDH caused by MPP+. Consistent with the results of previous studies (25,26), this suppressive effect on the LDH level is a consequence of the protective effects of GA against neurotoxicity.

A key feature of mitochondrial apoptosis is the disruption of the membrane potential, mainly caused by increased membrane permeability (32). The present study demonstrated that GA restored the dissipation of MMP and promoted the activation of ERK. As reported previously, the activation of ERK regulates mitochondrial function (33,34). Previous studies have demonstrated that ERK inhibitors downregulate the expression of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-extra large (Bcl-xL) (33), which are located in the outer membrane of the mitochondria and regulate mitochondrial function (35).

In another separate experiment, GA did not exert any effects on the glutamate-induced decrease in the level of p-AKT. The different results noted in our study may due to the different microenvironmental system. Furthermore, the accumulation of cells in the G1 phase is considered one of the factors responsible for MPP+-induced cell damage (36). In our study, MPP+-induced G1 phase arrest was observed in the DPC12 cells; however, pre-treatment with GA failed to reverse this effect (data not shown).",
