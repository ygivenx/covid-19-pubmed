HN is a tetramer that carries out several functions in addition to serving as the receptor binding protein for the virus by binding to sialic acids (8). When HN is bound to a receptor, it activates F to a fusion ready state. Once activated, F inserts itself into the target membrane and undergoes a series of conformational changes that lead to fusion. Structural rearrangement of the F protein drives the cell-associated fusion peptide toward the viral membrane, bringing the two membranes into proximity and facilitating membrane fusion and viral entry (9, 10). HN also stabilizes the prefusion state of F prior to receptor engagement (11) and cleaves the receptor via its neuraminidase activity during viral budding (9, 12). These properties act together during infection of a target cell, when HN must signal the F protein, inducing the series of conformational shifts in F that result in fusion of the viral membrane with the host cell membrane at the correct time and place in the highly specialized human airway microenvironment (7). Such critical functions place the HN protein and HN-F fusion complex under significant selective pressure.",

Significant differences in properties governed by HN and the HN-F interaction exist between cultured laboratory and clinical strains in the HN and F proteins, and these differences point to the requirements for infection in each environment (4). HPIV-3 adapts to culture via increased fusion activity, whether by HN\u2019s increased avidity for receptor, enhanced activation of F, or reduced receptor cleavage that results in enhanced receptor contact and fusion (4\u20137). Evaluation of a panel of clinical strains that were deep sequenced without passage in immortalized monolayer cultures and which were grown only in primary human airway epithelium (HAE)\u2014revealed functional differences in the HN-F fusion complex and a phenotype of less active fusion activation in the clinical viruses (4). The preservation of these functional features in the panel of clinical isolates during growth in human airway suggested that mitigating fusion may be important for fitness in vivo.",

For example, passaging of influenza A virus in eggs during vaccine production results in adaptations that alter its antigenicity (13, 14), and cell culture adaptation of hepatitis C virus impairs its fitness in vivo (15). These and other studies (16\u201322) have delineated the importance of characterizing clinical viruses, as well as the need to investigate viral evolution in authentic tissues and the biological significance of such adaptations. In fact, based on evaluation of a set of clinical strains compared to laboratory strains and to other available sequences (4), we hypothesized that adaptation to culture conditions might occur so rapidly that by virtue of growing the viruses to sequence, the strains published as being clinical may have actually altered to suit cultured cells and could no longer be considered clinical strains. There has been a relative dearth of sequence information available for HPIV compared to other respiratory viruses (23), and more importantly a lack of information about strains prior to passaging in the laboratory and thereby being subjected to selective pressure.",

We used metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of field strains of HPIV-3 isolated from humans to analyze the diversity and commonalities of circulating HPIV-3 strains at the genomic level, and we simultaneously sequenced paired specimens that were subjected to culture for viral isolation. The sequencing strategy we used to sequence clinical strains directly without passage in immortalized cells does not rely on designing sequence-specific primers that may amplify only a subset of samples (in case of mutations) (24). Deep genomic sequencing of nine sets of paired clinical samples (primary nasal swabs in viral transport medium) and culture isolates (culture harvest from zero passage virus) led to discovery of a number of HN mutations associated with rapid evolution in culture. To assess the frequency of mutations identified earlier, we also performed deep sequencing of 118 HPIV-3 clinical samples and culture isolates from the University of Washington Virology Laboratory, allowing us to confirm that the alterations associated with brief exposure to culture for viral isolation were almost entirely found in the sequences of culture isolates and found commonly within populations of viruses in those isolates.",

These results support the notion that clinical strains differ from cultured viruses in the balance of fusion properties. The locations of the residues that differ after brief culture of clinical viruses point to specific domains that are relevant to the control of viral entry in vivo. The sequencing data, when correlated to functional data, help define the flexibility and constraints of the HPIV-3 fusion complex. These data provide the first characterization of culture-associated HN mutations in the background of HPIV-3 clinical strains directly from patient samples. We show that, even during transient exposure to culture (\u201czero passage\u201d virus), the act of isolating a virus is associated with genomic evolution that may significantly affect viral protein function and not reflect in vivo dynamics.",

We investigated the variant alleles with a minor allele frequency of >5% that arose in culture. The nine swabs included one clinical sample that was independently cultured twice, such that ten viral isolates were sequenced. Clinical respiratory samples that tested positive for HPIV-3 by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) with cycle thresholds under 25 were either sequenced directly by metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) without exposure to culture or grown on RhMK cells and viral isolates were harvested and sequenced. The choice of RhMK cells for this study was based on the fact that these are the standard cells used for viral isolation by many or most diagnostic microbiology laboratories and would allow us to answer the question of whether this standard process leads to alteration in the viruses.",

The HNs derived from clinical isolates (CIs) showed from 4- to 10-fold-higher neuraminidase activity than HNs derived from the lab-adapted strains, and the substitution of the aspartic acid at this position in the laboratory strains led to an approximately 5-fold-lower receptor cleavage in the laboratory-adapted strains, suggesting that the asparagine at position 556 is essential for the high propensity for receptor cleavage in field strains.

The diagram highlights the fact that N556 likely makes contact with the NAc modification of N523, and glycosylation could therefore have a significant effect on binding. We have shown that alterations that enhanced dimer contacts were associated with culture adaptation, while host fitness was correlated with reduced dimer contacts at these residues (6). Alterations in residues 552 and 556 have been associated with other culture conditions as well (5\u20137), supporting the notion that this site is intimately involved in the mechanism whereby HN activates F in the natural host. The mutations P241L and R242K have not been described before and appear in a cluster at the opposing side of the dimer interface. The rapid emergence of alterations here during adaptation of a patient\u2019s HPIV-3 to culture suggests a role in viral entry in the natural host. Of note, P241 does not make specific contact with the opposing monomer, but a mutation would change the conformation of the loop significantly, thereby altering the contacts that the loop can have.",

To investigate whether the identified mutations altered HN\u2019s fusion promotion ability we had previously observed in clinical isolates of HPIV-3, we introduced seven of these rapidly emerging mutations into the background of a well-characterized clinical isolate HN, clinical isolate 1 (CI-1) (4, 5). We paired these mutated HN proteins with a lab-adapted F to ensure that we could observe adequate levels of fusion to compare function, since clinical isolate HN and F pairs result in nearly unobservable levels of fusion (4). Fusion promotion by each of these mutant HN-F pairs was quantified with a \u03b2-galactosidase complementation assay and compared to the wild-type clinical isolate HN (CI WT) paired with the lab-adapted F (Fig. 5). We included an influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA) and F pair as a positive control for fusion, as it had been previously shown that HN has a stabilizing property that prevents F triggering; that is, an increase in fusion relative to the CI WT would be expected and was seen (11). The fusion exhibited by all mutant HN-F pairs was considerably higher than that of the CI WT HN-F pair, ranging from a 20-fold increase (HN S554N) to a 100-fold increase (HN L555F).",

We assessed the neuraminidase (receptor cleavage) activity and also quantified the release of receptor-bearing erythrocytes (RBCs) from HN-expressing cells as a measure of the balance between avidity and receptor-cleaving properties. Neuraminidase activity was measured through the cleavage of 2\u2032-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-\u03b1-d-N-acetylneuraminic acid, sodium salt hydrate (4-MUNANA) by HN (Fig. 6A). As previously described, almost all the culture-adapted HN mutants displayed lower neuraminidase activity than CI WT, ranging from roughly 10% (L555S) to 40% (R242K) relative activity (4). The H552Q mutant had increased neuraminidase activity, with roughly 260% activity relative to CI WT. We have previously shown that this mutation at H552 on HN confers both higher receptor avidity and intrinsically enhanced triggering of F and thereby augments fusogenicity, an effect that overrides the increase in receptor cleavage (see the release assay below) (26).",

Differences between the HNs was most readily observed at the earliest time point of 15 min, when CI WT had the most release (~77%), whereas the mutant HNs all had less release, reflecting either their higher receptor avidity, lower neuraminidase activity, or both. We observed two separate groups of mutants in their capability to release RBCs.

Each engineered virus was sequenced in full to confirm the mutations of interest. These engineered viruses permit us to evaluate the outcome of selection in terms of impact on fitness. HAE cultures at an air-liquid interface or CV-1 immortalized cell monolayer cultures were infected with viruses bearing wild-type (wt) CI HN, CI HN P241L, CI HN R242K, CI HN H552Q, CI HN S554N, and CI HN L555F and expressing EGFP. Compared to the wt CI, the viruses bearing all the mutated HNs show more infected cells in the CV-1 cell monolayers after 3 days (Fig. 7A, arrows point to examples of individual infected cells); contrast wt CI-1 infection in the top photo to infection with viruses bearing individual HN mutations in the subsequent photos, where these adaptations confer superior growth in cultured cells as expected. The wt CI virus is handicapped in growth at day 1 compared to each of the viruses bearing the individual mutations in HN (Fig. 7B, yellow squares), producing no detected progeny compared to a titer of 103 to 104 PFU/ml for each of the viruses bearing a single adaptive HN mutation. The growth in CV-1 cells reveals that while the clinical virus is severely handicapped in monolayer culture, the mutations that emerged during the RhMK culture isolation process confer growth in these monolayer cultures. While the wt CI shows negligible fitness in monolayer culture compared to the adapted viruses on day 1, by day 3 infectious virus is released into the supernatant fluid of the virus to cell culture. At day 7 however, adaptive mutations have appeared (Table 1) and correlate with increased production of infectious particles (Fig. 7B, yellow squares).",

To understand natural viral infection and the features that govern infectivity and transmissibility in humans, we have endeavored to analyze field strains in airway tissues. We have shown for human parainfluenza virus type 3 that conclusions drawn from laboratory strains can be misleading with regard to the receptor interaction and viral fusion properties that govern entry and fitness in vivo (4, 5). Analysis of clinical strains suggests that the HN-F fusion pairs of circulating HPIV-3 viruses maintain a balance of properties that result in an inverse correlation between fusion in cultured cells and growth in vivo; the fusion complex operates under specific constraints that govern viability in the different environments of cell cultures and human beings.",

We hypothesized that even during such brief periods of culture, mutations arising in the HN-F fusion complex could be informative about features essential for growth in humans that would be stringently selected against in culture. HPIV-3 evolution upon exposure to culture was extraordinarily rapid and almost entirely limited to the HN protein. Bioinformatic analyses of existing HN sequences revealed that HN mutations that arose during brief exposure to culture are almost uniformly found in consensus sequences from HPIV-3 that are either adapted to culture or exposed to culture\u2014and not found in HPIV-3 sequenced directly from clinical samples. Deep sequencing of 118 newly derived HPIV-3 isolates and clinical samples revealed that more than one-third of HPIV-3 isolates had subpopulations of HN dimer interface variants that were not reflected in consensus sequences and were not present in HPIV-3 sequences obtained directly from clinical samples.

Remarkably, all the mutations map to the dimer interface and receptor binding site II of HN. These results point to the critical role of this region in the HPIV-3 entry mechanism and for fitness in vivo, as we have deduced from smaller-scale and mechanistic studies (4\u20137, 10). The H552 residue at receptor binding site II at the dimer interface of HPIV-3 HN influences HN\u2019s dimerization and its activation of F (6, 7). We have shown that the presence of the glutamine at position 552 at the dimer interface of the HPIV-3 HN increases HN oligomerization and thereby modulates F triggering, with this HN more actively triggering F (6, 10). When the virus bearing this mutated HN was subjected to growth in human airway, it rapidly acquired a compensatory mutation, Q559R, which reduced fusion triggering and reduced HN dimerization. Structural analysis of footprints of the dimer interfaces showed that when HN H552Q is present in receptor binding site II, more of the interface residues are in contact with the opposing monomer face. However, in the HN with the Q559R compensatory mutation that permits growth in the airway, the dimer interface footprint shows decreased points of contact. The dimer interface footprint pointed to several residues and domains whose contact with the opposing monomer may be critical for the key functions governed by HN\u2019s receptor binding site II. The emergence of the H552Q mutation after brief culture highlights both the flexibility of HN\u2019s site II to adapt to new conditions and also the exquisite constraint of the virus\u2019s fusion complex with respect to alterations in the environment.",

In the present study, the N556D mutation emerged during the very brief exposure to culture, highlighting the advantage of lowering neuraminidase activity to reduce receptor cleavage for culture conditions versus the importance of neuraminidase for human infection.

The selection for L239F, P241L, and R242K in the absence of mutations in the domain from positions 552 to 556 suggests that the newly identified important region in the HN dimer interface may act independently of receptor binding site II, and the functional relationships between these two sites will be explored in future studies. Numerous deep sequenced viral isolates also demonstrated P241L and R242K HN variants in the absence of mutations in the domain from positions 552 to 556.

We have shown that clinical viruses, compared to laboratory strains, have a combination of high neuraminidase, low avidity, low F triggering, resulting in lower fusogenicity. The HN mutants that emerged here all except for HN H552Q had decreased neuraminidase activity. It is of interest that mutations at site II affect neuraminidase enzymatic activity, since this site is not known to possess enzymatic activity, which resides in the bifunctional active site at T193/D216 (12, 40\u201342). One mechanistic conjecture that will be explored is that alterations or interactions at one HPIV-3 HN site (site I or II) modulate the function of the other site, as we have shown for another paramyxovirus, Newcastle disease virus, where receptor interaction at HN site I leads to the activation of site II (43, 44). These data may suggest an unexplored cross talk between site I and site II that could alter neuraminidase activity allosterically. All the mutants\u2014including HN H552Q\u2014showed reduced release of RBCs compared to the clinical strain. The HN H552Q mutant\u2019s decreased release of RBCs in the face of increased neuraminidase activity relative to the CI WT is in agreement with our previous finding that this mutation confers increased receptor avidity (26) that balances the receptor-cleaving activity for an overall retention of contact. Interestingly, the H552Q mutation in the lab-adapted HN background does not have higher neuraminidase activity (7), supporting the notion that the phenotype conferred by these sites may be modified in the context of the genetic background. Collectively, the pattern is of enhanced receptor engagement and an increase in fusogenicity that confers fitness in vitro. The genetically engineered viruses bearing the individual alterations in HN show that each is fit for growth in monolayer culture compared to the wt parent and less fit for growth in HAE. The mutations emerging during the brief viral isolation process thus led directly to fitness for growth in monolayer culture.",

Deep sequencing after rapid selection pressure may allow for discovery of a greater number of novel mutations that may be removed from the population by drift or competition with other variant subpopulations after longer selection periods yet provide clues to function. Other techniques that can more comprehensively profile single mutations, such as deep mutational scanning, are often limited by their use of singular backgrounds, often in the context of culture-adapted strains, and focus on singular proteins.",

That viruses evolve uniquely in culture has been shown for HPIV-3 (27); however, the extraordinarily rapid nature of evolution in culture, even without passage, is notable. Most of the adaptive genotypes could be found as minor alleles only by deep sequencing of clinical samples and viral isolates. With the increased provision of deep coverage viral genomes obtained directly from clinical samples due to diagnostic mNGS, experiments similar to the one outlined here will be critical for potentially pathogenic viruses in order to assess whether previous viral characterization studies apply to newly sequenced clinical samples (47, 48). For HPIV-3, our results are consistent with the notion that use of authentic culture models that better reflect HPIV-3 growth in vivo is critical if we are to understand and characterize pathogenesis (4).",

Of particular interest is the cluster of residues around P241 and R242 that were uncovered as critical in this study. The interactions of these residues with the opposing monomer, and these points of contact of this domain within the interface, were suggested based on structural data to be relevant for fusion promotion (6).

All mutants were derived from this unique sequence. Recombinant viruses were generated by reverse genetics in the rHPIV3-CI-1-EGFP-F K108 background using a modification of methods previously described (57). Briefly, 293T cells were seeded in six-well plates. The following day, the cells were transfected using ProFection mammalian transfection system, calcium phosphate kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations with 10 \u00b5g of pFLC plasmid encoding the full-length viral genome, 40 ng of pCAGGS-HPIV3 P, 40 ng of pCAGGS-HPIV3 L, 200 ng of pCAGGS-HPIV3 N, 200 ng of pCAGGS-T7 polymerase, 100 ng of pCAGGS-HPIV3 lab-adapted HN, and 100 ng of pCAGGS-HPIV3 lab-adapted F (4). The following day, supernatant fluids were replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Two days after transfection, the cells were mechanically detached by pipetting up and down and overlaid onto CV-1 cells in a 10-cm culture dish.
