A novel porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) was reported in China in 2012 and designated HKU15 [1]. Other important porcine coronaviruses include porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV); and are members of the genus Alphacoronavirus [2]. In February 2014, the Ohio Department of Agriculture announced the identification of PDCoV in swine feces at five farms in Ohio and associated with enteric disease similar to PEDV in the U.S. [3]. Since then, PDCoV has been identified in numerous U.S. states and Canada, linked with apparent clinical disease including acute diarrhea and vomiting in the absence of other identifiable pathogens. According to field observations in the U.S., PDCoV infections cause less severe clinical disease than PEDV, but analysis of the field data is complicated since co-infections with PEDV or other pathogens are common. PDCoV is currently diagnosed by real time PCR and clinical symptoms [1, 4].",

Previously, there was little information about deltacoronavirus infections in pigs and only one surveillance study from Hong Kong reported its detection in pigs prior to its emergence in the U.S. The virus had not been reported to be associated with clinical disease in China. The newly emergent strain found on the Ohio farms, PorCoV HKU15 OH 1987, is closely related to the 2 strains from China, but it is unknown how this virus was introduced into the US [3].",

The OH-FD22 and OH-FD100 PDCoV strains were confirmed as causing an acute infection through the entire intestine, but primarily the jejunum and ileum, and clinically lead to severe diarrhea and vomiting. Clinical signs and pathological features of PDCoV-infected pigs resemble those of PEDV and TGEV infections. Effective differential diagnosis between PDCoV, PEDV, and TGEV is important to control the diseases.",

Thachil et al. [8] developed an indirect anti-PDCoV IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the S1 portion of the spike protein. Although this assay was shown to be a highly sensitive (91 %) and specific test (95 %), there is need for other ELISAs utilizing alternative antigen targets, such as the nucleoprotein of PDCoV, to serve as primary serological surveillance or confirmatory assays. As noted in Thachil\u2019s research, several serum samples collected in 2010 were found positive for PDCoV antibody by their ELISA, but all those collected in 2011 and 2012 tested negative by that assay. This finding is interesting since PDCoV was not thought to be circulating in North America prior to late 2013 [7, 9]. Therefore, availability of several serological assay formats targeting different viral antigens can be valuable as confirmatory assays in the investigation of unexpected laboratory findings.",

Next, non-bound antigen was poured off and the plates washed 3X with PBS plus 0.05 % tween-20 (PBST), then the remaining free-binding sites were blocked with 200 \u03bcl of sample milk diluent ((SMD)-PBST plus 5 % nonfat dry milk) and incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Test and control sera were diluted 1:50 in SMD, and 100 \u03bcl of the solution was added to each well of a washed plate. The plates were incubated for 1 h at 22 \u00b0C. Next, 100 \u03bcl of biotinylated, FC-specific, goat anti-swine detection antibody (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX) was diluted 1:4000 in PBST and allowed to incubate at 22 \u00b0C for 1 h. Plates were washed 3X, then 100 \u03bcl of streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Pierce, Rockford, IL, diluted 1:4000) was added and incubated for 1 h at 22 \u00b0C, then washed and developed using TMB (Surmodics, Eden Prairie, MN). Colorimetric development was stopped using 2 N H2SO4, then OD\u2019s were quantified spectrophotometrically at 450 nm with a ELx800 microplate reader (BioTek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT). The raw OD\u2019s were normalized and the corrected S/P values were calculated as follows: S/P = (OD of sample - OD of buffer)/(OD of positive control - OD of buffer).",

Prior to performing large scale coupling reactions for test validation, the optimization of the amount of antigen used was obtained by performing a checkerboard titration of antigen-coupled microspheres against a two-fold titration of swine serum. It was found that initiating a coupling reaction having 12.5ug of purified protein per 3.125 \u00d7 106 microspheres was optimal in obtaining the highest signal-to-noise fluorescence ratio. The performance of the FMIA test was described in detail previously by Okda et al. [11]. In the initial optimization of the FMIA test, we performed two-fold serial dilutions of swine serum and concluded that a dilution of 1:50 provided the highest signal-to-noise ratio. For the generation of sample fluorescence, antigen-coupled microsphere/antibody complexes were analyzed through a dual-laser Bio-Rad Bio-Plex 200 instrument. The median fluorescent intensity (MFI) for 100 microspheres corresponding to each individual bead analyte was recorded for each well. All reported MFI measurements were normalized by calculating individual S/P values using the following formula: S/P = MFI of sample - MFI of buffer control/MFI of high positive control - MFI of buffer control. The buffer control equated to the background signal determined from the fluorescence measurement of antigen-coated beads. Lastly, a single lot of pooled convalescent serum from PDCoV infected pigs was used to generate quality control standards that gave high, medium and low S/P values. The negative, low and medium samples served as internal quality standards while the high standard served as a serum constant to mathematically calculate S/P values of individual unknowns. For the FMIA, a high positive S/P = 0.8\u20131.0; medium S/P = 0.6\u20130.8; low S/P = 0.4\u20130.6; and negative S/P < 0.2, is consistent with the data of the ELISA standards.",

The immunoreactivity of antigen was determined by end-point titration and relative absorbance values as we observed differences in immunoreactivity based upon the conformational state of antigen tested. Figure 2 demonstrates in a dose-dependent fashion, that as the concentration of each antigen coated well decreases, the refolded antigen imparts a greater degree of antibody capture efficacy of swine antibodies than the non-refolded version.

The highly immunoreactive PDCoV-NP interacts with itself to form non-covalently linked oligomers and associates with the viral genome to serve as the architectural basis of the ribonucleoprotein complexes during virus assembly [19]. These reasons provided the rationale for its utility as a target antigen for the serodiagnosis of PDCoV in indirect ELISA and FMIA platforms.",

We originally hypothesized that antibody reactivity to PDCoV may be conformationally dependent so we designed an experiment to determine whether NP specific immunodominant epitopes tend to be present in greater abundance on conformationally or linearly expressed antigen. A refolded version of the NP was used as an antigen in both assays as it was shown to impart a higher degree of immunoreactivity than its unfolded, linear counterpart. This phenomenon was also observed by Johnson et al. [20] whereby the authors compared reactivity differences among single point serum titrations to provide a surrogate measure of antibody titer. They showed that the enhancement of immunoreactivity of PRRSV-N and nsp1 was completely dependent on refolding, and the reactivity of nsp2P was enhanced by twofold. Furthermore we confirmed their observations that there is a loss of immunoreactivity when the linear protein (solubilized in 8 M urea) was dialyzed in PBS prior to coating on microtiter plates or used for coupling to FMIA microspheres. This may indicate that using an antigen in its more native conformational state may present a higher number of immunoreactive epitopes that are able to capture a larger percentage of PDCoV-NP antibodies. Therefore, the production of a well purified, refolded recombinant protein maintained in a near-native conformation was required for the production of an efficacious assay.",

            "text": "Although preliminary DSe and DSp determinations for the first generation serological assays described here were slightly less than ideal, these new assays should provide valuable tools for assessment of PDCoV exposure on a herd level. One explanation for the approximately 95\u201396 % DSe values determined to date may be related to selection of the presumed positive field populations used for test validation. In this case, the initial stages of validation relied on characterizing the assay using known serum samples from experimentally infected pigs. Because this was the only sera of known serostatus we had at our disposal, we believe that the resulting initial ROC characteristics were of sufficient value to begin testing samples from other sources believed to not have been exposed to PDCoV and from field sources known to have seroconverted to PDCoV within a specific time frame. By following the methodology outlined by Jacobson [21] in which he recommends the inclusion of these initial ROC cut-off values from experimentally infected pigs, we demonstrated similar assay characteristics on chosen field samples which substantiated our final cut-off value of the assay. These sample sets were collected at approximately 3 weeks after initial diagnosis of PDCoV by PCR. It is possible that PDCoV may not move through a herd at the very rapid rate seen with PEDV. Therefore, some animals in some herds may not have been infected until a week or more after initial detection in the population, resulting in delayed seroconversion in a percentage of the presumed positive population. Likewise, since the initial origination and distribution of PDCoV in the U.S. is not fully understood at this time, it is possible that a small percentage of our presumed seronegative population may have been subject to prior exposure. Many of the samples in our presumed negative population were archived samples collected prior to 2009. However, some originated from recent field submissions from high health, biosecure herds with no clinical or PCR evidence of prior PDCoV or PEDV exposure. The observed DSp values of approximately 98 % for FMIA and 96 % for indirect ELISA are within the expected range for first generation assays using these test formats. Apparent false positive reactions could also be due to an epitope on the expressed antigen having commonality with another low prevalence infectious agent or due to low levels of residual E. coli protein contaminants in the purified antigen preparations.",

Although it is a reasonably sensitive (91 %) and specific (95 %) test, there is room for other ELISAs utilizing other target antigens, such as the NP of PDCoV, to serve as primary serological surveillance or confirmatory assays. As noted in Thachil\u2019s research, serum samples collected in 2010 were found positive for PDCoV antibody by their ELISA, but not those collected in 2011 and 2012. This was controversial because PDCoV was not thought to be circulating in North America in pigs before its identification in late 2013 [9]. It will be very beneficial to have confirmatory assays to validate this finding. Additional screening of archived historical swine serum samples using multiple serological assays may provide further insight into the origin and epidemiology of PDCoV in North America.",
