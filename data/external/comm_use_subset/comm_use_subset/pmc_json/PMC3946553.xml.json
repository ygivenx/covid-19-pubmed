We demonstrate that mice treated with CL exhibit a significant decrease in morbidity and mortality following MHV-1 infection as compared to control mice. In addition, amelioration of MHV-1-induced disease correlated with a significant increase in the frequency and total number of Foxp3+ Tregs in the lung airways and the lung tissue.

Because our data indicated a general trend of reduced CD4 and CD8 T cell responses in the lung airways, we hypothesized that AM depletion may have altered the Treg response. We had noted earlier that the total number of CD4 T cells in the lungs of CL-treated mice is increased, but there was not a similar increase in the number of the virus-specific CD4 T cells. Therefore, we questioned if an increase in Foxp3+ Tregs would account for this apparent discrepancy. We observed significant increases in the both frequency and total number of Foxp3+ CD4 T cells in the BAL (p<0.01) and the lungs (p<0.05) of the CL-treated mice at day 6 p.i. as compared to that of the PBS control mice (Figure 6A, B). We also observed that the ratio of Foxp3+ CD4 T cells to Foxp3\u2212 CD4 T cells was significantly increased in the BAL (p<0.01) and although it did not reach significance, the lung exhibited a similar trend (Figure 6C). Thus, depletion of AM was associated with a significant increase in the number of Tregs in the lung airways and lung tissue following MHV-1 infection.",

We have previously shown that C3H/HeJ mice are more susceptible than either BALB/c or C57BL/6 mice to an intranasal MHV-1 infection [17]. Our results indicate that MHV-1-induced morbidity and mortality is reduced in mice administered CL prior to infection as compared to PBS control mice. It is known that some strains of MHV can replicate within macrophages [25]. Therefore, it is possible that the protection we observe following AM depletion is due to the elimination of a population of potential viral target cells. This may explain why we observe a significant reduction in peak viral titers in CL-treated mice as compared to PBS controls. In contrast to our results, work by Luker et al. has shown that during a vaccinia virus infection, depletion of AM results in increased weight loss and viral replication [26]. Although vaccinia virus may also infect AM [26], in the study by Luker et al. CL were administered intratracheally (i.t.) 2 days prior to infection [26] as compared to i.n. administration 6 hr prior to infection as we have done here, which may account for the differences in outcomes.",

Following allergen exposure, the AM lost their capacity to promote iTreg generation and converted to an inflammatory phenotype [31]. Work by Savage et al. also showed that Treg induction could be regulated by the activation state of AM. CD4 T cells exhibit a more functional suppressor phenotype after encounter with anti-inflammatory type 2 macrophages whereas pro-inflammatory type 1 macrophages promote proliferation in the presence of antigen [32]. These studies demonstrate the importance of AM and their role in controlling lung inflammation and influencing the generation of Tregs.",

Depletion of AM prior to MHV-1 infection significantly reduces weight loss and airway function and increases survival in susceptible C3H/HeJ mice. We have previously shown that both CD4 and CD8 T cells contribute to morbidity and mortality in the model [18]. Our results suggest that depletion of AM prior to MHV-1 infection modulates the development of a pathogenic T cell response.",
