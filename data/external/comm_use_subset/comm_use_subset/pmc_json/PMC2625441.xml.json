The diagnosis of respiratory and gastric/digestive infections is complex, due to the wide range of potential pathogens that can present with the same clinical symptoms [3]. In addition to the many known causes of these infections, it has been suggested that unrecognized infectious agents, including viruses, remain to be discovered [4]. It is estimated that, on average, up to 40% of diarrhea cases are of unknown etiology [4] and that the majority (69%) of upper respiratory infections are caused by viruses, including undiscovered ones [1].",

The most familiar formats use DNA or RNA target amplification methods, such as reverse transcription (RT) PCR, and have sensitivities that are greater than culture- or antigen-based procedures [3]. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification is more convenient and sensitive than PCR in amplifying DNA targets, and can be combined successfully with an RT step for RNA respiratory viruses. However, the wide variety of potential pathogens that elicit similar clinical symptoms and diseases makes the application of individual DNA- or RNA-based diagnostic assays both complex and expensive. Even multiplex PCRs are limited to 20\u201330 candidate pathogens, and may be confounded if viral evolution results in mutations at the primer binding sites [2]. DNA microarrays offer unprecedented opportunities for multiplexing; however, they are not widely implemented in clinical microbiology laboratories because of problems with sensitivity, throughput, and validation [2]. In addition, these microarrays are unavailable for unknown and/or unexpected microbes, as they require genetic information for each tested pathogen.",

Among these sequencing technologies, 454 currently offers by far the longest read length, \u223c250 bp on the Genome Sequencer (GS) FLX platform [6]. Sequencing error levels are low (<1%) and arise primarily from homopolymer runs [7], but tend to be resolved in cases where there is sufficient coverage depth to allow the assembly of overlapping reads [8]. Many studies have used 454 pyrosequencing for the analysis of PCR amplicons, bacterial artificial chromosomes, genomic, mitochondrial, plastid DNA, and expression profiling [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. 454 is also a powerful tool for pathogen discovery [15], and was used with the GS platform to identify a new arenavirus transmitted through solid-organ transplantation [16] and a new polyomavirus in samples of Merkel cell skin carcinoma [17]. The 454 sequencing technique was also used to implicate Israeli acute paralysis virus as a significant marker for colony collapse disorder in honey bees [18]. Another group reported the whole genome analysis of Gallid herpesvirus, and showed that >99.0% coverage was obtained by assembling the raw sequence data to an overall average coverage depth of 13 [19].",

The relative copy numbers of norovirus in samples #N1 to #N3, which were isolated in 2006 (October to December), were almost consistent with the semi-quantitative PCR results, although the sensitivity of the semi-quantitative PCR was 10-fold lower than that of qRT-PCR (Figure 1C). By contrast, the real-time RT-PCR and semi-quantitative PCR were \u223c1,000-fold different in samples #N4 and #N5 (Figure 1C), which were isolated in May 2005 and January 2006, respectively. In these samples, RNA isolation for 454 pyrosequencing was performed in February 2007, whereas RNA for qRT-PCR was isolated just after sample collection. Thus, the above inconsistencies might be due to the storage periods of the samples (at 4\u00b0C).",

The total number of PMMV reads outnumbered the norovirus reads in sample #N5 (Table 1). In addition, Kyuri green mottle mosaic virus (KGMMV) was also abundantly detected in sample #N3 (813 KGMMV-specific reads in a total 25,500 reads). KGMMV was also detected after ultracentrifugation (data not shown), suggesting that KGMMV viral particles were present in the human gut. Previously, PMMV was detected at 109 virions per gram of dry weight fecal matter, and was detected in 12 (66.7%) of the 18 fecal samples collected from healthy humans [31]. This previous publication also showed that fecal PMMV was infectious to host plants [31]. Therefore, these plant-derived viruses may retain their infectivity in the feces and may even be present in diarrhea. Almost all of the detected viruses, except for the citrus tristeza virus, a member of the Closterovirus group, belong to the Tobamovirus group (Table 1). It is currently unknown if there is an interaction between these plus-stranded RNA viruses and norovirus. The most abundantly detected PMMV was also found in healthy humans [31]. Although the previous paper [31] reported that there is a lack of evidence to show that active replication of PMMV occurs in human feces, further investigations regarding plant virus replication in the human gut (epithelial cells) seem necessary.",

Indeed, the copy number of norovirus in the #N1 to #N5 samples (Figure 1C), as measured by semi-quantitative PCR, was significantly correlated with the number of norovirus genome sequences as detected by high-throughput sequencing (Table 1). In the case of the nasal samples, the copy number of the influenza virus in sample #F2 was lower than those in samples #F1 and #F3, although the endpoints of the semi-quantitative PCR for these samples were comparable (Figure 1B). This inconsistency could be due to differences in the sensitivities of the primers used for H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses (Table 1) or to the presence of different amounts of host-derived DNA/cDNA. Thus, quantitative analysis of host genes will be required. One potential reason for why we obtained fewer Flu-specific reads than norovirus reads in this study might have been the large number (90.0\u201394.6% of all reads) of host-derived sequences (Figure 2 and Table 5). These sequences were present because we performed direct RNA isolation from nasopharyngeal aspirates without first eliminating the cells or tissues. Most of the detected human-derived reads were non-coding regions, and fewer coding regions, including rRNA and mRNA sequences, were detected than expected (Table 5). These results suggest that, although contamination by human genomic DNA might be very low, an additional step for host gene removal is required. Suitable subtraction step(s) using pooled human genomic DNAs as drivers might be required to enrich in microbial genomes [15]. Alternatively, MICROBEnrich (Ambion Inc.), another method for removing contaminated human-derived RNA, could be useful to enrich microbial RNA [33]. However, the DNA virus WUV was detected from the isolated RNA, suggesting that the WUV genome and/or its transcripts present in infected cells were detected. Indeed, a novel human polyomavirus (Merkel cell polyomavirus), isolated from skin carcinoma, was detected from mRNA [17]. Taken together, these results indicate that whole RNA isolation, including host cells and tissues, followed by the suitable elimination of host-derived genes could be an effective method for identifying pathogenic viruses in clinical samples.",

To address this question, suitable control samples from healthy persons and/or pair specimens, isolated after recovery, might be required.",

As shown in Figure S1, a significant bias was found and its pattern was identical in all samples. TG (CA)\u2013rich regions were selectively amplified with the WTA kit (Table S3), probably due to nucleotide sequences of the quasi-random primer. Random RT-PCR amplification using the WTA kit was at least one log higher than that using the conventional random hexamer (data not shown). This suggests that further improvement is required for whole viral genome analysis, although our system is suitable for the comprehensive detection of viral genes. In addition, the TG (CA)\u2013rich bias was observed within the viral genome; therefore, it seems unlikely that the bias leads to quantitative differences of the detected sequences with respect to the original population.",

Seasonal influenza A virus (Flu) in nasopharyngeal aspirates from 3- to 7-year-old children was detected by a rapid diagnostic kit (immunochromatography) using Flu-specific antibodies. In 2006/2007, a large-scale norovirus outbreak occurred in Osaka, Japan, mainly infecting patients in nursing homes and welfare facilities (53%), hospitals (27%), kindergartens (15%), and elementary and junior high schools (5%) [26]. #N1 to #N3 samples were collected during this outbreak. #N1 sample was derived from a hospitalized patient and #N2 and #N3 samples were derived from patients in a welfare facility in 2006 (October to December). #N4 sample was a kindergarten student when an outbreak occurred at the elementary school of its elder brother and sister. In contrast to these four cases of putative human-to-human transmission, #N5 sample was oyster-associated. #N4 and #N5 samples were collected in May 2005 and January 2006, respectively. Diagnosis of norovirus infection was based on RT\u2013PCR [26]. The collected stool was suspended with an equal amount of PBS and was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatants (0.25 ml) were used for RNA isolation. This study was approved by the ethical review committees of the RIMD, Osaka University, Osaka Prefectural Institute of Public Health, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, and RIKEN.",
