For each of these diseases, a viral infection in childhood or young adulthood is thought to initiate a chain of immunological events that, along with other risk factors, result in a cumulative increased susceptibility to disease. The risk and clinical manifestations conferred by antecedent viral infection can vary greatly among individuals even when infected by the same virus. Experimental studies using mice have uncovered mechanisms of infection, but common inbred and transgenic strains of mice typically do not reflect the genetic diversity and phenotypic heterogeneity observed in human populations. Consequently, the mechanisms responsible for variable responses to viral infection in humans remain largely unknown.",

TMEV produces complications, which vary by mouse strain, that closely approximate human neurological conditions associated with antecedent viral infections. Moderately virulent strains (BeAn and DA) of TMEV establish a persistent infection resulting in demyelinating disease similar to MS in susceptible mouse strains such as SJL16,17 and, to a lesser extent, CBA18. In susceptible mouse strains, TMEV infection is biphasic. The early period of infection (first 4 weeks) is characterized as an acute inflammatory phase, eliciting a strong anti-TMEV antibody response19 along with an anti-TMEV T-cell response to clear the viral infection20. The later period of TMEV disease (from approximately 7 weeks post infection) is characterized by widespread neurodegeneration and chronic neuroinflammation21,22. In the TMEV-resistant strain C57BL/6, TMEV infection causes epileptic seizures, but these mice clear the virus from the central nervous system (CNS) and do not develop chronic demyelination as seen in SJL mice23,24. Depending on mouse strain, TMEV can infect motor neurons, resulting in lesions similar to ALS in humans25, or dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of CBA mice, similar to PD26,27. Since infection-associated neurological conditions in mice vary depending on genetic background, TMEV infection can be used to model heterogeneous infection-associated human diseases to better understand the underlying genetic components.",

In this study the utility of the CC was evaluated for its ability to reveal the spectrum of neurological phenotypes caused by infection by TMEV, based on genetic background.

The response of CC013 mice to TMEV was also distinct from those of previously studied inbred strains: 3 CC013 mice (out of 18 total) died during one phase or the other of TMEV infection, and based on the ongoing signs of encephalitis, these mice experienced a persistent state of inflammation rather than the typical immune shifts seen in TMEV infection58,59.",

These differences in gait suggest different mechanisms underlie ambulation changes in females and males; however, no histological differences were observed between sexes.

The distinct weight-loss difference between CC041 females and males at 5 dpi suggests sex differences in the early responses to TMEV infection in this strain. Estrogen is a modulator of TMEV infection60\u201362, and typically estrogen protects against TMEV pathogenesis: SJL females clear the virus better than SJL males and therefore develop less inflammation36. In this regard, CC041 mice resemble SJL mice in their initial response to TMEV infection. Next in the CC041 mice, motor neuron damage manifested as dramatic hind limb paralysis within 10 dpi, without full restoration of function. This paralysis correlates with lesions at 28 dpi characterized by degenerative changes in the ventral gray and white matter spinal cord and secondary atrophy of the skeletal myofibers in the lumbar segments. In the CC041 strain, gait parameter measurements indicated that TMEV-infected male mice experienced greater loss of strength than infected females did. Sex-specific differences in swing parameter measurements may be attributed to pain and/or reduced mobility in the male mice63,64. Although SJL mice infected with TMEV also experience reduced mobility during the chronic phase, for SJLs the decline is more gradual, with gait changes becoming apparent closer to 49 dpi rather than within 10 dpi as in CC041.",

Furthermore, these strains collectively have 2 haplotypes for the portion of chromosome 10 that harbors Il-22, Ifng, and NeST. Three of the 5 CC strains (CC013, CC019, and CC041) share the same haplotype for Il-22, Ifng, and NeST, inherited from the NZO/HILtJ founder strain, while CC016 and CC061 share a different haplotype for these loci. CC061 mice inherited this haplotype from the TMEV-resistant C57BL/6 J founder strain, which could have implications for the reduced severity of TMEV-induced disease experienced by CC061 mice. In CC016 mice, this haplotype is from the founder strain 128S1/SvImJ. These haplotypes consist of identical SNP genotypes and have 94% sequence identity; therefore it is likely CC016 mice also experienced a \u201cbuffering\u201d of TMEV susceptibility, regardless of what risk their H2 haplotypes might have conferred. In fact, the NeST genotype has a powerful influence on whether a particular strain can clear the TMEV infection72, and the fact that CC016 and CC061 share the same NeST genotype strongly suggests that they were more resistant to TMEV than the other strains.",

This definition of resistance/susceptibility has been used throughout this paper to maintain consistency with over 30 years of TMEV literature; however, the diverse phenotypes presented by CC strains in this small preliminary study call for updated classifications of TMEV response. For example, some strains may be classified as \u201ctolerant\u201d, meaning infected mice could have a high viral burden but no clinical phenotypes.

Indeed, Theiler\u2019s virus RNA has been found in central nervous system tissue of ALS patients25. CC013 mice demonstrated forelimb weakness, which has also been observed in mouse models of ALS such as the \u201cwobbler\u201d mouse75,76. The forelimb weakness in this model of ALS is caused by the degeneration of motor neurons in the brainstem and the spinal cord. The permanent, profound hind limb paralysis demonstrated by CC041 mice following TMEV infection may also indicate substantial motor neuron damage. A longer observation period would be necessary to determine whether the TMEV-induced disease experienced by CC013 and CC041 mice reflects the etiology of ALS, as some mouse models of ALS do not show distinct ALS-like symptoms until 10\u201311 months of age77\u201379.ii.\nEpilepsy.Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder, affecting approximately 1% of the population worldwide80. The condition can manifest in many ways across all ages81. Infections by several types of viruses are recognized as risk factors for epileptic seizures7,8,13, and genetic factors also contribute to this risk; for examples, see refs82\u201384.Seizures and seizure-like activity observed in 4 of the 5 strains studied did not present in the same ways. This suggests that CC mice could represent the variability seen in human epileptic conditions by modeling seizures with different etiologies. The fact that the seizures did not persist in the mice studied here does not preclude the possibility of other CC strains showing long-lasting, recurrent seizure activity: TMEV infection has been shown to cause spontaneous seizures several months post-infection in C57BL/6 mice24,85.iii.\nMultiple sclerosis.Risk factors for MS include genetic background, especially MHC haplotype86 and environmental factors including viral infection1,2,4,5,9,10,12,14. The phenotypes resulting from TMEV infection of SJL mice parallel human MS in a number of ways, including chronic central nervous system inflammation involving CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells, and macrophages19,87; sex-influenced disease phenotypes60; and clinical symptoms such as incontinence and gait disorders67,88. We observed gait changes suggestive of early symptoms of demyelination in 2 of the 5 CC strains studied: CC019 and CC041. Histopathology showed signs of axonal degeneration, typically seen with TMEV-induced demyelinating disease. However, spinal cord atrophy, which has been linked with severe disability in MS, occurs later during the chronic phase of TMEV infection89 but was not observed in any mice of this study.iv.\nParkinson\u2019s disease.Parkinson\u2019s Disease (PD), the second-most prevalent progressive neurodegenerative disorder in humans (behind Alzheimer\u2019s disease), generally occurs later in life and is characterized by bradykinesia, postural instability, gait issues, and tremors90. Viral infection can influence the development of PD in humans e.g., refs.91\u201398. PD-like symptoms in mouse models resemble some of the signs seen in the TMEV-infected mice studied in this experiment, including reduced stride lengths and locomotion79. However, in many PD mouse models, typical Parkinsonian phenotypes such as tremors and rigidity are not observed until mice are considerably older \u2013 up to 18 months of age77,99. In the present study we evaluated Group A mouse phenotypes until approximately 5 months of age. Although we cannot conclusively declare that any of the 5 strains of mice we investigated presented with signs of PD, the phenotypic similarities we observed encourage more study.v.\nOther neurological conditions.\n",

With regard to time spent on the rotarod and numbers of vertical plane entries (rearing), it is worth noting that TMEV-infected CC061 mice seemed to perform better \u2013 i.e., in a way more to be expected from healthy mice \u2013 than uninfected CC061 mice. Rotarod and rearing activities would be expected to show evidence of the hind limb weaknesses experienced by infected CC061 mice, but instead these mice appeared to exaggerate their physical capabilities when tested, almost as if to compensate for the effects of the infection. Perhaps the increased rearing could be due to lasting damage to the hippocampus during the acute phase of infection, which would have caused the mice to experience memory loss54; perhaps the mice reared up more to investigate their surroundings because they had trouble processing the unfamiliar environment or were experiencing anxiety. This behavior might parallel that which is sometimes associated with cognitive impairments that present in some human neurological conditions such as MS100\u2013102. Of course, it is critical for rotarod and open field measurements to be interpreted in context with observational data and other quantitative analyses such as DigiGait.",

In this study, we found evidence that 5 CC strains are differently affected by TMEV infection, providing proof of concept to support the use of CC strains to study variation in TMEV-induced neuropathological changes. Future studies should allow more time for infected mice to develop clinical signs, as this may reveal more details about neurological sequelae. Also, cytokine and gene expression levels must be considered in the future to better understand how TMEV infection induces disease. Study of both sexes and both phases of TMEV infection is necessary to more completely characterize how genetic background affects the ultimate outcome of TMEV-induced diseases. The experiments described here underline a need for further investigation into how TMEV infection contributes to disease pathologies on different genetic backgrounds, particularly as such experiments may help us better understand similar conditions in humans.",

Seizure activity was scored using the Racine scale, as follows: stage 1 \u2013 mouth and facial movement; stage 2 \u2013 head nodding; stage 3 \u2013 forelimb clonus; stage 4 \u2013 rearing with forelimb clonus; stage 5 \u2013 rearing and falling with forelimb clonus109.iii.\nClinical scoring\nMice were assessed daily for clinical signs of neurological disease, using a scoring system known to correlate with histological scores38. Scoring was based on established markers for evaluating TMEV disease, including ruffled fur, hunched posture, grooming, and limb weakness. The severity of each of these markers was scored on a scale of 0 to 6, with 0 being normal and 6 being moribund38,43. Ruffling, or piloerection, is a clinical sign of encephalitis along with hunched posture, lethargy, and sunken eyes38,43,110,111. Hunching in mice gradually increases with disease progression38,43,112. Another typical sickness behavior in mice is changes in amount of grooming. Grooming was measured only for Group A mice, by recording videos of individual mice in open-field arenas for 10 minutes and measuring time spent performing grooming behaviors. We evaluated limb impairment by timing how long mice clung to an inverted metal grate and how well each limb grasped the grate as described in detail in110,112.iv.\nGait assessment\nChanges in stride have been previously correlated with neurological sequelae in rodents113\u2013115, including disease progression during TMEV infection in mice39. Mice in Groups A and B were evaluated separately, using different methods and equipment as described below.Foot print - Group A: Footprint analysis provides an objective, quantitative evaluation of neurological impairment in rodents39,113\u2013116. To identify changes in stride length, stride width, and overall gait, fore and rear paws of Group A mice were painted red and blue, respectively, with nontoxic paint as previously described39,116. Mice then walked along a strip of white paper inside a defined walkway approximately 7 cm wide by 90 cm long with walls 10 cm tall on each side. The resulting foot prints were scanned electronically and distances between prints were measured using ImageJ US National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD117. Stride lengths and widths for both forelimbs and hind limbs were measured for a minimum of 6 sequential strides, as described previously39. These assessments were performed weekly for 7 consecutive weeks starting at 7 weeks post-infection (p.i.).DigiGait - Group B: We used DigiGait (Mouse Specifics, Boston, MA, USA) for quantitative, noninvasive analyses of various gait parameters, as previously described118,119. DigiGait is especially useful for delineating subtle neurological phenotypes118\u2013121. Measurements were taken at 27 dpi. After the mice underwent an initial training period, we recorded mice walking at a speed of 19 cm/s for a minimum of 6 consecutive strides. For all measurements we included age- and sex-matched control mice for reference. Measurements are presented as average values from both forelimbs and both hind limbs.v.\nRotarod\nMotor impairments were evaluated in Group A mice using rotarod39 at ~7 weeks p.i. Each mouse was placed on a rod (5 cm in diameter; Ugo Basile, model 7650, Varese, Italy). This rod rotated at 4 rpm initially, and every 30 s for a total of 300 s the speed of rotation was increased by 4 rpm. For each mouse, the latency and rod speed at the time the mouse fell were recorded. Each measurement was repeated three times, with a 15 min break between each trial. Average values across strains were used for comparisons; average values for separate sexes for each strain were also evaluated when available.vi.\nOpen field\n\n",
