To characterize the cellular immune response following vaccination in mice, spleen mononuclear cells (MNCs) were isolated at time of necropsy, and used for both 3H-thymidine (3HT) and PKH proliferation assays to determine antigen-specific proliferation in vitro. As observed in cattle, cells isolated from mice solely vaccinated with either QuilA or Al(OH)3 did not show any proliferation following in vitro stimulation with the nASP or pASP (Fig. 4A,E). Although significant proliferation was observed in cells from the pASP+QuilA and nASP+Al(OH)3 vaccinated animals following re-stimulation with the corresponding vaccine antigens (Fig. 4B,C,F), the highest proliferation was again observed in the nASP+QuilA group. Furthermore, exposure of the cells from the pASP+QuilA animals to nASP also resulted in a significant cellular proliferation in comparison to the medium control (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, cells from mice vaccinated with the nASP of which the disulphide bonds were reduced did not show any proliferation after re-stimulation with the reduced antigen (Fig. 4D).",

NK cells are large granular lymphocytes that either become directly activated by pathogens or through interaction with other pathogen-activated immune cells. They were originally named after their ability to spontaneously kill transformed, infected or non-self cells without prior sensitization or activation. Despite their innate origin, there is accumulating evidence that also NK cells can develop long-lived and highly specific memory to a variety of antigens192021. Previous studies also indicate that NK cells are likely to be involved in the natural immune response in cattle following nematode infection. It was already shown that NK cells are important in the proliferation observed in the abomasal lymph nodes during the course of an infection2223. More recently, an antigen-specific proliferation of NK cells was observed in the draining lymph nodes of the small intestine of animals infected with C. oncophora24. Also, analysis of transcriptional changes by qRT-PCR in the abomasal mucosa following Ostertagia infection showed a significant upregulation of the NK cell marker CD33525 and the expression of granulysin and granzyme, both proteins that are typically produced by NK cells18. Furthermore, the flow cytometric analyses performed in this study showed that NK cells represented roughly 15% of the total abomasal lymphocyte population following infection.",

Similar to the O. ostertagi ASP, the bioactivity of Ov-ASP-1 was completely lost after denaturing the protein by boiling26. It is also interesting to note that secreted protein(s) of the human hookworm Necator americanus selectively bind to NK cells and induced IFN-\u03b3 production and that this process is dependent on the presence of the cytokines IL-2 and IL-12, likely secreted by activated antigen-presenting cells2930.

In case of the O. ostertagi vaccine it is unclear whether the NK cell activation is necessary to obtain protection or, alternatively, whether the protective capacity of the vaccine is based on the generation of antibodies, potentially interfering with the immunomodulatory activity of the ASP. Over the years, several studies have demonstrated that antibodies can provide protective immunity against gastrointestinal helminths in a direct and/or indirect way31. This protection would hypothetically be achieved through antibody-dependent activation of immune cells in the intestinal mucosa, or by interfering with enzymes and processes required for larval migration, invasion and feeding. In that context, nASP+QuilA vaccinated cattle had an increased amount of nASP-specific IgG1 and IgG2-type antibodies both in blood and in the abomasal mucus. Interestingly, NK cells express Fc\u03b3RIII (CD16) at their surface, which can mediate antibody-dependent cytotoxicity through the recognition of sequestered antigens32. NK cells are highly abundant in the intraepithelial and lamina propria lymphocyte fractions of the abomasum, creating a high chance for effective contact between their CD335+ receptor and the different parasitic life stages of O. ostertagi. Therefore, a possible mechanism of action for NK cells against O. ostertagi could be the recognition of antibody-sequestered nASP and subsequent antibody mediated degranulation. Since NK cells are known to express granzyme B, perforin and granulysin, this could be an interesting link with previous observations on the upregulation of granulysin and granzyme B in animals protected by vaccination against O. ostertagi18.",

The exact mechanisms by which both adjuvants act are not completely understood yet. It has been shown that Al(OH)3 exerts a reservoir function, from which antigen is released slowly for a prolonged period of time33, whereas saponin-based adjuvants such as QuilA exert a more cytolytic function34. Despite the fact that Al(OH)3 is regarded as a Th2 type immune response inducing adjuvant, saponin-based adjuvants seem to induce a stronger antibody response against the vaccine antigen than Al(OH)335, supporting the hypothesis of a possible important role for antibodies in the vaccination-induced protection against O. ostertagi. Additionally, not only the choice of adjuvant, but also the conformation of the antigen has proven to be essential in triggering a protective immune response. Unfolding the ASP completely abolished its ability to induce both NK cell activation and antibody induction. Furthermore, we also showed that the recombinant version of the ASP, expressed in P. pastoris, was less potent in triggering both a cellular and humoral response. These observations indicate that protein folding, potentially in combination with N- and/or O-glycans present on the peptide core, of the native ASP is crucial for its immunoreactivity and that these factors could be at the basis of the inability of recombinant ASP in triggering a similar response. This is in line with the results of inhibition ELISA\u2019s showing that antibodies raised upon nASP vaccination preferentially bind nASP over pASP, suggesting the presence of either different and/or additional epitopes.",

Animal Welfare Directives and VICH Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, and ethical approval to conduct the studies were obtained from the Ethical Committee of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ghent University (EC2009/105, EC 2011/183). Two vaccination studies were carried out in cattle, essentially as previously described1316. The aim of study 1 was to analyse and compare the humoral responses induced by the native and recombinant antigens in combination with QuilA. Twenty-one male crossbreed Holstein calves (6 to 8 months of age) were randomly divided over three groups of 7 animals (QuilA control, pASP+QuilA and nASP+QuilA). A second study was performed to analyse and compare the cellular responses induced by the different versions of the vaccine, i.e. nASP+QuilA, pASP+QuilA, nASP+Al(OH)3, in comparison to control animals vaccinated with PBS. For this study, a Holstein crossbreed population of 16 male helminth-free calves (6 to 8 months of age) was randomly divided into four groups of four animals (PBS control, nASP+QuilA, pASP+QuilA and nASP+Al(OH)3). For both studies, all animals were immunized three times intramuscularly in the neck with a 3-week interval. Control animals received either 750 \u03bcg of QuilA (study 1) or 1 ml of PBS (study 2) per immunization, while the animals of the nASP+QuilA, pASP+QuilA and nASP+Al(OH)3 groups received 30 \u03bcg of antigen in combination with either 750 \u03bcg of QuilA or an equal volume of Al(OH)3 adjuvants (both from Superfos Biosector, Denmark) per immunization. All animals were challenged with a trickle infection of 25,000 L3 larvae (1000 L3/day; 5 days/week, during 5 weeks), which started at the day of the third immunization. Calves from study 1 were euthanized 3 weeks after the last infection, while the animals from study 2 were euthanized immediately after the last infection. Parasitological parameters (i.e. FEC and worm counts) were analysed as described in previous trials1316. Additionally, in study 2, abomasal LNs, abomasal epithelium and lamina propria were also isolated at time of necropsy.",
