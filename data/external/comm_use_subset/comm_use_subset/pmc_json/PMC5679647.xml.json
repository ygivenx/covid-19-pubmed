In recent years, the amount and resolution of the spatio-temporal data have increased vastly due to the advent of \u2018digital epidemiology\u2019 along with the increased use of modern communication devices [1], particularly through the use of mobile phones which drastically improves the tracking of human contacts [2\u20134]. Such data provide unprecedented opportunities for dissecting disease spread at a more localized, individual-to-individual level. The recent West Africa Ebola outbreak (Fig 1) well demonstrated the increasing availability of such data, and, in particular, the GPS location data collected during the outbreak have been shown to be useful in identifying superspreaders and quantifying the impact of superspreading during the outbreak [4].",

Representing unsuccessful contacts at the individual level is computationally challenging due to the need to build an explicit contact network among essentially all individuals in the population. One may consider adapting mechanistic compartmental disease models to accommodate these data. Important examples of these approaches include: 1) a patch-level approach that aggregates data points within pre-defined grids/patches [7\u20139], and 2) a transmission-network-based approach which is essentially a partial-likelihood approach that considers only the infected individuals and ignores the unsuccessful contacts [4, 10\u201312]. Fig 2 presents a schematic illustration of these two approaches. Although the patch-level approach conforms to the desirable SEIR-type mechanistic framework, in which both the successful infectious contacts (E) and unsuccessful contacts (S) are represented, at least on the patch level, the aggregation of data points can be arbitrary and it inevitably degrades the data resolution necessary for inferring, for example, the individual-to-individual transmission. The transmission-network-based (partial-likelihood) approach, on the other hand, preserves the \u2018point nature\u2019 of the data but fails to conform to the mechanistic framework by completely ignoring the general (susceptible) population and its relation to the infected class. Although the latter has been shown to be useful for sampling the relations among infections (e.g. the transmission tree), it is inadequate for the purposes of complete forward epidemic prediction which needs to take into account the general (susceptible) population [4].",

However, it is not straightforward to integrate them with a mechanistic compartmental disease model such as the SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) model. In particular, it is difficult to formulate conditional intensities for a spatio-temporal point process directly for the observations that respects the mechanistic modelling assumptions. If one observes the transitions made by individuals from the E to I classes and from the I to R classes then it may be natural to consider a marked spatio-temporal point process where points represent the transitions from E to I and marks quantify the subsequent sojourn time in the I class. Calculation of intensities conditional on the observation history, necessary for the construction of the likelihood, is difficult due to the transitions from E to I being unobserved. Other approaches which do not utilize the full likelihood (e.g., contact-type partial-likelihood approach [13, 14] and likelihood-free ABC approach [15]) may also be pursued. There also have been advances for more efficient parameters inference of certain classes of spatial models\u2014for example, [16] proposes a double Metropolis-Hastings sampler for certain spatial models with intractable normalizing constants. Nevertheless, there is still a need of developing new statistical frameworks which allow for both full-likelihood-based model inference and, importantly, a statistically and biologically interpretable forward-prediction machinery that naturally integrates with mechanistic disease models and the general susceptible population.",

Multiple-level baseline transmissibility \u03b2i, i = 1, 2, \u2026 may also be considered, for example, to represent heteregeneous transmissibility among different age groups (see later Example: Application to the Ebola Outbreak Data). The parameter \u03c9 quantifies the efficacy of controls that serves to reduce disease transmissibilty [21, 22]. Note that primary/background infection can be accommodated by adding a permanent infectious source presenting an additional rate \u03b1 (i.e. the total Poisson rate becomes \u03b1 + \u03b2 \u00d7 exp(\u2212\u03c9t)).",

It is assumed that the probability of the new infection being at a certain distance r and direction \u03b8 away from the source of infection, is determined by the movement patterns of infectious individuals and the density of the susceptible population. Specifically, G = (r, \u03b8) is drawn from a density,\ng(G;\u03b7,s^)=f(r;\u03b7)\u00d7h(\u03b8|r,s^),(2)\nwhere s^ is the population density across the study area. Following Eq 2, the distance r is first drawn from f(r; \u03b7), a monotonically decreasing density function that specifies the likelihood of spatial movement over distance [23\u201325]. Specifically, we assume r follows an Exponential(\u03b7) distribution, i.e.,\nf(r;\u03b7)=\u03b7\u00d7exp(-\u03b7r).(3)\nGiven r, the position of the new infection is determined by a subsequent random draw \u03b8 from h(\u03b8|r,s^), the density of \u03b8 corresponding to the circle with radius r centered at the source of infection. When population density is homogeneous, \u03b8 may be drawn uniformly from 0 to 2\u03c0\u2014i.e., given the homogeneous population density, there is no a\npriori belief that one part of the circle (i.e. the arc) is more susceptible to the occurrence of new infection than another. We consider a more general scenario with varying population density s^. A natural approach in specifying h(\u03b8|r,s^) is to use the population density along the circumference of the circle, denoted by \u03c3(l|r,s^), to account for the effect of heterogeneous landscape, so that\n\u222b0\u03b8\u2032h(\u03b8|r,s^)d\u03b8=\u222b0l\u2032\u03c3(l|r,s^)dl,(4)\nwhere l\u2032 is the arc length corresponding to an arbitrary angle \u03b8\u2032. It is noted that, when the source of infection is the primary/background, r and \u03b8 become irrelevant, and g(G;\u03b7,s^) reduces to the (normalized) population density so that the probability of the new infection occurring in a neighbourhood of a particular point is proportional to the population density at that position.",

In this section we compare our results with the findings of the previous analysis. In particular, we show how a model-based, forward prediction may be made using our methodology. In this section we consider age-specific baseline transmissibility, i.e. \u03b21 for age less than 15 and \u03b22 for age greater or equal to 15. In the forward simulation, the distribution of age (group) for a new infection is assumed to be the empirical distribution of the age groups of the observed data (which may also be estimated from more general demographic data).",

Using our methodology, although we find no significant difference among subgroups of those older than 15, there is still clear evidence that cases less than 15 tend to be most transmissible (Fig 5c). In fact, this age group was found to be the most transmissible in [4]. The median distance of transmission is estimated to be 0.85km [0.01, 6.15], which is about one third of the estimate 2.51km found in [4]. Such a discrepancy may reflect the fact that the heterogeneous (susceptible) population is now taken into account, with the presence of many disease-free areas reducing the likelihood of long-range transmission. A shorter distance of transmission may also be potentially more accurate, considering that the pathogen may have spread predominantly by caring within the community, e.g., through family contacts [36]. Estimates of other model parameters are given in S1 Table, showing broad consistency with the literature [4, 37, 38]. However, it is noted that our estimate of mean infectious period is lower than from cases detected within the clinical care system (e.g. mean infectious period 8d estimated for patients who received clinical care [39]). As discussed in [4], this discrepancy potentially highlights systematic differences between community-based cases and cases notified in clinical care systems, where community-based cases may have progressed more rapidly.",

In particular, as SEIR-type models can be computationally challenging for individual-level spatio-temporal data, new frameworks are needed to accommodate such data in a mechanistic manner. The recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa (2014-2016) highlights the need, in particular, for a statistically sound and computationally efficient framework that is both able to integrate individual temporal and spatial information and, more importantly, perform a more general forward prediction which needs to take into account the general susceptible population [4].",

For example, we have focused on epidemic outbreaks that are mainly attenuated by a time-varying transmissibility e.g. due to controls or seasonal changes of transmissibility. Should susceptible depletion play a key role in attenuating the epidemics, our framework may be modified accordingly\u2014e.g., for a given region, adding a component that specifies the decreased likelihood of occurrence of new infections with increased density of existing infections, to mimic the effect of susceptible depletion. Nevertheless, the effect of susceptible depletion may only be significant on a very local scale such as that of the individual household. Moreover, it does not appear to be a determining factor in controlling the recent Ebola outbreak, at least on the \u2018global\u2019 scale [17] (Fig 6). We have considered random movement patterns of infectious individuals that may be reasonably abstracted by a monotonically decreasing density function [23, 24]. For future work, this assumption may be relaxed to model more complicated scenarios, such as spread of splash-dispersed fungal pathogens [43] in which the spreading distance may also depend on the susceptible population. In this case, one may modify the density for the distance by also taking into account the distribution of susceptible population in the annuli along the radius of the circle centered at a particular source of infection.",

This assumption may be relaxed to allow for more \u201clocalized\u201d transmission rates. For example, a model taking into account the heterogeneity of the susceptible population more explicitly may be obtained by allowing the infection rate for each case to be dependent on the local density of susceptibles by taking an appropriate weighted average of the latter with respect to the kernel function, at the expense of increased computational complexity. When spatial heterogeneity is present at a scale that is fine with respect to the range of transmission, then such an average may exhibit little variability over cases. Nevertheless, we note the ability of our approach to identify a kernel that matches that identified when the full SEIR model is fitted. Moreover, our model appears to be reasonable for the case of the Ebola outbreak (Fig 6).",

Vaccination, for instance, decreases the proportion of susceptibles among the general population, and has an important impact on the geographical spread of viruses (e.g. [44]). The effect of vaccination can be readily incorporated by our framework, for example, by reducing the (effective) susceptible population proportional to the vaccination rate in a particular region. The Ebola dataset we analyzed is likely to be subject to underreporting, which may have resulted in, for example, a biased (lower) estimate of the degree of superspreading [4]. Future work which takes into account the underreporting explicitly may be considered. We hope that our proposed framework can provide an essential step for the systematic modelling of the increasingly available individual-level disease data.",

Compared to global measures such as the Moran\u2019s I, this function determines clustering/dispersion of point data over a range of distances (see S1 Text for more details), without requiring certain aggregation of the points, hence representing a more powerful and informative measure for our context. We consider and compute the L function using the the R package spatstat [42].
