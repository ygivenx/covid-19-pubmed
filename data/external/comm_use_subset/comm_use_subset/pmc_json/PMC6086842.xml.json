Seventy years on it is as relevant today, with an estimated one billion cases of influenza annually, of which 3\u20105 million are severe, causing between 290 000 and 650 000 deaths,3 and even more so given the constant pandemic threat from recent novel zoonotic influenza infections.

Thus from the outset the global network encompassed surveillance of the epidemiology and impact of influenza, sharing of viruses isolated by WHO designated National Influenza Centres (NICs) with WHO Collaborating Centres on influenza (WHO CCs) for antigenic characterisation of the viruses and selection of suitable vaccine viruses, in relation to the manufacture, regulation and administration/distribution of influenza vaccines.",

Thus, revelation of the protein composition of the virus,4 the segmented nature of the virus genome and the structural (sequence) relationships between segments 5 in relation to genetic reassortment, and the antigenic relationships between animal and human influenza viruses,6 as the basis of pandemics,7, 8 were closely associated with the work of members of the WHO network and the WHO CCs in particular. Elucidation of the crystal structure of the haemagglutinin (HA) provided the first clear understanding at the molecular level of antigenic drift,9 of different receptor specificities between human and animal viruses in relation to host range restriction10 and the mechanism of virus entry into a cell, and more generally the mechanism of membrane fusion.11 Other notable spin\u2010offs from research on resistance and immunity to infection were the discovery of interferon12 and the uncovering of the peptide basis of cell\u2010mediated immunity.13\n",

While the structure and relative responsibilities were understood well by the different components of the largely informal autonomous trust\u2010based system, comprising WHO CCs, NICs and ERLs (Essential Regulatory Laboratories), coordinated by WHO through GIP, the persistent threat from H5N1 called for a wider appreciation of its operation and benefits, especially as regards ability to respond in the event of a pandemic. For the first time, governments were faced with the concept of preparing a \u201cpre\u2010pandemic\u201d H5N1 vaccine and stockpiling the vaccine and antivirals for use in the event that the virus became more transmissible and caused an epidemic and possibly a pandemic. While this garnered a concerted effort among public health officials, regulators and vaccine manufacturers as well as among academic scientists towards the development of better vaccines and other antiviral therapies, it also led to much greater government scrutiny of the fairness of the global system, in particular by countries that did not use seasonal influenza vaccine and benefit tangibly from participation in and contribution to GISRS by sharing viruses.",

A key element was the introduction of an Influenza Virus Tracking Mechanism (IVTM) to monitor sharing of IVPP and a requirement to sign a materials transfer agreement (a SMTA\u20102 defined in the PIP Framework21) to receive PIP Biological Material from GISRS, altering the way in which viruses are openly shared within and beyond GISRS. In addition to in\u2010kind contributions of vaccines, diagnostics and antivirals to be made available to WHO for deployment during a pandemic and other contributions also from academic laboratories, pharmaceutical companies make financial partnership contributions (PCs) to be used to support countries to participate in GISRS and help bolster the capacities of developing countries to build pandemic preparedness and response capabilities, thus further strengthening GISRS. While advantageous in terms of support for GISRS and pandemic preparedness, implementation of the PIP FW, overseen by the PIP Advisory Group, with administrative and legal support of the WHO PIP Secretariat, has introduced an important new element, specifically with respect to monitoring the sharing of PIP Biological Materials, into the longstanding successful organisation and operation of GISRS, coordinated by the GIP.",

Bolstered by very active technical support in the provision of protocols and CDC diagnostic reagents for detection of seasonal and zoonotic (novel) infections, all regularly updated, and including training and associated performance evaluation, this momentum is likely to continue. Provision of guidance documents and analysis tools by GIP will continue to enhance the capabilities of laboratories to conduct epidemiological and virological surveillance and evaluate the burden of disease from influenza and how influenza might impact other diseases, essential to develop seasonal vaccination policies.29, 30 A 21% increase in countries with flu vaccine policies between 2006 and 2016, complemented by an 87% increase in global vaccine distribution between 2004 and 2013 bodes well for the future. On the other hand, sustainability is not guaranteed, especially if none of the perceived pandemic threats materialise and resources are judged to be better employed elsewhere. Maintenance of the \u201cbasic\u201d seasonal surveillance capacity of the laboratory network by member states with NICs, independent of financial support from partnership contributions to the PIP FW or other external funding, will be essential and critical to sustain national capability to respond to seasonal epidemics and future pandemics. Surveillance of influenza as part of integrated disease surveillance is likely to become more prevalent as multiple parallel analysis systems become more cost\u2010effective and the sensitivity of point\u2010of\u2010care tests improve.",

Developed at the time of the intergovernmental deliberations on sharing H5N1 viruses, extensive discussions involving a broad range of interests, including government and public health officials, scientists and intellectual property experts, as well as GISRS and WHO, on how best to promote timely sharing of genetic sequence data (GSD) pre\u2010publication, resulted in the GISAID data sharing mechanism, the essence of which is the Database Access Agreement (DAA)35 which governs the sharing of the data in its EpiFlu\u2122 database. The DAA enshrines a code of conduct between providers and users of data which protects the ownership of the data while making it freely available on the proviso that users acknowledge the source of the data and, as appropriate, engage with the originators of the data in the collaborative spirit of GISRS, in a manner consistent with its original intent.37 Its effectiveness is demonstrated by the prompt release of genetic sequences from the first cases of H7N9 zoonotic infection in China in 2013, which enabled the rapid production by synthetic biology of a candidate vaccine virus within a few weeks,38 and in ensuring availability of the latest data for the biannual WHO vaccine consultation meetings (VCMs).39 The close alignment of the principles underlying GISAID's sharing mechanism with the seven key principles for data sharing in a public health emergency enunciated recently by the Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness (GloPID\u2010R)40 illustrates once again how GISRS can lead the way in implementing innovative mechanisms and procedures. GISAID, also a trust\u2010based system, integrates GSD with other clinical, virological and epidemiological data, and takes advantage of the latest advances in rapid gene sequencing technologies. It serves as a good example of sharing GSD in relation to public health emergencies and can perhaps serve as an example for other pathogens such as of Ebola and Zika viruses.41\n",

On past experience, WHO through its GIP can look forward with optimism over the next decade to plan for and address the challenges posed by influenza and other emergent respiratory viruses. WHO and GIP can continue to strengthen GISRS, by, for example, better integration of laboratory and epidemiological data and enhanced intersectoral and institutional collaboration, including public\u2010private partnerships, to maximise analyses and the usefulness of available data for risk management and informing national and global health policy.",

GISRS' broad vision, under the watchful eye of the WHO GIP, should continue to provide leadership in its interaction with global partners and to implement technological advances to better understand factors influencing the adaptive potential and interspecies transmissibility of the viruses and the host response to human infection. It will be essential to retain the fundamental characteristics and collaborative ethos of GISRS as it evolves under the WHO Global Influenza Programme as the front\u2010line defence against influenza in all its forms, and as a pre\u2010eminent example of an integrated global system for combatting infectious disease.",
