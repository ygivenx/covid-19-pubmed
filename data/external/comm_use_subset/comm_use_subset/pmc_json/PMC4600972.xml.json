            "text": "RNF166 is closely related to RNF125, which has been reported to negatively regulate RIG-I- mediated anti-RNA virus signaling by conjugating ubiquitin chains to RIG-I and leading to the degradation of RIG-I by the proteasome23. RNF125 and its homologous proteins RNF114, RNF138, and RNF166 form a subfamily of small C3HC4 RING ubiquitin ligases28, so we investigated whether RNF114/138/166 also play a role in RNA virus-induced IFN-\u03b2 production. We transfected plasmids that encoded RNF114, RNF125, RNF138, and RNF166 into HEK293T cells to perform reporter assays. We found that overexpression of RNF166 but not it\u2019s homologous RNF114, 125, and 138, potentiated Sendai virus (SeV)-induced activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter. However, RNF166 had no apparent effect on the overexpression of cGAS and the STING-induced activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter (Fig. 1A), suggesting that RNF166 specifically enhances RNA but not DNA virus-induced IFN-\u03b2 production. Overexpression of RNF166 can also enhance the transcription of Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) like ISG15 and MX1 (Fig. 1B).",

Two shRNA plasmids (#4 and #5) markedly inhibited the expression of endogenous RNF166 mRNA in HEK293T cells, whereas the #1, #2, and #3 shRNA plasmids had little effect on RNF166 mRNA (Fig. 1C). We found that knockdown of RNF166 significantly inhibited the activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter, transcription of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA, and the secretion of IFN-\u03b2 triggered by SeV infection (Fig. 1D,E). We also generated stable RNF114-, RNF125-, and RNF138-knockdown HEK293T cell pools to determine their functions (Fig. 1F). Consistent with a previous report that RNF125 acts as a negative regulator of the RIG-I-mediated signaling pathway23, knockdown of RNF125 slightly enhanced the SeV-elicited IFN-\u03b2 production compared to the control cell pool, while knockdown of RNF114 clearly enhanced the SeV-induced IFN-\u03b2 production, and knockdown of RNF138 had no appreciable effect (Fig. 1G).",

RNF166 was subsequently shown to co-localize with TRAF3 and TRAF6 in co-transfected HeLa cells (Fig. 2E). Overexpressed RNF166 localized predominantly in the cytosol as dots which were probably aggregates of RNF166 protein.

To dissect the functional role of these domains, we generated three deletion mutants and assessed their ability to up-regulate SeV-induced IFN-\u03b2 production. We found that the presence of an intact RING domain is essential for RNF166 function, as overexpression of a RING deletion mutant (RNF166 \u0394RING) failed to enhance, but rather inhibited the activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter induced by SeV and the overexpression of VISA, while the UIM domain deletion mutant (RNF166 \u2206UIM) had no apparent effect (Fig. 4B,C). Consistently, on infection with NDV-eGFP (Newcastle disease virus-enhanced green fluorescent protein), we found that overexpression of RNF166 in HEK293T cells rendered them remarkably resistant to NDV infection and reduced the levels of NDV-eGFP-positive cells, while the RING deletion mutant had the opposite effect (Fig. 4D); and the same results were obtained when RNF166 or RNF166 \u0394RING were co-expressed with VISA. Also we found overexpression of RNF166 can inhibit the replication of SeV (measured by mRNA level of SeV P protein), while the RING delete mutant enhanced the proliferation of SeV (Fig. 4E). These data indicated that the RING domain is indispensable for the ability of RNF166 to up-regulate cellular anti-RNA virus activity.",

However, the functions of its homologous proteins RNF114, RNF125, and RNF138 in innate immune signaling pathways remain elusive. Here, we report that RNF166 rather than RNF114, RNF138, and RNF125 potentiates the RNA virus-induced production of IFN-\u03b2. Several lines of evidence support this finding. First, overexpressed RNF166 potentiated the SeV- and VISA-mediated induction of IFN-\u03b2. Second, knockdown of endogenous RNF166 by shRNA reduced the RNA virus- and dsRNA analog-induced production of IFN-\u03b2. Third, RNF166 interacted with endogenous TRAF3 and TRAF6, and these interactions were enhanced upon viral infection. Furthermore, we found that the potentiation of the antiviral effect of RNF166 was mediated by enhancing the virus-induced ubiquitination of TRAF3 and TRAF6. Notably, endogenous RNF114 and RNF138 had no apparent effect on the virus-induced ubiquitination of TRAF3 and TRAF6, and this finding may explain why RNF114 and RNF138 do not enhance SeV-induced antiviral activity while RNF166 did.",

These data indicate that, as a dominant-negative mutant, RNF166\u2206RING competes with endogenous RNF166 to bind with TRAF3 or TRAF6, so they cannot be efficiently ubiquitinated and blocks VISA signaling. However, STING has no apparent TRAF-binding motifs that are critical for recruiting TRAFs and can directly recruit IRF3 and TBK1 for activation via its carboxyl terminal region40; this may explain why RNF166 does not potentiate the cGAS- and STING-induced activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter.",
