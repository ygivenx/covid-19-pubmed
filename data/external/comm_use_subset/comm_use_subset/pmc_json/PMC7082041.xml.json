The main functions of capsid are to bind viral RNA, assist in replication and RNA packaging of the virus, and to subvert antiviral activities [8]. Binding of viral RNA is achieved through a highly conserved region between amino acid residues 76 and 116 [9]. Capsid also induces cytopathogenicity by shutting off host transcription. This function has been mapped to the N-terminal domain and is independent of the RNA binding domain [10]. Nuclear export and nuclear localization signals (NES and NLS, respectively) have been found in the N-terminal domain. Furthermore, capsid has been shown to form a complex with host nuclear export karyopherin CRM1 and the nuclear import karyopherins importin \u03b1/\u03b21 [11]. It has additionally been shown that this complex blocks the nuclear pore and prevents nuclear trafficking [11]. The C-terminus is highly conserved amongst alphaviruses and functions as a protease [12]. The protease domain is responsible for cleaving itself from the translating polyprotein [13].",

It is regulated by two classes of enzymes: kinases, which phosphorylate substrates; and phosphatases, which dephosphorylate substrates [15,16]. Protein phosphorylation assists in the life cycle of many viruses, such as the phosphorylation and subsequent cytoplasmic translocation of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) N protein, mediated by the kinases ERK1/2 and GSK3 [17,18]. Additionally, some viruses encode kinases, such as the herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) Us3 kinase, which is crucial for viral pathogenicity by regulating HSV-1 dUTPase activity [19]. Moreover, the phosphorylation of alphavirus proteins have also been shown to be key for functionality, demonstrated by phosphorylation of Sindbis virus (SINV) E2 glycoprotein which is necessary for viral maturation [20] and the hypervariable domain of nsP3 which is important for minus strand synthesis [21\u201323]. We have recently shown that VEEV capsid protein is phosphorylated on T93, T108, S124, and T127 residues and that phosphorylation is in part regulated by the phosphatase Protein Phosphatase 1\u03b1 (PP1\u03b1) [24]. Here, we extended our study to determine the kinase responsible for capsid phosphorylation and to further elucidate the importance of phosphorylation for viral replication and pathogenesis.",

Any potential sites of tyrosine phosphorylation were removed as previous results indicated capsid was phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues. Next, any residues with a score below 0.500 were removed from the analysis because scores below 0.500 indicate less than 50% confidence that the site is actually phosphorylated. The software also listed potential kinases for each residue. Our previous data showed that capsid is phosphorylated on T93, T108, S124, and T127 [24]. NetPhos 3.1 predicted an unknown kinase and protein kinase C (PKC) to be the kinases responsible for phosphorylation of T93, T108, and S124.

Vero cells were infected with VEEV TC-83 (a live attenuated vaccine strain of VEEV) or mock infected. Following infection, cells were lysed and samples were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against VEEV capsid. Western blot analysis was performed on immunoprecipitated samples with antibodies against PKC isoforms \u03b1, \u03b4, \u03bc, and \u03b6. Analysis demonstrated an association between PKC\u03b4 and capsid but no other PKC isoforms tested (Fig 1A). PKC\u03b4 was also found to interact with STAT3, a known PKC\u03b4 interacting partner [26] (S1A Fig). A reverse co-immunoprecipitaion confirmed the interaction of PKC\u03b4 with capsid (Fig 1B), but PKC\u03b4 did not interact with the viral 6K/TF protein (S1A Fig). To determine at what point of the viral life cycle this interaction was most prevalent, cells were infected with VEEV TC-83 and collected at 4, 8, 16, and 24 hours post infection (hpi). Samples were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against PKC\u03b4 and western blot analysis for VEEV capsid was performed. Results indicated the association between capsid and PKC\u03b4 is highest at 16 and 24 hpi (Fig 1B) with a slight interaction observed at 8 hpi. The detection at later time points could, however, be due to increased levels of capsid at later time points making the interaction easier to detect. Furthermore, confocal microscopy was performed to visualize co-localization between VEEV capsid and PKC\u03b4. Cells were either mock infected or infected with VEEV TC-83 and incubated for 16 hours. Cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with antibodies against PKC\u03b4 and either VEEV capsid (Fig 2A) or VEEV E2 (Fig 2B). Consistent with immunoprecipitation results, a clear co-localization between VEEV capsid and PKC\u03b4 was detected. Co-localization analysis of z-stack images was performed and a scatter plot was created comparing the intensities of the red pixels (x-axis) with the green pixels (y-axis) (Fig 2C). The scatter plot shows the intensities of every pixel within the image, the region within the yellow gate and indicated by the arrow corresponds to the regions of interest of which the Pearson\u2019s correlation was calculated (arrows in Fig 2A). A Pearson\u2019s correlation at the regions of interest was 0.86 indicating a relatively strong correlation. Co-localization analysis of E2 and PKC\u03b4 (Fig 2D) using the same gating as the capsid:PKC\u03b4 analysis did not show a strong correlation of co-localization with a Pearson\u2019s correlation of 0.31. Interestingly, localization of PKC\u03b4 in uninfected cells was fairly compact and perinuclear, suggesting localization in the ER/Golgi. However, after VEEV infection PKC\u03b4 localization displayed a more diffuse phenotype. Collectively, these results suggest that VEEV capsid interacts with PKC\u03b4.",

Similar results were observed with virulent BSL-3 VEEV TrD, with ~ 1 log reduction of viral replication at 16 hpi. However, loss of PKC had no impact on eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) or western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV) (Fig 4B). An alignment of the primary amino acid sequences for the capsid proteins of VEEV, EEEV, and WEEV showed that while both serine 124 and threonine 127 are conserved amongst all three viruses only serine 124 is predicted to be phosphorylated in all three viruses. Interestingly, threonine 127 was also not predicted to be phosphorylated in VEEV capsid, but was detected by LC-MS/MS analysis (24). Threonine 93 and 108 were not conserved in EEEV or WEEV.

CLIP-seq analysis of the cytoplasmic VEEV capsid:RNA interactions revealed distinct sites of significant enrichment, including an enriched cluster within the coding region of the GFP fluorophore (as shown in S3 Fig). The precise implications of this interaction, or its biological impact on viral infection are unknown; however, as the enrichment of this site could inadvertently mask the statistical significance of the interaction identification process by reducing the significance of all other viral RNA regions, and all downstream analyses utilized parental TC-83, we elected to censor the region from our downstream analyses. Thus, similarly to what was observed for SINV, distinct viral interaction sites were observed for the VEEV capsid protein and the vRNA (Fig 7C). Interestingly, no significant enrichment was observed at the region of the genome corresponding to the VEEV Packaging Signal (PS). However, it should be noted that a similar phenomenon was observed for SINV (27). Curiously, unlike SINV, VEEV capsid:RNA interactions were observed in both the nonstructural and structural coding regions. Comparative analysis of the molecular composition and structure for the SINV and VEEV Capsid:RNA interaction sites (including those of the GFP fluorophore) fails to identify any particular motif or structural element. Nonetheless; the lack of an identifiable canonical interaction motif may be entirely due to the limited number of interaction sites observed for each virus, rather than a differential set of binding proclivities.",

Ebola virus becomes attenuated in macaques as the genomic copies to PFU ratio decreases [30], whereas increased genomic copies to PFU ratio shows attenuation in Bunyamwera virus [31]. To determine if the mutations in VEEV capsid phosphorylation sites cause attenuation of VEEV TC-83 in vivo, six-week-old female C3H/HeN mice were challenged intranasally with a lethal dose of VEEV TC-83 or VEEV CPD. Mice were monitored for survival over 21 days and were observed daily for clinical symptoms of disease, weight loss, and body temperature. Sixty percent of mice infected with VEEV TC-83 succumbed to infection by 15 days post-infection while 90% of mice infected with VEEV CPD survived the infection (Fig 8A). Furthermore, survivors infected with VEEV CPD showed less severe clinical signs of infection compared to TC-83 infected mice (Fig 8B). Mice infected with TC-83 displayed mild signs of clinical illness (decreased activity, weight loss) by day 3 post-infection and increased in severity (scruffy, hunched, lethargic, significant weight loss) by day 5/6 post-infection. Surviving TC-83 mice recovered by day 11 (Fig 8A). Meanwhile, mice infected with CPD mutant virus displayed mild signs of clinical illness (decreased activity, weight loss) with only 3 of the mice increasing to more severe signs and one mouse succumbing to infection (Fig 8B and S4 Fig). These data suggest that VEEV CPD is attenuated in mice, warranting further study into its potential for a vaccine strategy. However, future studies identifying viral load and distribution of mice infected with VEEV CPD are required.",

PKC is a family of serine/threonine protein kinases that have been implicated in numerous cellular processes including transcriptional regulation, membrane structure modulation, immune mediation and cell growth regulation [32]. PKC has been implicated in several different viral life cycles. Inhibition of PKC\u03b1 causes an increase in dengue virus replication, potentially by acting as a restricting mechanism that regulates dengue virus replication [33]. PKC is also involved in the lytic cycle switch of Epstein-Barr Virus by modulating microtubule depolymerization [34]. Additionally, Hepatitis B virus inhibits PKC\u03b4 causing decreased STAT activation during infection [35]. PKC\u03b4, specifically, has been shown to be involved in HIV-1, SINV, and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus replication [36\u201338]. PKC\u03b4 is a novel isoform of the PKC family of kinases and plays conflicting roles in cell survival and cell death signaling. It is pro-survival and anti-apoptotic during cytokine receptor-initiated cell death, but it also can be a pro-apoptotic protein during DNA damage signaling [39,40]. In our study, we find that PKC\u03b4 regulates VEEV capsid binding to viral RNA.",

A significant decrease of viral titers was observed starting at 8 hpi and continuing for at least 16 hpi after PKC\u03b4 knockdown by siRNA. To more specifically assess the importance of VEEV capsid phosphorylation, a VEEV capsid phosphodeficient mutant on a TC-83 backbone was constructed. Interestingly, the phospho-deficient mutant virus, VEEV CPD, displayed no significant difference in titer when compared to the parental TC-83. These data are contrary to the siRNA data which show a decrease in viral titer after knockdown of PKC\u03b4. These data could indicate that PKC\u03b4 is important in more than one aspect of the viral life cycle and that knockdown of PKC\u03b4 prevents another unknown mechanism of viral replication from functioning properly. It is also possible the phosphorylation of individual residues plays independent roles and PKC\u03b4 is only impacting one or some of the phosphorylated residues. Future studies with viruses containing single mutations and/or double and triple mutant combinations will be necessary to determine the importance of individual phosphorylation sites.",

            "text": "Our results show that knockdown of PKC\u03b4 and mutation of capsid phosphorylated residues decreases the level of phosphorylation on VEEV capsid to almost undetectable levels. We identified the phosphatase responsible for capsid dephosphorylation, PP1\u03b1, in our previous study [24], but no kinase had been identified up to that point. The knockdown of PKC\u03b4 coupled with the drop in capsid phosphorylation strongly suggests that PKC\u03b4 is the kinase responsible for phosphorylating capsid. Our previous data suggest that higher levels of capsid phosphorylation results in less viral RNA binding and it has been shown in the related Togavirus, Rubella virus, that phosphorylation of capsid protein regulates its RNA binding and viral replication [41]. We compared the amount of RNA bound to capsid in either VEEV TC-83 or VEEV CPD and our results indicated that there is more viral RNA bound to capsid in the mutant strain. Coupling these data with our previous study that shows that higher levels of phosphorylation causes less viral RNA bound to capsid, we propose that capsid phosphorylation/dephosphorylation is a cycle that regulates RNA binding (Fig 9). Interestingly, VEEV CPD also displayed a lower genomic copy to PFU ratio and decreased pathogenicity. As VEEV CPD replicated to similar levels as parental VEEV TC83 in vitro, these data suggest that capsid phosphorylation is not necessary for viral replication, but rather regulates viral pathogenesis. The altered pathogenesis may be linked to VEEV CPD producing less non-infectious particles. Multiple viruses have been shown to produce non-infectious particles, including influenza virus [42,43], hepatitis B virus [44], herpes simplex virus [45], and yellow fever virus [46]. The non-infectious particles can be immature viruses, defective interfering particles, or semi-infectious particles with varying roles in pathogenesis ranging from increasing disease, stimulating the innate immune response, serving as a decoy for antibodies, or facilitating recombination [47\u201349]. Our data support a model whereby capsid phosphorylation facilitates the release of non-infectious particles which aid in disease development. Future studies will be aimed at determining how capsid phosphorylation regulates pathogenesis.",

PKC was also predicted to phosphorylate capsid proteins of EEEV and WEEV, but loss of PKC through siRNA transfection had no impact on viral replication. However, there were multiple residues of EEEV and WEEV capsid proteins that are predicted to be phosphorylated and by alternative candidate kinases such as PKA.

After crosslinking whole cell lysates were generated via the addition of RIPA buffer (50mM Tris [pH 7.6], 150mM NaCl, 1.0% NP-40, 0.5% Sodium Deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS). The whole cell lysate was solubilized via repeated passage through a 30-gauge needle, and insoluble materials were removed from the lysate via centrifugation at 16,000xg for 5 minutes at 4\u00b0C. The clarified lysates (~500\u03bcl per reaction) were then incubated with 50\u03bcl packed volume of Protein G Sepharose beads (Pierce) for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0C. The resin was removed by gentle centrifugation at 5,000xg for 5 minutes, and the pre-blocked lysates were transferred to fresh microfuge tubes containing polyclonal anti-Capsid or nonspecific IgG. After 2 hours of incubation at 4\u00b0C on a rotating mixer, 100\u03bcl of Protein G Sepharose was added to each tube and the incubation proceeded as before for another 2 hours. After the formation of the immunoprecipitation complex, RNAse A was added to each tube and the immunoprecipitations were incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature to fragment the bound RNA:Protein complexes. Then the nuclease treated resin was collected via centrifugation at 5,000xg for 2 minutes and washed three with excess volumes of RIPA buffer. After the removal of the contaminating RNAse and RNA fragments, the bound resin was washed twice more with 1xPBS, and the RNA fragments were eluted from the resin by way of Proteinase K digestion. The purified fragments were extracted using TRIzol and precipitated prior to the generation of cDNA libraries using the NEBNext Small RNA Sequencing (NEB) kit, as per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.
