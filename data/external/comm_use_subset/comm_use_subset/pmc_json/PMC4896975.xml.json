Respiratory infections represent a major disease and economic burden worldwide. According to the CDC, influenza virus infection and associated complications are one of the top ten causes of death and result in millions of hospitalizations, costing over $10 billion each year in the USA [1]. Other respiratory virus such as highly pathogenic avian influenza and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) coronaviruses represents ever-present threats to human health globally. Therefore, understanding the factors, both virus-dependent and host-dependent, that regulate the development and severity of respiratory virus infections is critical for both the prevention and treatment of virus-associated disease in the respiratory tract.",

These clinical observations and a growing body of experimental data suggest that the host response to infection rather than direct viral injury of respiratory cells primarily accounts for the clinical and pathologic changes observed during respiratory viral infections. This review, therefore, provides a brief overview of the contribution of host responses to lung pathology during primary acute virus infections rather than pathology caused directly by virus. A detailed, comprehensive comparison of the differences among respiratory viruses is not discussed here.\n",

A radical but ultimately effective response to stop virus replication is for the infected cell to self-destruct via apoptosis although some viruses have evolved strategies to circumvent this [2]. Cytopathology or death by starvation can also result from virus usurpation of host cellular machinery and metabolic processes [2]. Thus, death of infected cells caused directly by virus does play some role in lung pathology during infection. However, much of the clinical sequelae and damage to respiratory cells is a result of the host response to virus and virus-infected cells.",

PRRs that are important for detection of viruses include Toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and other cytosolic virus sensors. Although these receptors are expressed in many types of cells, their activation in respiratory epithelial cells, typically among the first cell types to be infected, is critical in limiting virus spread and alerting the immune system to respond to the infection. Activation of PRRs in these cells by virus infection triggers production and release of type I and III interferons (IFNs) and other proinflammatory mediators (e.g., cytokines, chemokines, and antimicrobial peptides) which initiate the host innate and adaptive immune response. Thus, the degree of PRR activation throughout the respiratory tract ultimately influences the degree of immune cell recruitment and proinflammatory mediator release and subsequently, any immunopathology ensued.",

However, type I IFNs can also directly activate immune cells (e.g., stimulating phagocytosis, dendritic cell maturation) as well as indirectly initiate immune responses (e.g., stimulating the production of chemokines and cytokines by respiratory cells). Intrinsic antiviral activity by type I IFNs includes impairing viral processes such as cell entry, replication, transcription, and translation [4]. Other ISG products can degrade viral nucleic acids or proteins, and many ISGs have yet to be fully characterized.",

Cytokines beyond the IFNs produced by airway epithelium include interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), and granulocyte macrophage-CSF (GM-CSF). IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 are potent proinflammatory cytokines that modulate many types of immune cells. IL-6 facilitates the transition from the innate to adaptive immune response by driving down neutrophil activity while concurrently promoting the recruitment, differentiation, and activity of monocytes and T cells [10]. High IL-6 levels correlate with disease severity, but ablation of IL-6 signaling can lead to uncontrolled virus replication resulting in greater mortality [11]. TNF-\u03b1 impairs viral replication, enhances cytotoxic activity, and cytokine production by leukocytes and activates endothelial cells [12]. Elevated levels of TNF-\u03b1 have been associated with greater morbidity during infection with highly pathogenic virus, and blocking activity of TNF-\u03b1 attenuates immune-mediated pathology [11].",

In addition to its chemotactic properties, CCL5 can also activate T cells, monocytes, NK cells, and DCs promoting a diverse range of immune responses important in controlling virus infection and generating protective immunity [21]. In response to RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) infection, CCL5 may exacerbate inflammation and airway hyperreactivity [22], but deletion of CCL5 in response to influenza virus infection leads to decreased survival in mice [23]. Thus, the levels of CCL5 and type of viral pathogen may determine whether this chemokine is beneficial or detrimental to the host during infection. Respiratory epithelium also produces several other chemokines whose role in protecting or contributing to pulmonary pathology is not entirely clear. While most chemokines released by respiratory cells in response to PRRs, IFNs, and proinflammatory cytokines are not inherently pathogenic in of themselves, redundant or concerted chemotaxis and/or substantial amounts of chemokines may induce excessive leukocyte infiltration and activity, damaging respiratory epithelium.",

In contrast, influenza viruses generally do not infect human endothelium although some effectively replicate within avian endothelium [33]. Therefore, the degree to which endothelial cells contribute to respiratory pathogenesis depends in part on virus tropism and the direct cytopathic effects and cytokine signaling induced by a replicating virus (similar to virus-infected respiratory epithelium). Viruses that infect endothelium may induce more significant lung injury particularly to the alveolar epithelium as a result of increased vascular permeability, edema, and spatial proximity to alveolar cells. Hantavirus, unlike most respiratory viruses, primarily targets microvascular endothelium causing significant microvascular leakage and pulmonary edema [34]; notably, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome\u2014characterized by the filling of the lungs with fluid\u2014has a mortality rate of 38 %.",

Extravasation of immune cells into the lungs from the circulation (or alternatively resident pulmonary DC migration to the draining lymph nodes) is highly dependent on interactions between endothelium and leukocytes. Selectins and adhesion molecules requisite for extravasation are upregulated on endothelium in response to cytokines and growth factors secreted by respiratory epithelium and other neighboring cells [35]. Activated endothelium can also secrete proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as IL-6, MIG/CXCL9, IP-10/CXCL10, type I and type II IFNs, MCP-1/CCL2, and TNF-\u03b1 in response to a virus infection [35]. Inhibition of these processes in endothelial cells in an animal model of lethal influenza infection greatly improved survival [36]. Thus, endothelial cells can facilitate pulmonary injury by heightened leukocyte recruitment and cytokine secretion during a highly pathogenic virus infection. The extent of pulmonary tissue that is infected or damaged and the amounts of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines generated in response, influences the degree of endothelial activation. Ultimately, if uncontrolled or too extensive, these processes can be more damaging than beneficial by recruiting more immune cells that either injure the lungs directly or further propagate inflammation causing a \u201ccytokine storm.\u201d However, insufficient leukocyte recruitment or cytokine production can leave the host susceptible to the virus.",

To prevent inappropriate inflammatory responses to these benign antigens, the lung environment maintains alveolar macrophages in a suppressive state. Negative regulation of alveolar macrophages is accomplished through expression of IL-10, alphaV/beta6 integrin, GM-CSF, CD200 receptor, and pulmonary surfactants by alveolar epithelium [37]. Upon respiratory virus infection, the environment of the alveolar sac quickly changes, and expression of the negative regulators declines. This change in the lung environment coupled with detection of viral antigens and exposure to proinflammatory mediators enables alveolar macrophages to adopt a proinflammatory phenotype, which assists in initiating the host immune response and viral clearance. While the mechanism of protection remains unclear, a growing body of evidence has demonstrated that alveolar macrophages are essential during respiratory viral infection. For example, during RSV infection, they are responsible for early cytokine and IFN production that orchestrates the initial antiviral response [38].",

Neutrophil granules and their contents may also be secreted and released extracellularly.

Neutrophils secrete chemokines that can recruit more neutrophils to the site of inflammation; elevated levels of these chemokines have been associated with more severe lung pathology during infection [17, 19, 20, 43]. Normally neutrophils undergo apoptosis, NETosis (programmed death that results in the formation of NETs), or some other form of cellular death and therefore, inflammatory and cytotoxic activity of this non-specific, potent granulocyte is typically short-lived. Apoptotic bodies and debris left by apoptotic neutrophils is then cleared by macrophages. However, if programmed cellular death of neutrophils or clearance by macrophages is impaired, both respiratory and immune cells may be exposed to damaging or activating factors propagating severe inflammation and acute lung injury [44].",

Neutrophils can suppress T cell responses through the production of suppressive factors such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and arginase 1. In other cases, neutrophils may promote T cell responses through the secretion of IFN-\u03b3 or Ag presentation [40, 45]. The mechanisms that neutrophils utilize to support adaptive immune responses during respiratory viral infections and the impact that these activities have on viral clearance, injury and recovery will need to be investigated further.",

The role of ILC (other than NK cells) during respiratory virus infection is unclear although ILC2 have been reported to facilitate repair after lung injury [46]. NK cells respond to viral infection within a few days producing significant amounts of IFN-\u03b3, killing virus-infected cells, and supporting the adaptive immune response. NK cells are uniquely equipped with a diverse set of receptors that enable them to distinguish normal cells (via inhibitory receptors) from virus-infected or transformed cells (via activating receptors). Activating receptors can recognize viral or tumor antigens\u2014allowing the NK cells to eliminate both infected and tumor cells. In response to chemokines, additional NK cells are recruited within a few days (following neutrophil recruitment but prior to the arrival of effector T cells) and facilitate the transition from the initial, potent inflammatory responses to the more specific adaptive response [47].",

NK cells kill infected cells by releasing cytotoxic granules, engaging death receptors, or utilizing antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)\u2014a process in which antibodies bind viral proteins expressed on the surface of infected cells marking them for elimination [47, 48]. All of these cytotoxic processes promote viral clearance and limit viral spread. However, viruses such as some strains of influenza virus have adapted mechanisms to activate inhibitory receptor signaling, preventing NK-mediated killing [47]. Additionally, despite inefficient viral replication within NK cells, infection of NK cells by some respiratory viruses can induce apoptosis limiting the numbers of NK cells and thus, early cytotoxic functions to control viral dissemination [39]. Depletion of pulmonary NK cells impairs viral clearance and subsequently, leads to more severe disease [47, 49]. NK cells also augment CTL (cytotoxic T lymphocyte) activity through IFN-\u03b3 production [49, 50]. In some viral infections such as RSV, robust production of IFN-\u03b3 by NK cells may contribute to lung injury [51]. Therefore, the type of virus and inoculating dose may influence whether NK cells contribute to lung pathology or not. Finally, NK cells have recently been shown to secrete IL-22 which promotes tissue repair mechanisms [52]. Overall, NK cells appear to primarily have a beneficial role during respiratory viral infection by clearing virus, promoting the CTL response, and facilitating tissue repair.",

CD103+ DCs migrate to the DLN within 2\u20134 days following infection where they efficiently activate both CD4 and CD8 na\u00efve and memory T cells that recognize viral antigens [63, 64]. CD103+ DCs are the most robust stimulators of na\u00efve CD8 T cell activation and elicit protective CD8 immunity because they express receptors for uptake of apoptotic bodies containing virus and efficiently cross-present exogenously acquired antigens [59\u201361]. Both CD103+ and CD11b+ DCs activate na\u00efve CD4 T cells, drive T helper 1 (Th1) responses, and generate effective memory T cell populations to protect against subsequent infections [61]. CD11b+ DCs are also capable of presenting antigen and activating both CD4 and CD8 T cell responses to control respiratory viral infection but differ in a few distinct ways from the CD103+ DC population. CD11b+ DCs arrive a bit later to the draining lymph nodes (5\u20137 days after infection) where they may promote expansion of previously activated effector CD8 T cells and secrete robust amounts of proinflammatory chemokines [59, 61].",

Although pDCs can transport viral antigens from the lungs to the DLN, pDCs are poor stimulators of na\u00efve T cell activation and differentiation due to low expression of costimulatory molecules [59, 61]. Thus, pDCs may be dispensable during certain respiratory viral infections. In response to RSV infection, however, pDCs may suppress inflammation and promote viral clearance, protecting against severe lung injury [62]. The precise functions of pDCs during respiratory viral infections warrant further study to understand how different subsets of pDCs in response to different viruses contribute to viral clearance, modulation of the immune response, and lung injury.",

These mo-DCs can support na\u00efve CD8 T cell activation, Th1 differentiation and cytotoxic effector functions [59]. They can also further propagate an inflammatory response through the production of CXCL10/IP-10 and CCL2/MCP-1, recruiting more inflammatory monocytes to the lungs. During a recall response, mo-DCs may activate cytotoxic responses of memory CD8 T cells and NK cells through cytokine production, enabling swift and efficient pathogen clearance [60]. Elevated numbers of mo-DCs that express CCR2 (chemokine receptor for CCL2) or produce high amounts of TNF-\u03b1 and NO are associated with greater morbidity and mortality in response to viral infection [11, 59, 60]. While blocking mo-DC activity or deficiency in CCR2 improves survival and mitigates severe lung pathology in experimental virus infection, complete depletion of mo-DCs leads to uncontrolled virus spread and more severe disease [11, 59]. Thus, a balanced response by DCs that promotes viral clearance and effector responses without eliciting too much inflammation is probably the key in controlling virus- or immune-mediated lung injury.",

Since inflammatory monocytes depend on CCR2 to migrate to the lungs, a deficiency in this chemokine receptor impairs the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes (and the subsequent populations derived from them) which results in improved survival and diminished lung pathology [11, 59]. However, a defect in the CD8+ T cell response and viral clearance may also occur when the CCR2+ population is completely eliminated. An attenuated rather than complete deletion of the inflammatory monocyte response has been shown to allow effective viral clearance while limiting inflammatory and immune-mediated damage to the lungs [11, 63].

Patient monitoring during respiratory viral infection corroborates this, as upper respiratory illness precedes any LRT (lower respiratory tract) symptoms. Among respiratory viruses, influenza viruses, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV are commonly capable of spreading into the bronchi and bronchioles in otherwise healthy individuals. However, in infants and young children, RSV frequently infects small conducting airways and is a leading cause of pediatric hospitalization worldwide [74]. Enterovirus d68 is also capable of rapid progression to the conducting airways and gained particular notoriety in 2014 after an outbreak in the USA resulted in significant pediatric hospitalization with severe respiratory compromise and increased mortality.",

However, because of the progressively decreasing diameter of LRT conducting airways, inflammation and injury in this compartment\u2014e.g., desquamation of airway epithelial cells in response to RSV or airway epithelial cell hyperplasia during influenza infection\u2014results in more severe compromise of respiratory function. The absence of ciliated epithelial cells in the LRT limits the expulsion of mucus, proteinaceous fluid, bacteria, and cellular fragments from these airways. This is compounded by enhanced epithelial mucus secretion, vasculature leak, edema, mucosal inflammation, and epithelial sloughing. The influx of inflammatory cells in response to signals from infected epithelium and tissue resident innate immune cells increases edema, vascular congestion, and tissue swelling further limiting air passage through smaller airways. The buildup of edematous fluid, mucus and fibrin plugs in small bronchi and bronchioles can restrict airflow to terminal airways further preventing efficient gas exchange. Increased pressure within the blood vessels leaks more fluid into the airspaces. As all these factors build up in the already restricted bronchi and bronchioles, they begin to clot and form plugs that prevent gas exchange. This manifests clinically as wheezing and shortness of breath. In serious cases, this can lead to difficulty in breathing which requires oxygen therapy. Typically with supportive care, bronchitis and bronchiolitis will resolve in a few days without lasting effects.",

The terminal airways are the site of gas exchange and make up the majority of the airway surface of the lung. During infection, loss of tight junctions, vasculature leak, buildup of edematous fluid and fibrin in the alveolar airspaces can result in necrosis of the alveolar cells and hyaline membrane formation. If severe, these changes can lead to diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), manifested clinically as ARDS and respiratory failure. Inflammatory processes and immune responses as described previously compromise the function and properties of terminal airways and terminal airway epithelial cells in a fashion analogous to that of conducting airways. Furthermore, a loss of surface tension and surfactant resulting in alveolar collapse represent additional threats to pulmonary function in the terminal airways. The terminal airways of survivors of acute viral pneumonia can result in alteration of pulmonary elasticity due to organization of inflammatory processes during the resolution phase which may have lasting consequences and put the host at risk for superinfections [72, 73, 75]. Although not discussed here, bacterial superinfection or co-infection are important sequelae of virus infection in the LRT particularly during influenza virus infection.",
