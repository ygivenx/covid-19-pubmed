However, similarity measures based on genomic/protein sequence or protein structure could be misleading when dealing with species very distant to known, annotated species. Other approaches are based on the fact that viruses undergo mutational and evolutionary pressures from the host. For instance, viruses could adapt their codon bias for a more efficient interaction with the host translational machinery or they could be under pressure of deaminating enzymes (e.g. APOBEC3G or HIV infection). All these factors imprint characteristic signatures in the viral genome. Several techniques have been developed to extract these patterns (e.g., nucleotide and dinucleotide compositional biases, and frequency analysis techniques [3]). Although most of these techniques could reveal an underlying biological mechanism, they lack sufficient accuracy to provide reliable assessments [4], [5]. A relatively similar approach to the one presented here is DNA barcoding. Genetic barcoding identifies conserved genomic structures that contain the necessary information for classification.",

Specifically, if the data largely consist of nearly-similar viral sequences (e.g. different sequence reads from the same virus), the learned ADT model would overfit to insignificant variations within the data (even if 10-fold cross validation were employed), making generalization to new subfamilies of viruses extremely poor. To check for this, we hold out viruses corresponding to a particular subfamily (see Tables S1 and S2 for subfamily annotation of the viruses used), run 10-fold cross validation on the remaining data and compute the expected fraction of misclassified viruses in the held-out subfamily, averaged over the learned ADT models. Tables 1 and 2 list the mean classifier validation error and number of viruses for subfamilies in Picornaviridae and Rhabdoviridae. Note that the Picornaviridae data used consist mostly of Cripaviruses; thus, the high misclassification rate when holding out Cripaviruses could also be attributed to a significantly lower sample size used in learning. The poorly classified subfamilies contain a very small number of viruses, showing that the method is strongly generalizable on average.",

It is interesting to point out that most of these motifs are found in regions with an essential biological function. For instance, the motif \u2018DDLGQNPDGEDC\u2019 occurs in a highly conserved region in the 2C protein [11]. The 2C protein functions as ATPase and GTPase [12], [13], is involved in membrane-binding [14], [15] and RNA-binding activities [16]. In particular, this motif forms part of a larger NTP-binding pattern that is found not only in picornaviruses but in DNA viruses (papova-, parvo-, geminiviruses, and P4 bacteriophage) and RNA viruses (coma- and nepoviruses). While genes coding for these proteins occur in a variety of viruses, this specific motif aligned strongly with proteins from vertebrate viruses like human cosavirus, saffold virus and Theilers murine encephalomyelitis virus. The -mer \u2018AHLKDELRKKEK\u2019 occurs in a region coding for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, a protein found in all RNA viruses essential for direct replication of RNA from an RNA template. This motif strongly aligned with proteins from hepatitis A virus, Ljungan virus and rhinovirus isolated in humans and ducks, while the -mer \u2018AGKTRVFSAGPQ\u2019 occurs in a functionally similar region for invertebrate viruses. Finally, the -mers \u2018ASAFHRGRLRIV\u2019 and \u2018KVQVNSQPFQQG\u2019 occur in regions coding for viral capsid protein. This motif strongly aligned with proteins from Human parechovirus, Drosophila C virus and Cricket paralysis virus. Variations in the amino acid sequence of these proteins are important both for determining viral host- specificity and contributing to antigenic diversity. For Rhabdoviridae, the motif \u2018GLPLKASETW\u2019 is found highly conserved in the RNA polymerase in the L protein of plant viruses (see Figures S1, S2).",

Thus, given that partial genomic sequence is normally the only information available, we could achieve quicker bioinformatic characterization by focusing on the selection and amplification of these highly predictive regions of the genome, instead of full genomic characterization and contiguing.
