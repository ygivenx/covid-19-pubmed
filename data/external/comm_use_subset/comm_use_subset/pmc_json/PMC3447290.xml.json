Numerous studies report the similar finding of higher risk for influenza associated complications and hospitalizations among those with different chronic diseases [7, 8]. The US CDC clinical case series among patients hospitalized with A(H1N1) infection showed that 67% of patients had underlying medical condition [9]. All these emphasize the public health importance of influenza vaccination among persons from high risk groups (such as pregnant women and patients with chronic diseases). As our study showed, none of the patients with influenza associated deaths were vaccinated. Influenza vaccine is available at the vaccination centers throughout the country, but it is underutilized and only small proportion of the population is usually vaccinated. No systematic approach is used to vaccinate high risk groups and health care workers. Besides, in all fatal cases the institution of antiviral therapy was delayed beyond the 48 hour threshold, possibly contributing to the grim outcome. Early antiviral treatment when indicated should be advocated among primary care physicians to promptly initiate the therapy in order to avoid complications and reduce the lethal outcomes.",
