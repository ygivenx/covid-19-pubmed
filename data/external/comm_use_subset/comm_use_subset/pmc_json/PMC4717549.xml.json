            "text": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic progressive inflammatory demyelinating disease of the CNS. Pathological studies using autopsy material from patients with MS demonstrate the presence of inflammatory cells and their products in the characteristic brain lesions (plaques) associated with this disease. These and other data generated from animal models of MS have led to the generally accepted hypothesis that the disease is mediated by pathogenic leukocyte responses directed against myelin antigens leading to chronic inflammation and ultimately to a broader neurodegenerative process [1\u20134]. At the vascular level, migrating inflammatory cells release cytokines thought to induce endothelial activation which further promotes leukocyte migration [5, 6]. With continued recruitment and infiltration of increased numbers of leukocytes, there is disruption and dissolution of the intact endothelium [6\u20138]. Loss of endothelial function disrupts the supply of oxygen and glucose to the nearby tissue promoting metabolic stress [9\u201311]. Bioenergetic imbalance at the vascular level results in a loss of tissue homeostasis. It has been suggested that changes in metabolic homeostasis in MS may share some similarity to that observed in hypoxia/ischemia and has been described as a \u201cvirtual hypoxia\u201d [12, 13]. Thus, therapeutic intervention aimed at the restoration of vascular and metabolic homeostasis should be beneficial in the treatment of MS.",

            "text": "In the brain, maintenance of metabolic homeostasis is the result of a coordinated effort between the cellular constituents of the neurovascular unit (pericytes, endothelial cells, astrocytes, and neurons) [14\u201316]. These cells make fine-tuned regulatory adjustments that promote survival and maintain the balance between oxygen and glucose availability and neuronal metabolic demand. In response to stress, the brain initiates a number of endogenous adaptive mechanisms that result in a continuous matching of tissue oxygen with capillary density. Adaptive angioplasticity is induced by exercise conditioning [17\u201319], memory, and learning [20, 21] and upon exposure to mild 10 % oxygen stress [14, 22]. We have extensively studied endogenous adaptation to mild oxygen stress [6, 23, 24]. Exposure to 10 % oxygen is comparable to that encountered at moderate high altitude. Endogenous adaptation to low oxygen is in essence an acclimatization to mild hypoxic stress that promotes tissue survival. We have shown that acclimatization to mild hypoxia ameliorates the signs and symptoms of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-peptide-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) [25]. Exposure of animals to chronic mild hypoxia on the same day of immunization significantly delayed the onset and severity of clinical symptoms. When animals were subjected to chronic mild hypoxia following the appearance of clinical symptoms, chronic inflammation was suppressed [25]. Histological evidence of decreased infiltration of leukocytes was observed in both protocols. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1\u03b1) was induced in the spinal cord in EAE associated with infiltrating leukocytes and in vascular pericytes in hypoxia-treated animals. However, the exact mechanism responsible for the therapeutic efficacy in EAE is not yet known.",

            "text": "In the present study, we have investigated the potential mechanisms involved in the amelioration of EAE. We have questioned whether exposure to chronic mild hypoxia altered immune mechanisms responsible for induction and/or perpetuation of disease activity in MOG-peptide-induced EAE. Hypoxia significantly delayed the onset of the signs and symptoms of EAE associated with decreased histological evidence of inflammatory activity in the spinal cord. Decreased evidence of leukocyte infiltration was not due to delayed peripheral sensitization of MOG-reactive lymphocytes as splenocytes isolated from MOG-immunized mice exposed to hypoxia exhibited a similar MOG-induced proliferative capacity as splenocytes from EAE animals exposed to normal levels of oxygen. Amelioration of disease did, however, correlate with changes in the cytokine-secreting phenotype of the T-cell subsets. Decreased infiltration of cluster of differentiation (CD)4+ cells along with the increased number of regulatory CD25+FoxP3+ T cells found in the hypoxia-exposed mice suggest a possible mechanism for the therapeutic potential of adaptive chronic mild hypoxia in EAE.",

Briefly, mice were perfused to eliminate leukocytes from the vasculature, whereupon the brain and spinal cord were collected to recover infiltrating cells. Following vascular perfusion, tissues were minced in HBSS (HyClone, S. Logan, UT) and digested filtered through a 70-\u03bcm nylon mesh cell strainer using a rubber policeman. The resulting slurry was digested for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C in HBSS supplemented with 0.2 mg/ml collagenase type I (Sigma-Aldrich, St Luis, MO), 5000 U/ml DNase I (Invitrogen, NY), 1 mg/ml dispase (Invitrogen), and 0.025 % trypsin to obtain a single-cell suspension. Following enzyme neutralization, cells were layered onto a discontinuous OptiPrep (Fisher) gradient and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 15 min at room temperature in a swinging bucket rotor. After centrifugation, myelin debris was carefully aspirated and the cell interface was collected. Following extensive washes and incubation in Fc block (BD Biosciences, CA) to minimize nonspecific Ab binding to FcRs, cells were stained with directly conjugated Abs for the four-color FACS to detect PMNs and macrophages (CD11b+, CD45high) and microglia (CD11b+, CD45low-intermediate). To enumerate EAE-associated T-cell infiltrates, cells were analyzed using antibodies to CD3, CD4, and CD25. For the FoxP3, staining cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1 % saponin before incubating with the antibody. All Abs were purchased from BD Biosciences. Cells were analyzed using a BD FACSAria with the compensation set based on the staining of each individual fluorochrome alone and correction for autofluorescence with unstained cells.",

Evidence of systemic adaptation to the stress stimuli is observed as early as 4\u20136 h and structural evidence by 7 days. By 3 weeks, there is a near doubling of vascular density (Fig. 1a\u2013c). The adaptive response to hypoxia is protective and important to tissue survival and plasticity. In our first publication, we questioned whether mild oxygen stress altered EAE [25]. We found that induction of the stress response was protective (28). In this paper, we further define the mechanism of action. MOG-immunized and sham-immunized mice were housed at 10 % oxygen in normobaric hypoxia chambers or on the bench top next to the chambers for 0\u201321 days from the day of immunization. Animals were scored daily for evidence of clinical disease using a five-point scoring scale. Animals were weighed, and blood samples taken for hematocrit. Spinal cord and brain tissue samples were obtained on 0, 7, 14, and 21 days post-immunization. Vascular density in the spinal cord was determined in immunized mice exposed to normoxic conditions and immunized animals exposed to 10 % low oxygen. Results confirmed previous studies [25] and indicated that vascular density is somewhat reduced in immunized normoxic mice when compared to sham-immunized animals. Exposure to mild hypoxia in treated immunized animals resulted in increased vascular density, but the total numbers of vessels per field was less than sham-immunized hypoxia-treated animals (Fig. 1d\u2013f). Exposure to hypoxia on the same day as immunization induced a statistically significant (p < 0.01) delay of disease onset (Fig. 2a). Hypoxia-treated immunized animals ultimately developed disease although the severity of diseases was somewhat variable. Disease incidence was similar (80 to 90 %) in both immunized animal groups.",

To answer this question, we evaluated tissue hypoxia following administration of a novel hypoxia marker pimonidazole [27]. Pimonidazole binds to thiol-containing proteins specifically in hypoxic cells. Hypoxic cells can be visualized and recognized by immunohistochemical detection of pimonidazole using a mouse monoclonal antibody. Pimonidazole was injected at the indicated time points and tissue harvested. When animals were exposed to hypoxia for 24 h, we found very few pimonidazole-positive cells after. Levels were comparable to normoxic animals. After continued exposure to low oxygen for 1 or 2 weeks, the number of pimonidazole-positive cells decreased (Fig. 2b). In EAE-induced animals, pimonidazole staining was detectable in splenocytes and infiltrating cells of spinal cord sections at the peak of disease (Fig. 2c, d) indicating that induction of the inflammatory response increased evidence of tissue hypoxia. Exposure of EAE animals to 10 % oxygen decreased the number of positively staining cells (Fig. 2c, d). Reduced tissue hypoxia correlated with increased vascular density. These results indicate that in vivo exposure to chronic mild hypoxia does not further increase tissue hypoxia. Rather, they suggest that adaptation to a mild hypoxic stress dampens the intensity of pimonidazole staining in treated animals.",

Similar results are observed in the normobaric hypoxia model used in these studies.

It has been shown that IL-10 is produced by T cells [30] and macrophages [31] under hypoxic conditions and promotes angiogenesis [31, 32]. However, contradictory results are presented by the studies that evaluated its role in MS [33, 34] and EAE [35], suggesting a diverse and more complex role of IL-10 in CNS inflammation. In our study, following exposure to the chronic mild hypoxia, the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was induced in the spinal cords of sham-immunized mice as well as MOG-peptide-immunized mice. Interestingly, IL-10 was maintained at high levels in the sham-immunized mice during all time points investigated, while its levels gradually decreased in both hypoxic and normoxic EAE mice (Fig. 6c). Since IL-10 was induced under both hypoxic and inflammatory conditions but declined in the inflammation while staying high in hypoxic mice over the course we examined, IL-10 production is possibly regulated by multiple and complex factors. On the other hand, it is well established that the chemokine CXCL13 is found at high levels in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with MS [36, 37] and reported to promote EAE [38, 39]. As expected, CXCL13 was found at low levels in the plasma of hypoxia-treated sham-immunized mice at 7 days pi (Fig. 6d). Hypoxia-treated MOG-immunized mice exhibited CXCL13 levels that while higher than sham-immunized mice were significantly lower than untreated EAE animals. Levels ultimately increased in hypoxia-treated immunized mice. Taken together, these results suggest that changes in the cytokine and chemokine repertoire during the early stages of disease may have a profound effect on the disease induction.",

The number of microglia, resident antigen-presenting cells of CNS, and infiltrating myeloid cells neutrophils/macrophages in the spinal cords was determined. Cell populations were distinguished by phenotypic expression of cell-specific markers CD11b and CD45. Microglia are CD11b+CD45low, while neutrophils and macrophages are CD11b+CD45high expressing cells (Fig. 7a\u2013c). At 7 days post-immunization, CD11b+CD45high expressing cells from both treatment groups could not be detected in spinal cords (Fig. 7b). However, significant numbers were present by day 14 (Fig. 7b) confirming in part the work of other investigators [40, 41]. The percentage of CD11b+CD45high cells that had infiltrated into the spinal cord of hypoxia-treated MOG-immunized mice was significantly less than seen in normoxic EAE mice (Fig. 7b). On the other hand, under hypoxic conditions, percentages of CD11b+CD45low microglial population were increased in hypoxic EAE compared to normoxic EAE, especially at day 14 post-immunization (Fig. 7b, c). Since there were more cells infiltrated in the spinal cords of normoxic EAE mice, the absolute numbers of the CD11b+CD45low microglia population were found not significantly different between the hypoxic and normoxic EAE animals (Fig. 7c). A recent study shows that resident microglia not infiltrating monocytes help to clear the debris in EAE [42]. Therefore, we suggest that and increased number of microglia under hypoxic conditions may have a beneficial effect in EAE pathogenesis. Whether hypoxic conditions also affect the activation level of these cells remains to be determined.",

            "text": "In the brain, metabolic homeostasis is finely tuned and maintained by the cellular constituents of the neurovascular unit (pericytes, endothelial cells, astrocytes, and neurons) [14\u201316] and is essential for the survival of neurons and the other resident cells of CNS. To achieve balance, endogenous mechanisms have been developed to continuously match oxygen utilization and demand to capillary density. As such, structural adaptations that result in vascular remodeling have been shown to underlie endogenous adaptation to oxygen stress and are thought to promote tissue survival and plasticity [10, 43]. We questioned whether an endogenous adaptive mechanism induced in response to mild stress would alter inflammatory mechanisms in EAE and neurodegenerative disease. In this study, adaptive vascular remodeling was assessed by the up-regulation of hypoxia-responsive elements and evidence of increased vascular density in exposed animals. Both sham-immunized and MOG-immunized animals respond to mild hypoxia associated with an increase in expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and the HIF-1-dependent genes such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF promotes survival of endothelial cells in in vivo and in vitro [44] and induces angioplasticity [44] increasing vascular density. HIF-1\u03b1 was induced in both MOG-immunized mice, MOG-immunized mice plus hypoxia, and sham-immunized mice plus hypoxia. However, the specific cellular localization was significantly different in the experimental groups. HIF-1 cellular localization in healthy mice exposed to mild hypoxia is associated with pericytes, glial cells, and ultimately neurons. In MOG-immunized animals housed under normoxic conditions, HIF-1\u03b1 expression was confined to the infiltrating leukocyte populations in plaque areas confirming reports by others [25, 45]. Expression of HIF-1\u03b1 in immunized animals exposed to low oxygen was associated with a population of cells evenly distributed within the spinal cord. Preliminary evidence suggests that at least a proportion of these cells may be vascular pericytes. Upon exposure to mild hypoxia, pericytes migrate from their microvascular location and proliferate before renewing coverage of newly formed vessels. Pericyte responses to chronic mild hypoxia are discussed in more detail in a review by Dore-Duffy and LaManna [14]. In response to chronic mild hypoxic stress, HIF-1\u03b1 is stabilized and can in turn bind to hypoxia-responsive elements (HREs) that regulate the transcription of target genes, including those encoding erythropoietin, glucose transporters, glycolytic enzymes, antimicrobial factors, and the angiogenic factor VEGF. Stabilization of HIF-1\u03b1 is an early event in the adaptive response to low oxygen that leads to a cascade of HIF-1-dependent and HIF-1-independent events that culminates with increased vascular density by 2\u20133 weeks. The transient expression of signaling molecules in this cascade and that hypoxia did not alter T-cell peripheral sensitization may account for the fact that animals eventually developed disease. HIF-1 levels can also be regulated by a number of signaling pathways important in immune responses as well, notably by those of NF\u03baB and STAT3 [46].",

Vascular cuff formation is associated with evidence of BBB damage and undoubtedly compromised vascular homeostasis. Recently, Davies et al. [49] has shown pimonidazole staining in the spinal cords of EAE-induced rats. In our study, we found that pimonidazole staining was restricted to splenocytes and leukocytes infiltrating the spinal cord in MOG-immunized EAE mice. We further show that endogenous adaptation to chronic mild hypoxia reduced pimonidazole staining in EAE mice and produced a clinical benefit in EAE. In the Davis study, induction of hyperoxia did not significantly alter clinical disease in EAE in rats. They interpreted their studies to indicate that hypoxia was detrimental and necessary for the development of disease and suggested that hyperoxia may be beneficial as a therapeutic modality in MS. However, they did not distinguish between endogenous and inflammatory-mediated hypoxia. Hyperoxygenation of hypoxic tissue has been shown to increase cellular oxidative stress and further induce tissue damage [50]. Following exposure to chronic mild hypoxia, adaptation is associated with increased vascularity and restoration of metabolic homeostasis. Therefore, adaptation is protective. These results might explain the lack of clinical benefit from hyperoxia as reported by Davies et al. [50].",

Glut-1 (a glucose transporter), hexokinase 2, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, enolase 1, pyruvate kinase muscle, and lactate dehydrogenase [52, 53] are inducted in T cells. On the other hand, numerous nonhypoxic stimuli including T-cell receptor (TCR) activation [54], nitric oxide, lipopolysaccharides, and infectious microbes can result in HIF-1\u03b1 up-regulation even under normoxic conditions [55] suggesting that HIF-1 may play multiple roles in leukocytes [51]. It will be important to study the effect of hypoxia as well as EAE using animals with targeted HIF-1 deficiency. Studies by others suggest that HIF-1 modulates T-cell differentiation towards Th17 cytokine-secreting phenotype. Decreased HIF-1\u03b1 resulted in diminished Th17 development but enhanced T-regulatory cell differentiation protecting mice from autoimmune neuroinflammation [52]. Clambey et al. [53] also showed that HIF-1\u03b1 induced FoxP3+ Tregs during inflammation. Similarly, we found in our EAE model CD4+ cells were significantly decreased, while the CD4+CD25+FoxP3 Tregs subset was higher in the spinal cords of EAE mice exposed to chronic mild hypoxia when compared to normoxic EAE mice. MOG-specific Th17 responses were found delayed. Thus, exposure to low oxygen appeared to alter key inflammatory pathways important in EAE pathogenesis.",

            "text": "For many years, Th1 cells were deemed responsible for the initiation of autoimmune demyelination. IL-17-secreting cells are also considered a critical effector population in autoimmune demyelinating disease. IL-23 polarizes IL-17-secreting myelin-reactive CD4+ T cells. These cells are highly encephalitogenic upon transfer into na\u00efve syngeneic recipients [1, 56, 57]. Recently, more focus was on Tregs, since it has been shown that there was a resistance to autoimmune demyelination in mice reconstituted with CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells [28, 58, 59], and Tregs were correlated with the reduced inflammation in EAE [60]. These studies suggested that development of EAE is due to the balance between encephalithogenic and suppressor cells, and adaptation to mild hypoxia favors the induction of suppressor cells. In addition to T cells, chronic exposure to mild hypoxia modulated inflammatory mediators in favor of anti-inflammation. In our studies, we found anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was induced and the inflammatory chemokine CXCL13 was attenuated in sham-immunized animals exposed to hypoxia and during the early phases of hypoxic EAE. CXCL13 has been shown to be detrimental both in EAE and MS [38, 61]. Its levels increase at the onset of MS in a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) [36, 62], increasing further with exacerbations in RRMS [61] regarded as a biomarker of inflammation in MS [61, 63].",
