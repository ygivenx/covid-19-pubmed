ALS is a highly heterogeneous disorder, with phenotypic variability involving a number of clinical aspects such as site of onset, age of onset, rate of progression, nonmotor involvement and response to therapy (Beghi et al., 2011). This makes it difficult to decipher pathogenesis and to develop therapeutic strategies, also because biomarkers that reflect heterogeneity and may be useful for stratification are missing. A combination of genetic and environmental/exogenous modifying factors are believed to underlie this variability. The identification of the pathways affected by the modifying factors is of great interest, as they may be targets of therapeutic intervention.",

The majority of ALS patients have disease onset between 55 and 75 years of age, however patients with an age of onset <55 years and >75 years do exist and represent, respectively, the 22% and the 16% of all patients, as recently reported in a large multicenter Italian study (Calvo et al., 2016). Several factors, both genetic and environmental/exogenous, have been reported to modify age of onset in patients and animal models of ALS. FUS mutations have been frequently associated with early-onset disease in familial and sporadic cases (Chi\u00f2 et al., 2009; H\u00fcbers et al., 2015). Earlier onset of ALS has been also observed in soldiers and professional soccer players (Haley, 2003; Chi\u00f2 et al., 2005; Pupillo et al., 2012). In these patients, an anticipated onset might be linked to heavy physical exercise, repeated trauma, and/or exposure to as yet unknown toxic agents in genetically predisposed individuals (Beghi and Morrison, 2005; Pupillo et al., 2012; Beghi, 2013). A mutant SOD1G93A mouse model of ALS on a 129Sv genetic background has an earlier age of onset than a SOD1G93A mouse model on a C57BL6 genetic background despite an equal expression of the mutant protein (Marino et al., 2015). These mice have also faster disease progression and an intrinsic marked down-regulation of specific pathways involved in mitochondrial function and protein quality control (Nardo et al., 2013, 2016; Marino et al., 2015). Conversely, ApoE2 polymorphism and lower EPHA4 expression have been correlated with delayed age of onset in ALS patients (Li et al., 2004; Van Hoecke et al., 2012). Moreover, in mutant SOD1 mice female showed a later onset than male and this delay further increased with exercise (Veldink et al., 2003).",

            "text": "Summarizing, different combinations of intrinsic and exogenous factors, that can be hardly discerned, may lead to an anticipated or a delayed onset of the disease. We wanted to test whether or not modifying factors are converging into common pathogenic pathways leading either to an early or a late disease onset. This would imply the identification of phenotypic biomarkers, that can distinguish the two populations of ALS patients, and of relevant pathways to consider in a therapeutic intervention. Toward this aim a significant cohort of incident ALS patients with either early (<55 years of age) or late (>75 years of age) disease onset was recruited from population-based Italian registries, and several analyses were performed. We found that an epigenetic rearrangement such as whole-blood DNA methylation could not distinguish the two groups of ALS patients (Tremolizzo et al., 2014). However, difference in plasma amino acid levels were observed in relation to the age of onset (Cecchi et al., 2014). In this work, we identified protein phenotypic biomarkers in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of the same cohort of patients indicating that protein levels in PBMC could be good biological correlates of the age of onset in ALS. The same phenotypic biomarkers were also analyzed in the two mutant SOD1 mouse models of ALS with early and late disease onset indicating common changes between the sporadic and SOD1-linked forms. These biomarkers are proteins involved in the maintenance of protein homeostasis, or proteostasis. Proteostasis is attained through several quality-control systems that assist protein folding, clear misfolded proteins and respond to protein aggregation, whose major players are molecular chaperones. Interestingly, impaired proteostasis has emerged as a key contributor to the pathogenesis of ALS (Ruegsegger and Saxena, 2016).",

To be eligible, patients had to be \u226455 years of age (early ALS) or \u226575 years of age (late ALS) at diagnosis. Controls were residency-, sex-, and age-matched (\u00b15 years), randomly chosen within the same hospital of the patient among subjects admitted for surgery for a non-spontaneously evolving disease. Subjects enrolled for the discovery phase study were 16 early ALS, 16 late ALS and 32 controls (early and late controls), with demographic and clinical characteristics described in Table 1. Subjects enrolled in the validation study were 85 ALS patients and 83 controls with demographic and clinical characteristics described in Table 2. All cases were sporadic. A wide, although partial screening for ALS-causative mutations was performed (Tremolizzo et al., 2014). Two early ALS cases carried a TARDP mutation (M359V, G368S), one late ALS case carried a SOD1 mutation (D90A) and another one an OPTN mutation (L500P).",

Briefly, 20 \u03bcg of each pool was labeled with 200 pmol of Cy3 or Cy5 dye for 30 min in ice in the dark. To exclude preferential labeling of the dyes, each sample was also reverse labeled. As an internal standard, aliquots of each pool were mixed and labeled with Cy2 dye. Labeled samples were then resuspended in Destreak SolutionTM (GE Healthcare) with IPG buffer pH 3-11 NL 1% v/v (GE Healthcare) and loaded into 11 cm-IPG strips pI range 3-11NL (GE Healthcare). Isoelectrofocusing was done on an IPGphor apparatus (GE Healthcare) with the following protocol: 300 Vhrs at 30 V, 50 Vhrs at 200 V, 1500 Vhrs at 2000 V, 2800 Vhrs of a linear gradient up to 3500 V, 4800 Vhrs at 3500 V, 8500 Vhr of a linear gradient up to 8000 V, and 30000 Vhr at 8000 V. SDS-PAGE was done using Precast Tris-HCl 10% polyacrylamide SDS gel (Biorad). Eight 2D gels were run with the four experimental groups. Each gel contained two experimental groups, one Cy3-labeled, the other Cy5-labeled plus the Cy2-labeled internal standard. Gel images were captured by the laser scanner Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad). Image analysis was done with Progenesis Same Spot software (Nonlinear Dynamics). For each spot the normalized volume was standardized against internal standard spot normal volume. The values for each spot in each group were expressed as the mean of the Cy3- and Cy5-labeled analyses. Values for early and late ALS were further normalized to the means values of early and late controls, respectively. Differential spots were considered only those that had a fold change (normalized late ALS/ normalized early ALS) \u22640.8 or \u22651.3.",

The analysis was done with 16 pooled samples for each of the four experimental groups (Table 1).

Spots were considered differential if fold change (normalized late ALS/normalized early ALS) was \u22640.8 or \u22651.3. A total of 68 differential spots were detected (Figure 1B). From these spots 43 unique proteins were identified by MS as candidate protein biomarkers (Table 3). Some of the proteins were identified in multiple spots at different pI and Mw, which are fragments or post-translationally modified isoforms of the same protein (Supplementary Table S1). We grouped the differential proteins on the basis of their most recognized function and on GO annotations (Table 3). The overrepresentation test performed with the list of the differential proteins against the Homo sapiens reference list indicated isomerase activity (GO:0016853), associated with PPIA and ERp57, among the most significantly enriched (p = 0.03; fold = 7.8) molecular functions. Protein folding (GO:0006457) and response to stress (GO:0006950) were among the most significantly enriched (p < 0.01; fold>4) biological processes identified. The overrepresentation test performed also against a reference list of lymphocyte/monocyte proteins, identified in 2D-based proteomic studies, indicated response to stress as one of the most significantly enriched (p = 0.03; fold = 2.5) biological processes. This suggested that proteins associated with these molecular functions and biological processes (Table 3), such as PPIA, HSP90, GRP78, ERp57, and DJ-1, were attracting candidate phenotypic biomarkers to further validate in a larger and well-characterized cohort of patients with early and late disease onset.",

Immunoreactivity values for each protein in early and late ALS patients were normalized to the mean values of early and late controls, respectively, similarly to the proteomic analysis. We found that PPIA, HSP90, GRP78, and DJ-1 were significantly lower in early ALS than in late ALS, and therefore can be considered phenotypic biomarkers (Figures 2A\u2013C,E), while ERp57 did not change (Figure 2D). Moreover, PPIA, HSP90, GRP78, and DJ-1 were similarly regulated, with a decreased level in early ALS compared to early controls and an opposite tendency in late ALS (Supplementary Figures S2A\u2013C,E), suggesting that early ALS patients have some defects in the response to stress pathways. In the same validation analysis, we measured another chaperone protein, HSC70, and TDP-43, both not differential in the 2D-DIGE analysis, but up-regulated in PBMC of a cohort of ALS patients with a mean age of onset of 62 \u00b1 10 years, previously reported in a work by our laboratory (Nardo et al., 2011). We found that HSC70 could not distinguish early from late ALS (Figure 2F), but it was up-regulated in late ALS compared to controls (Supplementary Figure S2F). We confirmed that total TDP-43 protein levels in PBMC underscores disease (Figure 2G), in fact it was higher in both early and late ALS compared to controls, but could not discriminate early ALS from late ALS (Figure 2H). It has to be noted that in our assay the total TDP-43 protein level comprise the 43-kDa full-length and fragmented forms (Supplementary Figure S1A).",

These mice despite having equal SOD1G93A expression have a different disease phenotype, because of the different genetic background (Marino et al., 2015). In particular, 129Sv and C57 SOD1G93A mice have symptom onset at 14 and 17 weeks of age, respectively, thus representing our mouse models of early (129Sv) and late (C57) disease onset. Similarly, to the human samples, immunoreactivity values for each protein in early and late mouse models were normalized to the mean values of the corresponding non-transgenic controls. We found that PPIA and HSP90 were significantly lower in early SOD1G93A mice than in late SOD1G93A mice, as much as in the human samples (Figures 3A,B), and there was a significant lower level of the two proteins in the early SOD1G93A mice compared to their non-transgenic controls (Supplementary Figures S3A,B). DJ-1 had a similar behavior but it did not reach statistical significance (Figure 3E and Supplementary Figure S3E). GRP78 was instead significantly higher in early SOD1G93A mice than in late SOD1G93A mice (Figure 3C), in contrast with the human samples, with an increased level in the early SOD1G93A mice compared to controls (Supplementary Figure S3C). ERp57 was not significantly different in late and early SOD1G93A mice, as much as in the human samples (Figure 3D), but it was significantly lower in late SOD1G93A mice compared to controls (Supplementary Figure S3D). Finally, TDP-43 was not significantly different in early and late SOD1G93A mice, as in the human samples (Figure 3F), but was not different compared to corresponding nontransgenic controls, in contrast with the human samples (Supplementary Figure S3F).",

Here we report the identification of protein biomarkers in PBMC that can discriminate ALS patients with an early disease onset from those with a late disease onset. The identified phenotypic biomarkers have in common a high expression in CNS where they have an important role in protein folding, as foldases and/or classical molecular chaperones, and are upregulated by a variety of stressors. They participate at different levels and in different ways in the maintenance of proteostasis, whose deficit has shown to generate protein misfolding and aggregation and facilitate the development of several neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS (Ruegsegger and Saxena, 2016).

These proteins, both in patient PBMC and mouse samples, are less upregulated in early ALS than in late ALS, and for PPIA this is evident already at a presymptomatic stage of the disease in the soluble fraction of the mouse spinal cord (Marino et al., 2015). The bases of these differences in early and late-onset disease are solely genetic and yet unknown in the case of the SOD1G93A mouse models, but exogenous factors cannot be excluded in the patients. For example, it has been reported that exposure to certain toxins lead to GRP78 downregulation (Yang et al., 2000; Namba et al., 2010).",

            "text": "These data suggest that a failure in the response to stress and a reduced ability to upregulate protective proteins may increase susceptibility to ALS. This is in agreement with the fact that vulnerable motor neurons have a high threshold for induction of the protective heat shock response and a higher sensitivity to ER stress (Batulan et al., 2003; Saxena et al., 2009). A protein signature comprising a panel of proteins involved in proteostasis may underline a subset of patients more susceptible to the disease and may help to stratify patients for more targeted ALS clinical trials. These observations further strengthen the notion that proteostasis maintenance by the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system, autophagy and ER, is a central issue in ALS, and therapeutic approaches aiming at boosting the protein quality control system might be a promising therapeutic strategy. Arimoclomol, a small molecule that acts as a co-inducer of the heat shock response by prolonging HSF1 activation and upregulating a number of proteins such as HSP60, HSP70, HSP90, and GRP94, has shown to be effective in several experimental models of motor neuron degeneration including the SOD1G93A mouse (Kalmar et al., 2014). A Phase II clinical trial in ALS patients has shown that the drug is safe and well tolerated (Cudkowicz et al., 2008) and is now under investigation in a PhaseII/III clinical trial in SOD1 positive familial ALS patients (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00706147). Colchicine, a FDA-approved drug that was identified by a high-throughput screening as enhancer of the expression of HSPB8, a key player of the protein quality control system, has demonstrated to facilitate the removal of TDP-43 aggregates by autophagy (Crippa et al., 2016).",
