In 1985, the Regulation on Individual Monitoring of Radiation Workers, together with the Methods of Individual Monitoring for Radiation Workers, was issued by the Ministry of Health. A nationwide monitoring of individual doses has been gradually implemented since 1 December 1985. Individual monitoring is an important part of the radiation health work. It can objectively reflect the level of the dose received by the radiation workers and provide the necessary basis for the radiological protection evaluation and the necessity to follow up on possible acute radiation tissue injuries. Individual monitoring is of great significance to the discovery and improvement of the relevant issues in the field of radiation protection, and to the guarantee of occupational health and safety of radiation workers. The history, current status and perspectives of individual monitoring of radiation workers in China are introduced briefly in this article.",
