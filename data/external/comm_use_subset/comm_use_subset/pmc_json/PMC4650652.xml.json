            "text": "By using reporter assays in HEK293T cells to screen a pool of 162 siRNAs targeting 54 human USPs genes for the capabilities to modulate SEV-induced activation of the ISRE promoter, we found USP15 is a potential candidate in previous study24. To dissect the specific mechanism by which USP15 plays a role in regulating the antiviral innate immune response, we continued to knockdown cell-endogenous USP15 in HEK293T cells to explore the physiological relevance. Since siRNA pools (three siRNAs per gene) were used to conduct the selection in previous study, we firstly evaluated the knockdown effect of each siRNA. As shown in Fig. 1a, siUSP15-1 was found to have a higher efficiency to block USP15 transcription, and the protein level of USP15 was inhibited by siUSP15-1 confirmed through immunoblotting. Thus, siUSP15-1 was used in the following experiments. As displayed in Fig. 1c, the activity of IFN-\u03b2 report plasmid (342.5 vs 574.5, p = 2.28E-05), transcription of endogenous IFNB1 gene (321.5 vs 660.0, p = 1.22E-05) and the production of IFN-\u03b2 proteins (162.4 vs 298.9, p = 2.95 E-05) were higher in the USP15-knocked-down cells than in the control-siRNA-treated cells with Sendai virus (SEV) being the stimulus, under the condition that SEV infection had no effect on USP15 expression (Fig. 1b). Next, we measured the effect of USP15 knockdown on ISRE, an important response element in triggering the expression of ISGs after the activation of IFN25. Note that knockdown of USP15 resulted in upregulation of SEV-induced activation of ISRE (207.4 vs 340.9, p = 6.78E-04) (Fig. 1d). Further supporting the notion that USP15 impacts the downstream cascade that amplifies type I IFN expression are the data shown in Supplementary Fig. S1, which suggest that knockdown of USP15 potentiated the SEV-induced expression of ISGs (ISG15, ISG20, ISG54, ISG56, IP-10).",

Therefore, we investigated whether USP15 is involved in the SEV-induced activation of NF-\u03baB and IRF3. As shown in Fig. 1e and 1f, knockdown of USP15 increased the activation of NF-\u03baB (5.9 vs 12.9, p = 1.92E-04) and IRF3 (15.6 vs 26.5, p = 1.04E-03) through reporter assays. To further confirm the results, SEV-induced phosphorylation of NF-\u03baB subunit p65 and IRF3 were enhanced by the knockdown of USP15 (Fig. 1g). Overall, these data showed that knockdown of cellular USP15 has an enhanced effect on the type I IFN signaling pathway.",

            "text": "The observation that depletion of USP15 resulted in upregulated production of IFN prompted us to further examine the effects of USP15 overexpression on type I IFN signaling pathway. To this end, HEK293T cells were transfected with an expression construct encoding USP15, together with a luciferase reporter plasmid containing the IFN-\u03b2 promoter and pRL-TK and cells were further stimulated with SEV. The result showed that USP15 caused the dose-dependent inhibition of IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity (Fig. 2a). Coincident with knockdown experiments, overexpression of USP15 blocked SEV-induced transcription of endogenous IFNB1 gene (323.8 vs 135.4, p = 1.0E-04) and the production of IFN-\u03b2 proteins (178.2 vs 120.6, p = 3.52E-04) (Fig. 2b). Similarly, we observed that increasing quantities of USP15 caused the inhibition of SEV-induced activation of ISRE (Fig. 2c), NF-\u03baB (Fig. 2d), and IRF3 (Fig. 2e) promoters, additionally, the expression of ISGs (Supplementary Fig. S1). We also determined whether USP15 is involved in regulation of virus-induced IFN signaling in other cell type. As observed in HEK293T cells, ectopic expression of USP15 inhibits SEV-induced IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation, while knockdown of USP15 by siRNA results in upregulation of the activation of IFN-\u03b2, NF-\u03baB and IRF3 promoters in A549 cells, as well as the production of IFNB1 and ISGs (Supplementary Fig. S2). Decrease of SEV-induced phosphorylation of NF-\u03baB subunit p65 and IRF3 (Fig. 2f) were also observed in USP15 overexpression cells. These overexpression experiments results together with those of knockdown results highlight that USP15 is involved in virus-induced type I IFN signaling by serving as a potent inhibitor.",

We chose eight USPs with previously documented DUB activity27282930313233, and a sequence alignment showed that Cys269 and His862 of USP15 are highly conserved among all nine USPs (Fig. 3a). Since the DUB activity of C269 has been identified3435, we tried to test whether the deubiquitinase activity of USP15 is dependent on intact catalytic residues H862, with C269 being the positive control. As shown in Fig. 3b, mutations at both sites abrogated the deubiquitinase activity of the mutant proteins. Fig. 3c presents data that further support the notion that the USP15 mutants had no deubiquitinase activity for Lys48- or Lys63-linked ubiquitin in vitro. Therefore, the catalytic activity of USP15 is dependent on His862.",

During the innate antiviral immune response, ubiquitination of essential signaling components is pivotal in signal transduction37. Therefore, we determined whether USP15 acts as a DUB targeting RIG-I-like receptor-mediated IFN signaling. Toward this objective, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with Flag-tagged RIG-I, IPS-1, TRAF3, TBK1 and hemagglutinin (HA)\u2013USP15-WT or a catalytic mutant (USP15-C269A or USP15-H862A), and the endogenous ubiquitination of proteins were assessed with an anti-Ub antibody. The overexpression of USP15-WT, but not of the deubiquitinase-deficient mutants (USP15-C269A and USP15-H862A), significantly decreased the ubiquitination of RIG-I (Fig. 4a) and did not block ubiquitination of IPS-1 (Fig. 4b), TRAF3 (Fig. 4c) and TBK1 (Fig. 4d), illustrating that USP15 has deubiquitination activity for RIG-I.",

Consistent with the negative regulatory role of USP15 in RIG-I-mediated signaling, USP15 substantially reduced RIG-I polyubiquitination in cells transfected with plasmid encoding the WT ubiquitin and Lys63 mutant (Fig. 5a,b), but not in the mutant-Lys48-transfected cells (Fig. 5c), indicating that USP15 has DUB activity directed specifically towards the Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains of RIG-I. To confirm these results, HEK293T cells were transfected with Flag-tagged RIG-I in the presence of USP15-WT or the mutants, and the proteins were detected with indicated antibodies. The data showed that USP15 markedly deubiquitinated the Lys63-linked endogenous ubiquitin chains from RIG-I (Fig. 5d\u2013e). To further confirm USP15 deubiquitinates polyubiquitination of RIG-I, USP15 siRNAs were transfected into HEK293T cells to knockdown endogenous USP15 expression. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis showed that compared with control siRNA transfected cells, knockdown of USP15 substantially increased RIG-I polyubiquitination in WT ubiquitin and mutant Lys63 transfected cells (Fig. 5f). As shown in Fig. 5g, USP15 knockdown greatly enhanced SEV-induced WT and K63-linked polyubiquitination of RIG-I, further confirming USP15-mediated deubiquitination of RIG-I under physiological conditions. In conclusion, our results provide clear evidence that USP15 deconjugates the Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains from RIG-I.",

Similar results were also obtained when RIG-I-N was used in lieu of SEV to compare the inhibitory effects of the mutants and wild-type USP15 (Fig. 6e\u2013h).

As demonstrated in Fig. 7c, RIG-I interacted with USP15-WT and the C-terminal UCH domain (USP15-C250), but not with the N-terminal DUSP domain (USP15-N249). We also identified the domains of RIG-I responsible for the RIG-I\u2013USP15 interaction. RIG-I has an N-terminal domain consisting of two CARD motifs and a C-terminal domain. A coimmunoprecipitation assay suggested that mutants carrying the N-terminal CARD domain or the C-terminal domain both interacted with USP15 (Fig. 7d). Together, these results demonstrate that USP15 and RIG-I form a complex through the UCH domain of USP15, and that the N-terminal CARD domain and the C-terminal domain of RIG-I both bind to USP15. To further confirm the interaction in vitro, we employed glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull down assays by using the purified USP15 C250 (from recombinant E. coli) and glutathione beads conjugated with GST-RIG-I-N or GST protein. Our result showed that the presence of GST-RIG-I-N retained USP15 C250 (Fig. 7e), indicating that the interaction of RIG-I with USP15 is due to a direct physical association.",

To test this hypothesis, HEK293T cells were transfected with increasing amounts of HA-tagged USP15-WT or the mutants (USP15-C269A or USP15-H862A), together with indicated plasmids. As shown in Fig. 7f, RIG-I efficiently pulled down IPS-1.

Of note, USP15-H862A significantly impaired the interaction between RIG-I and IPS-1. In stark contrast, USP15-C269A exhibited weaker interaction with RIG-I, resulting in a weak reduction of the RIG-I-IPS-1combination.

            "text": "For serving as an important part of the host defense system, the type I IFN signaling pathway must be tightly controlled to sustain homeostatic immune responses. Ubiquitination and deubiquitination are associated with the modulating virus-triggered induction of type I IFNs. Since RIG-I is a critical PRR in the virus-triggered type I IFN signaling pathway, the function of RIG-I ubiquitination is well established and some regulators have been identified. The ubiquitin E3 ligases TRIM25538, Riplet3940 attach Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains to RIG-I, which stabilize the interaction between RIG-I and IPS-1, thus promoting the activation of the RIG-I signaling pathway. Another E3 ligase, RNF125, conjugates Lys48-linked ubiquitin to RIG-I to mediate its proteasomal degradation, acting as a negative regulator41. Some DUBs that mediate the deubiquitination of RIG-I have also been defined. CYLD interacts with RIG-I and removes Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains from it, which might be a mechanism involved in the downregulation of the IFN pathway42. It is noteworthy that some USPs, which constitute the largest subfamily of DUBs, are critical players in regulating the RIG-I-mediated innate immune response, including USP443 , USP1729 and USP2144. USP4 positively regulates the RIG-I-mediated antiviral response through the deubiquitination of Lys48-linked polyubiquitin from RIG-I43. USP17 negatively modulates virus-induced type I IFN signaling through the deubiquitination of RIG-I and MDA529. USP21 negatively regulates antiviral response by acting as a RIG-I deubiquitinase44. In our study, we found that USP15 specially removes Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains from RIG-I. However, we found that USP15 interferon antagonism is enhanced by, but is not strictly dependent on the catalytic activity. Inhibition of DUB activity by mutagenesis did not abrogate interferon antagonism. Additionally, the expression of RNF12541 is induced and the expression of USP443 is reduced after viral infection, whereas, USP15 was not affected. Therefore, we guess USP15 functions as a negative feedback molecule to attenuate the establishment of an antiviral state, in a similar fashion with CYLD42, not functioning as an element that is removed to allow the enhancement of response. To sum up, USP15 is a novel modulator of RIG-I signaling pathway.",

USP25 is a similar deubiquitinating enzyme that can disassemble both Lys48- and Lys63-linked ubiquitin oligomers in vitro, but specifically removes Lys48-linked ubiquitin molecules from TRAF3 and Lys63-linked ubiquitin from TRAF645464748.

            "text": "Using reporter assays, we found that blocking the DUB activity by mutagenesis did not completely abrogate the ability of USP15 to inhibit the type I IFN signaling pathway (Fig. 6). The catalytic mutants USP15-C269A and -H862A, especially USP15-H862A, still dose-dependently inhibited the IFN-\u03b2\u2013Luc, ISRE\u2013Luc, NF-\u03baB\u2013Luc, and IRF3\u2013Luc reporter activities. Reminding us USP15 may antagonize type I IFN induction independently of catalytic activity. We hypothesized that USP15 interacts with RIG-I and the interaction is independent of the DUB activity, and the coimmunoprecipitation assay proved the credibility. Mechanistically, the interaction between RIG-I and USP15 suggests the model that USP15 prevents the access of a downstream target to the RIG-I complex. In this study, we noted that IPS-1 was dislodged from RIG-I as the level of USP15 increased (Fig. 7f left). Whereas, the weaken interaction effect suggests two possible models. One possibility is that USP15 deubiquitinates the Lys63 linked polyubiquitination from RIG-I, thus disrupting the recruitment of IPS-1. The second possibility is that USP15 interacts with RIG-I to reduce IPS-1-RIG-I binding. In the same experiment (Fig. 7f right), we found catalytically inactive mutants sequester the RIG-I-IPS-1interaction; however, USP15-H862A, which showed stronger interaction with RIG-I, caused a more profound reduction in RIG-I-IPS-1interaction. These results suggest that USP15 sequesters the interaction between RIG-I and IPS-1 in a DUB activity-independent manner by acting as a competitor of IPS-1 for RIG-I binding, resulting in the inhibition of both IPS-1 activation and subsequent type I IFN production. Additionally, due to the strong inhibition of RIG-I-IPS-1interaction, USP15-H862A exhibited more profound inhibition of IFN induction compared with USP15-C269A (Fig. 6), which corroborates the notion of a catalysis-independent mechanism for type I IFN antagonism. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that USP15 exerts its effects in a third uncharacterized manner, the data in this study demonstrate that USP15 sequesters the interaction between RIG-I and IPS-1, shedding light on the mechanisms underlying the catalytic-activity-independent antagonism of IFN by USP15.",

            "text": "USP15 has been studied extensively in recent years and a growing body of data concerning its functions has been reported. Schweitzer et al. reported that COP9 signalosome (CSN)-associated USP15 can deubiquitinate I\u03baB\u03b1 and regulates the activation of NF-\u03baB49. However, Sun et al. found no interaction between USP15 and I\u03baB\u03b1, and proposed that USP11 inhibits the ubiquitination and degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 in the early stage, whereas USP15 functions at a later time point in the TNF\u03b1-induced NF-\u03baB activation50. USP15 also acts as a key component of the transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) signaling pathway35, and is a DUB for R-SMADs34. The DUB activity of USP15 is reported to be involved in the regulation Tip110 protein degradation51, parkin-mediated mitochondrial ubiquitination and mitophagy52, and ALK3/BMPR1A in bone morphogenetic protein signaling53. Based on the insights into the characteristics of USP15 gained so far, we can see that USP15 is a multifunctional protein by acting as a DUB for many molecules in different signaling pathway. However, in our study, we found the DUB activity of USP15 is not strictly required for inhibition of antiviral IFN expression, and the effect to disrupt the RIG-I-IPS-1interaction plays a central role in the regulation of IFN signaling pathway. Remarkably, we identified another DUB activity site His862. Despite the fact that both catalytically inactive mutants lost the ability to reduce the ubiquitination of RIG-I (Fig. 5), they showed different potential to downregulate the expression of IFN (Fig. 6). We hold the hypothesis that changing the cysteine residue to an alanine may significantly impair the capability to combine with RIG-I, thus causing a weaker influence on the recruitment of IPS-1 triggered by RIG-I. Even though Cys269 and His862 are both indispensable to DUB activity, the precise role of each site in determining the protein structure is unclear, so there is a high possibility that these two sites determine different binding specificity. Further investigation is required to confirm our hypothesis.",

To determine the precise role of USP15 plays in mediating the IFN signaling pathway and figure out the factors that drive the main different results, we asked for the USP15-Myc and TRIM25-V5 plasmids from Dr. Gack and performed related experiments. We found both USP15-HA and USP15-Myc dose-dependently inhibited the SEV- and RIG-I-N-induced activation of IFN-\u03b2 (Supplementary Fig. S5). We further investigated the effect of both USP15 expression plasmids on antiviral responses by monitoring the VSV-GFP expression under fluorescence microscope. As shown in supplementary Fig. S5, neither USP15-HA nor USP15-Myc suppressed the replication of VSV, not in accordance with the result described in Pauli\u2019s paper that USP15 limited the VSV replication. In contrast, poly(I:C)-induced inhibition of VSV replication was recovered by overexpression of both USP15-HA and USP15-Myc (Supplementary Fig. S5). These results together suggested that both USP15 constructed in two different expression plasmids inhibited the production of IFN. However, we also found that co-expression of increasing amounts of USP15-HA and USP15-Myc further enhanced the IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation stimulated by RIG-I-N and TRIM25 as a function of the dose, in line with the result described by Pauli (Supplementary Fig. S5). Through the comparison we found under the condition that co-expressed with TRIM25, USP15 enhanced the activation of IFN-\u03b2. However, when expressed alone, USP15 inhibited the IFN signaling pathway. Thus, overexpression of TRIM25 may change the real properties and effects of USP15 in regulating the IFN signaling pathway. To exclude the possibility that these results were attributable to the nonphysiological overexpression of USP15 or TRIM25, we knocked down cell-endogenous USP15 in HEK293T cells and to explore the physiological relevance. Pauli found the ubiquitylation of endogenous RIG-I was reduced in cell line in which USP15 was stably knocked down. To eliminate the diversity between different cell lines, we preferentially performed transient transfection with siRNAs to dissect the biological effect of USP15 towards RIG-I ubiquitination, the results (Fig. 5f,g) collaborate to prove the USP15-mediated deubiquitination of RIG-I. Besides the function of DUB activity in regulating IFN production, USP15 is a competitor of IPS-1 for RIG-I binding, leading to the limitation of the IPS-1 activation and subsequent type I IFN production. So disruption of RIG-I-IPS-1interaction also makes USP15 a negative regulator of IFN pathway. To sum up, USP15 is a potential novel factor maintaining the delicate balance of the virus-induced type I IFN signaling pathway. Being a multifunctional protein, the comprehensive and detailed roles require further researches.",
