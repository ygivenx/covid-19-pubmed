Betanodaviruses belong to the Betanovirus class and cause virus nervous necrosis (VNN) disease, which is characterized by necrosis of the central nervous system (including the brain and retina), abnormal swimming behavior, darkening of the skin and weight loss4,5. Mass mortality caused by VNN in larval and juvenile populations of several teleost species has a significant global economic impact5. Betanodaviruses are thought to modulate innate/acquired immunity and may be a useful model for understanding the pathogenesis of RNA virus-mediated diseases.",

RNA1 is the largest genomic segment of the virus and encodes a non-structural protein of approximately 110 kDa, which is designated RNA-dependent RNA polymerase or protein A. This protein is vital for replication of the viral genome. The middle genomic segment, RNA2, encodes a 42-kDa capsid protein that may also function in the induction of cell death6,7. RNA3, a sub-genomic RNA species at the 3\u2032 terminus of RNA1, comprises 2 ORFs that encode B1 (a 111 amino acid protein) and B2 (a 75 amino acid protein). The B1 gene of the Red spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV) betanodavirus strain has recently been shown to have an anti-necrotic function during early replication8, whereas the B2 gene has been found to either suppress host siRNA silencing9\u201311 or play a role in necrosis.",

Betanodavirus-induced cell death also correlates with the induction of ER stress and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in fish cells. RGNNV has recently been shown to induce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during the early and middle replication stages22. A number of viral proteins and cell signaling molecules have been shown to be involved in induction of host cell death and post-apoptotic necrosis during betanodavirus infection7,8,23. These data suggest that there may be crosstalk between the apoptosis and cell cycle pathways, which share a number of regulatory molecules24. We therefore hypothesized that betanodavirus infection may affect the cell cycle in a manner separate from induction of apoptosis.",

Loose nucleus targeting was observed for the EYFP-B1\u0394C fusion protein (Fig. 2b: i, j, k, l and o [enlarged image]), which was distributed throughout the whole cell, including the cytoplasm and nucleus at 48 hpt. In the nucleus targeting test, in EYFP-B1\u0394C fusion protein also lost its targeting ability (Fig. 2b, o), as compared with that of EYFP-B1 (Fig. 2b, n) and EYFP alone (Fig. 2b, m). Quantitative analysis of the EYFP, EYFP-B1 and EYFP-\u0394B1 proteins targeting into cytoplasm or nucleus (Fig. 2c) showed that GF-1 cells transfected with pEYFP, pEYFP-B1 and pEYFP-B1\u0394C plasmids exhibited a significant targeting into the nucleus in EYFP-B1-transfected cells (up to 99%) at 48 hpt (*p < 0.01; **p < 0.05) compared with cells transfected with EYFP (100%) and EYFP-B1\u0394C plasmids (10%), which apparently lost targeting ability. The reasons for these observations are discussed below.",

The predicted targeting domains were labeled domain A (32PRRAR36), domain B (46ARRSRR51), domain C (63VRDKRPRR70) and domain D (101VRQRQRRR108) (Fig. 3). Domain deletion experiments were used to determine which targeting domain(s) played a role in the nuclear targeting of B1 (Fig. 4a). Western blot experiments were used to compare the localization of the EYFP-B1 fusion protein (~40-kDa) with (1) domain A deletion (<40-kDa, designed as \u0394A), (2) domain B deletion (\u0394B), (3) domain C deletion (\u0394C), (4) domain D deletion (\u0394D), (5) domain A and D double deletion (\u0394AD) and (6) domain B and C double deletion (\u0394BC) (in Fig. 4b, lanes 3\u20139, respectively). Untransfected GF-1 cells and EYFP-transfected cells were used as negative controls (Fig. 4b, lanes 1\u20132, respectively). These data, along with nuclear targeting analysis (Fig. 5a; Table 1) showed that deletion of domain C resulted in the biggest decrease in nuclear targeting (in \u0394C panel: panels e1-e4; indicated by arrows) and deletion of domain B resulted in a minor decrease in nuclear targeting (panels d1-d4; indicated by arrow). In contrast, deletion of domain A (panels c1-c4) and domain D (panels f1-f4) had no significant effect on nuclear targeting. Simultaneous deletion of two domains (B1\u0394BC; panels g1-g4 and B1\u0394AD; panels h1-h4) (Table 1) also showed that domains B and C played an important role in the nuclear targeting of B1, whereas domains A and D were not involved in the nuclear targeting of B1.",

Maintenance of Rb proteins in an activated (hyper phosphorylated) state induces cell cycle arrest at the G0 or G1 phase or at the G1/S boundary, thus preventing host DNA replication during viral lytic infection15,35,36. Virus-induced modulation of the host cell cycle has also been shown to be beneficial during viral replication, transcription, translation and assembly37\u201341. Previous data have shown that cell cycle arrest induced by enveloped RNA viruses can favor viral assembly, because the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus disassemble into vesicles and larger membrane structures break into clusters or remnants during mitosis42\u201344. It is therefore possible that RGNNV-induced cell cycle arrest may prevent early death of infected cells7,8,23. Because a delay in apoptotic/necrotic cell death always occurs after cell cycle arrest25,45,46, it is possible that RGNNV-induced G1/S cell cycle arrest may inhibit early apoptosis of infected cells to gain sufficient time and resources for the viral life cycle to produce new viral progeny.",

Our data suggested that B1-mediated inhibition of Cyclin D1/CDK4 complex formation, Mdm2, P53 inhibitor and G1/S cell cycle arrest occur via multiple pathways.

Nuclear targeting of the B1 protein was correlated with cell cycle progression, B1-mediated cell cycle arrest at the G1/S interphase and decreased cell volume at 48 hpt. B1 protein-induced cell cycle arrest was correlated with upregulated expression of p21 and p53 and downregulation expression of the Cyclin D1, CDK4 and Mdm2 proteins. Our findings may provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of RGNNV infection. Our findings provide new insights into RNA viral protein interactions with host proteins.",
