Second, our cases stemmed from a multiyear, multisite protocol, thereby minimizing the impact of temporal and/or geographic differences in trends of disease. Third, we utilized a multiplex PCR assay to assess the prevalence of other viral respiratory pathogens. The prevalence of viral codetection was rather high, even among adult patients, and several fold higher than those reported among military recruits.23 If these codetections do in fact represent coinfections, it is possible that previous clinical characterizations of adenovirus\u2010associated illness may have been confounded by the presence of other respiratory viral pathogens.1, 8, 24\n",

While adenovirus appears to be an infrequent cause of ILI that is relatively mild in nature, our case series investigation demonstrated the propensity for more severe symptoms with non\u2010type C adenovirus infections. In addition, the observed high prevalence of viral codetection among those with adenovirus\u2010associated illnesses underscores the importance of using multiplex diagnostic platforms, particularly when elucidating the etiology of respiratory illness and characterizing the severity of symptoms caused by particular pathogens.",
