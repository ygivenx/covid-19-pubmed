On the other hand, the term leukodystrophy refers to progressive disorders of glial cells and myelin maintenance [1,5] resulting in bilateral symmetric lesions in selective areas of the CNS white matter [4]. The diagnosis is accomplished via a combination of the clinical course of the disease, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), pathology and genetic testing [1,4]. Abnormal formation, turnover and destruction of the myelin are often caused by a lack of specific enzymes and inborn errors of metabolism [1,4,5].",

The etiology as well as clinical signs, findings in diagnostic imaging and histopathology are highly variable. In most leukoencephalopathies oligodendrocytes and myelin are predominantly affected, whereas axonal damage represents a rather infrequent finding. However, axonal damage in areas of myelin lack as shown in the present cases, has been reported as an epiphenomenon in leukodystrophies [17]. In several leukodystrophic diseases axonal damage is not directly caused by the lack of myelin or oligodendrocytes and rather represents a secondary event [18]. Several possible mechanisms of axonal damage in white matter diseases, such as sulfatide storage in metachromatic leukodystrophy in humans or aberrant glutamate homeostasis and nitric oxide production in multiple sclerosis have been described [19]. In addition, an impairment of axons as a consequence of demyelination and the associated loss of myelin-derived trophic support and ion imbalance according to the outside-in model cannot be excluded [20]. The pathomechanism of axonal damage in TSEN54 associated leukodystrophy is still unclear and warrants additional investigations.",

The results of the different myelin stains, underline the leukodystrophic character of the disease of the present cases [24,25]. CNPase immunohistochemistry detecting both immature oligodendrocytes and early myelin formation showed the presence of oligodendrocytes and the predominant absence of myelin in the centrum semiovale of the affected animals. In addition, the MBP immunohistochemistry revealed single fine strands of mature myelin in affected areas. This could be interpreted as an insufficient and inadequate myelin formation mediated by the detected genetic defect. Affected puppies are initially normal and develop progressive neurological signs mostly at 1\u20136 months of age dependent on the localization of the lesions. In humans, a systematic analysis of MRI patterns is used to differentiate leukodystrophies from other neurological diseases in children [4]. In veterinary medicine, MRI findings in leukodystrophies were only described in very few cases so far. Usually marked T2w hyperintense lesions are visible bilateral symmetrically in the white matter mostly of the forebrain without any mass effect. Depending on the disease, different distribution patterns of the lesions were described, affecting mostly the subcortical or the deep cerebral white matter with or without formation of cavitation [10,26,27]. It is very important to include all available information concerning macroscopy, histopathologic lesions, anamnesis and also genetics to come to an appropriate diagnosis.",

The variant was identified during the analysis of two closely related litters with four affected puppies. A combination of linkage analysis, autozygosity mapping, and whole genome sequencing of one of the cases identified this variant as the only protein-changing sequence variant that was located in the critical intervals and private to the sequenced case. The mapping of the disease locus delineated several very large genomic intervals comprising more than 29 Mb. Therefore, the results from the two litters suggested TSEN54:c.371G>A as candidate causative variant with only relatively weak statistical support. During the further course of the research project, DNA from archived FFPE material of eight additional cases became available for genetic analyses. Considering that the mutant A-allele is overall relatively rare in Standard Schnauzers, the homozygous mutant A/A genotype in these eight additional cases provides very strong additional support for a presumed causative role of the TSEN54:c.371G>A missense variant in the phenotype. Taken together, all 12 Standard Schnauzers with leukodystrophy were homozygous A/A, while this genotype was not observed in ~1000 other dogs.",

We cannot formally exclude the possibility that the TSEN54:c.371G>A variant is functionally neutral and in strong linkage disequilibrium to the true causative variant, which in this case might be e.g. a large structural variant and/or a non-coding regulatory variant.

Studies in yeast suggest that this complex consists of four subunits (SEN2, SEN34, SEN15 and SEN54) which play a role in multiple RNA processing events [29]. The exact three-dimensional structure of the eukaryotic tRNA splicing endonuclease complex has not yet been solved. The large SEN54 subunit is responsible for recognizing the precursor tRNA substrate and positioning the two catalytical subunits SEN2 and SEN34 to their respective cleavage sites [28]. In line with this role, yeast SEN54 is a highly basic protein, which facilitates its interaction with the negatively charged phosphates of the precursor-tRNA. The vertebrate ortholog of yeast SEN54, called TSEN54, shows relatively little sequence homology, but several structurally conserved motifs including a predicted alpha-helix followed by a beta-sheet at amino acids 117\u2013131 [29]. The p.Gly124Asp variant in dogs with leukodystrophy replaces a glycine residue that is conserved across diverse eukaryotes from yeast to humans with a negatively charged aspartic acid. It is conceivable that either the spatial requirement of the side chain of the mutant aspartic acid interferes with the secondary structure of TSEN54 and/or that the additional negative charge hinders the binding of TSEN54 to the negatively charged precursor tRNA.",
