Protection from re-infection relies on the establishment of efficient secondary immune responses that require the generation of antigen-specific \u201cmemory\u201d B and T lymphocytes. The generation and selection of T-cell dependent \u201cmemory\u201d B cells involves distinct molecular mechanisms: immunoglobulin isotype recombination and somatic hyper mutation, both dependent on the expression of AID [1]. Therefore, a long-standing paradigm defined memory B cells as IgM-IgG+ isotype switched cells [2]. Different lines of evidence indicate that this is not always the case. In humans, it has been shown that some IgM+ B cells bear the phenotype of other memory cells, being CD27+, and carry frequent point mutations in the V region of the Ig genes, suggesting that they must represent highly selected B cell populations [3]. In mice, populations of CD19+IgM+ able to mount secondary responses have been identified [4\u20137]. Overall these findings suggest that the T-cell dependent memory B cell pool comprises distinct subsets of memory B cells with different properties and effector functions [4\u20136].",

While initial studies proposed that after transfer memory B cells faded rapidly [8, 9] suggesting that long-lasting memory required the continuous recruitment of new cells [8] and/or antigen persistence [9, 10], others suggested that memory B cells were able of extended survival without cell division [11] in the absence of antigen [2]. Long-term persistence of antibody responses has also been attributed to populations of long-lived plasma cells mainly resident in the bone marrow following immunization [12, 13]. The demonstration of the compartmentalization of \u201cantibody memory\u201d into different cellular layers suggested that the separate subsets of memory B cells behave differently. Accordingly, it has been reported that IgG+ cells that could rapidly respond upon challenge did not persist long, while IgM+ cells could generate a second wave of germinal center responses allowing persistence of memory [4\u20136, 14].",

Therefore new therapy strategies may require the adoptive transfer of high-affinity memory B cells, ready to respond and able to persist. The development of these new strategies requires a profound understanding of the mechanisms that regulate memory B cell numbers and ensure long persistence upon adoptive transfer. Moreover, knowledge of the mechanisms that determine the size of the memory B cell pool may be also critical to device new reconstitution strategies. So far, studies comparing populations of na\u00efve and memory B cells have been hindered both by the vast clonal heterogeneity of the cells involved and by our inability to generate significant numbers of antigen specific memory B cells. Indeed in a normal laboratory mouse the population of B cells bearing a \u201cmemory IgG+ phenotype\u2019 represent a small fraction of the total B cell pool (<0.5%) and upon immunization the number of the clonal diverse antigen-specific memory B cells generated is generally very limited (<103) [1, 6].",

We used SWHEL transgenic mice where B cells bear a high-affinity BCR specific for HEL and are capable of class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation (SHM) [17, 18]. To identify \u201cmemory B cells\u201d the SWHEL mice were crossed with mice where AID transcription provokes the permanent expression of an YFP reporter in post-germinal center lymphocytes [19]. These mice were in a Rag2-deficient background and therefore contain a pure population of monoclonal HEL-specific B cells. To generate memory cells, purified na\u00efve B cells from the SWHEL.AID/YFP.Rag2-/- mice were transferred into adoptive hosts together with monoclonal OVA-specific CD4+ T cells from OTII.Rag2-/- TCR transgenic mice. Upon immunization with OVA-HEL complexes, we obtained a significant number of persisting HEL-specific IgM+IgG-YFP+ and IgM-IgG+YFP+ memory B cells, number that did not correlate to the number of precursor na\u00efve cells initially injected suggesting that the memory B cell pool is regulated independently. We characterized the functional capacity of these two memory cell types in immune deficient hosts.",

Before staining, cells were treated with Fc-Block (CD16/CD32, Becton Dickinson Pharmingen). Dead cells were excluded during analysis according to their light-scattering characteristics. For intracellular stainings, cells were first stained with antibodies specific for cell surface antigens. Then, cells were fixed and permeabilized according the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations (BD Bisciences). For proliferation assay, mice were injected i.p. with 50 mg/kg of BrdU (Sigma-Aldrich) and were killed 24 or 72 hours later. Incorporated BrdU was detected intracellularly using anti-BrdU APC-conjugated antibodies according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations (BD Biosciences).

We have devised an experimental system that permits the comparison between na\u00efve and memory B cells expressing the same antigen receptor and allows marking permanently memory B cells. For that purpose we used SWHEL transgenic mice in a Rag2-deficient background holding a single population of monoclonal B cells, all bearing a high-affinity BCR specific for HEL and capable of class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation (SHM) [17, 18]. To identify antigen-experienced B cells the SWHEL.Rag2-/- mice were crossed with mice where AID transcription induces the permanent expression of an YFP reporter in post-germinal center lymphocytes [19]. Since in intact Tg mice immune responses were not traceable, probably because of the presence of low level pre-existing anti-HEL antibodies that neutralize the immunizing protein, we used an adoptive cell transfer strategy to study the ability of the high affinity monoclonal B cell to reconstitute response in immune-deficient hosts and generate antibody memory. Purified na\u00efve B cells from the SWHEL.AID/YFP.Rag2-/- mice were transferred into Rag2-deficient mice together with monoclonal OVA-specific CD4+ T helper cells from OTII.Rag2-/- TCR transgenic mice. The day after, host mice were immunized with OVA-HEL complexes (Fig 1A). In these conditions, antigenic challenge resulted in B cell activation and the development of significant numbers of CD19+HEL+AID/YFP+ B cells, which were not detected in non-immunized mice or in mice immunized in absence of helper T cells (Fig 1B). We followed the early kinetics of this response. The number of HEL-specific B cells increased from the initial 2x106 transferred to about 15x106 at day 14 (Fig 1C left) the B cells expressing AID/YFP being the dominant population (Fig 1C right). A fraction of the HEL-specific B cells underwent class switch recombination and at day 14 we recovered both IgM+IgG-AID/YFP+ and IgM-IgG+AID/YFP+ cell populations (Fig 1B). B cell expansion and phenotypic changes were accompanied by the production of IgM and IgG HEL-specific antibodies (Fig 1D). Two weeks after antigenic challenge we observed the formation of germinal centers in the spleen of the host mice (Fig 1E). Coherently we found that while upon adoptive transfer all B cells expressed CD95, only after antigenic challenge most YFP+ B cells expressed the germinal center specific marker GL7 (Fig 1F). In conclusion, the adoptive cell transfer strategy allowed the development of a primary immune response with B cell activation and expansion, induction of AID expression, class switch recombination, antigen-specific IgM and IgG antibody production and germinal center formation.",

From two weeks onwards the total number of B cells contracted and at four weeks we recovered about 2-4x106 cells, number that remained stable up to week 20 (Fig 2A). High titers of HEL-specific IgG were kept from week 3 to 8, declined thereafter, but were still significantly elevated 20 weeks later (Fig 2B). A population of cells secreting HEL-specific Igs was present in the spleen (Fig 2C), but not in the BM (not shown) even at the late time points. About 60% of the recovered cells exhibited the phenotype of antigen-experienced (\u201cmemory\u201d) CD19+HEL+AID/YFP+ expressing either IgM or IgG (Fig 2D and 2E). We compared the phenotype of the two AID/YFP+IgM+ and AID/YFP+IgM-IgG+ memory cell populations recovered with that of the na\u00efve B cells (Fig 2F). We found that antigen-experience and na\u00efve B cells expressed similar levels of CD62L, CD69 and BAFFR (not shown). Antigen-experienced cells presented sustained expression of CD95 and increased levels of PNA, but the vast majority lost expression of the germinal center marker GL7 present at earlier times post-immunization (Fig 2F compare to Fig 1F). Compared to na\u00efve B cells, AID/YFP+ cells expressed higher levels of CD80 and MHC class II and down-regulated expression of CXCR5 (Fig 2F). These findings indicate that the post-germinal center AID/YFP+ B cells express an activated phenotype [5, 21], have increased antigen-presenting capacity [22], but may loose the ability to re-enter primary follicles being CXCR5low [23]. We have also compared the patterns of gene expression (RNAseq) by na\u00efve, activated (YFP- cells of immunized mice) and both populations of YFP+ memory cells. The data shows a clear discrimination of na\u00efve and activated/memory cells while indicating only minor differences between both subsets of YFP+ memory cells (Fig 3).",

To directly compare the results obtained after the transfer of different all numbers we allowed the responses to reach steady-state eight weeks after antigenic challenge. We studied the amplitude of the immune response by measuring the serum titers of HEL-specific IgG antibodies and enumerating the number of HEL-specific B cells recovered. We found that in the presence of excess T cell help, the levels of the HEL-specific IgGs (Fig 4C), and both the total number of HEL-specific (Fig 4A) and of memory YFP+ B cells recovered (Fig 4B), did not correlate to the number of antigen specific na\u00efve B cells initially transferred.",

We investigated whether the subsets of AID/YFP+IgM+ and AID/YFP+IgM-IgG+ antigen-experienced (memory) B cells persisting at late time points could mount secondary IgG responses and persist after secondary transfer. For this purpose we followed two different experimental strategies. In the first, 5x104 cells of either IgM+ or IgM-IgG+ memory B cells, were transferred with an excess helper OTII CD4+ T cells into secondary Rag-deficient hosts that were boosted with OVA-HEL the day after cell transfer. In the absence of immunization antibody levels were undetectable (not shown) and three weeks after transfer recovery of both memory B cell subsets was about 10\u201320% of the initial cell input, exceeding na\u00efve B cell recovery (Fig 5A), supporting the notion that memory B cells may not require specific ligand recognition to survive (2). One cannot exclude, however, that cross-reactivity of the BCR transgene with environmental antigens may allow signaling sufficient to maintain na\u00efve and memory cell survival in the absence of HEL [24]. Following immunization, the secondarily transferred AID/YFP+IgM-IgG+ cells responded promptly with the exclusive production of significant levels HEL-specific IgG thus confirming their memory statute (11). The AID/YFP+IgM+ B cells in response to antigenic boost produced only limited amounts of IgM antibodies (Fig 4B), little IgG antibodies, but did generate GL7+ B cells more efficiently than the IgG+ memory B cell population (Fig 5D). Thus the IgM+ subset may contain precursors able to generate a secondary germinal center reaction and a new progeny of IgG+ effectors (4). With time antibody levels decayed rapidly suggesting that the number of transferred memory B cells declined in the secondary hosts after antigenic boost. Indeed, IgM+ and IgG+ memory B cells failed to expand and 3 weeks after immunization cell recovery was similar to the retrieval observed in the non-immunized hosts (compare Fig 5E and 5A). In similar experimental conditions, na\u00efve B cells following immunization expanded, acquired AID/YFP expression and their numbers more than doubled the number initially injected (Figs 5F and 2A). These data suggest that a significant fraction of the memory B cells generated have a reduced expansion capacity being programmed for rapid differentiation for effector functions.",

These results contrast with previous published data. First it was been reported that \u201cin situ\u201d memory B cells persist as resting non-dividing cells [11, 25]. However, we have shown that upon adoptive transfer and in absence of competing cells, B cells increase their division rate to occupy the available empty niche [26], which may explain the higher division rate observed here using this adoptive cell transfer strategy. Secondly, comparing life spans among heterogeneous memory B cell populations it was previously reported a lower division rate among the IgM+ subset compared to the IgG+ polyclonal subset [6]. Differences in BCR affinity between IgM+ and IgG+ memory clones may explain the higher division rate previously observed among the IgG+ cells [6]. In contrast we compared memory B cell subsets belonging to the same clone bearing the same high affinity BCR. Overall these observations support the notion that lymphocyte division rates and life spans are not an intrinsic cell property, but rather determined by the environment and the presence of competing populations [27]. They demonstrate that upon the correct conditions memory B cells can persist by cell division.",

We found that, in the presence of an excess of T cell help, that was not the case. However, it was previously reported during polyclonal responses that serum titers of anti-HSA was proportional to the number of cells transferred into irradiated mice [28]. It is possible that limited antigen-specific T-B cell encounters may constraint the number of responding B cells and thus determine linear precursor-progeny between na\u00efve and memory B cells. Our findings indicate that within a single clone the number of precursor naive B cells present in the peripheral B cell pool does determine neither the intensity nor the final number of memory B cells in response to an optimal dose of antigen. They suggest that the size of memory B cell pool may be controlled independently of the number of na\u00efve B cell precursors and that in the absence of clonal competition the memory niche can be filled with a single monoclonal population. Considering diverse polyclonal populations, the limited niche for memory cells will imply strong competition among clones resulting in the selection of best fit (high affinity) cells: rare mutated clones being able to out compete more frequent but less avid clones. In our settings, the transgenic memory B cells are likely to counter select any new mutant clones since they express a very high affinity BCR selected in the course of a secondary immune response [29]. Thus, notwithstanding the expression of AID and proliferation we did not detect any BCR VH and VL Ig-chain nucleotide mutations among the recovered memory B cells (not shown). These findings may have implication for vaccination protocols as they indicate that each new antigenic exposure or unrelated immunization would add extra competing clones supporting the need for repeated antigenic boosts to prevent memory B cell attrition. They also demonstrate that the memory B cell pool can be reconstituted from a relatively small number of antigen-specific cells.",

Indeed, it is generally believed that in immune deficiencies, B cell therapy has restricted application due to intrinsic defects of host\u2019s lymphoid organs structure that may prevent development of immune responses, germinal center formation, establishment of antibody memory and limit cell survival. In contrast we showed that after adoptive transfer in immune deficient hosts antigen immunization induced B cell activation and expansion, induction of AID expression, class switch recombination, antigen-specific IgM and IgG antibody production, germinal center formation and the generation of two subsets of AID/YFP+IgM+IgG- and AID/YFP+IgM-IgG+ antigen-experienced B cell subsets able to persist in a lymphopenic environment by cell division mimicking responses obtained in intact non-Tg mice [4]. Upon challenge the AID/YFP+IgM-IgG+ cells responded promptly with the production of HEL-specific IgG while the AID/YFP+IgM+ B cells secreted only limited amounts of IgM antibodies and fail to produce IgG. In contrast the AID/YFP+IgM+ B cells could give rise to new GL7+ B cells, suggesting that full reconstitution of the memory B cell pool may require transfer of the different antigen-experienced B cell subsets. Importantly, we found that the recall responses were more efficient if the transferred memory cells were given the required time to adapt to their new environment, suggesting that a period of accommodation is necessary before the transferred cells are fully capable to respond. Our findings also show that different processes can modify the survival conditions of memory B cells. Finally, we found that the generation of the memory B cell pool in response to an optimal dose of Ag did not rely on the number of the initially responding B cells, suggesting autonomous homeostatic controls for na\u00efve and memory B cells a property that may allow reconstitution of the memory pool in immune-deficient hosts using a limited number of precursor na\u00efve B cells. An autonomous control of the memory B cell pool where each antigenic exposure adds new competing clones supports the notion of vaccination strategies using antigenic boosting to prevent memory B cell attrition. Overall the findings reported demonstrate that it is possible to reconstitute the memory B cell pool of an immune deficient host with an artificially induced population of monoclonal high affinity memory B cells.",
