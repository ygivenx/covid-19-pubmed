            "text": "Influenza A virus causes epidemics of respiratory diseases in humans, leading to thousands of deaths annually. This subtype of pathogen has been thoroughly studied, and many aspects including viral entry, and replication, as well as host cell-virus interactions are well-characterized. During the influenza virus life cycle, entry is the first essential process by which viral genomes are delivered from extracellular virions into the cell nucleus for viral replication [1, 2], which is an ideal target to block infection. Influenza virus enters the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis after binding to the sialic acid receptor [3\u20135]. There is increasing evidence that viral attachment to the cell surface by influenza hemagglutinin (HA) is not sufficient for endocytotic routes [6, 7]. The adaptor protein Epsin-1 is recruited for clathrin-mediated viral entry [8]. Specific cellular signaling by receptor tyrosine kinases, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and c-Met receptor, is required. siRNA-induced EGFR knockdown and the inhibition of kinase activity by small molecule inhibitors leads to impaired influenza virus uptake into cells [9]. In turn, host cells express antiviral factors to defend against influenza virus entry [10]. For example, the interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) proteins 1 to 3 restrict an entry step of influenza A viral replication [11, 12].",

Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 1 to 4, known as the tyrosine kinase receptor superfamily, regulates many biological processes including differentiation, proliferation, development, and angiogenesis [13\u201315]. FGFR1 is a co-receptor during adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV) infection for successful viral entry into the host cell [16]. FGFR4 knockdown reduces influenza A/WSN pseudotyped particle entry, and an FGFR4 inhibitor attenuates WSN virus replication [10]. These results increase our understanding of the role of FGFR family members in the life cycle of viral infection. Differential expression and structural complexity of the FGFR family may generate functional diversity in response to different ligands, which is crucial for regulating normal physiological processes in vivo [17]. However, it remains unclear how the expression of FGFR 1 to 4 are regulated by influenza A virus infection, and whether FGFR 1 to 4 have the same effect on influenza A (H1N1 or H5N1) virus replication requires further study.",

We found that RNAi-induced FGFR1 gene silencing (not FGFR4) significantly elevated PR8 and H5N1 virus replication, while lentivirus-mediated FGFR1 overexpression reduced virus replication, which suggested that FGFR1 specifically suppressed influenza A virus replication. In addition, inhibition of FGFR1 kinase activity could enhance influenza A virus replication. During the early stages of infection, FGFR1 could inhibit viral internalization steps, which may account for the suppressive effect of FGFR1 on virus replication.",

The results revealed the differential expression levels of four FGFR members in A549 cells: FGFR1 mRNA expression was highest, while FGFR4 was intermediate and FGFR2 and FGFR3 were lowest. The results showed that the FGFR1 and FGFR4 mRNA expression decreased sharply at 12 hpi, and then stabilized. PR8 virus infection also decreased FGFR2 and FGFR3 mRNA expression at 12 hpi, which increased subsequently. We next detected the protein levels of four FGFR members by Western blotting using specific antibodies. The results showed that the FGFR1 and FGFR4 protein levels in A549 cells significantly decreased at 48 hpi (Fig 1E and 1F), followed by mRNA expression levels (Fig 1A and 1D).

The mRNA levels of influenza virus M1 were detected using real-time PCR. The results showed that the M1 mRNA levels in PR8-infected A549 cells were markedly elevated by FGFR1 siRNA#1 and siRNA#2, but not by FGFR4 siRNA#1, siRNA#2, or control siRNA (Fig 2A). In addition, we determined progeny virus titers using MDCK cells with the TCID50 assay. Consistent with virus M1 mRNA expression, the viral titers were also increased in FGFR1 silenced cells (Fig 2C). Similar results were observed in H5N1-infected A549 cells (Fig 2B and 2D). The mRNA expression levels of FGFR1 and FGFR4 were analyzed using real-time PCR after 48 h transfection, and showed up to 60% knockdown by RNAi (Fig 2E). The effective repression of two proteins was also determined by Western blotting (Fig 2F).

To investigate the effect of siRNA-mediated FGFR1 silencing on early stage of influenza virus infection, incoming vRNPs were detected at 4 h after PR8 virus infection using indirect immunofluorescence assays with anti-influenza A virus NP antibodies (Fig 3A\u20133C) [22, 23].

A549 cells with lentivirus-mediated FGFR1 or FGFR4 overexpression were infected with PR8 or H5N1 virus. The virus M1 mRNA levels and viral titers were then detected as described previously. As expected, FGFR1 significantly decreased virus M1 mRNA levels in PR8-infected A549 cells, but not FGFR4 or GFP (Fig 4A). Viral titers were also reduced in FGFR1-overexpressing cells, but not in the other two groups (Fig 4C). Similar results were observed in H5N1-infected A549 cells (Fig 4B and 4D). There was more than a 2.5-fold increase in mRNA expression of FGFR1 or FGFR4 in A549 cells (Fig 4E). The effective exogenous expression of FGFR1 or FGFR4 was also confirmed by Western blotting (Fig 4F). These results indicated that FGFR1 as a cellular antiviral factor could inhibit influenza A virus infection; meanwhile, influenza A virus may evade the inhibitory effect by downregulating FGFR1 protein levels.",

Our previous results suggested that influenza A (H1N1) virus infection downregulated FGFR1 expression (Fig 1A and 1E), but whether influenza virus infection stimulated FGFR1 phosphorylation remains unknown. FGFR1 could inhibit influenza virus replication, but whether FGFR1 kinase activation had an effect on virus replication has not yet been explored. Next, the effect of influenza infection in A549 cells on FGFR1 phosphorylation for the indicated times was investigated (Fig 5A). The results showed that FGFR1 phosphorylation was obviously reduced by PR8 infection over time, which suggested that influenza A (H1N1) virus infection downregulated FGFR1 phosphorylation in A549 cells. To address the second question, PD173074 as a potent and highly selective inhibitor of the FGFR family that can inhibit autophosphorylation of FGFR1 in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 in the range 1\u20135 nM [25] was used to verify the effect of FGFR1 kinase activity on virus replication. A549 cells were pretreated with PD173074 and then infected with PR8 virus. The results showed that FGFR1 phosphorylation in PR8-infected A549 cells was significantly suppressed by PD173074 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 5B). There was little difference in M1 expression in A549 cells with 5 nM of PD173074 treatment; however, when the dose of PD173074 increased to 10 and 20 nM, virus M1 expression in A549 cells remarkably increased (Fig 5C). For cytotoxicity analysis, the viability of A549 cells with varying amounts of PD173074 with or without PR8 infection was measured using the MTT assay. The results showed that the range 5\u201320 nM of PD173074 did not induce significant cytotoxicity (Fig 5D). These results suggested that the repression of FGFR1 phosphorylation in A549 cells with PD173074 treatment could enhance influenza virus replication.",

We speculated that FGFR1 might play a suppressive role in virus binding and/or internalization. To further verify the potential effect of FGFR1, virus binding and internalization assays were performed. A549 cells with FGFR1, FGFR4, or GFP overexpression were pretreated with or without sialidase to prevent virus attachment and internalization, and then incubated with PR8 or H5N1 virus. During the entry process, virus bound to the cell surface at 4\u00b0C but was not internalized; after warming the cells to 37\u00b0C, virus began to internalize. The ratio of NP/\u03b2-actin was quantified and represented the amount of bound or internalized virus particles (Fig 6A and 6B). The results showed that the application of sialidase potently inhibited PR8 and H5N1 virus attachment and internalization. There was little difference in virus binding among three groups of cells with or without sialidase. However, in sialidase-untreated cells with FGFR1-overexpression, virus internalization was significantly reduced compared to the two other groups. The results suggested that FGFR1 specifically inhibited influenza A virus internalization, but not attachment to cells.",

Differences caused by FGFR1 silencing or overexpression were almost two-fold, which indicated that FGFR1 played a suppressive role in influenza A virus (IAV) PR8 and H5N1 replication. It is known that influenza virus attaches to the cell surface by binding of the HA protein, and then enters the cell through receptor-mediated endocytosis. Several studies have shown that influenza virus HA binding to sialic acid receptor is not sufficient to initiate virus entry. Host factors including dynamin, Epsin-1, EGFR, and PLC-\u03b31 etc. are known to be involved in this process and facilitate viral internalization [8, 9, 26, 27]. Our results suggested that FGFR1 knockdown notably elevated virus entry efficiency during the early stages of IAV infection; furthermore, FGFR1 could inhibit virus internalization, which indicated that host cells may have evolved a specific strategy of utilizing plasma membrane as a barrier to block influenza virus entry.",

A previous study using genome-wide siRNA screening assays showed that FGFR4 knockdown reduced influenza A/WSN pseudotyped particle entry in A549 cells, and also that the FGFR4 inhibitor attenuated WSN virus replication [10]. In our study, FGFR4 knockdown had no significant effect on inhibiting PR8 and H5N1 virus replication; in contrast, we demonstrated that FGFR1 not FGFR4 remarkably suppressed PR8 and H5N1 virus replication.

In this study, we found that both FGFR1 protein expression and kinase phosphorylation levels were downregulated by influenza A/PR8 infection, which may be related to pathogenesis of influenza virus-induced disease. FGFR contains a highly conserved region between the first and second IgG-like domains, which exhibit extreme sequence similarity to the amino termini of the HA1 chains of influenza A virus HA [29]. Deletion of this HA-containing region completely abolished FGFR function of responding to basic FGF (FGFR ligand), which suggested that the HA-containing region plays a crucial role in regulating ligand binding or receptor oligomerization. In addition, FGFR dimerization is required for receptor tyrosine kinase activation [24, 30]; thus, an interaction may exist between influenza virions and the HA-containing region of FGFR1, by which receptor dimerization was blocked and kinase activity was inhibited.",
