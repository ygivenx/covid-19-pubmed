Research on biobanks and medical databases provide opportunities for a broad spectrum of interests and applications in translational bioinformatics (TBI). Many countries plan to invest in health IT research by constructing biobanks and health information databases [1]. These projects make rapid improvements in this field. The ethical, legal and social needs of studies are integral concerns of the entire scientific community. A significant bioinformatics infrastructure effort that aims to construct high-capacity public health information databases is underway in Europe and the United States. For example, Biobank Norway will spend more than 13 million USD on the establishment of a biobank-based research infrastructure [2]. Many similar joint efforts on biobank infrastructure and research are available, in which governments around the world fund activities. Population-based health surveys and research biobanks gain much attention from TBI researchers and substantial international funding, such as the National Institute of Health in the United States, which is the largest funder of basic biomedical research in the world. Investments in the public health system enable large-scale surveys on medical issues to collect data and biological materials from large populations. The results of these surveys with the corresponding biomedical data or samples often turn into international open resources for TBI research. The Janus Serum Bank is an example of a useful biobank [3]. In this biobank, which includes 170,000 clinical samples, blood samples reserved for cancer research were collected through Norwegian health screening studies. Researchers in the field of biology, medical science, bioinformatics and health care systems will benefit from those types of biomedical databases and biobanks. For example, Thomas et al., applied bioinformatics approaches to identify pathways related to human leukemogens by using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database [4].",

Nowadays, physical examination results are analysed only by individual doctors. Future HIT will provide additional references of auxiliary diagnoses by contrasting these diagnoses with past clinical cases in the database. The IT service will substantially increase the efficiency and reliability of the medical diagnosis without increasing costs. Personalized Medicine and Telehealth may be achieved along with the development of HIT. The development of HIT usually begins with the construction of large biomedical databases [6,7,8]. Of course, some small-scale medical databases were also helpful to the public health professionals [9].",

Most of these databases are open to researchers free of charge. The prominent development of bioinformatics depends on the availability of biomedical databases. However, the existing databases mainly focus on laboratory studies instead of clinical studies. The completion and maintenance of these databases mainly depend on research funds from the government. Therefore, the current biomedical databases are still far from clinical auxiliary diagnoses. Few clinical databases have been established, such as ClinicalTrials, which currently lists 144,133 studies with locations in 50 states and 185 countries [15]. However, a large part of those studies achieved poor results. Reliable clinical databases are still in highly demand in TBI.",

            "text": "These biomedical databases can be roughly classified into three categories, according to the origin and properties of data. The first category, represented by ClinicalTrials [15] and Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR) [16], which data came from biological studies or clinical trials is accumulated by scientific experiments. The scientific experiments were always designed for specific purposes, and the test objects were always selected. Consequently, the experimental data were restricted to a specific target field and had been investigated thoroughly before being included in the database. Not surprisingly, these multifarious data have little residual value for TBI researchers. The second category of biomedical database comes from gigantic scientific projects, such as the Human Genome Project (HGP) [13]. These prospective databases were directly designed for fundamental research, instead of a small-scale scientific topic. Before the data of genes were sequenced on a large-scale and collected, the standard data structure and file formats were defined in advance. Besides, the data acquisition in HGP was separated from in-depth analysis of the data, so the database could expand at a breathtaking speed. The final database is standard and ready for data processing, which greatly improved the research methodologies of genetics and correlative disciplines [17]. However, the investment of HGP reached an unparalleled peak in the field of biology and medical science. The third category of biomedical database is accumulated by hospitals. Incomputable clinical data are generated in the global healthcare system every day. These valuable data are derived from real clinical cases, rather than from simulation tests on animal models. In fact, they were used data of doctors, which means the costs of data acquisition have been majorly covered by the healthcare system. When the clinical data are translated to electronic health records (EHRs) in a public database, TBI studies will be greatly stimulated [18]. Unfortunately, these clinical databases often raise concerns about the privacy of patients, and are subject to multiple protections by laws and ethics rules. Moreover, the medical records are often irregular due to the multifarious treatment processes of different patients. Many researchers have conducted a large amount of pilot studies in clinical knowledge management. However, most of these studies have not entered into clinical use because of the high cost of data acquisition and the traditional work habits of doctors and nurses [19,20].",

Bioinformatics researchers seem to be the exclusive beneficiaries of EHRs at this stage. Therefore, two main strategies were proposed because of these circumstances. The first strategy is a compromise between the present healthcare systems and HIT, i.e., traditional medical records will be converted into EHRs without changing the equipment and working habits of the existing system. The primal challenge of this strategy is the cost and efficiency of EHR conversion. The second strategy aims to redesign medical tools to generate automatically standard EHRs during the manipulation of doctors and nurses. It will change the machines, instead of the doctors and nurses, to avoid the conversion of medical records. According to the second strategy, the project of human signal-molecule-profiling database (HSMPD) was proposed to take advantage of the current healthcare system to build a standard prospective database as HGD. HSMPD is different from the first category of biomedical databases, because it will not be limited by any scientific experiment and will not select the donors of clinical data. HSMPD is also different from the third category of bio-databases, or a data warehouse of common EHR. The data in HSMPD are designed and standardized on the purpose of TBI, which contains large quantity of redundant information to doctors, (shown in Figure 1). Besides, the HSMPD project is required to solve both the ethical and economic problems at the same time.",

            "text": "In this study, a 1,536-chamber microfluidic chip prototype called \u201csignal molecular profiling (SMP) chip\u201d was developed as a specific tool for the data acquisition of HSMPD. It can standardize the detection of multiple signal molecules in one blood sample. Signal molecules, e.g., hormones and cytokines, are biochemical molecules released in one part of the body and deliver messages to affected cells in other parts. Although the concentrations of signal molecules are usually extremely low, signal molecules are important to maintain and regulate the functions of the human body. SMP can be regarded a composite order set of the human body that can provide holographic data of the entire human body. Moreover, SMP is related not only to human gene mapping, but also to the interactions between the human body and the environment [21]. The concentrations of signal molecules could reveal the status of personal health [22]. When SMP changes irregularly, some drastic activities have been or will be occurring in the body. In most cases, this dramatic change indicates the advent of disease (e.g., cardiovascular disease, cancer and invasion of pathogens) [23]. Much effort has been made to discover the diagnostic relationships between serological biomarkers and their respective diseases. However, the progress is hampered by the absence of a high-capacity clinical database on human serological information. Only a small proportion of such diagnostic knowledge has been uncovered, whereas most mapping relationships remain unknown [24]. The network of signal molecules has a well-ordered structure, which has been studied worldwide for decades [4,6,11]. Biomedical researchers divide signal molecules into several overlapping functional clusters. Nowadays, clusters of signal molecules have been clinically employed as diagnostic bases. Translational relationships of signal molecules are more complex than what is known in physiology or pathology. For example, understanding that lung diseases have incomprehensible effects on sex hormones is difficult [25]. Medical and biological researchers find it difficult to reveal thorough relationships inside the complex system, whereas TBI researchers are competent for this work if a qualified database can be established.",

When patients go to hospitals or health centres, SMP chips could perform the routine blood tests for hormones or cytokines because of the high efficiency and competitive price of the chips. SMP information will be decoded through a web-based program before relevant analysis reports are sent back. The SMP data will be stored in the web-based HSMPD at the same time. TBI researchers can obtain commercial information of the HSMPD at an acceptable cost, thus generating a stable income to cover the deficit during data acquisition. Once the HSMPD system is thoroughly developed, the serological criterion of SMP might become a popular multipurpose diagnostic tool.

In version B of the roadmap, commercialization of the medical database is essential to balance income and expenses during the construction of HSMPD.
