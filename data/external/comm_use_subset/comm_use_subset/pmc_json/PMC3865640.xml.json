There are an increasing number of cases with severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by coronaviruses, including NL63, HKU1 [4\u20136], and human bocavirus [7], and the WU and KI polyomaviruses have been discovered to cause acute respiratory tract infections [8, 9].",

Nasal and throat swabs collected from the same children were pooled into a single tube containing virus transport medium (VTM, Copan, Brescia, Italy). The clinical symptoms of subjects are summarized in Table 1. Patients with URTIs enrolled in the study were selected by physicians according to the presence of one or more respiratory symptoms as described previously [15]. In addition to the symptoms of URTIs, patients with radiological pulmonary abnormalities, such as evidence of pneumonia, bronchopneumonia, increased lung markings, dyspnea, or abnormal pulmonary breath sounds, were diagnosed with a LRTI.

Ren et al. reported that IFV plays a major role in both URTIs and LRTIs in Chinese adults. Also, the detection rate for IFV (19.70%) in adults with URTIs is in accordance with our data from children [22]. Given that the same method of detection was used, these data may indicate that the IFV infection rate is similar in children and adults. The seasonality of IFV in children was also similar to that found in adults. IFV infection was observed most commonly during autumn and winter [22], with no infections in May, July, or June, and only one case was found in August. Considering the fact that the study was performed during the global pandemic H1N1 influence A [23], the peaks of IFV infection in our study, especially for URTIs, could be explained in part by the unusual influenza epidemiology this year, although the children recruited in our study were not attending the specific H1N1 clinic provided by the hospital.",

The correlation between coinfection and disease severity is controversial. Children with hMPV-RSV coinfection have more severe symptoms than those with a single infection [37, 38], but a negative correlation between hMPV-RSV coinfection and disease severity has also been reported [39].

In our study, a high frequency of HBoV was observed in combination with either S. mitis or group D streptococci. The concurrent prevalence of viral-bacterial infections was also evident in other viruses, such as RV, PIV, and RSV.",
