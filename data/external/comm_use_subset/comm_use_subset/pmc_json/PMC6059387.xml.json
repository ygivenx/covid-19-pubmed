Despite some inconsistent studies, the emerging consensus is that HRV transmission occurs both through contact and through aerosols [36, 37]. To quantify patterns of transmission among individuals, the majority of studies take place in households, quantifying both the extent of transmission, and the differences in susceptibility and infectiousness among household members. The simplest method tracks how many household members are infected after an identified index case [38\u201340] with studies generally finding higher transmission with children present [38, 40\u201342]. In the Seattle virus watch study, secondary transmission was higher when younger children introduced HRV into larger families [43]. Index case studies do have weaknesses, including being unable to effectively separate community from household transmission and in likely being biased toward more severe cases [44].",

We find no evidence for transmission by adults. 2. Larger households and households with younger children thus have a higher prevalence of HRV, as predicted. 3. Transmission by individuals with symptoms is higher within households. 4. We find that testing positive for coronavirus reduces the probability of acquiring HRV but that loss of coronavirus is slower in individuals testing positive for HRV. In addition to these predictions, we found that loss of HRV is reduced when others in the household are infected, presumably due to reinfection, Finally, although we lack the power to definitively distinguish frequency-dependent from density-dependent transmission [55], intrahousehold transmission is better predicted by the frequency of infected individuals than by their number.",
