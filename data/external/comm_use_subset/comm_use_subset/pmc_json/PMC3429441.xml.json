Human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) are not only a common causative agent of ARI among infants and young children, but these viruses are also associated with nosocomial acute respiratory illness in the immunocompromised, hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients [4], [5], [6]. In the USA, it is estimated that 7600 to 48000 among children age <1 year old and 8100 to 42600 children age 1 to 4 years were hospitalized with HPIVs infection annually [7].",

Based on genetic and antigenic variation, HPIVs have been divided into types 1 to 4 [9]. The majority of their structural and biological characteristics are similar, but each type infects human at different ages and causes different diseases, such as upper respiratory infection, croup, bronchitis, and pneumonia [10], [11]. Almost all children encounter HPIVs within the first few years after birth, but immunity is incomplete and re-infections occur throughout life [12]. HPIV-1 is the most common pathogen associated with croup and is marked by biennial fall epidemics [13]. The majority of HPIV-1 infections occur in children aged 7 to 36 months [12], [14]. HPIV-3 infections occur yearly, mainly in spring and summer [15].Unlike other HPIVs, approximately two-thirds of children are infected by HPIV-3 in the first year of life, mainly causing bronchiolitis and pneumonia [15]. Outbreaks of HPIV-2 usually follow HPIV-1 outbreaks depending on the time of years [16], [17], [18]. The majority of HPIV-2 infections occur in children younger than 5 years of age [6].",

In addition, the HN glycoprotein possesses the largest antigenic and genetic differences among HPIV types and strains within one type [20], [21], [22].

In the present study, 443 hospitalized children with ARI over 29 consecutive months were screened by real-time RT-PCR for respiratory viruses, including HPIV1-3, human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinovirus (HRVs), adenovirus (AdV), human coronaviruses(HCoV) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV). In order to investigate the genetic characteristics of HPIV-3 that was circulating in the Beijing region, the complete HN gene was amplified from those specimens positive by HPIV-3 real-time RT-PCR and sequenced.

In general, HPIV-1 and HPIV-2 infection were important causes of lower respiratory infections and childhood hospitalization during the epidemic seasons [7]. Reports from the United States suggested that a minimum of 50% of croup cases were caused by HPIV-1 [10], [13], [33]. However, LRIs caused by HPIV-2 have been reported much lower frequencies than LRIs caused by HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 [7]. Our finding that HPIV-3 was the predominant HPIVs epidemic in the Beijing region may be because most specimens (84.9%) were collected from hospitalized patients with pneumonia whereas few specimens from bronchitis, bronchiolitis, upper respiratory infections and none from croup were tested. In addition, differences in the age distribution may be because younger children are at higher risk for HPIV-3 infections considering that most of patients (66.1%) enrolled in this study were younger than 12 months old. Similar findings reported in another study which showed that young infants (younger than 6 months) were particularly vulnerable to HPIV-3 infections [15].

Interestingly, 77% (48/62) HPIVs infections were found as mixed infections. Among the HPIVs positive cases, co-infections with HCoV were most frequently found in children followed by HRVs, although RSV was the most common pathogen detected in our population. HRVs were identified in 16 out of 48 HPIVs co-infection cases, probably due to the increased detection sensitivity of real-time RT-PCR technologies. However, in the case of mixed infection, it has been hypothesized that picornaviruses could serve as a clinical illness promotion factor that functions additively or synergistically in the pathogenesis of lower respiratory syndromes such as bronchiolitis [37]. It was reported that RSV co-infection with HMPV may be a determination of disease severity [38], [39].

Cluster A and B contain strains mostly isolated from last century including the prototype strain, which seems to be less prevalent. Cluster C contains strains isolated from India, Japan, China and Saudi Arabia during 2003 to 2009, and was the predominant epidemic lineages of HPIV-3 in Asia. Cluster C was further classified into 4 sub-clusters C1\u20134. These findings indicate that cluster C isolates with distinct nucleotide divergence may spread widely. Although the Beijing isolates belonged to a single sub-cluster C3, multiple lineages of HPIV-3 co-circulating during the same epidemic season has been observed in this study. Lineage C3a, which contained 35 Beijing isolates, appeared to be more prevalent during the study period. Genetic analysis showed that HPIV-3 isolates were highly conserved with at least 95% and 97% identity at the nucleotide and deduced amino acid levels compared with the prototype strain (Wash/47885/57) which is consistent with previous reports [40]. Interestingly, 3 isolates, two of which are from distant provinces of China (Guangdong and Gansu) and one from the neighboring county of Japan, were genetically closely related to Beijing isolates and were grouped into lineage C3a. Our results implied that certain HPIV-3 strains have the potential to spread over different countries.",

Previous investigations suggested that the HPIV-3 F and HN glycoprotein have undergone little variation, with an overall low rate of noncumulative change and genetic heterogeneity [9], [41]. However, there has been conflicting evidence about whether the evolution of HPIV-3 is related temporally or geographically [42]. Sequence analysis of HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 strains identified that geographically-defined genetic lineages might develop [26], [43]. As shown in the phylogenetic tree, the isolates from China and Japan formed a unique branch in sub-cluster C3a. Most of the isolates from same country in recent years were likely to be clustered into the same lineages. These results suggested that variation within the HN gene of HPIV-3 could somehow be correlated with the geographic origin of the strain. Interestingly, ten unique nucleotide differences which cause 2 amino acid changes in cluster C were identified and seem to be accumulating mutations. It is in contrast to the pervious study in which the pattern of HPIV-3 was similar to that of influenza C virus with a non-progressive random variation [44]. However, because of absence of HPIV-3 sequences collected over time and that from other countries could limit our ability clarify the evolution of HPIV-3.",
