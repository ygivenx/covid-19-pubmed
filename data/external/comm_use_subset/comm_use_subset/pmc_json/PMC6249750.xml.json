Sero-surveys suggested an attack rate up to 13% of residents in heavily affected areas; livestock deaths and abortions were also noted during the outbreak [9, 11].",

The L segment encodes the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase while the M segment encodes the two glycoproteins Gn and Gc and also the non-structural protein NSm. The small segment encodes the nucleocapsid (N) protein and a non-structural protein NSs using an ambisense coding strategy [1, 2].

Jansen van Vuren et al. reported indirect IgG and indirect IgM ELISA system for humans and sheep using recombinant RVFV N protein as coating antigen [20]. Paweska et al. evaluated recombinant N protein based indirect IgG ELISA for humans and African buffalos [21, 22]. Williams et al developed an IgM capture ELISA for domestic animals [23]. In all these reports, rRVFV-N protein works well as an antigen, proving the usefulness of rRVFV-N protein. But most of the reports have used indirect IgG and IgM ELISA systems where the coating reagent is the assay antigen, which in turn is allowed to react with the test serum supposedly containing the primary antibody followed by an enzyme-labeled secondary antibody. Recombinant RVFV-N protein-based IgG sandwich ELISA and IgM capture ELISA systems for humans have not been reported. Unlike the indirect ELISAs, the IgG sandwich and IgM capture ELISAs have antibodies as coating reagents to capture the assay antigen and the IgM from test sera, respectively. It has been shown in small ruminants that IgG sandwich ELISA is more sensitive than IgG indirect ELISA [24]. For human diagnosis, indirect IgM ELISA suffers from potential false-positive results because of the existence of rheumatoid factor in some individuals and from false-negative results because of the competition from the IgG antibody [29]. IgM capture ELISA is recommended for more sensitive and more specific detection.",
