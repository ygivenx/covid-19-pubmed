As healthcare management is a provincial responsibility, this response was carried out by provinces and territories; each assuming coordination among healthcare system stakeholders within their respective jurisdictions. Regional agencies were responsible for the implementation at the local level. Overall, the Canadian response was based on the WHO framework, which outlines essential aspects for an effective response, and included components of surveillance, healthcare response, public health intervention, communication, and command. Communication, amongst all aspects of an effective public health response [4-6], was identified as a key element: to share evidence, to aid in risk assessment, healthcare planning, and public health responses but also to encourage changes in behaviors and to convey messages [7,8].",

In line with this mandate and in the face of public criticisms [12] and members' frustrations with the overall pH1N1 management, Quebec associations of infectious diseases and medical microbiologists (AMMIQ) and of public health and preventive medicine (AMSSCQ) surveyed their members in preparation for a joint, interdisciplinary CME activity, to identify learning needs as to WHO guidelines for effective healthcare emergencies response and perceived implementation issues as experienced during the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic (pH1N1). There is scant literature about physicians' perceptions about healthcare system's management of pH1N1 [13,14]. We report the results of a secondary analysis of this exploratory survey, describing AMMIQ and AMSSCQ members' perceptions of critical issues in regards to pandemic management, and highlight suggested improvements.",

Free text fields allowed respondents who chose \"other\" to further describe their practice profile. The third question aimed to document types of difficulties/frustrations, if any, physicians encountered in their practice during the pH1N1 episode. A checklist of 22 items grouped in 7 categories was provided and participants were asked to check off all that applied. Each category addressed a different aspect of the pH1N1 management: at the clinical and public health level, overall crisis management, communication process, vaccination, overall management of the two pandemic waves, and issues not covered in previous categories. Within each category, physicians had the opportunity to report on issues not previously listed. At the end of each category, they were also invited to describe, in free text, issues experienced. The final question was open-ended and asked participants to suggest improvements for the management of future pH1N1-like healthcare emergencies. There were no mandatory questions.",

Descriptive statistics were used to summarize responses to multiple-choice questions. Thematic content analysis was used for qualitative data [15]. For this qualitative analysis, open coding was used to break down free text into small units (meaning units) that conveyed distinct messages, maintaining participant's original wording. Codes were assigned to these meaning units. The data was then reorganized using these codes as the unit of analysis. The codes were organized into thematic categories. These categories, created by one investigator (CN), were then reviewed and reworked by two others (CQ, RL), using team consensus. The categories were then ordered into analytic trees (themes) with branches (subthemes) grouping the categories into higher and lower levels of conceptual abstraction. Finally, using concept mapping [16], flowcharts were created in an iterative team process to explore and refine the relationships between the meaning units, codes, categories, subthemes, and themes: this concept mapping also ensured an overarching understanding of the entire data set. Two core themes were ultimately determined: Coordination and Resources. Representative verbatim quotations were then chosen to illustrate each subtheme of these core themes.",

Communication is especially crucial in risk management [8] but also in information transfer, such as infection control measures [18] and new data on disease processes [19]. Difficulties, resulting from too many different and contradicting sources, as well as lack of flexibility, were the main areas identified as problematic. Various advisory committees may have interpreted available evidences differently, leading to contradictions. However, trust in guidelines is highly dependent on believing that the sources of those guidelines are credible.

Important highlighted areas were coordination between all involved, decision-making transparency, greater collaboration of health professionals in decision-making, greater flexibility, and a better definition of roles and credentials. Results emphasize the need to improve transparency and build stronger working relationships between physicians and health authorities. In times of emergency, a greater involvement of professional associations both in the planning of services and as a communication channel should be considered. Studies based on other qualitative research approaches (e.g., grounded theory) are needed to further understand how healthcare systems can improve the implementation of emergency response plans and empower stakeholders involved. It would also be useful to study identified gaps between national health authorities' pandemic plans and what actually happened in response at the different levels of implementation.",
