            "text": "Human airway epithelial cell (hAEC) cultures are organotypic air\u2013liquid interface (ALI) cell cultures that morphologically and functionally resemble the human airway in vivo [4]. Currently, both the upper and lower airways can be recapitulated in vitro by using this cell culture system. To establish ALI cell cultures, the cells are cultured on porous inserts where only the basolateral side is in contact with growth medium while the apical side is exposed to air, resembling the orientation of the in vivo airway epithelium. To represent different areas of the pulmonary epithelium, different cell types can be cultured in the system. Tracheobronchial hAEC cultures contain, after differentiation, different cell types, including basal, ciliated and goblet cells. Moreover, these cultures are pseudostratified and generate protective mucus much like in vivo tracheobronchial epithelium [5,6]. As a result, such cultures are ideal for virus\u2013host interaction studies with human respiratory viruses since they represent the primary entry point of these pathogens [7,8,9,10,11,12,13]. Traditionally, virus\u2013host interactions are studied in animal models and human respiratory viruses are usually investigated in ferrets and transgenic mice [14,15]. However, in order to infect these animals, viruses often have to be adapted to the animal by serial passage and this may cause both genotypic and phenotypic differences between the original human virus and the adapted one. Furthermore, it is often difficult to translate results obtained in animal models directly to human disease. Therefore, it is important to study human viruses in authentic human target cells. We, and others, have previously demonstrated that hAEC cultures serve as a universal platform for the study and propagation of human respiratory viruses [7,8,9,10,11,12,13].",

Transgenesis would enable the study of viral and/or host factors important for respiratory virus infections and allow for the elucidation of specific mechanism involved in virus\u2013host interactions by targeted gene knockdown or overexpression. However, using primary cells for genetic modification is challenging since they have a finite life span in cell culture. Primary human bronchial cells can only be limitedly passaged after isolation if differentiation capabilities are to be maintained [16]. The incorporation of the Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y-27632 has been shown to increase the number of passages primary cells can undergo in vitro without gross influence on cell differentiation capacity [17,18]. Theoretically, this would enable the generation of genetically modified well-differentiated primary human airway epithelium in vitro.",

Therefore, we established our protocol using lentiviral vectors, where the proviral genomic material is integrated directly into the cellular genome. Furthermore, such a system allows for the integration of both transgene and shRNA scaffolds for over expression and/or knockdown of both host and viral factors [20,21,22].

Once cells reached confluency, the apical and basolateral medium was changed to ALI medium, and one day later the apical side medium was aspirated, establishing ALI. The epithelial layer was allowed to differentiate for at least four weeks prior to any analyses. Basolateral medium was changed every other day during the differentiation period. Additionally, the cell layer was washed with 200 \u00b5L Hank\u2019s balanced salt solution (HBSS, Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific) once a week.",

However, intact cultures are refractory to both apical and basolateral transduction while damaged cultures can be transduced from the apical side when the basolateral side of the epithelium is exposed. In those cultures, GFP expression is only observed around the edges of damaged epithelium [33]. This is consistent with the observation that receptors for VSV-g are predominantly located on the basolateral side of polarized epithelia [34]. Since well-differentiated hAEC cultures cannot be efficiently transduced, we assessed the optimal duration and method of transduction of human bronchial cells in their undifferentiated state with VSV-g pseudotyped lentiviral particles harboring the GFP-modified pLKO backbone containing a non-mammalian shRNA control that should not target any known mammalian gene (pLKO_GFP_Scr), but will engage with the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). We observed that GFP expression in undifferentiated bronchial cells generally varied between experiments. However, suspension transduction consistently resulted in the highest percentage of GFP-positive cells. Further modifications of the protocol such as the addition of polybrene, separately or in combination with spinoculation, did not seem to increase the efficacy of transduction [35], leading to the final optimized protocol that utilizes suspension transduction for 4 h, followed by additional 24-h incubation of lentivirus containing supernatant during cell attachment in monolayer. Specifically, cells and lentiviral supernatant were incubated in suspension at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 with gentle shaking every hour for 4 h, after which the mixture was seeded in T25 culture flasks in 4 mL total BEGM. Medium was changed after 24 h, bringing the total lentiviral incubation time to 28 h. Using this protocol, we were able to transduce primary bronchial cells with an efficacy of 30%\u201370%, depending on the donor and multiplicity of infection (MOI) used.",

The cellular composition of heterogeneously transgenic hAEC cultures that have the pLKO_GFP_Scr cassette integrated in their genome does not differ from na\u00efve cultures, as measured by the division into ciliated (tubulin), goblet (Mucin1) and basal cells (NGFR) (Figure 1A). More importantly, GFP expression can be observed in all cellular subgroups within the differentiated cultures (Figure 1B). This data indicates that lentiviral transduction does not interfere with the differentiation potential of primary human bronchial cells and, importantly, that transgene expression (GFP) can still be observed 6 weeks post-differentiation using a fluorescent microscope (Figure 1C).",

By incorporating the necessary transduction, expansion and sorting steps, transgenic tracheobronchial cells cannot be seeded in LLI before monolayer passage three.

Therefore, we assessed the differentiation potential of Y-27632 treated primary human bronchial cells in our ALI conditions. Indeed, when these cells were treated with 10 \u03bcM of Y-27632 they showed increased expression of alpha6-integrin and NGFR, common basal cell markers, compared to non-treated cells in later passage (Figure 2A). The up-regulation of these basal cell markers indicates that the epithelial basal cell phenotype is induced in treated cells, prolonging their life span and differentiation capabilities in vitro. Furthermore, hAEC cultures established with treated cells showed the same cellular composition as non-treated cells up to passage (p) 4, as measured by the expression of tubulin (ciliated cells), Mucin 1 (goblet cells), and NGFR (basal cells) (Figure 2B). Thus, the removal of the inhibitor from the culture medium upon LLI culture seems to be sufficient for the cells to proceed through differentiation normally post-treatment. To confirm proper epithelial structure and morphology, hAEC cultures from both treated and non-treated cells were stained for nuclei (DAPI), cilia (\u03b2-tubulin) and tight junctions (ZO-1). In low passage (p2) the two groups share the same structure and morphology [36]. However, in p4, only Y-27632 treated cells, independent of donor, were able to maintain epithelial integrity post-differentiation. Non-treated cells in p4 seem to differentiate normally early on, evidenced by the presence of ciliated cells, but eventually the epithelial layer dissociates and detaches (Figure 2C).",

However, since the differentiation of hAEC cultures is a delicate process, constitutive knockdown of certain genes could possibly interfere with differentiation resulting in unusable hAEC cultures post-transduction. For example, the knockdown of p63, a basal cell transcription factor, results in the loss of epithelial integrity in hAEC cultures established from a cell line while p63 knockdown in primary cells results in accelerated cellular senescence and death before ALI can be established [37]. To circumvent these limitations, we aimed to establish an inducible lentiviral system for gene knockdown in hAEC cultures. To this end, we modified the inducible shRNA expression lentiviral vector pLKO_Puro_IPTG_3xLacO to express constitutively the mCherry fluorescence gene instead of a puromycin selection marker, hereafter referred to as pLKO_mCherry_3xLacO. This allows for cell sorting and microscopic evaluation of cells transduced with this shRNA cassette. Treatment of transduced cells with IPTG, a lactose mimic, induces the expression of the shRNA controlled by the lactose operon (LacO). For initial evaluation and optimization of the generation of homogenously transgenic hAEC cultures, we incorporated the non-mammalian shRNA (shSCR) in our inducible lentiviral vector (pLKO_mCherry_3xLacO).",

Upon induction, we observed approximately 40% reduction in MFI in hAEC cultures expressing shGFP1, whereas induction of shSCR and shGFP2 did not result in pronounced reduction of fluorescence (Figure 5A). This data correlates with the relative GFP mRNA expression level after IPTG-induction where a 50% reduction was observed for shGFP1 alone (Figure 5B). To further corroborate these findings, we used confocal microscopy to visualize GFP expression in transgenic hAEC cultures treated with 2 mM IPTG. Microscopic analysis showed homogenously transgenic hAEC cultures expressing both mCherry and GFP, as well as the characteristic pattern of the tight-junction marker ZO-1. Furthermore, we observed that GFP signal intensity is heterogeneously distributed in all cultures, but overall the GFP expression in shGFP1 cultures was distinctly weaker compared to shSCR and shGFP2 after induction (Figure 5C). These observations are in agreement with our previous results and provide additional validation of the functionality of our modified lentiviral vector as well as confirming that gene expression can be modulated in hAEC cultures post-differentiation via inducible shRNA-mediated knockdown.

The subsequent signaling cascade initiates the production of interferon (IFN) that leads to the induction of several hundred interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), such as the well characterized myxovirus resistance protein 1 (MxA) [41]. In order to determine whether our genetic modification influences the host innate immune response in transgenic hAEC cultures, we treated both na\u00efve and homogenously transgenic cultures (shGFP1, shGFP2 and shSCR) with exogenous poly(I:C), as a proxy for viral infection, after 6-day pre-treatment with 0 or 2 mM IPTG to induce both mRNA and protein knockdown of GFP. 24 h post poly(I:C) treatment, we assessed the expression level of MxA mRNA transcripts, revealing similar gene expression levels in both na\u00efve and transgenic cultures regardless of shRNA construct and IPTG treatment conditions (Figure 6A).

As stated previously, both na\u00efve and homogenously transgenic hAEC cultures were pre-treated with 0 or 2 mM IPTG for 6 days prior to inoculation with 10,000 PFU of HCoV-229E-GFP. Quantification of viral RNA in apical wash revealed similar replication kinetics for all conditions, indicating that general transgenesis of hAEC cultures does not influence the replication of HCoV-229E-GFP (Figure 6B). However, unfortunately we did not observe any specific reduction in replication in those cultures in which GFP-directed shRNA had been induced by IPTG (Figure 6B). Since we have demonstrated that our modified pLKO_mCherry_3xLacO lentiviral vector is functional and able to reduce the expression of cellular GFP upon IPTG induction of GFP-directed shRNAs, we speculated the failure of GFP knockdown to be cell-type specific since HCoV-229E predominantly infects non-ciliated cells [13]. Therefore, we repeated the experiment with a GFP-expressing human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV-GFP) which exhibits a ciliary cell tropism [29]. The obtained results were in accordance with our previous observations, no difference in viral kinetics between na\u00efve and homogenously transgenic hAEC cultures was observed after infection with hRSV-GFP. Moreover, as with HCoV-229E-GFP, we did not observe any reduction of viral replication kinetics in induced cultures expressing GFP-directed shRNAs (Figure 6C). This suggests that in the context of our experiments, neither HCoV-229E-GFP nor hRSV-GFP are susceptible to shRNA-mediated knockdown. However, it also indicates that our results are not cell-type dependent, further asserting the functionality of our transgenic system as a whole. Based on these observations, we rather hypothesize that the lack of knockdown is due to an insufficient amount of available shRNA within infected cells to negatively influence the exponential increase of viral GFP mRNA expression while the levels of cellular GFP mRNA are more suitable for shRNA-mediated knockdown.",

            "text": "In this study, we developed a robust and reproducible protocol to generate transgenic hAEC cultures. We demonstrate that the transduction of primary human tracheobronchial airway epithelial cells with lentiviral vectors in their undifferentiated state does not interfere with the cellular composition of the resulting well-differentiated airway epithelial cell cultures. Furthermore, we have shown that incorporation of the Rho-kinase associated inhibitor Y-27632 during the expansion phase induces a basal cell phenotype and increases the longevity of primary human bronchial cells. These results are in direct agreement with the initial publications that first described the induction and prolongation of a basal cell phenotype in primary cells without gross influence on cell-differentiation capacity [17,18]. By incorporating Y-27632 during the cell propagation phase, we increased the number of attainable passages prior to the generation of well-differentiated hAEC cultures. In parallel, by optimizing our lentiviral transduction procedure, we could reproducibly achieve a transduction efficacy between 30%\u201370% in undifferentiated bronchial cells, depending on the amount of lentivirus and donor used. This allowed us to incorporate a constitutive fluorescent reporter gene into the host cell genome that facilitates fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and the subsequent generation of homogenously transgenic hAEC cultures that differentiate normally. This fundamental change in our primary airway epithelial cell culture protocol has been pivotal to successful cellular expansion post-lentiviral transduction and, subsequently, the establishment of transgenic hAEC cultures suitable for virus\u2013host interaction studies. During the development and validation of our protocol other research groups have reported alternatives or improvements to the use of the Rho-kinase associated inhibitor to further extend the life-span of primary human bronchial cells [42,43,44,45]. We anticipate that the incorporation of these alternative inhibitors and methods will further improve the currently established protocol to generate homogenously transgenic hAEC cultures, and might even facilitate the adaptation of this protocol to primary airway epithelial cells from other species to further elucidate molecular virus\u2013host interactions without using animal models.",

            "text": "In the current study, we have demonstrated that we can modulate gene expression in transgenic hAEC cultures post-differentiation via inducible shRNA-mediated knockdown. However, gene expression modulation using shRNA requires careful evaluation of the effectiveness of individual shRNA constructs, as only one out of two shRNAs against GFP was effective in our homogenously transgenic hAEC cultures while both were effective in a cell line model. Additionally, we observed that GFP brightness was reduced by approximately 40% upon induction, and in the context of modulating host gene expression to study virus\u2013host interactions this might not be sufficient to observe a phenotype. Nonetheless, since we demonstrate that an inducible lentiviral system is operational post-differentiation, alternative methods of host gene modifications can now be explored. For instance, microRNA (miRNA) mimics in conjunction with a fluorescent reporter gene under the control of an inducible polymerase II promoter [46] would allow monitoring and quantification of the expression level of the miRNA mimic, providing a better-controlled system. Alternatively, employing inducible clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-mediated gene editing would allow the modulation of host gene expression by either repression (CRISPRi) or activation (CRISPRa) [47]. All these potential methods require lentiviral-mediated transduction, which can be achieved with the currently established protocol.",

            "text": "Unfortunately, in our experiments, we did not observe any inhibition of viral replication through shRNA-mediated knockdown targeting the GFP gene in the HCoV-229E and hRSV reporter viruses. Since we observed the same phenotype with two viruses with differential cell tropism, non-ciliated and ciliated cells respectively, there seems to be no cell-type bias for shRNA-mediated knockdown in homogenously transgenic hAEC cultures. This is further corroborated by the uniform reduction of GFP expression by shGFP1 in our double transgenic hAEC cultures, in which the MFI of GFP fluorescence is reduced by approximately 40%. Due to the low inoculation dose (MOI 0.1), we hypothesize that the amount of shRNA targeting the viral GFP mRNA transcript simply is not sufficient to achieve a pronounced reduction of the logarithmic increase of viral replication. Adaptation of the inoculation dosage or even the polymerase III promoter in the lentiviral vector to achieve a higher cellular concentration of shRNA might reveal a different phenotype. It has been reported that the viral nucleoprotein of HCoV-229E counteracts RNA silencing [48], which might also be the case for hRSV, rendering our shRNA ineffective against these viruses. Further characterization and validation of this phenomenon is fascinating but beyond the scope of this study.",
