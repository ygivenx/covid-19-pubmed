            "text": "Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a ubiquitous human herpesvirus, as evidenced by a seroprevalence of more than 95% worldwide [1]. Among human herpesviruses, VZV has the smallest genome of approximately 125 kbp, which contains at least 70 open reading frames (ORFs) and consists of two unique regions, unique long (UL) and unique short (US), each flanked by inverted repeat regions (TRL, IRL, TRS, IRS) [2], [3]. Primary VZV infection typically causes childhood varicella (chickenpox). During primary infection the virus gains access to and establishes latency in multiple cranial, dorsal root and autonomic ganglia. Varicella vaccination programs have successfully reduced the incidence of clinical disease in children in the USA by about 80% [4], [5]; however, the attenuated vaccine, like wild-type VZV, is still able to establish latency in the peripheral nervous system [6]. Both wild-type and vaccine virus can reactivate from latency, particularly in elderly and immunocompromised individuals. Reactivation is associated with a declining VZV specific T-cell immunity and can result in herpes zoster (shingles) especially in the elderly, which is characterized by severe pain and often followed by postherpetic neuralgia [7], [8]. Reactivation can also lead to progressive outer retinal necrosis and stroke by ischemic vasculopathy [9], [10]. With respect to disease severity, duration and quality-of-life impairment, VZV reactivation in adulthood can be more serious than primary childhood infection.",

As a result, our knowledge of VZV latency is based on the analysis of human ganglia removed at autopsy. However, primary human ganglia have several disadvantages: (i) they can only be cultured for a few days in vitro, (ii) the availability of human ganglia is limited, (iii) the time between death and tissue collection cannot be predetermined, (iv) there are considerable human to human variations including preexisting virus burden and time since primary VZV infection, and (v) since most ganglia explants contain latent VZV, it is difficult to perform prospective studies using VZV with defined genetic mutations. Therefore, our understanding of VZV latency largely represents a snapshot of human ganglia that show a high degree of variability [11] taken shortly after death.",

Enzymatically dissociated human DRG show neurite outgrowth when maintained in culture and have facilitated the analysis of apoptosis inhibition mediated by VZV in neurons [12], [13]; however, since the cultures can be maintained for only a few weeks, their application to study latent infection is limited. Human fetal DRG can be maintained for eight weeks as xenografts under the kidney capsule of SCID mice [14], and the virus gene expression profile at eight weeks post-infection in DRG xenografts is comparable to latently infected adult trigeminal ganglia; however, difficulties in maintaining viable DGR xenografts along with ethical concerns regarding fetus-derived tissue has limited their widespread utilization.",

While human neurospheres maintained in mice can be infected with VZV and show no obvious virus-induced cytopathic effect, time course experiments using this system are technically challenging and costly [15]. In addition, differentiated human pluripotent stem cells can be infected with VZV and are useful to visualize retrograde virus axonal transport; however in these cultures, VZV initiates lytic replication that appears to be related to the neuronal purity [16], [17], [18]. Neuronal cultures lacking significant numbers of glia or astrocytes can be infected, show no virus-induced cytopathic effects (CPE) and do not produce infectious virus; but, it is challenging to obtain these short-lived cultures of pure neurons [19]. Taken together, the available neuronal models to study VZV interactions are hindered by their limited availability, elaborate maintenance requirements, limited lifespan, neuronal purity and significant ethical concerns.",

The 3D NHNP TLAs can be maintained for at least three months following VZV infection. During this time, VZV DNA was readily detected, VZV immediate-early, early and late genes were transcribed, no VZV-induced CPE was observed, but low amounts of infectious virus were released into the culture medium. Importantly, the VZV genome was stable throughout the three month infection period, suggesting that the 3D NHNP TLA culture system may be useful to investigate the long-term interplay between VZV and neural tissue.",

Comparison of 2D and 3D cultured NHNP cells by mFISH respectively showed no chromosomal rearrangements or breaks, indicating genetic stability of NHNP TLAs for at least a six month period in culture (Fig. 1A\u2013B). Flow cytometry analysis confirmed that after 180 days in culture, NHNP TLAs expressed neuronal progenitor markers CXCR4, CD133, CD105-Endoglin, CD 90-Thy-1 and CD49f-\u03b16 Integrin at levels comparable to the parental NHNP (2D) cell population (Table 1). Markers of hematopoietic differentiation, CD38+ (Table 1) and CD45+ (data not shown) were not detected in either culture. An example of the tissue-like complexity of the NHNP TLA constructs is shown by environmental scanning electron micrographs (ESEM) in Fig. 1C\u2013F, which illustrate the relative size, density, and indistinguishable nature of the individual neural cells in the tissue assembly. In addition, confocal microscopy confirmed that NHNP TLAs expressed mature neuronal markers: neuron-specific nuclear protein (NeuN), \u03b2-Tubulin-III, microtubule associated protein A&B (MAP 2 A&B), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (Fig. 2A). TLA microcarrier substrates alone did not show autofluorescence (data not shown). Similarly, progenitor (Nestin) and mature (\u03b2-Tubulin-III) neuronal markers were detected by immunohistochemistry in human TG removed at autopsy (Fig. 2B). Quantitative analysis of mRNA expression revealed higher levels of the early progenitor markers CXCR4 and CD133 in NHNP TLAs than in human TG (Fig. 2C) even though only few NHNP cells expressed the two proteins (Table 1). Later stage developmental markers, CD105, CD90 and CD49f, were expressed to a lesser extent in NHNP TLAs than in human TG, suggesting that NHNP TLAs are less differentiated than primary TGs. Neuronal markers Nestin and \u03b2-Tubulin-III were expressed at comparable levels in TG and NHNP TLAs (Fig. 2C). Lower expression levels in the NHNP TLAs than in human TG were observed for the neuronal marker neurofilament 200 (NF-200), again indicating NHNP TLAs are generally less differentiated than human TG. Taken together, our data indicated that NHNP TLAs, which had undergone 18\u201320 fold expansion over the three-month time period, share some similarities but are less differentiated when compared to mature human TGs removed at autopsy.",

Correct incorporation of eGFP and mRFP coding sequences was confirmed by PCR, DNA sequencing and multiple RFLP analyses (Fig. 3B). The p63G/70R BAC was then transfected into MeWo cells, resulting in reconstitution of the recombinant virus (v63G/70R). Upon virus reconstitution, ORF63-eGFP and ORF70-mRFP expression was readily detected in all plaques (Fig. 3C, upper panel), confirming that both loci were expressed in infected MeWo cells. Upon subsequent passages of v63G/70R, plaques developed in which only either eGFP or mRFP were expressed (Fig. 3C, middle and lower panel), suggesting that recombination between the IRS and TRS regions had occurred. PCR analysis of multiple isolated plaques positive for only eGFP or mRFP indicated homogeneity in the fluorescent tag, thus confirming that both ORF63 and ORF70 contained the same mutation (data not shown), and confirming the suspected recombination. Growth kinetics showed no significant effect on virus replication due to insertion of the fluorescent proteins into ORF63/70 (Fig. 4A). Taken together, our data indicated that recombination between the IRS and TRS region occurred frequently in cultured MeWo cells, which resulted in a stable replacement of IRS or TRS with their respective counterparts, TRS or IRS, respectively.",

After 18 dpi, VZV genome copy numbers remained constant (Fig. 4B). To compare the overall health of VZV infected MeWo cells grown in 2D to VZV infected NHNP TLAs grown in 3D, glucose utilization pre- and post-VZV infection was monitored (Fig. 4C). Each culture was maintained initially for 39 days to establish a baseline glucose consumption rate. Upon v63G/70R infection, glucose utilization rapidly declined in MeWo cells, most likely a consequence of lytic VZV replication as seen microscopically by extensive VZV-induced cytopathic effects (data not shown). In contrast, glucose uptake in NHNP TLAs was not altered as a response to VZV infection (Fig. 4C), suggesting that limited, if any, lytic VZV infection occurred. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed to determine if the virus genome was transcribed in infected NHNP TLAs. Transcript levels of the immediate-early gene ORF63 increased over time and correlated to the amount of VZV genome copies (Fig. 5A). Further analysis showed that late VZV gene ORF 9 and ORF 40 transcripts also increased in abundance (Fig. 5B).",

            "text": "Establishment of latent infection and subsequent reactivation is integral to the alphaherpesvirus life cycle and ensures that virus is maintained in the population by intermittent virus production and transmission [22]. However, VZV appears to be unique among alphaherpesviruses with respect to establishment of and reactivation from the persistent/latent state [23]\u2013[26], emphasizing the need for accurate nomenclature. VZV-host interactions are classified as acute, \u201crapid production of infectious virions followed by rapid resolution and elimination of infection\u201d, or persistent, \u201cvirus particles or products continue to be produced for long periods in which virions are continuously or intermittently produced\u201d [27]. In most human cells in culture, VZV infection is acute and cells succumb to virus infection within 3\u20135 days most likely through apoptosis [28]\u2013[31]. The low ratio (1\u223640,000) of infectious to defective VZV particles indicates that production of complete virions is extremely inefficient [32]. Human neurons are known to be latently infected by VZV, but the lack of a suitable animal model has hindered investigations into this exceptional relationship between VZV and a host cell or organ. Our common understanding is that VZV infection of neurons results in latency. Latency is an extreme variant of persistent infection where, as exemplified by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), \u201cinfectious virions can no longer be isolated\u201d [27]. During latency, most HSV-1 genes are silenced through epigenetic modification of resident histones or by virus-specific miRNAs [33]\u2013[35]. Therefore, HSV-1 gene transcription in infected neurons is restricted to the latency-associated transcript (LAT) at the cellular level, while no viral proteins and infectious virions are produced [36]\u2013[38].",

While VZV DNA is present and virus-induced CPE was not detected either microscopically or by monitoring total glucose uptake, VZV genes are transcribed, IE63 is translated, and small amounts of infectious virions are intermittently produced. The observation that the quantity of late VZV transcripts directly correlates to IE63 transcription and viral genome copies, suggests that many cells could express these transcripts and potentially produce infectious virus. Alternatively, late transcripts as well as infectious cell-free virions could be derived from very few cells that productively replicate VZV. While at least 12 VZV genes are transcribed in human ganglia removed at autopsy [39]\u2013[41] and IE63 protein production is commonly detected [42], it is known that the extent of VZV transcription increases with longer times between death and tissue analysis [43]. Hence, it has been argued that transcription of multiple virus genes detected in human ganglia most likely reflects reactivation of latent virus genomes [44], [45]. Thus, while multiple viral genes are transcribed in infected NHNP TLAs and in human trigeminal ganglia containing VZV DNA at autopsy, the former is a long-term permissive infection and the later most likely reflects early stage virus reactivation.",

The ability to maintain VZV infection for extended times along with the ease of experimental manipulation allows us to investigate the VZV life cycle in an in vitro system for the first time. Our 3-month experiment was operator-terminated, and the healthy cultures still contained VZV DNA. As such, infected NHNP TLAs in 3D culture provide an excellent means to investigate chronic virus-neuron interactions. An additional attribute of the 3D cultures is that they allow introduction of autologous VZV-specific CD8 T-cells with the aim of immune surveillance that would remove cells actively producing virus. Previous studies on HSV-1 showed that CD8 T-cell surveillance within latently infected human and mouse trigeminal ganglia may help maintain latent infection [46]\u2013[56]. This in turn could be also true for VZV and could allow the establishment of latently infected NHNP cultures by the addition of CD8 T-cells.",

Various TLAs systems have been shown to exhibit morphologies, growth characteristics, and cytokine expression similar to human lung, liver, and small intestine [57]\u2013[62]. Therefore, TLAs provide a promising platform to model viral infections of human cells in a 3D environment that is similar to the natural tissue. We have shown previously that human bronchio-tracheal tissue maintained as 3D-TLAs (HLEMs) can be used to investigate respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV3) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [57], [60], [63], [64] infections. HLEMs can be maintained for at least two months and can facilitate the discrimination between pathogenic and attenuated RSV and PIV3 strains based on viral replication efficiencies and inflammatory responses. In addition, SARS was shown to replicate for up to two weeks in HLEMs without TLA destruction [57], [63], [64]. The NHNP TLAs we constructed can also be used to investigate other neurotropic viruses (West Nile, Dengue and Vesicular Stomatitis Virus [VSV]) [65]\u2013[66, unpublished data].",
