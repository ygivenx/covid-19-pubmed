Two measured units were all air system, which only had a coarse efficiency filter, and the unit is also provided with a heater, cooler and fan etc. Both units are the primary return air system and the filters are removable types. The running time of the air conditioning system is from May to October, and the daily operation period is 08:00\u201321:00. All components are cleaned every two years.

The non-woven fabrics were put into sterile water and stirred to make sure that organic substance on the non-woven was fully dissolved in sterile water. Then, the samples of sterile water containing organic substances were prepared in 10 times and 100 times diluted concentration, respectively. There are 10 sampling points in unit A and 5 points in B, and two measuring point positions of the units are shown in Fig. 1.",

Then add an \u2018A\u2019 base to each 3\u2019 end to make it easier to add adapters. After all that, fragments too short would be removed by Ampure beads. For genomics DNA, we use fusion primer with dual index and adapters for PCR, fragments too short would be removed by Ampure beads too.

Actual measurement and a series of studies were carried out on microbial pollution characteristic, and the results are shown as below:The bacterial colony forming units of the two measuring points in unit B were 192 cfu/cm2 and 828 cfu/cm2, respectively, which exceeded the hygienic specification of central air conditioning ventilation system in public buildings of China (\u2264100cfu/cm2), and the rest of the test points met the relevant standards of China. The distribution of bacteria was more than fungi, and the concentration was higher. With the total characteristics of different distribution density, the area of dust associated microorganisms and the air pollution were more serious.Alternaria spp., Candida spp., Cercospora spp. and Cladosporium spp. existed in both units. The Candida spp. accounted for 80% in Unit A, and the Cladosporium spp. occupied 50% in Unit B. The composition of fungi in B was more complicated. Two dominant fungi are both deleterious to health, so the timely maintenance and cleaning are required. It is suggested that the operating space should be reserved in the air conditioning room, so as to avoid incomplete cleaning and disinfection.Within the experimental temperature and relative humidity, with the increase of relative humidity or temperature, the colony growth of the same strain showed an increasing trend. For the prediction model of the fungus growth, the study found that the overall fitting effect of Logistic model is better, and R2 values were greater than 0.97. Logistic model for the Cladosporium spp. growth was better than Gompertz model. At the same time, considering the influence of temperature and relative humidity, the square root model can well predict the growth of Cladosporium spp. It provides a theoretical basis for the growth of fungi in the air conditioning system under the hygrothermal environment conditions.",
