When samples are collected up to 5\u20137 days after the onset of symptoms, viral RNA can often be identified in serum or urine, and RT-PCR is the preferred test for ZIKV, and also for DENV and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) detection [10]. After this period, IgM antibodies may be detected by ELISA; however, flaviviruses have strong cross-reactivity, which may generate false positive results in serological tests [4,11]. This makes diagnosis of ZIKV infections quite a challenge, especially because the disease emerged in regions where other flaviviruses are endemic. Therefore, plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT) is indicated to measure virus-specific neutralizing antibodies and may be able to determine the etiology of infection [12].",

The assay maintained relative specificity of traditional PRNT and was further evaluated with 258 clinical serum specimens, displaying a 93.1% agreement with the traditional ZIKV PRNT titers [26,27].

In this context, cross reactivity between ZIKV and DENV is quite expected, as the viruses envelope proteins share a high degree of homology with a sequence identity of 54% and nearly identical structures. The fusion loop, that is an important antibody target, is 100% conserved between the two viruses [11].
