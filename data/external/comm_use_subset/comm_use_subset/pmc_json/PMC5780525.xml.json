Human coronaviruses (HCoV) OC43, 229E, NL63, and HKU1 are associated with a wide range of upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) and, occasionally, lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), including pneumonia and bronchiolitis [1\u20134], particularly in children [5]. Although HCoV is widespread globally [6\u20138], the frequency of detection of its four major strains varies significantly both by geography and over time [9\u201313]. Despite these features of its epidemiology, few long-term studies of the prevalence of HCoV strains and their clinical manifestations have been undertaken [14\u201316]. This paucity of evidence has led to an incomplete characterization of the epidemiology and clinical presentation of HCoV across different contexts.",

Our study found that HCoV prevalence among patients presenting with ARTI in Guangzhou over a 7-year period was highest in the spring and autumn (Fig. 2). This stands in contrast to other studies which find higher prevalence of HCoV infection in winter and spring [16, 20]. We also found different seasonal prevalence patterns for each of the four HCoV strains, with peak frequencies of 229E, NL63, and OC43 occurring mostly in the spring and autumn in Guangzhou, although OC43 had lower peaks appearing in July 2012 and 2013, however (Fig. 2). Other studies conducted in Hong Kong have shown that, while the highest frequencies of NL63 and OC43 cases occurred in autumn and winter during the period 2005\u20132007 [25], OC43 and HKU1 cases peaked in winter and NL63 prevalence was highest in summer and autumn during the period 2004\u20132005 [14]. In the United States, 229E, OC43, and HKU1 have been shown to follow different seasonal patterns, with outbreaks of 229E occurring in winter, OC43 in spring and autumn, and HKU1 in summer [20]. Although these seasonal patterns vary between countries and over time, it is apparent across all studies that the prevalence of HCoV among children is lowest in early summer.",

When we compared the clinical presentations of patients with a single HCoV infection to those with co-infections, we found that abnormal pulmonary rales occurred more frequently in the former group, while fever was more prevalent in the latter (Table 2). The results, therefore, indicate that patients infected with more than one respiratory pathogen are more likely to develop fever. Furthermore, abnormal pulmonary rales were more frequently detected among patients infected with OC43 than those infected with other strains. This suggests that HCoV-OC43 is more closely associated with LRTI. Patients with HCoV-OC43 also had the highest prevalence of broncho-pneumonia and asthma, although this was not significantly higher than among patients with other strains (Table 2). Our results are consistent with the findings of Lee and Storch [13] that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43 are associated with LRTI in children. However, Kuypers et al. [5] have found that, although HCoV-OC43 may be associated with asthma and some symptoms related to LRTI, other pathogens such as RSV may be more strongly implicated in cases of severe LRTI [26]. Recent studies have also shown that the most prevalent URTI symptoms among HCoV-positive individuals are fever, cough, sore throat, and headache [1, 19], and that LRTI including pneumonia and bronchiolitis also occasionally co-occur with HCoV [1, 5]. However, influenza-like symptoms were uncommon in our sample of HCoV-positive patients in this study.",
