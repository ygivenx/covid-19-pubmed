The exact reasons why some individuals succumbed to the infection while others remained relatively unaffected have not been clarified. Aging, an important risk factor in SARS-CoV-associated disease, is associated with changes in immunity [1],[2],[3]. Consequently, elderly individuals are at greater risk of contracting more severe and longer lasting infections with increased morbidity and mortality, exemplified by respiratory tract infections caused by influenza A virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus [4],[5],[6]. The clinical course of SARS-CoV-induced disease follows a triphasic pattern [5]. The first phase is characterized by fever, myalgia and other systemic symptoms that are likely caused by the increase in viral replication and cytolysis. The second phase of the disease is characterized by a decrease in viral replication that correlates with the onset of IgG conversion. Interestingly, it is also in this phase that severe clinical worsening is seen, which can not be explained by uncontrolled viral replication. It has been hypothesized that the diffuse alveolar lung damage in this phase is caused by an over exuberant host response [5],[7],[8]. The majority of patients recovers after 1\u20132 weeks, but up to one-third of the patients progress to the third phase and develop severe inflammation of the lung, characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [9]. The clinical course and outcome of SARS-CoV disease are more favorable in children younger than 12 years of age as compared to adolescents and adults [10],[11],[12]; elderly patients have a poor prognosis, with mortality rates of up to \u223c50% [5],[6].",

Direct support for this concept, however, is scarce. ALI and ARDS are typified by inflammation, with increased permeability of the alveolar-capillary barrier, resulting in pulmonary edema, hypoxia, and accumulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages. Inflammatory cytokines, among which IL-1\u03b2 and IL-8, play a major role in mediating and amplifying ALI/ARDS [9] and are elevated in SARS-CoV-infected patients as well [13],[14]. In vitro experiments confirm that SARS-CoV infection induces expression of cytokines/chemokines in a range of cell types [15],[17],[18]. Moreover, infection of cynomolgus macaques with SARS-CoV leads to a strong immune response, with expression of various cytokines/chemokines, resembling the host response seen in human SARS patients [19]. Nevertheless, the determinants that lead to severe virus-associated ALI/ARDS and that cause people to succumb to infection remain largely obscure, restraining development of appropriate treatments.",

Four young adult and four aged PBS-infected cynomolgus macaques were used as negative controls. During the 4-day experiment, some of the SARS-CoV-infected aged animals displayed decreased activity and mildly labored breathing. All aged infected macaques showed an increase in body temperature either during the night or during the day one to two days after infection (Figure 1A). The lungs of aged macaques showed large (multi)focal pulmonary consolidation that was severe (\u223c40\u201360% of affected lung tissue) in two macaques (Figure 1B and Figure S1). Microscopic examination revealed typical ALI-associated lesions, similar to what has been seen in SARS-CoV-infected humans that progress to ARDS [6]. Lesions involved the alveoli and terminal bronchioli, showing areas with acute or more advanced phases of diffuse alveolar damage (Figure 2). Lumina of alveoli were variably filled with protein rich edema fluid, cellular debris, alveolar macrophages and neutrophils, eosinophils, and lymphocytes (Figure 2 and Figure S2A\u2013B). Moderately thickened alveolar walls were lined by cuboidal epithelial cells (type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia; Figure 2 and Figure S2C). The epithelial origin of these enlarged type 2 pneumocytes with large vacuolated nuclei, prominent nucleoli and abundant vesicular cytoplasm was confirmed by keratin staining (Figure S2D). Hyaline membranes and multinucleated giant cells were occasionally observed in the alveoli (Figure S2E\u2013F). In contrast, all young adult animals remained free of clinical symptoms and had no or less extensive pulmonary consolidation (Figure 1A\u2013C). Hyaline membranes were not observed in SARS-CoV-infected young adult macaques. A multifocal mild chronic lymphoplasmacytic tracheo-bronchoadenitis, characterized by moderate numbers of lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages, less neutrophils and occasional eosinophils in the lamina propria of the bronchi, focally surrounding and infiltrating the submucosal glands, was observed in all young adult macaques, but not in aged macaques (Figure 2). Our data were confirmed by retrospective analysis of earlier experiments in which aged animals were used [19],[21],[22],[23]. Overall, aged macaques develop more severe SARS-CoV-associated ALI than young adults.",

Hierarchical clustering methods were used to order gene transcripts and individual aged and young adult animals to identify groups of animals with similar expression patterns. These data were plotted as a heat map in which each entry represents a gene expression value (Figure 4). As expected in an animal experiment with outbred animals, the inter-animal variation was relatively high (Figure S3). There were two major roots to the hierarchical dendogram, with one root containing the PBS-infected control animals, and the second root containing the SARS-CoV-infected animals. The root of the PBS-infected control animals was divided in two minor roots, clustering young adults together and aged animals as a group. These data suggest that the baseline expression patterns are different in young adult and aged macaques. The root of the SARS-CoV-infected animals was also divided in two minor roots, largely clustering young adult animals together and grouping aged infected macaques. The hierarchical clustering heat map suggests that both age and SARS-CoV infection are key factors involved in determining transcription of cellular genes.",

Upon analysis of these gene transcripts within the context of biological processes and pathways using Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge Base, this subset of genes showed indications for an innate host response to viral infection. Among the top significantly differentially regulated (p<0.005) functional categories were immune response, inflammatory response and hematological system development and function, which included genes like F3, IL1RL1, IL1RN, IL6, IL8, S100A8, SERPINA1, SERPINA3, NP, ACPP, TFPI2, SPP1, IGF1, EDN3, DEFB1, and SOCS3 (Figure 5A) most of which were upregulated in SARS-CoV-infected aged animals compared to young adult infected animals. In addition, three of the most significantly regulated molecular/cellular functions (p<0.005) were associated with a pro-inflammatory response and included cell death, cell movement, and cell-to-cell signalling (Figure 5A). The top gene interaction network, showing the interplay between genes during the host response to viral infection, contained NF-\u03baB as central node (Figure 5B). NF-\u03baB is a redox-sensitive transcription factor implicated to play a major role in pro-inflammatory host responses and the development of ALI/ARDS [24],[25]. Several of the 202 differentially expressed gene transcripts, among which IL1RN, SERPINA1, IL8, F3 and TFPI2, are target genes for NF-\u03baB. Thus, significant differences exist in the host response to SARS-CoV infection, corresponding with age.",

The greater number of differentially expressed genes, as well as the brighter intensities (fold changes in transcripts) included in the heat map for aged macaques, suggested that aged macaques show a more zealous response to virus infection than young adult macaques. This assumption was corroborated using Goeman's global test [26] on the defined gene subsets cell adhesion, cytokine/chemokine signalling, and apoptosis. When macaques were grouped according to severity of pathology instead of age and compared to their respective PBS-infected controls, increased numbers of differentially expressed gene transcripts and increased fold changes for differentially expressed genes in inflammatory pathways correlated positively with gross pathology scores as well (Figure S4).

For example, mRNA levels for IL8, a key player in ALI/ARDS and a potent chemotactic factor essential in acute inflammation that is induced by a wide range of stimuli among which IL1\u03b2, viral products, and oxidative stress, were strongly upregulated in SARS-CoV-infected aged macaques as compared to young adult animals (Figure 5B, 7B, 8A). Despite the overall stronger activation of innate host gene responses in SARS-CoV-infected aged animals, microarray analyses revealed that IFN-\u03b2, well-known for its antiviral activities, was not differentially expressed in aged macaques compared to PBS-infected animals, in contrast to young adults (Figure 6E). RT-PCR analysis confirmed differential expression of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA between young adult and aged macaques (Figure 8B). As shown in Figure 3, this difference in IFN-\u03b2 levels in aged and young adult macaques did not affect viral replication efficiency. IFN-\u03b2 mRNA levels, however, negatively correlated with gross pathology (Figure 8C).",

The acute lung injury observed after SARS-CoV infection in aged macaques is similar to what has been seen in humans that progress to ARDS [6]. This disease process includes an acute exudative phase, consisting of severe leukocyte infiltration, edema, the formation of hyaline membranes, and proliferation characterized by type II pneumocyte hyperplasia [33]. SARS-CoV-infected aged macaques develop more severe pathology than young adult animals, even though viral replication levels are similar.

            "text": "Comparative analyses of gene expression in aged and young adult SARS-CoV-infected macaques revealed that the host response to SARS-CoV infection is similar in nature, but differs significantly in severity in pro-inflammatory responses. Aged macaques had a stronger host response to virus infection than young adult macaques, with an increase in differential expression of genes associated with inflammation that center around the transcription factor NF-\u03baB. Comparative analysis of PBS-infected aged and young adult macaques revealed significant differences in gene expression as a result of aging only. These observations are in line with earlier hypotheses that age-related accumulated oxidative damage and a weakened antioxidative defense system cause a disturbance in the redox balance, resulting in increased reactive oxygen species. Subsequently, the oxidative stress-induced redox imbalance activates redox-sensitive transcription factors, such as NF-\u03baB, followed by the induction of pro-inflammatory genes including IL1\u03b2, IL6, TNF\u03b1 and adhesion molecules, key players in the inflammatory process [34]. Oxidative stress may also potentiate the cellular responses to IL-1\u03b2 [35], an early mediator of inflammation [36]. Thus, aging is associated not only with alterations in the adaptive immune responses, but also with a pro-inflammatory state in the host [34],[37],[38],[39]. Oxidative stress and toll-like receptor-4 signaling via NF-\u03baB triggered by viral lung pathogens, such as SARS-CoV, may further amplify the host response ultimately resulting in ALI [25]. Taking the host gene expression profiles of PBS-infected aged and young adult macaques into account, we also observed a stronger activation of the pro-inflammatory pathways in SARS-CoV-infected aged macaques than in young adults. The finding that genes activated by NF-\u03baB are significantly differentially upregulated in aged macaques infected with SARS-CoV is in line with the role of NF-\u03baB as a redox-sensitive transcription factor in pro-inflammatory host responses and the development of ALI/ARDS [24],[25]. Given the fact that several SARS-CoV proteins block NF-\u03baB signaling [40],[41],[42], we hypothesize that NF-\u03baB-signaling in non-infected cells is largely responsible for the upregulated expression of NF-\u03baB target genes, such as IL8, in aged compared to young adult macaques.",

            "text": "Previously, we demonstrated IFN induction and signalling in SARS-CoV-infected macaques early after infection [19]. Based on the observation that plasmacytoid dendritic cells are able to produce type I IFNs after SARS-CoV infection in vitro [45], it was speculated that these cells are the IFN-producing cells in lungs of SARS-CoV-infected macaques. In addition, phosphorylated STAT-1 was observed in the nuclei of numerous cells in the lungs of SARS-CoV-infected macaques, indicating that these cells had been activated by IFNs or other agonists produced in the lung [19]. In SARS-CoV-infected cells, however, STAT-1 signalling was blocked [19], consistent with the fact that a range of SARS-CoV proteins can function as interferon antagonists that inhibit IFN production and signalling [41],[42]. Therefore, a large part of the genes activated downstream of STAT-1, observed in genomics analyses, is likely due to signalling in non-infected cells [19]. In the current study, we observed that aged macaques expressed significantly lower levels of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA than young adult macaques and that IFN-\u03b2 mRNA levels correlated negatively with severity of pathology. Interestingly, aged and young adult SARS-CoV-infected macaques showed opposite expression patterns for type I IFN-\u03b2 and certain pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-8. These data are corroborated by previous observations showing that higher amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1\u03b2 and IL-8, are produced upon stimulation of leukocytes of the elderly, whereas induction of type I IFNs is decreased compared to young adults [46],[47],[48].",

Evidence for such a cross-regulation between type I IFN/STAT-1 and pro-inflammatory/NF-\u03baB signaling pathways exists. Type I interferons exert significant anti-inflammatory effects and provide at least partial protection from disease in collagen-induced arthritis, auto-immune encephalitis, and multiple sclerosis [49],[50],[51],[52],[53]. Not only inhibits IFN-beta expression of the IL8 gene at the transcriptional level [54], type I IFNs can also activate TAM receptor tyrosine kinases that inhibit toll-like receptor-induced cytokine-receptor cascades [55],[56] and induce the immunosuppresive cytokine IL-10 [57]. Direct NF-\u03baB/STAT-1 protein-protein interactions [58] and modification of STAT-1 by acetylation, may be involved in this process [30]. A loss of type I IFN/STAT-1 signaling in aged macaques may negatively regulate interferon-induced gene expression and type I IFN signaling, which may lead to enhanced inflammatory responses. On the other hand, increased activation of NF-\u03baB signaling pathways in aged macaques may negatively regulate interferon-induced gene expression and type I IFN signaling [29],[59],[60], which may enhance pro-inflammatory responses even further.",

The model depicts the innate immune response to SARS-CoV infection as a coordinated series of signaling pathways aimed at clearing the virus while not harming host cells. Upon SARS-CoV infection, infected cells, depicted in the model as pneumocytes, produce inflammatory mediators that activate NF-\u03baB, resulting in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as IL-8. IL-1 is one of the cytokines highly upregulated on day 1 after infection upon SARS-CoV infection of macaques [19] and capable of activating NF-\u03baB. At the same time, the virus is recognized by sentinel cells, such as pDCs, that produce type I IFNs to signal that a foreign invader has entered the host. The production of IFN induces neighboring non-infected cells to remodel the intracellular environment by producing a range of antiviral proteins, aiding in a block of viral replication. A cross-regulation between the \u201cantiviral\u201d and \u201cpro-inflammatory\u201d pathways occurs, which is a critical requirement to allow fine-tuning of the host response to infection and return to homeostasis. Disease outcome may be determined by the relative contribution of \u201cantiviral\u201d and \u201cpro-inflammatory\u201d pathways and apparently aging influences this intricate balance significantly.",

Our own in vitro experiments and the type I IFN intervention in SARS-CoV-infected aged macaques indicate that type I IFNs can play a role in mitigating pro-inflammatory host responses and severity of pathology. Therapeutic treatment of SARS-CoV-infected aged macaques with type I IFN reduces pathology and diminishes pro-inflammatory gene expression, including IL-8 levels, without affecting virus replication in the lungs. Antiviral effects of type I IFNs were not obvious, probably due to the fact that SARS-CoV infected cells inhibit STAT-1 signalling and viral replication peaks early after infection when treatment with pegylated IFN-\u03b1 started. Given the fact that phosphorylated NF-\u03baB was present mainly in the nuclei of non-infected cells in the lungs of SARS-CoV-infected macaques, these cells are potential targets for the action of IFN and subsequent STAT-1 signalling. It remains uncertain whether endogenously produced IFNs in young adult macaques are essential in the control of inflammatory responses or that enhanced activation of inflammatory pathways simply does not occur. Our data are in line with the observation that treatment of SARS-CoV-infected aged mice with type II IFN-\u03b3, which like type I IFN also signals via STAT-1, protected against lethal respiratory illness, seemingly without an effect on viral replication [61]. Moreover, in humans with SARS, use of type I IFNs was associated with reduced disease-associated hypoxia and a more rapid resolution of radiographic lung abnormalities [62]. Whether the anti-inflammatory action of type I/II IFNs in macaques, mice and humans occurs via common pathways and is interchangeable between host species remains to be determined. Assuming that there is a conserved pathway in ALI/ARDS induced by multiple pathogens, including pandemic viruses that may emerge from avian influenza, modulation of the host response by type I IFNs provides a promising outlook for novel intervention strategies.",

Four young adult mock (PBS) infected animals from a previous study [19] and four aged macaques were taken as controls. Lung tissues stored in RNA-later from three cynomolgus macaques, 13 years old, previously inoculated with SARS-CoV strain HKU39849 and treated with pegylated IFN-\u03b1 at a dose of 3 \u00b5g/kg intramuscularly on days 1 and 3 after infection, were taken along for molecular analyses [22]. All animals were infected with the same dose of virus, using the same inoculation procedure, by the same person to minimize inter-experiment variation. All animals were checked daily for clinical signs and anaesthetised with ketamine on days 0, 2 and 4 after infection to collect oral, nasal, and rectal swabs [22]. All animals were euthanized on day 4 post infection. Necropsies and sampling for histology/immunohistochemistry were performed as described [22]. The percentage of affected lung tissue from each lung lobe was determined at necropsy, recorded on a schematic diagram of the lung and the area of affected lung tissue was subsequently calculated (gross pathology score).",

Correction for multiple testing was achieved by requiring a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05, calculated with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure [67]. To understand the gene functions and the biological processes represented in the data and obtain differentially expressed molecular and cellular functions, Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge Base (http://www.ingenuity.com/) was used. Heat maps of pro-inflammatory pathways were produced using complete linkage and Euclidian distance in Spotfire DecisionSite for Functional Genomics version 9.1 (http://www.spotfire.com/) and Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge Base (http://www.ingenuity.com/), using log (base 2) transformed expression values with minimum and maximum values of the color range being \u22124 and 4, respectively. Differences between conditions in expression of specific pro-inflammatory pathways, e.g. direct comparison of defined gene sets (aged versus young adult and aged versus aged IFN-treated animals), were tested by Goeman's global test procedure [26]. Hierarchical clustering analysis of normalized log-2 based hybridization signals of individual young adult and aged macaques of a set of gene transcripts that were identified as being differentially regulated (fold change \u22652; FDR<0.05) in at least one of the comparisons of young adult versus young adult PBS or aged versus aged PBS animals were created using Spotfire DecisionSite for Functional Genomics version 9.1 (http://www.spotfire.com/) with complete linkage and Eucledian distance parameters.",
