Its rapid transmission and high rates of mortality and morbidity resulted in a significant threat to global health by the spring of 2003, and the epidemic had a significant effect on the public health and economies of locales affected by SARS outbreaks. The rapid response of the World Health Organization is credited with containing this contagion by late June 2003, and only a few cases were reported during the winter cold season of 2003\u20132004. The severity of this crisis mobilized the scientific community as well: by March 24, 2003, scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and in Hong Kong had announced that a new coronavirus had been isolated from patients with SARS (reviewed in [1]). The sequences from two isolates of SARS-CoV were published simultaneously on May 1, 2003 [2,3].",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are enveloped animal viruses that cause respiratory and enteric diseases. Analysis of the SARS-CoV genome revealed that, similar to all coronaviruses, the 70% (approximately) at the 5\u2032 end of its large single (+) stranded RNA genome consists of two sizable genes called ORF1a and ORF1b. The 3\u2032 ORF1b overlaps, and is out of frame with, its 5\u2032 neighbor, ORF1a, and similar to other coronaviruses, a programmed \u22121 ribosomal frameshift (\u22121 PRF) was posited to be used by the virus to produce an ORF1a/1b fusion protein [2]. A wide range of RNA viruses use \u22121 PRF for the production of viral fusion protein (reviewed in [4\u20136]). In many such cases, e.g., the Retroviridae and Totiviridae, the efficiency of ribosomal frameshifting determines the stoichiometric ratio between structural and enzymatic proteins available for viral particle assembly, and even small changes in frameshift frequencies can have profound negative effects on virus propagation, thus targeting \u22121 PRF for antiviral therapies (reviewed in [7]). It has been shown that the SARS-Cov \u22121 PRF signal is able to promote efficient frameshifting in a rabbit reticulcyte system, and the \u22121 PRF signal reported in that publication consisted of a typical heptameric \u201cslippery site\u201d (UUU\nAAAC), a 5-nt spacer, and a typical H-form mRNA pseudoknot containing two double-stranded RNA stems and two single-stranded loops [8]. Two very recently published papers have suggested that the SARS-CoV mRNA pseudoknot may contain a third stem-loop structure [9, 10]. In this work, we present computational, comparative genomic, molecular, biophysical, and genetic evidence demonstrating that the SARS-CoV frameshift signal includes a new type of highly ordered three-stemmed mRNA pseudoknot that likely contains a large number of noncanonical base interactions. Although total deletion of the third stem does not significantly alter frameshifting efficiency, its disruption significantly inhibits this process. The fact that this general structure appears to be conserved among the coronaviruses raises questions regarding its biological function.\n",

The nucleotide sequence suspected of featuring a \u22121 PRF signal between ORF1a and ORF1b was scanned by RNAMotif [12], using a pattern-based description capable of finding common \u22121 PRF signals in other RNA viruses. As expected, a so-called slippery site (UUU\nAAAC) and a large H-type pseudoknot were identified\u2014the two primary stimulating elements required for efficient ribosomal slippage. This analysis was coupled with Pknots [13], a software package that predicts the most thermodynamically stable structure for a given RNA sequence. The predicted structure for the SARS-CoV frameshift signal was extremely stable, with a calculated minimum free energy (MFE) of \u221226.68 kcal/mol. The surprising result was that the 29-nt sequence designated loop 2 by Thiel et al. [8] was predicted to form a third helix, nested within the sequences defined by stems 1 and 2 (Figure 1B). Though a small, internally nested third helix (helix-3) has been shown to be present in the HIV-1 group O frameshift signal [14], such an extensive basepairing pattern has not to our knowledge been heretofore demonstrated for any other viral frameshift signal. To determine the statistical significance of this finding, a distribution of MFE values taken from 500 randomly shuffled SARS-CoV frameshift signals was created. Each of the randomly shuffled sequences was folded using Pknots with the same parameters. The resulting normal distribution had mean MFE of \u221221.12 kcal/mol (standard deviation = 2.67, 500\u00d7), revealing that the predicted three-stemmed pseudoknot structure of the native sequence is highly significant with a z-score of \u22122.05 and a p value of 0.02 (one-tailed Student's t-test).\n",

The SARS-CoV frameshift signal itself is homologous to all of the nine other frameshift signals for coronaviruses whose genomes have been fully sequenced. A multiple sequence alignment of the ten coronavirus frameshift signals is presented in Figure 2. This shows that both stems 1 and 2 are highly conserved, with a strong conservation of base complementation in the cores of both stems 1 and 2 (blue and red sequences, respectively). This analysis also shows all of the coronavirus frameshift signals have the potential to form a third helix, although the structures and sequences are less well conserved (Figure 2, in green). In addition, the potential of sequences located approximately 200 nt downstream of the slippery site to form long-range \u201ckissing loop\u201d interactions with the 5\u2032 half of stem 2 was previously noted for HCoV-229E [16] and TEGV [17]. This property was only conserved among all of the group 2 coronaviruses, not in any of the others (see Figure 2). The potential significance of this observation is discussed below. A phylogenetic tree of the \u22121 PRF signals constructed from the multiple sequence alignment is presented in Figure 3. As expected, the group 1 and group 2 coronaviruses cluster together, and neither the SARS-CoV nor the avian infectious bronchitis virus (AIBV) frameshift signals cluster with either group. Of particular interest, however, is that very similar mRNA pseudoknot structures are predicted to occur within groups\u2014but not between them.",

Some notable deviations from the predicted structure were observed, however. These fell into three general classes. One class consisted of distortions in predicted helical A-RNA structures, typified by bases that were equally digested by both single- and double-strand-specific nucleases and by nearby bases that were refractory to nuclease attack. These clustered in the middle of stem 1 (13406\u201313410 and 13427), near the middle of stem 2 (13419\u201313420), and in the middle of stem 3 (13436\u201313439 and 13458\u201313461). Another major group consisted of bases located in regions predicted to link the three stems that were completely protected from nuclease attack. Specifically, these were G13405 and G13435 at the stem 1/stem 3 junction, G13414 and G13423\u2013C13425 at the stem 1/stem 2 junction, and C13463 and U13464, which link stem 2 with stem 3. We also observed enhanced susceptibility of the three pyrimidines in the predicted loop 2 region (C13447, U13448, and U13451) to attack by both single- and double-strand-specific endonucleases, suggesting that this region is structurally dynamic under the conditions assayed. The ability of the bulged adenosine residue at position 13467 to be recognized by RNaseV1 demonstrates that it is involved in a basepairing interaction, whereas the opposite pertains with regard to A13446, A13452, and A13456. The three bases at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 terminal ends of the molecule could not be meaningfully resolved.",

As a minor modification, instead of using a simple readthrough construct as the zero-frame control, the corresponding control contained the SARS-CoV \u22121 PRF signal with one additional base inserted 3\u2032 of the Renilla luciferase sequence and 5\u2032 of the \u22121 PRF signal. The resulting zero-frame reporter places the firefly luciferase ORF in frame with Renilla and inactivates the \u22121 PRF signal by moving it out of frame with regard to elongating ribosomes, while controlling for ribosomes dislodged from the reporter mRNAs by the mRNA pseudoknot. This seemed to alleviate the large errors observed by other groups using similar methodology (e.g., [9]).",

The results of these experiments are shown in Figure 6A. In vitro, the SARS-CoV sequence was able to promote efficient \u22121 PRF in both wheat germ protoplasts (23.7% \u00b1 1.9%) and rabbit reticulocytes (14.3% \u00b1 3.7%). In vivo, the sequence was able to promote efficient \u22121 PRF in the Vero epithelial cell line (14.4% \u00b1 0.6%), a finding that is important in light of the fact that the SARS-CoV infects lung epithelial cells. The sequence also promoted efficient \u22121 PRF in yeast cells, suggesting that this frameshift signal might be amenable to the molecular genetic toolbox available in the yeast system. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of a drug (anisomycin) and of a host cell mutant (mak8\u20131) that were previously shown to specifically affect L-A virus\u2013directed \u22121 PRF in yeast cells [20\u201322]. The results of these experiments show that, similar to their effects on L-A-promoted \u22121 PRF, anisomycin was able to inhibit SARS-CoV-directed \u22121 PRF (21% inhibition, p = 5.04 \u00d7 10\u22128), whereas \u22121 PRF was stimulated in cells harboring the mak8\u20131 allele of RPL3 (25% stimulation, p = 5.0 \u00d7 10\u22125) (Figure 6B). These findings show that the SARS-CoV frameshift signal is amenable to analysis by the full array of yeast-based genetic, pharmacological, and molecular tools that we and others have developed. Interestingly, the absolute values for frameshifting in yeast (2.99% \u00b1 0.06%) were significantly less than those observed in the other systems (ranging from approximately 15% to 25%), suggestive of differences between fungal and metazoan ribosomes that might be pharmacologically exploited.

Not surprisingly, disruption of stem 2 (S2A and S2A\u2032) precluded efficient \u22121 PRF. Unexpectedly, however, compensatory mutations that should promote re-formation of the basic stem 2 structure (S2B\u2032) did not restore wild-type levels of frameshifting, suggesting the involvement of a primary mRNA sequence in this region in stimulating \u22121 PRF. However, the adenosine base at position 13465 in this construct had to be replaced with a guanosine to avoid creating a \u22121 frame termination codon. Though this substitution retains the potential to basepair with U13424, it is possible that the identity of the base at this position is critical. To examine this parameter, the base at this position was changed to guanosine in the context of an otherwise wild-type \u22121 PRF signal (A13465G). Though this mutation did not abrogate efficient \u22121 PRF, frameshifting efficiency was decreased by approximately 38% (p = 1.7 \u00d7 10\u22126). This result suggests that though this mutation was not the main cause of the dramatic reduction in \u22121 PRF observed with S2B\u2032, the identity of the base at this position is important for maximizing \u22121 PRF efficiency.

Here, the coronaviruses have again revealed a new twist on mRNA pseudoknots and \u22121 PRF. The phylogenetic comparisons presented in this study reveal that stem 1 lengths and G:C compositions are highly conserved in all ten coronavirus sequences analyzed. Their relatively long G:C-rich composition presumably contributes significantly to the stability of these structures. In contrast, stem 2 structures are predicted to vary significantly between the different coronavirus groups. Specifically, the group 2 coronaviruses (HCoV-043C, HCoV-HKU1, BCoV, and MHV) have the longest and most stable predicted stem 2 structures, whereas the stem 2 regions of the group 1 coronaviruses (TGV, PDEV, HCoV-NL, and HCoV-229E) are anticipated to be the least stable. The stem 2 regions of SARS-CoV and AIBV appear to be intermediate between these two. Although the sequences in the stem 3/loop 3 region are not well conserved, a third stem independently predicted in the SARS-CoV \u22121 PRF signal [10] has been demonstrated in this work, and we predict third stems in other coronavirus frameshift signals. Similar structures are generally predicted to be able to form within groups.",

Long-range interaction anchors mediated by adenosine residues such as those at positions 13456 (stem 3) and 13467 (stem 2), making contact with the shallow minor grooves of two stacked basepairs of A-form helical stems, are a recurring theme in RNA structural biology. For example, the crystal structure of the ribosome reveals that RNA has a remarkable propensity for contributing adenine bases to such A-minor interactions [31], thereby stimulating the assembly of higher-order RNA structures [26]. Mounting evidence suggests that stimulation of \u22121 PRF by mRNA pseudoknots requires specific noncanonical basepairing between helical stems and pseudoknot loop regions to set specifically required frameshift efficiencies. The structures of the few frameshift-promoting pseudoknots that have been determined at the atomic level are revealing that a large range of higher-order noncovalent interactions serve to promote stable, novel structures [32\u201336]. It is clear that the three-helix-containing mRNA pseudoknot described here represents a novel global architecture stimulating ribosomal frameshifting, and possibly a source of new structural motifs in the coming future. Experiments are currently underway to define this structure at the atomic level, using high-resolution NMR techniques. Elucidation of this novel mRNA structure will be of great utility in the rational development of therapeutic agents designed to interfere with SARS-CoV programmed \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting, and in furthering our understanding of how different pseudoknots stimulate translational recoding.",

Possible reasons for the observed sequence specificity could include aberrant folding or disruption of an essential interaction required for formation of the complex tertiary mRNA structure. For example, the findings that changing the identities of the bulged adenosine residues in stems 2 and 3 from adenosine to cytosine (S2C\u2032 and S3C\u2032), or deleting the bulge in stem 2 altogether (S2C), abrogated the stimulatory effects of the pseudoknot support the notion that this structural property of bulged adenosine residues is functionally important in this context. In addition, water-nucleobase \u201cstacking\u201d in the form of H-\u03c0 and lone pair-\u03c0 interactions have been demonstrated at the junctions between the stems in the BWYV pseudoknot [34].

The changes made in S2C and S2C\u2032 are also adjacent to this region, and inhibition of frameshifting is nearly as dramatic as with the S2A, S2A\u2032, and S2B\u2032 mutants.",

Further, complete deletion of stem 3 had only a minimal effect on frameshifting efficiency\u2014an observation consistent with studies in AIBV, in which deletion of all but 5 nt between stems 1 and 2 did not significantly alter \u22121 PRF [27,37].

However, its high degree of conservation among the coronaviruses and its location in the frameshift signal suggest that it plays a more complex role in programmed \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting as it relates to the viral life-cycle.

It may be that frameshifting levels in coronaviruses need to be regulated in a manner not supported by a two-stem pseudoknot. For example, the frameshift signal marks the boundary between proteins required during the immediate early phase of infection (e.g., ORF1a-encoded proteases used to prepare the cell for virus production) and those required for intermediate functions in the viral life cycle (i.e., ORF1b-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and helicase used in transcription of subgenomic mRNAs, [\u2212] strand synthesis, and genome replication). One of the fundamental problems of in the biology of (+) RNA viruses regards the switch between translation and replication. An elegant model proposes that the \u22121 ribosomal frameshift in barley yellow dwarf virus plays a central role in remodeling the (+) strand from translation competent to replication competent: frameshifting enables synthesis of the replicase, which in turn is able to denature the frameshift-promoting cis-acting element, eventually clearing the (+) strand of ribosomes that could potentially block the replicase [23]. In coronaviruses, the idea of functional switching by RNA remodeling has been demonstrated for MHV [38], and similar functional elements are present in both SARS-CoV and BCoV [39].",

The phylogenetic analysis presented here reveals the potential to form similar short imperfect stem 2 structures for the other two group 1 coronaviruses for which the sequence is known (HCoV-NL and PEDV). In contrast, similar interactions cannot be readily discerned in SARS-CoV, nor among the group 2 and group 3 coronaviruses.

Second, Pknots [13] was employed to \u201cfold\u201d the sequence immediately downstream (3\u2032) to the slippery site and to produce a predicted MFE value in kilocalories per mole for the sequence. The statistical significance of the predicted MFE value of the three-stemmed RNA pseudoknot was tested by generating 500 randomly shuffled sequences derived from the native sequence, refolding each of these, and calculating their MFE values using Pknots. This resulted in a normal distribution of MFE values, against which the native sequence could be compared and z-scores calculated. FASTA3 v3.4 [40] was used to initially identify sequences homologous to the SARS \u22121 PRF signal based on primary sequence similarity. The search space included 1,724 viral genome sequences downloaded using the National Center for Biotechnology Information's Entrez Taxonomy Browser [41].

African green monkey Vero cells were cultured in DMEM with L-glutamine (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, Maine, United States) and 10% FBS at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2. Cells cultured without antibiotics were transformed with plasmid DNA, using Amaxa (Cologne, Germany) Nucleofector solution according to the manufacturer's instructions. Dual luciferase assays were performed the following day, using extracts from cells lysed with the Passive Lysis Buffer (Dual-Luciferase Reporter System, Promega, Fitchburg, Wisconsin, United States). Wheat germ and rabbit reticulocyte lysates from Ambion (Austin, Texas, United States) were used to monitor frameshifting in vitro, using synthetic mRNA transcripts (Ambion mMESSAGE mMACHINE transcription kit), generated with T7 polymerase either from plasmids that had been digested with SspI, Proteinase K treated, phenol/chloroform and chloroform extracted, and ammonium acetate precipitated, or from PCR amplicons encompassing the dual luciferase reporter cassettes. All assays were repeated until the data were normally distributed, enabling statistical analyses both within and between experiments [25]. At least three readings derived from lysates derived from a minimum of three different transfection plates were used.",

The SARS-sense and SARS-antisense oligonucleotides were annealed, gel purified, and ligated into BamHI- and SacI-digested p2luc [18], generating plasmid pJD435. The Renilla and firefly bicistronic elements were amplified by PCR using previously described primers [19], SpeI- and XhoI-digested, and cloned into p416ADH [47]. One additional base was introduced after the BamHI restriction site, using the Stratagene (La Jolla, California, United States) QuikChange XL kit to correct the reading frame. Sequence analysis revealed an additional point mutation in the firefly luciferase gene that was reverted by oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis. The resulting plasmid, pJD465, constituted the wild-type SARS-CoV \u22121 PRF yeast assay plasmid. A zero-frame control plasmid, pJD474, was constructed by adding one cytosine residue upstream of the BamHI restriction site of pJD465. Additional constructs with various mutations in the pseudoknot were made; the 5\u2032 portion of stem 3 was changed from\nGCGGCACAG to\nCGCCGAGAC (pJD467, also known as S3A), and this was the template for mutagenesis to make the complementary mutation in the 3\u2032 half of stem 3, CUGAUGUCGU to GUCU\nACGGCG (pJD479, S3B). The control construct with just the changes in the 3\u2032 portion of stem 3 was made from pJD465 (pJD567, S3A\u2032). pJD465 was also used as the template for mutagenesis to move the A13456 residue out of stem 3 and into loop 2 (pJD492, S3C) and to make the change A13456C (pJD544, S3C\u2032), while pJD467 was used to eliminate stem 3 entirely (pJD469, \u0394S3). Stem 2 was also subjected to mutagenesis: the 5\u2032 portion of stem 2 was changed from\nGCCCG to\nCGGGC (pJD466, S2A), and this in turn was the template for mutagenesis to make the complementary sequence in the 3\u2032 half of stem 2,\nCAGGGC to\nGACCCG (pJD480, S2B). pJD465 was used as the template to create a construct in which the bulged A13467 residue in stem 2 was eliminated by moving it 6 nt downstream (pJD491, S2C) or replaced by cytosine (pJD542, S2C\u2032).\n",
