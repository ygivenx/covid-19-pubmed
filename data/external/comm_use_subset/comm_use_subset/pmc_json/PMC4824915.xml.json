            "text": "Zika virus belongs to the virus family Flaviviridae and genus Flavivirus, initially isolated from Zika forest in Uganda (Dick, 1952). Related to other arboviruses such as chikungunya, dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis and West Nile viruses, the virus had circulated in sub-Saharan African, South and Southeast Asian and South Pacific countries. Once reaching South America, an international spread of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection has attracted global attention, as a large epidemic of ZIKV infection in Brazil was considered to have been associated with a remarkable increase in the number of microcephaly cases that are suspected to have been caused by ZIKV infection among pregnant women (Staples et al., 2016). The causal relationship between ZIKV infection and microcephaly has yet to be fully established, but an increasing amount of scientific evidence strongly supports the epidemiological link of ZIKV with microcephaly (Mlakar et al., in press; Brasil et al., in press; Nishiura et al., 2016b). Considering the expected impact on neurological manifestations including microcephaly and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS), the World Health Organization issued the Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 1 February 2016.",

Moreover, these viruses are also conveyed by the common mosquito vector, Aedes species. Technically, the infected cases could be observed in any part of the world in the presence of Aedes species, but the risk of transmission in Latin American and Caribbean countries has been anticipated to be high (Musso, Cao-Lormeau & Gubler, 2015; Bogoch et al., 2016). The transmission potential of ZIKV infection has been shown to be comparable to those of DENV and CHIKV (Nishiura et al., 2016a). Considering that there are no specific treatments for these arboviruses, it is of utmost importance to intervene transmission by preventing mosquito biting (e.g., the use of repellent) or controlling Aedes species, most notably by targeting highly invasive species including Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. The control option of Aedes spp. includes source reduction (i.e., removal of water and covering water storage containers), the use of ovitrap, chemical control, bioinsecticides and biological control (e.g., mosquitofish) (Anonymous, 2016), while recent approaches include transgenic and symbiont-based approaches and the use of plant-borne molecules (Adelman & Tu, 2016; Benelli, 2016; Benelli & Mehlhorn, 2016).",

The criterion to include a country as imported was the presence of a report based on confirmatory diagnosis made either by serological testing or detection of virus RNA. When ZIKV was isolated from mosquitoes or primates other than humans, it was considered that the country had already imported the virus, because the virus isolation implies that the local transmission had taken place. For each imported country, the arrival time was defined as the week in which the importation event had happened. When monthly or yearly data were only available or when a seroepidemiological study identified the local transmission, the median week was used as the week of importation. The latest time at which the importation week was systematically examined was 31 January 2016.",

Furthermore, the country-specific presence of Aedes species, especially focusing on Aedes albopictus, Aedes aegypti and Aedes africana, was explored (Kraemer et al., 2015; The Walter Reed Biosystematics Unit, USA, 2016). The list of countries with at least one of the abovementioned Aedes species was prepared, because the local human-vector-human transmission of ZIKV infection occurs only where the vector species are present. Similarly, we also retrieved the country-specific data regarding DENV and CHIKV epidemic (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2016a; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2016b), because they share major vector species with ZIKV and their epidemics indicate that the vector species have been actively involved in local transmission. Moreover, it has been explicitly discussed that international spread of Zika virus followed the geographic path of CHIKV (Musso, Cao-Lormeau & Gubler, 2015). The presence of Aedes species, DENV and CHIKV were all dealt with as dichotomous variable.",

Let T be a continuous random variable with probability density function of the time from importation in Brazil to importation in country j, fj(t), and cumulative distribution function Fj(t) = Pr(T < t). The function Fj(t) describes the probability that ZIKV has been already imported to a country j by time t. The time t = 0 corresponds to the time at which ZIKV infection was first recognized in Brazil and started to rapidly spread across countries (i.e., week 12 of 2015). We parameterize the hazard function \u03bb(t) using the effective distance, the metric derived from the airline transportation network (Contentshare, 2016). Let {n1, n2, \u2026nl} be the sequence of transit countries at which a traveler starting from country n1 (with a destination nl) stops over. The length of path of that travel is l.

The effective distance has been known as an excellent predictor of the arrival time of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and influenza pH1N1 2009 (Brockmann & Helbing, 2013).

Potentially high importation risk in many temperate countries has motivated us to explore the risks of importation and local transmission fuelled by travellers. Our model is not as sophisticated as mapping precise risk of transmission using seasonal population dynamics of Aedes species and temperature/climatological data (Bogoch et al., 2016; Nah et al., in press), but the findings at country levels from our study are broadly consistent with what has been briefly described at finer scales (Bogoch et al., 2016). Without using finer scale spatial data (e.g., ecological data on Geographic Information Systems), our approach has crudely and clearly distinguished the risk of local transmission from importation risk at country levels using a more tractable approach. We have shown that the predicted risk of local transmission was frequently seen in tropical and subtropical countries with DENV or CHIKV epidemic experience, while the risk of importation was more scattered around the world. The diagnostic performance of risk model for local transmission was well supported by AUC value of 0.90.",

We have shown that the risk of importation may be high in several countries given continued global travel of mildly infected travellers. However, considering that the public health concerns over ZIKV infection stems from the presence of microcephaly, it is more important to focus on the risk of local and widespread transmission that could involve pregnant women. Compared with the risk of importation, the risk of local transmission was particularly highlighted in countries with DENV and CHIKV epidemic experience. Considering that the Olympic Game in Brazil 2016 will elevate the risk of ZIKV to spread over a wider spatial extent (Petersen et al., 2016), the distinction between importation and local transmission will be even more important than it has been recognized. Whereas our risk model of local transmission relied on the presence of transmission by DENV or CHIKV, the use of such a dataset should be deemed only as a proxy. The sensitivity of our best model was 96.4%, and thus there is limited case in which the absence of DENV or CHIKV lead to the local transmission of ZIKV. However, the specificity was limited to 67.7%, indicating that there would be a number of countries in which ZIKV transmission has yet to occur even in the presence of DENV and CHIKV. Our simple model must have missed important additional predictors of local transmission in this regard, and such predictors have to be sought in the future studies. Moreover, to further improve the prediction, ecological data of vector behaviour at finer spatial scale must be incorporated with validation using epidemic data.",

            "text": "A few limitations must be discussed. First, ascertainment bias cannot be ignored for ZIKV infection with substantial fraction of asymptomatic and mild infections. The empirical data in Table 1 must have missed several importation events. Presented risks of importation and local transmission were thus probably underestimated on a whole. Second, the network data we used were static, and the airline transportation data represented only the number of flight routes (i.e., not the number of passengers). Nevertheless, assuming that the geographic patterns of travel have been maintained and only the travel volume has changed over short period of time, our simplistic approach is still justifiable to predict the global spread from 2015. Third, country-specific modelling exercise suffers from heterogeneity within each single country. For instance, the United States, China and Australia have both high and low risk areas of transmission due to vast land with different climatological areas. Finally, we estimated the importation risk of ZIKV in a country as a risk of importing ZIKV from Brazil to the country. Therefore, our model cannot capture the risk of importing ZIKV from other endemic area such as South Pacific.",

Extracting the dataset from the World Health Organization source, the week number of the report has been originally written and we used it as the week of importation. When the exact week was unavailable, the mid-point of the available time window was used as the week of importation. The first day of the year was set to be the first Sunday of January. One year was calculated to be exactly equal to 52 weeks in our analysis. Although three confirmed cases of ZIKV infection were reported in Chile on 2 February 2016, that data was ignored in the present study because the latest time was set at fourth week of 2016. We also did not count a case report from Easter Island, a Chilean island in the southeastern Pacific Ocean, because the island is geographically distant from other parts of Chile and has only one airport (World Health Organization, Western Pacific Region, 2016). In Australia, although one imported case is reported, there were no available sources of information to identify the date of confirmation. Instead, given that the corresponding article was received on 16 January 2013, we consider that the importation event took place in the previous year, 2012, and took the mid-point of the year as the week of importation (Kwong, Druce & Leder, 2013). In Zambia, a cross sectional study was conducted, but there was no available information to identify the date of importation or survey. Thus, the year of the acceptance of the article, 2015, was assumed as the year of importation (Babaniyi et al., 2015).\n",
