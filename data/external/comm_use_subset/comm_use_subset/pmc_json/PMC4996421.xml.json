Whereas the public health burden and socio-economic impact of these zoonotic pathogens vary over time and across geographical settings, their impact is often underestimated due to limited surveillance and paucity of disease burden data in most developing countries. In most cases, zoonotic diseases that cause epidemics are better characterized and tend to attract more attention and investments in prevention and control among policy makers nationally and internationally compared to endemic zoonotic diseases that heavily impact rural communities in developing countries [3\u20135]. For instance, the economic impact of the 2006\u20132007 outbreak of Rift Valley Fever (RVF) in Kenya was well-characterized and estimated at US$32 million [6], whereas the economic impact of the more commonly occurring endemic zoonotic diseases such as rabies and anthrax remains largely undetermined. For effective management of all zoonotic diseases at the national level in the context of other competing human and animal health threats, prioritization of zoonotic diseases is a key management tool in informing resource allocation.",

Semi-quantitative and qualitative methods are used where data necessary for prioritization is either insufficient or not available [7, 9]. While selection of the approach to employ differs with the data available, the prioritization process should follow a systematic process that is transparent, replicable and consultative to ensure validity of outcome [7].",

In 2012, Kenya started the implementation of the \u201cOne Health\u201d approach through the formation of an inter-ministerial coordination unit referred to as the Zoonotic Disease Unit (ZDU). The mandate of the ZDU is to enhance collaboration between the human, animal, and environmental health sectors for the prevention, control and management of zoonotic diseases [13]. Through the ZDU, Kenya developed a five-year (2012\u20132017) strategic plan for the implementation of one health in the country and listed zoonotic diseases of importance in Kenya but these were not ranked in order of priority [13]. Here, we conducted a semi-quantitative prioritization of zoonotic diseases ranking them in order of relative importance to guide allocation of resources for development and implementation of prevention and control strategies for these diseases in Kenya.",

Each group comprised of two to three public health and animal health professionals working in surveillance, disease control, laboratory, academic and research. The prioritization process consisted of five steps: identification of zoonotic diseases to be prioritized, development of measurable criteria for ranking these diseases, pairwise comparison of the criteria in order to assign weights to each disease, scoring each disease based on the criteria using a decision tree analysis, and aggregation of scores taking into consideration the weighted criteria [9].",

Secondly the \u2018epidemic potential of zoonotic disease\u2019 was found to be a more robust measure of public health impact than \u2018ease of animal to human transmission\u2019 a metric that would assess ease of pathogen transmission from one host to another. Thirdly, for \u2018socio-economic, food security and safety\u2019 as a criteria the participants argued that the socio-economic impact would encompass impact of a disease on food security to communities while food safety on the other hand was felt to be of relatively lesser importance.

For example, in North America and Japan, viral hemorrhagic fevers (Ebola and Marburg virus hemorrhagic fever and Lassa fever), epidemic diseases (Influenza (H1N1) and severe acute respiratory syndrome), rabies, Nipah virus encephalitis and prion diseases (variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and Bovine spongiform encephalopathy) were among the top five priority diseases, reflecting the focus on risk-based priority setting to zoonotic diseases with high impact on public health and trade [9, 19]. Many of the endemic diseases in Kenya are absent or low in prevalence in many of the developed countries further reducing attention given to them.

However, this list should not be static and should be reviewed regularly to take account of new data arising including of emerging infections such as ZIKA virus currently receiving attention across countries and diseases that are could have been overlooked such as toxoplasmosis. In addition, in line with the goal of this exercise and to identify and prioritize endemic zoonotic diseases with higher health burden locally, higher weights were assigned to diseases with larger geographical occurrence nationally as opposed to diseases that have occurred regionally or globally. Majority of emerging diseases that have occurred globally or regionally such as Ebola hemorrhagic fever, highly pathogenic avian influenza and Zika often receive funding from international agencies for preparedness and response based on risk of occurrence and at times irrespective of local occurrence. So it very likely in another setting depending on the goal of the prioritization exercise for these major zoonotic diseases that have occurred globally to be scored higher.

            "text": "There were however, several limitations to this work. First, the decision tree analysis requires metric measurements of disease occurrence, which were lacking for a number of diseases or that were only available from limited studies that may not be representative of the entire country. In addition, some of the disease metrics such as prevalence, OIE classification of diseases and case fatality rates could not adequately evaluate all the diseases being prioritized such as AMR. In cases where disease data were unavailable, experts provided estimates based on data from the region or from diseases closest in epidemiology to those being examined hence introducing bias. Use of multiple groups in assigning scores from expert opinion partly mitigated subjective bias that is inherent in semi-quantitative scoring. Secondly, it has been recognized that disease metrics such as DALYS that have been generated with data largely from the developed world could underestimate the public health burden of neglected endemic zoonotic diseases. Thirdly, we used a slightly modified version of the OHZDP tool, hence our output may not be comparable to outputs from other countries that used the standard version; additionally this modified approach may not be appropriate in all settings, especially when individual over group opinion is needed for buy-in and consensus building. Finally, the epidemiology of certain diseases in Kenya could have resulted in overestimation of true burden in the country resulting in high ranking of these diseases. For example, HAT is localized in western parts of Kenya while trypanosomiasis in livestock caused by Trypanosome species that are largely non-zoonotic is associated with high economic impact that resulted in high ranking of this disease despite the fact no HAT case had been reported in the last decade. Similarly, outbreaks of anthrax are associated with dramatic clinical disease events that render them easier to report and document.",

            "text": "Application of this modified version of the OHZDP tool allowed us to use qualitative and quantitative data to generate metrics for ranking diseases in a larger group setting. It is important to point out that while this disease list could be used to guide the allocation of limited resources to control diseases that ranked highly, areas of collaboration in surveillance and research should be explored for all diseases since it\u2019s likely that the lack of data particularly for diseases such as Hanta virus fever and histoplasmosis, that no surveillance programs are in place could have influenced the final outcome. Investments in innovative collaborative multi-pathogen surveillance and research programs to generate disease prevalence and burden data, and development of effective disease prevention and control strategies in human and animal populations are some key recommendations to enhance future prioritization exercises. The methods used here could potentially be applied across different health sectors to rank public health needs.",
